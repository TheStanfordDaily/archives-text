# Seeking greater fulfillment
## 
### 
A survey conducted by social analyst Daniel
Yankelovich revealed that four out of five people would
gladly dismiss work from their lives if they could be guar
anteed lifelong financial security. Not surprising, I sup
pose. But put another way, these four people were
saying that the only substantial need work has fulfilled is
financial well-being.
Today, more Americans are seeking self-fulfillment
from their jobs; many of these same people have failed
to find it. When applied to work, "fulfillment" has
proven to be a rather vague term with such diverse
candidates as money, purpose, skill, advancement, loca
tion and status vying for the highest priority.
Traditionally, money and position have become the
convenient measures of a job's satisfaction. But many
people who have climbed heights in both deny that
those benefits balance out the monotony of the work.
Yankelovich writes, "Simply put, a New Breed of
Americans have come to feel that success (traditionally
defined) is not enough to satisy their yearnings for self
fulfillment. They are reaching out for something more
and for something different."
The counter culture, among its many grievances, re
jected the nine-to-five, rush hour workstyle of their pa
rents. It was mechanical and oppressive. It lacked
creativity. They, instead, wanted something "mean
ingful."
Author Alvin Toffler in his book The Third Wave ob
served that, "People today, more affluent and educated
than their parents and faced with more life choices, sim
ply refuse to be massified."
Today, the technological revolution continues to
bring a high degree of specialization that seems to mag
nify the process and obscure the producers. Some work
ers have complained that they can take no pride in the
finished product for indeed the widget they contribute
bears no resemblance whatsoever to the eventual crea
tion.
Somewhat more soberly, James Taylor puts himself in
the shoes of one downtrodden millworker, singing "Its
just me and my machine for the rest of the morning, for
the rest of the afternoon, for the rest of my life."
There are some people who have abandoned the
search for any substantial fulfillment from their occupa
tions; they instead seek to minimize their work and max
imize their leisure. With such abandonment, they have
branded work as a necessary evil and laid it aside as a
futile attempt at fulfillment
Such a perspective is not new, for the author of Ec
clesiastes writes, "For what does a man get in all his labor
and in his striving with which he labors under the sun?
Because all his days his task is painful and grievous; even

at night his mind does not rest."
Must we conclude that work, so fundamental to man's
lifestyle, is a necessary evil with little potential for fulfill
ment?
The Scriptures clearly indicate that work was created
as a necessary and valuable part of our humanity. Gen
esis 2:15 reads, "Then the Lord God took man and put
him into the garden of Eden to cultivate it and keep it."
In Genesis 1:27-28, the assignment to work is placed in a
position indicating its fundamental importance. Prov
erbs and the Apostle Paul emphasize the importance of
diligent work, preaching it as an activity fit for good
purposes.
Economist Donald Hay writes, "Man is intended to use
resource to make goods and services that he needs for
the continuation of his social existence. This is not mate
rialism; it is part of God's intention."
The perversion of work entered as a consequence of
the Fall. It was through the curse, the result of sin, that
work became the toil-ridden activity men and women
have grumbled about for centuries.
Work, though never intended to be the source of
fulfillment, was designed by God to be meaningful and
fruitful. The sole source of fulfillment, also stated in Gen
esis, comes from a relationship with God, a relationship
which was severed at the Fall but restored in the death
and resurrection of Christ. Through this same redemp
tion, man can recover the meaningful purposes God de
signed work for, though the physical toil remains a result
of the curse.
As Adam was charged to cultivate and keep the garden
as God directed, so God has intended an individual to
exercise his own skills and interests, obeying God as he
cultivates his own land â€” his occupation.
Inherent in this is the principle that work should seek
to serve others, either other employees or the recipients
of the product of service. Recently, a Christian, just out
of college and employed by a loan company in the Bay
Area, was told to exploit the borrowers by giving them
more money than they had asked for.
Knowing that such an action might financially cripple
his clients, he refused to obey the order. He was prompt
ly fired though rehired by another company a few weeks
later. Work which did not serve others had lost its fulfill
ment.
Work also was designed to provide man with the op
portunity to build relationships, to exercise the spirit of
love found in Christ. The expression of one's humanity
through the compassion given by one's Creator was de
signed as a necessary function for man. The animosity
among many workers and employers and the mistrust
between different factions in the labor market illustrate
the need for the return of man's social purpose in work.
These original purposes are not limited to jobs with
high salaries and speedy advancements. These are at
titudes that can be employed in everything from banking
to building. The fulfillment cannot be quenched by loss
of status or gain. It is constant and lasting.
