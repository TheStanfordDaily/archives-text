## Josh ads bad 
### 
For the past month this campus has
been subjected to a thorough and ef
fective publicity blitz, leaving most us
aware that Josh McDowell will be
speaking on campus.
I have nothing against campus
groups sponsoring speakers and
educational forums; for as Disorien
tation Week clearly illustrates, they
are a necessary part of a balanced
education. I do, however, take issue
with the advertising campaign which
has precipitated McDowell's arrival.
Why has this campaign been one de
signed to create mystery and cul
tivate curiosity instead of one based
on the reputation of Josh as a fine
orator and evangelist? The majority
of the people with whom I have
spoken have stated that they may at
tend the lectures out of curiosity, or
because they have heard that he is a
good speaker rather than out of a de
sire to be morally enriched.
An advertisement in yesterday's
Daily stated: "Does Josh know ev
erything about sex? No." A literal in
terpretation of this statement makes
it seem to imply that Josh will be
elaborating on Masters and Johnson,
but obviously this is not the case. Josh
will tell us how to morally maximize
the pleasure we gain from our sex
lives, and not how to avoid pre
mature ejaculation.
All right, who could be against im
proving one's morals, but why taint a
seemingly "righteous" man with
such a provocative advertising cam
paign? Why be superficially decep
tive about a supposedly enlightening
program? Yes, my tolerance has been
pressed by the abundance of flyers
announcing the coming of Josh, but
why not sell the product by its real
name? Or is the answer too obvious?
