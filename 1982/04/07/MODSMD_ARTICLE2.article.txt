# AIM leader attacks Reagan's policies
## 
### David Azrin 
American Indian Movement (AIM)
leader Dennis Banks last night de
nounced President Ronald Reagan's
policies toward Native Americans as
a "termination of that trust that ex
isted between tribal people and the
government of this country."
Banks, one of four speakers at a
symposium entitled "Liberation
Struggles, U.S. Militarism and the La
bor Movement," addressed an au
dience of more than 100 people at
Kresge Auditorium. Sponsors of the
event were the Stanford Progressive
Alliance (SPA) and the ASSU Speak

er's Bureau.
The other speakers were Marco
Juarez, former president of the U.S.
Ironworkers Union, and a Salvado
ran medical student who was ident
ified only as Salvador.
Banks criticized the Reagan admin
istration's plans to discontinue health
and housing programs for Native
Americans on reservations begin
ning in 1983. Reagan plans to assign
this responsibility to the states. Addi
tionally, the administration supports
a bill which would terminate any
further Native American land claims.
"If federal programs for Indians

are shifted to the states," Banks pre
dicted that "it will be very hard and
very difficult for Indians to have any
control."
"Congress has a responsibility ...
to ensure that we have a decent stan
dard of living. But every time some
president comes along and decides
he knows what's best for Indian peo
ple we become like a political foot
ball from one department to the
next, and, of course, the tribal people
on the Indian reservations suffer.'
The chancellor of DQ University,
the only Native American university

in the United States, Banks also spoke
of government attempts to reclaim
the university's land near Davis.
In 1970 the federal government
ruled the 640-acre site of a former
Army communications base was
"surplus land." Founders of DQU,
primarily comprised of Native Amer
ican Studies faculty members at UC-
Davis, applied for the land and were
denied.
This led to the occupation of the
site by Native American and Chicano
students from UC-Davis and two law
suits filed on behalf of DQU by its
supporters.
The deed was given to the Board of
Trustees in an agreement which pro-'
vided for full ownership of the land
by the college 30 years after the
fulfillment of several requirements. *
After 25 separate state and federal
audits and a two and one half year FBI
investigation in which the university
was found "clean," the government*
still claims the university has violated'
its agreement.
Banks believes the government's
actions are "part of a political vendet
ta. The government has pointed an
accusing finger at DQU saying that
the American Indian Movement was
involved in a military takeover of the
land and accused us of mismanaging
the property during the 11 years that
we had it,"he said.
"Well, we haven't mismanaged it."
We've taken good care of the land.*;;
We've cleared the land and began to
grow crops whereas there was only
military use before at DQ. We've
turned it from military purposes to
peaceful and useful intentions. And
now they want it back."
Banks vowed to remain on the site
because "it would be tragic in the
pages of history if we allowed this
land to be taken away without an
ounce of struggle."
When asked what DQU would do
if the government tried to kick them
off the land, Banks replied, "I hope it
doesn't come to a confrontation like
that, but if it does, we'll ask people to
come out and help us and act as a
buffer between us and the govern
ment."
Of the original four panelists, only
two appeared. Nora Astorga, vice
minister of foreign affairs of
Nicauragua, was in the midst of "sen
sitive negotiations" in Washington,
while Barbara Masekala, chairman of
the regional committee of the
African National Congress, was
snowbound in New York.
