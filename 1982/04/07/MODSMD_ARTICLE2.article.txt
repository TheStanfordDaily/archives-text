### David Azrin 
American Indian Movement (AIM)
leader Dennis Banks last night de
nounced President Ronald Reagan's
policies toward Native Americans as
a "termination of that trust that ex
isted between tribal people and the
government of this country."
Banks, one of four speakers at a
symposium entitled "Liberation
Struggles, U.S. Militarism and the La
bor Movement," addressed an au
dience of more than 100 people at
Kresge Auditorium. Sponsors of the
event were the Stanford Progressive
Alliance (SPA) and the ASSU Speak

er's Bureau.
The other speakers were Marco
Juarez, former president of the U.S.
Ironworkers Union, and a Salvado
ran medical student who was ident
ified only as Salvador.
Banks criticized the Reagan admin
istration's plans to discontinue health
and housing programs for Native
Americans on reservations begin
ning in 1983. Reagan plans to assign
this responsibility to the states. Addi
tionally, the administration supports
a bill which would terminate any
further Native American land claims.
"If federal programs for Indians

are shifted to the states," Banks pre
dicted that "it will be very hard and
very difficult for Indians to have any
control."
"Congress has a responsibility ...
to ensure that we have a decent stan
dard of living. But every time some
president comes along and decides
he knows what's best for Indian peo
ple we become like a political foot
ball from one department to the
next, and, of course, the tribal people
on the Indian reservations suffer.'
The chancellor of DQ University,
the only Native American university

in the United States, Banks also spoke
of government attempts to reclaim
the university's land near Davis.
In 1970 the federal government
ruled the 640-acre site of a former
Army communications base was
"surplus land." Founders of DQU,
primarily comprised of Native Amer
ican Studies faculty members at UC-
Davis, applied for the land and were
denied.
This led to the occupation of the
site by Native American and Chicano
students from UC-Davis and two law
suits filed on behalf of DQU by its
