Htw comes the bride
Rather than the traditional spring for
mal, students in the Triad dorm at Eastern
Illinois University opted for a mock wed
ding ceremony as an original kind of cele
bration which would unite the whole
dorm. More than 125 students attended
the wedding and the following reception
at the Triad food service. Junior Anne
Hopp, a resident assistant at Triad, ori
ginated the idea with the feeling that a
wedding is something that everyone
would enjoy.
The mock wedding took the place of a
more expensive spring format and by
putting together the budgets of the three
residence halls, the Triad was able to fi
nance the wedding for about $240. To
keep up suspense and excitement and to
encourage more people to attend, the
jnames of the bride and groom were not
announced prior to the ceremony. Fol
lowing the stag party and bridal shower to
which all Triad residents were invited, the
couple was informed separately of their
respective roles as bride and groom. ,
Wedding guests threw bird seed at the
pair as they left the Union with the groom
toting his bride In a wheel barrel. Travel
expenses for the honeymoon were lim
ited to a dinner for two at a nearby restau
">nt. . V ■

Even as other schools are locking their
residence hall doors earlier and more
often to improve security, Oral Roberts
University (ORU) in Tulsa is bending its
otherwise tight curfew rules for women.
Beginning this semester, senior women
won't have to be in at midnight on we* 4 *-
nights or 1 a.m. on weekends. As a special
treat, they'll be allowed to stay out 15
minutes later.
This radical campus change was made
at the suggestion of the dean of women,
who told dormitory officials she "wanted
to do something special for seniors." The
decision also had to be approved by the
dean of student affairs office.
ORU female students will still sign In
each night as they return to the
dormitory, and will now be required to

list class standing. The list will be double
checked with the registrar's office to
make sure non-seniors don't take advan
tage of the new rule.
Senior women were unavailable for
comment on how they'll use the extra
time.
Dieting woes are over
The Battle of the Bulge may be won if the
new method for dieting that Irwin Lublin,
professor of psychology at Cal State Uni
versity in tos Angeles has developed is re
ally as successful as he proclaims. Lublin
said his program, which he calls "Behav
ior Modification for Weight Loss," enjoys
an 04 percent success rate In helping peo
ple keep weight off permanently.

Lublin said that when he initially began
studying weight-reducing techniques, his
first idea was to make his clients become
turned off to food by having them as
sociate their favorite food with nau
seating thoughts of electric-shock treat
ment. This approach didn't work, so
Lublin switched his method to include
just one rule. "I asked people if there
were one food they could give up per
manently, since cravings are conditioned
responses. No child is born craving sugary
things." In addition to giving up one food
item that was high in calories, Lublin
points out to his clients that substitutes
are not acceptable. "When you give up
ice cream, for example, that doesn't mean
that y<?u can substitute frozen yogurt in Its

place/' Lublin said. Lublin also requires
his clients to keep a dally ledger. In it the
client must write whattlie is going to eat
before eating it, how much he's going to
eat, how many calories it is, how hungry
he is, what time of day It is and what he's
doing at the time. The purpose of this,
Lublin said, is to force people to think
consciously about everything that goes
into their mouths. '-'This method really
makes you think twice fcbout what you're
doing/' he said.
Hazing out of hand
After detailing how her son diecHn a
hazing Incident, Eileen Stevens told
almost 100 students at University of
Southern California recently, "You are
the only ones who can bring about the
demise of the indignity, abuse, killing and
injury that still continues." Stevens de
scribed how her son was found un
conscious and turning blue after being
locked in a car trunk apd told to drink a
pint of Jack Daniels, a six-pack of beer and
a fifth of wine.
"They (the fraternity brothers) asked
for his trust, and his trust was abused/'
Stevens said in a speech sponsored by the
Sigma Nu and Sigma Alpha Mu
fraternities and the University Speakers
Committee.
The event was part of a required educa
tional campaign in which two Sigma Nu
pledges were stripped to their underwear
and left tied to a freeway sign in Bak
ersfield.
The Sigma Nu sanctions also include a
220-mile, three-day run from Bakersfield
this weekend, which will raise money for
Stevens's organization, the Committee to
Halt Useless College Killings. The
acronym for the organization, CHUCK, Is
also the name of her son, who was an
honor student at Alfred University in up
state New York in 1978. She said her son
had decided to pledge the "oldest and
most prestigious" fraternity on campus,
Klan Alpine, the afternoon he died.
"I'm not anti-fraternity, I'm anti
abuse," Stevens told the predominantly
Greek audience. "The word brotherhood
has been grossly distorted," she said. "It
(hazing) contradicts everything
fraternities stand for."

Bong ban hits Harvard
A bong ban has hit Harvard with the re
cent law banning the sale of drug para
phernalia in Massachusetts. Several store
owners plan a court appeal of the new re
strictions and a few continue to stock the
outlawed goods, hoping that legal sales
will resume. Consumers, including
Harvard students, said they doubt that the
measures will have a significant effect on
drug use.
The law approved by the State legisla
ture forbids the sale of devices related to
the ingestion of illicit drugs. Violators face
a penalty of one year in jail and a $55,000
fine, with stiffer punishments for selling
to minors. Both retailers and drugs users
predicted that a black market would soon
emerge for drug paraphernalia. "I already

know one person who plans on selling
pipes," said a Harvard sophomore, who
declined to give his name. "There's no
way to stop it,"he added.
But the law will certainly have a finan
cial impact on stores which formerly sold
the materials legally. The owner of
Shams!, a shop in the Harvard Square
Garden which used to carry para
phernalia, said he expects to lose a con
siderable amount of business as a result of
the ban, but he added that he is some
what relieved by the new law. "I hated
selling it,"he said, "t just think of the chil
. dren and I am happy." Not all merchants
are as pleased as the owner of Shamsi,
however. The Head Shop in Central
Square has been forced out of business al
together. The owner of an adjoining store
has continued to accept deliveries of the
paraphernalia on behalf of the Head
Shop, pending the outcome of planned
appeals.
Med students learn Lennon
More frorr) Collegiate Hedlines:

The songs of the Beatles have frequent
ly been college classroom fare, but a
Michigan State University instructor is
taking a slightly/different approach to the
work of John lennon.
Gerald Osborne, acting dean of aca
demic affairs in MSU's College of
Esteopathic Medicine, is dedicating a
class in the fundamentals of psy
chopathology to Lennon and is using the
late performer's songs as examples of psy
chopathological problems. For example,
"I Am The Walrus" will be used in a lec
ture on depression, and "Nowhere Man"
will help illustrate personality disorders.
Osborne says he has used other literary
works, including those of William
Shakespeare, as examples of psy
chopatholigicaldisorders in the past.
He admits some uncertainty about how
students will react to the use of Lennon's
music. "Over the past few years, medical
students have been getting straighter and
straighter," said Osborne, a self-de
scribed "aging rock 'n' roller," who con
siders lennon a hero. "I'm Assure how it
will come across." Thus far, students who
were notified by letter of the class orien
tation have reacted*positively, he said.
Tray Play
Ti<e winter blizzards that temporarily
shut down scores of campuses and even
delayed the beginning of the new term at
others swept away something different at
the Unviersity of Georgia: dining hail
•trays.
According to some estimates, students
carted off as many as 450 trays —worth an
estimated $2000 — to use as sleds when
the university closed down because of a
snowstorm, the College Press Service re
ported recently,
"You've got to understand it only
snows here about once every ten years,
and when it does these students go wild,"
said Glen Gerrett, Georgia's food service
director. During the sledding festival,
Athens police had to break up a crowd of
some 500 students whose snowball fights
were disrupting traffic through the cam-1
pus.

After detailing how her son diecHn a
hazing Incident, Eileen Stevens told
almost 100 students at University of
Southern California recently, "You are
the only ones who can bring about the
demise of the indignity, abuse, killing and
injury that still continues." Stevens de
scribed how her son was found un
conscious and turning blue after being
locked in a car trunk apd told to drink a
pint of Jack Daniels, a six-pack of beer and
a fifth of wine.
"They (the fraternity brothers) asked
for his trust, and his trust was abused/'
Stevens said in a speech sponsored by the
Sigma Nu and Sigma Alpha Mu
fraternities and the University Speakers
Committee.
The event was part of a required educa
tional campaign in which two Sigma Nu
pledges were stripped to their underwear
and left tied to a freeway sign in Bak
ersfield.
The Sigma Nu sanctions also include a
220-mile, three-day run from Bakersfield
this weekend, which will raise money for
Stevens's organization, the Committee to
Halt Useless College Killings. The
acronym for the organization, CHUCK, Is
also the name of her son, who was an
honor student at Alfred University in up
state New York in 1978. She said her son
had decided to pledge the "oldest and
most prestigious" fraternity on campus,
Klan Alpine, the afternoon he died.
"I'm not anti-fraternity, I'm anti
abuse," Stevens told the predominantly
Greek audience. "The word brotherhood
has been grossly distorted," she said. "It
(hazing) contradicts everything
fraternities stand for."

Bong ban hits Harvard
A bong ban has hit Harvard with the re
cent law banning the sale of drug para
phernalia in Massachusetts. Several store
owners plan a court appeal of the new re
strictions and a few continue to stock the
outlawed goods, hoping that legal sales
will resume. Consumers, including
Harvard students, said they doubt that the
measures will have a significant effect on
drug use.
The law approved by the State legisla
ture forbids the sale of devices related to
the ingestion of illicit drugs. Violators face
a penalty of one year in jail and a $55,000
fine, with stiffer punishments for selling
to minors. Both retailers and drugs users
predicted that a black market would soon
emerge for drug paraphernalia. "I already

know one person who plans on selling
pipes," said a Harvard sophomore, who
declined to give his name. "There's no
way to stop it,"he added.
But the law will certainly have a finan
cial impact on stores which formerly sold
the materials legally. The owner of
Shams!, a shop in the Harvard Square
Garden which used to carry para
phernalia, said he expects to lose a con
siderable amount of business as a result of
the ban, but he added that he is some
what relieved by the new law. "I hated
selling it,"he said, "t just think of the chil
. dren and I am happy." Not all merchants
are as pleased as the owner of Shamsi,
however. The Head Shop in Central
Square has been forced out of business al
together. The owner of an adjoining store
has continued to accept deliveries of the
paraphernalia on behalf of the Head
Shop, pending the outcome of planned
appeals.
Med students learn Lennon
More frorr) Collegiate Hedlines:

The songs of the Beatles have frequent
ly been college classroom fare, but a
Michigan State University instructor is
taking a slightly/different approach to the
work of John lennon.
Gerald Osborne, acting dean of aca
demic affairs in MSU's College of
Esteopathic Medicine, is dedicating a
class in the fundamentals of psy
chopathology to Lennon and is using the
late performer's songs as examples of psy
chopathological problems. For example,
"I Am The Walrus" will be used in a lec
ture on depression, and "Nowhere Man"
will help illustrate personality disorders.
Osborne says he has used other literary
works, including those of William
Shakespeare, as examples of psy
chopatholigicaldisorders in the past.
He admits some uncertainty about how
students will react to the use of Lennon's
music. "Over the past few years, medical
students have been getting straighter and
straighter," said Osborne, a self-de
scribed "aging rock 'n' roller," who con
siders lennon a hero. "I'm Assure how it
will come across." Thus far, students who
were notified by letter of the class orien
tation have reacted*positively, he said.
Tray Play
Ti<e winter blizzards that temporarily
shut down scores of campuses and even
delayed the beginning of the new term at
others swept away something different at
the Unviersity of Georgia: dining hail

According to some estimates, students
carted off as many as 450 trays —worth an
estimated $2000 — to use as sleds when
the university closed down because of a
snowstorm, the College Press Service re
ported recently,
"You've got to understand it only
snows here about once every ten years,
and when it does these students go wild,"
said Glen Gerrett, Georgia's food service
director. During the sledding festival,
Athens police had to break up a crowd of
some 500 students whose snowball fights
were disrupting traffic through the cam-1

Htw comes the bride
Rather than the traditional spring for
mal, students in the Triad dorm at Eastern
Illinois University opted for a mock wed
ding ceremony as an original kind of cele
bration which would unite the whole
dorm. More than 125 students attended
the wedding and the following reception
at the Triad food service. Junior Anne
Hopp, a resident assistant at Triad, ori
ginated the idea with the feeling that a
wedding is something that everyone
would enjoy.
The mock wedding took the place of a
more expensive spring format and by
putting together the budgets of the three
residence halls, the Triad was able to fi
nance the wedding for about $240. To
keep up suspense and excitement and to
encourage more people to attend, the
jnames of the bride and groom were not
announced prior to the ceremony. Fol
lowing the stag party and bridal shower to
which all Triad residents were invited, the
couple was informed separately of their
respective roles as bride and groom. ,
Wedding guests threw bird seed at the
pair as they left the Union with the groom
toting his bride In a wheel barrel. Travel
expenses for the honeymoon were lim
ited to a dinner for two at a nearby restau

Even as other schools are locking their
residence hall doors earlier and more
often to improve security, Oral Roberts
University (ORU) in Tulsa is bending its
otherwise tight curfew rules for women.
Beginning this semester, senior women
won't have to be in at midnight on we* 4 *-
nights or 1 a.m. on weekends. As a special
treat, they'll be allowed to stay out 15
minutes later.
This radical campus change was made
at the suggestion of the dean of women,
who told dormitory officials she "wanted
to do something special for seniors." The
decision also had to be approved by the
dean of student affairs office.
ORU female students will still sign In
each night as they return to the
dormitory, and will now be required to

list class standing. The list will be double

Dieting woes are over
The Battle of the Bulge may be won if the
new method for dieting that Irwin Lublin,
professor of psychology at Cal State Uni
versity in tos Angeles has developed is re
ally as successful as he proclaims. Lublin
said his program, which he calls "Behav
ior Modification for Weight Loss," enjoys
an 04 percent success rate In helping peo
ple keep weight off permanently.

Lublin said that when he initially began
studying weight-reducing techniques, his
first idea was to make his clients become
turned off to food by having them as
sociate their favorite food with nau
seating thoughts of electric-shock treat
ment. This approach didn't work, so
Lublin switched his method to include
just one rule. "I asked people if there
were one food they could give up per
manently, since cravings are conditioned
responses. No child is born craving sugary
things." In addition to giving up one food
item that was high in calories, Lublin
points out to his clients that substitutes
are not acceptable. "When you give up
ice cream, for example, that doesn't mean
that y<?u can substitute frozen yogurt in Its

place/' Lublin said. Lublin also requires
his clients to keep a dally ledger. In it the
client must write whattlie is going to eat
before eating it, how much he's going to
eat, how many calories it is, how hungry
he is, what time of day It is and what he's
doing at the time. The purpose of this,
Lublin said, is to force people to think
consciously about everything that goes
into their mouths. '-'This method really
makes you think twice fcbout what you're
doing/' he said.

He admits some uncertainty about how
students will react to the use of Lennon's
music. "Over the past few years, medical
students have been getting straighter and
straighter," said Osborne, a self-de
scribed "aging rock 'n' roller," who con
siders lennon a hero. "I'm Assure how it
will come across." Thus far, students who
were notified by letter of the class orien
tation have reacted*positively, he said.
Tray Play
Ti<e winter blizzards that temporarily
shut down scores of campuses and even
delayed the beginning of the new term at
others swept away something different at
the Unviersity of Georgia: dining hail
•trays.
According to some estimates, students
carted off as many as 450 trays —worth an
estimated $2000 — to use as sleds when
the university closed down because of a
snowstorm, the College Press Service re
ported recently,
"You've got to understand it only
snows here about once every ten years,
and when it does these students go wild,"
said Glen Gerrett, Georgia's food service
director. During the sledding festival,
Athens police had to break up a crowd of
some 500 students whose snowball fights
were disrupting traffic through the cam-1
pus.

Htw comes the bride
Rather than the traditional spring for
mal, students in the Triad dorm at Eastern
Illinois University opted for a mock wed
ding ceremony as an original kind of cele
bration which would unite the whole
dorm. More than 125 students attended
the wedding and the following reception
at the Triad food service. Junior Anne
Hopp, a resident assistant at Triad, ori
ginated the idea with the feeling that a
wedding is something that everyone
would enjoy.
The mock wedding took the place of a
more expensive spring format and by
putting together the budgets of the three
residence halls, the Triad was able to fi
nance the wedding for about $240. To
keep up suspense and excitement and to
encourage more people to attend, the
jnames of the bride and groom were not
announced prior to the ceremony. Fol
lowing the stag party and bridal shower to
which all Triad residents were invited, the
couple was informed separately of their
respective roles as bride and groom. ,
Wedding guests threw bird seed at the
pair as they left the Union with the groom
toting his bride In a wheel barrel. Travel
expenses for the honeymoon were lim
ited to a dinner for two at a nearby restau
">nt. . V ■

Giving them an inch?

Even as other schools are locking their
residence hall doors earlier and more
often to improve security, Oral Roberts
University (ORU) in Tulsa is bending its
otherwise tight curfew rules for women.
Beginning this semester, senior women
won't have to be in at midnight on we* 4 *-
nights or 1 a.m. on weekends. As a special
treat, they'll be allowed to stay out 15
minutes later.
This radical campus change was made
at the suggestion of the dean of women,
who told dormitory officials she "wanted
to do something special for seniors." The
decision also had to be approved by the
dean of student affairs office.
ORU female students will still sign In
each night as they return to the
dormitory, and will now be required to

list class standing. The list will be double
checked with the registrar's office to
make sure non-seniors don't take advan
tage of the new rule.
Senior women were unavailable for
comment on how they'll use the extra
time.
Dieting woes are over
The Battle of the Bulge may be won if the
new method for dieting that Irwin Lublin,
professor of psychology at Cal State Uni
versity in tos Angeles has developed is re
ally as successful as he proclaims. Lublin
said his program, which he calls "Behav
ior Modification for Weight Loss," enjoys
an 04 percent success rate In helping peo
ple keep weight off permanently.

Lublin said that when he initially began
studying weight-reducing techniques, his
first idea was to make his clients become
turned off to food by having them as
sociate their favorite food with nau
seating thoughts of electric-shock treat
ment. This approach didn't work, so
Lublin switched his method to include
just one rule. "I asked people if there
were one food they could give up per
manently, since cravings are conditioned
responses. No child is born craving sugary
things." In addition to giving up one food
item that was high in calories, Lublin
points out to his clients that substitutes
are not acceptable. "When you give up
ice cream, for example, that doesn't mean
that y<?u can substitute frozen yogurt in Its

place/' Lublin said. Lublin also requires
his clients to keep a dally ledger. In it the
client must write whattlie is going to eat
before eating it, how much he's going to
eat, how many calories it is, how hungry
he is, what time of day It is and what he's
doing at the time. The purpose of this,
Lublin said, is to force people to think
consciously about everything that goes
into their mouths. '-'This method really
makes you think twice fcbout what you're
doing/' he said.
Hazing out of hand
After detailing how her son diecHn a
hazing Incident, Eileen Stevens told
almost 100 students at University of
Southern California recently, "You are
the only ones who can bring about the
demise of the indignity, abuse, killing and
injury that still continues." Stevens de
scribed how her son was found un
conscious and turning blue after being
locked in a car trunk apd told to drink a
pint of Jack Daniels, a six-pack of beer and
a fifth of wine.
"They (the fraternity brothers) asked
for his trust, and his trust was abused/'
Stevens said in a speech sponsored by the
Sigma Nu and Sigma Alpha Mu
fraternities and the University Speakers
Committee.
The event was part of a required educa
tional campaign in which two Sigma Nu
pledges were stripped to their underwear
and left tied to a freeway sign in Bak
ersfield.
The Sigma Nu sanctions also include a
220-mile, three-day run from Bakersfield
this weekend, which will raise money for
Stevens's organization, the Committee to
Halt Useless College Killings. The
acronym for the organization, CHUCK, Is
also the name of her son, who was an
honor student at Alfred University in up
state New York in 1978. She said her son
had decided to pledge the "oldest and
most prestigious" fraternity on campus,
Klan Alpine, the afternoon he died.
"I'm not anti-fraternity, I'm anti
abuse," Stevens told the predominantly
Greek audience. "The word brotherhood
has been grossly distorted," she said. "It
(hazing) contradicts everything
fraternities stand for."

Bong ban hits Harvard
A bong ban has hit Harvard with the re
cent law banning the sale of drug para
phernalia in Massachusetts. Several store
owners plan a court appeal of the new re
strictions and a few continue to stock the
outlawed goods, hoping that legal sales
will resume. Consumers, including
Harvard students, said they doubt that the
measures will have a significant effect on
drug use.
The law approved by the State legisla
ture forbids the sale of devices related to
the ingestion of illicit drugs. Violators face
a penalty of one year in jail and a $55,000
fine, with stiffer punishments for selling
to minors. Both retailers and drugs users
predicted that a black market would soon
emerge for drug paraphernalia. "I already

know one person who plans on selling
pipes," said a Harvard sophomore, who
declined to give his name. "There's no
way to stop it,"he added.
But the law will certainly have a finan
cial impact on stores which formerly sold
the materials legally. The owner of
Shams!, a shop in the Harvard Square
Garden which used to carry para
phernalia, said he expects to lose a con
siderable amount of business as a result of
the ban, but he added that he is some
what relieved by the new law. "I hated
selling it,"he said, "t just think of the chil
. dren and I am happy." Not all merchants
are as pleased as the owner of Shamsi,
however. The Head Shop in Central
Square has been forced out of business al
together. The owner of an adjoining store
has continued to accept deliveries of the
paraphernalia on behalf of the Head
Shop, pending the outcome of planned
appeals.
Med students learn Lennon
More frorr) Collegiate Hedlines:

The songs of the Beatles have frequent
ly been college classroom fare, but a
Michigan State University instructor is
taking a slightly/different approach to the
work of John lennon.
Gerald Osborne, acting dean of aca
demic affairs in MSU's College of
Esteopathic Medicine, is dedicating a
class in the fundamentals of psy
chopathology to Lennon and is using the
late performer's songs as examples of psy
chopathological problems. For example,
"I Am The Walrus" will be used in a lec
ture on depression, and "Nowhere Man"
will help illustrate personality disorders.
Osborne says he has used other literary
works, including those of William
Shakespeare, as examples of psy
chopatholigicaldisorders in the past.
He admits some uncertainty about how
students will react to the use of Lennon's
music. "Over the past few years, medical
students have been getting straighter and
straighter," said Osborne, a self-de
scribed "aging rock 'n' roller," who con
siders lennon a hero. "I'm Assure how it
will come across." Thus far, students who
