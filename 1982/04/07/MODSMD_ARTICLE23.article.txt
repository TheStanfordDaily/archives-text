## Card rips UCSB, starts long week 
### Sally Jenkins Senior sports writer 
The Stanford men's tennis
team cruised by UC-Santa
Barbara 7-2 yesterday at the
varsity courts, its first victory af
ter an almost two week lay-off
caused by various and sundry
monsoons and gale force
winds.
Stanford took a 4-2 lead after
the singles and iced the win by
sweeping all three doubles. At
No.}, a win for Mark McKeen
and Jimmy Miller marked the
first time all season head coach
Gould has found a win
ning! combination at the bot
tom doubles spot, and the first
time; Stanford has swept all
three in a dual match.
But the Cardinal started
slowly against Santa Barbara, a
little rusty after matches against
San jose State and UC-Berkeley
werÂ£ rained out last week. In
the | meantime the squad
grabbed what little practice
time it could indoors, and then

unleashed itself on UCSB like a
mudslide in Marin.
"We're so close to being a
really good team, and we need
a win like this for confidence
going into the important
matches," said Gould. "We've
just been a point or two from
winning every match we lost,"
he added. "We can't let four or
five losses get us down."
The Cardinal is 9-4 after yes
terday's victory, which was the
first leg of a crucial four-match
stretch.
Stanford faces Washington
today at 1:30 p.m., the Univer
sity of Arizona Friday after
noon, and Arizona State Satur
day afternoon. Both Arizona
teams contributed to Stan
ford's loss column two weeks
ago, so the Cardinal will be
looking for badly needed re
venge on its own turf.
The results of the matches
will determine whether the
Cardinal, which has been

harder to figure than a Granola
nut bar lately, will have a
bonified shot at defending the
NCAA title, or of even reaching
the National tournament.
The grueling schedule coin
cides with a shake up in the
Cardinal ranks. Gould moved
sophomore McKeen to N0.2
singles, and senior Scott Bond
urant, formerly N0.2, was
shifted to,McKeen's old N0.5
position. Freshman Paul Rob
inson dropped to N0.7 and
Jimmy Miller moved into the
starting lineup in his place.
The toughest matches yes
terday rightly enough oc
curred on courts N0.2 and
N0.5, where McKeen and
Bondurant both faced
tiebreakers in their three set
matches.
McKeen wrestled with sen
ior Larry Barnett to win a sec
ond set tiebreaker only to lose
in a replay of his first set, 3-6,7-6
(7-2), 3-6. Meanwhile Bond
urant also dropped his first set

only to come back and break a
three-match losing streak with
a 4-6,7-6 (7-4),6-3 victory over
junior Chris Stevens of UCSB.
At No.l Card sophomore
Scott Davis ran freshman Gus
Andersen off the court in two
sets 6-2, 6-2, no small feat since
Anderson counts Craig Venter
of UCLA and Olin Hallgren of
Brigham Young in his victory
column. At N0.3 Card senior
John Corse whipped Marsh
Riggs 6-4, 6-3, and Card senior
Jeff Arons had one of his
strongest matches of the sea
son, defeating UCSB's Mark
Finerman 6-4 6-2 at N0.4.
In doubles, Arons and Davis
defeated Andersen and
Barnett 6-3, 6-1, Corse and
Bondurant beat Riggs and Greg
Anderson 3-6, 6-3, 6-1, and
McKeen and Miller ran
through Kevin Lubbers and
Chris Russell 6-2,6-3.
Today's match begins at 1:30
p.m. on the varsity courts.
