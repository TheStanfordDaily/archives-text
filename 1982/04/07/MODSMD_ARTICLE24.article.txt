# Kings face 'The Great Gretzky'
## 
### Los Angeles Times 
EDMONTON, Canada — Last spring, owner Jerry Buss sent the
Los Angeles Kings on an expense-paid vacation to Hawaii.
This spring, Buss could do his club a much greater service by
sending Wayne Gretzky there — or anyplace where, when you
mention Zamboni, the natives think you're talking about a new
tropical drink.
But instead, Gretzky will be here, drawing his one-of-a-kind
figure 99s against the Kings when the Stanley Cup playoffs open
Wednesday in eight NHL cities. The first round is a best-of-five af
fair and all subsequent rounds will be best-of-seven.
If the Kings made a highlight film of their playoff past, it would
corpe under the heading of a short subject. One round and out
has been the story in each of the last four seasons, and this prom
ises to be no different.
Eyen Coach Don Perry concedes as much. "Our chances are
not'very good," he said. "I'd feel a lot more confident if we had
finished strong (the Kings lost seven of their last eight), but unless
we J-eally pull a reversal, our chances are very, very slim."
Then again, if the playoffs were being conducted under last sea

son's format, when the top 16 teams in overall standings qualified,
instead of this season's division format, the Kings already would
be on vacation. With 63 points, they finished 17th overall.
The Oilers, meanwhile, aim to put the finishing touches on a
remarkable, record-setting season that will appear merely or
dinary — or worse — if they do not succeed in the playoffs.
As if the presence of Gretzky isn't enough inspiration, after
practice Monday the Oilers rented a movie theater, paid $58 for a
projectionist and $4 an hour for a popcorn vendor, and sat down
as a team to watch "Chariots of Fire."
But while it is generally conceded that the Oilers will be in the
race until the end, no one is conceding that they are strong
enough to overtake the New York Islanders, who have won the
Cup the last two seasons and, if anything, are more imposing this
season.
The Islanders finished the season, one in which they might have
been expected to coast, with 118 points, a club record. They won
15 in a row at one point, a league record.


IT'S A START — Stanford men's crew team started out on

Cup last weekend. The women's crew traveled to the San

division-by-division rundown:
impbell Conference
SMYTHE DIVISION
e Oilers, the highest-scoring team in NHL history (417 goals),
e to have little trouble with the Kings, who gave up the most
s (369) in .their history. Actually, there's no team in this
ion that appears capable of posing a problem for Gretzky and
Vancouver, which finished strong (unbeaten in its last nine)
es to get the chance by beating Calgary, with Richard
leur giving the Canucks the edge in goaltending. The Flames,
ite big years from Lanny McDonald (40 goals) and Mel
jman (33 goals, 54 assists) have been a mystery all season after
ng the Cup semifinals last season.
NORMS DIVISION
innesota had the best season in its history, and has a historv of

playing better in the playoffs. The North Stars opposed the Is
landers in the finals last season, and with Bobby Smith (114 points),
Dino Ciccarelli (55 goals, 107 points), rookie Neal Broten (97
points), a defense led by All-Star Craig Hartsburg and solid goal
tending in Gilles Meloche, could be there again this May. But
before they get there, they may first have to dispose of Winnipeg,
the most improved team in NHL history and the club with the best
rookie (45-goal scorer Dale Hawerchuk) and best old timer (ex-
Montreal defenseman Serge Savard). St. Louis could surprise if
Blues give any help at all to goalie Mike Liut; Chicago goalie Tony
EspQsito, who is at a point in his career where he needs all the help
he can get, doesn't figure to get it from the Black Hawks.
Wales Conference
PATRICK DIVISION
The Islanders, who meet Pittsburgh, then face the winner of the
Flyers-Rangers battle, a word not to be taken lightly in Philadel
phia. The Rangers, who won season series 4-2-2, would appear to
have the edge, but the Flyers, under new Coach Bob McCammon,
have been playing a lot better. Neither team, however, is strong
enough to beat the Islanders.
ADAMS DIVISION
The Canadiens must survive first-round series with Quebec,
which approaches every game against Montreal as a crusade.
Teams finished season series even at 3-3-2, but Canadiens have
what rates as the league's best defense with Rod Langway, Brian
Engblom and Larry Robinson and should put away the Nordiques
and the flying Stastny brothers. Boston, which did a superb job of
blending aging players like Brad Park with outstanding rookies
like Barry Pederson, has questionable goaltending in Marco
Baron and Regie Vachon and might not get past Buffalo, which
has acknowledged coaching genius Scotty Bowman behind the
bench.
