# Kings face 'The Great Gretzky'
## 
### Los Angeles Times 
EDMONTON, Canada — Last spring, owner Jerry Buss sent the
Los Angeles Kings on an expense-paid vacation to Hawaii.
This spring, Buss could do his club a much greater service by
sending Wayne Gretzky there — or anyplace where, when you
mention Zamboni, the natives think you're talking about a new
tropical drink.
But instead, Gretzky will be here, drawing his one-of-a-kind
figure 99s against the Kings when the Stanley Cup playoffs open
Wednesday in eight NHL cities. The first round is a best-of-five af
fair and all subsequent rounds will be best-of-seven.
If the Kings made a highlight film of their playoff past, it would
corpe under the heading of a short subject. One round and out
has been the story in each of the last four seasons, and this prom
ises to be no different.
Eyen Coach Don Perry concedes as much. "Our chances are
not'very good," he said. "I'd feel a lot more confident if we had
finished strong (the Kings lost seven of their last eight), but unless
we J-eally pull a reversal, our chances are very, very slim."
Then again, if the playoffs were being conducted under last sea

son's format, when the top 16 teams in overall standings qualified,
instead of this season's division format, the Kings already would
be on vacation. With 63 points, they finished 17th overall.
The Oilers, meanwhile, aim to put the finishing touches on a
remarkable, record-setting season that will appear merely or
dinary — or worse — if they do not succeed in the playoffs.
As if the presence of Gretzky isn't enough inspiration, after
practice Monday the Oilers rented a movie theater, paid $58 for a
projectionist and $4 an hour for a popcorn vendor, and sat down
as a team to watch "Chariots of Fire."
But while it is generally conceded that the Oilers will be in the
race until the end, no one is conceding that they are strong
enough to overtake the New York Islanders, who have won the
Cup the last two seasons and, if anything, are more imposing this
season.
The Islanders finished the season, one in which they might have
been expected to coast, with 118 points, a club record. They won
15 in a row at one point, a league record.


IT'S A START — Stanford men's crew team started out on
thelf trek toward national recognition by winning the Cal
Cup last weekend. The women's crew traveled to the San

Diego Crew Classic and picked up fourths in both varsity
and junior varsity races.
