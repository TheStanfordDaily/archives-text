# Stanford rows to Cal Cup win

In the first step for the
Cardinal oarsmen in their
quest for national prominence,
Stanford won the Cal Cup last
weekend.
"We still have to prove
ourselves against the likes of
Washington and Cal," coach
Bob Whitford said, "but I ex
pect a successful season."
In the Cal Cup, Stanford jun
ior varsity and second novice
boats were fifth in their respec
tive heats, while the first novice
shell took fourth.
Stanford women's crew
coach John Davis took his varsi

ty and junior varsity boats
down to the San Diego Crew
Classic this weekend and came
back with two fourth-place fin
ishes. The highlight of the meet
for the women came when the
novice boat won the final, de
feating rival Cal's novice boat
for the first time.
The varsity women entered
their first heat with high hopes
and finished second to defend
ing champion University of
Washington. The Huskies'
strong start was the difference
in the outcome according to
Davis. In the final, Stanford had
some problems in the strong
tail wind and choppy waters

but managed to finish fourth
behind Victoria, British Colum
bia, Washington and Cal.
Davis does not feel that Cal's
victory is significant this early in
the season. Ten California uni
versities will compete at
Redwood Shores this Friday,
Saturday, and Sunday. Races
start Sunday at 8 a.m. Stanford's
junior varsity team and second
novice boats race Friday eve
ning against Humboldt State
and Sunday against the Univer
sity of California at San Diego.
The varsity competes for the
Findly cup Saturday with USC
and Santa Clara.
