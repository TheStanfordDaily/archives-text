# Berns Aside
## Leland IV rejected 
### Adam Berns 
Although Athletic Director
Andy Geiger will not officially
release the names, there were
many candidates for the Stan
ford basketball coaching posi
tion. Most people heard the
names of Tom Davis, Indiana's
Bobby Knight, San Jose State's
Bill Berry, and the many other
candidates being thrown
around. There was one can
didate for the position, how
ever, far more qualified than all
the others. This candidate per
sonified the ideals that Stan
ford stands for more than any
man alive. Only a few sources,
the Daily among them, knew
about this candidate, and the
Daily is bewildered why this
candidate for the coaching
position did not receive more
attention.
Although not talked about at
all in the media, this candidate
certainly would not have had
any problem with name recog
nition. His name embodies
that Stanford spirit of mixing
academics with athletics. He
has been an educator, as well as
a coach and is the perfect ex
ample of fusion between the
two.
This man has been coaching
sports in the Bay Area for 21
years. Born in San Mateo and
raised in the East Bay, this man
attended San Francisco State.
He is presently coaching
teams with far less talent than
Stanford, and is well-versed in
teaching the fundamentals of
basketball. For a team which
had as many turnovers as Stan
ford did last year, this back to
basics approach would certain
ly be refreshing.
Although the Daily had ac
cess to the information that this
man was a candidate for the
coaching position, discretion
has been used in publicizing
his name so as not to interfere
with Geiger's highly-sensitive
and secretive search for the
perfect coach.

What follows are excerpts
from a letter sent to the Daily
by this candidate in early
March.
"(After) a recent reading of
the resignation of Stanford
University's men's basketball
coach, I felt it was the right time
to apply for this fabulous open
ing.
"Talking to several friends
and cousins, I decided to write
for an interview for the posi
tion of head basketball (coach)
at my namesake Leland Stan
ford jr. University.
"It has been regarded as a
tremendous challenge. I have,
as my father had been, an ath
letic coach of many sports and
my love for coaching or
teaching basketball at Stanford
has been on my mind for many
year*
"My name is Leland Stan
ford. I am fourth in name and
the great grand-nephew of the
founder of Leland Stanford Jr.
University.
"I am an educator and have
been a coach of many athletic
teams in our Bay Area... I have
been teaching and coaching in
the Alameda Schools for now
21 years.
"Dr. Wallace Sterling and Dr.
Donald Kennedy along with
many named coaches past and
present know of me.
"Your publicity of having a
namesake be your basketball
coach would be most ap
preciated."

Spring football practice
started yesterday and will con
tinue for the noxt five weeks.
Last year, the football team
had a rather disappointing year
(4-7). The team came on strong
near the end, however, averag
ing 596.4 yards and 42.8 points
in its last five games.
Part of the problem last year
was that offensive coordinator
Jim Fassel — a USC alum —
tried to set up the pass by using
the run. A totally logical propo
sition at any other school, but
not at Stanford. The Cardinal
lives and sometimes dies by the

pass, and to alter this tradition
not only loses games, but
makes things totally unexciting
for the fickle Stanford crowd.
Fassel seems to have learned
his lesson well. By the end of
the season, Stanford was using
the pass to set up the run and
compiled some amazing of
fensive statistics.
In his third season as coach,
Paul Wiggin will have three of
his own recruiting classes
playing for him next year. In his
three years here, Wiggin has
recruited surprisingly well. Last
year's class was rated by many
sources as the best group of re
cruits in the country.
Last week in the San Francis
co Chronicle columnist Glenn
Dickey was very optimistic
about the Stanford football
team next year. Boasting its
best talent in recent years,
things look bright for Cardinal
football.
Last year, a certain Bay Area
sportswriter said that "the hon
eymoon is over" between the
fans in the Bay Area and 49er
coach Bill Walsh. Now is the
year for him to produce. Well,
Walsh was certainly up to the
task, and the prediction here is
that Wiggin will be also.

Part of the problem last year
was that offensive coordinator
Jim Fassel — a USC alum —
tried to set up the pass by using
the run. A totally logical propo
sition at any other school, but
not at Stanford. The Cardinal
lives and sometimes dies by the

pass, and to alter this tradition
not only loses games, but
makes things totally unexciting
for the fickle Stanford crowd.
Fassel seems to have learned
his lesson well. By the end of
the season, Stanford was using
the pass to set up the run and
compiled some amazing of
fensive statistics.
In his third season as coach,
Paul Wiggin will have three of
his own recruiting classes
playing for him next year. In his
three years here, Wiggin has
recruited surprisingly well. Last
year's class was rated by many
sources as the best group of re
cruits in the country.
Last week in the San Francis
co Chronicle columnist Glenn
Dickey was very optimistic
about the Stanford football
team next year. Boasting its
best talent in recent years,
things look bright for Cardinal
football.
Last year, a certain Bay Area
sportswriter said that "the hon
eymoon is over" between the
fans in the Bay Area and 49er
coach Bill Walsh. Now is the
year for him to produce. Well,
Walsh was certainly up to the
task, and the prediction here is
that Wiggin will be also.

Last weekend that Stanford
women's soccer team took sec
ond in the Westmont Invita
tional tournament. Stanford
went 2-1 in the tournament,
losing in the finals to Chico
State.
The Cardinal won their first
game against the University of
California at Santa Barbara 2-0.
Kim Gaumer scored both goals
in the game with assists from
Lisa Schaffer and Cindy
Schorney.
In their second game, the
Cardinal women beat the Uni
versity of Arizona 4-1. Kim
Gaumer and Sue Moore each
scored one goal, while Nancy
Geisse scored twice. Three
Stanford women made the all
tournament team: Moore,
Geisse, and Katherine Morris.
Geisse was also one of 44
players selected to play on a na
tional team in May. She was the
only player from Northern Cal
ifornia to be selected.
This Saturday the Stanford
women will travel to Hayward.

Although Athletic Director
Andy Geiger will not officially
release the names, there were
many candidates for the Stan
ford basketball coaching posi
tion. Most people heard the
names of Tom Davis, Indiana's
Bobby Knight, San Jose State's
Bill Berry, and the many other
candidates being thrown
around. There was one can
didate for the position, how
ever, far more qualified than all
the others. This candidate per
sonified the ideals that Stan
ford stands for more than any
man alive. Only a few sources,
the Daily among them, knew
about this candidate, and the
Daily is bewildered why this
candidate for the coaching
position did not receive more
attention.
Although not talked about at
all in the media, this candidate
certainly would not have had
any problem with name recog
nition. His name embodies
that Stanford spirit of mixing
academics with athletics. He
has been an educator, as well as
a coach and is the perfect ex
ample of fusion between the
two.
This man has been coaching
sports in the Bay Area for 21
years. Born in San Mateo and
raised in the East Bay, this man
attended San Francisco State.
He is presently coaching
teams with far less talent than
Stanford, and is well-versed in
teaching the fundamentals of
basketball. For a team which
had as many turnovers as Stan
ford did last year, this back to
basics approach would certain
ly be refreshing.
Although the Daily had ac
cess to the information that this
man was a candidate for the
coaching position, discretion
has been used in publicizing
his name so as not to interfere
with Geiger's highly-sensitive
and secretive search for the
perfect coach.

What follows are excerpts
from a letter sent to the Daily
by this candidate in early
March.
"(After) a recent reading of
the resignation of Stanford
University's men's basketball
coach, I felt it was the right time
to apply for this fabulous open
ing.
"Talking to several friends
and cousins, I decided to write
for an interview for the posi
tion of head basketball (coach)
at my namesake Leland Stan
ford jr. University.
"It has been regarded as a
tremendous challenge. I have,
as my father had been, an ath
letic coach of many sports and
my love for coaching or
teaching basketball at Stanford
has been on my mind for many
year*
"My name is Leland Stan
ford. I am fourth in name and
the great grand-nephew of the
founder of Leland Stanford Jr.
University.
"I am an educator and have
been a coach of many athletic
teams in our Bay Area... I have
been teaching and coaching in
the Alameda Schools for now
21 years.
"Dr. Wallace Sterling and Dr.
Donald Kennedy along with
many named coaches past and
present know of me.
"Your publicity of having a
namesake be your basketball
coach would be most ap
preciated."

Spring football practice
