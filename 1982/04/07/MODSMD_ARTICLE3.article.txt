U.S. stays neutral in Falklands dispute
Washington — Vowing to remain neutral in the confrontation over
the Falkland Islands, the Reagan administration yesterday formally of
fered the good offices of the United States to help avert war between
Great Britain and Argentina.
Secretary of State Alexander Haig met separately yesterday with Brit
ish and Argentine diplomats. Administration officials described Haig's
meetings as an expression of U.S. willingness to help rather than an out
right attempt to mediate the dispute, but informed administration
sources said that the United States was certain to step up its efforts to
bring about a negotiated solution.
The diplomats had little to say afterward, but British Ambassador Sir
Nicholas Henderson indicated that there was no sign of a compromise
over the disputed archipelago, located 400 miles off the Argentine
coast.
Meanwhile, White House spokesman Larry Speakes reiterated Presi
dent Reagan's willingness "to do anything necessary and anything that
both governments would like him to do," to help end the crisis.
Speakes would not elaborate, saying "it's a delicate situation and
that's why we're being very delicate in our public statements — we pre
fer to work in the area of quiet diplomacy."
