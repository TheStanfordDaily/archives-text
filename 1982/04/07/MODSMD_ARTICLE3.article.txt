U.S. stays neutral in Falklands dispute
Washington — Vowing to remain neutral in the confrontation over
the Falkland Islands, the Reagan administration yesterday formally of
fered the good offices of the United States to help avert war between
Great Britain and Argentina.
Secretary of State Alexander Haig met separately yesterday with Brit
ish and Argentine diplomats. Administration officials described Haig's
meetings as an expression of U.S. willingness to help rather than an out
right attempt to mediate the dispute, but informed administration
sources said that the United States was certain to step up its efforts to
bring about a negotiated solution.
The diplomats had little to say afterward, but British Ambassador Sir
Nicholas Henderson indicated that there was no sign of a compromise
over the disputed archipelago, located 400 miles off the Argentine
coast.
Meanwhile, White House spokesman Larry Speakes reiterated Presi
dent Reagan's willingness "to do anything necessary and anything that
both governments would like him to do," to help end the crisis.
Speakes would not elaborate, saying "it's a delicate situation and
that's why we're being very delicate in our public statements — we pre
fer to work in the area of quiet diplomacy."
White House officials said that the administration re
mained in contact with both the British and Argentine gov
ernments, and that the president received a direct com
munication on the situation yesterday afternoon from British
Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher.
However, the White Houso, the Department of State and
the Pentagon skirted questions on two sensitive points: the
1947 Rio Treaty, signed by the United States, in which coun
tries in North and South America (except Canada) agree to
come to each ether's assistance if attacked, and the use of
Ascension Island, owned by the British but leased by the
United States, as a potential staging area for British military
operations in the Falklands.
Argentina misjudged world reaction
Buenos Aires — Argentina miscalculated both British and
world reaction to its armed takeover of the Falkland Islands
and is looking for a way to avoid a military confrontation, dip
lomatic and other sources said yesterday.
Faced with a crumbling economy, street riots earlier in the
week and continuing demands for a return to civilian rule,
Argentine President Gen. Leopoldo Galtieri was said to have
decided to distract national attention by moving last Thurs
day against the Falklands.
However, these sources said, the decision was kept secret
from all but a handful of military officers, thus eliminating
any possible softening advice from Argentine diplomatic
and civilian advisers.
"They (the Argentine leaders) miscalculated U.S.-Argen
tine relations, U.S.-British relations, how the British would
react," said one diplomatic expert.
El Salvador to get civilian govt.
San Salvador — In a break with more than half a century of
history, El Salvador's new government will have a provisional
president, vice president and Cabinet ministers in the Amer
ican pattern rather than a civilian-military junta, politicians
negotiating the arrangement said yesterday.
The five parties that won legislative seats in the elections a
week ago Sunday have agreed on little else in three days of
private talks, during which they have been wrangling over
the structure of the government that will draw up a new con
stitution and move the country toward presidential elections
within the next few years. Who will hold the new posts is still
being debated.
The decision to exclude the armed forces from a formal
role is a major one, reflecting both the civilians' de
termination to move toward a fully democratic system and a
military decision to let them do it. Although U.S. officials are

known to have favored this course, the sources agreed that
military willingness and not U.S. pressure on the civilians was
the main reason for the agreement.
The armed forces will still retain control through the De
partment of Defense over internal security matters and the
continuing warfare against leftist rebels, and they will proba
bly be allowed to choose the defense minister, according to
sources involved in the talks.
But the army will not be sharing formal executive power
with the president, even though no one believes it will break
its interventionist tradition to stand idle if the politicians
prove unable to govern effectively.
World Bank shortfall narrowed
Washington — A large number of the world's rich nations
yesterday re-affirmed the need "in principle" for a strong In
ternational Development Association, the soft-loan lending
agency of the World Bank, according to a spokesman.
At the conclusion of a two-day meeting of the IDA deputy
ministers, precipitated by a short-fall in the American con
tribution, a Bank spokesman said that the institution was
"very satisfied" with the determination of other contributing
nations to try to make up the U.S. deficit.
IDA lends money without interest for a 50-year term. It is
the largest such source of subsidized aid to the poorest na
tions.
The Reagan Administration cut the U.S. contribution from
$1.1 billion to $700 million this year. Under IDA rules, that
would normally trigger pro rata reductions by other con
tributors, slicing the total fiscal 1982 IDA lending program
from $4.1 billion to $2.6 billion.
But several countries agreed yesterday to put in their full
shares regardless of the U.S. cut, narrowing the gap by about
$500 million. Of this total, $120 million will come from Great
Britain as a result of an Whitehall decision announced
earlier.
British economy falters in crisis
London — Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher's govern
ment moved yesterday to increase economic pressure on Ar
gentina to withdraw its forces from the Falkland Islands, as
the ongoing crisis brought the British pound to its lowest
level since 1977.
Two national public opinion polls taken this week showed
that two of every three Britons back Thatcher's strong stance,
even if it requires the use of military force. But a sizable mi
nority also blamed Thatcher for the crisis and thought she
should leave office.
A little more than a week ago, Thatcher was enjoying a rise
in the polls, with inflation falling, economic output finally

showing signs of a future increase and the rise in unemploy
ment slowing.
In an effort to place additional pressure on Argentina to
withdraw its forces from the islands before the arrival of Brit
ish warships, Thatcher announced a total ban on imports of
Argentine goods, and her government formally asked the
other nine European Common Market countries to join in
this and other economic sanctions. Thatcher already had
broken diplomatic relations with Buenos Aires, frozen Ar
gentine assets here and cut off export credits and military
sales to Argentina after last week's invasion.
British diplomats said they expected support from their
Common Market partners. The Netherlands has suspended
military sales to Argentina, and West Germany is considering
whether it should stop delivery of submarines and surface
ships being built there for the Argentine Navy.
Ex-Supreme Court justice dies
Washington — Abe Fortas, the brilliant, high-powered
Washington lawyer who became the only Supreme Court
justice ever to resign under fire, died Monday night of a
heart attack. He was 71.
His death occurred two weeks after he had returned to the
Supreme Court as an attorney to argue a case for the first
time since he stepped down in 1969. It was an old, familiar
role for Fortas, the accomplished appellate advocate who
won for indigent criminal defendants the right to a lawyer in
a celebrated 1963 case.
Fortas was a longtime friend of President Lyndon Johnson,
who appointed Fortas to the Supreme Court in 1965.
In 1969, Fortas was forced to step down from the court
amid the most serious of the conflict-of-interest charges that
were levelled against him on several occasions during his
long career.
Falkland crisis sends gold higher
New York — Gold and silver prices rose sharply again yes
terday in New York amid concerns over the Falkland Islands'
crisis, but U.S. grain prices, which rallied on the turmoil in
the previous session, ended mixed.
On the New York Stock Exchange, prices recovered from
early losses, and the Dow Jones average of 30 industrials
posted a 4.00-point gain to 839.33.
Gold's price in New York climbed $13.70 a troy ounce to
$360.40, bringing its two-day gain to $30.20.
