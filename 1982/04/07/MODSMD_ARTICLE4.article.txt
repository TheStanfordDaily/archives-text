# Students finance media campaign
## 
### Michael Weiss 
A television set in White Plaza
showing continuous clips of past
speeches, notices chalked on
dorm and classroom blackboards
and an array of signs and banners
were all part of a massive publicity
blitz for Campus Crusade for
Christ (CCC) speaker Josh
McDowell launched last quarter.
The campaign is similar to that
used at the hundreds of other uni
versities at which McDowell has
spoken, and"the publicity meth
ods are the result of thousands of
man-hours of experience," said
senior Steve Johnson, who or
ganized the "Josh" lecture series.
Roughly 50 Stanford students,
most of them members of CCC,
have been responsible for provid
ing the $6000 needed to fund the
two night Josh McDowell lecture
series, according to David Horner,
campus director of CCC.
Members of The Navigators, an
other university-affiliated Chris
tian group, the Menlo Park Pres
byterian Church and some com

munity members also con
tributed.
Horner said, "Students came to
gether and said, 'I'm gonna trust
God to allow me to invest X
amount of dollars, and allow him
to pull it off.' " He told of one girl
who wanted to contribute $50 but
did not have the money. She
prayed to God, and the next day
she received a $50 check from an
old lady. "People are willing to
give to something they really be
lieve in," Horner said.
The Menlo Park Presbyterian
Church actually advanced the stu
dents most of the necessary mon
ey, and received pledges of repay
ment from students.
Of the $6000, $2400 went toward
renting Maples Pavilion, $1000
went to pay McDowell, $1500
went toward for the publicity
campaign and the remainder was
allocated toward strengthening
the organizing campaign.
"We called it 'pray money,'"
Horner said.

BEARS FOR JOSH - Two bears
rambled through White Plaza
yesterday, hoping to raise In
terest in Josh McDowell's eve
ning speech at Maples
Pavilion.
The publicity sparked controversy.
One of the publicity posters, which
shows McDowell proposing to his
wife, is captioned "Maximum Sex."
Both Horner and Johnson acknowl
edged that the poster contained
some "subliminal suggestions."
"Maximum Sex is the title of the
talk," said Horner. "We have little
control over the title of the talk."
Johnson added that "the last thing
we want to do is to see this sort of
thing misunderstood."
Some students were bothered by
the publicity slogan which presented
Josh saying, "Hold on. I'm coming."
Senior Karie Brown said, "It almost

seems like it's too much. It makes it
seem like a cult. I'm afraid it's gonna
put off some questioning Chris
tians."
Freshman Jennifer Berenson, an at
tendant in the information booth
which "Josh" publicists had set up in
White Plaza, said, "A lot of people
stop and ask questions. Some people
are really interested. Some are really
offensive."
She told of one man who asked her
what the lecture was about, and who
said "Ha!" and walked off when she
said it was about the intellectual basis
of Christianity.
Horner cited actions such as a flyer
circulating around campus which
portrays Josh as a man who sleeps
with boys and the theft of a Josh ban
ner from White Plaza as evidence of
anti-Josh sentiment.
