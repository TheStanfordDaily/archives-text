### 
A man accused of impersonating a
police officer in order to extort mon
ey ai}d drugs from an estimated 20
University students was arrested by
the Stanford police on Monday and
booked on suspicion of robbery, ex
tortion, burglary and impersonating
a police officer, according to detec
tive Iran White.
Stanford police Captain Raoul
Niemeyer said that John Michael Al
len, 28, was arrested after several vic
tims and witnesses reported him to
the police. Allen was apprehended at
the police station. He went there
"under the pretense of wanting to
'help identify and apprehend the nu
merous student drug dealers on cam
pus'," after he learned that he had
been reported, Niemeyer said.
White said that police confirmed
Allen's identity after he had been
picked out of a line-up by several wit
nesses. Allen was booked at North
County jail in Palo Alto, where he re
mains. According to White, no bail
has yet been determined for Allen.
Allen allegedly robbed three stu
dents of marijuana last Friday eve
ning using a simulated weapon, ac
cording to Niemeyer.
White said one witness heard Allen
demand money from someone last
Sunday under the threat of injury.
Niemeyer said Allen has taken as
much as "a couple of hundred
dollars" from one victim.
So far five students have reported
being victimized by Allen and ac
cording to White, those students
have estimated that Allen has vic
timized at least 20 other students.
White said that the real number of Al
len's victims may be even higher than
that, but that it may be hard to get
many more people to testify against
him because of their fear of prose
cution.
However, Niemeyer said that all
students who have been extorted or
otherwise victimized by Allen are
being offered immunity from prose
cution.
"Obviously we're not going to
prosecute anyone who's willing to
testify against him,"he added.
Niemeyer said Allen infiltrated
campus living groups, in order to

seek out students who smoked mari
juana. After gaining their trust he said
that Allen claimed to be a policeman
to extort from them"drugs, money
and anything he could convert to
cash."
One student, who asked to remain
anonymous but who will be referred
to here as Smith, told the Daily he
had met Allen in September when Al
len asked him if he wanted to get
high. Since then Smith had become
friends with Allen and he had period
ically come over to Smith's resi
dence, one of the fraternities, in or
der to purchase, take and sell drugs.
"He asked a few of us if we wanted
to deal cocaine,"said another resi
dent (here called Jones) of the same
fraternity, who also requested
anonymity. Eventually, Jones said
that Allen stopped asking him if he
wanted to sell drugs, although he
continued to drop by the fraternity.
Last week both Smith and Jones
confirmed that Allen had stolen
drugs from Smith.
On Saturday, Jones said he met Al
len at Tresidder and Allen told him
that he was a special University po
liceman paid to gather drug samples
from around campus in order to test
those samples for impurities in a lab
ratory.
In addition Jones said,"he gave me
a sermon about how bad drugs are
and he said that he only used them so
he could infiltrate the drug users."
On that day Allen accompanied
Jones back to the house where he
met Smith."l told him to get out of
here because he had stolen some
drugs from me," Smith said.
Allen repeated the same story
about working for the University as a
policeman and warned the students
that their parents would be upset if
they found out that they were using
drugs. He also told them he was a
Green Beret who had fought in Viet
nam.
"He played up to every possible
fear," Smith said."lt's scary to think
that he had this thing all planned
out,"he added.
White said formal charges will be
filed tomorrow against Allen by the
district attorney's office.
