# Science, Technology and Society degree created
## New undergraduate major approved 
### Felicia Lee 
A new undergraduate major in Science, Tech
nology and Society, to be offered by the Program
in Values, Technology and Society (VTS) was unan
imously approved by the Committee on Individ
ually Designed Majors.
According to Robert McGinn, adjunct prof, and
head of VTS, several students have already ex
pressed interest in the new major, created last
month, and about a dozen students have designed
individual majors centered around the VTS pro
gram during the past seven years. Increased in
terest in VTS-related degrees in recent months
prompted the move for the Science, Technology
and Society (STS)major.
Calling it a "new liberal arts education,"
McGinn emphasized that the program is means to
"appeal to all types of students" regardless of their
academic inclinations. He called the VTS Western
Culture sequences an example of the philosophy
behind the program, stating that it is taught by fac

uity from fields as diverse as religious studies and
electrical engineering.
Students pursuing majors in STS may receive
either a B.A. or a B.S. degree depending on their
individual interest. The STS degree program, much
like those of feminist studies and human biology,
will be conducted by faculty members from vari
ous departments working under the auspices of
the VTS program.
McGinn said he hoped the new program would
"open some lines of real communication" be
tween the sciences and the humanities, which
have traditionally been divorced from each other
in the academic world. "Frankly, I don't see that
much of a contradiction between the two fields,"
he said.
Students in the Western Cultures sequences had
mixed views about the STS major. While many ex
pressed interest in the subject matter of the degree
program, some worried that it would be con
sidered a "mick major" or "non-applicable" to ca

reer goals.
"Why are they offering a VTS major when they
don't even have astronomy, computer science or
biochemistry?" asked one freshman. A sentiment
common to many students concerning not only
the STS major but humanities-related studies in
general was summed up by freshman Kris Solem:
"I don't know what you'd do with it."
McGinn defended the applicability of the pro
gram, saying that many traditionally non-technical
professions, such as law, are directly affected by
technology and science. Conversely, scientists
need a sense of "social responsibility." "Engineers,
when working with numbers alone, often get an
artificial view of science in the real world," he said.
McGinn definitely sees the STS major as both ap
plicable and relevant to the goals of Stanford's ca
reer-minded students. "What I think it offers is a
nice combination of courses which provide
philosophical, social and ethical perspectives on
technology."
