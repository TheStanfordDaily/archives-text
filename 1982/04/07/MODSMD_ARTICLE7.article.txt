# Josh offers 'proof of resurrection
## 
### Karen Springen 
More than 2500 students and
area residents flocked to Maples
Pavillion last night to hear Josh
McDowell, Campus Crusade for
Christ's widely-publicized guest
speaker, address "The Great Res
urrection Hoax."
McDowell, whose arrival
banners, advertisements and
blackboard notes heralded for
weeks, called the resurrection
"either the greatest farce or the
greatest fact" in history. He con
cluded that it is, indeed, the
greatest fact.
McDowell, a polished speaker
who claims to have spoken at
more than 600 universities and in
more than 60 countries, laced his
lecture with one-liners as he re
peatedly emphasized the folly of
proving the resurrection of Jesus
Christ a hoax — a task which he
claimed has led many non
believers to refute their skep
ticism and adopt Christianity.
"You can't give Cod a snowjob
— especially in Palo Alto," he
quipped.
McDowell claimed that he
himself was not a religious man
and emphasized the role of Christ,
rather than religion, in his life.

"Do you have a religion or a rela
tionship?" he asked the primarily
student audience.
He cited the need for individual
courage and conviction. A belief
in Christ requires a personal de-

cision, he said. "I admire men and
women who know why they be
lieve what they believe."
Skeptics must refute the resur
rection to refute Christianity,
McDowell said. He proceeded to
cite what he claimed was proof of
the resurrection. McDowell's evi
dence included the 120-pound
cement-like encasement of Jesus'
body; the two-ton stone in front

of his tomb; the Roman seal; and
the guardians placed at the tomb,
which McDowell compared to the
Green Berets.
"Something must have hap
pened," he said.
McDowell described becoming
a Christian as "an ego-shattering
experience." He said being a
Christian requires the exercising
of will rather than merely physi
cally entering a church.
"Every time I come to a univer
sity, I'm so glad I'm not a student,"
he said. He described his univer
sity experience as a disappoint
ment since professors taught "not
how to live" but "how to make a
better living."
Before his conversion in 1959 —
prompted in part, he said, by the
influence of a "really cute" stu
dent with whom he was associated
who was a Christian — McDowell
said he "had thought all Christians
were ugly. I figured if you couldn't
make it anywhere else, you be
came a Christian."
After the presentation, Campus
Crusade members collected au
dience comment cards and asked
students to provide their ad
dresses.
