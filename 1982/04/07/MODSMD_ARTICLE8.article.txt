## Falklands analysis Britain has military edge 
### Washington Post 
Washington — Argentina
and Britain are going into a mil
itary confrontation over the
Falkland Islands like two
blindfolded boxers, U.S. naval
experts said Monday.
Argentina has the advantage
— in boxing terms — of the
longer reach, they agreed,
while Britain stands the best
chance of shaking off its
blindfold and landing lethal
punches, given enough time.
Argentina's longer reach
comes mainly from American
built A-4 Skyhawk fighter
bombers that can take 3000
pounds of bombs 700 miles and
return to either the nation's
single aircraft carrier or an air
field.
Although the two British air
craft carriers being sent to the
Falklands — the Invincible and
'.he Hermes — are carrying the
more modern Harrier jump
jets, those planes have a com
bat radius of only about 100
miles when loaded with
bombs. So the single Argentine
carrier, The 25th of May, could
stay out of bombing range of
the Harriers while launching
A-4 Skyhawks against British
ships.
This longer reach provided
by the A-4s would be doubly
advantageous if the Argentine
military equips the airfield at
Stanley, East Falkland, to han
dle attack planes. The A-4s
then could attack the British
flotilla from the sea, the
Falklands and perhaps even the
Argentine mainland, depend
ing on how close the ships
come to land.
The Argentine navy has 14

A-4 Skyhawks aboard its carrier
and an additional 68 on land
under air force control. The Ar
gentine air force also is be
lieved to have nine Canberra
bombers and 21 Mirage 111
fighters for aerial dogfighting.
If the Argentine planes man
aged to sink or disable the Brit
ish carriers, it would be all over
for the Royal Navy as far as re
versing the Falklands takeover,
U.S. Navy experts agreed. But
the British are more ex
perienced than the Argentines
at hiding their ships from
hunter aircraft, the experts
hastily added.
"The real key is experience,"
said one of the U.S. Navy's most
respected sea dogs, retired
Adm. I. "Ike" Kidd, former
commander of the Atlantic
Fleet who retired in 1978 after a
long acquaintance with British
and Argentine naval leaders.
"You've got to find what you're
looking for; you've got to get
those eyes out in front because
it isn't easy to find ships on the
ocean. The question becomes,
what does each side have to
find the other?"
Here, the experts said, the
advantage swings to the British,
especially if they do the ex
pected and fly their equivalent
of the American down-look
ing, radar-hunting plane, the
AWACS, to their South Atlantic
Ascension Island. From
Ascension, the British long
range hunter plane, the
Nimrod, could help guard the
British task force and perhaps
find Argentine ships and sub
marines.
Kidd acknowledged that the
British would be trying to oper

ate at the end of a 8000-mile
long umbilical cord — the dis
tance between the United
Kingdom and the Falklands —
and that operating from
Ascension only cuts that dis
tance in half. Those distances
impose on the British the same
kind of stresses and strains the
United States faces in trying to
bring force to bear in the Per
sian Gulf.
"You have to travel so far
from the locker room to the
playing field that you're ex
hausted when you get there,"
Kidd said, "while the other fel
low's locker room is right un
der the stadium."
Even so, he said, "on the
basis of operational ex
perience, the British navy is in a
different category" from the
Argentine navy. But he said the
risks for both navies are so high
if they go to war that if he were
involved "I'd be praying for a
breakthrough in diplomacy."
Although the Argentine
navy has some anti-submarine
warfare capability, the British
have the better eyes and ears
here, too, as well as more so
phisticated equipmentforfind
ing surface ships.
Retired Adm. ElmoZumwalt,
chief of naval operations from
1970 to 1974, said British Prime
Minister Margaret Thatcher
risks "a debacle" if she opts for
war. He put the odds of the
British winning at 55 to 45 in
their favor, primarily because
the experience and cunning of
British navy commanders
should offset the Argentine ad
vantages of being close to
home and having land-based
warplanes.

"You have to travel so far
from the locker room to the
playing field that you're ex
hausted when you get there,"
Kidd said, "while the other fel
low's locker room is right un
der the stadium."
Even so, he said, "on the
basis of operational ex
perience, the British navy is in a
different category" from the
Argentine navy. But he said the
risks for both navies are so high
if they go to war that if he were
involved "I'd be praying for a
breakthrough in diplomacy."
Although the Argentine
navy has some anti-submarine
warfare capability, the British
have the better eyes and ears
here, too, as well as more so
phisticated equipmentforfind
ing surface ships.
Retired Adm. ElmoZumwalt,
chief of naval operations from
1970 to 1974, said British Prime
Minister Margaret Thatcher
risks "a debacle" if she opts for
war. He put the odds of the
British winning at 55 to 45 in
their favor, primarily because
the experience and cunning of
British navy commanders
should offset the Argentine ad
vantages of being close to
home and having land-based
warplanes.
Washington — Argentina
and Britain are going into a mil
itary confrontation over the
Falkland Islands like two
blindfolded boxers, U.S. naval
experts said Monday.
Argentina has the advantage
— in boxing terms — of the
longer reach, they agreed,
while Britain stands the best
chance of shaking off its
blindfold and landing lethal
punches, given enough time.
Argentina's longer reach
comes mainly from American
built A-4 Skyhawk fighter
bombers that can take 3000
pounds of bombs 700 miles and
return to either the nation's
single aircraft carrier or an air
field.
Although the two British air
craft carriers being sent to the
Falklands — the Invincible and
'.he Hermes — are carrying the
more modern Harrier jump
jets, those planes have a com
bat radius of only about 100
miles when loaded with
bombs. So the single Argentine
carrier, The 25th of May, could
stay out of bombing range of
the Harriers while launching
A-4 Skyhawks against British
ships.
This longer reach provided
by the A-4s would be doubly
advantageous if the Argentine
military equips the airfield at
Stanley, East Falkland, to han
dle attack planes. The A-4s
then could attack the British
flotilla from the sea, the
Falklands and perhaps even the
Argentine mainland, depend
ing on how close the ships
come to land.
The Argentine navy has 14

A-4 Skyhawks aboard its carrier
and an additional 68 on land
under air force control. The Ar
gentine air force also is be
lieved to have nine Canberra
bombers and 21 Mirage 111
fighters for aerial dogfighting.
If the Argentine planes man
aged to sink or disable the Brit
ish carriers, it would be all over
for the Royal Navy as far as re
versing the Falklands takeover,
U.S. Navy experts agreed. But
the British are more ex
perienced than the Argentines
at hiding their ships from
hunter aircraft, the experts
hastily added.
"The real key is experience,"
said one of the U.S. Navy's most
respected sea dogs, retired
Adm. I. "Ike" Kidd, former
commander of the Atlantic
Fleet who retired in 1978 after a
long acquaintance with British
and Argentine naval leaders.
"You've got to find what you're
looking for; you've got to get
those eyes out in front because
it isn't easy to find ships on the
ocean. The question becomes,
what does each side have to
find the other?"
Here, the experts said, the
advantage swings to the British,
especially if they do the ex
pected and fly their equivalent
of the American down-look
ing, radar-hunting plane, the
AWACS, to their South Atlantic
Ascension Island. From
Ascension, the British long
range hunter plane, the
Nimrod, could help guard the
British task force and perhaps
find Argentine ships and sub
marines.
Kidd acknowledged that the
British would be trying to oper

ate at the end of a 8000-mile
long umbilical cord — the dis
tance between the United
Kingdom and the Falklands —
and that operating from
Ascension only cuts that dis
tance in half. Those distances
impose on the British the same
kind of stresses and strains the
United States faces in trying to
bring force to bear in the Per
sian Gulf.
"You have to travel so far
from the locker room to the
playing field that you're ex
hausted when you get there,"
Kidd said, "while the other fel
low's locker room is right un
der the stadium."
