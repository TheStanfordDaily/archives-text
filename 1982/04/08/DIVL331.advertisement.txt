GRADUATING SOON?
TIME TO THINK ABOUT PEACE CORPS
Time to think about what two years of service overseas as a Peace Corps
Volunteer can mean in terms of your career direction and development, and
in terms of your development as a person.
Being a Peace Corps Volunteer means sharing what you know with others,
while immersing yourself in another life, another language, another culture.
You'll join the 5,000 Volunteers and trainees now in more than 60 developing fIHMHHHfIH
nations in Latin America, Africa, Asia and the Pacific. They are working in a \ J®
wide variety of programs — and somewhere on the shopping list of skills
perfectly. Or. if one we can for worry if you it |
"only" a liberal arts degree!).
You'll travel, language and cross-cultural training, health care, a living SjK
allowance and a check for about $4,700 at the end of your service to help
during your readjustment period.

But you'll also get the reward of having stretched yourself to your full 111
potential, and of having brought a message of hope and change to people jjigi
who may have never before had clean drinking water, basic health care, or
enough to eat.
