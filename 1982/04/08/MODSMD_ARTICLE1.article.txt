# Key records change planned
## 
### Heather Millar Senior staff writer 
In an effort to avoid record mix
ups with keys, the Office of Residen
tial Education and the Conference
Office will standardize and upgrade
key records, Elizabeth Hiyama, direc
tor of administration in Res Ed, said
yesterday.
Because work orders for keys and
other key records have not been kept
in a unified format, master key losses,
re-keying or lock change delays and
a glut of room keys in dorm offices
can result, as the Daily discovered in
an investigation of University key
policy a month ago. The Daily also
found that the change-over in many
dorms from Res Ed to summer con
ference administration each June can
also contribute to the confusion.
Hiyama said the records are there
but whether they are in the Con
ference Office or in the dorm office
is hard to determine. "We want to
standardize it so everyone can know
what's going on in the various com
plexes."
Hiyama said that while she feels
complete records have always been
kept, a log book system will be estab

lished which will enable an adminis
trator or dorm employee to be able
to determine at a glance how many
keys have been ordered, who or
dered them and how many have
been returned. The installation of a
new computer bystem in the Resi
dent Manager's Office a few months
ago will also put recent key records at
administrator's fingertips, Hiyama
said.
Such efficiency has not always
been the case, the Daily found dur
ing its investigation. Four master
keys, whose requisition and loss rec
ords could not be found, mys
teriously turned up in the Crothers
Hall trash last summer. The Stern Hall
office key board is crowded with ex
tra room keys, according to Vicky
Baker, who has been the dorm secre
tary for both residence halls.
Jan Van Houten, resident fellow
for Manzanita Park acknowledged
the rumor that as many as 24 keys re
main unaccounted for in the trailer
park. Although Stanford Police Chief
Marvin Herrington said it is next to
impossible to trace specific crimes to
such incidents, he said the Police pe
riodically find unaccounted-for keys

in the hands of unauthorized per
sons.
Van Houten said that Crothers Me
morial still hasn't been re-keyed, al
though the request for a re-key, pre
cipitated by the loss of several master
keys, was filed months ago. Terry Mc-
Govern, housing facilities manager,
blamed the lack of materials for the
delay. As soon as the key cylinders ar
rive, McCovern said that Cro Mem
will be changed.
Conference Office policy, which
dictates that summer conferees do
not have to pay lost key fees, is not
expected to change, according to
Van Houten. However, some have
cited this policy as a "double stan
dard" because students are charged
$34 if they lose a key.
The University has not pursued the
issue of key duplication, even though
the Daily was able to get two Stanford
room keys copied after covering the
"DO NOT DUPLICATE" stamp with
tape. Neither the A-A Lock Shop in
Menlo Park nor the University Ave
nue Woolworth's store manager was
contacted by the University and both
were unaware that their stores had
duplicated a Stanford key.
