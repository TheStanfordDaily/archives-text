# Zimbabwe's blacks hold on

Salisbury, Zimbabwe — Two years after
Rhodesia became Zimbabwe and blacks took
over the government, the country is relatively
•prosperous, its blacks are tolerant of the whites
who formerly oppressed them, and many whites
are mildly hopeful about the future.
Prime Minister Robert Mugabe is credited
with having achieved all this, but there are still
some troubling points.
While there has been considerable reconcil
iation of the races, after a seven-year war that
cost 27,000 lives, there are still occasionally ugly
incidents.
Also, Mugabe has introduced a form of social
ism aimed at rapidly raising the standards of liv
ing for the 7 million blacks, and that means low
ering the life style of the 190,000 whites still here.
About 20,000 whites left last year, 19 percent
more than in the first year of Mugabe's govern
ment.
While grappling with those problems, the 57-
year-old former guerrilla leader has closed in on
another of his objectives: one-party rule. At
present, there are two major black political
parties, a significnt white party and a handful of
other black and white groups, all seeking a
stronger voice in running the country.
Mugabe has consolidated his power just re
cently. After the discovery of large caches of

weapons on farms owned by followers of his No.
1 political rival, Joshua Nkomo, Mugabe dis
missed Nokomo and several of his supporters
from the Cabinet. Mugabe also imprisoned
Nkomo's military chiefs, accusing them of com
plicity in a planned uprising.
That apparently ended the never-comfortable
political coalition between the wartime allies.
Nkomo, the older of the two and the founder of
the black nationalist movement here, had been
a junior partner since Mugabe became prime
minister.
Mugabe has afco brought to trial four whites,
one of whom is a member of Parliament, on
charges of planning a campaign of terror against
the black government.
The arrest of the whites, and their asserted ill
treatment during pretrial detention, caused an
outcry in Parliament from lan Smith, the last
white prime minister and head of the major
white political party.
Smith denounced the Mugabe leadership and
touched off antagonistic oratory from members
of Mugabe's 57-seat majority in Parliament. The
exchange, prominently reported in the govern
ment-owned newspapers and on radio and tele
vision, disturbed racial harmony throughout the
nation. Mugabe warned that he might have to
take action against "still racist-minded" whites.
