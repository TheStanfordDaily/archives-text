## The 						waiting game Letters can determine futures for seniors 
### Jennifer Seymour 
Last year, approximately
945 of 1680 students regis
tered at the Career Planning
and Placement Center
(CPPC), found full-time em
ployment, accounting for
nearly 7800 Interviews with
graduate schools, the gov
ernment or private busi
nesses.
These figures highlight
one aspect of the interview
and application process all
graduating student must
confront —the possibility of
rejection.
"I'd say the feelings in
volved in the job rejec
tion/acceptance process
parallel those of a personal
relationship. A sense of re
jection is a personal one and
about the only cure Is ac
ceptance." says professor of
psychology Lee Ross.
The Interview is the crux
of the whole process, or at
least the topic of greatest
discussion amongst gradu
ating students. But when ap
plying for competitive law
schools, where no In
terviews are granted, the
application process be
comes equally emotional.
"It'd be great if you could
be on a desert island when
applying,"says one senior
applying to law schools .
"Then no one would ever
have to know your scores or
where you got in and you
wouldn't have to hear about
theirs.
"Some people really feel
put upon by the pressures of
competing with those
around them. It's because
rejection Is always a very
personally felt thing. Unless
it's from a place like New
Haven, where no one would
want to live anyway."
Interviews present a com
bination of tense and com
ical situations. "The first In
terviews are pretty nerve
racking," said one medical
school-bound senior."But
then they get easy. They all
begin to sound alike and
some are even fun. In fact,
they'd just be a big game If It
wasn't your life they were
playing with."
This notion of play re
curred in Interviews, some
times In Intense ways: "Pe
troleum Engineers' In
terviews are Durely small
talk,very low-key, because

you're applying for desk
and field work, rather than
people things like in busi
ness, but I've heard friends
describe situations where
they'll be asked to open a
window and It'll be nailed
shut. Or the interviewer will
suddenly slide a glass of wa
ter towards them. It's all just
to test you, to play with
you," recounts Randy
Breitenbach, a senior who
will get his master's degree
in petroleum engineering
here next year.
For Breitenback, the re
jection role was reversed
when an oil company in
terviewer offered him a
starting salary near $30,000
for next year, which he
turned down."! had applied
for a summer job, but I
guess the guy hadn't no
ticed that or something. We
were talking and he all of a
sudden asks me how much I
had been making last sum
mer. I told him. 'Think
about doubling that' he
says. I figured it out and def
initely thought about it."
Brightenbach opted for a
master's, "purely for rea
sons of self satisfaction; the
money will not be much dif
ferent with a master's but I
don't want to come back to
school to get it once I leave
and get settled In a house, a
job and all."
Roles are also sometimes
reversed when the in
terviewers take things more
seriously than the In
terviewee. Says electrical
engineer Veena Bhatia,"l
got this one call back for a
plant tour and interview
from a company which flew
me down to L.A., rented me
a car — the deluxe treat
ment. I got to the place
where we were told we'd be
interviewing, and the com
pany tells us that recent
work on a very hush-hush
government contract ne
cessitating moving the en
tire plant operation every
three weeks so no one
could find them. I felt like I
was in a james Bond movie,
driving to the new, hidden
plant.. .at the end of the in
terview they asked us for
some local references; a
week later they had FBI
agents out at my friends'
houses, asking questions
about me. It was a cool corn

pany, but you couldn't help
laughing at the whole
thing."
Another engineer, feel
ing feverish and not In
terested in the Interview she
faced that moment, was
suddenly asked what she'd
be doing in five years if she
were working for the com
pany. "I'll probably be vice
president/' she responded
cooly. She got a call back the
next week.
Other interviews Involve
more than one interviewer.
"I remember one Interview,
a round two that was con
ducted by phone," recounts
senior Terri Miller, an eco
nomics major. "There were
five people on the other
end of the phone, passing it
around and asking me some
really intense questions. It
was really unnerving. Things
like, 'Why do I feel I'm a
quality person?' I nearly
freaked."(Terri ultimately
accepted a job with the
company, as sales manager
and group manager for the
Northeastern region, head
quartered in New York).
Part of the fear involved in
interviewing relates to the
weighting it receives in
many cases, especially in
medical schools. "An ap
plication will get you tp the
interview," says one med
school applicant, "but after
that, it's all the interview.
Some interviewers are ac
tually composing their essay
to the board of admissions
as you speak, to the point
where they'll ask you 'How
should I put this? Like this or
like that?' It's definitely a lit
tle unnerving."
Despite this emphasis on
interviews, many feel they
are not a good way to ex
change with someone.
"The interview situation
should have least weight put
on it,"says Lee. "There is
very little evidence to sup
port the notion that in
terviews are valid diagnostic
tools, while there is much
evidence against the fact.
It's a terrible way to judge a
person, because the eval
uation is made on how well
he or she acts to impress
you."
Those denied a chance to
interview feel differently,
however: "It's really frus
trating to have to depend on

a slip of paper. Law schools
are very into statistics and
you get no interviews.
When you think you'd make
a great lawyer but you only
have a piece of paper and
some numbers to speak for
you, its very impersonal,
very frustrating," says Robin
Harris, who completed her
master's degree as a senior
and is now applying to law
schools in California.
Law schools are also con
sidered unpredictable
about informing their appli
cants, in comparison to job
interviewers. Says Harris,
"I'd go to the P.O. box every
day with much trepidation,
sometimes twice a day. I'm
still waiting to hear from
four schools."
"You dream of little white
envelopes, thin ones, all the
time. It's terrible," said an
other senior, currently on

hold at Stanford Law, her
first choice/'Being on hold
is also terrible. You feel like
your whole life is on hold."
This anxiety is partly re
lated to the competitive na
ture of law school com
pared to med school, or
other graduate school pro
gram, according to some
seniors."Law school is dif
ferent than applying to
medical school, in that it
doesn't really matter where
you go to medical school so
long as you end up a compe
tent physician. Law schools
are so variable in quality
though, that it does make a
difference where you go."
noted one senior.
Others say it is Stanford
that makes law school so
competitive. "At Stanford,
the applications are uni
formly so high quality that
it's hard to make yourself

distinguished," says Harris.
"There's definitely a com
petitive element in applying
to any grad school, but it
also brings you much closer
to your friends. You're so
much in it together, doing
the applications, sharing the
news and hoping for your
friends. You really do get
psyched if someone you
know gets into a hot law
school."
The camaraderie takes
different forms in other situ
ations, however: in Roble
dorms the walls of the sec
ond floor at Roble are grad
ually being wallpapered in
rejection letters as they
come in. On each a red or
blue pen underscores the
sentence they all share:"
And we wish you success in
your future." "Misery loves
company," commented
one contributing member

of the dorm.
"It shows how impersonal
some of these letters
get,"said another. "Stan
ford makes a real effort to
be as personal as possible.
I'm sure their rejection let
ter from law school would
be personal; I hope I don't
find out. But other places
send you a mimeographed
letter with your name typed
in about four spaces away
from the 'Dear'."
Competition,
camaraderie, interviewing
or just deciding — the grad
uating student is faced with
different obstacles and
fears. And of course, some
see graduating as "just an
other step, not a big deal."
But all seem to agree on one
thing; regardless of the fears
and choices, they are ready
and anxious to meet their
future.
