## The 						Top: out of arms'reach 
### 
I'll have to admit I was confused,
befuddled, mixed-up, addlebrained,
mind-boggled and just plain out of it.
There was only one thing I could do:
take my problem straight to the top.
"Say, Ron, this is Andy Bennett of
The Stanford Daily and I was wonder
ing ... yes, I'm sorry about the article
about Nancy ... poor taste, now
Ron, about this nuclear arms freeze
thing, I just don't understand the dif
ference between the Kennedy-Hat
field freeze proposal and the jack
son-Warner proposal that you sup
port."
"I see. So the Kennedy freeze calls
for an immediate halt to the arms
race while yours calls for a halt to the
race after we've caught up with the
Russians. Say, that's some kind of
freeze you've got there — I can sure
see the advantages of a freeze that
lets us build all the arms we want
while the Russians don't build any.
Just one thing, Ron, how do we know
the Russians will hold up their side?
You know those crafty Russians,
they'd probably say we were trying to
get ahead of them and then build
more arms of their own."
"So that's it. The Russians can't af
ford to keep up with us in the arms
race since it would drain all the re
sources from their economy and
wreak havoc on their entire econom
ic system. Boy, it's a good thing our
economy is in such good shape that
we can sustain a $1.6 billion defense
buildup. Listen, Ron, I was wonder
ing about what you said about the
Russian's 'definite margin of superi
ority' in nuclear weapons. I thought
we had more warheads than they did

and far more and better submarine
launched warheads?
"I see. So you mean their warheads
are bigger and that means they could
theoretically destroy us 38 times over
while we could only wipe them out
37 times over. I imagine those bigger
warheads leave bigger holes, too — a
guy could really get hurt falling into
one of those craters. Another thing I
don't understand is this "window of

vulnerability." You said the Russians
could launch a first strike on the
United States with half its missiles and
then deter the United States from re
taliating by threatening us with the
rest of their missiles, but aren't we in
an even better position to do the ex
act same thing to them since we have
more warheads and more and better
invulnerable submarine-launched
warheads?"

"I see. They're globally ex
pansionists warmongering com
munists and we're nice guys who
would never do such a thing. I guess
sometimes nice guys have to act like
bad guys so they can beat them at
their own game. Speaking of which,
it seems that the Russians are upset
that we want to put Pershing II mis
siles in Europe since they would only
take five minutes to reach the USSR. I
seem to recall that Brezhnev said the
USSR might be forced to put the
United States in an analogous posi
tion, which seems to be a threat to in
stall missiles in Cuba. Is it possible
that your attempt to reach equality
might be interpreted as a move for
superiority and might lead to another
Cuban missile crisis?"
"Uh huh .. . don't want to discuss
your options in advance ... Com
munist propaganda. I guess it would
be pretty silly of the Russians to hon
estly consider our deployment of the
Pershing II and development of the
MX, Trident subs, B-1 and stealth
bomber to be an increase in the arms
race instead of an attempt to catch up
with them. Just one more thing both
ers me, Ron, you've said that there
are only losers in a nuclear war and a
lot of experts think attempts to im
prove civil defense are futile in view
of the destructive capabilities of nu
clear weapons. In light of these facts,
how do you justify your recent at
tempts to spend massive amounts on
civil defense?"
"No winners but some lose more
than others? I suppose that makes
sense. I guess that's all I need to
know. Give my regards to Nancy and
the gang."
Like I said, sometimes you have to
take things straight to the top. Other
wise, you'll just stay confused.

I'll have to admit I was confused,
befuddled, mixed-up, addlebrained,
mind-boggled and just plain out of it.
There was only one thing I could do:
take my problem straight to the top.
"Say, Ron, this is Andy Bennett of
The Stanford Daily and I was wonder
ing ... yes, I'm sorry about the article
about Nancy ... poor taste, now
Ron, about this nuclear arms freeze
thing, I just don't understand the dif
ference between the Kennedy-Hat
field freeze proposal and the jack
son-Warner proposal that you sup
port."
"I see. So the Kennedy freeze calls
for an immediate halt to the arms
race while yours calls for a halt to the
race after we've caught up with the
Russians. Say, that's some kind of
freeze you've got there — I can sure
see the advantages of a freeze that
lets us build all the arms we want
while the Russians don't build any.
Just one thing, Ron, how do we know
the Russians will hold up their side?
You know those crafty Russians,
they'd probably say we were trying to
get ahead of them and then build
more arms of their own."
"So that's it. The Russians can't af
ford to keep up with us in the arms
race since it would drain all the re
sources from their economy and
wreak havoc on their entire econom
ic system. Boy, it's a good thing our
economy is in such good shape that
we can sustain a $1.6 billion defense
buildup. Listen, Ron, I was wonder
ing about what you said about the
Russian's 'definite margin of superi
ority' in nuclear weapons. I thought
we had more warheads than they did

and far more and better submarine
launched warheads?
"I see. So you mean their warheads
are bigger and that means they could
theoretically destroy us 38 times over
while we could only wipe them out
37 times over. I imagine those bigger
warheads leave bigger holes, too — a
guy could really get hurt falling into
one of those craters. Another thing I
don't understand is this "window of

I see. So the
Kennedy freeze calls
for an immediate
halt to the arms race
while yours calls for
a halt to race after
we've caught up
with the Russians.

of freeze you've got
there — I can sure
