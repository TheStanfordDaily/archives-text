## Turning off the Soviet taps 
### 
Washington — "Attention aca
demics: Change all locks on college
laboratory doors and don't let visit
ing commie professors out of your
sight!"
While Administrator Bobby In
man, deputy director of the CIA,
stopped short of such specific advice
to academic scientists at the end of
March, universities may have to con
form to such government-imposed
constraints in the future if they want
to host visiting Soviet scientists.
In an effort to reduce the flow of
information — technical or other
wise — to the East, the State Depart
ment and the intelligence communi
ty have recently been engaged in a
bizarre campaign to monitor and re
strict the activities of visiting Soviet
scholars. Not surprisingly, State has
offered no firm evidence that such
visitations have caused irreparable
harm to U.S. interests.
Last week, the most recent tussle
between "national security" and
"academic freedom" climaxed when
the State Department cancelled, as
too risky, the visit of a Soviet robotics
expert, Nlckolai Umnov, to four uni
versities. The decision came three
months after Stanford, Ohio State
and the University of Wisconsin re
fused to conform to State Depart
ment guidelines for Umnov's tour.
The restrictions — which would
have limited Umnov to the study of
"mechanical theory of robotic
locomotion" and denied him access
to any Pentagon research projects on
campuses (classified or not) — repre
sented, according to Ohio State's
Edwin Crawford, "a total break from
the pattern by which research has im
proved and progressed throughout
the years."
"It's simply inappropriate for a uni
versity such as ours to police Soviet

scientists," added Camden Coberly,
associate dean of the University of
Wisconsin's College of Engineering.
Coberly told our reporter John Ric
cardi that "not only do we lack the fa
cility to do so, but everything we do
here is open to the public, anyway."
Though the State Department
eventually eased its restrictions for
Umnov's tour — and then cancelled
the trip entirely — Uncle Sam's diplo
matic posturing is unnecessary and
misguided.
To begin with, a Sovit* walking
machines" expert has been in resi
dence at Stanford since September,
with the full knowlege of the State
Department. Umnov, meanwhile, "is
not a big player in the world of robot
ics," according to Stanford engineer
ing professor Bernard Roth. Visiting
Russians, he noted, are "more in
terested in sitting around the pool
ogling women than in stealing in
formation. Everything we have is al
ready well-known to them."
With Umnov's visit scrubbed, it
seems safe to say that the Russian was
unfairly singled out as "the heavy" in
the administration's "technology
transfer" morality play.
What's unfortunate, however, is
that the intelligence community
doesn't see that it stands to gain —
not lose — from the U.S.-Soviet
scholar exchange programs. At the
very least, exchanges offer a chance
to observe Soviet scientists and their
capabilities under the controlled set
ting of an American university.
It would be tragic, moreover, if a
rash reponse to characters such as
Umnov earns us a reciprocal snub. "If
you turn off the faucet over here,
there's no way you can expect it to be
kept open over there," said Edwin
Crawford.
If the Russians close their portals to

American social and political scien
tists, our dangerously primitive level
of understanding of Soviet foreign
policy decisions will only decline
further. A February report by the
well-respected International Re
search and Exchanges Board (IREX) in
New York, which sponsors many
U.S.-Soviet exchanges, notes that the
Soviets have three times as many spe
cialists studying U.S. foreign policy as
vice versa.
Robert Levgold, Soviet specialist
with the Council on Foreign Rela
tions, recently painted a grim picture
for The New York Times: "We have
no study of the evolution of Soviet
policy toward SALT since the process
began 12 years ago; no major study of
the Sino-Soviet conflict since the late
19605; no significant study of Soviet
policy in Africa in the 1970'5; and,
most amazingly, no even moderately
ambitious study of Soviet policy
toward the U.S. over the last dec
ade."
Toying with academic exchange
programs — and ignoring the value
of subtle social, economic and cul
tural variables in Soviet life — can
only further enslave American in a
cold-war mentality. Such behavior
only supports mountinginternational
criticism of a narrow American world
view.
Should the intelligence communi
ty really want to crack down on tech
nology transfers to the Soviets, it
might consider placing restrictions
on former employees who've recent
ly been transporting valuable in
formation to Eastern-bloc nations.
Picking on professors isn't the an
swer.
