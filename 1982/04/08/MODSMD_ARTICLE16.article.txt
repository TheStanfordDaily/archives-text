# Commentary/Steve Mitchel
## On where to put your best foot... 
### 
I don't have a summer job. Don't
get me wrong; I'm not ashamed of it.
Nine percent of the people in this
country are unemployed, and come
June, I'll be proud to join them.
Besides, who needs a summer job
anyway. I've better things to do with
my time. I can watch "Joanie Loves
Chachi" on TV. Or I can play with my
collection of pressed leaves. Or I can
go down to the dock and watch them
unload things. I've got plenty of
things to do.
I'm iust a little frustrated. I mean, I
go to Stanford. Getting a job should
be easy. Besides, I di # d everything
right. I wrote a terrific resume. Of
course, I didn't have a lot of work ex
perience, so I had to make most of
that up. But I think I came out sound
ing like a really well-rounded quali
fied guy.
"Previous experience: 1979 —
knocked out Larry Holmes to be
come the heavyweight champion of
the world; 1980 — received the
Nobel Prize for chemistry; 1981 — pi
lotted the U.S. space shuttle "Colum
bia" in its maiden voyage; 1982 —
scored 18,000 pointsin PAC-MAN."
Of course, for a resume, ap
pearance can be just as Important as
content. I realize that people usually
have their resumes typeset and
printed on nice looking paper. I
didn't want my resume to look like
everybody's else's. I wanted mine to
stand out. So, I had my resume
carved out in stone. In fact, it came
out looking just like the Ten Com
mandments. Sure, it cost me a few ex
tra dollars. But, I figured that when I
nailed down a top-level executive
job with Exxon, the thing would pay
for itself. So I splurged.
Of course, Exxon wasn't the only
place where I applied. I'm a realist. I
know that the job market is very
competitive. So I applied to several
other places as well. However, I was
somewhat restricted by the fact that
the postage rate for stone tablets is
astronomical.
You're probably thinking that I for
got to follow up my resumes with
phone calls, and that's why I didn't
get a job. Wrongl I called every pros
pective employer. In fact, I was pretty
clever. Rather than phoning offices

and risking wasted conversations
with secretaries, I called the presi
dent of each corporation at his
home, and told him how eager I was
to work for him. In order to impress
my future employer with my eco
nomic sense, I made all my phone
calls at 3 a.m., explaining each time,
"The rates are cheapest now and I
knew you'd be home."
However, despite my terrific re
sume and my timeiy phone calls, only
one firm asked me for an interview:
The Gums Away Dental Floss Com
pany of Kenosha, Wisconsin. I was a
little disappionted at this lack of re
sponse, but I was suddenly overcome
with a tremendous gush of excite
ment as I thought about my interview
at Gums Away. I flossed, took a cold

shower, flossed again, packed my
bags and headed for Kenosha.
I sat in the waiting room at Gum
s Away, nervously sweating and
chewing on my tie. I was flipping
through an old issue of "Gums Il
lustrated" when the secretary called
my name. "Mr. Mitchel? Mr. Plaque
will see you now." Edward Plaque,
the president of Gums Away, greeted
me at the door of his office with a
broad smile and an extended arm. I
quickly reached into my pocket to
slip on my joybuzzer. I figured that a
little comic relief at the beginning of
the interview would relax both of us
and at the same time I could impress
him with my sense of humor. Un
fortunately, I had left my joybuzzer
in my tuxedo pants. We shook hands

anyway and he asked me to sit down.
"Would you care for a piece of
floss?" he asked. Rather than insult
ing him, I graciously accepted.
"You're going to have to refresh my
memory somewhat about your quali
fications," he said. "My secretary was
trying to file your resume when it fell
on the floor and smashed into a mil
lion pieces. The damn thing broke
her foot!"
My heart sank. "I'm terribly sorry,"
I said.
"Heck, don't worry about it. Now if
I recall correctly, you and Jaques
Cousteau wrestled with the Loch
Ness Monster back in 1977? Is that
right? he asked.
"You bet!" I responded. "I'll never
forget it." I sensed that things were
going really well.
We talked a while longer. He told
me about dental floss and about the
business world. I told him about my
leaf collection and about the time I
got the mumps. It was going really
well. I was confident that soon I
would become Stanford's first dental
floss tycoon. But I needed a clincher.
One more mark in my favor and the
job would.be, mine. Jijst then, I,no
ticed a picture of a moderately attrac
tive, middle-aged woman on his
desk. It had to be Mrs. Plaque. All !
had to do was compliment his wife
and I'd be a shoo-in!
"Is that your wife?" I asked in
nocently.
"Sure is," he said.
"Wow!" I said, "I'd sure like to
sleep with herl
Apparently he didn't take my re
mark in the spirit in which it was in
tended. He said several unprintable
things to me and threatened to floss
off my kneecaps. So it looks like I
won't be spending my summer at
Gums Away. That's O.K. — I was nev
er very interested in dental floss any
way. I just wanted another business
experience to chissel onto my re
sume. Besides, all hope is not lost. I
understand the folks at NASA are
planning another space shuttle mis
sion for July ...

I don't have a summer job. Don't
get me wrong; I'm not ashamed of it.
Nine percent of the people in this
country are unemployed, and come
June, I'll be proud to join them.
Besides, who needs a summer job
anyway. I've better things to do with
my time. I can watch "Joanie Loves
Chachi" on TV. Or I can play with my
collection of pressed leaves. Or I can
go down to the dock and watch them
unload things. I've got plenty of
things to do.
I'm iust a little frustrated. I mean, I
go to Stanford. Getting a job should
be easy. Besides, I di # d everything
right. I wrote a terrific resume. Of
course, I didn't have a lot of work ex
perience, so I had to make most of
that up. But I think I came out sound
ing like a really well-rounded quali
fied guy.
"Previous experience: 1979 —
knocked out Larry Holmes to be
come the heavyweight champion of
the world; 1980 — received the
Nobel Prize for chemistry; 1981 — pi
lotted the U.S. space shuttle "Colum
bia" in its maiden voyage; 1982 —
scored 18,000 pointsin PAC-MAN."
Of course, for a resume, ap
pearance can be just as Important as
content. I realize that people usually
have their resumes typeset and
printed on nice looking paper. I
didn't want my resume to look like
everybody's else's. I wanted mine to
stand out. So, I had my resume
carved out in stone. In fact, it came
out looking just like the Ten Com
mandments. Sure, it cost me a few ex
tra dollars. But, I figured that when I
nailed down a top-level executive
job with Exxon, the thing would pay
for itself. So I splurged.
Of course, Exxon wasn't the only
place where I applied. I'm a realist. I
know that the job market is very
competitive. So I applied to several
other places as well. However, I was
somewhat restricted by the fact that
the postage rate for stone tablets is
astronomical.
You're probably thinking that I for
got to follow up my resumes with
phone calls, and that's why I didn't
get a job. Wrongl I called every pros
pective employer. In fact, I was pretty
clever. Rather than phoning offices

and risking wasted conversations
with secretaries, I called the presi
dent of each corporation at his
home, and told him how eager I was
to work for him. In order to impress
my future employer with my eco
nomic sense, I made all my phone
calls at 3 a.m., explaining each time,
"The rates are cheapest now and I
knew you'd be home."
However, despite my terrific re
sume and my timeiy phone calls, only
one firm asked me for an interview:
The Gums Away Dental Floss Com
pany of Kenosha, Wisconsin. I was a
little disappionted at this lack of re
sponse, but I was suddenly overcome
with a tremendous gush of excite
ment as I thought about my interview
at Gums Away. I flossed, took a cold

bags and headed for Kenosha.
I sat in the waiting room at Gum
s Away, nervously sweating and
chewing on my tie. I was flipping
through an old issue of "Gums Il
lustrated" when the secretary called
my name. "Mr. Mitchel? Mr. Plaque
will see you now." Edward Plaque,
the president of Gums Away, greeted
me at the door of his office with a
broad smile and an extended arm. I
quickly reached into my pocket to
slip on my joybuzzer. I figured that a
little comic relief at the beginning of
the interview would relax both of us
and at the same time I could impress
him with my sense of humor. Un
fortunately, I had left my joybuzzer
in my tuxedo pants. We shook hands

anyway and he asked me to sit down.
"Would you care for a piece of
floss?" he asked. Rather than insult
ing him, I graciously accepted.
"You're going to have to refresh my
memory somewhat about your quali
fications," he said. "My secretary was
trying to file your resume when it fell
on the floor and smashed into a mil
lion pieces. The damn thing broke
her foot!"
My heart sank. "I'm terribly sorry,"
I said.
"Heck, don't worry about it. Now if
I recall correctly, you and Jaques
Cousteau wrestled with the Loch
Ness Monster back in 1977? Is that
right? he asked.
"You bet!" I responded. "I'll never
forget it." I sensed that things were
going really well.
We talked a while longer. He told
me about dental floss and about the
business world. I told him about my
leaf collection and about the time I
got the mumps. It was going really
well. I was confident that soon I
would become Stanford's first dental
