# Josh: the 'entertainer'?
## 
### Jan Mireles 
Josh is gone. He came
amid a flurry of con
troversial flyers, posters and
cryptic messages scrawled
on classroom chalkboards.
For weeks the campus was
informed of his coming;
now the self-professed
communicator
entertainer has gone on to
other colleges and univer
sities to further spread his
discovery about Christ's res
urrection and about achiev
ing what he calls "maximum
sex."
The media hype is over.
Gone are the bears and
mummies that frequented
White Plaza announcing
Josh's presence. Gone is the
video tape that for several
days competed with the
fruit vendor's favorite radio
station. And no doubt cam
paign materials have found
their way into both trash
cans and scrap books. But in
the wake of this two night
lecture series a number of
questions remain to be an
swered.
Who is Josh McDowell?
And why would a man who
holds degrees in economic
theory, languages and the
ology, who has written nu
merous best sellers, and
who once had the ambition
to become governor of his
home state of Michigan
now spend 12 months of the
year lecturing at college
campuses for less than $500
a day?
What is the message be
hind all the smooth one
liners, warm handshakes
and friendly smiles? Is
McDowell sincere?
It's hard to say. McDowell
moves through a crowd eas
ily. Smiling and greeting his
audience, McDowell said
he typically spends up to 45
minutes before speaking
getting to know his listeners
and trading one-liners.
McDowell said he believes
it is invaluable to listen to
the people who come to
hear him speak. On Tuesday
night McDowell stopped to
greet a young woman. "Hi.
I'm Josh McDowell. What's
your name?' 'Naomi."
"That's one of my favorite
names. What do you do?'
'I'm an R.N." Several
minutes later 'Naomi/
knows that McDowell's sis
ter was a nurse, where she
worked, what she thought
of Christian nurses and how
she too accepted Christ.
McDowell thanked the
young woman and moved
on.
Pausing briefly before a
man that looked to be one

of McDowell's generation,
McDowell leaned over and
looked into the man's eyes.
Unexpectedly he asked "Do
I know you?" The question
drew a puzzled look and he
quipped, "Maybe we went
to different schools togeth
er." Suspected to be a
crowd pleaser the joke is
used throughout the eve
ning.
And finally, what
motivates McDowell to
spend 25 days a month trav
eling and spreading his
message? It doesn't seem to
be the money. McDowell
said he pays many of his own
expenses. The royalties
from his books go to Cam
pus Crusade International
for which he is a staff mem
ber. After his lecture,
McDowell told the au
dience that books and tapes
were available at a discount
rate. Yet this seemed no bid
for money because
McDowell stressed that he
didn't want money to be an
issue. He told students that
if they couldn't afford the
books or tapes they only
need ask and they could
have them free. In the same
paragraph McDowell ex
plained that the evening's
lecture had been largely
funded by students who had
decided to commit them
selves to the campus min
istry.
Though McDowell
brushed elbows with the au
dience and was quickly sur
rounded after the lecture he
seemed to detach himself
from the crowd with a brief
warning about not spread
ing his cold. A circle formed
around him and though he
spoke to one young man
with seeming intensity, his
attention focused on the en
tire group.
McDowell ended the
conversation and broke
away from the dispersing
crowd with the explanation
that he had promised an in
terview. Below is the in
terview McDowell granted.
In it 'Josh' talks about his ad
campaign, his methods and
motivations.
Q. There's been a lot of
talk about your campaign
methods. Is this the same
campaign you use at other
colleges and universities?
A. This is a real interesting
question. The last time I was
at Stanford in 1970 and 72,
we did the same thing and
nobody said a word. You
know why? Because ev
eryone was doing it, ev
eryone had a button, ev
eryone had a cause, ev
eryone was propogating

something. We're not doing
anything different than
we've done in 12 years. The
difference is the climate.
You have lack of direction
today, lack of goals, lack of
purpose as a result.
Q. Do you find the cam
paign offensivef
A. We try to do everything
in taste. Everything we do
has come up from students.
I think its creative, I think it's
excellent taste, I think it's
quality.
Q. Why do you need such
an approachf
A. When you're a Chris
tian you have more biases,
more prejudices, than any
other kind of speaker. And
you have to do more to
break those down, just to
get a hearing than anyone
else. Look at the hearing we
got tonight. It built a curiosi
ty, which I think you ought
to do.
Q. What do you feel the
campaign accomplishes?
A. I like the advertising to
point out that I'm not just a
speaker, I'm an entertainer
and there's nothing wrong
with that because some
times the best way to com
municate truth is through
entertainment. The first
night they kind of come to
check you out. And then
come back.
Q. How do you feel about
the anti-Josh campaigns
circulating on rampus?
A. I love 'em. Wish there
were more. The more of
them you have the more
people come. I'm serious, I
love it. We used to go out
and deface our own posters.
The more the better.
Q. Aren't you concerned
about flyers that read "Josh
McCodf"
A. No, why should it
bother me? I didn't do
those. You should go tothe
people who did,
I don't look at it as a cam
paign. It's a lecture series.
I'm not an evangelist, I'm a
communicator — an enter
tainer and a communicator.
There's nothing wrong with
that. I've always wanted to
be one thing — myself. I
don't have to be anything
for anyone else. I don't have
Jo put on a front.
Whether it's for Christians
or non-Christians. I can be
myself. I like myself. I know
my problems. I know my
faults. One of my desires in
speaking is not to anyone
else except myself because
to me the communication,
it's truth through person
ality. So many speakers,
once they get up in front of
