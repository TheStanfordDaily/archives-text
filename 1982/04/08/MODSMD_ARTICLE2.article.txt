# Rush alcohol policy enacted
## 
### Kathy Bodovitz Senior staff writer 
In spite of the rain which forced
the Inter Fraternity Council (IFC) to
postpone the traditional Aquafollies
and Beta-Nooner last weekend, an
other spring quarter IFC tradition —
fraternity rush — began this week
right on schedule.
Interfraternity Council President
Kevin O'Beirne estimated that about
two-thirds of Stanford men will at
tend rush parties during the next
three weeks although, as Row Direc
tor Diana Conklin pointed out, It is
impossible to say how many of those
are seriously interested in joining a
fraternity and how many are serious
ly interested only Ih the rush parties.
Those interested in the parties are
generally interested in the free alco
hol, which has been an issue of con

cern to the University in past years.
According to Conklin, the Univer
sity's alcohol policy states that if alco
hol is served at any student function,
non-alcoholic drinks must be served
in equal amounts and must be made
"equally attractive." In addition, Cal
ifornia state law requires citizens to
be 21-years-old in order to consume
alcohol.
Conklin said, "Students here are
expected to take responsibility for
their own actions and to know the
law. If they are arrested for drunk
driving or alcohol-related offenses
students must take responsibility for
that too."
She added that, "Of course if
someone is hurt as a result of alcohol
consumption we feel responsible,
but the fact is that passing lots of liq
uor regulations hasibeen shown not

to work. Regulation is not the solu
tion to alcohol abuse."
As a result of the emphasis on stu
dent responsibility, the IFC last year
passed its own alcohol regulations. In
addition to the University's "equally
atractive non-alcoholic alternative"
policy, the IFC allows hard liquor
only at the evening parties during the
first and third weeks of rush and only
until 10:30 p.m. The second week of
rush, when all the parties are held
during the afternoon, beer and wine
are the only alcoholic drinks served.
In addition, representatives of the
IFC visit rush parties to help ensure
cooperation with the rules. But,
O'Beirne said, "I personally don't
feel we should police the nouses.
We're going to swing around and
monitor (the parties) to a small ex

tent."
He added, "We're never going to
go up to somebody and say, 'Your
party has gone too late -- shut it
down.' If there were some abuse of
alcohol I'd wait and call the next day,
unless it would hurt somebody."
As a result of the deaths of two stu
dents in a car accident last fall alleged
to be caused by drunk driving,
O'Beirne said there is an increased
alcohol awareness, but that aware

ness will not put a damper on the
rush parties. "It's to our advantage to
keep everything safe," he said.
He said that a non-alcoholic alter
native is always present at rush
parties. "We don't want to make it
seem like you have to drink to get
into a fraternity." Bobby Lapin, rush
chairman of Sigma Alpha Epsilon
(SAE) said, "We always have soft
drinks and orange juice."
Lapin said he thinks "the IFC poli
cies are very reasonable. They're
good for the protection of the
freshmen who come up (to the rush
parties) and they're good for us too."
At the first SAE rush party Monday
night, Lapin estimated there were
about 250 people, but said that as
rush progresses and rushees begin to
favor one or two fraternities, the size
of the parties dwindles to about 150
people the second week and about
100 the third week.
Mark Roberge, rush co-chairman
for Kappa Alpha (KA), said the IFC al
cohol policy is "not that big a deal."
But he added that he thought 10:30
was "a little early to stop hard alco
hol" because the KA rush party,
scheduled from 7:30 to 10:30, didn't
get going until about 9:30 Tuesday
night.
O'Beirne said the fraternities are
aware that they are serving alcohol to
many students under 21-years-old,
but that students are conscientious
about their own consumption and
that of others.
