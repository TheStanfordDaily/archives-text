# Rush alcohol policy enacted
## 
### Kathy Bodovitz Senior staff writer 
In spite of the rain which forced
the Inter Fraternity Council (IFC) to
postpone the traditional Aquafollies
and Beta-Nooner last weekend, an
other spring quarter IFC tradition —
fraternity rush — began this week
right on schedule.
Interfraternity Council President
Kevin O'Beirne estimated that about
two-thirds of Stanford men will at
tend rush parties during the next
three weeks although, as Row Direc
tor Diana Conklin pointed out, It is
impossible to say how many of those
are seriously interested in joining a
fraternity and how many are serious
ly interested only Ih the rush parties.
Those interested in the parties are
generally interested in the free alco
hol, which has been an issue of con

cern to the University in past years.
According to Conklin, the Univer
sity's alcohol policy states that if alco
hol is served at any student function,
non-alcoholic drinks must be served
in equal amounts and must be made
"equally attractive." In addition, Cal
ifornia state law requires citizens to
be 21-years-old in order to consume
alcohol.
Conklin said, "Students here are
expected to take responsibility for
their own actions and to know the
law. If they are arrested for drunk
driving or alcohol-related offenses
students must take responsibility for
that too."
She added that, "Of course if
someone is hurt as a result of alcohol
consumption we feel responsible,
but the fact is that passing lots of liq
uor regulations hasibeen shown not

to work. Regulation is not the solu
tion to alcohol abuse."
As a result of the emphasis on stu
dent responsibility, the IFC last year
passed its own alcohol regulations. In
addition to the University's "equally
atractive non-alcoholic alternative"
policy, the IFC allows hard liquor
only at the evening parties during the
first and third weeks of rush and only
until 10:30 p.m. The second week of
rush, when all the parties are held
during the afternoon, beer and wine
are the only alcoholic drinks served.
In addition, representatives of the
IFC visit rush parties to help ensure
cooperation with the rules. But,
O'Beirne said, "I personally don't
feel we should police the nouses.
We're going to swing around and
monitor (the parties) to a small ex

FREE ALCOHOL — is available at most fraternities during rush, how
ever, the Interfraternity Council (IFC) passed regulations last year
which allow hard liquor only at the evening parties during the first
and third weeks of rush and only until 10:30 p.m.
