## Watt's new proposal for wilderness draws fire from critics Environmentalists mount seemingly paradoxical opposition to legislation banning mining in wilderness for 17 years 
### Fred Beddall 
In what appeared to be a sudden reversal in his quest
to open up public lands to increased resource develop
ment, Interior Secretary James Watt announced on
NBC's "Meet the Press" on Feb. 21 that he was proposing
legislation to place an 18-year moratorium on issuing oil,
gas and mineral leases in wilderness areas.
"I will ask the Congress.. .to quickly adopt new legis
lation that would prohibit drilling or mining in the wil
derness until the end of the century," Watt said, adding
that the only exceptions would be if the President de
cided "an urgent national need" warranted exploration
oft!. »se areas.
However, environmentalists have reacted to Watt's
proposal, embodied in a bill called H.R. 5603, with out
rage. Far from protecting wilderness from development,
they claim, it would severely weaken the permanent pro
tection given to wilderness areas in return for a tem
porary delay in mining activities.
"We are vehemently opposed to the Watt bill," said
Cail Backman, a spokesperson for the Wilderness Socie
ty. "It protects for 18 years what under current law would
have been protected for eternity. The wilderness system
could be opened up for leasing after the year 2000."
However, according to Andy Newman, an information
officer in Watt's office, the purpose of the bill is not to
remove permanent protection, but to give Congress and
the American people "time to consider this issue, com
plex and sensitive as it is, without these emotional forays
over individual areas." Environmental groups are oppos-

ing it, he said, because "they are convinced that no mat
ter what the Secretary does, it is a threat to the environ
ment."
For the past 20 years a storm has been brewing over im
plementation of a "sleeper" clause of the 1964 Wil
derness Act, which permits mining of claims filed before
1984. The clause was included as political necessity to as
sure passage of the bill against strong opposition to
"locking up" vital resources.
No mining has actually occurred yet on wilderness
lands, which include such spectacular and popular areas
as the high Sierra. The Wilderness Act is better known for
mandating that wilderness be administered "in such
manner as will leave the land unimpaired for future use
and enjoyment as wilderness."
Meanwhile, hundreds of applications have been filed
for the right to mine at least 35 established wilderness
areas for resources including copper, silver and oil. Two
popular California areas, the Ventana Wilderness near
Monterey and the San Rafael Wilderness near Santa
Barbara, are among the areas in question.
However, other provisions of H.R. 5603 are primarily
responsible for the environmentalists' dismay. The bill
sets a 1985 deadline for all furthur congressional wil
derness designation, automatically releasing all areas

currently under consideration as possible wilderness
areas for potential development after that date.
"If these deadlines are enacted, there will not be any
more wilderness set aside, period," said Peter Cop
pelman, forest issues specialist for the Wilderness Socie
ty. "The purpose of these deadlines is not to speed up
the study process, but destroy the process."
According to Allison Horton, associative legislative di
rector of the National Audubon Society, anti-wilderness
congressmen could easily stall long enough to prevent
consideration of the remaining de facto wilderness.
However, according to Newman, Watt's position is
that "we shouldn't let these things remain unresolved in
perpetuity," because no leasing can go on in areas still
under study until Congress takes action, even after the
Forest Service has recommended them for non-wil
derness.
"Environmental groups prefer the present system be
cause they can have their cake and eat it, too — as long as
it's being studied, it's wilderness for all practical
purposes," said Newman.
Since 1964, Congress has engaged in the slow and
often acrimonious task of deciding which roadless areas
to include in the wilderness preservation system. To
date, approximately 20 million acres in the continental
U.S. — an area one-fifth the size of California — have
been declared wilderness, while the fate of an equal
acreage of roadless areas identified by federal conserva
tion agencies has yet to be determined.
Current congressional procedure is to consider wil
derness designation on a state-by-state basis. Such bills,
which have been passed for Colorado, New Mexico, Ida
ho and Alaska, involved lengthy negotiators and in
cluded the provision that no additional wilderness pro
tection could be considered for the next five years.
According to Horton, Watt's proposal is "a resurrec
tion of the sweeping wilderness 'release' bill introduced
last year by Senators Hayakawa and Helms. That bill was
so unpopular it never left the Senate Energy and Natural
Resources Committee. The chairman of that committee,
Senator McClure of Idaho — no friend of wilderness —
refused to introduce a senate version of Watt's bill be
cause he knew no one would fall for it."

spokesman

On April 1, Representatives Morris Udall (D-Ariz.) and
Silvio Conte (R-Mass.) introduced a resolution in the
House declaring that wilderness designation was the
perogative of Congress and the Secretary of the Interior
should not propose arbitrary deadlines.
In a recent congressional hearing, Rep. Pat Williams
(D-Montana) told Secretary Watt that field hearings in
Montana and Colorado attended by a wide variety of in
terests had given Williams one clear message: "that Jim
Watt's policy on wilderness is wrong."
The first skirmish between this Congress and the In

terior Department on the issue of mining in wilderness
areas ooccured last year, when the House Interior Com
mittee invoked a little-known provision of law to freeze
for one year the issuance of oil leases in the Bob Marshall
Wilderness in the Montana Rockies. The unusual move
was in response to widespread public outrage at signs
from Interior that leasing might be permitted in this area.
A second political eruption occured last fall when Rep.
Manuel Lujan (R-New Mex.) discovered that leases had
been issued for oil and gas production in the Capitan
Wilderness in his district of New Mexico. As a result,
Watt promised at that time a moratorium on minerals
leasing in wilderness until the end of 1982.
Under current law, the Secretary of the Interior has
sole discretion over the issuance of mineral leases on wil
derness lands. Commenting on this interim ban, Horton
speculated that the administration wants to avoid politi
cally damaging controversy before the November 1982
elections.
The value of the minerals contained by wilderness
lands is the subject of considerable dispute. In most
cases, geological uncertainty about local oil reserves is
high. According to Ed Essertier, a spokesman for the In
terior Department, no one can be certain until ex
ploratory wells are drilled. "No one thought there'd be
oil in the Permian Basin of West Texas until they drilled
there. On the other hand, Cook Inlet off Alaska, which
was considered a likely area for oil, has yet to yield a
drop."
This uncertainty, along with normal lag times of six to
seven years from initial discovery to actual production,
are the reasons why the Reagan administration supports
increased leasing of public lands, said Essertier.
However, since total wilderness acreage to date repre-

Tracy Reith/Daily
sents only 10 percent of the public domain, exclusive of
the multi-billion-acre outer continental shelf, environ
mentalists argue that adequate acreage is already avail
able to meet national needs.
Former Interior Secretary Cecil Andrus has stated that
far more public land is currently leased for oil and gas
production than can possibly be exploited, while former
senator Gaylord Nelson points out that 24 million acres
of public lands have already been set aside as petroleum
reserves, giving oil and mining companies plenty to do
for a long time without moving into wilderness.
Other critics have charged that the oil industry is more
interested in speculating on the value of lease holdings,
which appreciate with every increase in oil prices, than
in producing oil.
In any case, federal conservation agencies agree that
oil and gas leasing would result in some irreversible im
pacts to the wilderness areas involved. The draft environ
mental impact statement for oil and gas leasing on the
Washakie Wilderness in the Rockie southeast of Yellow
stone identifies unavoidable adverse impacts on water
quality, local vegetative productivity and on game popu
lations. According to the EIS, the drilling operations and
roads, which would be maintained for at least 40 years,
would not necessarily destroy recreational opportunities
either during or afterwards, but an environmental "un
traveled by man" would be lost.
Whether the United States can afford to forego the re
sources of wilderness is a political question which will
continue to be debated over the coming years. Repre
sentative Phil Burton (D-San Fran.) has introduced legis
lation to close the entire wilderness System to any min
ing activity. Hearings on the issue of wilderness protec
tion are scheduled for the west coast this month.

Montana and Colorado attended by a wide variety of in
terests had given Williams one clear message: "that Jim
Watt's policy on wilderness is wrong."
The first skirmish between this Congress and the In

terior Department on the issue of mining in wilderness
areas ooccured last year, when the House Interior Com
mittee invoked a little-known provision of law to freeze
for one year the issuance of oil leases in the Bob Marshall
Wilderness in the Montana Rockies. The unusual move
was in response to widespread public outrage at signs
from Interior that leasing might be permitted in this area.
A second political eruption occured last fall when Rep.
Manuel Lujan (R-New Mex.) discovered that leases had
been issued for oil and gas production in the Capitan
Wilderness in his district of New Mexico. As a result,
Watt promised at that time a moratorium on minerals
leasing in wilderness until the end of 1982.
Under current law, the Secretary of the Interior has
sole discretion over the issuance of mineral leases on wil
derness lands. Commenting on this interim ban, Horton
speculated that the administration wants to avoid politi
cally damaging controversy before the November 1982
elections.
The value of the minerals contained by wilderness
lands is the subject of considerable dispute. In most
cases, geological uncertainty about local oil reserves is
high. According to Ed Essertier, a spokesman for the In
terior Department, no one can be certain until ex
ploratory wells are drilled. "No one thought there'd be
oil in the Permian Basin of West Texas until they drilled
there. On the other hand, Cook Inlet off Alaska, which
was considered a likely area for oil, has yet to yield a
drop."
This uncertainty, along with normal lag times of six to
seven years from initial discovery to actual production,
are the reasons why the Reagan administration supports
increased leasing of public lands, said Essertier.
However, since total wilderness acreage to date repre-

Tracy Reith/Daily
sents only 10 percent of the public domain, exclusive of
the multi-billion-acre outer continental shelf, environ
mentalists argue that adequate acreage is already avail
able to meet national needs.
Former Interior Secretary Cecil Andrus has stated that
far more public land is currently leased for oil and gas
production than can possibly be exploited, while former
senator Gaylord Nelson points out that 24 million acres
of public lands have already been set aside as petroleum
reserves, giving oil and mining companies plenty to do
for a long time without moving into wilderness.
Other critics have charged that the oil industry is more
interested in speculating on the value of lease holdings,
which appreciate with every increase in oil prices, than
in producing oil.
In any case, federal conservation agencies agree that
oil and gas leasing would result in some irreversible im
pacts to the wilderness areas involved. The draft environ
mental impact statement for oil and gas leasing on the
Washakie Wilderness in the Rockie southeast of Yellow
stone identifies unavoidable adverse impacts on water
quality, local vegetative productivity and on game popu
lations. According to the EIS, the drilling operations and
roads, which would be maintained for at least 40 years,
would not necessarily destroy recreational opportunities
either during or afterwards, but an environmental "un
traveled by man" would be lost.
Whether the United States can afford to forego the re
sources of wilderness is a political question which will
continue to be debated over the coming years. Repre
sentative Phil Burton (D-San Fran.) has introduced legis
lation to close the entire wilderness System to any min
ing activity. Hearings on the issue of wilderness protec
tion are scheduled for the west coast this month.

In what appeared to be a sudden reversal in his quest
to open up public lands to increased resource develop
ment, Interior Secretary James Watt announced on
NBC's "Meet the Press" on Feb. 21 that he was proposing
legislation to place an 18-year moratorium on issuing oil,
gas and mineral leases in wilderness areas.
"I will ask the Congress.. .to quickly adopt new legis
lation that would prohibit drilling or mining in the wil
derness until the end of the century," Watt said, adding
that the only exceptions would be if the President de
cided "an urgent national need" warranted exploration
oft!. »se areas.
However, environmentalists have reacted to Watt's
proposal, embodied in a bill called H.R. 5603, with out
rage. Far from protecting wilderness from development,
they claim, it would severely weaken the permanent pro
tection given to wilderness areas in return for a tem
porary delay in mining activities.
"We are vehemently opposed to the Watt bill," said
Cail Backman, a spokesperson for the Wilderness Socie
ty. "It protects for 18 years what under current law would
have been protected for eternity. The wilderness system
could be opened up for leasing after the year 2000."
However, according to Andy Newman, an information
officer in Watt's office, the purpose of the bill is not to
remove permanent protection, but to give Congress and
the American people "time to consider this issue, com
plex and sensitive as it is, without these emotional forays
over individual areas." Environmental groups are oppos-

Society

ing it, he said, because "they are convinced that no mat
ter what the Secretary does, it is a threat to the environ
ment."
For the past 20 years a storm has been brewing over im
plementation of a "sleeper" clause of the 1964 Wil
derness Act, which permits mining of claims filed before
1984. The clause was included as political necessity to as
sure passage of the bill against strong opposition to
"locking up" vital resources.
No mining has actually occurred yet on wilderness
lands, which include such spectacular and popular areas
as the high Sierra. The Wilderness Act is better known for
mandating that wilderness be administered "in such
manner as will leave the land unimpaired for future use
and enjoyment as wilderness."
Meanwhile, hundreds of applications have been filed
for the right to mine at least 35 established wilderness
areas for resources including copper, silver and oil. Two
popular California areas, the Ventana Wilderness near
Monterey and the San Rafael Wilderness near Santa
Barbara, are among the areas in question.
However, other provisions of H.R. 5603 are primarily
responsible for the environmentalists' dismay. The bill
sets a 1985 deadline for all furthur congressional wil
derness designation, automatically releasing all areas

currently under consideration as possible wilderness
areas for potential development after that date.
"If these deadlines are enacted, there will not be any
more wilderness set aside, period," said Peter Cop
pelman, forest issues specialist for the Wilderness Socie
ty. "The purpose of these deadlines is not to speed up
the study process, but destroy the process."
According to Allison Horton, associative legislative di
rector of the National Audubon Society, anti-wilderness
congressmen could easily stall long enough to prevent
consideration of the remaining de facto wilderness.
However, according to Newman, Watt's position is
that "we shouldn't let these things remain unresolved in
perpetuity," because no leasing can go on in areas still
under study until Congress takes action, even after the
Forest Service has recommended them for non-wil
derness.
"Environmental groups prefer the present system be
cause they can have their cake and eat it, too — as long as
it's being studied, it's wilderness for all practical
purposes," said Newman.
Since 1964, Congress has engaged in the slow and
often acrimonious task of deciding which roadless areas
to include in the wilderness preservation system. To
date, approximately 20 million acres in the continental
U.S. — an area one-fifth the size of California — have
been declared wilderness, while the fate of an equal
acreage of roadless areas identified by federal conserva
tion agencies has yet to be determined.
Current congressional procedure is to consider wil
derness designation on a state-by-state basis. Such bills,
which have been passed for Colorado, New Mexico, Ida
ho and Alaska, involved lengthy negotiators and in
cluded the provision that no additional wilderness pro
tection could be considered for the next five years.
According to Horton, Watt's proposal is "a resurrec
tion of the sweeping wilderness 'release' bill introduced
last year by Senators Hayakawa and Helms. That bill was
so unpopular it never left the Senate Energy and Natural
Resources Committee. The chairman of that committee,
Senator McClure of Idaho — no friend of wilderness —
refused to introduce a senate version of Watt's bill be
cause he knew no one would fall for it."

On April 1, Representatives Morris Udall (D-Ariz.) and
Silvio Conte (R-Mass.) introduced a resolution in the
House declaring that wilderness designation was the
perogative of Congress and the Secretary of the Interior
should not propose arbitrary deadlines.
In a recent congressional hearing, Rep. Pat Williams

sure passage of the bill against strong opposition to
"locking up" vital resources.
No mining has actually occurred yet on wilderness
lands, which include such spectacular and popular areas
as the high Sierra. The Wilderness Act is better known for
mandating that wilderness be administered "in such
manner as will leave the land unimpaired for future use
and enjoyment as wilderness."
Meanwhile, hundreds of applications have been filed
for the right to mine at least 35 established wilderness
areas for resources including copper, silver and oil. Two
popular California areas, the Ventana Wilderness near
Monterey and the San Rafael Wilderness near Santa
Barbara, are among the areas in question.
However, other provisions of H.R. 5603 are primarily
responsible for the environmentalists' dismay. The bill
sets a 1985 deadline for all furthur congressional wil
derness designation, automatically releasing all areas

currently under consideration as possible wilderness
areas for potential development after that date.
"If these deadlines are enacted, there will not be any
more wilderness set aside, period," said Peter Cop
pelman, forest issues specialist for the Wilderness Socie
ty. "The purpose of these deadlines is not to speed up
the study process, but destroy the process."
According to Allison Horton, associative legislative di
rector of the National Audubon Society, anti-wilderness
congressmen could easily stall long enough to prevent
consideration of the remaining de facto wilderness.
However, according to Newman, Watt's position is
that "we shouldn't let these things remain unresolved in
perpetuity," because no leasing can go on in areas still
under study until Congress takes action, even after the
Forest Service has recommended them for non-wil
derness.
"Environmental groups prefer the present system be
cause they can have their cake and eat it, too — as long as
it's being studied, it's wilderness for all practical
purposes," said Newman.
Since 1964, Congress has engaged in the slow and
often acrimonious task of deciding which roadless areas
to include in the wilderness preservation system. To
date, approximately 20 million acres in the continental
U.S. — an area one-fifth the size of California — have
been declared wilderness, while the fate of an equal
acreage of roadless areas identified by federal conserva
tion agencies has yet to be determined.
Current congressional procedure is to consider wil
derness designation on a state-by-state basis. Such bills,
which have been passed for Colorado, New Mexico, Ida
ho and Alaska, involved lengthy negotiators and in
cluded the provision that no additional wilderness pro
tection could be considered for the next five years.
According to Horton, Watt's proposal is "a resurrec
tion of the sweeping wilderness 'release' bill introduced
last year by Senators Hayakawa and Helms. That bill was
so unpopular it never left the Senate Energy and Natural
Resources Committee. The chairman of that committee,
Senator McClure of Idaho — no friend of wilderness —
refused to introduce a senate version of Watt's bill be
cause he knew no one would fall for it."

On April 1, Representatives Morris Udall (D-Ariz.) and
Silvio Conte (R-Mass.) introduced a resolution in the
House declaring that wilderness designation was the
perogative of Congress and the Secretary of the Interior
should not propose arbitrary deadlines.
In a recent congressional hearing, Rep. Pat Williams
(D-Montana) told Secretary Watt that field hearings in
Montana and Colorado attended by a wide variety of in
terests had given Williams one clear message: "that Jim
Watt's policy on wilderness is wrong."
The first skirmish between this Congress and the In

terior Department on the issue of mining in wilderness
areas ooccured last year, when the House Interior Com
mittee invoked a little-known provision of law to freeze
for one year the issuance of oil leases in the Bob Marshall
Wilderness in the Montana Rockies. The unusual move
was in response to widespread public outrage at signs
from Interior that leasing might be permitted in this area.
A second political eruption occured last fall when Rep.
Manuel Lujan (R-New Mex.) discovered that leases had
been issued for oil and gas production in the Capitan
Wilderness in his district of New Mexico. As a result,
Watt promised at that time a moratorium on minerals
leasing in wilderness until the end of 1982.
Under current law, the Secretary of the Interior has
sole discretion over the issuance of mineral leases on wil
derness lands. Commenting on this interim ban, Horton
speculated that the administration wants to avoid politi
cally damaging controversy before the November 1982
elections.
The value of the minerals contained by wilderness
lands is the subject of considerable dispute. In most
cases, geological uncertainty about local oil reserves is
high. According to Ed Essertier, a spokesman for the In
terior Department, no one can be certain until ex
ploratory wells are drilled. "No one thought there'd be
oil in the Permian Basin of West Texas until they drilled
there. On the other hand, Cook Inlet off Alaska, which
was considered a likely area for oil, has yet to yield a
drop."
This uncertainty, along with normal lag times of six to
seven years from initial discovery to actual production,
are the reasons why the Reagan administration supports
increased leasing of public lands, said Essertier.
However, since total wilderness acreage to date repre-

Tracy Reith/Daily
sents only 10 percent of the public domain, exclusive of
the multi-billion-acre outer continental shelf, environ
mentalists argue that adequate acreage is already avail
able to meet national needs.
Former Interior Secretary Cecil Andrus has stated that
far more public land is currently leased for oil and gas
production than can possibly be exploited, while former
senator Gaylord Nelson points out that 24 million acres
of public lands have already been set aside as petroleum
reserves, giving oil and mining companies plenty to do
for a long time without moving into wilderness.
Other critics have charged that the oil industry is more
interested in speculating on the value of lease holdings,
which appreciate with every increase in oil prices, than
in producing oil.
In any case, federal conservation agencies agree that
oil and gas leasing would result in some irreversible im
pacts to the wilderness areas involved. The draft environ
mental impact statement for oil and gas leasing on the
Washakie Wilderness in the Rockie southeast of Yellow
stone identifies unavoidable adverse impacts on water
quality, local vegetative productivity and on game popu
lations. According to the EIS, the drilling operations and
roads, which would be maintained for at least 40 years,
would not necessarily destroy recreational opportunities
either during or afterwards, but an environmental "un
traveled by man" would be lost.
Whether the United States can afford to forego the re
sources of wilderness is a political question which will
continue to be debated over the coming years. Repre
sentative Phil Burton (D-San Fran.) has introduced legis
lation to close the entire wilderness System to any min
ing activity. Hearings on the issue of wilderness protec
tion are scheduled for the west coast this month.
