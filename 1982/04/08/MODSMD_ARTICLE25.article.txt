# Campus group still fighting to beat ERA'S June deadline
## 
### Lauren Saunders 
; Though many students may think otherwise, the Equal
Rights Amendment (ERA) issue is not dead and the
movement has a very real possibility for success, accord
ing to members of a campus group called Stanford for
the Equal Rights Amendment (SERA).

News analysis

is a group of 15 to 20 students and members of
the Stanford community who have been working for
passage of the ERA. The group has been meeting once a
vveek since October of last year.
Ratification by a two-thirds majority (38) of the states
must be obtained for the amendment to be added to the
Constitution and the deadline for ratification is June 30.
$0 far 35 states have done so. Three states — Idaho, Ne
bcaska and Tennessee — have voted to rescind their rati
fication, although the legality of this action has been
questioned. An Idaho judge has held that this rescission
was illegal, although the Supreme Court recently ruled
that the judge did not have the proper jurisdiction to
Consider the case.
; The Supreme Court itself will decide the issue, but not
qntil after June. In other words, the Court does not wish
to waste its time if the ERA does not obtain ratification by
the required 30 states, making the rescission question ir
relevant.
SERA, however, claims that recent developments in Il
linois, Oklahoma and Florida in particular have renewed
Ropes that these may prove to be the three additional
states needed. The Illinois legislature began session on

March 22 and will soon vote on the "two-thirds ule";
currently a two-thirds majority of the legislators is
needed for the state to ratify the amendment. ERA sup
porters have always been two or three votes short. If the
legislature votes to change this two-thirds requirement
to one of a simple majority (as in most states), Illinois will
become one of the ratified states.
In Oklahoma, the lieutenant governor has called a
special mission for June to ensure that the legislature will
vote on the amendment. Likewise the governor of Flori
da has promised to call a session before the deadline.
SERA has been urging students from all unratified
states to write to their governors, senators and repre
sentatives to ask for their active support for the ERA.
SERA's efforts, however, will focus on Oklahoma and
Florida.
Last quarter SERA members had been calling students
from Illinois and inviting them to informational letter
writing sessions.
The response was poor. At one March meeting in
Crothers Hall, no one showed up. Group members
blamed the failure on poor timing, due to dead week
and finals week.
Members say many students have also been unwilling
to expend the energy to attend the sessions.
"People will drop everything to go to a happy hour or
to debate the color of doors in a dorm," said Colleen
McAvoy, who led a meeting last week at Theta Chi, "but
they will not spend 10 minutes to write a letter to their
Congressman."
Consequently, SERA has stopped asking people to

come to special letter-writing sessions. They now plan
simply to contact students from Oklahoma and Florida
and will even provide pre-written letters which the stu
dent need only sign and mail to their governor or repre
sentatives. Nevertheless, the group is encouraging stu
dents to re-write the letters themselves if they have time,
as personal letters are considered more effective.
Until the rain started, SERA members had also been
selling t-shirts and buttons in White Plaza, with the pro
ceeds going to the NOW (National Organization for
Women) pro-ERA campaign. SERA itself, however, is an
independent group, led by former Stanford student

In general, however, the biggest
problem which SERA has
encountered in talking to students
has been apathy. The group has
been disappointed and frustrated by
the student response which has
been 'weak'.

Cathy Poling. There are similar groups on other cam
puses, but each is working separately.
Although SERA has concentrated on asking supporters
of the ERA to write letters and has not attempted to
change the opinions of opponents, SERA members have
been researching several aspects of the issue.

They say much of the opposition to the ERA is due to
ignorance. Some people believe that the ERA will re
quire co-ed bathrooms, will force women to work, will
break up families, or will force the army to draft women
— all of which SERA claims are not true.
Some students feel that the amendment is not neces
sary. SERA points to the large body of discriminatory laws
which are still on the books, including those governing
employment practices, marriages and divorces. This is
especially true in the South, although California's laws
are considered fairly good. However, almost all state
governments — including California — and the federal
government, have exempted themselves from all civil
and equal rights legislation. They are not exempt from
the Constitution.
SERA members also point out that even if many stu
dents have not yet encountered discrimination, most
have not yet attempted to obtain a real job.
Don Koppel, another SERA member, emphasizes that
the ERA is not exclusively for women. Many divorce
laws, for example, discriminate against men by forcing
them to pay alimony or child support even if the woman
is the greater breadwinner. McAvoy notes that the ERA is
"about individuality; judging people individually" on
their own merits and situation, and not based exclusively
on their sex.
In general, however, the biggest problem which SERA
members say they have encountered in talking to stu
dents has been apathy. The group has been disappointed
and frustrated by the student response which has been
"weak." Many believe that the fight is lost, although
McAvoy feels that this is not true, but is merely a cop
out: "It's much harder to say, 'Hey, I'm going to try.' "
