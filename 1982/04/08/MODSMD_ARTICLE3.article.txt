London â€” Britain declared last night that any Argentine ship found
within 200 nautical miles of the Falkland Islands after midnight Easter
Sunday risked being attacked by British naval forces.
In a dramatic announcement to Parliament hours before U.S. Secre
tary of State Alexander Haig was due to arrive here seeking a formula for
a peaceful Argentine withdrawal from the disputed islands, Defense
Secretary John Nott said, "Our first naval action will be intended to
deny the Argentine forces on the Falklands the means to reinforce and
re-supply from the mainland."
While much of the British fleet that left port here Monday is still two
weeks away from the Falklands, several high-speed, nuclear-powered
British hunter-killer submarines dispatched as a precaution before last
week's invasion reportedly have reached the South Atlantic.
Nott did not mention the submarines last night in a list of nearly 30
military and requisitioned civilian ships he named as among those in the
task force, and the Defense Ministry has not commented on the subs'
location. But former Defense Secretary Denis Healey, now the foreign
affairs spokesman for the opposition Labor Party, said only two of the
submarines would be enough to patrol the waters around the Falklands.
"No doubt it will be a deterrent to the Argentine navy," Healy said, "al
though they will still be able to supply their troops by air."
