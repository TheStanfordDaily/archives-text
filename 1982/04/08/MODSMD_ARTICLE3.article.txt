## Britain announces pending blockade 
### 
from the wlm of the Associated Press and Los Angeles Times/Washington Pos! News Services

London — Britain declared last night that any Argentine ship found
within 200 nautical miles of the Falkland Islands after midnight Easter
Sunday risked being attacked by British naval forces.
In a dramatic announcement to Parliament hours before U.S. Secre
tary of State Alexander Haig was due to arrive here seeking a formula for
a peaceful Argentine withdrawal from the disputed islands, Defense
Secretary John Nott said, "Our first naval action will be intended to
deny the Argentine forces on the Falklands the means to reinforce and
re-supply from the mainland."
While much of the British fleet that left port here Monday is still two
weeks away from the Falklands, several high-speed, nuclear-powered
British hunter-killer submarines dispatched as a precaution before last
week's invasion reportedly have reached the South Atlantic.
Nott did not mention the submarines last night in a list of nearly 30
military and requisitioned civilian ships he named as among those in the
task force, and the Defense Ministry has not commented on the subs'
location. But former Defense Secretary Denis Healey, now the foreign
affairs spokesman for the opposition Labor Party, said only two of the
submarines would be enough to patrol the waters around the Falklands.
"No doubt it will be a deterrent to the Argentine navy," Healy said, "al
though they will still be able to supply their troops by air."
Since seizing the islands last Friday, Argentina
has added thousands of men and considerable
military hardware, including tanks, armored
personnel carriers and artillery, to the original
invasion force. Before Nott's announcement at
the end of a seven-hour special debate of the
Falklands crisis, several members of Parliament
expressed concern about the Argentine mili
tary buildup.
Nott told Parliament that Britain was declar
ing a maritime exclusion zone covering a 200-
mile radius from the center of the Falklands
from 0400 Greenwich Mean Time on Monday,
April 12 — midnight in the Falklands. "Any Ar
gentine warships and any Argentine naval aux
iliaries found within this zone," Nott said, "will
be treated as hostile and are liable to be at
tacked by British forces."
Argentina installs a military
government on the Falklands
Buenos Aires, Argentina — Argentina for
mally installed what it promised would be a
moderate military government on the Falkland
Islands yesterday and, as tensions continued to
grow here, stressed in softened tones its willing
ness to negotiate with Britain.
The military government flew a wide range of
its civilian political and labor opponents to the
islands yesterday morning to watch the swear
ing in of Gen. Mario Benjamin Menendez as
governor. Interior Minister Alfredo Saint-Jean
declared that the country's old civilian and mili
tary adversaries were now "brothers as never
before."
Saint-Jean, the ranking Argentine official at
the ceremony, also said he was "optimistic" that
armed conflict with Britain over the disputed
South Atlantic archipelago could be avoided,
adding that he had "a lot of respect for Mrs.
Margaret Thatcher and we believe the English
government should reflect on the matter."
Saint-Jean's mild remarks, made to reporters
as officials embarked for the ceremony in the is
land town of Port Stanley — now called Puerto
Riverc by the Argentines — reflected efforts by
Argentine officials to retain control over their
new territory while avoiding the British fleet
now headed for the area.
As the president, Gen. Leopoldo Galtieri, met
with his Cabinet yesterday to consider attempts
by the United States to mediate the dispute, Ar
gentine officials tried to defuse the crisis and
gain international support by stressing what
they said were good conditions on the islands
and denouncing British attempts to reclaim
them as "anachronistic" and a "war to return to
a colonial position."
At the same time, war-like measures and ten
sions continued to grow here. Officials recalled
part of the last group of draftees released from
military service and turned away journalists
seeking to observe military operations at the
southern port of Comodoro Rivadavia.
Haig sent to Britain, Argentina
Washington — President Ronald Reagan yes
terday dispatched Secretary of State Alexander
Haig on an urgent mission to London and Bue
nos Aires in hopes of keeping the crisis between
Britain and Argentina over the Falkland Islands
from exploding into warfare.
Haig was scheduled to leave early this morn
ing for London on the first leg of the search for a
peaceful resolution of the confrontation that
began last Friday when Argentine military units
forcibly occupied the islands that have been
under British control for 149 years.
The decision to have Haig explore with British
and Argentine leaders the chances for averting
an armed clash in the South Atlantic was made
by Reagan yesterday morning following a
White House meeting with his national security
advisers. Reagan acted just before his departure
for a five-day "working holiday" in Jamaica and
Barbados.
On his arrival in Jamaica, the president re
fused to answer questions about Haig's trip. But
White House officials noted that the secretary
had received invitations from both govern
ments, and deputy chief of staff Michael Deaver
said, "I don't think he would have gone if there
weren't some signs of hope."

Haig had been scheduled to accompany Rea
gan to the Caribbean. His sudden shift to a mis
sion that will take him first to London and then
another 6000 miles to the Argentine capital un
derscored anew the U.S. concern about head
ing off a potential armed clash between two
governments whose friendship the adminis
tration regards as vital to U.S. policy goals in Eu
rope and Latin America.
The secretary, whom State Department
sources said is tentatively expected to return
here around Sunday, will be working in a con
text of increasing tension. Prime Minister
Margaret Thatcher's British government an
nounced yesterday that it is instituting a
blockade spanning 200 miles around the
Falklands effective 11 p.m. EDT Sunday night.
However, both White House and State De
partment officials publicly insisted that Haig's
aim, at this juncture, is to hold "preliminary dis
cussions" with British and Argentine leaders.
They pointedly refused to accept the term "me
diation" as descriptive of Haig's mission, and
they said "no" to questions about whether he is
carrying any specific proposals for a solution.
Reagan leaves for Caribbean
Kingston, Jamaica — President Ronald Rea
gan yesterday launched a self-styled five-day
"working holiday" with a visit to the Caribbean
nation whose government has been most sup
portive of his regional policies.
Reagan, whose domestic economic policies
have come under increasing criticism at home,
arrived here to the warm praise of Prime Min
ister Edward Seaga. The Jamiacan leader praised
Reagan's Caribbean Basin Initiative as opening
"a new window of opportunity for hard
pressed Caribbean countries to create the new
employment and improve standards of living
which are essential to all democratic systems of
government."
Seaga had reason to praise Reagan, whose
free-market advocacies closely resemble his
own.
While the Reagan administration has been
cutting domestic social programs, it has been
increasing economic aid to Jamaica. In addi
tion, this island nation would benefit heavily
from a key provision of the Caribbean Basin In
itiative announced by Reagan in February that
would remove U.S. tariffs on most goods im
ported from the region.
Univ. shuffle shakes Poland
Warsaw, Poland — The highly respected rec
tor of Warsaw University, was replaced yester
day in a move that one knowledgeable Western
source said was "almost guaranteed" to spark
trouble on Poland's campuses. His fate was
viewed here as an indication of the martial-law
regime's intention toward higher education.
Details of the resignation of Henryk
Samsonowicz, a Medieval historian and rector
of the university since September 1980, were
sketchy, and Samsonowicz himself was not
available for comment.
However, university and diplomatic sources
said the reform-minded educator was clearly
forced out of his job. He was replaced by
Kazimierz Dabrowolski, a biologist and former
assistant rector for student affairs, who was
elevated to the job yesterday.
What was less certain, the sources said, was
whether the removal of Samsonowicz signaled
the beginning of an ideological purge of the
country's educational system or if it was merely
the result of a well-known feud between the
liberal educator and hard-liners in the Warsaw
Communist Party.
University sources have said that one reason
there has been peace on the Warsaw campus
since the country's higher educational institu
tions reopened under martial law in February
was that students didn't want to jeopardize
Samsonowicz's position by causing any trouble.
Oakland bus crash kills 7
Oakland, Calif. — A transit bus collided with a
gasoline tanker in a highway tunnel here early
yesterday, setting off an explosion that killed
seven persons trapped in what authorities
called a "firestorm."

The accident occurred in the Caldecott Tun
nel, a heavily used commuter route between
San Francisco and the East Bay, at 12:16 a.m. In
all, eight vehicles were involved. The bus, re
turning to Oakland after completing its route,
was empty except for the driver.
Officials said it appeared that the bus had
struck a stalled car, swerved and then collided
with the rear of a double-tanker truck carrying
8800 gallons of gasoline. The truck's volatile
cargo erupted in flame, with heat so intense it
obliterated the cars in its wake.
"It was like something out of a war," said Cali
fornia Highway Patrol Officer James Mattos. "A
firestorm swept through ihe tunnel. With the
wind blowing through the tunnel, it vented just
like a chimney ... The effect was totally devas
tating."
The explosion was heard by Highway Patrol
officers traveling on Interstate 580, three miles
away. Those first on the scene reported heat so
fierce it destroyed brass valves built to
withstand temperatures of 1000 degrees Fahr
enheit.
"The heat was incredible," Salvation Army
Capt. Robert Smith said. "It was like a battle
ground. Inside the tunnel, the valves on the
fires extinguishers were melted off."
Three persons survived the incident, accord
ing to the CHP. One, identified as Steve
Rutledge, 31, of Carson City, Nev., said he saw
his mother perish as she tried to use an emer
gency telephone in the tunnel to summon au
thorities.
Rutledge, speaking to reporters at a nearby
hospital, said he and his mother saw the bus hit
the stalled car, strike the tunnel wall and keep
on going. They jumped out of their car to divert
traffic. "She was standing at the call box and just
got caught up in a big ball of smoke and fire,"
Rutledge said. "I watched my mother die."
Former officials call for U.S.
denial of nuclear first strike
Washington — A profound shift in military
strategy in which the United States would re
nounce "first use" of atomic weapons if the So
viets attacked Western Europe with conven
tional forces was called for yesterday by four
high-ranking former officials whose govern
ment service ranged from the Truman to the
Carter administrations.
The United States has held out the first-use
threat as a possible answer to the Soviets' de
cided numerical superiority in conventional
forces in Europe.
• The four officials argue (hat renunciation of
first use not only would reduce the liikelihood
of nuclear war, but ultimately provide the basis
for strengthening conventional forces and po
litical unity within the western alliance, thereby
improving the credibility of Western defense
and the ability to deter a Soviet attack.
The proposal to begin a "careful study" of
such a strategy switch is contained in an article
in the latest edition of Foreign Affairs quarterly.
The article was written by McGeorge Bundy,
national security adviser to presidents Kennedy
and Johnson; Robert McNamara, secretary of
defense in those same administrations; George
Kennan, ambassador to the Soviet Union in
1952; and Gerard Smith, the chief delegate to
the U.S.-Soviet strategic arms limitation, or
SALT, talks under President Richard Nixon and
an ambassador-at-large in the Carter adminis
tration.
Stocks finish mixed
New York — The stock market fluctuated in a
narrow range yesterday, finishing mixed on in
creased trading volume.
Analysts said wariness over the trend of cor
porate earnings reports for the first quarter
helped keep the market from making headway.
The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials, up
4.00 on Tuesday, dropped back 2.48 to 836.85.
Gold closed at $354 per troy ounce in New
York.
