# Live-in students increase security in remote computer music center
## 
### Sally Newman 
A center for computer research
in music is presently housed in the
DC power building, which lies
deep in the foothills just off a re
mote section of Arastradero Road.
But the very isolation which af
fords faculty and students ample
privacy has left the structure vul
nerable to vandalism and theft of
expensive equipment.
Two years ago, thieves broke
into the building and made off
with several computer terminals,
leaving shattered windows and
damaged equipment in their
wake. None of the stolen property
has been recovered.
After the incident, the Provost's
Office, which administers the
building, hired five music gradu
ate students to serve as live-in se
curity guards. "We decided that
moving the students in would be
the most cost-effective way of
solving the problem," said Valerie

Veronin, an assistant to the vice
provost for management and
budget.
In exchange for free room, the
students are charged with protect
ing both the building and the ad
jacent property. Felt Lake, a few
hundred yards distant, is off-limits
to swimmers, and enforcement of
this law also falls to the students.
Whether because of or despite
its out-of-the-way location, the
live-ins do on occasion face un
wanted visitors. According to
Patte Wood, building manager
and research project adminis
trator, the police must be sum
moned at least once a month to
help disperse trespassers.
"Fraternity members are very nice
when they're in a classroom," she
said, "but after a couple of beers
The three levels of the structure
house a number of facilities
besides those designated for the

computer music research. The
Treasure Market, an organization
of the art department, stores the
works of art which it collects in an
ticipation of its biannual art auc
tion. Proceeds from the auction
benefit the art department.
Other parts of the University,
including the Center for Informa
tion Technology, also take advan
tage of the building's storage facil
ities.
The center will only remain at
the Arastradero site until the
Braun Music Center's scheduled
completion in Fall 1983. As soon as
the music department moves into
the new complex, computer mu
sic researchers will move to the
Knoll.
After that time, the fate of the
DC Power building is uncertain,
according to Veronin.
"We're not sure what we're
going to do with it then," she said.
