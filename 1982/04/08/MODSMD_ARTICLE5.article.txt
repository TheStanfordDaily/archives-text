Stressing their previous ex
perience in ASSU government, the
members of the Council of Presi
dents (COP) slate composed of Rod
Beckstrom, Mark Epstein, Cynthia
Mathewson and Yolanda Townsend
are mounting their campaign to be
elected next year's COP.

Election Profile

The "BET'M" slate contains two
present ASSU senators and the cur
rent ASSU student financial manager.
BET'M will oppose the other COP
slate composed of Eloisa Carrillo,
Robin Cooper, Michael Lighty and
Doris Wilson during the elections on
April 14 and 15.
Beckstrom, a current ASSU senator
and junior majoring in economics,
will become the COP chairman in the
event his slate is elected. Beckstrom
said the most important issues in the
campaign were the slate's plans for
investigating University Food Ser
vice, constructing a Lakeside Recrea

tion Center, transforming Encina Sta
tion into a pizza and ice cream parlor
and establishing student lobbyists in
the state and national capitols.
The slate's platform calls University
Food Service an "inefficient, top
heavy organization" and encourages
the University to "investigate various
private contractors" to determine if
they could provide board service less
expensively and more efficiently.
Beckstrom has already been deeply
involved in the food service issue as
the chairman of the ASSU Task Force
on University Food Service.
The platform also recommends
that the University build a Lakeside
Recreation Center, establish a stu
dent-run catalog co-op and trans
form Encina Station into an ASSU-run
restaurant serving ice cream and
pizza.
Beckstrom said another of the
slate's innovative ideas is the creation
of a lobbying position for a Stanford
student in Washington D.C. and Sac
ramento. Under this program, a stu
dent would receive academic credit
and financial assistance to lobby leg
islators on issues of concern to Stan
ford students, such as student loans

and national research policy legisla
tion.
Townsend said she felt one of the
most important issues of her slate's
campaign is the proposed creation of
a Cultural Programming Board
within the ASSU to coordinate the ac
tivities of various cultural com
munities at Stanford. A junior major
ing in internatinal relations and an
administrative intern at the Black
Community Services Center,
Townsend said such a programming
board would be helpful for small cul
tural groups on campus who could
benefit through such interaction and
mutual support.
Townsend said the BET'M slate is
also committed to "broadening the
representation of the ASSU to gradu
ate students." The slate's platform
calls for the construction of a gradu
ate housing complex, the estab
lishment of more clearly defined re
search guidelines and the creation of
a Graduate Cabinet to "advise the
COP and senate about graduate con
cerns."
Epstein, currently the ASSU Fi
nance Committee chairman and a
junior majoring in British studies,

said the ASSU's slow progress often
frustrates students and makes them
vote for COP slates that represent
nothing but opposition to the cur
rent ASSU officials.
"It's really necessary that we bring
continuity to the ASSU if we ever
want to have an effective voice," he
said.
Epstein said that the current ASSU
officials have already won the respect
of the University administrators and
that such respect should be con
tinued.
"Our spending a second year in
the ASSU would allow us to en
courage administrators to believe
that the ASSU is an organization with
continuity," he said.
Townsend admitted that their op
ponents may claim that the BET'M
slate is actually weakened by the fact
that three of its members currently
hold highpositions in the ASSU and
thus have lost contact with the stu
dents.
Mathewson, a senior in economics
and the current student financial
manager (SFM), said she had been of
fered the SFM position for next year
but had turned it down to run for
COP.
