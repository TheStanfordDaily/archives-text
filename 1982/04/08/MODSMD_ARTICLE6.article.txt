# Senate seat race intensifies as primary nears
## 
### Peggy Hernandez 
Trying to name ail of the can
didates for the U.S. senate seat being
vacated by Sen. S. I. Hayakawa (R-
Calif.) is like trying to name the Seven
Dwarfs: You can list most of them,
but you just can't remember them all.
The most distinguishing character
istic about the June 8 Senate primary
is the plethora of candidates who
have embarked on serious cam
paigns: four Democratic contenders
and six Republican contenders.

News Analysis

But, with the primary only nine
weeks away, the field has narrowed
somewhat, the frontrunners are
more in focus and the candidates
who probably won't win but will af
fect the winners are discernable.
On the Democratic side, the clear
frontrunner and probable winner is
Governor Edmund "Jerry" Brown.
With $2 million in his campaign cof
fers, Brown refuses to launch a seri
ous campaign against his Democratic
challengers and is saving his funds for
the November election. Most of

Brown's public appearances have
been in his capacity as governor,
while, discretely, Brown attends
private fundraisers up and down the
state.
While there is little doubt Brown
will win the Democratic nod, party
members fret about various Field
polls which indicate the governor
would be handily defeated by the top
three Republican Senate conten
ders: San Diego Mayor Pete Wilson,
Reps. Barry Goldwater Jr. (R-Wood
land Hills) and Paul "Pete McCloskey
(R-Menlo Park).
This possibility was aired during
last month's Democratic State Con
vention in Los Angeles. Two Demo
cratic contenders, Fresno Mayor Dan
Whitehurst and State Senator Paul
Carpenter (D-Cypress), urged party
members to support them rather
than the governor because of the
Field's poll's conclusions. The two
men were promptly booed by Brown
supporters.
Statewide, Brown's popularity is
marred by his handling of the Medfly
crisis and criticism of his appoint
ment of Rose Bird to the California

Supreme Court. His appointment of
Adriana Gianturco as California's di
rector of transportation has also been
heavily criticized. Critics charge Gi
anturco has been inept in her han
dling of the state's transportation
problems. Despite pressure, Brown

refuses to remove her from office.
On the other hand, Brown is cred
ited with staving off Interior Secre
tary James Watt's plans for offshore
oil drilling along California's
coastline. Brown rallied the support
of Western and Southern governors,
who, in turn, urged the Merchant
Marine Committee to defeat Watt's
proposal. Brown also supports the
expansion of technological busi

nesses through a business and gov
ernment partnership. He has said
that he believes the high technology
industries will form the base of Cali
fornia's future prosperity, some of
which could be achieved through
foreign trade.
Brown's nearest competitor for the
Democratic Senate seat is novelist
Gore Vidal. Vidal earned 10 percent
in last week's Field Poll (compared to
Brown's 57 percent). Vidal calls
himself the "Peace Candidate" and
appears to be using the primary to
espouse his belief that the United
States is headed for a nuclear
Armageddon unless it cuts back on
defense spending and pulls away
from a pro-war attitude. While ex
tremely popular with crowds and the
press, Vidal is not considered a seri
ous candidate by the Democratic
party.
Being taken seriously is a problem
which also plagues a Republican can
didate for the U.S. Senate. Despite
repeated attention-getting efforts,
Ted Bruinsma, former dean of Loyola
Law School, continues to pull a low

one percent of the support in the re
cent Field poll. Bruinsma has failed to
raise substantial campaign funds or
to bolster his name identification.
Maureen Reagan's campaign is
also plagued by lack of funds, to the
point that her campaign manager
was dropped months ago because of
low finances. However, Reagan
pulled 10 percent in the most recent
Field poll.
The Republican candidates to
watch are Goldwater, McCloskey,
Wilson and Rep. Robert Dornan (R-
Santa Monica).
Goldwater has consistently been
the Field Poll leader, though his ad
vantage dipped six points to 29 per
cent in the latest poll. A staunch con
servative, Goldwater supports cuts in
the national Social Security program,
opposes the Equal Rights Amend
ment and opposes federal aid for
abortions. He was the author of the
1974 Right to Privacy Act, a law which
gives private citizens access to gov
ernment files about them.
Recently, Goldwater has been sub
ject to criticism by fellow Republican
candidates because he refuses to de
bate in public and because his father,
Sen. Barry Goldwater (R-Arizona), is
an active campaigner for his son. The
press has also taken small jabs at the
congressman for his failure to notify
the press about his appearances.
Wilson is making strong gains with
the public, widened by his second
place position with 24 percent. A po
litical moderate, Wilson is a vocal
supporter of agricultural businesses,
supports the "Victims Bill of Rights"
initiative and is considered in
strumental in turning San Diego into
an aggressive pro-business com
munity.

McCloskey's campaign bid may be
in serious trouble. He is solidly in
third place with 18 percent in the
Field Poll. The Los Angeles Times re
ported two weeks ago that Mc-
Closkey was sounding discouraged
about his prospects in the race. Mc-
Closkey told the Daily that a bad case
of the flu, which has plagued him
since March 13, is the reason for his
dispondency. Nonetheless, The Pen
insula Times Tribune which caters to
McCloskey's home turf, all but gave
him a vote of no confidence in last
Friday's editorial.
"Most of McCloskey's support is
coming from Northern California, of
course, and unless the old
Leatherneck stirs the hearts and
minds of thousands of southlanders
with his own TV-aid blitz, he indeed
will be a lame duck this summer," the
editorial stated.
Dornan was endorsed two weeks
ago by the California Republican As
sembly which represents 14,000 reg
istered conservative voters. Dornan,
also know as "B-1 Bob" because of
his support for B-1 bombers, may
chip off some of the conservative
support which would have gone to
Goldwater.
Wilson's boost in the polls is
partially due to his recent $200,000
media blitz. He is presently trying to
raise funds for another media cam
paign for late April and early May.
Since he and McCloskey are political
moderates, Wilson hopes to pick up
where McCloskey loses it, particular
ly with the Jewish community.
In February, an open letter printed
on Wilson's stationery and signed by
statewide Jewish community leaders
appealed for Wilson's support be
cause Wilson "has been an extra or
dinary friend to the Jewish communi
ty/The letter also attacked Mc-
Closkey for openly meeting with
Palestinian Liberation Organization.

which also plagues a Republican can
didate for the U.S. Senate. Despite
repeated attention-getting efforts,
Ted Bruinsma, former dean of Loyola
Law School, continues to pull a low

one percent of the support in the re
cent Field poll. Bruinsma has failed to
raise substantial campaign funds or
to bolster his name identification.
Maureen Reagan's campaign is
also plagued by lack of funds, to the
point that her campaign manager
was dropped months ago because of
low finances. However, Reagan
pulled 10 percent in the most recent
Field poll.
The Republican candidates to
watch are Goldwater, McCloskey,
Wilson and Rep. Robert Dornan (R-
Santa Monica).
Goldwater has consistently been
the Field Poll leader, though his ad
vantage dipped six points to 29 per
cent in the latest poll. A staunch con
servative, Goldwater supports cuts in
the national Social Security program,
opposes the Equal Rights Amend
ment and opposes federal aid for
abortions. He was the author of the
1974 Right to Privacy Act, a law which
gives private citizens access to gov
ernment files about them.
Recently, Goldwater has been sub
ject to criticism by fellow Republican
candidates because he refuses to de
bate in public and because his father,
Sen. Barry Goldwater (R-Arizona), is
an active campaigner for his son. The
press has also taken small jabs at the
congressman for his failure to notify
the press about his appearances.
Wilson is making strong gains with
the public, widened by his second
place position with 24 percent. A po
litical moderate, Wilson is a vocal
supporter of agricultural businesses,
supports the "Victims Bill of Rights"
initiative and is considered in
strumental in turning San Diego into
an aggressive pro-business com
munity.

McCloskey's campaign bid may be
in serious trouble. He is solidly in
third place with 18 percent in the
Field Poll. The Los Angeles Times re
ported two weeks ago that Mc-
Closkey was sounding discouraged
about his prospects in the race. Mc-
Closkey told the Daily that a bad case
of the flu, which has plagued him
since March 13, is the reason for his
dispondency. Nonetheless, The Pen
insula Times Tribune which caters to
McCloskey's home turf, all but gave
him a vote of no confidence in last
Friday's editorial.
"Most of McCloskey's support is
coming from Northern California, of
course, and unless the old
Leatherneck stirs the hearts and
minds of thousands of southlanders
with his own TV-aid blitz, he indeed
will be a lame duck this summer," the
editorial stated.
Dornan was endorsed two weeks
ago by the California Republican As
sembly which represents 14,000 reg
istered conservative voters. Dornan,
also know as "B-1 Bob" because of
his support for B-1 bombers, may
chip off some of the conservative
support which would have gone to
Goldwater.
Wilson's boost in the polls is
partially due to his recent $200,000
media blitz. He is presently trying to
raise funds for another media cam
paign for late April and early May.
Since he and McCloskey are political
moderates, Wilson hopes to pick up
where McCloskey loses it, particular
ly with the Jewish community.
In February, an open letter printed
on Wilson's stationery and signed by
statewide Jewish community leaders
appealed for Wilson's support be
cause Wilson "has been an extra or
dinary friend to the Jewish communi
ty/The letter also attacked Mc-
Closkey for openly meeting with
Palestinian Liberation Organization.
Trying to name ail of the can

Dwarfs: You can list most of them,
but you just can't remember them all.
The most distinguishing character
istic about the June 8 Senate primary
is the plethora of candidates who
have embarked on serious cam
paigns: four Democratic contenders
and six Republican contenders.

News Analysis

But, with the primary only nine
weeks away, the field has narrowed
somewhat, the frontrunners are
more in focus and the candidates
who probably won't win but will af
fect the winners are discernable.
On the Democratic side, the clear
frontrunner and probable winner is
Governor Edmund "Jerry" Brown.
With $2 million in his campaign cof
fers, Brown refuses to launch a seri
ous campaign against his Democratic
challengers and is saving his funds for
the November election. Most of

Brown's public appearances have
been in his capacity as governor,
while, discretely, Brown attends
private fundraisers up and down the
state.
While there is little doubt Brown
will win the Democratic nod, party
members fret about various Field
polls which indicate the governor
would be handily defeated by the top
three Republican Senate conten
ders: San Diego Mayor Pete Wilson,
Reps. Barry Goldwater Jr. (R-Wood
land Hills) and Paul "Pete McCloskey
(R-Menlo Park).
This possibility was aired during
last month's Democratic State Con
vention in Los Angeles. Two Demo
cratic contenders, Fresno Mayor Dan
Whitehurst and State Senator Paul
Carpenter (D-Cypress), urged party
members to support them rather
than the governor because of the
Field's poll's conclusions. The two
men were promptly booed by Brown
supporters.
Statewide, Brown's popularity is
marred by his handling of the Medfly
crisis and criticism of his appoint
ment of Rose Bird to the California

Supreme Court. His appointment of
Adriana Gianturco as California's di
rector of transportation has also been
heavily criticized. Critics charge Gi
anturco has been inept in her han
dling of the state's transportation
problems. Despite pressure, Brown

refuses to remove her from office.
On the other hand, Brown is cred
ited with staving off Interior Secre
tary James Watt's plans for offshore
oil drilling along California's
coastline. Brown rallied the support
of Western and Southern governors,
who, in turn, urged the Merchant
Marine Committee to defeat Watt's
proposal. Brown also supports the
expansion of technological busi

nesses through a business and gov
ernment partnership. He has said
that he believes the high technology
industries will form the base of Cali
fornia's future prosperity, some of
which could be achieved through
foreign trade.
Brown's nearest competitor for the
Democratic Senate seat is novelist
Gore Vidal. Vidal earned 10 percent
in last week's Field Poll (compared to
Brown's 57 percent). Vidal calls
himself the "Peace Candidate" and
appears to be using the primary to
espouse his belief that the United
States is headed for a nuclear
Armageddon unless it cuts back on
defense spending and pulls away
from a pro-war attitude. While ex
tremely popular with crowds and the
press, Vidal is not considered a seri
ous candidate by the Democratic
party.
