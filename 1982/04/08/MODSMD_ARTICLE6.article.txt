# Senate seat race intensifies as primary nears

Trying to name ail of the can
didates for the U.S. senate seat being
vacated by Sen. S. I. Hayakawa (R-
Calif.) is like trying to name the Seven
Dwarfs: You can list most of them,
but you just can't remember them all.
The most distinguishing character
istic about the June 8 Senate primary
is the plethora of candidates who
have embarked on serious cam
paigns: four Democratic contenders
and six Republican contenders.

News Analysis

But, with the primary only nine
weeks away, the field has narrowed
somewhat, the frontrunners are
more in focus and the candidates
who probably won't win but will af
fect the winners are discernable.
On the Democratic side, the clear
frontrunner and probable winner is
Governor Edmund "Jerry" Brown.
With $2 million in his campaign cof
fers, Brown refuses to launch a seri
ous campaign against his Democratic
challengers and is saving his funds for
the November election. Most of

Brown's public appearances have
been in his capacity as governor,
while, discretely, Brown attends
private fundraisers up and down the
state.
While there is little doubt Brown
will win the Democratic nod, party
members fret about various Field
polls which indicate the governor
would be handily defeated by the top
three Republican Senate conten
ders: San Diego Mayor Pete Wilson,
Reps. Barry Goldwater Jr. (R-Wood
land Hills) and Paul "Pete McCloskey
(R-Menlo Park).
This possibility was aired during
last month's Democratic State Con
vention in Los Angeles. Two Demo
cratic contenders, Fresno Mayor Dan
Whitehurst and State Senator Paul
Carpenter (D-Cypress), urged party
members to support them rather
than the governor because of the
Field's poll's conclusions. The two
men were promptly booed by Brown
supporters.
Statewide, Brown's popularity is
marred by his handling of the Medfly
crisis and criticism of his appoint
ment of Rose Bird to the California

Supreme Court. His appointment of
Adriana Gianturco as California's di
rector of transportation has also been
heavily criticized. Critics charge Gi
anturco has been inept in her han
dling of the state's transportation
problems. Despite pressure, Brown

refuses to remove her from office.
On the other hand, Brown is cred
ited with staving off Interior Secre
tary James Watt's plans for offshore
oil drilling along California's
coastline. Brown rallied the support
of Western and Southern governors,
who, in turn, urged the Merchant
Marine Committee to defeat Watt's
proposal. Brown also supports the
expansion of technological busi

nesses through a business and gov
ernment partnership. He has said
that he believes the high technology
industries will form the base of Cali
fornia's future prosperity, some of
which could be achieved through
foreign trade.
Brown's nearest competitor for the
Democratic Senate seat is novelist
Gore Vidal. Vidal earned 10 percent
in last week's Field Poll (compared to
Brown's 57 percent). Vidal calls
himself the "Peace Candidate" and
appears to be using the primary to
espouse his belief that the United
States is headed for a nuclear
Armageddon unless it cuts back on
defense spending and pulls away
from a pro-war attitude. While ex
tremely popular with crowds and the
press, Vidal is not considered a seri
ous candidate by the Democratic
party.
Being taken seriously is a problem
which also plagues a Republican can
didate for the U.S. Senate. Despite
repeated attention-getting efforts,
Ted Bruinsma, former dean of Loyola
Law School, continues to pull a low
