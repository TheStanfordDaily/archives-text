## New attention placed on disputed lands 
### Associated Press 
Paris — The Falkland Islands crisis has
focused attention on a number of other
disputed islands and archipelagos scat
tered across the world that could even
tually turn into major international hot
spots.
Some of these potential trouble spots
are of vital strategic importance, like the
Straight of Hormuz islands at the entrance
to the Persian Gulf, which provide a key
checkpoint for Middle East oil tranport.
In the Indian Oceati, the controversial
British-adminstered Diego Garcia, where
the United States has set up a major mili
tary base, is also strategically located at a
key maritime crossroads.
With the exception of Cyprus and
Taiwan, practically all international
wrangles over the sovereignty of these is
lands stem from disputes that began over a
century ago.
Taiwan, 93 miles of the Chinese main
land, was taken over in 1949 by Chinese
Nationalists, led by Gen. Chiang Kai-shek,
who fled the mainland after the Com
munists seized control. Since then, Peking
has persistently claimed sovereignty over

the island, which has a population of 17
million.
The Mediterranean island of Cyprus was
divided in 1974, with some 500,000 Greek
Cypriots ruling the south and some 120,000
Turkish Cypriots settling in the north. Ne
gotiations to settle the quarrel have so far
failed.
Other potential hotspots:
— The Middle East. The three tiny, bare
Saudi Arabian island rocks of Abu Mussa
and the Small and GreatTunbs, strategical
ly set just north of the Straight of Hormuz
and thus controlling the entrance to the
Persian Gulf, were taken over by Iran in
1974 following persistent claims by Tehran
of rightful ownership.
The islands of Tiran and Sanafir, at the
mouth of the Gulf of Aqaba, have been
claimed by both Egypt and Saudi Arabia
but were occupied by Israel in 1956 and
1967.
— The Indian Ocean. The inhabitants of
Diego Garcia in the Indian Ocean were
evacuated in 1971 when Britain leased the
islands to the United States, which has set
up its biggest Indian Ocean military base
there. But Mauritius has staked claims over

the islands, which it formerly ruled.
The 228-mile long archipelago of May
otte off Eastern Africa has been ad
minsitered by France since its residents re
fused independence. But the Comotro Re
public, off south-east Africa, have de
manded that the archipelago be returned
to its rule.
— The Far East. The four South Kurile is
lands, northeast of Japan, were handed
over to the Soviet Union in 1945, but Japan
has maintained its former rights to the is
lands on the basis of an 1855 treaty.
The South China Sea islands Paracel and
Spratly, off the Vietnamese coast, have
been disputed since 1974 by China, Viet
nam and the Philippines.
— South America. Besides its long
standing argument with Britain over the
Falkland Islands, Argentina has also ques
tioned Chilean claims to the Beagle Chan
nel, at the southern tip of Latin America,
between Cape Horn and Tierra del Fuego.
The 100-year-old conflict between the two
all but triggered a war in December 1978 as
Argentina disputed Chile's occupation of
the Lennox, Picton and Nueva islands at
the mouth of the channel.
