# Dutch decry US policies
## 
### Los Angeles Times 
Amsterdam, Netherlands â€”
When the U.S. government
does something that proves to
be unpopular here, the Dutch
tend to take it out on the Amer
ican Consulate.
The other day workmen
were repairing the damage
caused in a recent attack and,
amid the din, Consul General
Morey Bell told a visiting re
porter:
"This is the 35th anti-Ameri
can demonstration since I
came here 21-2 years ago, but I
would not say the Dutch are
anti-American, because there
is this underlying gut friend
ship with the United States.
"It is the American policies
they do not like....They feel
they have the freedom to be
extremely brutal with us."
These sentiments have led to
concern in the North Atlantic
Treaty Organization that the
Dutch may drift into pacifism
and neutralism. That, Bell said
would be disastrous for the al
liance.
"The Dutch are central to
us," Bell said. "There is a great
deal at risk, and naturally we
are concerned. We have a spe
cial concern to get them to un
derstand what we are aiming
for, (but) it is sometimes very
hard to get through to them."
A major factor in the Anti-
American demonstrations here
is the decision of NATO in De
cember 1979 to station 48
ground-launched cruise mis
siles in the Netherlands. They
are part of a plan to deploy a
new generation of in

termediate-range nuclear mis
siles in Europe, starting in late
1983.
The Dutch government said
it would decide by the end of
last year whether to accept the
new missiles but then delayed
the decision pending develop
ments in the Soviet-American
arms limitation discussions in
Geneva.
"The Dutch are taking a lot
of time making up their
minds," Bell said, and added,
cautiously, "It is not incon
ceivable to me that they will ul
timately say yes."
Anti-American sentiment in
the Netherlands is character
ized by a liking for Americans
and a vehement dislike of
American foreign policy.
"Americans are fine," the
owner of a coffee shop here
said, "But we think you had
had some very bad policies,
like the involvement in Viet
nam and now the effort to get
us to make more weapons."
One display of anti-Ameri
can sentiment here occurred
on Feb. 27, when about 5000
demonstrators marched to the
consulate here to protest U.S.
policy in El Salvador and other
Central American countries.
(Although Amsterdam is the
capital of the Netherlands, the
U.S. Embassy is located in The
Hague, which is the seat of gov
ernment.!
Bell described the demon
stration as small, compared to
other anti-American outbursts.
Last Nov. 21, for example,
about 400,000 people crowded

into the square in front of the
consulate to protest the missile
projects.
Still, the February protest
saw the introduction of a new
weapon here: slingshots used
to fire ball bearings and other
small steel projectiles.
"This was the first time we
experienced the use of this
weapon," Bell said, adding that
it caused considerable damage
to the building's windows.
Bricks and rocks were also
hurled, and several policemen
were injured. Bell said, how
ever, that the violence was the
work of about 200 individuals
he described as nihilists.
He emphasized that most of
the demonstrators intended a
peaceful protest and noted
that it was carried out on a Sat
urday, when the consulate was
closed.
Bell said the demonstrations
are a sign of "a very deep sense
of insecurity" among the
Dutch caused by growing eco
nomic problems, high un
employment and concern over
the threat of war.
Others say they are a man
ifestation of an intense activism
on behalf of political and hu
man rights around the world.
"These people," Bell said,
"are perhaps the most cause
oriented people in the world.
At virtually any time there are
dozens of demonstrations and
meetings taking place in all
parts of the country in support
of or opposition to a given
cause."
