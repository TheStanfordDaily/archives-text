« and often it's for worse."
| In spite of academic pressures, the shows go on. This
spring Stanford theater groups are presenting As You
Like It, Yeomen of the Guard, and The Cold Watch,
among others.
The biggest names in Stanford student theater are
Ram's Head and The Company. Ram's Head, currently
the larger and more financially secure of the two, is re
puted for the annual Gaieties and for lavish, traditional
Broadway productions in the spring.
"People know Ram's Head, there's a tradition to it,"
said Mark Swanson of Stanford Players, the newest cam
pus drama group.
"Somebody once said that Ram's Head does the col
legiate rah-rah shows, and the Company does the artsy
fartsy ones," said Noel Rosales, financial manager of the
Company. "I used to think that, but that's really not true.
Maybe we do do more offbeat things, say when we did
* Every Man in Memorial Church." The Company's popu
! lar image among students was illustrated by general im
-1 pressions of the musical Godspell.
4 "Everybody seemed to think that was a Company
2 show," said Rosales. "I suppose if someone in the Com
* pany decided to do West Side Story, everyone would say
that's got to be a Ram's Head show."
The two well-established institutions operate quite
j differently. "Ram's Head picks the staff and then picks
i the show. The Company picks a show and then finds a
! staff," explained Rosales. "And it's not really we as much
\ as any group on campus." The Company was founded
j about seven years ago to help Individuals who wanted to
! produce shows on a larger scale than the typical dorm
\ production.
j "We decide whether we would like our name on it,"
i said Rosales. Company shows are financed by the indi
■ vidual show's producers. The Company is currently not
; in the position to offer financial backing because of past
losses, Rosales said. But, its name seems to go a long way
! in boosting a show's credibility and In that way lessens
risks Involved.
"We've kept up a pretty good foundation of ex
cellence," Rosales said. Past Company shows include
The Night Thoreau Spent in Jail, Midsummer Night's
Dream, and Jesus Christ Superstar. This quarter the
group is presenting As You Like It and Lillian Hellman's
Children's Hour.
Meanwhile, Ram's Head is preparing for opening
night of Cabaret. The addition of Godspell to the regular
calendar of Gaieties in the fall, Winter One Acts and a
* spring musical has made the year a busy one for the or
ganization.
The most distinctive aspect of Ram's Head is that it is
solvent, according to Executive Producer Andy Preston.
Because most organizations at Stanford are independent
of financial backing from the University, they have to pay
for everything. And to put on a good show requires 1 a lot
of finances, he said.
Cabaret, for instance is operating on a $30,000 budget.
"In order to put on a show you have to have $30,000. You
can't wait for the ticket revenues," Preston said. "We
tend to lose money on Winter One Acts but that is inten
i tional. It's our investment in original student work."
Ram's Head was founded in September 1911 in a room
in which hung the stuffed headof a ram. Its purpose: to
present original student drama. Two months later, the
! Gaieties tradition was born in the form of a musical revue
I called The Follies. In the mid-'6os, Ram's Head was dis
i solved admidst student unrest. By 1975, theater had again
i been revived on campus, by the Company, the Stanford
; Savoyards and numerous dorms. Ram's Head was re
< vitalized in time for presentation of Guys and Dolls in
April 1976.
■ The Ram's Head tradition of presenting a popular mu
sical in the spring answers several needs, according to
Preston. It allows the organization to make some money
for its other two productions; it gives dancers on campus
a chance to perform; and it gives the Stanford communi
ty an opportunity to see a lavish musical presented by
students.
| "If Ram's Head didn't do it, no one would because
they couldn't afford to do it," Preston said.
| The list of Ram's Head spring musicals includes West
Side Story, The Music Man, Kiss Me, Kate and Pippin.
"They tend to be popular, because people like to do
■ popular shows. We can sell Cabaret. A more artsy show
might not be so easy to sell," Preston said.
The Stanford Savoyards compose the third large stu

dent theater group. The company traditionally presents
two Gilbert and Sullivan shows — one in the fall and one
in the spring. In the summer, the group presents an op
eratic show by other writers and composers.
"They have a great reputation for having a lot of fun,"
said Savoyard Marty Noss. "Savoyards has a party after
every single show and several before and even after the
show closes."
Only two Stanford students are in the cast of Yeomen
of the Guard, this year's spring production. Savoyard
casts have included professors, lawyers, doctors, staff
members and local residents. Some are seml-pro
fessional. Students involved tend to be music majors.
Because so much of the cast is not drawn frorti the stu
dent population, Savoyard plays are often ignored by
students. The exception to this was last year's Pirates of
Penzance, members said.
Another major force in Stanford's drama scene is the
Committee on Black Performing Arts, (CBPA) the um
brella organization for the Kuumba Arts Ensemble,
Kuumba Dance and the Stanford Gospel Choir. This year
the three groups are joining forces to open the Black Arts
Festival with And Still We Rise.
The Committee promotes black arts through drama,
dance and other art forms and sponsors visits by artists.
"It gives black students a chance to do black theater,
rather than have a bit part in West Side Story," said
Carmalita Marshall, the committee's program coordi
nator. "Our target audience is generally the black popu
lation."
"It's not so much that we don't get attention," she said.
"It's that we don't have the budget to operate like Ram's
Head. The Committee has its own budget, but a lot of its
goes into daily maintenance of facilities." For example,
the cost of publicity for this weekend's presentation of
Moving Together makes up about one-half of the show's
budset.
This spring Drama Prof. Sandra Richards is directing A
Star Ain't Nothin' But a Hole in Heaven, an original play
by Judi Ann Mason which will also be presented during
the Black Arts Festival in May.
While the CBPA cast has been rehearsing at Harmony
House, rehearsals have been underway at the Old Flre-

house for the Asian American Theater Project (AATP)
production of The Gold Watch. The play tells of
Japanese-American family life in Oregon around the
time of Pearl Harbor.
According to the play's director, Joan Hotelling, "The
ater is not something that a lot of Asian Americans have
done and often they haven't been able to express them
selves in serious drama," she said. It (AATP) gives people
a community and non-threatening way to get into thea
ter.
In addition, AATP productions "communicate Asian
American needs and issues to the Stanford community,"
said Hotelling. "A lot of whites in the United Staes are so
uneducated about these issues. You can look in the his
tory books and read that there were detainment camps.
That's all it says. And that's what this is for. It's for them to
find out."

Another group that showcases original student work is
Children's Theater, headed by Dawn Atkinson and
Kathryn Kelsey. This year the pioneer group is touring lo
cal schools, libraries and hospitals with a production
called Amanda and Her Magic Room. Characters in
clude a book, a clock, a Jill-in-the-Box and TV ghost.
Children's Theater started two years ago with a Man
zanita Park production of Free to Be You and Me. "We
realized, this is silly," said Kelsey. "We don't want to do
this for Stanford. We want to do it for kids."
The unexpectedly enthusiastic response from au
diences prompted Kelsey and Atkinson to do the play
Androcles and the Lion the next year.
"We found out a musical works best with kids, and it
was much more fun for us," said Atkinson.
The troupe produces its shows on a very low budget by
using old costumes and old props. It is financed by pro
gram fees and $500 from the SCIRE Innovation Fund.
"It's not a glorifying thing," said Brian Prestwich, pro
ducer of Godspell, about Children's Theater. "It's not
something you get a lot of recognition for."
"The whole point of Children's Theater is to entertain
children. The people who remembered you, and are im
pressed by you, are children," said Atkinson. "You may
end up seeing them in a Safeway and they'll say, 'You're
the bad guy in the show.' "
Because Kelsey and Atkinson are seniors, the future of
Children's Theater is uncertain. "We've been trying to
find someone to take our place as producers and direc
tors for the show," said Atkinson. "So far we haven't
found anyone to take responsibility for the whole thing.
Children's Theater can change, and we don't mind — if it
takes more of an educational push or even more of a po
litical push. There's so little of Stanford that goes out to
the community."
Theater Guild and the Undergraduate Lights Project
(ULP) round up the vital groups in student theater at
Stanford. Theater Guild serves as a technical resource
bank — providing tools, costumes, set pieces and techni
cal advice to interested parties. ULP rents out lighting
equipment. In addition, Theater Guild promotes student
theater and tries to bring student theater concerns to the
attention of the University?
One concern voiced by smaller theater groups is the
lack of suitable facilities for their productions. Memorial
Auditorium is too big, and Little Theater is usually
booked by the drama department.
"We have been working on a form whereby the
groups can give us suggestions and tell us their needs,"
said Joe Palacias of the Guild. The Guild is funded by a
fee assessment which they received last year.
Palacias is one of a small number of "techies" shared
by Stanford student theater. "There are so few of us that
we have a lot of control," he said.
"We don't get a lot of respect from the artistic people,
but there's great respect amongst us."
Palacias explained that the Ram's Head decision to do
Cabaret rather than My Fair Lady was due to the objec
tions of the "techies," who felt certain that they could
not get the technical manpower for the more lavish
show.
In spite of general suspicions of "having to know

someone/' those most involved claim to strive for objec
tivity in auditioning people for staff positions and roles.
Preston of Ram's Head said that it is his job to see that
Ram's Head guidelines are followed. This includes mak
ing sure that the auditions are open to all faculty, staff,
spouses and students. "We take the best," he said. "We
get a nice mixture from all over, even though it is under
graduate-oriented."
"If you want to get involved in a show in a meaningful
way, you can do it," said Tony Kelly, director of the
spring play Bleacher Bums. "The only obstacles are per
ceived — the idea that peole have been doing it for years
keeps people away." Kelly has departed from the Ram's
Head/Company route to put together the new Bleacher
Bums Company.
"It's a one-shot deal," he said. After seeing the play
Bleacher Bums in San Francisco last year, Kelly decided
he wanted to direct the play.
Kelly said the show could have been done with The
Company, but he said he felt the hierarchical aspects of
an established institution seemed inappropriate for
Bleacher Bums.
"There are some legitimate concerns, complaints
against the structure of student theater here," Kelly said.
"It's not necessarily they're bad, because they're
very successful in what they do. But what should be kept
in mind is that there are other ways of doing it."
"Sometimes I feel like it's an inside job and sometimes
I don't," Stanford Player's Swanson said. "Whenever you
have a student in charge, they're not necessarily going to
make the best judgments. I think everyone tries their
best not to be inside about it.
"Sometimes I have actually argued against people I
know and rallied for people I don't know. Any good di
rector goes into auditions with an objective perspective,
but some directors will take past experience into ac
count," Swanson said.
Chances of getting into a Ram's Head show vary great
iy. Actoiulng to Swanson, 60 to 70 people auditioned for
Cabaret compared to 250 for West Side Story.
"The level of talent jump from show to show," he said.
"Gaieties is a really good place for freshmen to start,"
said Kelsey. "It's a big production and it's pretty excit
ing." She said that Ram's Head auditions are open to ev
eryone. "They're dedicated to getting as many people
involved as they can."
"I wish people had a better perspective on what stu
dent theater is," Swanson reflected. "They get wrapped
up in what they are rather than In what they're doing."
He contrasted Ram's Head and Company productions to
dorm shows, which have more of a community feeling.
Other thespians expressed a desire to see more co-oper
ation among groups, as well.
Jim Lewinson of Theater Guild voiced another con
cern. "I'm seeing a lot of seniors graduating. We're sort
of reaching the end of a cycle. I wonder where It's going
to go."
"Stanford has a lot of multi-talented people. They still
like to get out their artistic elements," Atkinson said.
"There's something about theater that draws you in. It
almost always turns out to be great. That's what keeps
people coming back."

; in the position to offer financial backing because of past
losses, Rosales said. But, its name seems to go a long way
! in boosting a show's credibility and In that way lessens
risks Involved.
"We've kept up a pretty good foundation of ex
cellence," Rosales said. Past Company shows include
The Night Thoreau Spent in Jail, Midsummer Night's
Dream, and Jesus Christ Superstar. This quarter the
group is presenting As You Like It and Lillian Hellman's
Children's Hour.
Meanwhile, Ram's Head is preparing for opening
night of Cabaret. The addition of Godspell to the regular
calendar of Gaieties in the fall, Winter One Acts and a
* spring musical has made the year a busy one for the or
ganization.
The most distinctive aspect of Ram's Head is that it is
solvent, according to Executive Producer Andy Preston.
Because most organizations at Stanford are independent
of financial backing from the University, they have to pay
for everything. And to put on a good show requires 1 a lot
of finances, he said.
Cabaret, for instance is operating on a $30,000 budget.
"In order to put on a show you have to have $30,000. You
can't wait for the ticket revenues," Preston said. "We
tend to lose money on Winter One Acts but that is inten
i tional. It's our investment in original student work."
Ram's Head was founded in September 1911 in a room
in which hung the stuffed headof a ram. Its purpose: to
present original student drama. Two months later, the
! Gaieties tradition was born in the form of a musical revue
I called The Follies. In the mid-'6os, Ram's Head was dis
i solved admidst student unrest. By 1975, theater had again
i been revived on campus, by the Company, the Stanford
; Savoyards and numerous dorms. Ram's Head was re
< vitalized in time for presentation of Guys and Dolls in
April 1976.
■ The Ram's Head tradition of presenting a popular mu
sical in the spring answers several needs, according to
Preston. It allows the organization to make some money
for its other two productions; it gives dancers on campus
a chance to perform; and it gives the Stanford communi
ty an opportunity to see a lavish musical presented by
students.
| "If Ram's Head didn't do it, no one would because
they couldn't afford to do it," Preston said.
| The list of Ram's Head spring musicals includes West
Side Story, The Music Man, Kiss Me, Kate and Pippin.
"They tend to be popular, because people like to do
■ popular shows. We can sell Cabaret. A more artsy show
might not be so easy to sell," Preston said.
The Stanford Savoyards compose the third large stu

dent theater group. The company traditionally presents
two Gilbert and Sullivan shows — one in the fall and one
in the spring. In the summer, the group presents an op
eratic show by other writers and composers.
"They have a great reputation for having a lot of fun,"
said Savoyard Marty Noss. "Savoyards has a party after
every single show and several before and even after the
show closes."
Only two Stanford students are in the cast of Yeomen
of the Guard, this year's spring production. Savoyard
casts have included professors, lawyers, doctors, staff
members and local residents. Some are seml-pro
fessional. Students involved tend to be music majors.
Because so much of the cast is not drawn frorti the stu
dent population, Savoyard plays are often ignored by
students. The exception to this was last year's Pirates of
Penzance, members said.
Another major force in Stanford's drama scene is the
Committee on Black Performing Arts, (CBPA) the um
brella organization for the Kuumba Arts Ensemble,
Kuumba Dance and the Stanford Gospel Choir. This year
the three groups are joining forces to open the Black Arts
Festival with And Still We Rise.
The Committee promotes black arts through drama,
dance and other art forms and sponsors visits by artists.
"It gives black students a chance to do black theater,
rather than have a bit part in West Side Story," said
Carmalita Marshall, the committee's program coordi
nator. "Our target audience is generally the black popu
lation."
"It's not so much that we don't get attention," she said.
"It's that we don't have the budget to operate like Ram's
Head. The Committee has its own budget, but a lot of its
goes into daily maintenance of facilities." For example,
the cost of publicity for this weekend's presentation of
Moving Together makes up about one-half of the show's
budset.
This spring Drama Prof. Sandra Richards is directing A
Star Ain't Nothin' But a Hole in Heaven, an original play
by Judi Ann Mason which will also be presented during
the Black Arts Festival in May.
While the CBPA cast has been rehearsing at Harmony
House, rehearsals have been underway at the Old Flre-

house for the Asian American Theater Project (AATP)
production of The Gold Watch. The play tells of
Japanese-American family life in Oregon around the
time of Pearl Harbor.
According to the play's director, Joan Hotelling, "The
ater is not something that a lot of Asian Americans have
done and often they haven't been able to express them
selves in serious drama," she said. It (AATP) gives people
a community and non-threatening way to get into thea
ter.
In addition, AATP productions "communicate Asian
American needs and issues to the Stanford community,"
said Hotelling. "A lot of whites in the United Staes are so
uneducated about these issues. You can look in the his
tory books and read that there were detainment camps.
That's all it says. And that's what this is for. It's for them to
find out."

Another group that showcases original student work is
Children's Theater, headed by Dawn Atkinson and
Kathryn Kelsey. This year the pioneer group is touring lo
cal schools, libraries and hospitals with a production
called Amanda and Her Magic Room. Characters in
clude a book, a clock, a Jill-in-the-Box and TV ghost.
Children's Theater started two years ago with a Man
zanita Park production of Free to Be You and Me. "We
realized, this is silly," said Kelsey. "We don't want to do
this for Stanford. We want to do it for kids."
The unexpectedly enthusiastic response from au
diences prompted Kelsey and Atkinson to do the play
Androcles and the Lion the next year.
"We found out a musical works best with kids, and it
was much more fun for us," said Atkinson.
The troupe produces its shows on a very low budget by
using old costumes and old props. It is financed by pro
gram fees and $500 from the SCIRE Innovation Fund.
"It's not a glorifying thing," said Brian Prestwich, pro
ducer of Godspell, about Children's Theater. "It's not
something you get a lot of recognition for."
"The whole point of Children's Theater is to entertain
children. The people who remembered you, and are im
pressed by you, are children," said Atkinson. "You may
end up seeing them in a Safeway and they'll say, 'You're
the bad guy in the show.' "
Because Kelsey and Atkinson are seniors, the future of
Children's Theater is uncertain. "We've been trying to
find someone to take our place as producers and direc
tors for the show," said Atkinson. "So far we haven't
found anyone to take responsibility for the whole thing.
Children's Theater can change, and we don't mind — if it
takes more of an educational push or even more of a po
litical push. There's so little of Stanford that goes out to
the community."
Theater Guild and the Undergraduate Lights Project
(ULP) round up the vital groups in student theater at
Stanford. Theater Guild serves as a technical resource
bank — providing tools, costumes, set pieces and techni
cal advice to interested parties. ULP rents out lighting
equipment. In addition, Theater Guild promotes student
theater and tries to bring student theater concerns to the
attention of the University?
One concern voiced by smaller theater groups is the
lack of suitable facilities for their productions. Memorial
Auditorium is too big, and Little Theater is usually
booked by the drama department.
"We have been working on a form whereby the
groups can give us suggestions and tell us their needs,"
said Joe Palacias of the Guild. The Guild is funded by a
fee assessment which they received last year.
Palacias is one of a small number of "techies" shared
by Stanford student theater. "There are so few of us that
we have a lot of control," he said.
"We don't get a lot of respect from the artistic people,
but there's great respect amongst us."
Palacias explained that the Ram's Head decision to do
Cabaret rather than My Fair Lady was due to the objec
tions of the "techies," who felt certain that they could
not get the technical manpower for the more lavish
show.
In spite of general suspicions of "having to know

someone/' those most involved claim to strive for objec
tivity in auditioning people for staff positions and roles.
Preston of Ram's Head said that it is his job to see that
Ram's Head guidelines are followed. This includes mak
ing sure that the auditions are open to all faculty, staff,
spouses and students. "We take the best," he said. "We
get a nice mixture from all over, even though it is under
graduate-oriented."
"If you want to get involved in a show in a meaningful
way, you can do it," said Tony Kelly, director of the
spring play Bleacher Bums. "The only obstacles are per
ceived — the idea that peole have been doing it for years
keeps people away." Kelly has departed from the Ram's
Head/Company route to put together the new Bleacher
Bums Company.
"It's a one-shot deal," he said. After seeing the play
Bleacher Bums in San Francisco last year, Kelly decided
he wanted to direct the play.
Kelly said the show could have been done with The
Company, but he said he felt the hierarchical aspects of
an established institution seemed inappropriate for
Bleacher Bums.
"There are some legitimate concerns, complaints
against the structure of student theater here," Kelly said.
"It's not necessarily they're bad, because they're
very successful in what they do. But what should be kept
in mind is that there are other ways of doing it."
"Sometimes I feel like it's an inside job and sometimes
I don't," Stanford Player's Swanson said. "Whenever you
have a student in charge, they're not necessarily going to
make the best judgments. I think everyone tries their
best not to be inside about it.
"Sometimes I have actually argued against people I
know and rallied for people I don't know. Any good di
rector goes into auditions with an objective perspective,
but some directors will take past experience into ac
count," Swanson said.
Chances of getting into a Ram's Head show vary great
iy. Actoiulng to Swanson, 60 to 70 people auditioned for
Cabaret compared to 250 for West Side Story.
"The level of talent jump from show to show," he said.
"Gaieties is a really good place for freshmen to start,"
said Kelsey. "It's a big production and it's pretty excit
ing." She said that Ram's Head auditions are open to ev
eryone. "They're dedicated to getting as many people
involved as they can."
"I wish people had a better perspective on what stu
dent theater is," Swanson reflected. "They get wrapped
up in what they are rather than In what they're doing."
He contrasted Ram's Head and Company productions to
dorm shows, which have more of a community feeling.
Other thespians expressed a desire to see more co-oper
ation among groups, as well.
Jim Lewinson of Theater Guild voiced another con
cern. "I'm seeing a lot of seniors graduating. We're sort
of reaching the end of a cycle. I wonder where It's going
to go."
"Stanford has a lot of multi-talented people. They still
like to get out their artistic elements," Atkinson said.
"There's something about theater that draws you in. It
almost always turns out to be great. That's what keeps
people coming back."

Ram's Head and The Company. Ram's Head, currently
the larger and more financially secure of the two, is re

they couldn't afford to do it," Preston said.
| The list of Ram's Head spring musicals includes West
Side Story, The Music Man, Kiss Me, Kate and Pippin.
"They tend to be popular, because people like to do
■ popular shows. We can sell Cabaret. A more artsy show
might not be so easy to sell," Preston said.
The Stanford Savoyards compose the third large stu

dent theater group. The company traditionally presents
two Gilbert and Sullivan shows — one in the fall and one
in the spring. In the summer, the group presents an op
eratic show by other writers and composers.
"They have a great reputation for having a lot of fun,"
said Savoyard Marty Noss. "Savoyards has a party after
every single show and several before and even after the
show closes."
Only two Stanford students are in the cast of Yeomen
of the Guard, this year's spring production. Savoyard
casts have included professors, lawyers, doctors, staff
members and local residents. Some are seml-pro
fessional. Students involved tend to be music majors.
Because so much of the cast is not drawn frorti the stu
dent population, Savoyard plays are often ignored by
students. The exception to this was last year's Pirates of
Penzance, members said.
Another major force in Stanford's drama scene is the
Committee on Black Performing Arts, (CBPA) the um
brella organization for the Kuumba Arts Ensemble,
Kuumba Dance and the Stanford Gospel Choir. This year
the three groups are joining forces to open the Black Arts
Festival with And Still We Rise.
The Committee promotes black arts through drama,
dance and other art forms and sponsors visits by artists.
"It gives black students a chance to do black theater,
rather than have a bit part in West Side Story," said
Carmalita Marshall, the committee's program coordi
nator. "Our target audience is generally the black popu
lation."
"It's not so much that we don't get attention," she said.
"It's that we don't have the budget to operate like Ram's
Head. The Committee has its own budget, but a lot of its
goes into daily maintenance of facilities." For example,
the cost of publicity for this weekend's presentation of
Moving Together makes up about one-half of the show's
budset.
This spring Drama Prof. Sandra Richards is directing A
Star Ain't Nothin' But a Hole in Heaven, an original play
by Judi Ann Mason which will also be presented during
the Black Arts Festival in May.
While the CBPA cast has been rehearsing at Harmony
House, rehearsals have been underway at the Old Flre-

house for the Asian American Theater Project (AATP)
production of The Gold Watch. The play tells of
Japanese-American family life in Oregon around the
time of Pearl Harbor.
According to the play's director, Joan Hotelling, "The
ater is not something that a lot of Asian Americans have
done and often they haven't been able to express them
selves in serious drama," she said. It (AATP) gives people
a community and non-threatening way to get into thea
ter.
In addition, AATP productions "communicate Asian
American needs and issues to the Stanford community,"
said Hotelling. "A lot of whites in the United Staes are so
uneducated about these issues. You can look in the his
tory books and read that there were detainment camps.
That's all it says. And that's what this is for. It's for them to
find out."

Another group that showcases original student work is
Children's Theater, headed by Dawn Atkinson and
Kathryn Kelsey. This year the pioneer group is touring lo
cal schools, libraries and hospitals with a production
called Amanda and Her Magic Room. Characters in
clude a book, a clock, a Jill-in-the-Box and TV ghost.
Children's Theater started two years ago with a Man
zanita Park production of Free to Be You and Me. "We
realized, this is silly," said Kelsey. "We don't want to do
this for Stanford. We want to do it for kids."
The unexpectedly enthusiastic response from au
diences prompted Kelsey and Atkinson to do the play
Androcles and the Lion the next year.
"We found out a musical works best with kids, and it
was much more fun for us," said Atkinson.
The troupe produces its shows on a very low budget by
using old costumes and old props. It is financed by pro
gram fees and $500 from the SCIRE Innovation Fund.
"It's not a glorifying thing," said Brian Prestwich, pro
ducer of Godspell, about Children's Theater. "It's not
something you get a lot of recognition for."
"The whole point of Children's Theater is to entertain
children. The people who remembered you, and are im
pressed by you, are children," said Atkinson. "You may
end up seeing them in a Safeway and they'll say, 'You're
the bad guy in the show.' "
Because Kelsey and Atkinson are seniors, the future of
Children's Theater is uncertain. "We've been trying to
find someone to take our place as producers and direc
tors for the show," said Atkinson. "So far we haven't
found anyone to take responsibility for the whole thing.
Children's Theater can change, and we don't mind — if it
takes more of an educational push or even more of a po
litical push. There's so little of Stanford that goes out to
the community."
Theater Guild and the Undergraduate Lights Project
(ULP) round up the vital groups in student theater at
Stanford. Theater Guild serves as a technical resource
bank — providing tools, costumes, set pieces and techni
cal advice to interested parties. ULP rents out lighting
equipment. In addition, Theater Guild promotes student
theater and tries to bring student theater concerns to the
attention of the University?
One concern voiced by smaller theater groups is the
lack of suitable facilities for their productions. Memorial
Auditorium is too big, and Little Theater is usually
booked by the drama department.
"We have been working on a form whereby the
groups can give us suggestions and tell us their needs,"
said Joe Palacias of the Guild. The Guild is funded by a
fee assessment which they received last year.
Palacias is one of a small number of "techies" shared
by Stanford student theater. "There are so few of us that
we have a lot of control," he said.
"We don't get a lot of respect from the artistic people,
but there's great respect amongst us."
Palacias explained that the Ram's Head decision to do
Cabaret rather than My Fair Lady was due to the objec
tions of the "techies," who felt certain that they could
not get the technical manpower for the more lavish
show.
In spite of general suspicions of "having to know

someone/' those most involved claim to strive for objec
tivity in auditioning people for staff positions and roles.
Preston of Ram's Head said that it is his job to see that
Ram's Head guidelines are followed. This includes mak
ing sure that the auditions are open to all faculty, staff,
spouses and students. "We take the best," he said. "We
get a nice mixture from all over, even though it is under
graduate-oriented."
"If you want to get involved in a show in a meaningful
way, you can do it," said Tony Kelly, director of the
spring play Bleacher Bums. "The only obstacles are per
ceived — the idea that peole have been doing it for years
keeps people away." Kelly has departed from the Ram's
Head/Company route to put together the new Bleacher
Bums Company.
"It's a one-shot deal," he said. After seeing the play
Bleacher Bums in San Francisco last year, Kelly decided
he wanted to direct the play.
Kelly said the show could have been done with The
Company, but he said he felt the hierarchical aspects of
an established institution seemed inappropriate for
Bleacher Bums.
"There are some legitimate concerns, complaints
against the structure of student theater here," Kelly said.
"It's not necessarily they're bad, because they're
very successful in what they do. But what should be kept
in mind is that there are other ways of doing it."
"Sometimes I feel like it's an inside job and sometimes
I don't," Stanford Player's Swanson said. "Whenever you
have a student in charge, they're not necessarily going to
make the best judgments. I think everyone tries their
best not to be inside about it.
"Sometimes I have actually argued against people I
know and rallied for people I don't know. Any good di
rector goes into auditions with an objective perspective,
but some directors will take past experience into ac
count," Swanson said.
Chances of getting into a Ram's Head show vary great
iy. Actoiulng to Swanson, 60 to 70 people auditioned for
Cabaret compared to 250 for West Side Story.
"The level of talent jump from show to show," he said.
"Gaieties is a really good place for freshmen to start,"
said Kelsey. "It's a big production and it's pretty excit
ing." She said that Ram's Head auditions are open to ev
eryone. "They're dedicated to getting as many people
involved as they can."
"I wish people had a better perspective on what stu
dent theater is," Swanson reflected. "They get wrapped
up in what they are rather than In what they're doing."
He contrasted Ram's Head and Company productions to
dorm shows, which have more of a community feeling.
Other thespians expressed a desire to see more co-oper
ation among groups, as well.
Jim Lewinson of Theater Guild voiced another con
cern. "I'm seeing a lot of seniors graduating. We're sort
of reaching the end of a cycle. I wonder where It's going
to go."
"Stanford has a lot of multi-talented people. They still
like to get out their artistic elements," Atkinson said.
"There's something about theater that draws you in. It
almost always turns out to be great. That's what keeps
people coming back."

* "It's so hard to get away from academla," added Marty
j Noss. You have to put that aside for better or for worse,
« and often it's for worse."
| In spite of academic pressures, the shows go on. This
spring Stanford theater groups are presenting As You
Like It, Yeomen of the Guard, and The Cold Watch,
among others.
The biggest names in Stanford student theater are
Ram's Head and The Company. Ram's Head, currently
the larger and more financially secure of the two, is re
puted for the annual Gaieties and for lavish, traditional
Broadway productions in the spring.
"People know Ram's Head, there's a tradition to it,"
said Mark Swanson of Stanford Players, the newest cam
pus drama group.
"Somebody once said that Ram's Head does the col
legiate rah-rah shows, and the Company does the artsy
fartsy ones," said Noel Rosales, financial manager of the
Company. "I used to think that, but that's really not true.
Maybe we do do more offbeat things, say when we did
* Every Man in Memorial Church." The Company's popu
! lar image among students was illustrated by general im
-1 pressions of the musical Godspell.
4 "Everybody seemed to think that was a Company
2 show," said Rosales. "I suppose if someone in the Com
* pany decided to do West Side Story, everyone would say
that's got to be a Ram's Head show."
The two well-established institutions operate quite
j differently. "Ram's Head picks the staff and then picks
i the show. The Company picks a show and then finds a
! staff," explained Rosales. "And it's not really we as much
\ as any group on campus." The Company was founded
j about seven years ago to help Individuals who wanted to
! produce shows on a larger scale than the typical dorm
\ production.
j "We decide whether we would like our name on it,"
i said Rosales. Company shows are financed by the indi
■ vidual show's producers. The Company is currently not
; in the position to offer financial backing because of past
losses, Rosales said. But, its name seems to go a long way
! in boosting a show's credibility and In that way lessens
risks Involved.
"We've kept up a pretty good foundation of ex
cellence," Rosales said. Past Company shows include
The Night Thoreau Spent in Jail, Midsummer Night's
Dream, and Jesus Christ Superstar. This quarter the
group is presenting As You Like It and Lillian Hellman's
Children's Hour.
Meanwhile, Ram's Head is preparing for opening
night of Cabaret. The addition of Godspell to the regular
calendar of Gaieties in the fall, Winter One Acts and a
* spring musical has made the year a busy one for the or
ganization.
The most distinctive aspect of Ram's Head is that it is
solvent, according to Executive Producer Andy Preston.
Because most organizations at Stanford are independent
of financial backing from the University, they have to pay
for everything. And to put on a good show requires 1 a lot
of finances, he said.
Cabaret, for instance is operating on a $30,000 budget.
"In order to put on a show you have to have $30,000. You
can't wait for the ticket revenues," Preston said. "We
tend to lose money on Winter One Acts but that is inten
i tional. It's our investment in original student work."
Ram's Head was founded in September 1911 in a room
in which hung the stuffed headof a ram. Its purpose: to
present original student drama. Two months later, the
! Gaieties tradition was born in the form of a musical revue
I called The Follies. In the mid-'6os, Ram's Head was dis
i solved admidst student unrest. By 1975, theater had again
i been revived on campus, by the Company, the Stanford
; Savoyards and numerous dorms. Ram's Head was re
< vitalized in time for presentation of Guys and Dolls in
April 1976.
■ The Ram's Head tradition of presenting a popular mu
sical in the spring answers several needs, according to
Preston. It allows the organization to make some money
for its other two productions; it gives dancers on campus
a chance to perform; and it gives the Stanford communi
ty an opportunity to see a lavish musical presented by
students.

house for the Asian American Theater Project (AATP)
production of The Gold Watch. The play tells of
Japanese-American family life in Oregon around the
time of Pearl Harbor.
According to the play's director, Joan Hotelling, "The
ater is not something that a lot of Asian Americans have
done and often they haven't been able to express them
selves in serious drama," she said. It (AATP) gives people
a community and non-threatening way to get into thea
ter.
In addition, AATP productions "communicate Asian
American needs and issues to the Stanford community,"
said Hotelling. "A lot of whites in the United Staes are so
uneducated about these issues. You can look in the his
tory books and read that there were detainment camps.
That's all it says. And that's what this is for. It's for them to
find out."

Another group that showcases original student work is
Children's Theater, headed by Dawn Atkinson and
Kathryn Kelsey. This year the pioneer group is touring lo
cal schools, libraries and hospitals with a production
called Amanda and Her Magic Room. Characters in
clude a book, a clock, a Jill-in-the-Box and TV ghost.
Children's Theater started two years ago with a Man
zanita Park production of Free to Be You and Me. "We
realized, this is silly," said Kelsey. "We don't want to do
this for Stanford. We want to do it for kids."
The unexpectedly enthusiastic response from au
diences prompted Kelsey and Atkinson to do the play
Androcles and the Lion the next year.
"We found out a musical works best with kids, and it
was much more fun for us," said Atkinson.
The troupe produces its shows on a very low budget by
using old costumes and old props. It is financed by pro
gram fees and $500 from the SCIRE Innovation Fund.
"It's not a glorifying thing," said Brian Prestwich, pro
ducer of Godspell, about Children's Theater. "It's not
something you get a lot of recognition for."
"The whole point of Children's Theater is to entertain
children. The people who remembered you, and are im
pressed by you, are children," said Atkinson. "You may
end up seeing them in a Safeway and they'll say, 'You're
the bad guy in the show.' "
Because Kelsey and Atkinson are seniors, the future of
Children's Theater is uncertain. "We've been trying to
find someone to take our place as producers and direc
tors for the show," said Atkinson. "So far we haven't
found anyone to take responsibility for the whole thing.
Children's Theater can change, and we don't mind — if it
takes more of an educational push or even more of a po
litical push. There's so little of Stanford that goes out to
the community."
Theater Guild and the Undergraduate Lights Project
(ULP) round up the vital groups in student theater at
Stanford. Theater Guild serves as a technical resource
bank — providing tools, costumes, set pieces and techni
cal advice to interested parties. ULP rents out lighting
equipment. In addition, Theater Guild promotes student
theater and tries to bring student theater concerns to the
attention of the University?
One concern voiced by smaller theater groups is the
lack of suitable facilities for their productions. Memorial
Auditorium is too big, and Little Theater is usually
booked by the drama department.
"We have been working on a form whereby the
groups can give us suggestions and tell us their needs,"
said Joe Palacias of the Guild. The Guild is funded by a
fee assessment which they received last year.
Palacias is one of a small number of "techies" shared
by Stanford student theater. "There are so few of us that
we have a lot of control," he said.
"We don't get a lot of respect from the artistic people,
but there's great respect amongst us."
Palacias explained that the Ram's Head decision to do
Cabaret rather than My Fair Lady was due to the objec
tions of the "techies," who felt certain that they could
not get the technical manpower for the more lavish
show.
In spite of general suspicions of "having to know

someone/' those most involved claim to strive for objec
tivity in auditioning people for staff positions and roles.
Preston of Ram's Head said that it is his job to see that
Ram's Head guidelines are followed. This includes mak
ing sure that the auditions are open to all faculty, staff,
spouses and students. "We take the best," he said. "We
get a nice mixture from all over, even though it is under
graduate-oriented."
"If you want to get involved in a show in a meaningful
way, you can do it," said Tony Kelly, director of the
spring play Bleacher Bums. "The only obstacles are per
ceived — the idea that peole have been doing it for years
keeps people away." Kelly has departed from the Ram's
Head/Company route to put together the new Bleacher
Bums Company.
"It's a one-shot deal," he said. After seeing the play
Bleacher Bums in San Francisco last year, Kelly decided
he wanted to direct the play.
Kelly said the show could have been done with The
Company, but he said he felt the hierarchical aspects of
an established institution seemed inappropriate for
Bleacher Bums.
"There are some legitimate concerns, complaints
against the structure of student theater here," Kelly said.
"It's not necessarily they're bad, because they're
very successful in what they do. But what should be kept
in mind is that there are other ways of doing it."
"Sometimes I feel like it's an inside job and sometimes
I don't," Stanford Player's Swanson said. "Whenever you
have a student in charge, they're not necessarily going to
make the best judgments. I think everyone tries their
best not to be inside about it.
"Sometimes I have actually argued against people I
know and rallied for people I don't know. Any good di
rector goes into auditions with an objective perspective,
but some directors will take past experience into ac
count," Swanson said.
Chances of getting into a Ram's Head show vary great
iy. Actoiulng to Swanson, 60 to 70 people auditioned for
Cabaret compared to 250 for West Side Story.
"The level of talent jump from show to show," he said.
"Gaieties is a really good place for freshmen to start,"
said Kelsey. "It's a big production and it's pretty excit
ing." She said that Ram's Head auditions are open to ev
eryone. "They're dedicated to getting as many people
involved as they can."
"I wish people had a better perspective on what stu
dent theater is," Swanson reflected. "They get wrapped
up in what they are rather than In what they're doing."
He contrasted Ram's Head and Company productions to
dorm shows, which have more of a community feeling.
Other thespians expressed a desire to see more co-oper
ation among groups, as well.
Jim Lewinson of Theater Guild voiced another con
cern. "I'm seeing a lot of seniors graduating. We're sort
of reaching the end of a cycle. I wonder where It's going
to go."
"Stanford has a lot of multi-talented people. They still
like to get out their artistic elements," Atkinson said.
"There's something about theater that draws you in. It
almost always turns out to be great. That's what keeps
people coming back."

There's no theater like student theater: grease paint
J and battered scripts lying with ignored textbooks and
J forgotten term papers; pre-meds, pre-laws, engineers
. and aspiring artists transformed into Shakesperean char
, acters and popular Broadway figures...
* "It's so different from school/' said Jill Tobin of Stan
» ford Savoyards. "It's like going into another world."
* "It's so hard to get away from academla," added Marty
j Noss. You have to put that aside for better or for worse,
« and often it's for worse."
| In spite of academic pressures, the shows go on. This
spring Stanford theater groups are presenting As You
Like It, Yeomen of the Guard, and The Cold Watch,
among others.
The biggest names in Stanford student theater are
Ram's Head and The Company. Ram's Head, currently
the larger and more financially secure of the two, is re
puted for the annual Gaieties and for lavish, traditional
Broadway productions in the spring.
"People know Ram's Head, there's a tradition to it,"
said Mark Swanson of Stanford Players, the newest cam
pus drama group.
"Somebody once said that Ram's Head does the col
legiate rah-rah shows, and the Company does the artsy
fartsy ones," said Noel Rosales, financial manager of the
Company. "I used to think that, but that's really not true.
Maybe we do do more offbeat things, say when we did
* Every Man in Memorial Church." The Company's popu
! lar image among students was illustrated by general im
-1 pressions of the musical Godspell.
4 "Everybody seemed to think that was a Company
2 show," said Rosales. "I suppose if someone in the Com
* pany decided to do West Side Story, everyone would say
that's got to be a Ram's Head show."
The two well-established institutions operate quite
j differently. "Ram's Head picks the staff and then picks
i the show. The Company picks a show and then finds a
! staff," explained Rosales. "And it's not really we as much
\ as any group on campus." The Company was founded
j about seven years ago to help Individuals who wanted to
! produce shows on a larger scale than the typical dorm
\ production.
j "We decide whether we would like our name on it,"
i said Rosales. Company shows are financed by the indi
■ vidual show's producers. The Company is currently not
; in the position to offer financial backing because of past
losses, Rosales said. But, its name seems to go a long way
! in boosting a show's credibility and In that way lessens
risks Involved.
"We've kept up a pretty good foundation of ex
cellence," Rosales said. Past Company shows include
The Night Thoreau Spent in Jail, Midsummer Night's
Dream, and Jesus Christ Superstar. This quarter the
group is presenting As You Like It and Lillian Hellman's
Children's Hour.
Meanwhile, Ram's Head is preparing for opening
night of Cabaret. The addition of Godspell to the regular
calendar of Gaieties in the fall, Winter One Acts and a
* spring musical has made the year a busy one for the or
ganization.
The most distinctive aspect of Ram's Head is that it is
solvent, according to Executive Producer Andy Preston.
Because most organizations at Stanford are independent
of financial backing from the University, they have to pay
for everything. And to put on a good show requires 1 a lot
of finances, he said.
Cabaret, for instance is operating on a $30,000 budget.
"In order to put on a show you have to have $30,000. You
can't wait for the ticket revenues," Preston said. "We
tend to lose money on Winter One Acts but that is inten
i tional. It's our investment in original student work."
Ram's Head was founded in September 1911 in a room
in which hung the stuffed headof a ram. Its purpose: to
present original student drama. Two months later, the
! Gaieties tradition was born in the form of a musical revue
I called The Follies. In the mid-'6os, Ram's Head was dis
i solved admidst student unrest. By 1975, theater had again
i been revived on campus, by the Company, the Stanford
; Savoyards and numerous dorms. Ram's Head was re
< vitalized in time for presentation of Guys and Dolls in
April 1976.
■ The Ram's Head tradition of presenting a popular mu
sical in the spring answers several needs, according to
Preston. It allows the organization to make some money
for its other two productions; it gives dancers on campus
a chance to perform; and it gives the Stanford communi
ty an opportunity to see a lavish musical presented by
students.
| "If Ram's Head didn't do it, no one would because
they couldn't afford to do it," Preston said.
| The list of Ram's Head spring musicals includes West
Side Story, The Music Man, Kiss Me, Kate and Pippin.
"They tend to be popular, because people like to do
■ popular shows. We can sell Cabaret. A more artsy show
might not be so easy to sell," Preston said.
The Stanford Savoyards compose the third large stu

dent theater group. The company traditionally presents
two Gilbert and Sullivan shows — one in the fall and one
in the spring. In the summer, the group presents an op
eratic show by other writers and composers.
"They have a great reputation for having a lot of fun,"
said Savoyard Marty Noss. "Savoyards has a party after
every single show and several before and even after the
show closes."
Only two Stanford students are in the cast of Yeomen
of the Guard, this year's spring production. Savoyard
casts have included professors, lawyers, doctors, staff
members and local residents. Some are seml-pro
fessional. Students involved tend to be music majors.
Because so much of the cast is not drawn frorti the stu
dent population, Savoyard plays are often ignored by
students. The exception to this was last year's Pirates of
Penzance, members said.
Another major force in Stanford's drama scene is the
Committee on Black Performing Arts, (CBPA) the um
brella organization for the Kuumba Arts Ensemble,
Kuumba Dance and the Stanford Gospel Choir. This year
the three groups are joining forces to open the Black Arts
Festival with And Still We Rise.
The Committee promotes black arts through drama,
dance and other art forms and sponsors visits by artists.
"It gives black students a chance to do black theater,
rather than have a bit part in West Side Story," said
Carmalita Marshall, the committee's program coordi
nator. "Our target audience is generally the black popu
lation."
"It's not so much that we don't get attention," she said.
"It's that we don't have the budget to operate like Ram's
Head. The Committee has its own budget, but a lot of its
goes into daily maintenance of facilities." For example,
the cost of publicity for this weekend's presentation of
Moving Together makes up about one-half of the show's
budset.
This spring Drama Prof. Sandra Richards is directing A
Star Ain't Nothin' But a Hole in Heaven, an original play
by Judi Ann Mason which will also be presented during
the Black Arts Festival in May.
