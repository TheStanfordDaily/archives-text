"Who is Stephen Sondheim?" the flyer challenges.
The Stanford Players will tell you — but then, who are
they? Just three months old, the drama group respon
sible for the current production of Side By Side By
Sondheim is as unknown a factor to most students
here as the show itself.
The driving forc6 behind this new group is Mark
Swanson, a veteran of Stanford's drama scene.
Swanson's idea of a group specializing in musical re
vues was dreamed up during finals week of fall quar
ter.
A senior, Swanson had gained experience with the
musical revue as a member of the original cast of the
now dissolved Ram's Head Revue.
"I thought there was need for this particular form of
musical entertainment, and I thought there should be
more than just a roving troupe. If you have a show, it's
more tangible for people to work towards."
Side by Side By Sondheim, the group's first produc
tion, is a revue of the best works of lyricist and com
poser Stephen Sondheim. Sondheim's works include
songs from West Side Story, A Little Night Music,
Company, and Sweeney Todd.
Possibilities for future Stanford Players' projects in
clude such shows as Ain't Misbehavin, Cole, and
Tomfoolery. But the group's future hangs on whether
or not Side by Side survives financially. Side by Side is
based on a $4400 budget, but since the group has no

real funds, it has operated by purchasing on credit
through an ASSU account. Swanson, the producer
and male lead picked up the tab for royalties.
"That's why we really need the money. I would nev
er do this again/' Swanson said. "I would make sure I
have a basis for funding."
Disappointing attendance at the show's opening
weekend in Cubberley Auditorium seems partly a re
sult of the group's newness. "There's a credibility
gap/' Swanson explained. "If I had said Ram's Head,
people would have come to it. I assumed people
would come for the show, not for the name, but I've
learned that lesson."
As it turned out, Side By Side By Sondheim also
proved to be an unfamiliar show to the general Stan
ford audience.
"The show has a following among the drama
circles. But people really haven't heard of it that
much. You always forget that if you're not in the dra
ma crowd, there are only a few shows that people
have really heard about," Swanson said.
Though the future of Stanford Players Is uncertain,
Swanson, who is majoring in history and economics,
continues to harbor hopes that Side flyS/de*willstarta
tradition.
"What I'll try to do is have interviews for executive
producer. I'll let him or her take over. If they have a
different interpretation, that's fine. But this should re
main a musical revue."
