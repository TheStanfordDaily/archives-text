## Don't censor pornagraphy 
### 
The several hundred people
packed into Dinkelspiel auditorium
last Friday night for Pornography: the
image and the industry doubtless felt
that they were getting their fee
assessments' worth. Three radical
feminists, Visiting Law Prof. Cather
ine MacKinnon, writer Andrea
Dworkin and Linda Marciano (for
merly Linda Lovelace), were pitted
against the chairman of the Playboy
Foundation, Burton Joseph.
Outnumbered though he was,
Joseph enjoyed an important advan
tage; his argument was simple. The
first amendment guarantees free
dom of expression and in order to
guarantee the first amendment , so
ciety must permit pomographers to
ply their trade.
The feminist arguments, on the
other hand, suffered for their com
plexity. The freedom of the porno
grapher to release his material exists
at the expense of an equal role for
women in society, in their opinion,
because pornography reinforces cer
tain conceptions which subjugate
women. Perhaps, the advantage of
simplicity proved to be a decisive
one.
The issue of censorship dominated
the question and answer session at
the expense of the opportunity to ex
plore the more subtle feminist argu
ments. The focus of the debate was
shifted from questioning the effect of
pornography on society to defend
ing the right of pornography to be
expressed, a shift which unfortunate
ly allowed Joseph to escape answer
ing many of the feminist charges and
which prevented the debate from
becoming all it could have been. I
think this need not have been the
case. Although critical of the limited
relevance of the first amendment
for women, MacKinnon ultimately
rejected the idea of prior restraint by

the state on which so much of
Joseph's argument has premised.
In her opening remarks, MacKin
non asserted that "the social precon
ditions, the presumptions that under
lie the first amendment do not app
ly to women."
Radical feminists have trouble get
ting published and the "context of
radical inequality between sexes"
strips the idea of a free and open ex
change of ideas of any meaning.
The free and open exchange of
ideas which free speech is supposed
to engender cannot take place in the
"context of radical inequality be
tween sexes." In subsequent re
marks, Dworkin spoke of the difficul
ty radical feminists experience in get
ting published and contrasted
against the considerable market that
exists for pornographic materials.
According to MacKinnon and
Dworkin, pornography erodes the
already tenuous position of women
in society. Through its objectification
of women, pornography perpetuates
male dominance. Furthermore,
pornography has the insidious effect
of silencing its victims. The degrada
tion of women which they assert
pornography encourages often
leaves its victims too humiliated to
exercise their right of speech in pro
test.
If one accepts the feminist argu
ment that the ideology of male domi
nance which oppresses them is an
almost inseparable part of our sex
uality and our society, then logically
any censor's definition of porno
graphy could and would be used
against the feminist cause as well as
towards other ends.
Such arguments seem to me an in
sufficient justification for censorship
by government authority. What
almost escaped my attention during
the debate, however, and what al
luded some others as well, was that
MacKinnon's analysis stopped short
of calling for prior restraint by the
state.
Although she criticized Joseph for
defining her approach against
pornography as being one of
censorship, she failed in her opening

remarks to define what exactly her
approach was. I believe that this am
biguity combined with her critical
analysis of the first amendment to
suggest to many that she did not rule
out the censor's pen as a tool of social
progress.
Not surprisingly, MacKinnon was
asked early in the question and an
swer session to define her position
on censorship. Referring to
censorship by the state, she re
marked that "suppressing it (porno
graphy) ... enhances its value ... as
erotic stuff and what I'm interested in
doing is delegitimatizing its value."
When the crowd pressed her to be
more precise, she said, "I don't see
any way, any, any simple quick fix le
gal answer." Although far from an
unequivocal rejection of further le
gal restraints on the publication of
pornography, this statement should
have laid to rest the spectre of
censorship which had haunted the
feminist perspective. Unfortunately,
many had already drawn the lines of
battle after the opening volley of re
marks and the issue of censorship
continued to be raised.
Had MacKinnon's rejection of
censorship been earlier and more
forthrightly stated or had her subse
quent remarks been more carefully
received, I think we would have seen
a different debate. The same argu
ments which seem insufficient justifi
cation for prior restraint by the state
seem a reasonable justification for
prior restraint by the individual.Once
I realized that I was being asked not
to endorse a program for censorship
but to consider a rationale for con
demning pornography on a personal
basis, the degree of consideration
which I gave to the feminist argu
ments greatly increased.
Voltaire is reputed to have said, "I
disagree with what you say, but I de
fend to the death your right to say it."
For tactical reasons, if not pure ideol :
ogical ones, I suggest that feminist
critics of pornography say the same.

The several hundred people
packed into Dinkelspiel auditorium
last Friday night for Pornography: the
image and the industry doubtless felt
that they were getting their fee
assessments' worth. Three radical
feminists, Visiting Law Prof. Cather
ine MacKinnon, writer Andrea
Dworkin and Linda Marciano (for
merly Linda Lovelace), were pitted
against the chairman of the Playboy
Foundation, Burton Joseph.
Outnumbered though he was,
Joseph enjoyed an important advan
tage; his argument was simple. The
first amendment guarantees free
dom of expression and in order to
guarantee the first amendment , so
ciety must permit pomographers to
ply their trade.
The feminist arguments, on the
other hand, suffered for their com
plexity. The freedom of the porno
grapher to release his material exists
at the expense of an equal role for
women in society, in their opinion,
because pornography reinforces cer
tain conceptions which subjugate
women. Perhaps, the advantage of
simplicity proved to be a decisive
one.
The issue of censorship dominated
the question and answer session at
the expense of the opportunity to ex
plore the more subtle feminist argu
ments. The focus of the debate was
shifted from questioning the effect of
pornography on society to defend
ing the right of pornography to be
expressed, a shift which unfortunate
ly allowed Joseph to escape answer
ing many of the feminist charges and
which prevented the debate from
becoming all it could have been. I
think this need not have been the
case. Although critical of the limited
relevance of the first amendment
for women, MacKinnon ultimately
rejected the idea of prior restraint by

the state on which so much of
Joseph's argument has premised.
In her opening remarks, MacKin
non asserted that "the social precon
ditions, the presumptions that under
lie the first amendment do not app
ly to women."
Radical feminists have trouble get
ting published and the "context of
radical inequality between sexes"
strips the idea of a free and open ex
change of ideas of any meaning.
The free and open exchange of
ideas which free speech is supposed
to engender cannot take place in the
"context of radical inequality be
tween sexes." In subsequent re
marks, Dworkin spoke of the difficul
ty radical feminists experience in get
ting published and contrasted
against the considerable market that
exists for pornographic materials.
According to MacKinnon and
Dworkin, pornography erodes the
already tenuous position of women
in society. Through its objectification
of women, pornography perpetuates
male dominance. Furthermore,
pornography has the insidious effect
of silencing its victims. The degrada
tion of women which they assert
pornography encourages often
leaves its victims too humiliated to
exercise their right of speech in pro
test.
If one accepts the feminist argu
ment that the ideology of male domi
nance which oppresses them is an
almost inseparable part of our sex
uality and our society, then logically
any censor's definition of porno
graphy could and would be used
against the feminist cause as well as
towards other ends.
Such arguments seem to me an in
sufficient justification for censorship
by government authority. What
almost escaped my attention during
the debate, however, and what al
luded some others as well, was that
MacKinnon's analysis stopped short
of calling for prior restraint by the
state.
Although she criticized Joseph for
defining her approach against
pornography as being one of
censorship, she failed in her opening

remarks to define what exactly her
approach was. I believe that this am
biguity combined with her critical
analysis of the first amendment to
suggest to many that she did not rule
out the censor's pen as a tool of social
progress.
Not surprisingly, MacKinnon was
asked early in the question and an
swer session to define her position
on censorship. Referring to
censorship by the state, she re
marked that "suppressing it (porno
graphy) ... enhances its value ... as
erotic stuff and what I'm interested in
doing is delegitimatizing its value."
When the crowd pressed her to be
more precise, she said, "I don't see
any way, any, any simple quick fix le
gal answer." Although far from an
unequivocal rejection of further le
gal restraints on the publication of
pornography, this statement should
have laid to rest the spectre of
censorship which had haunted the
feminist perspective. Unfortunately,
many had already drawn the lines of
battle after the opening volley of re
marks and the issue of censorship
continued to be raised.
Had MacKinnon's rejection of
censorship been earlier and more
forthrightly stated or had her subse
quent remarks been more carefully
received, I think we would have seen
a different debate. The same argu
ments which seem insufficient justifi
cation for prior restraint by the state
seem a reasonable justification for
prior restraint by the individual.Once
I realized that I was being asked not
to endorse a program for censorship
but to consider a rationale for con
demning pornography on a personal
basis, the degree of consideration
