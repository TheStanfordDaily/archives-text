## Search for peace on the West Bank 
### 
The Israeli occupying forces have
been involved in a.) all-out assault on
the independent and nationalist
Palestinian institutions on the West
Bank and Gaza Strip. Their "iron fist"
moves to destroy these institutions
that make up and preserve the
Palestinian national identity, and can,
thus, form a basis for a future inde
pendent state.
We have been observing the
closure and continuous harrassment
of Palestinian universities, severe
press censorship where Arabic news
papers that are printed in Jerusalem
are prohibited from circulation in the
West Bank, collective punishment,
and harrassment and oppressive re
strictions on professional and labor
union, hospitals, schools, and inde
pendent private companies. This
latest attack on the West Bank Palesti
nians reached its most crucial stage
when Menahim Milson, the new ci
vilian administrator of the West Bank,
expelled the democratically elected
mayors of El Bireh, Nablus, and
Ramailah from their jobs.
While the occupying authority of
the West Bank changed its title from
"military" to "civilian" last Novem
ber, its coercive powers and methods
have become more repressive, if any
thing. Milson, its new head, is as
signed the dual task of destroying or
severely limiting the role of the inde
pendent Palestinian institutions, and
of creating alternative institutions
that would be more co-operative
with the Israeli occupation and its no
tion of "self-rule," more passive
towards a de facto annexation of the
West Bank, and easier to co-opt.
It is for these reasons and because
accepting a civilian administration le
gitimizes the occupation that the
West Bank, that Palestinians have
completely rejected this adminis
tration,
Milson's strategy has been to fol
low a "carrot-and-stick" policy. His
administration provides protection,
special privileges and lavish en
couragement to those who join the
Villages Leagues, which have been
created by the Israeli occupying au
thorities to substitute the Palestinian
Liberation Organization (PLO) in the
leadership of the Palestinians. How
ever, not only have the Leagues'
members been denounced by their
own families, but they have also been
rejected by the whole West Bank
populaton; their membership is less
than 200 and is on the wane as many
members continue to resign.
Milson's oppressive policies have
been applied in order to uproot the
"PLO Influence" from the West
Bank. His logic makes Palestinian na
tionalism external to the West Bank
Palestinians; it is imposed upor.them
by the PLO, and his duty is to "free"
them from this "PLO influence." He
and the Israeli government refuse to

understand that the Palestinians' de
sire to establish their own independ
ent state is shared by all Palestinians,
whether they live in the "Diaspora"
or under Israeli occupation, and that
the PLO is only the outcome and rep
resentation of this national desire. If
the PLO did not exist, it would have
to be created.
Milson's basic misunderstanding
of Palestinian nationalism is not new
but has been shared by most Zionists
and all Israeli governments. The early
Zionists denied the physical ex
istence of the Palestinians with their
infamous slogan: "a land without a
people for a people without a land."
As this physical existence of the
Palestinians proved impossible to
deny anymore, later Zionists and all
Israeli governments have denied the
Palestinians' national existence. This
forms the basis for Israel's call to set
tle the Palestinians in various Arab
countries and its rejection to allow
Palestinian national self-de
termination on the West Bank and

Gaza.
However, the very dangerous
aspect of Milson's misunderstanding
is his determinatipn to use the re
pressive powers that he commands in
order to uprrot the "PLO influence/'
and thus to wage a long and bloody
battle to achieve the impossible goal
of uprooting Palestinian nationalism.
Two outcomes seem possible in the
short run: either that Milson, Prime
Minister Menachem Begin and De
fense Minister Ariel Sharon, will have
to admit the bankruptcy of their West
Bank policies, or the Israeli occupa
tion will prove to be the bloodiest oc
cupation in history. In the long run,
no viable peace can be achieved
through repression and destruction
of the Palestinian institution; a genu
ine peace can only be achieved by al
lowing the Palestinians under oc
cupation to control and develop
their institutions as a first step
towards nation self-determination.

Palestinian national identity, and can,
thus, form a basis for a future inde
pendent state.
We have been observing the
closure and continuous harrassment
of Palestinian universities, severe
press censorship where Arabic news
papers that are printed in Jerusalem
are prohibited from circulation in the
West Bank, collective punishment,
and harrassment and oppressive re
strictions on professional and labor
union, hospitals, schools, and inde
pendent private companies. This
latest attack on the West Bank Palesti
nians reached its most crucial stage
when Menahim Milson, the new ci
vilian administrator of the West Bank,
expelled the democratically elected
mayors of El Bireh, Nablus, and
Ramailah from their jobs.
While the occupying authority of
the West Bank changed its title from
"military" to "civilian" last Novem
ber, its coercive powers and methods
have become more repressive, if any
thing. Milson, its new head, is as
signed the dual task of destroying or
severely limiting the role of the inde
pendent Palestinian institutions, and
of creating alternative institutions
that would be more co-operative
with the Israeli occupation and its no
tion of "self-rule," more passive
towards a de facto annexation of the
West Bank, and easier to co-opt.
It is for these reasons and because
accepting a civilian administration le
gitimizes the occupation that the
West Bank, that Palestinians have
completely rejected this adminis
tration,
Milson's strategy has been to fol
low a "carrot-and-stick" policy. His
administration provides protection,
special privileges and lavish en
couragement to those who join the
Villages Leagues, which have been
created by the Israeli occupying au
thorities to substitute the Palestinian
Liberation Organization (PLO) in the
leadership of the Palestinians. How
ever, not only have the Leagues'
members been denounced by their
own families, but they have also been
rejected by the whole West Bank
populaton; their membership is less
than 200 and is on the wane as many
members continue to resign.
Milson's oppressive policies have
been applied in order to uproot the
"PLO Influence" from the West
Bank. His logic makes Palestinian na
tionalism external to the West Bank
Palestinians; it is imposed upor.them
by the PLO, and his duty is to "free"
them from this "PLO influence." He
and the Israeli government refuse to

understand that the Palestinians' de
sire to establish their own independ
ent state is shared by all Palestinians,
whether they live in the "Diaspora"
or under Israeli occupation, and that
the PLO is only the outcome and rep
resentation of this national desire. If
the PLO did not exist, it would have
to be created.
Milson's basic misunderstanding
of Palestinian nationalism is not new
but has been shared by most Zionists
and all Israeli governments. The early
Zionists denied the physical ex
istence of the Palestinians with their
infamous slogan: "a land without a
people for a people without a land."
As this physical existence of the
Palestinians proved impossible to
deny anymore, later Zionists and all
Israeli governments have denied the
Palestinians' national existence. This
forms the basis for Israel's call to set
tle the Palestinians in various Arab
countries and its rejection to allow
Palestinian national self-de
termination on the West Bank and

Gaza.
However, the very dangerous
aspect of Milson's misunderstanding
is his determinatipn to use the re
pressive powers that he commands in
order to uprrot the "PLO influence/'
and thus to wage a long and bloody
battle to achieve the impossible goal
of uprooting Palestinian nationalism.
Two outcomes seem possible in the
short run: either that Milson, Prime
Minister Menachem Begin and De
fense Minister Ariel Sharon, will have
to admit the bankruptcy of their West
Bank policies, or the Israeli occupa
tion will prove to be the bloodiest oc
cupation in history. In the long run,
no viable peace can be achieved
through repression and destruction
of the Palestinian institution; a genu
ine peace can only be achieved by al
lowing the Palestinians under oc
cupation to control and develop
their institutions as a first step
towards nation self-determination.
