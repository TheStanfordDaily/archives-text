## Presidential propaganda? 
### 
By now everyone should know that
there are presently some 50,000 nu
clear weapons stockpiled among the
Warsaw Pact and NATO countries.
That total destructive capability
tallies out to the equivalent in ex
plosive power of about three tons of
TNT for every man, woman and child
on earth. Wolfgang Panofsky, here at
the Stanford Linear Accelerator, has
conservatively estimated that even a
"portion" of the nuclear stockpile of
either side would be sufficient to in
cur 100 million immediate fatalities
on the other.
That would be nearly half the pop
ulation of either the United States or
the Soviet Union. These are im
mediate fatalities, and do not include
long-term effects due to fallout, the
total destruction of civilization as we
know it, or the massive global
ecological damage that would result.
I think that a more likely scenario
would be a nuclear war that would be
total and immediate, highly "suc
cessful," and that within a generation
or so in the aftermath, all human life
would become extinct.
Can we continue to live with such a
threat? As long as there are stockpiles
of such enormous destructive poten
tial, each side in fact continues to try
to find measures to circumvent and
mullify the power of the other. At the
same time, nerves get a little jumpier,
detection and confirmation more
difficult, and the critical response
time of the finger on the button
progressively shorter.
Due to a leak to the press, it is now
known that during an 18 month peri
od ending june 1980 there were 147
false alerts at the NORAD early warn
ing facility in the Rocky Mountains.
On at least one of these occasions,
B-52 bomber crews were in the
cockpits awaiting take-off instruc
tions, and the Pacific Command's air
borne command post was indeed air
borne, ready to direct a retaliatory
strike.
NORAD's computer system stub
bornly insisted that hundreds of Rus
sian missiles were streaming over the

t horizon toward the U.S. mainland.
• Only some minutes after the
; projected time of arrival was it pos
. sible to positively confirm the com
' puter malfunction. This is one facil
■ ity. We do not know what has been
: going on in the other 26 U.S. com
mand posts, before or since, much
less what paranoic episodes have
been visited on the Soviets. Can any
one in their right mind believe, even
for an instant, that this situation can
be tolerated?
President Ronald Reagan has told'
us that the Soviets are engaged in a
relentless arms buildup, have sur
passed the United States in over-all
military power, and are bent on
world conquest. If such were the
cast, we might indeed be caught in a
contest of nerves and will, and un
able to forego yet further prepara
tion for war.
One could argue that only by
pushing the So viets to the line could
a meaningful and lasting disarma
ment by put into motion. By this
argument, President Ronald Reagan
would emerge at that last moment
when the nerves of the world are in
tatters, as a man of immense charac
ter, the savior of mankind, and cham
pion of the American Way. What a
great movie. What a way for Reagan
to go.
It is truly unfortunate that Reagan
never saw active combat.
What realities, if any, lie behind
Reagan's unflaggingly anti-Soviet
posture? He has produced for us, on
national television the Pentagon re
lease, "Soviet Military Power,"
resplendent with statistics. Whose
statistics? According to the Novem
ber 1981 issue of Inquiry magazine,
this is an almost verbatim translation
of a propaganda article written by the
Soviet Ministry of Defense, which
was subsequently leaked to the Pen
tagon by a double agent.
Moreover, the same author has
tened to correct the impression of
this propaganda for the sake of the
higher ranking members of the Polit

buro. In a subsequent, top-secret
document, he repudiated virtually ,
every claim made in, what has now
become "our" version of, "Soviet
Military Power."
But there is other information
whose sources are clearly identi
fiable and open to interrogation. Re
cently, both Gene Laßocque, and
Herbert Scoville have appeared in
films to rebut the notion of the Unit
ed States' military inferiority to
Russia. Laßocque is a retired admiral/
arid"sc6ViWe was Hepift/WrtJtWfrfbr"'
research for the Central Intelligence
Agency. Both were "establishment"
men, and certainly in possession of *
the facts. J
It appears we have been ahead of
the Soviets on virtually every techno
logical advance, and its military em
ployment. Certainly each side pushes
the ether, in this insanity; but the
record is clear on who has been
pushing the hardest.
Of course, Reagan has confided to
us that he has more recent and
ominous information about the dan
gers of the Soviet military that is too i
secret to share with us. It might seem
unpatriotic not to believe him.
I don't believe him. In the circum- !
stances, I don't think any president
can be granted such blind credulity. ;
Given that it is Reagan, and that this
information may emanate from the J
same sources that enlightened him as
to all of those millionares getting free
school lunches, or how the trees are
polluting the air, the statement
means little.
The record shows that the Soviets
have been making several decent
proposals for arms limitations, which
we have been rejecting out of hand.
It appears the people of this coun
try are being had. We're being lied to
to gain our support for an extremely
dangerous and unnecessary new
stage of escalation in the arms race.
