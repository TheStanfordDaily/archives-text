## Thief's malice: absence of thought 
### 
The other night, I received a dis
traught phone call from our set de
signer for Cabaret. He reported that
the giant sign he had created for dis
play in White Plaza had been stolen
and that he would not have time to
make a second one. I am both out
raged and baffled by the disap
pearance and would like people to
consider this issue.
First of all: Why does this need to
happenf Left in its proper place, a
sign promoting a University show is
beneficial to all, informing the cam
pus of an upcoming event. Wherever
it is now, our sign is not serving its in
tended purpose and is, in fact,
depriving the community of valuable
information.
Second, the theft represents a
shocking disregard for the work of
others. It took several people long
hours prepare such an attractive flat
and they were proud of their work.
Don't people think beyond their
own dorm room decor when taking
down posters and banners? Stealing

is stealing and nothing justifies it.

The letter from Berlin ("Living on
the Berlin Farm," Daily, April 6) by
Paul McLean was an interesting fea
ture, but it presented a one-sided
picture of the squatter scene in West
Berlin. While threatened
switchblade fights, doped-out punks
and squalid living conditions make
for a colorful account, they don't
correspond to my experience of the
squatter movement when I studied in
Berlin last year.
While studying at the Free Univer
sity, I had the chance to visit and help
renovate an occupied building,
along with other members of a his
tory seminar. We helped the occu
pants plaster walls, apply wallpaper
and repaint.
In return, they served us dinner,
spoke candidly of their plans and

showed us around the site, which in
cluded an abandoned chemical
plant. For example, they had finished
a music room and a kindergarten and
had plans for a bike-repair shop, a
cafe, a small stable and an entertain
ment/meeting hall.
Furthermore, they were actively
lobbying the city government against
the granting of permission to the
owner to tear down the buildings
and construct what they considered
"speculative" high-rise apartments.
Instead, they proposed a Trustee
Plan in which occupied houses
would be placed under the
trusteeship of a designated council
representing members of the oc
cupied buildings, and which would
lead eventually to rental contracts.
At any rate, these squatters were
serious, hard-working and full of in
itiative. Whether they were also into
drugs, punk music and wild sex, I
don't know, but then again, that's
their business.
