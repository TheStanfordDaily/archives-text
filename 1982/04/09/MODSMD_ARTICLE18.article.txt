## Callahan typifies anti- intellectual trend in photography 
### Nancy Webb 
Whoever said, "A picture's worth a
thousand words," was perhaps never asked
to review a photo exhibit. While indicating
something about the succinctness of a visual
image vis-a-vis language, such a statement
assumes a similarity of function in both that
can be used as a ground for comparison. But
a photograph is not "like" language, it does
not do the "work" of language.
A photograph deals in perceptions of the
visual variety. Reflections upon those per
ceptions are necessarily couched in lan
guage, which deals in intellectual responses.
Language is usually "about" relationships
and strategies of order; it is about subjects,
verbs and objects. Often, photography is
simply about subjects.
Hence nothing seems more inappropriate
than language for approximating the work
or value of a photo.
Harry Callahan, a contemporary American
photographer whose work is on exhibit at
Stanford Art Gallery through April 10, would
probably agree. When asked about the value
of art criticism, Callahan once said, "If an art
critic is a good writer then a review is worth
reading, but I don't think it has anything to
do with the pictures."
Callahan's whole approach to photogra
phy might be said to typify the anti-critical,
anti-intellectual trend in contemporary pho
tography. In fact, much of the quiet appeal
of his early photos stems from his unabashed
naivete — in the sense of simplicity and art
lessness — as an artist.
Artistically, Callahan belongs to the post-
Stieglitz era of photography. Alfred Stieglitz,
photographing in New York in the 1910s, was
a giant in the avant-garde art world, well
known for his adherence to "Art as social
criticism" theory.
Callahan, who was born on a farm outside
Detroit in 1912, admits that he came to pho
tography "by accident" rather late in life. He
graduated from high school during the De
pression, yet was able to attend Michigan
State for five terms. There Callahan met his
future wife, Eleanor Knapp, in 1933.
Confessing a lack of interest in academic
subjects, Callahan quit school and went to
work as a parts picker for Chrysler. He
started photographing while with Chrysler
and joined a Detroit Camera Club in 1938.
Years later, Callahan candidly describes his
first photographs as "pretty dopey."
"I had people run,"he says,"and they
were all blurred."
The turning point for Callahan came with
Ansel Adams' visit to the camera club late in
1938. "Ansel put his pictures up and that was
what did it to me," Callahan said later. "That
just completely freed me. They really had
tone and texture with no monkey business."
Adams, the best-known disciple of the Ed
ward Weston "school" of technical pre
cision in photography, brought with him

something new. What was new in Adams'
work was the dislocation of the social urgen
cy of Weston or Stieglitz, and the location of
the photographer's subjectivity within the
photo. According to Adams, a "great photo"
has to be "a full expression of what one feels
about what is being photographed in the
deepest sense and is, thereby, a true ex
pression of what one feels about life in its en
tirety."
Tone and texture became elements to be
explored in and of themselves in Adams'
photos, as an expression of the personality of
the artist.
Some of the most satisfying photographs
in the black and white collection currently
on display are those that show the marked
Adams approach to "tone and texture with
no monkey business." One photo, titled
simply "Wall, Chicago, 1947" — Callahan's
dismissal of photo titles bears further witness
to his anti-intellectual approach — is a close
up shot of old paint peeling off a wall. Here

'It's the subject matter that
counts• I'm interested in
revealing the subject in a
new way to intensify it A

always see/

Callahan's art noticeably displays two mod
ernist conceits in photography, identified by
Susan Sontag as "the nominal subject" and
"the profoundly banal."
On examination, the flaking paint begins
to take on an organic look and texture, not
unlike the peeling of a silver birch. Texture
itself becomes paramount and seems to call
upon the viewer to reach out and touch the
surface of the photo.
Several of Callahan's photos might easily
have been made by Adams himself, such as
his shot of pebbles on the beach or his sand
dunes that stretch and ripple into infinity. In
all of these, the grainy texture of the sand
itself and the patterns made by wind and sea
are elevated as proper subjects for the
photographic image; the photographer,
with his intellectual stance and moral
judgments has retreated from the scene.
In 1977 Callahan wrote, "It's the subject
matter that counts. I'm interested in reveal
ing the subject in a new way to intensify it. A
photo is able to capture a moment that peo

pie can't always see."
The degree to which Callahan's approach
seems almost commonplace to contem
porary viewers is a measure of the degree of
assimilation of the "anti-intellectual" ap
proach in the modernist tradition. Callahan,
who taught at both the Chicago Institute of
Design and the Rhode Island School of De
sign, admits what many of us have suspected
all along: that teachers are oftentimes hired
to teach what they profess can not be taught.
"I never felt comfortable teaching," said
Callahan. "Now that !'m not teaching any
more I'm looking forward to something else
Perhaps this is what impresses me most
about the Callahan exhibit: Callahan's work
has the freshness, the simplicity and the lack
of artistic guile to dare to be mediocre or or
dinary.
Before anyone can accuse me of insolence
or pomposity, let me hasten to add that there
are some excellent, even brilliant, photos in
this exhibit. In particular I would note one
shot in a series of his wife titled "Eleanor, In
diana, 1948." This shot of his wife posed up to
the shoulders in water has all of the haunting
quality of an Edgar Degas painting: Eleanor
stands, eyes closed, long, dark hair floating
in the water in front of her, one bare nipple
just visible beneath the water's surface.
Somehow Callahan has captured the shy
self-consciousness on Eleanor's face that
tries to pass for serenity or meditation. Her
look is almost introspective, but not quite;
she wears the face of a woman who poses in
shoulder-deep water for her husband to
photograph in 1948. Something about her
suggests Ophelia.
The rather stark contrast between the
blackness of her hair and the whiteness of
her skin suggests the old silent film star; she
looks out-of-place, not quite at ease in her
wet surroundings. Her expression is quiet
and trusting and artistically innocent, not un
like Callahan's better photos.
Yet exhibited alongside this photo are sev
eral photos I would hesitate to call anything
but ordinary. Among these I would include
various of Callahan's "nature" shots —
though not all, as well as his more self-con
scious multiple exposure shots. Standing
before those photos, I felt as though
Callahan were masquerading as another ar
tist, trading in his own particular view of the
world for another's eye. Naturally I respect
an artist's right and duty to explore new ways
of working, though in Callahan's case those
instances seem to fall short of his original
freshness and simplicity of view.
Other shots seem ordinary in the sense
that no view seems implicit kvthetn. Yet in all
of these instances my respect for Callahan
remains intact, indeed it somehow grows.
The infrequent "failure" of his vision as a
photographer bears witness to an uncom
mon honesty in his art, likewise his in

articulation as an art critic.
Few photographers display as much "un
censored" material as Callahan seems to in
this exhibit (it must be added in all fairness
that Hallmark Cards acquired this collection
over a period of years, stretching from 1964
up to the present, and hence made the de
cision of which photos to display).
By far the most outstanding photos in the
collection is the series of people walking on
city streets, most of the photos titled "Chica
go, 1960" and "Chicago, 1961." Callahan,
almost literally "shooting from the hip," has
managed to capture the sound of cogwheels
turning in these portraits of strangers lost in
thought. w- .& MAk
