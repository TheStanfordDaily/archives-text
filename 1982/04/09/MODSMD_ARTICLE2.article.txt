# Kennedy: grad housing improving
## 
### Cici Oremland Senior staff writer 
University administrators ana
members of the Graduate Stu
dents Association (GSA) agree
there is too little on-campus hous
ing available for graduate stu
dents.
But both groups are also aware
that recognizing the problem and
eliminating it are two separate is
sues, and the administrators,
whose opinion is reflected in a let
ter President Donald Kennedy
wrote to the GSA last week, are
not promising any fast solutions.
Kennedy's letter was sparked by
recent complaints about lack of
sufficient and affordable graduate
student housing on campus, as
well as a formal petition signed by
641 graduate students asking the
University to alleviate the prob
lem.
Kennedy's letter pointed to the
University's increases in graduate
student housing over the past 10
years, which he said have allowed
40 percent of the graduate popu
lation to live on campus.
According to Kennedy, this per
centage is high in comparison to
Yale University,which can house
19 percent of its graduate popu
lation on campus, and the Univer
sity of California at Berkeley,
which can house less than 10 per
cent on campus.
The letter listed as evidence of
the University's committment to
graduate student housing the ad
ditions to Escondido Village; the
redesignation of certain housing
areas from married student to sin
gle student status; and the place
ment of some graduate students
in Mirrielees since the early 19705.
The letter also mentioned the pro
posed reallocation of Manzanita
Park for graduate student occupa
tion in 1983, when the under
graduates are moved into the new
dormitory complex west of
Lagunita Court.
Gerald Lieberman, vice provost
and dean of graduate studies and
research, also told the Daily that
even before circulation of the
GSA petition, the University was
in the process of creating an ad
visory committee for new housing
for graduate students, which will
make recommendations concern
ing the graduate housing prob
lem.
