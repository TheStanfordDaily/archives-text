## Card netters defeat Huskies 
### Sally Jenkins 
The University of Washing
ton Huskies were no match at
all for the Stanford men's ten
nis team, which was out to
prove that it can indeed still de
stroy much weaker opponents
in its usual style.
Thus, it was no surprise when
they had casually annhilated
the Huskies after only two
hours on the court without
dtopping a set.
Had the Cardinal starters
hung around to play some
doubles, Wednesday's match
at % the varsity courts would
probably have been a 9-0 deba
cle instead of the 7-2 laugher
it became.
• "Washington and Santa
Barbara gave us a couple of
ifcftches that we should have
won, and that we had to prove
we could win," said Stanford
&ead coach Dick Gould."They
gave us some much needed
work, and we are going into
{he crucial matches reasonably
healthy, and in a reasonably
good frame of mind."
fjpThe University of Arizona
meets the Cardinal at the varsi
ty courts this afternoon and Ar
izona State follows suit tomor
row. Stanford lost to both on
the road by a score of 5-4 over
spring break, but defeated UA
once earlier in the season, mak
ing today's meeting something
of grudge match as well as Stan
ford's key to reaching the
NCAA's.
If the Cardinal is to be as
sured of a spot in the NCAA
tournament it will have to win
at!least three of its next four
matches. UC-Berkeley is slated
to appear at the varsity courts
Monday afternoon and Trinity
will visit Tuesday.
Beating Arizona and Arizona
State will hinge on the doubles,
wfiere Stanford has not been
particularly strong. The Card
won only one of three doubles
against both the Wildcats and
the Sun Devils in Arizona.
"I know we can play better
than we have been, and we are
improving," said Gould. "But
we're running out of time."
The manhandling of Wash
ington alleviated his worries
somewhat. Cardinal No.l
player Scott Davis waltzed over

Scott Pearson 6-2, 6-2, starting
off the unanimous string of two
set victories that allowed
Gould to make a few substitu
tions in the doubles and let his
starters go home for the day.
In only his second match at
N0.2 singles, sophomore Mark
McKeen made quick work of
Bill Jacobsen after a first set
tiebreaker. McKeen broke
serve twice to jump to a 5-2
lead in the second set, but
Jacobsen held serve and then
broke for the first time in the
set, making it 5-4 and forcing
McKeen to break for the
match. At 3-3 points Jacobsen
put a topspin forehand just
long, and McKeen hadtiis first
victory at N0.2.
John Corse had the longest if
not the toughest match of the
day on court N0.3. The Card
senior finally ran into someone
who could hit the ball for
almost as long a time as he in
Husky Andy Lim, and the en
durance contest that ensued
was more akin to a wrestling
match than a tennis outing.
Corse stopped to change
sneakers twice during the
match when the inner linings
came loose. Contrary to rumor,
it was not because Lim ran him
until he wore out his soles.
Corse finally won the first set
7-5 as Davis was concluding his
second set one court away. The
turning point of the second set
came at 3-1 in games, when
Corse broke the Husky at 2-3
points after an exhausting
baseline rally. Three volleys
and two overheads couldn't
put Lim away, but he finally
popped up a backhand that
Corse slammed into the fence.
He held his own serve with
ease to make it 5-1, and broke
Lim for the match with a
backhand passing shot.
Jim Miller, a graduate stu
dent who moved into the start
ing lineup for the first time in
his career last week, won his
match at N0.6 against Dan
Zeratsky 6-4, 6-3. At N0.5, sen
ior Scott Bondurant defeated
Bryan Whiteside 7-6, 6-1, and
senior Jeff Arons had another
solid win at N0.4 as he rolled
over Marc Nebauer 6-2,6-4.
Today's match begins at 1:30
p.m.
