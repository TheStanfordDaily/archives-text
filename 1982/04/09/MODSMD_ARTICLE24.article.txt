Three of the nations top
five women collegiate ten
nis players lead the No. 1
rated Stanford women's
tennis team against Pep
perdine today and No. 2
rated UCLA tomorrow.
In "the recently-released
AMF-Head Top 10 rankings
for individual players, Stan
ford's sophomore lef
thander Elise Burgin topped
the list at No. 1, three-time
All-America Alycia Moulton
was ranked third and
freshman Kate Gompert
tied for fourth.
Stanford coach Frank
Brennan said the rankings
came as a little bit of a sur
prise, but he realizes the
worth of his 10-0 team.
"I think we have a pretty
damn good team," Brennan
said, "but then, I'm always
the pessimist."
Brennan said his team is
confident going into this
weekends matches in Los
Angeles.
"The attitude of the team
is very good," Brennan said.
"I'm happy they've been
achieving, but I'm always
afraid of overconfidence.
"They are cocky," he con
tinued, "but they've been
producing. Maybe they are
as good as they think they
are."
The Cardinal should have
little trouble with Pep
perdine, but the Bruins
present a major challenge
on Saturday.
Stanford handily beat
UCLA earlier this season 7-2
in the finals of the National
Indoor Championships in
Ann Arbor, Mich.
"The UCLA match will be
big," Brennan said. "It's
kind of scary because we
beat them so easily last time.
I know they won't be like
that this time. They're good;
heck, they could beat us 7-2
this time."
UCLA is led in singles by
Kathrin Keil, Shelley
Solomon and Heather
Ludloff. Brennan is not sure
of the scheduled UCLA line

up, but he predicts that Keil
will play No. 1, Ludloff will
play No. 2 and Solomon will
play No. 3.
Brennan has not set his
line-up for the UCLA match,
but against Pepperdine he
will play two-time AIAW
singles runner-up Moulton
at No. 1 followed by Burgin
and Gompert. Linda Gates
will play No. 4, Michelle
Weiss will play No. 5 and
Caryn Copeland will play
No. 6.
Brennan made a surprise
move in the doubles mov
ing defending AIAW cham
pions Moulton and
Copeland down to the No. 2
position and Burgin and
Gates to No. 1. Moulton and
Copeland have yet to regain
their championship form of
a year ago. Weiss and Gom
pert will play No. 3.
