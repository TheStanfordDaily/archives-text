# Card falters in Arizona
## 
### Adam Berns 
The Stanford baseball team
returned from a six-day road
trip, after dropping another
game on Wednesday after
noon to the Arizona Wildcats
4-2.
Dorothy could not have
wanted to come home more, as
the Cardinal dropped five of six
games on the trip. Stanford re
turns to the Farm with an 11-7
conference record, and is in
second place in the Southern
Division of the Pac-10 Con
ference.
Although yesterday's loss
puts the Cardinal only two
games behind Arizona State
(9-2), a sweep of the Sun Devils
at home (April 19-21) would
not be enough to guarantee
the Cardinal a first place finish
in the conference because of

the fewer number of games
currently played by Arizona
State.
Stanford can also reach the
playoffs, like they did last year,
by placing second in the con
ference and then defeating the
Norther Division winner in a
best of three series.
"We're certainly not out of
it," Stanford coach Mark Mar
quess explained. "But we're
going to have to play better
baseball."
In Wednesday's contest,
Stanford had two runs on eight
hits, but it was not enough to
overcome the powerful Wild
cats who pounded the Cardinal
for four runs on 12 hits, includ
ing a three-run double in the
fifth inning.

Stanford pitcher Brian
Mignano (8-3) was tagged with
the loss, but Marquess did not
feel that pitching was the prob
lem.
"We didn't hit the ball very
well at all," Marquess said. "I
feel Mignano pitched a good
enough game to win."
The Cardinal has been
playing on the road since
March 20, but Marquess re
fuses to blame any of the re
cent losses on excessive travel.
"Its tough to play that many
games on the road," Marquess
explained, "but you can't really
blame it on that. To be honest,
we didn't play very well."
Stanford plays 10 of its last 12
conference games at Sunken
Diamond. If the past is any
clue, there's no place like
home.
