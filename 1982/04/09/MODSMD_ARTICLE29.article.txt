# Golf teams disappointed
## 
### Mark Zeigler 
Consistency was on the side
of the men's and women's golf
teams during the week in ma
jor tournaments, but this con
sistency was of the mediocre
variety, both squads finishing
well into the pack.
The women placed ninth in
the Lady Sun Devil Tour
nament at Phoenix, Ariz., while
the men took 12th in the
Western Intercollegiate at San
ta Cruz's Pasatiempo Golf
Course.
Coach Tim Baldwin's wom
en's team shot four-person
scores of 304, 304, and 306 on
the par-72 course. Their 914

three-day total put them 23
strokes behind winner Okla
homa State. Tulsa followed
OSU, with host Arizona State
finishing third and San Jose
State fourth.
Junior Joanne Pacillo's
three-day 220, including an
opening round 71, was good
enough for the fifth spot in the
individual competition. Lori
Castillo fired 224 and Kathy
Nino, powered by a second day
71, checked in at 230 for the
Card.
The men, guided by coach
Tim Schaaf, sandwiched a five
man 384 between a pair of
378's. USC convicingly won the

three-day event with an ag
gregate 1102, a ten-stroke
margin over second place BYU.
Pac-10 powerhouse UCLA fin
ished third minus its top player,
who is in Augusta, Ga, for this
weekend's Masters.
Tim Robinson led Stanford
with a first round 72. Freshman
Josh Mondry fired a 74 to pace
Card golfers in the second
round.
The men's squad has nearly a
three week break until the Sun
Devil Tournament, April 28-
May 1. The women will partici
pate in a three-team event
against San Jose and Sacra
mento States April 22.
