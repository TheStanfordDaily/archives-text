# University considering ODUS reorganization
## 
### Heather Millar Senior staff writer 
An ad hoc committee reviewing
the Office of the Dean of Under
graduate Studies (ODUS) has de
cided ''as formally as is possible at this
point" to recommend to Provost Al
Hastorf that many, if not all, of the ac
ademic services and programs cur
rently reporting to the Dean of Un
dergraduate Studies should be dis
persed to other administrative units,
Daily sources have confirmed.
This move would eliminate ODUS
as it now exists, drastically altering
the administrative structure which
oversees undergraduate programs.
Presently Dean of Undergraduate
Studies Herant Katchadourian plays
the double role of administrator and
advocate. All departments which
teach undergraduates and special
programs like SWOPSI and the Aca
demic Information Center (AIC) an
swer to Katchadourian. As a dean
who is also a vice-provost,
Katchadourian represents the in
terests of undergraduates in the con
ference rooms where University pol
icy is meted out.

Although members of the commit
tee were generally reluctant to re
lease any details regarding the pro
ceedings of the ad hoc committee,
Stan Young; one of the two student
members, admitted /'The lines of au
thority now grouped under
Katchadourian may not be (the same)
in the future, (but may) be dispersed
to other administrative units. The stu
dent body might be better served if
the functions of ODUS were put
somewhere else."
The committee includes a battery
of high-level University adminis
trators; the provost; the deans of
graduate and undergraduate study;
the deans of the Schools of Human
ities and Sciences, Engineering, and
Earth Sciences; as well as two pro
fessors.
Changes presently being con
sidered involve "the reorganizing of
lines of communication and lines of
administration," according to
Young.
Hastorf, chairman of the commit
tee, cautioned that no final decisions
will be made for at least a month. The
committee will meet with the Cabi

net on Undergraduate Education two
or three more times, Hastorf said,
and then draft a final proposal. But he
said if the aegis under which under-
programs operate is
changed or dispersed, "It would cer
tainly be possible that some of those
services (now administered by
ODUS) would be put in the School of

Humanities and Sciences."
In a copy of minutes of the March
10 meeting of the Cabinet on Under
graduate Education obtained by the
Daily, Katchadourian wrote, " ...

contemplated changes include the
shift of the advising functions of AIC
to Humanities and Sciences and its
varous monitoring functions to the
Registrar's office. Similarly, under
considerationn is the move to Hu
manities and Sciences of SWOPSf,
SCIRE, Undergraduate Specials,
Freshman/Sophomore Seminars and
the Program in Individually Designed
Majors."
The dean continued, writing that
these transfers would result in "con
siderable financial savings ... or at
least the simplification of the current
bureaucratic burden lodged in the
Office of the Dean of Undergraduate
Studies."
"There's a lot of just running
around (in the current adminis
tration)," said Young. "The idea is
that by eliminating the bureaucratic
middle-manning, we would save
some . .. unnecessary effort."
Hastorf convened the committee's
first meeting in February, at
Katchadourian's urging. The admin
istration periodically reviews ODUS,
usually after a dean finishes his term.
Returning in January from a sab-

batical, Katchadourian made an ap
peal for an early review, saying, "I be
lieve we have a responsability to ask
searching questions about where we
(OOUS) go from here, both as indi
vidual programs as well as collective
ly as an administrative unit."
Katchadourian said his being able to
participate in the review while still in
office would facilitate the process.
Katchadouridn would not
elaborate on what led him to
conclusion that ODUS should be re
viewed; however when james Gibbs
left the office in 1976, he voiced ques
tions about the deanship which have
been raised periodically in reports
and newspaper articles since the es
tablishment of ODUS 12 years ago.
"The concept of the dean as an 'ad
vocate' for undergraduate education
is a nest of unclear notions ... ,"
Gibbs wrote in his final report to the
University. "... the effectiveness of
ODUS' impact on undergraduate
education is limited ... the large
amount of managerial time that is
mandated ... by the very number of
ODUS programs and services... re


Herant Katchedourian
duces the amount of time the Dean
ery has been able to devote to its
catalytic role."
While University administrators
may voice frustrations over the cur
rent structure of the undergraduate
management, Katchadourian's visits
to various offices, asking people how
they would feel about the "dispersal
model" has made some uneasy.

"Our concern would be that the
more programs get pushed into the
departments, the less organized they
would be and the less students would
be involved," said Judy Adams, co
director of SCIRE. Adams warned
that dispersing the functions of
ODUS to the untried administration
of the School of Humanities and Sci?
ences might not serve the students
either, because those administrators
would be unfamiliar with managing
the programs.
