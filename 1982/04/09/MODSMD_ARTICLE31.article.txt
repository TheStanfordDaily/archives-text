# Cold, rain put damper on Masters
## 
### Washington Post 
Augusta, Ga. — A cold,
.wet blanket of fog, steady rain
and gusting winds lay over the
Augusta National, turning
Thursday's first round into per
haps the most brutally un
pleasant day of golf in the his
tory of the Masters.
Of the 40 men in the field of
76 who completed play before
the whistle blew at 4:29 p.m.,
calling all this sadomasochism
to a halt, only one player could
equal par — '80 champ Fuzzy
Zoeller.
In fact, of the "Masters"
brave enough to post their
scores, the field average was
77.6 — higher than any of the
legendarily awful rounds at the
TPC at Sawgrass. The field's
worst-ball score was 115, led by
a second-hole quadruple
bogey 9 by Billy Casper, who
missed a two-foot putt, then
watched in horror as the ball
rolled 30 feet past the hole.
"Oh, it's beautiful out there.
The sun's out," spoofed
Zoeller, who had six birdies, six
pars and six bogeys in his
bizarre round. "What you hear
on that (tin) roof isn't really
rain. It's just a squirrel cuttin'
nuts... I never get upset about
this stupid game. Hell, the last
(competitive) round I shot was
an 84 (last week at Green
sboro). After that, I feel like I
shot 62 today."
Few folks ended this anti-
Masters day with Zoeller's
cheerfulness.
With thermometers regis
tering in the low 40s and the in
struments that measure greens
speeds registering in the psy
chedelic low teens, only seven
players could break 75: Greg
Norman, Peter Oosterhuis,
Morris Hatalsky and Gay
Brewer at 73, plus Ben
Crenshaw and Mark Hayes at
74.

The only players who ended
this bitterly raw day in a happy
mood were, ironically, the 36
men who were trapped on the
course and drenched by a
huge, sky-splitting deluge at
4:24 that put every green under
water within minutes.
Their cause for joy was the
simple fact that they'll get to
continue play from their point
of interruption at 7:30 a.m. on
Friday when, they assume, con
ditions cannot possibly be
worse and will probably be
measurably better.
And who are these semi
lucky fellows who, the weath
erman says, can finish their
round on a day that is "fair and
50ish?"
Why, the cream of the crop:
Tom Watson and Craig Stadler
who were one under par after
nine holes, plus Jack Nicklaus
and amateur Jodie Mudd, who
were even par after 10.
Nicklaus even stalled for more
than half an hour, asking for
spurious, but legal, rulings on
casual water in the fairway at
the 10th, as he prayed for heav
ier rain.
"About six groups of us were
backed up for two holes be
hind Jack," said Tom Kite, "but
none of us were complainin'.
We knew what he was doing."
In effect, these upper-in
come non-finishers survived
half-a-round Thursday and
may get a chance to open

ground on the field on Friday.
Other big names left on the
'.courseJn decent striking posi
tion at one over par with plenty
of holes left to play were:
George Burns, Bruce Lietzke,
John Mahaffey and Jack Ren
ner (all through seven holes),
Kite (through nine), Seve
Ballesteros (13) and David
Graham (15).
By painful contrast with
these still-in-contention fel
lows, seven players couldn't
break 80, including Lon Hinkle
(81), John Cook (82), Casper
(85), Jim Thorpe (88) and Frank
Conner, who took the booby
prize with a mind-boggling 89
in his first round since winning
$32,400 for finishing second at
Harbor Town just two weeks
ago. "I lost interest and said,
'The hell with it,'" said Conner,
who had 49 on the back nine to
record (unofficially) the
highest score in Masters his
tory.

In danger is the dubious
achievement Masters' record
of highest score a first
round leader — 71 by Jack
Burke Jr., in 1957. Folks here
abouts can only remember two
Masters days approaching this
one for bona fide lousy — the
second round in '54, when no
body broke par, and the first
round in '36, when only one
player broke par.
With the combination of un
predictable wind, penetrating
cold, poor visibility, constant
drizzle or outright rain, wet
club grips, slick greens, heavy
air, soft fairways, mud on the
ball and nasty pin placements,
this was the all-time day for
moanin' at the Masters.
"We shouldn't have played
today. It's just not golf," said
Georgian Larry Nelson (79). "I
think it's the pressure of TV (to
get in 36 holes before Saturday,
so weekend coverage won't be
disrupted) that forced us to

play today. I think it's a shame.
.. . This golf course is un
playable today, but then t don't
have money coming in from
CBS. They'll get this round in
one way or the other ... I've
played in worse rain and worse
cold, but never the combina
tion. For me, there were eight
par-fives out there.
"Nobody drafted me to be a
golfer, but I still say we
shouldn't have played. It got to
the point where you didn't
care if you hit it or not."
Nelson's opinion was in the
minority. Even Conner said,
"Oh, sure, you've gotta go
ahead and play. It's not danger
ous. The course was playable."
"It's pretty easy to start
thinkin', 'What are we doing
out here? When are we going
to stop?' " said Danny Edwards
(75). "But it's also a test of will
and stamina and maybe
strength, because the course
plays so unbelievably long."

"Oh, sure, you've gotta go
ahead and play. It's not danger
ous. The course was playable."
"It's pretty easy to start
thinkin', 'What are we doing
out here? When are we going
to stop?' " said Danny Edwards
(75). "But it's also a test of will
and stamina and maybe
strength, because the course
plays so unbelievably long."
Augusta, Ga. — A cold,
.wet blanket of fog, steady rain
and gusting winds lay over the
Augusta National, turning
Thursday's first round into per
haps the most brutally un
pleasant day of golf in the his
tory of the Masters.
Of the 40 men in the field of
76 who completed play before
the whistle blew at 4:29 p.m.,
calling all this sadomasochism
to a halt, only one player could
equal par — '80 champ Fuzzy
Zoeller.
In fact, of the "Masters"
brave enough to post their
scores, the field average was
77.6 — higher than any of the
legendarily awful rounds at the
TPC at Sawgrass. The field's
worst-ball score was 115, led by
a second-hole quadruple
bogey 9 by Billy Casper, who
missed a two-foot putt, then
watched in horror as the ball
rolled 30 feet past the hole.
"Oh, it's beautiful out there.
The sun's out," spoofed
Zoeller, who had six birdies, six
pars and six bogeys in his
bizarre round. "What you hear
on that (tin) roof isn't really
rain. It's just a squirrel cuttin'
nuts... I never get upset about
this stupid game. Hell, the last
(competitive) round I shot was
an 84 (last week at Green
sboro). After that, I feel like I
shot 62 today."
Few folks ended this anti-
Masters day with Zoeller's
cheerfulness.
With thermometers regis
tering in the low 40s and the in
struments that measure greens
speeds registering in the psy
chedelic low teens, only seven
players could break 75: Greg
Norman, Peter Oosterhuis,
Morris Hatalsky and Gay
Brewer at 73, plus Ben
Crenshaw and Mark Hayes at
74.

The only players who ended
this bitterly raw day in a happy
mood were, ironically, the 36
men who were trapped on the
course and drenched by a
huge, sky-splitting deluge at
4:24 that put every green under
water within minutes.
Their cause for joy was the
simple fact that they'll get to
continue play from their point
of interruption at 7:30 a.m. on
Friday when, they assume, con
ditions cannot possibly be
worse and will probably be
measurably better.
And who are these semi
lucky fellows who, the weath
erman says, can finish their
round on a day that is "fair and
50ish?"
Why, the cream of the crop:
Tom Watson and Craig Stadler
who were one under par after
nine holes, plus Jack Nicklaus
and amateur Jodie Mudd, who
were even par after 10.
Nicklaus even stalled for more
than half an hour, asking for
spurious, but legal, rulings on
casual water in the fairway at
the 10th, as he prayed for heav
ier rain.
"About six groups of us were
backed up for two holes be
hind Jack," said Tom Kite, "but
none of us were complainin'.
We knew what he was doing."
In effect, these upper-in
come non-finishers survived
half-a-round Thursday and
may get a chance to open

ground on the field on Friday.
Other big names left on the
'.courseJn decent striking posi
tion at one over par with plenty
of holes left to play were:
George Burns, Bruce Lietzke,
John Mahaffey and Jack Ren
ner (all through seven holes),
Kite (through nine), Seve
Ballesteros (13) and David
Graham (15).
By painful contrast with
these still-in-contention fel
lows, seven players couldn't
break 80, including Lon Hinkle
(81), John Cook (82), Casper
(85), Jim Thorpe (88) and Frank
Conner, who took the booby
prize with a mind-boggling 89
in his first round since winning
$32,400 for finishing second at
Harbor Town just two weeks
ago. "I lost interest and said,
'The hell with it,'" said Conner,
who had 49 on the back nine to
record (unofficially) the
highest score in Masters his
tory.

In danger is the dubious
achievement Masters' record
of highest score a first
round leader — 71 by Jack
Burke Jr., in 1957. Folks here
abouts can only remember two
Masters days approaching this
one for bona fide lousy — the
second round in '54, when no
body broke par, and the first
round in '36, when only one
player broke par.
With the combination of un
predictable wind, penetrating
cold, poor visibility, constant
drizzle or outright rain, wet
club grips, slick greens, heavy
air, soft fairways, mud on the
ball and nasty pin placements,
this was the all-time day for
moanin' at the Masters.
"We shouldn't have played
today. It's just not golf," said
Georgian Larry Nelson (79). "I
think it's the pressure of TV (to
get in 36 holes before Saturday,
so weekend coverage won't be
disrupted) that forced us to

play today. I think it's a shame.
.. . This golf course is un
playable today, but then t don't
have money coming in from
CBS. They'll get this round in
one way or the other ... I've
played in worse rain and worse
cold, but never the combina
tion. For me, there were eight
par-fives out there.
"Nobody drafted me to be a
golfer, but I still say we
shouldn't have played. It got to
the point where you didn't
care if you hit it or not."
Nelson's opinion was in the
minority. Even Conner said,
"Oh, sure, you've gotta go
ahead and play. It's not danger
