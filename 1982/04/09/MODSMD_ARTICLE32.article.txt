## Blasters are not quite Creedence, not quite cretine 
### Stefan Malmoli The Blasters Slash Records 
Over spring break, as I enjoyed the sweet southern sun
of Los Angeles there was a buzz in the air about an L.A.
rockabilly — rhythm and blues band called The Blasters.
As it so happened, I remembered reading about the
group in Time magazine, where their first album had gar
nered a place in that magazine's "Top Ten Albums of the
Year" poll. The band was compared to Creedence
Clearwater Revival (which is the highest compliment
that an American rock group could be given), but I had
still not heard a single song of theirs. Therefore, since I
was in L.A., I decided to get the album and see what Time
was talking about.
The album entitled The Blasters is a sampling of the
music that the band plays. It is a mixture of solid rock
with rockabilly and R & B origins. The band takes a
straightforward approach to its music and their purpose
is not to make any statements. Their music is there to get
you on your feet. This is exactly what Creedence
Clearwater Revival represented. Creedence, with lead
guitarist and composer John Fogerty, took American
rock and roll and placed it in the context of the roots of
American folklore. Creedence's songs dwelt on the mu
sic first, and they produced the definitive style of Ameri
can rock and roll. Now, the Blasters have tried to follow
in this same style. However, although their intentions of
duplicating the Creedence format are honorable, their
musical limitations have resulted in a much less intrigu
ing album.
The Blasters, on their album, sound just too damn de
rivative of other forms, but that is because it sounds ex
actly like Little Richard or Elvis Presley. Their songs sound
like copies of '50s rockabilly rather than extensions or
progressions on that form (Dave Edmunds is one artist
who uses rockabilly for his own original style).
Now you may be saying that earlier in this article I
praised Creedence for doing this same thing. However,
there is a drastic difference between The Blasters and
Creedence. The Blasters lack the originality and vitality
that Creedence added to their own songs. With
Creedence, the songs that they performed were based

upon '50s rock and roll, but John Fogerty infused an in
novative style into the beat and lyrics. This, of course,
enabled Creedence's songs to become three-minute
masterpieces. Creedence always strove to progress for
ward from their rock and roll roots, while the Blasters

want to dwell in it. Though this may be an acceptable
path to take, when the band is being compared to
Creedence a great misconception is taking place.
This can be proved by the fact that the best songs on
The Blasters album are remakes of older blues and rock

abilly songs, such as "I'm Shakin'" and "Stop The- -*
Clock." The Bisters own writer and guitarist, Dave Alvitv \
is an able imitator of'sos rock but the overall effect of the
songs are weak in comparison to anything by
Creedence. Not one of The Blasters' self-penned tunes
have an exciting original guitar riff as, on say,,
Creedence's "Green River," "Proud Mary," or "For
tunate Son." The Blasters may just lack the ability to
create new, engaging modes of '50s American rock and
roll. Only on the album's best original song, "American
Music," does the band break out of its narrow format,
and the results of this song are far better than T
else on the album.
n& yi^h
Another factor in the album's failure is that unlike ui;
Creedence, there is no musical diversity in their material.'
Each song is contrived of mostly simple lyrics to a redun- ■»»».
dant rockabilly beat ("American Music" and "Border .. ,
Radio," though, are exceptions). However, Creedence
was able to incorporate slower material in contrast to all
rockers in a captivating fashion. The Blasters have not
written a meaningful and beautiful ballad as "Who'Hr, '
Stop The Rain" or "Long As I Can See The Light."
Blasters lack the insight that Creedence had in writing,
songs that dealt with all aspects of life and the world. In
stead, as in "Marie, Marie," or "Hollywood Bed," the lyr
ics lack any real depth or meaning. Creedence newer
focused on simple things, which accounted for their
greatness. When Creedence sang "Lodi" or "Run
Through The Jungle," one took notice of the lyrics. *
!> i. {vi.
However, one must remember that this is only The
Blaster's first album. Even Creedence's first album lacked
the flowering of John Fogerty's songwriting ability. The
Blasters have the right feel and the right idea as to what
the music is all about. They have the potential to develop
into the type of band that Creedence was, but they alsb
have a long way to progress if they intend to do so. The 11
group's reworkings of older material like on "I'm
Shakin' " is indicative that they have the musicianship to
do so. However, to achieve Creedence's excellence,"
they must have much room for growth. Whether they
succeed in doing so, though is irrelevant. Just their quest:
to match Creedence's sound and purpose should lead to t"
much better results the next time around. -i

Clearwater Revival represented. Creedence, with lead
guitarist and composer John Fogerty, took American
rock and roll and placed it in the context of the roots of
American folklore. Creedence's songs dwelt on the mu
sic first, and they produced the definitive style of Ameri
can rock and roll. Now, the Blasters have tried to follow
in this same style. However, although their intentions of
duplicating the Creedence format are honorable, their
musical limitations have resulted in a much less intrigu
ing album.
The Blasters, on their album, sound just too damn de
rivative of other forms, but that is because it sounds ex
actly like Little Richard or Elvis Presley. Their songs sound
like copies of '50s rockabilly rather than extensions or
progressions on that form (Dave Edmunds is one artist
who uses rockabilly for his own original style).
Now you may be saying that earlier in this article I
praised Creedence for doing this same thing. However,
there is a drastic difference between The Blasters and
Creedence. The Blasters lack the originality and vitality
that Creedence added to their own songs. With
Creedence, the songs that they performed were based

upon '50s rock and roll, but John Fogerty infused an in
novative style into the beat and lyrics. This, of course,
enabled Creedence's songs to become three-minute
masterpieces. Creedence always strove to progress for
ward from their rock and roll roots, while the Blasters

want to dwell in it. Though this may be an acceptable
path to take, when the band is being compared to
Creedence a great misconception is taking place.
This can be proved by the fact that the best songs on
The Blasters album are remakes of older blues and rock

abilly songs, such as "I'm Shakin'" and "Stop The- -*
Clock." The Bisters own writer and guitarist, Dave Alvitv \
is an able imitator of'sos rock but the overall effect of the
songs are weak in comparison to anything by
Creedence. Not one of The Blasters' self-penned tunes
have an exciting original guitar riff as, on say,,
Creedence's "Green River," "Proud Mary," or "For
tunate Son." The Blasters may just lack the ability to
create new, engaging modes of '50s American rock and
roll. Only on the album's best original song, "American
Music," does the band break out of its narrow format,
and the results of this song are far better than T
else on the album.

Blasters lack the insight that Creedence had in writing,
songs that dealt with all aspects of life and the world. In

However, one must remember that this is only The
Blaster's first album. Even Creedence's first album lacked
the flowering of John Fogerty's songwriting ability. The
Blasters have the right feel and the right idea as to what
the music is all about. They have the potential to develop
into the type of band that Creedence was, but they alsb
have a long way to progress if they intend to do so. The 11
group's reworkings of older material like on "I'm

do so. However, to achieve Creedence's excellence,"
they must have much room for growth. Whether they
succeed in doing so, though is irrelevant. Just their quest:
to match Creedence's sound and purpose should lead to t"

Over spring break, as I enjoyed the sweet southern sun
of Los Angeles there was a buzz in the air about an L.A.
rockabilly — rhythm and blues band called The Blasters.
As it so happened, I remembered reading about the
group in Time magazine, where their first album had gar
nered a place in that magazine's "Top Ten Albums of the
Year" poll. The band was compared to Creedence
Clearwater Revival (which is the highest compliment
that an American rock group could be given), but I had
still not heard a single song of theirs. Therefore, since I
was in L.A., I decided to get the album and see what Time
was talking about.
The album entitled The Blasters is a sampling of the
music that the band plays. It is a mixture of solid rock
with rockabilly and R & B origins. The band takes a
straightforward approach to its music and their purpose
is not to make any statements. Their music is there to get
you on your feet. This is exactly what Creedence
Clearwater Revival represented. Creedence, with lead
guitarist and composer John Fogerty, took American
rock and roll and placed it in the context of the roots of
