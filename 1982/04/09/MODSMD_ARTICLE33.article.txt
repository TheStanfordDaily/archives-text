# Coster goes on a rollercoaster ride through music
## 
### Mark Zeigler Tom Coster 
Old Waldorf/San Francisco
2 April 1982
Talk about an interesting
concert. And I thought the
Dregs were versatile...
Excuse my brainstorming,
but I can't resist thinking about
Tom Coster's show at the Old
Waldorf last Friday night. It was
a musical brainstorm, if noth
ing else.
Close your eyes and just lis
ten to Coster and his all-star
line-up of accomoanyists, let
ting them play tricks on your
ears. And tricks are definitely
not for kids in this case.
Eyes shut and ears open, one
heard a brilliant array of jazz,
fusion, rock and even classical
styles. One moment Jean-Luc
Ponty and his band performed,
while a few sees later a jazz pi
anist or a heavy metal rock
group played before your ears.
Even Mozart made a guest ap
pearance.
I guess you could call it
audible dreaming. I call it good
clean fun.
Just who is Tom Coster, you

ask? Nothing less than San
tana's former keyboardist. And
who are these Smiths and Jack
sons that accompany him in
concert? Steve Smith is (God
forbid) Journey's drummer and
Randy Jackson a bassist who
has put in time with Ponty,
Naranja, Michael Walden eta/.
— and not in jail, mind you.
Also joining Coster was an
other Ponty player, guitarist
Joaquim Lievano, and Tim
Gorman, who is about to leave
the Bay for recording
stints with Kenny Rogers and
The Who.
Each of the accompanyists
added their own personal
touches to the music, making
the show that much more excit
ing. Jackson and Lievano ac
cordingly brought the "Ponty
sound," rich yet fluid bass with
screaming yet crisp guitar.
Smith, played with the reckless
abandon usually associated
with a rock band of Journey's
caliber. Gormon, on syn
thesizer, played chords no
harder than those of
"Chopsticks" — although he
acted as if they were. (I think
pretentious is the word I'm

searching for.)
Coster, however, did not ap
pear to be largely influenced
by Santana. The only notice
able resemblence was the
sound of his guitar-foil
portable keyboard — un
mistakeably that of Carlos. The
real Coster sound ranges from
classical to straight jazz to
fusion to rock. All during the
concert I kept asking myself:
Will the real Tom Coster please
stand up? And each time a dif
ferent person got to his feet.
Not playing with Coster and
co. was Davey Pattison, lead
vocalist for Gamma. I'd heard
horror stories about Coster's
rock vocal tunes and I don't
think Pattison was missed — at
least not by me.
Consequently, most of Cos
ter's songs started slowly, with
a simple jazz fusion bassline,
and ended rockin', with
Lievano and Coster working up
a frenzy on their respective in
struments. At one point in the
show, the group taught a
course in musical evolution.
They started playing strictly
rock and roll, then broke the

tune down into fusion to
straight jazz and finally to clas
sical, with only Coster playing
an acoustic piano. Another
blink of the eye and it was back
to a cheap imitation of Smith's
Journey or Pattison's Gamma.
Many of Coster's songs were
off his latest album, entitledTC.
But herein lies the major flaw
in the concert. There was plen
ty of music to be played, but
just not enough of the good
stuff to render the show better
than average. Sure, TC serves
up a variety of music. But it is
not pesented as a smorgasbord
of sound, but closer to a
caferteria line. Quality is miss
ing, along with the china and
tablecloths.
As almost a self-confession
that his music was not up to par
with the talent present on the
Waldorf's stage, Coster and co.

closed the show with a wild and
wooly fusionistic tune, "Mos
cow Shuffle," written by a key
board friend of Lievano. It was
without a doubt the evening's
best song.
And just as different as each
player's musical style was each
of the five's on-stage person
ality. Coster was deadly serious
as he hit the notes on his vari
ous keyboards, like he needed
the gig to pay the rent on his
house. Jackson, who was by far
the most visible performer,
looks like a bowling ball with
arms and legs. He was simply
having the good clean fun.
Lievano, standing to Jackson's
right, fooled me. I thought he
was playing poker, not guitar,
when I saw his face —ex-
pressionless — before, during
and after a solo. Smith ap
peared like a Dead renegade
with curly locks of hair falling

from his balding head onto his
bearded face. What did he do
throughout the show?
Sweated. After the concert, he
looked as if he had just taken a
dip in the Bay. And Gorman?
Well, he was just along for the
ride.
Of the fab five, Jackson was
the night's most superb super
former. In fact, he literaly stole
the show with his versatile bag
of bass tricks, Jackson proved
to the audience that he can lay
down a mean bassline against
rock, fusion, straight jazz, soul,
or funk. However, one type of
music is in absentia — reggae.
But RJ (he's the Reggie Jackson
of fusion) further demon
strated his immortality by
playing his solo near the con
cert's end to a reggae beat. So
popular was the rotund bassist
that he couldn't hide one of his
trademark bass riffs in even the
loudest songs without drawing

an ovation. . WK ,.
Also impressive was Lievano.
At times he sounded like Al
DiMeola, while at others he im- "
itated Robben Ford. His best
quality was his ability to not
pretend he was Sammy
even for a moment, although,, u
the song might have
manded such a style. Since he
played for Ponty, Lievano has
the tools of speed and accuracy
— which he used to the band's
advantage.
""" ?6ster'slsest skills are his or- i *
ganizational ones. The key
boardist performs well in con
cert and has good stage pres-< ;
ence, although he seems a bit
nervous; a quiet performer, he
is sometimes too in
conspicuous. However,as he \ \
laments: "It takes one month j ►
to get a precious hour and a
half, but it is worth every
minute of it."
