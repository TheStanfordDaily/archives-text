# Berkeley Rep is putting the accent on heartbreak
## 
### Mike Hale Heart break House Berkeley Repertory 
The Berkeley Repertory Theatre has un
dertaken a production of Bernard Shaw'd
Heartbreak House, which may seem like a
pretty safe move until you remember that
a very successful production of the
samo play just three years ago. Berkeley
Rep's decision to do the play, even at this dis
tance in time, can't help but seem like a
challenge to the larger company across the
Bay, and anyone who has seen both produc
tions.ban't avoid making comparisons.
As! it turns out, though, the comparisons
are very hard to make, because the two com
panies have taken opposite tacks — Berkeley
Rep's" small-scale, humanistic Heartbreak
House is almost a different play than the
greakmetaphysical machine ACT put on the
stagtTm 1979. The question of which is better
gets'-lost in the question of which takes the
better. approach.

ACT certainly put on a more impressive
show, but the BRT production brings out
aspects of the play muted in, or entirely miss
ing from, the earlier production. Of course,
the bases for both interpretations are there
in Shaw's text — while Heartbreak House is
every bit the play of ideas one expects from
Shaw, he put into it a more sympathetic set of
characters and a more realistic portrayal of
emotions than, perhaps, he achieved in any
other play. And what the differences in the
two local productions may prove is that Shaw
never successfully brought together the two
sides of the play, something that can only be
discovered on stage. The moments that
seemed magnificent at ACT tend to fizzle in
Berkeley, and the scenes that seem just right
in the BRT production are ones you don't
even remember seeing in San Francisco.
The configuration and size of the East Bay
company's lovely mainstage enforce a cer
tain intimacy on BRT's efforts, and director
Albert Takazauckas has concentrated on

those elements of Heartbreak House which
are closest to domestic drama — his em
phasis is more on the "heartbreak" than on
the "house," if we make the house stand for
the rather apocalyptic social commentary
which surfaces in the last scenes.
Takazauckas shows us that, despite the dis
quisitions on capitalism and war and ennui
which pepper the play, we can be engaged
by the characters as individuals rather than as
types to a degree unusual in Shaw. In this
play Shaw has allowed power between the
characters to be determined by love and/or
desire, rather than strictly by money .
Captain Shotover's second-act line, "Co,
Boss Mangan; and when you have found the
land where there is happiness and where
there are no women, send me its latitude and
longitude," and Hesione's line at the end of
the play when the bombing is over, "But
what a glorious experience I hope they'll
come again tomorrow night," are good ref
erence points for the advantages and disad

vantages of BRT's approach. In the ACT pro
duction, where the relationships between
men and women served only to advance the
plot and Shotover became a sort of prophet
on the poopdeck, a land without women
didn't seem like such a big deal; to get the
full comic effect out of the line, Shotover
had to climb up on a balcony and yell it out
to the cast gathered below. The BRT Shot
over (Joseph Miksak) can afford to say the
line in a normal tone, just for Boss Mangan's
benefit, and it's much funnier and more tell
ing. With Hesione's line, and the last scene in
general, the situation is reversed. The ACT
production built up to this moment (which
doesn't really follow from anything Hesione
has said before; if anyone could say this, it
would be Hector), and, with the help of fire
works and lights, it was quite poetic. In BRT's
version, you like the characters too much for
this to work; it's jarring when Hector goes
crazy about the lights, and Hesione wishes
the dirigible would come back, and we feel

cheated by the ending.
The BRT cast was generally excellent; only
Miksak's Shotover wasn't up to par. This may
have been a result of his weak attempt at a
British accent; I kept getting a horrible feel
ing I was seeing John Wayne on stage in a
Shaw play. Hope Alexander-Willis and Kim
berley King, as the sisters Hesione and
Ariadne, and David Booth, as Hesione's hus
band Hector, keep the production moving,
even though they all at times seem to have
stumbled in from a Noel Coward script. The
performances are strictly conventional, in a
parlor comedy manner, but these three have
the polish required to keep us awake.
As usual at BRT, the production is extreme
ly handsome, without being gaudy and os
tentatious in the grand ACT manner. Jesse
Hollis's beautiful sets and backdrops are an
other triumph for Berkeley Rep, which con
sistently makes better use of color and de
sign in setting the atmosphere of a produc
tion than anyone else in the area.
