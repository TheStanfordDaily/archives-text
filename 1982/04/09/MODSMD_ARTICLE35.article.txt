# Living in the material world: rock/fusion goes jazz for bucks
## 
### Ted Glola Griffith Park Circle Star Theatre/ San Carlos 
3 April 1982
Only a few years back the
pre-eminent jazz artist could
be n (distinguished from the
crojyd by his ability to develop
a style and a sound that was
uniquely his own.
In. .retrospect, such an at
titude shows great naivete on
the part of the musicians.
Much better is the philosophy
exhibited by contemporary
jazzmen such as Herbie Han
cock, Freddie Hubbard or
Stanley Clarke — these artists
have learned that financial
benefits accrue to those who
are Willing to change their style
to match whatever type of jazz
is selling at the given moment.
Cofftequently the last decade
has l£ "given us the puzzling
phenomenon of jazz musicians
whtf*change their styles more
often than a wino changes his
brand preference for spirits.
Because of this, I always view

with suspicion events such as
Saturday's concert by the
group "Griffith Park" at the
Circle Star Theater. Griffith
Park is made up of five musi
cians — Chick Corea, Freddie
Hubbard, Joe Henderson,
Stanley Clarke, and Lenny
White — who have been large
ly associated with jazz-rock
fusion, but who have now
banded together to play so
phisticated mainstream jazz (at
least for the duration of their
present concert tour).
One questions the sincerity
of the musicians in making this
abrupt stylistic change. The
thought comes to mind (a mali
cious and no doubt unjust one)
that perhaps these musicians
are simply trying to make mon
ey from two different markets
(the fusion and the main
stream) with little concern for
musical integrity. Like the simi
larly heralded V.S.O.P. band of
1978, which likewise featured a
group of prominent fusion mu
sicians playing straight-ahead
jazz, this group, one expects,
will soon break up and there

spective musicians will head
back to the lucrative world of
funk and jazz-rock.
But if one doubts the sincer
ity of the musicians comprising
Griffith Park, one cannot doubt
their technical expertise. Satur
day's performance was an ex
citing and well-placed concert
which featured these five musi
cians at what one suspects is
the peak of their abilities.
Corea and Henderson, who
recently performed in an
acoustic setting at the San Fran
cisco Jazz Festival, played sig
nificantly better than they had
at that event. On Monk's "I
Mean You" which closed the
first half of the show, both
played with Monkish disregard
of bar lines, anticipating and
delaying the chord changes
and lingering on wry dis
sonances. Elsewhere Corea
played with uncharacteristic
rhythmic vitality — on Clarke's
piece "Why Wait," Chick fash
ioned a sparse block chord solo
which was totally out of keep
ing with the typical linear ap
proach of this fertile im

proviser.
Both on this number and
elsewhere, Stanley Clarke
proved himself to be the
catalyst that inspired the other
musicians. With his massive
hands, which make him the
Connie Hawkin of the jazz
world, he seems to be all over
his bass at once. When he plays
the smaller electric bass one
almost expects the playful
Clarke to hide it in the palm of
his hand. But on the larger up
right bass, Stanley and his in
strument are the perfect match
for each other. His playing is
rhythmically strong and strik
ingly creative, and his interplay
with Corea is uncanny.
Clarke is strong as a soloist;
and as an accompanist shows a
sense of dynamics that is rare
among jazz musicians in gener
al and almost completely
absent among bassists. On Cor
ea's "October Ballad" Clarke
took a triplet which Henderson
included in his solo, and played
it behind him in the bassline a
second later. Throughout Sat
urday's performance he de

monostrated a subtlety and
taste that is curiously absent on
a number of his more com
mercial albums.
Freddie Hubbard, like Cor
ea, seemed to be especially in
spired by Clarke's playing.
Apart from some empty theat
rics a la Maynard Ferguson,
Hubbard gave a solid per
formance. Hubbard's tech
nique is formidable but it is
most formidable when he
tames it and stays away from
the endless trills and acrobatic
leaps that are a constant temp
tation to any virtuoso in
strumentalist.
Joe Henderson's placid im
mobility is reminiscent of the
demeanor of a contemplative
Buddha. The appearance,
however, is only visual; if Hen
derson's body stands still, his
music is running all over. He is
a driving saxophonist that one
imagines would be a for
midable opponent in a jam ses
sion. Like Hubbard, he is often
prone to indulge in flights of
facile virtuosity, but on Satur
day night he gave a more re

strained performance. On
"Here's That Rainy Day,"he
frequently referred to Jimmy
Van Heusen's original melody
in his solo, and used that both
as a springboard for his im
provisation, and also as a
source for thematic material.
The audience was large, and
surprisingly young, with a size
able proportion of what ap

peared to be high school stu
dents. One can only hope that
when the individual members
of Griffith Park go back to the
lucrative world of fusion they
leave behind some of their au
dience to enjoy the fruits of
hard-driving jazz. Certainly
Saturday's performance was as
fine a demonstration of that
genre as any could wish for.
