# Matthau the saving grace in very familiar 'Pictures'
## 
### Christine Roum I Oughts Be In Pictures 
Out of the shadows of a dimly lit
bedroom emerges a man who looks as if he
has been in hibernation since the winter of
1971. He gropes his way to the bathroom.
We hear the flush. He emerges again,
lights a cigarette, and sucks long and deep.
Scratching his matted hair he shuffles over
to Mr. Coffee, pours a cup, explaining to
his unexpected guest that he does not
speak English before noon. Such is the way
Herbie Tucker meets his daughter Libby
whom he has not seen in 16 years, and such
is the way we are introduced to Walter
Matthau's disarming performance in Neil
Simon's latest film, "I Ought To Be In Pic
tures."
Matthau's performance, however, is
one of the only interesting things about
the film since the theme and plot are repe
titions of last year's screen adaptation of Si
mon's "The Gingerbread Lady," "Only
When I Laugh." A spunky young person
descends upon a wayward parent to de
mand a relationship of them. In this proc
ess the kid gives the parent some valuable
lessons about commitment, and the result
is a charming partnership between parent
and child. The effect of divorce on a child
is a universal theme, and the characters are
easily identifiable.
Simon gets away with this lack of
uniqueness by seeing these common hu
man situations from a humorous and sensi
tive perspective. However, the only per
former who carries off the tragicomic na
ture of his role is Simon-veteran Matthau

who is the saving grace of this slow-starting
film.
Herbie Tucker is a middle-aged struggl
ing screenwriter in Hollywood who has
espoused himself only to non-commit
ment in his lifetime. He is not dedicated to
his work, his girlfriend, or, obviously, his
estranged family. When his daughter ap
pears on his doorstep to claim her due,
Herbie Tucker's life turns around.
Matthau plays the lazy, lovable coot with
subtlety and finesse. When Herbie is
moved to play the typical parent he does
so with such understatement that the hu
mor and struggle are delicately balanced.
He knows just how much to give and how
much to hold back so that we are never
bored.
This refinement is lacking, however, in
Dinah Manoff's performance of Libby
Tucker. Manoff made her Broadway debut
playing the same role in the original stage
version of "Pictures," and it brought her
the Tony Award for 1980. Disappointingly,
Manoff does not make a good transition
from stage to screen in her performance.
She bulldozes her way through the humor
and the gutsy side of her Brooklynite char
acter. In doing so she sacrifices the vulner
ability that underlies all of her actions in
the story. When she does try to be vulner
able if comes off as false and awkward be
cause it has not been developed.
Even in what could be touching con
versations with her deceased grand
mother, she fails to soften the edge. In
deed, her entrance into the film is a visit to
grandma's grave. When she cannot find
the site she pops off with "What'd ya do

Grandma, move?" and proceeds to iniSct
sharp one-iiners on the groundskeefer
and another bystander. After only the first
two minutes of the film we have hid
enough of Libby Tucker.
' H
Ann-Margaret's refreshing Rr#r
formance as Herbie's girlfriend, Stiiffy
Blondell, contrasts with Manoff's. She isjio
longer the sex kitten of her earlier 4«' s »
nor is she a wild woman swimminglin
baked beans as she was in "Tommy.'jpn
stead, we see a wise, gentle woman whs is
perceptive enough to stand back anoM
low the father and daughter to cometfa
gether without interfering.
As a film in its own right, "Picture*" is
not much to speak of except for
performance, and as a Neil Simon filmft is
a disappointment. Simon's forte is the abil
ity to show the common in a sensitlve'Jfid
humorous light through dialogue
characterization. Herbie and Libby ar&aot
working out their problem on a cruisjgto
the Carribean, but in Herbie's dingy apart
ment and at the market in front of the Mug
gies and the Cat Chow. But even this
tifiability fails to make the film worthwhile.
Frankly, audiences are up to their niwels
in Neil Simon. We have been
with his work, and it is wearing thin. JjoJces
about the, ahem, lack of rain in California
and the abundance of palm trees areftjow
predictable. Producer-director Herbert
Ross, who also directed the original s&ge
version of "Pictures," does little
vitalize the play for film. Again, its saving
grace is the performance of Walter Mat
thauwhois —as ever —a joy to see. £2

playing the same role in the original stage
version of "Pictures," and it brought her
the Tony Award for 1980. Disappointingly,
Manoff does not make a good transition
from stage to screen in her performance.
She bulldozes her way through the humor
and the gutsy side of her Brooklynite char
acter. In doing so she sacrifices the vulner
ability that underlies all of her actions in
the story. When she does try to be vulner
able if comes off as false and awkward be
cause it has not been developed.
Even in what could be touching con
versations with her deceased grand
mother, she fails to soften the edge. In
deed, her entrance into the film is a visit to
grandma's grave. When she cannot find
the site she pops off with "What'd ya do

Grandma, move?" and proceeds to iniSct
sharp one-iiners on the groundskeefer
and another bystander. After only the first
two minutes of the film we have hid
enough of Libby Tucker.

As a film in its own right, "Picture*" is
not much to speak of except for
performance, and as a Neil Simon filmft is
a disappointment. Simon's forte is the abil

humorous light through dialogue
characterization. Herbie and Libby ar&aot
working out their problem on a cruisjgto
the Carribean, but in Herbie's dingy apart
ment and at the market in front of the Mug
gies and the Cat Chow. But even this
tifiability fails to make the film worthwhile.
Frankly, audiences are up to their niwels
in Neil Simon. We have been
with his work, and it is wearing thin. JjoJces
about the, ahem, lack of rain in California
and the abundance of palm trees areftjow
predictable. Producer-director Herbert
Ross, who also directed the original s&ge
version of "Pictures," does little
vitalize the play for film. Again, its saving
grace is the performance of Walter Mat

Walter Matthau in "I Ought to be in Pictures"
Out of the shadows of a dimly lit
bedroom emerges a man who looks as if he
has been in hibernation since the winter of
1971. He gropes his way to the bathroom.
We hear the flush. He emerges again,
lights a cigarette, and sucks long and deep.
Scratching his matted hair he shuffles over
to Mr. Coffee, pours a cup, explaining to
his unexpected guest that he does not
speak English before noon. Such is the way
Herbie Tucker meets his daughter Libby
whom he has not seen in 16 years, and such
is the way we are introduced to Walter
Matthau's disarming performance in Neil
Simon's latest film, "I Ought To Be In Pic
tures."
Matthau's performance, however, is
one of the only interesting things about
the film since the theme and plot are repe
titions of last year's screen adaptation of Si
mon's "The Gingerbread Lady," "Only
When I Laugh." A spunky young person
descends upon a wayward parent to de
mand a relationship of them. In this proc
ess the kid gives the parent some valuable
lessons about commitment, and the result
is a charming partnership between parent
and child. The effect of divorce on a child
is a universal theme, and the characters are
easily identifiable.
Simon gets away with this lack of
uniqueness by seeing these common hu
man situations from a humorous and sensi
tive perspective. However, the only per
former who carries off the tragicomic na
ture of his role is Simon-veteran Matthau

who is the saving grace of this slow-starting
film.
Herbie Tucker is a middle-aged struggl
ing screenwriter in Hollywood who has
espoused himself only to non-commit
ment in his lifetime. He is not dedicated to
his work, his girlfriend, or, obviously, his
estranged family. When his daughter ap
pears on his doorstep to claim her due,
Herbie Tucker's life turns around.
Matthau plays the lazy, lovable coot with
subtlety and finesse. When Herbie is
moved to play the typical parent he does
so with such understatement that the hu
mor and struggle are delicately balanced.
He knows just how much to give and how
much to hold back so that we are never
bored.
This refinement is lacking, however, in
Dinah Manoff's performance of Libby
Tucker. Manoff made her Broadway debut
playing the same role in the original stage
version of "Pictures," and it brought her
the Tony Award for 1980. Disappointingly,
Manoff does not make a good transition
from stage to screen in her performance.
