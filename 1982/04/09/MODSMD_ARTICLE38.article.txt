Guano

; The Godfather Parts I & II
Fox, Redwood City
Taken as a whole, this 6Vi-hour
work is the movie equivalent of
the Great American Novel: this
Francis Coppola masterwork is an
'epic, juicy, lustful and violent
. look at the criminal subculture in
America — its ugliness; its vital
ity; its rigid, peculiar ethics.
Part I is three hours of flashy,
lurid excitement — the greatest
gangster movie ever made. The
, then-largely unknown Coppola
took Mario Puzo's pulp novel
and came up with something
greater than anyone (except
Coppola?) expected. Marlon
Brando fills his cheeks with or
ange peels and talks in a tired,
beaten, world-wise voice; the
movie revolves around his .com
'pelling presence as Vito Cor
' leone, the Godfather.
Part II is a little messy around
the edges, but still very great.
More subdued, more introspec
tive than its predecessor, this se
quel sometimes lacks the vulgar
energy that drove the first movie,
but Part II is more textured, more
complex, more troubling. And
Coppola and cinematographer
Gordon Willis' recreation of the
little Italy of 1920s New York
makes an adjective like evocative
seem inadequate.
Remarkable performances
abound in both movies; those by
. Brando, Al Pacino, James Caan,
Talia Shire, Lee Strasberg,
Michael Gazzo and the late John
Cazale are especially
noteworthy.
Plays tonight and Saturday.

McCabe and Mrs. Miller
Friday, Kresge
This, with MM*5*H and Nash
ville, is one of director Robert
Altman's best movies. Warren
Beatty and Julie Christie star in
this snowy western; she runs a
whorehouse in the town he
stumbles into. They're not really
compatible, but it's almost in
evitable that they fall in love. It's a
hopeless, doomed romance — as
nearly all the great movie ro
mances are — and a great movie,
n r ) r ' / — Jim Mattson
Pennies from Heaven *★★★
New Varsity, Palo Alto
A great movie musical — per
haps the most complex and
astonishing ever made. The set
ting is Depression-era Chicago;
the theme is the need for illusion.
The characters (impeccably acted
by Steve Martin, Jessica Harper,
Vernal Bagneris, John McMartin,
Christopher Walken and espe
cially Bernadette Peters) are so
stunted by poverty and sexual
frustration that they respond to
their misery by turning it into mu
sical comedy. In the numbers,
they mouth popular songs of the
period while the director,
Herbert Ross, and choreo
grapher, Danny Daniels, spin off
in all directions from Busby
Berkeley and Astaire and Rogers
and other mainstays of the film
musicals of the '30s. This is a mov
ie of incredible emotional in
tensity, written by Dennis Potter
and shot and designed in the style
of Edward Hopper.
Tonight only with Zoot Suit.
— Steve Vineberg

Clash of the Titans
Menlo Cinema, Menlo Park
The acting is wooden and the
mythology suspect, but the spe
cial effects, and the set pieces in
volving them, are often magical.
They were created by Ray Har
ryhausen, the man who did the
effects for Jason and the
Argonauts. Harryhausen is the
cinema's greatest practitioner of
stop-motion animation, the same
technique that made the 18-inch
high King Kong threaten New
York. Harryhausen's puppet
characters in Clash of the Titans
include a flying horse and, most
spectacularly, a Medusa that
would do any monster-maker
proud. This movie should be
great for kids: it's heroic and not
too violent.

My Fair Lady ★**
Fox, Redwood City
George Cukor directed this
rather stodgy film adaptation of
the Lerner and Loewe musical.
Though it's not a great movie, the
play and the music are so appeal
ing that they more than outweigh
any weaknesses in direction and
pacing. As nearly everyone
knows, My Fair Lady is based on
the Shaw play, "Pygmalian" (or,
more accurately, it's based on the
screenplay Shaw worked up for
the 1938 movie version). Rex Har
rison, recreating his stage role,
plays linguistics expert Henry
Higgins; Audrey Hepburn plays
the dialectically underpriveleged
Eliza Doolittle. Lerner and Loewe
supplied the tunes: "I Could
Have Danced All Night," "On the
Street Where You Live," "I've
Grown Accustomed to Her
Face," and many others.
Plays Sunday and Monday.

Life of Brian ★★
Saturday, Cubberley
Sort of like Godspell with dirty
jokes. Several brilliant sketches
are lost in the drivel; it's all funny,
but it goes on for much too long.
The Monty Python troupe takes
aim at Biblical epics, terrorist
logistics, and the PLO; while they
don't always score, in this form
even a string of bullseyes would
be boring. A Python movie needs
a better plot than the Bible can
provide.
Plays tomorrow and Friday
with another Python movie,
Monty Python and the Holy Grail.
— Mike Hale
Whose Life is it Anyway? ★Vi
New Vanity, Palo Alto
Kenneth McMillan gives an ex
tremely intelligent, varied, low
key and even moving per
formance in the thankless role of
the judge in the last 20 minutes of
this otherwise hopeless movie,
based on Brian Clark's stage hit.
It's about a sculptor who survives
a horrendous car accident but
becomes a quadraplegic and sues
for the right to be allowed to die.
Richard Dreyfuss struggles man
fully with an impossible role that
he isn't really right for: he isn't a
physical enough actor to suggest,
in the pre-accident and flashback
dream sequences, that the loss of
his hands has really rendered life
useless for him.
Starts next Thursday with One
Flew over the Cuckoo's Nest.
— S.V.

Bringing Up Baby****
Festival Cinema, Palo Alto
One of the great American di
rectors — Howard Hawks —
directed two of the great Ameri
can actors — Cary Grant and
Katherine Hepburn — in one of
the great American comedies.
Grant plays a befuddled paleon
tologist, and the actor's comic gift
is so humane and well-tuned that
he gives even befuddlement a
kind of moral dignity. Hepburn is
very funny and incredibly pretty
as the screwball heiress who
works to put the random element
back into Grant's life. And the
movie's peculiar triangle is com
pleted by Baby, played entirely
naturalistically by a leopard.
Plays through Wednesday with
Stage Door.

On Golden Pond *
Park Theater, Menlo Park
The two central characters are
a retired professor approaching
his 80th birthday (Henry Fonda,
who manages to retain his digni
ty) and his wife, who is ten years
his junior. He is ornery and foxy;
she is affectionate and sage. This
is the kind of movie in which
loons and sunsets and trout and
Jane Fonda's backflip are used as
emblems of survival and longev
ity and marital bliss and familial
reconciliation. To be avoided at
all costs.
— S.V.
Prince of the City*
New Vanity, Palo Alto
In short, deliberate takes, the
cast performs as though they'd
spent days in an overheated
steam room — we don't get any
rest from their bug-eyed, over
heated actorishness. Every scene
begins at its climax, so that we
never understand what drove
these people to such extreme
states of hysteria. Sidney Lumet,
who directed and co-wrote the
script (with Jay Presson Allen),
seems to think he has something
so important to say in this movie
about police corruption that they
don't have to bother structuring
it or modulating the tone or es
tablishing motivation for the
characters — but it's almost im
possible to figure out what he is
saying. Treat Williams stars, but
the only good performance is
given by Jerry Orbach.
Plays Tuesday and Wednesday
with Serpico.
— S.V.
Missing ***
Palo Alto Square
Costa-Ga vras' political
melodrama take place in Chile
during the 1973 coup, but it
seems to be set in hell. The film,
made with an open leftist bias, is a
stunning demonstration of what
it is like to be in a country in a
state of seige, and as the wife of
the missing American, Sissy
Spacek does her best work in
years. However, there is a second
plot — the politicization of her
father-in-law, dreadfully played
by Jack Lemmon — that nearly
wrecks the movie.
— S.V.

Reds ***Vi
Mountain View Theater
An intelligent, unconven
tional, craftsmanlike movie, re
markably coherent and sus
tained. The first part, most of
which is given over to the
burgeoning relationship be
tween reporter-revolutionary
Jack Reed (Warren Beatty) and
would-be writer Louise Bryant
(Diane Keaton), could stand
restructuring, but in part two, af
ter the experience of the Russian
Revolution, the two characters
are jerked into adulthood, and
they turn out to be fascinating
people whose interaction truly
holds the screen. Beatty and
Keaton's acting may never have
been better than it is in the last 90
minutes, and they are superbly
supported by Jack Nicholson as
Eugene O'Neill and Maureen
Stapleton as Emma Goldman.
— S.V.
Quest for Fire ***V2
Fine Arts, Palo Alto
A lovely surprise. Jean-Jacques
Annaud's movie is an un-cynical
account of the struggle of early
homo sapiens to find fire; it is
huge and impressive but Annaud
has concentrated on a very strong
narrative line. Annaud not only
captures his hero Naoh's sense of
wonder at the discovery of new
marvels; in the best tradition of
literature and film, he shares it.
Annaud has used his actors won
derfully (Everett McGill and Rae
Dawn Chong are especially
good), though perhaps the movie
needs a little more humor.
-S.V.
One Flew over the Cuckoo's
Nest ****
New Varsity, Palo Alto
Ken Kesey's McMurphy was
the role Jack Nicholson was born
to play, and judging by the way
Nicholson roars through the role,
it's apparent he knows it.
McMurphy, a man who feigns in
sanity in order to be sent to a
mental institution rather than
prison, is a lot like Nicholson:
they're both either the craziest or
the sanest of the bunch. No
where has Nicholson's manic in
tensity been used to better ad- I
vantage.
Louise Fletcher and Brad
Dourif are also outstanding.
Milos Forman directed; Vilmos
Zsigmond did the fine cinemato
graphy.
Starts next Thursday.
— J.M.
Rebecca ****
Fox, Redwood City
Rebecca, based on the novel
by Daphne du Maurier, was
Alfred Hitchcock's first American
movie. Lawrence Olivier marries
sweet young Joan Fontaine and
brings her home to manage his
estate; complications arise when
she can't reach the standards set
by Olivier's late, first wife. Fon
taine's character is so timid that
we never learn her name (the title
refers to the dead wife), and she
creeps about the mansion like a
tourist in a museum after closing
time. Hitchcock's rendering of
the mansion's oppressiveness is
very fine — he makM gloom
seem tangible.
Plays Tuesday and Wednesday
with Olivier's adaptation of
Hamlet.
