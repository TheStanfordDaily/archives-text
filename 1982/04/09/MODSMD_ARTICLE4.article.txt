# Lighty COP slate committed to 'innovative education â€™
## 
### Kathy Olmsted Senior staff writer 
More responsiveness to the needs of students is the main
campaign theme of the Council of Presidents (COP) slate com
posed of Michael Lighty, Eloisa Carrillo, Robin Cooper and
Doris Wilson.
The Lighty slate will oppose the BET'M (Beckstrom-Epstein-
Townsend-Mathewson) slate in the April 14 and 15 elections.
Members of the Lighty slate come primarily from leadership
positions in student organizations; members of the BET'M slate
are mainly drawn from leadership positions within the ASSU
government.
Although members of the Lighty slate concede that they have
much less experience in the ASSU than their opponents, they
maintain that such a lack of familiarity with the internal politic
king of the ASSU is actually an advantage.

"Sometimes being in an office could remove you somewhat
from student input," said Carrillo.
Insisting that a lack of experience within the ASSU is not a "li
ability," Carrillo said her slate's roots in voluntary organizations
allowed them to be "more responsive to the students." A junior
involved in many Chicano organizations on campus, Carrillo
said she felt her slate has an added sensitivity to the needs of the
student body and the minority community.
Cooper, a junior majoring in international relations, stressed
that playing leadership roles in student organizations enabled
her slate to gain management experience while maintaining
contact with the students. She said officials within the ASSU
government often enact decisions without realizing the full im
plications of such actions on individual students and student
groups.
"It's very easy to be at a distance from the students, to be so

caught up in politics tha you lose your perspective/' said Coop
er. "We have a more comprehensive understanding of the im
pact of the ASSU."
Carrillo said that although the members of her slate did not
have the particular type of experience acquired by experience
in ASSU government positions, they all had administrative and
organizational experience attained as the leaders of voluntary
students groups.
Carrillo said she felt the ASSU offices should provide a "learn
ing experience" to the greatest possible number of students
who wish to acquire management skills.
Wilson, a junior in political science and the Black Student
Union Co-Chairperson, said that better communication be
tween the COP and the student body would improve the "ad
ministrative bureaucracy" that presently exists in the ASSU and
realize the COP's full potential.
Lighty, student co-director of
SWOPSI, also emphasized the "de
centralized, bottom-up" experience
of his slate as opposed to the "cen
tralized, top-down" approach of the
BET'M slate.
All four members of the Lighty
slate cited the need to combat finan
cial aid cutbacks as the primary issue
of their candidacy. While they said
they didn't anticipate making a
cy statement about the cuts on the
behalf of the ASSU, they said it is im
portant for the COP to disseminate
information about the cuts to the stu
dents and advise students on meth
ods to combat the cuts.
