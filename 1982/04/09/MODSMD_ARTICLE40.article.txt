# Nuclear arms debate raises issues, tempers
## 
### David Azrin 
Sparks flew between panelists and
members of the audience last night
over the proposed nuclear arms
freeze at a symposium here entitled
the "Defense Revolt."
Panelists included Joseph Kraft,
syndicated columnist; Sidney Drell.
director of research at the Stanford
Linear Accelerator (SLAC); John Lew
is, professor of political science and
director of the Stanford arms control
and disarmament program; Robert
Barker, weapons analyst at the Law
rence Livermore laboratories; and
Mark Kramer, student and Rhodes
Scholar.
The symposium, intended to focus
on the opposition that is growing
within government circles towards
the Reagan administration's defense
policies, soon became a heated dis
cussion of the popular opposition
that is mounting here.

In response to a question concern
ing the proposed nuclear freeze,
both Kramer and Barker cited flaws
in the proposal, including problems
in verification, relations with allies
and stabilization.
Barker said his biggest fear was that
supporters of the freeze movement
were "undermining the people's
faith in their government's repre
sentative and political processes."
Barker said people may begin to see
their government as "unresponsive
to the population" when it actually is
not.
Lewis, who said he has signed a
petition supporting a nuclear freeze,
then broke his role as the sym
posium's mediator to jump into the
discussion.
He emphasized that the many im
portant government leaders who
signed the nuclear freeze proposal
"felt that there had to be a major po

litical statement on the part of the
representative government about
something most people regarded as
the least next step in arms control."
The Aiinenberg Auditorium au
dience of about 75 responded with a
loud round of applause.
Columnist Kraft, who remained re
moved f r om the argument, said that

while he understands the people's
opposition to nuclear weapons, es
pecially in light of the Reagan ad
minsitration's casual comments
about nuclear war, he warned of the
dangers of "playing mobilization pol
itics."
"We ought to be more respon
sible, avoid making extreme
statements, avoid being self-in
dulgent. Since everybody here
agrees that peace is better than war, I
hope that the peace movement does
not become the vehicle for a
backlash or counter-movement that
would indeed set back disarma
ment," he said.
In response, one member of the
audience cried out, "Then what do
propose we do?"
Kraft said he wanted to avoid the
politics of the Vietnam peace move
ment which he called "a failure."
