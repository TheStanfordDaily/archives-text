Correction
The headline over Wednesday's story on the Values, Technology and
Society (VTS) program incorrectly implied that a student can now re
ceive a degree in Science, Technology and Society (STS). In fact, accord
ing to Adjunct Prof. Robert McGinn, the STS program is a structured
track through the individually designed major program. A student who
chooses such a program will receive a degree in Undergraduate Studies.
The STS program is now on an Intermediate level between purely ad
hoc majors and majors approved by the faculty senate.
In addition, the story incorrectly identified McGinn as the "head of
VTS." In fact, Prof. Walter Vincenti, associate dean of undergraduate
studies, is the VTS department chairman.
The Daily regrets the errors.
