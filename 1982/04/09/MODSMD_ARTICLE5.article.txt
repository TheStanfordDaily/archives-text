Thatcher demands Falkland withdrawal
London — Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher declared yesterday that
Argentine withdrawal from the Falkland Islands was an "absolute re
quirement" before there can be any negotiation or solution to the
crisis.
Her tough line, backed up by a British blockade of the disputed is
lands that goes into effect Monday, is the only authorized message that
Secretary of State Alexander Haig will carry from London to Buenos
Aires today.
Haig arrived here yesterday afternoon to offer American services to
resolve the crisis that began with Argentine occupation of the British
colony a week ago today. The islands lie 400 miles east of the Argentine
coast, and at least two nuclear-powered British attack submarines will
be on station there by Sunday, British sources said.
Haig went straight to the Foreign Office for a meeting with Foreign
Secretary Francis Pym. An hour later he crossed Downing Street and
met Thatcher for an hour-and-a-half. Haig then hurried to a three-hour
working dinner with six American and six British diplomats.
Meanwhile, underscoring the British policy of brinksmanship, De
fense Minister John Nott, who attended the Downing Street dinner yes
terday, told an American television interviewer unequivocably that
"We will shoot first."
"From Monday morning, we will sink them,"
Nott said. "Let them come out. We will impose a
200-mile blockade against their forces. If they
wish to challenge, then we will see the results.
"Most certainly, we will shoot first within the
200-mile limit," he added. "We have made it
quite clear that we are not prepared to nego
tiate anything until the Argentine forces
withdraw from our territory."
Nott added that Britain had no proposals for
Haig to carry to Buenos Aires. "We're not nego
tiating," he said. "If he has ideas we will listen,
but he's not here as a mediator and we've made
that quite clear."
At least two British nuclear-powered attack
submarines will take positions between the
Falkland Islands and the Argentine coast begin
ning on Sunday. However, their ultimate orders
to fire once an Argentine warship is within tor
pedo range must still come from London and
the prime minister. Thus, it is not automatic that
a naval target will be fired on Monday morning.
Argentina forms military zone
Buenos Aires — Argentina, after formally in
stalling Wednesday what it promised would be
a moderate military government in the Falkland
Islands, responded early yesterday to Britain's
threat of naval action by creating a new military
zone of its own around the Falklands and de
claring it will act in self-defense there "at any
time."
Responding to the announcement by Britain
that any Argentine warship within 200 miles of
the Falklands would be subject to attack starting
Monday, the Argentine communique said an
admiral had been appointed to supervise the
new military operation zone, which was de
fined as encompassing 200 miles along the Ar
gentine mainland and around the Falkland Is
lands.
Argentine Ambassador Esteban Takacs said in
Washington that the British decision to declare
"a formal blockade 200 miles around the
Malvinas (Falkland) Islands is a measure of ex
treme gravity." He expressed particular con
cern that the British had acted after both sides
had agreed to a mediation effort by Secretary of
State Alexander Haig "in which we have great
confidence."
The Argentine response to Britain's initiative
came after a day in which Argentine officials re
peatedly had stressed their willingness to medi
ate with Britain.
Budget differences narrow
Washington — Top-level administration and
congressional negotiators were reported yes
terday to be making "good progress'" on a new
plan to reduce projected budget deficits but

awaited word from President Ronald Reagan on
their tentative proposals.
Sen. Pete Domenici (R-N.M.) chairman of the
Senate Budget Committee, said the differences
between the bipartisan team of lawmakers and
White House representatives have been nar
rowed significantly.
"We are at a stage when the president himself
will have to give us some idea of his judgment
on our package," Domenici said in a statement
in Albuquerque, N.M. A copy was made avail
able in Washington.
"We recognize that no agreement on a pack
age will pass both the Senate and House this
year without the enthusiastic support of the
president," Domenici said.
Domenici disclosed that Reagan asked him to
cancel a meeting of the budget committee that
had been scheduled for Tuesday to start draft
ing an alternative to Reagan's deficit-laden
budget.
Domenici agreed, delaying the session in
definitely in view of the "delicate negotiations"
until a decision has been reached on whether a
compromise plan can win the approval of Rea
gan and O'Neill.
Congressional sources said another nego
tiating session would be held early next week,
possibly Tuesday, to get some reaction from the
president to the options discussed in three
weeks of closed-door talks.
The aim is to reduce the federal budget defi
cits for the next three fiscal years from the rec
ord-high levels foreseen under Reagan's
budget, starting with an estimated $96.4 billion
in the 1983 year starting Oct. 1.
Reagan offers aid in Barbados
Bridgetown, Barbados — President Ronald
Reagan tried a carrot-and-stickapproach with
five tiny east Caribbean countries yesterday,
coupling a promise of U.S. economic aid with a
warning about the dangers of following the
Cuban and Soviet economic and political sys
tem.
Reagan bluntly spelled out the conditions of
U.S. assistance in after-lunch remarks to leaders
of the five island nations.
"El Salvador isn't the only country that's
being threatened with Marxism, and I think all
of us are concerned with the overturn of West
minster parliamentary democracy in Grenada,"
Reagan said. "That country now bears the Sovi
et and Cuban trademark, which means it will at
tempt to spread the virus among its neighbors."
The president's comments continued the
harsh anti-Cuban line he has taken during his
five-day self-styled "working holiday" in the
Caribbean. On Wednesday night in Jamaica he
said that the Cuban experiment in Marxism, "a
philosophy alien to this hemisphere," had

meant "economic deprivation and political re
pression" for the Cuban people.
Arab students protest beating
Jerusalem — Hundreds of Arab students from
Bethlehem University took over the town's mu
nicipal building for five hours yesterday to pro
test the beating of two university officials by an
armed vigilante squad they said consisted of
members of the Israeli-supported village
leagues of the West Bank.
The protest followed increasing complaints
by West Bank Palestinians that members of the
leagues, armed by the Israeli Army ostensibly
for self-protection, have been conducting vigi
lante operations to intimidate opponents and
recruit support for the pro-Israel Arab or
ganization.
Mustafa Dudeen, head of the Hebron region
village leagues, denied that his organization
was involved in the incident. Israeli Army of
ficials said an investigation was under way.
Bethlehem Mayor Elias Freij and university
officials negotiated an end to the siege as Israeli
troops surrounded the building and sealed off
the town. The students demanded that the Is
raeli occupation government disarm members
of the village leagues, which were created to
counter West Bank mayors who openly support
the Palestine Liberation Organization.
University officials said five men armed with
Israeli submachine guns forced their way onto
the campus and severely beat a watchman with
the butts of their weapons. The injured watch
man, Farrah Assou, was admitted to the French
Hospital in Bethlehem.
