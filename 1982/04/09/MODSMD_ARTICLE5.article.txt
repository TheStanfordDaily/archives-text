Thatcher demands Falkland withdrawal
London â€” Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher declared yesterday that
Argentine withdrawal from the Falkland Islands was an "absolute re
quirement" before there can be any negotiation or solution to the
crisis.
Her tough line, backed up by a British blockade of the disputed is
lands that goes into effect Monday, is the only authorized message that
Secretary of State Alexander Haig will carry from London to Buenos
Aires today.
Haig arrived here yesterday afternoon to offer American services to
resolve the crisis that began with Argentine occupation of the British
colony a week ago today. The islands lie 400 miles east of the Argentine
coast, and at least two nuclear-powered British attack submarines will
be on station there by Sunday, British sources said.
Haig went straight to the Foreign Office for a meeting with Foreign
Secretary Francis Pym. An hour later he crossed Downing Street and
met Thatcher for an hour-and-a-half. Haig then hurried to a three-hour
working dinner with six American and six British diplomats.
Meanwhile, underscoring the British policy of brinksmanship, De
fense Minister John Nott, who attended the Downing Street dinner yes
terday, told an American television interviewer unequivocably that
"We will shoot first."
