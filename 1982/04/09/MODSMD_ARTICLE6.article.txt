# Deukmejian and Curb vie In top state GOP race
## 
### Peggy Hernandez 
California's gubernatorial race can
be best defined with one question:
who is going to meet Los Angeles
Mayor Tom Bradley in the November
final, Lt. Governor Mike Curb or At
torney General George Deukmejian?

News Analysis

There's little doubt that Bradley
will win the Democratic nomination
on June 8. There is still speculation as
to who will win the Republican bid,
Curb or Deukmejian. Nonetheless,
the other two Democratic conten
ders — State Senate Majority Leader
John Garamendi (D-Walnut Grove)
and former State Secretary of Health
and Welfare Mario Obledo — are in
teresting factors in the race to suc
ceed Edmund "Jerry" Brown as Cali
fornia's next governor.
Bradley, who has run a low-key

campaign, holds a whopping 66 per
cent in a recent Field Poll versus Gar
amendi's 11 percent and Obledo's
7 percent. His campaign motto is "He
doesn't make a lot of noise. He just
gets a lot done."
Bradley, 64, is a charismatic can
didate despite his quiet demeanor. A
former UCLA track star, Bradley
worked on the police force for 21
years, studied law at night, was a Los
Angeles city councilman and has
been elected mayor three times.
The Los Angeles mayor claims one
asset is his arbitration abilities, such
as when he stepped into a recent
rent-control dispute between Los
Angeles renters and landlords. Brad
ley facilitated the tentative agree
ment. He .supports gun control and
Proposition 9, a measure which in
cludes the Peripheral Canal project.
The Peripheral Canal is the most
debated topic among gubernatorial

candidates. If Prop. 9 passes, a 43-
mile canal would be built along the
eastern edge of the Sacramento-San
Joaquin Delta to deliver water to
Southern California.
Garamendi, a staunch conserva
tionist, opposes the canal because he

said the $11.3 million project costs
too much and lacks enough environ
mental guarantees. He said the
project would increase the salt water
flow into California's northern delta

region and make the land less fertile.
It's unlikely the 36-year-old Gar
amendi will win the election. But
Garamendi is gaining needed name
recognition for future political en
deavours.
Obledo's showing, despite a late
entrance into the gubernatorial race,
is considered by many analysts to be
indicative of California Hispanics'
growing, albeit slowly developing,
voter bloc. Hispanics currently con
stitute approximately 4.5 million of
the state's almost 23 million resi
dents. However, a recent Field Poll
indicates the states' Hispanics favor
Bradley over the 49-year-old Ob
ledo.
The canal issue clearly separates
the Republican gubernatorial con
tenders. Curb, who formerly sup
ported the measure, now opposes it
