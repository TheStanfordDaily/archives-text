\ Who are the best professors? What
" Western Culture sequence is best for me?
' Where is the closest McDonalds? What
does it take to be a pre-med?
Where can a freshman get answers to
this trivia and other general Stanford in
' formation? One may ask any up
' perclassman, but there are special people
at the University who can be an invaluable
v " source of information to many freshman.
t These people are advising associates (AAs).
' AAs are upperclassmen who are special
ly selected and trained to advise freshmen.
Integrated into the undergraduate advis
ing program, AAs work together with a
*' regular academic adviser and help guide
freshmen through their first year here.
"Many faculty advisers aren't familiar
with the University and the way it runs,"
said advising associate Randy Marks. "The
~ ' AA is more in tune with the college en
vironment and the mechanics of the Uni
versity. On the other hand, the faculty ad
viser knows his field and profession. He
; can offer freshmen his experience and
*'• knowledge."
The advising associate program was de
, signed to complement the existing struc
ture of the regular advising program. In a
' 1978 senior survey, the most frequent rec
ommendation students gave was to in
stitute some form of peer advising. Three
students began to discuss possible ways to
improve the freshman advising system and
came up with the advising associates con
cept.
Starting on an experimental basis in
; Trancos, the advising associate program
has since grown and is currently serving
Branner, Donner, Madera, Otero, Rin
conada and Trancos. Further expansion to
include Larkin and Gavilon is planned for
next year.
Dan Lessler, a medical student here and
one of the founders of the advising as
sociates program said, "Regular academic
advisers are often put under many de
mands by freshmen. An AA can help re
lieve some of these demands."
Lessler emphasized the AAs are not to
■ u be a substitute for the regular academic
9 r adviser, but are to "act as a catalyst" in the
„ relationship between the adviser and the
freshmen.
", 1 Janet Robertson, co-coordinator for
1 next year's AA program said, "Ideally a
? J freshman's academic adviser should act as
a mentor. The adviser can serve as a role

model. Freshmen can look at him and ask,
'Do I want to become a doctor?' But when
it comes down to enrolling in a specific
chemistry class, he's not going to be as use
ful, whereas I have been through the hu
man biology program, and I know what
most chemistry classes are like. Our advice
complements one another."
Bill Halter, who will coordinate next
year's AA program with Robertson said,
"Often times there may be a communica
tion gap between an older adviser and his
advisee. AAs as students can help bridge
this gap. Also, advisers don't always have
access to a lot of information that an AA
may have. Students usually have informa
tion readily on hand."
In addition to bridging the communica
tion gap and providing general informa
tion, an AA's more important yet more dif
ficult role may be to help freshman come
to a decision of what they want to get out
of their college education.
Different views on education are pro
vided in a training course that all AAs are
required to take during the spring. The
class, LAC 177, meets once a week and in
troduces the AAs to various peer counsel
ing skills.
One of the goals of the class is to make
AAs think about themselves and under
stand their views and biases regarding
education.
"We try to get the AAs to challenge and
clarify their values on education," said
Robertson. Guest speakers from the facul
ty give lectures on topics such as the value
of a liberal arts education, the value of a
scientific education and of course, the val
ue of a Stanford education.
Those wishing to become an advising as
sociate fill out applications during winter
quarter. Then interviews are conducted.
About 160 upperclassmen applied to the
program this year. There are 97 AAs cur
rently serving the freshman class.
AAs are required to meet weekly with
their freshmen. Usually an AA will have a
meal in the dorm, but meetings can take
place over pizza or ice cream.
One important job of all AAs is to en
courage freshmen to take advantage of
their faculty adviser. AAs can often lessen
the intimidation of the advisers. "It's very
frustrating for me to see freshmen not
make use of their adviser who can be a fan
tastic resource of information," Robert
son. "All advisers are willing to help and
deal with their students. Freshmen should

realize this and take advantage of it."
James Isaacs, this year's AA co-coordi
nator, said that freshmen who live in an all
freshman dorm can get isolated, and the
resident assistant (RA) can often get over
burdened. However, an AA's role
shouldn't be confused with an RA's role.
"When a freshman has an emotional or
social problem AAs should try to en
courage him or her to seek the RA's help
because RAs are specifically trained in this
area," said Halter. "But the AA program
does work closfely with the residential staff
in all the dorms."
"AAs help freshmen by giving academic
advice coming from a senior student's per
spective," Isaac said. "I also see myself as a
sounding board in which freshmen can
bounce off their ideas."
Freshman Kathy Ko sees the AA program
as "instrumental" to the general advising
program.
"I am so glad I have an AA because I can
see Stanford from an upperclassman's
point of view. My adviser hasn't been a stu
dent at Stanford for many years, so my AA
provides up-to-date practical knowledge
about the University," Ko said. "I use my
adviser for more long-range goals, and my
AA helps me with my classes since he's just
gone through it. I get the best of both!"
Supporters say the advising associate
program provides tremendous support to
faculty advisers as well as students.
Freshmen are given both peer per
spectives and senior perspectives on
education. It is this balance of perspectives
that many involved say makes the advising
system so successful.
However, not all freshmen have AAs.
The AA program is expanding slowly in or
der to keep the quality of advising high. By
1984, it is hoped that all freshman dorms
will have advising associates.
Janet Vogelzang, co-coordinator with
Isaacs, graduated from here last spring. As
a senior, Vogelzang was an AA and pres
ently she is a regular academic adviser.
"Since I've been an AA, and now I'm an
adviser I can really see the benefits of the
AA program from both sides. When I was
an AA, the freshmen could relate to me as
a student but now i have a little bit more of
a distance from them. I can understand the
shyness that many advisers have in walking
into an all-freshman dorm/' she said.
