GRADING POLICY IN
UNDERGRADUATE
MATHEMATICS COURSES
In those undergraduate Mathematics
courses where +/NC grading is offered,
the deadline is before the end of the
third week of the quarter—specifically,
no later than 4 p.m., Friday, April 16,
1982. And the request for +/NC grading
must be made formally, in writing, on a
petition form provided by the instructor.
For more detailed information, consult
with your Mathematics instructor and read
the memorandum on /NC grading that is
posted on bulletin boards in the
Department of Mathematics (Building 380).
