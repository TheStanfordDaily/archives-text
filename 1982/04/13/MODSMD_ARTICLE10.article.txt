# Do you know... why golf balls have dimples?
## 
### 
"How many dimples are on a golf ball?"
was asked in the recent KZSU/American
Studies trivia contest. Even if you knew the
answer they were looking fpr (336), do you
know why those dimples are there?
In the 1900s, a professor at St. Andrews Uni
versity molded a golf ball from gutta-percha,
a rubbery substance tapped from trees,
which hardens on contact with air. The gutta
percha ball was an aerodynamic failure at
first, but its inventor persisted and found that
his creation really sailed after it had been
nicked up a bit by his club. Soon he was mass
producing his ball, the nicks formed by
molds.
Although today's golf balls are no longer
made from gutta-percha, they still have
dimples, the modern day replacement of
nicks, distributed around the ball in a regular
pattern.
On a drive, as many as 8000 revolutions per

minute (RPMs) of backspin are imparted to
the ball. The dimpled surface traps a layer of
air which spins with the ball. The ball is trav
elling forward, but with backspin, so the wind
and surface air layer oppose one another
below the ba|l an<i complement each other
above, The result is that the air on top flows
faster than the air on bottom.
A basic principle of physics states that pres
sure is inversely proportional to speed. Thus,
the greater total air speed above a golf ball
creates less" pressure above the ball than
below; this extra pressure below creates a lift.
The primary function ot dimples is to trap the
surface air layer; the spin does the rest.
