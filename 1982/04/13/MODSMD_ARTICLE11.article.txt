## Campus activist lives out feminist Ideals working against stereotypes and sexism 
### Steve Trousdale 
Sharon Silverstein, possibly one of the
most controversial and certainly one of the
most outspoken members of the Women's
Center here, is a person almost impossible to
characterize.
One of the leading figures in the feminist
movement here, she supplies great input
into the Center, but refers to herself merely
as a "staffer" in a group of women organized
on a collective basis.
Silverstein also defies description as a cam
pus radical. Upon meeting her, one is faced
with a softspoken young woman whose
views and anger at the society in which, she
believes, men dominate women belie her
appearance. Yet she has not taken to the
streets in this anger; instead, she works
through more peaceful means such as rallies,
forums and panel discussions.
Finally, one is faced with her lesbianism
and active particpation in the gay communi
ty at Stanford. She refuses to hide this fact "in
the closet." Instead, she proudly defines
herself as a lesbian in an overwhelmingly
heterosexual society.
Sharon Silverstein — feminist, activist, les
bian — these are words to describe this
member of the Stanford community, but

words do not give a personal sense of her. To
gain the proper perspective, one must talk to
her friends, her colleagues, and ultimately to
Silverstein herself.
Sharon Dyer, a freshman who has worked
with Silverstein at the Women's Center here,
described her as a "resource person," be
cause Dyer said, Silverstein knows more
about the University than she does. "I know
if I have any questions about any facet of the
University I know I can go to her," said Dyer.
In fact, Dyer said that she had consulted
with Silverstein on several projects, among
them the "Feminism in the Residences Pizza
Party" and a recent panel discussion on
pornography.
Dyer described Silverstein as a person "ex
tremely involved (in feminist activities) as
well as her schoolwork." She's "someone
who's not afraid to stand up for what she be
lieves in," said Dyer.
Silverstein, a senior in feminist studies, is
"living out the ideals of feminist theory," she
said.
Catherine MacKinnon, an unofficial ad
viser for Silverstein's major and an acting
guest professor here, commented that "she
(Silverstein) has been very active in most of
the major feminist activities (on campus),"
including bringing MacKinnon herself here
as a visiting professor.
According to MacKinnon, one of Silver
stein's strengths in the work she does is her
ability to organize. MacKinnon also said that
Silverstein is helped in the work she does be
cause of her ability to identify points on
which she feels she is not as effective as other
people.
In describing Silverstein as a person,
MacKinnon said, "I think that she's extreme
ly active and very conscientious and very
committed."
Asst. History Prof. Estelle Freedman, Sil
verstein's primary major adviser, described
her as "a highly politicized person who asks
some very hard questions about feminism"
and who is "willing to put energy into re
search that will enable her to answer them."
She presently does research for a feminist
lawyer, for which she receives academic
credit, and she said she hopes to become a
feminist lawyer herself. In an interview she
went on to describe some of her views,
hopes, and thoughts on feminism and re
lated topics.
Dally: When did your active feminism be
ginf
Silverstein: For as long as I can remember
I've resisted the social imposition of how I
ought to be, according to the prevailing cul
ture's prescriptions for little girls and for
women. I'd say that my critical or scholarly
interest in feminism began as soon as I could
read. Unfortunately there wasn't a whole lot

written for 11-year-old girls who have a
critical perspective on society. I found, when
I got to college, that there were some books
and things I could read. Particularly my
sophomore year, I began to read virtually ev
ery feminist work I could find and to talk
with, associate and work with other women
who called themselves feminists. There
weren't a whole lot of liberals in my high
school, and I was real glad to find lots of
women who would identify as feminists
here.
D: What do you define as a feminist?
5: Well, I think that feminism as a theory is
about the point of view of women on social
life, and that a feminist is a female person
who struggles to end the oppression of
women in society.
D: Have you done any activist feminism or
ganizing on campusf
S: In the four years that I've been here I've
worked as a staffer at the Women's Center,
as a collective member of Aurora, which is
Stanford's feminist newspaper; I've been a
member of the Women's Collective, which is
an organization for lesbian, bisexual and all
other interested women. I'm a member of
the Feminist Studies Program Committee.
And, I've participated in planning for and
producing a number of events: speeches,
films, forums, discussions, workshops and so
on, through a number of campus groups.
I've also done a fair amount of talking with
people in my classes, on the various commit
tees that I've served on, my friends. I think all
ofthosethings fall in the category of organiz
ing.
D: How do you feel that your major in
feminist studies ties in to your belief in
feminismf
5: One of the most important things about
being able to major in feminist studies for me
has been the opportunity I've had to design
my own program, to study the things that
I've felt it was important to study. The subti
tle of my major is Feminist Studies: Critiques
of State Society, and so I've been able to take
courses in law, anthropology, political sci
ence and other related fields. I've been able
to take, for example, a number of SWOPSI
courses and I've been able to read and talk
about and write about the ideas and the
events of day to day happenings that I think
are important — things that will help me de
velop a critical understanding of the world I
exist in, and to, I think, begin to get a sense of
where I have been and can be most effective
in changing the social systems that oppress
women, people of color, gays and the work
ers of the world.
D: What do you do in the Women's Center
and what role do you play in it, or think you
play in It?

5: The Women's Center is operated by a vol
unteer staff on a consensual basis, which
means that anyone is welcome to participate
in the planning of events sponsored and co
sponsored by the Women's Center, and ev
eryone is welcome to attend those events.
I've been a staffer for about a year, and I've
been able to originate and implement a
number of programs, both sponsored solely
by the Women's Center and co-sponsored
by the Women's Center and a very wide
range of other campus organizations.
D: What is your opinion of Asst. History Prof.
Estelle Freedman's recent denial of tenure,
as regards University policy towards women
faculty and their tenuref
5: Well, I think the dean's denial of Estelle's
tenure speaks most particularly to the way
they value, or, say in this case, do not value
the kind of work Estelle does, which is wom
en's history, which is a feminist approach to
the social situation of women. I think that by
denying her tenure — this is a woman who is
among the top women's historians in the
country — to deny her tenure, I think, speaks
to the way that they do not value the work
she does, the way that they do not think it is
important for that perspective to be taught
here, when clearly Estelle Is a top-rate schol
ar, a first-rate teacher, but yet the deans
don't see the value of what she's doing here,
which is just immense. She's been in
strumental in the creation and maintenance

and expansion of the feminist studies pro
gram, in addition to the work that she does in
the history department. She's been an ad
viser to most of the majors in feminist stud
ies; she's worked on The Signs, which is the
nation's leading feminist academic journal
— she's an associate editor of Signs — and
she's been an active and visible presence in
the academic women's community, all of
this in addition to being an exceptional
teacher of history and carrying the responsi
bilities in that department to the great satis
faction of the vast majority of her students
and advisees. Not to mention, of course, the
reknown she does have in the field of wom
en's history. It's very upsetting, I think, if the
University won't keep her on; I certainly
hope they realize they've made a mistake.
D: What do you believe the University thinks
about itf
S: It's hard to say, you know, but Estelle is the
only professor on this faculty who was
brought here specifically ... because of the
work that she does in women's history — all
the other feminist faculty here became
feminists after they were here. I don't know
what the heck the University thinks — I wish
I did.
O: Do you find are more discriminated
against because of your lesbianism?
S: Than what?
