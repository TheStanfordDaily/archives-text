# Council of Presidents:
## 
### 
In a difficult decision between two
enthusiastic and capable slates, the hands-on
ASSU experience and strong articulation of all
four candidates make the BET'M slate of Rod
Beckstrom, Mark Epstein, Yolanda Townsend,
and Cynthia Mathewson our choice for the
Council of Presidents. Extensive involvement in
the ASSU combined with poise and clear
enunciation of creative new ideas make the four
candidates well-suited student representatives.
The slate's experience could be effectively
applied in its commitment to restructuring
University Food Service, as recommended by
the ASSU Food Service Task Force this year
which Beckstrom chaired.

BET'M proposes to improve outreach to the
various student communities on campus by
forming a Cultural Programming Board through
which cultural groups could take advantage of
resources provided by the ASSU. To improve
the channels of graduate student-ASSU
communication, the slate advocates
establishing a Graduate Cabinet to provide
graduate students a forum for presenting and
clarifying their concerns.
We believe the BET'M slate has proven its
ability this year to work effectively. Experience,
combined with a clear articulation of ideas and
concerns, make Beckstrom, Epstein, Townsend
and Mathewson qualified student leaders and
we support them as candidates for the Council
of Presidents.
