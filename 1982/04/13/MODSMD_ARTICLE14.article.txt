# ASSU Senators:
## Undergraduate seats 
### 
X Melissa Auchard
Melissa Auchard combines extensive
knowledge of ASSU government — of its limits
and potential — with ideas for new services and
for implementing broader programs. As an
administrative assistant to the COP, Auchard has
had experience in some of the most complex
areas of the ASSU labyrinth, and she has pledged
to use her experience to continue current ASSU
projects. Auchard also places emphasis upon
ASSU Senate involvement in campus safety and *
minority issues.
X Paul Barber
Paul Barber's understanding of the strengths
and weaknesses of this year's senate and his
well-expressed, fresh ideas strike an effective
balance that should enhance the continuity of
the ASSU Senate. Barber is well-versed on issues
tfeat dea\ with the internal administration of the
aSS\J such as fee assessment reform and COP
structural reform. Yet, he also presents new
ideas and new directions in areas such as energy
conservation, tuition forums and student
accessibility to campus speakers.
X Roc Blumenthal
Simply stated,, Roc Blumenthal is a superlative
candidate achievements during his year
in office have been outstanding. As deputy
senate chair, Blumenthal coauthored bills such
as the senate's fee assessment reform plan and
worked on the successful by-law review. He is
responsible for the creation of the intern
program, which has brought many students into
the ASSU. Blumenthal works equally effectively
with students, staff and University
administrators and his invaluable senate
experience would greatly ease the transition
between the current senators and next year's
slate.
IX Jackie Johnson
Sincere, mature, diligent — these are
adjectives that aptly describe Jackie Johnson.
Her leadership experience ranges from vice
president of the Black Pre-Law society to
coordinator of the Black Faculty Tribute. Even
more impressive is Johnson's well-thought out
presentation of ideas. One of Johnson's pet
projects would be to improve campus safety
through better lighting and foot patrols. You
can also expect Johnson to make the districting
system work the way it was intended: meeting
with constituents on a regular basis.
X David Porter
David Porter received the unanimous support
of the Editorial Board for combining experience
and outstanding speaking ability with a strong
platform and demonstrated dedication. He has
worked extensively in ASSU affairs as
administrative assistant to the COP and as a
commitee and task force member. A voice for
minority issues, he is concerned with energy
conservation, campus safety, financial aid and
campus entertainment.

X Mike Reeds
Mike Reeds' extensive experience with the
Ombudsman's office gives him valuable insights
into the processes of problem solving within the
University. We feel his dedicated concern for
student rights is typical of the initiative and
direction Reeds would bring to the ASSU
Senate. Aside from student rights, Reeds has
shown a clear understanding of the issues facing
the ASSU and an ability to channel that
knowledge into effective action in resolving
these issues.
X Peter Rucker
Peter Rucker displays a particularly sound
background in the workings and interaction of
the committee system, both within the ASSU
Senate and within the University. He realizes
that one of the most important functions of the
senate is to communicate with students — both
about senate actions and about additional
information that the senate can circulate widely.
He also promises to achieve a more
representative make-up within the ASSU /
reflecting commitment to Third World and
women's issues.
X Peter Spivack
Peter Spivack presents ideas of how the ASSU
senate can best serve the student body. His
concern for student needs prompts his proposal
to give students first priority at student
sponsored events. Spivack's platform also
contains a plan to make students more aware of
the causes for tuition and room and board
increases, and he hopes to extend PG&E's
energy conservation program to Stanford.
Finally, Spivack supports joining forces with an
outside concert promoter to bring concerts to
Stanford.
X Al Taira
Overflowing enthusiasm and solid experience
are qualities which would make Al Taira a
welcome addition to next year's ASSU Senate.
Taira has served as an intern for the Academic
Affairs Committee which has given him
important ASSU experience while at the same
time allowing him to see parts of the system that
could be improved by the senate. Taira has a
thorough knowledge of the issues facing the
ASSU and is particularly committed to working
closely on graduate issues.
X Jerry Wertheim
Jerry Wertheim enhances his senate
candidacy with thoughtful ideas about the
issues which next year's senate will confront. He
presents his ideas eloquently, perhaps because
he is an excellent debater. An active member of
the ASSU Task Force on tuition, Wertheim has
worked to curb tuition increases by controlling
energy costs. In order to minimize expenses, he
advocates that residences should get control
over their own thermostats. His interest in
broader issues balances the ASSU experience of
other candidates.
