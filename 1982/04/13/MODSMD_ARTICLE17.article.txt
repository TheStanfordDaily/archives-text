# Fee Assessments: choice 'A '
## 
### 
For months, the ASSU Senate vacillated on the
issue of fee assessment reform. Nearly every
senator agreed that a change needed to be
made, yet the senate could not decide exactly
what to do about it. Finally, early this month, the
senate decided to leave the matter up to the
voters in the form of the referendum that will
appear on the ballot tomorrow and Thursday.
The senate has pledged to place a constitutional
amendment on the April 28 and 29 ballot that
reflects the wishes of the majority, whether that
majority supports Option A, which would allow
students who vote to claim refunds, or Option B,
which would create non-refundable fee
assessment systems.
Throughout the controversy, the Daily's

preference has remained clear: we support the
system now known as Option A. This system, by
allowing refunds only to those who vote, would
provide an incentive to vote that would likely
increase voter turnout and thus allow more
student opinions to be voiced during elections.
Such a system would be a vast improvement
over the present system in which some students
voice their opinions only when they queue up at
the ASSU offices and indiscriminately claim
refunds. And yet it would allow the most
important feature of the fee assessment system
— the refundability of fees — to remain so that a
student would never be forced by the majority
to pay for a grouplhat he or she opposes on an
ideological, moral, religious or other basis.
