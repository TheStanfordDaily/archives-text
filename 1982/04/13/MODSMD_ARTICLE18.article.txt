# The 						Amendments: 'Yes'
## 
### 
Streamlining the by-laws and constitution is
one of the achievements of the ASSU Senate this
year. We believe the three proposed
constitutional amendments would continue this
process of increasing the organization's
efficiency and we support passage of all three
amendments. One amendment is relatively
minor: to satisfy IRS requirements, it provides
for any necessary dissolution of the ASSU. The
others would remedy some of the
organization's structural problems. One would

allow the Nominations Committee to appoint
students more efficiently and through a more
autonomous process. The other would make
the terms of outgoing and incoming senators
and COP members overlap â€” thus providing
better preparation for representatives and
greater organizational continuity. All three
measures deserve your support; this is your
chance to allow the ASSU to respond to your
needs more effectively.
