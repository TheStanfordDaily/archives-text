# Program Fee: 'Yes'
## 
### 
The Program Fee, administered by the ASSU
Senate, funds more than 20 small student
organizations here. These groups, which range
from MECHA to the Arab Student Association to
Stanford Against Conscription, provide valuable
services to the University and likely could not
exist without program fee funding.
We ask that the senate begin to keep closer
tabs on how program fee money is spent in
order to increase the accountability of the

various groups to the Senate. We also believe
that the senate should encourage more groups
to apply for program fee funding; by its own
admission, only 25-30 of the more than 200
eligible groups apply. Nevertheless, we feel that
the co-existence of diverse social, cultural and
political groups is as much a part of a Stanford
education as the diversity in course offerings,
and we encourage a "yes" vote for the Program
Fee.
