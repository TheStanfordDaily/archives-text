# McCloskey worried about growing deficit, favors more budget cuts

### Peggy Hernandez 
U.S. Rep. Paul "Pete" McCloskey's
appearance Saturday at Terman
Auditorium was marred by his late ar
rival and the brevity of his meeting
with his 12th Congressional District
constituents.
McCloskey was forced to curtail
his appearance because of a sched
uled airplane flight to Southern Cali
fornia, where he was to appear at a
fundraiser for his Senate campaign
bid.
The Stanford stop was oTie oT many
oh the Menlo Park congressman's
itinerary for Friday and Saturday. Mc-

Closkey had mailed out fliers inviting
his constituents to meet with him at
various locales from Redwood City to
Mountain View. Although the fliers
stressed the meeting would be open
to questions, ihey specifically ad
dressed McCloskey's stances on the
federal budget proposals and U.S.
policy toward El Salvador.
McCloskey showed up at Terman
40 minutes late and, apologizing, said
his tardiness was due a stopped clock
at his previous meeting. Dressed cas
ually in corduroy pants and a green
wool sweater, McCloskey then
opened the meeting by asking for
questions.
President Ronald Reagan's pro

posed budget cuts appeared to be of
primary concern to the audience,
which numbered about 100 people.
Reagan's proposed budget, if ap
proved, would leave the United
States with a $120 to $150 billion defi
cit.
McCloskey says he would prefer to
pare that figure down by cutting the
proposed defense budget by $10
billion, cutting social services by $17
billion and raising tax rates by $27
billion.
Using the Terman chalkboards to
illustrate his points, McCloskey drew
a graph which charted U.S. economic
growth from 1945 to the present. The
graph depicted an upward growth
period which leveled off in 1973. He
attributed the stagnant leveling-off
to excessive government spending
on various programs. The lack of up
ward economic growth, he said, is
worrisome.
"I know of no peril greater than
the growing deficit," McCloskey
said. He said he hopes Congress will
adopt some of his proposals before
the budget goes to a vote on May 15.
One audience member, however,
questioned McCloskey's proposed
cuts, calling them nothing but "a
band-aid approach to the problem."
But when asked for a show of hands,
the audience, which was composed
primarly of area residents and a few
Stanford students, preferred that the
government immediately try to
achieve a balanced budget over in
creasing funds in any other areas.
The audience also supported cuts
to graduate student loan programs.
There was no opposition from the
audience or McCloskey on this issue.
McCloskey also briefly addressed
his National Youth Service proposal,
first introduced at the University,
which calls for mandatory military or
social service participation for all 18-
year-olds. He criticized the makeup

of the current volunteer army as in
adequate and unfair. "Those in the
army should be more than those too
poor or ignorant to serve," he said.
McCloskey, one of seven can
didates seeking the Republican nom
ination for the U.S. Senate, con
tinued to answer questions while
packing papers into a traveling bag.
The final questioner said he believed
foreign trade should be increased
and regulations should be imposed
United States allows
Japanese-made cars into the country.
"And what are we going to do,"
McCloskey said as he started to leave,
"say to the Japanese that we'll trade
100 Hondas for 100 Buicks?"
