# Senior Class Presidents:'?'
## 
### 
Each of the senior class slates submitted a copy
of their campaign platforms and appeared for an
interview: the Bollard slate (Joe Del Hierro,
Katie Dore, Kevin O'Beirne and Mary
Ruckelshaus); Four Play (Janet Buchan, Kate
Bunce, Doug Nomiyama and Frank Ronchetti);

and the Good Ship '83 (Ann Bondelie, Roxy
Gumlia, Spence Kendrick and Steve Schmidt).
However, after extensive discussion, the
editorial board was unable to arrive at a decision
endorsing any one slate. Therefore, the Daily
has no recommendation in this race.
