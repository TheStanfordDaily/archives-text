## Adaptation of Old Testament book It's a 'provocative, sometimes frustrating, fun-house ride' 
### David Schmelzer 
In 605 B.C. the mighty Chal
deans, who already had more
than enough land for their
needs, were attacking and con
quering most of the Middle
East. The prophet Habakkuk
saw that they would soon be in
Jerusalem, where they would
wipe out God's chosen ones.
(Twenty years after he wrote
his book he was proven cor
rect.) So he asked the question
which has remained with men
since then: "If you're a good
old God, how can you let evil
triumph?"
Habakkuk, a multi-media
show that has been touring the
Bay Area, stopping first at San
Francisco's Palace of Fine Arts,
then at U.C. Berkeley, and
finally here at Cubberly (where
it begins a three-day run on
Thursday), deals with this sub
ject. Before reaching California
it was entered in the 1980 In
ternational Multi-Image Festi
val in Vail, Colorado, where it
won a gold medal and, so its
press release tells us, received
the only standing ovation
among 110 entries. It failed to
get this response from the 1700
who saw it last Tuesday at the
Palace of Fine Arts, but they

clapped lously enough none
theless.
Habakkuk's stylistic power
comes from the sensory output
it throws at the viewer. One

doesn't encounter concert
volume music, flashing lights,
and a 50-foot screen showing
3000 cascading images (coming
from 25 slide projectors and
four film projectors, all com
puter-controlled) at many
shows, which, I imagine, is why
its makers picked this medium.
Where a movie focuses one's
attention, here they can throw
out as many ideas as they have
slides. This is often confusing.
At one point one stereo speak
er plays Richard Nixon explain
ing his refusal to resign, anoth
er plays Tip O'Neil starting im
peachment proceedings, and
all of this is backed by a blasting
symphonic fanfare, and ac
companied by about 40 con
stantly changing pictures.
It's too much to be able to as
similate, but that seems to be
the point. They want one to
leave with his head spinning a
bit and with a number of ideas
demanding continued
thought. At any rate, this tech
nique makes the show sort of
like an amusement park ride.
It's always arresting and often
surreal.
The progression the makers
follow is to match verses from
the Biblical book with contem
porary scenes and issues. By
doing this, they raise several
unstated questions:
Q: Is our a big-fish-eats-lit
tle-fish world where self-help
is the only solution? A: At vari
ous times during the show one
sees body-builders and covers
of books like Winning Through
Intimidation and hears F.D.R.
saying that the United States
must place its faith in its own
military might.
Q: What about powerful
countries who only develop
might in order to protect them
selves, not to be aggressive? A:
One sees a cartoon story about
Billy Goat Gruff fighting a
Mean Ol' Troll to get to his
pasture, and one later hears
statistics, such as that America,
with 6 percent of the world's
population, consumes 40 per
cent of the world's food.
As such, these "answers"
turn out more to be illustra
tions of the relevance of
Habakkuk's concerns in to
day's world and to be implied
comments on the American
Way than to be direct con
clusions. This lack of a concrete
position, along with the con-
WVitiUR
fusion brought in by the multi
media approach, can get frus
trating, but again, that seems to
be an intentional effect.
Habakkuk has an original,
continuous soundtrack (which
is pumped through four terrific
Bose speskers). The songs are
pop numbers dealing, often in
directly, with the issues raised.
Not surprisingly, the most strik
ing number dealt with the
worth, or lack there of, of a col
lege degree. Also included are
a Grease-style song about con
temporary idols and a song
dealing with God's apparent
cruelty.
The numbers are tight and
professionaly done, if not ex
actly state of the art. Some oc
casionally trite lyrics are pos
sible to overlook; everything
sounds imposing and im
pressive coming from this par
ticular sound system.
Because of the "throw it all at
'em" nature of the show, theo
logical moralizing is minimal,
confined mainly to infrequent
commentaries on the text
(which is presented on the
screen in its entirety at one
time or another).
Habakkuk's creators seem
more interested in raising is
sues than in giving answers.
Jewish believers might legit
imately have a complaint in
that Christ is brought up in this
adaptation of what is an Old
Testament book, and, perhaps,
in that Habakkuk's account of
God's intervention in the Ex
odus is dealt with rather hur
riedly. But Habakkuk's overall
effect isn't so much of a ser
mon, but rather of a pro- !
vocative, sometimes frustrat- '
ing, fun-house ride.
