# Clarinetist exhibits 'dynamics' in sound and personality
## 
### Karen Springen 
Shivers in Dinkelspiel
Auditorium last Friday night
were not the result of a cold
draft but of reknowned clari
netist Richard Stoltzman's skill,
energy and spirit. Playing to a
nearly full house, Stoltzman
maximized the clarinet's tre
mendous dynamic and
chromatic range. He drew
upon his virtually flawless tech
nique throughout the two
hour program. •
Stoltzman, along with friend
Bill Douglas on piano and
bassoon, enthusiastically pre
sented a smorgasbord of im
provisation, be-bop, scat-sing
ing, blues and classical music.
The unusual blend of classical,
romantic and contemporary

music made for a well-paced,
attention-holding concert.
Selections included three
pieces by Douglas, two by J.S.
Bach, and one by Oliver
Messiaen, Francis Poulenc,
Charles Parker and Debussey.
Two of the nine pieces fea
tured a slide show by photog
rapher John Pearson. The slides
were both provoking and ap
propriate, but, unfortunately,
they detracted from the music.
In the atonal Abime des
Oiseaux by Oliver Messiaen,
Stoltzman physically and musi
cally took a back seat to
Pearson — he moved his chair
and stand to the rear of the
auditorium. The auditorium
was completely dark, and eyes
naturally focused forward

toward the screen. And, al
though it is entirely acceptable
to use music during a concert,
it is nonetheless unusual to see
a professional performer use
sheet music as Stoltzman did
during this piece.
Stoltzman experimented
with the dynamic potential of
his instrument during Abime
des Oiseaux. He would inten
tionally go flat and overblow —
producing a far-from-pretty
and melodious, yet interesting
effect. Stoltzman also possesses
an unusual ability to proceed
rapidly from pianissisimo levels
to triple fortes. He has such a
mastery of the clarinet that he
can manipulate his tone suc
cessfully.
Sunsets and time-related

slides accompanied the first
half of the composition. The
second portion focused on the

bird theme, which Stoltzman
explained as our desire for life
and song or the opposite of
time. The faster, more joyful
music reflected this idea.
The blues medley made bet
ter use of the slide concept.
Stoltzman's clarinet was in con
stant dialogue with Douglas'
piano. The two exchanged
runs, interacting on an equal
level. As he had through the
rest of the concert, Stoltzman
resisted the temptation to up
stage his accompanist,
Douglas.
A captivating and diverse
melange of slides, including
wildlife scenes, street shots of
people sitting on city curbs and
on city porches, a smiling baby
by a piano, and naked children
at play, enhanced the energiz
ing blues themes. All con
tributed to the general vibrant,
action-inspiring tone of the
piece specifically and the pro
gram in general.

Despite what seems on the
surface to be a casual approach
to his music, Stoltzman is a seri
ous classical musician. He par
ticularly exhibited his finesse
during Sonata No. 2 in D Major
for Viola da Gamba and Key
board by Bach. The four-move
ment piece allowed Stoltzman
to display his extreme sensi
tivity and expressiveness, par
ticularly during the andante
portion. The two allegro move
ments were fun, fast, and
synchopated, permitting
Stoltzman to let loose.
Stoltzman rounded out his
diverse program on a light
hearted note, typical of the
concert's general joy of life
tone, with Douglas' Jazz Min
iatures. The four small pieces
included scat-singing by
Stoltzman and Douglas and a
jig which Douglas introduced
as containing "African and
Irish influence." Sure
enough ... a reggae-esque jigl
The crowd, which consisted
mostly of Palo Alto residents
and faculty members, seemed
receptive to the somewhat un
usual offerings. The woman to
my side was a classical cellist in
terested in music in general.
Unlike many concerts with
well-known classical soloists,
this one did not attract any stu
dents toting scores, eager to
follow along and catch the
soloist playing a flaw.
Stoltzman and Douglas were
open and accessible through
out the performance. Scrap
ping the traditional black tails
and tie, the two wore

sportcoats. (Admittedly,
Stoltzman's was velvet — per
haps symbollic of his velvet
tones?) Both swayed with the
music, even unconventionally
tapping their feet during
Charles Parker's Bebop
Medley. The two seemed to
particularly enjoy Bach's Two-
Part Inventions for Clarinet and
Bassoon.
Stoltzman and Douglas

Stoltzman, along
with friend Bill
Douglas on piano
and bassoon,
enthusiastically
presented a
smorgasbord of
improvisation,
be-bop, scat
singing, blues and
classical music•

walked on and off the stage to
gether for each number. Al
though Stoltzman headlined
the Lively Arts bill as the more
reknowned musician, he did
not place Douglas in the sub
ordinant role of "accom
panist."
Stoltzman's enthusiasm pre
vented the boredom and rest
lessness which often arises in
the best of "classical" pro
grams. All in all, the spirited
concert was thoroughly en
joyable.
