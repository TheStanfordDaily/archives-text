Argentina demands sovereignty in Falklands
Buenos Aires — As Secretary of State Alexander Haig met in London
with British officials yesterday, Argentina seemed to remain open to
several possible solutions to the confrontation, although none of them
appeared to be immediately acceptable to the British.
As an immediate solution, officials here indicated that Argentina
would agree to withdraw its troops from the islands if Britain simultane
ously recalled the naval fleet now headed for the south Atlantic.
Under this plan, officials envision .negotiations proceeding on ad
minstration of the islands while Argentina tacitly retains its position of
sovereignty.
Sources here have also said that Argentina would be willing to con
sider a mixed political administration for the islands, which it calls the
Malvinas, involving officials chosen by the territory's 1000 residents, and
possibly international authority. However, Argentine officials have re
sisted suggestions of any participation by Britain in the island's govern
ment, even under Argentine sovereignty, political sources close to the
military here have said.
Argentine officials are said by political sources here to have also told
Haig that Argentina could accept a Peruvian proposal for a peace
keeping force drawn from Litin American nations that would replace
the 6000 to 8000 Argentine troops now reported to be on the disputed
islands.
However, Argentine officials are believed to be insistent on main
taining Argentina's sovereignty over the islands in any negotiated solu
tion. The military government here cannot yield Argentine control over
the territory even temporarily without endangering its own survival, po
litical sources said.
The military command here has insisted that
Britain recognize Argentina's sovereignty over
the territory, and has maintained that it was
forced to occupy the islands after 15 years of ne
gotiations produced no result.
Rioters battle Israeli police
Jerusalem — Arab demonstrators clashed
with Israeli soldiers in the Arab quarter of Jeru
salem and throughout the occupied West Bank
and Gaza Strip yesterday in a violent Moslem
protest against Sunday's shooting spree that
killed two Arabs and desecrated Islam's Dome
of the Rock shrine.
The Israeli military command said 11 Arabs
were shot and wounded by troops. Palestinian
sources said at least 13 demonstrators were
wounded by gunshots.
An almost total general strike paralyzed pre
dominate Arab East Jerusalem, which includes
the walled Old City, and towns and villages on
the West Bank and Gaza Strip. Shops and
schools were closed and most Arab workers
stayed home from their jobs.
In East Jerusalem, police prohibited a group
of Moslem leaders from marching to the Tem
ple Mount where an American-born Israeli
went on a shooting rampage Sunday at the
golden domed shrine that ranks as the third
most important site in Islam.
The Temple Mount area was closed to tourists
for an indefinite period.
Police continued to question Alan Goodman,
30, an emigrant from New Jersey, who was ar
rested inside the Dome of the Rock and
charged with kilJing two Arabs and wounding
several others. Police said the gunman, dressed
in an Israeli army uniform, sprayed the shrine
with gunfire, shooting at random at any Arab
who carpe across his path.
Solidarity takes to the air
Warsaw, Poland — In the most dramatic dis
play yet of the underground organizational
strength of the suspended Solidarity free trade
movement, activists successfully transmitted an
"experimental" eight-minute radio broadcast
yesterday that was apparently received in

thousands of Polish homes.
The broadcast, which had been announced
in underground Solidarity leaflets several days
ago, began as promised at 9 p.m. local time yes
terday with a few notes of a well-known World
War II resistance song and the announcement:
"This is Radio Solidarity."
"We must fight for the release of those im
prisoned, for the restoration of human dignity,"
said one of two announcers whose voices were
heard during the brief broadcast. "Our radio
has taken up this struggle. All honest Poles
should do the same."
The signal was clear in central Warsaw, and it
came over a frequency available on any stan
dard Polish FM receiver.
An announcer promised a second trans
mission on April 30 and said that at that time
"Radio Solidarity" would announce a regular
programming schedule.
The fact of the broadcast was seen here as
more significant than its content, since the au
thorities have appeared intent on crushing the
free trade union completely. Most of its top
leaders are interned and thousands of other ac
tivists and sympathizers are also in prison or in
ternment camps.
New MX strategy studied
Washington — The Pentagon is studying still
another way to base its homeless MX missile,
one that relies in part on a far-out nuclear-war
game concept known as fratricide.
The Air Force has labeled this latest deploy
ment idea the "MX Deceptive Dense Pack (D2P)
Basing Concept." A Pentagon executive said
yesterday that Dense Pack picked up steam af
ter the Senate Armed Services Committee re
cently refused to let the Air Force put the first
MX missiles in existing Minuteman silos until
some permanent basing plan is found.
Dense Pack, as the name implies, involves
bunching MX missiles in fairly tight formations.
That is quite different from earlier basing plans,
in which it was argued that, to make them less
vulnerable, the missiles ought to be spread far
apart.
In fact, Dense Pack backers figure, it may be
better to keep the MX silos fairly close together.
The reasoning goes this way: the first Soviet

warhead to come down on a pack will not only
destroy its target, but in a kind of sympathetic
detonation, will blow up the warheads flying
right behind it on the way to other U.S. missiles
in the cluster. These other U.S. missiles may
then survive.
Soviets start major offensive
Washington — The Soviet Union has signaled
the start of a major spring offensive in Afghan
istan with attacks this week against Afghan rebel
concentrations in the southwest corner of the
country, U.S. diplomatic and intelligence
sources here report.
Analysts said the unusually large Soviet
sweeps in the province of Farah — on Afghan
istan's western border with Iran — were aimed
at cleaning out hidden pockets of rebels who
range across the flat desert land there.
More strong sweeps are expected during the
next two months with the Soviets using MiC
fighters to strafe, bomb and fire rockets at sus
pected rebel concentrations before moving in
troops by helicopter, intelligence sources said.
According to reports filtering back from Af
ghanistan, the Soviets began using tactical air
power in a few winter assaults and found it gave
them a tremendous advantage against the re
bels, who often were caught without any cover
in the bleak Afghan countryside. It also took a
greater toll on civilians, the reports said.
Stocks drift lower
Stock prices drifted lower yesterday, stalling a
spring rally, amid fresh signs of economic
weakness at home and concern over unrest
abroad.
The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials,
which rose 6.09 points Thursday and had
climbed 47.09 points since March 17, slipped
1.62 points yesterday to close at 841.32. Stock
exchanges were closed Friday.
Today's weather
Variable clouds with a chance of showers.
Partlv cloudy tonight and tomorrow. Lows in
the mid-40s to low-50s, highs upper 50s and 60s.
Southwest winds 10 to 20 miles per hour.
Chance of rain 30 percent today.

play yet of the underground organizational
strength of the suspended Solidarity free trade
movement, activists successfully transmitted an
"experimental" eight-minute radio broadcast
yesterday that was apparently received in

thousands of Polish homes.
The broadcast, which had been announced
in underground Solidarity leaflets several days
ago, began as promised at 9 p.m. local time yes
terday with a few notes of a well-known World
War II resistance song and the announcement:
"This is Radio Solidarity."
"We must fight for the release of those im
prisoned, for the restoration of human dignity,"
said one of two announcers whose voices were
heard during the brief broadcast. "Our radio
has taken up this struggle. All honest Poles
should do the same."
The signal was clear in central Warsaw, and it
came over a frequency available on any stan
dard Polish FM receiver.
An announcer promised a second trans
mission on April 30 and said that at that time
"Radio Solidarity" would announce a regular
programming schedule.
The fact of the broadcast was seen here as
more significant than its content, since the au
thorities have appeared intent on crushing the
free trade union completely. Most of its top
leaders are interned and thousands of other ac
tivists and sympathizers are also in prison or in
ternment camps.
New MX strategy studied
Washington — The Pentagon is studying still
another way to base its homeless MX missile,
one that relies in part on a far-out nuclear-war
game concept known as fratricide.
The Air Force has labeled this latest deploy
ment idea the "MX Deceptive Dense Pack (D2P)
Basing Concept." A Pentagon executive said
yesterday that Dense Pack picked up steam af
ter the Senate Armed Services Committee re
cently refused to let the Air Force put the first
MX missiles in existing Minuteman silos until
some permanent basing plan is found.
Dense Pack, as the name implies, involves
bunching MX missiles in fairly tight formations.
That is quite different from earlier basing plans,
in which it was argued that, to make them less
vulnerable, the missiles ought to be spread far
apart.
In fact, Dense Pack backers figure, it may be
better to keep the MX silos fairly close together.
The reasoning goes this way: the first Soviet

warhead to come down on a pack will not only
destroy its target, but in a kind of sympathetic
detonation, will blow up the warheads flying
right behind it on the way to other U.S. missiles
in the cluster. These other U.S. missiles may
then survive.
Soviets start major offensive
Washington — The Soviet Union has signaled
the start of a major spring offensive in Afghan
istan with attacks this week against Afghan rebel
concentrations in the southwest corner of the
country, U.S. diplomatic and intelligence
sources here report.
Analysts said the unusually large Soviet
sweeps in the province of Farah — on Afghan
istan's western border with Iran — were aimed
at cleaning out hidden pockets of rebels who
range across the flat desert land there.
More strong sweeps are expected during the
next two months with the Soviets using MiC
fighters to strafe, bomb and fire rockets at sus
pected rebel concentrations before moving in
troops by helicopter, intelligence sources said.
According to reports filtering back from Af
ghanistan, the Soviets began using tactical air
power in a few winter assaults and found it gave
them a tremendous advantage against the re
bels, who often were caught without any cover
in the bleak Afghan countryside. It also took a
greater toll on civilians, the reports said.
Stocks drift lower
Stock prices drifted lower yesterday, stalling a
spring rally, amid fresh signs of economic
weakness at home and concern over unrest
abroad.
The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials,
which rose 6.09 points Thursday and had
climbed 47.09 points since March 17, slipped
1.62 points yesterday to close at 841.32. Stock
exchanges were closed Friday.

Argentina demands sovereignty in Falklands
Buenos Aires — As Secretary of State Alexander Haig met in London
with British officials yesterday, Argentina seemed to remain open to
several possible solutions to the confrontation, although none of them
appeared to be immediately acceptable to the British.
As an immediate solution, officials here indicated that Argentina
would agree to withdraw its troops from the islands if Britain simultane
ously recalled the naval fleet now headed for the south Atlantic.
Under this plan, officials envision .negotiations proceeding on ad
minstration of the islands while Argentina tacitly retains its position of
sovereignty.
Sources here have also said that Argentina would be willing to con
sider a mixed political administration for the islands, which it calls the
Malvinas, involving officials chosen by the territory's 1000 residents, and
possibly international authority. However, Argentine officials have re
sisted suggestions of any participation by Britain in the island's govern
ment, even under Argentine sovereignty, political sources close to the
military here have said.
Argentine officials are said by political sources here to have also told
Haig that Argentina could accept a Peruvian proposal for a peace
keeping force drawn from Litin American nations that would replace
the 6000 to 8000 Argentine troops now reported to be on the disputed
islands.
However, Argentine officials are believed to be insistent on main
taining Argentina's sovereignty over the islands in any negotiated solu
tion. The military government here cannot yield Argentine control over
the territory even temporarily without endangering its own survival, po
litical sources said.
The military command here has insisted that
Britain recognize Argentina's sovereignty over
the territory, and has maintained that it was
forced to occupy the islands after 15 years of ne
gotiations produced no result.
Rioters battle Israeli police
Jerusalem — Arab demonstrators clashed
with Israeli soldiers in the Arab quarter of Jeru
salem and throughout the occupied West Bank
and Gaza Strip yesterday in a violent Moslem
protest against Sunday's shooting spree that
killed two Arabs and desecrated Islam's Dome
of the Rock shrine.
The Israeli military command said 11 Arabs
were shot and wounded by troops. Palestinian
sources said at least 13 demonstrators were
wounded by gunshots.
An almost total general strike paralyzed pre
dominate Arab East Jerusalem, which includes
the walled Old City, and towns and villages on
the West Bank and Gaza Strip. Shops and
schools were closed and most Arab workers
stayed home from their jobs.
In East Jerusalem, police prohibited a group
of Moslem leaders from marching to the Tem
ple Mount where an American-born Israeli
went on a shooting rampage Sunday at the
golden domed shrine that ranks as the third
most important site in Islam.
The Temple Mount area was closed to tourists
for an indefinite period.
Police continued to question Alan Goodman,
30, an emigrant from New Jersey, who was ar
rested inside the Dome of the Rock and
charged with kilJing two Arabs and wounding
several others. Police said the gunman, dressed
in an Israeli army uniform, sprayed the shrine
with gunfire, shooting at random at any Arab
who carpe across his path.
