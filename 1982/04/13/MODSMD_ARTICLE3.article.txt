Argentina demands sovereignty in Falklands
Buenos Aires — As Secretary of State Alexander Haig met in London
with British officials yesterday, Argentina seemed to remain open to
several possible solutions to the confrontation, although none of them
appeared to be immediately acceptable to the British.
As an immediate solution, officials here indicated that Argentina
would agree to withdraw its troops from the islands if Britain simultane
ously recalled the naval fleet now headed for the south Atlantic.
Under this plan, officials envision .negotiations proceeding on ad
minstration of the islands while Argentina tacitly retains its position of
sovereignty.
Sources here have also said that Argentina would be willing to con
sider a mixed political administration for the islands, which it calls the
Malvinas, involving officials chosen by the territory's 1000 residents, and
possibly international authority. However, Argentine officials have re
sisted suggestions of any participation by Britain in the island's govern
ment, even under Argentine sovereignty, political sources close to the
military here have said.
Argentine officials are said by political sources here to have also told
Haig that Argentina could accept a Peruvian proposal for a peace
keeping force drawn from Litin American nations that would replace
the 6000 to 8000 Argentine troops now reported to be on the disputed
islands.
However, Argentine officials are believed to be insistent on main
taining Argentina's sovereignty over the islands in any negotiated solu
tion. The military government here cannot yield Argentine control over
the territory even temporarily without endangering its own survival, po
litical sources said.
