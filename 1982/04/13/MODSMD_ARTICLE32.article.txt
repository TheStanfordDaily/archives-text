# Italian filmmaker makes profound connections
## 
### Steve Vineberg 
When a moment in a film affects us pro
foundly, it isn't always easy to analyze why. In
Yasujiro Ozu's exquisite Tokyo Story, an old
woman watches her grandson playing on a
hilltop and asks him if he wants to be like his
father when he grows up. As the little boy
continues to amuse himself, ignoring his
grandmother, she asks sadly, "And when you
grow up, where will I be?"
i haven't seen this picture in a decade, but
I've retained the image; the arrangement of
the two figures against the landscape ex
presses a world of feeling about relationships
between generations, growth and loss, and
the fear of approaching death. Only a hand
ful of directors have had Ozu's genius for
evoking so much with such apparent sim
plicity — Renoir and De Sica, of course, Satya
jit Ray and Robert Altman are the ones who
come most readily to mind. The Italian film
maker Francesco Rosi, whose Three Brothers
(Tre Fratelli) has just been released in this
country, has it too.
Rosi's most recent work towers above any
thing by his compatriots that has reached us
since Padre Padrone and Tree of Wooden
Clogs — indeed, above most world film — yet
none of his pictures has drawn much critical
or public attention. He has been involved in
the Italian film industry since the late '40s
(before that he studied law, illustrated books
and reported news on the radio), when he
learned direction under Visconti and later
Monicelli and Antonioni, and wrote
screenplays.

His earliest directed movies appeared in
the late '50s, though he is perhaps best
known, if at all, for the 1963 Hands Over the
City with Rod Steiger and the 1965 The Mo
ment of Truth, a brutally frontal study of bull
fighting. In these pictures and The Mattei Af
fair and Lucky Luciano, which came almost
10 years later, he employed a realistic style,
suggestive of documentary but far richer in
vivid detail, that seemed to take off from the
Italian neo-realists, while at the same time
presenting complex issues — all his films, es
pecially Hands Over the City and The Mattei
Affair, concern themselves to some degree
with political and social material — with the
clarity of a slower, more contemplative Cos
ta-Gavras. The early scenes in Hands Over the
City, which revolves around a building scan
dal, have a broad, Brechtian satirical tone, it is
true, but Rosi's films do not often reveal a
bias, as Costa-Gavras' do; his chief interest
lies clearly with human beings.
In his most extraordinary film, the 1980
Eboli — which had a shockingly brief run in
America — the writer protagonist Carlo Levi
(Gian Maria Volonte), has been exiled for his
anti-fascist sentiments to a small, backward
town in southern Italy in the mid-'30s. At
one point he discovers that the mayor has
been opening his mail, but the scene that
ensues is not a burst of righteous indignation
on the part of a wronged captive. Rosi allows
us to see that the mayor, too, is trapped — he
is acting according to the dictates of his politi
cal conscience.
In Eboli, Rosi gives us a great humanist
hero: Levi's love for the destitute, super
stitious southerners he lives with extends to
the petty, corrupt officials — the lower rungs
of the hierarchy that barricades and crushes
the people under their jurisdiction. Carlo
Levi is an imaginative counterpart for Fran
cesco Rosi.
Three Brothers is not quite as good as Eboli;
that is, it's only a near-masterpiece. If people
go to see it, it is sure to become a beloved
movie — I can't conceive of an audience that
would reject its warmth and humanity and
the rich, poetic simplicity of its imagery. Like
Eboli, it is set in rural southern Italy.
Donato (Charles Vanel) has lost his wife
and telegraphs his three grown-up sons to re
turn to mourn with him. Each arrives at the
scene of his childhood, bringing with him a
measure of his life in the city. The eldest, Raf
faele (Philippe Noiret), is a judge involved
with the trial of a terrorist group; he has been
made the object of a series of death threats
that hound him in nightmares.
The second, Rocco (Vittorio
Mezzogiorno), physically and emotionally
most like his father, operates a correctional
Institute for boys and longs to dedicate his life
in an even fuller way to easing the suffering of

children. The youngest, the impetuous Nico
la (Michele Placido), works at an auto factory
in Turin, where his anti-management ac
tivities have aroused the ire of his employers;
he is accompanied on this sad journey by his
young daughter Marta (Marta Zoffoli), the
product of a failed marriage.
There are many themes in Three Brothers
— the tension between northern and south
ern Italy, terrorism, the possibility for realiz
ing human potential in an urban environ
ment, the influence of American values on
the Italian way of life from the time of the Lib
eration — but the overriding theme is con
nection: intergenerational, marital, fraternal,
severed, rejoined.
In leaving the place of their birth, the sons
have sacrificed their connection to their roots
and therefore to each other; Raffaele and
Nicola, viewing each other at a distance of
20 years as strangers, cannot sympathize
with each other's politics (Raffaele believes
in the essential permanence of institutions
and sees Nicola's anti-establishment stance
— his condonation of labor violence — as in
cipient terrorism), and Roco's altruism has a
missionary fervor that neither of his brothers
can comprehend.
In the view of Rosi and his co-writer Tonino
Guerra (whose screenplay is based on
Platonov's The Third Son) — and in the grand
tradition of agrarian movies such as Visconti's
La Terra Trema, Padre Padrone, The Tree of
Wooden Clogs and Bertolucci's 1900, the
farther one travels from the earth, the more

precarious the balance of one's existence in
the world: the center no longer holds, mar
riages fall apart, filial bonds become frayed.
Against the unhappy marriage of Nicola and
his wife stands the model of Donato and his
wife, whose lives were inseparably in
tertwined until death — and even beyond
death, as the beautiful final image of the mov
ie tells us. And in the atmosphere of the city,
not only have the sons grown away from the
father, but Raffaele's son, we see when he
speaks to his father on the phone, has grown
away from him too.
The most delicately drawn relationship in
the movie is that of Donato and his grand
daughter Marta; in the course of this dread
ful, draining period of loss, when every step
Donato takes in his house and yard seems to
signal his wife's absence, the old man and the
child come together across the gap of two
generations and form a bond that is the film's
great statement of rebirth and reaffirmation.
Marta discovers the joys of country life as
her father and uncles must have before he/-
she explores the rooms of the olc' house,
questions her grandfather about the roosters
and the configuration of the stars, and buries
her bare legs in grain — an image that is re
called later, in a flashback to the early days of
Donato's marriage, when his bride plays in
the sand and loses her wedding ring amid the
grains; "You're like a little girl," he ad
monishes her tenderly as he helps her to find
it again. (Rosi builds on symbols as a poet
does; the ring, too, resonates in another se
quence).
furthermore, the grain, which lies like gold
dust in heaps in the storehouse and scattered
about the ground for the cocks and pigeons
to feed on, harks back to a scene in The Mo
ment of Truth when grain flies through the air
like fairy dust as the women shovel it up.
When Nicola returns to Turin, he leaves
Marta behind with his father.
Nicola dreams of forging a new connection
with his wife, just as Raffaele dreams of his
own death and Rocco of the delivery of chil
dren from the chains of drugs and violence;
these fantasy sequences juxtapose each other
and reflect the differences in the perceptions
of the three brothers as well as the ways in
which their preoccupations are, ironically,
linked. Rocco, the most primal of the three,
combats the obstacles that modern society
has thrown in the way of children; Raffaele
must judge, and condemn, the grown-up
chidren who have been perverted by those
