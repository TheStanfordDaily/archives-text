# McNeill's famous people are 'skin deep'
## Cast fails to save superficial play 
### jiri Weiss 
Superficiality is a trap that many play
wrights, including New Zealand's Brian
McNeill, fail to avoid when they are
writing about the lives of famous peo
ple. It is so easy to rely on awe-inspring
names as substitute for plot. All you
need to do it is to gloss over a life of a
prominent individual — dropping a
name here and a quote there to cap
tivate an audience bred on People mag
azine. But perhaps this is unkind to
McNeill who does succeed in giving his
characters life at least to some degree.
The lives of Katherine Mansfield and
John Murry provide fascinating materi
al. Born into a middle-class New Zea
land family, Mansfield rebelled against
her domineering father. In 1908 she left
home for England to become a writer.
She was only 20. In England she lead a
the life of a free-spirit and an artist:

breaking every rule of Victorian pro
priety. She had numerous relationships
with both men and women and after

getting unhappily married she fell in
love with, lived with and eventually
married John Murry.
Murry was a young critic and am
bitious publisher of a literary magazine
Rhytm. Murry who was a veiy close
friend of D.H. Lawrence — Lawrence
wrote about their relationship in Wom
en in Love.
But Mansfield's rebellion was
doomed. She deeply grieved for her
brother who was killed in world War I
and she contracted gonorrhea and tu
berculosis. The former, undetected for
years, gave her lifelong arthritic pain,
the latter killed her at the age of 34 after
a prolonged struggle that ended in her
conversion to mysticism.
McNeill's play The Two Tigers deals
with the relationship between Mans
field and Murry from their first meeting
at a literary soiree to Mansfield's death
in a commune, but the effect is only
skin deep. Most of the play is taken up
with both Mansfield and Murry sitting
at desks writing sometimes hateful but
mostly endearing letters to each other.
The play does not deal adequately
either with Mansfield's rebellion or her
fear of death. The play never mentions
much about their work which surely
must have been important in the rela
tionship. Nor does the play explore the
couple's ralationship to Lawrence and
his wife Frieda. Lawrence is shown as a
kind of sex maniac who wants to seal his
relationship with Murry with blood —
the old Indian way.
McNeill would have done well if he
had concentrated on one period of
Mansfield's life rather then trying to
deal with the whole.

Julian Theatre's West Coast premiere
of the play does not manage to over
come the difficulties inherent in the
play: Mansfield has to grow from a
young and rather naive girl into a sick
and weary womanhood. Jenny Sterlin
finds it hard to play Mansfield, the
young rebellious girl who has just ar-

rived from the colonies. She dveracts at
the begining to compensate for the fact
that she is much older then the part. But
she saves the play as she begins to get
more comfortable.
Murry is by contrast quite believable.
Gary Petlnger gives plenty of character
development — from the shy college
boy through his passionate love affair
with Mansfield.
The supporting actors, Rebecca
Stockley — who plays Freida, and David
Brune — Lawrence, do equally well.
The whole cast tries hard, but it is dif
ficult to save the play or the mis-cast
Sterlin.

Superficiality is a trap that many play
wrights, including New Zealand's Brian
McNeill, fail to avoid when they are
writing about the lives of famous peo
ple. It is so easy to rely on awe-inspring
names as substitute for plot. All you
need to do it is to gloss over a life of a
prominent individual — dropping a
name here and a quote there to cap
tivate an audience bred on People mag
azine. But perhaps this is unkind to
McNeill who does succeed in giving his
characters life at least to some degree.
The lives of Katherine Mansfield and
John Murry provide fascinating materi
al. Born into a middle-class New Zea
land family, Mansfield rebelled against
her domineering father. In 1908 she left
home for England to become a writer.
She was only 20. In England she lead a
the life of a free-spirit and an artist:

breaking every rule of Victorian pro
priety. She had numerous relationships
with both men and women and after

getting unhappily married she fell in
love with, lived with and eventually
married John Murry.
Murry was a young critic and am
bitious publisher of a literary magazine
Rhytm. Murry who was a veiy close
friend of D.H. Lawrence — Lawrence
wrote about their relationship in Wom
en in Love.
But Mansfield's rebellion was
doomed. She deeply grieved for her
brother who was killed in world War I
and she contracted gonorrhea and tu
berculosis. The former, undetected for
years, gave her lifelong arthritic pain,
the latter killed her at the age of 34 after
a prolonged struggle that ended in her
conversion to mysticism.
McNeill's play The Two Tigers deals
with the relationship between Mans
field and Murry from their first meeting
at a literary soiree to Mansfield's death
in a commune, but the effect is only
skin deep. Most of the play is taken up
with both Mansfield and Murry sitting
at desks writing sometimes hateful but
mostly endearing letters to each other.
The play does not deal adequately
either with Mansfield's rebellion or her
fear of death. The play never mentions
much about their work which surely
must have been important in the rela
tionship. Nor does the play explore the
couple's ralationship to Lawrence and
his wife Frieda. Lawrence is shown as a
kind of sex maniac who wants to seal his
relationship with Murry with blood —
the old Indian way.
McNeill would have done well if he
had concentrated on one period of
Mansfield's life rather then trying to
deal with the whole.

Julian Theatre's West Coast premiere
of the play does not manage to over
come the difficulties inherent in the
play: Mansfield has to grow from a
young and rather naive girl into a sick
and weary womanhood. Jenny Sterlin
finds it hard to play Mansfield, the
young rebellious girl who has just ar-
