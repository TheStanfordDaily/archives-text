# Male student injured in dormitory accident
## 
### 
A student here was listed in stable
condition yesterday after breaking
his spinal cord during a game in
which he and his friends flew from a
speeding office chair and tried to
land on cushions in Toyon Hall early
Sunday morning.
Mike Lung, a junior and former
Toyon resident, missed the cushions
and landed on the hard tile floor of
the dormitory, immediately breaking
his spinal cord. His friends, realizing
that he had no sensation below his
chest area, immediately called para
medics, who took the 20-year-old to
Stanford Hospital.
He was transferred to Kaiser Hospi
tal in Redwood City on Sunday, and
has regained sensation above his
knees, according to a hospital
source. She said she did not know
what his chances for full recovery
were.

Lung and about 10 of his friends
began playing the game around 11
p.m. Saturday. The accident oc
curred at 1:40 a.m. Sunday.
They had dismantled a chair and
were using it as a cart, said Classics
Prof. Gregson Davis, the Toyon resi
dent fellow, who was asleep while
the game was going on.
The participants pushed the chair
and jumped on it when it was moving
at its maximum speed. They had at
tached a rope to the bottom of the
chair which caused the chair to be
pulled from beneath the rider, and
the rider would fly, often as far as 15
feet, from the top of a short stairway
to the cushions at the bottom of the
stairway.
According to Davis, Lung acciden
tally pushed the cushions, which slid
easily on the tile floor, out of his way
when he landed.
