Time for a sun dance
It's not fair. For two long quarters, the same thoughts have been run
ning around the back of everyone's mind: "I can't wait for spring. The
lake will get full, the sun will come out and I won't see a cloud for ten
weeks." All year we've been telling our friends at home: "Spring quar
ter at Stanford is nothing but one solid party."
This year has been more like solid sogginess. All around campus, stu
dents wear forlorn looks as they try to figure out how to while away the
rainy afternoons. They're only taking ten units; they planned to wind
surf all quarter. The University feels bad. It won't admit it's not spring.
The April Campus Report featured a series of pictures entitled "Stan
ford spring." They looked great, but they must have been taken in late
February when the sun did come out.
