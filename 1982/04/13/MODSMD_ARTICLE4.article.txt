# Truman scholars announced
## 
### Sally Newman 
In recognition of commitment to a
career in the public service and "out
standing leadership potential,"
sophomores Patrick O'Reilly and
James Sherman have been awarded
$20,000 Harry S.. Truman Memorial
Scholarships.
The awards carry annual stipends
of $5000 over the next four years for
the 102 students selected in a na
tionwide competition which in
cluded thousands of nominees and
more than 230 semi-finalists and
spanned five months.
Students are nominated for the
award by the universities which they
attend. Each university may nomi
nate one or two candidates per year.
The selection of Truman Scholars,
however, is made within the states;
O'Reilly, who is from Pepper Pike,
Ohio, is Ohio's 1982Truman Scholar.
Additionally, a variable number of
students are chosen to represent one
of 13 regions; Sherman, who is from
Trumbull, Conn., represents the
Connecticut region.
O'Reilly is planning to major in po
litical science and go on to law
school. "I'm not sure whether I want
to serve in the diplomatic corps or on
a congressional committee," he said,
"but I'm especially interested in in
ternational relations and in working
in the government sector."
Both O'Reilly and Sherman have
earned 4.0 averages in courses in
their major field. Sherman, an eco
nomics major, hopes to obtain both a
Ph.D. in economics and a law degree
— "hopefully- back East." Between
graduation and graduate school, he
plans to spend about a year as a staff
assistant to the Council of Economic
Advisers.
Without even considering future
ambitions, though, Political Science
Prof. Hubert Marshall, a member of
the committee which selects Stan
ford's nominees, called the pair's ac
complishments "very impressive."
"When the interviewers and I
compare what we'd done at that age
to the service and leadership records
of Jthfifre students, we (Ind that we are
extremely impressed by what they
have already done," he said.
Sherman, who first became in
terested in government when he
served on a committee at Choate to

raise scholarship funds for needy stu
dents, has served on two University
comn\>ees during his year-and-a
half here. He is now Stanford-in-
Government's director for Washing
ton agencies.
A proficient piano player, Sherman
once considered pursuing a career in
music at Julliard. He was assistant mu
sic director in Rinconada's produc
tion last year of Bye Bye Birdie, and
this year is involved with the Row
house musical, No No Nanette.
Both Sherman and O'Reilly plan to
begin their years as Truman Scholars
in England. Sherman plans to spend
fall quarter studying at the London
School of Economics, while O'Reilly
will study at Cliveden during the
summer and hopes to work as a Brit
ish Parliamentary intern during
autumn.
Also a member of several Univer
sity committees, including the Com
mittee on Undergraduate Studies
and the Committee on Evaluation
and Improvement of Teaching,
O'Reilly is now serving as assistant
ASSU election commissioner. In his
spare time, he teaches an Advanced
Placement U.S. history course at San
Carlos High School. He has two
brothers, Mike and Tom, who are
also attending Stanford.
The selection process involved two
interviews and an application which
included several essays. Applicants

had to write a 600-word essay on
some issue of public policy, recalled
O'Reilly, and then during the last in
terview were required to discuss and
defend their positions.
Semi-finalists were interviewed in
The region they represented; travel
costs and accommodations were
furnished by the scholarship commit
tee. Each candidate appeared before
a panel of five local social science
professors. "It was funny, but both
sets of interviewers were interested
in the fact that we were from Stan
ford," Sherman said. "Mine in partic
ular made it a point to ask, 'Why did
you choose Stanford when you're
from the East?' "
Both Sherman and O'Reilly said
that they suspected that being from
Stanford influenced their chances.
"It's hard to tqll, though," said
O'Reilly, "even though only a hand
ful of schools had two winners."
O'Reilly and Sherman, along with
the other 1982 winners, will travel to
Independence, Mo., Truman's
birthplace, to officially receive their
awards on May 9. In its fifth year, the
scholarship program now includes
five Stanford recipients. Two, Jeff
Bradach and Bill Halter, are currently
juniors here. The other Truman
Scholar, Peter Stamos, graduated
from Stanford in 1980. Stamos was
chosen last year to receive a Rhodes
Scholarship.

in England. Sherman plans to spend
fall quarter studying at the London
School of Economics, while O'Reilly
will study at Cliveden during the
summer and hopes to work as a Brit
ish Parliamentary intern during
autumn.
Also a member of several Univer
sity committees, including the Com
mittee on Undergraduate Studies
and the Committee on Evaluation
and Improvement of Teaching,
O'Reilly is now serving as assistant
ASSU election commissioner. In his
spare time, he teaches an Advanced
Placement U.S. history course at San
Carlos High School. He has two
brothers, Mike and Tom, who are
also attending Stanford.
The selection process involved two
interviews and an application which
included several essays. Applicants

had to write a 600-word essay on
some issue of public policy, recalled
O'Reilly, and then during the last in
terview were required to discuss and
defend their positions.
Semi-finalists were interviewed in
The region they represented; travel
costs and accommodations were
furnished by the scholarship commit
tee. Each candidate appeared before
a panel of five local social science
professors. "It was funny, but both
sets of interviewers were interested
in the fact that we were from Stan
ford," Sherman said. "Mine in partic
ular made it a point to ask, 'Why did
you choose Stanford when you're
from the East?' "
Both Sherman and O'Reilly said
that they suspected that being from
Stanford influenced their chances.
"It's hard to tqll, though," said
O'Reilly, "even though only a hand
ful of schools had two winners."
O'Reilly and Sherman, along with
the other 1982 winners, will travel to
Independence, Mo., Truman's
birthplace, to officially receive their
awards on May 9. In its fifth year, the
scholarship program now includes
five Stanford recipients. Two, Jeff
Bradach and Bill Halter, are currently
juniors here. The other Truman
Scholar, Peter Stamos, graduated
from Stanford in 1980. Stamos was
chosen last year to receive a Rhodes
Scholarship.

O'Reilly and Sherman
In recognition of commitment to a
career in the public service and "out
standing leadership potential,"
sophomores Patrick O'Reilly and
James Sherman have been awarded
$20,000 Harry S.. Truman Memorial
Scholarships.
The awards carry annual stipends
of $5000 over the next four years for
the 102 students selected in a na
tionwide competition which in
cluded thousands of nominees and
more than 230 semi-finalists and
spanned five months.
Students are nominated for the
award by the universities which they
attend. Each university may nomi
nate one or two candidates per year.
The selection of Truman Scholars,
however, is made within the states;
O'Reilly, who is from Pepper Pike,
Ohio, is Ohio's 1982Truman Scholar.
Additionally, a variable number of
students are chosen to represent one
of 13 regions; Sherman, who is from
Trumbull, Conn., represents the
Connecticut region.
O'Reilly is planning to major in po
litical science and go on to law
school. "I'm not sure whether I want
to serve in the diplomatic corps or on
a congressional committee," he said,
"but I'm especially interested in in
ternational relations and in working
in the government sector."
Both O'Reilly and Sherman have
earned 4.0 averages in courses in
their major field. Sherman, an eco
nomics major, hopes to obtain both a
Ph.D. in economics and a law degree
— "hopefully- back East." Between
graduation and graduate school, he
plans to spend about a year as a staff
assistant to the Council of Economic
Advisers.
Without even considering future
ambitions, though, Political Science
Prof. Hubert Marshall, a member of
the committee which selects Stan
ford's nominees, called the pair's ac
complishments "very impressive."
"When the interviewers and I
compare what we'd done at that age
to the service and leadership records
of Jthfifre students, we (Ind that we are
extremely impressed by what they
have already done," he said.
Sherman, who first became in
terested in government when he
served on a committee at Choate to

raise scholarship funds for needy stu
dents, has served on two University
comn\>ees during his year-and-a
half here. He is now Stanford-in-
Government's director for Washing
ton agencies.
A proficient piano player, Sherman
once considered pursuing a career in
music at Julliard. He was assistant mu
sic director in Rinconada's produc
tion last year of Bye Bye Birdie, and
this year is involved with the Row
house musical, No No Nanette.
