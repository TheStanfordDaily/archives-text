# Student claims charges against him unfounded

### Kathy Christie 
Robert Warden, a Durand House
resident who was arrested and re
leased on citation last week for al
legedly pushing a student alarm
technician down a flight of stairs dur
ing a fire drill, insists that the charges
against him are unfounded, and stu
dent eyewitnesses interviewed by
the Daily concur.
At 11:30 p.m. last Monday the
alarm went off in the house and ev
eryone, including Warden, exited.
While Warden was standing on the
porch, two men wearing plain

clothes and ski jackets came out of
the house. According to John
Celona, Durand's house manager,
Warden asked the two, who later
turned out to be alarm technicians,
what they were doing. "For all we
knew, they could've been a couple of
guys pulling a prank," said Celona.
Celona said that neither man pro
duced any identification, and accord

and Rusty van Patten, they instead
laughed and said, "Why don't you be
cool, man?"
At this point Warden pushed one

of the men across the porch with
what the Durand witnesses said was
not a very hard push. Celona, who
was standing near Warden at theÂ«
time, backed up Warden's story by
saying that the man pushed neither
was on any steps nor went near any
steps, and that "there didn't seem the
slightest chance of physical danger."
Warden, a senior majoring in in
dustrial engineering, said that al
though the incident was promptly
forgotten after house residents re
turned inside, the next morning po
lice showed up at his room with the

alarm technician, who on the spot
made a citizen's arrest. Police would
not release the name of the alarm
technician, and he was thus un
available for comment to the Daily.
Warden said his plans to have a job
interview were disrupted as he was
searched, handcuffed and taken to
the police station. His arraignment is
scheduled for April 21, at which time
a trial date will be set.
Stanford Police Chief Marvin Her
