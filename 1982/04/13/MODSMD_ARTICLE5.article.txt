# Student claims charges against him unfounded
## 
### Kathy Christie 
Robert Warden, a Durand House
resident who was arrested and re
leased on citation last week for al
legedly pushing a student alarm
technician down a flight of stairs dur
ing a fire drill, insists that the charges
against him are unfounded, and stu
dent eyewitnesses interviewed by
the Daily concur.
At 11:30 p.m. last Monday the
alarm went off in the house and ev
eryone, including Warden, exited.
While Warden was standing on the
porch, two men wearing plain

clothes and ski jackets came out of
the house. According to John
Celona, Durand's house manager,
Warden asked the two, who later
turned out to be alarm technicians,
what they were doing. "For all we
knew, they could've been a couple of
guys pulling a prank," said Celona.
Celona said that neither man pro
duced any identification, and accord
ing to Durand residents David Austin
and Rusty van Patten, they instead
laughed and said, "Why don't you be
cool, man?"
At this point Warden pushed one

of the men across the porch with
what the Durand witnesses said was
not a very hard push. Celona, who
was standing near Warden at the«
time, backed up Warden's story by
saying that the man pushed neither
was on any steps nor went near any
steps, and that "there didn't seem the
slightest chance of physical danger."
Warden, a senior majoring in in
dustrial engineering, said that al
though the incident was promptly
forgotten after house residents re
turned inside, the next morning po
lice showed up at his room with the

alarm technician, who on the spot
made a citizen's arrest. Police would
not release the name of the alarm
technician, and he was thus un
available for comment to the Daily.
Warden said his plans to have a job
interview were disrupted as he was
searched, handcuffed and taken to
the police station. His arraignment is
scheduled for April 21, at which time
a trial date will be set.
Stanford Police Chief Marvin Her
rington said that fire drills are per
formed approximately once a quar
ter in University residences. The job
of the student alarm technicians is to
check not only the mechanics of the
system but the degree of efficiency
with which members of a house react
to the alarm.
Although Warden said he sees the
need for such a system, he also said
he feels that the present system is in
adequate, and that its inadequacies
were in part responsible for last
Monday's incident. He said that he
has suggested to Herrington that the
technicians be given distinctive
jackets or some other means of
positive identification and that the
fire drills should perhaps be run in
conjunction with a house meeting.
Warden also said he feels harassed
because of the incident.
