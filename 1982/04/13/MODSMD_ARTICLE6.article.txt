# Initiative urges efficient water management
## 
### Mike Thurman Senior staff writer 
A proponent of the state water re
form initiative yesterday blamed
large California "agribusinesses" for
encouraging water management
practices that threaten environmen
tal damageand economicdisruption.
Santa Clara County Coordinator
Nini Redway said during a sherry
hour at Theta Chi House that sup
porters of the Water Resources Con
servation and Efficiency Act have
gathered some 430,000 signatures in
an attempt to place the measure on
the November ballot.
"We're trying to restabilize the
economy of California," Redway
said. "As one of our most precious
resources, the way we manage water

will directly affect the California
economy."
According .to Redway, the in
itiative focuses on three types of pro
tection programs in an attempt to sta
bilize and utilize California wa
tershed areas more efficently.
A conservation clause would re
quire that state planners make de
cisions on future water construction
projects on a "least cost first basis,"
choosing the least expensive method
of construction in an effort to hold
costs down. The clause would also
eliminate subsidies which make large
volumes of water available to large
Kern County "agribusinesses" at low
prices to the detriment of Southern
California water users who must pay
higher water bills as a result.

"When you're not paying the true
cost for a resource," Redway said,
"you can afford to waste it... Then
the value of the resource is no longer
reflected in the valueof the dollar...
and that's what's ruining our econo
my."
An in-stream protection clause
would allow river users to obtain per
mits regulating the minimum flow of
water through a specific section of a
river. Such permits would allow
farmers, fishermen, utility com
panies, whitewater enthusiasts and
others to ensure that their activities
are not curtailed by reduced flows as
engineers build water levels in dams
upstream.
The third clause, according to
Redway, would protect ground wa

ter basins that are draining faster than
they are being replenished, causing
sinkage in some areas and extreme
salinization in others. Redway said
that 11 water basins are currently
listed as "critically overdrafted" by
the state Deparment of Water Re
sources.
"They're pulling out so much wa
ter (in some desert areas) that the
natural runoff mixes with water that
is so salty that it can't be uspd,"
Redway said.
Redway said that the initiative is
not associated with the Peripheral
Canal issue (Proposition 9) which will
be decided by voters in the upcom
ing June election, although many of
the same groups are working on both
issues.
When asked what effect the defeat
of the Peripheral Canal issue would
have on the water reform initiative in
November, Redway said, "It would
have a tremendous effect. It would
be the first time that the voters said
that a project like this was too ex

pensive, and it would start a momen
tum that could carry through No
vember."
Although only 349,000 valid signa
tures are required to bring the in- *
itiatve before the voters, Redway said
that the California Water Protection
Council will continue to collect peti
tions up to their April 25 deadline or
until their goal of 500,000 signatures
is reached in order to ensure enough
valid signatures.
