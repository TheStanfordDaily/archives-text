# Times to remove its name from college guide
## 
### Eric Lim 
The New York Times has decided to remove
its name from the title of its controversial col
lege ratings guide, The New York Times Selec
tive Guide to Colleges.
The guide, which gave Stanford top honors,
rated 256 colleges around the nation with one
to five stars in the three areas of academics, so
cial life and total quality of life. (Stanford, along
with Brown and the University of Virginia, re
ceived 14 out of a possible 15 stars.) Many
schools objected to this rating system on the
basis that it likened college descriptions to res
taurant reviews.
Calling the title of the book's first edition an
"error in judgement," Leonard Harris, the
Times director of corporate relations, said the
Times' name "gave the feeling that all the mate
rial in the book was the judgment of the news
paper, when in fact the judgments (of the col
leges) are those of our education editor." Harris

added, however, that the change is in no way a
statement about the integrity of the guide. He
described the education editor, Edward Fiske,
as "remarkable and highly qualified."
Schools questioned the accuracy of Fiske's
method of obtaining data through 25 student
and three administrative questionnaires sent to
each school. Chandler Harris, director of public
information for low-rated UCLA, commented,
"We didn't cooperate with them. Twenty-five
students is not an accurate examination of an
institution."
Leonard Harris, however, expressed surprise
at the attention being paid to the ranking sys
tem, adding that the Times has published de
scriptions of colleges since 1956 "in rankings of
one form or another."
While absent from the book's new title, The
Selective Guide to Colleges, The New York

Times' name will still appear on the front cover.
This change is effective with the guide's second
edition, whose printing is underway. The book,
released in January, sold out its first printing of
15,000 copies.
According to Fiske, the format and content of
the guide will remain virtually unchanged, al
though "inevitable factual errors" will be cor
rected. He also named Colby College in Water
ville, Maine, as the only school to have its rating
changed so far. Colby officials presented Fiske
with evidence of how he had erred in giving
Colby only three stars for academics.
Fiske said he is open to information from
schools who think that their ratings have been
based on inaccurate comments or have
changed. He also invited,colleges and others to
submit comments about the guide, saying, "As
colleges evolve, so will the guide."
