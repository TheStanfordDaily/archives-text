## Stanford studies show interferon has complicated effects 
### Bruce Quinn 
Interferon, hailed a few years ago as a
wonder drug for both common colds and
cancer, is proving to be a chemical with a
bewildering range of effects on the body,
and its potential roles in clinical medicine
are just beginning to be understood, accord
ing to two recent studies at the Medical Cen
ter here.
A study led by Dr. Ann Arvin, assistant pro
fessor of pediatrics, showed that, as an anti
viral agent, interferon reduced the rate of
life-threatening complications of chicken
pox in children undergoing conventional

treatment for cancer. According to Arvin,
childhood diseases like chicken pox are
sometimes a major threat to children with
cancer, because their immune system is sup
pressed by most anti-cancer drugs.
In a separate study headed by Dr. Thomas
Merigan, professor of infectious disease, in
terferon synthesized by bacteria via recom
binant DNA techniques was shown to be
moderately effective as an anti-cancer agent.
This study is one of the first to use interferon
not purified from human cells.
Interferon is one of the first drugs to be
produced by insertion of a human gene into

bacteria. Although one major goal of this
work is simply to produce the drug at rea
sonable cost and in sufficient quantities for
clinical use, these studies have also un
covered a wide range of unsuspected char
acteristics of interferon. It is now known that
there are at least three basic classes of in
terferons in the human body, and one class
may have up to 14 subtypes. Understanding
how these classes of interferons interact, and
which ones are effective in combating a giv
en disease, are two major goals of interferon
recc^rch.
Currently, the best-understood action of

interferon is as an anti-viral agent. Studies
with laboratory cell cultures have suggested
that interferon does not interfere with vi
ruses directly, but, rather, acts as a messen
ger to the infected cell. Interferon triggers
the production of chemicals in the infected
cell which prevent virus genes from becom
ing active, but have no effect on human
genes.
Two other major actions of interferon
have been discovered but remain poorly un
derstood, and their relation to the anti-viral
effect is unknown. Interferon inhibits the
rate of growth of cancer cells in laboratory

cultures. Interferon also has effects on the
immune system, by increasing the effective- „■
ness of a type of white blood cell called the-'
"natural killer" cell. These cells recognize
and kill foreign cells in the body, such as bac
teria, and may also be able to recognize
cancer cells as unnatural and kill them.
In a Daily interview, Merigan said that his
group is "very interested in the exact mecha
nisms of interferon action, particularly in
laboratory tumor cells." Colonies of in
terferon-resistant tumor cells will be stud
ied, and may indicate the normal mechanism
of interferon action on tumors.
