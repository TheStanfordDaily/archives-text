The Medical Center has
opened a new unit for patients
with dehabilitated immunesys
tems, designed to provide pro
tection against infection and to
create a psychologically
nourishing environment.
Located in the east wing of
the hospital, the new unit,
called the compromised host
unit, provides special facilities
for victims of acute myeloid
leukemia, acute lymphoblastic
leukemia, and patients in the
bone marrow transplant pro
gram, a new development at

the Medical Center.
The new unit will mainly
house patients with these three
conditions, although people
with other diseases can also
qualify for a spot in the unit.
The common factor exhibited
by the patients treated in the
unit will be a dehabilitated im
mune system that renders
them particularly susceptible
to infection.
According to Dr. Stanley
Schrier, professor of medicine
and chief of the Division of
Hematology, the new unit,
with the aim of providing con

trol of infection and more sen
sitive care, was developed in
response to what both the fac
ulty and the community felt
was a high priority item.
The compromised host unit
tries to control against infec
tion through isolation, filtered
air systems for each of the six
single rooms, intense hand
washing, an interior designed
so no cracks exist in the sides of
the walls, slightly positive air
pressure that keeps air flowing
away from the patients, and
high quality nursing.

The Medical Center stresses
the importance of the psy
chological well-being of these
patients.
According to Schrier, during
this stressful time of hospi
talization which lasts, on the
average, 30-36 days, clarifying
personal relationships and hav
ing the psychological and so
cial support of family members
are immeasurably important.
The new unit encourages
counseling and provides ac
commodations for family
members.
