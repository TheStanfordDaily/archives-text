# Soviet Vice Consul barred from forum
## 
### Kathy Bodovitz Senior staff writer 
For the fourth time this year, the
State Department has denied a Soviet
official permission to come to the
Stanford campus.
Soviet Vice Consul Vladimir
Bachurov was scheduled to speak on
the nuclear arms race yesterday af
ternoon at a public forum at Bechtel
International Center.According to a
State Department spokesman,
Bachurov failed to apply for per
mission to make the trip here from
San Francisco two full working days
prior to the event, as is required.
In addition to prohibiting Soviet
scholar Nikolay Umnov from visiting
Stanford earlier this year, the State
Department also refused to allow
Yuri Krapolov of the Soviet embassy
to speak here and denied a repre
sentative of Tass, the Soviet news
agency, permission to attend the
speech here last month by Secretary
of Defense Caspar Weinberger.
Father Joe Frazier, one of the six
campus chaplains who invited
Bachurov to speak here, said, "The
State Department has once more de
cided that what he (Bachurov) has to
say is not for our ears." Frazier added
that before the Reagan adminis
tration took office, he did not have
trouble with the State Department
denying Soviet officials permission to
come to campus.
Because Bachurov was absent,
Frazier himself read the vice consul's
speech to the approximately 150
people who attended the forum.
Addressing common mispercep
tions about the Soviet Union,
Bachurov wrote, "We do not seek
confrontation with the United States
... We truly desire to establish a base
of trust and good will between our
two countries."
Bachurov's text said Americans
hold widespread misconceptions
about the so-called "Soviet military
threat" and u»e the myth of Soviet
aggression to legitimize a larger mili
tary budget and resulting support for
the military-industrial complex.
"If one excludes a nuclear ex
change, which would be suicidal for
everyone, the United States is not in
danger from the Soviet Union,"
Bachurov wrote. He asserted that the

Soviet military doctrine has a de
fensive character and excludes any
first strike proposals. "The Soviet
Union is menacing no one, nor does
it have the intention of threatening
anyone," he wrote.
Bachurov's speech text charged
that it is the United States that has
embarked on a new military build
up, which forces the Soviet Union to
keep up. Out of 30 new types of
weapons "threatening destruction to
mankind," he said most have ori
ginated in the West.
He cited a statement by former
Secretary of Defense Robert
McNamara: "In this country we com
monly exaggerate the imbalance be
tween the Warsaw Pact and NATO
forces — we understate ours and ov
erstate theirs."
Bachurov wrote, "It strikes us how
easily the Pentagon planners talk
about the possibility of limited nucle
ar war," and added that documented
evidence exists indicating that the
United States may be planning a first
strike attack on the Soviet Union.
He remarked that while President
Ronald Reagan and Secretary of State
Alexander Haig now seriously talk
about limited nuclear war, the Soviet
Union has proposed that both na
tions sign a statement agreeing not to
make the first nuclear strike. "We
have suggested many times holding
talks toconsider thedismantling of all
nuclear weapons, as the first step in
stopping all production of nuclear
arms," he said.
Denying any malicious intent in re
placing old SS-4 and SS-5 missiles
with new SS-20s, Bachurov said that
while SS-20s can carry three war
heads, their total detonating power is
less and their delivery capacity
diminished.
Bachurov noted that Americans
were irate when the Soviet Union
placed missiles in Cuba, at the re
quest of Fidel Castro, yet expect the
Soviet Union to accept U.S. missiles
on Soviet borders.
Bachurov's speech concluded by
saying, "All of us must understand
that there will never be quiet times
on earth until the United States and
the Soviet Union learn to understand
each other."

Soviet Union to accept U.S. missiles
on Soviet borders.
Bachurov's speech concluded by
saying, "All of us must understand
that there will never be quiet times
on earth until the United States and
the Soviet Union learn to understand
each other."
For the fourth time this year, the
State Department has denied a Soviet
official permission to come to the
Stanford campus.
Soviet Vice Consul Vladimir
Bachurov was scheduled to speak on
the nuclear arms race yesterday af
ternoon at a public forum at Bechtel
International Center.According to a
State Department spokesman,
Bachurov failed to apply for per
mission to make the trip here from
San Francisco two full working days
prior to the event, as is required.
In addition to prohibiting Soviet
scholar Nikolay Umnov from visiting
Stanford earlier this year, the State
Department also refused to allow
Yuri Krapolov of the Soviet embassy
to speak here and denied a repre
sentative of Tass, the Soviet news
agency, permission to attend the
speech here last month by Secretary
of Defense Caspar Weinberger.
Father Joe Frazier, one of the six
campus chaplains who invited
Bachurov to speak here, said, "The
State Department has once more de
cided that what he (Bachurov) has to
say is not for our ears." Frazier added
that before the Reagan adminis
tration took office, he did not have
trouble with the State Department
denying Soviet officials permission to
come to campus.
Because Bachurov was absent,
Frazier himself read the vice consul's
speech to the approximately 150
people who attended the forum.
Addressing common mispercep
tions about the Soviet Union,
Bachurov wrote, "We do not seek
confrontation with the United States
... We truly desire to establish a base
of trust and good will between our
two countries."
Bachurov's text said Americans
hold widespread misconceptions
about the so-called "Soviet military
threat" and u»e the myth of Soviet
aggression to legitimize a larger mili
tary budget and resulting support for
the military-industrial complex.
"If one excludes a nuclear ex
change, which would be suicidal for
everyone, the United States is not in
danger from the Soviet Union,"
Bachurov wrote. He asserted that the

Soviet military doctrine has a de
fensive character and excludes any
first strike proposals. "The Soviet
Union is menacing no one, nor does
it have the intention of threatening
anyone," he wrote.
Bachurov's speech text charged
that it is the United States that has
embarked on a new military build
up, which forces the Soviet Union to
keep up. Out of 30 new types of
weapons "threatening destruction to
mankind," he said most have ori
ginated in the West.
He cited a statement by former
Secretary of Defense Robert
McNamara: "In this country we com
monly exaggerate the imbalance be
tween the Warsaw Pact and NATO
forces — we understate ours and ov
erstate theirs."
Bachurov wrote, "It strikes us how
easily the Pentagon planners talk
about the possibility of limited nucle
ar war," and added that documented
evidence exists indicating that the
United States may be planning a first
strike attack on the Soviet Union.
He remarked that while President
Ronald Reagan and Secretary of State
Alexander Haig now seriously talk
about limited nuclear war, the Soviet
Union has proposed that both na
tions sign a statement agreeing not to
make the first nuclear strike. "We
have suggested many times holding
talks toconsider thedismantling of all
nuclear weapons, as the first step in
stopping all production of nuclear
arms," he said.
Denying any malicious intent in re
placing old SS-4 and SS-5 missiles
with new SS-20s, Bachurov said that
while SS-20s can carry three war
heads, their total detonating power is
less and their delivery capacity
diminished.
Bachurov noted that Americans
were irate when the Soviet Union
placed missiles in Cuba, at the re
quest of Fidel Castro, yet expect the
Soviet Union to accept U.S. missiles
on Soviet borders.
Bachurov's speech concluded by
saying, "All of us must understand
that there will never be quiet times
on earth until the United States and
the Soviet Union learn to understand
each other."
