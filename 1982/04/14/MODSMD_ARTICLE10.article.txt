The model suit
A lawsuit involving an economic model
which can forecast the country's econo
my in five minutes has been filed against
Kent State University, according to the
Daily Kent Stater. Economics Prof.
Vladamir Simunek, developer of the
model, has filed this breach-of-contract
suit as a counterclaim to a suit filed earlier
by the Kent State University Foundation.
The foundation's suit asked the court to
determine what rights the foundation,
the university and Simunek had concern
ing the marketing of the Kent Economic
Model.
The model uses more than 8000 equa
tions and economic indicators, such as
rate of increase of unemployment and
prices. The model is owned by the univer
sity and marketed by the foundation. The
original suit was filed because Simunek
was allegedly marketing the model
without proper authorization. When the
university also sued Simunek for dam
ages, the professor brought his suit
against the university.

The model was developed in the early
70s. Stephen Harrison, Simunek's at
torney, said, "... the perspective of my
client is that the economic forecast model
could conceivably be a great asset to KSU
and, in times of economic troubles, he is
surprised that it is not getting the atten
tion that it should be." Meanwhile, back
at Pennsylvania Avenue...
Ivy spirit
In the first joint statement since the U.S.
invasion of Cambodia in 1970, the editori

al boards of Ivy League newspapers have
criticized the Reagan administration's
policy in El Salvador. Editors from all eight
Institutions drafted a statement in a day
long session at Columbia University last
month, according to The Daily Prince-
Ionian in its March 23 edition. The
statement reads, in part; "President Rea
gan's view of the struggle in El Salvador,
like his entire foreign policy, is built on his
misconception that every complex for
eign policy issue is part of a larger U.S.-So
viet power struggle. It is a policy based on
the notion that military might makes po
litical right, an assumption which will nev
er lead to constructive solutions in El
Salvador. Current American policies will
only prop up a right-wing military that has
prevented the Salvadoran people from
determining their own future."
The statement further urged Americans
to secure a pledge from the Reagan ad
ministration to keep troops and advisers
out of El Salvador, to support current
Congressional resolutions "which point
the way toward withdrawal ofaid," to rec
ognize the elections as "a facade of legit
imacy," and to "participate in grassroots
demonstrations against U.S. policy in El

Salvador." Editorial boards of seven of the
eight Ivy papers had ratified the
statement by March 23. They include: The
Brown Daily Herald, The Cornell Daily
Sun, The Columbia Daily Spectator, The
Harvard Crimson, The Daily Princetonian,
The Daily Pennsylvanian and The Yale
Daily News. The editors of The
Dartmouth had not yet voted on the
statement.
In 1970, five of the newspapers called
for the withdrawal of all American troops
from Southeast Asia. In 1969, all eight Ivy
papers called for the pullout of troops
from Vietnam and supported a two-day
moratorium on attending classes.
Cold Clinic Express
If you think you can diagnose your ill
ness better than professionals at Cowell,
you should fly your sick body to Princeton
where, reports The Daily Princetonian,
the "Cold Clinic Express" will allow stu
dents to examine themselves by following
instructions on a form. McCosh Infirmary
is opening the "Express" to cope with the
annual spring viral onslaught. It will speed
the dispensing of over-the-counter drugs
and reduce the congestion in the out-pa

tient clinic. The student will perform such
tests as taking his temperature and check
ing for swollen glands and a sore throat.
A dormitory heaith aide will help stu
dents and answer questions before the
student recommends which drugs he
thinks he should receive. A clinician will
dispense the drugs after examing the stu
dent's form. The student will be sent to
the regular clinic if his symptoms warrant
futher attention. The director of health
education at Princeton said she hopes the
"Cold Clinic Express" wfil destroy mis
conceptions students have about colds,
the most common one being that an anti
biotic will cure a flu or cold.
Sitting pretty
It's almost as thrilling as the story of the
Beverly Hillbillies! The University of Ala
bama may be able to supply most of its
natural gas needs for the next 20 years due
to the recovery of methane gas from sev
eral natural gas pockets underneath the
campus. According to The Crimson
White, drilling will take place next week,
but it will be six months to a year before
researchers find out the exact prod
uctivity of the well. ]. Read Holland, head

of the university's School of Mines and
Energy Development, said, "After this in
itial study period, if we think it is a suffi
ciently good producing well, we'll buy
the equipment necessary to treat the gas
and hook it up into the university's gas
distribution lines."
He said there is a possibility the univer
sity will sell methane gas to industries in
Tuscaloosa and surrounding counties.
According to Holland, the university
spends about $30,000 per month for natu
ral gas. If the project is successful, he said,
in addition to using the gas for heating
and operation of the university's boiler
plant, university facilities may be con
verted to use this type of gas.
Methane gas recovery is a potential $1
billion plus annual industry for Alabama.
Holland said this project represents "the
first step in a long-term research project
in the development of natural gas re
sources under the campus and around
the state." Holland is optimistic that the
technical difficulties in recovering the
methane from the coal seams which hold
it can be overcome. The American Public
Gas Association is funding the drilling of
the well at an estimated cost of $140,000,
and the university is paying operational
and equipment costs which Holland esti
mated at $95,000 for the first year.
Watch out for the Alabama Hillbillies,
Exxon!
Fender bender
Bent any good fenders lately? Well, ac
cording to john Kuehner, staff writer for
the Daily Kent Stater, minor auto acci
dents may prove to be a good way of
meeting people, especially those of the
opposite sex. Kuehner said the idea never
occurred to him until he got into an acci
dent one snowy morning. Kuehner says
it's easier than approaching someone in
person. All you have to do, he advises, is
pick out someone you want to meet and
when she gets into her car, plow into it. I
wouldn't head for the parking lot just yet,
intelligence Stanford students. You might
be told to hit the road instead of Happy
Hour at LeCumbre!
