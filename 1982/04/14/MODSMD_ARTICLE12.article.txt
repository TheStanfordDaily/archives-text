## Heroism in the White House 
### 
I have figured out just how simple
President Ronald Reagan is. His pre
mise is a great American spirit. If
there is a problem, that great spirit
will just do what needs to be done. I
don't know why that should not be
right. Look at all the problems: kids
growing up crazy and dissolute,
crime everywhere, productivity fall
ing. Why aren't people just up and
doing something about it? Good
question. Reagan knows the answer:
there must be some lid on their great
spirit. And he knows what that lid is:
the government. The government is
not a social choice mechanism — it is
a millstone. That is the only explana
tion for Reagan's refusal to budge on
raising taxes. From any "supply side"
viewpoint a budget deficit is much
more harmful than the taxes to cover
it. But Reagan does not see things in
economic terms. By cutting taxes 25
percent he sees that suffocating lid of
government pulled back that much
from the great American spirit —
enough for it to break free.
Social programs are not an attempt
to know and satisfy the values of a
healthy soviety; they only sour our
natural compassion and are to blame
for all lack of charity. Regulations are
not an attempt to channel the narrow
and sometimes ugly focus on capital
ism; they only bind our great spirit
and with taxes are the cause of all
laziness. Taxes are not the result of
people deciding they want to spend
on public goods; they are the gov
ernment stealing from us under the
premise that it knows better than us
what we want to spend out money on
(an ironic twist). Parks, speed limits,
handgun controls and everything
government crush the great Ameri
can spirit — except saber rattling,
which is invigorating.
Tfcte ftjtorfffltex origins of an increas
ingly selfish morality and the prob

lems faced by everyone at any level
who tries to deal with it all are ig
nored in favor of the one joyfully
simple conception of government
stifling our spirit. I'd be as confident
as Reagan if I saw the world that way.
Confidence is a great quality for a
president to have, but such
phenomenal ignorance is not the
way we want to see it come by.
Some might say that the Reagan
deficit is a tactical ploy to further cut
spending. But Reagan himself has de
clared most of the budget hands off,
and further cuts in descretionary
spending other than defense would
be a Pyrrhic victory. Reagan knows
that much. He is politically astute.
Further, Massachusetts shows well
enough that cutting taxes is not the
way to squeeze waste and corruption
out of the system. Unfortunately,
corruption is the best defended in
terest. "Cutting the fat" requires the
right initiatives from the budget side.
Duress may cut the budget, but it
won't be the fat that goes.
Reagan's simplicity shines through
in other ways as well. If we found out,
for instance, that Nicaragua was
spending 19 million dollars to blow
up our bridges and disrupt our econ
omy we would regard it as tanta
mount to a declaration of war. Yet
while we have such a project in full
swing Reagan chides the
Nicaraguans for only imagining
grounds for worry.
He thinks the Vietnam War not a
civil war at all but an invasion, in
which we were shamed for failing to
carry out our role as world police
man. He apparently does not realize
that the war was the result of the
French trying to reestablish their co
lonial regime after World War 11. Ho
Chi Minh was a popular leader. The
war was not the liberalism of the
south vs. the tyranny of the north. It

was petty French nationalism and sav
ing Catholic souls from the heathens.
Of course the revolutionaries turned
out to be undemocratic. Who ever
heard of a democratic military? But
things might have turned out other
wise. It was the French and then the
United States that forced them to be
militaristic. Ho Chi Minh had asked
for and expected our help. He spoke
to his people from our own Declara
tion of Independence and publicly
proclaimed democracy. What more
could we have asked? Hatred, de
struction and tyranny is our legacy.to
that country. At best the Reagan peo
ple think the war was wrong because
of how we fought it or because it was
unwinable. They have made a con
certed effort to learn absolutely
nothing from our past 20 years of
tragic errors.
The distinction on which foreign
policy is based is still private vs. pub
lic property rather than liberalism vs.
tyranny. I have no doubt Reagan
counts the toppling of Allende as one
of our successes. But if we had not
toppled Allende Chile would proba
bly be another Jamaica right now: a
working democracy instead of a mili
tary dictatorship, and probably capi
talist after tasting too much socialist
inefficiency. The same would proba
bly be true in El Salvador if we had
pressured them into abiding by their
own democratic process. The mili
tary men and the Marcoses, those
who would crush or usurp de
mocracy, are the real enemies of de
mocracy. No populace would choose
a revolutionary dictatorship if it had
the option of a real democracy. Yet
Marcos gets applauded while the
French get chastized.
I tried for a long time to be upbeat
about Reagan. But I guess I lack that
heroic simplicity.

tary dictatorship, and probably capi
talist after tasting too much socialist
inefficiency. The same would proba
bly be true in El Salvador if we had
pressured them into abiding by their
own democratic process. The mili
tary men and the Marcoses, those
who would crush or usurp de
mocracy, are the real enemies of de
mocracy. No populace would choose
a revolutionary dictatorship if it had
the option of a real democracy. Yet
Marcos gets applauded while the
French get chastized.
I tried for a long time to be upbeat
about Reagan. But I guess I lack that
heroic simplicity.
(Alec Rawls is a graduate student in
economics.)
I have figured out just how simple
President Ronald Reagan is. His pre
mise is a great American spirit. If
there is a problem, that great spirit
will just do what needs to be done. I
don't know why that should not be
right. Look at all the problems: kids
growing up crazy and dissolute,
crime everywhere, productivity fall
ing. Why aren't people just up and
doing something about it? Good
question. Reagan knows the answer:
there must be some lid on their great
spirit. And he knows what that lid is:
the government. The government is
not a social choice mechanism — it is
a millstone. That is the only explana
tion for Reagan's refusal to budge on
raising taxes. From any "supply side"
viewpoint a budget deficit is much
more harmful than the taxes to cover
it. But Reagan does not see things in
economic terms. By cutting taxes 25
percent he sees that suffocating lid of
government pulled back that much
from the great American spirit —
enough for it to break free.
Social programs are not an attempt
to know and satisfy the values of a
healthy soviety; they only sour our
natural compassion and are to blame
for all lack of charity. Regulations are
not an attempt to channel the narrow
and sometimes ugly focus on capital
ism; they only bind our great spirit
and with taxes are the cause of all
laziness. Taxes are not the result of
people deciding they want to spend
on public goods; they are the gov
ernment stealing from us under the
premise that it knows better than us
what we want to spend out money on
(an ironic twist). Parks, speed limits,
handgun controls and everything
government crush the great Ameri
can spirit — except saber rattling,
which is invigorating.
Tfcte ftjtorfffltex origins of an increas
ingly selfish morality and the prob

lems faced by everyone at any level
who tries to deal with it all are ig
nored in favor of the one joyfully
simple conception of government
stifling our spirit. I'd be as confident
as Reagan if I saw the world that way.
Confidence is a great quality for a
president to have, but such
phenomenal ignorance is not the
way we want to see it come by.
Some might say that the Reagan
deficit is a tactical ploy to further cut
spending. But Reagan himself has de
clared most of the budget hands off,
and further cuts in descretionary
spending other than defense would
be a Pyrrhic victory. Reagan knows
that much. He is politically astute.
Further, Massachusetts shows well
enough that cutting taxes is not the
way to squeeze waste and corruption
out of the system. Unfortunately,
corruption is the best defended in
terest. "Cutting the fat" requires the
right initiatives from the budget side.
Duress may cut the budget, but it
won't be the fat that goes.
Reagan's simplicity shines through
in other ways as well. If we found out,
for instance, that Nicaragua was
spending 19 million dollars to blow
up our bridges and disrupt our econ
omy we would regard it as tanta
mount to a declaration of war. Yet
while we have such a project in full
swing Reagan chides the
Nicaraguans for only imagining
grounds for worry.
He thinks the Vietnam War not a
civil war at all but an invasion, in
which we were shamed for failing to
carry out our role as world police
man. He apparently does not realize
that the war was the result of the
French trying to reestablish their co
lonial regime after World War 11. Ho
Chi Minh was a popular leader. The
war was not the liberalism of the
south vs. the tyranny of the north. It

was petty French nationalism and sav
ing Catholic souls from the heathens.
Of course the revolutionaries turned
out to be undemocratic. Who ever
heard of a democratic military? But
things might have turned out other
wise. It was the French and then the
United States that forced them to be
militaristic. Ho Chi Minh had asked
for and expected our help. He spoke
to his people from our own Declara
tion of Independence and publicly
proclaimed democracy. What more
could we have asked? Hatred, de
struction and tyranny is our legacy.to
that country. At best the Reagan peo
ple think the war was wrong because
of how we fought it or because it was
unwinable. They have made a con
certed effort to learn absolutely
nothing from our past 20 years of
tragic errors.
The distinction on which foreign
policy is based is still private vs. pub
lic property rather than liberalism vs.
tyranny. I have no doubt Reagan
counts the toppling of Allende as one
of our successes. But if we had not
toppled Allende Chile would proba
bly be another Jamaica right now: a
working democracy instead of a mili
tary dictatorship, and probably capi
