# Single usefulness of a Watt
## 
### 
Among the crop of petitions responding to Reaganist
outrages, there's at least one making the rounds without
my signature. It calls for the firing of Interior Secretary
James Watt. I don't think that's a cause that environmen
tally concerned people should push while we're stuck
with this administration.
While Watt is not exactly the natural planet's
friend, he is its greatest asset in the Reagan government.
No one in power shakes people awake as reliably as he
does. Every time he unloads another Watticism, you can
almost hear the sound of mouths dropping open all over
the country. When he publicly divides the population
into two subsets, "liberals" and "Americans," thousands
of people find out that, as much as they'd like to, they
can't keep silent. And these are people with years and
years of experience at keeping silent. Some of them vis
ited Yosemite last year, and when they hear Watt talking
about paving half the place over they wonder if anyplace
will be left for next year's vacation. They get a pure
glimpse, perhaps their first, of Reaganism.
When Watt took office, Friends of the Earth had
21,000 members. Today it has 30,000. The Sierra Club's
roster has grown from 195,000 to 290,000 in the same pe
riod. The man is a greater environmental organizer than
David Brower, Pearl Buck, Barry Commoner and
Woodsy the Owl put togther. We would miss him sorely,
I think, if the push to have him canned succeeded.
There is no intentional cynicism or radical posturing in
this argument. I want to distinguish it from another theo
ry that is chic in some circles: serious progressives, I've
heard it said, should vote for Ronald Reagans over Jimmy
Carters because the Reagans of the world amplify the
system's contradictions and hasten its glorious downfall.
This line of reasoning, generally promoted by well-fed
university dwellers, leaves me cold. And it probably
wouldn't thrill the kids who just lost their only hot meal
of the day when school lunch subsidies disappeared, or
the Salvadorans who are dying in the shadow of Ameri
can Huey helicopters. Reagan's presidency is decisively
more expensive in human suffering than Carter's would
have been.
But Watt's tenure costs us no more, not one
added ecological penny, than his successor's would. The
man or woman picked to replace Watt would be at least
as dedicated as he to the maximum exploration of the
American earth. To believe anything else, you would
have to doubt Reagan's commitment to corporate profit,
capital expansion and military growth. You would have
to ignore a lot of evidence.
A new Interior Secretary would follow current policies
(which aren't, after all, Watt's creations — he just works
there) without alerting us to them as Watt does. Reagan,

once burned, would pick a gray, bland bureaucrat for
the job, someone fluent in double-speak, which Watt
speaks only haltingly. The new secretary would have
none of Watt's taste for public dueling, none of his gusty, .
gleeful malice. Another secretary would get on with the
business of trashing the country without making a party -;
out of it, much as the EPA's Anne Gorsuch and Energy's
James Edwards have quietly ransacked their respective
agencies. And many of those new Sierra Clubbers would r
forget to renew their memberships next year.
The spotlight that Watt has drawn to environmental is- 4
sues would linger for a while after he left the stage. Strip
mining, off-shore drilling and National Park com
mercialization would still fuel public debate. But after a
few weeks or months, the media's attention would begin
to drift. The national media are still far more interested ir>
personalities than issues, and Watt's value to us lies in the
way he links one to the other. Without a james Watt to
give these issues a People magazine format, they would
sink deeper and deeper into the back pages of news-.
papers and the back corners of the national concious
ness.
That might happen even if Watt stays in office. The last
headlines that he generated suggest that he may be los
ing his publicity value, that he's learning to talk like his
pals around the cabinet table. He came on strong for a ,
"Wilderness Protection Bill" that would close estab
lished Wilderness Areas to mineral exploration until the
year 2000. He neglected to mention that it would alsoov-'
erturn an existing law that unconditionally protects
those areas forever.
Now, that's the kind of snow job you'd expect'ftom a
man in Watt's position, and it worries me'. If makes me '
think that the bosses are shortening his leash; if I were
one of them, I would have done it months ago. And the
petition campaign can only speed up the process.
At the same time I see one solid benefit in this cam
paign. In signing the petition, some people are making'
the first explicitly political statement of their lives. The' ,
act itself is transforming. Some who have said "I'm not a
political person" 500 times over may never say no again.
Petitions will seem progressively easier to sign, organiza
tions easier to join. Raw deals will seem progressively
harder to tolerate. Some of the people thus awoken will
still be awake when Watt is just a bad and funny memory.
That's an enormous step in the direction of a saner so
ciety. But we can make it without stalking Watt directly.
We can encourage people to make this transforming
plunge through petitions that address the policies that
Watt announces rather than his personal grinning idiocy.
Watt's style works in our favor to the extent that it gener
ates popular anger; it works in his favor, and his bosses',
to the extent that we make it the target of that anger.
The Dump Watt drive makes the classic error of con
fusing the message and the messenger. To our great
good fortune, James Watt has drawn much more atten
tion than necessary to his unacceptable message. We
don't have to thank him for it. We do have to recognize
that, for the time being, we need his help.

heard it said, should vote for Ronald Reagans over Jimmy
Carters because the Reagans of the world amplify the
system's contradictions and hasten its glorious downfall.
This line of reasoning, generally promoted by well-fed
university dwellers, leaves me cold. And it probably
wouldn't thrill the kids who just lost their only hot meal
of the day when school lunch subsidies disappeared, or
the Salvadorans who are dying in the shadow of Ameri
can Huey helicopters. Reagan's presidency is decisively
more expensive in human suffering than Carter's would
have been.
But Watt's tenure costs us no more, not one
added ecological penny, than his successor's would. The
man or woman picked to replace Watt would be at least
as dedicated as he to the maximum exploration of the
American earth. To believe anything else, you would
have to doubt Reagan's commitment to corporate profit,
capital expansion and military growth. You would have
to ignore a lot of evidence.
A new Interior Secretary would follow current policies
(which aren't, after all, Watt's creations — he just works
there) without alerting us to them as Watt does. Reagan,

once burned, would pick a gray, bland bureaucrat for
the job, someone fluent in double-speak, which Watt
speaks only haltingly. The new secretary would have
none of Watt's taste for public dueling, none of his gusty, .
gleeful malice. Another secretary would get on with the
business of trashing the country without making a party -;
out of it, much as the EPA's Anne Gorsuch and Energy's
James Edwards have quietly ransacked their respective
agencies. And many of those new Sierra Clubbers would r
forget to renew their memberships next year.
The spotlight that Watt has drawn to environmental is- 4
sues would linger for a while after he left the stage. Strip
mining, off-shore drilling and National Park com
mercialization would still fuel public debate. But after a
few weeks or months, the media's attention would begin
to drift. The national media are still far more interested ir>
personalities than issues, and Watt's value to us lies in the
way he links one to the other. Without a james Watt to
give these issues a People magazine format, they would
sink deeper and deeper into the back pages of news-.
papers and the back corners of the national concious
ness.
That might happen even if Watt stays in office. The last
headlines that he generated suggest that he may be los
ing his publicity value, that he's learning to talk like his
pals around the cabinet table. He came on strong for a ,
"Wilderness Protection Bill" that would close estab
lished Wilderness Areas to mineral exploration until the
year 2000. He neglected to mention that it would alsoov-'
erturn an existing law that unconditionally protects
those areas forever.
Now, that's the kind of snow job you'd expect'ftom a
man in Watt's position, and it worries me'. If makes me '
think that the bosses are shortening his leash; if I were
one of them, I would have done it months ago. And the
petition campaign can only speed up the process.
At the same time I see one solid benefit in this cam
paign. In signing the petition, some people are making'
the first explicitly political statement of their lives. The' ,
act itself is transforming. Some who have said "I'm not a
political person" 500 times over may never say no again.
Petitions will seem progressively easier to sign, organiza
tions easier to join. Raw deals will seem progressively
harder to tolerate. Some of the people thus awoken will
still be awake when Watt is just a bad and funny memory.
That's an enormous step in the direction of a saner so
ciety. But we can make it without stalking Watt directly.
We can encourage people to make this transforming
plunge through petitions that address the policies that
Watt announces rather than his personal grinning idiocy.
Watt's style works in our favor to the extent that it gener
ates popular anger; it works in his favor, and his bosses',
to the extent that we make it the target of that anger.
The Dump Watt drive makes the classic error of con
fusing the message and the messenger. To our great
good fortune, James Watt has drawn much more atten
tion than necessary to his unacceptable message. We
don't have to thank him for it. We do have to recognize
that, for the time being, we need his help.

Among the crop of petitions responding to Reaganist
outrages, there's at least one making the rounds without
my signature. It calls for the firing of Interior Secretary
James Watt. I don't think that's a cause that environmen
tally concerned people should push while we're stuck
with this administration.
While Watt is not exactly the natural planet's
friend, he is its greatest asset in the Reagan government.
No one in power shakes people awake as reliably as he
does. Every time he unloads another Watticism, you can
almost hear the sound of mouths dropping open all over
the country. When he publicly divides the population
into two subsets, "liberals" and "Americans," thousands
of people find out that, as much as they'd like to, they
can't keep silent. And these are people with years and
years of experience at keeping silent. Some of them vis
ited Yosemite last year, and when they hear Watt talking
about paving half the place over they wonder if anyplace
will be left for next year's vacation. They get a pure
glimpse, perhaps their first, of Reaganism.
When Watt took office, Friends of the Earth had
21,000 members. Today it has 30,000. The Sierra Club's
roster has grown from 195,000 to 290,000 in the same pe
riod. The man is a greater environmental organizer than
David Brower, Pearl Buck, Barry Commoner and
Woodsy the Owl put togther. We would miss him sorely,
I think, if the push to have him canned succeeded.
There is no intentional cynicism or radical posturing in
this argument. I want to distinguish it from another theo
ry that is chic in some circles: serious progressives, I've
heard it said, should vote for Ronald Reagans over Jimmy
Carters because the Reagans of the world amplify the
system's contradictions and hasten its glorious downfall.
