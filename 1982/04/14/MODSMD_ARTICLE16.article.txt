## Soviet'fishing' near the Straits of Magellan 
### 
The British dispute with Argentina
over the Falkland Islands is discussed
in terms of the legality of the respec
tive claims, with an occasional refer
ence to the possibility of finding oil
there. There is a more serious issue:
the role of the Soviet Union in the
South Atlantic.
Argentina plays a special role in So
viet grand strategy. This was evident
to me when I was lecturing at the So
viet Academy of Sciences a dozen
years ago. I was accompanied around
the Soviet Union by a member of the
Academy whose special area of re
search was Argentina and especially
its trade. He hated the United States
with a doctrinaire hatred, and he was
undoubtedly a cog in the machine
preparing the promotion of Argen
tine-Soviet relations, taking advan
tage of the traditional hatred of the
United States in Argentina. The Sovi
et Union is now Argentina's main
trading partner.
Trade was simply the first step in a
political rapprochement with Argen
tina. As editor of the World Affairs
Report, I have to read Soviet sources
with great care. A basic fact about So
viet relations with Latin America is
that, whereas the Soviet media attack
dictatorships like that of Chile un
mercifully, there is never a word of
criticism of the most bloody of the
lot, namely that of Argentina. Thus
has arisen a situation in which the
United States and China support
Chile against the colossus of the East,

namely Argentina, which is sup
ported by the Soviet Union.
The United States has been trying
for years to persuade Argentina to
join a proposed SATO, South Atlantic
Treaty Organization, which would
parallel NATO. President Leopoldo
Galtieri tried to convince the United
States that Argentina was abandon
ing its anti-U.S. stance, but that was
just a device to soften up Washington
in preparation for the attack on the
Falklands.
If Argentina gets away with its use
of military force despite the U.N. res
olution, it will be encouraged to take
action against Chile, with which it is
involved in a dispute concerning
three islands in the Beagle Channel,
and to assert its claim to a slice of Ant
arctica. All around the world coun
tries with territorial claims would feel
that they could act with impunity.
Worst still, the U.S. plan for SATO
would be sunk, and the Soviet Union
would enjoy "fishing" rights in is
lands controlling the entrance to the
Straits of Magellan and the route
around Cap Horn,
Chile controls the entrance to the
Straits of Magellan, from Cabo Vir
genes on the mainland and the top of
Tierra del Fuego. Realizing that it
may be next, Chile may allow British
forces to use a base there. This would
facilitate the task of making Argen
tina withdraw from the Falklands. If
not, aggression would be seen as a
viable choke around the world, thus

perhaps triggering World War 111.

An effective Council of Presidents
must be able to listen well, interact
constructively with all members of
the Stanford Community, and take
thoughtful, informed action.
The Cooper-Carrillo-Lighty-
Wilson slate for COP would bring to
the ASSU experience in ASSU com
mittees and task forces, as well as ex
perience working with ASSU boards,
bureaus and projects.
In addition to that "hands on" ex
perience within ASSU, we bring to
the COP a broad-based, com
prehensive understanding of Univer
sity-wide issues and operations. We
are already involved in issues of im
portance to Stanford including finan
cial aid, minority admissions and pro
gram support, theme houses, per
sonal safety, the reorganization of
ODUS and University/industrial re
lations. We have worked with Uni
versity administrators on many of
those issue? and have developed a
reasonable, non-confrontational ap
proach to problem-solving.

viet grand strategy. This was evident
to me when I was lecturing at the So
viet Academy of Sciences a dozen
years ago. I was accompanied around
the Soviet Union by a member of the
Academy whose special area of re
search was Argentina and especially
its trade. He hated the United States
with a doctrinaire hatred, and he was
undoubtedly a cog in the machine
preparing the promotion of Argen
tine-Soviet relations, taking advan
tage of the traditional hatred of the
United States in Argentina. The Sovi
et Union is now Argentina's main
trading partner.
Trade was simply the first step in a
political rapprochement with Argen
tina. As editor of the World Affairs
Report, I have to read Soviet sources
with great care. A basic fact about So
viet relations with Latin America is
that, whereas the Soviet media attack
dictatorships like that of Chile un
mercifully, there is never a word of
criticism of the most bloody of the
lot, namely that of Argentina. Thus
has arisen a situation in which the
United States and China support
Chile against the colossus of the East,

namely Argentina, which is sup
ported by the Soviet Union.
The United States has been trying
for years to persuade Argentina to
join a proposed SATO, South Atlantic
Treaty Organization, which would
parallel NATO. President Leopoldo
Galtieri tried to convince the United
States that Argentina was abandon
ing its anti-U.S. stance, but that was
just a device to soften up Washington
in preparation for the attack on the
Falklands.
If Argentina gets away with its use
of military force despite the U.N. res
olution, it will be encouraged to take
action against Chile, with which it is
involved in a dispute concerning
three islands in the Beagle Channel,
and to assert its claim to a slice of Ant
arctica. All around the world coun
tries with territorial claims would feel
that they could act with impunity.
Worst still, the U.S. plan for SATO
would be sunk, and the Soviet Union
would enjoy "fishing" rights in is
lands controlling the entrance to the
Straits of Magellan and the route
around Cap Horn,
Chile controls the entrance to the
Straits of Magellan, from Cabo Vir
genes on the mainland and the top of
Tierra del Fuego. Realizing that it
may be next, Chile may allow British
forces to use a base there. This would
facilitate the task of making Argen
tina withdraw from the Falklands. If
not, aggression would be seen as a
viable choke around the world, thus

perhaps triggering World War 111.

Lighty slate for COP
An effective Council of Presidents
must be able to listen well, interact
constructively with all members of
the Stanford Community, and take
thoughtful, informed action.
The Cooper-Carrillo-Lighty-
Wilson slate for COP would bring to
the ASSU experience in ASSU com
mittees and task forces, as well as ex
perience working with ASSU boards,
bureaus and projects.
In addition to that "hands on" ex
perience within ASSU, we bring to
the COP a broad-based, com
prehensive understanding of Univer
sity-wide issues and operations. We
are already involved in issues of im
portance to Stanford including finan
cial aid, minority admissions and pro
gram support, theme houses, per
sonal safety, the reorganization of
ODUS and University/industrial re
lations. We have worked with Uni
versity administrators on many of
those issue? and have developed a
reasonable, non-confrontational ap
proach to problem-solving.
Robin Cooper is a coordinator of
the Rape Education Project and has
worked for two years with the Blyth
Fund. Eloisa Carrillo co-coordinates
the El Centro Chicano. Mike Lighty is

the co-chair of the SWOPSI and
Doris Wilson is the co-chair or the
Black Student Union.
It is our substantive experience
with important programs and issues
that makes our platform more than a
grab-bag of political candy. We have
the desire and ability to make the
COP a functioning and cohesive
council.Thank you for your con
sideration.
