## Letter Pursuing peace 
### 
There is a notion running around
th£ hallowed halls of the University
that could kill you. This notion sug
gests that peace is extracurricular.
"For those of you who are not in
vestigating the best pizza place and
would rather not frequent frat
parties, you can always spend a few
hours checking out the Nuclear Arms
Race."
A group of approximately 10 to 15
people, including staff, faculty and
students, has been meeting since No
vember to plan strategies for dispell
ing this dangerous notion. Known as
thfe Peace Studies Task Force, we are
working to bring peace into the
clissroom. One of the difficulties we
haVe experienced from the start is
defining peace and what it means to
study peace. Flowers and banners
as[de, there is a gross discrepancy be
tween the impact of those who study
war and those who study peace. Talk
of limited nuclear wars is becoming
commonplace, lulling us into a sense
powerlessness.
Is peace simply the absence of war?
Where does active, non-violent re
sistance fit in? What is the connection
between structural violence and
Third World oppression? Similarly,
vague questions arise when you look
at the academic arena. Should peace
studies eventually be a separate de
partment, or is it clearly in
terdisciplinary? Do you begin by of
fering frosh and sophomore semi
nars or do you talk to professors first?
As a fledgling group, we have had to
discuss, decide and then change our
decision as we encounter barriers to
injroducing this vital issue into your
Stanford education. As long as we
practice "psychicnumbing," as long
as we characterise peacemakers as
'60s burnouts and hippies, we fail to
confront our responsibility as indi
viduals and as a nation. The anti-es
tablishment types are really those
who continue to support the
diture of one million dollars a minute
ort supposedly never-to-be-used
bombs.
The Peace Studies Task Force is
committed to making peace a live fs
sue on this campus. We have begun
to identify the many resources at
Stanford and t||?%irr6unding com
munity and tfflgfogthen their impact
on the decision makers at Stanford
and in the nation. We are alsd collect
ing data from Peace Studies pro
grams already in existence in the
United States, and we hope to make
this information available to in
terested faculty, staff and students.
We hope to encowlge you to pursue
those unanswered quest!ons,\?lfbse
questions that must be addr&sfcsMo
ensure our future — your future, the
one that is so important you won't
take time away from it to study peace.
