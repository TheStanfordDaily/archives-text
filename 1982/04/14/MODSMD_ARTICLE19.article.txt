# Nuclear Arms in the '80s
## Viewpoint/Eric Doub Phasing out nuclear, in renewables 
### 
Although you may doubt that such
a thing exists, you are about to read a
column on nuclear weapons pro
liferation that isn't all gloom and
doom. But first, for those who
haven't heard the bad news, I can
take care of that in a few lines.
According to World Social and Mil
itary Expenditures 1981, "the two
city-destroying bombs of 1945 have
developed into a global nightmare of
50,000 nuclear weapons, equivalent
in explosive power to a million
Hiroshima bombs." These bombs are
shared among the members of the
"nuclear club": the United States,
the Soviet Union, France, Britain and
China. States widely accepted to
have the bombs are Israel, South
Africa and India, who detonated a
bomb in 1974. Those on the
threshold include Pakistan, Argen
tina, Taiwan and maybe Brazil. Coun
tries with the capability of going nu
clear are simply too numerous to list.
Name a country, they could probably
do it, and many within mere weeks or
months: the bad news is indeed bad.
That's all the race-to-extinction
talk I want to depress you with. Such
talk can help inform a vital public de
bate; but beyond debate, what of ac
tion? It is not naive to think we can do
something. Let me briefly outline
three U.S. initiatives that could trig
ger an alternative world approach to
stopping horizontal prolieration (i.e.,
from state to state), suggestions I
draw mainly from a 1981 book
Energy/War: Breaking the Nuclear
Link; a Prescription for Nonprolifera
tion. Generalizations made here are
thoroughly documented by this
book and its abundant references.
Although stopping the spread of
nuclear weapons will require a
massive global effort, the United
States can help by vigorously pursu
ing three policy objectives: phasing
out its commercial nuclear power
programs; making increased energy
efficiency and renewable sources its
national energy strategy in word and
in deed; and tackling the slower
process of nuclear arms reductions.
By phasing out nuclear power and
redirecting the industry toward effi
ciency and renewables, the United
States would work for nonprolifera
tion aims in at least three ways. (That
this U.S. policy offers potential bene
fits rests on the analysis that nuclear

power is the main force behind
weapons proliferation: it produces
nuclear materials easily made bomb
grade, and the competition for nu
clear business spreads the knowl
edge and technologies needed to
convert common materials into
bomb-grade ones.)
First, phasing out nuclear power in
the United States would topple nu
clear industries in other countries
that export proliferative technolo
gies. It would severely weaken those
industries' small but necessary
margin of domestic political support
and make inoperable subsidiaries to
U.S. companies that currently export
routes to bombs. Second, countries
engaging in any nuclear activities
could no longer use the "peaceful
atom" excuse because energy needs
are met by non-nuclear means.
Third, not producing more weapons
potential material via nuclear power
is necessary to make the currently in
adequate safeguard system work
able.
By making efficiency and re
newables its national energy orien
tation in word and in deed and help
ing other countries gain energy se
curity, the United States would meet
its 1968 Nonproliferation Treaty
(NPT) obligations — our neglect of
which has helped make non-nuclear
nations both edgy and near-nuclear.
Consisting of increased energy effi
ciency and renewable supplies like
solar, hydro, wind and biomass, this
"soft" energy path has the ability to
satisfy long-term energy needs of ev
ery country hitherto studied, includ
ing Japan, the United States, Great
Britain, France and West Germany.
By offering energy aid to nuclear
threshold nations, the United States
could use the soft path's potential for
economic prosperity and national se
curity to distract countries like Paki
stan from their quest for weapons.
Thus, instead of threatening pun
ishment if bombs are pursued, the
United States would encourage bet
ter behavior by a system of rewards.
The global urgency of displacing oil
and uranium justiffe* some soft of in
ternational financing scheme for effi
ciency and renewables, such as the
proposed Fund for Renewable
Energy Enterprise based on a tax of
arsenal megatonnage or oil produc
tion' •

The final and crucial way that the
United States could help non-pro
liferation is to create a psychological
climate of de-nuclearization by
deglamourizing the ownership of
nuclear weapons. The United States'
bad example is probably largely to
blame for the multitude of nuclear
aspirants we see today. Only by ex
pressing its shame for having bombs
and its desire for redemption can the
United States wield the necessary
moral authority to keep nations on
the brink from stepping into the nu
clear abyss. Furthermore, non-nucle
ar states are clamoring for the super
powers to start addressing their NPT
agreement to disarm, while other
near-nuclear states are in effect
threatening to go nuclear unless seri
ous disarmament measures are soon
enacted. Examples of some initial,
tension-reducing disarmament steps
include no-first-use pledges, a halt to
further deployment of launchers and
missiles and a Comprehensive Test

Ban Treaty.
These three U.S. policies, designed
to catalyze world efforts toward stop
ping the spread of nuclear weapons,
would not only address other world
crises such as oil-driven inflation,
high PG&E bills, unemployment and
hunger but are now necessary to pre
vent the imminent all-nuclear world.
From government officials and cor
porate executives, the situation begs
immediate action. For superpower
citizens, however, it may be difficult
to accept that we are all decision
makers in the world's future. Taking
part in global nonproliferation ef
forts will demand courage — proba
bly a new faith in the species. But the
world awaits such faith. No one can
claim that the strategy outlined here
will succeed entirely or work exactly
as planned, but it will doubtless be
better than our current race toward
making the unthinkable a certainty.

tina, Taiwan and maybe Brazil. Coun
tries with the capability of going nu
clear are simply too numerous to list.
Name a country, they could probably
do it, and many within mere weeks or
months: the bad news is indeed bad.
That's all the race-to-extinction
talk I want to depress you with. Such
talk can help inform a vital public de
bate; but beyond debate, what of ac
tion? It is not naive to think we can do
something. Let me briefly outline
three U.S. initiatives that could trig
ger an alternative world approach to
stopping horizontal prolieration (i.e.,
from state to state), suggestions I
draw mainly from a 1981 book
Energy/War: Breaking the Nuclear
Link; a Prescription for Nonprolifera
tion. Generalizations made here are
thoroughly documented by this
book and its abundant references.
Although stopping the spread of
nuclear weapons will require a
massive global effort, the United
States can help by vigorously pursu
ing three policy objectives: phasing
out its commercial nuclear power
programs; making increased energy
efficiency and renewable sources its
national energy strategy in word and
in deed; and tackling the slower
process of nuclear arms reductions.
By phasing out nuclear power and
redirecting the industry toward effi
ciency and renewables, the United
States would work for nonprolifera
tion aims in at least three ways. (That
this U.S. policy offers potential bene
fits rests on the analysis that nuclear

power is the main force behind
weapons proliferation: it produces
nuclear materials easily made bomb
grade, and the competition for nu
clear business spreads the knowl
edge and technologies needed to
convert common materials into
bomb-grade ones.)
First, phasing out nuclear power in
the United States would topple nu
clear industries in other countries
that export proliferative technolo
gies. It would severely weaken those
industries' small but necessary
margin of domestic political support
and make inoperable subsidiaries to
U.S. companies that currently export
routes to bombs. Second, countries
engaging in any nuclear activities
could no longer use the "peaceful
atom" excuse because energy needs
are met by non-nuclear means.
Third, not producing more weapons
potential material via nuclear power
is necessary to make the currently in
adequate safeguard system work
able.
By making efficiency and re
newables its national energy orien
tation in word and in deed and help
ing other countries gain energy se
curity, the United States would meet
its 1968 Nonproliferation Treaty
(NPT) obligations — our neglect of
which has helped make non-nuclear
nations both edgy and near-nuclear.
Consisting of increased energy effi
ciency and renewable supplies like
solar, hydro, wind and biomass, this
"soft" energy path has the ability to
satisfy long-term energy needs of ev
ery country hitherto studied, includ
ing Japan, the United States, Great
Britain, France and West Germany.
By offering energy aid to nuclear
threshold nations, the United States
could use the soft path's potential for
economic prosperity and national se
curity to distract countries like Paki
stan from their quest for weapons.
Thus, instead of threatening pun
ishment if bombs are pursued, the
United States would encourage bet
ter behavior by a system of rewards.
The global urgency of displacing oil
and uranium justiffe* some soft of in
ternational financing scheme for effi
ciency and renewables, such as the
proposed Fund for Renewable
Energy Enterprise based on a tax of
arsenal megatonnage or oil produc
tion' •

The final and crucial way that the
United States could help non-pro
liferation is to create a psychological
climate of de-nuclearization by
deglamourizing the ownership of
nuclear weapons. The United States'
bad example is probably largely to
blame for the multitude of nuclear
aspirants we see today. Only by ex
pressing its shame for having bombs
and its desire for redemption can the
United States wield the necessary
moral authority to keep nations on
the brink from stepping into the nu
clear abyss. Furthermore, non-nucle
ar states are clamoring for the super
powers to start addressing their NPT
agreement to disarm, while other
near-nuclear states are in effect
threatening to go nuclear unless seri
ous disarmament measures are soon
enacted. Examples of some initial,
tension-reducing disarmament steps
include no-first-use pledges, a halt to
further deployment of launchers and
missiles and a Comprehensive Test

Ban Treaty.
These three U.S. policies, designed
to catalyze world efforts toward stop
ping the spread of nuclear weapons,
would not only address other world
crises such as oil-driven inflation,
high PG&E bills, unemployment and
hunger but are now necessary to pre
vent the imminent all-nuclear world.
From government officials and cor
porate executives, the situation begs
immediate action. For superpower
citizens, however, it may be difficult
to accept that we are all decision
makers in the world's future. Taking
part in global nonproliferation ef
forts will demand courage — proba
bly a new faith in the species. But the
world awaits such faith. No one can
claim that the strategy outlined here
will succeed entirely or work exactly
as planned, but it will doubtless be
better than our current race toward
making the unthinkable a certainty.

Although you may doubt that such
a thing exists, you are about to read a
column on nuclear weapons pro
liferation that isn't all gloom and
doom. But first, for those who
haven't heard the bad news, I can
take care of that in a few lines.
According to World Social and Mil
itary Expenditures 1981, "the two
city-destroying bombs of 1945 have
developed into a global nightmare of
50,000 nuclear weapons, equivalent
in explosive power to a million
Hiroshima bombs." These bombs are
shared among the members of the
"nuclear club": the United States,
the Soviet Union, France, Britain and
China. States widely accepted to
have the bombs are Israel, South
Africa and India, who detonated a
bomb in 1974. Those on the
threshold include Pakistan, Argen
tina, Taiwan and maybe Brazil. Coun
tries with the capability of going nu
