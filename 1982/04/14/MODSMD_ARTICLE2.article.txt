Falkland talks at standoff
Buenoi Aires — Argentine officials yesterday said they remained
hopeful that a U.S. effort to defuse their confrontation with Britain over
the Falkland Islands would continue despite what appeared to be a
standoff between British and Argentine officials over several key nego
tiating issues.
Knowledgeable Argentine sources said the government had rejected
a formula for resolving the crisis because it involved British participation
in a temporary administration for the islands.
Argentina has been willing to agree to a multinational administration
for the disputed archipelago while negotiations were initiated, the
sources said, but has rejected British participation in the body while in
sisting on an Argentine representative.
Argentina has launched a new diplomatic initiative by telling the U.N.
Security Council that it would withdraw its troops from the islands when
Britain recalled the naval fleet headed for the South Atlantic and
stopped trying to "sanction a return to the previous colonial situation"
on the territory.
The Argentine communication to the Security Council represented
Argentina's first formal response to a U.N. resolution calling for a with
drawal of Argentine troops as a prelude to a negotiated settlement.
As the threat of war and an economic boycott of Argentina continued
to take its toll on an already-stricken economy here, however, officials
announced early yesterday morning that they had suspended Argen
tine imports from the European Community nations in retaliation for
similar measures taken against Argentina Sunday.
Long lines formed in front of Buenos Aires' banks yester
day as nervous depositors withdrew an estimated $2.5 mil
lion in savings in reaction to the worsening diplomatic and
economic situation.
Interest rates, pushed by the flight of capital, have soared
to around 200 percent for short-term private loans here in
the past week, according to reports, and the central bank has
suspended most foreign payments while attempting to ease
the economic crunch with special subsidized interest rates.
Moderates excluded from govt.
San Salvador — Christian Democratic leaders announced
yesterday that a coalition of right-wing parties had offered
them only two Cabinet posts in the country's new govern
ment and that they had rejected the deal.
In their first public comments since private talks began
among the parties last week, the Christian Democrats ac
cused their rightist adversaries of everything from "attempt
ing a legal coup d'etat" to threatening to kill newly elected
Christian Democrats.
The comments, which came at a press conference, marked
an escalation in a two-week-old battle for control of the new
government — a battle that involves not only the political
parties, but the United States and El Salvador's powerful mili
tary establishment here as well.
The power struggle began shortly after the March 28 elec
tions that produced a 60-member constituent assembly. The
assembly is scheduled to convene within the next two weeks
to begin the task of designing a new government to replace
the present civilian-military junta.
The Christian Democrats won more seats than any other
party in the assembly — 24 — but not enough to form a ma
jority against the combined total of right-wing opposition.
In theory, then, the rightists have the votes to declare
whatever sort of government they choose. However, be
cause a right-wing government may not be acceptable to the
U.S. Congress, which has debated ending military and eco
nomic aid to El Salvador, the Christian Democrats so far have
retained enough power to block foundation of a new gov
ernment.
Asked why they chose to publicize such criticism now,
Prendes, a key Christian Democratic negotiator, acknowl
edged yesterday that party officials made their remarks pub
lic in an attempt to gain support from both the public and the
military.

"The armed forces don't really understand the seriousness
of this situation yet," he said. "We have approached them
informally, but they say they are reluctant to enter politics.
We just want to give them a pleasant but clear message that
they ought to explain the situation to the right wing parties."
Haig's mission on the rocks
Washington — Secretary of State Alexander Haig arrived in
Washington last night after a tense and confusing day that at
one point saw his efforts to avert open military confrontation
between Britain and Argentina come close to collapse.
He is expected to continue his shuttle diplomacy with a
new trip to Buenos Aires after the Washington stopover, but
no date was announced for the next round of talks.
After a day of telephone calls to Argentine officials in Bue
nos Aires and meetings with British government leaders
here, Haig obtained new proposals from Argentina that he
and the British believed could at least allow negotiations to
continue, the sources said.
Haig, while saying he would not describe himself "as dis
appointed or anything else," called the situation "dangerous
and increasingly so, and therefore there is a great urgency in
finding a political solution."
Asked when he might go back to Buenos Aires, Haig said,
"It's too early to say. It will be done when we've had a chance
to look at these ideas." He would not say whether he was op
timistic or pessimistic about the negotiations.
Violence escalates in Gaza
Jerusalem — Israeli troops opened fire on Arab demonstrat
ors in the Gaza Strip yesterday, killing a 7-year-old boy and
wounding at least 17 other persons as furious protests against
an Israeli soldier's shooting rampage in a Jerusalem mosque
continued to sweep the occupied territories.
In the center of Gaza town, six more Palestinians were shot
when Israeli troops opened fire on a rock-throwing crowd.
In a marked escalation of the violence, Palestinian youths
tried to break into an army base near a Gaza Strip refugee
camp, and were driven back in a fusillade of gunfire that left
21 protesters injured, 11 of them with gunshot wounds. Four
Israeli soldiers were injured, one seriously, by rocks thrown
in the melee.
Gaza Mayor Rashid Shawa said it was the worst day of
Arab-Israeli clashes in the territory since the riots of 1971-72,
when the Israeli army bulldozed large sections of Palestinian
refugee camps in an effort to curb a wave of attacks against

Israeli troops.
Haig, Kissinger charged with wiretaps
Washington — An article in the Atlantic Monthly published
yesterday provides new details on how Henry Kissinger and
Alexander Haig, while serving in the Nixon White House a
decade ago, participated in a two-year effort to conceal a se
cret program of wiretapping aides and reporters.
The article, by Seymour Hersh, who won a Pulitzer Prize in
1970 for his story on the My Lai massacre in Vietnam, is based
on unpublished files from the Watergate prosecutor's office
and statements from former Kissinger aides that describe in
new detail an intensive effort by the White House to hide the
files and logs on the 17 wiretaps from government in
vestigators and the public.
Hersh does not prove that Kissinger or Haig did anything
illegal, but he claims that Kissinger and Haig lied or distorted
their involvement in the wiretap program authorized by
President Richard Nixon from 1969 to 1971.
Hersh notes that the Watergate prosecutor's office
brought no charges against anyone in the wiretap matter af
ter an extensive investigation.
The article gives a detailed portrait of one of the most ex
traordinary periods in American foreign policy. Kissinger,
then Nixon's national security adviser, and Haig, who as No.
2 on the National Security Council staff managed the Viet
nam war, elbowed colleagues and each other for power, ac
cording to Hersh. Their small White House quarters are
shown to have been a hothouse of jealousy, an accusatory,
belittling environment with Kissinger and Haig spying and
reading wiretap logs, and releasing an endless flow of unkind
and often savage words about Secretary of Defense Melvin
Laird, Secretary of State William Rogers and Nixon.
