Falkland talks at standoff
Buenoi Aires â€” Argentine officials yesterday said they remained
hopeful that a U.S. effort to defuse their confrontation with Britain over
the Falkland Islands would continue despite what appeared to be a
standoff between British and Argentine officials over several key nego
tiating issues.
Knowledgeable Argentine sources said the government had rejected
a formula for resolving the crisis because it involved British participation
in a temporary administration for the islands.
Argentina has been willing to agree to a multinational administration
for the disputed archipelago while negotiations were initiated, the
sources said, but has rejected British participation in the body while in
sisting on an Argentine representative.
Argentina has launched a new diplomatic initiative by telling the U.N.
Security Council that it would withdraw its troops from the islands when
Britain recalled the naval fleet headed for the South Atlantic and
stopped trying to "sanction a return to the previous colonial situation"
on the territory.
The Argentine communication to the Security Council represented
Argentina's first formal response to a U.N. resolution calling for a with
drawal of Argentine troops as a prelude to a negotiated settlement.
As the threat of war and an economic boycott of Argentina continued
to take its toll on an already-stricken economy here, however, officials
announced early yesterday morning that they had suspended Argen
tine imports from the European Community nations in retaliation for
similar measures taken against Argentina Sunday.
