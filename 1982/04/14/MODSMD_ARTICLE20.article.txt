## Solution: defensive missiles 
### 
The solution to the precarious situ
ation the United States finds itself in
tod*y is an ambitious program to
deploy antiballistic missiles (ABMs).
Currently, most experts agree that in
a first strike, the Soviet Union could
destroy more than 90 percent of our
land-based missile force, effectively
eliminate the effectiveness of our
strategic bomber force and damage
the one-third of our strategic sub
marine force that happened to be in
port, while keeping a substantial por
tion of their force in reserve. This vul
nerability gives ; the Soviet Onion
considerable incentive to strike pre
emptively in a crisis. Of course, two-

thirds of our strategic submarine
force would be able to respond (if
President Ronald Reagan's com
munications hardening program Is
finished), but none of our sub
marines currently have "hard-kill"
capability — the ability to destroy
land-based missiles and other hard
ened military targets. Faced with the
awful choice of responding to a Sovi
et first strike with an attack against
only "soft targets" (cities) and invit
ing a Soviet second strike against
American cities, an American presi
dent might decide to capitulate in*
stead. Whether a president actually
would capitulate is almost beside the
point since the essence of deterrence
is making tfife Soviets believe we
would respond, something which,
our current weakness does nothing
to promote.
A second problem of the current
missile vulnerability is that it forces
the United States to initiate a policy
of launching our ICBM's while under
attack; that is, before Soviet missiles
fiave actually impacted on American
soil. This exacerbates the problems of
false alerts and places America's nu
clear arsenal on a hair trigger. pSP'f
The solution to these problems is

not, as seems to be simplistically as
sumed by many columnists in the
Daily, a freeze on the deployment of
nuclear weapons. This only increases
the strategic imbalance that exists to
day, weakening deterrence against
the Soviet use of weapons.
Moreover, if the American and Sovi
et bureaucracies agree to limit the
quantitative arms race, a qualitative
arms race will develop. Empirically,
this is precisely what happened with
SALT I. The SALT I limits on strategic
launchers led to the development of
MIRV technology which today
creates a situation where it is de
sirable to fire first (rather than sec\
ond) in a nuclear war. If a limit is
placed on the number of new weap
ons that can be deployed, each side
will engage in the destabilizing task
1 of trying to make a new technolog
ical breakthrough. Fears of secret dis
coveries will increase and the poten
tial for a nuclear strike will grow.
To solve these problems, the Unit
ed States should begin a program of
ABM deployment. There is no ques
tion that the necessary technology
exists today. If the United States
withdraws from the ABM Treaty im !
accord with its provisions and uses
existing Low Altitude Defense Sys
tem (LOADS) technology, a portion
of our strategic defense budget
would finally be spent to directly de
fend against nuclear weapon?. An ef
fective ABM system to protect Amer
ica's strategic forces would reduce
crisis instability since there would be
no Incentive for the Soviets tb strike
first. And, to the extent j|ny "arms
race" developed ftom : such a pro
gram, it would be a race to build
more defensive weapons. After all,
low altitude ABM interceptor mis
siles have such a limited range that
they pose no strategic threat.
A diversion of Soviets funds away
frbm offensive weapons and into de
fensive ABM system should be en
couraged. An effective ABM system
in both the Soviet Union and the
United States wotikf create exactly
the situation nucfear-freeze ad
vocates hope for -*the obsolescence
of all nuclear weapons since neither
country would havliany incentive to
use them,
