## Beware subtle victimization 
### 
I think a lot of people who had worked on the nuclear
weapons sytem — especially Edward Teller — felt des
perate about these weapons. Nobody wants to build a
gadget that is never used. They were always looking for
ways to put the atom to 'peaceful' uses.
So they created a large and varied program called
Plowshare, basically designed to use nuclear bombs like
dynamite. If dynamite can be used to kill people, it can
also be used to make tunnels, to move rocks. Nuclear ex
plosives could build a new sea-level Panama Canal right
smack across the isthmus of Panama... They were going
to take maybe a hundred megatons worth of nuclear
bombs, maybe two hundred megatons, and set them off
in a string to dig this new canal.
This kind of mad scheme was active in 7966 and 1967.
The military was encouraging them, trying to make the
bomb look 'peaceful' with the motto, 'Beating swords
into plowshares.'As long as you can convey the idea that
setting off bombs in people's backyards is no threat, you
can use the bombs to fight nuclear wars.

Insiders Speak Out"

It is a certainty that every reader of this newspaper has
already been exposed to the effects of nuclear weapons.
One need not have been present at Hiroshima or
Nagasaki — the Japanese cities destroyed in Nuclear War
I — to qualify. Blast, heat and prompt radiation are not
the only effects of nuclear weapons.
Anyone born before 1962 was exposed to fallout from
hundreds of atmospheric nuclear bomb tests conducted
by the United States, the Soviet Union and Britain. Even
those born since 1962 have experienced fallout/ thanks
to atmospheric bomb tests by countries which have not
signed the Partial Test Ban Treaty, namely, France and
The manner in which the governments of the United
States and the other nuclear powers have treated the
problem of fallout can only be described as dejpraved.
The history of governmental cover-up, particularly In the
United States, is now a matter of public record. Massive
propaganda campaigns by the military and the Atomic
Energy Commission (now called the Nuclear Regulatory
Commission) attempted to lull into complacency both
the general public and those soldiers forced to witness
nuclear blasts in the Nevada desert. Health physicists •—
such as Sternglass, quoted above, and John Gofman —
who sought to warn the public of radiation dangers and
governmental lying had their research funds cut off and
were the subject of vicious personal attacks by those re
sponsible for endangering the lives of millions of Ameri
cans. Governmental deceit on the topic of radiation-re
lated health hazards continues to this day.
It is also safe to assume that every reader of the Daily
has suffered the psychological effects of nuclear weap
ons. The constant threat of nuclear war has inflicted
upon all of us a sort of "psychic numbing." The specter
of nuclear war is so overwhelming, and the associated
feelings of personal powerlessness so great, that most
people can cope only by suppressing these fears. This is a
formidable barrier to overcome if people are to take ac
tion against the threat of nuclear holocaust.
Another frightening psychological effect of nuctear

weapons is the way in which we have trivialized the very
concept of such weapons and their immense destructive
power. "Nuke the Ayatollah," "Nuke the Preppies/'
"Nuke the Whales and analogous slogans appear on
bumper stickers and T-shirts. A wholly justifiable fear has
been turned into a joke — in the American fashion, a
profitable joke.
The economic effects of nuclear weapons also disrupt
this society, although we have never suffered nuclear at
tack. Hundreds of billions of dollars have been spent by
the federal government to procure these weapons of
mass destruction. Approximately 30,000 nuclear war
heads are now in the U.S. arsenal. Would another 17,000
make you feel any safer? The Reagan Administration
seems to think so.
Comparison of so-called defense expenditures to out
lays for education, health and public transit, to name just
a few areas of social need, is a common vehicle for show
ing just how distorted are the federal government's
priorities.

'Nuke the Ayatollah/'Nuke the

For example, greater than half of all federal monies
slated for research and development in the upcoming
fiscal year will go td weapons programs, while renewable
energy and agricultural programs are being drastically
reduced.
The myth about military spending resulting in won
drous benefits to consumers is certainly an enduring
one. In fact, these so-called spinoffs to the public are not
only marginal, but could have been achieved far more
quickly and cheaply had capital gone d/rect/yftp
velopment. Trickle-down through the military-industrial
behemoth i$ efficient only at enriching weapon makers,
increasing the influence of the military In government,
and creating a handful of jobs for the technocratic elite.
These people, who abound in the Santa Clarlif Valley —
and not a few are to be found at Stanford — have vested
interest in maintaining the status quo.
In summary, the nuclear arms race is leading thtfcoun
try to disaster, either through war or simply by sapping
our health and economic well-being, fcffectivf citizen
action is the only viable alternative. The nuclear/'high
priests" certainly cannot get us out of our qyandry.
