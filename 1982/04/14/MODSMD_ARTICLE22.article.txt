## Balancing defense, democracy and safety 
### 
In February President Ronald Rea
gan met with newspaper editors and
broadcast news directors. In his
opening statement, Reagan is re
ported by the Associated Press to
have said data that he and top of
ficials are privy to justifies the pro
posed 18 per cent boost in defense
spending.
"There are things that in this fob,
there is Information that you have,
probably you're the only person,
plus a few immediately around you,
who have that information."
This is an Inexcusable breach of the
democratatic process Our federal
government was constituted to pro
vide a means for citizens to govern
themselves. Arbitration of defense
expenditures by a president and a
few top officials is not democratic.
Democracy can exist only when
elected officials furnish citizens with
information pertinent loan issue.
Obviously, thliprivate information
our president cites pertains to Soviet
military capacity. Why can't thh In
formation be in the public domain?
Surely, the secrecy is not intended to

prevent the Soviets from finding out
their own military capacity. Why then
is this information not available? Why
is defense excluded from the demo
cratic process in the United States?
This is not the first time a Soviet
threat has been posited to justify in
creased military expenditures by our
federal government. In 1955 the Sovi
ets developed an intercontinental
bomber capacity. Notwithstanding
the possession of a fleet of several
thousand intercontinental bombers,
the United States intelligence com
munity predicted an imminent
"bomber gap" in anticipation of a big
Soviet push in aircraft production.
The ICBM program was given the
government's highest priority and
production of the 8-52 intercon
tinental bomber was accelerated.
However, until 1975 the Soviets had
less than 200 intercontinental bomb
ers.
A priori, I am not Opposed to
boosting defense spending to 220
billion dollars in 1983. However, to
do so when the federal deficit for the
same year is 100 billion dollars is not a

course to be taken without careful
scrutiny. The propriety of this expen
diture (seven percent of the U.S.
GNP) must be analyzed â€” keeping in
mind the facts that 15 million people
die of starvation each year and 40
percent of the world's population
has no access to professional health
services.
same conference Reagan
said that cuts in this defense budget
would threaten "the very safety" of
the United States. Irrespective of In
creased defense expenditures, the
safety of the United Siira, can no
longer be guaranteed in today's nu
|Hear armed world. Failure of a single
electronic component in a time of in
ternational tension could plunge hu
manity Into the devastation of a nu
clear war. Safety will come only when
we allow our adversaries as well as
ourselves and our allies to be secure
from the threat of nuclear annihila
tion."^
