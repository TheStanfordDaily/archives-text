## Card wins 3 of 4 in crucial stretch 
### Sally Jenkins 
The goal was to win three of
four home matches against
top-ranked teams in Arizona,
Arizona State, UC-Berkeley
and Trinity, and to do it though
dogged by rotten weather and
troubling inconsistencies. The
Cardinal men's tennis team
emerged with three upset
wins, and head coach Dick
Gould emerged with a cold.
Stanford took revenge on Ar
izona and Arizona State Friday
and Saturday 8-1 and 5-4 re
spectively, and upset UC-
Berkeley 6-3 Monday after
noon.
Tired to the bone from fight
ing through tiebreaker after
tiebreaker against it's first three
opponents, Stanford fell to
Trinity yesterday afternoon 6-3
to complete three-quarters of a
crucial eight-match stretch that
includes matches against USC
and UCLA in Los Angeles Fri
day and Saturday.
' Everything hinged on the
ASU and Cal matches, and if it
weren't for a couple of Stan
ford dark horses named Mark
McKeen and Jim Miller the
1982 tennis season might well
have been one big wash-out.
McKeen and Miller stared
down a total of six match points
in a three-set, two-tiebreaker
N0.3 doubles match Saturday
night to provide the winning
margin against ASU. In doing
so they gave Stanford the go
ahead signal to whip Cal Mon
day afternoon, and a little
breathing room where Trinity
was concerned.
Saturday's ASU match was
moved to the indoor Sundown

Tennis Club in San Mateo be
cause of rain. Play didn't begin
until 5 p.m. and continued well
into Easter Sunday. Forced to
relinquish all semblance of a
home court advantage, Stan
ford found itself down 2-4 after
the six singles matches. Only
seniors Scott Bondurant and
Jeff Arons won their matches;
Bondurant took a a streaky
three-setter from Brian Sul
livan 6-0, 1-6, 6-4, and Arons
defeated Dewey Gratten 6-2,
6-2.
Faced with the task of win
ning all three doubles matches
to avoid its second loss of the
season to ASU, the Cardinal
simply did it. Sophomore Scott
Davis and Arons defeated Gary
Donnelly and Todd Nelson 6-4,
6-4 at No.l and senior John
Corse and Bondurant defeated
Alex Levie and Gratten 6-3, 6-3
at N0.2, setting up the confron
tation at N0.3 between
sophomore McKeen and grad
student Miller, and Paul Berns
tein and Sullivan of ASU.
The Cardinal pair dropped
the first set 2-6. Pulling out all
the stops in the second and hit
ting shots they never knew
they had, they came back from
three match points with Miller
serving at 4-5, and three more
again with McKeen serving at
5-6. They won the set with a 7-3

tiebreaker, and started into a
nightmarish replay with yet an
other tiebreaker in the third, to
finally triumph at shortly after 1
a.m. 2-6, 7-6 (7-3), 7-6 (7-3).
The Cardinal split singles
with Cal 3-3 Monday as Davis
defeated Randy Nixon 6-3, 6-3
at No.l, Corse took a three-set
ter from Doug Stone 2-6, 6-3,
6-4 at N0.3, and Bondurant ran
through John Severly 6-1,7-5 at
N0.5.
Stanford made sure of its vic
tory this time as Davis and
Arons wasted no time on Mark
Woolridge and Hector Hecht
7-6 (7-4) 6-1, Corse and Bond
urant snuck by Nixon and
Stone 6-3, 3-6, 7-5. and
McKeen and Miller iced it off
in grand style over Severly and
Courtney Benham 4-6, 7-6
(7-3), 6-4.
Stanford won all the close
ones against Arizona Friday, a
new look for the squad that
carried them through until yes
terday, Davis defeated Paul
Chamberlain at No.l 6-3, 6-3,
and Corse defeated Andes
Luters in one of his many three
setters of the weekend 7-6
(7-3), 4-6 at N0.3.
At N0.4 Arons defeated Tim
Marcin in three sets 6-4, 4-6,
6-4, Bondurant ran over Bill
Moss 7-5,6-1, and Miller pulled
out the N0.6 match in three

sets 3-6, 6-4, 6-3. Stanford
swept the doubles without
dropping a set to wrap up the
8-1 victory.
Yesterday's match vs. Trinity
was one the Cardinal half-ex
pected to lose, which is why
the previous three matches
were so crucial. In the singles,
Davis blew out Tom Warneke
6-3, 6-4, Arons ran over David
Edges 6-3, 6-0, and Bondurant
did the same to Craig Yingst 6-2
6-4.
But Stanford was destroyed
in doubles, starting with a 2-6,
2-6 loss at No.l where Davis
and Arons ran head on into a
powerful Warneke and Mark
Pinchoff team from Trinity.
McKeen and Miller strug
gled through their fourth
three-setter of the weekend at
N0.3, but their staying power
was gone by the third set
tiebreaker which they lost 7-2,
giving Edges and Yingst a 3-6,
6-2, 7-6 victory.
Bondurant and Corse came
back from a 2-5 deficit to win a
tiebreaker in the first set
against Charles Honey and
Chris Kennedy at N0.2. The
pair finally won the bitterly
fought set 7-6 (16-14), but once
again fatigue caught up with
them as they lost the second
and third 4-6,4-6.
