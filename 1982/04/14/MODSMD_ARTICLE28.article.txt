# Card wins two to start homestand

The Stanford Cardinal,
playing once again on familiar
turf; bounced back from a 1-5
roacj trip in Arizona last week
to pick up a 2-0 win over San
Jose; State Monday and an 8-2
win at Santa Clara yesterday.
Stanford coach Mark Mar
quess held an impromptu prac
tice' after Monday's sluggish
win that lasted less than two

hours, but surprised many of
his starters by giving them a rest
yesterday.
Eric Hardgrave hit a three
run homer and drove in four
runs to pace the attack yester
day. Stanford scored three runs
in both the third and fifth in
nings to put the game away ear
ly-
"l think we're coming out
out of it," Marquess said lam

enting about his teams ex
tended hitting slump. "We hit
the ball better and we were a
little more aggressive."
Stanford's pitching and de
fense, which has pulled them
through all year, continued
strong. Doug Gwaltney, Steve
Cottrell and Jeff Ballard each
pitched three strong innings
yesterday. Gwaltney started
and was credited with the win.

"We pitched very well,"
Marquess said, "and played
good defense. Lyle Smith did a
good job of filling in for
(catcher Bob) Hausladen."
Monday, Stanford picked up
runs on a solo home run by
Hausladen and a perfectly-ex
ecuted squeeze bunt by pinch
hitter Vince Sakowski. Brian
Myers and David Harris com
bined for the shutout.
Hausladen drilled San Jose
starter Ken Rebiejo' ? first sec
ond-inning pitch into the
Sunken Diamond scoreboard
in deep left-centerfield — leav
ing a dent as a reminder to Re
biejo.
The game's only other run
came in the seventh inning.
Mike Dotterer led off the in
ning with a lashing double
down the left field line.
Hausladen moved Dotterer to
third with a grounder straight
back at Spartan pitcher Ron
Kolstad. Marquess then called
on Sakowski to pinch hit for
Loring Davies. Sakowski, usual
ly used for late-inning de
fensive help, swung away at
two pitches before setting
down a perfect bunt to score
Dotterer.
Myers pitched six innings,
giving up three hits and striking
out three to pick up the win.
Harris, aided by a game-ending
double play picked up a save.
Rebiejo was tagged with the
loss.
Fierce winds blowing in from
right field and a soggy infield
eliminated several potential
hits.
The wins improved Stan
ford's mark to 31-12-1 after the
devastating road trip to Arizo
na last week that dropped the
Cardinal from No. 2 to No. 6 in
the national rankings. The Card
remains home for an extended
homestand facing UCLA in a
doubleheader Saturday at
noon and for a single game
Sunday at 1 p.m. The Card hosts
No. 1 Arizona State April 19-21
and the San Francisco Giants in
an exhibition game Thursday.
