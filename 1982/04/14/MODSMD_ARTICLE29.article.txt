With Craig "the Walrus"
Stadler's victory in the Master's
last weekend, golf is temporari
ly rescued from the
muscletown epidemic that has
grown like moss over the sport
ing world. It was beautiful to
see the Master's officials
scrambling to find a green
jacket that would fit Stadler
who weighed in at a svelte 205.
Golf seemed invulnerable
until a few year's back when
Gary Player won the Master's
and preached the virtues of
dedication and fitness. Portly
Jack Nicklaus jumped on the
bandwagon by trimming down
and modeling his own line of
sportswear. The Johnny Millers
and the Ben Crenshaws be
came the new image of golf,
but the pudgy Stadler with the
droopy moustache came along
in time to preserve the game
for those who are overweight
but under par.
It's sad when the worth of an
athlete is determined by how
many posters he can sell.
Mickey Lolich's fastball and
Denny McClain's 30 win season
have been replaced by Jim
Palmer's Jockey underwear ads
and Bucky Dent's, Lee Mazzili's
and Joe Charboneau's poster
wars.
Keep jazzercize out of our
lazy summer afternoons. Bring
on Stadler. Bring on the short,
fat Dodger pitcher with
pimples all over his face.

CWAA reps along with celebri
ty guests and sports person

Hayward' Southland Shopping
Center on Saturday afternoons
from April 17 through May 1.

prizes and gift certificates from
local merchants will be an

The San Francisco Giants will
be in town next Thursday for an
exhibition game against Stan
ford at Sunken Diamond at
1:30. It is the first time Stanford
has been able to schedule the
Giants while 6-Pac rivals Arizo
na State and Arizona schedule
several games a year against
major league clubs. It's a con
venient chance to see the
Giants and a full house could
make it an annual game.
The game will be preceded
by a softball game between the
KSFO All-Stars and a Stanford
coaches team that will include
New York Yankee John Elway,
Darrin Nelson, Andre Tyler and
Doug Rogers.

Stanford's men's and wom
en's crew teams shrugged off
tremendous head winds and
stroked to impressive victories
over USC and Santa Clara last
weekend.
The women's varsity shell
flew past USC Saturday win

ning by four lengths. Stanford
also won the No. 1 novice race
over USC and Santa Clara.
Friday night, the Stanford
junior varsity boat beat both
Humbolt State and Mills Col
lege varsity boats and the No. 2
novice shell beat the No. 1 nov
ice boats from Humbolt and
Mills.
The men's team whipped
Santa Clara and USC by nearly
seven seconds in the varsity
division Saturday. Stanford also
won the junior varsity race, but
was beaten by Santa Clara in
the freshmen event.

The NHL playoffs took a turn
for the worse Monday when
the Chicago Black Hawks upset
the Minnesota North Stars in
the first round. The North Stars,
runners-up to the New York Is
landers in last year's Stanley
Cup Final, were counted on as
"America's team."
Half of the squad is com
prised of Americans — a rarity
in a sport dominated by Cana
dians — and former Olympic
gold medalists Craig
Hartsburg, Neal Broten, new
comer Mark Johnson and oth
ers, led a young, Yankee crew
to their Cinderella story in the
NHL. General Manager Lou
Nanne vows to continue draft
ing native Minnesotans.
