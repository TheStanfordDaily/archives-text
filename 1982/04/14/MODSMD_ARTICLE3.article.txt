# COP slates contrast attitudes, philosophy
## 
### Heather Millar Senior staff writer 
Last night's ASSU campaign de
bates subjected the credentials of the
two slates running for Council of
Presidents (COP) to more scrutiny
than the issues themselves received.
Emotions ran high throughout this
first official confrontation between
the two groups of COP candidates,
with one group pointing to its oppo
nents' lack of involvement in ASSU
bodies and the other retorting that it
opposed a slate of entrenched estab
lishment candidates.
The slate comprised primarily of
ASSU insiders — Rod Beckstrom,
Mark Epstein, Yolanda Townsend
and Cynthia Mathewson (BET'M) —
and that of community activists Rob
in Cooper, Eloisa Carillo, Michael
Lighty and Doris Wilson (CCLW)
voiced their support for similiar is
sues: opening a student-run restau
rant in Encina Station, intercomm
munity dialogue and maintenance of
theme houses. The two slates em
phasized their different backgrounds
and how they would cause their ap
proach to the issues to differ widely.
"The big difference is between
those who lead and those who jump
on the bandwagon," said Yolanda
Townsend, who gave the opening
statement for "BET'M." !n this
statement Townsend alluded to the
unspoken question which domi
nated the debate: What kind of ex
perience is required to run the
ASSU? Which is more valuable, lead
ership in various grass-roots or
ganizations such as SWOPSI, the
Women's Center and MEChA or

leadership within the ASSU itself?
CCtW emphasized the im
portance of experience in smaller
student organizations and commit
tees which they have led. "The
hands-on experience in the day-to
day operation of the ASSU — that's
the kind of experience that's natural
for leaders to have," Lighty, SWOPSI
co-director, said.
Communication and cooperation
emerged as the catch words in the
CCLW debate statements. CCLW said
it supported student advocacy in
contexts as varied as battling federal
student aid cuts and creating flexibili
ty in the Western Culture programs.
CCLW emphasized the importance
of political and minority issues and
criticized the current proposals for a
Cultural Programming Board.
"We have an understanding of
broad-based issues," said Cooper.
"We're not talking about totally new
programs, but more understanding.
Our emphasis... is on broader polit
ical issues." In his closing statement,
Lighty again brought this topic up by
saying his slate, if elected, would
sponsor a letter-writing campaign to
involve itself in opposing financial
aid cuts and in opening lines of com
munication with University adminis
trators regarding tuition increases.
BET'M highlighted the ASSU's role
as an administrative, guiding body.
"The important role of the ASSU is to
coordinate the students themselves
in doing those things (responding to
issues outside Stanford)," said
Beckstrom. Experience, knowledge

COP SLATES DEBATE QUALIFICATIONS — The CCLW slate, which
includes (above, left to right) Doris Wilson, Robin Cooper, Michael
Lighty and Eloisa Carillo, debated (below, left to right) Rod
Beckstrom, Mark Epstein, Yolanda Townsend and Cynthia
Mathewson of the BET'M slate last night in Annenberg Auditorium.
The debate centered more on each slate's experience for the office
rather than campus issues.

of the issues and of the ASSU, qualify
the BET'M slate to lead student gov
ernment, the members of this slate
insisted.
BET'M also claimed "hands on ex
perience" but of a different sort:;
Beckstrom and Epstein are both
ASSU senators; Mathewson serves as
the ASSU financial manager; and
Townsend has acted as a liaison be
tween the ASSU and the black com
munity on campus.
Responding to opponents who call
BET'M the"club ASSU," Epstein said,
"We've been labeled as members of
the 'club ASSU' but remember we're
all members of the same club."
Mathewson contended the slate's
qualifications would enable "BET'M"
to accomplish what "BET'M" critics
call "pie-in-the-sky dreams:" turn
ing Encina Station into a student-run
pizza parlor and ice cream shop, and
helping to reduce the Food Service
bill by $1 million. Beckstrom has
served on the Task Force investigat
ing University Food Service.
"Pie-in-the-sky dreams are for
those who don't know how," said
Mathewson.
Twenty senate candidates, out of a
total of 39, presented statements. The
candidates' platforms were largely
built on the planks of the Encina
pizza parlor, food service reform,
housing and fee assessments. Various
plans for bringing more concerts to
campus were also mentioned.
