# Bob Brody named as new student financial manager
## 
### 
An ASSU selection committee yes
terday announced that Bob Brody, a
senior majoring in economics, would
be next year's Student Financial
Manager (SFM) pending Senate con
firmation, according to committee
member and current SFM Cynthia
Mathewson.
The position was earlier filled this
year by the selection committee but
became vacant when Victor Hymes,
the committee's first choice, decided
to take another position. Hymes was
selected associate SFM midway
through last quarter but did not of
ficially resign until the first week of
this quarter, according to

Mathewson. At this time the whole
selection process was reopened.
Although Brody will begin training
immediately, he is officially an as
sociate SFM until his nomination is
confirmed. The confirmation usually
takes place midway through spring
quarter, but may be later this year be
cause of the delay in his appoint
ment.
Brody has previously served as
General Manager and Financial
Manager for La Pizzeria and Business
Manager for KZSU.
Brody's main goal for next year is to
expand the sources of the ASSU's
revenues.
