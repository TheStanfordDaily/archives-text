Yesterday it was reported that
Mike Lung suffered a broken spinal
cord in an accident resulting from
his landing on the hard tile floor of

on cushions and damaged his
cervical vertebrae as a result of the
angle of the impact.

After working hard all week at the
Daily staffers want to relax, but we
don't just reach for a can of beer and
sit around. We go out to Roble field
at 1:30 p.m. on Saturday with our
gloves in hand, position ourselves on
the field and only then do we reach
for a can of beer. Then we sit back re
lax, beat the Professional journalism
Fellows and achieve inner bliss be
cause we know we're experiencing
softball time.
