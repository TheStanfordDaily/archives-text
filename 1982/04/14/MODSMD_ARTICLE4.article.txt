# Expert blasts Reagan's energy policies
##

â€¢ Using existing technology, the United States can
substantially increase its standard of living while
reducing its energy consumption, energy expert
Denis Hayes said last night.
He told an audience of about 50 in Skilling
Auditorium that the Reagan administration is cur
rently "pouring billions of dollars into technolog
ical black holes that the private sector would never
touch."
Hayes, who graduated from Stanford in 1969 and
served as a University trustee, coordinated the first
nationwide Earth Day in 1970. He was recently dis
missed from his post as head of the national Solar
Energy Research Institute because of "policy dif
ferences" with the Reagan administration.
"I'm the only director of a national laboratory
ever to be asked to resign on a political basis,"
Hayes said. "I ignored some advice given to me by
my father when I was young: 'If you want to grow
up with good teeth,' he told me, 'brush your teeth
after you eat and mind your own business.' I got

involved with a number of highly important issues
where my views did not coincide with those of the
Department of Energy."
Hayes said the energy policies being pursued by
the Reagan administration will have an "awesome
negative impact" on the country. "We are facing
an unprecedented vulnerability to foreign oil and
embarking on a course that will yield some dread
fully bad results." The Reagan administration
"trimmed" the Federal solar budget 92 percent
and the Federal conservation budget 97 percent,
Hayes said, while allocating $88 billion to a syn
thetic fuels program which Reagan had opposed
while a presidential candidate.
"This government isn't conservative, it's an or
ganized hypocrisy," Hayes said. A truly conserva
tive government would not foster such a massive
and inefficient interference with the market's al
location of resources, Hayes said. Neither would a
truly conservative government support nuclear
power after eight years in which no new construc
tion of nuclear plants has been ordered by private

utilities.
During his term, the Solar Energy Research In
stitute developed an energy plan which followed a
truly conservative philosophy, Hayes said. Assum
ing that oil prices do not rise above $40 a barrel by
the year 2000 (oil currently sells for about $34 per
barrel), the researchers projected that by using the
most energy-efficient products now on the mar
ket, consumers could save a great deal of energy.
With these savings, they could accommodate: a 30
percent increase in population, an 80 percent in
crease in the gross national product (CNP), an 80
percent increase in air travel, increases in automo
bile travel, and substantial increases in rail and air
freight shipment. Meanwhile, national consump
tion of energy would actually decrease.
"How do we get there from here?" Hayes asked.
"It's depressing. We can't expect any leadership
from Washington in the near future For
tunately, one of the strengths of our political sys
tem is that we do not have to count on our leaders
