# EPA incorporation loses by close vote

In a bid for incorporation cont
ingent upon the passage of each of
four measures, East Palo Altans nar
rowly chose not to form an inde
pendent city government in yester
day's municipal election.
Ballot Proposition C, which would
have dissolved the East Palo Alto San
itary District, failed — by 41 votes out
of more than 2300 cast — to win ap
proval, and consequently East Palo
Alto will remain an unincorporated
part of San Mateo County. The final
tally was 1215 against and 1174 for the
measure.
Had incorporation been ap
proved, the newly-formed city of East
Palo Alto would have assumed re
sponsibility for each of the municipal
services currently provided by San
Mateo County. Dissolution of the
sanitary, waterworks and recreation
and parks districts was necessary for
incorporation.
Proposition A, which asked voters
to approve incorporation itself,
passed 1587 to 1238. Proposition B,
which would have dissolved the East
Palo Alto Waterworks District, passed

1367 to 1107. Proposition D, asking
voters to approve dissolution of the
Recreation and Parks District, passed
1586 to 1387.
According to Berkeley Driessel,
vice chairman of the East Palo Alto
Council, the Sanitary District's ac
tions provided "a really good exam
ple of deceitful propaganda."
The Sanitary Department used
scare tactics, campaigning that pas
sage of Proposition C would result in
"great user fees" and tax increases,
Driessel said. In fact, he said, Califor
nia does not permit a city to raise tax
es by more than 2 percent in any one
year. And user fees must increase re
gardless of whether incorporation is
approved.
Administrative officer Victor James
said, "The structure of the ballot
measure caused it to fail." Because
voters had to approve all four propo
sitions for incorporation to pass, "the
odds were against it,"he said.
According to Driessel, the East Palo
Alto Citizens Committee for In
corporation plans to make another
bid for incorporation in November.
