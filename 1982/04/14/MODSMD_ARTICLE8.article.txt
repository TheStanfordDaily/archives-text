# State supports arms freeze move
## 
### Washington Post 
Irvine, Calif. — Karen and
Bill Speros's four-bedroom,
$450,000 home looks out over
Orange County's grass-cov
ered Pacific Coast hills, the
abode of affluent, conservative
Republicans wedded to the
idea of a strong national de
fense.
Yet among the Speroses and
their friends, the talk has sud
denly turned to how quickly
their paneled walls and land
scaped gardens could disinte
grate in a nuclear war.
"If you've got to gamble,"
said Bill Speros, one of many
conservative Reagan sup
porters here who differ with
the president on the arms race,
"it's better to gamble on a nu
clear freeze than on an all-out
nuclear buildup."
In this huge, traditionally Re
publican southern California
county of engineers, business
executives, lawyers and teach
ers, where presidential can
didate Ronald Reagan won 75
percent of the vote, the cam
paign to freeze production of
nuclear weapons has struck a
surprising chord. More than
102,000 of the 650,000 Califor
nia signatures supporting a

statewide vote for a nuclear
weapons freeze have been col
lected in Orange County.
At the St. Mark Presbyterian
Church in Newport Beach,
where the Speroses worship,
the largely Republican, pro-
Reagan congregation has dis
cussed the petition drive in af
ter-church meetings, and the
associate pastor estimates at
least half of them have signed.
"I was a little reluctant to em
brace the idea because, oh, I
guess I didn't want to be as
sociated with a peacenik-type
thing," said John Fassett, 48, a
white-haired, bespectacled
engineering manager at one of
the high-technology com
panies that dot this area.
But, he said, he was turned
around by the realization that
"we have already so many
weapons in the nuclear
arsenal, even if a small fraction
were to be used, the world
would cease to be habitable for
man."
"Never in our wildest
dreams did we think we would
have enough signatures al
ready," said Karen Speros, a
high school teacher who
circulated the nuclear-freeze
initiative petitions at county

shopping centers.
Jq Seidita, however, who
started the initiative campaign
with her husband Nicholas,
said she had been confident
this would happen ever since
her husband found a small
news article about the votes on
a 1980 nuclear-freeze proposal
in a relatively conservative East
Coast area — three state sena
torial districts that are "sort of
the Orange County of Massa
chusetts."
The local Massachusetts res
olution carried 30 of the 32
towns where Reagan had also
received a majority. The
Seiditas persuaded their small
Unitarian church in Los Angel
es' San Fernando Valley to help
sponsor the initiative cam
paign, which has now ap
parently guaranteed that the
nuclear-freeze proposal will be
on the state ballot in Novem
ber.
At the 425-member St. Mark
Presbyterian Church, the 34-
year-old associate pastor, Tony
Wolfe, has found a receptive
audience for sermons decrying
the nuclear arms race.
"The court of last resort is in
the hearts of Christian people
throughout the country who

are beginning to question the
heretofore sacred domain of
military planners, whose only
understanding of security is
based on weapons," Wolfe
told the congregation last Au
gust as the freeze campaign
was taking shape.
President Ronald Reagan
and Secretary of State Alex
ander Haig oppose freezing
American and Soviet nuclear
weapons production, because
they feel only the threat of a
U.S. arms buildup can con
vince the Soviets to negotiate
an arms reduction on both
sides.
But conservative Re
publicans here say they see the
California freeze proposal to
be so qualified that it is almost
innocuous. It directs the gov
ernor of California to ask the
president to negotiate a
bilateral, verifiable freeze with
the Soviet Union.
Karen Speros remembered
her husband finally saying, "It's
really not very much at all, is it?
It's really a public-relations
tool. It says I would like jerry to
tell Ronnie thus and so."
Bill Speros, 46, is president of
a local firm constructing heat
ing and cooling systems, and
the severe slump in the con
struction market, brought on
in part by high interest rates
stimulated by government def
icit spending, has influenced
the family's thinking. "The big
bang for the buck has its lim
its," Karen Speros said.
A January California poll by
Mervin Field said 60 percent of
California voters favored the
nuclear-freeze initiative, with
32 percent opposed and 8 per
cent undecided.
