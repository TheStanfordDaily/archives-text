# Intramural program director fights for new facility
## 
### Libby Leonard 
Like any other university op
eration, the Stanford in
tramural program is con
fronted with the economic and
organizational realities com
mon to such organizations.
Fortunately, the intramural
program is taking steps to find
solutions to improve its service
to the community.
The intramural program,
supported by general funds of
the university, has an $80,000
per year operating budget. In
tramural director Howard
Dalmar'said that 93 percent of
that budget is used for staff
salaries and officials' fees. The
remaining 7 percent goes
toward new equipment, utili
ties, administrative travel and
printing costs.

Dallmar explained that the
intramural program is essen
tially student operated. An Ad
visory Council was selected by
Dallmar during the fall. Its sev
en members represent dif
ferent competitive units:
fraternities, sororities,
dormitories, graduate schools
and eating clubs.
Dallmar said he calls on the
Advisory Committee to help
settle any disputes which arise.
Complaints related to the use
of ineligible players are also
handled by Dallmar and the
Advisory Committee.
"We have very few protests
compared to other schools,"
noted Dallmar. Should a team
wish to protest a match, the
manager or captain of that
team must present the reasons

for the protest to the in
tramural director in writing
within 20 hours of the contest
in question. The officials and
the opposing team's manager
must also submit a report to the
intramural office.
The intramural department
also has a Policy Committee
consisting of the Director and
the Associate Director of Ath
letics, the Director of In
tramurals, and the coach of the
sport which is the focus of at
tention at a given time. This
council establishes policy and
deals with conflicts related to
facilities, new sports, equip
ment and salaries.
Since Stanford does not have
a School of Physical Education,
recruiting qualified officials
can be a problem. In order to

meet the demand for football,
basketball, soccer and softball
officials, teams in these ac
tivities are required to supply
an official to work one assigned
day during the quarter. These
individuals help the full time
officials and must attend a
clinic held at the start of each
season.
Officials were needed to
cover 110 basketball games a
week last quarter. More than
500 softball games requiring of
ficials are expected to be
played this spring.
In addition to a shortage of
officials, forfeiting also poses a
problem for the intramural
program.
"We're always trying to cut
down on the number of for
feits," said Dallmar. "It's unfair

to the teams and the officials
who meet their responsibility
and show up and it costs our
department money."
Dallmar noted a third prob
lem confronting intramurals.
"Our outdoor facilities are tre
mendous, but we do need
more indoor facilities/' he said.
Last quarter both Roble Gym
and Maples Pavillion were
used to accommodate the 200
basketball teams. These build
ings, however, were only avail
able during limited hours in
the day, because varsity teams
and classes were also using
them. "Some basketball games
didn't end until 1 a.m.,"
Dallmar recalled.
"We're waiting for a new
building which hopefully will
be completed within the next
two or three years," Dallmar
said.
Architectural plans for the
new intramural recreational
center, to be built adjacent to
Encina Gym, have already been
completed. According to
Dallmar, the complex would
be large enough to house three
basketball courts. "We could
really expand our program if
we had our own facilities," he
added.
