# How to win an intramural championship
## 
### Adam Berns 
A majority of the people who
play intramurals do not know,
and probably do not even care,
how the scoring is done. For
years, the same groups — most
notably the fraternities — have
been reaping the benefits of
this policy of silence.
In the interest of fairness,
equality and to fill some space,
this Daily exclusive will delve
into the intricacies of IM scor

ing and the benefits to be de
rived from being an IM cham
pion.
First of all, why bother to be
an intramural champion? Is it
worth the blood and guts, the
broken bones, the bruised
shoulders and trick knees? Is
the camaraderie among one's
peers and the spirit of competi
tion worth it? Of course it isn't.
But the recognition is.
Each winning team has an

award picture taken, and the
picture stays on display in En
cina Gym for one full year. For
the teams that win the All-Unir
versity and All-Women's
Championships, their names
are added to the All-University
Elwyn Bugge Memorial Award
Plaque and the Cathy
Templeton All Women's
Award Plaque on display in En
cina Gym. These groups all re
ceive a trophy which is pre

sented at the first home foot
ball game after registration.
If that is not an incentive for
winning, what is? Unfortunate
ly the same groups win every
year. If you are sick and tired of
Sigma Chi, or one of the other
fraternities winning the All-
University trophy every year,
follow this simple formula and
you too can transform a group
of premeds, engineers, and
nerds into intramural cham

pions.
The first thing to realize is
that it is not necessary to win
basketball, football, or any of
the glamorous sports in order
to take the intramural cham
pionship. Fielding powerful
teams in football, horseshoes,
hand ball, table tennis and
squash is at least as important.
Keeping this overall plan in
mind, it is also important to
know the way points are to
talled up. The easiest way to
figure this out is to get a copy of
the intra-mural manager's
handbook. There are dif
ferences in the points received
for entering the "A"or the "B"
league and each manager
should carefully analyze the
talent of his team in deciding
which league to enter. One
thing to keep in mind is the fact
that many good teams enter
the "B" division hoping to find
easy competition.
Not much has been men
tioned specifically about the
All Women's division for two
important reasons. First, the
rules and strategies mentioned
earlier for the All University
division are applicable here;
and second, any group of
women, even moderately co
ordinated, should be able to
clean up in women's play.
So there you have it, a com
plete guide to a successful in
tramural season. In your quest
for an intramural cham
pionship, if frustration sets in, if
your team would rather drink
beer than practice for its next
game, just remind your crew of
the old saying, "Winning isn't
everything, but it sure beats
losing."
