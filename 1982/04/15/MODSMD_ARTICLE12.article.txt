0.K., so you jog 10 miles ev
ery day, swim three times a
week and do a calistenic work
out each night before you go to
bed. You know that you're in
great shape.
But can you handle the Stan
ford Challenge?
Budweiser Light will sponsor
the first annual Stanford
Challenge Race on Sunday,
May 9. Registration will pre
cede the competition at 10 a.m.
and the race is scheduled to
start at Angell Field at 11 a.m.
Entrants may participate in
one of three divisions; as a
Stanford student, a Stanford
faculty or staff member, or as a
person with no Stanford affilia
tion. The competition is free to
the entrants in the first two
divisions, but a fee of $1 will be
charged to all non-affiliates
who wish to compete.
The Challenge itself is com
prised of a sequence of six sep
arate events. Competitors will
first run an 880-yard race

around the Angell Field track.
This short distance running
event is followed by a bike race
around the perimeter of the
Stanford football stadium and
through the center of campus
to Lake Lagunita.
After reaching this point in
the Challenge, the entrants will
dive into the lake and swim to
the other side. Another run
ning event is next, in which the
participants will be tested on
their endurance running abili
ty. They will cover a course
which will stretch from the
lake, around the dish loop, past
the radar telescope, down
Frenchman's Road, left on
Mayfield Ave. and back to Lake
Lagunita.
Event five is a Big Way Yacht
race on the lake where partici
pants will board rubber rafts
and navigate through floating
obstacles. Competitors will
then hop back on their bicycles
and peddle to Angell Field for
the final circuit exercise event.
This course, which should be

layed out around the track, will
be comprised of seven stations
where the tired atheletes will
be asked to complete 25
pushups, 50 curlups, '20
burpees, 50 ball squeezes, 20
kangaroo hops and an up-and
under hurdle run.
Competitors may enter the
race as individual athletes or in
teams comprised of three per
sons. The teams may consist of
all males, all females, or mem
bers of both sexes.
In team competition, each
member will be expected to
participate in two of the six
events, although these events
need not be in sequence. The
first team member will receive
a tag or marker which must be
passed along in turn to the oth
er teammates at the comple

tion of each event.
Prizes donated by local com
panies and intramural points (if
applicable) will be awarded to
the winners and all participants
will receive certificates.
The competition is the brain
child of physical education in
structor Jack Martin. Martin,
who teaches a course in "Op
timal Health and Fitness" to 150
students this quarter, present
ed the project as one of two
educational activities which
the class will sponsor in May.
The class is offered as both a
physical education course as
well as an instructional course
in the Family, Community, and
Preventive Medicine program.
His students will also put on a
campus health fair on May 5 to
spur community awareness of

health and fitness.
Individuals or groups who
are interested in competing in
the race are advised to advance
register. Entry forms may be
obtained in the athletic depar
ment or from the intra-mural
director. Any further questions
should be directed to Kevin
MacGuilivry in the intra-mural
office located in the Encina
Gym.
Martin, who expects about
1000 entrants in the Challenge,
said he hopes that the entire
Stanford community will par
ticipate.
"I hope that everyone will
come out, not to win a big
prize, but to have a good
time," he added.
