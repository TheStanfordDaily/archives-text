# High school jocks still battle

Intramural athletics on cam
pus can be characterized by
the phrase "winning isn't ev
erything, but neither is losing."
Instead, a combination of fun
and excitement prevails
throughout the competitions
and everyone involved in the
events has a good time. Two
student-athletes who typify
this spirit are Max Scheder of
the Sigma Chi fraternity and
Kelly McCown of Branner Hall.
Scheder, an undeclared
sophomore who plans to major
in industrial engineering, has
participated in intramural (IM)
football, volleyball — two man,
four man and six man — soc
cer, tennis, foosball, racquet
ball, handball, ultimate frisbee
and softball in the past three
quarters. All were at the "B"
league level except soccer, in
which he participated in the
"A" league.
Presently he is the IM chair
man of Sigma Chi. In this post
he organizes the fraternity's
teams, appoints captains for
each team sport and tries to
make sure that everyone who
signed up shows up at the
games.
Scheder explained the ap
peal of the IM participation. "I
don't like to run,"he said, "but
I do like the exercise" involved
in intramural sports. He also
participates in intramurals be
cause they offer a choice in the
level of competition ("A","B"
and "C" leagues) at which one
can play, since, as he said, "I
don't consider myself good at
any one sport." Thus, Scheder
said, an athlete can find com
petition in a particular sport at
his or her own level.
Scheder played some of the

same sports in high school —
soccer and tennis — and he
compares IM's here favorably
with the sports he played at the
high school level and even with
some intercollegiate athletic
competition. For instance, in
discussing "A" league soccer
he said, "If you got the better
players together in "A" league
you could have a good in
tercollegiate team." He com
mented, however, there are
just so many good athletes at
Stanford that not all who want
to can participate at the in
tercollegiate level.
According to Scheder, the
intramural sports are played
primarily for fun. "I think they
should be played for fun —
there's no doubt about it.
That's what's good about IMs."
There is, however, a level of
competition in which "A"
league, as the highest level, is
most intense.
"A" league is most com
petitive in this respect because
it has, generally, the best
players, and he said that this
leads to a team putting more
effort into winning. As to
whether this was a positive or
negative aspect of the pro
gram, Scheder said " It's great
that there is somewhere for
people to play; often athletes
in "A" league have tried out for
sports on the varsity level and
have not made it; thus IMs give
them a chance to play."
Kelly McCown, a freshman
whose major is undeclared but
who might possibly major in
Human Biology, was the over
all winner of the IM gymnastics
tournament, which was held
on a single day in Encina Gym
nasium. She participated in
four events: the floor exercise,

the balance beam, the uneven
parallel bars and the run and
vault. She was awarded first
place honors in both the vault
and the uneven bars.
McCown's participation in
gymnastics dates back to her
high school career, where she
competed on her high school
varsity ieam for four years.
Comparing her high school
competition to her intramural
participation, she noted that
high school was more intense
than the IMs, but that the IMs
"were a lot of fun," echoing
Scheder's comments.
To help prepare for the IM
meet, McCown took an ad
vanced gymnastics class here,
which was taught by Sadao
Hamada, director of men's
gymnastics and Jacqueline
Walker, director of women's
gymnastics.
Scheder and McCown are
just two of the 5000 participants
in this year's intramural pro
gram who are enjoying the
benefits of such athletic com
petition.

ALL WASHED UP? — Frustrated high school athletes re
ceive the opportunity to demonstrate their prowess
through participation in IM sports such as softball, the
spring's largest attraction.
