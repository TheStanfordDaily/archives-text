Softball has probably the largest spring intramural follow
ing. In addition to the All-Women competition, the All-
University offers play in the "A", "B", and Coed levels.
Women play a six inning game, but all other legal games are
seven innings long. Coed temas must consist of five males
and four females. Teams are required to alternate males and
females in the batting order.
No base stealing is permitted in an IM softball game. A
runner is not allowed to leave the base until the ball crosses
the plate. Furthermore, players are prohibited from bunt
ing, and any swing which is not clean results in an out. A bat
ter is immediately caiied out after three strikes whether the
catcher holds the third strike or not.
A pitch isdedared legal by the umpire as long as the ball is
pitched underhand to the batter at a moderate rate of
speed. No limit is given to the height of the pitch.
The "A" league softball champion team is awarded 30
points while the "B" league winner will receive 18 points.
