# Horseshoes
## 
### 
Intramural horseshoes are played in a single elimination
tournament format. Each horseshoe team consists of four
competitors.
A horseshoe match between teams is comprised of two
singles and one doubles game. Each game is played to 21
points, although the semi-final and the final matches are
played to 50 points. A horseshoe competitor may partici
pate in either the singles or the doubles games, but no par
ticipant is allowed to compete in both games.
Scoring in horseshoes is detailed but not difficult to un
derstand. The object, of course, is to throw the horseshoe
and ring the stake. A shoe is a ringer if it encircles the stake
so that both calks can be touched with a measuring stick at
the same time. A ringer counts for three points, and two
ringers count for six points. If a team has two ringers and an
opponent has one ringer, the team having two ringers re
ceives three points. A shoe which lands closer to the stake
than the opponent's shoe counts one point if the shoes are
less than six inches from the stake. Two shoes from the same
team within six inches of the stake are awarded two points.
However, a shoe must initially hit the pit to score. Con

Intramural points are awarded to the teams according to
the number of participants in the tournament.
