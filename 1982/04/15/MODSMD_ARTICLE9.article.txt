Water polo is played in both the "A" as well as the "B"
leagues. Each water polo squad consists of six players and a
goalie. A match is comprised of two 10 minute halves. Each
team is required to furnish a timekeeper and a scorer. One
time out per half is awarded which must be used within the
first five minutes after the start of play.
The object of water polo is to score goals by shooting the
ball into the opponent's net. The goalie is the only player
who can touch the ball with two hands. He or she may throw
the ball more than half-way across the field of play, as long
as he or she is within the 4 yard line. The offensive team has
45 seconds to shoot the ball in a scoring attempt or they will
lose it to their opponent. If a team shoots the ball, they are
awarded another 45 seconds to shoot it again. A ball is called
out of bounds if it hits the wall or goes behind the goal line.
Official NCAA water polo rules apply except as indicated
above.
After a foul, the ball must be put into play by dropping it
in the water or by throwing it up into the air within three
seconds. Some common fouls include holding, sinking, or
pulling an opponent who is not in possession of the ball.
Kicking or striking an opponent is also illegal. A penalty
throw is awarded to an offensive player is fouled inside the
penalty throw zone controlling the ball and facing the goal.
Twenty points are given to the winner of the "A" division
while the "B" league champion recieves 10IM points.
