) ESTRELLITA J
1 RESTAURANT 1
) The Stanford Daily says: )
J "La Estrellita features a classic Mexican J
1 menu which includes everything from 1
# exquisite tacos to exotic dishes like chalupas. 112
\ The restaurant specializes in five different V
/ kinds of burritos. Tnese are not, however, the /
\ average Taco Bell variety which can be eaten |
| in four bites. These burritos are well over a (
1 foot long and a meal by themselves. In l
| addition to their famous burritos, the owner |
1 recommends suizas, enchiladas made with J
112 chile sauce and covered with guacamole and |
1 sour cream; chimichangas, a flour tortilla 1
112 filled with shredded beef and topped with |
1 guacamole and sour cream; and for 1
I vegetarians, one of their many tostadas, all 1
1 served on large platters in very generous 1
I portions guaranteed to satisfy even big t
J appetites. 1
I This restaurant has an informal, relaxed I
J atmosphere. The white-walled interior, J
\ candlelit tables and handmade Mexican decor \
i create the unpretentious ambience found J
\ south of the border. We highly recommed » 1
I Estrellita.' J
