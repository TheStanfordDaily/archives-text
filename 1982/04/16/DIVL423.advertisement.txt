The Sperry TopSider" ot
Espadrilles
When we sat down to design our
Espadrilles, we didn'tiust copy the
crowd. We designed superior foot
wear that is unique from anything
else in its category. After all, they
were going to bear the Sperry
Top Sider name.
So you II find that our Espadrilles
aren t /ust light and pretty-they
boast a more fashionable, durable
cotton twill fabric rather than simple
sailcloth. The vamp and collar have a
ribbon lining to retain shape and fit.
And like all Sperry lop Siders" they V j K
feature our authentic non-skid sole.
