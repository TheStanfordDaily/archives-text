# BET'M noses out CCLW; Option A breezes
## Refundable assessment plan wins 
### Jeff Biddulph 
By an overwhelming vote students
have expressed their preference for a
fee assessment system which would
allow them to collect refunds only if
they voted in the election which
levied those fees, father than a man
datory fee system, the ASSU an
nounced this morning.
The mandate voiced by the victory
of Option A is expected to prompt
the senate to place a constitutional
amendment on the April 28 and 29
ballot which would create a binding
system.
Option A received a massive 2127
votes to Option B's 491.
The Program Fee, which funds
small student organizations, was de
feated because only about 19.5 per
cent of the student body voted —
either "yes" or "no" — on the pro
posal. 20 percent of the student body
needed to vote for the Program Fee
for it to pass. Had 78 more students
voted the Program Fee would have
passed.
The Program Fee received 1708
"yes" votes to 494 "no" votes.
All three amendments to the sen
ate constitution passed by large
margins.
Results from an expected 50 voters
at Stanford-in-Florence are due to ar
rive later today, but these results will
not affect significantly any of the
above tallies.
Senate Bill RU 16, which will pro
vide greater continuity of leadership
in the senate's nominations commit
tee, passed with 1473 "yes" votes to
184 "no" votes. Senate Bill RU 20
which will protect the ASSU's tax-ex
empt status, was approved with 1599
"yes" votes to 102 "no" votes, and
Senate Bill RY 18, which will allow
new senate officers to be transferred
more smoothly into their positions
by overlapping the present officers'
term with the new officers, received
1549 "yes" votes to 176 "no" votes.
Each of the amendments needed ap
proval by two-thirds of the student
body.
Option A represents a system
which would allow students to col
lect refunds on their fee assessments
only if they vote and would also
assess association fees every quarter
for the support of small student or
ganizations. Option A will also allow
people who were not registered in
the quarter that the election was held
to receive a refund.
Supporters hope that it would
cause more people to vote and re
duce the number of assessments
which pass because voters might
consider more carefully the options
before voting.
Also, Option A would reduce the
number of people who get refunds,
therefore making it easier for groups
to plan budgets in advance, accord
ing to supporters. They also hope
that, since people are voting more

carefully, fewer will ask for refunds
once the assessment passes.
Option B would have abolished
the present fee collection system, not
allowing students to claim refunds at
all.
Option B would have given cam
pus groups a fixed amount of money,
therefore facilitating budget plan
ning, but opponents said that very
few assessments would pass because
students would not be able to
"censor" a group if they do not agree
with its activities by collecting re
funds.
The present fee assessment system
has drawn criticism and prompted re
form measures because more than 40
percent of the student body re
quested fee assessment refunds last
quarter, even though the student
vote had approved the 20 groups
which received fee assessments.
Thhus, many people decided to get
all or part of thfeir assessments back, a
problem which caused budget defi
cits in groups which did not
anticipated assessment money.
The Program Fee would have pro
vided operational and programming
expenses to smaller student or
ganizations.
ASSU officials say that the Program
Fee will appear on the April 28 and 29
ballot, because enough voters did
not support it in this election. But
there is some question as to whether
the ASSU constitution allows an or
ganization which has been defeated
to appear on another ballot request
ing the same amount of funds in the
same quarter.
