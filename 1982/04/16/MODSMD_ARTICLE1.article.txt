allow them to collect refunds only if
they voted in the election which
levied those fees, father than a man
datory fee system, the ASSU an
nounced this morning.
The mandate voiced by the victory
of Option A is expected to prompt
the senate to place a constitutional
amendment on the April 28 and 29
ballot which would create a binding
system.
Option A received a massive 2127
votes to Option B's 491.
The Program Fee, which funds
small student organizations, was de
feated because only about 19.5 per
cent of the student body voted —
either "yes" or "no" — on the pro
posal. 20 percent of the student body
needed to vote for the Program Fee
for it to pass. Had 78 more students
voted the Program Fee would have
passed.
The Program Fee received 1708
"yes" votes to 494 "no" votes.
All three amendments to the sen
ate constitution passed by large
margins.
Results from an expected 50 voters
