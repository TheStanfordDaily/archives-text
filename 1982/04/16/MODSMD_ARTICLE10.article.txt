## Joyce Lucas Clark Keep ERA 
### 
I would like to make a few parting
comments about my old friend, the
Equal Rights Amendment. I still hope
that my friend succeeds in being rati
fied, but realistically, I think she faces
the worst case of backlash against
women that the women's movement
has ever seen.
To quote the ERA: "Equality of
rights under the law shall not be de
nied or abridged by the United
States." In my personal surveys I have
found that nine out of 10 people who
are against the ERA have never read
it. That they can be against something
that represents women's rights
without ever having taken the trou
ble to read it, tells me a lot about their
attitude toward women and it does
not suggest indifference; it suggests
enmity.

"Equality of rights
under the law shall
not be denied or
abridged by the
United States or by
any State on account
of sex/'

There has been, even among wom
en's leaders, a lot of mumbling about
the "ambiguous wording" of the
ERA. Read it! There is nothing am
biguous about it. It is paraphrased
frpm the 14th amendment, which is
also clear as stated.
There have also been assertions
that the courts will interpret the ERA
to mean all sorts of disruptive things
that will alter the status quo between
the sexes. To answer this, I would
draw analogies to the First and 13th
amendments to the U.S. constitution.
The first has been interpreted, rein
terpreted and misinterpreted by the
courts many times, yet we certainly
cPuld not have the free country that
we have without freedom of speech.
Where would we be if the states had
failed to ratify for fear of the courts'
interpretations? The 13th amend
ment abolished slavery and was at
tended by the greatest disruption of
the status quo that the country has
ever seen. Would you serious/y care
to reverse that decision? Right is right
and I cannot fathom the person who
seriously believes that women are
not entitled to "equality of rights un
der the law," which is all, repeat all
that the ERA prescribes.
I suppose that the argument that
women already have enough equal
ity must also be dealt with. (Isn't that
a contradiction in terms?) In fact I
hear over and over that women
"never had it so good." Yet, we got
the vote (19th amendment) in 1920.
My mother was already born then, so
I am the first woman in family to be
born with the right to vote.
A mere 15 years ago state laws in
California prevented me from taking
certain jobs because of my sex. As re
cently as five years ago I was denied a
job for which I was qualified, admit
tedly because of my sex. We never
had it so good? We haven't had it
long enough to tell! And, i submit,
we are rapidly losing ground due to
backlash.
We have fought for years to have
legal pontrol over our own bodies,
yet the anti-abortion movement
seems to be gaining around and it
threatens what we thought was a
hard-earned victory — access to safe
and legal abortion. President Ronald
Reagan now suggests that Planned
Parenthood and similar organiza-

their daughters have sought pre
scription birth-control measures.
Notice that there is no similar sugges
tion that pharmacies notify parents
when their minor sons purchase con
doms and that, already, condoms are
non-prescription.
So, the ERA is unnecessary in light
of, the current progress of the wom
en's movement? No, it is absolutely
necessary to give some degree of
permanence to the progress already
made and to stand firm in the face of
the anti-women's movement that is
emerging.

I would like to make a few parting
comments about my old friend, the
Equal Rights Amendment. I still hope
that my friend succeeds in being rati
fied, but realistically, I think she faces
the worst case of backlash against
women that the women's movement
has ever seen.
To quote the ERA: "Equality of
rights under the law shall not be de
nied or abridged by the United
States." In my personal surveys I have
found that nine out of 10 people who
are against the ERA have never read
it. That they can be against something
that represents women's rights
without ever having taken the trou
ble to read it, tells me a lot about their
attitude toward women and it does
not suggest indifference; it suggests
enmity.

"Equality of rights
under the law shall
not be denied or
abridged by the
United States or by
any State on account
of sex/'

There has been, even among wom
en's leaders, a lot of mumbling about
the "ambiguous wording" of the
ERA. Read it! There is nothing am
biguous about it. It is paraphrased
frpm the 14th amendment, which is
also clear as stated.
There have also been assertions
that the courts will interpret the ERA
to mean all sorts of disruptive things
that will alter the status quo between
the sexes. To answer this, I would
draw analogies to the First and 13th
amendments to the U.S. constitution.
The first has been interpreted, rein
terpreted and misinterpreted by the
courts many times, yet we certainly
cPuld not have the free country that
we have without freedom of speech.
Where would we be if the states had
failed to ratify for fear of the courts'
interpretations? The 13th amend
ment abolished slavery and was at
tended by the greatest disruption of
the status quo that the country has
ever seen. Would you serious/y care
to reverse that decision? Right is right
and I cannot fathom the person who
seriously believes that women are
not entitled to "equality of rights un
der the law," which is all, repeat all
that the ERA prescribes.
I suppose that the argument that
women already have enough equal
ity must also be dealt with. (Isn't that
a contradiction in terms?) In fact I
hear over and over that women
"never had it so good." Yet, we got
the vote (19th amendment) in 1920.
My mother was already born then, so
I am the first woman in family to be
born with the right to vote.
A mere 15 years ago state laws in
California prevented me from taking
certain jobs because of my sex. As re
cently as five years ago I was denied a
job for which I was qualified, admit
tedly because of my sex. We never
had it so good? We haven't had it
long enough to tell! And, i submit,
we are rapidly losing ground due to
backlash.
We have fought for years to have
legal pontrol over our own bodies,
yet the anti-abortion movement
seems to be gaining around and it
threatens what we thought was a
hard-earned victory — access to safe
and legal abortion. President Ronald
Reagan now suggests that Planned
Parenthood and similar organiza-
