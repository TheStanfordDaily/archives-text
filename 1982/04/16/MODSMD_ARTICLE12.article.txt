## Athletic business is dearly paid for 
### 
I recently learned that Stanford has
succeeded in hiring a new basketball
coach to resurrect its program and
put Stanford on the PAC-10 basket
ball map. While I am always happy to
see Stanford succeed in its athletic
competitions, I guess I am just out of
step with the role that intercollegiate
athletics play on today's college cam
pus. The new coach is apparently
going to be compensated in excess of
$100,000 dollars a year, including not
only his Stanford salary but also the
chance to endorse a line of basket
ball sneakers.

Today the role of
athletics on campus
seems to have
changed radically and
I fear that the
students are the
poorer for it...
Paying Stanford's
basketball coach
$100,000 per year
strikes me as...
inconsistent with the
University's primary
mission.

When I was at Stanford (Class of
1968), I was on the lacrosse team and
participated in what was truly an
amateur athletic program. Our
budget from the University was
about $1000 a year and we had an un
paid coach and about 30 players. In
my senior year, we went 13-0 and de
feated a number of very fine teams,
including the Air Force Academy,
which had a professional coach and a
number of athletes on scholarship. I
always felt that we were successful
because of our high level of en
thusiasm and skill and that what
motivated us was the sense of team
work and fellowship that was the
team's hallmark. Those of us that
played on the team shared a precious
experience that we will cherish and is

very much in the spirit of the tradi
tion of amateur athletics.
Today the role of athletics on cam
pus seems to have changed radically
and I fear that the students are the
poorer for it. If a university such as
Stanford sets as its principal mission
the intellectual and social education
of its students, then the ro's of athlet
ics on campus must be seen in that
context. I can be accuied of being
old fashioned and perhaps hopeless
ly out of date, but the concept of
paying Stanford's basketball coach
$100,000 a year strikes me as being
not only inconsistent with the Uni
versity's primary mission, but also at
variance with the basic value of ath
letics on campus as traditionally un
derstood. If the basketball coach is

worth that much, one can only
speculate as to what Stanford is
paying for the football coach's ser
vices.
Stanford is not alone in turning its
athletic teams into business proposi
tions. It is a complex problem that
vexes many of this country's univer
sities today. If these programs are to
be looked upon as moneymaking en
terprises, let's be honest about that
and not try to pc-tray them as
amateur athletic organizations.
Above all, it is the Stanford tradition
of scientific and academic contribu
tions that has made the University
great; it is not our illustrious record
of athletic achievement.
