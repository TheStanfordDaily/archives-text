## Lab animals were pets 
### 
The Daily article regarding the
pound seizure bill (SB 1438) which
would outlaw the selling of dogs arid
cats from animal shelters for labora
tory research purposes ("First vote
on animal bill dissapoints Univer
sity"), includes a number of
statements by university officials
which are inaccurate.
The officials contend that if the bill
passes, animals would suffer more
because greater numbers would be
killed in animal shelters. How can
euthanasia — an "easy death" by def
inition and in practice usually done
by injecting an overdose of a
barbituate — be "more cruel" than
keeping an animal alive and re
peatedly subjecting it to operations
and tests? Animals are kept alive
longer in laboratories than they are at
shelters, but it's hardly a pleasant,
comfortable life being a research
animal.
Theaimof the bill, though, isnotto
stop the use of animals in research.
It's to eliminate one of the abuses: us
ing pets. When someone surrenders
an animal to an animal shelter, it is
not always because the animal is sim
ply unwanted. Frequently the family
is in crisis; someone has died, a new
child has an allergy to the animal, or

the family has been forced to move
into smaller living quarters where
they are not allowed to keep a dog or
cat. These people face the very dif
ficult choice of giving up an animal
they love. If the animal is going to be
sold to a research laboratory, it
makes it much more difficult for a
loving owner to part with a pet.
Knowing that the animal may be sold
for research, the owners may aban
don the animal, hoping that some
one who cares will pick it up and care
for it.
The contention by university of
ficials is that only 10 percent of the
animals taken in by shelters are pets.
Very few of the animals at humane
shelters are NOT pets. Wild dogs and
catsarea tiny percentage of the num
bers of animals impounded.
(Director of Government Relations
Larry) Horton's comment that abuses
by laboratories "should be pun
ished" is correct, but unfortunately,
unenforceable. The Department of
Agriculture, responsible for enforc
ing proper care of lab animals, does
not have the manpower to adequate
ly investigate the use of lab animals or
to prosecute.
Many abusesc/o exist. The Peninsu
la Humane Society realizes that there
is a need for research involving
animals to benefit both animals and
people. However, there must be
more stringent standards im
plemented to ensure that these
animals are treated humanely and
that they are not taken from ashelter
where they have a chance to find an
other loving home.
