# High tech weapons
## 
### 
The sheer size and complexity of
our military makes it difficult to write
coherently about its problems. I shall
limit my remarks to non-nuclear
weapons and would like to begin by
discussing two fundamental ques
tions. First, has our reliance on highly
technical weapons caused our cur
rent numerical inferiority to the Rus
sians? Second,' should we rely on
high tech weapons to negate the So
viets' superiority?
Many people have started to argue
effectively that the answer to my first
question is yes. James Fallows in his
book National Defense has fluently
set down the main points of tne yes
argument. He notes that as we have
built more and more sophisticated
weapons they have become more ex
pensive and therefore buy fewer. "In
the 25 years since WWII, the cost of
first-line American fighter planes
rose by a factor of 100 in constant
dollars. Over the same period the
constant dollar price of a tank in
creased by a factor of 10." He adds
that since the mid-fifties the number
of planes in the Air Force has
dropped from 18,000 to 7000. But in
itial cost is only half his argument.
These weapons are also more costly
to operate, break down more and re
quire more man-hours and higher
skills to maintain them. The result is
while the total number of planes,
ships, tanks, men, etc., in our forces
has significantly declined over the
last 20 years, the constant cost of
maintaining those forces has re
mained steady. Fallows maintains this
high tech combination of higher in
itial costs and higher operating costs
is the chief reason for our inferior
position.
As you can imagine there are many
who disagree with Fallows. Dr. Wil
liam Perry, (President Jimmy) Carter's
undersecretary of defense for re
search and development, has written
a critique of National Defense that
appears in the msot recent issue of
International Security. The gist of his
argument is as follows:
While Fallows' facts are correct we
must recognize that from 1950-1980
the constant dollar Defense Depart
ment budget actually decreased by
an average of 0.4 per year. Over that
same period, the Soviets showed a
steady increase in their defense
spending. Furthermore, because
they do not rely on a volunteer army,
manpower represents only 25 per
cent of the USSR defense budget
while it accounts for half of ours. As a
result over the last ten years the Sovi
ets have spent somewhere between
$250 and $350 billion more than the
U.S. on weapons alone. (The big
range comes from the difficulty in
comparing the output of two vastly
different economies, but when you
realize this fiscal year we will spend
"only" 41.2 billion on weapons pro
curement you can see we are not
talking small potatoes. As a resdlt the
Soviets have been able to supply
their armed forces with large num
bers of high quality weapons. It is this
massive indulgence in military
spending by the Soviets, not U.S re
liance on highly technical weapons,
that has caused our current inferior
position.
It is obvious that those who believe
high technology has been respon
sible for our problems in the first
place, do not think we should con
tinue to rely on more complex weap
ons. Instead, they argue, we should

put the emphasis on cheaper systems
that use proven technology. Lower
initial and operating costs will allow
us to build more and close the gap.
Furthermore, if the Soviets want to
fall into the high tech trap, let
it will only make it easier for (he
leaner U.S. forces to out-maneuver
them. Additionally, they warn that
given the U.S. military contractors'
poor track record of turning prom
ises of revolutionary advances into
technical nightmares, we should take
any new claims of "magic weapons"
with a grain of salt.
The other side of the argument as
serts that high tech weapons are real
ly our best and only hope. While So
viet weapons are good, they have re
mained five years behind us in tech
nical advances. If we tried to match
the Soviets with lots of lower
capability weapons, their forces
would blow us away. Besides, it is
argued, how can we hope to match
the Soviets gun-for-gun, ship-for
ship when we have such a hard time
finding people to man the armed
forces at today's level? (Indeed,
Fallows admits his plan would re
quire reinstating the draft.)
Cynthia Roberts, a fellow in the
Stanford Arms Control Program and
Perry, now a Senior Research As
sociate with the Program, have been
investigating what technology's role
should be in America's future de
fenses and have tried to break away
from the quantity-versus-quality de
bate. They maintain the U.S. must
take advantage of our technical ex
pertise, but we must do so where it
will have the greatest impact and we
cannot ignore that shear numbers
are important in certain areas. They
see great potential in using micro
electronics to improve the accuracy
of artfi-tank percision guided muni
tions (PGMs) and thus offset four-to
one Soviet advantage in tanks. They
have also concluded that the U.S.
must avoid large numerical dis
parities in the area of tactical aircraft.
Even the most capable U.S. fighters
are sitting ducks in four-on-one
dogfights. "F-16s procured in large
quantities may be preferable to
fewer numbers of the more for
midable F-15, if the F-16s are
equjpped yyitb improved air-to-air
missiles." They also suggest.using im- j
proved electronic surveillance and
communications to keep our pilots
from flying into packs of enemy
planes.
Their approach is not without
problems. The Soviets currently
deploy mor.e PGMs in Furope than
we do and previous generations of
our air-to-air guided missiles have
fallen short of their promised
capabilities and some are priced over
one million dollars and climbing.
So who is right? Clearly we need to
do a better job of keeping the initial
and maintenance costs of our weap
ons down, but we should not delude
ourselves into thinking our technol
ogy has put us behind the Russians —
their incredible spending has done
that. Nor should we try to numer
ically match the Russians — that is not
the way to solve our unemployment
problem.
At the risk of avoiding my own
question, I submit that, while they
are important, neither numbers nor
quality of weapons will be the prima
ry fattor in determining the per
formance of U.S. forces in future
wars. Human factors such as the will
to win, fighting strategy that may
doom us to failure in any major mili
tary operation.
I shall discuss the relative im
portance in wars of numbers, weap
ons quality, and human factors in my
next column.

fall into the high tech trap, let
it will only make it easier for (he
leaner U.S. forces to out-maneuver
them. Additionally, they warn that
given the U.S. military contractors'
poor track record of turning prom
ises of revolutionary advances into
technical nightmares, we should take
any new claims of "magic weapons"
with a grain of salt.
The other side of the argument as
serts that high tech weapons are real
ly our best and only hope. While So
viet weapons are good, they have re
mained five years behind us in tech
nical advances. If we tried to match
the Soviets with lots of lower
capability weapons, their forces
would blow us away. Besides, it is
argued, how can we hope to match
the Soviets gun-for-gun, ship-for
ship when we have such a hard time
finding people to man the armed
forces at today's level? (Indeed,
Fallows admits his plan would re
quire reinstating the draft.)
Cynthia Roberts, a fellow in the
Stanford Arms Control Program and
Perry, now a Senior Research As
sociate with the Program, have been
investigating what technology's role
should be in America's future de
fenses and have tried to break away
from the quantity-versus-quality de
bate. They maintain the U.S. must
take advantage of our technical ex
pertise, but we must do so where it
will have the greatest impact and we
cannot ignore that shear numbers
are important in certain areas. They
see great potential in using micro
electronics to improve the accuracy
of artfi-tank percision guided muni
tions (PGMs) and thus offset four-to
one Soviet advantage in tanks. They
have also concluded that the U.S.
must avoid large numerical dis
parities in the area of tactical aircraft.
Even the most capable U.S. fighters
are sitting ducks in four-on-one
dogfights. "F-16s procured in large
quantities may be preferable to
fewer numbers of the more for
midable F-15, if the F-16s are
equjpped yyitb improved air-to-air
missiles." They also suggest.using im- j
proved electronic surveillance and
communications to keep our pilots
from flying into packs of enemy
planes.
Their approach is not without
problems. The Soviets currently
deploy mor.e PGMs in Furope than
we do and previous generations of
our air-to-air guided missiles have
fallen short of their promised
capabilities and some are priced over
one million dollars and climbing.
So who is right? Clearly we need to
do a better job of keeping the initial
and maintenance costs of our weap
ons down, but we should not delude
ourselves into thinking our technol
ogy has put us behind the Russians —
their incredible spending has done
that. Nor should we try to numer
ically match the Russians — that is not
the way to solve our unemployment
problem.
At the risk of avoiding my own
question, I submit that, while they
are important, neither numbers nor
quality of weapons will be the prima
ry fattor in determining the per
formance of U.S. forces in future
wars. Human factors such as the will
to win, fighting strategy that may
doom us to failure in any major mili
tary operation.
I shall discuss the relative im
portance in wars of numbers, weap
ons quality, and human factors in my
next column.

The sheer size and complexity of
our military makes it difficult to write
coherently about its problems. I shall
limit my remarks to non-nuclear
weapons and would like to begin by
discussing two fundamental ques
tions. First, has our reliance on highly
technical weapons caused our cur
rent numerical inferiority to the Rus
sians? Second,' should we rely on
high tech weapons to negate the So
viets' superiority?
Many people have started to argue
effectively that the answer to my first
question is yes. James Fallows in his
book National Defense has fluently
set down the main points of tne yes
argument. He notes that as we have
built more and more sophisticated
weapons they have become more ex
pensive and therefore buy fewer. "In
the 25 years since WWII, the cost of
first-line American fighter planes
rose by a factor of 100 in constant
dollars. Over the same period the
constant dollar price of a tank in
creased by a factor of 10." He adds
that since the mid-fifties the number
of planes in the Air Force has
dropped from 18,000 to 7000. But in
itial cost is only half his argument.
These weapons are also more costly
to operate, break down more and re
quire more man-hours and higher
skills to maintain them. The result is
while the total number of planes,
ships, tanks, men, etc., in our forces
has significantly declined over the
last 20 years, the constant cost of
maintaining those forces has re
mained steady. Fallows maintains this
high tech combination of higher in
itial costs and higher operating costs
is the chief reason for our inferior
position.
As you can imagine there are many
who disagree with Fallows. Dr. Wil
liam Perry, (President Jimmy) Carter's
undersecretary of defense for re
search and development, has written
a critique of National Defense that
appears in the msot recent issue of
International Security. The gist of his
argument is as follows:
While Fallows' facts are correct we
must recognize that from 1950-1980
the constant dollar Defense Depart
ment budget actually decreased by
an average of 0.4 per year. Over that
same period, the Soviets showed a
steady increase in their defense
spending. Furthermore, because
they do not rely on a volunteer army,
manpower represents only 25 per
cent of the USSR defense budget
while it accounts for half of ours. As a
result over the last ten years the Sovi
ets have spent somewhere between
$250 and $350 billion more than the
U.S. on weapons alone. (The big
range comes from the difficulty in
comparing the output of two vastly
different economies, but when you
realize this fiscal year we will spend
"only" 41.2 billion on weapons pro
curement you can see we are not
talking small potatoes. As a resdlt the
Soviets have been able to supply
their armed forces with large num
bers of high quality weapons. It is this
massive indulgence in military
spending by the Soviets, not U.S re
liance on highly technical weapons,
that has caused our current inferior
position.
It is obvious that those who believe
high technology has been respon
sible for our problems in the first
place, do not think we should con
tinue to rely on more complex weap
ons. Instead, they argue, we should

put the emphasis on cheaper systems
that use proven technology. Lower
initial and operating costs will allow
us to build more and close the gap.
Furthermore, if the Soviets want to
fall into the high tech trap, let
it will only make it easier for (he
leaner U.S. forces to out-maneuver
them. Additionally, they warn that
