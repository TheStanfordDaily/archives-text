## Women netters prepare for Santa Barbara, USC 
### Sid Spaeth 
About the only thing able to slow down the
undefeated Stanford women's tennis team this
year, has been the weather.
The Cardinal, 11-0 and ranked No. 1 in the na
tion, has made a habit of beating good teams
badly, but has lost a good part of their schedule
to Mother Nature.
Stanford humiliated No. 18 Pepperdine 8-1
Friday — their only loss coming at No. 3 singles
when freshman Kate Gompert sprained her
ankle in warmups and was forced to default —
but Saturday's match at No. 2 UCLA was called
because of rain after Stanford rolled out to a
considerable lead.
Gompert, ranked No. 4 in singles in the na
tion, is still nursing the ankle and will not play to
day when the Cardinal hosts UC-Santa Barbara
at 1:30, but hopes to be ready for Saturday's
showdown against No. 3 USC at the Varsity
Courts at 11 a.m. Sunday, the women will team
with the men in an indoor exhibition shootout
against California at Maples Pavilion starting at 6
p.m.
Stanford coach Frank Brennan is taking a "wait
and see" attitude toward playing Gompert Sat
urday, but Gompert hopes to be ready.
"It's feeling better now," Gompert said. "At
first I couldn't even stand on it, but now I can
move around. I just hope it keeps getting bet
ter."
Gompert practiced yesterday with a ball ma
chine, but was not quite ready for head-to-head
practice.
Brennan will move sophomore Alison Hardey
into the line-up at No. 6 and shuffle Linda Gates,
Michelle Weiss and Caryn Copeland up one
notch in the singles to compensate for the loss of
Gompert.
Rather than altering his doubles teams, Bren
nan will move a whole new team — Hardey and
Sue Rasmussen — into the final spot to replace
Gompert and Weiss.
Doubles was the last aspect of Brennan's team
to gel, but he feels he has solved the problem by
moving Elise Burgin and Linda Gates into the No.
1 slot ahead of defending national champions

Alycia Moulton and Caryn Copeland.
"We're starting to get some good play from
our doubles teams," Brennan said. "It was a
question early in the season that I think has been
answered. Burgin and Gates are undefeated and
everyone knows what Moulton and Copeland
can do. They haven't been showing it as much
this year, but I think they are finally coming
around."
Singles remains the Cardinal strength. Alycia
Moulton at No. 1 has twice reached the finals of
the AIAW singles championships and is current
ly ranked No. 3 in the nation behind teammate
Elise Burgin and Vicki Nelson of Rollins. Burgin,
rated the best singles player in the nation, will
play No. 2 singles.
Saturday, Stanford will face the Trojans for the
first time all season.
Anna Maria Fernandez, who has been in and
out of USC's line-up all season with an elbow in
jury, could be the pivotal player in the match.
"Fernandez, when healthy, has been playing
well and could mean a win for them at No. 1,"
Brennan said. "When her elbow has bothered
her she has played No. 4 and not won a match. A
lot will depend on how she feels and how Kate's
ankle is."
Kelly Henry, ranked No. 9 in the nation, Nina
Voydat, and Cecilia Fernandez, ranked No. 17,
provide a solid singles core for USC.
Despite being upset often by the weather,
Brennan has been pleased with the play of his
team and said they are confident.
"I felt very good about that part of our UCLA
match that we did get to play," Brennan said.
"For not winning the match, I'm as confident as I
can be. We could have a few more matches un
der our belt at this stage of the season, but we've
been playing well and the girls are confident.
We have had a tougher schedule this season
even though we've played fewer matches."
The Stanford men, ranked No. 15 in the na
tion, play a couple of crucial road matches in Los
Angeles today and tomorrow against No. 4 USC
and No. 1 UCLA before returning home for Sun
day's indoor match against California.
