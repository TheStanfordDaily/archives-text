### Robert Stone 
For the second time in three
weeks the elite of track and
field have gathered fn the Bay
Area as the annual Bruce Jen
ner Michelob Classic gets un
derway tomorrow morning at
San Jose City College. This as
sembly of world class talent
comes two weekends after the
Martin Luther King Games
brought track and field king
pins together at Stanford.
The lineup for tomorrow's
meet reads like the Who's Who
of track and field. Headlining
the Classic will be the 100-
meter showdown between
Carl Lewis, billed as 1981's
fastest human and Stanley
Floyd, who held that title the
previous year. Lewis ran 10.00
for the third best clocking in
history as a sophomore at the
University of Houston, and
long jumped 28-3 1 /2 for the sec
ond best mark ever. Represent
ing the Santa Monica Track
Club (he has been declared ac
ademically ineligible at Hous
ton) Lewis is scheduled for the
100- and 200-meter events
tomorrow.
Floyd, world indoor record
holder in the 60-meters with a
6.04 time, ran a 10.07 hundred
in 1980, the best that year. A
transfer from Auburn, Floyd
will lead Houston in the 460-
meter relay against the for
midable Athletics West Club

(38.94 best) and the Philadel
phia Pioneers (38.99 best).
The mile run should also
provide some heated competi
tion as Steve Scott and Ray
Wicksell of the Sub 4 Club,
Tom Byers of Athletics West,
and Ray Flynn of Ireland meet
head-on. Scott has become the
premier distance runner of the
land, setting American records
in the mile (3:49.68), the 1500
(3:31.96), the indoor 2000
(4:58.6), and the 3000 (7:36.69).
Scott also has the distinction of
running the fastest mile ever
(3:31.25), but with a catch: the
mark was set at the Queen
Street Mile road race in
Auckland, New Zealand,
where the course dropped
more than 200 feet in the first
400 yards.
Kenya's Henry Rono will be
on hand to defend one of his
five world record marks when
they line up for the 5000-
meters tomorrow. In addition
to the 5000 mark, Rono is the
world's best in the 2000, 3000,
10,000 and the steeplechase.
World class athletes are
listed in almost every event:
world record holder Billy
Olbon in the pole vault, former
Olympian and professional
record holder Brian Oldfield in
the shot put, triple jumpers
Willie Banks and Mike Marlow,
javelin thrower Bob Roggym
and Cliff Wiley and Tony
Darden in the 400-meters.

Rubbing elbows with the su
perstars at the invitational will
be Stanford hammer thrower
Shaun Pickering and 1981
AIAW All-America long
jumper Pam Donald. Pickering,
a freshman, is the top Cardinal
throwerthisyearwitha mark of
207-9, while Donald possesses
the Stanford women's long
jump record of 20-10 (wind
aided). Women distance
runners Patti Sue Plumer and
Ceci Hopp were entered in the
distance runs, but will sit out to
rest for upcoming meets.
Dave Thomson, a 1981 Stan
ford graduate and holder of
second place on Stanford's all
time hammer throw list (213-2)
will compete for the Stanford
Track Club.
