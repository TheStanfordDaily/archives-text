# Card nine return home for crucial 6-Pac series
## 
### Adam Berns 
The Stanford baseball team,
hoping to emerge from the
horrors of its recent 16-game
road trip, will play UCLA in a
crucial series this weekend.
Last Monday and Tuesday,
Stanford won non-league con
tests with both San Jose State
and Santa Clara, and no doubt
Stanford coach Mark Marquess
hopes that this winning habit
spreads.
This weekend's contest with
UCLA is especially important in
the Pac-10 Southern Division
standings. The Bruins are third
in the Southern Division with a
6-8 conference mark, right
below the second place
Cardinal, 11-7.
In recent weeks, UCLA has
played particularly well, win
ning eight of its last ten games.
The Bruins are coming off a 3-2
win over Chapman College on
Wednesday hiking their record
27-13.
Stanford, which boasts a
32-12-1 record, has lost nine of
its last 13 games — including 5
of 6 important conference
games to the Arizona schools
— but appears to be heading
back on track with its two non
conference wins this week.
"This is an important week

for us," Stanford coach Mark
Marquess said about this week
ends series, "because if we
don't gain on Arizona State,
we'll only be playing for sec
ond place the rest of the sea
son."
Monday, the Cardinal plays a
three game series at Sunken
Diamond with 6-Pac leader Ar
izona State, adding further sig
nificance to this weekend's
battle with UCLA.
The Bruins will be a major
obstacle for Stanford, due in a
large part to its recently ignited
bats. Coming into the week,
UCLA had scored 87 runs and
batted .366 as a team in its last
11 games.
Bruin freshman Shane Mack
has been particularly im
pressive in Pac-10 play. Mack
has not gone more than two
games all season without a hit,
and boasts a .622 on-base per
centage in Pac-10 play.
Despite a .306 team batting
average, Marquess is still not
pleased with his teams hitting.
Throughout the year, the
Cardinal has been inconsistent,
although it has gotten some
strong individual per
formances.
Among the top Cardinal hit
ters have been first baseman

Mike Aldrete (.386,12 doubles,
30 RBI), left fielder Mike Dot
terer (.375, 4 HR, 22 RBI), and
surprisingly strong pinch hitter
Greg Lorenzetti (.323, 6 HR, 19
RBI). Loring Davies and Bob
Hausladen have also per
formed consistently well.
Aldrete is currently ranked
fourth in the Pac-10 in batting
average, while Dotterer is sixth.
Shortstop Bob DeCosta has 13
doubles and shares the Pac-10
lead in that category, and cen
ter fielder Darryl Stephens is
second in stolen bases with 17.
On Saturday, Stanford will
send pitchers Brian Mignano
(8-3, 2.63 ERA) and Brian Myers
(4-2, 3.49 ERA) to the mound,
and on Saturday either Doug
Gwaltney (2-0, 5.48 ERA) or
David Harris (5-0, 2.49 ERA) will
get the start. Mignano, current
ly leads the Pac-10 in innings
pitched and complete games,
and is second in victories.
The Bruins will give Pac-10
strikeout leader Collin Ward
(4-3, 4.44 ERA, 72 SO) the start
in Saturday's opener, followed
by Jeff McDonald (6-3, 6.69
ERA) and Pat Clements on Sun
day.
Tomorrow's doubleheader

6-8 conference mark, right
below the second place
Cardinal, 11-7.
In recent weeks, UCLA has
played particularly well, win
ning eight of its last ten games.
The Bruins are coming off a 3-2
win over Chapman College on
Wednesday hiking their record
27-13.
Stanford, which boasts a
32-12-1 record, has lost nine of
its last 13 games — including 5
of 6 important conference
games to the Arizona schools
— but appears to be heading
back on track with its two non
conference wins this week.
"This is an important week

for us," Stanford coach Mark
Marquess said about this week
ends series, "because if we
don't gain on Arizona State,
we'll only be playing for sec
ond place the rest of the sea
son."
Monday, the Cardinal plays a
three game series at Sunken
Diamond with 6-Pac leader Ar
izona State, adding further sig
nificance to this weekend's
battle with UCLA.
The Bruins will be a major
obstacle for Stanford, due in a
large part to its recently ignited
bats. Coming into the week,
UCLA had scored 87 runs and
batted .366 as a team in its last
11 games.
Bruin freshman Shane Mack
has been particularly im
pressive in Pac-10 play. Mack
has not gone more than two
games all season without a hit,
and boasts a .622 on-base per
centage in Pac-10 play.
Despite a .306 team batting
average, Marquess is still not
pleased with his teams hitting.
Throughout the year, the
Cardinal has been inconsistent,
although it has gotten some
strong individual per
formances.
Among the top Cardinal hit
ters have been first baseman

Mike Aldrete (.386,12 doubles,
30 RBI), left fielder Mike Dot
terer (.375, 4 HR, 22 RBI), and
surprisingly strong pinch hitter
Greg Lorenzetti (.323, 6 HR, 19
RBI). Loring Davies and Bob
Hausladen have also per
formed consistently well.
Aldrete is currently ranked
fourth in the Pac-10 in batting
average, while Dotterer is sixth.
Shortstop Bob DeCosta has 13
doubles and shares the Pac-10
lead in that category, and cen
ter fielder Darryl Stephens is
second in stolen bases with 17.
On Saturday, Stanford will
send pitchers Brian Mignano
(8-3, 2.63 ERA) and Brian Myers
(4-2, 3.49 ERA) to the mound,
and on Saturday either Doug
Gwaltney (2-0, 5.48 ERA) or
David Harris (5-0, 2.49 ERA) will
get the start. Mignano, current
ly leads the Pac-10 in innings
pitched and complete games,
and is second in victories.
The Bruins will give Pac-10
strikeout leader Collin Ward
(4-3, 4.44 ERA, 72 SO) the start
in Saturday's opener, followed
by Jeff McDonald (6-3, 6.69
ERA) and Pat Clements on Sun
day.
Tomorrow's doubleheader
begins at noon, and Sundays
game starts at 1 p.m.
