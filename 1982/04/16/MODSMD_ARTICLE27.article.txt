Bottoms up
Last Saturday at the U.S.
Swimming Championships in
Gainesville Flor., Stanford
freshman Dave Bottom set an
American record in the 100-
yard backstroke.
Bottom, who last month
clocked a time of 49.34 at the
NCAAs, bettered his time to
48.94 en route to last Saturday's
victory and record. The old

record was 49.08.
Although he obviuosly did
not expect to set a record, the
victory did not take him totally
by surprise.
"I swam it (thp 100
backstroke) like 15 or 20
minutes after the fly and was
only a couple of tenths off the
record at the NCAAs," Bottom
said. "I felt that if I had a chance
to rest, I had a chance at the
record."
In high school, Bottom set
the national prep record in the

100 backstroke with a time of
50.11, the nations 19th best
time. He was also the nations
best swimmer in the 50 free and
100 butterfly.
Tourney set
This weekend, Stanford will
once again host the annual
Western State Lacrosse Tour
nament. Sixteen of the best
teams west of Colorado, in
cluding defending tournament

champion — the Seaspray
Lacrosse Club of Victoria, Brit
ish Columbia — will battle for
the Norm Webb Trophy. No
team has won the trophy more
than once in the seven year his
tory of the tournament al
though Seaspray has an ex
cellent chance of ac
complishing the feat this year.
Five members of the squad will
play for the Canadian team that
will compete in the World
Games.
Stanford won the tour
nament in 1977. Last year's
squad lost a heartbreaker to
Golden Gate in opening round
action 7-6.
Teams invited to participate
in the tournament, include de
fending Club Champion Or
ange County, San Francisco
(last year's runner-up), Los An
geles, Seattle, Oak Parlor,
Portland, Marin, Golden and
Old Mission Bay Athletic Club
(OMBAC). Collegiate entrants
include UC-Berkeley, UC-San
ta Barbara, UCLA (undefeated
thus far this season), San Diego
State and the University of Ari
zona.
The Stanford squad is the No.
1 ranked college team in Cali
fornia. It brings an 8-0 record
into the tournament, and is in
first place in the Northern
Division of the recently formed
Western Collegiate Lacrosse
Association.

Stanford has outscored its
opponents 114 to 44. Co-cap
tain Chris Romer leads the
team in scoring with 23 goals.
He also has notched eight as
sists. Freshman Adam Tracy has
17 goals and five assists, while
sophomore Tim Romer has 10
goals.
The Stanford defense has
also been impressive, allowing
only 5.5 goals per game, and no
team has scored more than
nine in a single afternoon.
The format of the tour
nament calls for each team to
play two 40-minute games on
Saturday. The semifinals and
championship game are sched
uled for Sunday.
Opening-round games will
start at 10 a.m. and noon, while
the quarterfinals will begin at 2
p.m. and 4 p.m..The semifinals
are scheduled for 9:30 a.m. on
Sunday and the championship
game will start at 1:30 p.m.
The games will be played on
the fields adjacent to Maloney
Field. Stanford's first game will
begin at noon on Saturday.
Skeets signs
Renaldo Nehemiah, a blaz
ing world champion hurdler
and versatile athlete who
hasn't played football since
high school, will join the Super
Bowl champion San Francisco

49ers as a wide receiver Friday.
Negotiations between
Nehemiah's attorney, Ron
Stanko, and 49ers general man
ager and coach Bill Walsh
broke up Thursday afternoon
without a contract being
signed. But the 49ers called a
news conference for noon Fri-.
day and expected to have the
signed contract in hand.
"There's no real stumbling
block," said Walsh. "We just
want to negotiate a little
further. We expect to have the
contract signed by morning."
The four-year contract,
which a team source said was
worth more than $500,000 in
cluding a signing bonus, would
make Nehemiah one of the
highest paid free agents in Na
tional Football League history.
It also would eliminate him
from competition in the 1984
Olympics, where he was ex
pected to reap at least one of
the gold medals that eluded
him when the U.S. boycotted
the 1980 Moscow Games.
Nehemiah, 23, passed a rou
tine physical examination by
team doctors at the Palo Alto
Medical Clinic while Stanko
and Walsh talked at the 49ers'
offices.
Nehemiah tried out for eight
teams and many of them ex
pressed interest in signing him,
but he apparently selected the
49ers because he felt they of

fered the best opportunity for
him to play. But he won't re
ceive the completely guaran
teed contract his attorney said
he wanted.
"We don't have a guaran
teed contract on our team,"
said 49ers spokesman George
will get a
guaranteed signing bonus but
he still must make the team to
get his full salary."
At 6-foot-1, 177-pounds,
Nehemiah has the size to play
wide receiver. The big ques
tion, and the gamble the 49ers
are taking, is whether he will be
durable enough to play pro
football.
Nehemiah, nicknamed
"Skeets", is the only man ever
to run the 110-meter high
hurdles under 13 seconds
(12.93). In his tryout with the
49ers, he ran 40-yards on con
crete in 4.1 seconds, faster than
anyone in the NFL.
He lettered in three sports —
football, basketball and track
— at Scotch Plains, N.J., High
School and was named New
Jersey prep athlete of the year
in 1977.
He graduated last year from
the University of Maryland,
where he set NCAA hurdles
records as a freshman and
sophomore. Three years ago
he abandoned college com
petition to concentrate on in
ternational meets.
