### 
Alouette 401 Lytton Ave.
Palo Alto (327-4187)
Alouette is one of those
rare restaurants where
charming - ambiance and
homemade cooking com
bine to offer a truly satis
fying dining experience.
Almost all the credit goes to
Sophie Nicholas, Alouette's
owner, operator and in
spirational force.
Sophie's culinary ex
perience dates back to her
childhood in Versailles,
where she learned the joys
of French cooking from her
father. She emigrated to
San Francisco nine years
ago, and has been in the res
taurant business ever since.
With only 12 tables and a
homespun assortment of
decorative plates and knick
knacks lining the walls,
Alouette offers an at
mosphere of intimate
warmth matched only by
Sophie's personal hospi
tality. She greets every guest
at the door and throughout
your meal she is never far
away.
Alouette's strongest
drawing card, of course, is
the food. The style is Coun
try French. As Sophie ex
plains it, Country French is
lighter and more creative
than the more formal Classi
cal French style.
The results are absolutely
superb. I started out with

the onion soup gratinee,
($3.50) prepared just the
way it should be — fresh,
flavorful broth smothered
by a delicious helping of
melted cheese. The salad
was equally delightful and
the vinegar and oil based
house dressing was a perfect

accompaniment.
We knew we couldn't go
wrong in choosing a main
course. The menu includes
just five entree selections —
which is probably one rea
son Sophie maintains such
high quality control. Entree
prices range form $12.50 to
$14.75 including soup, salad
and vegetables.
I opted for the the veal a
I'estragon (baby veal poeled
and seved in a light cream
sauce with tarragon, $14.75).
The veal was mouth
wateringly tender; the
sauce, beyond comparison.
My partner's coq au vin du
pays (young chicken
braised, flambed in cognac
and simmered in burgundy
wine, $12.50) was likewise a
master concoction.
We managed to save
enough room for Alouette's
special dessert, le vacherin
glace, a unique combina
tion of vanilla ice cream and
meringue in a cream puff
shell, topped by chocolate
sauce.
The total bill for two in
cluding a glass of the house
white wine (Stone Creek)
came to about $37 (not in
cluding tax and tip). You
may want to save Alouette
for a splurge, but don't wait
too long — you'll be sorry
you didn't sample Sophie's
creations sooner. — By
