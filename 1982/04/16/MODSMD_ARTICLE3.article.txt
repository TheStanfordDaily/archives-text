# ASSU 'insiders' dominate COP, Senate
## 
### Kathy Olmsted Senior staff writer 
The victory last night of an assort
ment of ASSU insiders indicates that
students are either satisfied with or
apathetic about their current student
government.

News Analysis

The fact that three of the new
Council of Presidents (COP) mem
bers and several of the new senators
currently hold key positions within
the ASSU government ensures that

the ASSU will have the benefit of
continuity, yet it also poses the dan
ger that the new officers will become
insulated from the needs of students,
two points frequently at issue during
the campaign.
The narrow victory of the BET'M
slate, labelled the"Club ASSU" by
critics, over the CCLW slate, which
was composed of student leaders
from organizations other than the
ASSU, was not necessarily a resound
ing endorsement of current ASSU
leadership, but it does provide the
members of the BET'M slate with a

chance to carry through programs
they began this year.
Calling the BET'M victory a "major
step forward for the ASSU," BET'M
slate member Mark Epstein said the
newly-elected COP would start car
rying out its promises "tomorrow."
Slate member Yolanda Townsend
termed the election "decisive but
close," and said the new COP wanted
to talk to the defeated CCLW slate
about some of the "good ideas" they
offered during the campaign.
Michael Lighty, a member of the
CCLW slate, said the members of his

slate would continue to work on the
proposals in their campaign plat
form.
"The issues that we campaigned on
remain important to us," he said.
"We'll continue to get things done."
The results of the Senate race fol
lowed this election's trend of putting
insiders into office. Half of the un
dergraduate senators elected have
had previous experience in ASSU
government: Roc Blumenthal is dep
uty chair of the Senate this year;
Melissa Auchard and Kelvin Davisare
administrative assistants to the COP;
Al Taira is an ASSU intern; and Peter
Spivack serves on the ASSU Speaker's
Bureau.
Blumenthal, who received more
votes than any other single can
didate, said he was pleased with the
experience of the victorious senate
candidates.
"I think we've got a lot of good
people," he said, adding that the
number of senators who had been
involved in the ASSU last year would
make it easier for the senate to get
started quickly.
The new senate does offer one sur
prising difference from the current
senate: three female undergraduate
senators were elected. This year,
Bambi Markel was the only under
graduate woman who was a full un
dergraduate senator. The rise in the
representation of women should af
fect the tenor of the policies of the
ASSU government, generally re
garded as a strictly male domain.
The overwhelming approval of
Option A on the fee assessment ref
erendum illustrates the current ASSU
Senate's distance from the student
body. After months of parliamentary
haggling over the desirability of re
fundable assessments, the senate
finally decided to ask the students'
opinion. Apparently, the students

never had any doubts: by more than
a 4 to 1 margin, they said they wanted
their refunds.
The senate will now formally in
corporate Option A, which offers
assessment refunds contingent on
voting, into a constitutional amend
ment to be voted on in the fee
assessment elections April 28 and 29.
The moderate turnout nonetheless
meant that the Program Fee failed to
pass by 76 votes.
Twenty percent of the students
must vote on the Program Fee for it to
pass; about 19.5 percent voted on the
fee in this election.
The election returns were again
tabulated in a style characteristic of
ASSU election nights: Wednesday's
votes could not be counted until yes
terday because the counting ma
chine didn't work and Elections
Commissioner Eric Laurence, over
taken by overzealous secrecy, re
fused to tell the Daily and even two
COP members where the votes were
being tallied. The final vote totals
were not announced until 1:30 this
morning, despite repeated warnings
to the ASSU that their uncooperative
posture with the Daily would likely
result in the paper — and hence
the announcement of the returns —
arriving on campus late today.
When asked why the Daily was not
informed of the location of the vote
tally, Laurence said, "It's none of
your business."

step forward for the ASSU," BET'M
slate member Mark Epstein said the
newly-elected COP would start car
rying out its promises "tomorrow."
Slate member Yolanda Townsend
termed the election "decisive but
close," and said the new COP wanted
to talk to the defeated CCLW slate
about some of the "good ideas" they
offered during the campaign.
Michael Lighty, a member of the
CCLW slate, said the members of his

slate would continue to work on the
proposals in their campaign plat
form.
"The issues that we campaigned on
remain important to us," he said.
"We'll continue to get things done."
The results of the Senate race fol
lowed this election's trend of putting
insiders into office. Half of the un
dergraduate senators elected have
had previous experience in ASSU
government: Roc Blumenthal is dep
uty chair of the Senate this year;
Melissa Auchard and Kelvin Davisare
administrative assistants to the COP;
Al Taira is an ASSU intern; and Peter
Spivack serves on the ASSU Speaker's
Bureau.
Blumenthal, who received more
votes than any other single can
didate, said he was pleased with the
experience of the victorious senate
candidates.
"I think we've got a lot of good
people," he said, adding that the
number of senators who had been
involved in the ASSU last year would
make it easier for the senate to get
started quickly.
The new senate does offer one sur
prising difference from the current
senate: three female undergraduate
senators were elected. This year,
Bambi Markel was the only under
graduate woman who was a full un
dergraduate senator. The rise in the
representation of women should af
fect the tenor of the policies of the
ASSU government, generally re
garded as a strictly male domain.
The overwhelming approval of
Option A on the fee assessment ref
erendum illustrates the current ASSU
Senate's distance from the student
body. After months of parliamentary
haggling over the desirability of re
fundable assessments, the senate
finally decided to ask the students'
opinion. Apparently, the students

never had any doubts: by more than
a 4 to 1 margin, they said they wanted
their refunds.
The senate will now formally in
corporate Option A, which offers
assessment refunds contingent on
voting, into a constitutional amend
ment to be voted on in the fee
assessment elections April 28 and 29.
The moderate turnout nonetheless
meant that the Program Fee failed to
pass by 76 votes.
Twenty percent of the students
must vote on the Program Fee for it to
pass; about 19.5 percent voted on the
fee in this election.
The election returns were again
tabulated in a style characteristic of
ASSU election nights: Wednesday's
votes could not be counted until yes
terday because the counting ma
chine didn't work and Elections
Commissioner Eric Laurence, over
taken by overzealous secrecy, re
fused to tell the Daily and even two
COP members where the votes were
being tallied. The final vote totals
were not announced until 1:30 this
morning, despite repeated warnings
to the ASSU that their uncooperative
posture with the Daily would likely
result in the paper — and hence
the announcement of the returns —
arriving on campus late today.
When asked why the Daily was not
informed of the location of the vote
tally, Laurence said, "It's none of
your business."
The victory last night of an assort
ment of ASSU insiders indicates that
students are either satisfied with or
apathetic about their current student
government.

News Analysis

The fact that three of the new
Council of Presidents (COP) mem
bers and several of the new senators
currently hold key positions within
the ASSU government ensures that

the ASSU will have the benefit of
continuity, yet it also poses the dan
ger that the new officers will become
insulated from the needs of students,
two points frequently at issue during
the campaign.
The narrow victory of the BET'M
slate, labelled the"Club ASSU" by
critics, over the CCLW slate, which
was composed of student leaders
from organizations other than the
ASSU, was not necessarily a resound
ing endorsement of current ASSU
leadership, but it does provide the
members of the BET'M slate with a

chance to carry through programs
they began this year.
Calling the BET'M victory a "major
step forward for the ASSU," BET'M
slate member Mark Epstein said the
newly-elected COP would start car
rying out its promises "tomorrow."

termed the election "decisive but
