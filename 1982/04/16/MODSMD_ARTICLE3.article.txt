# ASSU 'insiders' dominate COP, Senate
## 
### Kathy Olmsted Senior staff writer 
The victory last night of an assort
ment of ASSU insiders indicates that
students are either satisfied with or
apathetic about their current student
government.

News Analysis

The fact that three of the new
Council of Presidents (COP) mem
bers and several of the new senators
currently hold key positions within
the ASSU government ensures that

the ASSU will have the benefit of
continuity, yet it also poses the dan
ger that the new officers will become
insulated from the needs of students,
two points frequently at issue during
the campaign.
The narrow victory of the BET'M
slate, labelled the"Club ASSU" by
critics, over the CCLW slate, which
was composed of student leaders
from organizations other than the
ASSU, was not necessarily a resound
ing endorsement of current ASSU
leadership, but it does provide the
members of the BET'M slate with a

chance to carry through programs
they began this year.
Calling the BET'M victory a "major
step forward for the ASSU," BET'M
slate member Mark Epstein said the
newly-elected COP would start car
rying out its promises "tomorrow."
Slate member Yolanda Townsend
termed the election "decisive but
close," and said the new COP wanted
to talk to the defeated CCLW slate
about some of the "good ideas" they
offered during the campaign.
Michael Lighty, a member of the
CCLW slate, said the members of his

slate would continue to work on the
proposals in their campaign plat
form.
"The issues that we campaigned on
remain important to us," he said.
"We'll continue to get things done."
The results of the Senate race fol
lowed this election's trend of putting
insiders into office. Half of the un
dergraduate senators elected have
had previous experience in ASSU
government: Roc Blumenthal is dep
uty chair of the Senate this year;
Melissa Auchard and Kelvin Davisare
