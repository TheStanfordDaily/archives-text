It takes a venturesome
person to pack up his bags,
leave his country behind
and come to America to
open up a restau
rant. . .especially when he's
never cooked a meal before
in his life! But this is what
Ven Yung Chen did just five
years ago and now he is the
proud owner of a highly
successful, charming Chi
nese restaurant just minutes
away from Stanford.
Located in Town and
Country Village, the King
Chuan Restaurant offers a
small, comfortable dining
area with a delicious assort
ment of Szechuan, Peking
dishes. The decor isn't at all
gaudy, as in some small Chi
nese restaurants and its indi
viduality makes it a very at
tractive spot for that casual
dinner or lunch.
Mr. Chen does all the
cooking, along with his
father-in-law and it's hard to
believe he has only been
cooking for five years. The
food was some of the best
we've tasted, with the ex
ception of the hot and sour
soup which was a bit too hot
for our Americanized
tastebuds.
The service was prompt
and cordial, but we had an
advantage as we visited the
restaurant during un
crowded afternoon hours.
Apparently there's quite a
wait during peak dinner
hours.
I brought along three din
ing companions for this re
view, as it allowed us to sam
ple a wider variety of King
Chuan specialties. And boy
did we encounter varie
ty. . .of the six categories of
entrees, we managed to
taste selections from five
and even more than one
dish from,the seafoods.
After our soup ($6.00 for a
large bowl which amply
serves five), we sampled an
order of 12 fried shrimp
($5.50). (Sample is hardly the
word — devoured more ac
curately describes it). We
were all very impressed with
the light, crispy batter and
neither I nor my compa
nions would have minded a
few more servings of these.
But the meal must go on.
Our next course was the
shrimp with lobster sauce
($5.50). This was also de
licious, the sauce being the
highlighting touch. For our
pork selection, we tried the
mo-shu pork ($4.50) and
again had no complaints.
We went on to taste-test the
ta-chien chicken ($4.75), the
beef with broccoli ($4.75),
and the eggplant with garlic
sauce ($4.00). Of these, we
were most surprised and im
pressed with the eggplant.
None of us had ever tried
this before and we ap

proached it with some
hesitation, but the plate re
turned to the kitchen spot
less. (The dishes we couldn't
finish were more a re
flection of the size of the
portions than of their quali
ty-)
Although we didn't have
room for it, King Chuan fea
tures desserts of glaced
bananas, glaced apples and
chilled lychee fruit. ($4.00
each).
We enjoyed KingChuan's
simple, yet tactful decor, its
prompt service, its fine qual
ity of food and its reason
able prices. And with the
Chens working there — it's
the next best place to homel
