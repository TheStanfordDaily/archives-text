What do millions of Stanford
students, jimmy Durante, Prof.
Ramsey of the Music Depart
ment, astronaut Ed Mitchell
and the owner of Snoopy's
voice have in common? They
have all eaten at Rudolfo's Ital
ian restaurant on El Camino.
The restaurantexudesa fami
ly-run feeling, mainly because
three generations of the
Alfinato family participate in
running the business. (Five
cooks and several other em
ployees help out, however.)
And yes, the grandmother is
from Italy!
We visited Rudolfo's early on
a Monday night, hardly peak
dining hours. Vet the spacious
eating area had filled up by the
time we had finished.
Rudolfo's seats about 80 peo
ple and from our impression, it
must be standing room only on
weekends.
Red and white checkered
table cloths, a kitchen in full
view of the diners and
vivacious employees created a
casual, comfortable ambiance.
According to owner
Alfinato, 90 percent of his cus
tomers return. He added that
many of them are Stanford fac
ulty and students.
Prices were fairly reasonable.

According to Alfinato, they
have not increased in a year
and-a-half.
Pizzas ranged from $5.50 for
a 12" small Napolitana to $14
for a 16" extra large Chef's De
light. And the spaghetti-lover
can opt for a generous plate at
$4.75.
Entrees, served with choice
of soup or salad, ranged in
price from lasagne and man
icotti at $6.75 to a combination
plate with shrimp, scallops and
calamari (squid) at $9.95.
Other entrees included
mostaccioli, rigatoni, lingg
guini, fettucini alfredo, baked
eggplant parmigiana, chicken
cacciatore and tortellini
alfredo.
No diet soda!
Our major complaint was the
lack of diet soda — we thought
Tab was as all-American as the
hot dog! According to our
waitress, Tab was discontinued
at Rudolfo's due to waitress ov
erconsumption. The owner lat
er substantiated this report.
Fortunately, we had healthy
appetites, because Rudolfo's
portions are generous and the

menu is varied and tempting.
We chose a small vegetarian
pizza ($7.50) and veal marsala
($9.25) as entrees. The veal was
served with a choice of min
estrone soup or salad. We
chose salad, which was large

and attractively garnished with
garbanzo beans, a beet slice, a
salami slice, jalapeno peppers
and red cabbage.
The pizza would have been
described as large at most oth
er establishments.lt was
smothered with green pep
pers, mushrooms, onions and
olives.
Rigatoni covered with a zesty
tomato sauce and a variety of
vegetable accompanied the
veal. The veal itself was gener
ously covered with a wine and
mushroom sauce.
A dessert display is visible
immediately upon entering
Rudolfo's. Need I say more? Of
course we ordered the rich
looking (and tasting) French
pastries we had sighted — a
chocolate eclair and a cream
filled pastry swan.
Rudolfo's also features
Sicilian Cannoli ($1.75), a thick,
sweet pastry shell tube filled
with ricotta cheese, and "Aunt
Lea's cheesecake", a New
York-style variety.
We took home a doggy box
of cannoli — after all, ricotta
cheese is filled with calcium
and protein!
Needless to say, we did not
suffer hunger pangs the follow
ing morning.
Rudolfo's also offers a
takeout service, which in
cludes beer and wine to go.

We visited Rudolfo's early on
a Monday night, hardly peak
dining hours. Vet the spacious
eating area had filled up by the
time we had finished.
Rudolfo's seats about 80 peo
ple and from our impression, it
must be standing room only on
weekends.
Red and white checkered
table cloths, a kitchen in full
view of the diners and
vivacious employees created a
casual, comfortable ambiance.
According to owner
Alfinato, 90 percent of his cus
tomers return. He added that
many of them are Stanford fac
ulty and students.
Prices were fairly reasonable.

According to Alfinato, they
have not increased in a year
and-a-half.
Pizzas ranged from $5.50 for
a 12" small Napolitana to $14
for a 16" extra large Chef's De
light. And the spaghetti-lover
can opt for a generous plate at
$4.75.
Entrees, served with choice
of soup or salad, ranged in
price from lasagne and man
icotti at $6.75 to a combination
plate with shrimp, scallops and
calamari (squid) at $9.95.
Other entrees included
mostaccioli, rigatoni, lingg
guini, fettucini alfredo, baked
eggplant parmigiana, chicken
cacciatore and tortellini
alfredo.
No diet soda!
Our major complaint was the
lack of diet soda — we thought
Tab was as all-American as the
hot dog! According to our
waitress, Tab was discontinued
at Rudolfo's due to waitress ov
erconsumption. The owner lat
er substantiated this report.
Fortunately, we had healthy
appetites, because Rudolfo's
portions are generous and the

menu is varied and tempting.
We chose a small vegetarian
pizza ($7.50) and veal marsala
($9.25) as entrees. The veal was
served with a choice of min
estrone soup or salad. We
chose salad, which was large

and attractively garnished with
garbanzo beans, a beet slice, a
salami slice, jalapeno peppers
and red cabbage.
The pizza would have been
described as large at most oth
er establishments.lt was
smothered with green pep
pers, mushrooms, onions and
olives.
Rigatoni covered with a zesty
tomato sauce and a variety of
vegetable accompanied the
veal. The veal itself was gener
ously covered with a wine and
mushroom sauce.
A dessert display is visible
immediately upon entering
Rudolfo's. Need I say more? Of
course we ordered the rich
looking (and tasting) French
pastries we had sighted — a
chocolate eclair and a cream
filled pastry swan.
Rudolfo's also features
Sicilian Cannoli ($1.75), a thick,
sweet pastry shell tube filled
with ricotta cheese, and "Aunt
Lea's cheesecake", a New
York-style variety.
We took home a doggy box
of cannoli — after all, ricotta
cheese is filled with calcium
and protein!
Needless to say, we did not
suffer hunger pangs the follow
ing morning.
Rudolfo's also offers a
takeout service, which in
cludes beer and wine to go.
