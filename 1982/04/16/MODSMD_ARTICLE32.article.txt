## Nick Lowe: you've gotta be cruel to be listenable? 
### Chris Butchko Nick the Knife Nick Lowe Columbia Records 
When bassist Nick Lowe left
the Beatles after his spat with
rhythm guitarist Dave Ed
munds over the band's man
agement some fans braced
themselves in anticipation of
Njck's next solo album. What
bitterness would he show?
W"hat songs had he held back
from the band? How would his
songwriting hold up without
the steadying influence of Ed
munds? What effect would his
new wife Carlene have on his
waiting?
The world held its breath.
;Out came Nick the Knife.

The world gratefully exhaled.
Nick Lowe, on his own for real
for the first time, has proved
himself.
Okay, so maybe Rockpile
wasn't the Beatles, exactly, and
despite a pop hit with 1978's
"Cruel to Be Kind" nobody re
ally expected Nick Lowe tostep
into Paul McCartney's shoes,
but even so there was a lot rid
ing on this album.
Rockpile was a legend in
Britain, a famous bar band of
prestigious solo musicians
which had never gotten into
the studio to record an album.
Last year the band finally got to
cut an album and give up the
nickname of "the world's
greatest non-recording ar

tists." Seconds of Pleasure was
a near-perfect pop/rock
album, listenable, danceable,
and highly enjoyable.
Then the band broke up.
Having left that band of
'good friends,' people won
dered if Nick would keep the
sense of humour and irony that
made his previous albums cult
classics, if his new lifestyle as
Johnny Cash's son-in—law
would settle him down.
A word is in order here about
Nick's songwriting abilities.
When Rockpile was still being
organized, Lowe was backstage
at a concert trying to convince
guitarist Billy Bremner to join
the band. Bremner finally
agreed, and Nick played him a
sample of the songs the band
would do, one of his composi
tions called "So It Goes." As
soon as he heard it, Bremner
knew it would be a hit. Or,
rather, he knew it had been a
hit, for Steely Dan, called
"Reelin' in the Years."
"I thought to myself,"
Bremner later said, " 'Oh my
God! I'm in a band with a
thief!"'
Well, a lot of rock's best
songwriters have been known
to be "derivative" at times- af
ter all, how much can you do
with three chords? So, maybe
Nick isn't exactly blameless. ..
What about his marriage to
Carlene Carter Cash? It seems
that horie life and home cook
ing agree with him, maybe too
much. At the recent Heatwave
concert in Toronto it was said
Nick's figure looked a little full.

In the words of one con
certgoer, "Poor Nick Lowe! He
looked like Nick Lowe's Dadl"
That's a threat. Happiness
has ruined a lot of rock stars-
Elvises Presley and Costello
may be past and future ex
amples and Nick's romantic
iconoclasm is one of his best
features. The man who sang
"Forever and ever/ is just a fun
idea... A moment to treasure/
is just a matter of time" in "Skin
Deep" would best fade away
before he begins singing silly
love songs.
But this is Nick Lowe's best,
most tuneful, and funniest
album. Maybe now a review of
the album is in order.
Sinister on the cover, 'Popu
lar Vocalist' Lowe opens with
this album's bid for Top Fourty,
"Let Me Kiss Ya." Starting off a
crisp, bouncy acoustic jangle,
his multi-tracked voice begs
for, of all things, a kiss! "Oh,
how I wish you would pucker
for this sucker," he pleads.
The song has a lively beat,
and is maddeningly infectious
for such a moronic pop song.
He sings, "Line up the poets of
other times/ Such as Rod
McKuen/ I could feel much
more emotion/ Be much more
eloquent then him." You know
what? I almost believe him!
Aside from the self-in
dulgent bass solo (Interviewed
once on his production tech
niques, Lowe explained that all
he did was "turn my part way
up loud") the other fascinating
idiosyncracy on this song is one
that also turns up on "Too

Many Teardrops". One rarely
hears an over-thirty man's
voice crack so authoritatively
as Lowe's does on these two
songs. Admittedly, he uses it to
good effect, but it sure does
stand out.
Lowe, like his protege Elvis
Costello, is a highly eclectic
performer. Aside from the
pure pop, he also includes
"One's Too Many (And a Hun
dred Ain't Enough)", a live
sounding mambo, and a reg
gae/Calypso version of
"Heart," an old Rockpile song.
"Heart" is weird. This ver
sion is so different from Rock
pile's that you have to wonder
what he's trying to say. The
song, no longer as exhilarating,
is now a comfortable lull in the
album, and, on the balance,
not as alien as it would seem.
Why he chose hot to sing the
more commercial version is a
mystery.
On the Rockpile album the
song was sung by Bremner, so
it's possible that this could be a
message to the band. That's not
unlikely, considering the
breakup. Without meaning to
bring back the Beatles analogy,
there is a song that could have
been written to catch Ed
munds' ear.
Unfortunately titled "Stick it
Where the Sun Don't Shine," it
seems Lowe wrote it originally
to Edmunds, then either lost in
terest, bitterness, or inspiration
and changed the subject. "You
spread it all around how bland
the plan was/ You didn't re
alize friends were bending

over backwards," he sings,
which might refer to manager
Jake Riviera, Lowe's friend,
who Edmunds accused of neg
lecting the band.
As a song, the tune is half
bad. The opening is miserable,
the verses are awkward and un
inspired, but the chorus makes
the song take off "You can call
up the law/ Do what you like/
You keep the car/ I'm on my
bike/ I can't be sorry when
there ain't no choice/Either re
join the rabble/ Or listen to
your babble/ You can stick it,
Stick it. .
Lowe sings 'stick it' many,
many times in the chorus, near
ly ruining the song. One song
this does ruin is "Burning," an
up-tempo rocker that gets off
to a flying start only to run
around on the chorus, which is
largely the title repeated over
and over.
Maybe because they are so
common or integral to pop
music, one undeniable talent
Lowe has is the ability to write
great — perhaps mindless —
rockers, like most of "Burning"
and "Zulu Kiss."
"Zulu Kiss" opens with a
warning over its thumping
beat. "Look out in the jungle/
In the middle of Brazil/ Here
come the man-eating women
closing in for the kill." These
ladies wish to 'Zulu kiss' us all,

all over. Worrisome. We are
also told that "Nobody's ever
done it/ On the surface of the
moon/ But they do what they
want/ So they're due there
soon." Uh-oh.
On "My Heart Hurts," new
lywed Lowe tells us "I get it ev
ery day/ I'm getting used to it."
Good for you, Nick!
"Queen of Sheba," a song
reminiscent of the Beatle's
"This Boy," includes the classic
line "there's a place/ where we
can go.. ." That's a cheap shot,
though. The song also has the
lines "You ain't no Mona Lisa/
And me no speako Itaiiano"
and I challenge anyone to say
that first appeared somewhere
else.
Not all the humour is that
up-front, however. On "Rain
ing Raining," a song similar in
subject to Buddy Holly's "Rain
ing In My Heart," Lowe looks at
all the happy couples in the
world and compares that to his
sadness. "It's raining so hard/
Oh Lord, I wish it would stop!"
Lowe laments, as background
singers chime "doo doo doo
doo," later "drip drop drip
drop," and finally "cat dog cat
dog."
Something which has es
caped mention but which this
song represents very nicely is
the tunefulness of this album.
This song has a pretty melody,
and Lowe sings with a very
clear, pleasant voice.
Another attractive tune is
"Couldn't Love You (More
Than I Do)," a ballad which
starts on Nick alone with a sin
gle acoustic guitar and then de
velops into a duet with
Carlene. The song radiates
slush from the outset, and at
first hearing seems as deadly as
befits the title.
However, once you catch
the words things straighten up.
Lowe is telling all the things he
would do for Carlene, such as
swimming the seven seasj giv
ing her the moon on a $ilver
platter and memorizing Crime '
and Punishment. "With a night
class or two/ I'd master ju
juitsu/ or elementary
digitalese/ But there's one sub
ject I would have to reject/
'cause I couldn't love you any
more'n I do."
Even without his band and
even in love, Nick Lowe is still
Nick Lowe, and with Nick the
Knife he's finally put together
two sides of good music.



Good for you, Nick!
