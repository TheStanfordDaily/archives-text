# Schrader's Cat People seems to be much more dog
## 
### Steve Vineberg The Cat People 
The capacity to surprise is
usually a virtue in a director,
but the surprises you get in
Paul Schrader's movies are in
variably unpleasant ones. This
is a function partly of his per
verseness and partly of his in
competence in the bask skills
of narrative filmmaking. Per-

haps he's simply not interested
in clarity of plot or structural
tightness; but after Blue Collar,
Hardcore, American Gigolo
and the new remake of Cat
People, you'd think someone
would have tipped him off that
a good visual sense (which he
certainly has) is not the only
requisite for good directing.
American Gigolo was a

portrait of an L.A. hustler that
turned out to be a sermon on
the generosity of those who
provide sexual service to aging,
unhappy women, and its end
ing came right out of Robert
Bresson's Pickpocket; Cat Peo
ple is a horror picture that turns
out to be a weird treatise on in
cest with sadomasochistic ov
ertones. It's a horror, all right,

but it isn't very frightening.
The first version of Cat Peo
ple, which Jacques Tourneur
directed for producer Val
Lewton in 1942 (he based it on a
DeWitt Bodeen story), was a
low-budget, woodenly acted
trifle about a woman who
metamorphoses into a cat
when her wrath is aroused; it is
famous, however — and justly,

I think — for the creepy sug
gestiveness of its suspense se
quences, notably two in which
the ingenue, Jane Randolph, is
menaced by an invisible pres
ence (in a park and in a swim
ming pool).
Schrader has reproduced the
second one, in a great baroque
set gorgeously shot by John
Bailey, but it makes no sense in
the movie, which isexplicitand
overblown. The scene also
makes no plot sense, but not
much of the film does. In this
version, written by Alan Or
msby, there are two cat people
— a brother and sister act, Paul
and Irena Gallier, played by
Malcolm McDowell and
Nastassia Kinski. (No one
would ever believe that these
two were siblings; they must
have been cast for their feline
looks alone.) Paul imparts the
story of their lineage to the
previously sheltered Irena —
their ancestors developed
from leopards to which young
women had been sacrificed —
as well as the darker secret that
sex turns them into cats and
that, ultimately, they can only
find contentment with others
of their kind.
This revelation, however, is
contradicted by the informa
tion that their parents, an in
cestuous couple, killed them
selves; they couldn't have

been terribly happy.
Moreover, though intercourse
with human beings supposedly
makes these creatures
murderous, Irena, at least,
seems able to control the
homicidal impulse in herself, a
fact that makes catchow out of
the logic of the story. Since
Paul spends most of his time as
a human trying to persuade
Irena tosleep with him, and the

folklore part of the movie
doesn't make sense, what we
are left with is a picture about a
young man who may some
times be a cat but is always prey
to his own incestuous longings.
Schrader's attempts at build
ing suspense are even more
pitiful than his efforts to depict
the steamy world of Hardcore
or the deceptively cool world
of American Gigolo were; he

makes the familiar mistake of
substituting gore for terror. As
for his investigation of the sex
ual nature of the story, he's too
stolid a director to be much
good at erotica — and in any
case he always seems to have
his sexual wires crossed. In
American Gigolo, he had Rich
ard Gere play the protagonist
as subtly homosexual — at least
that's how Gere's scenes came
across, though that may not
have been the intention of
Schrader's screenplay.
The other central rela
tionship in Cat People is that of
Kinski and John Heard, who
plays Oliver Yates, the custo
dian of a local zoo who cap

ture«i Paul (in his leopard form),;
gives Irena a job, and inevitably
becomes her lover. In one
puzzling and disturbing scene
Oliver binds his paramour
hand and foot to the bed
before making love to her and
"liberating" her. The scene is
puzzling because we have al
ready seen that Irena doesn't
turn into a cat until after sex,
and so Oliver need not worry
about injuring himself; it is dis
turbing because, when no nar
rative reason remains for the
scene, it can only be explained;
by a kinky self-indulgence of.
Schroder's.
With so much pouncing and
clawing going on, and a'script
full of howlers (in one inconrv
prehensible sequence, Kinskf
addresses a leopard on a tree a*
"mother"), Cat People isn't a?
movie lor actors. Nastassia
Kinski isn't much of one, any>
way — at least not so far — so
her performance indicates no
great loss, but I'd give a lot tq
know what the hell Malcolrri
McDowell was thinking of
when he agreed to play an in
cestuous leopard. John Heard
reprises his tired-blood beat bit
from Heartbeat, while the tal
ented young Annette O'Toole
and the magnificent Ruby Dee'
wait around — in vain — fot
something to do. The only ac-;.
tor who acquits himself with
some panache is Ed Begley, Jr.;
who is wryly funny in the small
role of Joe, the zookeeper:
Aside from Begley, one tends
to remember buildings and
landscapes after the film is over
rather than human beings. -

women had been sacrificed —
as well as the darker secret that
sex turns them into cats and
that, ultimately, they can only
find contentment with others
of their kind.
This revelation, however, is
contradicted by the informa
tion that their parents, an in
cestuous couple, killed them
selves; they couldn't have

been terribly happy.
Moreover, though intercourse
with human beings supposedly
makes these creatures
murderous, Irena, at least,
seems able to control the
homicidal impulse in herself, a
fact that makes catchow out of
the logic of the story. Since
Paul spends most of his time as
a human trying to persuade
Irena tosleep with him, and the

folklore part of the movie
doesn't make sense, what we
are left with is a picture about a
young man who may some
times be a cat but is always prey
to his own incestuous longings.
Schrader's attempts at build
ing suspense are even more
pitiful than his efforts to depict
the steamy world of Hardcore
or the deceptively cool world
of American Gigolo were; he

makes the familiar mistake of
substituting gore for terror. As
for his investigation of the sex
ual nature of the story, he's too
stolid a director to be much
good at erotica — and in any
case he always seems to have
his sexual wires crossed. In
American Gigolo, he had Rich
ard Gere play the protagonist
as subtly homosexual — at least
that's how Gere's scenes came
across, though that may not
have been the intention of
Schrader's screenplay.
The other central rela

Kinski and John Heard, who
plays Oliver Yates, the custo

gives Irena a job, and inevitably
becomes her lover. In one
puzzling and disturbing scene
Oliver binds his paramour
hand and foot to the bed
before making love to her and
"liberating" her. The scene is
puzzling because we have al
ready seen that Irena doesn't
turn into a cat until after sex,
and so Oliver need not worry
about injuring himself; it is dis
turbing because, when no nar

The capacity to surprise is
usually a virtue in a director,
but the surprises you get in
Paul Schrader's movies are in
variably unpleasant ones. This
is a function partly of his per
verseness and partly of his in
competence in the bask skills
of narrative filmmaking. Per-

haps he's simply not interested
in clarity of plot or structural
tightness; but after Blue Collar,
Hardcore, American Gigolo
and the new remake of Cat
People, you'd think someone
would have tipped him off that
a good visual sense (which he
certainly has) is not the only
requisite for good directing.
American Gigolo was a

portrait of an L.A. hustler that
turned out to be a sermon on
the generosity of those who
provide sexual service to aging,
unhappy women, and its end
ing came right out of Robert
Bresson's Pickpocket; Cat Peo
ple is a horror picture that turns
out to be a weird treatise on in
cest with sadomasochistic ov
ertones. It's a horror, all right,

but it isn't very frightening.
The first version of Cat Peo
ple, which Jacques Tourneur
directed for producer Val
Lewton in 1942 (he based it on a
DeWitt Bodeen story), was a
low-budget, woodenly acted
trifle about a woman who
metamorphoses into a cat
when her wrath is aroused; it is
famous, however — and justly,

I think — for the creepy sug
gestiveness of its suspense se
quences, notably two in which
the ingenue, Jane Randolph, is
menaced by an invisible pres
ence (in a park and in a swim
ming pool).
Schrader has reproduced the
second one, in a great baroque
set gorgeously shot by John
Bailey, but it makes no sense in
the movie, which isexplicitand
overblown. The scene also
makes no plot sense, but not
much of the film does. In this
version, written by Alan Or
msby, there are two cat people
— a brother and sister act, Paul
and Irena Gallier, played by
Malcolm McDowell and
Nastassia Kinski. (No one
would ever believe that these
two were siblings; they must
have been cast for their feline
looks alone.) Paul imparts the
story of their lineage to the
previously sheltered Irena —
their ancestors developed
from leopards to which young
women had been sacrificed —
as well as the darker secret that
sex turns them into cats and
that, ultimately, they can only
find contentment with others
of their kind.
