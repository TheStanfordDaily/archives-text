Atlantic City ****
Sunday, V». .iorial Auditorium
One character in Atlantic City
tells another, "I never wear seat
belts — I don't believe in grav
ity." It's evident that director
Louis Malle and screenwriter
John Cuare don't believe in grav
ity, either — their movie, which
deals with love, chance, and co
caine-peddling, levitates effort
lessly between black comedy and
pathos, without ever quite settl
ing in either condition. Susan
Sarandon plays Sally, a waitress
studying to be a blackjack dealer,
and Burt Lancaster plays Lou, a
former second-rate gangster now
turned second-rate numbers
runner. Both are better than
they've ever been. The superb
supporting cast includes Kate
Reid and Robert Joy.

An American in Paris ****
Fox, Redwood City
The team of director Vincente
Minnelli, producer Arthur Freed
and studio Metro-Goldwyn-
Mayer produced some great mu
sicals, including The Band Wag
on, The Pirate, and the most
lavish of them all, An American in
Paris.
The plot is featherweight in the
best boy-meets-girl tradition,
and serves admirably as an excuse
for a series of numbers built
around George Gershwin tunes.
Minnelli's eye for color and
movement was never more as
sured than here. This is a Paris
conceived on the sound stage
and brought to life through song
and dance.
Gene Kelly plays the American
painter in Paris; he gets to sing
and dance to S'Wonderful, Our
Love is Here to Stay, I got
Rhythm, and many others. Leslie
Caron plays the French woman
the American painter falls for;
Oscar Levant (who, in a fantasy
number, plays the Concerto in F
before an enthusiastic audience
composed of his own doubles)
plays his best friend; and Georges
Guetary, who gets to sing I'll
Build a Stairway to Paradise, plays
the painter's rival in love.
Plays tonight and tomorrow
with Cigi.

Quest for Fire ***VS
Fine Arts, Palo Alto
A lovely surprise. Jean-Jacques
Annaud's movie is an un-cynical
Account of the struggle of early
homo sapiens to find fire; it is
huge and impressive but Annaud
I has concentrated on a very strong
narrative line. Annaud not only
captures his hero Naoh's sense of
wonder at the discovery of new
marvels; in the best tradition of
literature and film, he shares it.
Annaud has used his actors won
derfully (Everett McGill and Rae
Dawn Chong are especially
good), though perhaps the movie
needs a little more humor.

Children of Paradise****
Fox, Redwood City
Romanticism has acquired a
bad name in movies; it's been too
much associated with weepers
that are more irritating than mov
ing. But Children of Paradise, set
in the world of the theater in
nineteenth-century France, man
ages to achieve that rare blend of
sentiment, lushness, and in
telligence — it seduces the
viewer, beautifully.
Almost incredibly, it was made
in the midst of the Nazi occupa
tion of France; some of its per
formers were sought by the
Gestapo and had to be concealed
as filming took place. Marcel
Carne directed from a script by
the poet Jacques Prevert. Jean
Louis Barrault stars as a mime in
love with a beautiful society
woman, played by Arletty.
Plays Tuesday and Wednesday
with Renoir's classic short film, A
Day in the Country.

True Confessions ***
Fox, Redwood City
John Gregory Dunne and Joan
Didion adapted Dunne's novel,
which has its roots in the urban
melodrama that came out of Hol
lywood in the '30s and '40s. Like
the book, the movie lacks focus;
the murder mystery is carelessly
plotted, the wrap-up is disap
pointing, and the relationship be
tween the two brothers, Tommy
and Desmond Spellacy (a cop and
a priest) is never moved into the
foreground. The director, Ulu
Grosbard, doesn't have a very
good film sense, but he does have
a gift for working with actors, and
all the performances — especially
those of Robert Duvall, Robert
De Niro and Charles Durning —
are so good that the movie may
bring you to tears, despite its
weaknesses.
Sunday and Monday with
Mommie Dearest.

The Treasure of the Sierra
Madre ****
Festival Cinema, Palo Alto
This fine '40s western is marred
slightly by its studio sets and its
stereotyped Mexican characters.
However, the story of three men
who find themselves stripped of
compassion after they discover
gold is still very powerful.
The Treasure of the Sierra
Madre movie furnished Hum
phrey Bogart with what was per
haps the meatiest of all his roles.
Bogart's portrayal of a man tor
tured by the paranoia of greed
creates one of the screen's most
indelible characters. John Huston
directed; Tim Holt and Walter
Huston (the director's father) also
star.
Plays through Wednesday with
Dodsworth, based on the Sinclair
Lewis novel and starring Walter
Huston

One Flew over the Cuckoo's
Nest ****
New Varsity, Palo Alto
Ken Kesey's McMurphy was
the role Jack Nicholson was born
to play, and judging by the way
Nicholson roars through the role,
it's apparent he knows it.
McMurphy, a man who feigns in
sanity in order to be sent to a
mental institution rather than
prison, is a lot like Nicholson:
they're both either the craziest or
the sanest of the bunch. No
where has Nicholson's manic in
tensity been used to better ad
vantage.
Louise Fletcher and Brad
Dourif are also outstanding.
Milos Forman directed; Vilmos
Zsigmond did the fine cinemato
graphy.

On Golden Pond *
Park Theater, Menlo Park
The two central characters are
a retired professor approaching
his 80th birthday (Henry Fonda,
who manages to retain his digni
ty) and his wife, who is ten years
his junior. He is ornery and foxy;
she is affectionate and sage. This
is the kind of movie in which
loons and sunsets and trout and
Jane Fonda's backflip are used as
emblems of survival and longev
ity and marital bliss and familial
reconciliation. To be avoided at
all costs.

Costa-Ga vras' political
melodrama take place in Chile
during the 1973 coup, but it
seems to be set in hell. The film,
made with an open leftist bias, is a
stunning demonstration of what
it is like to be in a country in a

the missing American, Sissy
Spacek does her best work in

Breaker Morant ***
Fox, Redwood City
Harry "Breaker" Morant is a
lieutenant in the British forces in
South Africa during the Boer
War. He and two other Australian
soldiers are court martialled for
killing a German priest; they are
sacrificial lambs, served up to ap
pease the German government

Raiders of the Lost Ark ★★
Old Mill 6, Mountain View
Raiders is a tribute to the ad
venture serials of the '30s and '40s
(it's set in 1936) as well as the TV
serials and comics of the '50s. It
represents the combined efforts
of some of the most gifted
craftsmen in Hollywood: Steven
Spielberg (Jaws) directed;
George Lucas (Star Wars) and
Philip Kaufman (Invasion of the
Body Snatchers) wrote the script.
It has been acclaimed by the ov
erwhelming majority of critics as
a cliff-hanger classic. But I must
confess to a traitorous resistance
to all those good vibrations: I
didn't care for the movie very
much. Raiders achieves a weird
balance: it's exciting on the sur
face but dull at its center. For all
the hype about its adolescent
boys' tale spirit, I could discern
none of it. Raiders was made in an
acquisitive spirit; it's a
tradesman's movie.

Menlo Cinema, Menlo Park
An intelligent, unconven
tional, craftsmanlike movie, re
markably coherent and sus
tained. The first part, most of
which is given over to the
burgeoning relationship be
tween reporter-revolutionary
Jack Reed (Warren Beatty) and
would-be writer Louise Bryant
(Diane Keaton), could stand
restructuring, but in part two, af
ter the experience of the Russian
Revolution, the two characters
are jerked into adulthood, and
they turn out to be fascinating
people whose interaction truly
holds the screen. Beatty and
Keaton's acting may never have
been better than it is in the last 90
minutes, and they are superbly
supported by Jack Nicholson as
Eugene O'Neill and Maureen
Stapleton as Emma Goldman.

Whose Life is it Anyway? i
New Varsity, Palo Alto
Kenneth McMillan gives an ex
tremely intelligent, varied, low
key and even moving per
formance in the thankless role of
the judge in the last 20 minutes of
this otherwise hopeless movie,
based on Brian Clark's stage hit.
It's about a sculptor who survives
a horrendous car accident but
becomes a quadraplegicand sues
for the right to be allowed to die.
Richard Dreyfuss struggles man
fully with an impossible role that
he isn't really right for: he isn't a
physical enough actor to suggest,
in the pre-accident and flashback
dream sequences, that the loss of
his hands has really rendered life
useless for him.
Tonight only With One Flew
over the Cuckoo's Nest.
— S.V.
Young Frankenstein ★★★*
New Varsity, Palo Alto
Mel Brooks directed this
faithful sendup of Mary Shelley's
tale of a man who dares to play
God. Young Frankenstein is
probably the best Brooks movie
— there's a trace of real affection
here, something I've never
before or since detected in the
director's work. The Mel Brooks
Repertory Players are all in fine
form. Gene Wilder stars as the
Frankenstein heir who creates a
monster that looks alarmingly
like Peter Boyle. Cloris Leachman
plays Frau Blucher, a woman
whose very name causes panic in
the streets. And the ever-present
Madelaine Kahn portrays a nice
girl who learns to love life and
live love. The sets, some of them
restored from the original Uni
versal Studios version, and the
black-and-white photography
contribute much toward the
movie's success.
Triple-billed with High Anxie
ty and Silent Movie on Saturday.

Raiders is a tribute to the ad
venture serials of the '30s and '40s
(it's set in 1936) as well as the TV
serials and comics of the '50s. It
represents the combined efforts
of some of the most gifted
craftsmen in Hollywood: Steven
Spielberg (Jaws) directed;
George Lucas (Star Wars) and
Philip Kaufman (Invasion of the
Body Snatchers) wrote the script.
It has been acclaimed by the ov
erwhelming majority of critics as
a cliff-hanger classic. But I must
confess to a traitorous resistance
to all those good vibrations: I
didn't care for the movie very
much. Raiders achieves a weird
balance: it's exciting on the sur
face but dull at its center. For all
the hype about its adolescent
boys' tale spirit, I could discern
none of it. Raiders was made in an
acquisitive spirit; it's a
tradesman's movie.

An intelligent, unconven
tional, craftsmanlike movie, re
markably coherent and sus
tained. The first part, most of
which is given over to the
burgeoning relationship be
tween reporter-revolutionary
Jack Reed (Warren Beatty) and
would-be writer Louise Bryant
(Diane Keaton), could stand
restructuring, but in part two, af
ter the experience of the Russian
Revolution, the two characters
are jerked into adulthood, and
they turn out to be fascinating
people whose interaction truly
holds the screen. Beatty and
Keaton's acting may never have
been better than it is in the last 90

supported by Jack Nicholson as

Whose Life is it Anyway? i
New Varsity, Palo Alto
Kenneth McMillan gives an ex
tremely intelligent, varied, low
key and even moving per
formance in the thankless role of
the judge in the last 20 minutes of
this otherwise hopeless movie,
based on Brian Clark's stage hit.
It's about a sculptor who survives
a horrendous car accident but
becomes a quadraplegicand sues
for the right to be allowed to die.
Richard Dreyfuss struggles man
fully with an impossible role that
he isn't really right for: he isn't a
physical enough actor to suggest,
in the pre-accident and flashback
dream sequences, that the loss of
his hands has really rendered life
useless for him.

Young Frankenstein ★★★*
New Varsity, Palo Alto
Mel Brooks directed this
faithful sendup of Mary Shelley's
tale of a man who dares to play
God. Young Frankenstein is
probably the best Brooks movie
— there's a trace of real affection
here, something I've never
before or since detected in the
director's work. The Mel Brooks
Repertory Players are all in fine
form. Gene Wilder stars as the
Frankenstein heir who creates a
monster that looks alarmingly
like Peter Boyle. Cloris Leachman
plays Frau Blucher, a woman
whose very name causes panic in
the streets. And the ever-present
Madelaine Kahn portrays a nice
girl who learns to love life and
live love. The sets, some of them
restored from the original Uni
versal Studios version, and the
black-and-white photography
contribute much toward the
movie's success.
Triple-billed with High Anxie

One character in Atlantic City

Louis Malle and screenwriter
John Cuare don't believe in grav

deals with love, chance, and co
caine-peddling, levitates effort
lessly between black comedy and
pathos, without ever quite settl

Sarandon plays Sally, a waitress

An American in Paris ****
Fox, Redwood City
The team of director Vincente
Minnelli, producer Arthur Freed
and studio Metro-Goldwyn-
Mayer produced some great mu
sicals, including The Band Wag
on, The Pirate, and the most
lavish of them all, An American in
Paris.
The plot is featherweight in the
best boy-meets-girl tradition,
and serves admirably as an excuse
for a series of numbers built
around George Gershwin tunes.
Minnelli's eye for color and
movement was never more as
sured than here. This is a Paris
conceived on the sound stage
and brought to life through song
and dance.
Gene Kelly plays the American
painter in Paris; he gets to sing
and dance to S'Wonderful, Our
Love is Here to Stay, I got
Rhythm, and many others. Leslie
Caron plays the French woman
the American painter falls for;
Oscar Levant (who, in a fantasy
number, plays the Concerto in F
before an enthusiastic audience
composed of his own doubles)
plays his best friend; and Georges
Guetary, who gets to sing I'll
Build a Stairway to Paradise, plays
the painter's rival in love.

Children of Paradise****
Fox, Redwood City
Romanticism has acquired a

nineteenth-century France, man
ages to achieve that rare blend of
sentiment, lushness, and in

viewer, beautifully.
Almost incredibly, it was made
in the midst of the Nazi occupa

formers were sought by the
Gestapo and had to be concealed
as filming took place. Marcel
Carne directed from a script by
the poet Jacques Prevert. Jean

the murder mystery is carelessly
plotted, the wrap-up is disap

Grosbard, doesn't have a very
good film sense, but he does have

The Treasure of the Sierra
Madre ****
Festival Cinema, Palo Alto
This fine '40s western is marred
slightly by its studio sets and its
stereotyped Mexican characters.
However, the story of three men
who find themselves stripped of
compassion after they discover
gold is still very powerful.
The Treasure of the Sierra
Madre movie furnished Hum
phrey Bogart with what was per
haps the meatiest of all his roles.
Bogart's portrayal of a man tor
tured by the paranoia of greed
creates one of the screen's most
indelible characters. John Huston
directed; Tim Holt and Walter
Huston (the director's father) also
star.
Plays through Wednesday with
Dodsworth, based on the Sinclair
Lewis novel and starring Walter
Huston

One Flew over the Cuckoo's
Nest ****
New Varsity, Palo Alto
Ken Kesey's McMurphy was
the role Jack Nicholson was born
to play, and judging by the way
Nicholson roars through the role,
it's apparent he knows it.
McMurphy, a man who feigns in
sanity in order to be sent to a
mental institution rather than
prison, is a lot like Nicholson:
they're both either the craziest or
the sanest of the bunch. No
where has Nicholson's manic in
tensity been used to better ad
vantage.
Louise Fletcher and Brad
Dourif are also outstanding.
Milos Forman directed; Vilmos
Zsigmond did the fine cinemato
graphy.

The two central characters are
a retired professor approaching
his 80th birthday (Henry Fonda,
who manages to retain his digni
ty) and his wife, who is ten years
his junior. He is ornery and foxy;
she is affectionate and sage. This
is the kind of movie in which
loons and sunsets and trout and
Jane Fonda's backflip are used as
emblems of survival and longev

reconciliation. To be avoided at

Costa-Ga vras' political
melodrama take place in Chile
during the 1973 coup, but it
seems to be set in hell. The film,
made with an open leftist bias, is a
stunning demonstration of what
it is like to be in a country in a
state of seige, and as the wife of
the missing American, Sissy
Spacek does her best work in
years. However, there is a second
plot — the politicization of her
father-in-law, dreadfully played
by Jack Lemmon — that nearly
wrecks the movie.

Breaker Morant ***
Fox, Redwood City
Harry "Breaker" Morant is a
lieutenant in the British forces in
South Africa during the Boer
War. He and two other Australian
soldiers are court martialled for
killing a German priest; they are
sacrificial lambs, served up to ap
pease the German government
and world opinion. This account
of their trial, and the events
which led up to it, is an extremely
"well-made" movie, stuffed full
of pretty scenery and historical
significance; while it never quite
catches fire, it stays well above
the boredom threshold.
Starts next Thursday with

This fine '40s western is marred
slightly by its studio sets and its

However, the story of three men

Ken Kesey's McMurphy was
the role Jack Nicholson was born

Nicholson roars through the role,
it's apparent he knows it.
McMurphy, a man who feigns in
sanity in order to be sent to a
mental institution rather than
prison, is a lot like Nicholson:
they're both either the craziest or
the sanest of the bunch. No
where has Nicholson's manic in

Louise Fletcher and Brad

during the 1973 coup, but it

Raiders is a tribute to the ad
venture serials of the '30s and '40s

represents the combined efforts
of some of the most gifted

George Lucas (Star Wars) and

It has been acclaimed by the ov
erwhelming majority of critics as
a cliff-hanger classic. But I must
confess to a traitorous resistance
to all those good vibrations: I
didn't care for the movie very
much. Raiders achieves a weird
balance: it's exciting on the sur

the hype about its adolescent
boys' tale spirit, I could discern
none of it. Raiders was made in an

An American in Paris ****
Fox, Redwood City
The team of director Vincente
Minnelli, producer Arthur Freed
and studio Metro-Goldwyn-
Mayer produced some great mu
sicals, including The Band Wag
on, The Pirate, and the most
lavish of them all, An American in
Paris.
The plot is featherweight in the
best boy-meets-girl tradition,
and serves admirably as an excuse
for a series of numbers built
around George Gershwin tunes.
Minnelli's eye for color and
movement was never more as
sured than here. This is a Paris
conceived on the sound stage
and brought to life through song
and dance.
Gene Kelly plays the American
painter in Paris; he gets to sing
and dance to S'Wonderful, Our
Love is Here to Stay, I got
Rhythm, and many others. Leslie
Caron plays the French woman
the American painter falls for;
Oscar Levant (who, in a fantasy
number, plays the Concerto in F

plays his best friend; and Georges

Children of Paradise****
Fox, Redwood City
Romanticism has acquired a

in the world of the theater in
nineteenth-century France, man
ages to achieve that rare blend of
sentiment, lushness, and in
telligence — it seduces the
viewer, beautifully.
Almost incredibly, it was made
in the midst of the Nazi occupa
tion of France; some of its per
formers were sought by the
Gestapo and had to be concealed
as filming took place. Marcel
Carne directed from a script by
the poet Jacques Prevert. Jean
Louis Barrault stars as a mime in

the murder mystery is carelessly
plotted, the wrap-up is disap

tween the two brothers, Tommy

a priest) is never moved into the
foreground. The director, Ulu
Grosbard, doesn't have a very

An American in Paris ****
Fox, Redwood City
The team of director Vincente
Minnelli, producer Arthur Freed
and studio Metro-Goldwyn-
Mayer produced some great mu
sicals, including The Band Wag
on, The Pirate, and the most
lavish of them all, An American in
Paris.
The plot is featherweight in the
best boy-meets-girl tradition,
and serves admirably as an excuse
for a series of numbers built
around George Gershwin tunes.
Minnelli's eye for color and
movement was never more as
sured than here. This is a Paris
conceived on the sound stage
and brought to life through song
and dance.
Gene Kelly plays the American
painter in Paris; he gets to sing
and dance to S'Wonderful, Our
Love is Here to Stay, I got
Rhythm, and many others. Leslie
Caron plays the French woman
the American painter falls for;
Oscar Levant (who, in a fantasy
number, plays the Concerto in F
before an enthusiastic audience
composed of his own doubles)
plays his best friend; and Georges
Guetary, who gets to sing I'll
Build a Stairway to Paradise, plays
the painter's rival in love.
Plays tonight and tomorrow
with Cigi.

Quest for Fire ***VS
Fine Arts, Palo Alto
A lovely surprise. Jean-Jacques
Annaud's movie is an un-cynical
Account of the struggle of early
homo sapiens to find fire; it is
huge and impressive but Annaud
I has concentrated on a very strong
narrative line. Annaud not only
captures his hero Naoh's sense of
wonder at the discovery of new
marvels; in the best tradition of
literature and film, he shares it.
Annaud has used his actors won
derfully (Everett McGill and Rae
Dawn Chong are especially
good), though perhaps the movie
needs a little more humor.

Children of Paradise****
Fox, Redwood City
Romanticism has acquired a
bad name in movies; it's been too
much associated with weepers
that are more irritating than mov
ing. But Children of Paradise, set
in the world of the theater in
nineteenth-century France, man
ages to achieve that rare blend of
sentiment, lushness, and in
telligence — it seduces the
viewer, beautifully.
Almost incredibly, it was made
in the midst of the Nazi occupa
tion of France; some of its per
formers were sought by the
Gestapo and had to be concealed
as filming took place. Marcel
Carne directed from a script by
the poet Jacques Prevert. Jean
Louis Barrault stars as a mime in
love with a beautiful society
woman, played by Arletty.
Plays Tuesday and Wednesday
with Renoir's classic short film, A
Day in the Country.

True Confessions ***
Fox, Redwood City
John Gregory Dunne and Joan
Didion adapted Dunne's novel,
which has its roots in the urban
melodrama that came out of Hol
lywood in the '30s and '40s. Like
the book, the movie lacks focus;
the murder mystery is carelessly
plotted, the wrap-up is disap
pointing, and the relationship be
tween the two brothers, Tommy
and Desmond Spellacy (a cop and
a priest) is never moved into the
foreground. The director, Ulu
Grosbard, doesn't have a very
good film sense, but he does have
a gift for working with actors, and
all the performances — especially
those of Robert Duvall, Robert
De Niro and Charles Durning —
are so good that the movie may
bring you to tears, despite its
weaknesses.
Sunday and Monday with
Mommie Dearest.

The Treasure of the Sierra
Madre ****
Festival Cinema, Palo Alto
This fine '40s western is marred
slightly by its studio sets and its
stereotyped Mexican characters.
However, the story of three men
who find themselves stripped of
compassion after they discover
gold is still very powerful.
The Treasure of the Sierra
Madre movie furnished Hum
phrey Bogart with what was per
haps the meatiest of all his roles.
Bogart's portrayal of a man tor
tured by the paranoia of greed
creates one of the screen's most
indelible characters. John Huston
directed; Tim Holt and Walter
Huston (the director's father) also
star.
Plays through Wednesday with
Dodsworth, based on the Sinclair
Lewis novel and starring Walter
Huston

One Flew over the Cuckoo's
Nest ****
New Varsity, Palo Alto
Ken Kesey's McMurphy was
the role Jack Nicholson was born
to play, and judging by the way
Nicholson roars through the role,
it's apparent he knows it.
McMurphy, a man who feigns in
sanity in order to be sent to a
mental institution rather than
prison, is a lot like Nicholson:
they're both either the craziest or
the sanest of the bunch. No
where has Nicholson's manic in
tensity been used to better ad
vantage.
Louise Fletcher and Brad
Dourif are also outstanding.
Milos Forman directed; Vilmos
Zsigmond did the fine cinemato
graphy.
Tonight only with Whose Life
Is It Anyway?.

On Golden Pond *
Park Theater, Menlo Park
The two central characters are
a retired professor approaching
his 80th birthday (Henry Fonda,
who manages to retain his digni
ty) and his wife, who is ten years
his junior. He is ornery and foxy;
she is affectionate and sage. This
is the kind of movie in which
loons and sunsets and trout and
Jane Fonda's backflip are used as
emblems of survival and longev
ity and marital bliss and familial
reconciliation. To be avoided at
all costs.

Missing ***
Palo Alto Square
Costa-Ga vras' political
melodrama take place in Chile
during the 1973 coup, but it
seems to be set in hell. The film,
made with an open leftist bias, is a
stunning demonstration of what
it is like to be in a country in a
state of seige, and as the wife of
the missing American, Sissy
Spacek does her best work in
years. However, there is a second
plot — the politicization of her
father-in-law, dreadfully played
by Jack Lemmon — that nearly
wrecks the movie.
— S.V.
Breaker Morant ***
Fox, Redwood City
Harry "Breaker" Morant is a
lieutenant in the British forces in
South Africa during the Boer
War. He and two other Australian
soldiers are court martialled for
killing a German priest; they are
sacrificial lambs, served up to ap
pease the German government
and world opinion. This account
of their trial, and the events
which led up to it, is an extremely
"well-made" movie, stuffed full
of pretty scenery and historical
significance; while it never quite
catches fire, it stays well above
the boredom threshold.
Starts next Thursday with
G allipoli.

Raiders of the Lost Ark ★★
Old Mill 6, Mountain View
Raiders is a tribute to the ad
venture serials of the '30s and '40s
(it's set in 1936) as well as the TV
serials and comics of the '50s. It
represents the combined efforts
of some of the most gifted
craftsmen in Hollywood: Steven
Spielberg (Jaws) directed;
George Lucas (Star Wars) and
Philip Kaufman (Invasion of the
Body Snatchers) wrote the script.
It has been acclaimed by the ov
erwhelming majority of critics as
a cliff-hanger classic. But I must
confess to a traitorous resistance
to all those good vibrations: I
didn't care for the movie very
much. Raiders achieves a weird
balance: it's exciting on the sur
face but dull at its center. For all
the hype about its adolescent
boys' tale spirit, I could discern
none of it. Raiders was made in an
acquisitive spirit; it's a
tradesman's movie.

Reds
Menlo Cinema, Menlo Park
An intelligent, unconven
tional, craftsmanlike movie, re
markably coherent and sus
tained. The first part, most of
which is given over to the
burgeoning relationship be
tween reporter-revolutionary
Jack Reed (Warren Beatty) and
would-be writer Louise Bryant
(Diane Keaton), could stand
restructuring, but in part two, af
ter the experience of the Russian
Revolution, the two characters
are jerked into adulthood, and
they turn out to be fascinating
people whose interaction truly
holds the screen. Beatty and
Keaton's acting may never have
been better than it is in the last 90
minutes, and they are superbly
supported by Jack Nicholson as
Eugene O'Neill and Maureen
Stapleton as Emma Goldman.

Whose Life is it Anyway? i
New Varsity, Palo Alto
Kenneth McMillan gives an ex
tremely intelligent, varied, low
key and even moving per
formance in the thankless role of
the judge in the last 20 minutes of
this otherwise hopeless movie,
based on Brian Clark's stage hit.
It's about a sculptor who survives
a horrendous car accident but
becomes a quadraplegicand sues
for the right to be allowed to die.
Richard Dreyfuss struggles man
fully with an impossible role that
he isn't really right for: he isn't a
physical enough actor to suggest,
in the pre-accident and flashback
dream sequences, that the loss of
his hands has really rendered life
useless for him.
Tonight only With One Flew
over the Cuckoo's Nest.

Young Frankenstein ★★★*
New Varsity, Palo Alto
Mel Brooks directed this
faithful sendup of Mary Shelley's
tale of a man who dares to play
God. Young Frankenstein is
probably the best Brooks movie
— there's a trace of real affection
here, something I've never
before or since detected in the
director's work. The Mel Brooks
Repertory Players are all in fine
form. Gene Wilder stars as the
Frankenstein heir who creates a
monster that looks alarmingly
like Peter Boyle. Cloris Leachman
plays Frau Blucher, a woman
whose very name causes panic in
the streets. And the ever-present
Madelaine Kahn portrays a nice
girl who learns to love life and
live love. The sets, some of them
restored from the original Uni
versal Studios version, and the
black-and-white photography
contribute much toward the
movie's success.
Triple-billed with High Anxie
ty and Silent Movie on Saturday.
