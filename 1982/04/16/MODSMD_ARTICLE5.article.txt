# EPA voters approve and reject incorporation in elections
## 
### Jeffrey Golden 
The residents of East Palo Alto voted by a sizable
margin Tuesday to incorporate as an independent city.
In the same election, the campaign for East Palo Alto in
corporation went down to defeat. It sounds like a page
out of Alice in Wonderland, but it's true: the same elec
tion returns that show most East Palo Altans wanting an
incorporated city guarantee that they won't get one, at
least for the time being.
There are 15 years of history, laced with sociological
plots and sub-plots, behind this strange result. For at
least that long, the issue of incorporation has structured
arguments over urban blight, community control, land
use planning, the flight of capital, speculative real estate
development and economic inequalities in East Palo

Alto. Many see these various debates as coded ex
pressions of racism — over 60 percent of the residents of
East Palo Alto are black or Hispanic.
While the background to Tuesday's anomaly is long
and complex, its immediate cause is not. Voters had to
approve four separate ballot measures for incoporation
to pass; if just one lost, the whole proposition would be
defeated.
Measure A proposed simply that East Palo Alto be
come an incorporated city. Only those who live within
the proposed incorporation boundaries could vote on
that measure and they approved it 1587 to 1238.
Measures B, C and D called for the dissolution of the
water, sanitary (sewage) and recreation districts, respec
tively, that serve different parts of East Palo Alto. Each dis

trict has different boundaries and each serves adjacent
neighborhoods outside East Palo Alto. People who live in
the water district were eligible to vote on Measure B,
whether or not they actually live within incorporation
boundaries; they approved the required dissolution,
1367 to 1107. Similarly, recreation district residents
passed Measure P by a 1586 to 1337 margin.

News Analysis

But — and this is the "but" that keeps East Palo Alto
from cityhood — Measure C was defeated, 1174 to 1215.
Sewage district customers who live in East Palo Alto
proper approved C by about 150 votes. But Menlo Park
residents who live in the sanitary district voted 137 to 22
against C, and another outside neighborhood rejected it

127 to 72. The negative returns from outside the pro
posed city condemned Measure C, and therefore all of
incorporation, to a 41-vote defeat.
This all-or-nothing ballot approach was required by
San Mateo County's Local Agency Formation Com
mission (LAFCo), the bureau that regulates changes in
community status for the county. Members of the East
Palo Alto Citizens' Committee on Incorporation (EPAC-
Cl) denounced this requirement months before the
election as a covert weapon against incorporation.
"LAFCo did everything they could to defeat us," said
Barbara Mouton, EPACCI spokeswoman and East Palo
Alto mayor, in a talk on campus last February.
Members of LAFCo's staff, asked yesterday about
Mouton's charges, would not comment.
