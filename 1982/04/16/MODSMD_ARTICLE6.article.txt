Argentine fleet may sail south to Falklands
London — British defense spokesmen told Prime Minister Margaret
Thatcher yesterday that there are indications that elements of the Ar
gentine fleet may be preparing to leave port to sail south along the coast
toward the Falklands Islands.
Later in the day, Telam, the official Argentine news agency, said an
unspecified number of ships had sailed out of Puerto Belgrano, a naval
base 425 miles below Buenos Aires, "presumably to the south." Neither
the British nor the Telam report suggested the ships would head toward
the British blockade zone around the Falklands.
After Thatcher's visit to the ministry operations center, military of
ficials released a statement saying that no Argentine warship or auxiliary
vessel had entered the British blockade zone around the Falklands since
it was imposed Monday. The statement did not make specific reference
to the Argentine statement that two of its coast guard vessels ran the
blockade to the Argentine-occupied Falklands Tuesday.
Meanwhile, diplomatic sources said that Argentine construction
crews are extending the main runway at Stanley, capital of the Falklands,
to improve its suitability for Argentine Mirage and Skyhawk fighter
bombers.
If negotiations for a political settlement break down, the British gov
lernment faces a tough choice, despite its presumed military superiority,
however.
The British would like to avoid major casualties, so they may try to
stick with a blockade, trying to starve out the Argentine defenders.
On the other hand, if Thatcher chooses to order immediate assault,
the high casualties involved, could be equally unpopular.
Economy still faltering
Washington — Secretary of the Treasury
Donald Regan declared yesterday that the na
tion's economy is "dead in the water" as new
government figures were released showing in
dustrial production fell in March for the sev
enth month out of the last eight.
Regan, who had predicted as late as last Feb
ruary that the economy would "come roaring
back" by late spring, blamed the economic
stagnation on high interest rates caused in part
by lenders' fears of projected record-high defi
cits in President Reagan's budget proposals for
1983.
In a report released shortly after Regan made
his comments on ABC-TV's "Good Morning,
America,"the Federal Reserve Board said that
industrial output dipped 0.8 percent in March,
with particularly sharp reductions in home
durable goods, business equipment and con
struction supplies.
Production in February had risen 1.2 percent
after six consecutive months of declining activi
ty. But many economists attributed the Febru
ary gain to a temporary rebound from a January
production level that had been severely buf
feted by exceptionally bad weather.
Jerry Jasinowski, chief economist for the Na
tional Association of Manufacturers, said the
March decline in factory production indicates
the economy will continue in a recession
through most of the second quarter of this year.
"Both producer and consumer durables are
stuck in the mud of high interest rates,"
Jasinowski said. "This means we can expect real
GNP to decline about 2 percent during the next
few months. The only strong industries at this
time are defense and aerospace."
The real GNP is the value of all goods and ser
vices. produced in the United States after adjust
ment for inflation. Economists say that an aver
age annual GNP growth of 4 percent is needed
to maintain the economy at sufficient levels of
prosperity to accommodate increases in new
job seekers.
In the television interview yesterday, Regan
said the administration believed that the econ
omy could recover by late summer if a com
promise on the budget is reached by Congress
and the president. But, he said, "there are going
to have to be major cuts made in spending by
Congress. There's no escaping that."
But the president is adamantly opposed to
any change in the third installment of his 25 per
cent, three-year tax cut, and House Speaker
Thomas "Tip" O'Neill, (D-Mass.), refuses to ac
cede to any cuts in Social Security benefits until
Reagan agrees to a change in taxes.
US denies spy help
Washington — The United States has no spy
satellites operating over the Falkland Islands or
Argentina and could not give Britain such in
telligence information even if it wanted to, ad
ministration officials said yesterday.
Th» officials also added that no U.S. recon
naissance planes or drones have been sent over
Argentina or the Falklands to take photographs
of troop deployments or ship movements. Such
information would be helpful to the British mili
tary effort.
These assertions, given to reporters on a not
for-attribution basis, are part of President Rea
gan's effort to persuade Britain and Argentina
that the United States is not tilting toward either
nation as it tries diplomatic avenues to defuse
the Falklands crisis.
However, U.S. officials confirmed again yes
terday that the Reagan administration is allow
ing Britain to use U.S. facilities to communicate
with Royal Navy submarines. But they said the
communication satellite channels being used
for this purpose and other assistance are noth
ing more than what the Royal Navy normally re
ceives as part of North Atlantic Treaty Organiza
tion operations.
British nuclear-powered attack submarines,
armed with anti-ship torpedoes, are the
spearhead of the blockade London has im
posed for a distance of 200 miles around the
Falkland Islands. The subs are deadly against
freighters, aircraft carriers and, under certain
conditions, even destroyers but have a hard

time stopping small, fast patrol boats.
Argentina said Wednesday that two of its 90-
foot patrol boats had zipped through the
blockade area Tuesday and tied up at a
Falklands port without being challenged.
Submarine specialists said that the Argentine
Navy has little chance of sinking a British sub
and that from four to six attack subs could do a
good job of enforcing the announced blockade
of the Falklands.
However, they added, it is no real trick for Ar
gentine patrol boats to race through the
blockade zone before submarines have time to
locate them by sonar and fire torpedoes at
them. On the other hand, Argentine patrol
boats could do little about adequately supply
ing Argentine troops on the Falklands if shoot
ing starts.
Baker against social cuts
Washington — Senate Majority Leader How
ard Baker Jr., (R-Tenn), joined congressional
Democrats yesterday in shying away from cuts
in Social Security cost-of-living increases as a
means of reducing budget deficits.
Baker's comments came as a surprise because
congressional leaders and White House aides
had been counting on some Social Security cost
curtailment in working out a budget com
promise that would keep deficits from soaring
beyond $100 billion over the next few years.
But any cuts in Social Security have been a
major sticking point for many Democrats, in
cluding House Speaker Thomas "Tip" O'Neill
Jr., (D-Mass), who has indicated reluctance to
accept Social Security cuts, especially if Presi
dent Reagan refuses to back off his tax cut pro
gram, which he did again yesterday.
In an apparent attempt to break this logjam,
Baker said he doesn't think there should be a
"quid pro quo ... a trade-off" between taxes
and Social Security and added that he believes
O'Neill agrees.
For Democrats to take the lead in cutting one
of their own programs to help Reagan reduce
his budget deficits is to follow in the footsteps of
British officers in "The Bridge on the River
Kwai" who became so enamored with building
the bridge that they forgot they were doing it
for the enemy, commented a House Democrat
ic leadership aide.
Sen. James Exon, (D-Neb), a Budget Commit
tee member, also suggested Reagan will be re
sponsible if the budget negotiations fail. "Un
fortunately it's a game of political chicken with
the only real loser being the American people
and economy," he said, claiming Reagan is
even "at odds" with his own Republican leader
ship in Congress.
Asked about Exon's assertion, Baker denied
that Reagan is at odds with Republicans but
conceded that "the Republican leadership is
impatient." Baker, who plans to tell the Senate
Budget Committee go start drafting a budget on
its own if a compromise has not been reached
by next Thursday, said he thinks there is a "dis
cernible desire to work something out on all
sides."
Israel discusses withdrawal
Cairo — Israeli Defense Minister Ariel Sharon
held more than four hours of talks here yester
day with Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak and
Foreign Minister Kamal Hassan Ali in an attempt
to settle an unresolved borderdisputethreaten
ing to hold up Israel's final withdrawal from the
Sinai on April 25.
The two sides also discussed Israeli allega
tions of alleged Egyptian violations of the peace
treaty signed between the two nations in March
1979.
On the touchy issue of the border demarka
tion at Taba on the Gulf of Aqaba, Ali said there
were still more to be discussed but that the main
principles of an agreement had been already
reached between the two sides.
Asked whether the final Israeli pullout from
the Sinai was in question because of the Taba is
sue, Ali replied, "the withdrawal, I think, will be
on the 25th as scheduled and as stated by Prime
Minister (Menachem) Begin yesterday
(Wednesday) and by President Reagan as well."
Sharon, who earlier publicly declared his op
position to the final withdrawal unless the Taba

border issue was resolved, gave no indication
whether he agreed or disagreed with Ali's
assessment.
In Tel Aviv, meanwhile, U.S. Deputy Secre
tary of State Walter Stoessel said he was "op
timistic" that the final Israeli withdrawal would
take place on schedule after holding two hours
of "very friendly, very thorough" talks with Be
gin and Israeli Foreign Minister Yitzhak Shamir.
Stoessel reportedly was given a list of the Is
raeli complaints about alleged Egyptian vio
lations of the peace treaty and a list of "options"
on ways to resolve them to take to Cairo where
he is expected Friday.
The three main Israeli complaints are that
Egypt has not adhered strictly to the peace trea
ty regarding troop levels in the central Sinai
zone, has allowed the smuggling by Palestinians
of arms across the border into the Gaza Strip
and permitted a more hostile tone toward Israel
to surface in the state-controlled press.
Egyptian officials have denied the charges
and repeatedly pledged their full commitment
to the letter and spirit of the peace treaty terms.
Privately, they have expressed their concern
that Israel may be seeking some last minute pre
text for not carrying out its final withdrawal
from the Sinai.
Brezhnev's health discussed
Moscow — Dr. Yevgeny Chazov, chief physi
cian to President Leonid Brezhnev, failed to
show up at a scheduled press conference yes
terday, raising fresh speculation over the physi
cal condition of the Soviet leader. Chazov re
portedly broke his ieg three weeks ago.
Chazov, a heart specialist and member of a
medical team oversees the health needs of the
Soviet leadership, was expected to participate
in the conference and shed light on the state of
Brezhnev's health.
There have been reports that Brezhnev, 75,
had become ill following a strenuous round of
activities that included a trip to Tashkent last
month. In his return to Moscow he reportedly
was taken to a hospital and was said by various
sources to have suffered a stroke that impaired
his speech. He has not appeared in public since
March 26 although there have been reports that
he was seen being driven to various locations in
Moscow.
Yesterday's press conference was called to
outline the state of various health programs in
the Soviet Union, with five noted medical ex
perts in attendance to make comments and an
swer written questions from correspondents, as
usual, oral questions were not allowed.
Soviet officials had made it a point to notify
Western embassies and foreign correspondents
that Chazov would be in attendance, leaving
the impression that he would answer questions
about Brezhnev's health.
Following custom, Soviet officials have re
fused to answer questions about Brezhnev's
health. Blokhin reiterated official comment that
the Soviet leader was merely taking his custom
ary early spring rest.
However, the Soviet media have been at
pains to depict a business-as-usual schedule for
Brezhnev. There have been repeated reports in
the press of Brezhnev signing various docu
ments and proclamations.
Dow rises slightly
A stock market rally late Thursday reversed a
week-long slide despite lingering uncertainties
about the weak economy and unrest in the
South Atlantic and Middle East.
The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials,
which had shed 4.85 points over the previous
three sessions, rose 1.52 points to 839.61. Before
drifting lower earlier this week, the blue-chip
average had climbed more than 47 points in the
course of a month.
Four stocks rose in price for every three that
fell on the New York Stock Exchange.
