Argentine fleet may sail south to Falklands
London â€” British defense spokesmen told Prime Minister Margaret
Thatcher yesterday that there are indications that elements of the Ar
gentine fleet may be preparing to leave port to sail south along the coast
toward the Falklands Islands.
Later in the day, Telam, the official Argentine news agency, said an
unspecified number of ships had sailed out of Puerto Belgrano, a naval
base 425 miles below Buenos Aires, "presumably to the south." Neither
the British nor the Telam report suggested the ships would head toward
the British blockade zone around the Falklands.
After Thatcher's visit to the ministry operations center, military of
ficials released a statement saying that no Argentine warship or auxiliary
vessel had entered the British blockade zone around the Falklands since
it was imposed Monday. The statement did not make specific reference
to the Argentine statement that two of its coast guard vessels ran the
blockade to the Argentine-occupied Falklands Tuesday.
Meanwhile, diplomatic sources said that Argentine construction
crews are extending the main runway at Stanley, capital of the Falklands,
to improve its suitability for Argentine Mirage and Skyhawk fighter
bombers.
If negotiations for a political settlement break down, the British gov
lernment faces a tough choice, despite its presumed military superiority,
however.
The British would like to avoid major casualties, so they may try to
stick with a blockade, trying to starve out the Argentine defenders.
On the other hand, if Thatcher chooses to order immediate assault,
the high casualties involved, could be equally unpopular.
