# Columnist says coaches fail to educate
## 
### Michael Weiss 
One of the major problems facing
college sports today is that coaches
and colleges are unconcerned with
educating their recruits, said San
Francisco Chronicle Columnist
Glenn Dickey last night at a panel dis
cussion in the Rinconada lounge.
"Too many coaches, too many col
leges, when they recruit players,
know that the university is not going
to give them an education and do not
expect them to," Dickey told the au
dience of about 75 students.
Dickey said that he can understand
why there is so much concentration
on winning in some colleges. He ex
plained that in some parts of the
country, where there are no pro
fessional teams, fans tend to root very
hard for their local high school or col
lege athletes. He pointed to the Uni
versity of Oklahoma, whose $13 mil
lion athletic program budget is equal
to that of the Los Angeles Rams, as an
example.
The spectator intensity found at
Oklahoma, which leads to consistent
sell-out crowds, is not found here,
according to Dickey.
Talking about Stanford sports,
Dean of Admissions Fred Hargadon
said that this is "cne of the few

schools where the recruit has to get
the application in, has to take the
tests and has to jump through the
same hoops that all the other appli
cants go through."
Hargadon added that while the ad
missions office does not prefer ath
letes over other candidates, it does
take exceptional athletic ability into
consideration.
"The greatest device any other col
lege has in our conference is to tell a
recruit that he can't possibly be a

good student and also be a good ath
lete at Stanford/' said Hargadon. He
went on to say that the University
loses many recruits through this de
vice.
Hargadon sat on the panel with
Dickey, Stanford Athletic Director
Andy Geigerand academicall-Amer
ican football player John Bergren in
the first of a four-part discussion
series entitled "The College Athlete:
Hero or Victim?"
Hargadon stressed that the corrup
tion in recruiting that has been as
sociated with college sports only ap
plies to some schools.
He also said that some sports
writers, whom he called fortunate in
that "both good news and bad news
is news in sports," have contributed
to the 'hypocritical part of college
athletics.'
Dickey said that due to news
papers' need to sell papers there is a
trend toward writing more about the
problems of college sports than the
games themselves.
Athletic Director Geiger said that
while the athletic department here is
completely separate from the Uni
versity in terms of financing — it ob
tains funds from gate receipts, gifts
and television revenues — when it

comes to admissions, his department
is "married to the University."
Geiger said that one of the prob
lems with recruiting here is that, un
like at some other schools, he cannot
guarantee an athlete admission until
that athlete has been admitted by the
University. "We obviously do identi
fy to the admissions office the can
didates we are interested in," he said.
He pointed out that athletes here
do not get special treatment in the
academic world once they are ad
mitted. "There's no brain coach in
our athletic department like at the
other Pac-10 schools."
Bergren, a defensive tackle for the
football team who is double major
ing in chemical engineering and
biology, said that he was drawn to
Stanford because it "hit up on the ac
ademics."
He recalls that recruiting was a
high-pressure situation in which he
was getting input from his parents,
his friends and his coaches. "It all
comes down to where you want to
go," he said.
He acknowledged that there is also
much pressure on the coaches. "If
the coaches don't produce, they
have to move to a different job, as in
the case of Cal, for instance."
