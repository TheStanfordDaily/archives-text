## 'Hacking' addiction could be terminal 
### Karen Springen 
Shoulders hunched, fingers poised
above the keyboard, the student
looked much like a musician at a piano.
Yet the dazed expression and bleary
eyes were tell-tale signs not of a student
composer, but of a computer program
mer. The student was suffering from the
Low-Overhead Time Sharing (LOTS)
"terminal" disease — hacking.
A hard-core group of computer buffs
spends MORE or LESS LOTS of time sit
ting in front of terminal displays. After
all, the computer centers are open 24
hours a day. And they offer tantalizing
games...and more!
Hacking
A hack. A hacker. Hacking. Each
word, although containing the same
root, has a different nuance. According
to senior Ken Olum (better known by
his user name, KDO), a hack is a quickly
written program. A hacker, which he
defined as "anyone who enjoys com
puter programming," would not write a
hack.
Junior Eric McCarthy said a hackeror
iginated as someone guilty of poorly ex
ecuted, short-cut programming, but
now encompasses "anyone who spends
a lot of time at LOTS."
According to Olum, "Hacking ranges
in use from a general term for every
kind of programming to programming
intensely." He emphasized, "Hacking is
not necessarily what a hacker does."
McCarthy said good programming is
easy for someone else to figure out.
Junior Dan Newell, student coordi
nator at LOTS, "Anyone can be hacking

who's working on a computer that
doesn't have to." He disagreed with the
definition of a hacker as a bad program
mer. "All the CS 105 students are
hackers then," he joked.
"Hackers think of ways to do things
you're not really supposed to do."
Newell estimated that about 30 or 40
hackers are currently regulars at LOTS.
Olum placed the number between 10
and 30.
Hacker culture
According to junior Eric McCarthy, a
former hacker, "there's a group of peo
ple who think, breathe and live com
puters." He described himself as no
longer a part of that culture. "I'm not
really that interested in learning all
kinds of random things about LOTS
anymore," he said.
McCarthy said that hackers usually
start out taking difficult courses and
rapidly become one of the 68 consul
tants at LOTS. "I really overdid it," said
McCarthy.
By junior year, they are taking 200-
level computer science classes. Some
go co-"terminal."
McCarthy said the hackers change,
"but there are some real hard-core
ones."
He stressed their irregular hours
created by the fact that computer time
is free between 2 a.m. and 10 a.m. (Every
student is entitled to two hours on LOTS
per week. Students receive additional
time for every computer-related
course.)
McCarthy said that hackers usually
have multiple accounts.

"The intense people here do all kinds
of things that really aren't related to
anything," he said. He cited a case of
someone printing out an alphabetical
list of laws: Abel's Law, Engel's Law, Pe
ter's Principle, etc. "They do things like
that. They collect all these things," he
said.
"They're addicted to working with
computers. They have no com
prehension of doing anything else."
Overhackers
Newell admitted that there are a few
who spend excess time at LOTS. No ac
tion is taken to stop them, however.
"That's their business," he said. "I don't
really ask them, 'How are you doing in
classes?"'
He added, "If it weren't computers, it
would be something else."
Several hackers described computer
work as a hobby. "I enjoy working with
computers," said Olum. "It's creative.
You accomplish things."
Newell compared hackers to "tech
ies." They simply enjoy their work.
"They're not getting credit," he said.
He also pointed to musicians who "play
for the hell of it."
Hacker profile
Because the University does not offer
an undergraduate computer science
major, hackers must find a "com
parable" field of study. Common ma
jors for computer buffs include philos
ophy of formal systems, math and math
science. (According to Marilyn Walker
at the computer science department,
the computer science department con
sists of 167 graduate students and 23

professors.)
Not surprisingly, hackers usually hold
a computer-related job on campus.
Olum, for example, works at Fairchild
and volunteers at LOTS.
Hackers use the terminals for a varie
ty of functions. For example, Olum
writes papers on the terminal. He also
holds conversations with friends.
According to McCarthy, the majority
of hard-core hackers have terminals in
their rooms. In addition to conve
nience, home terminals offer the ad
vantage of no time limit and no queue.
They can be purchased at a relatively
low cost. McCarthy bought his terminal
system from his brother for $550.
Computer games
Games are particularly popular at
LOTS. Although course work is given
first priority, game playing represents a
popular pasttime.
Games include Fisk, a treasure hunt;
Galaxy, played against other students;
Gammon, backgammon against the
computer; and Startrek, a search and
destroy game. Countless other games
exist and the old standbys are constant
ly updated and modified.
Game playing appears most preva
lent among beginning computer buffs
rather than among veteran hackers.
Olum, who spends about 60 hours per
week at LOTS, said, "I occasionally play
games but not often."
Newell described games as -'where
you get hooked." He said that he no
longer plays games. "Pretty soon you
get the idea of how most of the games
work."

HACKING AWAY? — Many students here spend LOTS of
time pounding the computer keyboards at Terman or the
Center for Educational Research (CERAS). However, ac
cording to some local computer "experts/'not all student
programmers can lay claim to the "hacker" name.
