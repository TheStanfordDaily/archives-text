# Teacher, scholar, historian adds life to academics

### Ted Wheeler 
While most people view retirement as a
chance to recline in the sunshine, unwind
and enjoy the benefits of their labor, others,
including Stanford History Prof. Gordon
Craig, consider retirement a poor excuse to
"slack off."
According to Craig, who is completing his
last quarter as a lecturer at Stanford after hav
ing spent nearly 20 years here, maintaining a
certain degree of productivity is essential to
a truly rewarding retirement. "The country is
peopled with old dodderers trying to pre
tend that a little golf every day will keep
them busy. Really they're bored,"
speculated Craig. "They don't last as long as
they should."
Although Craig officially retired three
years ago, he has remained remarkably ac
tive in teaching at Stanford as a J.E. Wallace
Sterling Professor of Humanities Emeritus.
Craig, the primary lecturer in a Freshman
Western Culture course entitled "European
History from 1815 to the Present," is required
to lecture three days a week to a class of near
ly 400 students.
The future of the celebrated lecturer's ca
reer was put into question after a recent
heart-related operation. Craig, who made an
astounding recovery, was originally quite
worried about his voice. For a while after the
operation, Craig felt that his voice had
neither the volume or the "resonance" re
quired for teaching large groups of students.
"It left me in bad humor," said Craig. Be-

they should/— Cordon
Craig

cause his recovery period was reasonably
short, he is teaching this quarter as was ori
ginally planned.
In addition to the lectures, Craig leads sev
eral two-hour long discussion groups which
are designed to cover various aspects of Eu
ropean history in detail.
Many hours of research and preparation
are required in order to make both the lec
tures and discussion groups as successful as
they are. Prof. Peter Paret, also of the history
department, noted that Craig sometimes
stays up until three or four in the morning
for the lectures. "It's exhausting,"
noted Craig. But being tired hasn't stopped
him in the past and it certainly doesn't seem
to be stopping him now.
Craig's quickly paced, yet well-organized
lectures are anything but the product of a
fatigued scholar. "I love lecturing," ex
plained Craig. "As a lecturer approaches the
podium, he should be keyed up for the lec
ture. There should be a sense of anticipation
... he should really want to do what he is
; about to do."
Craig's enthusiastic manner in the lecture

hall is proof that he enjoys teaching as much
as he suggests. "I know very, very few peo
ple, not only among historians, but academ
ics in general, who are as devoted to
teaching as Prof. Craig is," said Paret. Kathy
Walker, a former student of Craig's, noted
that "he is probably the most dynamic pro
fessor in the history core (at Stanford)."
Walker, a sophomore majoring in history,
noted that, "He's interested in what he
teaches, and you can tell I"
Although intelligence, wit and sarcasm,
refined to an art by years of practice are qual
ities worth noting in Craig's lectures, he is by
no means the type of professor who attempts
to "entertain" his students by carrying them
to extremes. On the contrary, he makes
good use of his confident tone of voice,
pleasing manner and "well-groomed" ap
pearance to make his lectures as effective as
possible.
Craig, sporting carefully manicured
"lamb-chop" sideburns and a bow-tie, can
not help but command attention as he
promenades into the lecture hall. Upon
reaching the front of the room, Craig cere
moniously places his hat and cane in the vi
cinity of the podium.
Although Craig's lectures are often en
hanced by his witicisms and an occasional
humorous digression, there is definitely a
more traditional side to his teaching charac
ter. "He has a formal concept of teaching,"
said History Department Chairman Peter
Stansky. "He's an extremely distinguished
historian. He has a sense of both the nature
of history and how history should be writ
ten."
Stansky does not stand alone in his opin
ion that Craig is an outstanding historian. Af
ter his book The Germans. 1866-1945 was
published, Craig was awarded the His
torian's Prize of the City of Munster, West
phalia, and the Gold Medal of the Com
monwealth Club of California. The highly
acclaimed book was also nominated for the
much coveted National Book Award.
After reviewing Craig's most recently pub
lished book, The Germans, the Wall Street
Journal noted that Craig is "probably the
most gifted historian of Germany currently
writing in English."
Craig said he not only believes that he is an
effective teacher in the classroom, but he
feels that he teaches a great deal through his
books as well. Not only do his readers gain
the benefit of reading what he has to say, but
Craig is, in effect, also establishing himself as
an authority in his field by publishing his
knowledge of history.
Craig is an adamant supporter of the "pub
lish or perish" philosophy. "A faculty should
be made up of teacher-scholars," explained
Craig. "It's important to be a good teacher,
but that can't stand alone. One should be a
good teacher and a good scholar."
Although Craig personally sees to it that
most of his works are published (he currently
has eight books on the market), there is one
work that he suggests will never be touched
in whole by publishers, even though it has
taken him nearly 50 years to write. This work
is Gordon Craig's personal diary.
It might be said that Craig "grew up"
with his diary. As he described the contents

of the book, it is easy to conclude from
Craig's satisfied expression that he has led an
eventful life.
Craig started his diary when he visited
Germany for the first time in 1935. Craig,
who was only 21 at the time, was fascinated
by the historical events that were taking
place during this time period. (Among these
events were the fall of the Weimar Republic
and the political ascendance of Adolf Hitler.)
Craig managed to maintain his journal
through his stay at Oxford — where he was a
Rhodes Scholar — and through his year of
graduate study at Princeton. After he mar
ried, the diary "dropped off for a while," said
Craig.
Craig did not start the diary again until he
served overseas during the Second World
War. "The gaps (in the diary) worried me, so I
went back and filled them up with little
memoir items which were written on the

7 love lecturing. As a
lecturer approaches the
podium, he should be
keyed up for the lecture.
There should be a sense of
anticipation... he should
really want to do what he is
about to do/

basis of small pocket diaries I had kept very c
arefully," Craig explained.
The diary is now relatively complete from
1935 to the present. "It's a lot of fun to read
back," he added.
When entering Craig's office in the His
tory Department, it might be discovered that
Craig's personal history is every bit as
fascinating as the history he professes in the
classroom.
Although it happens with some pro
fessionals, no sudden glare of indignation
explodes across Prof. Craig's face when a stu
dent asks him questions about his life away
from the school. Instead, he looked calmly at
his inquirer with eyes that seem to smile, re
gardless of what the rest of his face is doing.
He folded his hands in his lap, reclined in his
office chair and put one foot on the edge of
his cluttered desk. It's story time and Craig
was more than willing to share the ex
periences that have made him the person he
is.
The same intelligence, wit and sarcasm
that Craig employs so well in the lecture hall
carries over into tales of his personal ex
periences.
"I used to be an ardent fly fisherman," said
Craig,"but then he added, "I would go out
into the ocean .. . and bring nothing back!"
Why did the historian like fishing so much?
"It's good for you," said Craig. "They say that
the hours you spend fishing don't count
against your life-span."
Craig shares some of the same stories in
lecture that he shares with interested stu
dents in his office. One week, he treated his
History 3 class to a humorous account of a
former teacher he had had as a sophomore
at Princeton. Although the story of "Buzzer"

Hall had little to do with the history of Eu
rope, It added another welcomed
dimension to Craig's presentation.

'A faculty should be made
up of teacher-scholars. It's
important to be a good
teacher but that can't
stand alone. One should
be a good teacher and a
good scholar.'

When speaking with Craig on a one to one
basis, the professor is willing to concede per
haps a little bit more than he would in the
lecture hall. As an explanation as to why he
left his teaching career at Princeton to come
to Stanford, Craig said he was ready for a
change: "I had done all that I possibly could
at Princeton." He had not only taught there

for nearly 20 years, but he had also served on
every possible university committee. "If I
had stayed any longer," said Craig, "they
would have built a cage or a wall around me
and put up a 'Mr. Chips' sign on the outside.
We (Craig and his family) ended up here at
Stanford. We were glad to be here. We never
looked back."
Currently, Craig is serving as President of
the American Historical Association and is
also the first Vice-President of the Bureau of
International Organization of Historical Sci
ences.
As for the future, Craig said that he will
have "more than enough to do" to keep
himself busy. Although he will no longer be
lecturing, he intends to teach seminars here
at Stanford for at least two more years.
Craig is currently adding the finishing
touches to his ninth book, which he hopes
will be on the market by Christmas. After
that, Craig hopes to complete at least two
more full length books. Then, said Craig, "I'll
hang up my skates."

Although Craig officially retired three
years ago, he has remained remarkably ac
tive in teaching at Stanford as a J.E. Wallace
Sterling Professor of Humanities Emeritus.
Craig, the primary lecturer in a Freshman
Western Culture course entitled "European
History from 1815 to the Present," is required
to lecture three days a week to a class of near
ly 400 students.
The future of the celebrated lecturer's ca
reer was put into question after a recent
heart-related operation. Craig, who made an
astounding recovery, was originally quite
worried about his voice. For a while after the
operation, Craig felt that his voice had
neither the volume or the "resonance" re
quired for teaching large groups of students.
"It left me in bad humor," said Craig. Be-

with old dodderers trying
to pretend that a little golf
every day will keep them
busy. Really they're bored.
They don't last as long as
they should/— Cordon
Craig

cause his recovery period was reasonably
short, he is teaching this quarter as was ori
ginally planned.
In addition to the lectures, Craig leads sev
eral two-hour long discussion groups which
are designed to cover various aspects of Eu
ropean history in detail.
Many hours of research and preparation
are required in order to make both the lec
tures and discussion groups as successful as
they are. Prof. Peter Paret, also of the history
department, noted that Craig sometimes
stays up until three or four in the morning
for the lectures. "It's exhausting,"
noted Craig. But being tired hasn't stopped
him in the past and it certainly doesn't seem
to be stopping him now.
Craig's quickly paced, yet well-organized
lectures are anything but the product of a
fatigued scholar. "I love lecturing," ex
plained Craig. "As a lecturer approaches the
podium, he should be keyed up for the lec
ture. There should be a sense of anticipation
... he should really want to do what he is
; about to do."
Craig's enthusiastic manner in the lecture

hall is proof that he enjoys teaching as much
as he suggests. "I know very, very few peo
ple, not only among historians, but academ
ics in general, who are as devoted to
teaching as Prof. Craig is," said Paret. Kathy
Walker, a former student of Craig's, noted
that "he is probably the most dynamic pro
fessor in the history core (at Stanford)."
Walker, a sophomore majoring in history,
noted that, "He's interested in what he
teaches, and you can tell I"
Although intelligence, wit and sarcasm,
refined to an art by years of practice are qual
ities worth noting in Craig's lectures, he is by
no means the type of professor who attempts
to "entertain" his students by carrying them
to extremes. On the contrary, he makes
good use of his confident tone of voice,
pleasing manner and "well-groomed" ap
pearance to make his lectures as effective as
possible.
Craig, sporting carefully manicured
"lamb-chop" sideburns and a bow-tie, can
not help but command attention as he
promenades into the lecture hall. Upon
reaching the front of the room, Craig cere
moniously places his hat and cane in the vi
cinity of the podium.
Although Craig's lectures are often en
hanced by his witicisms and an occasional
humorous digression, there is definitely a
more traditional side to his teaching charac
ter. "He has a formal concept of teaching,"
said History Department Chairman Peter
Stansky. "He's an extremely distinguished
historian. He has a sense of both the nature
of history and how history should be writ
ten."
Stansky does not stand alone in his opin
ion that Craig is an outstanding historian. Af
ter his book The Germans. 1866-1945 was
published, Craig was awarded the His
torian's Prize of the City of Munster, West
phalia, and the Gold Medal of the Com
monwealth Club of California. The highly
acclaimed book was also nominated for the
much coveted National Book Award.
After reviewing Craig's most recently pub
lished book, The Germans, the Wall Street
Journal noted that Craig is "probably the
most gifted historian of Germany currently
writing in English."
Craig said he not only believes that he is an
effective teacher in the classroom, but he
feels that he teaches a great deal through his
books as well. Not only do his readers gain
the benefit of reading what he has to say, but
Craig is, in effect, also establishing himself as
an authority in his field by publishing his
knowledge of history.
Craig is an adamant supporter of the "pub
lish or perish" philosophy. "A faculty should
be made up of teacher-scholars," explained
Craig. "It's important to be a good teacher,
but that can't stand alone. One should be a
good teacher and a good scholar."
Although Craig personally sees to it that
most of his works are published (he currently
has eight books on the market), there is one
work that he suggests will never be touched
in whole by publishers, even though it has
taken him nearly 50 years to write. This work
is Gordon Craig's personal diary.
It might be said that Craig "grew up"
with his diary. As he described the contents

of the book, it is easy to conclude from
Craig's satisfied expression that he has led an
eventful life.
Craig started his diary when he visited
Germany for the first time in 1935. Craig,
who was only 21 at the time, was fascinated
by the historical events that were taking
place during this time period. (Among these
events were the fall of the Weimar Republic
and the political ascendance of Adolf Hitler.)
Craig managed to maintain his journal
through his stay at Oxford — where he was a
Rhodes Scholar — and through his year of
graduate study at Princeton. After he mar
ried, the diary "dropped off for a while," said
Craig.
Craig did not start the diary again until he
served overseas during the Second World
War. "The gaps (in the diary) worried me, so I
went back and filled them up with little
memoir items which were written on the

7 love lecturing. As a
lecturer approaches the
podium, he should be
keyed up for the lecture.
There should be a sense of
anticipation... he should
really want to do what he is
about to do/

basis of small pocket diaries I had kept very c
arefully," Craig explained.
The diary is now relatively complete from
1935 to the present. "It's a lot of fun to read
back," he added.
When entering Craig's office in the His
tory Department, it might be discovered that
Craig's personal history is every bit as
fascinating as the history he professes in the
classroom.
Although it happens with some pro
fessionals, no sudden glare of indignation
explodes across Prof. Craig's face when a stu
dent asks him questions about his life away
from the school. Instead, he looked calmly at
his inquirer with eyes that seem to smile, re
gardless of what the rest of his face is doing.
He folded his hands in his lap, reclined in his
office chair and put one foot on the edge of
his cluttered desk. It's story time and Craig
was more than willing to share the ex
periences that have made him the person he
is.
The same intelligence, wit and sarcasm
that Craig employs so well in the lecture hall
carries over into tales of his personal ex
periences.
"I used to be an ardent fly fisherman," said
Craig,"but then he added, "I would go out
into the ocean .. . and bring nothing back!"
Why did the historian like fishing so much?
"It's good for you," said Craig. "They say that
the hours you spend fishing don't count
against your life-span."
Craig shares some of the same stories in
lecture that he shares with interested stu
dents in his office. One week, he treated his
History 3 class to a humorous account of a
former teacher he had had as a sophomore
at Princeton. Although the story of "Buzzer"

Hall had little to do with the history of Eu
rope, It added another welcomed
dimension to Craig's presentation.

'A faculty should be made
up of teacher-scholars. It's
important to be a good
teacher but that can't
stand alone. One should
be a good teacher and a
good scholar.'

When speaking with Craig on a one to one
basis, the professor is willing to concede per
haps a little bit more than he would in the
lecture hall. As an explanation as to why he
left his teaching career at Princeton to come
to Stanford, Craig said he was ready for a
change: "I had done all that I possibly could
at Princeton." He had not only taught there

for nearly 20 years, but he had also served on
every possible university committee. "If I
had stayed any longer," said Craig, "they
would have built a cage or a wall around me
and put up a 'Mr. Chips' sign on the outside.
We (Craig and his family) ended up here at
Stanford. We were glad to be here. We never
looked back."
Currently, Craig is serving as President of
the American Historical Association and is
also the first Vice-President of the Bureau of
International Organization of Historical Sci
ences.
As for the future, Craig said that he will
have "more than enough to do" to keep
himself busy. Although he will no longer be
lecturing, he intends to teach seminars here
at Stanford for at least two more years.
Craig is currently adding the finishing
touches to his ninth book, which he hopes
will be on the market by Christmas. After
that, Craig hopes to complete at least two
more full length books. Then, said Craig, "I'll
hang up my skates."


Gordon Craig
While most people view retirement as a
chance to recline in the sunshine, unwind
and enjoy the benefits of their labor, others,
including Stanford History Prof. Gordon
Craig, consider retirement a poor excuse to
"slack off."
According to Craig, who is completing his
last quarter as a lecturer at Stanford after hav
ing spent nearly 20 years here, maintaining a
certain degree of productivity is essential to
a truly rewarding retirement. "The country is
peopled with old dodderers trying to pre
tend that a little golf every day will keep
them busy. Really they're bored,"
speculated Craig. "They don't last as long as
they should."

quired for teaching large groups of students.
"It left me in bad humor," said Craig. Be-

cause his recovery period was reasonably
short, he is teaching this quarter as was ori
ginally planned.
In addition to the lectures, Craig leads sev
eral two-hour long discussion groups which
are designed to cover various aspects of Eu
ropean history in detail.
Many hours of research and preparation
are required in order to make both the lec
tures and discussion groups as successful as
they are. Prof. Peter Paret, also of the history
department, noted that Craig sometimes
stays up until three or four in the morning
for the lectures. "It's exhausting,"
noted Craig. But being tired hasn't stopped
him in the past and it certainly doesn't seem
to be stopping him now.
Craig's quickly paced, yet well-organized
lectures are anything but the product of a
fatigued scholar. "I love lecturing," ex
plained Craig. "As a lecturer approaches the
podium, he should be keyed up for the lec
ture. There should be a sense of anticipation
... he should really want to do what he is
; about to do."
Craig's enthusiastic manner in the lecture

hall is proof that he enjoys teaching as much
as he suggests. "I know very, very few peo
ple, not only among historians, but academ
ics in general, who are as devoted to
teaching as Prof. Craig is," said Paret. Kathy
Walker, a former student of Craig's, noted
that "he is probably the most dynamic pro
fessor in the history core (at Stanford)."
Walker, a sophomore majoring in history,
noted that, "He's interested in what he
teaches, and you can tell I"
Although intelligence, wit and sarcasm,
refined to an art by years of practice are qual
ities worth noting in Craig's lectures, he is by
no means the type of professor who attempts
to "entertain" his students by carrying them
to extremes. On the contrary, he makes
good use of his confident tone of voice,
pleasing manner and "well-groomed" ap
pearance to make his lectures as effective as
possible.
Craig, sporting carefully manicured
"lamb-chop" sideburns and a bow-tie, can
not help but command attention as he
promenades into the lecture hall. Upon
reaching the front of the room, Craig cere
moniously places his hat and cane in the vi
cinity of the podium.
Although Craig's lectures are often en
hanced by his witicisms and an occasional
humorous digression, there is definitely a
more traditional side to his teaching charac
ter. "He has a formal concept of teaching,"
said History Department Chairman Peter
Stansky. "He's an extremely distinguished
historian. He has a sense of both the nature
of history and how history should be writ
ten."
Stansky does not stand alone in his opin
ion that Craig is an outstanding historian. Af
ter his book The Germans. 1866-1945 was
published, Craig was awarded the His
torian's Prize of the City of Munster, West
phalia, and the Gold Medal of the Com
monwealth Club of California. The highly
acclaimed book was also nominated for the
much coveted National Book Award.
After reviewing Craig's most recently pub
lished book, The Germans, the Wall Street
Journal noted that Craig is "probably the
most gifted historian of Germany currently
writing in English."
Craig said he not only believes that he is an
effective teacher in the classroom, but he
feels that he teaches a great deal through his
books as well. Not only do his readers gain
the benefit of reading what he has to say, but
Craig is, in effect, also establishing himself as
an authority in his field by publishing his
knowledge of history.
Craig is an adamant supporter of the "pub
lish or perish" philosophy. "A faculty should
be made up of teacher-scholars," explained
Craig. "It's important to be a good teacher,
but that can't stand alone. One should be a
good teacher and a good scholar."
Although Craig personally sees to it that
most of his works are published (he currently
has eight books on the market), there is one
work that he suggests will never be touched
in whole by publishers, even though it has
taken him nearly 50 years to write. This work
is Gordon Craig's personal diary.
It might be said that Craig "grew up"
with his diary. As he described the contents

of the book, it is easy to conclude from
Craig's satisfied expression that he has led an
eventful life.
Craig started his diary when he visited
Germany for the first time in 1935. Craig,
who was only 21 at the time, was fascinated
by the historical events that were taking
place during this time period. (Among these
events were the fall of the Weimar Republic
and the political ascendance of Adolf Hitler.)
Craig managed to maintain his journal
through his stay at Oxford — where he was a
Rhodes Scholar — and through his year of
graduate study at Princeton. After he mar
ried, the diary "dropped off for a while," said
Craig.
Craig did not start the diary again until he
served overseas during the Second World
War. "The gaps (in the diary) worried me, so I
went back and filled them up with little
memoir items which were written on the

7 love lecturing. As a
lecturer approaches the
podium, he should be
keyed up for the lecture.
There should be a sense of
anticipation... he should
really want to do what he is
about to do/

basis of small pocket diaries I had kept very c
arefully," Craig explained.
The diary is now relatively complete from
1935 to the present. "It's a lot of fun to read
back," he added.
When entering Craig's office in the His
tory Department, it might be discovered that
Craig's personal history is every bit as
fascinating as the history he professes in the
classroom.
Although it happens with some pro
fessionals, no sudden glare of indignation
explodes across Prof. Craig's face when a stu
dent asks him questions about his life away
from the school. Instead, he looked calmly at
his inquirer with eyes that seem to smile, re
gardless of what the rest of his face is doing.
He folded his hands in his lap, reclined in his
office chair and put one foot on the edge of
his cluttered desk. It's story time and Craig
was more than willing to share the ex
periences that have made him the person he
is.
The same intelligence, wit and sarcasm
that Craig employs so well in the lecture hall
carries over into tales of his personal ex
periences.
"I used to be an ardent fly fisherman," said
Craig,"but then he added, "I would go out
into the ocean .. . and bring nothing back!"
Why did the historian like fishing so much?
"It's good for you," said Craig. "They say that
the hours you spend fishing don't count
against your life-span."
Craig shares some of the same stories in
lecture that he shares with interested stu
dents in his office. One week, he treated his
History 3 class to a humorous account of a
former teacher he had had as a sophomore
at Princeton. Although the story of "Buzzer"

Hall had little to do with the history of Eu
rope, It added another welcomed
dimension to Craig's presentation.

'A faculty should be made
up of teacher-scholars. It's
important to be a good
teacher but that can't
stand alone. One should
be a good teacher and a
good scholar.'

When speaking with Craig on a one to one
basis, the professor is willing to concede per
haps a little bit more than he would in the
lecture hall. As an explanation as to why he
left his teaching career at Princeton to come
to Stanford, Craig said he was ready for a
change: "I had done all that I possibly could
at Princeton." He had not only taught there

for nearly 20 years, but he had also served on
every possible university committee. "If I
had stayed any longer," said Craig, "they
would have built a cage or a wall around me
and put up a 'Mr. Chips' sign on the outside.
We (Craig and his family) ended up here at
Stanford. We were glad to be here. We never
looked back."
Currently, Craig is serving as President of
the American Historical Association and is
also the first Vice-President of the Bureau of
International Organization of Historical Sci
ences.
As for the future, Craig said that he will
have "more than enough to do" to keep
himself busy. Although he will no longer be
lecturing, he intends to teach seminars here
at Stanford for at least two more years.
Craig is currently adding the finishing
touches to his ninth book, which he hopes
will be on the market by Christmas. After
that, Craig hopes to complete at least two
more full length books. Then, said Craig, "I'll
hang up my skates."


Gordon Craig
While most people view retirement as a
chance to recline in the sunshine, unwind
and enjoy the benefits of their labor, others,
including Stanford History Prof. Gordon
Craig, consider retirement a poor excuse to
"slack off."
According to Craig, who is completing his
last quarter as a lecturer at Stanford after hav
ing spent nearly 20 years here, maintaining a
certain degree of productivity is essential to
a truly rewarding retirement. "The country is
peopled with old dodderers trying to pre
tend that a little golf every day will keep
them busy. Really they're bored,"
speculated Craig. "They don't last as long as
they should."
Although Craig officially retired three
years ago, he has remained remarkably ac
tive in teaching at Stanford as a J.E. Wallace
Sterling Professor of Humanities Emeritus.
Craig, the primary lecturer in a Freshman
Western Culture course entitled "European
History from 1815 to the Present," is required
to lecture three days a week to a class of near
ly 400 students.
The future of the celebrated lecturer's ca
reer was put into question after a recent
heart-related operation. Craig, who made an
astounding recovery, was originally quite
worried about his voice. For a while after the
operation, Craig felt that his voice had
neither the volume or the "resonance" re
quired for teaching large groups of students.
"It left me in bad humor," said Craig. Be-
