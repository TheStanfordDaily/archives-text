### Sally Newman 
Friday night's fundraising dinner
for Rep. Tom Lantos (D-San Mateo)
in Burlingame was highlighted by the
appearances of both Sen. Christ
opher Dodd (D-Conn.) and Los An
geles Mayor Tom Bradley, a Demo
cratic gubernatorial candidate, who
added some life to typically bland af
fair.
Each speaker was received en
thusiastically and applauded warmly
by the Retail Clerks' union members
who sponsored the event.
Bradley, with his quiet, assured
tone, was arguably the most popular
speaker present. The only speaker to
receive a standing ovation both
before and after his talk, Bradley gave
his own campaign a boost in the
process of endorsing Lantos'. He
complimented Lantos' accessibility,
for example, comparing it to his own
monthly Open House in Los Angeles.
"Here is a man who believes in tne
little man, the one who has no
spokesman and no defenses. He
wants to restore the faith and con
fidence of the American people in
their leaders and his vote against ex
tra benefits for Congressmen only in
creases his stature," Bradley said.
"Now we are faced with the same old
fight with a new set of actors," he
commented wryly.
Dodd, who lauded Lantos as "a
man who believes in the American
dream," warned the 320 gathered at
the AMFAC hotel that "far more seri
ous things are at stake than just the
career of one politician."
Lantos, like Bradley and Dodd, tai
lored his talk to the audience. While
he did mention his support for the
nuclear freeze initiative under con
sideration by the House, he devoted
most of his talk to economic issues.
"We are rapidly moving toward a
c'jss society," Lantos said, "but we
will not stand still for the termination
of the American dream." Lantos'
speech drew heavily on the misdeeds
of the administration "whose pride is
to declare ketchup a vegetable."
Stressing his concern for his au
dience's economic troubles, Lantos
assured them that "long after the


Tom Bradley
Watts and Stockmans have been for
gotten, the American labor move
ment will continue to be strong and
respected. This will be a land which
recognizes incentives not only for
corporations but also for the middle
class and working poor."
Speaking of his support for the nu
clear freeze initiative, Lantos coun
tered skeptical questions by asking,
"What are the arguments for not
trying it?" He continued, "We have
ihe best brains in the United States
working on ways of monitoring com
pliance — without that, obviously the
freeze is not viable. If the USSR is in
violation, we would have to're-eval
uate our position,' but it wouldn't be
too late to do anything because we
have mutual destructive capability.
"We might even expect the Soviets
to break treaties when it is in their in
terest to do so," Lantos said, "but
they do not when it is not. For exam
ple, it was in their interest to
withdraw from Vienna after the Sec

ond World War and they have kept
their part of the bargain."
On the domestic front, Dodd
criticized the Reagan administration
for failing to provide "the five basic
necessities of any nation: education,
a healthy environment, affordable
housing, adequate nutrition and
health care, and energy."
He accused the administration of
being "one of the most regressive in
history," and to loud applause re
minded his audience that "this coun
try was not buiot by the very very
rich."
As if to underline this fact, the din
ner itself was kept modest: admission
was only $30 per person and tables
were bought up by such groups as
the Sprinkler Fitters' Union and sev
eral Retail Clerks locals.
"We're just delighted by the
phenomenal show of support this
early in the campaign and this is just
one segment of the constituency,"
said Katrina Lantos Swett, Lantos'
daughter and campaign organizer.
"We want everyone to feel that
they're a part of this campaign."

eral Retail Clerks locals.
"We're just delighted by the
phenomenal show of support this
early in the campaign and this is just
one segment of the constituency,"
said Katrina Lantos Swett, Lantos'
daughter and campaign organizer.
"We want everyone to feel that
they're a part of this campaign."
Friday night's fundraising dinner
for Rep. Tom Lantos (D-San Mateo)
in Burlingame was highlighted by the
appearances of both Sen. Christ
opher Dodd (D-Conn.) and Los An
geles Mayor Tom Bradley, a Demo
cratic gubernatorial candidate, who
added some life to typically bland af
fair.
Each speaker was received en
thusiastically and applauded warmly
by the Retail Clerks' union members
who sponsored the event.
Bradley, with his quiet, assured
tone, was arguably the most popular
speaker present. The only speaker to
receive a standing ovation both
before and after his talk, Bradley gave
his own campaign a boost in the
process of endorsing Lantos'. He
complimented Lantos' accessibility,
for example, comparing it to his own
monthly Open House in Los Angeles.
"Here is a man who believes in tne
little man, the one who has no
spokesman and no defenses. He
wants to restore the faith and con
fidence of the American people in
their leaders and his vote against ex
tra benefits for Congressmen only in
creases his stature," Bradley said.
"Now we are faced with the same old
fight with a new set of actors," he
commented wryly.
Dodd, who lauded Lantos as "a
man who believes in the American
dream," warned the 320 gathered at
the AMFAC hotel that "far more seri
ous things are at stake than just the
career of one politician."
Lantos, like Bradley and Dodd, tai
lored his talk to the audience. While
he did mention his support for the
nuclear freeze initiative under con
sideration by the House, he devoted
most of his talk to economic issues.
"We are rapidly moving toward a
c'jss society," Lantos said, "but we
will not stand still for the termination
of the American dream." Lantos'
speech drew heavily on the misdeeds
of the administration "whose pride is
to declare ketchup a vegetable."
Stressing his concern for his au
dience's economic troubles, Lantos
assured them that "long after the


Tom Bradley
Watts and Stockmans have been for
gotten, the American labor move
ment will continue to be strong and
respected. This will be a land which
recognizes incentives not only for
corporations but also for the middle
class and working poor."
Speaking of his support for the nu
clear freeze initiative, Lantos coun
tered skeptical questions by asking,
"What are the arguments for not
trying it?" He continued, "We have
ihe best brains in the United States
working on ways of monitoring com
pliance — without that, obviously the
freeze is not viable. If the USSR is in
violation, we would have to're-eval
uate our position,' but it wouldn't be
too late to do anything because we
have mutual destructive capability.
"We might even expect the Soviets
to break treaties when it is in their in
terest to do so," Lantos said, "but
they do not when it is not. For exam
ple, it was in their interest to
withdraw from Vienna after the Sec

ond World War and they have kept
their part of the bargain."
On the domestic front, Dodd
criticized the Reagan administration
for failing to provide "the five basic
necessities of any nation: education,
a healthy environment, affordable
housing, adequate nutrition and
health care, and energy."
He accused the administration of
being "one of the most regressive in
history," and to loud applause re
minded his audience that "this coun
try was not buiot by the very very
rich."
As if to underline this fact, the din
ner itself was kept modest: admission
was only $30 per person and tables
were bought up by such groups as
the Sprinkler Fitters' Union and sev
eral Retail Clerks locals.
"We're just delighted by the
phenomenal show of support this
early in the campaign and this is just
one segment of the constituency,"
said Katrina Lantos Swett, Lantos'
daughter and campaign organizer.
"We want everyone to feel that
they're a part of this campaign."
