## Soviet band called 'un-Russian' 
### Washington Post 
Moscow â€” The most popu
lar rock ensemble in the Soviet
Union has come under a
vitriolic public attack in which
if was denounced as an "un-
Russian" group that is raucous
and is unable to sing in harmo
ny and that uses lyrics loaded
with "dangerous ideas."
The extraordinary assault in
the newspaper
Komsomolskaya Pravda, the of
ficial daily of the Young Com
munist League, came only a
few weeks after the same paper
announced that millions of its
readers have selected the
group Time Machine as the
most popular ensemble of
1981.
Time Machine could in many
ways be compared to the
Beatles in terms of its ori
ginality, talent and influence
on young Soviets. It earlier had
been acknowledged as a trend
setter whose concerts and rec
ords are instantly sold out, and
it symbolizes generational
changes here.
. The recent attack accused
the group of spreading sub

versive ideas, cynicism,
pessimism and generally hin
dering the furthering of com
munist ideals among young
people.
The attack seems to reflect
internal political disputes be
tween younger and more
modern elements in the party
and the more orthodox older
generation. The unusual
about-face also comes against a
backdrop of persistent reports
of a power struggle in the
Kremlin stemming from Soviet
leader Leonid Brezhnev's frag
ile health and the recent death
of Mikhail Suslov.
The attack on the group sug
gests that there are groups in
the Soviet elite that would like
to see a crackdown on pop mu
sic, which is now playing the
role once filled by books, mov
ies and television.
Recently published articles
have suggested that pop music,
blue jeans and sweatshirts are
being used by the West to un
dermine socialism here. Yet
Time Machine has been fea
tured on the state-controlled
television and its enormously

popular concerts throughout
the country are sponsored by
the Young Communist League,
known as Komsomol.
Only a month ago, a Soviet
music critic wrote in the week
ly Novoe Vremya that the
group's lyrics dealt "honestly"
with morals and other prob
lems troubling Soviet youth.
There is indeed a sense of
apathy and aimlessness among
young people here that official
propaganda tends to mask with
slogans.
Novoe Vremya acknowl
edged this by saying: "Their
poetry is a statement, and their
metaphors seem like slogans.
There is something remi
niscent of (Bertolt) Brecht's
songs and political posters of
the twenties in them. They deal
with a whole range of moral,
civic, personal and social ques
tions that agitate Soviet youth."
The more recent attack,
however, appears to seek to
destroy the reputation of the
ensemble by not only denigrat
ing its musical abilities but also
by showing it as "un-Russian"
in an effort to exploit patriotic
and ethnocentric sentiments of
the older generations.
"An alien tree transplanted
in our soil does not bear fruit,"
the article said in charging that
Time Machine was not rooted
in Russian national culture.
"Just as there is Central Eu
ropean time, so there is a Cen
tral European mold. We would
like to see Soviet groups fit into
a Soviet mold, just as they stick
to Soviet time."
The lyrics of the group, writ

ten by its leader Andrei
Makarevich, appear to
challenge official Soviet propa
ganda. Yet the group's very
popularity indicates the wide
resonance it has gained among
millions of Soviet youths.
"I do not believe in prom
ises," the group sings in one of
its songs, "and will not do so in
the future. There is no point in
believing in promises any long
er."
Another tune says, "We have
given our word not to turn off
the straight path. But, fate
forced us to." Yet another
tune, which runs counter to
the official belief in progress,
says: "Tell me, why are you
happy? Wait, look back, and
see how the fallen leaves de
cay, how a crow circles where
once a garden bloomed."
In criticizing the last tune,
the paper stressed that the five
member group gave political
significance to it by singing the
word "crow" in a major key.
Other songs to which Rus
sian audiences respond with
enthusiasm include the notion
that the "bluebird of hope,"
the symbol of future happiness
in traditional Russian folk tales,
has vanished from young peo
ple's lives.
"You have to wear masks,
wear masks, because only un
der the mask can you remain
yourself," another song says.
Yet another says,"I am calm
only for the fact, that now no
body can deceive you, and you
are now prepared to do thing:
for yourself."
