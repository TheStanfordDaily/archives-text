## University exchange heightens awareness 
### Kathleen Sanders 
For Stanford junior E.
Charles Lamplay, spending a
semester at Howard University
was a necessary reassurance
that attending a predominantly
white university has not weak
ened his cultural identity.
For Kenneth Jackson, a
sophomore from Howard,
spending a quarter here is his
way to ensure that attending a
predominantly black university
has not limited his professional
opportunities.
Both Lamplay and Jackson
are part of the exchange pro
gram between Stanford and
Howard University in Washing
ton, D.C.. Each year, interested
Stanford students can spend a
semester at Howard and How
ard students can come here.
Now in its fourth year of opera
tion, the program is the result
of a collaborative effort on the
part of a group of black stu
dents and former Associate
Dean of Student Affairs, Harold
Boyd.
"I wanted to have the ex
perience of going to a black
school," Lamplay said. Not
only do American blacks at
tend Howard but students
from Africa and the Caribbean
compose a sizable amount of
the student population. He
said that being in the majority
made race less of an issue.
"I thought I may have lost,
through lack of use, my ability
to communicate with everday
black people. I was afraid of
becoming a 'pseudo-intellec
tual.' "
Lamplay said he had no trou
ble relating and that while at
Howard, he pledged the
fraternity Omega Psi Phi.
He described Howard as a
"mecca" of black culture. The
ater, music, speeches — there
is always some cultural or polit
ical happening on campus or
within D.C., he said. He cited
the Founders' Library which
houses an extensive collection
on the history of black people.
Lamplay explained that one
learned from a black per
spective and that at Howard
courses deal with subject mat
ter in terms of the way it affects
the lives of black people.
The exchange experience
provided him with an alter
native point of view, he said. A
Stanford student would be
come aware that history the

way they have been taught is
from a white perspective, he
said.
Lamplay is a biology major
and active with the Black Pre
medical Organization here. He
is activelv studying for the
Medical College Admissions
Test (MCAT) and lives in the
French House.
Academically Lamplay said
he did very well and found the
curriculum comparable to
Stanford iri terms of difficulty.
There were usually less stu-

'It is very easy to lose
your perspective as a
black person at

dents in his classes and the se
mester system provided a long
er time period in which to
complete the work, he said.
Stanford housing would
probably be considered lux
urious when compared to that
at Howard, as well as being
more accessible to the campus.
It is necessary to take a shuta-a
to some of the classes at How -
ard, he said.
Jackson is a business major.
He lives in Casa Ujamaa, sings
with Stanford's Gospel Choir
and is pledging the fraternity
Kappa Alpha Psi.
When he graduated from
high school, Jackson said he
faced a dilemma. Would em
ployers respect a degree from a
black university as much as one
from a white school? He de
cided that one's ability to
achieve in anything rests solely
with the individual and chose
to attend Howard. This is Jack
son's second quarter as an ex
change student at Stanford.
"I wanted to come to Stan
ford to prove to myself that I
wasn't losing out on anything

that would be essential to my
professional development," he
said.
"I found there to not be an
extreme amount of differences
in the difficulty of the classes or
the materials," Jackson said. He
cited classes he has taken at
Stanford with prerequisites for
which Howard prepared him.
"I have the opportunity to
utilize some opportunities that
would not be available at How
ard." Jackson cited the SCIRE
program through which he
works as a stockbroker appren
tice with the E.F. Hutton Com
pany.
"It's different when you
leave Washington, D.C.,atotal
ly black environment, where
there is a constant influx of
stimuli that supports your
blackness and come to Stan
ford which is totally opposite,"
he said.
"It is very easy to lose your
perspective as a black person at
Stanford," he said. "Often you
are led to believe that it is just a
normal regular world and that
as a black person you will face
no obstacles when you gradu
ate," Jackson stressed.
At Howard, Jackson said that
black students can gain a
clearer understanding of
themselves and their rela
tionship to society including
the hurdles they may face.
Jackson said he views his ex
perience at Stanford as a
positive one and has had no
difficulty adjusting. He is con
sidering the Stanford Business
School for graduate work.
In discussing tnc reasons for
the exchange program, Beverly
Scott, assistant dean of under
graduate studies for ex
tradepartmental affairs, said,
"We often forget to give recog
nition to the many culturesthat
make up what American cul
ture is."
According to the original
program proposal, "such an
exchange would allow Stan
ford students to experience
studying at a predominantly
black institution, an environ
ment particularly supportive of
them." The program's ration
ale "is very similar to the ra
tionale for overseas studies —
an opportunity to study in a dif
ferent, culturally rich environ
ment during part of their un
dergraduate years."

Stanford housing would
probably be considered lux

at Howard, as well as being

to some of the classes at How -

Jackson is a business major.
He lives in Casa Ujamaa, sings
with Stanford's Gospel Choir
and is pledging the fraternity
Kappa Alpha Psi.
When he graduated from
high school, Jackson said he
faced a dilemma. Would em
ployers respect a degree from a
black university as much as one
from a white school? He de
cided that one's ability to
achieve in anything rests solely
with the individual and chose
to attend Howard. This is Jack
son's second quarter as an ex
change student at Stanford.
"I wanted to come to Stan
ford to prove to myself that I
wasn't losing out on anything

that would be essential to my
professional development," he
said.
"I found there to not be an
extreme amount of differences
in the difficulty of the classes or
the materials," Jackson said. He
cited classes he has taken at
Stanford with prerequisites for
which Howard prepared him.
"I have the opportunity to
utilize some opportunities that
would not be available at How
ard." Jackson cited the SCIRE
program through which he
works as a stockbroker appren
tice with the E.F. Hutton Com
pany.
"It's different when you
leave Washington, D.C.,atotal
ly black environment, where
there is a constant influx of
stimuli that supports your
blackness and come to Stan
ford which is totally opposite,"
he said.
"It is very easy to lose your
perspective as a black person at
Stanford," he said. "Often you
are led to believe that it is just a
normal regular world and that
as a black person you will face
no obstacles when you gradu
ate," Jackson stressed.
At Howard, Jackson said that
black students can gain a
clearer understanding of
themselves and their rela
tionship to society including
the hurdles they may face.
Jackson said he views his ex
perience at Stanford as a
positive one and has had no
difficulty adjusting. He is con
sidering the Stanford Business
School for graduate work.
In discussing tnc reasons for
the exchange program, Beverly
Scott, assistant dean of under
graduate studies for ex
tradepartmental affairs, said,
"We often forget to give recog
nition to the many culturesthat
make up what American cul
ture is."
According to the original
program proposal, "such an
exchange would allow Stan
ford students to experience
studying at a predominantly
black institution, an environ
ment particularly supportive of
them." The program's ration
ale "is very similar to the ra
tionale for overseas studies —
an opportunity to study in a dif
ferent, culturally rich environ
ment during part of their un
dergraduate years."
For Stanford junior E.
Charles Lamplay, spending a
semester at Howard University
was a necessary reassurance
that attending a predominantly
white university has not weak
ened his cultural identity.
For Kenneth Jackson, a
sophomore from Howard,
spending a quarter here is his
way to ensure that attending a
predominantly black university
has not limited his professional
opportunities.
Both Lamplay and Jackson
are part of the exchange pro
gram between Stanford and
Howard University in Washing
ton, D.C.. Each year, interested
Stanford students can spend a
semester at Howard and How
ard students can come here.
Now in its fourth year of opera
tion, the program is the result
of a collaborative effort on the
part of a group of black stu
dents and former Associate
Dean of Student Affairs, Harold
Boyd.
"I wanted to have the ex
perience of going to a black
school," Lamplay said. Not
only do American blacks at
tend Howard but students
from Africa and the Caribbean
compose a sizable amount of
the student population. He
said that being in the majority
made race less of an issue.
"I thought I may have lost,
through lack of use, my ability
to communicate with everday
black people. I was afraid of
becoming a 'pseudo-intellec
tual.' "
Lamplay said he had no trou
ble relating and that while at
Howard, he pledged the
fraternity Omega Psi Phi.
He described Howard as a
"mecca" of black culture. The
ater, music, speeches — there
is always some cultural or polit
ical happening on campus or
within D.C., he said. He cited
the Founders' Library which
houses an extensive collection
on the history of black people.
Lamplay explained that one
learned from a black per
spective and that at Howard
courses deal with subject mat
ter in terms of the way it affects
the lives of black people.
The exchange experience
provided him with an alter
native point of view, he said. A
Stanford student would be
come aware that history the

way they have been taught is
from a white perspective, he
said.
Lamplay is a biology major
and active with the Black Pre
medical Organization here. He
is activelv studying for the
Medical College Admissions
Test (MCAT) and lives in the
French House.
Academically Lamplay said
he did very well and found the
curriculum comparable to
