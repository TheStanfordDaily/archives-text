9052811978548736 is written on a chalk
board in Meyer Forum Room. A man
stands with his back to this army of numer
als and repeats them in exact order to 25
listeners. After a few minutes, he does it
again — only backwards this time.
David Markoff is a memory expert. But
behind all these so-called stunts is a train
ing program teaching the Markoff Memo
ry System. For $90 ($l2O at the door) and
eight hours of your time, the man with his
back to the chalkboard claims he can triple
your ability to memorize and recall words
and definitions. If successful, Markoff
Memory Training will double your ability
to remember academic texts as well, he
said.
To Markoff, time is money. "What's
more important than doing something in
less time?" he asks. He believes his system
enables the student to memorize things in
a lightening fast fashion, ultimately saving
priceless time.
"Understanding is worthless, unless you
have it memorized. You only get credit
when you can get the information out of
your mind," he expalined. In fact, on a

flyer advertising a free 45 minute clinic,
Markoff blantantly states in the upper left
hand corner: "Admit it!!I College is9oper
cent memory."
A resident of San Diego, Markoff's
methods have gained so much popularity
there that the San Diego city school system
features his memory training procedures.
"Eleven and 12 year olds are becoming
quicker than me (in memorizing)," he
said.
Markoff has appeared on various TV
programs, including the Mike Douglas and
the Today Shows. On them, he usually per
forms various memory "tricks" as enter
tainment. But such activity is not as impor
tant to Markoff as simply teaching his
methods to people in person.
Markoff has authored two books, How
to Remember Everything and Total Recall,
both of which emphasize the keys to his
memorization system — COV (creativity,
organization and visualization).
"Creativity is the highest form of memo
ry," he said. "Memory is like a physical law.
If you do it correctly, it will come back. If
you don't, it will lessen your chances."
Also essential for an efficient memory,
according to Markoff, is confidence. "You
must know that you are going to get a 100

on the test," he explained.
Besides the material advantages of a
good memory, Markoff claims those with
them live longer. Since he is constantly
trying to sell his course, Markoff is never at
a loss for promoting the importance of a
developed memory. "The computer
changed the world and made it a better
place to live — because it has a memory
bank," he commented.
Markoff's eight-hour course claims to
arouse one's understanding of the holistic
and physiological sides of memory. He
drinks a lot of milk ("because the brain
works on glucose") and rarely consumes
liquor or anything else that "will stimulate
my pancreas to secrete enough insulin to
wipe out my glucose and shut off my volt
age.
"The computer works on energy and so
does the mind," he continued.
Markoff stated that, although he has
made enough money to "sit on aboat in
the Carribbean," he continues to spread
his gospel of memory techniques. "Life is
living, not sitting on a boat,"he said.
Oh, about that number.
"I'll remember it for maybe a month or
two,"he said.
