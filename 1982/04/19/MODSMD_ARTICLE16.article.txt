Washington — The following is a
short, two-scene fable geared for re
alists of all ages.
Scene I: At a recent political recep
tion here, an intern on leave from
college reveals her intentions to at
tend law school. "I don't know why
I'm going, really," she says."I just
don't know what else to do. 1 know
that's a stupid reason ..
Scene II: At a somewhat less glam
orous congregation for third-year
law students, a Long Island native
confesses he's been living on frozen
pizza and Quaaludes recently. Three
years of hard work for a law degree
have yet to land him a job. "I've been
a nervous wreck since February," he
moans.
While the scenes differ, they're ex
emplary of a growing melodrafna:
Despite a record level of law school
enrollments, the market for lawyers
is shrinking. The "law boom" of the
1970's is over.
Unlike many law students and
practicing attorneys, undergraduates
may not realize that a legal education
is no longer a ticket to the American
Dream. Once again, 1981-1982 was a
"good season"for the nation's 150
American Bar Association-approved
law schools. Applications increased
nearly seven percent. One third of
the 120,000 young Americans who
applied to law school this year will
enroll in September.
Yet when many firms simply re
duced the number of fall recruiting
visits last year, they sent a chill
through the hearts of law school
placement officers. Recently it be
came clear that firms are hiring fewer
new attorneys — in some cases
almost 30 percent fewer. There have
been reports of lay-offs. The New
York Times reported April 2 that in
house corporatelaw officers have
often been the first let go by com
pany managers.
Ironically, the government which
helped spawn so much litigation in
the last decade may be responsible
for the current bust. In addition to
the Reagan reluc

tance to issue new regulations, a min
imalist Justice Department hassimply
brought fewer private concerns to
court. Noting "a dramatic drop" in
the federal caseload here, U.S.
Circuit Court Judge Patricia Wald
told the National Law Journal that the
slowdown would last "a couple more
years."
Yet the lawyer glut isn't necessarily
limited to traditionally "recession
proof" Washington. At the ABA
headquarters in Chicago, attorney
Nancy Slonim noted, "What I have
discovered is that hiring is down all

gold — hasn't lost its

over. It hasn't stopped, but it's at low
er levels than it historically has
been."
Cleveland attorney Carolyn Buller
calls her city's market "rough." A
year out of Case Western Reserve law
school, the 26-year-old told our re
porter Michael Duffy that only half
her classmates had found jobs befit
ting their degrees.
"One friend finally got a job, and
that was with a public defender," she
explained. "Another was laid off af
ter three months, a third took a job
clerking at $6.50 an hour, a fourth is
waitressing."
In the face of such stories, it would
seem wise these days to pursue com
puter science, geology, or even

street vendorship — anything but
law. But the crude truism — that
three years of contracts and moot
court is as good as gold — hasn't lost
its appeal.
Of course, there may be certain
immutable factors. The "prestige"
law schools, for example, seem to en
dure, if not prosper, during times of
uncertainty. Harvard, Michigan and
Stanford expect law school applica
tions to rise between eight and 10
percentage points this year. Tulane
anticipates a 15 percent increase.
Women are also buffeting the
flood of applications. Since the late
19605, their share of entering en
rollments has increased from nearly
zero to almost 40 percent. At some
point soon the number of aspiring
lawyers among women under
graduates will level off, but not until
college placement officers offer
palatable alternatives to those who,
like the woman in our fable, "don't
know what else to do."
Indeed, too many young men and
women get caught between
anachronism and reality. When other
options are few or unappealing, ac
ceptance to a law school becomes a
security blanket. Moreover, whether
one enrolls or not, "I'm applying to
law school" simply sounds good. The
truth, however, isthat neithertheap
plication nor the degree is a guaran
teed means to success.
When word gets back to college
campuses that "Old Faithful" has lost
its steam, undergraduates may want
to spend some time distinguishing
their interest in the law from their
own financial ambitions. Ay effort by
professors to put the legal routine in
a realistic light might ease the with
drawal from our addiction to the "ju
ris doctor" option.
Otherwise, we're likely to see
many more mini-dramas of false ex
pectations, played by a generation of
money-hungry lemmings scurrying
madly toward a mirage.
