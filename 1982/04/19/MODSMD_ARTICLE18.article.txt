# Compromised ideals in Chile
## 
### 
Developments over the past year indicate that the
Reagan administration intends to pursue a much closer
relationship with the military regime in Chile. Such a pol
icy is a contradiction of the ideals for which our country
stands and it is a tragedy for the people of Chile and oth
ers in Latin America who look to the United States for
support.
Following the 1973 military coup in Chile — a coup
which ended more than 100 years of democratic rule in
that country — the new junta led by General Augusto
Pinochet gained a reputation as one of the most brutal
governments on earth. Thousands of Chileans were ar
rested and detained without charge or trial; thousands
more simply "disappeared," never to be heard from
again. Torture and exile were regularly used by the mili
tary regime to impose its will on the populace.
In response to the blatant violations of human rights
committed by the Chilean junta, the U.S. Congress
passed legislation in 1976 prohibiting all military as
sistance to Chile until conditions improved and respect
for democratic principles and human rights was re
stored.
Last fall, spokesmen for the Reagan administration re
quested a change in the law which would permit a re
newed military relationship with Chile. In supporting the
proposed revision, these spokesmen argued that condi
tions in Chile had improved "significantly."
Many members of Congress, however, seriously ques
tioned the wisdom of a change in policy. As a result, the
International Security and Development Cooperation
Act of 1981 included language proscribing military aid to
Chile unless President Ronald Reagan could certify (1)
that the aid is in the U.S. national interest; (2) that the
Chilean government is making substantial progress in
human rights; (3) that Chile is not aiding or abetting in
ternational terrorism; and (4) that Chile is moving ex
peditiously, using "all legal means," to bring to justice
those responsible for the assassination of former Am
bassador Orlando Letelier and his assistant Ronni Moffitt
in Washington in September 1976.
Over the past few months, there have been continual
reports that the president will submit a certification for
Chile later this year. The administration has, however,
encountered formidable difficulties in preparing such a
certification, not the least of which is the Justice Depart
ment's frank admission that General Pinochet has been
thoroughly uncooperative in the Letelier investigation.
Moreover, despite the efforts of U.N. Ambassador
Jeanne Kirkpatrick and others to lavish praise on the
Chilean junta's human riglfcs record, many in Congress
remain highly skeptical.
Indeed, if congressional committees need to decide
on the issue later this year, they will quickly discover that
the required certification cannot be approved in good
faith. The plain faci : s that none of the four points of
certification has been met.
First, on the question of U.S. national interests, al
though the Reagan administration has suggested that
military aid would induce Chile to become more sup
portive of American foreign policy, recent experience
does not bear out this claim.
Despite the administration's gestures of friendliness
and support for the Pinochet regime, Chile has con
tinued to act, in U.N. votes and elsewhere, with little re
gard for American interests. There is no reason to believe
that resumed military aid at thrs time would evoke ap
preciably greater cooperation from Chile.
Second, as far as human rights are concerned, even a
cursory examination reveals that the situation is de
teriorating, not improving. Analyses prepared over the
past year by Amnesty International, the U.N. General As
sembly, the Inter-American Commission on Human
Rights, the International League of Jurists, Freedom
House, the Inter-Parliamentary Union and many other
organizations have meticulously described continued
human rights abuses in Chile.
A 195-page study issued last November by the U.N.
Commission on Human Rights states flatly that "it is not
possible to report any improvement in the human rights
situation in Chile (or) to report the adoption of any
measures conducive to restoring the exercise of human
rights."
The report documents a long list of abuses, including
"arbitrary detentions, unlawful solitary confinement of

prisoners, physical or psychological pressures, murders
for political motives and the persecution of people who
do not agree with the opinions, measures or policies of
the government."
In the five months since the U.N. report was issued,
there have been further instances of arbitrary arrests,
torture and other abuses. In the final two months of 1981
alone, more than 20 allegations of officially-sanctioned
torture were substantiated, while a far larger number of
such cases were never even reported, for fear of reprisal.
Earlier this year, a trade union leader, Tucapal Jimenez,
was murdered shortly after he criticized the regime and
numerous other human rights activists have been ar
rested and exiled.
In view of this deplorable record of persistent human
rights violations in Chile, it is inexcusable for the Reagan
administration to pretend that "significant progress" has
been made — particularly when the State Dept.'s own
human rights report does not support such a conclusion.
Third, on the question of complicity in international
terrorism, there is again no doubt that the Chilean junta
cannot meet the specifications laid down by the Con
gress. By continuing to pay salaries to the Chilean of-

Far from progress, there have
been more detentions, more
persons held incommunicado,
more exiles, more torture and
more restrictions of basic civil
rights this year than last

ficials responsible for the Letelier murders, the Pinochet
regime vividly demonstrates its willingness to "aid and
abet" those engaged in acts of international terrorism.
Moreover, the Chilean government's sponsorship of the
Letelier-Moffitt assassination was hardly a unique in
stance of its terrorist connections.
It has recently been confirmed that the Chilean In
telligence Service (DINA) was among the Latin American
intelligence agencies involved in a joint terrorist ar
rangement known as "Operation Condor." One objec
tive of this operation, according to an FBI cable, was the
formation of an international hit squad.
Recent letters from Michael Townley, an American
convicted in the Letelier murders, refer to alleged DINA
ties with Italian terrorist groups such as the Red Brigades.
In addition, a December 1981 FBI report implicates the
government of Chile in the production of a deadly nerve
gas for possible use by DINA agents to assassinate
Chilean dissidents abroad.
Fourth, with regar d to the cooperation required in re
solving the Letelier-Moffitt affair, the Chilean govern
ment has, on the contrary, done everything it can to pre
vent the investigation, prosecution and punishment of
the guilty parties. The junta has refused all American re
quests for the extradition of the three DINA officials who
have been indicted by a grand jury in the United States.
But what action has the Reagan administration taken
in response to Chile's recalcitrance? Ironically, the ad
ministration has actually rewarded Chile by reversing
earlier U.S. policy and extending export-import credits
to the military regime. The administration no longer
casts votes against Chile in international financial institu
tions. And before long, it may seek elimination of the re
maining restrictions on aid to Chile by providing military
support as well.
These actions represent a mockery of official U.S. op
position to state-supported terrorism. Although the Rea
gan administration has adopted a firm stand against in
ternational terrorism, it undermines its own policy by
pursuing closer ties with a government that condones
and uses terrorist tactics.
Similarly, by providing military aid, the administration
will give the appearance of approbating the current hu
man rights situation in Chile. Far from progress, there
have been more detentions, more persons held incom
municado, more exiles, more torture and more restric
tions of basic civil rights this year than last. Rather than
implicitly condoning these excesses, we must encourage
the Pinochet regime to halt the brutal actions it is taking
even now against its own people and we must adopt a
policy that offers genuine hope for a return to de
mocracy and an end to repression in Child.

more simply "disappeared," never to be heard from
again. Torture and exile were regularly used by the mili
tary regime to impose its will on the populace.
In response to the blatant violations of human rights
committed by the Chilean junta, the U.S. Congress
passed legislation in 1976 prohibiting all military as
sistance to Chile until conditions improved and respect
for democratic principles and human rights was re
stored.
Last fall, spokesmen for the Reagan administration re
quested a change in the law which would permit a re
newed military relationship with Chile. In supporting the
proposed revision, these spokesmen argued that condi
tions in Chile had improved "significantly."
Many members of Congress, however, seriously ques
tioned the wisdom of a change in policy. As a result, the
International Security and Development Cooperation
Act of 1981 included language proscribing military aid to
Chile unless President Ronald Reagan could certify (1)
that the aid is in the U.S. national interest; (2) that the
Chilean government is making substantial progress in
human rights; (3) that Chile is not aiding or abetting in
ternational terrorism; and (4) that Chile is moving ex
peditiously, using "all legal means," to bring to justice
those responsible for the assassination of former Am
bassador Orlando Letelier and his assistant Ronni Moffitt
in Washington in September 1976.
Over the past few months, there have been continual
reports that the president will submit a certification for
Chile later this year. The administration has, however,
encountered formidable difficulties in preparing such a
certification, not the least of which is the Justice Depart
ment's frank admission that General Pinochet has been
thoroughly uncooperative in the Letelier investigation.
Moreover, despite the efforts of U.N. Ambassador
Jeanne Kirkpatrick and others to lavish praise on the
Chilean junta's human riglfcs record, many in Congress
remain highly skeptical.
Indeed, if congressional committees need to decide
on the issue later this year, they will quickly discover that
the required certification cannot be approved in good
faith. The plain faci : s that none of the four points of
certification has been met.
First, on the question of U.S. national interests, al
though the Reagan administration has suggested that
military aid would induce Chile to become more sup
portive of American foreign policy, recent experience
does not bear out this claim.
Despite the administration's gestures of friendliness
and support for the Pinochet regime, Chile has con
tinued to act, in U.N. votes and elsewhere, with little re
gard for American interests. There is no reason to believe
that resumed military aid at thrs time would evoke ap
preciably greater cooperation from Chile.
Second, as far as human rights are concerned, even a
cursory examination reveals that the situation is de
teriorating, not improving. Analyses prepared over the
past year by Amnesty International, the U.N. General As
sembly, the Inter-American Commission on Human
Rights, the International League of Jurists, Freedom
House, the Inter-Parliamentary Union and many other
organizations have meticulously described continued
human rights abuses in Chile.
A 195-page study issued last November by the U.N.
Commission on Human Rights states flatly that "it is not
possible to report any improvement in the human rights
situation in Chile (or) to report the adoption of any
measures conducive to restoring the exercise of human
rights."
The report documents a long list of abuses, including
"arbitrary detentions, unlawful solitary confinement of

prisoners, physical or psychological pressures, murders
for political motives and the persecution of people who
do not agree with the opinions, measures or policies of
the government."
In the five months since the U.N. report was issued,
there have been further instances of arbitrary arrests,
torture and other abuses. In the final two months of 1981
alone, more than 20 allegations of officially-sanctioned
torture were substantiated, while a far larger number of
such cases were never even reported, for fear of reprisal.
Earlier this year, a trade union leader, Tucapal Jimenez,
was murdered shortly after he criticized the regime and
numerous other human rights activists have been ar
rested and exiled.
In view of this deplorable record of persistent human
rights violations in Chile, it is inexcusable for the Reagan
administration to pretend that "significant progress" has
been made — particularly when the State Dept.'s own
human rights report does not support such a conclusion.
Third, on the question of complicity in international
terrorism, there is again no doubt that the Chilean junta
cannot meet the specifications laid down by the Con
gress. By continuing to pay salaries to the Chilean of-

Far from progress, there have
been more detentions, more
persons held incommunicado,
more exiles, more torture and
more restrictions of basic civil
rights this year than last

ficials responsible for the Letelier murders, the Pinochet
regime vividly demonstrates its willingness to "aid and
abet" those engaged in acts of international terrorism.
Moreover, the Chilean government's sponsorship of the
Letelier-Moffitt assassination was hardly a unique in
stance of its terrorist connections.
It has recently been confirmed that the Chilean In
telligence Service (DINA) was among the Latin American
intelligence agencies involved in a joint terrorist ar
rangement known as "Operation Condor." One objec
tive of this operation, according to an FBI cable, was the
formation of an international hit squad.
Recent letters from Michael Townley, an American
convicted in the Letelier murders, refer to alleged DINA
ties with Italian terrorist groups such as the Red Brigades.
In addition, a December 1981 FBI report implicates the
government of Chile in the production of a deadly nerve
gas for possible use by DINA agents to assassinate
Chilean dissidents abroad.
Fourth, with regar d to the cooperation required in re
solving the Letelier-Moffitt affair, the Chilean govern
ment has, on the contrary, done everything it can to pre
vent the investigation, prosecution and punishment of
the guilty parties. The junta has refused all American re
quests for the extradition of the three DINA officials who
have been indicted by a grand jury in the United States.
But what action has the Reagan administration taken
in response to Chile's recalcitrance? Ironically, the ad
ministration has actually rewarded Chile by reversing
earlier U.S. policy and extending export-import credits
to the military regime. The administration no longer
casts votes against Chile in international financial institu
tions. And before long, it may seek elimination of the re
maining restrictions on aid to Chile by providing military
support as well.
These actions represent a mockery of official U.S. op
position to state-supported terrorism. Although the Rea
gan administration has adopted a firm stand against in
ternational terrorism, it undermines its own policy by
pursuing closer ties with a government that condones
and uses terrorist tactics.
Similarly, by providing military aid, the administration
will give the appearance of approbating the current hu
man rights situation in Chile. Far from progress, there
have been more detentions, more persons held incom
municado, more exiles, more torture and more restric
tions of basic civil rights this year than last. Rather than
implicitly condoning these excesses, we must encourage
the Pinochet regime to halt the brutal actions it is taking
even now against its own people and we must adopt a
policy that offers genuine hope for a return to de
mocracy and an end to repression in Child.

tions in Chile had improved "significantly."
Many members of Congress, however, seriously ques
tioned the wisdom of a change in policy. As a result, the
International Security and Development Cooperation
Act of 1981 included language proscribing military aid to
Chile unless President Ronald Reagan could certify (1)
that the aid is in the U.S. national interest; (2) that the
Chilean government is making substantial progress in
human rights; (3) that Chile is not aiding or abetting in
ternational terrorism; and (4) that Chile is moving ex
peditiously, using "all legal means," to bring to justice
those responsible for the assassination of former Am
bassador Orlando Letelier and his assistant Ronni Moffitt
in Washington in September 1976.
Over the past few months, there have been continual
reports that the president will submit a certification for
Chile later this year. The administration has, however,
encountered formidable difficulties in preparing such a
certification, not the least of which is the Justice Depart
ment's frank admission that General Pinochet has been
thoroughly uncooperative in the Letelier investigation.
Moreover, despite the efforts of U.N. Ambassador
Jeanne Kirkpatrick and others to lavish praise on the
Chilean junta's human riglfcs record, many in Congress
remain highly skeptical.
Indeed, if congressional committees need to decide
on the issue later this year, they will quickly discover that
the required certification cannot be approved in good
faith. The plain faci : s that none of the four points of
certification has been met.
First, on the question of U.S. national interests, al
though the Reagan administration has suggested that
military aid would induce Chile to become more sup
portive of American foreign policy, recent experience
does not bear out this claim.
Despite the administration's gestures of friendliness
and support for the Pinochet regime, Chile has con
tinued to act, in U.N. votes and elsewhere, with little re
gard for American interests. There is no reason to believe
that resumed military aid at thrs time would evoke ap
preciably greater cooperation from Chile.
Second, as far as human rights are concerned, even a
cursory examination reveals that the situation is de
teriorating, not improving. Analyses prepared over the
past year by Amnesty International, the U.N. General As
sembly, the Inter-American Commission on Human
Rights, the International League of Jurists, Freedom
House, the Inter-Parliamentary Union and many other
organizations have meticulously described continued
human rights abuses in Chile.
A 195-page study issued last November by the U.N.
Commission on Human Rights states flatly that "it is not
possible to report any improvement in the human rights
situation in Chile (or) to report the adoption of any
measures conducive to restoring the exercise of human
rights."
The report documents a long list of abuses, including
"arbitrary detentions, unlawful solitary confinement of

prisoners, physical or psychological pressures, murders
for political motives and the persecution of people who
do not agree with the opinions, measures or policies of
the government."
In the five months since the U.N. report was issued,
there have been further instances of arbitrary arrests,
torture and other abuses. In the final two months of 1981
alone, more than 20 allegations of officially-sanctioned
torture were substantiated, while a far larger number of
such cases were never even reported, for fear of reprisal.
Earlier this year, a trade union leader, Tucapal Jimenez,
was murdered shortly after he criticized the regime and
numerous other human rights activists have been ar
rested and exiled.
In view of this deplorable record of persistent human
rights violations in Chile, it is inexcusable for the Reagan
administration to pretend that "significant progress" has
been made — particularly when the State Dept.'s own
human rights report does not support such a conclusion.
Third, on the question of complicity in international
terrorism, there is again no doubt that the Chilean junta
cannot meet the specifications laid down by the Con
gress. By continuing to pay salaries to the Chilean of-

Far from progress, there have
been more detentions, more
persons held incommunicado,
more exiles, more torture and
more restrictions of basic civil
rights this year than last

ficials responsible for the Letelier murders, the Pinochet
regime vividly demonstrates its willingness to "aid and
abet" those engaged in acts of international terrorism.
Moreover, the Chilean government's sponsorship of the
Letelier-Moffitt assassination was hardly a unique in
stance of its terrorist connections.
It has recently been confirmed that the Chilean In
telligence Service (DINA) was among the Latin American
intelligence agencies involved in a joint terrorist ar
rangement known as "Operation Condor." One objec
tive of this operation, according to an FBI cable, was the
formation of an international hit squad.
Recent letters from Michael Townley, an American
convicted in the Letelier murders, refer to alleged DINA
ties with Italian terrorist groups such as the Red Brigades.
In addition, a December 1981 FBI report implicates the
government of Chile in the production of a deadly nerve
gas for possible use by DINA agents to assassinate
Chilean dissidents abroad.
Fourth, with regar d to the cooperation required in re
solving the Letelier-Moffitt affair, the Chilean govern
ment has, on the contrary, done everything it can to pre
vent the investigation, prosecution and punishment of
the guilty parties. The junta has refused all American re
quests for the extradition of the three DINA officials who
have been indicted by a grand jury in the United States.
But what action has the Reagan administration taken
in response to Chile's recalcitrance? Ironically, the ad
ministration has actually rewarded Chile by reversing
earlier U.S. policy and extending export-import credits
to the military regime. The administration no longer
casts votes against Chile in international financial institu
tions. And before long, it may seek elimination of the re
maining restrictions on aid to Chile by providing military
support as well.
These actions represent a mockery of official U.S. op
position to state-supported terrorism. Although the Rea
gan administration has adopted a firm stand against in
ternational terrorism, it undermines its own policy by
pursuing closer ties with a government that condones
and uses terrorist tactics.
Similarly, by providing military aid, the administration
will give the appearance of approbating the current hu
man rights situation in Chile. Far from progress, there
have been more detentions, more persons held incom
municado, more exiles, more torture and more restric
tions of basic civil rights this year than last. Rather than
implicitly condoning these excesses, we must encourage
the Pinochet regime to halt the brutal actions it is taking
even now against its own people and we must adopt a
policy that offers genuine hope for a return to de
mocracy and an end to repression in Child.
