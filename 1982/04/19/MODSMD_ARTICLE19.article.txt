## Independent women should take precautions 
### 
In the last few weeks we have been
fortunate at Stanford that the foul
tide of rapes has ebbed — but this
does not mean that the rape problem
has gone away and that we should
drop our awareness and action to
combat it.
I feel it is important for someone to
make a statement for self-defense —
for girls who refuse to walk alone and
who should feel good about it. Many
girls, upset at circumstances which
argue for restricting their movement
at night, carry a banner of "inde
pendence," refusing to "change
their lifestyle." This attitude implies
that those who do pick up the phone
to call a SURE escort, are somehow
not as independent, an attitude
which I feel is sheer baloney. I am
very persistent about finding some
one to walk with at night and I use
SURE escorts frequently; I consider
this a strong and independently
pursued maneuver; I feel proud
about my refusal to be a victim — and
I certainly haven't changed my life
style, either, by "playing it safe."
Indeed, it is a lousy situation that
girls' freedoms should be restricted
at night, but there are a lot worse sit
uations happening in the world to
day. As privileged Stanford students,
we may forget the people being
killed in El Salvador and Afghanistan
each day, or the people that go hun
gry. We are lucky that our "lousy" sit
uation has a simple and available

solution. I feel that we all owe a spe
cial thanks to the many SURE escorts
and staff — and other volunteer es
corts, too — who have really con
tributed to a constructive solution to
the rape problem at Stanford. Instead
of feeling wronged by unwanted cir
cumstances, let's feel lucky that we
have such services available. If no
one seems to be going your way any
Sunday through Thursday — even
during dead week and finals week —
just call 497-3217: a SURE escort will
appear at your door within 10
minutes.
In speaking with people about the
rape problem, I have noted that the
girls thought of as "independent"
are those who still choose to walk
alone who "decide for themselves"
what restrictions they will a follow
and who may be willing to "take
some risks." My view is a little dif
ferent: I think the girls to be ap
plauded are the ones who make a
persistent effort to defend them
selves — who refuse to be a victim!
Especially when with a simple phone
call and at most a 10-minute wait,
there need be no risk in the first place

ABM's dis(re)putable
Paul Cassell's call for the United
States to embard upon an anti
ballistic missile (ABM) program is full

of misconceptions and bad errors, (
Daily Forum April 14). His uncritical
acceptance of propaganda about the
supposed vulnerability of U.S.
strategic nuclear forces and
statement that "there is no question"
that an effective AMB system could
be built today are both faulty.
I suggest that Cassell look into the
history of the arms race to really un
derstand why new weapons systems
are developed. In the 1950s we heard
scare stories about the "bomber
gap;" in the 1960s it was the "missile
gap." Both proved to be total fabri
cations used merely terrorize the
American public and to justify
further quantum leaps in the U.S. nu
clear stockpile.
Now we hear from Washington
about the "Soviet threat" and the
"window of vulnerability." Mean
while, the State Department refuses
to let Soviet diplomats speak to pub
lic gatherings about the Soviet view
of the arms race. Oh well, I guess the
first AMendment wasn't designed to
protect those godless Communists.
Besdies, we all know that they're
pathological liars.
Every significant develpment in the
uclear arms race — the first nuclear
weapon, the first long-range bomber
group,the first ICBM,the first ballistic
missile submarine, the first multiple
warhead missile, the first cruise mis
sile, and now the highly dangerdtis

MX missile — has been initiated by
the United States. So much for all the
claptrap about "catching up" to
"meet the Soviet threat."
Cassell's claim that an ABM system
is immediately feasible is also open to
debate. A large body of opinion sug
gests that a single nuclear explosion
at a given site might then never get
off the ground.
Note that the AMB's would also be
nuclear-tipped. Hence, this rather
bizarre notion of defense involves
exploding a plethora of nuclear
weapons to destroy a handful of in
coming missiles. The cure appears to
be far worse than the disease... as
suming, of course, that the ABM sys
tem would even work, which is high
ly unlikely.
National security — whatever that
means — cannot be purchased with
another round of weapons that we
Could never use without destroying
ourselves. Nor can the arms race ge
stopped without looking at its foun
dations, such as the economics of
weapons manufacturing and the
xenophobic propaganda foisted
upon us by Washington, the nuclear
arms "experts" and the media.

argue for restricting their movement
at night, carry a banner of "inde
pendence," refusing to "change
their lifestyle." This attitude implies
that those who do pick up the phone
to call a SURE escort, are somehow
not as independent, an attitude
which I feel is sheer baloney. I am
very persistent about finding some
one to walk with at night and I use
SURE escorts frequently; I consider
this a strong and independently
pursued maneuver; I feel proud
about my refusal to be a victim — and
I certainly haven't changed my life
style, either, by "playing it safe."
Indeed, it is a lousy situation that
girls' freedoms should be restricted
at night, but there are a lot worse sit
uations happening in the world to
day. As privileged Stanford students,
we may forget the people being
killed in El Salvador and Afghanistan
each day, or the people that go hun
gry. We are lucky that our "lousy" sit
uation has a simple and available

solution. I feel that we all owe a spe
cial thanks to the many SURE escorts
and staff — and other volunteer es
corts, too — who have really con
tributed to a constructive solution to
the rape problem at Stanford. Instead
of feeling wronged by unwanted cir
cumstances, let's feel lucky that we
have such services available. If no
one seems to be going your way any
Sunday through Thursday — even
during dead week and finals week —
just call 497-3217: a SURE escort will
appear at your door within 10
minutes.
In speaking with people about the
rape problem, I have noted that the
girls thought of as "independent"
are those who still choose to walk
alone who "decide for themselves"
what restrictions they will a follow
and who may be willing to "take
some risks." My view is a little dif
ferent: I think the girls to be ap
plauded are the ones who make a
persistent effort to defend them
selves — who refuse to be a victim!
Especially when with a simple phone
call and at most a 10-minute wait,
there need be no risk in the first place

ABM's dis(re)putable
Paul Cassell's call for the United
States to embard upon an anti
ballistic missile (ABM) program is full

of misconceptions and bad errors, (
Daily Forum April 14). His uncritical
acceptance of propaganda about the
supposed vulnerability of U.S.
strategic nuclear forces and
statement that "there is no question"
that an effective AMB system could
be built today are both faulty.
I suggest that Cassell look into the
history of the arms race to really un
derstand why new weapons systems
are developed. In the 1950s we heard
scare stories about the "bomber
gap;" in the 1960s it was the "missile
gap." Both proved to be total fabri
cations used merely terrorize the
American public and to justify
further quantum leaps in the U.S. nu
clear stockpile.
Now we hear from Washington
about the "Soviet threat" and the
"window of vulnerability." Mean
while, the State Department refuses
to let Soviet diplomats speak to pub
lic gatherings about the Soviet view
of the arms race. Oh well, I guess the
first AMendment wasn't designed to
protect those godless Communists.
Besdies, we all know that they're
pathological liars.
Every significant develpment in the
uclear arms race — the first nuclear
weapon, the first long-range bomber
group,the first ICBM,the first ballistic
missile submarine, the first multiple
warhead missile, the first cruise mis
sile, and now the highly dangerdtis

MX missile — has been initiated by
the United States. So much for all the
claptrap about "catching up" to
"meet the Soviet threat."
Cassell's claim that an ABM system
is immediately feasible is also open to
debate. A large body of opinion sug
gests that a single nuclear explosion
at a given site might then never get
off the ground.
Note that the AMB's would also be
nuclear-tipped. Hence, this rather
bizarre notion of defense involves
exploding a plethora of nuclear
weapons to destroy a handful of in
coming missiles. The cure appears to
be far worse than the disease... as
suming, of course, that the ABM sys
tem would even work, which is high
ly unlikely.
National security — whatever that
means — cannot be purchased with
another round of weapons that we
Could never use without destroying
ourselves. Nor can the arms race ge
stopped without looking at its foun
dations, such as the economics of
weapons manufacturing and the
xenophobic propaganda foisted
upon us by Washington, the nuclear
arms "experts" and the media.

In the last few weeks we have been
fortunate at Stanford that the foul
tide of rapes has ebbed — but this
does not mean that the rape problem
has gone away and that we should
drop our awareness and action to
combat it.
I feel it is important for someone to
make a statement for self-defense —
for girls who refuse to walk alone and
who should feel good about it. Many
