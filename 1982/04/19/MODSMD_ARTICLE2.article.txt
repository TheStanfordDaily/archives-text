Haig continues Argentine sovereignty talks
Buenos Aires, Argentina — U.S. Secretary of State Alexander Haig re
turned to the presidential palace here yesterday for a third day of talks
with Argentina's government leadership in what appeared to be a
tenacious effort to soften a so far inflexible Argentine claim of sov
ereignty over the Falkland Islands.
Haig, who reportedly obtained an extension of the talks yesterday by
promising new proposals to an increasingly resistant Argentine leader
ship, appeared to be attempting to bring strong pressure on the military
government in a marathon effort to halt the confrontation between Ar
gentina and Britain over the South Atlantic islands.
Officials on both sides of the talks indicated late yesterday, however,
that the U.S. effort to arrange an accord that would prevent a military
fight between its two allies was close to breaking down for the second
time in 11 days of transatlantic shuttle diplomacy.
By late yesterday afternoon, with Haig in talks
with Argentine Foreign Minister Nicanor Costa
Mendez, U.S. officials said the American dele
gation's departure from Buenos Aires had still
not been scheduled and it had not been de
termined whether Haig would return to Wash
ington or shuttle across the Atlantic once again
to London.
As Haig's hard bargaining began to produce
signs of hostility among Argentine officials,
Costa Mendez told reporters yesterday that
there had been "no certain progress" in the
talks. Other Argentine officials said privately
that though the government had made con
cessions during the weekend, it could not offer
any more to the British without endangering its
own survival.
The key obstacle to a diplomatic accord be
tween Argentina and Britain, officials indicated,
remained Argentina's insistence on — and Brit
ain's refusal to accept — an implicit recognition
in an agreement of Argentina's sovereignty
over the islands, which it seized April 2 in an
armed invasion.
In his first public statement since arriving
here Thursday night, Haig stressed to reporters
yesterday that the U.S. position was that "the
question of sovereignty, it seems to me, is best
not raised in the context of the current crisis."
"There are different views on both sides,"
Haig said during a brief photo session. "Clearly
it is a subject for perhaps negotiations later."
Haig nevertheless conceded that the sov
ereignty issue "clearly has an impact on the
whole conduct of what we are discussing," and
diplomatic sources indicated that Haig had ex
tended his visit precisely because he believed a
softening of the Argentine position was essen
tial to any accord. N
Budget deadlock continues
Washington — Senate Majority Leader How
ard Baker (R-Tenn.) warned yesterday that Con
gress faces an "absolute jungle of conflict" un
less its leaders can reach a budget compromise
with White House officials in a final three days
of talks this week.
And Sen. Edward Kennedy (D-Mass.) re
jected any cuts in inflation adjustments for So
cial Security, a major deficit-reduction proposal
under study by the negotiators, adding he be
lieves that House Speaker Thomas "Tip"
O'Neill (D-Mass.) shares his view.
The talks, aimed ultimately at producing an
accord between President Ronald Reagan and
O'Neill, resumed yesterday at the White House
and will continue through tomorrow. If no
compromise has been reached by late in the
week, Baker has warned that Congress will be
gin writing its own budget, which he said yes
terday could lead to "raging" fights on the
House and Senate floors.
Interviewed on the television program "Face
the Nation" (CBS), Baker asserted that the "raw
material is there" to produce a compromise and
said the chances are "still as good as 50-50" for a
compromise that would reduce fiscal 1983's
budget deficit from $180 billion to less than $100
billion.
Reagan told him in a telephone conversation
Saturday that he is "pleased with the progress of
the negotiations so far," as Baker put it, and
"wants to see them continued."
Although the president did not say he would

accept tax increases or defense cuts, Baker said
he is "encouraged to think" that Reagan would
accept an income surtax on the wealthy as well
as some reductions in the defense spending in
crease that the administration wants over the
next three years.
Senate Budget Committee Chairman Pete
Domenici (R-N.M.) appeared less optimistic as
he arrived at the White House for yesterday's
meeting. Asked if the negotiators were close to
agreement, Domenici replied, "No."
Several of the participants said they did not
anticipate an agreement quickly. "I hope this
week, but not today," said House Budget Com
mittee Chairman James Jones (D-Okla.). After
the three-hour meeting, Senate Finance Com
mittee Chairman Robert Dole (R-Kan.) said a
compromise was still "a few days" away. "We're
making headway," Dole said.
Israel may not complete
withdrawal from Sinai
Jerusalem — The Israeli Cabinet reviewed
charges of Egyptian violations of the Camp
David treaty yesterday but put off for three
more days a final decision on whether Israel
would complete the withdrawal from the Sinai
by next Sunday as required by the 1979 accords.
"The government has made no decision up to
now not to withdraw from the Sinai," Cabinet
spokesman Dan Merridor said, using a double
negative that only served to emphasize the pos
sibility that Jerusalem may yet renege on its
agreement to return the desert peninsula to
Egypt.
Merridor said the Cabinet would convene
again Wednesday — hours after a scheduled
meeting between Prime Minister Menachem
Begin and Egyptian Foreign Minister Kamal
Hassan Ali — "to discuss policy and adopt reso
lutions."
In the meantime, however, the Cabinet
agreed with Begin's plan to proceed with the
final forced evacuation of Israeli civilians from
the peninsula, which Israel captured from Egypt
in the Six-Day War of 1967.
FBI director defends Abscam
Washington — Breaking a long, self-imposed
silence, FBI Director William Webster has
strongly defended the FBl's controversial
Abscam investigation and has made clear that
he would use the same undercover tactics
again, if necessary.
With firmness and occasionally some heat,
Webster declared that "we will always follow
our leads." And he dismissed allegations that
the investigation, which resulted in the convic
tion of seven members of Congress on bribery
and other charges, somehow trapped innocent
men.
During a 90-minute interview in his office last
week with two Los Angeles Times reporters, the
FBI chief and former federal judge offered
point-by-point replies to criticism of Abscam by
Sen. Alan Cranston (D-Calif.) and others.
In rapid-fire order, he said that:
—The FBI uses "con men" and others with
criminal records in such investigations because
that is what it takes to catch the guilty. "Abscam
was purposely sleazy so that no one would stick
around it, except someone who wanted to deal
with sleazy people," he said.
—Abscam did not set out to investigate mem

hers of Congress but instead began as an at
tempt to catch art thieves. As the inquiry de
veloped, it moved into other areas and con
gressmen walked into the net. "We did not
select any congressmen," Webster said. "They
were self-selected. They found their way to us."
—Anyone who listens to the FBI tapes of
meetings between public officials and under
cover agents will learn the extent of the corrup
tion.
"If you hear those tapes, you get some idea of
how blatantly corrupt those discussions were.
There wasn't anything coy about them."
Britain firm ori Falkland terms
London — Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher
returned to No. 10 Downing Street from a
morning spent yesterday at her country retreat
to await developments of Secretary of State
Alexander Haig's mission to Buenos Aires.
Aides at her office said that Thatcher, who
talked with President Ronald Reagan by tele
phone late Saturday night has not changed her
views on what would satisfy Britain in the dis
pute with Argentina over the Falkland Islands.
Thatcher's office said her government would
continue to insist on Argentina's withdrawal of
its invasion forces and restoration of British con
trol over the islands before entering any dis
cussions over eventual change in sovereignty of
the Falklands. The question of sovereignty,
which both nations claim and are unwilling to
relinquish, seems to be the main sticking point
in the Haig talks.
Education Sec. Bell may resign
Washington — Word is circulating that Secre
tary of Education Terrel Bell will resign. One
version says it may be even this week; another
says it could be in July, when he will be eligible
for a federal pension.
In the last few months he has been on a
tightrope, dodging constant attacks from mem
bers of Congress, the education establishment
and the New Right over the Reagan adminis
tration's attitude toward public schools.
The battering has triggered periodic rumors
that Bell isaboutto fall,andthe whispers started
again 10 days ago after the White House or
dered the firing of his chief deputy, William
Clohan.
But Bell was at the Capitol Thursday defend
ing the education cuts in the budget. And he
said afterward that he has been too busy even to
think about resigning. "What's that old saying
about 'When the going gets tough'? " he asked
with a grin.
A close associate said, "He's very happy and
settled. He has no intention of resigning." But
the friend added later, "It's been a roller
coaster. One day he's ready to leave. The next,
he's going to stick it out."
Today's Weather
Clear and warmer through tomorrow. Lows
in the upper 40s and 50s. Highs in the 70s to mid
80s today and the upper 70s and 80s tomorrow.
North to northeast winds 10 to 20 mph through
tomorrow.

O'Neill, resumed yesterday at the White House
and will continue through tomorrow. If no
compromise has been reached by late in the
week, Baker has warned that Congress will be
gin writing its own budget, which he said yes
terday could lead to "raging" fights on the
House and Senate floors.
Interviewed on the television program "Face
the Nation" (CBS), Baker asserted that the "raw
material is there" to produce a compromise and
said the chances are "still as good as 50-50" for a
compromise that would reduce fiscal 1983's
budget deficit from $180 billion to less than $100
billion.
Reagan told him in a telephone conversation
Saturday that he is "pleased with the progress of
the negotiations so far," as Baker put it, and
"wants to see them continued."
Although the president did not say he would

accept tax increases or defense cuts, Baker said
he is "encouraged to think" that Reagan would
accept an income surtax on the wealthy as well
as some reductions in the defense spending in
crease that the administration wants over the
next three years.
Senate Budget Committee Chairman Pete
Domenici (R-N.M.) appeared less optimistic as
he arrived at the White House for yesterday's
meeting. Asked if the negotiators were close to
agreement, Domenici replied, "No."
Several of the participants said they did not
anticipate an agreement quickly. "I hope this
week, but not today," said House Budget Com
mittee Chairman James Jones (D-Okla.). After
the three-hour meeting, Senate Finance Com
mittee Chairman Robert Dole (R-Kan.) said a
compromise was still "a few days" away. "We're
making headway," Dole said.
Israel may not complete
withdrawal from Sinai
Jerusalem — The Israeli Cabinet reviewed
charges of Egyptian violations of the Camp
David treaty yesterday but put off for three
more days a final decision on whether Israel
would complete the withdrawal from the Sinai
by next Sunday as required by the 1979 accords.
"The government has made no decision up to
now not to withdraw from the Sinai," Cabinet
spokesman Dan Merridor said, using a double
negative that only served to emphasize the pos
sibility that Jerusalem may yet renege on its
agreement to return the desert peninsula to
Egypt.
Merridor said the Cabinet would convene
again Wednesday — hours after a scheduled
meeting between Prime Minister Menachem
Begin and Egyptian Foreign Minister Kamal
Hassan Ali — "to discuss policy and adopt reso
lutions."
In the meantime, however, the Cabinet
agreed with Begin's plan to proceed with the
final forced evacuation of Israeli civilians from
the peninsula, which Israel captured from Egypt
in the Six-Day War of 1967.
FBI director defends Abscam
Washington — Breaking a long, self-imposed
silence, FBI Director William Webster has
strongly defended the FBl's controversial
Abscam investigation and has made clear that
he would use the same undercover tactics
again, if necessary.
With firmness and occasionally some heat,
Webster declared that "we will always follow
our leads." And he dismissed allegations that
the investigation, which resulted in the convic
tion of seven members of Congress on bribery
and other charges, somehow trapped innocent
men.
During a 90-minute interview in his office last
week with two Los Angeles Times reporters, the
FBI chief and former federal judge offered
point-by-point replies to criticism of Abscam by
Sen. Alan Cranston (D-Calif.) and others.
In rapid-fire order, he said that:
—The FBI uses "con men" and others with
criminal records in such investigations because
that is what it takes to catch the guilty. "Abscam
was purposely sleazy so that no one would stick
around it, except someone who wanted to deal
with sleazy people," he said.
—Abscam did not set out to investigate mem

hers of Congress but instead began as an at
tempt to catch art thieves. As the inquiry de
veloped, it moved into other areas and con
gressmen walked into the net. "We did not
select any congressmen," Webster said. "They
were self-selected. They found their way to us."
—Anyone who listens to the FBI tapes of
meetings between public officials and under
cover agents will learn the extent of the corrup
tion.
"If you hear those tapes, you get some idea of
how blatantly corrupt those discussions were.
There wasn't anything coy about them."
Britain firm ori Falkland terms
London — Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher
returned to No. 10 Downing Street from a
morning spent yesterday at her country retreat
to await developments of Secretary of State
Alexander Haig's mission to Buenos Aires.
Aides at her office said that Thatcher, who
talked with President Ronald Reagan by tele
phone late Saturday night has not changed her
views on what would satisfy Britain in the dis
pute with Argentina over the Falkland Islands.
Thatcher's office said her government would
continue to insist on Argentina's withdrawal of
its invasion forces and restoration of British con
trol over the islands before entering any dis
cussions over eventual change in sovereignty of
the Falklands. The question of sovereignty,
which both nations claim and are unwilling to
relinquish, seems to be the main sticking point
in the Haig talks.
Education Sec. Bell may resign
Washington — Word is circulating that Secre
tary of Education Terrel Bell will resign. One
version says it may be even this week; another
says it could be in July, when he will be eligible
for a federal pension.
In the last few months he has been on a
tightrope, dodging constant attacks from mem
bers of Congress, the education establishment
and the New Right over the Reagan adminis
tration's attitude toward public schools.
The battering has triggered periodic rumors
that Bell isaboutto fall,andthe whispers started
again 10 days ago after the White House or
dered the firing of his chief deputy, William
Clohan.
But Bell was at the Capitol Thursday defend
ing the education cuts in the budget. And he
said afterward that he has been too busy even to
think about resigning. "What's that old saying
about 'When the going gets tough'? " he asked
with a grin.
A close associate said, "He's very happy and
settled. He has no intention of resigning." But
the friend added later, "It's been a roller
coaster. One day he's ready to leave. The next,
he's going to stick it out."
Today's Weather
Clear and warmer through tomorrow. Lows
in the upper 40s and 50s. Highs in the 70s to mid

Haig continues Argentine sovereignty talks
Buenos Aires, Argentina — U.S. Secretary of State Alexander Haig re
turned to the presidential palace here yesterday for a third day of talks
with Argentina's government leadership in what appeared to be a
tenacious effort to soften a so far inflexible Argentine claim of sov
ereignty over the Falkland Islands.
Haig, who reportedly obtained an extension of the talks yesterday by
promising new proposals to an increasingly resistant Argentine leader
ship, appeared to be attempting to bring strong pressure on the military
government in a marathon effort to halt the confrontation between Ar
gentina and Britain over the South Atlantic islands.
Officials on both sides of the talks indicated late yesterday, however,
that the U.S. effort to arrange an accord that would prevent a military
fight between its two allies was close to breaking down for the second
time in 11 days of transatlantic shuttle diplomacy.
By late yesterday afternoon, with Haig in talks
with Argentine Foreign Minister Nicanor Costa
Mendez, U.S. officials said the American dele
gation's departure from Buenos Aires had still
not been scheduled and it had not been de
termined whether Haig would return to Wash
ington or shuttle across the Atlantic once again
to London.
As Haig's hard bargaining began to produce
signs of hostility among Argentine officials,
Costa Mendez told reporters yesterday that
there had been "no certain progress" in the
talks. Other Argentine officials said privately
that though the government had made con
cessions during the weekend, it could not offer
any more to the British without endangering its
own survival.
The key obstacle to a diplomatic accord be
tween Argentina and Britain, officials indicated,
remained Argentina's insistence on — and Brit
ain's refusal to accept — an implicit recognition
in an agreement of Argentina's sovereignty
over the islands, which it seized April 2 in an
armed invasion.
In his first public statement since arriving
here Thursday night, Haig stressed to reporters
yesterday that the U.S. position was that "the
question of sovereignty, it seems to me, is best
not raised in the context of the current crisis."
"There are different views on both sides,"
Haig said during a brief photo session. "Clearly
it is a subject for perhaps negotiations later."
Haig nevertheless conceded that the sov
ereignty issue "clearly has an impact on the
whole conduct of what we are discussing," and
diplomatic sources indicated that Haig had ex
tended his visit precisely because he believed a
softening of the Argentine position was essen
tial to any accord. N
Budget deadlock continues
Washington — Senate Majority Leader How
ard Baker (R-Tenn.) warned yesterday that Con
gress faces an "absolute jungle of conflict" un
less its leaders can reach a budget compromise
with White House officials in a final three days
of talks this week.
And Sen. Edward Kennedy (D-Mass.) re
jected any cuts in inflation adjustments for So
cial Security, a major deficit-reduction proposal
under study by the negotiators, adding he be
lieves that House Speaker Thomas "Tip"
O'Neill (D-Mass.) shares his view.

O'Neill, resumed yesterday at the White House

tion of seven members of Congress on bribery
and other charges, somehow trapped innocent
men.
During a 90-minute interview in his office last
week with two Los Angeles Times reporters, the
FBI chief and former federal judge offered
point-by-point replies to criticism of Abscam by
Sen. Alan Cranston (D-Calif.) and others.
In rapid-fire order, he said that:
—The FBI uses "con men" and others with
criminal records in such investigations because
that is what it takes to catch the guilty. "Abscam
was purposely sleazy so that no one would stick
around it, except someone who wanted to deal
with sleazy people," he said.
—Abscam did not set out to investigate mem

hers of Congress but instead began as an at
tempt to catch art thieves. As the inquiry de
veloped, it moved into other areas and con
gressmen walked into the net. "We did not
select any congressmen," Webster said. "They
were self-selected. They found their way to us."
—Anyone who listens to the FBI tapes of
meetings between public officials and under
cover agents will learn the extent of the corrup
tion.
"If you hear those tapes, you get some idea of
how blatantly corrupt those discussions were.
There wasn't anything coy about them."
Britain firm ori Falkland terms
London — Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher
returned to No. 10 Downing Street from a
morning spent yesterday at her country retreat
to await developments of Secretary of State
Alexander Haig's mission to Buenos Aires.
Aides at her office said that Thatcher, who
talked with President Ronald Reagan by tele
phone late Saturday night has not changed her
views on what would satisfy Britain in the dis
pute with Argentina over the Falkland Islands.
Thatcher's office said her government would
continue to insist on Argentina's withdrawal of
its invasion forces and restoration of British con
trol over the islands before entering any dis
cussions over eventual change in sovereignty of
the Falklands. The question of sovereignty,
which both nations claim and are unwilling to
relinquish, seems to be the main sticking point
in the Haig talks.
Education Sec. Bell may resign
Washington — Word is circulating that Secre
tary of Education Terrel Bell will resign. One
version says it may be even this week; another
says it could be in July, when he will be eligible
for a federal pension.
In the last few months he has been on a
tightrope, dodging constant attacks from mem
bers of Congress, the education establishment
and the New Right over the Reagan adminis
tration's attitude toward public schools.
The battering has triggered periodic rumors
that Bell isaboutto fall,andthe whispers started
again 10 days ago after the White House or
dered the firing of his chief deputy, William
Clohan.
But Bell was at the Capitol Thursday defend
ing the education cuts in the budget. And he
said afterward that he has been too busy even to
think about resigning. "What's that old saying
about 'When the going gets tough'? " he asked
with a grin.
A close associate said, "He's very happy and
settled. He has no intention of resigning." But
the friend added later, "It's been a roller
coaster. One day he's ready to leave. The next,
he's going to stick it out."

Haig continues Argentine sovereignty talks
Buenos Aires, Argentina — U.S. Secretary of State Alexander Haig re
turned to the presidential palace here yesterday for a third day of talks
with Argentina's government leadership in what appeared to be a
tenacious effort to soften a so far inflexible Argentine claim of sov
ereignty over the Falkland Islands.
Haig, who reportedly obtained an extension of the talks yesterday by
promising new proposals to an increasingly resistant Argentine leader
ship, appeared to be attempting to bring strong pressure on the military
government in a marathon effort to halt the confrontation between Ar
gentina and Britain over the South Atlantic islands.
Officials on both sides of the talks indicated late yesterday, however,
that the U.S. effort to arrange an accord that would prevent a military
fight between its two allies was close to breaking down for the second
time in 11 days of transatlantic shuttle diplomacy.
By late yesterday afternoon, with Haig in talks
with Argentine Foreign Minister Nicanor Costa
Mendez, U.S. officials said the American dele
gation's departure from Buenos Aires had still
not been scheduled and it had not been de
termined whether Haig would return to Wash
ington or shuttle across the Atlantic once again
to London.
As Haig's hard bargaining began to produce
signs of hostility among Argentine officials,
Costa Mendez told reporters yesterday that
there had been "no certain progress" in the
talks. Other Argentine officials said privately
that though the government had made con
cessions during the weekend, it could not offer
any more to the British without endangering its
own survival.
The key obstacle to a diplomatic accord be
tween Argentina and Britain, officials indicated,
remained Argentina's insistence on — and Brit
ain's refusal to accept — an implicit recognition
in an agreement of Argentina's sovereignty
over the islands, which it seized April 2 in an
armed invasion.
In his first public statement since arriving
here Thursday night, Haig stressed to reporters
yesterday that the U.S. position was that "the
question of sovereignty, it seems to me, is best
not raised in the context of the current crisis."
"There are different views on both sides,"
Haig said during a brief photo session. "Clearly
it is a subject for perhaps negotiations later."
Haig nevertheless conceded that the sov
ereignty issue "clearly has an impact on the
whole conduct of what we are discussing," and
diplomatic sources indicated that Haig had ex
tended his visit precisely because he believed a
softening of the Argentine position was essen
tial to any accord. N
Budget deadlock continues
Washington — Senate Majority Leader How
ard Baker (R-Tenn.) warned yesterday that Con
gress faces an "absolute jungle of conflict" un
less its leaders can reach a budget compromise
with White House officials in a final three days
of talks this week.
And Sen. Edward Kennedy (D-Mass.) re
jected any cuts in inflation adjustments for So
cial Security, a major deficit-reduction proposal
under study by the negotiators, adding he be
lieves that House Speaker Thomas "Tip"
O'Neill (D-Mass.) shares his view.
The talks, aimed ultimately at producing an
accord between President Ronald Reagan and
O'Neill, resumed yesterday at the White House
and will continue through tomorrow. If no
compromise has been reached by late in the
week, Baker has warned that Congress will be
gin writing its own budget, which he said yes
terday could lead to "raging" fights on the
House and Senate floors.
Interviewed on the television program "Face
the Nation" (CBS), Baker asserted that the "raw
material is there" to produce a compromise and
said the chances are "still as good as 50-50" for a
compromise that would reduce fiscal 1983's
budget deficit from $180 billion to less than $100
billion.
Reagan told him in a telephone conversation
Saturday that he is "pleased with the progress of
the negotiations so far," as Baker put it, and
"wants to see them continued."
Although the president did not say he would

accept tax increases or defense cuts, Baker said
he is "encouraged to think" that Reagan would
accept an income surtax on the wealthy as well
as some reductions in the defense spending in
crease that the administration wants over the
next three years.
Senate Budget Committee Chairman Pete
Domenici (R-N.M.) appeared less optimistic as
he arrived at the White House for yesterday's
meeting. Asked if the negotiators were close to
agreement, Domenici replied, "No."
Several of the participants said they did not
anticipate an agreement quickly. "I hope this
week, but not today," said House Budget Com
mittee Chairman James Jones (D-Okla.). After
the three-hour meeting, Senate Finance Com
mittee Chairman Robert Dole (R-Kan.) said a
compromise was still "a few days" away. "We're
making headway," Dole said.
Israel may not complete
withdrawal from Sinai
Jerusalem — The Israeli Cabinet reviewed
charges of Egyptian violations of the Camp
David treaty yesterday but put off for three
more days a final decision on whether Israel
would complete the withdrawal from the Sinai
by next Sunday as required by the 1979 accords.
"The government has made no decision up to
now not to withdraw from the Sinai," Cabinet
spokesman Dan Merridor said, using a double
negative that only served to emphasize the pos
sibility that Jerusalem may yet renege on its
agreement to return the desert peninsula to
Egypt.
Merridor said the Cabinet would convene
again Wednesday — hours after a scheduled
meeting between Prime Minister Menachem
Begin and Egyptian Foreign Minister Kamal
Hassan Ali — "to discuss policy and adopt reso
lutions."
In the meantime, however, the Cabinet
agreed with Begin's plan to proceed with the
final forced evacuation of Israeli civilians from
the peninsula, which Israel captured from Egypt
in the Six-Day War of 1967.
FBI director defends Abscam
Washington — Breaking a long, self-imposed
silence, FBI Director William Webster has
strongly defended the FBl's controversial
Abscam investigation and has made clear that
he would use the same undercover tactics
again, if necessary.
With firmness and occasionally some heat,
Webster declared that "we will always follow
our leads." And he dismissed allegations that
the investigation, which resulted in the convic
tion of seven members of Congress on bribery
and other charges, somehow trapped innocent
men.
