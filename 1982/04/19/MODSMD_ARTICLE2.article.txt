Haig continues Argentine sovereignty talks
Buenos Aires, Argentina â€” U.S. Secretary of State Alexander Haig re
turned to the presidential palace here yesterday for a third day of talks
with Argentina's government leadership in what appeared to be a
tenacious effort to soften a so far inflexible Argentine claim of sov
ereignty over the Falkland Islands.
Haig, who reportedly obtained an extension of the talks yesterday by
promising new proposals to an increasingly resistant Argentine leader
ship, appeared to be attempting to bring strong pressure on the military
government in a marathon effort to halt the confrontation between Ar
gentina and Britain over the South Atlantic islands.
Officials on both sides of the talks indicated late yesterday, however,
that the U.S. effort to arrange an accord that would prevent a military
fight between its two allies was close to breaking down for the second
time in 11 days of transatlantic shuttle diplomacy.
