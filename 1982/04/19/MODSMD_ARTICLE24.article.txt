## Hardey-Rasmussen clinch win Netters stun USC in marathon 
### Sid Spaeth 
Frank Brennan, women's
tennis coach and master of un
derstatement, felt last week
that his doubles teams were
beginning to gel (as in Jell-O),
but what they did in their 5-4
final-hour win over USC Satur
day, was more like forge.
What usually happens when
the Cardinal plays USC is more
of the former and lessof the lat
ter.
Stanford had not beaten USC
since the finals of the AIAW
Tournament in 1978. Brennan

came here two years later.
Stanford, undefeated in 13
matches this season, ranked
No. 1 in the country and
possessing three of the nation's
top five singles players along
with the defending national
champion doubles team, was
ironically sparked to victory by
a No. 4 doubles team that was
thrown in against the Trojans
when Kate Gompert sprained
her ankle last week.
Alison Hardey and Sue
Rasmussen, waiting for a
chance to crack the solid
Cardinal core, came out and
clinched Stanford's victory
with a 6-1, 3-6, 6-3 win over
Nina Voydat and Paolo
Sessario.
The outcome of the see-saw
battle played in blistering heat
in front of 1000 fans at the Varsi
ty Courts, was never assured
until Hardey and Rasmussen
nonchalantly rolled past USC
in what was not supposed to be
a crucial match.
Hardey also replaced Gom
pert in singles and stormed past
Susan Pendo 7-5, 6-2 at No. 6.
Stanford did not receive any
points from Elise Burgin who
spent more than 4Vi hours on
the court Saturday. Burgin
cramped up in the second set
of her singles match against
freshman Cecilia Fernandez at
No. 2 singles before losing
three match points and even
tually the match 6-4, 6-7 (6-8),
3-6.
"I'm surprised we won and
did not get any points from
Elise..' Brennan said. "I guess

it's a sign of a good team that
everyone picks up when some
one is down."
"My mind went through the
whole range of thoughts,"
Brennan continued. "First I
thought we were going to win,
then I thought we were going
to lose, then I was sure we were
going to lose, then I was sure
we were going to win. . .
"I never thought it would
come down to the third
doubles. I got Hardey and
Rasmussen into some matches
in Detroit (the National Indoor
Championships) because we
were so far ahead. They were
gaining some confidence, but I
never thought they would end
up being in the deciding match
against USC."
It was the veteran Alycia
Moulton, however, who set
the stage for the Hardey-
Rasmussen heroics.
After watching Burgin lose
her three-hour slugfest with
Fernandez, Moulton took cen
ter court against Kelly Henry in
No. 1 singles as Stanford trailed
2-3.
"I don't think I have ever
seen Alycia play better," Bren
nan said after Moulton's 5-7,
6-2, 7-6 win over Henry that
tied the match going into the
doubles.
Moulton's win gave Stanford
the momentum and the
Cardinal was not about to lose.
Caryn Copeland, before team
ing with Moulton for the No. 2
doubles match said, "We're
gonna win it now."
It took the defending AIAW

champs about 40 minutes to
thrash Anna Lucia Fernandez
and her younger sister Cecilia
6-1, 6-0. In the second set,
Moulton-Copeland went
ahead 4-0 after cooliy winning
every game on a 3-3 sudden
victory point.
"That was the old team,"
Copeland said referring to
their championship doubles
team of a year ago that has had
problems finding their magic
this year. "Tex (Moulton)
played great — I have a great
partner."
"I knew they could do it un
der pressure," Brennan said.
"We clinched a lot of matches
after the singles so when the
pressure was not on, Alycia and
Caryn sometimes lost their
'competitive edge. When the
pressure is on, though, I know
they're going to be able to do
it."
At No. 1 doubles, Gompert,
who according to Brennan was
playing at about 80 percent
speed because of the cramps,
and Linda Gates lost their first
match of the season to Henry
and Susan Pendo 6-4, 6-7 (6-8)
4-6.
In singles, Gates did a little
stage preparation herself beat
ing two-time All-America Nina
Voydat with surprising ease
6-4,6-3 in No. 3 singles.
Friday, the Cardinal rolled
past UC-Santa Barbara 8-1.
Stanford travels to Ojai for the
Ojai Intercollegiates Thursday
through Sunday.
