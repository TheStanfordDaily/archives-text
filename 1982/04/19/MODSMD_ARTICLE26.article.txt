### Adam Berns 
The Stanford baseball team exploded for 10
runs in the seventh inning en route to a 16-5
drubbing of the UCLA Bruins in an important
conference game yesterday. The Cardinal
split a pair on Saturday with UCLAand has sol
idified its second place spot in the 6-Pac with
a 13-8 conference record.
Stanford, now 34-13-1 overall (24-3-1 at
Sunken Diamond), lost the series opener on
Saturday 4-3, but came back to win the sec
ond game 9-3, and yesterday's finale.
The most encouraging sign about the series
was that Stanford was hitting the ball well,
coach Mark Marquess said.
"We felt that we would hit the ball today,"
Marquess said after yesterday's game. "I felt
that we were even hitting the ball better in
the first game (on Saturday), but we were just
hitting it right at people.

"Besides the home runs that we hit, we had
several which came extremely close to going
out."
Both teams had home run fever during the
series as they combined for 11 home runs
(five by Stanford).
Mike Dotterer and Bob Hausladen paced
the Cardinal attack. Dotterer had two home
runs including a grand slam, both in yester
day's game, while Hausladen, playing in pain
with a sore back, banged out six hits.
"Thursday, Hausladen couldn't even swing
a bat," Marquess noted. "I didn't think that
he would be playing this weekend."
Stanford pitcher Brian Mignano gave up
only four hits in the opener on Saturday, but
was tagged with the loss while Cardinal
sophomore Brian Myers went the distance in
the second game and received credit for the
