Los Angeles — It's a new
conglomerate: USCLA. The
two schools combined to
shellshock the Stanford men's
tennis team Friday and Satur
day in Los Angeles by identical
7-2 scores.
"Let's pretend we're the
Germans," they said. "You're
the French at Dunkirk." Stan
ford's only match wins came at
Nos.l and 2 doubles after both
USC and UCLA swept each of
six singles spots with agonizing
ly meticulous play.
But head coach Dick Gould
saw more than the match
scores. "I didn't see anything
down there that a good, vocal
home crowd wouldn't fix," he
said.

If close matches count for
anything then Stanford won
hands down as a total of seven
singles matches went to three
sets over the course of the
weekend. Only problem was,
the final numbers simply didn't
fall into place. The most sur
prising losses of the weekend
came at the No.l spot, where
Stanford sophomore Scott
Davis fell to Matt Anger of USC
and Robbie Venter of UCLA
with startling rapidity.
Davis had only two sets with
Anger, a freshman who is
blessed with a Super Hero com
ic book name and a two-fisted
backhand to match. They
traded serves in the first set un
til 6-6, and then Davis took a 4-2

advantage in the tiebreaker
only to let it slip away, and
more besides. Captain Marvel
laid into his final serve for an
ace at 4-6 points for the first set
7-6.
Davis broke serve for the first
time in the match at 3-3 in the
second set to take a 4-3 advan
tage, only to let The Human
Torch break right back for the
first time as well. Batman held
serve and then broke Davis yet
again for the match, 6-7 4-6.
Saturday's match against
UCLA's senior All-America
Robbie Venter was the three
setter it should have been, but
the final set scores were just a
little askew. Davis took the first

set easily 6-3, breaking Venter
at 2-1 and again at 3-2.
But Davis' first serve wasn't
working and Venter began re
turning the favors, breaking
the Cardinal in the second
game to take a 2-0 lead, again at
}-2, and one more time for the
second set 6-3. From then on
Davis couldn't hold a thing
much less his serve or concen
tration as he lost 0-6 in the final
set.
And so it went for the rest of
the Stanford field. At N0.2
sophomore Mark McKeen was
dropped by senior All-America
Marcel Freeman 3-6, 4-6, and
Card senior John Corse also
lost in two sets, to Blaine
Willenbourg 2-6, 2-6. At N0.4
senior Jeff Arons fell to Dan
Saltz 6-7 (4-7), 3-6, senior Scott
Bondurant was beaten down
7-5, 2-6, 3-6 by Bruce Brescia at
N0.5, and freshman Paul Rob
inson (playing for an injured
Jim Miller) lost to John Davis
3-6, 6-4,4-6.
Against USC Friday McKnen

was downed in straight sets 3-6,
1-6 by Sean Brawley, and Tro
jan Todd Whiteskein wore
down Corse 7-5, 3-6,0-6. Arons
fought through one of the
closer matches of the weekend
against Roger Knapp, but let it
go 6-4, 3-6, 4-6. The same was
true at N0.5 where Bondurant
lost to another wonder
freshman in Trojan Tony Emer
son, and at N0.6 where Rob
inson lost a heartbreaker to Jim
Agate 7-6 (7-3) 5-7, 3-6.

jan Todd Whiteskein wore
down Corse 7-5, 3-6,0-6. Arons
fought through one of the
closer matches of the weekend
against Roger Knapp, but let it
go 6-4, 3-6, 4-6. The same was
true at N0.5 where Bondurant
lost to another wonder
freshman in Trojan Tony Emer
son, and at N0.6 where Rob
inson lost a heartbreaker to Jim
Agate 7-6 (7-3) 5-7, 3-6.
Los Angeles — It's a new
conglomerate: USCLA. The
two schools combined to
shellshock the Stanford men's
tennis team Friday and Satur
day in Los Angeles by identical
7-2 scores.
"Let's pretend we're the
Germans," they said. "You're
the French at Dunkirk." Stan
ford's only match wins came at
Nos.l and 2 doubles after both
USC and UCLA swept each of
six singles spots with agonizing
ly meticulous play.
But head coach Dick Gould
saw more than the match
scores. "I didn't see anything
down there that a good, vocal
home crowd wouldn't fix," he
said.

If close matches count for
anything then Stanford won
hands down as a total of seven
singles matches went to three
sets over the course of the
weekend. Only problem was,
the final numbers simply didn't
fall into place. The most sur
prising losses of the weekend
came at the No.l spot, where
Stanford sophomore Scott
Davis fell to Matt Anger of USC
and Robbie Venter of UCLA
with startling rapidity.
Davis had only two sets with
Anger, a freshman who is
blessed with a Super Hero com
ic book name and a two-fisted
backhand to match. They
traded serves in the first set un
til 6-6, and then Davis took a 4-2

advantage in the tiebreaker
only to let it slip away, and
more besides. Captain Marvel
laid into his final serve for an
ace at 4-6 points for the first set
7-6.
Davis broke serve for the first
time in the match at 3-3 in the
second set to take a 4-3 advan
tage, only to let The Human
Torch break right back for the
first time as well. Batman held
serve and then broke Davis yet
again for the match, 6-7 4-6.
Saturday's match against
UCLA's senior All-America
Robbie Venter was the three
setter it should have been, but
the final set scores were just a
little askew. Davis took the first

set easily 6-3, breaking Venter
at 2-1 and again at 3-2.
But Davis' first serve wasn't
working and Venter began re
turning the favors, breaking
the Cardinal in the second
game to take a 2-0 lead, again at
}-2, and one more time for the
second set 6-3. From then on
Davis couldn't hold a thing
much less his serve or concen
tration as he lost 0-6 in the final
set.
And so it went for the rest of
the Stanford field. At N0.2
sophomore Mark McKeen was
dropped by senior All-America
Marcel Freeman 3-6, 4-6, and
Card senior John Corse also
lost in two sets, to Blaine
Willenbourg 2-6, 2-6. At N0.4
senior Jeff Arons fell to Dan
Saltz 6-7 (4-7), 3-6, senior Scott
Bondurant was beaten down
7-5, 2-6, 3-6 by Bruce Brescia at
N0.5, and freshman Paul Rob
inson (playing for an injured
Jim Miller) lost to John Davis
3-6, 6-4,4-6.
Against USC Friday McKnen

was downed in straight sets 3-6,
1-6 by Sean Brawley, and Tro
jan Todd Whiteskein wore
down Corse 7-5, 3-6,0-6. Arons
fought through one of the
closer matches of the weekend
against Roger Knapp, but let it
go 6-4, 3-6, 4-6. The same was
true at N0.5 where Bondurant
lost to another wonder
