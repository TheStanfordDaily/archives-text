### Robert Stone 
I the South Bay hills and
Ldless skies created the
•feet backdrop for the star-
Kdded Bruce JennerMichelob
It Classic Saturday.
■ he 7500 spectators who sur
unded the San Jose City Col
ie Stadium were treated to a
K filled with personal rec
ps, camaraderie, TV crews,
p overall fun and excellence.
Id the 125 diehards who
kited around to see the last
jent witnessed track history as
|2-year-old American record
is shattered.
The Carl Lewises, Steve
otts, and Willie Banks did
£jr thing collecting first
aces, but javelin thrower Bob
)ggy stole the show with a
ss of 307-feet, six inches, eras
g-Mark Murro's standard of
0-0 set in 1970. The javelin
>mpetition began late in the
ternoon after most of the
owd and many press mem
ers and judges exited — but it
as the biggest stir of the meet
>r the handful of observers
■ft.
The 25-year old Roggy set
le mark on his fourth throw of
x attempts. After the release
ie javelin didn't peak and
rop, as did the other tosses, it
ailed at a lower height and
ailed and sailed. It went
>eyond the sideline markers
ind past the officials, and was
he farthest throw ever on this
;ontinent.
Recovering from patella ten
dmitis in his left leg, Roggy
hadn't thrown in three weeks
I prior to this 1982 debut. "I ex
pected maybe 270 after coming
off the tendinitis, but I felt

good, I was comfortable on the
runway. I didn't have con
fidence in the knee last night, I
almost skipped the meet...but
my knee and elbow (injured
last year) felt great today," he
said.
Lewis, the world leader in
the 100-meters and the long
jump, sprinted the fastest cen
tury of the year with a 10.13 sec
ond clocking, lowering the
10.16 mark he set a few weeks
ago. The 20-year-old New Jer
sey native was slated to long
jump, but withdrew because
he's working on a longer ap
proach.
Lewis tried his hand at yet an
other event, the 200-meters,
and set a personal record of
20.27 en route to a first place tie
with Jeff Phillips of Athletics
West. Coming into the stretch
Lewis forged ahead of the
pack, but Phillips came from
behind in a finish that defied
the cameras.
A jubilant Lewis told the Dai
ly, "I felt great, I knocked off .4
of a second in the 200. I just
wanted to break 20.5 today — I
felt good all the way.
"People think it gets

monotonous to win and win
and win, but when I set person
al goals and reach them, like I
did today, it's just a total high."
The biggest crowd-pleaser of
the day was triple jumper
Willie Banks, the American
record holder in the event and
world leader last year. Before
his approach, Banks would in
cite the fans to cheer him on,
getting the crowd to clap and
shout as he concentrated. After
the lanky Banks fouled in his
first attempts he was met with
less applause and more jeers,
to which he responded with a
wind-aided 56-foot, 3 3 /4-inch
leap. The effort lifted him from
fourth place to first, where he
remained.
Other top winners in the
meet included Carol Lewis (sis
ter of Carl) in the women's long
jump (21-5V2), Henry Rono in
the 5000-meters (13:40.9), Cliff
Wiley in the 400-meters in a
diving finish (45.90), Steve Scott
in the mile (4:01.3), Henry
Marsh in the steeplechase
(8:35.0), and veteran Brian Old
field in the shot put (66'6").
Rono, Wiley, and Marsh suc
cessfully defended their top

world rankings with their vic
tories.
The upset of the day came as
world indoor champ Billy
Olson failed to finish among
the top six in the pole vault,
which was won by Earl Bell at
18' Vi".
Scott, the top American
miler and member of the Sub 4
Track Club, was nonchalant
about not living up to his
group's title. "It was just a feel
ing out, I wasn't interested in
running fast. Since it was the
first meet of the season I was
just getting the cobwebs
out...the main thing was I felt
good, I was running well," said
Scott.
Representatives from Stan
ford's track team at the meet
were freshman hammer
thrower Shaun Pickering, who
finished seventh with a 60.08
(meters) toss, and nationally
ranked long jumper Pam
Donald. The 1981 AIAW All-
America finished sixth with a
leap of 18'8V2" and noted, "It
was a good meet, it just didn't
go for me. I didn't have any
thing going off the board, I was
flat."
