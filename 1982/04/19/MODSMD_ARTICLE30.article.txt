Under the influence of sun, beer and
compassion for the aged, the Daily softball
nine allowed the professional journalism
fellows (PJFs) the scant glory of an 18-17
win in Saturday's clash on Roble Field.
The PJFs came from behind to win by
threatening to blackball any victorious
Daily staffer from employment in any of
the nation's leading papers and by at
tempting to assassinate the Daily's fearless
leader, Editer Joan O'Connell of Joanieball
fame, with a malicious drive to the mound.
The Daily pulled ahead early through

flawless fielding, the power hitting of Yan
kee draftees Steve Trousdale and Jeff and
Cathy Golden, and a rallying cry of "chant,
chant, chant."
Only after an appeal to the gods end the
exchange of six-packs were the PJFs able to
send the ball over the sunbathing Daily
outfielders.
One particularly obnoxious PJFer — im
mediately identified as an editorial writer
by the young ivjt journalistically javvy Dai
ly players — was overheard praying to a
god he called Noah. "More arc," he called,

forsaking his religious heritage for tem
poral rewards, after fanning half a dozen
pitches.
Drawing a parallel between this match
up and big-league ball proved too difficult
for bubble-blowing cheerleader Mark
Wilson. Wilson, disgusted, said he would
"stick to Gradepoint."
"Does the giveaway really matter, as
long as the PJFs provide the beer?" said
one Daily staffer after wasting away behind
the plate.
