# Card takes two from Bruins
## 
### 
victory. Reliever Jeff Ballard added his sixth
victory, against three losses, with his victory
yesterday.
In the first game on Saturday, the Cardinal
ripped UCLA pitcher Colin Ward for nine
hits, but stranded 10 men on base, losing the
game 4-3.
The second game of the twin bill not only
featured more Stanford runs, but also some
heated tempers.
In the bottom of the sixth inning, with the
Cardinal leading 6-2, Stanford second
baseman Steve Buechelle was thrown out at
home plate, but in the process knocked over
Bruin catcher DeLaTorre. UCLA pitcher Jeff
McDonald hit Buechelle in his next plate ap
pearance in the eighth inning. As Buechelle
walked to first he pointed at McDonald and
was obviously upset. However, he took his
frustration out on the basepath — stealing
second and third, and then scoring on a
ground ball by first baseman Mike Aldrete —
to the obvious delight of the many fans
watching.
Stanford scored three runs in the third in
ning — without a hit — as McDonald had a
temporary spell of wildness.
Third baseman Loring Davies hit a three
run homer in the fifth inning, Stanford scored
once more in the sixth and twice in the
eighth.
Although yesterday's game ended with a
bang, it started with a blank, as starter Doug

Gwaltney did not last for even three batters.
After walking the first two and with a 2-0
count on the third, sophomore Steve Cottrell
came in and pitched six innings of relief,
before Ballard came in to finish.
Dotterer opened off the bottom of the first
inning with a solo homer. The Bruins came
back, however, and scored four runs in the
top of the second, including a two run homer
by DeLaTorre. UCLA scored once more, on a
fifth inning home run by first baseman Mike
Young, and held a 5-3 lead going into the bot
tom of the seventh.
Every Stanford player, except Davies,
scored at least once in the seventh inning, as
the Cardinal ripped Bruin reliever Jeff Price
for 10 runs. Dotterer capped off the inning
with a line drive grand slam over the left field
fence. The inning featured seven walks and
four hits. Right fielder Mike Toothman, and
designated hitter Eric Hardgrave each had
two KBl's, center fielder Darryl Stephens
scored twice and had one RBI, while Mike
Dotterer scored twice and had four RBIs.
To add insult to injury, the Cardinal scored
three more times in the eigth inning. Aldrete
drove in one run, while Stephens — batting
for his third time in two innings — drove in
two more to give Stanford an insurmountable
lead.
Today at 2:30 p.m. the Cardinal starts what
could be its most important series of the year
as it plays the Arizona State University Sun
Devils here at Sunken Diamond.
