The defeated Carrillo-Cooper-Lighty-Wilson (CCLW)
Council of Presidents (COP) slate has formally contested
the ASSU General Election held on April 14and 15on the
grounds of procedural irregularities and has called for a
new election.
In a memo sent to ASSO Senate Chair Dave Phelps last
Friday, the CCLW slate members objected to the ballots
that did not prohibit undergraduates from voting for
graduate senators and vice versa; to the lack of an ade
quate method for identifying voters as actual Stanford
students; to changes in scheduled poll times; to the use
of scraps of paper as ballots at the Meyer Library polling
place; and to the absence of polling places in the Medi
cal and Law Schools and Escondido Village.
However, Elections Commissioner Eric Laurence said
last night that the Elections Commission does consider
the election results valid and will submit them tomorrow
night to the senate for senate verification The senate
could ratify the results, or it could refuse to validate all or
part of the election and call fora new election to be held.
Laurence said that some of the CCLW's charges were
valid, but that they did not influence the outcome of the
election.
"I don't think they're valid enough to call another
election," he said.
Laurence said the Elections Commission is drawing up
a letter responding to the CCLW's charges to be present
ed to the senate along with the election results.
The Elections Commission's position is further com
plicated by the fact that Laurence is leaving for Asia
tomorrow. Assistant Elections Commissioners B.J. Beal
and Patrick O'Reilly will present the election results to
the senate.
ASSU officials had been criticized earlier because of
their failure to advertise the fee assessment election in
time, thus forcing the assessments to be voted on April 28
and 29 rather than in last Wednesday and Thursday's
election as planned. If held, the new election called for
by the CCLW would probably be conducted during the

April 28 and 29 fee assesesment elections.
CCLW slate member Robin Cooper said that
Laurence's service as Elections Commissioner had a "tre
mendous amount" to do with the election irregularities.
However, members of the victorious Beckstrom-Eps
tein-Townsend-Mathewson (BET'M) slate said the prob
lems cited by the CCLW slate were common for an ASSU
election.
"There's always some problems with every election,"
said slate member Mark Epstein.
Epstein said the irregularities listed by the CCLW slate
had not affected the outcome of the election and said he
doubted the senate would actually nullify the election
returns.
"They (the CCLW slate) will have to document these
problems a lot better than they have in order to have the
election voided," he said.
CCLW slate member Doris Wilson admitted that ASSU
elections are often run sloppily, but she said last week's
election was "the worst one I've ever seen."
Both Epstein and fellow slate member Rod Beckstrom
are current members of the senate. Epstein said he and
Beckstrom would retain their speaking privileges on the
ratification of the election returns but would not voteon
the issue.
Wilson said she hoped that Beckstrom and Epstein's
presence in the senate would not influence the senate's
actions.
"Hopefully, the senate will be fair" she said.
Beckstrom said all complaints about the election
should be investigated, but he said he felt the ir
regularities cited by CCLW did not affect the election
outcome.
Beckstrom also said that some of the problems listed
by the CCLW, such as the lack of adequate polling places
for graduates, should have been discussed before the
election.
"What's the point in bringing it up after the fact?" he
said.
