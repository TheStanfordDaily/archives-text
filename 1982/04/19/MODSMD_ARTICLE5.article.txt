## Wirth predicts British victory in conflict over Falklands 
### Mike Thurman Senior staff writer 
While Argentina's occupation of
the Falkland Islands gave it a strong
foothold for eventually gaining sov
ereignty there through diplomatic
channels, History Prof. John Wirth
said yesterday that the South Ameri
can country "snatched defeat from
the jaws of victory" by failing to
withdraw its forces immediately.
Speaking as a panel member in the
Alumni Association's "Great
Powers" Seminar, Wirth, director of
the Latin American Studies Center
here, said that it is likely that the is
lands eventually would have been
given up by the British had Argentina
not turned it into "a matter of hon
or."
Wirth said he expects that the
strength of the British naval fleet
presently en route will overpower
the Argentinean force that holds the
islands.
"I would not be terribly happy if I
were an Argentinean soldier on the
islands right now," Wirth said.
The panel, composed of five facul
ty members, discussed a number of

U.S. foreign policy-related issues
pertaining to each of their fields of
academic expertise.
According to Politica Science Prof.
David Abernethy, who served as
panel chair, the panel was unable to
translate the Reagan administration's
global stance of words and postures
against the Soviet Union and the
spread of -communism into a
coherent foreign policy.
Citing DeTocqueville, Political Sci
ence Prof. Alexander George dis
cussed the inherent difficulties
which face every presidential admin
istration in developing and gaining
the national consensus needed to
implement "a long-range, coherent
foreign policy."
He said that so far the Reagan ad
ministration has failed, as did the
Carter administration before, "to de
velop a successful, coherent foreign
policy-making system."
George argued that the Reagan ad
ministration's current "cold war"
stance is in fact a continuation of a
"neo-cold war" posture established
during the last year of the Carter ad
ministration.

John Lewis, William Haas professor
of Chinese politics, discussed the
need to balance the basic objectives
of American foreign policy. He said
that "hard-liners" on U.S. defense
have argued basic military strategy
"from a one-and-a-half- or two-war
strategy to a many-war strategy,"
which would require U.S. forces to
be equipped to fight many wars in
many places around the world at the
same time.


Prof. Stephen Krasner
He said that recent diplomatic im
provements with mainland China af
forded the administration "a tremen
dousopportunity"toestablish an im
proved relationship between the
Peoples Republic of China and the
Taiwanese government. Instead, he
said, "the administration has seen
China as a card to be played against
the Soviet Union," making arms
gestures that threaten both the Sovi

ets and the Taiwanese.
Discussing the administration's
policies in the Mid-East, Judith Gold
stein, an assistant professor of politi
cal science, said that progress will be
made when the United States moves
to recognize the Palestinean Liber
ation Organization (PLO).
"I think that talks (between the
United States and the PLO) have
been going on secretly for years, but
it hasn't been released to protect pol
icymakers. But the future has to in
clude some form of recognition of
the PLO."
