### Mike Thurman Senior staff writer 
Political Science Prof. Stephen
Krasner said yesterday that the U.S
should c' raider limit*.-*# acov* '
American universities by foreign stu
dents as a means of reducing the flow
of technological data from this coun
try.
Addressing alternative means of
increasing U.S. industrial capabilities,
Krasner said there is a "real cost" to
teaching "state-of-the-art" technol
ogies to foreign engineering stu
dents who then return to their own
countries.
Krasner described the historical
and recent events which have forced
Americans to change their per
ceptions of themselves and the world
they live in.
According to Krasner, following
World War II the United States held
an unparalleled amount of power
and world influence. Directing the
reconstruction of the war-torn
powers of the world, American lead
ers implemented the structure sand
moral values that led to this country's
unquestioned world superiority.

Krasner said that the American phi
losophy hastraditionally rejected "al
ien philosophies, especially alien
philosophies to the left," in part be
e 3*. iijvtorkalty, unlike nearly aU*
European countries, Americans have
only experienced a "liberalistic" po
litical system.
Krasner suggested that socialism,
communism and other left-wing
doctrines pose greater challenges to
American dogma than do fascist re
gimes and other right-wing systems,
"possibly because (they) provide the
challenge of the future."
Since 1973, world events have re
moved the control to which Ameri
cans had grown accustomed, he said.
"We have," he said, "for the first
time in American history, the situ
ation that we cannot defend our
population from attack and we have
to depend on the rest of the world
economically. We are in this sense,
for the first time in world history, a
normal world power.
"We are still over-extended," he
said. "We are still committed to a set
of foreign policies that we cannot de
fend."
