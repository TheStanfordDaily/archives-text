# Wilson holds 2nd place in voter polls

### Peggy Hernandez 
San Jose â€” Pete Wilson, the third
term mayor of San Diego, continues
to gain momentum in his bid for the
Republican nomination for the U.S.
Senate, according to recent voter
polls.
A statewide poll released a week
ago by a Los Angeles television sta
tion, KABC, placed the 48-year-old
Wilson in second place behind Rep.
Barry Goldwater Jr. (R-Woodland
Hills) in the crowded Republican
Senate field for the June 8 primary.
Wilson also ranked second in a
March 31 Field Poll after early polls
indicated he shared second place
with fellow candidate Rep. Paul
"Pete" McCloskey (R-Menlo Park).
McCloskey ranked third in the latest

Field Poll.
Wilson was unperturbed by Gold
water's edge in the polls. During an
appearance Sunday at a leadership
brunch for the Jewish Federation of
Greater San Jose, Wilson said he at
tributed Goldwater's lead "solely to
his father's name."
Wilson said the voting public
knows little about Goldwater, but
supports him because they like his
father, Sen. Barry Goldwater (R-Ari
zona). He said the tide of popularity
is turning away from Goldwater and
based his remark on the California
Republican Assembly's recent en
dorsement of Rep. Robert Dornan
(R-Santa Monica), fourth in the most
recent polls. The CRA has a member
ship of 14,000 conservative voters.

The San Jose appearance was
Wilson's opportunity to reiterate his
support of the state's Jewish com
munity and of Israel. He chastised the
United Nations for its statement that
Zionism was akin to racism and for its
failure to pressure the Soviet Union
into increasing the number of Jewish
citizens allowed to emigrate to Israel.
"The United Nations has lost the
right to our respect when Zionism
was equated with racism," Wilson
said to the 60-member audience.
With its decision Wilson said the
United Nations "became a forum for
doggery," a childish group which in
dulged in "character assassination."
Wilson said he believes the United
States should withdraw from the
United Nations if the U.N. General
Assembly ever votes for Israel's ex
pulsion because Israel takes a pre
emptive strike against a threatening
enemy. Wilson hinted that because
Lebanon has received $50 million
worth of Soviet arms (according to a
Feb. 5 news article published in
Kuwait), Lebanon maybesuchanen
emy.
"I think we (the United States)
could expect a pre-emptive strike

and I would do the same if I was in the
same situation," Wilson said.
Wilson also praised Israel for the
"real sacrifice" it will make by evac
uating the Sinai on April 25 in ac
cordance with the Camp David
peace treaty. He said the world did
not appreciate the financial loss Is
rael will incur. He estimated that Is
rael had $17 billion worth of invest
ments in the Sinai in oil, production
equipment and land development.
During the 30-minute speech,
Wilson also told the audience he be
lieves the key to world peace is
through increased defense expen
ditures. "Our urgent priority is to re
build our defense," Wilson said.
"You cannot urge a bilateral (arms)
freeze when you're not in a parrying
position. The Soviet Union has a rec
ord of broken violations as seen in
the invasion of Afghanistan."
In other areas, Wilson supports the
development of nuclear energy;
would like to see President Ronald
Reagan's budget deficit cut in half by
eliminating the departments of
energy and education and reducing
entitlement programs.
