# Ford pres. calls UAW contract revolutionary

The labor contract recently negotiated between
Ford Motor Company and the United Auto Work
ers (UAW) reflects a "sweeping revolution" taking
place in the American auto industry, according to
Ford President Donald Peterson. Peterson, a grad
uate of the Business School here, spoke before
more than 300 people in Bishop Auditorium last
Thursday.
Peterson called the Ford/UAW contract
"progressive and forward-looking," saying, "Em
ployee involvement is no longer a slogan at Ford,
it's a reality."
Ford's new approach goes beyond the financial
bottom line, Peterson said. "Every employee in our
company has a stake in its future."
Peterson reiterated Ford's commitment to a
people-oriented approach or "second bottom
line" throughout both his 20-minute address and
the 25-minute question period. In additio.i to en
couraging employee participation in oroblem

solving groups (to which 9000 Ford employees al
ready belong), he is personally visiting plants and
speaking to workers. "Employee involvement is
based on trust and contribution," he said.
Peterson delved into the company's history,
saying the people orientation reflects former
Chairman of the Board Henry Ford's desire to de
velop a more modern approach toward la
bor/management relations.
He compared the Ford/UAW contract to Ford's
landmark decision in 1914 to cut the workday to
eight hours and fix a $5-a-day minimum wage.
"Fordism" has always been defined as "passing
profits along to employees," he said.
According to Peterson, the new direction will
need people-oriented managers to lead and
motivate rather than employ outdated "strong
arm" and "control and dominate" management
tactics, he said. "We're facing the future with a
new partnership between labor and man
agement."

But implementing the new style will also require
a lot of "missionary work," he said. He admitted
that Ford did not focus on that new bottom line
earlier because they did so well until recently.
The auto industry has been suffering from huge
decreases in employment, problems with product
conversion and what Peterson called "Japan's
massive competitive cost advantage." He cited the
$10-an-hour difference in labor cost between the
United States and Japan as an example of the latter.
The new Ford/UAW contract, which ensures
two-and-a-half years of labor peace, should give
Ford sufficient time to introduce new products on
the market and continue other problem-solving
efforts, according to Peterson.
"The agreement is a major first step toward mak
ing Ford more cost competitive, but we still have
much of our transition toward smaller, more effec
tive automobiles ahead of us."
