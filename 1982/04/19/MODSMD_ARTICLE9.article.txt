CO-OPERATION â€” The Daily is proud to
announce a new cartoonist, T. Jackson Zajac,
whose cartoon strip "Co-Operation" will run
four times a week in the Classified section of
the newspaper. He has lived in dorm rooms,
scorpion-infested shacks in Mexico and
alone in an A-frame in the middle of no
where. Now he's sold on the merits of coop
erative living and hopes you will be, too. See
CO-OPERATION, page 6.
