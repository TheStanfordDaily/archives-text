# Election controversy continues
## COP member Buhl may quit 
### Douglas Jehl 
Council of Presidents (COP) mem
ber Fred Buhl told the Daily late last
night that he may resign if the ASSU
Senate votes tonight to validate last
week's election results.
Buhl, who says he was the COP
member most integrally involved in
the election, plans to read a docu
ment to the senate that criticizes
many of the same aspects of the elec
tion that the defeated Carillo-Coop
er-Lighty-Wilson (CCLW) COP slate
brought up in an April 16 letter that
officially contested the election.
Buhl said he has written a letter of
resignation and may resign tomor
row at noon if the election results are
validated.
At tonight's senate meeting, the
senate is scheduled to vote to accept
or reject Election Commissioner Eric
Laurence's report of the election re
sults. At a meeting early yesterday
morning, Laurence, Senate Chair
Dave Phelps and Deputy Chair Roc
Blumenthal decided to submit the
election results to the senate, despite
the CCLW contestation of the elec
tion.
Buhl said he made his decision af
ter an 8:30 a.m. meeting yesterday at

which the COP voted to support the
election commissioner's report. Buhl
had asked that the COP veto any sen
ate decision to validate the election.
"I don't want to make waves, but as
the principal COP member involved
in the election, I don't think that
these problems should be taken
lightly," Buhl said.
COP chair Mariann Byerwalter will
submit a COP report to the senate
encouraging it to validate the elec
tion results. Her report will come
during time allotted to the COP in to
night's meeting. Buhl, because he is
speaking as an individual and not on
behalf of the COP, will present his
views separately during the open fo
rum scheduled at the beginning of
the meeting.
In a draft of the statement he said
he will read tonight, Buhl suggests
that the election commissioner pres
ent for certification only the results
of the referendum on fee assessment
reform and the constitutional
amendments, both of which passed
by large margins. He suggests that the
senate authorize new elections for
the senior class presidents, COP, sen
ate and program fee fee assessment,
and suggests that these elections

should occur with those already
scheduled for April 28 and 29.
"If we fail to shoulder the future
implications of our certifying an elec
tion strewn with mishandlingand de
viation from our own standards, we
will have a very difficult time con
vincing anyone in the future to trust
our integrity or professionalism,"
Buhl stated in the draft.
Buhl said last night that he felt mor
ally obligated to dissent from the rest
of the COP. "What I've seen of the
elections disturbed me," he said.
Among the criticisms of the elec
tion Buhl raised in a conversation
with the Daily or included in the draft
are:
•Polling hours: Buhl claimed that
the Lagunita Court polls never
opened Thursday between 4 and 6
p.m. and that the Meyer Library polls
remained open until midnight
Wednesday, one hour after they had
been scheduled to close;
•Voting: non-juniors voted for
senior class president and there was
no mechanism provided to prevent
students from voting for more than
10 senators, according to Buhl;
•Ballot security: no provisions
were made for ballot security in a
centralized desk and blank ballots
were stored in an ASSU office desk,
he claimed;
•Ballot error: some ballot sheets
were presented to voters with
"checks" beside some candidates'
names, he said;
•Candidates handling ballots: one
candidate, senate candidate Melissa
Auchard (who finished second
among undergraduate senate can
didates), carried a box of ballots
across campus, according to Buhl;
•Machine error: because voters
were not instructed to press very
hard with their pencils on the ballot,
some votes may not have been

picked up by the SCAN-TRON ma
chine, he claimed;
•Invalid ballots: scraps of paper
were used as ballots, he said;
•Illegal election commissioner:
Buhl questioned whether Laurence
could legally hold office because he
was not registered as a student dur
ing the elections.
Auchard told the Daily that she had
been asked to check the polling
places by Laurence, and that she de
livered a box of ballots from the Old
Engineering Corner to the ASSU of
fice at the request of a poll-watcher
who told Auchard that she had to
leave and requsted that Auchard take
the ballots back.
COP Chair Mariann Byerwalter
said last night, "If the magnitude of
the problem were greater, we might
ask for another election.

"There's so much good work that's
been done — I'm afraid it (the con
troversy over the election's validity)
is going to overshadow it,"
Byerwalter said.
COP member Dragan Popov said
the questions Buhl raises are not seri
ous enough to run another election.
Popov also said that Buhl has threat
ened to resign a number of times in
the past.
Senate Chair Dave Phelps declined
to comment early this morning on
whether the charges Buhl raises are
serious enough to warrant a new
election. He said that he preferred to
wait until tonight to bring that up.
Phelps also reported that David
Porter, who was elected an alternate
senator, requested a re-count of the
ballots yesterday, and that Laurence
had denied the request.

which the COP voted to support the
election commissioner's report. Buhl
had asked that the COP veto any sen
ate decision to validate the election.
"I don't want to make waves, but as
the principal COP member involved
in the election, I don't think that
these problems should be taken
lightly," Buhl said.
COP chair Mariann Byerwalter will
submit a COP report to the senate
encouraging it to validate the elec
tion results. Her report will come
during time allotted to the COP in to
night's meeting. Buhl, because he is
speaking as an individual and not on
behalf of the COP, will present his
views separately during the open fo
rum scheduled at the beginning of
the meeting.
In a draft of the statement he said
he will read tonight, Buhl suggests
that the election commissioner pres
ent for certification only the results
of the referendum on fee assessment
reform and the constitutional
amendments, both of which passed
by large margins. He suggests that the
senate authorize new elections for
the senior class presidents, COP, sen
ate and program fee fee assessment,
and suggests that these elections

should occur with those already
scheduled for April 28 and 29.
"If we fail to shoulder the future
implications of our certifying an elec
tion strewn with mishandlingand de
viation from our own standards, we
will have a very difficult time con
vincing anyone in the future to trust
our integrity or professionalism,"
Buhl stated in the draft.
Buhl said last night that he felt mor
ally obligated to dissent from the rest
of the COP. "What I've seen of the
elections disturbed me," he said.
Among the criticisms of the elec
tion Buhl raised in a conversation
with the Daily or included in the draft
are:
•Polling hours: Buhl claimed that
the Lagunita Court polls never
opened Thursday between 4 and 6
p.m. and that the Meyer Library polls
remained open until midnight
Wednesday, one hour after they had
been scheduled to close;
•Voting: non-juniors voted for
senior class president and there was
no mechanism provided to prevent
students from voting for more than
10 senators, according to Buhl;
•Ballot security: no provisions
were made for ballot security in a
centralized desk and blank ballots
were stored in an ASSU office desk,
he claimed;
•Ballot error: some ballot sheets
were presented to voters with
"checks" beside some candidates'
names, he said;
•Candidates handling ballots: one
candidate, senate candidate Melissa
Auchard (who finished second
among undergraduate senate can
didates), carried a box of ballots
across campus, according to Buhl;
•Machine error: because voters
were not instructed to press very
hard with their pencils on the ballot,
some votes may not have been

picked up by the SCAN-TRON ma
chine, he claimed;
•Invalid ballots: scraps of paper
were used as ballots, he said;
•Illegal election commissioner:
Buhl questioned whether Laurence
could legally hold office because he
was not registered as a student dur
ing the elections.
Auchard told the Daily that she had
been asked to check the polling
places by Laurence, and that she de
livered a box of ballots from the Old
Engineering Corner to the ASSU of
fice at the request of a poll-watcher
who told Auchard that she had to
leave and requsted that Auchard take
the ballots back.
COP Chair Mariann Byerwalter
said last night, "If the magnitude of
the problem were greater, we might
ask for another election.

"There's so much good work that's
been done — I'm afraid it (the con
troversy over the election's validity)
is going to overshadow it,"
Byerwalter said.
COP member Dragan Popov said
the questions Buhl raises are not seri
ous enough to run another election.
Popov also said that Buhl has threat
ened to resign a number of times in
the past.
Senate Chair Dave Phelps declined
to comment early this morning on
whether the charges Buhl raises are
serious enough to warrant a new
election. He said that he preferred to
wait until tonight to bring that up.
Phelps also reported that David
Porter, who was elected an alternate
senator, requested a re-count of the
ballots yesterday, and that Laurence
had denied the request.
Council of Presidents (COP) mem
ber Fred Buhl told the Daily late last
night that he may resign if the ASSU
Senate votes tonight to validate last
week's election results.
Buhl, who says he was the COP
member most integrally involved in
the election, plans to read a docu
ment to the senate that criticizes
many of the same aspects of the elec
tion that the defeated Carillo-Coop
er-Lighty-Wilson (CCLW) COP slate
brought up in an April 16 letter that
officially contested the election.
Buhl said he has written a letter of
resignation and may resign tomor
row at noon if the election results are
validated.
At tonight's senate meeting, the
senate is scheduled to vote to accept
or reject Election Commissioner Eric
Laurence's report of the election re
sults. At a meeting early yesterday
morning, Laurence, Senate Chair
Dave Phelps and Deputy Chair Roc
Blumenthal decided to submit the
election results to the senate, despite
the CCLW contestation of the elec
tion.
