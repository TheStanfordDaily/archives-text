# Do you know... why most people of the world get sick from milk?
## 
### 
While the advertisement
proclaiming "Everybody needs
milk" was controversial in this
country, it would have been
considered outrageous in
japan, Isreal, Uganda and nu
merous other countries out
side the United States and
Western Europe. Most people
in the world cannot drink milk
— they get severe diarrhea if
they do.
This majority has been re
ferred to by scientists as "lac
tose intolerant" or "lactose
malabsorbing". Lactose is the
carbohydrate, or sugar, in milk.

When one drinks milk, the
lactose travels to the small in
testine. If the enzyme lactase is
present, lactose is broken
down into two smaller pieces,
glucose and galactose, which
are then metabolized by the
liver.
Lactase is present in suffi
cient quantities in almost all
mammals and humans during
infancy to allow for consump
tion of mother's milk. After in
fancy, however, the quantity of
lactase decreases, and in most
of the wqrld's people, there is
no longer enough to allow for

sufficient breakdown of lac
tose.
Some of the undigested lac
tose passes into the large .in
testine, and draws water into
the intestine. Also, the glucose
contained in the lactose is
fermented by bacteria resting
in the colon, resulting in the
production of organic acids
and carbon dioxide. These re
actions cause "flatulence,
cramps and diarrhea.
The fact that most people in
Third World countries are lac
tose malabsorbers has impor
tant policy implications. In

parts of South America, mjlk
powder sent by the U.S. gov
ernment has been used as a J
white wash for buildings or as a J
laxative because there werdj
not many other uses for it. 1
