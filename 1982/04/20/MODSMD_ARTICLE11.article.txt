## Helping to bridge the gap Students help direct SCIRE, SWOPSI programs 
### Yvonne Campos 
While many students may feel that a bar
rier often exists between the interests of
the University and those of its students,
two students here are doing something to
break down such barriers. For the past
year, seniors Leenda Gonzalez and
Michael Lighty have worked as co-direc
tors of two University academic programs.
Gonzalez has been at the Student Center
for Innovation in Research and Education
(SCIRE) and Lighty has worked for the
Stanford Workshop on Political and Social
Issues (SWOPSI).
Educational opportunities
As student co-director for SCIRE, Leen
da Gonzalez has spent the past year trying
to inform students that they can create
their own educational opportunities and
that there is an organization willing to give
them the resources.
"People complain about their classes
and not being able tostudy what they want
to, yet here they have the chance to create
their own education if they will take out
the time," she said. "Students don't have
to be limited to theoretical classwork —
they can do something more practical."
SCIRE, a student-initiated program, pro
motes student innovation through estab
lished structures. The program offers in
ternships for academic credit. It also pro
vides opportunities for students to study a
subject not offered through regular cur
riculum by designing their individual
course syllabus. The program also sets up
task forces to investigate some aspect of

student life that might need improvement,
such as the Advising Associate program.
As co-director, Gonzalez helps ap
propriate SCIRE funds for sponsoring stu
dent projects that reach a large portion of
the Stanford community and will have
long-term effects, such as "Working
Against Rape Week." Because the pro
gram publishes a catalog of available in
ternships, Gonzalez spends a lot of time
helping students find projects that will en
rich their Stanford education. In adminis
tering the program, she helps students de
fine internship and project proposals so
students will receive course credit. Her
position requires a lot of publicity work to
inform students on campus that SCIRE
projects exist. The directorship is a 20-hour
a week salaried position which begins in
September and ends in June.
Gonzalez considers the student direc
tor's position to be a valuable opportunity
to meet a lot of interesting, creative people
within the University who really want to
see undergraduate education improved.
She also said she sees it as a chance to learn
about administrative bureaucracy.
Through SCIRE she has also learned much
about organizing public events, she said.
Gonzalez became involved with SCIRE af

ter working for the office as a work-study
student her sophomore year. Her ex
perience within the office qualified her for
the co-director position. Gonzalez is a sen
ior English major from Los Angeles.
Gonzalez said she feels that a lot of work
needs to be done to get students to realize
that changes can be undertaken within the
University if students will oVily try.
"This University is supposed to be for
the students, yet students do not have any
idea of how decisions are made that affect
their education."
As an example, she cited the possible
dismantling of the Office of the Dean of
Undergraduate Studies. "This is supposed
to be the undergraduates' advocate, but
people don't even know that the office is
supposed to serve them." Gonzalez sees
programs like SCIRE as an important voice
for student needs.
Gonzalez's future plans include involve
ment in community organizing at the
grass-roots level.
"I feel it is important to work from the
bottom up, and I am interested in working
with people," she said. While at Stanford,
Gonzalez has been involved with Stanford
Christian Fellowship, Peace Studies Task
Force, Committee on Hunger Fast Day,
Aurora, Stanford Against Conscription and
Chicana Collectiva.
Social changes
Senior Michael Lighty is concerned with
social change. And he thinks other stu
dents should be, too.
As student co-director for Stanford
Workshops on Political and Social Issues
(SWOPSI), Lighty has helped plan and de
velop courses ranging from "World Hun
ger and U.S. Aid" to "Working Efficiently
With Disturbed Children."
SWOPSI is a student-initiated program
whose main purpose is the introduction of
innovation into the curriculum through
practical experience dealing with contem
porary political and social problems.
Lighty defines SWOPSI as one of the few
places a student can directly influence the
quality and nature of undergraduate
education.
The office of student co-director is a 20-
hour per week salaried position which be
gins in September and ends in June. Aside
from general administrative tasks, the stu
dent co-director's job entails generating
new courses based on contemporary is
sues, and then finding community, faculty
or student volunteers to teach the classes.
The co-director then helps the instruc
tor develop an outline and plan for the
class before presenting the course for the
policy board's approval. The co-director
also coordinates and organizes public
events and helps student groups receive
funding for symposiums. Lighty has been
involved with organizing events such as
Disorientation Week and Rape Awareness
Week.
The student co-director's position isone
of a few direct links between students and
administrators, Lighty said. The position
provides access for student input to help
shape the undergraduate learning ex
perience.
SWOPSI was initiated in 1969 during a
time when there was a University emphasis
to provide undergraduates with op
portunities to design their own major. Un
til 1975 there was no student director.
Lighty described his present job as a "very
unique position that you don't find in oth
er programs at other universities."
Lighty is deeply involved with promot
ing student participation not only through
innovative undergraduate curriculum, but
also in learning to affect social change.
SWOPSI emphasizes collaborative learn
ing so that instructors and students seek to
reach common solutions to urgent social

and political problems. Through his affilia
tion with SWOPSI, Lighty said he feels he
has been able to contribute to student in
novation in undergraduate education.
"The co-directorship is exciting because
it combines so many of my interests," he
said.
A co-terminal student in Modern
Thought and Literature, Lighty first be
came interested in SWOPSI during his
sophomore year.
"I took a SWOPSI course entitled 'Poli
tics of Energy' and thought it was one of
the most challenging and rigorous courses
I had taken so far."
The following year he taught a course on
"Democratic Socialism" after learning
how to plan the class. Lighty's political ac
tion experience stems from organizing
public events through groups such as the
Democratic Socialist Organizing Commit
tee, Stanford Progressive Alliance, and
Stanford- Against Conscription.
Through his co-director position, Lighty
has been able to further his main interest
and commitment to programs and action
for social change. According to Lighty,
SWOPSI's strength is that it can respond to
student interest because courses are
planned each quarter. They also provide
students an opportunity to broaden their
educational experience by combining aca
demics with experience on action pro
grams, he said. Lighty describes his posi
tion as a "wonderful learning experience"
which has enriched his personal develop
ment, and as "one of the most significant
things" he has done at Stanford.
"It has been an incredible opportunity
to become familiar with University bu
reauratic processes and with different
people not only in the University but in the
community," he explained.

Lighty said he feels that the bringing to
gether of people to solve common prob
lems within the classroom and community
has been the most exciting result of his
position. Through SWOPSI, Lighty has
been able to make a contribution to un
dergraduate education while still a stu
dent. He would like to see more students
involved with their own education, as well
as more student government participation
in academic affairs. Lighty is also active in
undergraduate education as a tutor for the
Structured Liberal Education (SLE) pro
gram.
Lighty said he believes the University is
currently moving toward constraining un
dergraduate education by instituting
stricter requirements. He sees more ad
ministrative control over innovation and
more attempts to narrow down the cur
riculum and believes this poses a danger to
student input in general.
"I like to challenge myself and other
people — that's why I got involved with
SWOPSI. I'd like to challenge the Univer
sity to respond to student interests."

While many students may feel that a bar
rier often exists between the interests of
the University and those of its students,
two students here are doing something to
break down such barriers. For the past
year, seniors Leenda Gonzalez and
Michael Lighty have worked as co-direc
tors of two University academic programs.
Gonzalez has been at the Student Center
for Innovation in Research and Education
(SCIRE) and Lighty has worked for the
Stanford Workshop on Political and Social
Issues (SWOPSI).
Educational opportunities
As student co-director for SCIRE, Leen
da Gonzalez has spent the past year trying
to inform students that they can create
their own educational opportunities and
that there is an organization willing to give
them the resources.
"People complain about their classes
and not being able tostudy what they want
to, yet here they have the chance to create
their own education if they will take out
the time," she said. "Students don't have
to be limited to theoretical classwork —
they can do something more practical."
SCIRE, a student-initiated program, pro
motes student innovation through estab
lished structures. The program offers in
ternships for academic credit. It also pro
vides opportunities for students to study a
subject not offered through regular cur
riculum by designing their individual
course syllabus. The program also sets up
task forces to investigate some aspect of

student life that might need improvement,
such as the Advising Associate program.
As co-director, Gonzalez helps ap
propriate SCIRE funds for sponsoring stu
dent projects that reach a large portion of
the Stanford community and will have
long-term effects, such as "Working
Against Rape Week." Because the pro
gram publishes a catalog of available in
ternships, Gonzalez spends a lot of time
helping students find projects that will en
rich their Stanford education. In adminis
tering the program, she helps students de
fine internship and project proposals so
students will receive course credit. Her
position requires a lot of publicity work to
inform students on campus that SCIRE
projects exist. The directorship is a 20-hour
a week salaried position which begins in
September and ends in June.
Gonzalez considers the student direc
tor's position to be a valuable opportunity
to meet a lot of interesting, creative people
within the University who really want to
see undergraduate education improved.
She also said she sees it as a chance to learn
about administrative bureaucracy.
Through SCIRE she has also learned much
about organizing public events, she said.
Gonzalez became involved with SCIRE af

ter working for the office as a work-study
student her sophomore year. Her ex
perience within the office qualified her for
the co-director position. Gonzalez is a sen
ior English major from Los Angeles.
Gonzalez said she feels that a lot of work
needs to be done to get students to realize
that changes can be undertaken within the
University if students will oVily try.
"This University is supposed to be for
the students, yet students do not have any
idea of how decisions are made that affect
their education."
As an example, she cited the possible
dismantling of the Office of the Dean of
Undergraduate Studies. "This is supposed
to be the undergraduates' advocate, but
people don't even know that the office is
supposed to serve them." Gonzalez sees
programs like SCIRE as an important voice
for student needs.
Gonzalez's future plans include involve
ment in community organizing at the
grass-roots level.
"I feel it is important to work from the
bottom up, and I am interested in working
with people," she said. While at Stanford,
Gonzalez has been involved with Stanford
Christian Fellowship, Peace Studies Task
Force, Committee on Hunger Fast Day,
Aurora, Stanford Against Conscription and
Chicana Collectiva.
Social changes
Senior Michael Lighty is concerned with
social change. And he thinks other stu

As student co-director for Stanford
Workshops on Political and Social Issues
(SWOPSI), Lighty has helped plan and de
velop courses ranging from "World Hun
ger and U.S. Aid" to "Working Efficiently
With Disturbed Children."
SWOPSI is a student-initiated program
whose main purpose is the introduction of
innovation into the curriculum through
practical experience dealing with contem
porary political and social problems.
Lighty defines SWOPSI as one of the few
places a student can directly influence the
quality and nature of undergraduate
education.
The office of student co-director is a 20-
hour per week salaried position which be
gins in September and ends in June. Aside
from general administrative tasks, the stu
dent co-director's job entails generating
new courses based on contemporary is
sues, and then finding community, faculty
or student volunteers to teach the classes.
The co-director then helps the instruc
tor develop an outline and plan for the
class before presenting the course for the
policy board's approval. The co-director
also coordinates and organizes public
events and helps student groups receive
funding for symposiums. Lighty has been
involved with organizing events such as
Disorientation Week and Rape Awareness
Week.
The student co-director's position isone
of a few direct links between students and
administrators, Lighty said. The position
provides access for student input to help
shape the undergraduate learning ex
perience.
SWOPSI was initiated in 1969 during a
time when there was a University emphasis
to provide undergraduates with op
portunities to design their own major. Un
til 1975 there was no student director.
Lighty described his present job as a "very
unique position that you don't find in oth
er programs at other universities."
Lighty is deeply involved with promot
ing student participation not only through
innovative undergraduate curriculum, but
also in learning to affect social change.
SWOPSI emphasizes collaborative learn
ing so that instructors and students seek to
reach common solutions to urgent social

and political problems. Through his affilia
tion with SWOPSI, Lighty said he feels he
has been able to contribute to student in
novation in undergraduate education.
"The co-directorship is exciting because
it combines so many of my interests," he
said.
A co-terminal student in Modern
Thought and Literature, Lighty first be
came interested in SWOPSI during his
sophomore year.
"I took a SWOPSI course entitled 'Poli
tics of Energy' and thought it was one of
the most challenging and rigorous courses
I had taken so far."
The following year he taught a course on
"Democratic Socialism" after learning
how to plan the class. Lighty's political ac
tion experience stems from organizing
public events through groups such as the
Democratic Socialist Organizing Commit
tee, Stanford Progressive Alliance, and
Stanford- Against Conscription.
Through his co-director position, Lighty
has been able to further his main interest

events and helps student groups receive
funding for symposiums. Lighty has been
involved with organizing events such as
Disorientation Week and Rape Awareness
Week.
The student co-director's position isone
of a few direct links between students and
administrators, Lighty said. The position
provides access for student input to help
shape the undergraduate learning ex
perience.
SWOPSI was initiated in 1969 during a
time when there was a University emphasis
to provide undergraduates with op
portunities to design their own major. Un
til 1975 there was no student director.
Lighty described his present job as a "very
unique position that you don't find in oth
er programs at other universities."
Lighty is deeply involved with promot
ing student participation not only through
innovative undergraduate curriculum, but
also in learning to affect social change.
SWOPSI emphasizes collaborative learn
ing so that instructors and students seek to
reach common solutions to urgent social

and political problems. Through his affilia
tion with SWOPSI, Lighty said he feels he
has been able to contribute to student in
novation in undergraduate education.
"The co-directorship is exciting because
it combines so many of my interests," he
said.
A co-terminal student in Modern
Thought and Literature, Lighty first be
came interested in SWOPSI during his
sophomore year.
"I took a SWOPSI course entitled 'Poli
tics of Energy' and thought it was one of
the most challenging and rigorous courses
I had taken so far."
The following year he taught a course on
"Democratic Socialism" after learning
how to plan the class. Lighty's political ac
tion experience stems from organizing
public events through groups such as the
Democratic Socialist Organizing Commit
tee, Stanford Progressive Alliance, and
Stanford- Against Conscription.
Through his co-director position, Lighty
has been able to further his main interest
and commitment to programs and action
for social change. According to Lighty,
SWOPSI's strength is that it can respond to
student interest because courses are
planned each quarter. They also provide
students an opportunity to broaden their
educational experience by combining aca
demics with experience on action pro
grams, he said. Lighty describes his posi
tion as a "wonderful learning experience"
which has enriched his personal develop
ment, and as "one of the most significant
things" he has done at Stanford.
"It has been an incredible opportunity
to become familiar with University bu
reauratic processes and with different
people not only in the University but in the
community," he explained.

Lighty said he feels that the bringing to
gether of people to solve common prob
lems within the classroom and community
has been the most exciting result of his
position. Through SWOPSI, Lighty has
been able to make a contribution to un
dergraduate education while still a stu
dent. He would like to see more students
involved with their own education, as well
as more student government participation
in academic affairs. Lighty is also active in
undergraduate education as a tutor for the
Structured Liberal Education (SLE) pro
gram.
Lighty said he believes the University is
currently moving toward constraining un
dergraduate education by instituting
stricter requirements. He sees more ad
ministrative control over innovation and
more attempts to narrow down the cur
riculum and believes this poses a danger to
student input in general.
"I like to challenge myself and other
people — that's why I got involved with
SWOPSI. I'd like to challenge the Univer
sity to respond to student interests."

While many students may feel that a bar
rier often exists between the interests of
the University and those of its students,
two students here are doing something to
break down such barriers. For the past
year, seniors Leenda Gonzalez and
Michael Lighty have worked as co-direc
tors of two University academic programs.
Gonzalez has been at the Student Center
for Innovation in Research and Education
(SCIRE) and Lighty has worked for the
Stanford Workshop on Political and Social
Issues (SWOPSI).
Educational opportunities
As student co-director for SCIRE, Leen
da Gonzalez has spent the past year trying
to inform students that they can create
their own educational opportunities and
that there is an organization willing to give
them the resources.
"People complain about their classes
and not being able tostudy what they want
to, yet here they have the chance to create
their own education if they will take out
the time," she said. "Students don't have
to be limited to theoretical classwork —
they can do something more practical."
SCIRE, a student-initiated program, pro
motes student innovation through estab
lished structures. The program offers in
ternships for academic credit. It also pro
vides opportunities for students to study a
subject not offered through regular cur
riculum by designing their individual
course syllabus. The program also sets up
task forces to investigate some aspect of

student life that might need improvement,
such as the Advising Associate program.
As co-director, Gonzalez helps ap
propriate SCIRE funds for sponsoring stu
dent projects that reach a large portion of
the Stanford community and will have
long-term effects, such as "Working
Against Rape Week." Because the pro
gram publishes a catalog of available in
ternships, Gonzalez spends a lot of time
helping students find projects that will en
rich their Stanford education. In adminis
tering the program, she helps students de
fine internship and project proposals so
students will receive course credit. Her
position requires a lot of publicity work to
inform students on campus that SCIRE
projects exist. The directorship is a 20-hour
a week salaried position which begins in
September and ends in June.
Gonzalez considers the student direc
tor's position to be a valuable opportunity
to meet a lot of interesting, creative people
within the University who really want to
see undergraduate education improved.
She also said she sees it as a chance to learn
about administrative bureaucracy.
Through SCIRE she has also learned much
about organizing public events, she said.
Gonzalez became involved with SCIRE af

ter working for the office as a work-study
student her sophomore year. Her ex
perience within the office qualified her for
the co-director position. Gonzalez is a sen
ior English major from Los Angeles.
Gonzalez said she feels that a lot of work
needs to be done to get students to realize
that changes can be undertaken within the
University if students will oVily try.
"This University is supposed to be for
the students, yet students do not have any
idea of how decisions are made that affect
their education."
As an example, she cited the possible
dismantling of the Office of the Dean of
Undergraduate Studies. "This is supposed
to be the undergraduates' advocate, but
people don't even know that the office is
supposed to serve them." Gonzalez sees
programs like SCIRE as an important voice
for student needs.
Gonzalez's future plans include involve
ment in community organizing at the
grass-roots level.
"I feel it is important to work from the
bottom up, and I am interested in working
with people," she said. While at Stanford,
Gonzalez has been involved with Stanford
Christian Fellowship, Peace Studies Task
Force, Committee on Hunger Fast Day,
Aurora, Stanford Against Conscription and
Chicana Collectiva.
Social changes
Senior Michael Lighty is concerned with
social change. And he thinks other stu
dents should be, too.
As student co-director for Stanford
Workshops on Political and Social Issues
(SWOPSI), Lighty has helped plan and de
velop courses ranging from "World Hun
ger and U.S. Aid" to "Working Efficiently
With Disturbed Children."
SWOPSI is a student-initiated program
whose main purpose is the introduction of
innovation into the curriculum through
practical experience dealing with contem
porary political and social problems.
Lighty defines SWOPSI as one of the few
places a student can directly influence the
quality and nature of undergraduate
education.
The office of student co-director is a 20-
hour per week salaried position which be
gins in September and ends in June. Aside
from general administrative tasks, the stu
dent co-director's job entails generating
new courses based on contemporary is
sues, and then finding community, faculty
or student volunteers to teach the classes.
The co-director then helps the instruc
tor develop an outline and plan for the
class before presenting the course for the
policy board's approval. The co-director
also coordinates and organizes public
events and helps student groups receive
funding for symposiums. Lighty has been
involved with organizing events such as
Disorientation Week and Rape Awareness
Week.
The student co-director's position isone
of a few direct links between students and
administrators, Lighty said. The position
provides access for student input to help

sity to respond to student interests."
