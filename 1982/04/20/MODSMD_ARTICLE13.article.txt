## Nuclear power containment 
### 
Recently Admiral Hyman
Rickover, "father of the nuclear
navy" and director of the Navy's nu
clear arm for 35 years, testified before
a Joint Committee of Congress. He
appeared just prior to his forced re
tirement (at the hands of the Reagan
administration) and gave eloquent
testimony, some of which may be re
levant to those of us wrestling with
the question of nuclear energy.
Asked by Senator William Proxmire
(D-Wis.) whether he thought that
domestic nuclear reactors would
ever become a viable source of
energy in the future, Rickover's an
swer was in part the following: "I do
believe that nuclear power for com
mercial purposes shows itself to be
more economical (than fossil fuels),
but that's a false line of reasoning be
cause we do not take into account
the potential damage the release of
radiation may do to future gener
ations."
These hidden human costs of nu
clear costs have nowhere been
spelled out more clearly than in the

work of medical physicist Dr. John
Gofman. Gofman helped isolate the
world's first milligram of plutonium
in 1952 and is also known as one of
the world's leading experts on the
biological and medical effects of
ionizing radiation. Gofman's calcu
lations indicate that in a full-scale nu
clear economy, with many hundreds
of nuclear plants in operation, there
would quite literally be no room at all
for error of any kind. Even a contain
ment factor of 99.9 percent (meaning
a loss to the environment of only
one-thousandth of the harmful radi
ation) would cause 198,000 extra fatal
cancers annually in the United States
for each year such plants were al
lowed to operate (Gofman, J.W.,
"Statement in the Matter of 10 CFR 51
... Environmental Effects of the Ura
nium Fuel Cycle," paper submitted
to the Nuclear Regulatory Com
mission, Oct. 3,1977). It is worth not
ing that this figure of nearly an extra
200,000 cancer fatalities annually
does not assume a major nuclear
catastrophe. Instead, it merely as
sumes that we continue to see leak
ing valves and cracked pipes, the
spillovers, drips, burps and
cumulative "incidents" that have
plagued the nuclear industry right
from the very beginning.
Although representatives of the
nuclear industry continue to assure
us that there is no threat to the public

and that all problems are being taken
care of, their reassuring claims are
flatly contradicted by a recent NRC
staff report (February 1982). This re
port, discussed in the San Francisco
Chronicle (March 31,1982), said that
weak steam generator tubes in 40
commercial reactors are "virtually
impossible" to repair.
The technical language of the re
port goes on to say that the trouble is
"due to a combination of steam gen
erator mechanical design, thermal
hydraulics, materials selection, fabri
cation tecniques and secondary sys
tem design and operation." The pos
sibility of multiple tube failures and
complications like the valve that
stuck after a tube rupture Jan. 25th at
the Ginna plant near Rochester, N.Y.,
"have not yet been seriously stud
ied." Nevertheless, the report raises
the disturbing possibility that tube
ruptures in more than one generator
at a plant could cause "ineffective
reflooding" of the radioactive core,
which in turn could lead to melting
of the uranium fuel.
What does the NRC report say
about the possibility of correcting
these mistakes? The terse language of
the report continues: "There are no
simple corrective actions, particular
ly at older plants. Design changes in
operating steam generators that
would be necessary to eliminate de
gradation problems are virtually im

possible." It goes on to say that the
problem could get worse with the
use of similar generator designs in
more than a dozen plants scheduled
to open in the next two years.
This is not a small matter of pulling
and replacing a few pipes. It is a rath
er larger problem: the existence of
serious and basic design flaws in the
reactors themselves. These design
flaws give one little confidence that
those who work and live near a nu
clear reactor can be protected
against harmful radiation even in the
course of the reactor's normal opera

don. And then, of course, another
and totally separate question arises:
what shall we do with the
astronomical amounts of radioactive
waste produced in the normal course
of the nuclear fuel cycle?
Indeed, the question of what to do
with the toxic, long-lived by-prod
ucts of nuclear energy is such a seri
ous one that I am inclined to say this:
even if the nuclear reactors did not
have serious design flaws, we could
not sanely and reasonably continue
to rely on nuclear technology.
There is no solution to the problem

of nuclear wastes except not letting
them accumulate in the first place.
There is no room on the beautiful
American landscape for nuclear re
actors. It's not worth taking chances
with our gene pool only to find out
that we were wrong. Given all that is
at stake, it would be better to err on
the side of caution and survive than
err in the direction of blind faith and
be incinerated.
