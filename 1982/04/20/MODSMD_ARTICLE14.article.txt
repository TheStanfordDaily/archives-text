## Facing the facts of Cabaret life forces exit, panic and tears 
### 
Flashback. 1931 Hitler Germany. Ever feel like you just
can't hold back the tears? Ever feel like you are going to
be sick? Ever feel surrounded by Nazi soldiers? Ever feel
terrorized?
This flashback became a reality for me on Thursday
night when I went to the Ram's Head production of
"Cabaret." Whereas I generally walk out of movies
which I consider unmoving, boring, ineffective and
aesthetically worthless, I simply had to walk out of
"Cabaret." Why? Because it was too realistic, too mov
ing, too powerful and too close to home. I felt sur
rounded by Nazis in Memorial Auditorium
The cold, stark reality of the moment struck me. Think
of it this way: we could have been sitting in a "Cabaret"
or any auditorium in pre-war Germany listening in
nocently to a production. Similarly, Thursday night, we,
members of the Stanford community, were innocently
sitting in Memorial Auditorium being entertained by our
fellow students. Suddenly, students dressed « NaTic
filled the auditorium singing the haunting Nazi hymn
"Tomorrow Belongs to Me," wearing armbands and pos
ing in the usual full salute stance. Although it was a play, I
was really scared! I was overcome with a wave of panic,
followed by a rush of uncontrollabletearsand an intense
desire to walk out screaming: Do you know what you are
doing?
This knowledge works on two levels.
For the actors wearingthe Nazi costumes: Did you find
it easy to slip into an authoritarian position? Did you

know what you were wearing? Were you aware of the
implications of the swastika — the intolerance, the evil,
the death of 12 million human beings, half of whom were
Jewish? Do you have a conscience? Does it bother you?
How can you condone your actions — not as actors but
as intelligent, educated members of the Stanford com
munity?

How can you condone your actions — not as actors but as

On another level, I appeal to the audience in this way:
Do you know what you were watching unfold before
your eyes? Did the realism of the moment strike any
chord of irony, pain or injustice? Or did you feel swept
up in a movement — part of a frenzied crowd? How
could you justify sitting peacefully in your warm, com
fortable seats looking on ... were you, in fact, a partici
pant? Were you really in Palo Alto, California or could

you just as easily have been in Berlin, Germany? Was it
really 1982 or was it 1931 ? Could it have been 1933 when
Hitler officially came to power and the first concentra
tion camp was opened at Dachau? Or, could it have been
Kristallnacht (The Night of Broken Glass) in 1938? Did
you ever consider what those Nazi Swastikas represent:
the degradation of millions of people who were

barbarically tortured, and then innocently slaughtered
in concentation camps? Did you ever consider that
"Cabaret" was, perhaps, torturing some people — like
myself — who know not only the historic reality of 1931
but also know, due to hindsight and sensitivity, the pain
associated with the ensuing event we call the Holocaust?
Did you ever consider that the Nazis are synonymous
with "extermination": of people, ideas and civilization.

Did you feel overwhelmed by the production? Did
you want to walk out because your emotions, spurred by
the reality of the moment, were uncontrollable? Did you
think about the message implicit in the production? The
scare of having Nazis roam Mem Aud at intermission, did
that move you? If so, then perhaps the production
served a purpose. If you did not feel touched, albeit
slightly, by "Cabaret," if you were busy wondering what
the weather report would hold for the next day, if you
planning weekend festivities, if... then I question your
knowledge of history. I question your ability to feel for
other human beings; I question your jbility to reason
and to extract the full meaningof the horror of glistening
swastikas in Mem Aud and Germany, or other such vis
ible symbols in Vietnam, El Salvador... and I question
you...
Remember where the "Cabaret" leads. Think abut
why you laughed in certain places. Remember the
power of the moment — the almost sinister ease of fol
lowing the crowd. Above all, remember the horrors" 1
which follower Hit!or's rise to power.
I waited out not because I dian't appreciate the effort,
time, energy ar:d dedication of all those involved in the
production; rather, I walked out because I was con
sumed by the irony and realism of the moment. Because
it was a scarv, frightening, and horrible nightmare. A real
event. Panic, iears. Flashback.

Do you know what you were watching unfold before
your eyes? Did the realism of the moment strike any
chord of irony, pain or injustice? Or did you feel swept
up in a movement — part of a frenzied crowd? How
could you justify sitting peacefully in your warm, com
fortable seats looking on ... were you, in fact, a partici
pant? Were you really in Palo Alto, California or could

you just as easily have been in Berlin, Germany? Was it
really 1982 or was it 1931 ? Could it have been 1933 when
Hitler officially came to power and the first concentra
tion camp was opened at Dachau? Or, could it have been
Kristallnacht (The Night of Broken Glass) in 1938? Did
you ever consider what those Nazi Swastikas represent:
the degradation of millions of people who were

barbarically tortured, and then innocently slaughtered
in concentation camps? Did you ever consider that
"Cabaret" was, perhaps, torturing some people — like
myself — who know not only the historic reality of 1931
but also know, due to hindsight and sensitivity, the pain
associated with the ensuing event we call the Holocaust?
Did you ever consider that the Nazis are synonymous
with "extermination": of people, ideas and civilization.

Did you feel overwhelmed by the production? Did
you want to walk out because your emotions, spurred by
the reality of the moment, were uncontrollable? Did you
think about the message implicit in the production? The
scare of having Nazis roam Mem Aud at intermission, did
that move you? If so, then perhaps the production
served a purpose. If you did not feel touched, albeit
slightly, by "Cabaret," if you were busy wondering what
the weather report would hold for the next day, if you
planning weekend festivities, if... then I question your
knowledge of history. I question your ability to feel for
other human beings; I question your jbility to reason
and to extract the full meaningof the horror of glistening
swastikas in Mem Aud and Germany, or other such vis
ible symbols in Vietnam, El Salvador... and I question
you...
Remember where the "Cabaret" leads. Think abut
why you laughed in certain places. Remember the
power of the moment — the almost sinister ease of fol
lowing the crowd. Above all, remember the horrors" 1
which follower Hit!or's rise to power.
I waited out not because I dian't appreciate the effort,
time, energy ar:d dedication of all those involved in the
production; rather, I walked out because I was con
sumed by the irony and realism of the moment. Because
it was a scarv, frightening, and horrible nightmare. A real
event. Panic, iears. Flashback.

Flashback. 1931 Hitler Germany. Ever feel like you just
can't hold back the tears? Ever feel like you are going to
be sick? Ever feel surrounded by Nazi soldiers? Ever feel
terrorized?
This flashback became a reality for me on Thursday
night when I went to the Ram's Head production of
"Cabaret." Whereas I generally walk out of movies
which I consider unmoving, boring, ineffective and
aesthetically worthless, I simply had to walk out of
"Cabaret." Why? Because it was too realistic, too mov
ing, too powerful and too close to home. I felt sur
rounded by Nazis in Memorial Auditorium
The cold, stark reality of the moment struck me. Think
of it this way: we could have been sitting in a "Cabaret"
or any auditorium in pre-war Germany listening in
nocently to a production. Similarly, Thursday night, we,
members of the Stanford community, were innocently
sitting in Memorial Auditorium being entertained by our
fellow students. Suddenly, students dressed « NaTic
filled the auditorium singing the haunting Nazi hymn
"Tomorrow Belongs to Me," wearing armbands and pos
ing in the usual full salute stance. Although it was a play, I
was really scared! I was overcome with a wave of panic,
followed by a rush of uncontrollabletearsand an intense
desire to walk out screaming: Do you know what you are
doing?
This knowledge works on two levels.
For the actors wearingthe Nazi costumes: Did you find
it easy to slip into an authoritarian position? Did you

know what you were wearing? Were you aware of the
implications of the swastika — the intolerance, the evil,
the death of 12 million human beings, half of whom were
Jewish? Do you have a conscience? Does it bother you?
How can you condone your actions — not as actors but
as intelligent, educated members of the Stanford com
munity?
