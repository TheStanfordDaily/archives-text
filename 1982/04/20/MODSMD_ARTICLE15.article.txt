## Daily endorsements are 'unprofessional' 
### 
Hil My Name is Eleanor Meltzer,
I'm a junior majoring in International
Relations, and I'm starting early on
my campaign for Daily endorsement.
No kidding.
While it should come as no sur
prise to anyone that almost everyone
and everything that The Stanford Dai
ly supported in the latest ASSU elec
tion won, the means by which the
people and the issues passed should
have been ca«e for at least a fleeting
moment of reflection. Although
neither the ASSU nor The Stanford
Daily is a professional organization,
the Daily has taken upon itself the
task of critiquing candidates for the
ASSU on a professional basis.
On reading the Daily's endorse
ments, one fact should have been
frighteningly obvious. The prime
quality that seemed to make a can
didate acceptable in the Daily's eyes
was evidence of previous ASSU ex
perience. Based on a ten-minute in
terview, the Daily gave free, glowing
publicity to endorsed candidates.
What you can ascertain about a per
son in ten minutes, besides the color
of his socks, I don't know, but the
Daily didn't flinch in facing this mon
umental task of candidate endorse
ment.
No wonder then that "ASSU 'in
siders' dominate COP, Senate," —
the Daily clearly encouraged the per
petuation of the inside track, as if the
ASSU was some sort of professional
body, rather than the student-run ve
hicle for gaining experience in poli
tics at a very local level that it was
meant to be.
This is not to say that the Daily's in
terest in campus politics is inap
propriate. As the only Stanford paper
published on an almost-everyday
basis, I applaud the Daily's efforts to
enhance the political awareness of
students at Stanford. However, rath
er than endorsing individuals, a
method that is inherently fraught
with inequalities, I think that the Dai
ly should devote space to each can
didate — or slate-written paragraph,
containing whatever the party in
question thinks will get it elected.
These "biographical" blurbs should
be run at least a week before the
scheduled election, in order to give
people the opportunity to air their

opinions.
Fairness is one thing. Overzealous
pseudo-journalism is another. Since
none of us are professionals, in the
sense that we do not make our livings
writing for the Daily or running the
affairs of Stanford through the ASSU,
it is ridiculous to expect (or require)
professional candidates for our stu
dent governments, or even pro
fessional newspaper coverage of our
election. However, there are some
things which, if they cannot be done
professionally, should not be done at

all. Daily endorsement of ASSU can
didates is one of those things.

Editor's note: In fact, one half of the
undergraduate ASSU Senate
candidates endorsed by the Daily
were not elected. Endorsement was
based primarily upon the candidates'
written statement, in addition to an
interview.
