## BET'M campaign: 'cheap tactics' 
### 
Many of us who followed last
year's presidential campaign may
have found ourselves disillusioned
with the cheap tactics employed by
both candidates simply to gain votes.
Until recently, I was very pleased that
candidates seeking office here at
Stanford avoided these tactics of
slander and yellow journalism.
Last week, however, the slate run
ning for COP under the cutesy
acronym "BET'M" issued an inflam
matory, inaccurate flier about Uni
versity Food Service.
According to Beckstrom, Epstein,
Townsend and Mathewson's flier —
"Unlimited Food for Thought" —
our University food service food is a
"$7,000,000 operation which pro
vides meals to students at an actual
cost of $1.92 per breakfast, $2.88 per
lunch and $4.85 per dinner." Permit
me to point out that the University
Food Service is a $4 million to $5 mil
lion operation during the academic
year. The $1 to $2 million in revenue,
which is acquired through the sum
mer conference program, is used to
subsidize the academic year's costs.
In fact this extra revenue often helps
to keep down the costs to students
during the academic year.
Furthermore, according to Kay
Gaskin, administrative assistant for
University Food Service, the "actual
cost" of meals is $1.45 for breakfast,

$2.18 for lunch and $3.64 for dinner.
Clearly BET'M's figures are wrong. It
is interesting to note that the "error"
is one which overestimates reality —
a common characteristic of yellow
journalism.
BET'M claims that if a family of four
were to eat on a food service plan for
365 days it would cost approximately
$10,000. This is an accurate figure ac
cording to the figures provided by
Kay Gaskin. If one follows the figures
provided by BET'M a family of four
would pay $14,050. BET'M's own fig
ures of cost per meal and cost per
year simply do not coincide with
each other. Yet another research er
ror.
BET'M then claims that "other uni
versities" provide better food at 60 to
70 percent of Stanford's cost. Wheth
er food is better at "other univer
sities" is a highly subjective judgment
which I won't debate. As for "other
universities" providing food at 60 to
70 percent of Stanford's cost, this is
BET'M's highly dubious technique of
comparing apples with oranges.
BET'M does not seem to realize that
"other universities" often contract
with private firms and that such firms
pay only for the cost of the food and
the salaries of their employees. The
University absorbs the costs of re
pairs, maintenance, supplies and
most significantly, utilities.

On the Stanford campus our food
service pays for food, salaries, as well
as repairs, supplies and utilities. Nat
urally the cost may be less for stu
dents at "other universities."
Yet Stanford is different from these
unnamed "other universities." Many
of these other universities are public
ly funded and can therefore provide
not only education but also food at a
lower cost to the student.
While analyzing our food service it
is essential to keep in mind that we, as
consumers, are purchasing a service.
This service provides a wide variety of
choices at every meal, cooks our
meals for us and cleans up after us.
Frankly I think the price we pay is
very reasonable. After all, where
could we possibly buy an equivalent
service for $7.27 per day for three
meals with an "all you can eat" poli
cy?
Let's admit that it is quite popular
to rag on food service. After all, It is
an easy target for inflammatory, inac
curate attacks such as BET'M's flier.
I would like to know if BET'M itself
has researched possible alternatives.
If the inaccuracies of their flier are
any indication of their competence
at research directed at reform, I
doubt we will see any constructive
proposals from BET'M.
