# Professors, grad students learn to teach at campus center
## 
### Lauren Saunders 
The skills needed to com
municate information effec
tively to students do not come
naturally to everyone, even
(and, at times, especially) to the
most brilliant of professors or
graduate students.
However, Stanford's Center
for Teaching and Learning
(CTL), is working to change
this. Since 1975, the CTL has
provided a number of services
to everyone from the novice
teaching assistant (TA) to the
experienced professor who
wishes to improve his or her
teaching.
The CTI. located in the Asian
Languages building (in the out
er Quad across from Green Li
brary), was first established at
Stanford under a grant from
the Danforth Foundation, an
education-oriented private
foundation. The original grant
proposal was very general —
the Center was to work to im
prove teaching in the Bay Area.
The focus of .the CTL at that
time was off-campus; Stanford
professors lectures and
workshops to Bay Area teach
ers who wished to take advan
tage of the professors' ex
pertise.
When this grant expired in
1978, the University picked up
the funding, and the Center
has consequently become to
tally campus-oriented, aimed
primarily at Stanford graduate
students and professors. The
CTL is now directed by
Michele Fisher, a former Stan
ford undergraduate who re
turned in 1977 after completing
her Ph.D. in Chinese History at
Georgetown University.
For those who are setting up
a course for the first time or
who would like to improve an
existing one, Fisher has edited
an introductory handbook on
Teaching at Stanford, which is
available free of charge at the
CTL. This handbook gives tips
on everything from the prepa
ration for teaching (the course
outline, syllabus and adminis
trative details like ordering
books) to descriptions of dif
ferent teaching situations (i.e.,
lectures, discussions sections
or labs). In addition, the hand
book describes testing and
grading and course evaluation,
as well as the proposal side of

teaching.
For new graduate students or
undergraduate TAs, the CTL
also offers a half-day orien
tation workshop one week
before the start of autumn
quarter every year. This work
shop is voluntary and has been
taped for those who begin
work as TAs winter or spring
quarters.
Videotaping is another ser
vice provided by the CTL. This
is free and confidential and can
be one of the most effective
methods for evaluation and
improvement of teaching. The
taping itseif is unobtrusive, and
consultation is available after
ward when viewing the tape.
The role of the cqnsultant is to
help the person discover what
should be changed and to pro
vide suggestions on how this
can be done.
The idea of videotaping
scares many people, although
Fisher feels that the experience
is often an "enormous relief."
"A person's imagination can
run wild, and many people fear
that they have horrible habits,"
Fisher said.
Once the person taped gets
over this initial confrontation
with appearance, the consul
tant concentrates on the struc
ture of the teaching itself, em
phasizing the clarity and logic
of the presentation and the im
portance of good examples.
According to Fisher,
videotaping can be especially
helpful in discussion sections,
and some departments require
or strongly urge that their TAs
use the service at the begin
ning of the year. But even such
experienced and popular in
structors as former political sci
ence professor Nannerl
Keohane have come to the CTL
to perfect their skills and pres
entation.
Another method of feed
back offered by the CTL more
directly involves the students.
The information available on
the end-of-quarter evaluation
forms often comes too late or is
too general to be constructive.
Students can also be quite vi

cious in their comments, and
an otherwise flexible instructor
may consequently become
stubborn and unresponsible to
student concerns, Fisher said.
Furthermore, an instructor
may know that the course
needs better organization or
that the lecturesare hard to fol
low, but he or she may not
know what specific changes
are needed.
One way to alleviate this
problem is for a CTL consultant
to come into the classroom
and, after the instructor has
left, divide the class into small
groups. For 10 minutes each
group discusses exactly what it
values about the course, which
areas need improvement, and
what suggestions the students
would make for change. The
consultant then receives and
clarifies the responses from a
spokesperson for each group,
and later presents the con
clusions to the instructor in a
private consultation.
"This service encourages
students to be more thoughtful
in their criticisms," Fisher
added. She explained it was
used about 35 times last fall by
professors of everything from
engineering to philosophy.
According to Fisher, many
people have seen dramatic
changes in their teaching after
using these services. Although
she emphasizes the im
portance of the first class meet
ings in establishing a rapport
with the students, she feels that
students can be very forgiving
if an instructor makes an effort
at improvement. Often it is
simply a matter of restoring a
person's confidence in his or
her abilities.
The consultants for these
services are usually TAs nomi
nated by the different depart
ments. The Center thus can of
fer the person the choice of a
consultant in his or her field.
These TA consultants do much
to motivate and encourage
others and are a source of
energy and enthusiasm for the
Center, Fisher said. Fisher
herself is also involved in con

suiting.
Professors, too, are active at
the CTL. They present work
shops or lecture series two to
three times a quarter. These
have included such seminars as
"Can Teaching be Taught: Pro
vocative Methods of Section
Leadership," "Games Teachers
Play: Gaming, Simulations, and
Role Plays as Instructional
Techniques," and "Grading:
The Agony and the Equity." In
May a series is planned dealing
with TA/faculty relationships.
Another area which will be
explored next fall is "Instruc
tional Applications of Micro
computers."
This program will be pre
sented in conjunction with the .
Center for Information and
Technology (CIT).
The CTL also sponsors work
shops focusing on public
speaking skills. Most lectures
and workshops are announced
in the Daily and to those on
CTL's mailing list.
Stanford's CTL, while one of
the oldest in the country, is not
unique. Approximately half of
the campuses across the nation
have some sort of similar ser
vice. The one at Harvard is very
comparable to Stanford's,
Fisher said. As the Universities
have much in common, they
have found that what works at
one will often work at the oth
er, and the two centers cor
respond regularly.
Does Fisher believe that
teaching can be taught? "Defi
nitely." Although some feel
that at universities such as Stan
ford, the emphasis on research
can be a detriment to teaching,
Fisher disagrees.
"There are abundant ex
amples at Stanford of instruc
tors who have managed to suc
cessfully combine research and
feeling," she said. Many gradu
ate students have also been re
porting the importance of
teaching abilities on the job
market, and more and more
schools are evidently giving at
tention to the development of
skills in this area, she said.

existing one, Fisher has edited
an introductory handbook on
Teaching at Stanford, which is
available free of charge at the
CTL. This handbook gives tips
on everything from the prepa
ration for teaching (the course
outline, syllabus and adminis
trative details like ordering
books) to descriptions of dif
ferent teaching situations (i.e.,
lectures, discussions sections
or labs). In addition, the hand
book describes testing and
grading and course evaluation,
as well as the proposal side of

teaching.
For new graduate students or
undergraduate TAs, the CTL
also offers a half-day orien
tation workshop one week
before the start of autumn
quarter every year. This work
shop is voluntary and has been
taped for those who begin
work as TAs winter or spring
quarters.
Videotaping is another ser
vice provided by the CTL. This
is free and confidential and can
be one of the most effective
methods for evaluation and
improvement of teaching. The
taping itseif is unobtrusive, and
consultation is available after
ward when viewing the tape.
The role of the cqnsultant is to
help the person discover what
should be changed and to pro
vide suggestions on how this
can be done.
The idea of videotaping
scares many people, although
Fisher feels that the experience
is often an "enormous relief."
"A person's imagination can
run wild, and many people fear
that they have horrible habits,"
Fisher said.
Once the person taped gets
over this initial confrontation
with appearance, the consul
tant concentrates on the struc
ture of the teaching itself, em
phasizing the clarity and logic
of the presentation and the im
portance of good examples.
According to Fisher,
videotaping can be especially
helpful in discussion sections,
and some departments require
or strongly urge that their TAs
use the service at the begin
ning of the year. But even such
experienced and popular in
structors as former political sci
ence professor Nannerl
Keohane have come to the CTL
to perfect their skills and pres
entation.
Another method of feed
back offered by the CTL more
directly involves the students.
The information available on
the end-of-quarter evaluation
forms often comes too late or is
too general to be constructive.
Students can also be quite vi

cious in their comments, and
an otherwise flexible instructor
may consequently become
stubborn and unresponsible to
student concerns, Fisher said.
Furthermore, an instructor
may know that the course
needs better organization or
that the lecturesare hard to fol
low, but he or she may not
know what specific changes
are needed.
One way to alleviate this
problem is for a CTL consultant
to come into the classroom
and, after the instructor has
left, divide the class into small
groups. For 10 minutes each
group discusses exactly what it
values about the course, which
areas need improvement, and
what suggestions the students
would make for change. The
consultant then receives and
clarifies the responses from a
spokesperson for each group,
and later presents the con
clusions to the instructor in a
private consultation.
"This service encourages
students to be more thoughtful
in their criticisms," Fisher
added. She explained it was
used about 35 times last fall by
professors of everything from
engineering to philosophy.
According to Fisher, many
people have seen dramatic
changes in their teaching after
using these services. Although
she emphasizes the im
portance of the first class meet
ings in establishing a rapport
with the students, she feels that
students can be very forgiving
if an instructor makes an effort
at improvement. Often it is
simply a matter of restoring a
person's confidence in his or
her abilities.
The consultants for these
services are usually TAs nomi
nated by the different depart
ments. The Center thus can of
fer the person the choice of a
consultant in his or her field.
These TA consultants do much
to motivate and encourage
others and are a source of
energy and enthusiasm for the
Center, Fisher said. Fisher
herself is also involved in con

suiting.
Professors, too, are active at
the CTL. They present work
shops or lecture series two to
three times a quarter. These
have included such seminars as
"Can Teaching be Taught: Pro
vocative Methods of Section
Leadership," "Games Teachers
Play: Gaming, Simulations, and
Role Plays as Instructional
Techniques," and "Grading:
The Agony and the Equity." In
May a series is planned dealing
with TA/faculty relationships.
Another area which will be
explored next fall is "Instruc
tional Applications of Micro
computers."
This program will be pre
sented in conjunction with the .
Center for Information and
Technology (CIT).
The CTL also sponsors work
shops focusing on public
speaking skills. Most lectures
and workshops are announced
in the Daily and to those on
CTL's mailing list.
Stanford's CTL, while one of
the oldest in the country, is not
unique. Approximately half of
the campuses across the nation
have some sort of similar ser
vice. The one at Harvard is very
comparable to Stanford's,
Fisher said. As the Universities
have much in common, they
have found that what works at
one will often work at the oth
er, and the two centers cor
respond regularly.
Does Fisher believe that
teaching can be taught? "Defi
nitely." Although some feel
that at universities such as Stan
ford, the emphasis on research
can be a detriment to teaching,
Fisher disagrees.
"There are abundant ex
amples at Stanford of instruc
tors who have managed to suc
cessfully combine research and
feeling," she said. Many gradu
ate students have also been re
porting the importance of
teaching abilities on the job
market, and more and more
schools are evidently giving at
tention to the development of
skills in this area, she said.

The skills needed to com
municate information effec
tively to students do not come
naturally to everyone, even
(and, at times, especially) to the
most brilliant of professors or
graduate students.
However, Stanford's Center
for Teaching and Learning
(CTL), is working to change
this. Since 1975, the CTL has
provided a number of services
to everyone from the novice
teaching assistant (TA) to the
experienced professor who
wishes to improve his or her
teaching.
The CTI. located in the Asian
Languages building (in the out
er Quad across from Green Li
brary), was first established at
Stanford under a grant from
the Danforth Foundation, an
education-oriented private
foundation. The original grant
proposal was very general —
the Center was to work to im
prove teaching in the Bay Area.
The focus of .the CTL at that
time was off-campus; Stanford
professors lectures and
workshops to Bay Area teach
ers who wished to take advan
tage of the professors' ex
pertise.
When this grant expired in
1978, the University picked up
the funding, and the Center
has consequently become to
tally campus-oriented, aimed
primarily at Stanford graduate
students and professors. The
CTL is now directed by
Michele Fisher, a former Stan
ford undergraduate who re
turned in 1977 after completing
her Ph.D. in Chinese History at
Georgetown University.

ture of the teaching itself, em
phasizing the clarity and logic
of the presentation and the im
portance of good examples.
According to Fisher,
videotaping can be especially
helpful in discussion sections,
and some departments require
or strongly urge that their TAs
use the service at the begin
ning of the year. But even such
experienced and popular in
structors as former political sci
ence professor Nannerl
Keohane have come to the CTL
to perfect their skills and pres
entation.
Another method of feed
back offered by the CTL more
directly involves the students.
The information available on
the end-of-quarter evaluation
forms often comes too late or is
too general to be constructive.
Students can also be quite vi

cious in their comments, and
an otherwise flexible instructor
may consequently become
stubborn and unresponsible to
student concerns, Fisher said.
Furthermore, an instructor
may know that the course
needs better organization or
that the lecturesare hard to fol
low, but he or she may not
know what specific changes
are needed.
One way to alleviate this
problem is for a CTL consultant
to come into the classroom
and, after the instructor has
left, divide the class into small
groups. For 10 minutes each
group discusses exactly what it
values about the course, which
areas need improvement, and
what suggestions the students
would make for change. The
consultant then receives and
clarifies the responses from a
spokesperson for each group,
and later presents the con
clusions to the instructor in a
private consultation.
"This service encourages
students to be more thoughtful
in their criticisms," Fisher
added. She explained it was
used about 35 times last fall by
professors of everything from
engineering to philosophy.
According to Fisher, many
people have seen dramatic
changes in their teaching after
using these services. Although
she emphasizes the im
portance of the first class meet
ings in establishing a rapport
with the students, she feels that
students can be very forgiving
if an instructor makes an effort
at improvement. Often it is
simply a matter of restoring a
person's confidence in his or
her abilities.
The consultants for these
services are usually TAs nomi
nated by the different depart
ments. The Center thus can of
fer the person the choice of a
consultant in his or her field.
These TA consultants do much
to motivate and encourage
others and are a source of
energy and enthusiasm for the
Center, Fisher said. Fisher
herself is also involved in con

suiting.
Professors, too, are active at
the CTL. They present work
shops or lecture series two to
three times a quarter. These
have included such seminars as
"Can Teaching be Taught: Pro
vocative Methods of Section
Leadership," "Games Teachers
Play: Gaming, Simulations, and
Role Plays as Instructional
Techniques," and "Grading:
The Agony and the Equity." In
May a series is planned dealing
with TA/faculty relationships.
Another area which will be
explored next fall is "Instruc
tional Applications of Micro
computers."
This program will be pre
sented in conjunction with the .
Center for Information and
Technology (CIT).
The CTL also sponsors work
shops focusing on public
speaking skills. Most lectures
and workshops are announced
in the Daily and to those on
CTL's mailing list.
Stanford's CTL, while one of
the oldest in the country, is not
unique. Approximately half of
the campuses across the nation
have some sort of similar ser
vice. The one at Harvard is very
comparable to Stanford's,
Fisher said. As the Universities
have much in common, they
have found that what works at
one will often work at the oth
er, and the two centers cor
respond regularly.
Does Fisher believe that
teaching can be taught? "Defi
nitely." Although some feel
that at universities such as Stan
ford, the emphasis on research
can be a detriment to teaching,
Fisher disagrees.
"There are abundant ex
amples at Stanford of instruc
tors who have managed to suc
cessfully combine research and
feeling," she said. Many gradu
ate students have also been re
porting the importance of
teaching abilities on the job
market, and more and more
schools are evidently giving at
tention to the development of
skills in this area, she said.
