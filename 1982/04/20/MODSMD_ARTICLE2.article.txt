# Nuclear experts stress deterrence

Debating the proper role of nucle
ar weapons in defense planning, nu
clear physicist Sidney Drell said yes
terday in Annenberg Auditorium
that the "sole purpose of nuclear
weapons is to deter nuclear war" and
they should not be considered a sub
stitute for conventional arms.
His opponent in the debate, Rob
ert Barker of the Lawrence Livermore
Laboratory, citing the past and cur
rent NATO policy of countering a So
viet conventional attack upon
Western Europe with nuclear arms,
replied that "we need to deter any
kind of conventional conflict be

tween the Soviets and ourselves."
Barker, who heads a staff of 100
people analyzing the nuclear weap
ons systems of foreign countries, said
that protecting Europe solely with
conventional weapons would be
costly and would require a "substan
tial increase in our own armed forces,
as well as the armed forces of our
NATO allies, in terms of manpower."
He asked, "are we ready to see the re
turn to the draft in order to provide
an army necessary to maintain a con
ventional deterrence in Europe?"
Drell, deputy director of SLAC and
a consultant on arms control to the

National Security Council, said that
"nuclear weapons . .. are fun
damentally different from other
weapons." He stated that "nuclear
weapons are just not militarily
usable."
Drell also disagreed with Barker
over the expense of maintaining a
conventional deterrent, disputing
Barker's claim that it would cost three
times the amount currently spent on
conventional forces. Drell conceded
that the balance of conventional
forces in Europe at present favored
the Soviets over NATO.
Both Barker and Drell supported
the idea of nuclear deterrence.
Barker said that preparation "is the
most sensible form of preventing a
nuclear war," and Drell noted that
deterrence "has worked." He said
that we "have to make deterrence
work â€” there is no alternative ..."
Drell and Barker agreed that a "lim
ited nuclear war" would probably
lead to an all-out war and that most
politicians believe that a "limited"
war would spread.
Drell explained his fear that tech
nology was lessening the deterrents
of the superpowers. "What's new in
war fighting," he said, was that mis
siles are becoming so accurate that
one country could destroy the mis
siles of another country in a "first
strike" attack, and escape total re
taliation. Drell said that it was "a mis
take" to "threaten each other's nu
clear deterrent".
Barker and Drell agreed that no
technology exists that would allow a
large fraction of the population of
the United States to survive a nuclear
war. "We don't know how to do it,"
said Drell.
Drell told the audience of about
175 that one nuclear bomb dropped
over the Bay Area would cause
1,000,000 to 2,000,000 casualties.
Barker said that we have to think of
such catastrophes, unpleasant as that
might be: "It's easy to portray war
fighting as something completely dif
ferent, completely abhorrent, as
something that has the aspect of an
insane man that thinks we can fight a
war with nuclear weapons and sur
vive. The reality of it is that we've got
to deter the Soviets..."
The debate was sponsored by the
Stanford Arms Control and Disarma
ment Forum as part of Ground Zero
Week.
