## Disturbing, vulgar, and immoral: the Event arrives 
### Katie Smith 
Cabaret
Memorial Auditorium/Stanford
15 April 1982
Last Thursday night, milling in a crowd of
hundreds around Tanner Fountain, theatre
goers were treated to champagne, hors
d'oeuvres, a balmy breeze and lots of open
ing night pageantry. Thus, in the slickest pro
motion of any show to hit campus in the past
four years, Ram's Head's production of
Kander and Ebb's Cabaret opened amid
Hoover Tower spotlight and a $3,000 recep
tion (sponsored by Pernod Liquors). Produc
tion staff was in tails, the audience in semi
formal attire and the energy level high.
There seemed no doubting it was "the
event."
Then, the doors to Memorial Auditorium
opened, militarily dressed ushers directed
guests to their seats and handed out a pro
gram that to all appearances could have
been Playbill. At 8:00 the lights dimmed and
at 8:15 the glamorous promotional package
hadproved a veritable "Pandora's Box." The
opening scenes drew on pelvic thrusts, sex
ual gyrations and vaginal caresses. Then the
show got vulgar. You were just feeling glad
yoU hadn't brought the whole family, when
you started to wonder if you should have
come at all. Life was much happier outdoors
sipping champagne around the fountain.
In short, Cabaret provides a profoundly
disturbing form of entertainment; a show
style ambitiously new to independent
theatre here. The plot centers around an
American would-be writer, Clifford Brad
shaw (Chris Halsted), who goes to Berlin to
work on his "novel" and winds up involved
in tT)e decadence and cruelty of Germany on
the brink of Nazi take-over. The story turns
on the growth and degeneration of two rela
tionships — that of Halsted and cabaret
singer Sally Bowles (Cindi Flippo) and that of
an elderly couple, Fraulein Schneider (Kerry
Atha), a spinster, and Herr Schultz (Alex
Kaufman), a Jew. The show presents un
pleasant facts about the period — the per

secution of Jews, the maniac appeal of
Hitler's movement and the cabaret-inspired
hedonism which served as an avenue of
drunken, sensual escape for those not want
ing to face Berlin's brutal political realities.
It is not a comfortable show to watch. It
confronts and even implicates the audience,
forcing on observers the same moral choice
that the stage characters face. One can dis
miss the shows social/political ramifications,
as does Sally Bowles, assert that "life is a
cabaret" and take pleasure merely in the

gaudy spectacle of bright costumes, grinding
voices and flashy choreography. One can
resign oneself to history like Fraulein
Schneider and Herr Schulz, contenting
oneself with surviving the show's depression
and hoping things get better. Finally, like
Bradshaw, one can walk-out, decide "the
party's over in Berlin" and go back to pleas
ant America ... California ... Stanford.
Just decide that the truth is terrible, fright
ening, unresolvable and relegate it to
"nightmare" categorization.
The staging of such a complex production

could only be a challenge. Ironically, the
technicians, who virtually foisted Cabaret on
Ram's Head as the "only" acceptable choice
for "the Spring Show," fared the worst in
meeting the show's demands. The sound was
often poor as actors walked unadvised into
"dead spots"on the stage, and lighting was
frequently slow to hit the mark.
Director Robert Greenberg's input
showed both flashes of brilliance and unac
ceptable self-indulgence. His insertion of or
iginally unscripted songs such as "Mon
ey"and "Maybe This Time," added im
measurably to the plot progression, au
dience appeal and gave both choreographer
Martha Carter and lead Flippo a chance to
show their best talents. His incorporation of
pieces of Nazi-Jewish conflict was his
greatest success, achieved with such subtlety
that one could only fit the Star-of-David-
Swastika puzzle together in retrospect
On the other hand Greenberg's program
content and use of slides to accentuate por
tions of show's theme demonstrated both
lack of taste and timing. The program in
cluded inappropriate essays and cast notes
that warpedly begged their intended humor.
The slide sequences detracted from the
show's overall credibility. The first sequence
of pre-World War II Berlin shots disrupted
the plot's early development and the second
sequence of George Grosz nudes needlessly
compounded the show's already
heightened sense of the vulgar.
The final sequence offended both in
telligence and history by classing Adolf
Hitler, Martin Luther King Jr., Walter
Cronkite and Alexander Haig as points on
the same continuum of mass movement
leaders. Perhaps if Greenberg had devoted
less time to personal statements and more to
character interpretation and German ac
cents the show's acting would have tran
scended the mediocre.
If acting and technical aspects were weak,
the musical direction and choreography
were Cabaret's strong suits. The opening
dance, featuring the talented Kit Kat Klub
dancers, first startled then gripped the au

dience with its unabashed raunch. Kicklines
abounded and numbers were consistently
innovative, especially the openings of the
first and second act, the "Telephone Dance"
and "If You Could See Her Through My
Eyes." Carter showed a real sense of the
show's message in her work, as dances
moved insidiously from "good dirty fun" to
movements'charged with political signifi
cance. The striking dynamics of Schulz and
Schneider's engagement party dances best
showed this transition.
Singing voices and musical arrangements
were outstanding — reflecting musical di
rector Susan Silverman's refinement of the
cast's raw talent. The difficult harmonizing in
"Tomorrow Belongs To Me," theme song of
the Nazi youth, evidenced particularly suc
cessful coaching.
As in any production, stars will shine and
Cabaret's brightest was unquestionably the
mysterious Master of Ceremonies, Tyler
Ochoa. His part dictated versatility and he
filled the bill with a wide vocal range, thick
German accent, perfectly diabolical facial
expressions and a marvellous sense of tim
ing. His ability to project the farcically sin
ister truly set the pace of the show, involving
the audience in both humor and paranoid
doubt. Atha and Kaufman's portrayal of
elderly lovers was endearing, if a little stud
ied, and while Flippo's overdramatic poses
strained the imagination, her singing was by
far the most captivating and professional of
the show. The greatest dramatic moment
came when Flippo spellbound the audience
with her rendition of "Life is a Cabaret" un
aware that her "old chum" Halsted lay
bleeding and beaten by Nazis.
Was it a good show or a bad show? Well, in
terms of performance, it penetrated a new
frontier of Stanford's "let's do a show" men
tality. That's certainly a welcome advance
ment. In most cases it stretched the per
formers' talents to their creative peripheries
and where it failed it was only because they
tried too hard in too many directions. Is it a
likable show? That's a more personal ques
tion. ..

Martha Carter and lead Flippo a chance to
show their best talents. His incorporation of
pieces of Nazi-Jewish conflict was his
greatest success, achieved with such subtlety
that one could only fit the Star-of-David-
Swastika puzzle together in retrospect
On the other hand Greenberg's program
content and use of slides to accentuate por
tions of show's theme demonstrated both
lack of taste and timing. The program in
cluded inappropriate essays and cast notes
that warpedly begged their intended humor.
The slide sequences detracted from the
show's overall credibility. The first sequence
of pre-World War II Berlin shots disrupted
the plot's early development and the second
sequence of George Grosz nudes needlessly
compounded the show's already
heightened sense of the vulgar.
The final sequence offended both in
telligence and history by classing Adolf
Hitler, Martin Luther King Jr., Walter
Cronkite and Alexander Haig as points on
the same continuum of mass movement
leaders. Perhaps if Greenberg had devoted
less time to personal statements and more to
character interpretation and German ac
cents the show's acting would have tran
scended the mediocre.
If acting and technical aspects were weak,
the musical direction and choreography
were Cabaret's strong suits. The opening
dance, featuring the talented Kit Kat Klub
dancers, first startled then gripped the au

dience with its unabashed raunch. Kicklines
abounded and numbers were consistently
innovative, especially the openings of the
first and second act, the "Telephone Dance"
and "If You Could See Her Through My
Eyes." Carter showed a real sense of the
show's message in her work, as dances
moved insidiously from "good dirty fun" to
movements'charged with political signifi
cance. The striking dynamics of Schulz and
Schneider's engagement party dances best
showed this transition.
Singing voices and musical arrangements
were outstanding — reflecting musical di
rector Susan Silverman's refinement of the
cast's raw talent. The difficult harmonizing in
"Tomorrow Belongs To Me," theme song of
the Nazi youth, evidenced particularly suc
cessful coaching.
As in any production, stars will shine and
Cabaret's brightest was unquestionably the
mysterious Master of Ceremonies, Tyler
Ochoa. His part dictated versatility and he
filled the bill with a wide vocal range, thick
German accent, perfectly diabolical facial
expressions and a marvellous sense of tim
ing. His ability to project the farcically sin
ister truly set the pace of the show, involving
the audience in both humor and paranoid
doubt. Atha and Kaufman's portrayal of
elderly lovers was endearing, if a little stud
ied, and while Flippo's overdramatic poses
strained the imagination, her singing was by
far the most captivating and professional of
the show. The greatest dramatic moment
came when Flippo spellbound the audience
with her rendition of "Life is a Cabaret" un
aware that her "old chum" Halsted lay
bleeding and beaten by Nazis.
Was it a good show or a bad show? Well, in
terms of performance, it penetrated a new
frontier of Stanford's "let's do a show" men
tality. That's certainly a welcome advance
ment. In most cases it stretched the per
formers' talents to their creative peripheries
and where it failed it was only because they
tried too hard in too many directions. Is it a
likable show? That's a more personal ques
tion. ..

Cabaret
Memorial Auditorium/Stanford
15 April 1982
Last Thursday night, milling in a crowd of
hundreds around Tanner Fountain, theatre
goers were treated to champagne, hors
d'oeuvres, a balmy breeze and lots of open
ing night pageantry. Thus, in the slickest pro
motion of any show to hit campus in the past
four years, Ram's Head's production of
Kander and Ebb's Cabaret opened amid
Hoover Tower spotlight and a $3,000 recep
tion (sponsored by Pernod Liquors). Produc
tion staff was in tails, the audience in semi
formal attire and the energy level high.
There seemed no doubting it was "the
event."
Then, the doors to Memorial Auditorium
opened, militarily dressed ushers directed
guests to their seats and handed out a pro
gram that to all appearances could have
been Playbill. At 8:00 the lights dimmed and
at 8:15 the glamorous promotional package
hadproved a veritable "Pandora's Box." The
opening scenes drew on pelvic thrusts, sex
ual gyrations and vaginal caresses. Then the
show got vulgar. You were just feeling glad
yoU hadn't brought the whole family, when
you started to wonder if you should have
come at all. Life was much happier outdoors
sipping champagne around the fountain.
In short, Cabaret provides a profoundly
disturbing form of entertainment; a show
style ambitiously new to independent
theatre here. The plot centers around an
American would-be writer, Clifford Brad
shaw (Chris Halsted), who goes to Berlin to
work on his "novel" and winds up involved
in tT)e decadence and cruelty of Germany on
the brink of Nazi take-over. The story turns
on the growth and degeneration of two rela
tionships — that of Halsted and cabaret
singer Sally Bowles (Cindi Flippo) and that of
an elderly couple, Fraulein Schneider (Kerry
Atha), a spinster, and Herr Schultz (Alex
Kaufman), a Jew. The show presents un
pleasant facts about the period — the per

secution of Jews, the maniac appeal of
Hitler's movement and the cabaret-inspired
hedonism which served as an avenue of
drunken, sensual escape for those not want
ing to face Berlin's brutal political realities.
It is not a comfortable show to watch. It
confronts and even implicates the audience,
forcing on observers the same moral choice
that the stage characters face. One can dis
miss the shows social/political ramifications,
as does Sally Bowles, assert that "life is a
cabaret" and take pleasure merely in the

gaudy spectacle of bright costumes, grinding
voices and flashy choreography. One can
resign oneself to history like Fraulein
Schneider and Herr Schulz, contenting
oneself with surviving the show's depression
and hoping things get better. Finally, like
Bradshaw, one can walk-out, decide "the
party's over in Berlin" and go back to pleas
ant America ... California ... Stanford.
Just decide that the truth is terrible, fright
ening, unresolvable and relegate it to
"nightmare" categorization.
The staging of such a complex production

could only be a challenge. Ironically, the
technicians, who virtually foisted Cabaret on
Ram's Head as the "only" acceptable choice
for "the Spring Show," fared the worst in
meeting the show's demands. The sound was
often poor as actors walked unadvised into
"dead spots"on the stage, and lighting was
frequently slow to hit the mark.
Director Robert Greenberg's input
showed both flashes of brilliance and unac
ceptable self-indulgence. His insertion of or
iginally unscripted songs such as "Mon
ey"and "Maybe This Time," added im
measurably to the plot progression, au
dience appeal and gave both choreographer
Martha Carter and lead Flippo a chance to
show their best talents. His incorporation of
