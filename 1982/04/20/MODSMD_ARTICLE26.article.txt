# Rickie Lee's music, not revelation, is pleasing

Rickie Lee Jones
Berkeley Community Theatre
11 April 1982
The first thing you should have noticed at this concert
was what a great singer Rickie Lee Jones really is. Over
the course of two and a half hours, singing songs as di
vers® as "My Funny Valentine" and"The Love You
Save," she did things with her voice that Betty Carter or
Billie Holiday could have envied. If you missed that, you
might have noticed right away how good a band she's as
sembled for this tour — how they mixed and matched
effortlessly, moving with ease from the artsy dramatics of
Jones' own songs to wall-of-sound pop tunes and
straight rockers.
Those things had to sink in as the concert went along,
however, because there were certain visual aspects of
the show that just reached out and grabbed your atten
tion before you had a chance to hear anything. Like the
backs of Rickie Lee Jones' thighs, which you don't get to
see on the album covers. Too much cellulite. You could
see them here because, for most of the concert, Jones
wore a black bra and panties and a short black negligee.

She complemented these with a red jacket and red cap,
which she put on and took off at strategic moments; the
concert bore more than a passing resemblance to a strip
show. It also had elements of a freshman dorm talent
hour, like the Jack Daniels Jones swigged when she
wasn't forcing it on the band members or passing it out in
Dixie cups to the audience.
Despite a few transplendant moments — like "The
Love You Save," where Jones sounded so much like
Michael Jackson at age eight it was eerie, a riveting ver
sion of Left Bank's "Walk Away Renee," an almost a cap
pella rendering of the Stylistic's mid-'7os Philadelphia
sound hit "You Are Everything" with beautiful im
provised vocal harmonies — the concert never really
caught fire; it just wasn't much fun to watch. Jones asked
the audience to accept, along with a lot of great music,
the spectacle of her insecurities being acted out on stage
on a grand scale. It was hard not to get the point after the
third or fourth repetition of "I'm so scared" or "Don't
you love me?" or "I don't hear you" (this last referring to
applause levels), and after being told again how wonder
ful the audiences in Denver and Cleveland were.
Jones and her band established an atmosphere some
what like that of an extended jam at a Grateful Dead con

cert — that this was a private party being held for the mu
sician's enjoyment, and the audience was lucky to have
the chance to sit and watch the band having fun —
without trying for any of the Dead's warmth, and kept it
up for the entire show. A song would end, and the peo
ple on stage would turn to each other as if to say, well,
that was nice, what do you want to do next and where are
you going after the show?
Jones could have taken charge of the show, and given
it some shape, but she never did. She let the boys in the
ba nd take over for long stretches, and their endless mug
ging and running around were endlessly boring. Jones
seemed to spend most of her time trying to forget she
was on stage — she would wander back toward the
drums and dance with her back to the audience, or flirt
with the trumpet player, and leave us itching forthe next
song.
But when the songs came, you temporarily forgot
about the little psychodrama that was being carried on.
Jones sings magnificently, in, it seems, every popular idi
om — she croons, she belts, she wails, and she never
shows a bit of strain. The high point of the concert was
probably her hushed rendition of "My Funny Valen

tine," which took the audience by surprise. The re
sponse to the song was overwhelming, and Jones im
mediately launched into "Lush Life," by Billy Strayhorn
(Duke Ellington's lyricist for years), another ballad —
proving that if she didn't exactly connect with the au
dience, she was at least listening to it.
Jones' own compositions suffered in performance.
They were done straight through and in a strangely
"staged" manner, as if they were being videotaped for
Top of the Pops. This was perhaps the biggest disappoint
ment of the concert — after wondering for weeks what
"We Belong Together" and "Woody and Dutch on the
Slow Train to Peking" world sound like live, I could have
closed my eyes and pretended I was listening to the
albums.
Maybe this was just fear again — fear her own songs
wouldn't measure up on their own, and needed to be
performed with high seriousness. She should know by
now that people love her songs and the way she sings
them, whatever they think of her. If she'd lighten up a
little on stage, and give up the pistcl-packin', whiskey
drinkin' mama act, I, for one, would love her uncondi
tionally.
