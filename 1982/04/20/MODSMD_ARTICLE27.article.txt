# Movement leads meaning in detached, eccentric dance

i"The ideas of the dance come both from the move
[ment, and are in the movement. It has no reference out
jside that." Thus spoke choreographer Merce Cun-
Iningham many years ago. Last weekend in Berkeley, the
jMerce Cunningham Dance Company, led by the old
himself, gave us the physical proof of what Cun-
Iningham meant by those words.
j On Saturday night, three works were performed:
""Trails," "Locale" and "Roadrunners." In these dances,
movement is everything, and is sufficient unto itself.The
;movement doesn't spring from a musical source, nor
'from a desire to depict a human drama or to delineate a
Ifeeling (such as anger, tenderness, or grief). If you can
!say that the dancing comes from anywhere, it's from a
simple desire to move, an inner impulse to leap, turn,
! twist, pause and start again — to carve the air with one's
; physical being. The fulfillment of this inner impulse re
isuits in movement that communicates to the spectator
!an inner, perhaps unconscious, feeling — a feeling that
| eludes transcription into words, just as music cannot re
• ally be described in words.
Nor does the movement, once it has sprung into
j being, seek a musical setting. Cunningham's dances
have no musical accompaniment in the conventional
I sense. Instead, his composers provide a low-keyed and
; shapeless flux of background noise. Disparate elec
• tronic, spoken, or recorded sounds murmer and chatter
i with the randomness of sounds from the natural world.
The opening work, "Trails," struck me immediately by
1 its indebtedness to classical ballet. Releves, pirouettes
! and chaines are in abundant evidence, though the danc
; ing is all barefoot and not on point. But instead of the up
ward lilt of ballet, the movement has a solid, athletic,
down-into-the-floor feeling. Feet vigorously planted,
; the dancers measure the stage-distance with long,
healthy strides. The mens' leaps have that emphatic, driv
! ing quality that you see in the triple-jump of track-and-

field.
At times the dancers decelerate into slow-motion, and
they take on a serious, careful-air. Each separate move is
underlined, and seems an end and a pleasure in itself. At
these times, "Trails" describes a mood that is somehow
painstaking and watchful. The overall tenor of the piece,
in fact, is one of both alertness and meditation. There is a
deliberate, ruminative feeling — the kind you get from,
say, studying old letters, and reflecting anew and serious
ly on episodes in the past.
The costumes (simple leotards and T-shirts) add to the
subtle tension via their color-scheme (fire-engine red
against dull grey). And John Cage's score is both calm
and suspenseful. A soft, whooshing sound is ever-pres
ent — like drawn-out breathing or the susurration of wa
ter. Superimposed on this is the far-away snore of —
what? some kind of earth-moving machinery? — plus
distant street noises, horns honking, and once or twice
an emergency siren.
If there is a drawback to Cunningham's style, it is a cer
tain sameness of effect, which became apparent in the
second work, "Locale." Again, a mostly formless stream
of movement is juxtaposed against a mostly formless
stream of sound, evoking in us a subliminal feeling.
The only thing that rescues the dancing from
monotony is Cunningham's inexhaustible variety of
movement, and the intricate interweaving of his dan
cers.
"Locale" drops the frequent references to ballet; the
flow of movement becomes less sweeping, more punchy
and angular. The motifs are sharper — etched with a
stylus rather than sketched smoothly with a pencil. A
dancer draws his knee to his chin, or cranes his arms to
plant his fingertips on his shoulders. Backs are dramati
cally arched — straining backwards to the limit, or doubl
ing forward. Shoulders point and twist. The women lean
tensely, and are held by the men in strenuous poses.
Direction is often reversed; the dancing, though brisk,
has a stop-start quality. "Locale" evokes a mood of un
easiness, and made me think of tossing and turning in

bed, trying to fall asleep.
Its score is a catalog of croaks, crackles, chirps and
whirrs. There are electronic sounds reminiscent of
someone belching in a drainpipe, or blowing softly in a
soda bottle. There's a buzz like an electric razor, and
fragmented spoken words.
"Roadrunners," true to its title, slips into a slightly an
tic frame of mind. The movement is playful and herky
jerky, and it seems to be splattered across the stage like
the paint on a Jackson Pollock canvas. The dancers scurry
around like pinballs; their leaps are small explosions,
and they erupt in nervous tics, hands fluttering. There is
kicking and poking, and a lot of quirkiness. Non-se
quiturs of movement tumble after one another in a
tongue-in-cheek way. The dancers, dressed ridiculously
in plain white, suddenly don berets, scarves, vests, or
dresses. They dust one another off with small white
cloths. A man (Merce Cunningham himself) bustles from
place to place onstage, trying to put on his shoes and
socks before being flattened by a runaway dancer.
If these pieces were music, it would be marked stac
cato or detache, not legato. And indeed the accompany
ing sound design is full of the pointillistic sound of
plucked strings, both piano strings and a Japanese-soun
ding instrument. Simultaneously, a sort of an

thropological text is read haltingly;
something that might crop up in an
Fantastic and Obscure Peoples." The t

intact, like "their ears grew wings" or'
five colors of hair."
