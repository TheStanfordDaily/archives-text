# Morrison follows his beautiful visions to a haunting effect

i
j For all his lyrical skill and his
seriously artistic intentions, I
see Van Morrison's greatest tal
, ent to be his ability to create a
mood. Before giving any
thought to what he was saying
j in "Moondatwse," I k«ew the
1 song was about a late-evening,
romantic moment. His voice
didn't explain anything so
much as it served as another in
strument in a song that estab
lished an atmosphere. I'd guess
that even Morrison's most de
i voted fans, who listen to one of
1 his albums hundreds of times,
t don't come away quoting a
' particularly thoughtful line or
pondering any message. They
listen for the experience.
! His new, carefully crafted
album, Beautiful Vision,
doesn't depend on lyrics to
[ make its essence clear. Mor
■ rison's gift is that, after one lis

tening, one can feel its serenity
and see its Scottish foothills. He
claims not to be a songwriter at
all, since he can't write on de
mand. He says he's not a
craftsman, but an artist who

can only write when inspired.
Perhaps this is why his music
here seems not to be a creation
of the mind so much as one of
the spirit.
"Celtic Ray," which opens
the album, makes it clear that
spirit stayed in Ireland when his
body moved to San Francisco.
The soft bagpipes may not be
particularly subtle, but they are
effective in taking the listener
away from America, and its
pop/rock, to, in this case,
Scotland. "Listen to me," he
sings, "I want to go home."
And so he tries to take us with
him to a place where all moth
ers eventually call all children
home. Somehow, though not
stated, we know we're seeing
the land at dawn; such is his tal
ent for atmosphere.

"Celtic Ray" combines with
"Cleaning Windows," the
album's other clearly auto
biographical number, to pref
ace the vision of his title. In
"Cleaning Windows" he tells
us of his musical and literary
heroes (Leadbelly, Blind
Lemon, Kerouac) and of his
role alongside them. "What's
My Life?... I'm a working man
in my prime, cleaning win
dows." He uses their art to
clear away the dirt that clouds
the view, the vision, of all peo
ple. This perception of himself
must please him, because the
song's upbeat, R&B style sets it
off from the other numbers'
serene, reflective tones.
He told a radio interviewer
that he's had this album in him
for 20 years. This thought,

being at finger's length from
mystical understanding
without being able to move
towards it, inspires "Dweller
on the Threshold." Not surpris
ingly, once he finds the vision,
it's a religious one of sorts. "I
will sing the song of ages and
the dawn will end the night" he
said hopefully in "Dweller,"
later to add, "Send me your
Bible" in "Vanlose Stairway."
But his final discovery
doesn't belong to any dogma.
When Morrison finds his
heaven "Across the Bridge
Where Angels Dwell," he sees
children playing, presumably
the same children being called
in "Celtic Ray." Morrison is a
romantic, a man who loves to
love, and his loves will be his
reward. After "send me your

the view, the vision, of all peo

off from the other numbers'
serene, reflective tones.

! Beautiful Vision
j Van Morrison
i Warner Brothers Records
i
j For all his lyrical skill and his
seriously artistic intentions, I
see Van Morrison's greatest tal
, ent to be his ability to create a
mood. Before giving any
thought to what he was saying
j in "Moondatwse," I k«ew the
1 song was about a late-evening,
romantic moment. His voice
didn't explain anything so
much as it served as another in
strument in a song that estab
lished an atmosphere. I'd guess
that even Morrison's most de
i voted fans, who listen to one of
1 his albums hundreds of times,
t don't come away quoting a
' particularly thoughtful line or
pondering any message. They
listen for the experience.
! His new, carefully crafted
album, Beautiful Vision,
doesn't depend on lyrics to
[ make its essence clear. Mor
■ rison's gift is that, after one lis

tening, one can feel its serenity
and see its Scottish foothills. He
claims not to be a songwriter at
all, since he can't write on de
mand. He says he's not a
craftsman, but an artist who

can only write when inspired.
Perhaps this is why his music
here seems not to be a creation
of the mind so much as one of
the spirit.
"Celtic Ray," which opens
the album, makes it clear that
spirit stayed in Ireland when his
body moved to San Francisco.
The soft bagpipes may not be
particularly subtle, but they are
effective in taking the listener
away from America, and its
pop/rock, to, in this case,
Scotland. "Listen to me," he
sings, "I want to go home."
And so he tries to take us with
him to a place where all moth
ers eventually call all children
home. Somehow, though not
stated, we know we're seeing
the land at dawn; such is his tal
ent for atmosphere.

"Celtic Ray" combines with
"Cleaning Windows," the
album's other clearly auto
biographical number, to pref
ace the vision of his title. In
"Cleaning Windows" he tells
us of his musical and literary
heroes (Leadbelly, Blind
Lemon, Kerouac) and of his
role alongside them. "What's
My Life?... I'm a working man
in my prime, cleaning win
dows." He uses their art to
clear away the dirt that clouds
the view, the vision, of all peo
ple. This perception of himself
must please him, because the
song's upbeat, R&B style sets it
off from the other numbers'
serene, reflective tones.
