Argentina to invoke treaty
Buenos Aires, Argentina â€” Argentina announced yesterday that it
would seek to invoke an inter-American defense treaty against Britain, a
step that has been strongly opposed by the United States.
Argentine Foreign Minister Nicanor Costa Mendez, the principal Ar
gentine representative in four straight days of talks with Haig, said last
night that Argentina would move to invoke the Rio Treaty of 1947 in the
Organization of American States. Argentina is expected to take the ac
tion at a special OAS meeting today in Washington.
Costa Mendez coupled his announcement on the planned invoking
of the mutual assistance agreement with a statement that Argentina's
latest proposal for a settlement of the crisis "foresaw the possibility of a
limited time" during which the competing claims of Argentina and Brit
ain over the South Atlantic islands could be negotiated. The minister
added, however, that Argentina's position on the crucial issue of the
"full and certain recognition of (its) sovereignty" over the islands had
not changed and would not change.
Haig was reported by Argentine officials to have carried a "working
document" containing new Argentine proposals when he left yesterday
afternoon for Washington. Argentine press reports yesterday morning
said Buenos Aires had made important new concessions in its bargain
ing position.
The Argentine initiative invoking the Rio Treaty focuses on Article 6,
which binds the United States and 21 other American nations to mutual
action in the event of "any fact or situation that might endanger the
peace of America." The treaty specifies that the threat does not have to
be an armed attack.
(In Washington, State Department officials said they would have no
comment on Argentina's plan to invoke the treaty. The United States
was expected to express its position at the OAS meeting.)
Haig, who met for more than 25 hours with Argentine officials begin
ning last Friday, has repeatedly urged Argentina not to seek to use the
treaty against Britain. He publicly warned that "there are a number of
complications" that made use of the treaty inappropriate.
