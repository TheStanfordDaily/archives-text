Argentina to invoke treaty
Buenos Aires, Argentina — Argentina announced yesterday that it
would seek to invoke an inter-American defense treaty against Britain, a
step that has been strongly opposed by the United States.
Argentine Foreign Minister Nicanor Costa Mendez, the principal Ar
gentine representative in four straight days of talks with Haig, said last
night that Argentina would move to invoke the Rio Treaty of 1947 in the
Organization of American States. Argentina is expected to take the ac
tion at a special OAS meeting today in Washington.
Costa Mendez coupled his announcement on the planned invoking
of the mutual assistance agreement with a statement that Argentina's
latest proposal for a settlement of the crisis "foresaw the possibility of a
limited time" during which the competing claims of Argentina and Brit
ain over the South Atlantic islands could be negotiated. The minister
added, however, that Argentina's position on the crucial issue of the
"full and certain recognition of (its) sovereignty" over the islands had
not changed and would not change.
Haig was reported by Argentine officials to have carried a "working
document" containing new Argentine proposals when he left yesterday
afternoon for Washington. Argentine press reports yesterday morning
said Buenos Aires had made important new concessions in its bargain
ing position.
The Argentine initiative invoking the Rio Treaty focuses on Article 6,
which binds the United States and 21 other American nations to mutual
action in the event of "any fact or situation that might endanger the
peace of America." The treaty specifies that the threat does not have to
be an armed attack.
(In Washington, State Department officials said they would have no
comment on Argentina's plan to invoke the treaty. The United States
was expected to express its position at the OAS meeting.)
Haig, who met for more than 25 hours with Argentine officials begin
ning last Friday, has repeatedly urged Argentina not to seek to use the
treaty against Britain. He publicly warned that "there are a number of
complications" that made use of the treaty inappropriate.
The Argentine announcement on the treaty came
after Haig said in a departing statement here that
"time is indeed running out" for a peaceful solution
to the 17-day-old confrontation between Argentina
and Britain over the Falklands, which Argentina in
vaded April 2.
Haig said that the talks had led to a "further identi
fication and refinement of the Argentine position."
Air Force Commander and junta member Basilio
Lami Dozo said that "we are closer to peace than war"
with Britain, whose war fleet is slowly approaching
the South Atlantic archipelago.
But the statements of both Costa Mendez and Haig
indicated that the crisis was still not certain of a peace
ful solution.
Haig, in a formal statement at Buenos Aires' Ezeiza
Airport, said he was "more convinced than ever that
war in the South Atlantic would be the greatest of
tragedies and that time indeed is running out."
Britain opposes Argentine offer
London — Without rejecting them, the British gov
ernment said yesterday that new Argentine proposals
made to Secretary of State Alexander Haig for a settle
ment of the Falkland Islands crisis appeared to fall
short of what would be acceptable to Parliament
here.
In a statement shortly before midnight near the end
of an emergency meeting of senior government of
ficials, a spokesman for Prime Minister Margaret
Thatcher said the proposals "are complex and dif
ficult, and at first sight they do not meet the require
ments strongly expressed by Parliament, particularly
on the need to regard as paramount the wishes of the
Falkland Islanders.
"We shall study them carefully, however," the
spokesman said, "and shall be getting in touch again
with Haig."
Thatcher received the proposals, which British
sources described as "very different" from Argen
tina's earlier negotiating position, in a message from
Haig at about 9 p.m. London time, just as he was leav
ing Buenos Aires for Washington. British officials said
they did not know if Haig would later return to Lon
don, a decision that appears to hinge on the initial re
sponse he receives from Thatcher.
During yesterday's meeting with senior civilian and
military aides, Thatcher discussed what answer to give
Haig and what recommendations to make to a special
Cabinet meeting today. Cecil Parkinson, chairman of
Thatcher's Conservative Party, joined the meeting to
advise her on the likely reaction of Conservative
members of Parliament.
Many of them have warned that it could be politi
cally disastrous for Thatcher to agree to joint adminis
tration of the Falklands with Argentina under the flags
of both countries following a withdrawal of Argentine
forces from the islands, as the Argentine military gov
ernment has reportedly proposed. There also ap
peared to be no mechanism in the reported Argen
tine proposals for involvement of the Falklands' 1,800
English-speaking residents in U.N.-supervised nego

tiation of the future sovereignty and administration of
the islands.
Earlier during Haig's shuttle diplomacy, Thatcher's
government considered sharing interim adminis
tration of the Falklands with the United States or an
international body. But Argentine participation in any
such administration has been opposed by many
members of Parliament. Thatcher also has insisted,
with strong parliamentary support, that any nego
tiated settlement on the Falklands' long-term future
be acceptable to the islands' residents.
Israelis evict Sinai settlers
Rafah, Sinai — Israeli army troops forcibly evicted
militant Jewish settlers from three agricultural settle
ments in the northern Sinai Peninsula yesterday and
swiftly moved reinforcements into position on the
Mediterranean coastal town of Yamit for a showdown
with more than 2,000 opponents of the Egyptian-Is
raeli peace treaty less than a week before the sched
uled withdrawal deadline.
The evacuations were accomplished without vi
olent confrontation or bloodshed, army officials said,
but they were conducted out of sight of journalists,
who were sharply restricted in their movements.
Security forces continued to pour into the Sinai by
the hundreds from staging areas along the border as
an almost unbroken stream of flatbed trucks hauling
prefabricated houses and bomb shelters flowed
northward in a frenetic race against time before yes
terday's turnover. Several thousand troops are be
lieved to be involved in the operation.
As the round-the-clock evacuation and dismantl
ing process progressed, Prime Minister Menachem
Begin met with senior Egyptian officials in an effort to
resolve outstanding disputes in the peace treaty, in
cluding demarcation line disagreements and conflict
ing views on post-withdrawal relations. But both sides
sought to minimize the tensions that created an at
mosphere of crisis between the two countries in the
past two weeks.
As he finished an evening meeting with Begin and
prepared to return to Cairo, Egyptian Foreign Min
ister Kamal Hassan Ali told reporters that "new ideas
emerged to bridge the gap," but that no conclusive
agreement was reached.
"The next few days will witness, we hope, the happy
ending to these contacts," Ali said. He said he was
"fully confident" that Israel will complete its Sinai
withdrawal on time.
Court to decide race case
Washington — The Supreme Court served notice
yesterday that it will decide whether private schools
that discriminate against raciai minorities are entitled
to tax-exempt status, despite the Reagan adminis
tration's shift in position on the issue.
The justices selected William Coleman, the black
Republican lawyer who served as President Ford's
secretary of transportation, to defend the Internal
Revenue Service's denial of tax exemptions to these
schools. His appointment was required because the
Reagan administration decided not to defend the

longstanding IRS policy on tax exemptions.
The case will not be heard at the Supreme Court un
til next fall or winter. When it is, Coleman will be
pitted against lawyers for Bob Jones University in
Greenville, S.C., the Goldsboro Christian Schools in
Goldsboro, N.C., and the Reagan administration, all
of whom will argue that the IRS had no authority to
deny tax-exempt status to the schools.
Black students were barred from enrolling at Bob
Jones University until 1971. Since then, they have
been admitted, but the university has a strict rule
against interracial dating or marriage. The Goldsboro
Christian schools, which run from kindergarten
through high school, do not admit blacks.
Since 1970, under a policy first approved by Presi
dent Nixon, the IRS has refused tax exemptions to
private schools that discriminate racially. Citing that
policy, IRS officials originally denied tax-exempt sta
tus both to Bob Jones and to the Goldsboro schools.
When those institutions went to court to seek tax
exempt status, the Department of Justice at first suc
cessfully defended the IRS policy. In 1980, the U.S.
Fourth Circuit Court of Appeals in Richmond, Va.,
upheld the IRS ruling that Bob Jones and Goldsboro
were not entitled to tax breaks.
But after the Supreme Court agreed to take up the
case, the Reagan administration did a sudden turn
about. On Jan. 8, just as Department of Justice officials
were about to file a legal brief supporting the denial
of tax exemptions, Department of the Treasury of
ficials announced they had decided that Bob Jones
and Goldsboro deserved tax-exempt status.
That action touched off the most serious civil rights
controversy the Reagan administration has encoun
tered. President Reagan later explained that he did
not believe the executive branch of the federal gov
ernment should have cut off tax exemptions to the
schools without the approval of Congress.
Reagan promotes black
Washington — President Reagan announced the
promotion of his highest-ranking black aide yester
day and the appointment of another black to the pres
idential staff to handle trade policy as part of a wider
effort to improve the White House's relations with
black Americans.
In announcing the personnel actions, deputy press
secretary Larry Speakes said the administration is also
contemplating other appointments and methods "to
strengthen the administration's outreach efforts
among minorities and the disadvantaged."
Elevation of Melvin Bradley, 44, from senior consul
tant to special assistant to the president was designed
to "place a key black White House staff member in
the mainstream of administration policy develop
ment" and to give him reponsibility for continuously
monitoring the impact of all administration policies
"on minorities and the disadvantaged," Speakes said.
Yesterday's appointment of Wendell Wilkie Gunn,
a conservative black Republican who is currently as
sistant treasurer for PepsiCo Inc., to be a special assis
tant to thfe president handling commerce and trade is
sues, will bring the number of black presidential aides
to six.

Reagan won office with less than 15 perc
black vote. Black opposition to the admini« ,of,,,t
policies on civil rights, spending cuts for atlon '$

Cuts in defense possible
Washington — President Reagan's budget ren
for defense could be reduced safely by $32 billirmT
year to bring an $11.1 billion cut in actual spendin
the author of major Pentagon policy papers throut
Democratic and Republican administrations said v
terday.
William Kaufmann, a high-level consultant to<k
fense secretaries from Robert McNamara to Harold
Brown over the last two decades, makes that are
ment in the new study, "Setting National Priorities'
published by the Brookings Institution.
Kaufmann's detailed recommendations pass f res [,
ammunition to those in Congress already takingshots
at Reagan's request for a peacetime record of$2SJ
billion for defense in fiscal 1983. The Senate is e *.
pected to take the first of several congressional votes
on that request next week.
Kaufmann said he favors spending more than in the
past to strengthen the nation's defenses but con
tended at a press luncheon at Brookings that the Rea.
gan administration has gone overboard in its money
requests.
Rather than go along with Reagan's request for an
nual spending increases of 8 percent for defense for
the next five years, Kaufmann said, the nation would
be better served by limiting the yearly increases t06.5
percent and getting more bang for its bucks.
Stocks get scattered gains

report late Friday of a $7.1 billion jump in the money
supply.

Court to decide race case
Washington — The Supreme Court served notice
yesterday that it will decide whether private schools
that discriminate against raciai minorities are entitled
to tax-exempt status, despite the Reagan adminis
tration's shift in position on the issue.
The justices selected William Coleman, the black
Republican lawyer who served as President Ford's
secretary of transportation, to defend the Internal
Revenue Service's denial of tax exemptions to these
schools. His appointment was required because the
Reagan administration decided not to defend the

longstanding IRS policy on tax exemptions.
The case will not be heard at the Supreme Court un
til next fall or winter. When it is, Coleman will be
pitted against lawyers for Bob Jones University in
Greenville, S.C., the Goldsboro Christian Schools in
Goldsboro, N.C., and the Reagan administration, all
of whom will argue that the IRS had no authority to
deny tax-exempt status to the schools.
Black students were barred from enrolling at Bob
Jones University until 1971. Since then, they have
been admitted, but the university has a strict rule
against interracial dating or marriage. The Goldsboro
Christian schools, which run from kindergarten
through high school, do not admit blacks.
Since 1970, under a policy first approved by Presi
dent Nixon, the IRS has refused tax exemptions to
private schools that discriminate racially. Citing that
policy, IRS officials originally denied tax-exempt sta
tus both to Bob Jones and to the Goldsboro schools.
When those institutions went to court to seek tax
exempt status, the Department of Justice at first suc
cessfully defended the IRS policy. In 1980, the U.S.
Fourth Circuit Court of Appeals in Richmond, Va.,
upheld the IRS ruling that Bob Jones and Goldsboro
were not entitled to tax breaks.
But after the Supreme Court agreed to take up the
case, the Reagan administration did a sudden turn
about. On Jan. 8, just as Department of Justice officials
were about to file a legal brief supporting the denial
of tax exemptions, Department of the Treasury of
ficials announced they had decided that Bob Jones
and Goldsboro deserved tax-exempt status.
That action touched off the most serious civil rights
controversy the Reagan administration has encoun
tered. President Reagan later explained that he did
not believe the executive branch of the federal gov
ernment should have cut off tax exemptions to the
schools without the approval of Congress.
Reagan promotes black
Washington — President Reagan announced the
promotion of his highest-ranking black aide yester
day and the appointment of another black to the pres
idential staff to handle trade policy as part of a wider
effort to improve the White House's relations with
black Americans.
In announcing the personnel actions, deputy press
secretary Larry Speakes said the administration is also
contemplating other appointments and methods "to
strengthen the administration's outreach efforts
among minorities and the disadvantaged."
Elevation of Melvin Bradley, 44, from senior consul
tant to special assistant to the president was designed
to "place a key black White House staff member in
the mainstream of administration policy develop
ment" and to give him reponsibility for continuously
monitoring the impact of all administration policies
"on minorities and the disadvantaged," Speakes said.
Yesterday's appointment of Wendell Wilkie Gunn,
a conservative black Republican who is currently as
sistant treasurer for PepsiCo Inc., to be a special assis
tant to thfe president handling commerce and trade is
sues, will bring the number of black presidential aides
to six.

Argentina to invoke treaty
Buenos Aires, Argentina — Argentina announced yesterday that it
would seek to invoke an inter-American defense treaty against Britain, a
step that has been strongly opposed by the United States.
Argentine Foreign Minister Nicanor Costa Mendez, the principal Ar
gentine representative in four straight days of talks with Haig, said last
night that Argentina would move to invoke the Rio Treaty of 1947 in the
Organization of American States. Argentina is expected to take the ac
tion at a special OAS meeting today in Washington.
Costa Mendez coupled his announcement on the planned invoking
of the mutual assistance agreement with a statement that Argentina's
latest proposal for a settlement of the crisis "foresaw the possibility of a
limited time" during which the competing claims of Argentina and Brit
ain over the South Atlantic islands could be negotiated. The minister
added, however, that Argentina's position on the crucial issue of the
"full and certain recognition of (its) sovereignty" over the islands had
not changed and would not change.
Haig was reported by Argentine officials to have carried a "working
document" containing new Argentine proposals when he left yesterday
afternoon for Washington. Argentine press reports yesterday morning
said Buenos Aires had made important new concessions in its bargain
ing position.
The Argentine initiative invoking the Rio Treaty focuses on Article 6,
which binds the United States and 21 other American nations to mutual
action in the event of "any fact or situation that might endanger the
peace of America." The treaty specifies that the threat does not have to
be an armed attack.
(In Washington, State Department officials said they would have no
comment on Argentina's plan to invoke the treaty. The United States
was expected to express its position at the OAS meeting.)
Haig, who met for more than 25 hours with Argentine officials begin
ning last Friday, has repeatedly urged Argentina not to seek to use the
treaty against Britain. He publicly warned that "there are a number of
complications" that made use of the treaty inappropriate.
The Argentine announcement on the treaty came
after Haig said in a departing statement here that
"time is indeed running out" for a peaceful solution
to the 17-day-old confrontation between Argentina
and Britain over the Falklands, which Argentina in
vaded April 2.
Haig said that the talks had led to a "further identi
fication and refinement of the Argentine position."
Air Force Commander and junta member Basilio
Lami Dozo said that "we are closer to peace than war"
with Britain, whose war fleet is slowly approaching
the South Atlantic archipelago.
But the statements of both Costa Mendez and Haig
indicated that the crisis was still not certain of a peace
ful solution.
Haig, in a formal statement at Buenos Aires' Ezeiza
Airport, said he was "more convinced than ever that
war in the South Atlantic would be the greatest of
tragedies and that time indeed is running out."
Britain opposes Argentine offer
London — Without rejecting them, the British gov
ernment said yesterday that new Argentine proposals
made to Secretary of State Alexander Haig for a settle
ment of the Falkland Islands crisis appeared to fall
short of what would be acceptable to Parliament
here.
In a statement shortly before midnight near the end
of an emergency meeting of senior government of
ficials, a spokesman for Prime Minister Margaret
Thatcher said the proposals "are complex and dif
ficult, and at first sight they do not meet the require
ments strongly expressed by Parliament, particularly
on the need to regard as paramount the wishes of the
Falkland Islanders.
"We shall study them carefully, however," the
spokesman said, "and shall be getting in touch again
with Haig."
Thatcher received the proposals, which British
sources described as "very different" from Argen
tina's earlier negotiating position, in a message from
Haig at about 9 p.m. London time, just as he was leav
ing Buenos Aires for Washington. British officials said
they did not know if Haig would later return to Lon
don, a decision that appears to hinge on the initial re
sponse he receives from Thatcher.
During yesterday's meeting with senior civilian and
military aides, Thatcher discussed what answer to give
Haig and what recommendations to make to a special
Cabinet meeting today. Cecil Parkinson, chairman of
Thatcher's Conservative Party, joined the meeting to
advise her on the likely reaction of Conservative
members of Parliament.
Many of them have warned that it could be politi
cally disastrous for Thatcher to agree to joint adminis
tration of the Falklands with Argentina under the flags
of both countries following a withdrawal of Argentine
forces from the islands, as the Argentine military gov
ernment has reportedly proposed. There also ap
peared to be no mechanism in the reported Argen
tine proposals for involvement of the Falklands' 1,800
English-speaking residents in U.N.-supervised nego

tiation of the future sovereignty and administration of
the islands.
Earlier during Haig's shuttle diplomacy, Thatcher's
government considered sharing interim adminis
tration of the Falklands with the United States or an
international body. But Argentine participation in any
such administration has been opposed by many
members of Parliament. Thatcher also has insisted,
with strong parliamentary support, that any nego
tiated settlement on the Falklands' long-term future
be acceptable to the islands' residents.
Israelis evict Sinai settlers
Rafah, Sinai — Israeli army troops forcibly evicted
militant Jewish settlers from three agricultural settle
ments in the northern Sinai Peninsula yesterday and
swiftly moved reinforcements into position on the
Mediterranean coastal town of Yamit for a showdown
with more than 2,000 opponents of the Egyptian-Is
raeli peace treaty less than a week before the sched
uled withdrawal deadline.
The evacuations were accomplished without vi
olent confrontation or bloodshed, army officials said,
but they were conducted out of sight of journalists,
who were sharply restricted in their movements.
Security forces continued to pour into the Sinai by
the hundreds from staging areas along the border as
an almost unbroken stream of flatbed trucks hauling
prefabricated houses and bomb shelters flowed
northward in a frenetic race against time before yes
terday's turnover. Several thousand troops are be
lieved to be involved in the operation.
As the round-the-clock evacuation and dismantl
ing process progressed, Prime Minister Menachem
Begin met with senior Egyptian officials in an effort to
resolve outstanding disputes in the peace treaty, in
cluding demarcation line disagreements and conflict
ing views on post-withdrawal relations. But both sides
sought to minimize the tensions that created an at
mosphere of crisis between the two countries in the
past two weeks.
As he finished an evening meeting with Begin and
prepared to return to Cairo, Egyptian Foreign Min
ister Kamal Hassan Ali told reporters that "new ideas
emerged to bridge the gap," but that no conclusive
agreement was reached.
"The next few days will witness, we hope, the happy
ending to these contacts," Ali said. He said he was
"fully confident" that Israel will complete its Sinai
withdrawal on time.

Argentina to invoke treaty
Buenos Aires, Argentina — Argentina announced yesterday that it
would seek to invoke an inter-American defense treaty against Britain, a
step that has been strongly opposed by the United States.
Argentine Foreign Minister Nicanor Costa Mendez, the principal Ar
gentine representative in four straight days of talks with Haig, said last
night that Argentina would move to invoke the Rio Treaty of 1947 in the
Organization of American States. Argentina is expected to take the ac
tion at a special OAS meeting today in Washington.
Costa Mendez coupled his announcement on the planned invoking
of the mutual assistance agreement with a statement that Argentina's
latest proposal for a settlement of the crisis "foresaw the possibility of a
limited time" during which the competing claims of Argentina and Brit
ain over the South Atlantic islands could be negotiated. The minister
added, however, that Argentina's position on the crucial issue of the
"full and certain recognition of (its) sovereignty" over the islands had
not changed and would not change.
Haig was reported by Argentine officials to have carried a "working
document" containing new Argentine proposals when he left yesterday
afternoon for Washington. Argentine press reports yesterday morning
said Buenos Aires had made important new concessions in its bargain
ing position.
The Argentine initiative invoking the Rio Treaty focuses on Article 6,
which binds the United States and 21 other American nations to mutual
action in the event of "any fact or situation that might endanger the
peace of America." The treaty specifies that the threat does not have to
be an armed attack.
(In Washington, State Department officials said they would have no
comment on Argentina's plan to invoke the treaty. The United States
was expected to express its position at the OAS meeting.)
Haig, who met for more than 25 hours with Argentine officials begin
ning last Friday, has repeatedly urged Argentina not to seek to use the
treaty against Britain. He publicly warned that "there are a number of
complications" that made use of the treaty inappropriate.

Haig, who met for more than 25 hours with Argentine officials begin
ning last Friday, has repeatedly urged Argentina not to seek to use the

The Argentine announcement on the treaty came
after Haig said in a departing statement here that
"time is indeed running out" for a peaceful solution
to the 17-day-old confrontation between Argentina
and Britain over the Falklands, which Argentina in
vaded April 2.
Haig said that the talks had led to a "further identi
fication and refinement of the Argentine position."
Air Force Commander and junta member Basilio
Lami Dozo said that "we are closer to peace than war"
with Britain, whose war fleet is slowly approaching
the South Atlantic archipelago.
But the statements of both Costa Mendez and Haig
indicated that the crisis was still not certain of a peace
ful solution.
Haig, in a formal statement at Buenos Aires' Ezeiza
Airport, said he was "more convinced than ever that
war in the South Atlantic would be the greatest of
tragedies and that time indeed is running out."
Britain opposes Argentine offer
London — Without rejecting them, the British gov
ernment said yesterday that new Argentine proposals
made to Secretary of State Alexander Haig for a settle
ment of the Falkland Islands crisis appeared to fall
short of what would be acceptable to Parliament
here.
In a statement shortly before midnight near the end
of an emergency meeting of senior government of
ficials, a spokesman for Prime Minister Margaret
Thatcher said the proposals "are complex and dif
ficult, and at first sight they do not meet the require
ments strongly expressed by Parliament, particularly
on the need to regard as paramount the wishes of the
Falkland Islanders.
"We shall study them carefully, however," the
spokesman said, "and shall be getting in touch again
with Haig."
Thatcher received the proposals, which British
sources described as "very different" from Argen
tina's earlier negotiating position, in a message from
Haig at about 9 p.m. London time, just as he was leav
ing Buenos Aires for Washington. British officials said
they did not know if Haig would later return to Lon
don, a decision that appears to hinge on the initial re
sponse he receives from Thatcher.
During yesterday's meeting with senior civilian and
military aides, Thatcher discussed what answer to give
Haig and what recommendations to make to a special
Cabinet meeting today. Cecil Parkinson, chairman of
Thatcher's Conservative Party, joined the meeting to
advise her on the likely reaction of Conservative
members of Parliament.
Many of them have warned that it could be politi
cally disastrous for Thatcher to agree to joint adminis
tration of the Falklands with Argentina under the flags
of both countries following a withdrawal of Argentine
forces from the islands, as the Argentine military gov
ernment has reportedly proposed. There also ap
peared to be no mechanism in the reported Argen
tine proposals for involvement of the Falklands' 1,800
English-speaking residents in U.N.-supervised nego

tiation of the future sovereignty and administration of
the islands.
Earlier during Haig's shuttle diplomacy, Thatcher's
government considered sharing interim adminis
tration of the Falklands with the United States or an
international body. But Argentine participation in any
such administration has been opposed by many
members of Parliament. Thatcher also has insisted,
with strong parliamentary support, that any nego
tiated settlement on the Falklands' long-term future
be acceptable to the islands' residents.
Israelis evict Sinai settlers
Rafah, Sinai — Israeli army troops forcibly evicted
militant Jewish settlers from three agricultural settle
ments in the northern Sinai Peninsula yesterday and
swiftly moved reinforcements into position on the
Mediterranean coastal town of Yamit for a showdown
with more than 2,000 opponents of the Egyptian-Is
raeli peace treaty less than a week before the sched
uled withdrawal deadline.
The evacuations were accomplished without vi
olent confrontation or bloodshed, army officials said,
but they were conducted out of sight of journalists,
who were sharply restricted in their movements.
Security forces continued to pour into the Sinai by
the hundreds from staging areas along the border as
an almost unbroken stream of flatbed trucks hauling
prefabricated houses and bomb shelters flowed
northward in a frenetic race against time before yes
terday's turnover. Several thousand troops are be
lieved to be involved in the operation.
As the round-the-clock evacuation and dismantl
ing process progressed, Prime Minister Menachem
Begin met with senior Egyptian officials in an effort to
resolve outstanding disputes in the peace treaty, in
cluding demarcation line disagreements and conflict
ing views on post-withdrawal relations. But both sides
sought to minimize the tensions that created an at
mosphere of crisis between the two countries in the
past two weeks.
As he finished an evening meeting with Begin and
prepared to return to Cairo, Egyptian Foreign Min
ister Kamal Hassan Ali told reporters that "new ideas
emerged to bridge the gap," but that no conclusive
agreement was reached.
"The next few days will witness, we hope, the happy
ending to these contacts," Ali said. He said he was
"fully confident" that Israel will complete its Sinai
withdrawal on time.
Court to decide race case
Washington — The Supreme Court served notice
yesterday that it will decide whether private schools
that discriminate against raciai minorities are entitled
to tax-exempt status, despite the Reagan adminis
tration's shift in position on the issue.
The justices selected William Coleman, the black
Republican lawyer who served as President Ford's
secretary of transportation, to defend the Internal
Revenue Service's denial of tax exemptions to these
schools. His appointment was required because the
Reagan administration decided not to defend the

longstanding IRS policy on tax exemptions.
The case will not be heard at the Supreme Court un
til next fall or winter. When it is, Coleman will be
pitted against lawyers for Bob Jones University in
Greenville, S.C., the Goldsboro Christian Schools in
Goldsboro, N.C., and the Reagan administration, all
of whom will argue that the IRS had no authority to
deny tax-exempt status to the schools.
Black students were barred from enrolling at Bob
Jones University until 1971. Since then, they have
been admitted, but the university has a strict rule
against interracial dating or marriage. The Goldsboro
Christian schools, which run from kindergarten
through high school, do not admit blacks.
Since 1970, under a policy first approved by Presi
dent Nixon, the IRS has refused tax exemptions to
private schools that discriminate racially. Citing that
policy, IRS officials originally denied tax-exempt sta
tus both to Bob Jones and to the Goldsboro schools.
When those institutions went to court to seek tax
exempt status, the Department of Justice at first suc
cessfully defended the IRS policy. In 1980, the U.S.
Fourth Circuit Court of Appeals in Richmond, Va.,
upheld the IRS ruling that Bob Jones and Goldsboro
were not entitled to tax breaks.
But after the Supreme Court agreed to take up the
case, the Reagan administration did a sudden turn
about. On Jan. 8, just as Department of Justice officials
were about to file a legal brief supporting the denial
of tax exemptions, Department of the Treasury of
ficials announced they had decided that Bob Jones
and Goldsboro deserved tax-exempt status.
That action touched off the most serious civil rights
controversy the Reagan administration has encoun
tered. President Reagan later explained that he did
not believe the executive branch of the federal gov
ernment should have cut off tax exemptions to the
schools without the approval of Congress.
Reagan promotes black
Washington — President Reagan announced the
promotion of his highest-ranking black aide yester
day and the appointment of another black to the pres
idential staff to handle trade policy as part of a wider
effort to improve the White House's relations with
black Americans.
In announcing the personnel actions, deputy press
secretary Larry Speakes said the administration is also
contemplating other appointments and methods "to
strengthen the administration's outreach efforts
among minorities and the disadvantaged."
Elevation of Melvin Bradley, 44, from senior consul
tant to special assistant to the president was designed
to "place a key black White House staff member in
the mainstream of administration policy develop
ment" and to give him reponsibility for continuously
monitoring the impact of all administration policies
"on minorities and the disadvantaged," Speakes said.
Yesterday's appointment of Wendell Wilkie Gunn,
a conservative black Republican who is currently as
sistant treasurer for PepsiCo Inc., to be a special assis
tant to thfe president handling commerce and trade is
sues, will bring the number of black presidential aides
to six.

Reagan won office with less than 15 perc

Cuts in defense possible
Washington — President Reagan's budget ren
for defense could be reduced safely by $32 billirmT
year to bring an $11.1 billion cut in actual spendin
the author of major Pentagon policy papers throut
Democratic and Republican administrations said v
terday.
William Kaufmann, a high-level consultant to<k
fense secretaries from Robert McNamara to Harold
Brown over the last two decades, makes that are
ment in the new study, "Setting National Priorities'
published by the Brookings Institution.
Kaufmann's detailed recommendations pass f res [,
ammunition to those in Congress already takingshots
at Reagan's request for a peacetime record of$2SJ
billion for defense in fiscal 1983. The Senate is e *.
pected to take the first of several congressional votes
on that request next week.
Kaufmann said he favors spending more than in the
past to strengthen the nation's defenses but con
tended at a press luncheon at Brookings that the Rea.
gan administration has gone overboard in its money
requests.
Rather than go along with Reagan's request for an
nual spending increases of 8 percent for defense for
the next five years, Kaufmann said, the nation would
be better served by limiting the yearly increases t06.5
percent and getting more bang for its bucks.

Many of them have warned that it could be politi
cally disastrous for Thatcher to agree to joint adminis
tration of the Falklands with Argentina under the flags
of both countries following a withdrawal of Argentine
forces from the islands, as the Argentine military gov
ernment has reportedly proposed. There also ap
peared to be no mechanism in the reported Argen
tine proposals for involvement of the Falklands' 1,800
English-speaking residents in U.N.-supervised nego

tiation of the future sovereignty and administration of
the islands.
Earlier during Haig's shuttle diplomacy, Thatcher's
government considered sharing interim adminis
tration of the Falklands with the United States or an
international body. But Argentine participation in any
such administration has been opposed by many
members of Parliament. Thatcher also has insisted,
with strong parliamentary support, that any nego
tiated settlement on the Falklands' long-term future
be acceptable to the islands' residents.
Israelis evict Sinai settlers
Rafah, Sinai — Israeli army troops forcibly evicted
militant Jewish settlers from three agricultural settle
ments in the northern Sinai Peninsula yesterday and
swiftly moved reinforcements into position on the
Mediterranean coastal town of Yamit for a showdown
with more than 2,000 opponents of the Egyptian-Is
raeli peace treaty less than a week before the sched
uled withdrawal deadline.
The evacuations were accomplished without vi
olent confrontation or bloodshed, army officials said,
but they were conducted out of sight of journalists,
who were sharply restricted in their movements.
Security forces continued to pour into the Sinai by
the hundreds from staging areas along the border as
an almost unbroken stream of flatbed trucks hauling
prefabricated houses and bomb shelters flowed
northward in a frenetic race against time before yes
terday's turnover. Several thousand troops are be
lieved to be involved in the operation.
As the round-the-clock evacuation and dismantl
ing process progressed, Prime Minister Menachem
Begin met with senior Egyptian officials in an effort to
resolve outstanding disputes in the peace treaty, in
cluding demarcation line disagreements and conflict
ing views on post-withdrawal relations. But both sides
sought to minimize the tensions that created an at
mosphere of crisis between the two countries in the
past two weeks.
As he finished an evening meeting with Begin and
prepared to return to Cairo, Egyptian Foreign Min
ister Kamal Hassan Ali told reporters that "new ideas
emerged to bridge the gap," but that no conclusive
agreement was reached.
"The next few days will witness, we hope, the happy
ending to these contacts," Ali said. He said he was
"fully confident" that Israel will complete its Sinai
withdrawal on time.
Court to decide race case
Washington — The Supreme Court served notice
yesterday that it will decide whether private schools
that discriminate against raciai minorities are entitled
to tax-exempt status, despite the Reagan adminis
tration's shift in position on the issue.
The justices selected William Coleman, the black
Republican lawyer who served as President Ford's
secretary of transportation, to defend the Internal
Revenue Service's denial of tax exemptions to these
schools. His appointment was required because the
Reagan administration decided not to defend the

longstanding IRS policy on tax exemptions.
The case will not be heard at the Supreme Court un
til next fall or winter. When it is, Coleman will be
pitted against lawyers for Bob Jones University in
Greenville, S.C., the Goldsboro Christian Schools in
Goldsboro, N.C., and the Reagan administration, all
of whom will argue that the IRS had no authority to
deny tax-exempt status to the schools.
Black students were barred from enrolling at Bob
Jones University until 1971. Since then, they have
been admitted, but the university has a strict rule
against interracial dating or marriage. The Goldsboro
Christian schools, which run from kindergarten
through high school, do not admit blacks.
Since 1970, under a policy first approved by Presi
dent Nixon, the IRS has refused tax exemptions to
private schools that discriminate racially. Citing that
policy, IRS officials originally denied tax-exempt sta
tus both to Bob Jones and to the Goldsboro schools.
When those institutions went to court to seek tax
exempt status, the Department of Justice at first suc
cessfully defended the IRS policy. In 1980, the U.S.
Fourth Circuit Court of Appeals in Richmond, Va.,
upheld the IRS ruling that Bob Jones and Goldsboro
were not entitled to tax breaks.
But after the Supreme Court agreed to take up the
case, the Reagan administration did a sudden turn
about. On Jan. 8, just as Department of Justice officials
were about to file a legal brief supporting the denial
of tax exemptions, Department of the Treasury of
ficials announced they had decided that Bob Jones
and Goldsboro deserved tax-exempt status.
That action touched off the most serious civil rights
controversy the Reagan administration has encoun
tered. President Reagan later explained that he did
not believe the executive branch of the federal gov
ernment should have cut off tax exemptions to the
schools without the approval of Congress.
Reagan promotes black
Washington — President Reagan announced the
promotion of his highest-ranking black aide yester
day and the appointment of another black to the pres
idential staff to handle trade policy as part of a wider
effort to improve the White House's relations with
black Americans.
In announcing the personnel actions, deputy press
secretary Larry Speakes said the administration is also
contemplating other appointments and methods "to
strengthen the administration's outreach efforts
among minorities and the disadvantaged."
Elevation of Melvin Bradley, 44, from senior consul
tant to special assistant to the president was designed
to "place a key black White House staff member in
the mainstream of administration policy develop
ment" and to give him reponsibility for continuously
monitoring the impact of all administration policies
"on minorities and the disadvantaged," Speakes said.
Yesterday's appointment of Wendell Wilkie Gunn,
a conservative black Republican who is currently as
sistant treasurer for PepsiCo Inc., to be a special assis
tant to thfe president handling commerce and trade is
sues, will bring the number of black presidential aides
to six.

Cuts in defense possible
Washington — President Reagan's budget ren
for defense could be reduced safely by $32 billirmT
year to bring an $11.1 billion cut in actual spendin
the author of major Pentagon policy papers throut
Democratic and Republican administrations said v
terday.
William Kaufmann, a high-level consultant to<k
fense secretaries from Robert McNamara to Harold
Brown over the last two decades, makes that are
ment in the new study, "Setting National Priorities'
published by the Brookings Institution.
Kaufmann's detailed recommendations pass f res [,
ammunition to those in Congress already takingshots
at Reagan's request for a peacetime record of$2SJ
billion for defense in fiscal 1983. The Senate is e *.
pected to take the first of several congressional votes
on that request next week.
Kaufmann said he favors spending more than in the
past to strengthen the nation's defenses but con
tended at a press luncheon at Brookings that the Rea.
gan administration has gone overboard in its money
requests.
Rather than go along with Reagan's request for an
nual spending increases of 8 percent for defense for
the next five years, Kaufmann said, the nation would
be better served by limiting the yearly increases t06.5
percent and getting more bang for its bucks.
