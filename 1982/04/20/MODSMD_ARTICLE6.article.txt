# Hearing may allow political asylum for El Salvadorans
## 
### Stephen Williams 
A deportation hearing which will influence the politi
cal asylum requests of thousands of El Salvadoran refu
gees is now taking place in San Francisco.
Luis Escobar, 21, of San Francisco, and Luis Trujillo, 28,
of Odkland, contend that they will be killed if deported.
Lawyers from the National Lawyers Guild are arguing
before judge Brian Simpson that, as young males, the de
fendants face certain persecution if they return to El
Salvador.
In a press release dated April 5, Defense attorney Mark
Van der Hout said, "From a purely legal perspective,
these cases present some of the strongest political asy
lum claims that the Immigration and Naturalization Ser
vice (INS) has faced."
Van der Hout, along with Patty Blum, is trying to estab
lish that young males, roughly between the ages of 12
and 28, form a "valid social group" that is subject to sys
tematic torture and death at the hands of Salvadoran
government security forces. As members of this "social
group," the defendants would not have to prove that
they have personally been threatened with persecution.
INS laws and United Nations protocol indicate that po
litical asylum must be granted to persons who establish a
well-founded fear that their life or liberty would be
threatened if they returned to their home country. If the
defense establishes that young males make up a per
secuted "social group," the political asylum requests of
thousands of male Salvadorans would be strengthened.
The government, represented by Beverly Philips, is
trying to limit testimony in the trial to that which directly
relates to Trujillo and Escobar, in an attempt to avoid es
tablishing a broad "social group."
Philips maintains that Trujillo and Escobar cannot be
granted political asylum unless specific proof is present
ed that they will be harmed if they return to El Salvador.
Only eight Salvadorans have been granted political
asylum by the United States out of the more than 7000
that have applied since 1979. The INS repeatedly con
tends that most Salvadorans who enter this country il
legally are seeking improved economic conditions, and
are not fleeing political violence.
The defense is attempting to prove that because other
young males in El Salvador have been the victims of polit
ical violence, Irujillo and Escobar have every reason to
fear deportation.
Rene Guerre y Guerre, who engineered the 1979 coup
that overthrew the government of General Humberto

Romero, took the stand for the defense Friday. Guerre y
Guerre, in exile since June, 1980, served with General
Jose Guillermo Garcia in the first civilian/military junta in
1979. Garcia is currently the minister of defense, and is
believed by many close to the situation to be in charge of
the government, though the Salvadoran constitution
stipulates that the president is the commander-in-chief
of the armed forces. Garcia was a member of the right
wing party ORDEN, which was banned during the 1979
coup but was re-established under the name ARENA.
The party is the pivotal power in the right-wing coalition
which emerged victorious from the March general elec
tion.
Guerre y Guerre served with Garcia and ARENA mem
ber Roberta D'Aubuisson in the presidential palace prior
to the overthrow of General Romero in 1979.
D'Aubuisson, who former United States ambassador to
El Salvador Robert White labelled a "pathological killer,"
is an important player, along with Garcia, in the current
political struggle.
Guerre y Guerre detailed a conversation he overheard
in 1979 between Garcia and D'Aubuisson. "They said
that if El Salvador could stand 30,000 dead following the
civil war in 1932, it can stand 200,000 or 300,000 dead now
because the country is bigger."
When asked if the defendants faced increased per
secution if they return to El Salvador while Garcia is in
control, Guerre y Guerre replied, "The defendents are
young, and would be prime suspects because they are
not in the army. They would certainly be killed by the se
curity forces. Most of what is said in the press about
death squads is true. The young men are killed like flies,
tortured with knives and acid."
Defendent Trujillo was visibly shaken when it was an
nounced at the trial Friday afternoon that Antonio
Rodriguez Porth of ARENA had been named interim
president of El Salvador, ousting Napolean Duarte.
Guerre y Guerre characterized Porth as violent, and
said ARENA-supported death squads would be given
more license to kill under Porth's rule.
"The government is going backwards," said Guerre y
Guerre. "There will be a black future for El Salvador."
The defense attorneys believe that they must establish
a very strong case if it is to survive what they forsee as nu
merous appeals. They plan to ask for a continuance on
the hearing when it ends this Friday. Blum does not ex
pect a final decision on the defendants' political asylum
requests for several months.
