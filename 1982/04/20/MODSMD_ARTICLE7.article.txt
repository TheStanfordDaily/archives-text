## Psychological effects of nuclear war discussed at lecture series 
### Jiri Weiss 
Referring to the absurdity of the nuclear arms
race, Dr. Robert Lifton told the Fairchild
Auditorium audience Saturday night that ev
eryone, including psychologists, had to recognize
and strive to reduce current nuclear dangers.
The arms race is a "social and collective madness
around some shared assumptions, shared illusions
and shared technology of a lethal kind," said Lif
ton, adding, "That kind of illusion has to be dis
pelled by everybody including the people in the
psychological professions."
Lifton, a professor of psychiatry at the Yale Uni
versity School of Medicine, spoke at the first of two
discussions in a series entitled "The Psychological
Causes and Effects of the Nuclear Arms Race."
Speakers touched on a number of issues ranging

from the possibility of reducing tensions between
the United States and the Soviet Union to the de
nial of death. But if there was an overall theme it
was the absurdity of the nuclear arms race.
There are three layers of absurdity in the nuclear
build up, Lifton said. On the first level there is the
"structural absurdity of the two great superpowers
poised to destroy each other and the world in the
bargain."
The second level is the "existential absurdity"
that we could be "annihilated at any moment
along with the things we love or have touched, and
yet we go on with business as usual."
Finally, he said, there is the absurdity in our rela
tionship with the reality of nuclear weapons.
"What is this nuclear war we talk about? . . . We
have difficulty doing what Martin Buber called im
agining the real. Imagining the real, imagining

what confronts us, is our central task." It is here,
Lifton said, that psychologists and physicians have
a responsibility.
The psychological profession has particular re
sponsibility to shatter the "paranoid illusions" our
society has built around the procurement of nu
clear weapons and strategies to use them, Lifton
said. These illusions "must be precisely and rigor
ously exposed."
The biggest illusion is one of control. Lifton
argued that while nuclear weapons are uncon
trollable and there are no limits to their destructive
capability, "those in positionsof leadershipcannot
accept that because they see their job as controll
ing their use." Out of this way of thinking emerge
the absurd scenarios of limited nuclear war, Lifton
continued.
