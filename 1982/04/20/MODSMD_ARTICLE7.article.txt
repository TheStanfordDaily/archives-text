## Psychological effects of nuclear war discussed at lecture series 
### Jiri Weiss 
Referring to the absurdity of the nuclear arms
race, Dr. Robert Lifton told the Fairchild
Auditorium audience Saturday night that ev
eryone, including psychologists, had to recognize
and strive to reduce current nuclear dangers.
The arms race is a "social and collective madness
around some shared assumptions, shared illusions
and shared technology of a lethal kind," said Lif
ton, adding, "That kind of illusion has to be dis
pelled by everybody including the people in the
psychological professions."
Lifton, a professor of psychiatry at the Yale Uni
versity School of Medicine, spoke at the first of two
discussions in a series entitled "The Psychological
Causes and Effects of the Nuclear Arms Race."
Speakers touched on a number of issues ranging

from the possibility of reducing tensions between
the United States and the Soviet Union to the de
nial of death. But if there was an overall theme it
was the absurdity of the nuclear arms race.
There are three layers of absurdity in the nuclear
build up, Lifton said. On the first level there is the
"structural absurdity of the two great superpowers
poised to destroy each other and the world in the
bargain."
The second level is the "existential absurdity"
that we could be "annihilated at any moment
along with the things we love or have touched, and
yet we go on with business as usual."
Finally, he said, there is the absurdity in our rela
tionship with the reality of nuclear weapons.
"What is this nuclear war we talk about? . . . We
have difficulty doing what Martin Buber called im
agining the real. Imagining the real, imagining

what confronts us, is our central task." It is here,
Lifton said, that psychologists and physicians have
a responsibility.
The psychological profession has particular re
sponsibility to shatter the "paranoid illusions" our
society has built around the procurement of nu
clear weapons and strategies to use them, Lifton
said. These illusions "must be precisely and rigor
ously exposed."
The biggest illusion is one of control. Lifton
argued that while nuclear weapons are uncon
trollable and there are no limits to their destructive
capability, "those in positionsof leadershipcannot
accept that because they see their job as controll
ing their use." Out of this way of thinking emerge
the absurd scenarios of limited nuclear war, Lifton
continued.
Other such "paranoid" il
lusions include the illusion that
we can prepare for and protect
ourselves from nuclear war,
the illusion that there will be
stoic survivors who will help
each other, as well as the il
lusion of recovery from a nu
clear war, according to Lifton.
"What is it now," Lifton
asked rhetorically while speak
ing about current civil defense
plans for evacuation, "the odd
license plates drive out first?
... or, equally practical, there
are now, with wonderful fore
sight, arrangements being
made for address-forwarding
structures in case there is a nu
clear war."
The whole civil defense
structure is absurd, Lifton
argued. He said shelters, for ex
ample, "are quite wonderful
except for three little problems
— getting into them, staying in
them and getting out of them."
Recovery is another "il
lusion" Lifton wants to expose.
"The message in the doctors'

movement is very simple:
don't count on us to patch you
together this time around," Lif
ton said. "If there are any sur
vivors, none of them wiil be in
any mood for healing."
Together with a colleague,
Lifton recently published a
projection of psychological be
havior of survivors of a nuclear
war in the New York Times. Lif
ton drew from the Hiroshima
exprience as well as natural dis
aster literature.
"We carefully examined the
Hiroshima experience where
the pattern is not one of panic
but of slow motion, of extreme
numbing and diminished ac
tivity," he said.
Lifton hasconcluded thatthe
survivors of nuclear war will ex
perience "a numbing that will
be so extreme as to be a shut
ting down of the mind, im
mobilization on the part of
most survivors."
Lifton said that the danger of
nuclear war is perhaps greater
than it has ever been, but that
this has had positive results:
there has been a breakdown of
"psychological numbing" —
the refusal to admit the danger
of the issue on the part of most

people. This has come about,
according to Lifton, through
healthy skepticism toward the
government. But there is a dan
ger that the refusal to admit the
danger has been replaced by
fear.
"The fear of nuclear war is
widespread," Lifton said. The
danger here is that fear can
lead to resignation or cynicism,
"the attitude of waiting for the
bomb," which Lifton says is a
major reaction.
"The key shift to make is to
move from that attitude into an
attitude of individual responsi
bilty," he continued.

George Washington Univer

Auditorium audience Saturday night that ev
eryone, including psychologists, had to recognize
and strive to reduce current nuclear dangers.
The arms race is a "social and collective madness
around some shared assumptions, shared illusions
and shared technology of a lethal kind," said Lif
ton, adding, "That kind of illusion has to be dis
pelled by everybody including the people in the
psychological professions."
Lifton, a professor of psychiatry at the Yale Uni
versity School of Medicine, spoke at the first of two
discussions in a series entitled "The Psychological
Causes and Effects of the Nuclear Arms Race."
Speakers touched on a number of issues ranging

from the possibility of reducing tensions between
the United States and the Soviet Union to the de
nial of death. But if there was an overall theme it
was the absurdity of the nuclear arms race.
There are three layers of absurdity in the nuclear
build up, Lifton said. On the first level there is the
"structural absurdity of the two great superpowers
poised to destroy each other and the world in the
bargain."
The second level is the "existential absurdity"
that we could be "annihilated at any moment
along with the things we love or have touched, and
yet we go on with business as usual."
Finally, he said, there is the absurdity in our rela
tionship with the reality of nuclear weapons.
"What is this nuclear war we talk about? . . . We
have difficulty doing what Martin Buber called im
agining the real. Imagining the real, imagining

what confronts us, is our central task." It is here,
Lifton said, that psychologists and physicians have
a responsibility.
The psychological profession has particular re
sponsibility to shatter the "paranoid illusions" our
society has built around the procurement of nu
clear weapons and strategies to use them, Lifton
said. These illusions "must be precisely and rigor
ously exposed."
The biggest illusion is one of control. Lifton
argued that while nuclear weapons are uncon
trollable and there are no limits to their destructive
capability, "those in positionsof leadershipcannot
accept that because they see their job as controll
ing their use." Out of this way of thinking emerge
the absurd scenarios of limited nuclear war, Lifton
continued.
Other such "paranoid" il
lusions include the illusion that
we can prepare for and protect
ourselves from nuclear war,
the illusion that there will be
stoic survivors who will help
each other, as well as the il
lusion of recovery from a nu
clear war, according to Lifton.
"What is it now," Lifton
asked rhetorically while speak
ing about current civil defense
plans for evacuation, "the odd
license plates drive out first?
... or, equally practical, there
are now, with wonderful fore
sight, arrangements being
made for address-forwarding
structures in case there is a nu
clear war."
The whole civil defense
structure is absurd, Lifton
argued. He said shelters, for ex
ample, "are quite wonderful
except for three little problems
— getting into them, staying in
them and getting out of them."
Recovery is another "il
lusion" Lifton wants to expose.
"The message in the doctors'

movement is very simple:
don't count on us to patch you
together this time around," Lif
ton said. "If there are any sur
vivors, none of them wiil be in
any mood for healing."
Together with a colleague,
Lifton recently published a
projection of psychological be
havior of survivors of a nuclear
war in the New York Times. Lif
ton drew from the Hiroshima
exprience as well as natural dis
aster literature.
"We carefully examined the
Hiroshima experience where
the pattern is not one of panic
but of slow motion, of extreme
numbing and diminished ac
tivity," he said.
Lifton hasconcluded thatthe
survivors of nuclear war will ex
perience "a numbing that will
be so extreme as to be a shut
ting down of the mind, im
mobilization on the part of
most survivors."
Lifton said that the danger of
nuclear war is perhaps greater
than it has ever been, but that
this has had positive results:
there has been a breakdown of
"psychological numbing" —
the refusal to admit the danger
of the issue on the part of most

people. This has come about,
according to Lifton, through
healthy skepticism toward the
government. But there is a dan
ger that the refusal to admit the
danger has been replaced by
fear.
"The fear of nuclear war is
widespread," Lifton said. The
danger here is that fear can
lead to resignation or cynicism,
"the attitude of waiting for the
bomb," which Lifton says is a
major reaction.
"The key shift to make is to
move from that attitude into an
attitude of individual responsi
bilty," he continued.
Other speakers Saturday
evening included Ralph White,
professor of psychology at
George Washington Univer
sity, Robert Fulton, professor
of sociology at the University of
Minnesota and Thomas Gon
da, chairman of the Depart
ment of Psychiatry here.
The evening was organized
by the Stanford Arms Control
and Disarmament Forum, a
group composed of students,
faculty and other members of
the University community ded
icated to promoting debate on
the arms race.
