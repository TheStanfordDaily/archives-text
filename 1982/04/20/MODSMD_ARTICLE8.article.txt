## Complexities of photosynthesis being unraveled 
### Julie Kiser 
A Stanford biophysical chemist points to trees
languishing in the sun and says,"The question isn't if it
works — just how." Steven Boxer, assistant professor of
chemistry, has tackled the problem of photosynthesis:
how some organisms, mostly plants, directly use sun
light's energy to produce energy of their own.
Boxer began the project four years ago, trying to build
a synthetic replacement for the natural process. Having
some idea of the separate components, he tried to as
semble them into a mechanism. None of his analogies
worked as well as the real thing.
Photosynthetic 'bugs'
Boxer opted to study the real thing. His object of study
is a photosynthetic bacterium. Remarkably, the bacteria
are blue, not green, so that they can absorb light passing
through the green algae beneath which they live.
The membranes of these bacteria contain "reaction
centers," groups of chlorophyll molecules and proteins.
Other chlorophyll molecules located throughout the
membrane funnel light into the reaction centers. Each
center receives input from upto 100 of these "antenna"
chlorophylls.
At these centers, the initial chemical reactions of
photosynthesis occur. Boxer's interest is the first part of
the process. He chose this focus because these first reac
tions extract the energy from light received. The rest of
the process is the cell's storage and usage of that energy.
An electron 'pump'
The reaction center separates electric charge, much
like charging a capacitor or pumping water into a tower.
When light enters a chlorophyll molecule in the reac

tion center, the extra energy causes electrons to move
away from it to another chlorophyll, nearer the inside of
the membrane. A chain of around six molecules passes
electrons across the membrane, "something like a buck
et brigade," according to Boxer.
"What's impressive is that the reaction between the
first donor and the first acceptor is unbelievably fast."
This split-second pumping of electrons to the inside and
then slow passage back to the outside is the cell's way of
making electrons give up storable energy.
When the electrons go back through the membrane,
they work much like water flowing from the tower,
down to drive a waterwheel. The cell is equipped to store
the energy the electrons expend in transit.
Boxer's two big questions involved the structure of the
reaction center and the mechanism of its job. Boxer and
his co-workers, Mark Roelofs and Chris Chidsey, dis
covered that the photosynthesis reactions can be strong
ly influenced by external magnetic fields.
A new technique
This influence is explained by the fact that in chemical
reactions, electrons tend to pair off. Because electrons
have a magnetic nature, single, unpaired electrons in
teract with magnetic fields.
When unpaired electrons occur, as they do during
photosynthesis, their behavior can be altered by placing
magnetic fields external to the molecule. This new tech
nique proved useful for examining how photosynthesis
transports electrons.
Boxer learned about the different chlorophyll species
involved and about the interactions among chlorophylls
and their protein framework. He analyzed the

molecules' structure, distances between them, their
positions relative to each other, and energy transfers
among them.
Boxer's research took an interesting direction when
he invented another new technique for studying the
structure of chlorophyll itself. Because the electron
pumping reaction is a "solid *tate" process — no
molecules move around to pass the charge — Boxer rea
soned that the structure could help explain the reaction.
However, crystals of the molecules are needed for
viewing the structure, and crystals are not yet available.
Boxer thought to remove the chlorophylls from their
protein matrix and place them into an already under
stood framework.
He chose to use the skeletons of the heme proteins,
because heme's structure is similar to that of chlorophyll.
The frameworks of the proteins hemoglobin and
myoglobin hold heme, which carries oxygen in the
blood and muscles in mammals.
Boxer replaced the heme in myoglobin with
chlorophyll — "took the red thing out and put a green
thing in." He called these colorful (green) new
molecules chloroglobins. The chloroglobins could be
crystallized and the chlorophylls viewed.
He has taken pictures of these proteins' crystals, green
six-sided lozenges. The crystals provide arrays of
chlorophylls, "like letters in mailboxes, very nicely lined
"up." With the chloroglobins, Boxer assessed how nearly
proteins affect the properties of chlorophylls.
'Christmas proteins'
Boxer's focus shifted to the problem of how energy is
transferred from chlorophyll to chlorophyll. Putting

chlorophylls into hemoglobin, which can hold up to fodr
chlorophylls compared to myoglobin's one, Boxer
looked at the transfer of energy among chlorophylls.
Hemoglobin proteins have also been prepared with
both red heme and green chlorophyll. Graduatestudent
Atsuo Kuki, who works with Boxer, named these "Christ
mas proteins." Understanding the interactions in these
proteins play a key role in understand photosynthesis. •
Christmas proteins are a classic example of a synthetic
model occurring when two things are put together in a
fashion never before imagined. Illustrating this incon
gruity, Boxer pointed out that sperm whales (the primary
source of myoglobin) cannot perform photosynthesis
"and will never grow on trees."
What's next
Boxer's next task is "to finish knowing what we know"
by developing actual models of chlorophyll and the re
action centers. He stressed that his emphasis is not on
commercial applications but on basic science, develop
ing new methods to answer questions and interpreting
the answers.
The commercial application of a mechanism similar to
photosynthesis is already evident in solar cells, particu
larly photovoltaic devices. Photovoltaics employ the ex
act principle of charge separation that the reaction cen
ters use.
Perhaps genetic manipulation could be used toenable
plants to store and use more of the energy they receive.
Boxer noted, "It is extremely unlikely that we can im
prove on the efficiency (of the first reactions) — it ap
proaches ideal."
