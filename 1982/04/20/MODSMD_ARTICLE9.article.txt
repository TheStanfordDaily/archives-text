# Silicon chip theft is prevalent
## 
### Laurence Band 
Tiny silicon chips, the source
of livelihood for much of the
booming electronics industry
in nearby Silicon Valley, are
also supporting what is esti
mated to be a $20 million-a
year black market.
According to Santa Clara
County Sheriff's Detective Pat
Moore, this is a "conservative
estimate" but one that has
gone unchallenged by the in
dustry as yet.
Concerning the number of
crimes committed, More said,
"There is no way to judge this
since the area covers a number
of police jurisdictions."
* Further difficulties arise in
trying to estimate the extent of

the thefts because companies
do not always report them. It is
not aiways in the best interest
of a company to inform either
stockholders or competitors
about one's loses.
These crimes are of concern
not only to local police author
ities, but on occasion also draw
the attention of the FBI which
considers these as a potential
national security risk. For ex
ample, among chips recently
stoien from Monolithic Mem
ories Inc. were two designs
used in defense systems.
There may be foreign agents
who would like to save their
countries the time and expense
of developing technology that
can easily be stolen.

With regard to who is com
mitting these crimes, Moore
said, "99 percent of the time it's
an inside job." Those frequent
ly involved are security guards
and warehouse workers and,
occassionally, executives will
be involved. The industry is
also plagued by assembly-line
chips stolen by employees.
Chips are easily fenced and
some companies have been es
tablished with the sole intent of
buying and selling the stolen
goods.
In an attempt to limit crimes
involving employees, some
companies have instituted
profit-sharing and other incen
tives for workers to remain
loyal to their employers.
