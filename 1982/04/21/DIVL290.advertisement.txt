COMPUTER AIDED DESIGN
FOR HIGH SPEED
ECL CIRCUITRY
VAX SOFTWARE TOOLS
This is an opportunity for a
strongly-motivated, self reliant individual to
play the leading role in the development of
sofware tools for the design and
manufacturing of very high performance
systems. The perfect individual will have an
excellent computer science and electrical
engineering background, experience with
VAX and Computer Vision CAD systems, and
a knowledge of Printed Circuit board and
GATE ARRAY technologies. The individual
will be defining and developing new tools in
addition to integrating and enhancing existing
tools.
Communications skills, Intelligence, Software
background and a sympathy for hardware
design are more important than area s of
specific knowledge. You should also have the
personal maturity to assume a planning and
management role.
