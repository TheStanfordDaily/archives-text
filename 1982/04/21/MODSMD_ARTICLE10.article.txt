Scream for the team
It may not add to the win columns, but at
least its something to cheer about. North
western University's athletic department
has responded to the fans' lack of interest
in university sports by hiring Jalinda Davis,
a professional choreographer from Flori-

Ron Fernandez
da, to direct the Wildcat cheerleaders for
football and basketball games next year,
the Daily Northwestern reported.
David Rosengard, NU's director of pro
motions and marketing, callecTthe move a
"whole new sense of commitment to make
them a highly reputable squad.
Cheerleaders are sort of a public relations
tool," Rosengard said. Davis' job, he said,
will be to "get these kids motivated."
The 26-year-old Davis added, "They will
dance a little bit more. The squad as a
whole will be much more talented." Davis
has done similar work for the Chicago
Horizons indoor soccer team and the Fire
Belles of the American Football Associa
tion's Chicago Fire. She has experience ob
serving and rating cheerleaders and dance
squads at other universities.
"Right now — and I don't sit up in the
stands during games — I don't think the
cheerleaders are looked up to here like
they are at other Big Ten Schools," Rosen
gard said. "I think they just have to be
pushed. The real problem has been not
having anyone professional to clean them
up."
Party for the cause
Six Eastern Illinois University students
plan to hit the bottles and beer cans, sub
ject themselves to a breathalyzer test and
face the assistant attorney for Coles County
—- all in an effort to promote responsible

m —
drinking among college students.
The Daily Eastern News reported that the
students are taking part in an experiment
to demonstrate the results of different
ways of drinking in accordance to new Illi
nois drunk driving laws.
The experiment, entitled "If You're a
Boozer, Don't Be a Loser," consists of six
people who will be divided among three
teams that will each drink different kinds of
alcohol. The first team will drink five serv
ings of beer, the second team will consume
mixed drinks and the third team will mix
the two — within the span of two hours
before the forum begins.
One person in each team will consume
normal amounts of food during the day,
while the other will eat only breakfast, in
order to demonstrate the different results
of alcohol intake.
Two police officers from the Charleston
Police Department will then conduct
breathalyzer tests on the volunteers and
explain the procedure to the audience. Af
terwards, an assistant state attorney will
then speak on the revised drunk driving
laws and answer students' questions.
Puffing patriots
More than 50 students of the Texas Uni
versity Navy ROTC unit will carry the U.S.
flag over a 344-mile relay course from Aus
tin to Harlingen and salute it as the first to
fly over the Texas Iwo Jima Memorial.
According to The Texan, the students
plan to leave from the Austin campus and
arrive at the memorial two days later, main
taining an eight-mile per hour clip.

The project started when Felix de Weld
on, who sculpted the original plaster of the
Marine Corps War Memorial in Washing
ton, donated it to the public. The
sculpture, which de Weldon completed in
1954, will be bronzed and set on a base of
heavy black marble. The Texas memorial
will be the only reproduction the size of
the original. The plaster piece's fair market
value has been appraised at $3.5 million.

The memorial will stand in front of the
Marine Military Academy — the only pre
paratory high school m the country specifi
cally geared to Marine standards and ide
als.
"Its main claim to fame is it puts more
men in the various service academies
(West Point, Annapolis, etc.) than any oth
er high school," said Maj. Chuck
Armstrong, the Texas NROTC Marine of
ficer instructor. "Another thing is that it's
maintained and operated by retired
Marines.
"Those are the more patriotic reasons
(for placing the memorial at the
academy)," continued Armstrong. "An
other is the original cast had to have a
climate dry and not so humid ... Harl
ingen's climate is dry and not so humid."
The UT unit was selected for the cross
country flag duty when Midshipman
Aaron Marks volunteered his unit to
purchase an 18-foot by 12-foot flag and de
liver it.
"We bought the flag with our own mon
ey," said Armstrong. The $350,000 to cover
the bronzing, marble, and transportation
of the plaster to Harlingen was "con
tributed solely by the Marines and sailors
and their families, friends and supporters,"
he said.
Do Not Pass G0...
If you recently received a friendly note
from the registrar's office informing you
that your grades could use some, well,
improvement, don't feel alone. The Daily
Kent Stater reports that more than 20 per
cent of Kent State's 3152 undergraduates
are currently on academic probation.
According to the student affairs 6ffice,
most of the students in academic jeopardy
are freshmen. Of the 1694 freshmen, 36.8
percent were placed on probation follow
ing fall quarter, followed by 23.3 percent of
the sophomore class, 10.9 percent of the
junior class and 5.9 percent of KSU seniors.
There is a considerable difference be
tween the percentages of males and
females on academic probation. The ratio
of uppercLss males to upperclass females
is more than two to one.
The length of time students remain on
probation has decreased, said Richard
Worthing, assistant dean of the College
and Fine Professional Arts. He said that
there is no specific period of time that a
student may stay on probation without
being dismissed.
"It tends to be an individual matter," he
said.
Worthing said he doesn't think there is

any simple answer to why there is such a
large percentage of freshmen on proba
tion, but he thinks part of the reason is dif
ficulty in making the transition from high
school to college.
"Some of the reason I find for it is that In
some subject areas the distance between
acceptable college-level performance and
acceptable high school-level performance
in the subject may be increasing," he said.
He added that, while more Kent State
students are on probation, fewer students
are being dismissed.
Soothing broken hearts
You just got a letter from your girlfriend
that began, "Dear John," and your name is
Harold. When you went to that friendly
looking woman down the hall to share
your pain, she told you she had to study for
her final in "Psych Proctoring". And to
make things worse, your pet lizard died last
night.
How do you handle it?
Well, if you were a man at Northwestern
University, you might be able to soothe the
pain through group therapy. According to
the Daily Northwestern, this spring a psy
chology doctoral candidate will conduct
group sessions for men with break-up
problems.
The program will be specifically directed
toward helping men overcome the emo
tional difficulty of breaking a serious rela
tionship.
"Men usually have a harder time than
women in recovering from a break-up,"
said Hal Rice-Erso, who will direct the
counseling program. "Men often lack the
emotional support system that women
have — close friends are not as able to
share their feelings.
"Having somebody your own gender
who is having a similar experience can be
very helpful," he said.
Rice-Erso said he got the idea for the
new program when he noticed an especial
ly large number of men coming to the cam
pus crisis center with problems connected
to losing a wife or girlfriend. "They'd say,
'I'm crying all the time,' or M can't get any
work done,' " he said.
A main objective of the program Will be
to get the men to "re-establish themselves
as social animals," Rice-Erso said. "Many
men have a hard time starting to date
again," he said.

Scream for the team
It may not add to the win columns, but at
least its something to cheer about. North
western University's athletic department
has responded to the fans' lack of interest
in university sports by hiring Jalinda Davis,
a professional choreographer from Flori-

Ron Fernandez
da, to direct the Wildcat cheerleaders for
football and basketball games next year,
the Daily Northwestern reported.
David Rosengard, NU's director of pro
motions and marketing, callecTthe move a
"whole new sense of commitment to make
them a highly reputable squad.
Cheerleaders are sort of a public relations
tool," Rosengard said. Davis' job, he said,
will be to "get these kids motivated."
The 26-year-old Davis added, "They will
dance a little bit more. The squad as a
whole will be much more talented." Davis
has done similar work for the Chicago
Horizons indoor soccer team and the Fire
Belles of the American Football Associa
tion's Chicago Fire. She has experience ob
serving and rating cheerleaders and dance
squads at other universities.
"Right now — and I don't sit up in the
stands during games — I don't think the
cheerleaders are looked up to here like
they are at other Big Ten Schools," Rosen
gard said. "I think they just have to be
pushed. The real problem has been not
having anyone professional to clean them
up."

Six Eastern Illinois University students
plan to hit the bottles and beer cans, sub
ject themselves to a breathalyzer test and
face the assistant attorney for Coles County
—- all in an effort to promote responsible

m —
drinking among college students.
The Daily Eastern News reported that the
students are taking part in an experiment
to demonstrate the results of different
ways of drinking in accordance to new Illi
nois drunk driving laws.
The experiment, entitled "If You're a
Boozer, Don't Be a Loser," consists of six
people who will be divided among three
teams that will each drink different kinds of
alcohol. The first team will drink five serv
ings of beer, the second team will consume
mixed drinks and the third team will mix
the two — within the span of two hours
before the forum begins.
One person in each team will consume
normal amounts of food during the day,
while the other will eat only breakfast, in
order to demonstrate the different results
of alcohol intake.
Two police officers from the Charleston
Police Department will then conduct
breathalyzer tests on the volunteers and
explain the procedure to the audience. Af
terwards, an assistant state attorney will
then speak on the revised drunk driving
laws and answer students' questions.

More than 50 students of the Texas Uni
versity Navy ROTC unit will carry the U.S.
flag over a 344-mile relay course from Aus
tin to Harlingen and salute it as the first to
fly over the Texas Iwo Jima Memorial.
According to The Texan, the students
plan to leave from the Austin campus and
arrive at the memorial two days later, main
taining an eight-mile per hour clip.

The project started when Felix de Weld
on, who sculpted the original plaster of the
Marine Corps War Memorial in Washing
ton, donated it to the public. The
sculpture, which de Weldon completed in
1954, will be bronzed and set on a base of
heavy black marble. The Texas memorial
will be the only reproduction the size of
the original. The plaster piece's fair market
value has been appraised at $3.5 million.

The memorial will stand in front of the
Marine Military Academy — the only pre
paratory high school m the country specifi
cally geared to Marine standards and ide
als.
"Its main claim to fame is it puts more
men in the various service academies
(West Point, Annapolis, etc.) than any oth
er high school," said Maj. Chuck
Armstrong, the Texas NROTC Marine of
ficer instructor. "Another thing is that it's
maintained and operated by retired
Marines.
"Those are the more patriotic reasons
(for placing the memorial at the
academy)," continued Armstrong. "An
other is the original cast had to have a
climate dry and not so humid ... Harl
ingen's climate is dry and not so humid."
The UT unit was selected for the cross
country flag duty when Midshipman
Aaron Marks volunteered his unit to
purchase an 18-foot by 12-foot flag and de
liver it.
"We bought the flag with our own mon
ey," said Armstrong. The $350,000 to cover
the bronzing, marble, and transportation
of the plaster to Harlingen was "con
tributed solely by the Marines and sailors
and their families, friends and supporters,"
he said.
Do Not Pass G0...
If you recently received a friendly note
from the registrar's office informing you
that your grades could use some, well,
improvement, don't feel alone. The Daily
Kent Stater reports that more than 20 per
cent of Kent State's 3152 undergraduates
are currently on academic probation.
According to the student affairs 6ffice,
most of the students in academic jeopardy
are freshmen. Of the 1694 freshmen, 36.8
percent were placed on probation follow
ing fall quarter, followed by 23.3 percent of
the sophomore class, 10.9 percent of the
junior class and 5.9 percent of KSU seniors.
There is a considerable difference be
tween the percentages of males and
females on academic probation. The ratio
of uppercLss males to upperclass females
is more than two to one.
The length of time students remain on
probation has decreased, said Richard
Worthing, assistant dean of the College
and Fine Professional Arts. He said that
there is no specific period of time that a
student may stay on probation without
being dismissed.
"It tends to be an individual matter," he
said.
Worthing said he doesn't think there is

any simple answer to why there is such a
large percentage of freshmen on proba
tion, but he thinks part of the reason is dif
ficulty in making the transition from high
school to college.
"Some of the reason I find for it is that In
some subject areas the distance between
acceptable college-level performance and
acceptable high school-level performance
in the subject may be increasing," he said.
He added that, while more Kent State
students are on probation, fewer students
are being dismissed.
Soothing broken hearts
You just got a letter from your girlfriend
that began, "Dear John," and your name is
Harold. When you went to that friendly
looking woman down the hall to share
your pain, she told you she had to study for
her final in "Psych Proctoring". And to
make things worse, your pet lizard died last
night.
How do you handle it?
Well, if you were a man at Northwestern
University, you might be able to soothe the
pain through group therapy. According to
the Daily Northwestern, this spring a psy
chology doctoral candidate will conduct
group sessions for men with break-up
problems.
The program will be specifically directed
toward helping men overcome the emo
tional difficulty of breaking a serious rela
tionship.
"Men usually have a harder time than
women in recovering from a break-up,"
said Hal Rice-Erso, who will direct the
counseling program. "Men often lack the
emotional support system that women
have — close friends are not as able to
share their feelings.
"Having somebody your own gender
who is having a similar experience can be
very helpful," he said.
Rice-Erso said he got the idea for the
new program when he noticed an especial
ly large number of men coming to the cam
pus crisis center with problems connected
to losing a wife or girlfriend. "They'd say,
'I'm crying all the time,' or M can't get any
work done,' " he said.
A main objective of the program Will be
to get the men to "re-establish themselves
as social animals," Rice-Erso said. "Many
men have a hard time starting to date
again," he said.

Scream for the team
It may not add to the win columns, but at
least its something to cheer about. North
western University's athletic department
has responded to the fans' lack of interest
in university sports by hiring Jalinda Davis,
a professional choreographer from Flori-

Ron Fernandez
da, to direct the Wildcat cheerleaders for
football and basketball games next year,
the Daily Northwestern reported.
David Rosengard, NU's director of pro
motions and marketing, callecTthe move a
"whole new sense of commitment to make
them a highly reputable squad.
Cheerleaders are sort of a public relations
tool," Rosengard said. Davis' job, he said,
will be to "get these kids motivated."
The 26-year-old Davis added, "They will
dance a little bit more. The squad as a
whole will be much more talented." Davis
has done similar work for the Chicago
Horizons indoor soccer team and the Fire
Belles of the American Football Associa
tion's Chicago Fire. She has experience ob
serving and rating cheerleaders and dance
squads at other universities.
"Right now — and I don't sit up in the
stands during games — I don't think the
cheerleaders are looked up to here like
they are at other Big Ten Schools," Rosen
gard said. "I think they just have to be
pushed. The real problem has been not
having anyone professional to clean them
up."
Party for the cause
Six Eastern Illinois University students
plan to hit the bottles and beer cans, sub
ject themselves to a breathalyzer test and
face the assistant attorney for Coles County
—- all in an effort to promote responsible

m —
drinking among college students.
The Daily Eastern News reported that the
students are taking part in an experiment
to demonstrate the results of different
ways of drinking in accordance to new Illi
nois drunk driving laws.
The experiment, entitled "If You're a
Boozer, Don't Be a Loser," consists of six
people who will be divided among three
teams that will each drink different kinds of
alcohol. The first team will drink five serv
ings of beer, the second team will consume
mixed drinks and the third team will mix
the two — within the span of two hours
before the forum begins.
One person in each team will consume
normal amounts of food during the day,
while the other will eat only breakfast, in
order to demonstrate the different results
of alcohol intake.
Two police officers from the Charleston
Police Department will then conduct
breathalyzer tests on the volunteers and
explain the procedure to the audience. Af
terwards, an assistant state attorney will
then speak on the revised drunk driving
laws and answer students' questions.
Puffing patriots
More than 50 students of the Texas Uni
versity Navy ROTC unit will carry the U.S.
flag over a 344-mile relay course from Aus
tin to Harlingen and salute it as the first to
fly over the Texas Iwo Jima Memorial.
According to The Texan, the students
plan to leave from the Austin campus and
arrive at the memorial two days later, main
taining an eight-mile per hour clip.

The project started when Felix de Weld
on, who sculpted the original plaster of the
Marine Corps War Memorial in Washing
ton, donated it to the public. The
sculpture, which de Weldon completed in
1954, will be bronzed and set on a base of
heavy black marble. The Texas memorial
will be the only reproduction the size of
the original. The plaster piece's fair market
value has been appraised at $3.5 million.

The memorial will stand in front of the
Marine Military Academy — the only pre
paratory high school m the country specifi
cally geared to Marine standards and ide
als.
"Its main claim to fame is it puts more
men in the various service academies
(West Point, Annapolis, etc.) than any oth
er high school," said Maj. Chuck
Armstrong, the Texas NROTC Marine of
ficer instructor. "Another thing is that it's
maintained and operated by retired
Marines.
"Those are the more patriotic reasons
(for placing the memorial at the
academy)," continued Armstrong. "An
other is the original cast had to have a
climate dry and not so humid ... Harl
ingen's climate is dry and not so humid."
The UT unit was selected for the cross
country flag duty when Midshipman
Aaron Marks volunteered his unit to
purchase an 18-foot by 12-foot flag and de
liver it.
"We bought the flag with our own mon
ey," said Armstrong. The $350,000 to cover
the bronzing, marble, and transportation
of the plaster to Harlingen was "con
tributed solely by the Marines and sailors
and their families, friends and supporters,"
he said.
Do Not Pass G0...
If you recently received a friendly note
from the registrar's office informing you
that your grades could use some, well,
improvement, don't feel alone. The Daily
Kent Stater reports that more than 20 per
cent of Kent State's 3152 undergraduates
are currently on academic probation.
According to the student affairs 6ffice,
most of the students in academic jeopardy
are freshmen. Of the 1694 freshmen, 36.8
percent were placed on probation follow
ing fall quarter, followed by 23.3 percent of
the sophomore class, 10.9 percent of the
junior class and 5.9 percent of KSU seniors.
There is a considerable difference be
tween the percentages of males and
females on academic probation. The ratio
of uppercLss males to upperclass females
is more than two to one.
The length of time students remain on
probation has decreased, said Richard
Worthing, assistant dean of the College
and Fine Professional Arts. He said that
there is no specific period of time that a
student may stay on probation without
being dismissed.
"It tends to be an individual matter," he
said.
Worthing said he doesn't think there is

any simple answer to why there is such a
large percentage of freshmen on proba
tion, but he thinks part of the reason is dif
ficulty in making the transition from high
school to college.
"Some of the reason I find for it is that In
some subject areas the distance between
acceptable college-level performance and
acceptable high school-level performance
in the subject may be increasing," he said.
He added that, while more Kent State
students are on probation, fewer students
are being dismissed.
Soothing broken hearts
You just got a letter from your girlfriend
that began, "Dear John," and your name is
Harold. When you went to that friendly
looking woman down the hall to share
your pain, she told you she had to study for
her final in "Psych Proctoring". And to
make things worse, your pet lizard died last
night.
How do you handle it?
Well, if you were a man at Northwestern
University, you might be able to soothe the
pain through group therapy. According to
the Daily Northwestern, this spring a psy
chology doctoral candidate will conduct
group sessions for men with break-up
problems.
The program will be specifically directed
toward helping men overcome the emo
tional difficulty of breaking a serious rela
tionship.
"Men usually have a harder time than
women in recovering from a break-up,"
said Hal Rice-Erso, who will direct the
counseling program. "Men often lack the
emotional support system that women
have — close friends are not as able to
share their feelings.
"Having somebody your own gender
who is having a similar experience can be
very helpful," he said.
Rice-Erso said he got the idea for the
new program when he noticed an especial
ly large number of men coming to the cam
pus crisis center with problems connected
to losing a wife or girlfriend. "They'd say,
'I'm crying all the time,' or M can't get any
work done,' " he said.
A main objective of the program Will be
to get the men to "re-establish themselves
as social animals," Rice-Erso said. "Many
men have a hard time starting to date
again," he said.
