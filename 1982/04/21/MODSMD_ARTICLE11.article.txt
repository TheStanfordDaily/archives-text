### LYN CARLSON La Jolla Light Staff 
He can memorize 200 names at a time, Time
Magazine in two hours, and 40 digits in three
minutes.
These stunts make him a popular performer
° n such programs as Mike Douglas and the
Today Show. But memory expert David
arkoff would rather teach his methods than
ea P the benefits of what he calls the
vaudeville" aspect of being a memory expert.
H,s 9oal in teaching his memory methods is
ad mittedly idealistic. He would like to see
memory courses required at the junior high
evel—"to revolutionize the course of
earn 'ng," as he puts it. "This leaves us with the
Possibility where nobody is labeled dumb or
smart," he said.
Memory improvement is my life," he says,
an 0 it has been so for ten years. He is billed as
e nation's foremost memory expert, has
Wr| tten two books, and has taught his methods
-^-^ ner QUS universities. ___ —

Things were not always so. "I was the person
who used to shake when the teacher called on
me," he said. He graduated at the bottom of his
class a year and a half late.
His humble beginnings give credence to his
claim that anyone can develop their memory;
that memory is not something that one either
has or doesn't have, "They regard me as a
genius and I'm not," he said. "Your memory is
one of your most instructable talehts."
The three keys to memorization that he cites
are creativity, organization, and visualization,
with the emphasis on creativity. Much has
been written about the necessity of visualizing
or associating with something concrete that
the mind can readily grasp, thus making
intangible things tangible.
The only problem with this, according to
Markoff, is that "to associate is a creative
activity." As a result, memorization in the past
has been "reserved for those who were

innately gifted with making these
associations."
One of the first things Markoff tries to do in
his seminars is to help people get over the fear
of not being able to remember something.
"Being unable to recall once in a while is
inevitable," he said. "The fear of that is not."
"From there, you can go anywhere."
Markoff Memory Training has been taught
at: USD, Harvard, SDSU, NYU Law, NYU
Medical and many others.
The course covers: LSAT vocabulary,
mathematics, organic chemistry, foreign
language, business, biology, MCAT, DAT,
GMAT, etc.
