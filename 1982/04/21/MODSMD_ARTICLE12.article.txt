## Soviet research restricted 
### 
Soviet scholar Nikolai Umnov must, no doubt, be
weary of packing and unpacking. The scholar was sched
uled to visit the University this spring when in January
the State Department, through the National Academy of
Sciences, imposed restrictions on his visit. The University
refused to follow them. The State Department later re
vised the restrictions and the University accepted. Then,
just three weeks ago, the State Department suddenly de
nied Umnov's visa all together.
Apparently, government officials arp worried that
Umnov might return to the Soviet Union with more than
a few engineering equations and some French bread
from Fisherman's Wharf. Indeed, in recent months the
suspicion of a flow of vital Western technology into the
hands of Soviets has got government officials nervously
counting microchips.

As Stanford Physics Prof. Arthur
Schawlow, a 1981 Nobel Prize
winner, has said, "to impose
restrictions on unclassified
research is a contradiction in
terms/'Because university
research is unclassified, it is...
often published • ..

While such a technology leakage may in fact be a justi
fied threat, recent government policies to restrict the ex
posure of some universityresearch to foreign scholars
have been misdirected attempts to defuse the danger.
Indeed it appears that such government restrictions
have been designed merely as political signals which
have only served to close legitimate pathways of ex
change between the two countries, unnecessarily ex
pediting the death of an ailing detante between the Sovi
et Union and the United States. The handling of the Um
nov incident is a case in point.
The Soviet scholar, an expert in robotics, was sched
uled to visit Stanford for one week on his tour of four ma
jor American universities. In January, the NAS passed
along State Department preliminary restrictions which,
among other things, prohibited Stanford from discussing
or displaying any research from unpublished projects,
especially those funded by the Department of Defense.
A normal request — for classified research. But the
University refuses to undertake any classified research so
that all information might be available for educational
purposes and that the University might avoid such gov
ernment restrictions. As Stanford Physics Prof. Arthur
Schawlow, a 1981 Nobel Prize winner, has said, "to im
pose restrictions on unclassified research is a contradic
tion in terms."
Because University research is unclassified, it is avail
able to the public and often published. Any Soviet intent
to steal such available information would not be hin
dered by restrictions on their scholars. The Kremlin
would simply order the publications.

In addition, walking robots (Umnov's specialty) do not
present any military threat and are not expected to, ac
cording to Umnov's sheduled host Mechanical Engi
neering Prof. Bernard Roth. The technology of walking
robots is presently a fascination.
"If you imagine 100 of these things walking
across a battlefield at you, forget it," Roth said. "Guys in
the U.S. who know something about it learned it from
the Russians — and freely admit it,"he added.
That the government is not primarily concerned with
plugging leaks is especially evident in allowing the Soviet
scholar who currently works with Roth to stay. This Sovi
et engineer has been exposed to all the robotics research
that Umnov himself would have seen on his visit.
A repercussion worse than the banning of a few schol
ars may be the precedent of limiting the open academic
environment that characterizes higher education, espe
cially at Stanford. As Lieberman wrote the NAS, "such ac
tions (restrictions) would drastically disrupt the academ
ic environment which is essential in fostering creative re
search endeavors."
In recent months, three other Soviets have been de
nied permission to come to the University. Soviet Vice
Consul Vladimir Bachurov was scheduled to speak on
the nuclear arms race last week, but was denied by the
State Department because he had not applied for per
mission to visit Stanford two full working days in ad
vance. Bacurov's speech, which was read in his absence,
called for a greater understanding between the two
countries and emphasized that mutually assured de
struction would be the result for both nations in the
event of a nuclear war.
Yuri Kaprolov of the Soviet embassy was also denied
permission to speak at Stanford earlier last quarter and a
represenative from Soviet news agency Tass was restrict
ed from attending Secretary of Defense Caspar Wein
berger's speech here.
The restrictions on these exchanges of ideas have
served no other purpose than to be a political announce
ment of the United States' disapproval of Soviet policies.
Unfortunately, the announcement was made at cost to
the University and turned possibly beneficial exchanges
into examples of decaying detante.
The future for such unhindered university research
does not look promising. Newsweek reported that the
House of Represenatives is considering a bill that would
allow the government to prevent the publication of any
thing that would threaten the national interest — what
ever that was defined to be. In addition, the commerce
department is considering a plan to propose a law that
would make it a felony for researchers to disclose sensi
tive data without first acquiring a license.
Concerning University research, the only legitimate
government policy to confront the potentially danger
ous leak of technology to Soviet controlled countries
should be the classification of currently unclassified re
search that the government views as vital to the national
interest. In that case, the University would most likely
stay consistent .vith their policy and give up the research.
Should the government desire to keep such scholars
from certain industries in the area, as they specified with
Umnov, than the arrangement should be made between
the government and the industry. The University
does not have the desire nor the means to police its for
eign scholars.
All other restrictions placed on visiting scholarsare not
sincere attempts at stopping the flow of technology and
can only heighten international tension and obstruct
meaningful exchanges between the Soviet Union and
the United States.
