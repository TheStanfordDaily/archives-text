## Spring tanning gives way to safer driving skills 
### 
The 12 points of a "Perfect Pass"
are: 1) Is it necessary?, 2) Stay back,
3)Check Ahead, 4) Check behind, 5)
Signal left, 6) Move left, 7) Ac
celerate, 8) Tap horn(s), 9) Signal
right, 10) Move right, 11) Cancel sig
nal, 12) Resume speed. As hard as it
may be to believe, this is not a
"cookbook recipe" for how to score
on your first date. Rather, it is just a
sample of some of the nifty driving
tips one can learn if he is so "lucky"
as to have the "privilege" of attend
ing Traffic School.
Yes folks, I was one of the "for
tunate" 79 who spent the first sunny,
god-like Saturday of spring at good
ol' Gunn High School, stuck in a band
room plastered full of stolen traffic
signs, watching movies of an
thropomorphic dummies being
hurled into brick walls at 60 mph. Oh
lord, why didn't I see that radar trap
on Embarcadero?
By all the fire-engine red bodies
gingerly making their way around
campus, it's obvious that spring has
finally arrived at the Farm and ev
eryone, after spending months inside
"enjoying" atypical Stanford weath
er, attempted to soak up some rays
this past weekend. For some of us,
however, we had to wait until Sunday
to do our burning because on Satur
day we were in a sense being
"burned" by sitting through eight
hours of the Drive Improvement I
course.
For those of you who haven't gone
to infamous traffic school, it's defi
nitely an experience you'll want to
take part in only once. It took me five
years at Stanford before I got the
honor of taking a ticket off my rec
ord. Judging by the number of Stan
ford students in attendance (I
counted at least seven), I'm sure
many of us have already served their
time or at least know of a friend who
has.
Obviously many of those taking
the course had received advice from
friends about the necessities to bring
to help the day go along a little easier.
The San Francisco Chronicle, Time
magazine and sundry reading mate
rial cluttered the desks of those in at

tendance. One woman brought her
needlepoint and a gentlemen, who
must have known how comfortable
the chairs were, brought enough
foam rubber padding for an army. By
far and away, the most common ac
tivity was letter writing.
If you were not forewarned and
didn't bring anything but your
drivers license, you could be content
to just sit back and "people watch."
People from all walks of life were
there. Perhaps the most common
line when introducing yourself to a
stranger was, "How did you get your
ticket?"
During a break I overhead another
Stanford student describe how she
had gotten caught going 45 mph on
Embarcadero ... at 2:30 a.m.l Oh
yes, you should have heard the
stories about the "wonderful" police
officers who gave people their
tickets.
For those of you unfamiliar with
traffic school, let me fill you in on
some of the catchy slogans you may
not have studied for a recent
midterm: Know, Slow, Show, Go (the
four-point plan for intersection safe
ty); reaction distance + braking dis
tance stopping (no, this isn't Math 41
with Prof. Mary Sunseri); Read,
Right, Reduce, Ride (a prescription
to avoid head-ons); Two-second rule
(safe following distance); and the
First Car Rule: the first car at a four
way stop sign has the right of way
(caution, this rule is not always fol
lowed by motorists!).
How about some of these "fun
facts?" Twenty-five percent of mo
torcycle accidents occur on bor
rowed bikes. During the year 1972,
how many accidents do you think
happened on the windy stretch of La
Honda Road from the bottom of the
hill up to Skyline? If you guessed 900,
give yourself a Brownie pointl
Did you know that only 12 percent
of those in the East wear their seat
belts as compared to 18 percent on
the West Coast? And did all you bicy
clists know that 80 percent of the ac
cidents involving bicycles are the
biker's fault?
My favorite, however, was the fol
lowing: by combining various

statistics, the satest driver is a woman
in her early 50s driving 25 m.p.h.
through Great Falls, Montana at 5:30
a.m. on a Tuesday in February.
For those of you who participated
in KZSU's recent trivia contest, these
are for you. Who invented the little
bumps in the middle of the road that
let you know your trashed Toyota
Corolla is unexpectedly swerving
into the brand new Porsche driving
beside you in the other lane? An
swer: Mr. Bot (Bott, Bottt? I have no
clue how he spells his name). They
are appropriately called "Bot dots."
Name four cities where a right turn
on red is illegal. Answer: New York,
New Orleans, Cleveland, and Chat
tanooga, Tenn.
Here is an interesting anecdote
from Herb Caen's column: a man in
San Francisco was witnessed running
into a parked car and wrote the fol
lowing note: "Some people saw me
hit your car and are now watching me
write this note. They think that I am
writing my name and phone number.
They are wrong. I am not."
Here are some quotes taken from
actual accident reports. Keep in mind
that these people are under stress
and may not really realize what they
are saying. "I collided with the sta
tionary truck coming the other way
... I pulled away from the side of the
road, glanced at my mother-in-law
and headed over the embankment
... the pedestrian had no idea which
direction to go, so I ran over him ...
the guy was all over the road; I had to
swerve a number of times before I hit
him ... and, I was on my way to the
doctor's office with rear end trouble
when my universal joint gave way
causing an accident."
The most entertaining movie of the
day was an experiment in which 30
experienced drinkers were trained to
perform intricate maneuvers be
tween cones and make split-second
decisions simulating accident situ
ations. These 30 people drank alco
hol until their blood alchohol con
tent was 0.10 percent and then at
tempted the same maneuvers.
Needless to say, their driving was
seriously impaired and very few of
the cones were left standing. Al

though it was almost like watching a
slapstick comedy, you knew ev
eryone in the room realized the inex
cusable dangers of driving under the
influence. There was quite a dis
cussion regarding California's new
stricter drunk driving laws.
For those of you who may com
plain, don't â€” 25,000 persons in the
United States are killed each year in
traffic accidents related to the drink
ing driver. In fact, our penalties are
quite lenient when compared tooth
er parts of the world. In addition to
punishment, in Australia all of the
names of those convicted for drunk
driving are printed in a newspaper
column entitled, "He is Drunk and in
Jail."
In Malaysia, a husband's wife is also
put in jail if he is caught driving while
under the influence. In Turkey, the
person is driven outside the coun
try's borders and must "walk" back.
And in Russia, those drinking drivers
causing an injury are executed by a
firing squad.
In all seriousness, Saturday was riot
as bad as I thought it would be. Al
though at times there were occasion
al souls in the back row asleep and
"catching flies," most people paid at
tention rather well underthe circum
stances. The instructors knew that ev
eryone in his or her right mind
wanted to be outside enjoying the
sunshine instead of taking a de
fensive driving course and they made
every effort to keep us entertained.
Before our lunch break we were
even shown a map of El Camino and
the locations of "gourmet" restau
rants. I commend the instructors Pete
Ida and Pete Hailman for a job well
done. Knock on wood you won't get
the illustrious opportunity to spend a
Saturday at Gunn, but ir you do, it's
not as bad as some of the rumors you
may have heard. Approach it with an
open mind and I can guarantee you
that you'll enjoy some laughs and
even learn some helpful hints to
make your driving experiences a lit
tle safer and more efficient. But don't
get assigned the first sunny Saturday
of spring.
