## Roasting Reagan is too easy 
### 
It is easy to criticize President |
Ronald Reagan. In fact, it is so easy i
that everyone is doing it these days. I
Recent estimates suggest that there is I
one critic for every 1.2 persons in the I
United States. That is the undisputed i
highest critic per capita ratio in the
world. *!
This ratio is confirmed everyday in i
this very newspaper as we constantly <
see, and a few read, columns criticiz- i
ing the president for any number of i
reasons. Nothing is sacred anymore
and the target list is extensive: un- (
employment, nuclear arms, social i
spending cuts, student loans, interest i
rates, White House china, etc. <
Much of the criticism, though, is i
paradoxical. For although it is often i
quite valid, few if any of the criticisms i
offer reasonable alternatives. In- |
stead, the critics are content to dis- ,
play their intellectual superiority by
voicing disagreements without offer- ,
ing proposals to improve our current
state. I
Needless to say, criticizing the !
president is not the same as criticiz- i
ing a Broadway play. Whereas for the i
latter it may be sufficient to say why it
is disagreeable, in order for political
criticism to be effective and useful it
must present rational alternatives.
It is not enough to tell the presi
dent, "No, I don't like that policy, can
we see something else..." as if to in
dicate the president's job is to mass
produce policies from which the
public selectively chooses. It is not
enough to criticize, one must also

propose. As the president has said in
response to the criticism over his
budget proposal, "If you have some
thing better, let's see it." Un
fortunately, nothing has yet come
up.
A good example is the recent up
surge about mutual nuclear disarma
ment. It sounds great; after all, how
can anyone disagree with such a
morally correct proposal? And yet, it
is much too simplistic.
Those who "demand mutual nu
clear disarmament" often neglect
the fact that mutual implies there is
more than one actor involved. Oth
erwise, we would call it unilateral. By
definition the United States cannot
unilaterally move for mutual nuclear
disarmament. In fact, in our multi
polar world a Unites States-Soviet
agreement is no longer sufficient.
What the world requires is global dis
armament.
The real problem is how are we to
go about mutual disarmament?
Should the president simply get on
the hot-line and call the Soviet Union
to say, "Hey guys, what about it,
should we take this stuff down?"
And, of course, the Soviet Union
being the agreeable and rational na
tion it is will instantly respond, "Sure
Mr. President, we will start on it first
thing in the morning." It seems to me
that it is a bit more difficult than that,
yet for most of the critics we read this
scenario fits quite well. Everyone
knows disarmament is essential, the
problem is how.
Another problem with today's
criticism is found in the recent fervor
over student aid cuts. Here is a case of
the proper cause being addressed
with improper motives. Students are
easily aroused when their education
is threatened. This is, of course, a nat
ural response; but I wonder how
many letters were written concern
ing the recent cuts in the free lunch
program for the poor?
Don't get me wrong, I do not want
my aid cut anymore than the next
person. However, the motives be
hind the current letter-writing are
puzzling. Are students upset because
they believe education is truly threat
ened and the future of our nation re-

lies on education? Sort of likether
cent comment I heard, "Whycai
the president wait two years?"
Students have a right to beupsi
but the issue is much more importa
than personal. The policies dosigni

picture; self-interests instead of n
tional interests. Students, howevt
are certainly not the only victims

can give. It is, in a sense, ourdutyl
