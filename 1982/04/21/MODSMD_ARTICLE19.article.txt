# Stanford falls to Cal Poly
## 
### Robert Stone 
It was a nightmarish case of
deja vu for Stanford's men's
volleyball team as they suffered
a 3-2 defeat at the hands of Cal
Poly-San Luis Obispo last night
at Maples Pavillion. The
Cardinal faltered by the same
margin when it hosted the
Mustangs in the season opener
in January.
The non-league matchup
dropped Stanford to 6-18 on
the season, while Cal Poly up
ped its record to 18-8.
The see-sawing match was
almost an exact replay of the
teams' first meeting, with the
deciding game going down to
the wire. Stanford stifled the
Mustangs in the first and fourth
games 15-8, 15-8, but dropped
the middle two games 15-17
and 5-15. In the final game
Stanford blazed to an 11-5 lead
but couldn't stave off a
Mustang rally and lost the
tiebreaker 14-16.
The match marked Stan
ford's ninth straight defeat af
ter upsetting second-ranked
USC, and was a particularly bit
ter pill for the team to swallow.
"What it boils down to is we've
lost too many games, it makes it
hard to be confident when the
match is close. When we
played well they didn't have a
chance, but when they played
well we didn't maintain our

composure," explained assis
tant Cardinal coach Don Shaw.
In the final game of the
match Stanford seemed de
termined to snap its slump. The
Cardinal built a 6-0 advantage
with a sharp offense and hustl
ing defense that seemed to
catch the Mustangs off-guard.
Stanford hitter Bob Dean got
the squad off to a good start
with a pair of well-placed shots
that put the Card ahead 2-0.
With senior middle blocker
Mark Reagan's diving saves in
the backcourt and freshman
Bill Witte directing the team at
setter Stanford quickly and me
thodically opened up the
margin, rattling Cal Poly in the
process.
Cal Poly tightened the score
to 13-9 and with some im
pressive saves fended off the
Stanford attack. After Mustang
Mark Booth blocked a Stanford
slam at the net to bring the vis
itors within two, 14-12, Cal Poly
stole the victory right from un
der its hosts. Some well-placed
returns coupled with a pair of
Stanford miscues brought the
game to a quick end 14-16.
The* Cardinal has until Friday
to regroup when they play the
last match of the season against
Cal State-Long Beach at
Maples, beginning at 7:30.
