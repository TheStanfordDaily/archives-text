had threatened to resign Sun
he senate approved the con
election returns, but following
nate validation of the returns

last night he said he would not resign
so that he could continue to repre
sent the interests of his constituents.
"I still think I speak for a large pop
ulation here on campus," he said.
Buhl said he felt obligated to urge
the senate to invalidate the election
because of the irregularities involved
in the election procedure.
"I can only say that I spoke my con
science," he said.
COP chair Mariann Byerwalter said
there were several reasons that she
and fellow COP members Chris
Greene and Dragan Popov revoked
Buhl's authority, including Buhl's
previous threats to resign and his
adoption of a partisan stance in the
controversy over the validation of
the election.
Byerwalter said the COP had de

cided as a group to remain publicly
neutral in the dispute over the validi
ty of the election results. Buhl, she
said, had "misrepresented" himself
to the other three members of the
COP when he did not tell them that
he would actively encourage the sen
ate to invalidate the election results
by threatening to resign if it validated
them.
Another reason for the COP's ac
tion, according to Byerwalter, was
Buhl's active search for additional in
formation to help the case of those
seeking to invalidate the election.
Byerwalter said she was disap
pointed that the COP's term had to
be ended in this way.
"It's really a shame because of all of
the positive things we've done," she
said.
