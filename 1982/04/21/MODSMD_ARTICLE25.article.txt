four times.
Davis won the No. 1
vith a 3-6, 7-5, 6-2 win

ohnSaviano countered
iree-set win over Mark

obinsin edged Steve
-5,6-3.

Among the coaches who
left in Geiger's first year were
Rod Dowhower (football), Ji m
Gaughran (swimming), Bruce
Summerhays (golf), Payton Jor
dan (track), Dean Clark (cross
country) and Anne Gould
(women's tennis).
On the surface, the amount
of resignations could be pure
coincidence. Certainly every
one of the coaches that has left
has had a legitimate reason for
leaving.
Dowhower left after being
offered a job as offensive coor
dinator with the Denver Bron
cos. Summers left for financial
reasons; Jordan (then 62) ex
pressed a desire to spend less
time coaching; Gould wanted
tocontinue hereducation, and
the list continues.
When asked back in January,
1980 about the great number

of resignations in his first year
in office, he replied: "I don't
think changes are abnormal in
today's world."
Certainly change has not
been abnormal in Geiger's ath
letic world. He's brought in the
poaches he has wanted, and
has made the moves swiftly.
The replacements Geiger has
chosen have generally been
big name coaches with na
tional reputations.
Skip Kenney (July, 1979) was
the first coach hired by Geiger,
and has set the pattern for
'hose to follow. He had an ex
cellent coaching record before
coming to Stanford. He served
as head coach of the Cincinnati
Pepsi Marlins AAU club for
three seasons and won Coach
of the Year awards in 1977 and
1978 from the Ohio-AAU as
sociation. He also served as

head coach for both the U.S.
men's and women's national
teams in 1978-79.
Director of track, Brooks
Johnson (August,l979), came to
Stanford with a big reputation.
He was the 1976 U.S. Olympic
team sprint coach and twice
coached the U.S. National In
door team.
Stanford women's swimming
coach George Haines (August
1981) did not need an introduc
tion. The most famous swim
ming coach in the world, he
had been either head or assis
tant coach of the U.S. Olympic
swim team the last six years and
was co-founder of the famous
Santa Clara Swim Club.
The resumes of the other
coaches hired by Geiger read
the same way — all respected
names with established records
before coming here.

But how have these coaches
actually fared? Not surprising
ly, most of them have done
well.
Brooks Johnson led the
women's cross country team to
a third place finish at the NCAA
tournament — no Cardinal
team had previuosly ever been
in the top 20. Frank Brennan is
currently coaching the No. 1
college women's tennis team
in the U.S. The women's swim
team placed second at Na
tionals. Skip Kenney was
named NCAA swim coach of
the year, and the list continues.
Not all of the coaches hired by
Geiger have enjoyed this kind
of success (football coach Paul
Wiggin being the most obvious
example), but by and large, the
record is pretty good.
Geiger's most recent new
coach, Dr. Tom Davis, is in the

same mold as the others. He's a
winning coach with a national
reputation, and with a few
good recruiting years should
transform Stanford basketball
into a respectable varsity sport.
Change has been an integral
part of the Andy Geiger years at
Stanford, but looking at the
record, its hard to argue that it
has not been change for the
better.

This weekend Stanford is
hosting a women's water polo
tournament. There are 16
teams entered, with Stanford,
UC-Santa Barbara, and San Di

The tournament starts at 7

Tomorrow the Stanford
baseball team plays the San

Besides the fact that this is
the first time the Giants have
ever played at Sunken

catchers and pitchers will use
the new Mizuno fielding glove

pitcher.
Ticket prices are $5 for

Among the coaches who
left in Geiger's first year were
Rod Dowhower (football), Ji m
Gaughran (swimming), Bruce
Summerhays (golf), Payton Jor
dan (track), Dean Clark (cross
country) and Anne Gould
(women's tennis).
On the surface, the amount
of resignations could be pure
coincidence. Certainly every
one of the coaches that has left
has had a legitimate reason for
leaving.
Dowhower left after being
offered a job as offensive coor
dinator with the Denver Bron
cos. Summers left for financial
reasons; Jordan (then 62) ex
pressed a desire to spend less
time coaching; Gould wanted
tocontinue hereducation, and
the list continues.
When asked back in January,
1980 about the great number

of resignations in his first year
in office, he replied: "I don't
think changes are abnormal in
today's world."
Certainly change has not
been abnormal in Geiger's ath
letic world. He's brought in the
poaches he has wanted, and
has made the moves swiftly.
The replacements Geiger has
chosen have generally been
big name coaches with na
tional reputations.
Skip Kenney (July, 1979) was
the first coach hired by Geiger,
and has set the pattern for
'hose to follow. He had an ex
cellent coaching record before
coming to Stanford. He served
as head coach of the Cincinnati
Pepsi Marlins AAU club for
three seasons and won Coach
of the Year awards in 1977 and
1978 from the Ohio-AAU as
sociation. He also served as

head coach for both the U.S.
men's and women's national
teams in 1978-79.
Director of track, Brooks
Johnson (August,l979), came to
Stanford with a big reputation.
He was the 1976 U.S. Olympic
team sprint coach and twice
coached the U.S. National In
door team.
Stanford women's swimming
coach George Haines (August
1981) did not need an introduc
tion. The most famous swim
ming coach in the world, he
had been either head or assis
tant coach of the U.S. Olympic
swim team the last six years and
was co-founder of the famous
Santa Clara Swim Club.
The resumes of the other
coaches hired by Geiger read
the same way — all respected
names with established records
before coming here.

But how have these coaches
actually fared? Not surprising
ly, most of them have done
well.
Brooks Johnson led the
women's cross country team to
a third place finish at the NCAA
tournament — no Cardinal
team had previuosly ever been
in the top 20. Frank Brennan is
currently coaching the No. 1
college women's tennis team
in the U.S. The women's swim
team placed second at Na
tionals. Skip Kenney was
named NCAA swim coach of
the year, and the list continues.
Not all of the coaches hired by
Geiger have enjoyed this kind
of success (football coach Paul
Wiggin being the most obvious
example), but by and large, the
record is pretty good.
Geiger's most recent new
coach, Dr. Tom Davis, is in the

same mold as the others. He's a
winning coach with a national
reputation, and with a few
good recruiting years should
transform Stanford basketball
into a respectable varsity sport.
Change has been an integral
part of the Andy Geiger years at
Stanford, but looking at the
record, its hard to argue that it
has not been change for the
better.

This weekend Stanford is
hosting a women's water polo

Tomorrow the Stanford
baseball team plays the San

Besides the fact that this is
the first time the Giants have
ever played at Sunken
Diamond, there is another first
in the game. For one inning

catchers and pitchers will use
the new Mizuno fielding glove
which use a computer to relay
singles between catcher and
