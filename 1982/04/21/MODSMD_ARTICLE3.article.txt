We want to do something," Eyerly said, "The issue
whether the public and the council have concerns
I the nuclear issue. The public should realize the
demands on council members. I for one do not be
'hat the council should allow such a dilution of its
By and time. For these reasons, and wanting not to

"To consider an issue superficially is to consider it un
justly," Levy said. "I really feel that the principle by
which I have guided my life on the City Council dictates
that I abstain from taking a position on this issue. I would
do it personally, but as a Council member, I feel it is inap
propriate."
Lack of Council support for his intended motion-to
table dissuaded Eyerly from turning the open city coun
cil meeting into a town meeting where the public would
address itself.
"The public shduld be given the opportunity to argue
the appropriateness of the issue to the city council,"
Fletcher said. "Otherwise, what is the purpose of an
open city council meeting?"
"I think the issue which the council members are
avoiding cannot be addressed if you are going to use
tricks to shut off debate," she told Eyerly.
About 30 individuals addressed the council. Some rep
resented groups such as the Students for Social Respon
sibility Freeze Campaign.
"A focus on prevention is imperative," said Mark
Kleinberg, a third-year medical student here. "This plan
ning creates a false sense of security."
In a shaky but forceful voice, Prof. Frank Spencer said,
"I am the oldest person here. Next week I start my 89th
year. What I am afraid of is I am going to live as long as
you do because we're all going to die at the same time."
By the end of the public hearings, Council members
Michael Cobb, Emily Renzel and Gary Fazzino had
joined Fletcher, Klein and Betsy Bechtel in favor of the
resolution. Witherspoon was absent during the vote.
"Despite my very negative reaction to the pressure
that was applied in this room tonight, I will support the
resolution," Cobb said. "But I will continue to resist
bringing national issues to this council, because 112 think
they divert us from the job we were elected to do."
