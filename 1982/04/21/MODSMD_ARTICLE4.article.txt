Pentagon leaders have told the services to look for places
to reduce the budget authority account where the savings
would be almost immediate.
For example, reducing the days that ships stay on patrol or
the Army goes on maneuvers saves money in the budget au
thority and spending accounts within the same budget year.
But this jeopardizes the readiness of forces to go to war, and
Pentagon strategists will emphasize that.
Pentagon officials last night refused to confirm or deny
that they were mobilizing for such resistance, contending
that to discuss their budget strategy might weaken their hand
in what is expected to be another struggle for dollars within
the administration as well as without. But military sources
said the armed services have been alerted already that cuts
may be coming.
OAS to consider aiding Argentina
Washington — The Organization of American States, ov
erriding U.S. objections, voted yesterday to hold a special
meeting of foreign ministers next Monday to consider Ar
gentina's call for assistance from Western Hemisphere coun
tries against Britain in the Falkland Islands crisis.
The vote, which could lead to an Argentine request that
OAS members use military force or other sanctions against
Britain, was 18-0, with the United States, Colombia and
Trinidad abstaining.
It came as President Ronald Reagan appealed to Britain
and Argentina to avoid an armed conflict and give Secretary
of State Alexander Haig more time to pursue a peaceful set
tlement after he meets here tomorrow with British Foreign
Secretary Francis Pym.
During a brief talk with reporters at the White House, Rea
gan said it would have been more "advantageous" if the
OAS had put off acting on Argentina's request to consider
action under the 1947 Inter-American Treaty of Reciprocal
Assistance The Un;*ed States is among 21 active OAS mem
bers that are signatories to the accord, commonly known as
the Rio Treaty.
The United States is known to have made clear to the Ar
gentines that in a showdown it would side with Britain. But
the administration wants to avoid an open breach with Ar
gentina, to enable Haig to continue his mediation effort and
to preserve the ties it has cultivated with President Leopoldo
Galtieri's government.
Senators warn El Salvador rightists
Washington — The ranking Republican and Democrat on
the Senate Foreign Relations Committee yesterday voiced
sharp warnings to right-wing political parties in El Salvador
that any attempt to form a government without the more
moderate Christian Democrats would lead to a cutoff of all
aid to that country.
Committee Chairman Charles Percy (R-lll.) said that "any
government that does not include the Christian Democrats,
which does not seek to bridge political differences in the in
terests of national unity and peace, will not be credible to
Congress and cannot expect the support of Congress."
Percy said Salvadoran parties struggling to put together a
government in the wake of elections March 28 "must be

made to understand" that not only the Christian Democrats
but also reforms started by the now-unseated Christian
Democrat President Jose Napoleon Duarte must be included
in whatever government emerges.
Even though the Christian Democrats received more votes
than any other party in the elections, Percy said they could
be dealt out of the new government.
Percy made his comments yesterday at a hearing on the
administration policy in Latin America. The State Depart
ment's deputy assistant secretary for inter-American affairs,
Steven Bosworth, told Percy that the administration "wel
comed his statement as a powerful expression of Congress'
views" and that it was "our conclusion that the political lead
ers" in El Salvador are aware of those views.
Nuclear freeze proponents file
signatures for Cal. initiative
San Francisco — Anti-nuclear campaign workers took the
last of nearly 750,000 signatures to county registrars in Cali
fornia yesterday in an effort to avert the "final debacle that
could end life."
The campaign drew more than twice the 346,119 signa
tures required to place a nuclear freeze intiative on the Nov.
2 ballot.
In Los Angeles County, an armored truck was used to
usher an unofficial 172,400 signatures to the registrar's office.
Another 56,000 were filed in Orange County, according to
Californians for a Bilateral Nuclear Weapons Freeze; and
58,600 were delivered in San Francisco City Hall after a noon
rally that drew about 150 people.
The group had collected 717,300 signatures from the 58
counties by April 12, said Linda Feldman, director of special
projects. She estimated the total had grown to nearly 750,000
by yesterday. A few counties filed their signatures on Mon
day, she said.
The initiative, if approved by a simple majority of state vot
ers, would require the governor to write to the president, the
secretary of defense, the secretary of state and all members
of Congress urging the United States to seek agreement with
the Soviet Union for an immediate halt to "testing, produc
tion and further deployment of all nuclear weapons, missiles
and delivery systems."
Voters in seven other states and in Washington D.C., are in
the process of placing similar proposals on the ballot in the
fall, said Karen Fierke, co-director of the National Clear
inghouse of the Nuclear Weapons Freeze campaign in St.
Louis.
Court bars labor boycotts
Washington — American labor unions may not boycott
cargoes going to or coming from a foreign country as a pro
test against that nation's foreign and military policies, the Su
preme Court ruled Monday.
By a unamimous vote, the justices decided that the refusal
of the International Longshoremen's Association to handle
goods being sent to or arriving from the Soviet Union after
the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan was illegal.
The court held that the ILA may be required to pay dam
ages, which could run into millions of dollars, to an Ameri
can trading company, Allied International, Inc., which suf

fered financial losses as a result of the boycott.
The ruling appears broad enough to apply to other recent
boycotts by the ILA and other U.S. unions against foreign
cargoes. For example, some unions stopped handling Iran
ian cargoes after the seizure of American hostages in 19/9,
and the I LA refused to work on shipments to or from Poland
after martial law was declared last Dec. 13.
However, the ruling applies only to labor unions, and does
not cover boycotts or trade embargoes by the U.S. govern
ment. The Reagan administration had told the Supreme
Court that the ILA's Soviet boycott was illegal, maintaining
that the union's action interfered with the official conduct of
U.S.foreign policy.
U.S. vetoes U.N. resolution
condemning Jerusalem violence
United Nations — The United States vetoed a Security
Council resolution yesterday condemning the "appalling
acts of sacrilege" in Jerusalem nine days ago when two wor
shipers in the Dome of the Rock mosque were killed in a
burst of gunfire. An American-born Israeli soldier was ar
rested in connection with the shooting.
U.S. Ambassador Jeane Kirkpatrick stood alone in oppos
ing the draft, which was backed by the other 14 council
members.
She explained the American stand — the third U.S. veto on
Israel's behalf this year — by saying that the resolution im
plied that Israeli authorities were responsible for "this ter
rible event." Its adoption, she added, would have increased
the bitter divisions in the region that "would make new acts
of violence more likely to take place."
But the unstated American motive, diplomats said, was a
hint from Israeli officials that an abstention, which would
have permitted the resolution to pass, would increase
domestic pressures on the Jerusalem government just five
days before it is scheduled to return the last chunk of the Si
nai Peninsula to Egypt. The extent of American diplomatic
support has become a prime issue in Israel.
In an attempt to soothe Arab feelings, Kirkpatrick strongly
condemned the "senseless act of violence at one of Islam's
most sacred shrines," and expressed her condolences to all
who have suffered. A number of Moslem worshipers were
wounded in the melee.
Energy stocks lead broad decline
New York — Stocks were mostly lower yesterday, paced by
a sharp decline in many oil and energy-service issues. Trad
ing was moderate.
Electronic, chemical, financial and airline stocks also were
numerous among the losers.
The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials fell 5.52 to 840.56,
breaking a three-session string of modest gains. The trans
portation index also fell but the utilities measure was un
changed.
Todays weather
Fair and warm through tomorrow. Lows in the upper 40s
and 50s. Highs in the 70s to mid-80s. Easterly winds 10 to 20
mph. Strong gusty northeast winds at times in the hills.

OAS to consider aiding Argentina
Washington — The Organization of American States, ov
erriding U.S. objections, voted yesterday to hold a special
meeting of foreign ministers next Monday to consider Ar
gentina's call for assistance from Western Hemisphere coun
tries against Britain in the Falkland Islands crisis.
The vote, which could lead to an Argentine request that
OAS members use military force or other sanctions against
Britain, was 18-0, with the United States, Colombia and
Trinidad abstaining.
It came as President Ronald Reagan appealed to Britain
and Argentina to avoid an armed conflict and give Secretary
of State Alexander Haig more time to pursue a peaceful set
tlement after he meets here tomorrow with British Foreign
Secretary Francis Pym.
During a brief talk with reporters at the White House, Rea
gan said it would have been more "advantageous" if the
OAS had put off acting on Argentina's request to consider
action under the 1947 Inter-American Treaty of Reciprocal
Assistance The Un;*ed States is among 21 active OAS mem
bers that are signatories to the accord, commonly known as
the Rio Treaty.
The United States is known to have made clear to the Ar
gentines that in a showdown it would side with Britain. But
the administration wants to avoid an open breach with Ar
gentina, to enable Haig to continue his mediation effort and
to preserve the ties it has cultivated with President Leopoldo
Galtieri's government.
Senators warn El Salvador rightists
Washington — The ranking Republican and Democrat on
the Senate Foreign Relations Committee yesterday voiced
sharp warnings to right-wing political parties in El Salvador
that any attempt to form a government without the more
moderate Christian Democrats would lead to a cutoff of all
aid to that country.
Committee Chairman Charles Percy (R-lll.) said that "any
government that does not include the Christian Democrats,
which does not seek to bridge political differences in the in
terests of national unity and peace, will not be credible to
Congress and cannot expect the support of Congress."
Percy said Salvadoran parties struggling to put together a
government in the wake of elections March 28 "must be

made to understand" that not only the Christian Democrats
but also reforms started by the now-unseated Christian
Democrat President Jose Napoleon Duarte must be included
in whatever government emerges.
Even though the Christian Democrats received more votes
than any other party in the elections, Percy said they could
be dealt out of the new government.
Percy made his comments yesterday at a hearing on the
administration policy in Latin America. The State Depart
ment's deputy assistant secretary for inter-American affairs,
Steven Bosworth, told Percy that the administration "wel
comed his statement as a powerful expression of Congress'
views" and that it was "our conclusion that the political lead
ers" in El Salvador are aware of those views.
Nuclear freeze proponents file
signatures for Cal. initiative
San Francisco — Anti-nuclear campaign workers took the
last of nearly 750,000 signatures to county registrars in Cali
fornia yesterday in an effort to avert the "final debacle that
could end life."
The campaign drew more than twice the 346,119 signa
tures required to place a nuclear freeze intiative on the Nov.
2 ballot.
In Los Angeles County, an armored truck was used to
usher an unofficial 172,400 signatures to the registrar's office.
Another 56,000 were filed in Orange County, according to
Californians for a Bilateral Nuclear Weapons Freeze; and
58,600 were delivered in San Francisco City Hall after a noon
rally that drew about 150 people.
The group had collected 717,300 signatures from the 58
counties by April 12, said Linda Feldman, director of special
projects. She estimated the total had grown to nearly 750,000
by yesterday. A few counties filed their signatures on Mon
day, she said.
The initiative, if approved by a simple majority of state vot
ers, would require the governor to write to the president, the
secretary of defense, the secretary of state and all members
of Congress urging the United States to seek agreement with
the Soviet Union for an immediate halt to "testing, produc
tion and further deployment of all nuclear weapons, missiles
and delivery systems."
Voters in seven other states and in Washington D.C., are in
the process of placing similar proposals on the ballot in the
fall, said Karen Fierke, co-director of the National Clear
inghouse of the Nuclear Weapons Freeze campaign in St.
Louis.
Court bars labor boycotts
Washington — American labor unions may not boycott
cargoes going to or coming from a foreign country as a pro
test against that nation's foreign and military policies, the Su
preme Court ruled Monday.
By a unamimous vote, the justices decided that the refusal
of the International Longshoremen's Association to handle
goods being sent to or arriving from the Soviet Union after
the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan was illegal.
The court held that the ILA may be required to pay dam
ages, which could run into millions of dollars, to an Ameri
can trading company, Allied International, Inc., which suf

fered financial losses as a result of the boycott.
The ruling appears broad enough to apply to other recent
boycotts by the ILA and other U.S. unions against foreign
cargoes. For example, some unions stopped handling Iran
ian cargoes after the seizure of American hostages in 19/9,
and the I LA refused to work on shipments to or from Poland
after martial law was declared last Dec. 13.
However, the ruling applies only to labor unions, and does
not cover boycotts or trade embargoes by the U.S. govern
ment. The Reagan administration had told the Supreme
Court that the ILA's Soviet boycott was illegal, maintaining
that the union's action interfered with the official conduct of
U.S.foreign policy.
U.S. vetoes U.N. resolution
condemning Jerusalem violence
United Nations — The United States vetoed a Security
Council resolution yesterday condemning the "appalling
acts of sacrilege" in Jerusalem nine days ago when two wor
shipers in the Dome of the Rock mosque were killed in a
burst of gunfire. An American-born Israeli soldier was ar
rested in connection with the shooting.
U.S. Ambassador Jeane Kirkpatrick stood alone in oppos
ing the draft, which was backed by the other 14 council
members.
She explained the American stand — the third U.S. veto on
Israel's behalf this year — by saying that the resolution im
plied that Israeli authorities were responsible for "this ter
rible event." Its adoption, she added, would have increased
the bitter divisions in the region that "would make new acts
of violence more likely to take place."
But the unstated American motive, diplomats said, was a
hint from Israeli officials that an abstention, which would
have permitted the resolution to pass, would increase
domestic pressures on the Jerusalem government just five
days before it is scheduled to return the last chunk of the Si
nai Peninsula to Egypt. The extent of American diplomatic
support has become a prime issue in Israel.
In an attempt to soothe Arab feelings, Kirkpatrick strongly
condemned the "senseless act of violence at one of Islam's
most sacred shrines," and expressed her condolences to all
who have suffered. A number of Moslem worshipers were
wounded in the melee.
Energy stocks lead broad decline
New York — Stocks were mostly lower yesterday, paced by
a sharp decline in many oil and energy-service issues. Trad
ing was moderate.
Electronic, chemical, financial and airline stocks also were
numerous among the losers.
The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials fell 5.52 to 840.56,
breaking a three-session string of modest gains. The trans
portation index also fell but the utilities measure was un
changed.
Todays weather
Fair and warm through tomorrow. Lows in the upper 40s
and 50s. Highs in the 70s to mid-80s. Easterly winds 10 to 20
mph. Strong gusty northeast winds at times in the hills.

Washington — The ranking Republican and Democrat on
the Senate Foreign Relations Committee yesterday voiced
sharp warnings to right-wing political parties in El Salvador
that any attempt to form a government without the more
moderate Christian Democrats would lead to a cutoff of all
aid to that country.
Committee Chairman Charles Percy (R-lll.) said that "any
government that does not include the Christian Democrats,
which does not seek to bridge political differences in the in
terests of national unity and peace, will not be credible to
Congress and cannot expect the support of Congress."
Percy said Salvadoran parties struggling to put together a
government in the wake of elections March 28 "must be

made to understand" that not only the Christian Democrats
but also reforms started by the now-unseated Christian
Democrat President Jose Napoleon Duarte must be included
in whatever government emerges.
Even though the Christian Democrats received more votes
than any other party in the elections, Percy said they could
be dealt out of the new government.
Percy made his comments yesterday at a hearing on the
administration policy in Latin America. The State Depart
ment's deputy assistant secretary for inter-American affairs,
Steven Bosworth, told Percy that the administration "wel
comed his statement as a powerful expression of Congress'
views" and that it was "our conclusion that the political lead
ers" in El Salvador are aware of those views.
Nuclear freeze proponents file
signatures for Cal. initiative
San Francisco — Anti-nuclear campaign workers took the
last of nearly 750,000 signatures to county registrars in Cali
fornia yesterday in an effort to avert the "final debacle that
could end life."
The campaign drew more than twice the 346,119 signa
tures required to place a nuclear freeze intiative on the Nov.
2 ballot.
In Los Angeles County, an armored truck was used to
usher an unofficial 172,400 signatures to the registrar's office.
Another 56,000 were filed in Orange County, according to
Californians for a Bilateral Nuclear Weapons Freeze; and
58,600 were delivered in San Francisco City Hall after a noon
rally that drew about 150 people.
The group had collected 717,300 signatures from the 58
counties by April 12, said Linda Feldman, director of special
projects. She estimated the total had grown to nearly 750,000
by yesterday. A few counties filed their signatures on Mon
day, she said.
The initiative, if approved by a simple majority of state vot
ers, would require the governor to write to the president, the
secretary of defense, the secretary of state and all members
of Congress urging the United States to seek agreement with
the Soviet Union for an immediate halt to "testing, produc
tion and further deployment of all nuclear weapons, missiles
and delivery systems."
Voters in seven other states and in Washington D.C., are in
the process of placing similar proposals on the ballot in the
fall, said Karen Fierke, co-director of the National Clear
inghouse of the Nuclear Weapons Freeze campaign in St.
Louis.
Court bars labor boycotts
Washington — American labor unions may not boycott
cargoes going to or coming from a foreign country as a pro
test against that nation's foreign and military policies, the Su
preme Court ruled Monday.
By a unamimous vote, the justices decided that the refusal
of the International Longshoremen's Association to handle
goods being sent to or arriving from the Soviet Union after
the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan was illegal.
The court held that the ILA may be required to pay dam
ages, which could run into millions of dollars, to an Ameri
can trading company, Allied International, Inc., which suf

fered financial losses as a result of the boycott.
The ruling appears broad enough to apply to other recent
boycotts by the ILA and other U.S. unions against foreign
cargoes. For example, some unions stopped handling Iran
ian cargoes after the seizure of American hostages in 19/9,
and the I LA refused to work on shipments to or from Poland
after martial law was declared last Dec. 13.
However, the ruling applies only to labor unions, and does
not cover boycotts or trade embargoes by the U.S. govern
ment. The Reagan administration had told the Supreme
Court that the ILA's Soviet boycott was illegal, maintaining
that the union's action interfered with the official conduct of
U.S.foreign policy.
U.S. vetoes U.N. resolution
condemning Jerusalem violence
United Nations — The United States vetoed a Security
Council resolution yesterday condemning the "appalling
acts of sacrilege" in Jerusalem nine days ago when two wor
shipers in the Dome of the Rock mosque were killed in a
burst of gunfire. An American-born Israeli soldier was ar
rested in connection with the shooting.
U.S. Ambassador Jeane Kirkpatrick stood alone in oppos
ing the draft, which was backed by the other 14 council
members.
She explained the American stand — the third U.S. veto on
Israel's behalf this year — by saying that the resolution im
plied that Israeli authorities were responsible for "this ter
rible event." Its adoption, she added, would have increased
the bitter divisions in the region that "would make new acts
of violence more likely to take place."
But the unstated American motive, diplomats said, was a
hint from Israeli officials that an abstention, which would
have permitted the resolution to pass, would increase
domestic pressures on the Jerusalem government just five
days before it is scheduled to return the last chunk of the Si
nai Peninsula to Egypt. The extent of American diplomatic
support has become a prime issue in Israel.
In an attempt to soothe Arab feelings, Kirkpatrick strongly
condemned the "senseless act of violence at one of Islam's
most sacred shrines," and expressed her condolences to all
who have suffered. A number of Moslem worshipers were
wounded in the melee.
Energy stocks lead broad decline
New York — Stocks were mostly lower yesterday, paced by
a sharp decline in many oil and energy-service issues. Trad
ing was moderate.
Electronic, chemical, financial and airline stocks also were
numerous among the losers.
The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials fell 5.52 to 840.56,
breaking a three-session string of modest gains. The trans
portation index also fell but the utilities measure was un
changed.
Todays weather
Fair and warm through tomorrow. Lows in the upper 40s
and 50s. Highs in the 70s to mid-80s. Easterly winds 10 to 20
mph. Strong gusty northeast winds at times in the hills.

Pentagon leaders have told the services to look for places
to reduce the budget authority account where the savings
would be almost immediate.
For example, reducing the days that ships stay on patrol or
the Army goes on maneuvers saves money in the budget au
thority and spending accounts within the same budget year.
But this jeopardizes the readiness of forces to go to war, and
Pentagon strategists will emphasize that.
Pentagon officials last night refused to confirm or deny
that they were mobilizing for such resistance, contending
that to discuss their budget strategy might weaken their hand
in what is expected to be another struggle for dollars within
the administration as well as without. But military sources
said the armed services have been alerted already that cuts
may be coming.
OAS to consider aiding Argentina
Washington — The Organization of American States, ov
erriding U.S. objections, voted yesterday to hold a special
meeting of foreign ministers next Monday to consider Ar
gentina's call for assistance from Western Hemisphere coun
tries against Britain in the Falkland Islands crisis.
The vote, which could lead to an Argentine request that
OAS members use military force or other sanctions against
Britain, was 18-0, with the United States, Colombia and
Trinidad abstaining.
It came as President Ronald Reagan appealed to Britain
and Argentina to avoid an armed conflict and give Secretary
of State Alexander Haig more time to pursue a peaceful set
tlement after he meets here tomorrow with British Foreign
Secretary Francis Pym.
During a brief talk with reporters at the White House, Rea
gan said it would have been more "advantageous" if the
OAS had put off acting on Argentina's request to consider
action under the 1947 Inter-American Treaty of Reciprocal
Assistance The Un;*ed States is among 21 active OAS mem
bers that are signatories to the accord, commonly known as
the Rio Treaty.
The United States is known to have made clear to the Ar
gentines that in a showdown it would side with Britain. But
the administration wants to avoid an open breach with Ar
gentina, to enable Haig to continue his mediation effort and
to preserve the ties it has cultivated with President Leopoldo
Galtieri's government.
