# Senators OK election
## 
### Kathy Bodovitz Senior staff writer 
After more than an hour of animated debate, with a
packed house of about 100 students, the ASSU Senate
last night voted 10 to seven to accept the results of last
week's election.
Discussion centered on allegations brought by the de
feated Council of Presidents (COP) slate that the elec
tions were unfair because of irregular polling hours, im
proper ballot treatment and lack of control over which
students could vote for which offices.
Barry (BJ) Beal, spokesman for the elections com
mission, presented a new list of the vote totals, saying
that all the ballots had been recounted yesterday by
hand and approximately 200, on which students had
voted for both undergraduate and graduate senators,
were disregarded for those two races. The updated out
come of both elections was the same, with the exception
of one tie broken for the graduate Humanities and Sci
ences senator.
Senator Marty Roberts cited the 60 percent turnout in
the senior class election, as opposed to 19 percent elec
tion turnout overall, as evidence that juniors were prob
ably not the only ones to vote for senior class slates.
Another issue was the location and hours of the poll
ing places. A concern raised by Senator Bambi Markel
was that the Lagunita poll was not open at all on Thursday
and therefore on the second day of voting there was no
polling place north of Tresidder. Patrick O'Reilly, elec
tions commission member, said the poll was not opened
because the poll watcher did not show up.
Others complained that the Meyer Library voting
place was kept open past the advertised time. O'Reilly
said he acted as commissioner in allowing it to stay open.
Much discussion followed on past precedent and its
relation to the recent election. Senator Mark Epstein
quoted past elections commissioner Doug Mitchell as
saying he left a poll open past the advertised time to be
sure enough students voted to pass the fee assessments.
Graduate Senator Michael Calabrese said he had re
ceived complaints from many law students becuase
there had been no polling place at the law school.
Brian Mariscal, former elections commissioner, said

the decision of poll placement was based on last year's
turnout and expense. But graduate Senator David
Daleke said that the spirit of the new districting for grad
uate students was to tell them "the ASU can do some
thing for you." He said, "Grad students were forgotten
(in this election) and I don't want to see that ever happen
again."
The other main issue was the overall fairness of the
election results. Senator Mark Epstein, also a member of
the victorious (COP) slate, cited statements by past elec
tions commissioners and the Election Review Board's
book as evidence that the problems with the recent
election were not entirely unusual.
However former commissioner Doug Mitchell said,
"to validate this election is to validate mistakes. An elec
tion's not that hard to run." He noted the need for dif
ferent graduate and undergraduate ballots and the need
to keep complete lists of students who voted and match
the number of votes to the number of signatures.
Mitchel said the use of pieces of paper as ballots (which
was done at the Meyer Library poll until additional
ballots arrived) was highly irregular.
Graduate Senator James McGrath said he had not seen
any proof from the problems mentioned above that the
election results were invalid. "I have not seen any proof
or accusation that there was tampering with the ballots."
Senator Rod Beckstrom, also a member of the vic
torious COP slate, said the election contestation "is a
case of someone who lost trying to call a technicality,"
and noted that no senior class slates nor senators pro
tested the results.
Michael Lighty, member of the unsuccessful COP
slate, told the Daily he expected the Senate to validate
the election. "I think it was expected. It was a question of
power. The senate sat in judgement of itself and judged
itself as good."
Lighty added, "We (the CCLW slate) did this (pro
tested the results) honestly, out of the belief that the
ASSU has to be held accountable. We reject the implica
tion that it was our self interest."
In other business the senate voted to put a constitu
tional amendment on the April 28-29 ballot which in
corporates measure A, allowing fee assessment refunds
only to those students who vote.

torious COP slate, said the election contestation "is a
case of someone who lost trying to call a technicality,"
and noted that no senior class slates nor senators pro
tested the results.
Michael Lighty, member of the unsuccessful COP
slate, told the Daily he expected the Senate to validate
the election. "I think it was expected. It was a question of
power. The senate sat in judgement of itself and judged
itself as good."
Lighty added, "We (the CCLW slate) did this (pro
tested the results) honestly, out of the belief that the
ASSU has to be held accountable. We reject the implica
tion that it was our self interest."
In other business the senate voted to put a constitu
tional amendment on the April 28-29 ballot which in
corporates measure A, allowing fee assessment refunds
only to those students who vote.
