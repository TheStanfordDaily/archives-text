# Stanford grad will ride in space shuttle
## Female astronaut chosen 
### 
Sally Ride, a physicist with four
degrees from Stanford, will be
cdme the first American woman
and second woman ever in space
when the seventh NASA space
shuttle goes into orbit next April.
A specialist in radar astronomy,
Ride, 30, will join the Challenger's
four-person crew as mission spe
cialist. With Air Force Lt. Col John
Fabian, she will handle the scien
tific tasks on the mission. This will
include putting three satellites
into orbit.
In 1978, NASA selected Ride.as
one of 35 astronauts out of more
than 8000 applicants for the posts.
Guion Bluford, an Air Force lieu
tenant colonel also selected in this
round, will be the first black to
participate in an American space
flight.
Ride received B.A. degrees in
physics and English in 1973, and
earned a master's degree in phys
ics here two years later. She
earned her doctorate in
astrophysics in 1978. Since her ap
pointment as an astronaut in 1978,
pictures and news clippings of her
have filled a bulletin board in the
Plasma Physics Laboratory where
she shared an office while a grad
uate student.
John Madey, a senior research
associate in the physics depart
ment, said that everyone in the
department was delighted with
the announcement. "It was a ma
jor accomplishment to be

selected in the first place," he
said. He added that Ride had once
worked on theoretical calculation
with him on a free electron laser
project in the Plasma Physics Lab
oratory.
Before transferring to Stanford,
Ride was enrolled at Swarthmore
College in Pennsylvania. She was

an excellent tennis player, accord
ing to Swarthmore's then Dean of
Admissions Fred Hargadon. "She
ran me all over the court,"he re
called.
However, she soon discovered
that "I didn't have quite the dis
cipline it takes to practice tennis
eight hours a day,"and spent the
remainder of her undergraduate
career playing IM sports and writ
ing and editing articles for wom
en's sports magazines.
While working for her doc
torate, Ride read an article in the
Daily which said that NASA was
looking for shuttle astronauts. She
said she hoped that she had not
been selected because she was a
woman, but because she was a sci
entist. .
Ride's specialty is the study of X
ray stars (stars which give off high
amonuts of X-ray radiation) and
how those rays are absorbed by
clouds in space. Because the at
mosphere makes them difficult to
study from earth, X-ray
astronomers generally rely on
space satellites and space-borne
telescopes. Ride's space shuttle is
expected to carry a large tele
scope suitable for studying these
St.* s on board.

cosmonaut, v/as the first woman
to enter space; she flew alone in
the Vostok 6 space capsule for 71
hours in June 1963.


Salfy Ride
