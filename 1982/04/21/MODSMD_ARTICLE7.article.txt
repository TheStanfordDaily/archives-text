# Noon speakers differ on arms issues

Though he called for a ban on all
testing of nuclear weapons as the first
and "most achievable" step toward
disarmament, retired Rear Admiral
Eugene Carroll told a noon rally
against nuclear arms build-up yester
day that he "did not think disarma
ment possible within our lifetime."
Carroll joined speakers Peter
Faulkner, a former strategic air com
mand pilot, and Michael Shuman, a
third-year law student, in calling for
nuclear disarmament and urging
support of the California Nuclear
Freeze Initiative. Approximately 150
people attended the rally.
Shuman, who is writing a book on
the topic, called arms control "irrele
vant" and asked the audience to look
beyond the proposed freeze.
Faulkner concentrated on a local
angle of the arms control issue: the
Lockheed P-3 Orion submarine
hunter airplanes that fly over Stan
ford are armed with nuclear torpe
does. He urged the audience to de
mand an environmental impact
statement from the government on

the global "effect of a 15 kiloton tor
pedo on a Russian sub with armed
nuclear weapons."
Shuman said that "arms control
negotiations resolve the easy issues
first," and "by the time negotiators
are ready to deal with the fundamen
tal issues nobody is interested in arms

control any more."
"We face two possible worlds: one
with all nations nuclear, or none."
Shuman said. "Take your pick, but a
world without nuclear weapons is
the only one that works."
Shuman said that arms control
begs the debate because equality in
weapons is problematic. "Disarma
ment is a much more exciting and
simpler principle," he continued
Shuman said he supports the idea
of an international government and
police force and asked listeners to
think beyond the freeze and start
working for "an international par
liament."
Carroll took a different approach.
"There is agreement in writing at the
United Nations that the only basis of
a United States-Soviet relationship is
peaceful coexistence, that the most
pressing objective is complete dis
armament," he said.
Carroll, who now serves as the
Deputy Director of the Center for
Defense Information, a non-partisan
private group in Washington D.C.,
said that both the United States and
the Soviet Union have agreed in con

cept to the principle of on-site in
spection â€” a frequent area of dispute
in past arms control agreements.
"I do not understand why we
aren't at the conference table right
now," Carroll said, adding that the
only task remaining is that of "ham
mering out the details."
The next step to disarmament, ac
cording to Carroll, will be to cease
development and deployment of the
new weapons, and only then will
"the final step" of strategic arms re
ductions be possible. " But that can
not be negotiated till part one is ne
gotiated," he said.
Carroll said that the Nuclear
Freeze campaign has already had an
impact but urged more action
through education and letter writing
campaigns. "At least he (the presi
dent) knows what you are thinking/'
he said.
Entitled "The Importance of In
volvement in Arms Control," the ral
ly was organized by the Stanford
Arms Control and Disarmament Fo
rum as part of Weapons Crisis Week
'82.
