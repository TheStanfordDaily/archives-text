# States struggle over budget cuts
## 
### Hartford Courant 
Washington — While Washington
dawdles over the federal budget, gov
ernors and legislators in state capitals
throughout the nation are biting a bitter
fiscal bullet.
The result: nearly half the 50 states may
end up raising taxes this election year to
cope with the recession and Reagan ad
ministration cuts in federal aid to states,
counties and cities.
In varying degrees, most of the states are
facing a fiscal crisis of one sort or another.
More than 20 states raised gasoline taxes
last year in an effort to keep up with de
teriorating streets and highways. Two
more have joined the list this year.
Even before the nation's governors sent
their state-of-the-state messages and
budgets to legislatures this year, two ex
perts of the National Conference of State
Legislatures wrote this grim outlook:
"With their revenues buffeted by the na
tional recession, the majority of states en
tered 1982 either in deficit or teetering on
the brink of deficit."
The experts, Steven Gold, director of the
group's Intergovernmental Finance
Project, and Karen Benker, a research ana
lyst, said the situation was likely to turn
even bleaker than expected because state
budgets already in place did not account
for a deep or prolonged recession.
"Fiscal stress can be found in all parts of
the country, but New England, the Great
Lakes states and the Southeast seem to be
in the worst shape," Gold and Benker said.
As they face a blitz of fiscal pressures,
state governments have had to eat into
their budget surpluses, if they had them,
cut back on programs, raise taxes and
pare down their own work forces.
The few states that do not have severe fi
nancial strains, including Wyoming, Mon
tana and Texas, are those living off of the
bounty of severance taxes on oil, coal, nat
ural gas and minerals. But even there, all is
not gravy. Recent cutbacks in domestic oil
production and stabilization of petroleum
prices have cut into expected revenues in

some of those states.
The political irony of 1982 for governors
and legislators is that their federal coun
terparts — members of Congress can go
home this year and tell their constituents
they helped President Ronald Reagan cut
their federal taxes.
Most state legislators up for election this
vear not only cannot make such claims, but
they will have to face heat for raising state
taxes merely to keep state services at ac
customed levels, or worse yet, to maintain
services at reduced levels.
Compounding the problem for state leg
islators this year was the requirement they
reapportion both legislative and con
gressional districts in their states to ac
count for population shifts as refl6Cted by
the 1980 census.
Reapportionment is always a con
troversial and painful chore for legisla
tures, but it was especially so this year in
many states where financially strapped ur
ban areas lost population to the suburbs.
This factor figured In a major battle just
concluded in the Florida Legislature to
raise the state sales tax from 4 percent to 5
percent.
Conservative rural legislators fought the
tax. Cities and counties, also hit with feder
al cutbacks, wanted their share of any new
funds. The tax hike finally got through, but
only after sponsors agreed to share half the
increase, an estimated $770 million a year,
with cities and counties.
All in all, toiling in state government
these days is not a happy chore. Consider
this:
• The recession has cut deeply into the
revenues states get from their own taxes.
This problem has been aggravated by the
Reagan tax cut because many states "pig
gyback" their state personal and corporate
income taxes onto the federal tax. Unless
they took specific action this year, the Rea
gan tax cut triggered a corresponding state
tax cut as well. Those states that refused to
pass this bonus tax reduction on to their
taxpayers face charges of undermining
Reagan's economic recovery program.

To cope with a growing demanded
governments and shrinking tax source,
extraordinary number of states areraii
state taxes in an election year Benker
the legislators' conference said eight J
are considering sales-tax increases
year, three are debating higher perso
income taxes, and at least 15 states hav
passed, or are considering, increasesi
other levies such as corporate incom,
cigarettes and tobacco, severance andeas
oline taxes.
"Basically, it's just a shifting of then
base," Benker said. "The cutbacks of fed
eral aid are not the primary cause of stati
fiscal distress, but they exacerbateit.Thos
cutbacks could hardly have corneal
worse time in view of the anemic statet
state budgets."
It is a tenet of political life that youd
not raise taxes in an election year, panicti
larly in a year like 1982, when the majorit
of governors, 36 of the-.i, and all or mo<
members of 45 legislatures are upforre
election. So, the rule is to anticipateno
tax needs and get them out of the wayi
least a year before the elections.
