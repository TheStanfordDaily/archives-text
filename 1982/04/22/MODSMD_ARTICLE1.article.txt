ASSU officials raised doubt yester
day as to whether the COP has the
constitutional power to veto the sen
ate motion that approved the elec
tion Tuesday night by a 10-7 vote and
also as to whether the COP will veto
the decision if it is able.
The doubt centers on whether
Tuesday's senate motion certifying
the election result can be considered
a bill or resolution. The ASSU Con
stitution states, "The Council of Pres
idents shall have the right to veto any
bill or resolution passed by the Sen
ate."
Senate Chair Dave Phelps told the
Daily last night that he had not
looked at the specific documents and
could not say whether the COP had
the right to veto the senate certifica
tion, but he said that in case of a con
troversy, the senate would have the
authority to interpret the Constitu
tion.
COP member Chris Greene also
emphasized last night that the Senate
would have the right to decide the
question. Greene would not com
ment on whether or not the COP was
likely to veto the senate action,
saying that he had not had a chance
to sit down with the rest of the COP
and talk about it.
Most ASSU officials contacted by
the Daily yesterday were confident
that the COP would not veto the sen
ate decision. A veto, if it did come,
would need to be signed by three
COP members by Friday evening.
The petition requesting the refer
endum must be submitted with the
signatures of five percent of the stu
dent body by this afternoon for the
referendum to appear on the April 28
and 29 ballot.
The grievances listed by the BSU
are mostly the same as those sub
mitted by the CCLW slate and by
Buhl, including unscheduled polling
place hours and improper handling
of ballots.
