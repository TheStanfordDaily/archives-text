# Egypt exasperated by talks

### Washington Post 
Cairo, Egypt — Egyptian officials are barely
hiding their frustrations in dealing with Israel in
the last agonizing days before the final Israeli
withdrawal from the Sinai.
The sudden deluge of Israeli allegations of
Egyptian violations of their 3-year-old peace
treaty, the request for a new written pledge from
Cairo to respect the letter and spirit of the pact
and the constant questioning of Egypt's good in
tentions have frayed official nerves here close to
the breaking point.
"These are the longest 10 days of my life," re
marked one Egyptian official involved in the ne
gotiations with Israel.
After a debate among Egypt's policy-makers,
the decision was made to "cool it," one official
said, and not to respond in kind to what Egyp
tians see as the Israeli campaign of casting Egypt
in the role of a spoiler and questionable peace
partner. In this way, they hope to avoid saying or
doing anything to make matters worse.
But Foreign Minister Kamal Hassan Ali, in a
brief emotional outburst over the weekend, re
flected the general feeling here when he said Is
rael was violating the treaty far more than Egypt
with its constant threats to delay pulling out and

its refusal to accept arbitration over a brmW
marcation dispute.
The Israeli behavior has served, however
raise the fundamental question of what proj«
really has been made in laying the basisfJ
"normalization" of relations betweentheset
old adversaries that fought it out on the I
tlefield four times and are now striving toset
example of peaceful coexistence for othersl»
tical Arab nations to follow.
"The relations we are having nowwithlw
are considerable," he said, ticking off some
the several dozen agreements, memosofundi
standing and other documents signed by tl
two governments in the past three years."Egy
is doing all she can to assure Israel our relatio
are going smoothly. We want a normal,nam
relationship between two neighboring coui
tries."
The problem, as Egypt sees it, is that Israel
pressing for something more than a "normalr
lationship, one that would not only makeittl
most favored nation in Cairo but also do
Egypt's door to the rest of the Arab world,"
said. The Israelis "want a special rather than
normal relationship, but we are not givinglsri
more than we give to any other country."
