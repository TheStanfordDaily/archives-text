she faces, yet somehow she always has.

her actions are working through or for
feminism, which MacKinnon defined as "the
perspective from the standpoint of all wom
en on social life." She added, "I see myself as
working to create a woman-identified com
munity. In her view, the women's com
munity is arranged on a non-hierarchical
basis.
According to MacKinnon, this is not re
alistic at present because women do not see
their alternatives because these alternatives
do not exist.
The vision and the possibilities must be
seen at the same time. The conditions to see
haven't been created."
In relation to this, MacKinnon has strong
feelings about the ERA.
If the ERA fails, a great many woman may
perceive something about reality — that
they do not occupy the status of citizens."

does not fundamentally
understand what I'm doing
and they are the people who

Catharine MacKinnon

MacKinnon said she believes that ERA
supporters should not give up hope. How
ever, according to her, failure could be a tre
mendous blow to society. She used the
analogy of a woman who tries to punch
against an attacker and then gets raped. She
will feel more despaired about trying any
thing because she is worse off than if she had
never tried at all.
While at Stanford, MacKinnon has been
impressed with the good teaching op
portunities and she also noted that students
have been "fabulous." Some of her best ex
periences here include teaching her course
Sexuality and Legality, and her debate with
Phyllis Schlafly.
Her course was at the Law School and was
open to both law students and under
graduates. MacKinnon said she believes that
the law should be presented in such a way
that a freshman could walk into the class and
understand it with no difficulty.
"Assessing the meaning of the law with re
gards to women and raising questions in a
social and political context," were the main
objectives of the course, according to
MacKinnon.
According to Karen Davis, a research assis
tant who has worked with MacKinnon since
last summer, "Kitty teaches law with a social
critique. Many people don't agree with that,
and people react to being challenged."
Daniel Gunther, a law student in MacKin
non's class last fall, said that the course dif

fered from any he has ever taken. The in
tensity, intellectual risks and high degree of
student participation were all factors that
made the course unique, he said.
"I have never had a teacher who was so
careful in taking her students as presumptive
intellectual equals."
Gunther added that he is highly in favor of
giving MacKinnon a permanent appoint
ment here. "She's given the school a good
deal and I hope she gets it back someday,"
he said.
MacKinnon said she has learned a lot from
interacting with the Law School faculty and
they have shown interest in her work. Addi
tionally, Stanford is unlike almost any other
law school in that there are many people
doing work related to hers.
But MacKinnon stressed, "There is still a
group who does not fundamentally under
stand what I'm doing and they are the peo
ple who are judging me. Because I do some
thing unlike what they do, it's hard for them
to comprehend."
In spite of this, recently-released eval
uations on MacKinnon's course showed that
the course received the highest "intellectual
stimulation"rating of any law school course.
The debate with Phyllis Schlafly is another
of MacKinnon's most favorable experiences
here. She said that she learned a lot from
preparing for the debate and also from re
ceiving responses afterward.
"It was the first time I've had a chance to
say what I wanted to say in the right context. I
had the experience of freedom. I've never
felt freer in my entire life."
Another very positive element in MacKin
non's experience here has been the male
students.
"They have been exceptional, serious,
taken astounding risks, been open and done
brilliant work," she said.
In MacKinnon's view, men have an impor
tant role in feminism because "they have ac
cess to forms of power from which women
have been excluded. Their support carries us
a great deal further. They have this power
and when they realize it, that's when they
become the most powerful on a femimist
basis. When they realize it in a critical way,
they should seek to use it or destroy it. Then
they become crucial to the feminist strug
gle."
MacKinnon said she sees that many of the
men here have tried to make feminism a part
of themselves.
Davis commented that MacKinnon "is
happy when she sees men respond to and
question the fact that there is male domi
nance."
"For men, feminism has redrawn lines of
self-conception, often in painful ways," as
serted MacKinnon.
A few things MacKinnon would have liked
to do here include teaching a seminar on
pornography with Andrea Dworkin. How
ever, MacKinnon said that this would "not
be possible in the current cli.nate at Stan
ford."
If she were going to continue at the Law
School, she would also like to be part of a

Women's Law Journal. Yet MacKinnon does
not know what the prospects for this will be
without her. There are others here who
share her interest, but not as their primary
work.
Currently, MacKinnon is teaching an un
dergraduate course entitled Feminism
and/or Socialism. The course is designed to
synthesize two radically different per
spectives of how society is organized — on a
theory of gender or economics. While they
both address the notion of inequality,
feminism and Marxism are vastly different
theories and in some ways competing.
MacKinnon said she believes that a syn
thesized theory is possible because many
people have found the theories unsatisfying
when considered separately.
It seems that students taking her class this
quarter have done so not only because they
are interested in feminism, but also because
they are impressed by MacKinnon.
Sophomore Mary Sauer said MacKinnon's
intelligence drew her toward the class.
"MacKinnon has mastered the art of speak
ing," she explained.
Sophomore Caroline Streeter said she is
taking the course because she also is im
pressed by the way MacKinnon expresses
herself. Streeter added that although
MacKinnon is a professional, she does not
put herself above her students.
"It's as if we were all adults getting togeth
er to discuss a volatile issue," she said.
Similarly, senior Sharon Silverstein, a stu
dent in MacKinnon's classes and a staff
member of the Women's Center, said she
believes that MacKinnon's courses are "a fo

rum where men and women with energy can
talk to each other."
"MacKinnon has inspired others to have
the courage to say what they believe,"
added.
Those associated with MacKinnon are im
pressed by her responsiveness to students!
Jeanne Barkey, a research assistant for
MacKinnon's current course, said that
MacKinnon "has touched so many people,
both inside and outside of classes. IMe
learned how to think about things in a dif
ferent way, learned to question things arjd
learned ways of thin king about or putting to
gether things I've been feeling all my life.";
MacKinnon expressed hopes that feminist
activities will continue after she leaves, or
else "I would feel the work I had done would
be very superficial. I think of myself as part of
a community."
She said she believes that people should
organize with each other to promote
feminism by stating their views loudly and |n
writing.
"Universities are more responsible to indi
viduals. They see groups as demented. Fpr
instance, they respond better to letters than
to petitions," she said.
MacKinnon has made an impact on the
Stanford community through her courses,
lectures and interactions with students. '
"She's gotten a lot started and I hope I can
be a part of carrying that on. The core of stu
dents who have worked with her will coh
tinue to do the work that needs to be done. I
hope people takes what she says and learn
from herand with herso that it will becomea
part of our lives. I hope that each person lives
a little bit differently," Barkey said.

pornography with Andrea Dworkin. How
ever, MacKinnon said that this would "not
be possible in the current cli.nate at Stan

If she were going to continue at the Law
School, she would also like to be part of a

Women's Law Journal. Yet MacKinnon does
not know what the prospects for this will be
without her. There are others here who
share her interest, but not as their primary
work.
Currently, MacKinnon is teaching an un
dergraduate course entitled Feminism
and/or Socialism. The course is designed to
synthesize two radically different per
spectives of how society is organized — on a
theory of gender or economics. While they
both address the notion of inequality,
feminism and Marxism are vastly different
theories and in some ways competing.
MacKinnon said she believes that a syn
thesized theory is possible because many
people have found the theories unsatisfying
when considered separately.
It seems that students taking her class this
quarter have done so not only because they
are interested in feminism, but also because
they are impressed by MacKinnon.
Sophomore Mary Sauer said MacKinnon's
intelligence drew her toward the class.
"MacKinnon has mastered the art of speak
ing," she explained.
Sophomore Caroline Streeter said she is
taking the course because she also is im
pressed by the way MacKinnon expresses
herself. Streeter added that although
MacKinnon is a professional, she does not
put herself above her students.
"It's as if we were all adults getting togeth
er to discuss a volatile issue," she said.
Similarly, senior Sharon Silverstein, a stu
dent in MacKinnon's classes and a staff
member of the Women's Center, said she
believes that MacKinnon's courses are "a fo

rum where men and women with energy can
talk to each other."
"MacKinnon has inspired others to have
the courage to say what they believe,"
added.
Those associated with MacKinnon are im
pressed by her responsiveness to students!
Jeanne Barkey, a research assistant for
MacKinnon's current course, said that
MacKinnon "has touched so many people,
both inside and outside of classes. IMe
learned how to think about things in a dif
ferent way, learned to question things arjd
learned ways of thin king about or putting to
gether things I've been feeling all my life.";
MacKinnon expressed hopes that feminist
activities will continue after she leaves, or
else "I would feel the work I had done would
be very superficial. I think of myself as part of
a community."
She said she believes that people should
organize with each other to promote
feminism by stating their views loudly and |n
writing.
"Universities are more responsible to indi
viduals. They see groups as demented. Fpr
instance, they respond better to letters than
to petitions," she said.
MacKinnon has made an impact on the
Stanford community through her courses,
lectures and interactions with students. '
"She's gotten a lot started and I hope I can
be a part of carrying that on. The core of stu

tinue to do the work that needs to be done. I
hope people takes what she says and learn
from herand with herso that it will becomea
part of our lives. I hope that each person lives
a little bit differently," Barkey said.

Catharine MacKinnon

MacKinnon said she believes that ERA
supporters should not give up hope. How
ever, according to her, failure could be a tre
mendous blow to society. She used the
analogy of a woman who tries to punch
against an attacker and then gets raped. She
will feel more despaired about trying any
thing because she is worse off than if she had
never tried at all.
While at Stanford, MacKinnon has been
impressed with the good teaching op
portunities and she also noted that students
have been "fabulous." Some of her best ex
periences here include teaching her course
Sexuality and Legality, and her debate with
Phyllis Schlafly.
Her course was at the Law School and was
open to both law students and under
graduates. MacKinnon said she believes that
the law should be presented in such a way
that a freshman could walk into the class and
understand it with no difficulty.
"Assessing the meaning of the law with re
gards to women and raising questions in a
social and political context," were the main
objectives of the course, according to
MacKinnon.
According to Karen Davis, a research assis
tant who has worked with MacKinnon since
last summer, "Kitty teaches law with a social
critique. Many people don't agree with that,
and people react to being challenged."
Daniel Gunther, a law student in MacKin
non's class last fall, said that the course dif

fered from any he has ever taken. The in
tensity, intellectual risks and high degree of
student participation were all factors that
made the course unique, he said.
"I have never had a teacher who was so
careful in taking her students as presumptive
intellectual equals."
Gunther added that he is highly in favor of
giving MacKinnon a permanent appoint
ment here. "She's given the school a good
deal and I hope she gets it back someday,"
he said.
MacKinnon said she has learned a lot from
interacting with the Law School faculty and
they have shown interest in her work. Addi
tionally, Stanford is unlike almost any other
law school in that there are many people
doing work related to hers.
But MacKinnon stressed, "There is still a
group who does not fundamentally under
stand what I'm doing and they are the peo
ple who are judging me. Because I do some
thing unlike what they do, it's hard for them
to comprehend."
In spite of this, recently-released eval
uations on MacKinnon's course showed that
the course received the highest "intellectual
stimulation"rating of any law school course.
The debate with Phyllis Schlafly is another
of MacKinnon's most favorable experiences
here. She said that she learned a lot from
preparing for the debate and also from re
ceiving responses afterward.
"It was the first time I've had a chance to
say what I wanted to say in the right context. I
had the experience of freedom. I've never
felt freer in my entire life."
Another very positive element in MacKin
non's experience here has been the male
students.
"They have been exceptional, serious,
taken astounding risks, been open and done
brilliant work," she said.
In MacKinnon's view, men have an impor
tant role in feminism because "they have ac
cess to forms of power from which women
have been excluded. Their support carries us
a great deal further. They have this power
and when they realize it, that's when they
become the most powerful on a femimist
basis. When they realize it in a critical way,
they should seek to use it or destroy it. Then
they become crucial to the feminist strug
gle."
MacKinnon said she sees that many of the
men here have tried to make feminism a part
of themselves.
Davis commented that MacKinnon "is
happy when she sees men respond to and
question the fact that there is male domi
nance."
"For men, feminism has redrawn lines of
self-conception, often in painful ways," as
serted MacKinnon.
A few things MacKinnon would have liked
to do here include teaching a seminar on
pornography with Andrea Dworkin. How

Her course was at the Law School and was
open to both law students and under
graduates. MacKinnon said she believes that
the law should be presented in such a way
that a freshman could walk into the class and
understand it with no difficulty.
"Assessing the meaning of the law with re
gards to women and raising questions in a
social and political context," were the main
objectives of the course, according to
MacKinnon.
According to Karen Davis, a research assis
tant who has worked with MacKinnon since
last summer, "Kitty teaches law with a social
critique. Many people don't agree with that,
and people react to being challenged."
Daniel Gunther, a law student in MacKin
non's class last fall, said that the course dif

fered from any he has ever taken. The in
tensity, intellectual risks and high degree of
student participation were all factors that
made the course unique, he said.
"I have never had a teacher who was so
careful in taking her students as presumptive
intellectual equals."
Gunther added that he is highly in favor of
giving MacKinnon a permanent appoint
ment here. "She's given the school a good
deal and I hope she gets it back someday,"
he said.
MacKinnon said she has learned a lot from
interacting with the Law School faculty and
they have shown interest in her work. Addi
tionally, Stanford is unlike almost any other
law school in that there are many people
doing work related to hers.
But MacKinnon stressed, "There is still a
group who does not fundamentally under
stand what I'm doing and they are the peo
ple who are judging me. Because I do some
thing unlike what they do, it's hard for them
to comprehend."
In spite of this, recently-released eval
uations on MacKinnon's course showed that
the course received the highest "intellectual
stimulation"rating of any law school course.
The debate with Phyllis Schlafly is another
of MacKinnon's most favorable experiences
here. She said that she learned a lot from
preparing for the debate and also from re
ceiving responses afterward.
"It was the first time I've had a chance to
say what I wanted to say in the right context. I
had the experience of freedom. I've never
felt freer in my entire life."
Another very positive element in MacKin
non's experience here has been the male
students.
"They have been exceptional, serious,
taken astounding risks, been open and done
brilliant work," she said.
In MacKinnon's view, men have an impor
tant role in feminism because "they have ac
cess to forms of power from which women
have been excluded. Their support carries us
a great deal further. They have this power
and when they realize it, that's when they
become the most powerful on a femimist
basis. When they realize it in a critical way,
they should seek to use it or destroy it. Then
they become crucial to the feminist strug
gle."
MacKinnon said she sees that many of the
men here have tried to make feminism a part
of themselves.
Davis commented that MacKinnon "is
happy when she sees men respond to and
question the fact that there is male domi
nance."
"For men, feminism has redrawn lines of
self-conception, often in painful ways," as
serted MacKinnon.
A few things MacKinnon would have liked
to do here include teaching a seminar on
pornography with Andrea Dworkin. How
ever, MacKinnon said that this would "not
be possible in the current cli.nate at Stan
ford."
If she were going to continue at the Law
School, she would also like to be part of a

Women's Law Journal. Yet MacKinnon does
not know what the prospects for this will be
without her. There are others here who
share her interest, but not as their primary
work.
Currently, MacKinnon is teaching an un
dergraduate course entitled Feminism
and/or Socialism. The course is designed to
synthesize two radically different per
spectives of how society is organized — on a
theory of gender or economics. While they
both address the notion of inequality,
feminism and Marxism are vastly different
theories and in some ways competing.
MacKinnon said she believes that a syn
thesized theory is possible because many
people have found the theories unsatisfying
when considered separately.
It seems that students taking her class this
quarter have done so not only because they
are interested in feminism, but also because
they are impressed by MacKinnon.
Sophomore Mary Sauer said MacKinnon's
intelligence drew her toward the class.
"MacKinnon has mastered the art of speak
ing," she explained.
Sophomore Caroline Streeter said she is
taking the course because she also is im
pressed by the way MacKinnon expresses
herself. Streeter added that although
MacKinnon is a professional, she does not
put herself above her students.
"It's as if we were all adults getting togeth
er to discuss a volatile issue," she said.
Similarly, senior Sharon Silverstein, a stu
dent in MacKinnon's classes and a staff
member of the Women's Center, said she
believes that MacKinnon's courses are "a fo

rum where men and women with energy can
talk to each other."
"MacKinnon has inspired others to have
the courage to say what they believe,"
added.
Those associated with MacKinnon are im
pressed by her responsiveness to students!
Jeanne Barkey, a research assistant for
MacKinnon's current course, said that
MacKinnon "has touched so many people,
both inside and outside of classes. IMe
learned how to think about things in a dif
ferent way, learned to question things arjd
learned ways of thin king about or putting to
gether things I've been feeling all my life.";
MacKinnon expressed hopes that feminist
activities will continue after she leaves, or
else "I would feel the work I had done would
be very superficial. I think of myself as part of
a community."
She said she believes that people should
organize with each other to promote
feminism by stating their views loudly and |n
writing.
"Universities are more responsible to indi
viduals. They see groups as demented. Fpr
instance, they respond better to letters than
to petitions," she said.
MacKinnon has made an impact on the
Stanford community through her courses,
lectures and interactions with students. '
"She's gotten a lot started and I hope I can
be a part of carrying that on. The core of stu
dents who have worked with her will coh
tinue to do the work that needs to be done. I
hope people takes what she says and learn
from herand with herso that it will becomea
part of our lives. I hope that each person lives
a little bit differently," Barkey said.

According to MacKinnon, this is not re

do not exist.

In relation to this, MacKinnon has strong
feelings about the ERA.

MacKinnon said she believes that ERA
supporters should not give up hope. How
ever, according to her, failure could be a tre
mendous blow to society. She used the
analogy of a woman who tries to punch
against an attacker and then gets raped. She
will feel more despaired about trying any
thing because she is worse off than if she had
never tried at all.
While at Stanford, MacKinnon has been
impressed with the good teaching op

have been "fabulous." Some of her best ex
