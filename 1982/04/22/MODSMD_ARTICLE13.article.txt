.to want disarmament before a minimum of
.common agreement on fundamentals is as absurd as
to want people to go undressed in winter. Let the
"weather be warm, and people will discard their
clothes readily and without committees to tell them
how to undress."
These words, quoted in last Sunday's New York
Times magazine, were written in 1973 by Salvador de
•Madariaga of Spain, chairman of the League of Na
tions Disarmament Commission and Disarmament
Conference. They express his frustration with dis
armament progress and hint at the factors which con
tinue today to stall arms reduction efforts; agreement
on "shared goals" is practically nonexistent; laymen
remain confused as to the technology and verifaction
factors involved and must delegate their representa
tion to politicians and so-called experts said to under
stand the mitigating factors and ramificatons; a con
sensus of the status quo itself often seems unob
tainable, with arsenal strengths exagerated and/or
• minimized by rhetoric.
The weather has been getting warmer lately, here at
Stanford; fast-tanning bodies around campus are
happily shaking off the winter quarter blues as well as
those top layers of clothes.
Also emerging, it seems, is evidence of at least some
measure of common agreement about the unaccep
tibility of the spectre of nuclear war.
Banners displayed in front of dormitories call for
"mutual disarmament for we the people": a simple,
yet poignant statement of concern about a potentially
perilous future.
Last week, the Daily sponsored a nuclear arms fo
rum, with the idea of soliciting a wide range of opin
ion about the nuclear issue. While the solutions of
fered in the guest columns were not identical, we did
not receive a single viewpoint approving of the cur
rent arms build-up.

On Saturday, about 1000 people met at Hoover
Tower and marched to the Palo Alto City Hall "to sym
bolize the need to join together and work toward
solutions for global survivial."
Here and across the country this week, concerned
citizens are meeting in forums, in debates and in dis
cussion. The national movement is known as Ground
Zero Week, a program of discussions and events de
signed to educate and involve the American people
in the issue of preventing nuclear war. Here at Stan
ford, the week is being called Weapons Crisis Week
and a similar format of events has and continues to ad
dress this same concern. Other events include de
bates between arms control experts, speeches ad
dressing specific areas of arms control like economic
consequences and the psychological aspects of living
in a nuclear age, and films addressing the nuclear
arms issue; today at noon will be a rally in White Plaza
with David Brower Friends of the Earth; tomorrow,
Phi Psi House is sponsoring a Dance for Disarmament,
to feature student speakers and rally support for a
demonstration of the groundswell of opposition to
the current arms build-up.
The goals of Ground Zero Week may be idealistic,
may seem too simplistic to take their place amid the
bargaining chip mentality and diplomatic rhetoric
which characterize contemporary debate. And yet, it
is the education and discussion of options which
emerge within this climate which is raising the nucle
ar issue on the national agenda and may someday al
low for that "common agreement on fundamentals"
of which Madariaga spoke.
We hope the future will bring more definitive
statements about "popular will" and mainstream
goals; statements well-educated and well-con
sidered. The Daily supports the goals and philosophy
of Ground Zero Week. The weather is getting
warmer.
