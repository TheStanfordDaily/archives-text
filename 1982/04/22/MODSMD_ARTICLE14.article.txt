# Alex talks plane in KC-135 crisis
## 
### 
The New York Times reported on
Saturday, April 70 that Secretary of
State Alexander Haig's trip to London
to negotiate on the Falkland Islands
crisis was delayed eight hours be
cause the Secretary refused to fly in
the windowless plane (the KC-135)
that the White House had assigned to
him. Following is an "interpretive"
account of the affair.
7 p.m.
"What do you mean, I've been as
signed to fly to London in a KC-135? I
hardly think it appropriate that I,
Alexander Haig, Secretary of State of
the United States, should have to fly
in a converted, windowless cargo
plane in order to get to London and
avert a major war! I expressly said
that I wanted a window seat, a double
bed, cable TV and my "Commie In
vaders" video game and you give me
a KC-135? I want a plane with win
dows and I want it now."
"Excuse me, Mr. Secretary, but a
Mr. Begin wants to speak with you
about the West Bank and Lebanon
and the Sinai and ..."
. "Can't you see I'm busy? Tell him
to call back later."
"Now where was I? Oh yes, the
plane. Another think I want to know
is the name of the wise-guy who or
dered the in-flight movies. Everyone
knows that All the President's Men
and Hearts and Minds are two of my
least favorite movies. I want you to
replacc them with Patton and Alex
ander the Great... Yes, I know you
can get any one of the Bonzo series,
but seven times is enough already.
And don't tell you-know-who that I
said that."
"Excuse me, Mr. Secretary, but a
Mr. Duarte wants to speak with you.
He says that an extreme right wing
coalition is forming in El Salvador and
it looks like they're going to exclude
all of the moderates from the govern
ment and ..."
"Look, I'm busy, all right? Tell him
to call me later. Now get me Ed
Meese on the phone."
"Hello, Ed? Al here. Look, Ed, I've
got to fly all the way to Argentina to
negotiate on this Falkland thing and
all they gave me was a KC-135 with no
windows and no TV and I was won
dering if you weren't, er, if you and
Ron weren't going to be using Air
Force One then maybe I could ...
yes, I know it's reserved for the Presi
dent but I thought that maybe just
this once I could, you know, special
circumstances and a 11... N0?... Yes,
of course I understand, protocol and
all that. I guess I'll see you when I get
back. Right. Bye."
"Damn that Meese. He thinks he's
running the whole show up there or
something."
"Mr. Secretary, we've located a
Congressional delogation that's due
to take off for Latin America in a
VC-137 and we've got Congressman
Wright, the leader of the delegation,
on the phone."
"Great. Put him on. Hello, Jim? this
is Al Haig and I'm in control here ...
that's right, I'm in control here ...
No, Ron is fine and yes, I have read
the constitution; listen, I'm in the
control tower here and was wonder
ing if I could borrow your VC-137 for

my trip to London and Argentina? I
need the communications equip
ment on your plane and I'll trade you
for my KC-135... yours has mechan
ical difficulties? Only a few hours
worth, right? Well, that doesn't both
er me if it doesn't bother you. you
will? Great. Say hello to Roberto for
me. Thanks. Bye."

4 Now where was /?
Oh yes, the plane.
Another thing I want
to know is the name
of the wise-guy who
ordered the in-flight
movies. Everyone
knows that 4 All the
President's Men'and
4 Hearts and Minds'
are two of my least
favorite movies. I
want you to replace
them with 44 Patton"
and 44 Alexander the
Great..."'

"I'm sorry to bother you again, Mr.
Secretary, but Deng Xiaoping is call
ing and he's threatening to break dip
lomatic relations with the United
States over our arms sale to Taiwan
and..."
"How many times do I have to tell
you that I'm busy averting a major

war? Now stop bothering me with
these petty problems and have him
call me later. Now look, the press is
waiting outside, so I'm going to make
a statement explaining the delay and
then I want you to position them so
that they can get pictures of me wav
ing out the window as I take off. As
long as we've finally got a plane with
windows we might as well use it.
• • •
"Mr. Secretary, could you tell us
why there's been such a long delay?"
"I'm afraid that we've had some
problems finding a plane with the
necessary communications equip
ment and when we finally got one it
needed some repairs, but it looks like
we'll be on our way very soon now."
"Mr. Secretary, how do you an
swer your critics who say that you've
become too personally involved in
the Falklands crisis to deal with press
ing problems in the Mideast and
Latin America?"
"Just let me say that the Falklands
crisis poses the greatest threat to
world peace at this time and I have
thus decided to give it my immediate
personal attention. I think that it's
imperative that we move with utmost
speed to resolve this crisis before it
becomes a shooting war. I'm sure
that our British and Argentine friends
will appreciate the high priority we
have giveri this problem and the
speed with which we have reacted."
3 a.m.
Secretary of State Haig and his en
tourage leave for London in a
VC-137.
