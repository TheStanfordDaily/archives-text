## Laboratory animals tortured 
### 
In "First Vote on Animal Bill" (Daily, April 1), the Uni
versity administration deplores the success of a bill to
ban the use of pound animals in laboratories. Don't
worry, they say, "only 10 percent are pets."
Actually, almost all pound animals are, or have been,
pets. The rest of the article continues, with equal ac
curacy, to detail how good laboratory animals have it at
Stanford and what a painless, happy, protected existence
they lead.
Reality, alas, is rather different.
Today's use of laboratory animals may well constitute
the greatest animal torture the world has ever seen. It is
institutionalized and astronomical. An estimted 100 mil
lion animals a year are used in U.S. labs alone (much of it
financed, in the billions, by our tax monies). Many of
those animals, obviously incapable of the informed con
sent we so treasure for ourselves, are subjected to in
tense and protracted agony.
At best, laboratory animals are deprived of their natu
ral hatytat, freedom of movement or the ability to en
gage in any of their normal pursuits. At worst, they are
victimized by burning, scaling, freezing, starvation, elec
trical shock, bone- and organ-crushing, often without
anesthesia.
A fond supposition has it that "there must be a law
against that." In effect, there is not.
The Animal Welfare Act does not even cover the most
used laboratory animals — rates and mice. It forbids
"needless" pain, but leaves the judgement of need up to
the researcher. Its inspection provision, ludicrously in
adequate at best, is being cut in the 1983 Reagan budget
from an annual $4.9 to $1.5 million, thus virtually
eliminating it. In most states — and California is one of
them — anti-cruelty laws do not apply to research in
stitutions.
What has grown up under our noses, while we worship
on the unimpeachable altar of science and think that our
civilization has progressed from the Dark Ages, is a vast,
powerful empire, with enormous finances, entrenched
special interests, prestigious spokespersons and the most
potent legislative lobby after the oil companies that
jealously guards its hegemony, fights tooth and nail
against all outside interference and does more damage
to animals than most freelance sadists combined.
Terrible things go on in animal labs and Stanford's are
no exception.
Monkeys, with electrodes implanted in their brains,
held there by dental cement, picked and tore at their in
juries until one monkey had half his face torn off.
At the opening ceremonies of what is now the Psy
chology building a live cat was left, spread-eagled on a
board, with its brain exposed, for the edification of vis
itors who filed by with such jocularities as: "There is one
that won't catch another mouse."
Some 20-30 cats and kittens, in cages in a room redo
lent with urine and excrement, had each had one eye
sewn shut. Some were tearing, some pustulant. The justi
fication, incredibly, was that the findings might prove
useful to an airline pilot stricken by a midflight stroke.
In the Medical Center, mice had their blood drawn re
peatedly through a syringe from their eyes before being
thrown back into their cages. The experiment was
scrapped.
Just a few months ago an animal caretaker, incincerat
ing dead animals, saw his helper pick up from the floor a

live mouse and drop it, too, into the incinerator,
In the dog labs, bitches gave birth in kennels filled with
excrement. Dogs are infested with fleas and ticks.
Cockroaches are everywhere, including the animals
food. Some dogs have been locked in small cages for
years and are never let out. The noise level in theirken
nels exceeds OSHA standards by far. While surgery is
done under anesthesia, post-operative analgesia is rare
If you don't want pound animals used like this, get in
touch with your California senator and assembly repre
sentative.
Animal experimentation is not something to which the
public is invited. Whistle blowers almost automatically
lose their jobs and are, consequently, rare. A
searcher, asked whether the conduct of experiments!!
ever monitored, replied: "Of course not. Youwouldnot
want to act the policeman to your colleagues."
University President Donald Kennedy has likened
animal rights advocates to "the Moral Majority, right-to
lifers and theme-first movement" — a statement as
absurd as it is revelatory of a hostility to the cause of
animal welfare that is disturbing for the chief of an in
stitution as massively engaged in animal research asis
Stanford.
The archetypal question, "Would you rather it weft
your baby?" does not get to the core. The real question
is: Is it npcessary at all? The supposition that it is all car
ried on for the benefit of humanity is a myth. Of amoun
tainous lot of research, the only beneficiary is the re
searcher. The same forces that makes academe go roui*
move the need for publications, desire for grants, to
ey, promotion, prestige. While in other fields the mari
futile exercises in fulfillment of such aims are
harmless, in biomedicine, where animal work still car
ried its special aura of greater validity, it inflicts pain,ter
ror and stress on helpless creatures.
If animal research and testing were to excluse all self
serving experiments, those demonstrating what is al
ready well proven and those without the remotest ap
plicability to human use, educated guesses assume that
that might do away with 80 percent of all animal a
perimentation done today.
Modern technology has provided numerous alter
natives to in vivo research that are cheaper, more re
liable (animal work has given us heart transplants, butit
has also given us thalidomide) and do not involve such
suffering. There is a federal bill being formulated nowto
promote, through government funding, the use of and
search for such non-sentient alternatives as tissue cul
tures, computer and mechanical models. People want
ing to support it should write to Rep. Doug Walgren,
Chair, Sub-Committee on Science Research and TEch
nology, U.S. House of Representatives, Washington,
D.C. 20515 and their congressional representatives. It
will take a lot of letters to counteract the pressures of the
hospitals, universities, drug and cosmetic companies.
This is not an age in which the moral imperative is scoring
victories over vested interests, but this is as good a cause
as there is.
April 24th is World Day for Laboratory Animals, an in
ternational event. A group doing informational leaf-let
ting at the Stanford Shopping Center this Saturday wi

In "First Vote on Animal Bill" (Daily, April 1), the Uni
versity administration deplores the success of a bill to
ban the use of pound animals in laboratories. Don't
worry, they say, "only 10 percent are pets."
Actually, almost all pound animals are, or have been,
pets. The rest of the article continues, with equal ac
curacy, to detail how good laboratory animals have it at
Stanford and what a painless, happy, protected existence
they lead.
Reality, alas, is rather different.
Today's use of laboratory animals may well constitute
the greatest animal torture the world has ever seen. It is
institutionalized and astronomical. An estimted 100 mil
lion animals a year are used in U.S. labs alone (much of it
financed, in the billions, by our tax monies). Many of
those animals, obviously incapable of the informed con
sent we so treasure for ourselves, are subjected to in
tense and protracted agony.
At best, laboratory animals are deprived of their natu
ral hatytat, freedom of movement or the ability to en
gage in any of their normal pursuits. At worst, they are
victimized by burning, scaling, freezing, starvation, elec
trical shock, bone- and organ-crushing, often without
anesthesia.
A fond supposition has it that "there must be a law
against that." In effect, there is not.
The Animal Welfare Act does not even cover the most
used laboratory animals — rates and mice. It forbids
"needless" pain, but leaves the judgement of need up to
the researcher. Its inspection provision, ludicrously in
adequate at best, is being cut in the 1983 Reagan budget
from an annual $4.9 to $1.5 million, thus virtually
eliminating it. In most states — and California is one of
them — anti-cruelty laws do not apply to research in
stitutions.
What has grown up under our noses, while we worship
on the unimpeachable altar of science and think that our
civilization has progressed from the Dark Ages, is a vast,
powerful empire, with enormous finances, entrenched
special interests, prestigious spokespersons and the most
potent legislative lobby after the oil companies that
jealously guards its hegemony, fights tooth and nail
against all outside interference and does more damage
to animals than most freelance sadists combined.
Terrible things go on in animal labs and Stanford's are
no exception.
Monkeys, with electrodes implanted in their brains,
held there by dental cement, picked and tore at their in
juries until one monkey had half his face torn off.
At the opening ceremonies of what is now the Psy
chology building a live cat was left, spread-eagled on a
board, with its brain exposed, for the edification of vis
itors who filed by with such jocularities as: "There is one
that won't catch another mouse."
Some 20-30 cats and kittens, in cages in a room redo
lent with urine and excrement, had each had one eye
sewn shut. Some were tearing, some pustulant. The justi
fication, incredibly, was that the findings might prove
useful to an airline pilot stricken by a midflight stroke.
In the Medical Center, mice had their blood drawn re
peatedly through a syringe from their eyes before being
thrown back into their cages. The experiment was
scrapped.
Just a few months ago an animal caretaker, incincerat
ing dead animals, saw his helper pick up from the floor a

live mouse and drop it, too, into the incinerator,
In the dog labs, bitches gave birth in kennels filled with
excrement. Dogs are infested with fleas and ticks.
Cockroaches are everywhere, including the animals
food. Some dogs have been locked in small cages for
years and are never let out. The noise level in theirken
nels exceeds OSHA standards by far. While surgery is
done under anesthesia, post-operative analgesia is rare
If you don't want pound animals used like this, get in
touch with your California senator and assembly repre
sentative.
Animal experimentation is not something to which the
public is invited. Whistle blowers almost automatically
lose their jobs and are, consequently, rare. A
searcher, asked whether the conduct of experiments!!
ever monitored, replied: "Of course not. Youwouldnot
want to act the policeman to your colleagues."
University President Donald Kennedy has likened
animal rights advocates to "the Moral Majority, right-to
lifers and theme-first movement" — a statement as
absurd as it is revelatory of a hostility to the cause of
animal welfare that is disturbing for the chief of an in
stitution as massively engaged in animal research asis
Stanford.
The archetypal question, "Would you rather it weft
your baby?" does not get to the core. The real question
is: Is it npcessary at all? The supposition that it is all car
ried on for the benefit of humanity is a myth. Of amoun
tainous lot of research, the only beneficiary is the re
searcher. The same forces that makes academe go roui*
move the need for publications, desire for grants, to
ey, promotion, prestige. While in other fields the mari
futile exercises in fulfillment of such aims are
harmless, in biomedicine, where animal work still car
ried its special aura of greater validity, it inflicts pain,ter
ror and stress on helpless creatures.
If animal research and testing were to excluse all self
serving experiments, those demonstrating what is al
ready well proven and those without the remotest ap
plicability to human use, educated guesses assume that
that might do away with 80 percent of all animal a
perimentation done today.
Modern technology has provided numerous alter
natives to in vivo research that are cheaper, more re
liable (animal work has given us heart transplants, butit
has also given us thalidomide) and do not involve such
suffering. There is a federal bill being formulated nowto
promote, through government funding, the use of and
search for such non-sentient alternatives as tissue cul
tures, computer and mechanical models. People want
ing to support it should write to Rep. Doug Walgren,
Chair, Sub-Committee on Science Research and TEch
