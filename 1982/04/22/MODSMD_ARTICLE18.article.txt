## Put Nuclear Freeze on the Stanford ballot 
### 
"We, the students of Stanford Uni
versity, do hereby urge that the gov
ernment of the United States pro
pose to the government of the Soviet
Union that both countries agree to
immediately halt the testing, produc
tion and deployment of all nuclear
warheads, missiles and delivery sys
tems."
As is well known by now, the ASSU
recently made a clumsy error which
may imperil many campus organiza
tions. The student government broke
its own rules by forgetting to give 14-
day notice in the Daily that fee
assessments would be voted on in to
day's election. To correct the mis
take, the Fee Assessment ballot has
been rescheduled for a second elec
tion April 28 and 29.
This unintentional splitting of the
election means that each component
will receive a smaller turnout than it
would have otherwise. Most regret
ably it presents the discouraging pos
sibility that less than 20 percent of
Stanford students will show up to
vote in the fee assessment election,
which according to ASSU rules, ren
ders the ballot meaningless.
What I offer here is a modest pro
posal by which the ASSU can vin
dicate itself: I suggest that the Senate
place the sentence with which I

began this editorial as a referendum
on the April 28-29 ballot.
The Stanford Bilateral Nuclear
Weapons Freeze iniative, if you will,
adds a new dimension to what might
otherwise be just another boring
election. It virtually guarantees that
enough students will vote in the fee
assessment balloting to make it bind
ing.
Some people argue that the con
trol of nuclear weapons is the only
important issue of our day, since our
very survival depends on it. In any
case, it is vital that our generation
take a lead role in stopping nukes, or
else there will be no generations af
ter ours. The beauty of the freeze is
'hat it permits the average citizen to
do something about the insane nu
c ear arms race. In particular, a Stan
ford referendum is certain to garner
national media attention. Assuming
't wins handsomely, it will provide
momentum for the California nucle
ar freeze initiative (worded similarly),
w iic a ready has enough signatures
to appear on the state ballot in No
vem er. It will also put some pres
sure on the government officials who
a se y assert that a freeze would be
detrimental to our security.
A few colleges have already taken
course. Perhaps the first was

Hampshire College in Amhers
Mass., which on April 28,1981 vo
934-21 in favor of a freeze, a whop
ping 98 percent majority. Brown uni
versity has tentatively set a rejere
dum for April 22. The point is tha
referendum at Hampshire, a sin
experimental college, could easi y
ignored, but world-class univrrs'
like Brown and Stanford are m
to write off. 112 .
Finally, it would be appropna
the Stanford referendum to be
in the same ballot as the <
assessment election, since j* 10
the student organizations whoi
sponsored events which ig
the dangers of nuclear war a
pend on the fee assessments o
tinued funding. You can e oc
pose the nuclear arms race a
vor future events on important
at the same time. wn
