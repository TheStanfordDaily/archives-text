# Writing â€” more than a way of life, to some it is life
## 
### Elizabeth Sweigert 
An air of excitement mingles with the aroma
of pipe smoke in Professor William Rivers's small
office in Redwood Hall of the Communication
Department. Rivers, dedicated teacher and pro
lific writer, overflows with energy and drive.
Rosy face framed by stacks of books and papers
which rise from the undiscernable surface of a
desk, Rivers leans forward eagerly to speak of
himself and his beliefs.
"I wanted to be a writer ever since I was elev
en," said Rivers who has composed pieces for
newspapers and magazines and written or col
laborated on more than 30 books. Rivers ma
jored in journalism at Louisiana State University,
which recently named him to the 1982 Alumni
Hall of Distinction as one of their most outstand
ing alumni. Upon graduating he began working
for a newspaper.
Rivers said he found that he wanted to write
longer pieces. So he began to write for maga
zines. Still limited, in magazine articles, to 3000
to 4000 words, he soon moved on to writing
books. He also obtained a teaching position at
LSU. He wanted to be on campus so that he
could write.
Rivers nodded emphatically that "you can
write for months at a good university." He pre
fers writing longer pieces because as a writer,
one is "more likely to see where society is
going" and is able to grasp a bigger picture than
a journalist could.
His latest book The Other Government, which
is now bound and scheduled for publishing on
June 14, is "the best book I've ever written!"
Eyes shining, Rivers spoke of his book which
evaluates the role of the Washington D.C. press
corps. In crisp, tight prose, Rivers discusses the
importance of the press and its role as public in
former.
Rivers, who said he always works on many
projects simultaneously is now writing his first
novel.
"I've always wanted to write fiction," he said
thoughtfully, "But I've always put it off. I've
been promising myself for 20 years to write a
novel." Writing fiction, said Rivers, is a big

change from his usual work.
As a non-fiction writer, he observed, one is
tied to facts. "My novel is somewhat auto
biographical," he explained. "Of course ev
erything a writer writes would have to be. But for
the rest, I'm trying to imagine what would have
happened." The basic theme of the novel has to
do with a conflict between communism and cap
italism, but Rivers, said, "I don't know just what's
going to happen yet!"
Rivers has completed over 14 books in the past
four years and looks forward to publishing four
more in November. Working on so many
projects at once is the secret of his love for writ
ing, he said.
"If I worked on one book continually, chapter
by chapter, I'd get bored. I get tired of that. So I
finish a chapter of one book and then switch to
another."
Being a professor at a university like Stanford,
Rivers believes, is the ideal environment for a
writer. One of the values for him of teaching
here is the amount of time he gets to spend on
his writing. Required to teach five courses in
three quarters, Rivers bunches most of the
courses into one quarter. In this way, he has
more time to write the remainder of the year.
He emphasized that when he teaches, he
spends a lot of time on each student. He criti
ques every paper turned in with three to five
typed pages of comments.
Though spending more time on his writing,
Rivers considers himself a teacher first.
"If I make a lot of money on all of these books
I'm doing," he smiled, "I'll never retire. I don't
mind the loneliness of writing, but when I get up
in the morning I need to talk with people. I need
contact with people all the time." He said he
finds great satisfaction in commenting ex
tensively on papers and in keeping each stu
dent's individual problems in mind.
This quarter Rivers instructs Humor as Com
munication. He teaches this class of about 100
students purely "for joy."
However, all may not have seemed too joyous
for Rivers in the past years. Since 1970 Rivers has
been close to death by kidney failure,

pulmonary embolism and numerous strokes. He
lives today because his sister donated one of her
kidneys to him.
"How did I survive all those assaults by
Death?" wrote Rivers in an essay. 'Humor me,
Death. "It has taken me years to arrive at an an
swer and I can express it in one word: Humor."
Revealing what he has discovered to be a great
truth, Rivers said he has "found out what humor
really is." Through teaching the humor class he
can share his discovery with the students.
"If I just tried to explain humor, I could go on
and on ... they'd all go to sleep! So I try to il
lustrate everything I say with something funny,"
Rivers said.
The class's 19-page syllabus sparkles with
amusing comments. Assignments for the class
include telling the best joke the student knows
to the rest of the class. Students listen to lectures,
view Charlie Chaplin Chaplin on film, watch a
professional stand-up comedian and may even
perform themselves.
Through his brushes with death, Rivers said he
has learned that humor is the one thing dist
inguishing human beings from any other being.
"Only humans can have humor. If I were to
face another disease or death, I would laugh,"
said Rivers is his sandpapery voice. "It seems to
me," he said, "that humor and death are
linked." Laughter, is the cure, he explained. To
explain humor and his beliefs on the subject,
Rivers has expressed himself in his usual fashion.
His book Humor Me, Death will be published
later this year.
Rivers gives credit to humor for much of his
present well-being.
"I am enjoying my life and working harder
than ever before" he wrote.
But not only humor keeps him going. When
asked what was his favorite project on which he
has ever worked, Rivers replied, as if no other
answer could have served, "Writing!"
The interview is over. And as the door to
Rivers's small office shuts on the stacks of books
and cardboard boxes overflowing with papers,
the clack of typewriter keys begins once more.

PROLIFIC PROFESSOR - William Rivers of the Communication D*
partment is most comfortable behind his typewriter. An energetic
writer, Rivers is known to work on a number of books simultane
ously.
An air of excitement mingles with the aroma
of pipe smoke in Professor William Rivers's small
office in Redwood Hall of the Communication
Department. Rivers, dedicated teacher and pro
lific writer, overflows with energy and drive.
Rosy face framed by stacks of books and papers
which rise from the undiscernable surface of a
desk, Rivers leans forward eagerly to speak of
himself and his beliefs.
"I wanted to be a writer ever since I was elev
en," said Rivers who has composed pieces for
newspapers and magazines and written or col
laborated on more than 30 books. Rivers ma
jored in journalism at Louisiana State University,
which recently named him to the 1982 Alumni
Hall of Distinction as one of their most outstand
ing alumni. Upon graduating he began working
for a newspaper.
Rivers said he found that he wanted to write
longer pieces. So he began to write for maga
zines. Still limited, in magazine articles, to 3000
to 4000 words, he soon moved on to writing
books. He also obtained a teaching position at
LSU. He wanted to be on campus so that he
could write.
Rivers nodded emphatically that "you can
write for months at a good university." He pre
fers writing longer pieces because as a writer,
one is "more likely to see where society is
going" and is able to grasp a bigger picture than
a journalist could.
His latest book The Other Government, which
is now bound and scheduled for publishing on
June 14, is "the best book I've ever written!"
Eyes shining, Rivers spoke of his book which
evaluates the role of the Washington D.C. press
corps. In crisp, tight prose, Rivers discusses the
importance of the press and its role as public in
former.
Rivers, who said he always works on many
projects simultaneously is now writing his first
novel.
"I've always wanted to write fiction," he said
thoughtfully, "But I've always put it off. I've
been promising myself for 20 years to write a
novel." Writing fiction, said Rivers, is a big

change from his usual work.
As a non-fiction writer, he observed, one is
tied to facts. "My novel is somewhat auto
biographical," he explained. "Of course ev
erything a writer writes would have to be. But for
the rest, I'm trying to imagine what would have
happened." The basic theme of the novel has to
do with a conflict between communism and cap
italism, but Rivers, said, "I don't know just what's
going to happen yet!"
Rivers has completed over 14 books in the past
four years and looks forward to publishing four
more in November. Working on so many
projects at once is the secret of his love for writ
ing, he said.
"If I worked on one book continually, chapter
by chapter, I'd get bored. I get tired of that. So I
finish a chapter of one book and then switch to
another."
Being a professor at a university like Stanford,
Rivers believes, is the ideal environment for a
writer. One of the values for him of teaching
here is the amount of time he gets to spend on
his writing. Required to teach five courses in
three quarters, Rivers bunches most of the
courses into one quarter. In this way, he has
more time to write the remainder of the year.
He emphasized that when he teaches, he
spends a lot of time on each student. He criti
ques every paper turned in with three to five
typed pages of comments.
Though spending more time on his writing,
Rivers considers himself a teacher first.
"If I make a lot of money on all of these books
I'm doing," he smiled, "I'll never retire. I don't
mind the loneliness of writing, but when I get up
in the morning I need to talk with people. I need
contact with people all the time." He said he
finds great satisfaction in commenting ex
tensively on papers and in keeping each stu
dent's individual problems in mind.
This quarter Rivers instructs Humor as Com
munication. He teaches this class of about 100
students purely "for joy."
However, all may not have seemed too joyous
for Rivers in the past years. Since 1970 Rivers has
been close to death by kidney failure,

pulmonary embolism and numerous strokes. He
lives today because his sister donated one of her
kidneys to him.
"How did I survive all those assaults by
Death?" wrote Rivers in an essay. 'Humor me,
Death. "It has taken me years to arrive at an an
swer and I can express it in one word: Humor."
Revealing what he has discovered to be a great
truth, Rivers said he has "found out what humor
really is." Through teaching the humor class he
can share his discovery with the students.
"If I just tried to explain humor, I could go on
and on ... they'd all go to sleep! So I try to il
lustrate everything I say with something funny,"
Rivers said.
The class's 19-page syllabus sparkles with
amusing comments. Assignments for the class
include telling the best joke the student knows
to the rest of the class. Students listen to lectures,
view Charlie Chaplin Chaplin on film, watch a
professional stand-up comedian and may even
perform themselves.
Through his brushes with death, Rivers said he
has learned that humor is the one thing dist
inguishing human beings from any other being.
"Only humans can have humor. If I were to
face another disease or death, I would laugh,"
said Rivers is his sandpapery voice. "It seems to
me," he said, "that humor and death are
linked." Laughter, is the cure, he explained. To
explain humor and his beliefs on the subject,
Rivers has expressed himself in his usual fashion.
His book Humor Me, Death will be published
later this year.
Rivers gives credit to humor for much of his
present well-being.
"I am enjoying my life and working harder
than ever before" he wrote.
But not only humor keeps him going. When
asked what was his favorite project on which he
has ever worked, Rivers replied, as if no other
answer could have served, "Writing!"
The interview is over. And as the door to
Rivers's small office shuts on the stacks of books
and cardboard boxes overflowing with papers,
the clack of typewriter keys begins once more.
