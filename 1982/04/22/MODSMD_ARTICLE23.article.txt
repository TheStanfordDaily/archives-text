# PROPOSED REFORM OF THE
## FEE ASSESSMENT SYSTEM VOTE in the ASSU Fee Assessment ELECTION – APRIL 28 & 29 
### 
The A.S.S.Lt. Senate has laboured for 4
months to fashion a reform of the fee
assessment system, as documented
below. The reforms are balanced,
serving equally the needs of student
groups and of individuals. Although
they may appear forbidding and
complex, this complexity is largely
illusionary, since the machinery for
implementing the reforms will be
throughly hidden from all parties.
These reforms are a vast improvement
over our current fee assessment
system, and the Senate encourages you
to read these particulars and save them
for reference during the coming week.
The Siena te will be distributing
additional information before the
election showing how these reforms
would affect your life and the lives of
student groups.
The students of Stanford University
wish to replace Article V, Sections 1
and 2 of the Constitution of the
Association, which presently read:
Articic V: Finances
Scction 1: Association Program Fee
In order for the collection of a program fee, or
general Association fee assessment, to be

assessments, and establishing the per capita

prospective budget and the per capita program
fee must receive the approval of three-fifths of
the members of the Senate present and voting.
A referendum shall be held on the program fee
budget package at the same time as the first
Presidential election in the Spring. The per
capita amount sought for the program fee
assessment, and the prospective budget dividing
the fees, listing the organizations receiving funds
according to it and the percentage of the total
budget to be appropriated to each, must appear
on the ballot. The entire package presented must

those Association members desiring it
