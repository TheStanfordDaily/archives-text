Stanford sophomore Bernie Trilline
stopped out in order to work at Earth Day's
national headquarters in Washington,
LM... It definitely changed my life," said
Trilling, now program director for En
vironmental Volunteers, a Palo Alto-based
environmental education group. "Denis
had a lot to do with why a lot of Stanford
people got involved. He really picked up
on the idea and took charge."
The resulting event may have exceeded
even Hayes expectations, however, as lit
erally millions of people all over the nation
participated in peaceful demonstrations,
fairs, lectures and educational projects,
making it clear to politicians that the en
vironment was an issue with which they
would have to reckon.
Here at Stanford, University President
Kenneth Pitzer endorsed Earth Day ac
tivities as an educational project worthy
of the attention and support of all
citizens. Faculty, staff and students were
encouraged to leave their cars at home
and bicycle, ride, or walk to campus.
Stanford served as the focal point on the
Peninsula for Earth Day activities and
routes to the campus were jammed with
bicycles and horses on the morning of
April 22,1970. By 11 a.m., about 3000 peo
ple were strolling around sunny White
Plaza, looking at various booths of the all
day Environment Fair.
In the twelve years since that day, the
environmental movement has grown
and matured and the populist appeal of an
Earth Day oriented towards massive con
sciousness-raising has been largely re
placed by political lobbying and more so
phisticated tackling of problems. Hayes
himself personifies this change. During a
speech last week outlining alternatives to
U.S. energy policy, the softspoken former
director of the Solar Energy Research In
stitute reflected that his last speaking en
gagement at Stanford had culminated in a
sit-in of the Applied Physics building. "My,

times have changed," Hayes said with a
smile.
Does this mean that people no longer
care about environmental issues? Not at
all, according to Trilling.
"Earth Day was a stage," he said. "Like
many other kinds of issues, environmen
talism went through an awareness stage,
then a stage of trying to really understand
the nature of the problems. This was fol
lowed by the stage we're in now, which
mostly deals with specific action and solu
tions."
Nancy Lindborg, who helped coordi
nate Stanford Earth Day activities in 1980
and now works at the Housing Energy
Conservation Center, agreed that the lack
of thousands of people at such events
doesn't mean that interest has died. "Peo
ple have already gotten concern for the
environment in their minds, at least
around here," she said. "It's not a new hot
issue anymore."
Stanford for Environmental Education
(SEE), in addition to sponsoring Earth
Week programs last week, is also recog
nizing the anniversary of the original Earth
Day by bringing David Brower, founder
and chairman of Friends of the Earth, to
speak in White Plaza at noon today.
According to SEE general coordinator
Dave Kreger, "the spirit of the original
Earth Day is a priceless spirit that deserves
being continued." Brower's topic of nu
clear disarmament demonstrates that
much of that early fervor has been trans
ferred to the arms control issue, because
many consider this to be the ultimate en
vironmental question, he said.
However, Kreger emphasized that
chronic environmental problems should
not be overshadowed by the anti-nuclear
war movement. "In the arms battle, we are
fighting for the very existence of our
planet, but we also have to keep fighting
for a planet worth living on."

The resulting event may have exceeded

participated in peaceful demonstrations,

would have to reckon.
Here at Stanford, University President
Kenneth Pitzer endorsed Earth Day ac
tivities as an educational project worthy
of the attention and support of all
citizens. Faculty, staff and students were
encouraged to leave their cars at home
and bicycle, ride, or walk to campus.
Stanford served as the focal point on the
Peninsula for Earth Day activities and
routes to the campus were jammed with
bicycles and horses on the morning of
April 22,1970. By 11 a.m., about 3000 peo
ple were strolling around sunny White
Plaza, looking at various booths of the all
day Environment Fair.
In the twelve years since that day, the
environmental movement has grown
and matured and the populist appeal of an
Earth Day oriented towards massive con
sciousness-raising has been largely re
placed by political lobbying and more so
phisticated tackling of problems. Hayes
himself personifies this change. During a
speech last week outlining alternatives to
U.S. energy policy, the softspoken former
director of the Solar Energy Research In
stitute reflected that his last speaking en
gagement at Stanford had culminated in a
sit-in of the Applied Physics building. "My,

times have changed," Hayes said with a
smile.
Does this mean that people no longer
care about environmental issues? Not at
all, according to Trilling.
"Earth Day was a stage," he said. "Like
many other kinds of issues, environmen
talism went through an awareness stage,
then a stage of trying to really understand
the nature of the problems. This was fol
lowed by the stage we're in now, which
mostly deals with specific action and solu
tions."
Nancy Lindborg, who helped coordi
nate Stanford Earth Day activities in 1980
and now works at the Housing Energy
Conservation Center, agreed that the lack
of thousands of people at such events
doesn't mean that interest has died. "Peo
ple have already gotten concern for the
environment in their minds, at least
around here," she said. "It's not a new hot
issue anymore."
Stanford for Environmental Education
(SEE), in addition to sponsoring Earth
Week programs last week, is also recog
nizing the anniversary of the original Earth
Day by bringing David Brower, founder
and chairman of Friends of the Earth, to
speak in White Plaza at noon today.
According to SEE general coordinator
Dave Kreger, "the spirit of the original
Earth Day is a priceless spirit that deserves
being continued." Brower's topic of nu
clear disarmament demonstrates that
much of that early fervor has been trans
ferred to the arms control issue, because
many consider this to be the ultimate en
vironmental question, he said.
However, Kreger emphasized that
chronic environmental problems should
not be overshadowed by the anti-nuclear
war movement. "In the arms battle, we are
fighting for the very existence of our
planet, but we also have to keep fighting
for a planet worth living on."
