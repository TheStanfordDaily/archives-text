# Seal slaughters may stop if Europe passes import ban
## 
### Juliet Johnson 
On March 11, the European parliament
passed a motion that would prevent the im
port of goods made from the pelts and blub
ber of young harp and hooded seals by Eu
ropean Economic Community countries. If
the Council of Ministers also approves the
motion, which it is expected to do in the next
few months,. Europe will join the United
States and several other countries in banning
these products.
Bryan Davies, executive director of the In
ternational Fund for Animal Welfare, which
has campaigned vigorously for an end to seal
killing, said that the motion was of major im
portance since its passage would effectively
destroy the European market for seal prod
ucts.
Corinne Dottax of the Sea Shepherd Con
servation Society, an organization which has
dispatched its ship, the Sea Shepherd, to in
terrupt several past hunts, was less optimistic.
"We know they won't stop merely for eco
nomic reasons," she said, adding that the Ca
nadian government officials were prepared
to stockpile surplus harp seal pelts if this be
came necessary to the survival of the harp seal
hunt.
The immature harp seal is covered with a
white fur commercially attractive to the Ca
nadian and Norwegian hunters who come to
Newfoundland in March. Between 100,000

and 180,000 harp seal pups are pursued and
killed by clubbing every year. The hooded
seal is hunted in smaller numbers in Norway
and Canada.
Seal pelts are used primarily in the manu
facture of articles such as key rings, toy seals,
fur hats, ski boots and other luxury goods.
Seal oil is a hidden ingredient in many com
mon products such as margarine, vitamin oil
and animal feed in many European countries.
According to Davies, the passage of the
proposed EEC motion would chiefly affect
France and West Germany, the major markets
outside Norway for seal pelts. Holland and It
aly have already banned seal products, while
in England seal fur is required by law to be
clearly labeled as such.
There has been considerable debate over
the degree of suffering felt by the hunted seal
pups. Canadian government-sponsored re
ports claim that the skull of the immature seal
is paper-thin and that it can be killed human
ely with a single blow.
Dr. William Jordan, a veterinary surgeon
who observed the 1978 hunt for Britain's
Royal Society for the Protection of Animals,
disputes these claims, pointing out that six in
thirteen postmortems he was able to carry
out revealed intact skulls.
In 1981 Canadian fishery officials admitted
that some inexperienced sealers off Prince
Edward Island in Newfoundland had skinned
seals before they were unconscious.
The annual seal slaughters have provoked
considerable public outcry in both Europe
and North America. This March, as in pre
vious years, the International Fund for
Animal Welfare will send its helicopter, the
Blue Goose, to the ice-floes in protest against
the hunt, although Canadian legislation has
severly restricted the freedom of movement
of non-hunters in the area.
