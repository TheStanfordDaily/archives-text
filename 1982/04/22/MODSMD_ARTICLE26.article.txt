tion. In support, he cited a sec
tion of the constitution which
granted members of the COP
power to".. .call special meet
ings of the Association, to es
tablish committees and sub
groups as deemed desirable."
"This is all the authority I
have ever had and that has
been changed in no way what
ever," he said.
Buhl also argued that the
other members of the COP
lacked the constitutional right
to limit his authority as a mem
ber of COP. He cited another
section of the constitution
which read that only "The
Membership of the Associa
tion (University students) shall
have the power to recall the
Council of Presidents . .
Although the constitution
does not specifically state that
each individual COP member
may speak on behalf of the
COP, the present COP had in
formally agreed that each
member could speak for the
council without consulting the
other members, Buhl said.
COP member Chris Greene
confirmed yesterday that the
COP had not stripped Buhl of

any of his constitutional rights
and that the COP had agreed
informally earlier this year to
bestow its authority on each of
its members and to grant each
member the right to speak for
the council and for the student
body as a whole. "The implica
tion was that what we said car
ried the support of at least two
other members," Greene said.
"Tuesday's announcement
was that Fred Buhl no longer
has this right to speak for the
council or for the student
body," Greene said.
"The statement on behalf of
theotherthree membersof the
Council of Presidents at best,
can only be taken as a public
censuring which expressed
their feelings. As all four of us
were acting in accordance with
what we felt was correct — I
can respect that," Buhl said.
Byerwalter said she and fel
low COP members Chris
Greene and Dragan Popov had
stripped Buhl of his right to
speak for the COP because he
did not indicate to them how
actively he would seek to in
validate the election.


Fred Buhl
Buhl said yesterday that he had
told the other COP members on
Monday that he would dissent from
their decision to remain publicly
neutral on the election controversy
and that he might resign if the senate
validated the election. Buhl said he
felt the other COP members primari
ly objected to the appearance of a
story in Tuesday's Daily about his

threat of resignation.
The other COP members had
brought to the senate meeting a pre
pared letter of resignation for him to
sign, Buhl said. He did not resign,
however, after the senate verified the
results because he wanted to con
tinue to represent the interests of the
minority community on campus, he
said.
Buhl said he felt "Dragan and Chris
and Mariann cannot speak for the
minority students on this campus."
