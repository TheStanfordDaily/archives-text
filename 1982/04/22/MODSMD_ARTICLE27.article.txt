Tuesday night, the senate
voted 6-5 to accept the recom

Commission which called for
Kim's disqualification. The
commission said that Kim had
posted election materials in the
Quad and did not remove
them after Election Com

warned him to take them
down.
Kim's spot as an alternate
senator will be filled by Andy
Messing, who finished 21st in
last week's balloting.
