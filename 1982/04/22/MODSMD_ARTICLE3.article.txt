>ly differing opinions last night
erningtheU.S. military build-up
the effects of a nuclear freeze,
e panel of experts debated at
opAuditoriom as part of Ground
• Week activities.
hile Rathjens and Ladd strongly
•cated the freeze as a political
ment urging government lead
to end the nuclear arms race,
lauer denied the government
increasing nuclear arms and
sed the potentially destabilizing
cts of freeze.
ccording to Landauer, the United
es has actually be'en decreasing
uclear capabilities and plans no
ficant increases in the future.
& have less weapons today than
had a decade ago. The total yield
u f weapons is lower. We've been
tinuously and significantly de-
King," he said.
andauer noted that Reagan's
include building half as many
missiles as former President Jim-
Carter had planned, discontinu
the B-1 bomber and retiring a
e number of older weapons.
The money being spent by the
'gan administration, even though
I_■ . .

he may not know it, is being spent for
rapid deployment forces, for spare
parts, for the navy, for increased mili
tary salaries and is not just aimed at
nuclear supremacy, but mostly other
things."
Landauer argued that "decreases
in weapons by a factor of two or three
would not reduce the probability of
nuclear war, nor the effects," and
that there would be"unimaginable"
problems in verifying a drastic reduc
tion in arms.
In addition, Landauer warned that
the freeze proposal might lead to in
creased tensions between the United
States and the Soviet Union and may
backfire with a new call for an in

creased arms build-up.
Rathjens and Ladd disagreed with
Landauer's points, instead insisting
that the government is actually en
gaged in a massive nuclear arms
build-up. They advocated the nucle
ar freeze proposal as an effective first
step towards future arms reductions.
Ladd claimed that both the United
States and the Soviet Union are "be
ginning one of the biggest nuclear
arms build-ups in history. It's been
reliably estimated that the United
States alone plans to build something
on the order of 17,000 new nuclear
warheads in the 1980s and has already
begun that process."
Despite the retirement of many

older nuclear weapons, Ladd insisted
that "in general, the estimates are
that the stockpiles will go up."
"We could afford to stop ourselves
completely right now and wait to see
what they do. It would not pose any
great risks," Rathjens said.
Rathjens emphasized the need for
the freeze as a message to world
leaders."lt is imperative that the peo
ple of this country go on the record
as having said we've had enough of
this utter nonsense, this waste of hu
man resources."
"Rather than challenge the Soviets
to continue the arms build-up, why
don't we challenge them to reverse
the process," Ladd argued.
