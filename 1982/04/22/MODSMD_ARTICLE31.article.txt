Before starting in on the ac
tual review, be forewarned that
the reviewers were presented
with complimentary fishbowls
of tropical alcoholic concoc
tions prepared by our bar
tender, Boris. Therefore, the
following report is a hazy recol
lection of a very fine meal.
Mui Kiang Restaurant is not
your typical mom-and-pop
run Chinese establishment
where a fifth-grade son takes
your order. In fact, Mui Kiang is
a fairly sophisticated, im
pressively-run place to eat. Af
ter 23 years of building a fine
reputation in Hong Kong, Mui

Kiang opened its third branch
in Mountain View. That was
four years ago. Al! the cooks
have been transferred from the
Hong Kong restaurants and
definitely excel at the ; r table.
The food was well-p spared
and delicious.
Mui Kiang offers a varied
menu, six pages long; it has a
wide selection of tropical
drinks (as has been mentioned
— its full bar is complete with
Mai Tais, daiquiris and Scor
pions garnished v/ith plastic
flowers) and every Chinese
food you couH "lagire from
Shark Fin Soup to Lotus Seeds
Pudding. They even offer to ac
commodate special requests

off-the-menu and many of
their dishes are specialties of
the restaurant.
The appetizers were quite
good — we recommend the
spicy Skewered Beef Saday ($3)
and the delicious egg rolls
($2.50). As for entrees, our
waiter suggested the Lemon
Flavored Chicken ($5), which
was coated with a sweet, almost
candied lemon sauce. It was an
interesting taste and a twist to

the usual sweet-and-sour dish.
Mou Shu Pork ($5.25) was espe
cially good — the waiter even
rolled it for us. We also had
Crystal Prawns ($5.75), which
had a slight garlic flavor. We
pressed the manager about the
ingredients in this dish, but he
evaded us skillfully. (Ancient
Chinese secret, huh?) It was
served on a bed of shredded
lettuce and carrots. Snow Peas
and Water Chestnuts ($4.50)
also had a pleasant, hardly-dis
cernable glaze.

The waiters were efficient
and attentive, ready to suggest
tempting house specialties.
There were about 25 tables in
our section of the restaurant,
which didn't include a huge
party and banquet room. De
cor was simple as it is in most
Chinese restaurants; the out
side was especially attractive
with wisteria hanging over a
nicely-lit walkway. Mui Kiang
was a wonderful place to have a
nice dinner — the waiters are
eager to please, the food is real
ly Chinese and it is definitely
one of the better Chinese res
taurants near Stanford.
