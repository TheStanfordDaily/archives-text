For weeks now I've .been
hearing wonderful things
about this restaurant, and my
first visit was not at all an
ticlimactic. The Bangkok
Spoon, specializing in Thai
cuisine, is just the thing for one
fond of the varied, unusual
tastes of Chinese food but
looking for something a bit dif
ferent and, perhaps, more ex
otic.
Thai, or Siamese, cooking
shows a strong influence from
China and India, having
adopted stir-frying as its domi
nant method of cooking from
the former, and a heavy dose of

spices from the latter. Its dishes
are topically less greasy than
their Chinese cousins, and
more varied in presentation.
Basil, coriander and unique
Thai spices are used.
We were quickly seated.
Though the decor is simple,
with wood panelling and Thai
land travel posters, it is tasteful.
Fresh flowers grace the table
with orchids, plants and
wooden implements about the
walls. Do not be alarmed that
chopsticks are not provided;
they are not used in Thailand.
We began with two ap
petizers. The Naked Shrimp
($4.25), barbecued, with a
sauce of cucumbers, scallions,
lemon and coriander was spicy

and not at all oily. We followed
this with a cold Siamese
Sausage Salad (Yum Goon
Chieng, $3.25). The small slices
of sausage were quite sweet
and contrasted well with the
lemon-pungent dressing.
These two spicy dishes made us
doubly appreciative of the im
ported Singha beer, which the
Canadian among us
rated"stout" and quite good.
Other beers, wine and
beverages were also available.
One of the evening's de
lights was the Chicken
Coconut Soup (Thom Kay Gai,
$1.75 per generous serving). It
contained many chunks of very
tender white chicken floating
in a broth laced with coconut

milk, and made pungent by bits
of lemon grass, red pepper,
lime juice, and Thai variety of
ginger.
The house specialty, Peek
Gai Yud Sai ($5.50), was one of
the two entrees rated tops by
our panel of four. Two bone
less marinated fried chicken
wings stuffed with transparent
noodles and spices were
served with diced cucumber
and a ground peanut sauce. A
minor skirmish ensued as we
divied the two wings up among
the four of us — be fore
warned, and order enough!
The Smokey Shrimp ($4.50) is
not yet on the menu, but we
had heard of its existence and
politely asked for it. It con-

tainecl about a dozen shrimp in
a Chinese — style sauce with
scallions, onions and straw
mushrooms, and had a de
licious mild smokey flavor.
•Next we enjoyed the Paht
Thai ($4.25), a very ample dish
of flat rice noodles with bean
sprouts, tiny shrimp, pork and
ground peanuts. The sauce was
tomato-based with a mild fish
flavor'reminiscent of Chinese
oyster sauce. The Beef Curry
($3.50) was not at-all like an In
dian curry, more Ike a beef
stew, with soft pieces of beef,
potato and peanuts. Though
pale by comparison to our oth
er dishes, it provided a contrast
and was quite tasty. We con
cluded our meal with Ram
butan ($0.75) a variety of liche
nut. The bill for a well-satiated
party of four came to $45, tax
included.
We were told by oui waitress
that Suti, the head chef, is now
in Thailand, no doubt seeking
out new dishes. We cm hardly
wait for his return.
