# SIX HAPPINESS

beguiled into many large
mouthfuls before the "spicy"
took over and had us diving for
the water pitcher.
The "shredded pork," unlike
the beef, did not strive for dis
tinctness of flavors. Rather, it
was a blend of pork, peas and
an unidentifiable vegetable
and spices that was a bit spicy
and a fitting contrast in texture
and taste to the rest of the
meal.

On the whole, portions were
generous and the service as
helpful as they could be. We
could only glance, bug-eyed,
at the desert menu that ranged
from glazed banana to jew
elled rice pudding before roll
ing from the room. Prices were
reasonable — $4 for vegetable
dishes, $5 for beef and $6.25 to
$7.25 for seafood. For the more
adventurous, a whole separate
menu of "specialties" is pro
vided ranging from jellyfish to
sea cucumber to fresh squid.
Beer and wine are also served.

The front of the Six Happi
ness Chinese Restaurant may
look something like a bank or
savings and loan — but don't
be deceived. It provides none
of the original five happiness of
ancient Chinese living: pros
perity, high position, long life,
wealth or good luck. What it
does provide is an abundance
of the sixth and newest happi
ness proposed by the owner
himself — "excellent Chinese
dining." Mr. Wong specializes
in Mandarin cooking and has
written two books on the sub
ject. From our experience at his
restaurant, it shows.

As we walked into the room
we immediately noticed the
decorating tiles around the
walls and ceiling despite the
dimness of the lighting. Mrs.
Wong informed us that Mr.
Wong had sent the dimensions
of the building to Taiwan
where the decor had been de
signed. Although we found the
lack of no-smoking sections
and tinny Musak annoying, the
room was large enough to ab
sorb these inconveniences.
Dress of the clientele ranged
from jeans to jackets.
We started our meal with
"sizzling rice soup" — well
worth it if only to hear the
crackling of the dried rice as it

hits the hot broth. The tastes of
the generous portions of
chicken, shrimp and water
chestnuts in the soup were
well-defined. We then moved
to the appetizers. The
"barbeque pork" consisted of
boneless slices cooked very
tenderly with a sauce light
enough to be complementary
without drowning the taste of
the meat. There too, portions
were generous.
The "sweet and spicy cole
slaw" looked innocent
enough, but beware of the red
Chinese writing alongside the
English translation on the
menu! The "sweet" had us

Shanghai is a lot closer to
Stanford than most people
think. In fact, it's about 7000
miles closer. Just one block
south of Stanford Avenue on El
Camino Real, Shanghai Restau
rant is a well-kept secret.
Although there's nothing
fancy about the place, you
won't be disappointed by the
wide range of selections, the
authentic Szechuan flavor, the
speedy service or the hearty
tea. However, you may find the
food to fall a little short of the
quality you would expect at a
moderately priced Chinese
restaurant.
We began our meal in typical
fashion with an order of egg
rolls ($1.95 for three) which

were more than adequate, but
nothing to write home about.
Other appetizers ranged in
price from $1.75 for Fried Won
Ton to $5.50 for the Assorted
Hot Platter.
The snap crackle popping
Sizzling Rice Soup ($3.25 for

two) sounded better than it
tasted. The rice got too soggy
too fast, and the pork sections
were gristly.
Main courses were some

thing of an improvement. Our
selections included Snow Peas
Beef, Cashew Nuts Chicken
and Lemon Chicken ($4.75
each). All the dishes were ap
pealing, and the meat portions
plentiful. The cashew chicken
was a particularly pleasant
choice with just the right blend
of chicken chunks and crunchy
.nuts. The sauce was a delicate
yet tangy creation. The beef
dish was quite a bit heavier, but
nevertheless skillfully pre
pared.
All in all, Shanghai's prox
imity to Stanford makes it a
worthy contender in the Chi
nese food category. You could
do a lot better, however, by
driving a mile or two down the
road.

were more than adequate, but
nothing to write home about.
Other appetizers ranged in
price from $1.75 for Fried Won
Ton to $5.50 for the Assorted
Hot Platter.
The snap crackle popping
Sizzling Rice Soup ($3.25 for

two) sounded better than it
tasted. The rice got too soggy
too fast, and the pork sections
were gristly.
Main courses were some

thing of an improvement. Our
selections included Snow Peas
Beef, Cashew Nuts Chicken
and Lemon Chicken ($4.75
each). All the dishes were ap
pealing, and the meat portions
plentiful. The cashew chicken
was a particularly pleasant
choice with just the right blend
of chicken chunks and crunchy
.nuts. The sauce was a delicate
yet tangy creation. The beef
dish was quite a bit heavier, but
nevertheless skillfully pre
pared.
All in all, Shanghai's prox
imity to Stanford makes it a
worthy contender in the Chi
nese food category. You could
do a lot better, however, by
driving a mile or two down the
road.

beguiled into many large
mouthfuls before the "spicy"
took over and had us diving for
the water pitcher.
The "shredded pork," unlike
the beef, did not strive for dis
tinctness of flavors. Rather, it
was a blend of pork, peas and
an unidentifiable vegetable
and spices that was a bit spicy
and a fitting contrast in texture
and taste to the rest of the
meal.

On the whole, portions were
generous and the service as
helpful as they could be. We
could only glance, bug-eyed,
at the desert menu that ranged
from glazed banana to jew
elled rice pudding before roll
ing from the room. Prices were
reasonable — $4 for vegetable
dishes, $5 for beef and $6.25 to
$7.25 for seafood. For the more
adventurous, a whole separate
menu of "specialties" is pro
vided ranging from jellyfish to
sea cucumber to fresh squid.
Beer and wine are also served.

The front of the Six Happi
ness Chinese Restaurant may
look something like a bank or
savings and loan — but don't
be deceived. It provides none
of the original five happiness of
ancient Chinese living: pros
perity, high position, long life,
wealth or good luck. What it
does provide is an abundance
of the sixth and newest happi
ness proposed by the owner
himself — "excellent Chinese
dining." Mr. Wong specializes
in Mandarin cooking and has
written two books on the sub
ject. From our experience at his
restaurant, it shows.

As we walked into the room
we immediately noticed the
decorating tiles around the
walls and ceiling despite the
dimness of the lighting. Mrs.
Wong informed us that Mr.
Wong had sent the dimensions
of the building to Taiwan
where the decor had been de
signed. Although we found the
lack of no-smoking sections
and tinny Musak annoying, the
room was large enough to ab
sorb these inconveniences.
Dress of the clientele ranged
from jeans to jackets.
We started our meal with
"sizzling rice soup" — well
worth it if only to hear the
crackling of the dried rice as it

hits the hot broth. The tastes of
the generous portions of
chicken, shrimp and water
chestnuts in the soup were
well-defined. We then moved
to the appetizers. The
"barbeque pork" consisted of
boneless slices cooked very
tenderly with a sauce light
enough to be complementary
without drowning the taste of
the meat. There too, portions
were generous.
The "sweet and spicy cole
slaw" looked innocent
enough, but beware of the red
Chinese writing alongside the
English translation on the
menu! The "sweet" had us

Shanghai is a lot closer to
Stanford than most people
think. In fact, it's about 7000
miles closer. Just one block
south of Stanford Avenue on El
Camino Real, Shanghai Restau
rant is a well-kept secret.
Although there's nothing
fancy about the place, you
won't be disappointed by the
wide range of selections, the
authentic Szechuan flavor, the
speedy service or the hearty
tea. However, you may find the
food to fall a little short of the
quality you would expect at a
moderately priced Chinese
restaurant.
We began our meal in typical
fashion with an order of egg
