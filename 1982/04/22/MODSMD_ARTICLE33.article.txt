# SIX HAPPINESS

beguiled into many large
mouthfuls before the "spicy"
took over and had us diving for
the water pitcher.
The "shredded pork," unlike
the beef, did not strive for dis
tinctness of flavors. Rather, it
was a blend of pork, peas and
an unidentifiable vegetable
and spices that was a bit spicy
and a fitting contrast in texture
and taste to the rest of the
meal.

On the whole, portions were
generous and the service as
helpful as they could be. We
could only glance, bug-eyed,
at the desert menu that ranged
from glazed banana to jew
elled rice pudding before roll
ing from the room. Prices were
reasonable â€” $4 for vegetable
dishes, $5 for beef and $6.25 to
$7.25 for seafood. For the more
adventurous, a whole separate
menu of "specialties" is pro
vided ranging from jellyfish to
sea cucumber to fresh squid.
Beer and wine are also served.
