sour beef, lemon chicken
and crispy duck.
The menu, which features
Szechuan, Mandarin, and
Shanghai specialties, fea
tures several house recom
mendations. These include
the Imperial Dinner for two
($8.50 per person), the
Gourmet Dinner for two
($7.50 per person) and the
Combination Plate ($4.50
per person).
The Imperial Dinner con
sists of fried prawns, an egg
roll, fried won ton, hot and
sour soup, Kung Pao
Chicken, Mongolian beef,
and fried rice. The Gourmet
Dinner serves up chicken
salad, won ton soup,
almond chicken, sweet and
sour pork, and fried rice.
The restaurant, which is
one large room separated
by small partitions and
hanging plants, seats 70 in
doors. Like many area res
taurants, it also offers patio
dining. We ate early Mon
day night and so seating
posed no problem.
Our waiter was both effi
cient and friendly; yet he al
lowed us to eat at a leisurely
pace.
The dining area itself was
quiet and dimly lit. Owner
Chu described it as "very
good for couples" and "ro
mantics."
The restaurant also offers

a take-out service.
