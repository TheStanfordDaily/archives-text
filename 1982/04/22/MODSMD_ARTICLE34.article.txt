sour beef, lemon chicken
and crispy duck.
The menu, which features
Szechuan, Mandarin, and
Shanghai specialties, fea
tures several house recom
mendations. These include
the Imperial Dinner for two
($8.50 per person), the
Gourmet Dinner for two
($7.50 per person) and the
Combination Plate ($4.50
per person).
The Imperial Dinner con
sists of fried prawns, an egg
roll, fried won ton, hot and
sour soup, Kung Pao
Chicken, Mongolian beef,
and fried rice. The Gourmet
Dinner serves up chicken
salad, won ton soup,
almond chicken, sweet and
sour pork, and fried rice.
The restaurant, which is
one large room separated
by small partitions and
hanging plants, seats 70 in
doors. Like many area res
taurants, it also offers patio
dining. We ate early Mon
day night and so seating
posed no problem.
Our waiter was both effi
cient and friendly; yet he al
lowed us to eat at a leisurely
pace.
The dining area itself was
quiet and dimly lit. Owner
Chu described it as "very
good for couples" and "ro
mantics."
The restaurant also offers

a take-out service.
3345 El Camino Real
Palo Alto
Even if I hadn't gotten a
good fortune cookie
message ("Life to you is a
dashing and bold adven
ture"), I would have left the
China Lion Restaurant with
a nice feeling.
After pulling off El
Camino during rush hour,
we were anything but
rested. But as we settled into
the comfortable, almost
opulent, surroundings at
China Lion, we were instant
ly relaxed.
We sipped tea and eyed
the two large aquariums
near our table and tem
porarily forgot approaching
mid-terms. After all, one of
the fish was swimming up
side-down!
We quickly and greedily
addressed the task at hand
— choosing a few items
from the large menu. But
once we accepted the fact
that our stomachs could not
handle all 60 entrees, the
decision became easier.
Between us, we chose the
shredded chicken salad a la
Chinese appetizer ($3.95),
egg flower soup ($.95), Mu
Shu pork ($3.55), shrimp
with cashew nuts ($5.75),
and shrimp-fried rice
($3,25).
The salad consisted of fine
chicken shreds with lettuce,
crisp rice vermicelli,
crushed almonds, and
sesame; it provided a light,

refreshing start tolhe meal.
The egg flower soup was
both tasty and a good vege
tarian choice. Small vegeta
bles and bean curd squares
enhanced the flavorful
broth.
An ample serving of Mu
Shu pork, an elegant — and
popular — Mandarin dish
prepared with egg and
shredded vegetables, was
also declared delicious. My
friend particularly enjoyed
the plum sauce which ac
companied the dish. She
spread the sauce and the
pork over Mandarin pan
cakes (30 cents each), prop
erly preparing a concoction
which resembled crepes.
The shrimp with cashew
nuts was mixed with crisp
green peppers and celery
and served in a spicy garlic
sauce. Although the shrimp
were outnumbered by the
vegetables, they were none
theless plump and flavorful.
Our shrimp-fried rice
(yes, we both admit to a
weakness for shrimp) was a
mixture of soft-cooked rice
toss-fried with miniature
shrimp, whipped egg,
chopped scallions and small
peas.
China Lion also offers sev
eral varieties of chow mein
(pan-fried egg noodles,
bamboo shoots and vegeta
bles) and of soup noodles.
According to owner
Jessica Chu, the most popu
lar dishes include hot and
