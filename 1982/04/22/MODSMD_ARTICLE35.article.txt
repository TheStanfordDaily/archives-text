Chef Chu's mandarin Chi
nese restaurant in Los Altos
pushes China into a middle
American mold: -Shell chan
deliers faintly suggestive of

Chinese lanterns cast a fluores
cent light over formica tables.
Bright crimson and gold Chi
nese inscriptions bless the
diners who are served by a
troop of red-jacketed Chinese
waiters speaking flawless Eng-

V lish. Salt, pepper and forks
' adorn each table. Chopsticks
must be requested.
This restaurant is not the
place to impress a date with su
perlative mandarin Chinese
food served in exotic Asian sur
roundings, but it may be the
perfect place for a group of
friends to "go Chinese" on the
spur of the moment. The prices
are reasonable t- about $19 for
two people — even if the the
entrees don't dazzle the palate
as they might at a more lavish
establishment.
Chef Chu's does not accept
reservations for parties of less
than four, so if a couple tries to
brave the crowds that mill
around the lobby they may
have to wait more than an
hour. Tha management does
offer some diversion to kill the
time while waiting for a vacant
table; a window opens onto
the kitchen where legions of
cooks frantically dice, chop,
stir-fry and steam food as they
shout back and forth in Chi
nese. This pastime grows old af
ter about five minutes ... my
companion, O'Toolewitz, and I
opted for a walk to Long's
Drugs across the El Camino
Real.
When we returned from
Long's, O'Toolewitz noticed
that the kitchen window faces
an array of frequently-ordered
dishes — sweet and sour pork,
fried rice and cashew chicken
— that are ready made to meet
Chef Chu's substantial take
out demand. While the sweet
and sour pork and fried rice

seemed passable, the cashew
chicken looked tired. If order
ing food-to-go from Chu's,. the
customer would be wise to
avoid these entrees. The chef
does not limit the take-out
menu to these Chinese staples
and prepares many more un
usual dishes such as Pork with
Preserved Turnip Soup and
Chef Chu's lover's Prawns,
shrimp half sauteed in a wine
sauce, half in tomato sauce
with garlic.
The maitre d' finally seated
us near the lobby after we had
seen the El Camino and
watched the harried chefs for
more than a hour. With a per
functory nod "hello" and a toss
of the menu, the host disap
peared. A waitress took over
almost immediately, quickly
placing a teapot, cups and
plates on the formica table. She
took our order of potslickers,
hot and sour soup, mu shu
pork and shrimp and
asparagus, before she also dis
appeared. It was all very polite,
but it left me with the feeling
that I was on a Chinese food as
sembly line.
When the meal arrived, it
was good though not fantastic.
The hot and sour soup em
phasized the hot, leaving my
palate numb to the potstickers
that followed. The waitress
served the mu shu pork a
Chinese rendition of the bur
rito — with packaged pancakes
that grew cold and tough after
the first round. The highlight of
the dinner was the last course:
prawns with asparagus. Served
in a delicate sauce, the prawns
and asparagus finished with a
flourish what might have oth
erwise been a mediocre din
ner.
Leaving Chef Chu's through
the still-crowded lobby, I felt
satisfied, but not sated. For its
price range, Chef Chu's serves
its customers, especially large
groups, remarkably well. But
those seeking a romantic eve
ning for two would do better to
pay a little extra at a restaurant
in a more expensive price
