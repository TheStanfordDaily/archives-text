In these inflationary
times, finding restaurants
with inflation-fighting
prices without the franchise
mystique is often a tough as
signment. Well, tor those of
you who are looking for an
inexpensive meal with a
quality eatery atmosphere,
try Chung King Royal Res
taurant in Palo Alto. Prices
are very modest and a full
range of Szechuan (hot and
spicy) and Cantonese (mild)
cuisine is available to satisfy
all palates.
F or the dinner menu,
plates with such traditional
Oriental food items as sweet
and sour pork, almond
chicken, chow mein and
egg foo yung are available in
four different combina
tions. Prices for these dinner
items, including soup of the
day or won ton soup in addi
tion to Rork fried rice, range
from $2.95 to $3.25 depend
ing on the choice of main
dishes. Even McDonald's
would have a difficult time
matching these prices.
On our excursion, I or
dered a combination dinner
consisting of won ton soup,
almond chicken, pork fried
rice and fried prawns that
cost a mere $3.25. The quali

ty of the food, however, was
certainly not as great as the
price. I found the won ton
soup to be fine but nothing
outstanding. The Almond
Chicken seemed to be lack
ing one key item: chicken.
My serving was full of de
liriously cooked fruits and
vegetables, however, find
ing traces of chicken re
quired considerable effort.
The other meal ordered
was similar to the first con
sisting of the soup of the day
(a vegetable soup), sweet
and sour pork, two egg rolls
and the pork fried, yet still
soggy, rice. Total price tag
on this dinner was $2.95 — a
great bargain.
The atmosphere of
Chung King is also quite
charming. Fine wall paper
ing and oriental design are
embellished mostly in red
and add a certain charm to
the place. A vase of fresh
flowers on every table also
gives the place an extra ap
peal. Overall, the food is
nothing fantastic and does
not compare to other local
— yet more expensive —
Oriental eating estab
lishments such as Shogun or
Mings. However, the price
is certainly right and the at
mosphere is rather cozy. —
