# Ruby King

gold stand for happiness and good fortune, respectively, and in
accordance with that theme, practically everything in the place —
from the soft red light to the color of the waiters' jackets — is red
and gold. Even the name, prompted by the symbolism of red
rubies and a king's golden riches, gets into the spirit of things.
Portions were generous and prices were moderate, a happy
combination all around. If you're in the mood for Chinese food,
or better still, if you're in the mood for Chinese food and seafood
— one of Ruby King's specialties — and atmosphere and good
service are higher on your list of priorities than finding the perfect
entree. Ruby King is a good bet.
And if you're planning a big party or banquet and are looking
for just the right place, Ruby King is a must.

The nicest part of this restaurant, alas, is the one most patrons
never get to see. Not that the food, decor, or service are anything
to sneeze at: all three qualities keep pace with the best of 'em.
But it is the upstairs banquet room, the room which seats 400,
has its own kitchen and bar and dance floor, and is so beautifully
decorated that the rest of the lavishly done building pales in com
parison, that sets Ruby King above and beyond the other dozen or
so Chinese restaurants which line El Camino.
When the hostess showed us the long, high-ceilinged room
with "its cozy round tables and soft red lighting, I was amazed. If
you are looking for a novel place to givte a party (and you dont
even need 400 guests), this just may be the place you seek.
Unfortunately, the quality diminishes as you descend the
elaborately decorated stairs. As tired a line as it is, you know
you're going to get a good meal at a Chinese restaurant when
more than half of the clientele is Chinese. Most of the clientele
was Chinese, all right, but it didn't help.
My companion and I decided not to be terribly adven
turesome: we began with Roast Duck and continued with most of
our old favorites. Once you overcome the initial hurdle of figur
ing out how to eat it, the Roast Duck is one of the best appetizers
you'll have at a Chinese restaurant.
Next we sampled the Lemon Chicken, Beef with Snow Peas,
Deep Fried and Sauteed Scallops and a standard rice dish.
That "standard" proved to be the tastiest part of the meal. As a
staple of a Chinese meal, rice is served by the dollop and even
though we'd brought healthy appetites, we were barely able to
finish half of the rice/meat/assorted vegetables on the platter.
Actually, I was impressed to learn that Ruby King restaurants are
also in Singapore, Taipei and Hong Kong. It lends a stamp of
authenticity — sort of like how a Parisian might feel if he knew
that they really do have McDonald's in America, too.
Symbolism is important to the Chinese and at Ruby King your
surroundings remind you of its importance at every turn. Red and
gold stand for happiness and good fortune, respectively, and in
accordance with that theme, practically everything in the place —
from the soft red light to the color of the waiters' jackets — is red
