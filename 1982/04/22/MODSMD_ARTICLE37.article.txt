# Ruby King

### Sally Newman 
gold stand for happiness and good fortune, respectively, and in
accordance with that theme, practically everything in the place —
from the soft red light to the color of the waiters' jackets — is red
and gold. Even the name, prompted by the symbolism of red
rubies and a king's golden riches, gets into the spirit of things.
Portions were generous and prices were moderate, a happy
combination all around. If you're in the mood for Chinese food,
or better still, if you're in the mood for Chinese food and seafood
— one of Ruby King's specialties — and atmosphere and good
service are higher on your list of priorities than finding the perfect
entree. Ruby King is a good bet.
And if you're planning a big party or banquet and are looking
for just the right place, Ruby King is a must.
