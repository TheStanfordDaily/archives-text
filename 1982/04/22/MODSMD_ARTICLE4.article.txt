V yesterday morning.
One of a group of Israeli soldiers was killed and an
other was injured when an anti-tank mine exploded
near the south Lebanon village of Taibe, a short dis
tance from a Nigerian post of the U.N. peace keeping
forces.
Israel immediately called the explosion the 32nd vi
olation of the cease-fire, which went into effect last
July 24, even though the Israeli soldiers were just in
side the Lebanese border, in an area controlled by
Maj. Saad Haddad, a Christian former member of the
Lebanese army. The Israeli jets attacked a few hours
later.
British hint flexibility on Falklands
London — Indicating some flexibility in Britain's
negotiating position, British Foreign Secretary Francis
Pym told Parliament yesterday he hoped to make
progress toward a peaceful settlement of the Falkland
Islands crisis in talks beginning today in Washington
with U. S. Secretary of State Alexander Haig.
While refusing to express any optimism about a set
tlement, a senior British source noted that since a
summary of the new British negotiating position was
sent to Washington yesterday ahead of Pym, there are
detailed written proposals from both Britain and Ar
gentina on the table for the first time. "We are now at
the beginning of real negotiations," this source said.
Pym also warned Parliament, however, that achiev
ing a settlement was "not in any way going to be
easy." With the vanguard of Britain's powerful naval
task force now believed to be less than a week from
the vicinity of the Falklands, Pym told members of Par
liament they "have to face" the possibility that mili
tary means may still need to be used to force Argen
tina to withdraw from the Falklands.
At one point, Pym appeared to rule out using force
"so long as negotiations are in play." But he later re
turned to the crowded House of Commons chamber
to make an unusual statement correcting himself to
say, "however hard I was trying to achieve a peaceful
settlement, the use of force could not at any stage be
ruled out."
Aides said Pym had made "an unfortunate slip of
the tongue." Several members of Parliament said,
however, they would be surprised if Britain initiated
hostilities while active negotiations continued, al
though the government must still threaten military
action to keep pressure on Argentina.
"No British government could afford to have its
hands tied by an understanding that no force would
be used as long as talks are going on," said Conserva
tive member of Parliament Sir Bernard Braine.
Massive fire sweeps Anaheim
Anaheim — A massive wind-whipped fire roared
through a section of older, densely packed apart
ments in Anaheim yesterday morning, destroying
about 300 units and sending about 2000 residents
fleeing.
The neignborhood consumed is about one mile
west of Disneyland. The powerful Santa Ana desert
winds were blowing from the east, so the famous
amusement park was never in danger.
The blaze broke out shortly after sunrise and it took
firemen three hours to contain it.
Firemen arrived to find the flames leaping from
roof to roof. Policemen pounded on doors and
shouted through bullhorns to awaken sleeping apart
ment dwellers.
Casualties were apparently limited to three firemen
and seven civilians. The more serious injuries were to

a firefighter who suffered second-degree burns and
to two elderly residents of the neighborhood area
who had heart attacks, officials said.
The fire, believed started by sparks from power
lines downed by the 45-mph winds, was fought by
more than 100 fire department units from com
munities throughout Southern California. At first, ar
riving firemen could do little more than form a perim
eter around the blaze.
"The winds swept the water from our hoses back
into our faces," one weary fireman said as a cloud of
smoke rose above the gutted structures and moved
west with the winds.
Many of the apartment buildings — mostly smaller,
two-story structures — were burned to the ground;
those that remained standing lost their roofs.
U.S. reacts 'blandly' to raid
Washington — The United States, striving to avoid
recriminations that could affect Israel's scheduled
withdrawal Sunday from the Sinai Peninsula, reacted
* to yesterday's bombing of Lebanon with a low-key
statement deploring all cease-fire violations, "includ
ing violence against Israelis and the Israeli air strikes
into Lebanon."
The appeal for restoration of the cease-fire in Leba
non, coupled with the refusal of U.S. officials to go
publicly beyond the statement's cautious wording,
contrasted starkly with the anger expressed by the
Reagan administration last December about Israeli
annexation of the Golan Heights.
Privately, administration sources made no secret
yesterday of their dismay and concern at Israeli Prime
Minister Menachem Begin's decision to strike at
Palestine Liberation Organization positions inside
Lebanon.
The sources acknowledged candidly that the Unit
ed States cannot risk a new confrontation with Begin
that could further inflame the Mideast situation and
cause potentially irreparable damage to U.S. policy
goals in the region.
According to the sources, the most immediate U.S.
concern is to avoid giving Israel any pretext for back
ing away from the scheduled return to Egypt of the
last Israeli-occupied portion of the Sinai.
Failure to complete the turnover, agreed to in the
Egyptian-Israeli peace treaty, could deal a major blow
to Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak's ability to re
tain power and kill U.S. hopes for giving new impetus
to the stalled Camp David peace process.
These considerations, the sources conceded, led
the State Department to issue a statement so bland
that it seemed almost identical to expressions of con
cern routinely issued by the department during rela
tively minor cease-fire infractions.
Israeli army destroys Sinai town
Yamit, Occupied Sinai — In a precision series of
raids, Israeli Army troops yesterday forcibly evac
uated most of the 2000 militant settlers from this
northern Sinai development town and immediately
began bulldozing the sprawling Mediterranean
seaside town into the sand dunes.
Four days before Israel is to turn over the last sec
tion of the occupied Sinai Peninsula to Egypt, huge
earthmoving machines rumbled through the town
late into the night, reducing scores of neat, stucco vil
las and townhouses into grotesque piles of rubble as a
diehard band of about 200 infuriated opponents re
treated to rooftop redoubts and threatened to battle
the already weary and emotionally wrung-out Israeli
soldiers who in a few short hours had transformed the

once thriving desert oasis into practically a ghost
town.
The troops pulled back from a final confrontation
as darkness fell, but were expected to complete a
mopping-up operation today.
For the most part, the opponents to Sunday's
scheduled withdrawal from the last third of the Sinai
offered only passive, if vocal, resistance to the evac
uation, but there were some ugly clashes in which
holdouts attacked soldiers with rocks and sandbags
and attempted to knock them off ladders used to as
sault the heavily fortified roofs.
The way was cleared for the oft-postponed evac
uation of Yamit after Begin's Cabinet, apparently sat
isfied by the receipt of an Egyptian reaffirmation of its
commitment to the Camp David peace accords, voted
to proceed with the Sinai withdrawal on schedule.
While the opponents of the withdrawal almost
all of them relatively recent squatters who took over
homes abandoned by the original residents of Yamit
— were aware of a heavy Army presence, few seemed
to expect the suddenness and almost clinically effi
cient thoroughness of the early afternoon sweep the
Army mounted.
Oil discovered near Falklands
Rio Gallegos, Argentina — Government officials
said yesterday that a multinational consortium has
struck oil in the South Atlantic between Tierra del
Fuego and the Argentine-occupied Falkland Islands.
The discovery was made a month ago by a French
firm, Total, chief partner in a consortium called Total-
Bridas-Deminex. Officials of the Argentine Ministry
of Works and Public Services confirmed the find.
Oil experts of this southern Argentine port said that
previous finds off Tierra del Fuego, a group of islands
at the tip of Argentina, have consisted mostly of natu
ral gas. The new find is said to be basically oil.
Experts said further drilling would be required to
determine the potential of the find, and none is now
underway. The drilling platform that made the dis
covery has been pulled back to San Sebastian, south
of the Straits of Magellan, for repairs.
"It will take a lot more exploration to show what is
really there," an oil firm official here said. The gov
ernment in Buenos Aires cautioned against undue
optimism over the find until further studies are made.
The consortium that made the strike declined com
ment.
Geologists have suspected for years that the
Falklands themselves, which the Argentines call the
Malvinas, lay over a large reservoir of petrocarbon
products, but under British rule no attempt has been
made to explore it fully. The British government has
warned oil companies that any leases granted by the
Argentines would be contested legally.
"When the issue of sovereingty is resolved," said
Mario Gomez, local representative of the Hughes
Tool Co.'s Argentine affiliate, "Argentina's territorial
waters will include the entire Atlantic platform
around the Malvinas. We expect international oil
companies will be very interested in leases to explore
around the Malvinas."
Budget squabbles worsen
Washington — House Speaker Thomas "Tip"
O'Neill (D-Mass.), mocking President Ronald Rea

compromise, said yesterday that Reagan will have to
"go first" if he wants Democratic support for an ac

Poet MacLeish dies at 89
Boston — Archibald MacLeish, poet, playwright
and winner of three Pulitzer Prizes, died Tuesday He
was 89. ]
Much of his writing was historical, and although he
wrote prose and p'?.ys, he was best known for his
poetry.
MacLeish's first poetry Pulitzer in 1932 was for Con
quistadore, based on an intensive study he made by
following the trail of the Spanish Conquistadors
through Mexico by pack mule.
His second Pulitzer came in 1953 for "Collected
Poems 1917-1952." He won the Pulitzer in drama in
1959 for "J. 8.," a play in verse.
"Poetry is a means of knowing," MacLeishsaiddur
ing a 1976 television interview.
"Its great triumph is that when it succeeds, whichit
does much less often than it thinks or anybody else
thinks, it makes the unbearable bearable because one
sees it at last. One feels it."

winds were blowing from the east, so the famous
amusement park was never in danger.
The blaze broke out shortly after sunrise and it took
firemen three hours to contain it.
Firemen arrived to find the flames leaping from
roof to roof. Policemen pounded on doors and
shouted through bullhorns to awaken sleeping apart
ment dwellers.
Casualties were apparently limited to three firemen
and seven civilians. The more serious injuries were to

a firefighter who suffered second-degree burns and
to two elderly residents of the neighborhood area
who had heart attacks, officials said.
The fire, believed started by sparks from power
lines downed by the 45-mph winds, was fought by
more than 100 fire department units from com
munities throughout Southern California. At first, ar
riving firemen could do little more than form a perim
eter around the blaze.
"The winds swept the water from our hoses back
into our faces," one weary fireman said as a cloud of
smoke rose above the gutted structures and moved
west with the winds.
Many of the apartment buildings — mostly smaller,
two-story structures — were burned to the ground;
those that remained standing lost their roofs.
U.S. reacts 'blandly' to raid
Washington — The United States, striving to avoid
recriminations that could affect Israel's scheduled
withdrawal Sunday from the Sinai Peninsula, reacted
* to yesterday's bombing of Lebanon with a low-key
statement deploring all cease-fire violations, "includ
ing violence against Israelis and the Israeli air strikes
into Lebanon."
The appeal for restoration of the cease-fire in Leba
non, coupled with the refusal of U.S. officials to go
publicly beyond the statement's cautious wording,
contrasted starkly with the anger expressed by the
Reagan administration last December about Israeli
annexation of the Golan Heights.
Privately, administration sources made no secret
yesterday of their dismay and concern at Israeli Prime
Minister Menachem Begin's decision to strike at
Palestine Liberation Organization positions inside
Lebanon.
The sources acknowledged candidly that the Unit
ed States cannot risk a new confrontation with Begin
that could further inflame the Mideast situation and
cause potentially irreparable damage to U.S. policy
goals in the region.
According to the sources, the most immediate U.S.
concern is to avoid giving Israel any pretext for back
ing away from the scheduled return to Egypt of the
last Israeli-occupied portion of the Sinai.
Failure to complete the turnover, agreed to in the
Egyptian-Israeli peace treaty, could deal a major blow
to Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak's ability to re
tain power and kill U.S. hopes for giving new impetus
to the stalled Camp David peace process.
These considerations, the sources conceded, led
the State Department to issue a statement so bland
that it seemed almost identical to expressions of con
cern routinely issued by the department during rela
tively minor cease-fire infractions.
Israeli army destroys Sinai town
Yamit, Occupied Sinai — In a precision series of
raids, Israeli Army troops yesterday forcibly evac
uated most of the 2000 militant settlers from this
northern Sinai development town and immediately
began bulldozing the sprawling Mediterranean
seaside town into the sand dunes.
Four days before Israel is to turn over the last sec
tion of the occupied Sinai Peninsula to Egypt, huge
earthmoving machines rumbled through the town
late into the night, reducing scores of neat, stucco vil
las and townhouses into grotesque piles of rubble as a
diehard band of about 200 infuriated opponents re
treated to rooftop redoubts and threatened to battle
the already weary and emotionally wrung-out Israeli
soldiers who in a few short hours had transformed the

once thriving desert oasis into practically a ghost
town.
The troops pulled back from a final confrontation
as darkness fell, but were expected to complete a
mopping-up operation today.
For the most part, the opponents to Sunday's
scheduled withdrawal from the last third of the Sinai
offered only passive, if vocal, resistance to the evac
uation, but there were some ugly clashes in which
holdouts attacked soldiers with rocks and sandbags
and attempted to knock them off ladders used to as
sault the heavily fortified roofs.
The way was cleared for the oft-postponed evac
uation of Yamit after Begin's Cabinet, apparently sat
isfied by the receipt of an Egyptian reaffirmation of its
commitment to the Camp David peace accords, voted
to proceed with the Sinai withdrawal on schedule.
While the opponents of the withdrawal almost
all of them relatively recent squatters who took over
homes abandoned by the original residents of Yamit
— were aware of a heavy Army presence, few seemed
to expect the suddenness and almost clinically effi
cient thoroughness of the early afternoon sweep the
Army mounted.
Oil discovered near Falklands
Rio Gallegos, Argentina — Government officials
said yesterday that a multinational consortium has
struck oil in the South Atlantic between Tierra del
Fuego and the Argentine-occupied Falkland Islands.
The discovery was made a month ago by a French
firm, Total, chief partner in a consortium called Total-
Bridas-Deminex. Officials of the Argentine Ministry
of Works and Public Services confirmed the find.
Oil experts of this southern Argentine port said that
previous finds off Tierra del Fuego, a group of islands
at the tip of Argentina, have consisted mostly of natu
ral gas. The new find is said to be basically oil.
Experts said further drilling would be required to
determine the potential of the find, and none is now
underway. The drilling platform that made the dis
covery has been pulled back to San Sebastian, south
of the Straits of Magellan, for repairs.
"It will take a lot more exploration to show what is
really there," an oil firm official here said. The gov
ernment in Buenos Aires cautioned against undue
optimism over the find until further studies are made.
The consortium that made the strike declined com
ment.
Geologists have suspected for years that the
Falklands themselves, which the Argentines call the
Malvinas, lay over a large reservoir of petrocarbon
products, but under British rule no attempt has been
made to explore it fully. The British government has
warned oil companies that any leases granted by the
Argentines would be contested legally.
"When the issue of sovereingty is resolved," said
Mario Gomez, local representative of the Hughes
Tool Co.'s Argentine affiliate, "Argentina's territorial
waters will include the entire Atlantic platform
around the Malvinas. We expect international oil
companies will be very interested in leases to explore
around the Malvinas."

Poet MacLeish dies at 89
Boston — Archibald MacLeish, poet, playwright
and winner of three Pulitzer Prizes, died Tuesday He
was 89. ]
Much of his writing was historical, and although he
wrote prose and p'?.ys, he was best known for his
poetry.
MacLeish's first poetry Pulitzer in 1932 was for Con
quistadore, based on an intensive study he made by
following the trail of the Spanish Conquistadors
through Mexico by pack mule.
His second Pulitzer came in 1953 for "Collected
Poems 1917-1952." He won the Pulitzer in drama in
1959 for "J. 8.," a play in verse.
"Poetry is a means of knowing," MacLeishsaiddur

"Its great triumph is that when it succeeds, whichit
does much less often than it thinks or anybody else
thinks, it makes the unbearable bearable because one
sees it at last. One feels it."

One of a group of Israeli soldiers was killed and an

British hint flexibility on Falklands
London — Indicating some flexibility in Britain's
negotiating position, British Foreign Secretary Francis
Pym told Parliament yesterday he hoped to make
progress toward a peaceful settlement of the Falkland
Islands crisis in talks beginning today in Washington
with U. S. Secretary of State Alexander Haig.
While refusing to express any optimism about a set
tlement, a senior British source noted that since a
summary of the new British negotiating position was
sent to Washington yesterday ahead of Pym, there are
detailed written proposals from both Britain and Ar
gentina on the table for the first time. "We are now at
the beginning of real negotiations," this source said.
Pym also warned Parliament, however, that achiev
ing a settlement was "not in any way going to be
easy." With the vanguard of Britain's powerful naval
task force now believed to be less than a week from
the vicinity of the Falklands, Pym told members of Par
liament they "have to face" the possibility that mili
tary means may still need to be used to force Argen
tina to withdraw from the Falklands.
At one point, Pym appeared to rule out using force
"so long as negotiations are in play." But he later re
turned to the crowded House of Commons chamber
to make an unusual statement correcting himself to
say, "however hard I was trying to achieve a peaceful
settlement, the use of force could not at any stage be
ruled out."
Aides said Pym had made "an unfortunate slip of
the tongue." Several members of Parliament said,
however, they would be surprised if Britain initiated
hostilities while active negotiations continued, al
though the government must still threaten military
action to keep pressure on Argentina.
"No British government could afford to have its
hands tied by an understanding that no force would
be used as long as talks are going on," said Conserva
tive member of Parliament Sir Bernard Braine.
Massive fire sweeps Anaheim
Anaheim — A massive wind-whipped fire roared

Oil discovered near Falklands
Rio Gallegos, Argentina — Government officials
said yesterday that a multinational consortium has
struck oil in the South Atlantic between Tierra del
Fuego and the Argentine-occupied Falkland Islands.
The discovery was made a month ago by a French
firm, Total, chief partner in a consortium called Total-
Bridas-Deminex. Officials of the Argentine Ministry
of Works and Public Services confirmed the find.
Oil experts of this southern Argentine port said that
previous finds off Tierra del Fuego, a group of islands
at the tip of Argentina, have consisted mostly of natu
ral gas. The new find is said to be basically oil.
Experts said further drilling would be required to
determine the potential of the find, and none is now
underway. The drilling platform that made the dis
covery has been pulled back to San Sebastian, south
of the Straits of Magellan, for repairs.
"It will take a lot more exploration to show what is
really there," an oil firm official here said. The gov
ernment in Buenos Aires cautioned against undue
optimism over the find until further studies are made.
The consortium that made the strike declined com
ment.
Geologists have suspected for years that the
Falklands themselves, which the Argentines call the
Malvinas, lay over a large reservoir of petrocarbon
products, but under British rule no attempt has been
made to explore it fully. The British government has
warned oil companies that any leases granted by the
Argentines would be contested legally.
"When the issue of sovereingty is resolved," said
Mario Gomez, local representative of the Hughes
Tool Co.'s Argentine affiliate, "Argentina's territorial
waters will include the entire Atlantic platform
around the Malvinas. We expect international oil
companies will be very interested in leases to explore
around the Malvinas."

Poet MacLeish dies at 89
Boston — Archibald MacLeish, poet, playwright
and winner of three Pulitzer Prizes, died Tuesday He
was 89. ]
Much of his writing was historical, and although he
wrote prose and p'?.ys, he was best known for his
poetry.
MacLeish's first poetry Pulitzer in 1932 was for Con
quistadore, based on an intensive study he made by
following the trail of the Spanish Conquistadors
through Mexico by pack mule.
His second Pulitzer came in 1953 for "Collected
Poems 1917-1952." He won the Pulitzer in drama in
1959 for "J. 8.," a play in verse.
"Poetry is a means of knowing," MacLeishsaiddur

"Its great triumph is that when it succeeds, whichit
does much less often than it thinks or anybody else
thinks, it makes the unbearable bearable because one
sees it at last. One feels it."

One of a group of Israeli soldiers was killed and an

near the south Lebanon village of Taibe, a short dis

Israel immediately called the explosion the 32nd vi

Maj. Saad Haddad, a Christian former member of the

British hint flexibility on Falklands
London — Indicating some flexibility in Britain's
negotiating position, British Foreign Secretary Francis
Pym told Parliament yesterday he hoped to make
progress toward a peaceful settlement of the Falkland
Islands crisis in talks beginning today in Washington
with U. S. Secretary of State Alexander Haig.
While refusing to express any optimism about a set
tlement, a senior British source noted that since a
summary of the new British negotiating position was
sent to Washington yesterday ahead of Pym, there are
detailed written proposals from both Britain and Ar
gentina on the table for the first time. "We are now at
the beginning of real negotiations," this source said.
Pym also warned Parliament, however, that achiev
ing a settlement was "not in any way going to be
easy." With the vanguard of Britain's powerful naval
task force now believed to be less than a week from
the vicinity of the Falklands, Pym told members of Par
liament they "have to face" the possibility that mili
tary means may still need to be used to force Argen
tina to withdraw from the Falklands.
At one point, Pym appeared to rule out using force
"so long as negotiations are in play." But he later re
turned to the crowded House of Commons chamber
to make an unusual statement correcting himself to
say, "however hard I was trying to achieve a peaceful
settlement, the use of force could not at any stage be
ruled out."
Aides said Pym had made "an unfortunate slip of
the tongue." Several members of Parliament said,
however, they would be surprised if Britain initiated
hostilities while active negotiations continued, al
though the government must still threaten military
action to keep pressure on Argentina.
"No British government could afford to have its
hands tied by an understanding that no force would
be used as long as talks are going on," said Conserva
tive member of Parliament Sir Bernard Braine.
Massive fire sweeps Anaheim
Anaheim — A massive wind-whipped fire roared
through a section of older, densely packed apart
ments in Anaheim yesterday morning, destroying
about 300 units and sending about 2000 residents
fleeing.
The neignborhood consumed is about one mile
west of Disneyland. The powerful Santa Ana desert
winds were blowing from the east, so the famous
amusement park was never in danger.
The blaze broke out shortly after sunrise and it took
firemen three hours to contain it.
Firemen arrived to find the flames leaping from
roof to roof. Policemen pounded on doors and
shouted through bullhorns to awaken sleeping apart
ment dwellers.
Casualties were apparently limited to three firemen
and seven civilians. The more serious injuries were to

a firefighter who suffered second-degree burns and
to two elderly residents of the neighborhood area
who had heart attacks, officials said.
The fire, believed started by sparks from power
lines downed by the 45-mph winds, was fought by
more than 100 fire department units from com
munities throughout Southern California. At first, ar
riving firemen could do little more than form a perim
eter around the blaze.
"The winds swept the water from our hoses back
into our faces," one weary fireman said as a cloud of
smoke rose above the gutted structures and moved
west with the winds.
Many of the apartment buildings — mostly smaller,
two-story structures — were burned to the ground;
those that remained standing lost their roofs.
U.S. reacts 'blandly' to raid
Washington — The United States, striving to avoid
recriminations that could affect Israel's scheduled
withdrawal Sunday from the Sinai Peninsula, reacted
* to yesterday's bombing of Lebanon with a low-key
statement deploring all cease-fire violations, "includ
ing violence against Israelis and the Israeli air strikes
into Lebanon."
The appeal for restoration of the cease-fire in Leba
non, coupled with the refusal of U.S. officials to go
publicly beyond the statement's cautious wording,
contrasted starkly with the anger expressed by the
Reagan administration last December about Israeli
annexation of the Golan Heights.
Privately, administration sources made no secret
yesterday of their dismay and concern at Israeli Prime
Minister Menachem Begin's decision to strike at
Palestine Liberation Organization positions inside
Lebanon.
The sources acknowledged candidly that the Unit
ed States cannot risk a new confrontation with Begin
that could further inflame the Mideast situation and
cause potentially irreparable damage to U.S. policy
goals in the region.
According to the sources, the most immediate U.S.
concern is to avoid giving Israel any pretext for back
ing away from the scheduled return to Egypt of the
last Israeli-occupied portion of the Sinai.
Failure to complete the turnover, agreed to in the
Egyptian-Israeli peace treaty, could deal a major blow
to Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak's ability to re
tain power and kill U.S. hopes for giving new impetus
to the stalled Camp David peace process.
These considerations, the sources conceded, led
the State Department to issue a statement so bland
that it seemed almost identical to expressions of con
cern routinely issued by the department during rela
tively minor cease-fire infractions.
Israeli army destroys Sinai town
Yamit, Occupied Sinai — In a precision series of
raids, Israeli Army troops yesterday forcibly evac
uated most of the 2000 militant settlers from this
northern Sinai development town and immediately
began bulldozing the sprawling Mediterranean
seaside town into the sand dunes.
Four days before Israel is to turn over the last sec
tion of the occupied Sinai Peninsula to Egypt, huge
earthmoving machines rumbled through the town
late into the night, reducing scores of neat, stucco vil
las and townhouses into grotesque piles of rubble as a
diehard band of about 200 infuriated opponents re
treated to rooftop redoubts and threatened to battle
the already weary and emotionally wrung-out Israeli
soldiers who in a few short hours had transformed the

once thriving desert oasis into practically a ghost
town.
The troops pulled back from a final confrontation
as darkness fell, but were expected to complete a
mopping-up operation today.
For the most part, the opponents to Sunday's
scheduled withdrawal from the last third of the Sinai
offered only passive, if vocal, resistance to the evac
uation, but there were some ugly clashes in which
holdouts attacked soldiers with rocks and sandbags
and attempted to knock them off ladders used to as
sault the heavily fortified roofs.
The way was cleared for the oft-postponed evac
uation of Yamit after Begin's Cabinet, apparently sat
isfied by the receipt of an Egyptian reaffirmation of its

1959 for "J. 8.," a play in verse.
"Poetry is a means of knowing," MacLeishsaiddur

thinks, it makes the unbearable bearable because one
sees it at last. One feels it."

V yesterday morning.
One of a group of Israeli soldiers was killed and an
other was injured when an anti-tank mine exploded
near the south Lebanon village of Taibe, a short dis
tance from a Nigerian post of the U.N. peace keeping
forces.
Israel immediately called the explosion the 32nd vi
olation of the cease-fire, which went into effect last
July 24, even though the Israeli soldiers were just in
side the Lebanese border, in an area controlled by
Maj. Saad Haddad, a Christian former member of the
Lebanese army. The Israeli jets attacked a few hours
later.
British hint flexibility on Falklands
London — Indicating some flexibility in Britain's
negotiating position, British Foreign Secretary Francis
Pym told Parliament yesterday he hoped to make
progress toward a peaceful settlement of the Falkland
Islands crisis in talks beginning today in Washington
with U. S. Secretary of State Alexander Haig.
While refusing to express any optimism about a set
tlement, a senior British source noted that since a
summary of the new British negotiating position was
sent to Washington yesterday ahead of Pym, there are
detailed written proposals from both Britain and Ar
gentina on the table for the first time. "We are now at
the beginning of real negotiations," this source said.
Pym also warned Parliament, however, that achiev
ing a settlement was "not in any way going to be
easy." With the vanguard of Britain's powerful naval
task force now believed to be less than a week from
the vicinity of the Falklands, Pym told members of Par
liament they "have to face" the possibility that mili
tary means may still need to be used to force Argen
tina to withdraw from the Falklands.
At one point, Pym appeared to rule out using force
"so long as negotiations are in play." But he later re
turned to the crowded House of Commons chamber
to make an unusual statement correcting himself to
say, "however hard I was trying to achieve a peaceful
settlement, the use of force could not at any stage be
ruled out."
Aides said Pym had made "an unfortunate slip of
the tongue." Several members of Parliament said,
however, they would be surprised if Britain initiated
hostilities while active negotiations continued, al
though the government must still threaten military
action to keep pressure on Argentina.
"No British government could afford to have its
hands tied by an understanding that no force would
be used as long as talks are going on," said Conserva
tive member of Parliament Sir Bernard Braine.
Massive fire sweeps Anaheim
Anaheim — A massive wind-whipped fire roared
through a section of older, densely packed apart
ments in Anaheim yesterday morning, destroying
about 300 units and sending about 2000 residents
fleeing.
The neignborhood consumed is about one mile
west of Disneyland. The powerful Santa Ana desert
winds were blowing from the east, so the famous
amusement park was never in danger.
The blaze broke out shortly after sunrise and it took
firemen three hours to contain it.
Firemen arrived to find the flames leaping from
roof to roof. Policemen pounded on doors and
shouted through bullhorns to awaken sleeping apart
ment dwellers.
Casualties were apparently limited to three firemen
and seven civilians. The more serious injuries were to

a firefighter who suffered second-degree burns and
to two elderly residents of the neighborhood area
who had heart attacks, officials said.
The fire, believed started by sparks from power
lines downed by the 45-mph winds, was fought by
more than 100 fire department units from com
munities throughout Southern California. At first, ar
riving firemen could do little more than form a perim
eter around the blaze.
"The winds swept the water from our hoses back
into our faces," one weary fireman said as a cloud of
smoke rose above the gutted structures and moved
west with the winds.
Many of the apartment buildings — mostly smaller,
two-story structures — were burned to the ground;
those that remained standing lost their roofs.
U.S. reacts 'blandly' to raid
Washington — The United States, striving to avoid
recriminations that could affect Israel's scheduled
withdrawal Sunday from the Sinai Peninsula, reacted
* to yesterday's bombing of Lebanon with a low-key
statement deploring all cease-fire violations, "includ
ing violence against Israelis and the Israeli air strikes
into Lebanon."
The appeal for restoration of the cease-fire in Leba
non, coupled with the refusal of U.S. officials to go
publicly beyond the statement's cautious wording,
contrasted starkly with the anger expressed by the
Reagan administration last December about Israeli
annexation of the Golan Heights.
Privately, administration sources made no secret
yesterday of their dismay and concern at Israeli Prime
Minister Menachem Begin's decision to strike at
Palestine Liberation Organization positions inside
Lebanon.
The sources acknowledged candidly that the Unit
ed States cannot risk a new confrontation with Begin
that could further inflame the Mideast situation and
cause potentially irreparable damage to U.S. policy
goals in the region.
According to the sources, the most immediate U.S.
concern is to avoid giving Israel any pretext for back
ing away from the scheduled return to Egypt of the
last Israeli-occupied portion of the Sinai.
Failure to complete the turnover, agreed to in the
Egyptian-Israeli peace treaty, could deal a major blow
to Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak's ability to re
tain power and kill U.S. hopes for giving new impetus
to the stalled Camp David peace process.
These considerations, the sources conceded, led
the State Department to issue a statement so bland
that it seemed almost identical to expressions of con
cern routinely issued by the department during rela
tively minor cease-fire infractions.
Israeli army destroys Sinai town
Yamit, Occupied Sinai — In a precision series of
raids, Israeli Army troops yesterday forcibly evac
uated most of the 2000 militant settlers from this
northern Sinai development town and immediately
began bulldozing the sprawling Mediterranean
seaside town into the sand dunes.
Four days before Israel is to turn over the last sec
tion of the occupied Sinai Peninsula to Egypt, huge
earthmoving machines rumbled through the town
late into the night, reducing scores of neat, stucco vil
las and townhouses into grotesque piles of rubble as a
diehard band of about 200 infuriated opponents re
treated to rooftop redoubts and threatened to battle
the already weary and emotionally wrung-out Israeli
soldiers who in a few short hours had transformed the

once thriving desert oasis into practically a ghost
town.
The troops pulled back from a final confrontation
as darkness fell, but were expected to complete a
mopping-up operation today.
For the most part, the opponents to Sunday's
scheduled withdrawal from the last third of the Sinai
offered only passive, if vocal, resistance to the evac
uation, but there were some ugly clashes in which
holdouts attacked soldiers with rocks and sandbags
and attempted to knock them off ladders used to as
sault the heavily fortified roofs.
The way was cleared for the oft-postponed evac
uation of Yamit after Begin's Cabinet, apparently sat
isfied by the receipt of an Egyptian reaffirmation of its
commitment to the Camp David peace accords, voted
to proceed with the Sinai withdrawal on schedule.
While the opponents of the withdrawal almost
all of them relatively recent squatters who took over
homes abandoned by the original residents of Yamit
— were aware of a heavy Army presence, few seemed
to expect the suddenness and almost clinically effi
cient thoroughness of the early afternoon sweep the
Army mounted.
Oil discovered near Falklands
Rio Gallegos, Argentina — Government officials
said yesterday that a multinational consortium has
struck oil in the South Atlantic between Tierra del
Fuego and the Argentine-occupied Falkland Islands.
The discovery was made a month ago by a French
firm, Total, chief partner in a consortium called Total-
Bridas-Deminex. Officials of the Argentine Ministry
of Works and Public Services confirmed the find.
Oil experts of this southern Argentine port said that
previous finds off Tierra del Fuego, a group of islands
at the tip of Argentina, have consisted mostly of natu
ral gas. The new find is said to be basically oil.
Experts said further drilling would be required to
determine the potential of the find, and none is now
underway. The drilling platform that made the dis
covery has been pulled back to San Sebastian, south
of the Straits of Magellan, for repairs.
"It will take a lot more exploration to show what is
really there," an oil firm official here said. The gov
ernment in Buenos Aires cautioned against undue
optimism over the find until further studies are made.
The consortium that made the strike declined com
ment.
Geologists have suspected for years that the
Falklands themselves, which the Argentines call the
Malvinas, lay over a large reservoir of petrocarbon
products, but under British rule no attempt has been
made to explore it fully. The British government has
warned oil companies that any leases granted by the
Argentines would be contested legally.
"When the issue of sovereingty is resolved," said
Mario Gomez, local representative of the Hughes
Tool Co.'s Argentine affiliate, "Argentina's territorial
waters will include the entire Atlantic platform
around the Malvinas. We expect international oil
companies will be very interested in leases to explore
around the Malvinas."
Budget squabbles worsen
Washington — House Speaker Thomas "Tip"
O'Neill (D-Mass.), mocking President Ronald Rea
gan's pledge to "go the extra mile" to reach a budget
compromise, said yesterday that Reagan will have to
