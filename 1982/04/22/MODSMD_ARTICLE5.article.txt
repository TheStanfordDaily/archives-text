# Proposal to ease Biz school load
## 
### Mike Thurman Senior staff writer 
A study by a long-term planning
committee for the Business School
has proposed the elimination of the
core requirement for first-year busi
ness students and a reduction in the
number of courses required for grad
uation.
Released here last week, the MBA
Review Committee's report recom
mends changes similar to those re
cently announced at Harvard Busi
ness School where requirement re
ductions were made to trim the
massive workload assigned to first
year students.
Administrators at Harvard con
firmed that the school will cut the
number of classroom hours and the
amount of reading required of first
year students' by about 15 percent be
ginning this fall. Eugene Webb, as
sociate dean of the Business School
here and co-author of the report,
said the results of the study were not
influenced by the recent changes at
Harvard.
Officials from Stanford and
Harvard business schools, the top
two business schools in the nation,
emphasized that such reductions
would in no way demean the rigor
ous standards of each program. Rep
resentatives from each school said
the changes were designed to
strengthen the quality of the educa
tion offered to students in each pro
gram by allowing greater time for
thereflection and digestion of course
materials.
"Time spent in the classroom is not
related to the demandingness of the
program, it seems to me. The expec
tation is that if we give people more
time outside, they'll spend more time
in preparing and in reflective re
view," said Webb.
Second-year business student
Tracy Berka, a member of the com
mittee, said that the changes were
proposed in order to remove struc
tural barriers which sometimes lim
ited the benefits available from
positive interaction among the
school's diverse student body and
faculty.
"The basic motivation (of the com
mittee)," Berka said, "was that Stan
ford has distiguished itself by bring
ing together a set of distinguished
and intelligent faculty members and
a distinguished and intelligent stu
dent body. We wanted to take advan
tage of that strength without reduc
ing the rigorousness of the school."
However, Berka said that the core
requirement, which determines the

set of courses which must be passed
by first-year students, has the effect
of delineating the student body on
the basis of their respective profi
ciencies in the heavily analytic core
coursework.
The effect of the proposed
changes, according to Berka, would
be to "free up more hours for out-of
class study" and "allow students to
determine the coursework that's best
suited to their needs." She said she
thought that many students would
continue to take the core as it cur
rently exists because of the balanced
course of study it provides.
The proposal will be considered
during the next business school fac
ulty meeting which is scheduled for
May 5. Implementation of the
changes would require faculty ap
proval.
Associate Prof. Stephen Wheel
wright, another member of the com
mittee, said although he has received
feedback from some faculty mem
bers he is uncertain how the faculty
will decide on the changes.
"They all know (the proposal) is
important," he said. "Everybody
wants to see what everybody else says
before they take a position."
The committee, in the first long
term planning study since 1967, re
viewed every area of the Business
School program and facility, eval
uating the past and planning for the
future.
Utilizing a number of group stud
ies and questionnaire surveys of past
and present students as well as open
forums for faculty members and stu
dents, subcommittees focused on
pedagogy, environment of business,
skills, student culture and capital
equipment.
Supporting the recommendations,
the study reported that, "Many stu
dents complain that the program is
Jtoo heavily analytical... a substantial
number say that the program crushes
their spirit, intuition and inventive
ness ... It is our judgment that stu
dents are currently too highly con
strained."
In order to alter the program to
emphasize the positive aspects and
reduce the "areas of friction," the
committee recommended "aban
doning the existing core program
and putting in its place a set of 'dis
tributional requirements'." Under
the new plan, students would be re
quired to complete at least one
course from each of nine areas of
management.

Tracy Berka, a member of the com
mittee, said that the changes were
proposed in order to remove struc
tural barriers which sometimes lim
ited the benefits available from
positive interaction among the
school's diverse student body and
faculty.
"The basic motivation (of the com
mittee)," Berka said, "was that Stan
ford has distiguished itself by bring
ing together a set of distinguished
and intelligent faculty members and
a distinguished and intelligent stu
dent body. We wanted to take advan
tage of that strength without reduc
ing the rigorousness of the school."
However, Berka said that the core
requirement, which determines the

set of courses which must be passed
by first-year students, has the effect
of delineating the student body on
the basis of their respective profi
ciencies in the heavily analytic core
coursework.
The effect of the proposed
changes, according to Berka, would
be to "free up more hours for out-of
class study" and "allow students to
determine the coursework that's best
suited to their needs." She said she
thought that many students would
continue to take the core as it cur
rently exists because of the balanced
course of study it provides.
The proposal will be considered
during the next business school fac
ulty meeting which is scheduled for
May 5. Implementation of the
changes would require faculty ap
proval.
Associate Prof. Stephen Wheel
wright, another member of the com
mittee, said although he has received
feedback from some faculty mem
bers he is uncertain how the faculty
will decide on the changes.
"They all know (the proposal) is
important," he said. "Everybody
wants to see what everybody else says
before they take a position."
The committee, in the first long
term planning study since 1967, re
viewed every area of the Business
School program and facility, eval
uating the past and planning for the
future.
Utilizing a number of group stud
ies and questionnaire surveys of past
and present students as well as open
forums for faculty members and stu
dents, subcommittees focused on
pedagogy, environment of business,
skills, student culture and capital
equipment.
Supporting the recommendations,
the study reported that, "Many stu
dents complain that the program is
Jtoo heavily analytical... a substantial
number say that the program crushes
their spirit, intuition and inventive
ness ... It is our judgment that stu
dents are currently too highly con
strained."
In order to alter the program to
emphasize the positive aspects and
reduce the "areas of friction," the
committee recommended "aban
doning the existing core program
and putting in its place a set of 'dis
tributional requirements'." Under
the new plan, students would be re
quired to complete at least one
course from each of nine areas of
management.
