# Former Israeli military official speaks
## Continued Mideast instability forseen 
### Sid Atkins 
Although the withdrawl of Israeli
troops and civilians from the Sinai
Peninsula this Sunday should go
smoothly, many obstacles still block
the way to a lasting Egyptian-Israeli
peace, according Yacof Heichel, the
former head of the Israeli Military
Delegation to Egypt. Heichel defined
these obstacles on Tuesday to about
75 people in the American Studies
House lounge.
Heichel, who was also a colonel in
the Israeli Defense Force, pointed
out the instability of the Middle East
as being a primary problem.
"There is not a single Mideast
country that does not have some mi
nority causing it problems."
He claimed that the large ethnic
mix stems from the fact that three of

the world's largest religions — Islam,
Christianity and Judaism — all de
clare their homeland to be some
where in the Middle East. Another
problem cited by Heichel is the coex
istence of oil-rich Arab states with
other underdeveloped, extremely
poor areas. The area in general is still
dependant on either the East of the
West for aid.
"The result is that you have crazy
rules, a crazy environment, and crazy
people."
The different interests of the vari
ous Arab states will also block the
Egyptian-Israeli peace process, said
Heichel. The Arab nations, war
amongst themselves as have Iran-
Iraq war. The PLO, headed by Yassar
Arafat, has recently shown signs of
willingness to take part in the peace

talks. But Heichel doubts that Arafat's
amiable gestures are real, never
theless he says they are impractical
because "this would cause conflict
with the Jordonians..."
Heichel stressed that the United
States must support both sides mili
tarily so that no country will break
the rules of the agreement. Neither
the change in administrations here
nor the untimely death of Anwar
Sadat could stop the peace process.
The initial peace-making forces from
four and one-half years ago when
Sadat went to Jerusalem remain.
"The peace process will go on be
cause of the initial situation, yet it is
obvious that the Mideast is not the
first priority for Reagan. The econo
my, the media, and getting re
elected are his priorities," Heichel

said.
Heichel stressed the importance of
the Sinai Peninsula as a buffer zone
for Israel. Geographically, he likened
Israel to a "slim, thin-waisted girl"
and showed on a map how much the
new border will allow the Egyptians
to encroach on Israel's already lim
ited land.
Also, in that area are no less than
eight air force bases, three of which
are among the best in the world, he
said. During the period that Israel
owned that land,Heichel claimed, its
government invested over $17 mil
lion in various improvement
projects, such as road and building
construction. These will all be
handed to the Egyptians as a gift on
Sunday, he said.
Not the least important of the gifts
will be the turning over of one of the
few oil fields in the nation. "This will
create new dependencies, financial
and otherwise, but the peace process
will go on — it will just be more dif
ficult."
The the question and answer peri
od following the presentation turned

into a heated debate between
Heichel and a woman from the au
dience who challenged the reliability
of many of the speaker's points and
claimed that her relatives had been
murdered by Israeli soldiers. The
program was ended one of the
speech's sponsors when Heichel and
the woman began whouting at one
another.
Earlier that evening, Heichel had
said, "The Arabs and the Israelis are
still not friends."
