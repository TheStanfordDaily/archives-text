## Soviets arm both sides in Yemen

by The Washington Post
Sanaa, North Yemen — Early
.last month in this mountainous
;land strategically located at
Saudi Arabia's southern back
door, two of the government's
;fighter bombers were shot
down by local guerrillas. Both
■the government's planes,
Sukhoi-225, and the guerrillas'
•anti-aircraft weapons, were
Supplied by Moscow.
; The incident illustrates the
;extent to which the Soviet
[Union has deftly positioned
•itself on all sides of the newly
• escalating guerrilla war here —
'►a conflict in which the United
is conspicuous by its rela
tive absence.
Three years ago, the Carter
'.administration poured $390
[million in arms here to demon
strate U.S. determination to
["draw the line" against Soviet
;expansionism in the Middle
;East. But President Jimmy
;Carter for a variety of reasons
•appeared to lose interest in the
■conflict, and the Reagan ad
ministration apparently has de
cided to ignore it despite its im
plications for the long-term se
curity of Saudi Arabia, the U.S.'

♦ Officials in the government
of North Yemen President al
Abdullah Saleh say it was this
U.S. attitude, coupled with
endless delays in Saudi aid, that
forced them in the face of on

going insurrection to turn to
the Soviets. But while Moscow
was glad to oblige with be
tween $1 billion and $2 billion
in weapons and about 600 mili
tary advisers in recent years, ac
cording to Western diplomatic
sources, it has continued to
arm the guerrillas indirectly
through Marxist South Yemen.
"If things continue as they
are, North Yemen will be a
Communist state within five
years," warned one well-in
formed Yemeni official dis
turbed by the trend of events
here.
A Western diplomat is less
alarmed about North Yemen's
immediate fate, but adds "the
parallels with Afghanistan are
there. ... But I dont think it (a
Communist takeover) will hap
pen at least for another gener
ation."
North Yemen serves as a nat
ural land corridor into the
Saudi kingdom and the uncon
trolled flow of people, goods
and arms between the two na
tions long has been an un
resolved problem.
So has Saudi influence here,
which many Yemenis view as
overweening and oppressive.*
The kingdom is North Yemen's
main financial backer and
purchaser of Western arms. At
the same time, however, the
Saudis give million of dollars in
bribes to the fiercely inde

pendent northern tribes, thus
assuring a Saudi zone of in
fluence as well as considerable
leverage over Sanaa.
Like every subject under dis
cussion here, there is no agree
ment among diplomats and
Yemeni analysts about what
Soviet strategy is toward North
Yemen, except that it is long
term and persistent. But there
can be little doubt about Mos
cow's growing presence and
importance here.
Three years ago, Carter ad
ministration officials estimated
there were 200 or fewer Soviet
advisers here and noted they
were mostly confined to an air
base outside the coastal port of
Hodeida, where they trained
Yemenis on MiG aircraft.
Today, Western diplomatic
sources concur that Soviet
numbers have roughly tripled
and say that in addition to
Hodeida, they now are training
Yemeni pilots on Sukhhoi
fighter bombers in Sanaa and
on MiG-17s in the southern city
of Taiz.
In addition, Moscow is flood
ing the country with offers of
scholarships and training
courses in the Soviet Union.
There are reportedly about
1,500 Yemenis, most of them
officers and military personnel,
on various programs there
now, one-third more than
three years ago.
By contrast, only about 60

Yemeni officers have been
trained to date in the United
States, while scholarships avail
able to Yemenis number about
25 a year, according to U.S. Em
bassy sources.
Most importantly to the sur
vival of the Saleh government
as the guerrilla war escalates,
the Soviets also have provided
most of the weapons to the
North Yemeni armed forces.
They include 650 tanks, 450 ar
mored personnel carriers,
three squadrons of MiGs and
one of Sukhois, most of
Yemen's helicopters and a
wide variety of artillery.
Ironically, the biggest Soviet
arms deal to date came shortly
after the United States poured
in nearly $400 million of Saudi
purchased arms — a squadron
of F-5Es, 64 M-bO tanks and 100
armored personnel carriers —
in March 1979. Later the same
year, Saleh, disappointed over
Saudi delays in delivering the
U.S. arms, turned to the Soviets
and concluded a deal that con
gressional sources placed at
"well in excess of $1 billion."
The shock to Washington of
this Yemeni-Soviet accord ap
parently cooled the ardor of
the Carter administraton for
sending additional U.S. arms to
Sanaa and also may have torpe
doed the development of a ma
jor bilateral economic or mili
tary assistance program here.
