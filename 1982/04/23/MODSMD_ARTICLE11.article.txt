## Soviets won't honor freeze 
### 
Viewpoint/Sidney Hook

I have just received a letter from Dr. Owen Cham
berlain of the department of physics at U.C.-Berkeley,
requesting me to support an initiative to press upon
Congress and the president the urgent need "to propose
to the Soviet Union an immediate mutual freeze on the
testing, production and deployment of all nuclear weap
ons, missiles and delivery systems."
I should have no hesitation in supporting such an in
itiative whether in California or New York if there were
any realistic prospect of the Soviet Union allowing the
rest of the world to see, openly and freely, that it is abid
ing by such an agreement. With respect to the United
States we know that in our free culture any violations of
such an agreement would be immediately reported by a
whole corps of whistle blowers to the press and other
public media. But in view of the absolute control of pub
lic opinion, the absence of a free press, or any other in
dependent means of communication, how would Soviet
violations of such an agreement become known?
Chamberlain maintains that such a freeze can be
monitored and "verified by existing national means."
But this is demonstrably false! Our satellites cannot re
veal what is hidden underground or even in large ware
houses that despite their announced purposes can con
ceal large scale production of weapons. Only unham
pered on-site inspections can provide reliable means of
verification. The United States has expressed its willing
ness to open all its territory to on-site inspections. The
Soviet Union has consistently refused to do so.
We have evidence that the Soviet Union has violated
previous agreements into which it has entered, the most
recent and outrageous of which has been the systematic
violations of the Helsinki Final Act. It also did not abide
by the agreement on the testing of nuclear weapons dur
ing Nikita Krushchev's regime. Even more recently the
Soviet Union has violated the 1972 Geneva Convention,
of which it is a signatory, on the prohibition of manufac
ture, stockpiling and use of biological weapons.
Chamberlain mentions that he is not challenging our
country's need for a strong defense. But in the absence

of adequate procedures of verification, that is precisely
what he is doing. Even worse, he is lulling his fellow
citizens into a false sense of security, despite the his
torical record.
When the United States enjoyed a monopoly of atom
ic weapons it offered to surrender it to an international
authority — a proposal accepted by all nations at the
time except the Soviet Union and its satellites. Since that
time, peace between the United States and the Soviet
Union has been achieved, in Winston Churchill's phrase,
by "a balance of terror." By making a proposal for a
freeze that cannot be verified, Chamberlain is urging a
policy that would encourage the enemies of a free socie
ty to entertain the idea of a nuclear Pearl Harbor.
I agree with Chamberlain that "If we have learned any
thing from history, it is that too often misguided leaders
have taken their nations down the path to destruction
..." but he fails to apply the lesson. It was the Cham
berlains and other self-deceived leaders of the Western
world who, in the face of Adolf Hitler's rearmament,
sought to appease him and imagined that they had won
peace in their time on the eve of the greatest war in hu
man history — precipitated by the Hitler-Stalin Pact and
union of totalitarian powers.
Instead of a nuclear freeze which would still leave
enough weapons in place that are enough to destroy ev
ery person on earth, would it not be more logical to pro
pose a reduction, gradual and then massive, of nuclear
weapons on both sides under verifiable controls? If the
Soviet Union refuses on-site inspection, the nuclear
freeze is a snare and delusion. If it accepts on-site inspec
tion, then the United States should press for progressive
multilateral reduction of nuclear arms.
Logic, history and common sense seem to me to rein
force the wisdom of this proposal and at the same time to
reveal the lack of wisdom of "an immediate nuclear
freeze."
