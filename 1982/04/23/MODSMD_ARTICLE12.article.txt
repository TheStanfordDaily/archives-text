## Threat of science seen through historical prism 
### 
In all the discussion at Stanford
dealing with the problem of nuclear
proliferation, the important process
of introspection unfortunately seems
to have been renounced. This has
been especially true of the scientific
community.
Jonathan Schell, in his compelling
and passionately reasoned essay,
"The Fate of the Earth," (New Yorker,
Feb. 1, 8 and 15) states "It is fun
damental to the shape and character
of the nuclear predicament that its
origins lie in scientific knowledge
rather than in social circumstances."
This fact he tries to impress firmly on
his reader. But what looks at first like
condemnation, is subsequently re
solved in forgiveness, for "although
it is unquestionably the scientists
who have led us to the edge of the
nuclear abyss, we would be mistaken
if we held them chiefly responsible
for our plight or looked to them par
ticularly for a solution." It is my inten
tion to argue here that apparently
those who have led us to the edge of
the abyss will gladly push us into it,
and that although we can't expect a
solution from them, we would be
wise to ask them to stop pushing.
Schell has relied heavily on the
words of various poets, novelists and
philosophers. The person most fre
quently quoted is Hannah Arendt,
the German- born political
philosopher who lived in the United
States from 1941 until her death in
1975 and "devoted so much attention
to the unprecedented evils that have
appeared in our century." Following
Schell, I would like herto accompany
me as well along a somewhat treach
erous path.
Whenever Arendt broaches the
subject of nuclear arms it is usually in
connection with some musing on
modern science. For example: "Not
only has the progress of science
ceased to coincide with the progress
of mankind (whatever that may
mean), but it could even spell man
kind's end, just as the further
progress of scholarship may well end
with the destruction of everything
that made scholarship worth our
while."
Thus, science has provided us with
a double threat. First, progress as

manifested in the implementations
of science in fact threatens us with
extinction. Second, the world as we
know it speaks in the language of sci
ence, a fact that cannot be overem
phasized (although it is taken for
granted), and it is this reality that ren
ders us impotent to recognize and
counter the threat of annihilation.
These dangers have not gone un
noticed as science developed into its
present form. Goethe, who lived in
the 18th century and who en
gaged himself in science as well as
art, was prescient when he had one
of his protagonists say: "I can well
understand that it must please you,
sages of the sky, to bring the im
mense universe gradually as close to
your eyes as I saw that planet just now
... But allow me to say these instru
ments, with which we aid our senses,
have a morally detrimental effect on
man ... For what he sees with his
senses is out of keeping with inner
faculty of discernment." It was such
intuition, I believe, and surely not a
conjecture of the innate energy in
matter, which led both Kierkegaard
and Nietzsche, in the 19th century, to
assert that the natural sciences would
help engineer the destruction of
man.
"It would be absurd," writes
Arendt, "to ignore the most potent
factor, for which, moreover, no pre
cedent and no analogy exist — the
simple fact that technological
'progress' is leading in so many in
stances straight into disaster; that the
sciences, taught and learned by this
generation, seem not merely unable
to undo the disastrous consequences
of their own technology but have
reached a stage where 'there's no
damn thing that can't be turned into
war.' " And she maintains that "noth
ing is more important to the integrity
of the universities — which ... have
betrayed a public trust when they be
came dependent on government
sponsored research projects — than
a rigorously enforced di ce from
war-oriented research and all con
nected enterprises."
We would be naive to deny that
the consequences of our alliance
with the military are significant, but
at the same time we would find it dif

ficult to arrive at a generally accepted
context in which to regard the prob
lem. The Stanford community has by
and large dealt with this difficulty by
disposing of it altogether. In fact, the
degree to which this university in
particular depends on the military
complex for funding as well as the
degree to which the military complex
relies upon the University for its
brain-power is something which is
largely covered up or shrouded in
mystery from a public that is not so
much unsuspecting but rather un
concerned with knowing. I mean to
refer here not only to under
graduates or graduate students in the
humanities for example, but also
those in the middle of this non-con
troversy — the multitude of graduate
students in the applied sciences who,
upon arriving at Stanford, set out to
become associated with a particular
research project, are assured that
"there's lots of money around," and
neither ask nor are told exactly
where the money comes from.
This silent agreement to ask no
questions and reveal no answers
gives the lie to any genuine willing
ness to confront the problem of the
"fate of the earth" in all its tortuous
immensity. It is characteristic of the
ambiguity at the heart of the prob
lem: the reluctance to accept that, in
Schell's words, "if a man discovers
that improvements he is making to
his house threaten to destroy its
foundation he is well advised to re
think them," rather than to opt for
the "strange double life of the world
which has continued up to the pres
ent." For "the society that has ac
cepted the threat of its utter destruc
tion ... cannot be at the same time
asleep and awake, insane and sane,
against life and for life."
A notable exception to the general
rule of silence is a column which Joe
Walder wrote for the Daily (Nov. 12)
in which he stated quite simply that
"the necessity for scientists to recog
nize the ethical implications of mili
tary research is urgent." To be sure,
this is the single context in which tru
ly meaningful discussion regarding
the military connection and the arms

race can take place. Indeed, the hotly
disputed issue of "academic free
dom" becomes minor and even ir
relevant in this context, because it
takes place in a milieu which accepts
(and leaves unchallenged) only one
ethical principle — the inherent
sanctity of the research itself.
When confronted with the issue of
ethics and Stanford's dependence
upon the military, the most common
reactions tend to sanction a conti
nuance of things as they are. First,
there is the proverbial appeal to the
inevitability of evil; in other words,
since things won't change, why
should one bother to change them —
a reprehensible indulgence in self
fuifilling prophecy. Then, there is the
fallacy that one person can't make a
difference. While the action of one
person would make moral sense,
there are enough examples in history
to show that one person can also
make a practical difference.
Are we deluded in thinking that
the future may bring with it some
positive change? "The future," writes
Arendt, "is. 'like a time-bomb,
buried, but ticking away in the pres
ent.' To the often-heard question:
Who are they, this new generation?
one is tempted to answer, Those who
hear the ticking. And to the other
question: Who are they who utterly
deny them? the answer may well be,
Those who do not know, or refuse to
face things as they really are."
