# Frats discriminate justifiably
## 
### 
Tuesday bids go out. A sizable
number of freshman males will be in
vited to join a fraternity. An almost
equal number will be rejected by the
people they have spent the last three
weeks getting to know at parties,
softball games and beach trips. The

pain of those rejected will be as real
as the happiness of those accepted. A
system based on discrimination will
have discriminated once more. It
seems an appropriate time to ask
some questions about the existence
of fraternities at Stanford.
Should fraternities be allowed to
exist at an enlightened educational
institution such as ours? Yes. Dis
crimination is not evil in and of itself.
Judgment depends on the criteria
used to discriminate and the ends
toward which disrimination is em
ployed. Stanford discriminates
against academically ill-prepared ap
plicants in order to maintain educa
tional standards. That's acceptable.
Criticism of the admissions process
challenges the accuracy of
assessment techniques but not the
propriety of that assessment.
Fraternity rush is abhorrent to
many because they believe that so
cial discrimination is being practiced.
The idea of such a judgement vio
lates the premise of equality upon
which our society is based. Why
should the university sanction the ex
istence of an organization that sets
itself up as social judge and enforces
its judgements upon those who seek
membership?

Does this mean we
lack diversity? Only if
you believe that we
are one-dimensional
individuals to begin
withâ€¢

The answer lies in the fraternity
critics' definition of our membership
criteria. It is incorrect. My judgment
is based on my two years of ex
perience living in my fraternity. I can
not speak for fraternity systems at
other schools and, perhaps, I cannot
even speak for other fraternities at
Stanford. But in the two years that I
have lived in my house and during
the two rushes in which I have partic
ipated as an active member, I have
never heard anyone say that we look
ing for, or were getting, the "best
people."
Do you seriously think that we are
that elitist? The people who cast
votes at bid meetings aren't some
special breed of social Darwinists,
possessed of the belief that they, or

anyone else for that matter, can
measure a person's value.
"Well, what are the criteria,then)"
you may ask. The most important is
commitment. We join fraternitiesbe
cause we want to belong to a close
living group. We want the peoplevve
live with to be as interested ingettins
to know us as we are in getting to
know them. If you just want a placeto
sleep and take your meals, then we
will not give you the opportunity of
joining our house because you will
be taking the spot of someone else
who might have become a close
friend.
I don't think our critics reallyun
derstand how important commit
ment is to us. You sit there at the rush
party staring at this guy who is all
smiles and friendly to a fault wonder
ing if he is just looking for three yeais
of guaranteed housing in a nice loca
tion with a lot of social opportunities.
Will this same guy "blow off the
house," taking advantage ofwhatit
has to offer but never giving of
himself and never reaching out to
those around him?
Although commitment is the sin
gle most important criteria, it is not
the only one. Fraternity membersarej
human beings and the tendency to
self-select is not completely esap
dble. Common interests play atiji
part in the rush process, but perhaps'
they should. Ideally, you and I need
not have anything more in common
than the desire to get to know one
another in order to become friends,
but Stanford is not an ideal world.
Time is limited and the tendency to
become self-absorbed is great. Some
degree of common interests pro
vides a necessary social lubricant.
Does this mean that we lack diver
sity? Only if you believe that we are
one-dimensional individuals to be
gin with. I regard my fraternity as
being a living experience richer indi
versity than most on campus. Al
though there may not be as wide a
range of people as in the general
campus population, the level of in
teraction is much higher. Since you
really get to know everyone in the
house, you truly experience the di
versity of other people's views and
characters.
Such a criteria towards suchanend
seems acceptable to me. Like the Ad
missions Office, however, we have
problems applying our criteria. Run
is a superficial process. We try hard
not to make it so. After all, like Dean
Fred "we live with our mistakes. We
do our best to get to know those who
pay us the compliment of wanting to
join our house and we usually regret
not being able to take a lot moreo
them.
