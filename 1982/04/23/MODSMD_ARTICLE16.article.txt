## Counting down to Ground Zero: campus reactors Viewpoint/Daniel Kaplan Nuclear strategists succeed in word, fail in their realism 
### 
[It is a troubling feature of debate on nuclear weap
s that the jargon and pat scenarios of nuclear
ategists are used often, while plain facts about nu
ear weapons and their effects are ignored. Many in
rmed people pride themselves on their fluency
ith the arcane terms of nuclear discussion, but
rongly believe that so long as the language is gram
latically used, what they say makes sense. This fallacy
js appeared recently in arguments in favor of build
ig more land-based missiles or an anti-ballistic mis
|e system, some of which have been published in the
ai/y (April 14).
One of the most basic distinctions in the language
112 nuclear strategy is between counterforce and
ountervalue attacks. A counterforce attack is one
iat attempts to destroy missiles, bombers, sub
lines and other instruments of nuclear war. A
ountervalue attack is directed against people, cities
dd industry. This distinction had fallen into disuse
ptil a few years ago, but it has been polished up for
mployment in the discussion about whether Ameri
i needs more land-based missiles.
The argument in favor of building more land-based
lissiles goes something like this. Sometime in the
jture the Soviets may have the technical capability of
lunching a counterforce attack which could destroy
large proportion of American land-based missiles,
yhile it is true that the United States will have enough
urviving forces (mainly on submarines) to obliterate
ie Soviet Union, there is still a problem. Only land
ased missiles are accurate enough to be used in a
ounterforce counter-attack. These will no longer ex
|t in sufficient number, so the president is left with a
ough choice: should he retaliate with a countervalue
jttack on Soviet cities or do nothing.
If Soviet cities are attacked, the president invites
reneral nuclear war. Therefore, the president must

do nothing. Just as we have figured this out, the Sovi
ets know it. Confident that the president will do noth
ing in response, the Soviet Union is encouraged to
aunch their attack. Fortunately, there is an easy
though expensive) solution â€” build more land-,
>ased missiles until there are so many that the Soviets s
couldn't attack them all. |\%
There are many flaws in this argument, but I will
concentrate on one. Assume that the Soviets have;at
tacked America's missiles and have knocked them all
out. It will no doubt be recorded in a footnote in the
military history of the war that between two and 20
million Americans died in this "counterforce" attack. K
(These figures, and those that follow, come from a
1979 Office of Technology Assessment report.) The
president now must decide how to respond to the So
viet attack.
Let us ask, why would the president order a re
taliatory attack on the Soviet Union? One motive
would be to destroy Soviet missiles so they could not
attack American cities. But it would be virtually im
possible to destroy enough Soviet weapons to render
the Soviets unable to incinerate the United States. The
motive remaining to the president is pure retaliation,
either out of hatred or the desire to convince the So
viets not to attack again.
If the president is able and orders a counter-attack
on Soviet missiles, between two and 10 million Soviet
citizens will die within.3o days and more will die from
the long-term effects of radiation. In terms of num
bers of deaths, this is about equivalent to a coun
tervalue attack on Leningrad and Kiev.
What will the Soviets do in return? We have no way
of knowing, but nuclear wisdom has it that since the
president has ordered a counterforce attack, the Sovi
ets will treat it as just and proper retaliation for their
original attack. They will do nothing in response. On

the other hand, if the president ordered the destruc
tion of Leningrad, it would be a countervalue attack
which, it is claimed, the Soviets would see as esca
lation. They would attack American cities in return.
In reality, though, there is little difference in effect
between a counterforce attack and a limited coun
tervalue attack. It seems likely, then, that there would
% be little difference in response to the two types of at
tack. It is only in the minds of nuclear strategists that it
matters whether people are killed on purpose or as a
side effect. The distinction between counterforce and
countervalue is a subtle one; so subtle that it eludes
- *ven the facts.
So, the choice that the president would face after a

Soviet attack against American missiles is not either to
attack Soviet missiles or do nothing. The choice is
whether to launch any sort of retaliatory attack on the
Soviet Union or not. A retaliatory attack the threat of
which would be severe and plausible enough to deter
the Soviets from attacking in the first place could well
be carried out without the need for land-based mis
siles and their ability to be used as counterforce
weapons. The argument for building more land
based missiles, which makes some sense when it is
couched in the language of the nuclear strategist, fails
when examined realistically.
