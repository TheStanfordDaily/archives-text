## Nuclear freeze bandwagon becomes latest fad in causes 
### 
Recent Headlines in the Daily
nd elsewhere proclaim a new
nd disturbing trend in the übi
uitous public opinion — the
rass roots call for a nuclear arms
eeze. Of course any sane human
eing abhors the thought of nu
iear war and bemoans the waste- <
|luse of resources in expanding a
uclear arsenal. However, i fail to
fee any justification for a unilat
iral arms freeze.
This simple, naive solution fits

easily into newspaper headlines,
makes for a rousing speech and
stirs up a bored citizenry, but ul
timately does nothing more than
ignore the problem or wish it
away. We cannot alter the fact that
we live in a nuclear world. For all
its potentially deadly problems,
this is the world with which we
must deal.
It is encouraging that the grave
importance of this issue has man

aged to impact, however super
ficially, a large section of the pop
ulace, but we need people willing
to think about the problem and
work for responsible solutions
rather than petition signers and
concert goers. One can only
watch with pity and disgust as our
national politia I leaders jump on
this misguided "freeze"
bandwagon.
I cannot help but feel that the
sudden emergence of a call for a

unilateral arms freeze is merely
the latest fad in causes. Its rise sim
ply serves to further the deep
ening impression that the people
of the United States, and their im
age-obsessed leaders, are losing
their ability to face reality.
