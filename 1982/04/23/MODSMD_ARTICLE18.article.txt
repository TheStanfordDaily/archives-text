# Proposal/Richard Hefter
## Make Stanford voice heard in D.C. 
### 
The word is out: people are
starting to realize that nuclear
bombs could get nasty. Now it's
time to educate our leaders of this
fact. Our voices must carry across
to Washington calling for an end
to this insane arms race. Let each
of us strengthen the community
voice by attending rallies and
educational events and signing
petitions.
Many still believe that the Sovi
ets are the instigators in this arms
race. But historian George Ken
nan sets the record straight: " .. .
it has been we Americans who, at
almost every step of the road,
have taken the lead in the de
velopment of this sort of weapon
ry. It was we who first produced

and tested such a device; we who
were the first to raise its destruc
tiveness to a new level with the
hydrogen bomb; we who in
troduced the multiple warhead;
we who have declined every pro
posal for the renunciation of the
principle of "first use"; and we
alone, so help us Cod, who have
used the weapon in anger against
others, and against tens of
thousands of helpless non-com
batants at that."
America must take the initiative
in calling for a bilateral arms
freeze, and its citizens can hasten
this process by exercising their
democratic rights. Not only
should we voice our protest in
groups, but individually we
should write our representatives
in Washington. How about some
thing like:
"Dear Senator/Congressman/Mr.
President,
I implore you to make every ef
fort to halt the production of nu
clear arms in this country and
throughout the world. The con
tinuation of humankind and the
environment as we know it must
be the central issue concerning
our nation. A nation's pride over
its war arsenal is ludicrous when
human beings are suffering so,
and indeed the race as a whole

faces possible extinction. There is
now more tonnage of explosives
in the world than there is food.
Further, only 10 percent of the
40,000 nuclear warheads amassed
between the two superpowers
could destroy the ozone layer
enough to blind all animal life.
We must ask the Soviets to join
us in a bilateral nuclear arms
freeze; from there the two nations
might negotiate to reduce their
weaponry and concentrate on the
problem of enforcing non-pro
liferation worldwide. Both super
powers presently have what is
more than needed for viable de
terrence. And each has the in
telligence capability to monitor
the other's honesty. Then why
does the Reagan administration
insist on a "window of vulner
ability"?
Is it national defence that the
administration is concerned with?
Perhaps it is national prestige â€”
the desire to lead the Soviets and
maintain the American fantasy of
being the "strongest nation on
Earth." Let us instead be the most
human-loving one. We can begin
by proposing a nuclear freeze to
the Soviets. Later, perhaps, the
two nations might work together
to better the lot of humankind
rather than destroy it... "
