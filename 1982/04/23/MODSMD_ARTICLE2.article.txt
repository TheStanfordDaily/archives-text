nuclear dilemma the world finds

we haven't developed the com

ed for the Nobel Peace Prize, first
gested that the government isn't
h willing to tell its own people
pt is really happening. He claimed

"people aren't as aware that
1 spent fuel is reprocessed and
■

used to add more bombs to our al
ready- large supply," said Brower. Re
said that the reprocessing itself is ex
tremely risky since if technicians ever
make a mistake, the reprocessor
could release more harmful radiation
than would all existing nuclear weap
ons put together.
The superpowers' unwillingness to
negotiate a sound solution to the
problem of the nuclear build-up is
due to human wastefulness, Brower
said. An example of this wastefulness,
he continued, is that "although hu
mans were the last step in the com
pletion the earth as we know it,
somehow we've always felt it our
privilege to attack the earth's non
renewable sources. The extent to
which we do this is growing ex
ponentially."
About half of Brower's speech was
devoted to speaking about The Fate
of the Earth, a book by Jonathan
Schell which appeared in the New
Yorker beginning last February.
Schell's book contended that the
world has been living according to
"the law of fear which could take us
on a ride from sovereignty through
human extinction."
Brower said that according to
Shell's book, man faces extinction if a
nuclear exchange ever occurs. Even
people who aren't killed immediate
ly will be affected by the loss of sight
and the death of all the earth's plants
