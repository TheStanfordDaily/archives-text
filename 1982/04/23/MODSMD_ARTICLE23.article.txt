with a small lock at
to it, steel rods, scotch
bells, brushes,
cks, a power drill, a pile
Ig , prisms, clips, tiny

cymbals and tenfold other in
animate objects.
Frith brought these objects
to life in his performance of im
provisations that explored the
perimeters of musical po.v
bilities.
Frith, who is most well
known for his work as a
guitarist in the now defunct
British progressive rock band
Henry Cow, delights in the
spontaneity and juxtaposition
of sounds in the "constant de
velopment" of effects and
techniques that his live music
employs. "When you decide to
do improvised music there's
always the danger that you're
going to make a complete as
shole of yourself," said the 33-
year-old England-born but
New York-based musician. He
added, "That danger aspect in
terests me."
"If you're embarking on a
course of playing improvised
music it means that your ideas
are subtly changing constant
ly from concept to concept. At
any given moment you may be
in the process of changing a
particular idea, guarding an
other idea and discovering a
third idea, and t+iese ideas are
constantly interchanging."
Frith's idiomatic and some
times obscure style kept his
standing-room-only audience
rapt with, if nothing

else, the bizarre nature of what
they were seeing him do. He
played his instruments as if he
had to embattle them to win
the sounds he wanted. With an
expression somewhere be
tween deep concentration and
an enlightened grin, he
plucked the strings with his
hands, assualted them with a
power drill, and violently de
manded resonance from them
with a bow like an enraged vio
linist.
Frith's concert also had a
mellow side: an effect he pro
duced by dropping shreds of
paper onto his guitars was as
soothing as the sound of rain
drops. By sliding his bow across
a screw attached to one of his
homemade instruments he
evoked a musical image as
pleasingly familiar as the sound
Of a baby's gibberish.
Many of Frith's musical an
tics drew laughter from his au
dience in much the same way
that comic relief in theater in
duces laughter from those
viewing an intense play, al
though it was not always his in
tention. At one point in his per
formance Frith turned on a ra
dio that he sometimes uses in
his improv and was "pleasantly
surprised" to find that it was
coincidently tuned to a broad
cast of a Golden State Warriors
basketball game.

The crowd roared when he
parodied the announcer's
voice over a distorted micro
phone at the start of a piece, ' if
I do something that people
find funny that's fine, I'm not
trying to be serious, but that's
just one small aspect of what
I'm trying to do," said Frith.
In addition to doing live en
gagements all over the world
(he recently completed a 10
gig tour of Japan and performs
in Europe frequently), Frith is
also a highly acclaimed studio
artist who has collaborated
with Brian Eno (on "Music For
Films") and Robert Wyatt.
Frith's own label, San Fran
cisco based Ralph Records,
with whom he has an arrange
ment to do five albums of "in
strumental composed music,"
was recently called "the
strangest record company in
the Bay Area" by a local colum
nist. "Or anywhere else for that
matter," Frith is quick to add.
"Why do you think I signed
with them?"
Ralph, whose studios also
host the underground exploits
of Bay rock iconoclasts The
Residents, musical minimalists
Tuxedomoon, and the weird
ness of Snakefinger are cele
brating a decade of "strange
ness" this year... it must sell.
Frith's first in the set of five
albums for Ralph,called"Grav

ity", is said to be "nothing short
of brilliant" and the second,
entitled "Speechless", which is
Frith's exploration of the ef
fects of losing one's voice, is
also the product of increasing
critical acclaim. Frith is already
working on the third album in
the series on which he plans to
record using some of the same
homemade instruments he
used in concert here.
Junior Bob Buika,
teacher of a class called "Ex
perimental and Avant-Garde
Rock: 1965 to present", formed
an organization called "Ruins
Unlimited" and arranged to
have Frith perform here in an
exclusive Bay Area en
gagement free to the public.
Fred Frith ended his concert
with a slow quiet piece that he
played on six-string bass guitar
while three amplified
metronomes set at different
speeds beat randomly in the
background. He finished the
piece, left the stage and exited
through the auditorium's back
door which locked behind
him, thereby dashing a wildly
applauding audience's hopes
for an encore. One can only
hazard a guess at what his en
core might of been. Fred Frith
remains an enigma, and he
probably wouldn't have it any
other way.
