## Giants nip Card in exhibition 
### Adam Berns 
The Stanford baseball team
lost a narrow 6-5 baseball ex
hibition game against the San
Francisco Giants, but the real
winner was the Stanford
Diamond Club which stands to
gain $6000 or $7000 from the
game.
"We really are appreciative
that the Giants were able to
make it down," Stanford coach
Mark Marquess said after the
game. "It's great for the Stan
ford baseball team and it's
great for the community.
"They kind of had an off day
today and I realize that it is hard
for them to play this kind of a
game."
The Giants were coming off a
tough 7-6 loss to the San Diego
Padres last night and did not
play one of their better games
yesterday. Coupled with some
spectacular catches and solid
hitting by the Cardinal, the
game stayed close the whole
way. Stanford actually had a 5-3
lead going into the top of the
eighth inning.
Cardinal center fielder Dar
ryl Stephens led the Stanford
attack, getting two hits in four
at bats — including a home
run.
Stanford sent five different
pitchers to the mound. Steve
Cottrell pitched the first two
innings, followed by John

Radtke, Doug Gwaltney, David
Harris (who was tagged with
the loss), and Mike Sullivan.
Ratke, who pitched two in
nings, was clearly yesterday's
star, giving up one hit and fac
ing just six batters in two com
plete innings. His two innings
included back to back
stikeouts of Giant All-Stars Joe
Morgan and Jack Clark.
The Giants started Renie
Martin, and then went to Fred
Breining in the sixth inning. Jim
Barr came in to pitch the bot
tom of the ninth. Breining was
credited with the win.
The way the game started out
it looked like it was going to be
a rout Giant center fielder
Chili Davis pounded a 3-2 pitch
over the right field fence to
start off the game. After Joe
Morgan flied out to left, Jack
Clark came up and hit a home
run that probably still has not
hit the ground — going over
the red fence and bleachers in
the adjacent Harry Maloney
Field. First baseman Dave
Bergman and third baseman
Darryl Evans both followed by
flying out to end the inning.
Stanford came back in the
bottom of the inning to get a
run back. Left fielder Mike
Dotterer led off theinning with
a perfect bunt down the third
baseline. Showing no sense of
awe, Dotterer went ahead and

stole second. Second baseman
Steve Buechelle followed with
a walk, putting runners on first
and second. First baseman
Mike Aldrete then hit a high
grounder which Martin could
not handle, and although he
was thrown out at first, Dot
terer and Buechelle moved
ahead a base. Pinch hitter Eric
Hardgrave then hit a fly ball to
center field, scoring Dotterer,
and making the score 2-1.
In the top of the second in
ning, San Fransisco catcher Jeff
Ransom doubled to left field.
He was later thrown out at the
plate by Stephens while trying
to score on a single by Milt
May.
The Cardinal tied the game
in the bottom of the second
when Stephens pounded a
home run over the left field
fence.
In the fourth inning, Stan
ford scored two more runs.
Bob Hausladen led off the in
ning with a double to center
field. Hardgrave followed with
a home run to left.
The Giants narrowed the
Cardinal lead to 4-3, scoring a
run in the 'ifth. San Francisco
catcher Jeff Ransom led off the
inning with a double to left
field and then scored when
shortstop Johnnie LeMaster
followed with a single.
LeMaster was thrown out

trying to stretch it into a double
on a questionable call at sec
ond base.
In the top of the seventh in
ning/ right fielder Mike Tooth
man robbed the Giants'
Champ Summers of a hit by
making a diving catch in right
field.
In the bottom of the inning,
Stanford stretched its lead to
5-3. After MikeToothman flied
out, Stephens hit a single to
center field. He then was run
ning on a wild pitch by Brein
ing and was able to make it to
third base. Shortstop Bob De-
Costa followed with a bloop
single to right field, scoring
Stephens.
The Giants tagged Cardinal
pitcher David Harris for three
runs in the eighth innning to
retake the lead. Milt May led
off the inning with a single to
right field. After Davis flied out
to center, Duane Kuiper sin
gled to center, putting runners
on first and second. Jim
Wohlford walked to load the
bases. Harris next got Bergman
to fly out, but Guy Salarz fol
lowed with a triple which
scored three runs and gave San
Francisco a 6-5 lead.
Barr came in to pitch the
ninth inning, and after right
fielder Mike Toothman led off
the inning with a single, the

next three batters went down
in order.
Stephens, who played an ex
ceptional game in center field
and had a good day at the plate,
was happy with his per
formance and that of the team,
but only wished that they could
have played as well against Ari
zona State.
"It felt good today, but it
would have been even better
hitting as well when the game
counts, like yesterday or the
day before," Stephens said af
ter the game.
One sidelight to the game
was the performance of the
Mizuno fielding gloves which
were to electronically relay sig
nals between the manager,
catcher and pitcher. The glove
which Stanford was going to
use broke down before the
game and was not tested.

The way the game started out
it looked like it was going to be
a rout Giant center fielder
Chili Davis pounded a 3-2 pitch
over the right field fence to
start off the game. After Joe
Morgan flied out to left, Jack
Clark came up and hit a home
run that probably still has not
hit the ground — going over
the red fence and bleachers in

Bergman and third baseman
Darryl Evans both followed by
flying out to end the inning.
Stanford came back in the

awe, Dotterer went ahead and

Steve Buechelle followed with
a walk, putting runners on first
and second. First baseman
Mike Aldrete then hit a high
grounder which Martin could
not handle, and although he
was thrown out at first, Dot
terer and Buechelle moved
ahead a base. Pinch hitter Eric
Hardgrave then hit a fly ball to
center field, scoring Dotterer,
and making the score 2-1.
In the top of the second in
ning, San Fransisco catcher Jeff
Ransom doubled to left field.
He was later thrown out at the
plate by Stephens while trying
to score on a single by Milt
May.
The Cardinal tied the game
in the bottom of the second
when Stephens pounded a
home run over the left field
fence.
In the fourth inning, Stan
ford scored two more runs.
Bob Hausladen led off the in
ning with a double to center
field. Hardgrave followed with
a home run to left.
The Giants narrowed the

run in the 'ifth. San Francisco
catcher Jeff Ransom led off the

ning/ right fielder Mike Tooth
man robbed the Giants'
Champ Summers of a hit by
making a diving catch in right
field.
In the bottom of the inning,

next three batters went down
in order.
Stephens, who played an ex
ceptional game in center field
and had a good day at the plate,
was happy with his per
formance and that of the team,
but only wished that they could
have played as well against Ari
zona State.
"It felt good today, but it
would have been even better
hitting as well when the game
counts, like yesterday or the
day before," Stephens said af
ter the game.
One sidelight to the game
was the performance of the
Mizuno fielding gloves which
were to electronically relay sig
nals between the manager,
catcher and pitcher. The glove
which Stanford was going to
use broke down before the
game and was not tested.
The Stanford baseball team
lost a narrow 6-5 baseball ex
hibition game against the San
Francisco Giants, but the real
winner was the Stanford
Diamond Club which stands to
gain $6000 or $7000 from the
game.
"We really are appreciative
that the Giants were able to
make it down," Stanford coach
Mark Marquess said after the
game. "It's great for the Stan
ford baseball team and it's
great for the community.
"They kind of had an off day
today and I realize that it is hard
for them to play this kind of a
game."
The Giants were coming off a
tough 7-6 loss to the San Diego
Padres last night and did not
play one of their better games
yesterday. Coupled with some
spectacular catches and solid
hitting by the Cardinal, the
game stayed close the whole
way. Stanford actually had a 5-3
lead going into the top of the
eighth inning.
Cardinal center fielder Dar
ryl Stephens led the Stanford
attack, getting two hits in four
at bats — including a home
run.
Stanford sent five different
pitchers to the mound. Steve
Cottrell pitched the first two
innings, followed by John

Radtke, Doug Gwaltney, David
Harris (who was tagged with
the loss), and Mike Sullivan.
Ratke, who pitched two in
nings, was clearly yesterday's
star, giving up one hit and fac
ing just six batters in two com
plete innings. His two innings
included back to back
stikeouts of Giant All-Stars Joe
Morgan and Jack Clark.
