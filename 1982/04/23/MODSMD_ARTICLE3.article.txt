president Alvaro Magana, president for the last 15 years of the
Salvadoran Mortgage Bank. It also appeared to have wrecked the plans
°f two rightist political parties to take control of the government.
Magana would not be head of a government of national unity, which
h « been the goal ever since the March 28 elections of talks among the
warring major parties, because the far-right Nationalist Republican Al

f °rmer junta member Gen. Arnoldo Adolfo Majano, a reformist o ficer
w ho was exiled in 1980 after losing a power struggle with the military
r 'ghtwing.
M agana, 57, a native of the western city of Ahuachapan, is also a law
yer and did graduate work in economics in the United States. He is re
dded at the U.S. Embassy here as a highly capable administrator with
no Political party affiliation.
