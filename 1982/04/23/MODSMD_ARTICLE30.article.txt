Old Mistresses: Women, Art and Ideol

The evidence is in. Exceptionally fine
women artists have painted, sculpted, ex
hibited and sold their art for the past five
centuries and more. But why is it that we
have not seen their work before; how is it
that their names are still deleted from the
standard texts on the history of art; where
can one go to see the permanent installation
of the work of women artists?
Old Mistresses: Women, Art and Ideology
attempts to answer such questions. It is the
best new publication to appear since the
feverish mid '70s. Rozsika Parker and
Griselda Pollock examine sexism in art his
tory as a largely unconscious reproduction
of the ideologies of patriarchal society. The
establishment of periodically changing as
sumptions about art and the artist and the
historical standards for the evaluation and
hierarchy of what constitutes works of art
have been the prerogatives of men. Men
have invented, as Parker and Pollock would
have us understand, a maleable "feminine
stereotype" for the past 500 years and more:
"Women and all their activities are charac
terized as the antithesis of cultural creativity,
making the notion of a woman artist a con
tradiction in terms," the authors write.
Readers familiar with Simone de Beau
voir's The Second Sex will recognize this
theme. The authors provide recent art

If, as the authors advocate,
women establish their own
institutions for exhibition
and promotion of their
work, will this work
continue to be perceived
mainly as political rather
than visual art and ignored
accordingly?

criticism to document their point that our
culture still sanctions only named individuals
and certain forms of art over all other ex
pressions of creativity. They quote Ralph
Pomeroy from his book Art and Artists:
"I am going to forget, in order to really see
them, that a group of Navajo blankets are not
only that. In order to consider them, as I feel
they ought to be considered — as Art with a
capital 'A' — I am going to look at them as
paintings — created with dye instead of can
vas —by several nameless masters... of ab
stract art." (italics by the authors)

Parker and Pollock see the 70s histories of
women artists as modestly aimed at annexing
individual women artists to the mainstream
of the established field where standards fcr
admittance are prescribed by male his
torians. As Anne Sutherland Harris writes:
"Slowly these artists must be integrated into
their art historical context. For too long they
have either been omitted altogether or
isolated and discussed only as women, not
simply as artists as if in some strange way they
were not part of their culture at all."
On the other hand, the authors argue for a
feminist deconstruction of the present struc
ture of the history of art in order to study the
specific ways that women have "made art
under different constraints at different peri
ods, affected as much by factors of class as by
their sex."
Histories of women artists published in the
70s, discovering "our hidden heritage" in
the dusty storage basements of museums
and attics of the world, posited a slow but
steady progress in women's art and status.
Conversely, Parker and Pollock view women
artists as having had a fugitive history at besp
at all times they have had to calibrate their
admission to the"club" by an acceptable
"natural femininity" determined by suc
cessive male cultural arbiters who both
created the stereotype and defined ad
missible standards for all women.
What characterizes Old Mistresses and
makes its contribution to the literature dis
tinctive, if flawed, is the attempt to establish
a "framework for the understanding of the
significance of sexual differences in our cul
ture."
I found much of the treatment of the art of
women painters, sculptors, collagists, em

broiderers and quilters of the sixteenth
through the nineteenth centuries redundant
and lacking in the brilliance and scholarship
found in Sutherland Harrisand Nochlin. Still,
a fine analysis of aspects of the work of the
French eighteenth century painter, Elisabeth
Vigee-Lebrun, illuminates the crux of Parker
and Pollock's argument and is worth a brief
description here.
Vigee-Lebrun's undated self-portrait,
showing a Rubens'-inspired pose and
chapeau, conveys above all a coquetish, sen
sual artist who captivated royal society on
the eve of the revolution. "She offers herself
as a beautiful object to be looked at, enjoyed
and admired, but conveys nothing of the ac
tivity, the work, the mindfulness of the art
she purports to pursue," Parker and Pollock
write. The authors establish the notion that
only beautiful women artists could succeed
in eighteenth century society; Vigee-Lebrun
heightened the "feminine stereotype" in
her self-portrait. Her commissioned portrait
of a fashionable painter,' .jbert Robert, an
ticipated future Romantic versions of the vi
sionary, unkept Artist with grubby nails and
messy hair. Robert is portrayed as being pre
occupied by his own thoughts and heedless
of the viewer. Here, then, are two stere-

otypes: one the woman and the other the ar
tist, each painted by a woman artist.
The least convincing part of this book, a
chapter entitled "Painted Ladies," treats the
transformation of women's concepts of their
bodies. The somewhat hackneyed theme of
the female nude in the history of art has been
definitively treated by the feminist art critic,
John Berger, in Ways of Seeing. I found the
authors off the mark in their treatment of
Paula Modersohn-Becker, one of the single
most important painters in modern art.
Modersohn-Becker's is the first nude self
portrait of a woman in the history of art.

What an act of courage given the "feminine
stereotype" thesis. What middle class wom
an of early twentieth century Germany
would have had the intellectual independ
ence to portray herself nude?
Instead of being seductive as are previous
male portrayals of female nudes and many
female self-portraits as well, Paula's portrait
shows herself the first socially and artistically
liberated woman among us. Not only that, as
one feminist critic Carol Duncan points out.
"Rare is the image of a naked woman whose
head so outweighs her body."
The most stimulating part of the book,
aside from its original premise that art history
is a male construct designed to keep women
forever locked into a "feminine" stereotype
which shifts and changes according to the
particular cultural milieu, is the chapter on
twentieth century art. The authors glossed
over a great deal of interesting material re
cently published on the work and writings of
lovers and wives of artists who were them
selves accomplished artists and the equal of
their partners: I am thinking here of
Gabriele Munther, Sophie Tauber-Arp and
Sonia Delaunay. A monument of feminist
publication awaits the scholar able to tackle
the work of these accomplished artists of our
century who chose to live in the shadows of
their men.
Parker and Pollock tantalize the reader
with a presentation of the feminist possi
bilities of Surrealism in their "cult of the
feminine as opposed to the celebration of
machismo sexuality in art, the notion of artist
as medium rather than domineering, order
ing force, the search for hidden, mysterious
meanings by a variety of techniques all
opened the way for women's participation in
the movement."
They also illuminate the exemplary role
played by Eva Hesse, the sculptor whose trag
ic death in 1970 at the age of 34 terminated a
life whose accomplishments seemed to have
transcended the male/female syndrome de
scribed throughout the book.
As Hesse once remarked, "The way to beat
discrimination in art is by art. Excellence has
no sex." Her Hang Up shows us an emty
frame, obsessively bandaged and carefully
painted. "What is significant," write the au
thors, "is that Hesse refused to put woman or
even herself on view."
Hang Up created in 1966, is a unique
sculptural response to the implication of Ab
stract Expressionism and Color Field painting
of her predecessors. Yet, despite Hesse's
critical acclaim, it is virtually impossible to
see examples of her work in public museums
and galleries.
The single exceptions mind is at the UC-
Berkeley Art Museum where an entire wall is
given to a very late piece comprised of shim
mering sheets of gauze impregnated with
latex.
Depressing as it is, Old Mislresses helps to
formulate for the decade of the '80s some of

Conversely, Parker and Pollock view women
artists as having had a fugitive history at besp
at all times they have had to calibrate their
admission to the"club" by an acceptable
"natural femininity" determined by suc
cessive male cultural arbiters who both
created the stereotype and defined ad
missible standards for all women.
What characterizes Old Mistresses and
makes its contribution to the literature dis
tinctive, if flawed, is the attempt to establish
a "framework for the understanding of the
significance of sexual differences in our cul
ture."
I found much of the treatment of the art of
women painters, sculptors, collagists, em

broiderers and quilters of the sixteenth
through the nineteenth centuries redundant
and lacking in the brilliance and scholarship
found in Sutherland Harrisand Nochlin. Still,
a fine analysis of aspects of the work of the
French eighteenth century painter, Elisabeth
Vigee-Lebrun, illuminates the crux of Parker
and Pollock's argument and is worth a brief
description here.
Vigee-Lebrun's undated self-portrait,
showing a Rubens'-inspired pose and
chapeau, conveys above all a coquetish, sen
sual artist who captivated royal society on
the eve of the revolution. "She offers herself
as a beautiful object to be looked at, enjoyed
and admired, but conveys nothing of the ac
tivity, the work, the mindfulness of the art
she purports to pursue," Parker and Pollock
write. The authors establish the notion that
only beautiful women artists could succeed
in eighteenth century society; Vigee-Lebrun
heightened the "feminine stereotype" in
her self-portrait. Her commissioned portrait
of a fashionable painter,' .jbert Robert, an
ticipated future Romantic versions of the vi
sionary, unkept Artist with grubby nails and
messy hair. Robert is portrayed as being pre
occupied by his own thoughts and heedless
of the viewer. Here, then, are two stere-

otypes: one the woman and the other the ar
tist, each painted by a woman artist.
The least convincing part of this book, a
chapter entitled "Painted Ladies," treats the
transformation of women's concepts of their
bodies. The somewhat hackneyed theme of
the female nude in the history of art has been
definitively treated by the feminist art critic,
John Berger, in Ways of Seeing. I found the
authors off the mark in their treatment of
Paula Modersohn-Becker, one of the single
most important painters in modern art.
Modersohn-Becker's is the first nude self
portrait of a woman in the history of art.

What an act of courage given the "feminine
stereotype" thesis. What middle class wom
an of early twentieth century Germany
would have had the intellectual independ
ence to portray herself nude?
Instead of being seductive as are previous
male portrayals of female nudes and many
female self-portraits as well, Paula's portrait
shows herself the first socially and artistically
liberated woman among us. Not only that, as
one feminist critic Carol Duncan points out.
"Rare is the image of a naked woman whose
head so outweighs her body."
The most stimulating part of the book,
aside from its original premise that art history
is a male construct designed to keep women
forever locked into a "feminine" stereotype
which shifts and changes according to the
particular cultural milieu, is the chapter on
twentieth century art. The authors glossed
over a great deal of interesting material re
cently published on the work and writings of
lovers and wives of artists who were them
selves accomplished artists and the equal of
their partners: I am thinking here of
Gabriele Munther, Sophie Tauber-Arp and
Sonia Delaunay. A monument of feminist
publication awaits the scholar able to tackle
the work of these accomplished artists of our
century who chose to live in the shadows of
their men.
Parker and Pollock tantalize the reader
with a presentation of the feminist possi
bilities of Surrealism in their "cult of the
feminine as opposed to the celebration of
machismo sexuality in art, the notion of artist
as medium rather than domineering, order
ing force, the search for hidden, mysterious
meanings by a variety of techniques all
opened the way for women's participation in
the movement."
They also illuminate the exemplary role
played by Eva Hesse, the sculptor whose trag
ic death in 1970 at the age of 34 terminated a
life whose accomplishments seemed to have
transcended the male/female syndrome de
scribed throughout the book.
As Hesse once remarked, "The way to beat
discrimination in art is by art. Excellence has
no sex." Her Hang Up shows us an emty
frame, obsessively bandaged and carefully
painted. "What is significant," write the au
thors, "is that Hesse refused to put woman or
even herself on view."
Hang Up created in 1966, is a unique
sculptural response to the implication of Ab
stract Expressionism and Color Field painting
of her predecessors. Yet, despite Hesse's
critical acclaim, it is virtually impossible to
see examples of her work in public museums
and galleries.
The single exceptions mind is at the UC-
Berkeley Art Museum where an entire wall is
given to a very late piece comprised of shim
mering sheets of gauze impregnated with
latex.
Depressing as it is, Old Mislresses helps to

Old Mistresses: Women, Art and Ideol
ogy
by Rozsika Parker and Criselda Pollock
New York: Pantheon, 183 pp., $10.95
The evidence is in. Exceptionally fine
women artists have painted, sculpted, ex
hibited and sold their art for the past five
centuries and more. But why is it that we
have not seen their work before; how is it
that their names are still deleted from the
standard texts on the history of art; where
can one go to see the permanent installation
of the work of women artists?
Old Mistresses: Women, Art and Ideology
attempts to answer such questions. It is the
best new publication to appear since the
feverish mid '70s. Rozsika Parker and
Griselda Pollock examine sexism in art his
tory as a largely unconscious reproduction
of the ideologies of patriarchal society. The
establishment of periodically changing as
sumptions about art and the artist and the
historical standards for the evaluation and
hierarchy of what constitutes works of art
have been the prerogatives of men. Men
have invented, as Parker and Pollock would
have us understand, a maleable "feminine
stereotype" for the past 500 years and more:
"Women and all their activities are charac
terized as the antithesis of cultural creativity,
making the notion of a woman artist a con
tradiction in terms," the authors write.
Readers familiar with Simone de Beau
voir's The Second Sex will recognize this
theme. The authors provide recent art

If, as the authors advocate,
women establish their own
institutions for exhibition
and promotion of their
work, will this work
continue to be perceived
mainly as political rather
than visual art and ignored
accordingly?

criticism to document their point that our
culture still sanctions only named individuals
and certain forms of art over all other ex
pressions of creativity. They quote Ralph
Pomeroy from his book Art and Artists:
"I am going to forget, in order to really see
them, that a group of Navajo blankets are not
only that. In order to consider them, as I feel
they ought to be considered — as Art with a
capital 'A' — I am going to look at them as
paintings — created with dye instead of can
vas —by several nameless masters... of ab
stract art." (italics by the authors)

Parker and Pollock see the 70s histories of
women artists as modestly aimed at annexing
individual women artists to the mainstream
of the established field where standards fcr
admittance are prescribed by male his
torians. As Anne Sutherland Harris writes:
"Slowly these artists must be integrated into
their art historical context. For too long they
have either been omitted altogether or
isolated and discussed only as women, not
simply as artists as if in some strange way they
were not part of their culture at all."
On the other hand, the authors argue for a
feminist deconstruction of the present struc
ture of the history of art in order to study the
specific ways that women have "made art
under different constraints at different peri
ods, affected as much by factors of class as by
their sex."
Histories of women artists published in the
70s, discovering "our hidden heritage" in
the dusty storage basements of museums
and attics of the world, posited a slow but
steady progress in women's art and status.
Conversely, Parker and Pollock view women
artists as having had a fugitive history at besp

admission to the"club" by an acceptable

twentieth century art. The authors glossed
over a great deal of interesting material re
cently published on the work and writings of
lovers and wives of artists who were them
selves accomplished artists and the equal of
their partners: I am thinking here of
Gabriele Munther, Sophie Tauber-Arp and
Sonia Delaunay. A monument of feminist
publication awaits the scholar able to tackle
the work of these accomplished artists of our
century who chose to live in the shadows of
their men.
Parker and Pollock tantalize the reader
with a presentation of the feminist possi
bilities of Surrealism in their "cult of the
feminine as opposed to the celebration of
machismo sexuality in art, the notion of artist
as medium rather than domineering, order
ing force, the search for hidden, mysterious
meanings by a variety of techniques all
opened the way for women's participation in
the movement."
They also illuminate the exemplary role
played by Eva Hesse, the sculptor whose trag
ic death in 1970 at the age of 34 terminated a
life whose accomplishments seemed to have
transcended the male/female syndrome de
scribed throughout the book.
As Hesse once remarked, "The way to beat
discrimination in art is by art. Excellence has
no sex." Her Hang Up shows us an emty
frame, obsessively bandaged and carefully
painted. "What is significant," write the au
thors, "is that Hesse refused to put woman or
even herself on view."
Hang Up created in 1966, is a unique
sculptural response to the implication of Ab
stract Expressionism and Color Field painting
of her predecessors. Yet, despite Hesse's
critical acclaim, it is virtually impossible to
see examples of her work in public museums
and galleries.
The single exceptions mind is at the UC-
Berkeley Art Museum where an entire wall is
given to a very late piece comprised of shim
mering sheets of gauze impregnated with
latex.

Eva Hesse's Hang Up, 1966
Old Mistresses: Women, Art and Ideol
ogy
by Rozsika Parker and Criselda Pollock
New York: Pantheon, 183 pp., $10.95
The evidence is in. Exceptionally fine
women artists have painted, sculpted, ex
hibited and sold their art for the past five
centuries and more. But why is it that we
have not seen their work before; how is it
that their names are still deleted from the
standard texts on the history of art; where
can one go to see the permanent installation
of the work of women artists?
Old Mistresses: Women, Art and Ideology
attempts to answer such questions. It is the
best new publication to appear since the
feverish mid '70s. Rozsika Parker and
Griselda Pollock examine sexism in art his
tory as a largely unconscious reproduction
of the ideologies of patriarchal society. The
establishment of periodically changing as
sumptions about art and the artist and the
historical standards for the evaluation and
hierarchy of what constitutes works of art
have been the prerogatives of men. Men
have invented, as Parker and Pollock would
have us understand, a maleable "feminine
stereotype" for the past 500 years and more:
"Women and all their activities are charac
terized as the antithesis of cultural creativity,
making the notion of a woman artist a con
tradiction in terms," the authors write.
Readers familiar with Simone de Beau
voir's The Second Sex will recognize this
theme. The authors provide recent art

If, as the authors advocate,
women establish their own
institutions for exhibition
and promotion of their
work, will this work
continue to be perceived
mainly as political rather
than visual art and ignored
accordingly?

criticism to document their point that our
culture still sanctions only named individuals
and certain forms of art over all other ex
pressions of creativity. They quote Ralph
Pomeroy from his book Art and Artists:
"I am going to forget, in order to really see
them, that a group of Navajo blankets are not
only that. In order to consider them, as I feel
they ought to be considered — as Art with a
capital 'A' — I am going to look at them as
paintings — created with dye instead of can
vas —by several nameless masters... of ab
stract art." (italics by the authors)

Parker and Pollock see the 70s histories of
women artists as modestly aimed at annexing
individual women artists to the mainstream
of the established field where standards fcr
admittance are prescribed by male his
torians. As Anne Sutherland Harris writes:
"Slowly these artists must be integrated into
their art historical context. For too long they
have either been omitted altogether or
isolated and discussed only as women, not
simply as artists as if in some strange way they
were not part of their culture at all."
On the other hand, the authors argue for a
feminist deconstruction of the present struc
ture of the history of art in order to study the
specific ways that women have "made art
under different constraints at different peri
ods, affected as much by factors of class as by
their sex."
Histories of women artists published in the
70s, discovering "our hidden heritage" in
the dusty storage basements of museums
and attics of the world, posited a slow but
steady progress in women's art and status.
Conversely, Parker and Pollock view women
artists as having had a fugitive history at besp
at all times they have had to calibrate their
admission to the"club" by an acceptable
"natural femininity" determined by suc
cessive male cultural arbiters who both
created the stereotype and defined ad
missible standards for all women.
What characterizes Old Mistresses and
makes its contribution to the literature dis
tinctive, if flawed, is the attempt to establish
a "framework for the understanding of the
significance of sexual differences in our cul
ture."
I found much of the treatment of the art of
women painters, sculptors, collagists, em

broiderers and quilters of the sixteenth
through the nineteenth centuries redundant
and lacking in the brilliance and scholarship
found in Sutherland Harrisand Nochlin. Still,
a fine analysis of aspects of the work of the
French eighteenth century painter, Elisabeth
Vigee-Lebrun, illuminates the crux of Parker
and Pollock's argument and is worth a brief
description here.
Vigee-Lebrun's undated self-portrait,
showing a Rubens'-inspired pose and
chapeau, conveys above all a coquetish, sen
sual artist who captivated royal society on
the eve of the revolution. "She offers herself
as a beautiful object to be looked at, enjoyed
and admired, but conveys nothing of the ac
tivity, the work, the mindfulness of the art
she purports to pursue," Parker and Pollock
write. The authors establish the notion that
only beautiful women artists could succeed
in eighteenth century society; Vigee-Lebrun
heightened the "feminine stereotype" in
her self-portrait. Her commissioned portrait
of a fashionable painter,' .jbert Robert, an
ticipated future Romantic versions of the vi
sionary, unkept Artist with grubby nails and
messy hair. Robert is portrayed as being pre
occupied by his own thoughts and heedless
of the viewer. Here, then, are two stere-

otypes: one the woman and the other the ar
tist, each painted by a woman artist.
The least convincing part of this book, a
chapter entitled "Painted Ladies," treats the
transformation of women's concepts of their
bodies. The somewhat hackneyed theme of
the female nude in the history of art has been
definitively treated by the feminist art critic,
John Berger, in Ways of Seeing. I found the
authors off the mark in their treatment of
Paula Modersohn-Becker, one of the single
most important painters in modern art.
Modersohn-Becker's is the first nude self
portrait of a woman in the history of art.

What an act of courage given the "feminine
stereotype" thesis. What middle class wom
an of early twentieth century Germany
would have had the intellectual independ
ence to portray herself nude?
Instead of being seductive as are previous
male portrayals of female nudes and many
female self-portraits as well, Paula's portrait
shows herself the first socially and artistically
liberated woman among us. Not only that, as
one feminist critic Carol Duncan points out.
"Rare is the image of a naked woman whose
head so outweighs her body."
The most stimulating part of the book,
aside from its original premise that art history
is a male construct designed to keep women
forever locked into a "feminine" stereotype
which shifts and changes according to the
particular cultural milieu, is the chapter on
twentieth century art. The authors glossed
over a great deal of interesting material re
cently published on the work and writings of
lovers and wives of artists who were them
selves accomplished artists and the equal of
their partners: I am thinking here of
Gabriele Munther, Sophie Tauber-Arp and
