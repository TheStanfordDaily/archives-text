# Anti-nuke referendum placed on ballot
## 
### Tim Lundergan 
For months, organizations opposed to nuclear
weapons have worked in and around the Univer
sity to increase anti-nuclear sentiment. Next week,
the ASSU fee assessment ballot will measure the
extent of that support.
The Stanford Progressive Alliance (SPA) has suc
ceeded in placing a referendum initiative on the
April 28-29 th ballot calling for "an immediate halt
to the testing, production, and further deploy
ment of all nuclear warheads, missiles, and de
livery systems" by both the United States and the
Soviet Union.
The wording of this initiative is almost identical
to that of the measure placed on the California
ballot by the Bilateral Nuclear Arms Freeze cam
paign.
SPA member Larry Ausubel said the group de
cided to place the referendum on the baHot here
because "people will take notice if students at a
world-class university like Stanford" endorse the
freeze. Ausubel said that when the editors of seven
Ivy League schools last month called for an end to
United States involvement in El Salvador, it re
ceived coverage in major publiations such as the
New York Times. "I'm sure it was read in Washing
ton," Ausubel said.
"We believe that sentiment among Stanford stu
dents is overwhelmingly in favor of a freeze and
against the current arms buildup," Ausubel said.
"The referendum will immediately translate that
sentiment into something concrete and quan
titative." The SPA needed 575 signatures to place
their petition on the ASSU ballot, Ausubel said,
and they collected more than 750 in three days.
The SPA also hopes the referendum will spark
discussions in living groups and departments, Aus
ubel said. Such discussions would not be the first to
occur in the area this week.
On Monday, a standing room only crowd of nu
clear weapons opponents persuaded the Palo Alto
Citv Council to change its mind and endorse a

when the ozone barrier deteriorates,
he said. Brower elaborated on
Schell's list, citing increased acid rain,
carbon dioxide overload inducing a
greenhouse effect, and ultimately,
the annhilation of the entire human
species.
Brower spoke of a passage from
Shell's book which he said was an ex
ample of our readiness to accept
these results. A year-and-a-half ago,
the Pentagon mistakenly thought
that the Soviet Union had launched a
nuclear attack on the United States,
and readied itself to retaliate. The So
viet Union, detecting American ac
tions, prepared to defend itself. Six
minutes before the American attack

was to begin, someone discovered
the error.
"The world would have lasted for
24 minutes beyond those six if we
hadn't caught our mistake," Brower
said.
Shell's book claimed that "if we
continue to live by the law of fear
there won't be anyone or anything
after us to remember we were even
here, and to remember our ac
complishments." However, he said
"we should substitute the law of love
for that of fear."
"If we put our bodies where our
words are by going to demonstra
tions, then we are showing that we

bilateral nuclear weapons freeze iniiiative. Before
the meeting, a majority of the council had said they
did not regard nuclear weapons policy as a local is
sue.
The crowd, including a number of Stanford stu
dents and faculty members, waited through more
than two hours of other business and then dis
cussed the matter for several more hours in a pub
lic hearing. The council finally voted six to two in
favor of the freeze.
The organizers of Ground Zero Week, a na
tionwide series of discussions and events relating
to nuclear weapons and the threat of nuclear war,
hope such examples of citizen interest in halting
thearms race spread across the country.
Ground Zero was founded by Dr. Roger
Molander, who served as a member of the Na
tional Security Council under Presidents Richard
Nixon, Gerald Ford and Jimmy Carter. The group
has organized demonstrations, marches, dis
cussions and speeches at the Boston Marathon; in
Louisville, Ky.; Houston, Tex.; and Cleveland,
Ohio.
Most of the week's activities were initiated by lo
cal groups which cooperated with each other un
der Ground Zero's umbrella. "They tapped into
existing groups,"said SLAC engineer John Harris.
The Peninsula has been a particularly active area
during Ground Zero week. Harris helped organize
Saturday's Run For Life, a jog from Hoover Tower
to Palo Alto City Hall. The run and the speeches
which followed it were credited by some observers
with spurring the large turnout at Monday's city
council meeting.
Other Ground Zero activities include the
speeches and discussions of Weapons Crisis Week,
sponsored by Stanford Arms Control And Dis
armament Forum, films shown at the New Varsity
Theater here, as well as at San Jose State and Santa
Clara College. About 60 people attended a "book
party" at Printer's, Inc. bookstore in Palo Alto last
night which featured a number of anti-nuclear

books.
Ground Zero's purpose is educational and the
organization does not officially advocate any one
solution to the nuclear arms race, according to
Scott Elrod, a graduate applied physics student
here and one of the main coordinators of the
week's events on the mid-peninsula.
However, the same concern which drives the in
formational campaign is propelling the bilateral
nuclear freeze campaign in California. A recent
Mervin Field Poll indicated that California voters
approve the freeze initiative by a two-to-one
margin.
Sponsors of the freeze hope it will place political
pressure on the Reagan administration to stop its
proposed increase in the country's stockpile of nu
clear weapons. More than 700,000 people signed
that petition.
Although turnout at Ground Zero events has
varied widely and in some cases disappointed or
ganizers, Ausubel said he believes support for the
nuclear freeze measure is strong on the campus.
He cited the crowd which overflowed Memorial
Auditorium to hear economist John Kenneth
Galbraith criticize the nuclear arms build-up.
Harris said he hopes that after Ground Zero
Week ends, discussions will turn from the conse
quences of nuclear war to examinations of the ide
ology behind the arms race. "It's not the weapons
themselves, but the ideology behind them that is
the problem," he said. "When the secretary of
state spends all his time talking about military
things, something's wrong."
Harris criticized some of the groups involved in
Ground Zero Week for concentrating only on
educating the public about the consequences of
nuclear war rather than taking a political stand on
the issue. Several groups involved in Ground Zero,
such as Physicians for Social Responsibility, are
non-profit organizations which would lose their
tax-exempt status if they advocated a partisan
cause.

quences of nuclear war to examinations of the ide
ology behind the arms race. "It's not the weapons
themselves, but the ideology behind them that is
the problem," he said. "When the secretary of
state spends all his time talking about military
things, something's wrong."
Harris criticized some of the groups involved in
Ground Zero Week for concentrating only on
educating the public about the consequences of
nuclear war rather than taking a political stand on
the issue. Several groups involved in Ground Zero,
such as Physicians for Social Responsibility, are
non-profit organizations which would lose their
tax-exempt status if they advocated a partisan
cause.

For months, organizations opposed to nuclear
weapons have worked in and around the Univer
sity to increase anti-nuclear sentiment. Next week,
the ASSU fee assessment ballot will measure the
extent of that support.
The Stanford Progressive Alliance (SPA) has suc
ceeded in placing a referendum initiative on the
April 28-29 th ballot calling for "an immediate halt
to the testing, production, and further deploy
ment of all nuclear warheads, missiles, and de
livery systems" by both the United States and the
Soviet Union.
The wording of this initiative is almost identical
to that of the measure placed on the California
ballot by the Bilateral Nuclear Arms Freeze cam
paign.
SPA member Larry Ausubel said the group de
cided to place the referendum on the baHot here
because "people will take notice if students at a
world-class university like Stanford" endorse the
freeze. Ausubel said that when the editors of seven
Ivy League schools last month called for an end to
United States involvement in El Salvador, it re
ceived coverage in major publiations such as the
New York Times. "I'm sure it was read in Washing
ton," Ausubel said.
"We believe that sentiment among Stanford stu
dents is overwhelmingly in favor of a freeze and
against the current arms buildup," Ausubel said.
"The referendum will immediately translate that
sentiment into something concrete and quan
titative." The SPA needed 575 signatures to place
their petition on the ASSU ballot, Ausubel said,
and they collected more than 750 in three days.
The SPA also hopes the referendum will spark
discussions in living groups and departments, Aus
ubel said. Such discussions would not be the first to
occur in the area this week.
On Monday, a standing room only crowd of nu
clear weapons opponents persuaded the Palo Alto
Citv Council to change its mind and endorse a

when the ozone barrier deteriorates,
he said. Brower elaborated on
Schell's list, citing increased acid rain,
carbon dioxide overload inducing a
greenhouse effect, and ultimately,
the annhilation of the entire human
species.
Brower spoke of a passage from
Shell's book which he said was an ex
ample of our readiness to accept
these results. A year-and-a-half ago,
the Pentagon mistakenly thought
that the Soviet Union had launched a
nuclear attack on the United States,
and readied itself to retaliate. The So
viet Union, detecting American ac
tions, prepared to defend itself. Six
minutes before the American attack

was to begin, someone discovered
the error.
"The world would have lasted for
24 minutes beyond those six if we
hadn't caught our mistake," Brower
said.
Shell's book claimed that "if we
continue to live by the law of fear
there won't be anyone or anything
after us to remember we were even
here, and to remember our ac
complishments." However, he said
"we should substitute the law of love
for that of fear."
"If we put our bodies where our
words are by going to demonstra
tions, then we are showing that we

bilateral nuclear weapons freeze iniiiative. Before
the meeting, a majority of the council had said they
did not regard nuclear weapons policy as a local is
sue.
The crowd, including a number of Stanford stu
dents and faculty members, waited through more
than two hours of other business and then dis
cussed the matter for several more hours in a pub
lic hearing. The council finally voted six to two in
favor of the freeze.
The organizers of Ground Zero Week, a na
tionwide series of discussions and events relating
to nuclear weapons and the threat of nuclear war,
hope such examples of citizen interest in halting
thearms race spread across the country.
Ground Zero was founded by Dr. Roger
Molander, who served as a member of the Na
tional Security Council under Presidents Richard
Nixon, Gerald Ford and Jimmy Carter. The group
has organized demonstrations, marches, dis
cussions and speeches at the Boston Marathon; in
Louisville, Ky.; Houston, Tex.; and Cleveland,
Ohio.
Most of the week's activities were initiated by lo
cal groups which cooperated with each other un
der Ground Zero's umbrella. "They tapped into
existing groups,"said SLAC engineer John Harris.
The Peninsula has been a particularly active area
during Ground Zero week. Harris helped organize
Saturday's Run For Life, a jog from Hoover Tower
to Palo Alto City Hall. The run and the speeches
which followed it were credited by some observers
with spurring the large turnout at Monday's city
council meeting.
Other Ground Zero activities include the
speeches and discussions of Weapons Crisis Week,
sponsored by Stanford Arms Control And Dis
armament Forum, films shown at the New Varsity
Theater here, as well as at San Jose State and Santa
Clara College. About 60 people attended a "book
party" at Printer's, Inc. bookstore in Palo Alto last
night which featured a number of anti-nuclear

books.
Ground Zero's purpose is educational and the
organization does not officially advocate any one
solution to the nuclear arms race, according to
Scott Elrod, a graduate applied physics student
here and one of the main coordinators of the
week's events on the mid-peninsula.
However, the same concern which drives the in
formational campaign is propelling the bilateral
nuclear freeze campaign in California. A recent
Mervin Field Poll indicated that California voters
approve the freeze initiative by a two-to-one
margin.
Sponsors of the freeze hope it will place political
pressure on the Reagan administration to stop its
proposed increase in the country's stockpile of nu
clear weapons. More than 700,000 people signed
that petition.
Although turnout at Ground Zero events has
varied widely and in some cases disappointed or
ganizers, Ausubel said he believes support for the
nuclear freeze measure is strong on the campus.
He cited the crowd which overflowed Memorial
Auditorium to hear economist John Kenneth
Galbraith criticize the nuclear arms build-up.
Harris said he hopes that after Ground Zero
Week ends, discussions will turn from the conse
quences of nuclear war to examinations of the ide
ology behind the arms race. "It's not the weapons
themselves, but the ideology behind them that is
the problem," he said. "When the secretary of
