# Hufstedler addresses DOE budget reduction

President Ronald Reagan's budget
priorities "have placed educated
Americans on the endangered spec
ies list," Shirley Hufstedler, Herman
Phleger Visiting Law Professor and
former secretary of education, told
about 200 people in Kresge
Auditorium yesterday afternoon.
Hufstedler, who began her speech
by portraying the "bucolic" Univer
sity campus and concluded with a
gloomy forecast for its situation fol
lowing cuts in education by the Rea
gan administration, decried pro
posed spending hikes for the Depart
ment of Defense at the expense of
the Department of Education.
The Reagan budget calls for a $1.6
trillion outlay over the next three
years for defense while maintaining
the 1980 Department of Education
budget of $14.2 billion, she said.
Hufstedler, a Stanford Law School
graduate, managed that budget after
becoming the first secretary of
education when then President Jim
my Carter created the post in 1979.
If education sustains budget cuts,
"will more money for defense im
prove national security if we lose the
strength of the people in our socie
ty?" she asked the audience.
Hufstedler introduced a raft of fig
ures attesting to the strength of the

present educational system, which,
she said, is the "most diverse, plural
istic, and egalitarian in the world."
In 1940, according to Hufstedler,
only 25 percent of the people in the
United States completed high
school. That figure has grown to 67
percent today.
Almost one-half of those who have
high school diplomas go on to a col
lege or university, she said.
Hufstedler, however, pointed to
the decreasing elementary school
population and lack of public aware
ness' about education problems as
precursors to a large decline in the
American education system.
Public ignorance, Hufstedler said,
is largely responsible by anti-tax
measures such as California's Propo
sition 13, which substantially reduced
revenues for public schools.
Hufstedler said that an adminstra
tion which calls for cuts in education
is only compounding these prob
lems.
She said that proposed Reagan ad
ministration reduction in education
will cut in half federal aid to college
and university students and will se
verely reduce Department of Educa
tion outlays to elementary-school
aged minority and disadvantaged
students.
