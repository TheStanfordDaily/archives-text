# BSU's petition falters
## 
### Bill Ainsworth 
A petition circulated by the Black
Students Union (BSU) calling for the
annulment of the ASSU Senate's re
cent approval of the election results
will not be on the April 28-29 ballot
because it failed to gather enough
signatures by yesterday's deadline.
The petition charged that there were
"documented irregularities" in last
week's election.
Council of Presidents (COP) mem
ber Chris Greene said that the peti
tion fell short of obtaining the signa
tures of 5 percent of the student body
or 568 students that a referendum
would need to qualify for the ballot.
In a preliminary count where Greene
said he did not match signatures with
student identification numbers as in
a final count, there were only 446 sig
natures on the petition.
According to Greene, even if the
petitions had the required numberof
signatures they would not have been

accepted because the format in
which they were written was not ap
propriate. He said the petition failed
to state at the top that it would be a
referendum and it failed to include
exactly what would be in the peti
tion.
The petition included a list of elec
tion procedural errors similar to
those cited in earlier election pro
tests made by the unsuccessful COP
slate of Robin Cooper, Eloisa Carrillo,
Michael Lighty and Doris Wilson and
supported by current COP rmember
Fred Buhl.
Among the charges listed were the
mishandling of ballots, lack of signa
ture control and the improper sched
uling of polling place hours.
However, Greene said that the
procedural errors "did not come into
play" because of the insufficient
number of signatures on the peti
tions.
