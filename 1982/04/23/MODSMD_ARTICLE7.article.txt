# Money is central issue in college sports panel
## 
### Mike Thurman Senior staff writer 
Dr. Harry Edwards, noted sports
sociologist at UC-Berkeley, blamed
society and "superpower" college
sports programs for encouraging the
"systematic exploitation of athletics"
and said that revenue-producing col
lege athletes should be paid for their
endeavors.
Edwards spoke as a panel member
on college athletics along with head
football coach Paul Wiggin, track
coach Brooks Johnson, special assis
tant football coach jimmy Johnston,
varsity football team member Darrin
Nelson and Leonard Koppett, a
sports columnist for the Peninsula
Times Tribune, last night in Rin
conada lounge.
"Big-time collegiate sports are
moving in that direction anyway,"
Edwards said of the prospect of paid
college athletes. He predicted that
collegiate football and basketball of
ficials would move to institute a semi
professional system "by the end of
this decade."
Edwards listed millions of dollars
worth of television and bowl reven
ues that are available to athletic pro
grams, "made by 22 amateur athletes
in one afternoon," saying that there
is a clear cause behind the advent of
major sports scandals recently dis
covered among college football and
basketball programs.
"M-o-n-e-y," he said.
Directing his comments to admin
istrators of "superpower" football
and basketball programs, Edwards
said, "If they have not obliterated the
ideals of collegiate sports, they have
at least relegated them to a role of
secondary importance."
Although nearly all of the players
in the National Football League and
the National Basketball Association
attended college, Edwards said that

75-85 percent have not graduated.
He said that universities should es
tablish trust funds paid for by tele
vision receipts and donations from
the professional sports leagues to
provide unlimited post-sport
eligibility for athletes to complete
their undergraduate education after
leaving sports.
Several panelists said that the be
lief in sports as a source of personal
and financial success has led to frus
tration and shattered dreams for
many Americans (less than 2 percent
of college athletes ever sign pro
fessional contracts, Edwards said).
"The message is clear to young
black athletes that if you want respect
and recognition, become a pro
fessional athlete," Edwards said.
Edwards proposed the develop
ment of mandatory sports orien
tation programs to educate entering
students on the realities of pro
fessional sports. He also said officials
should end the practice of sched
uling preseason football games
before classes start because it en
courages student-athletes to view
their sport, as opposed to their stud
ies, as their primary purpose at
school.
Johnson said he refused to blame
the institutions of college athletics
"for athletes not taking advantage of
the opportunities made available to
them. He also argued with the em
phasis Edwards placed on the gradu
ation figures for college athletes,
saying that even an athlete who fails
academically is bound to learn from
the experience of attending college.
"You can learn equally well from
positive and negative experiences,"
he said. "For ine, what's i ritii ,il is en
