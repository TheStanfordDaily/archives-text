## Breaking the moldâ€”combining school, work and family

Women striving to reconcile the demands
of graduate work and parenthood deserve
support from academic institutions and from
each other, said three professors Wednesday
afternoon during a panel discussion in Tres
idder Lounge.
Halsted Holman, Guggenheim Professor
of Medicine/Immunology, Assoc. History
Prof. Carolyn Lougee, and Assoc. German
Prof. Rob Robinson led a discussion entitled
"Men vs. Women: Reconciling the Personal
and the Professional."
Approximately 70 women and four men
attended the panel discussion which ex
amined the demands that are placed on men
and women doing graduate work while rais
ing families. Throughout the two-hour dis

cussion speakers and students voiced the
need for more sensitive attitudes from pro
fessors and supportive structures to over
come the conflicts women and men face.
Sponsored by the Committee on the Sta
tus of Graduate Women at Stanford, the dis
cussion was an outgrowth of a questionnaire
given to graduate women last January ad
dressing both their academic and social con
cerns. Patricia Brandt, assistant dean of stu
dent affairs, judging from more than 200
responses, said that the dilemma of attempt
ing both a career and motherhood "is and
remains a woman's problem."
Holman emphasized that in medical
school the "competitive element makes for
an entire work-first and family-second"
mentality. He also noted that academic soci
ety "has not removed the notion that the
way to succeed is through an intense com
mitment of time," which creates a tremen
dous conflict for a woman aiming for the top
of her field.
Lougee called for institutions to recognize
that "the years graduate schools give for
study, biology gives for reproduction," and
that they should understand "the costs a
woman pays when she decides to have
both."
She related an anecdote about an advisor
who tells students to "see yourselves as pro
fessionals, not as women." Not supporting
the search for an androgynous society,
Lougee said she believes it is wrong for wom
en to feel they must accept the male work
model of long hours for work and little time
for personal matters.
A single mother-student in the audience

said that she felt "the University does noth
ing to make a woman like me feel good
about wanting to be committed to work,"
and that "I'm here to say I resent it." She said
"each day, in a thousand little ways," gradu
ate women must make trade-offs between
their work and their children, while men
may commit all of their time to their work.
Lougee urged graduate women to seek a
support group, to talk about the conflicts

that they suffer, and to keep their outside life
integral to their person. She described the
cycles women face as varying demands are
required of them at different stages in their
lives. "The only way to juggle all the balls you
are trying to juggle is to decrease the intensi
ty of some if you have to increase others at
other times," she said.

Robinson spoke of "reasonable reactions"
but said he's not sure the "University or the
world is reasonable." He said that the Uni
versity "can't admit a lot of women graduate
students and then not recognize their
biologies and all that they imply."
Lougee described herself during graduate
school as a "well-oiled machine, working
while the kids were asleep, taking only 30
seconds to get from the kitchen to the desk."
A female computer science graduate stu
dent challenged Lougee's world as being
"too idealistic," saying that there isn't
enough time to go around, and women have
the burden of making a choice between the
two lifestyles. She suggested that "maybe
people at the top should be only people who
are 100 percent committed."
A male computer science grad shared an
other tale of an advisor who said the only
way to become a first-rate computer scientist
was to "do nothing but work for the next five
years, maybe 10." Doubting well-rounded
personalities in his "hottest" professors and
seeking family-oriented rewards, the ?rad
said his goal is now "to be the best second
rate computer scientist."
In response to this reasoning, Hoisted
urged the end of the total "adulation of
workaholics" which makes students who
have less time available to commit to study
ing, in this case mothers, feel inadequate and
discouraged.
Robinson offered the approach of merely
slowing down the work process. He said that
it is "a dangerous assumption to say you can't
be first-rate unless you go fast."
