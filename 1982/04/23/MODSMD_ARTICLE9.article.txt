# Secondhand shopping
## search of hidden treasures 
### Nathan Selden 
7 Five Stanford students
jiled into the Goodwill out
et shoving and joking, and
nade their way into a maze
)f used furniture, old
■lothes, kitchen appliances
md junk.
"When they have gigs to
to," said Joanna
amieson, 21, who works
ive days a week in the store,
'(the students) come in for
iinky clothes."
Today, they were suiting
JP for a Roman "toga party"
and needed old sheets for
togas, neckties for belts and
funny hats.
The four young men and
one woman, from a
freshman dorm known for
its parties, picked their way
through a long rack of
sheets and drapes at the
back of the showroom.
To their right, two elderly
ladies quietly searched rows
of used dresses, blouses,
coats and slacks for some
thing that suited their tastes.
"We get all kinds of peo
ple in here," said Jamieson.
"You know what kind of
world it is."
She stood behind the cash
register near the door, sur
rounded by racks of plastic
jewelry and knick-knacks,
and smiled contentedly at
the growing activity in the
store.
"One day," she said,
"they came in and dressed
up. They wanted to be
nerds. They have their good
ideas; It keeps me going.
"I'd rather work here
than anywhere else in the
store because I can see them
come in all day long. You
can get to know ev

erybody," Jamieson said.
A stocky, middle-aged
lady walked up to the coun
ter, wearing a white sweater
and bright yellow polyester
pants. Her young son tod
dled behind. Jamieson rang
up their purchase of a few
pieces of clothing.
A couple of "regulars"
wandered slowly through
the aisles. They come in,
said Jamieson, for hours and
hours almost every day of
the week.

'We get all kinds
of people in here.
You know what
kind of world it
is/

She has poor and rich cus
tomers, customers from
down the street and as far
away as San Jose, students
who are dressing up and
students who are furnishing
their apartments.
"It' doesn't bother me
who shops here with the
prices so high outside," said
the store's manager, Dottie
Mediros as she sorted
clothes in the back room in
front of a blaring color tele
vision.
The adventurous
freshmen picked out sheets
— colored and white,
striped and solid, tacky and
drab — and walked up to
the stairs at the very back of
the store past a small, hand
lettered sign that read:

"Funky Clothes."
They tried on velvet hats
and long coats. One pulled
a bright purple dress off a
rack and modeled it in front
of a mirror. Laughter pealed
out through the hushed
floor below.
"Nobody minds," said
Jamieson. "Sometimes I go
up there and talk to them. It
seems like the antics from
Happy Days around here."
The other customers are
unaffected. An older wom
an, wearing a tweed skirt
and jacket and a fashionable
hat, continued to browse
through clothing racks filled
mostly with bright,
polyester castoffs.
The stocky lady in the
white sweater stood to the
side of the counter and
chatted with an elderty
woman about her husband.
Already wearing parts of
their costumes, the five stu
dents, with sheets draped
over shoulders and clip-on
ties dangling from T-shirt
collars, joined the queue at
the counter to pay for their
costumes.
"You have c lot of
parties," Jamieson re
marked. "That's neat,
though. It makes me laugh.
Why didn't I go to college?
It looks like a lot of fun."
The students piled back
into their car and pulled out
of the Goodwill parking lot
into the busy traffic on El
Camino Real. A couple of
them had been to Goodwill
before and most will return
again during their four years
here.

and needed old sheets for
togas, neckties for belts and
funny hats.
The four young men and
one woman, from a
freshman dorm known for
its parties, picked their way
through a long rack of
sheets and drapes at the
back of the showroom.
To their right, two elderly
ladies quietly searched rows
of used dresses, blouses,
coats and slacks for some
thing that suited their tastes.
"We get all kinds of peo
ple in here," said Jamieson.
"You know what kind of
world it is."
She stood behind the cash
register near the door, sur
rounded by racks of plastic
jewelry and knick-knacks,
and smiled contentedly at
the growing activity in the
store.
"One day," she said,
"they came in and dressed
up. They wanted to be
nerds. They have their good
ideas; It keeps me going.
"I'd rather work here
than anywhere else in the
store because I can see them
come in all day long. You
can get to know ev

erybody," Jamieson said.
A stocky, middle-aged
lady walked up to the coun
ter, wearing a white sweater
and bright yellow polyester
pants. Her young son tod
dled behind. Jamieson rang
up their purchase of a few
pieces of clothing.
A couple of "regulars"
wandered slowly through
the aisles. They come in,
said Jamieson, for hours and
hours almost every day of
the week.

'We get all kinds
of people in here.
You know what
kind of world it
is/

She has poor and rich cus
tomers, customers from
down the street and as far
away as San Jose, students
who are dressing up and
students who are furnishing
their apartments.
"It' doesn't bother me
who shops here with the
prices so high outside," said
the store's manager, Dottie
Mediros as she sorted
clothes in the back room in
front of a blaring color tele
vision.
The adventurous
freshmen picked out sheets
— colored and white,
striped and solid, tacky and
drab — and walked up to
the stairs at the very back of
the store past a small, hand
lettered sign that read:

"Funky Clothes."
They tried on velvet hats
and long coats. One pulled
a bright purple dress off a
rack and modeled it in front
of a mirror. Laughter pealed
out through the hushed
floor below.
"Nobody minds," said
Jamieson. "Sometimes I go
up there and talk to them. It
seems like the antics from
Happy Days around here."
The other customers are
unaffected. An older wom
an, wearing a tweed skirt
and jacket and a fashionable
hat, continued to browse
through clothing racks filled
mostly with bright,
polyester castoffs.
The stocky lady in the
white sweater stood to the
side of the counter and
chatted with an elderty
woman about her husband.
Already wearing parts of
their costumes, the five stu
dents, with sheets draped
over shoulders and clip-on
ties dangling from T-shirt
collars, joined the queue at
the counter to pay for their
costumes.
"You have c lot of
parties," Jamieson re
marked. "That's neat,
though. It makes me laugh.
Why didn't I go to college?
It looks like a lot of fun."
The students piled back
into their car and pulled out
of the Goodwill parking lot
into the busy traffic on El
Camino Real. A couple of
them had been to Goodwill
before and most will return
again during their four years
here.
