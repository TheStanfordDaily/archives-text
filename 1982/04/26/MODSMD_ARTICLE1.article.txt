# Partial ruling against ABC announced
## 20/20 'unfairly' linked PJF to spying 
### Joan O'Connell 
The National News Council
ruled Friday that Polish journalist
Marek Samotyj — currently a
Professional Journalism Fellow
here — was unfairly portrayed as
a Soviet spy during an interview
broadcast on the ABC 20/20
news program.
However, the council refused
to rule against the network on
two other charge's filed by Stan
ford Communication Prof. Lyle
Nelson ori behalf of Samotyj,
namely that ABC did not in
dicate the true nature of the in
terview that they intended to
conduct and that the show's pro
ducers edited the tape so that it
no longer accurately reflected
that interview.
Although Nelson said he was
pleased because "esentially they
found our main charge valid,"
one of Samotyj's colleagues, Pro
fessional Journalism Fellow (PJF)
Ed Beitiks, said he thought the
council had exhibited a "cavalier
attitude toward the damage
done to (Samotyj's) life," a feel
ing expressed by several PJFs.
Following the rulingon Friday,
ABC officials told the San Jose
Mercury News that they stand by
their story.
"We believe it to be fair and
accurate. The National News
Council is a fallible group that
has once again demonstrated its
ability to make a mistake," a
network spokesperson said.
The Council — an independ
ent, voluntary organization
composed of media and public
sector advisers — meets about
four times a year. The group had
decided to meet here well
before the "Nelson vs. ABC"
case was scheduled.
In reaching their decision, the
members of the 18-person coun

cil reviewed a tape of the seg
ment, "A Target for Spies" which
was aired on ABC March 4. Ex
cerpts from a 20-minute in
terview with Samotyj showed
the 34-year-old Fulbright scholar
being asked if he was a spy. His
image was frozen on (he screen
as the ABC reporter claimed that
foreign scholars learn informa
tion at American universities
which they take back to Eastern
bloc countries and put to use on
military projects. On film,
Samotyj denied that he was a
spy, but said he could not prove
it.
Samotyj, his wife Elizabeth and
their children are here until June
when he was to have returned to
Poland to his job as the editor of
a technical magazine. He is a
trained engineer and has
audited some engineering
classes here.
Since the airing of the ABC
show, Samotyj fears for his
future in Poland and doubts that
he can return to his position as
editor, or act as a teacher, ac
cording to several sources.
Samotyj has been cautioned not a
to talk to reporters, for fear ofn\

further jeopardizing his position
in Poland. Sources say he fears
for the well-being of some of the
members of his family who are in
Poland now.
Nelson, in his official com
plaint to the Council, claimed
that ABC took advantage of
Samotyj's "lack of sophistication
in the ways of American tele
vision and journalism 'on an en
tirely false and unprofessional
basis'."
According to Nelson, writing
on Samotyj's behalf, the in
terview was set up under the
pretense of a discussion about
scholarly transfer of information
and Samotyj was not warned that
he would be asked about spying.
Due to the current sensitive situ
aton in Poland, Samotyj would
likely never haveagreed to an in
terview involving spying, Nelson
argued in his complaint.
At least three other University
officials, Bechtel International
Center Director Lee Ziegler,
Mechanical Engineerng Prof.
Bernard Roth and Harry Press,
managing director of the PJF
k program, say they, too, were un-
the impression that the show

was about technology transfer,
according to Nelson.
ABC argued, however, that
the University had been notified
that the content of the show and
interview involved spying, via
University News and Publication
Director Bob Beyers.
Beyers told the Daily Friday
that the word "spy" had only
arisen once in the context of a
conversation between himself
and an ABC representative,
when one of them — he can't re
member which — joked that
"this sounds like another 'Spies
in the Valley'" piece, what
Beyers said has almost become a
"generic term" for stories about
technology transfer in this area.
The Tresidder room in which
the council met was crowded
throughout the discussion of the
Nelson vs. ABC case with about
60 observers in attendance.
Many Communication Dept.
faculty and students attended
the meeting, as did Nelson, and
Marek and Elizabeth Samotyj.
Visibly shaken by thenatureof
some of the Council's remarks
about him, Samotyj sat with
downcast eyes and left im
mediately after the ruling.
At one point council member
Franklin Williams, former am
bassador to Ghana, was arguing
against the legitimacy of the
complaint about the intent of
the interview and said, "He
(Samotyj) just didn't know what
he was doing.. .after the in
terview he signed a release. He's
a big boy."
Three council members dis
qualified themselves from the
debate: Stanford Communica
tion Prof. Elie Abel; Norman
Isaacs, the council's chairman
who is currently a visiting

professor in the department; and
William Scott, who is affiliated with
ABC
This left the council without ade
quate input from broadcast special
ists when council member Margo
Huston, an editorial writer from the
Milwaukee journal raised a question
about the- prevalence of the "splic
ing" technique in network news.
"I know that in print journalism, if
we omit what someone says, we use

dot-dot-dot. Is there a dot-dot-dot in
broadcast?" she asked.
Abel, from the sidelines, suggested
the panel consult Prof. Henry
Breitrose, chairman of the Com
munication Dept., who was in atten
dance.
"It is done. It is generally not
looked upon as good form,"
Breitrose said. Out of the council's
earshot, one professor said, "At any
reputable operation it would be
grounds for firing."
Nelson said Saturday that "how
network programs are edited in the
long run may even be a more impor

tant issue than this individual case. I
strongly object to the practice of
splicing two sentences together (out
of context.) It's a dangerous and very
bad thing."
A preliminary draft included the
statement that the Council
"deplored" the use of the splicing
technique — one of Nelson's com
plaints filed with the council — but
no reference was made to this in the
final ruling.
Several of Samotyj's colleagues in
the PJF program objected to what
Beitiks, a reporter and editor for the
Santa Maria Times, called the weak,
"wishy-washy" wording.

"It doesn't say much for the Na
tional News Council when faced with
incredibly sloppy journalism, to deny
that the pretenses used in the ;et-up
of the interview were un
professional," Beitiks said. 'If they
don't have the evidence in front of
them in this case, they don't have the
evidence in any case."
PJF Lydia Wasowicz agreed: "I wish
the wording were stronger."
Wasowicz, a reporter for UPI, said
she had watched the program with
outrage at the extent to which
Samotyj's statements had been taken
out of context, adding that she was

particularly concerned about
Samotyj and his family's future in Po
land. Wasowicz as a child had immi
grated to the United States from Po
land.
A major factor in the debate was a
release which Samotyj signed after
the interview, which allowed ABC to
use any or all of his statements in
their broadcast. Samotyj's testimony
said that he signed the release be
cause the questions asked of him dur
ing the interview had seemed so out
of line with what he said he had un
derstood was the stated purpose of
the interview, that he thought his
comments would never be used.

PJF Lydia Wasowicz agreed: "I wish

Wasowicz, a reporter for UPI, said
she had watched the program with
outrage at the extent to which
Samotyj's statements had been taken
out of context, adding that she was

particularly concerned about
Samotyj and his family's future in Po

land.
A major factor in the debate was a
release which Samotyj signed after
the interview, which allowed ABC to
use any or all of his statements in
their broadcast. Samotyj's testimony
said that he signed the release be
cause the questions asked of him dur
ing the interview had seemed so out
of line with what he said he had un
derstood was the stated purpose of
the interview, that he thought his
comments would never be used.
The National News Council
ruled Friday that Polish journalist
Marek Samotyj — currently a
Professional Journalism Fellow
here — was unfairly portrayed as
a Soviet spy during an interview
broadcast on the ABC 20/20
news program.
However, the council refused
to rule against the network on
two other charge's filed by Stan
ford Communication Prof. Lyle
Nelson ori behalf of Samotyj,
namely that ABC did not in
dicate the true nature of the in
terview that they intended to
conduct and that the show's pro
ducers edited the tape so that it
no longer accurately reflected
that interview.
Although Nelson said he was
pleased because "esentially they
found our main charge valid,"
one of Samotyj's colleagues, Pro
fessional Journalism Fellow (PJF)
Ed Beitiks, said he thought the
council had exhibited a "cavalier
attitude toward the damage
done to (Samotyj's) life," a feel
ing expressed by several PJFs.
Following the rulingon Friday,
ABC officials told the San Jose
Mercury News that they stand by
their story.
"We believe it to be fair and
accurate. The National News
Council is a fallible group that
has once again demonstrated its
ability to make a mistake," a
network spokesperson said.
The Council — an independ
ent, voluntary organization
composed of media and public
sector advisers — meets about
four times a year. The group had
decided to meet here well
before the "Nelson vs. ABC"
case was scheduled.
In reaching their decision, the
members of the 18-person coun

cil reviewed a tape of the seg
ment, "A Target for Spies" which
was aired on ABC March 4. Ex
cerpts from a 20-minute in
terview with Samotyj showed
the 34-year-old Fulbright scholar
being asked if he was a spy. His
image was frozen on (he screen
as the ABC reporter claimed that
foreign scholars learn informa
tion at American universities
which they take back to Eastern
bloc countries and put to use on
military projects. On film,
Samotyj denied that he was a
spy, but said he could not prove
it.
Samotyj, his wife Elizabeth and
their children are here until June
when he was to have returned to
Poland to his job as the editor of
a technical magazine. He is a
trained engineer and has
audited some engineering
classes here.
Since the airing of the ABC
show, Samotyj fears for his
future in Poland and doubts that
he can return to his position as
editor, or act as a teacher, ac
cording to several sources.
Samotyj has been cautioned not a
to talk to reporters, for fear ofn\

further jeopardizing his position
in Poland. Sources say he fears
for the well-being of some of the
members of his family who are in
Poland now.
Nelson, in his official com
plaint to the Council, claimed
that ABC took advantage of
Samotyj's "lack of sophistication
in the ways of American tele
vision and journalism 'on an en
tirely false and unprofessional
basis'."
According to Nelson, writing
on Samotyj's behalf, the in
terview was set up under the
pretense of a discussion about
scholarly transfer of information
and Samotyj was not warned that
he would be asked about spying.
Due to the current sensitive situ
aton in Poland, Samotyj would
likely never haveagreed to an in
terview involving spying, Nelson
argued in his complaint.
At least three other University
officials, Bechtel International
Center Director Lee Ziegler,
Mechanical Engineerng Prof.
Bernard Roth and Harry Press,
managing director of the PJF
k program, say they, too, were un-
the impression that the show

was about technology transfer,
according to Nelson.
ABC argued, however, that
the University had been notified
that the content of the show and
interview involved spying, via
University News and Publication
Director Bob Beyers.
Beyers told the Daily Friday
that the word "spy" had only
arisen once in the context of a
conversation between himself
and an ABC representative,
when one of them — he can't re
member which — joked that
"this sounds like another 'Spies
in the Valley'" piece, what
Beyers said has almost become a
"generic term" for stories about
technology transfer in this area.
The Tresidder room in which
the council met was crowded
throughout the discussion of the
Nelson vs. ABC case with about
60 observers in attendance.
Many Communication Dept.
faculty and students attended
the meeting, as did Nelson, and
Marek and Elizabeth Samotyj.
Visibly shaken by thenatureof
some of the Council's remarks
about him, Samotyj sat with
downcast eyes and left im
mediately after the ruling.
At one point council member
Franklin Williams, former am
bassador to Ghana, was arguing
against the legitimacy of the
complaint about the intent of
the interview and said, "He
(Samotyj) just didn't know what
he was doing.. .after the in
terview he signed a release. He's
a big boy."
Three council members dis
qualified themselves from the
debate: Stanford Communica
tion Prof. Elie Abel; Norman
Isaacs, the council's chairman
who is currently a visiting

professor in the department; and
William Scott, who is affiliated with
ABC
This left the council without ade
quate input from broadcast special
ists when council member Margo
Huston, an editorial writer from the
Milwaukee journal raised a question
about the- prevalence of the "splic
ing" technique in network news.
"I know that in print journalism, if
we omit what someone says, we use

dot-dot-dot. Is there a dot-dot-dot in
broadcast?" she asked.
Abel, from the sidelines, suggested
the panel consult Prof. Henry
Breitrose, chairman of the Com
munication Dept., who was in atten
dance.
"It is done. It is generally not
looked upon as good form,"
Breitrose said. Out of the council's
earshot, one professor said, "At any
reputable operation it would be
grounds for firing."
Nelson said Saturday that "how
network programs are edited in the
long run may even be a more impor

tant issue than this individual case. I
strongly object to the practice of
splicing two sentences together (out
of context.) It's a dangerous and very
bad thing."
A preliminary draft included the
statement that the Council
"deplored" the use of the splicing
technique — one of Nelson's com
plaints filed with the council — but
no reference was made to this in the
final ruling.
Several of Samotyj's colleagues in
the PJF program objected to what
Beitiks, a reporter and editor for the
Santa Maria Times, called the weak,
"wishy-washy" wording.

"It doesn't say much for the Na
tional News Council when faced with
incredibly sloppy journalism, to deny
that the pretenses used in the ;et-up
of the interview were un
professional," Beitiks said. 'If they
don't have the evidence in front of
them in this case, they don't have the
evidence in any case."
PJF Lydia Wasowicz agreed: "I wish

bad thing."
A preliminary draft included the
statement that the Council
"deplored" the use of the splicing
technique — one of Nelson's com
plaints filed with the council — but
no reference was made to this in the
final ruling.
Several of Samotyj's colleagues in
the PJF program objected to what
Beitiks, a reporter and editor for the
Santa Maria Times, called the weak,
"wishy-washy" wording.

"It doesn't say much for the Na
tional News Council when faced with
incredibly sloppy journalism, to deny
that the pretenses used in the ;et-up
of the interview were un
professional," Beitiks said. 'If they
don't have the evidence in front of
them in this case, they don't have the
evidence in any case."
PJF Lydia Wasowicz agreed: "I wish
the wording were stronger."
Wasowicz, a reporter for UPI, said
she had watched the program with
outrage at the extent to which
Samotyj's statements had been taken
out of context, adding that she was

particularly concerned about
Samotyj and his family's future in Po
land. Wasowicz as a child had immi
grated to the United States from Po
land.
A major factor in the debate was a
release which Samotyj signed after
the interview, which allowed ABC to
use any or all of his statements in
their broadcast. Samotyj's testimony
said that he signed the release be
cause the questions asked of him dur
ing the interview had seemed so out
of line with what he said he had un
derstood was the stated purpose of
the interview, that he thought his
comments would never be used.
