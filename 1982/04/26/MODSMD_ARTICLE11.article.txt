## The 						Daily recommends... Fee Assessment endorsements for April 28/29 election 
### 
Academic Oranizatons Board — yes

In this space, we seek to remind you that the
Academic Organizations Board (AOB) funds
small, academically-oriented student
organizations like the Black Pre-Law Society
and the History Undergraduate
Students Association tnat are valuable to
students here and which likely could not exist

The Band — yes—

It almost sounds as though the everpresent
Leland Stanford Junior University Marching
Band has been reborn: for next year, there is an
emphasis on quality of sound, attention to
precision of formation, regular practice and no
more ringers. With this return to performance

Chaparral — yes —

Its editors admit the fact freely: the Chaparral
needs money. Requesting only the third fee
assessment in the organization's 84 year history,
the Chappie promises that this last request will
send the humor magazine into the black.
Although there's a charge for the magazine,

Club Sports — yes -

Nearly a thousand students participate in 30
sports clubs that will benefit from the three
quarter fee assessment requested by Club
Sports. Money from fee assessments account for
only half of this group's budget which is used to
offset some of the equipment, coaching and
travel expenses incurred by the various clubs.
Because of the high cost of competing all
participants in club sports must pay dues and

Glee Club — no

The Glee Club is requesting a one quarter fee
assessment to cover travel expenses for their
next tour, on the basis that their tours provide a
public relations service for Stanford. We feel,
however, that it is unfair for them to expect the
student body to fund their travel when many
other choral and sports groups, which

Graduate Students' Association — yes

The Graduate Students Association (GSA)
"improves the quality of graduate student life at
Stanford" in many ways: by advocating grad
student interests in negotiations with the
University on topics like housing; in sponsoring
social and recreational events; and in sponsoring
and co-sponsoring programs like the upcoming
symposium on "Universities, Industries and

Legal Counseling — no recommendation

There is a certain amount of fear that one will
be left without counsel some dark and stormy
night after being arrested for sign-stealing, so
most students leave their dollars in the coffers of
the legal counseling service as insurance.
However, we feel it may be time to take a look
at the service which, it should be noted, neither

SCOPE — yes

The Stanford Committee on Political
Education (SCOPE) has done an impressive job
of bringing an interesting and diverse group of
speakers, including Caspar Weinberger,
Congressman Morris Udall and ex-CIA agent
JohnStockwell.

without fee assessment funding. The three
quarter AOB fee assessment deserves your
support; small groups are just as beneficial to
their members and important to the University
as large groups are, and academic groups are at
least as important as primarily social ones.

without abandoning the flair that makes the
band so unique, the band particularly deserves
your support. Here is a group that a wide range
of students join and that even more benefit
from; we urge you to vote for band funding.

meet many of their own expenses.
Through its attempts to finance its own
activities, Club Sports has made a serious effort
to meet as many of its own costs as possible. We
urge a yes vote for Club Sports so tnat it can
continue to provide additional opportunities
for a large number of students to participate in
sports on a non-varsity level.

undoubtedly do just as much for the University's
public image, manage to provide their own
means for touring. In the interests of limiting
pork-barrel politics we urge you to vote "no" on
the Glee Club fee assessment.

Graduate Students." We wish that a larger
percentage of grad students would take advantage
of GSA programs and activities, but we don't see
the lack of attendance as a comment on the
popularity of the GSA. We strongly urge all
students to vote in favor of the two-quarter GSA
fee assessment.

will represent you in court, nor advise you if you
have legal disputes with the University.
However the service does provide referral to
attorneys in the area and some advice regarding
leases off campus. The Daily has no
recommendation for this fee assessment.

SCOPE has assembled a core group of
dedicated underclassmen, which is vital to
ensure the successful continuation of its
program. We recommend them for a one
quarter fee assessment.

Publicatons Board—yes

Undeniably, the publications board
assessment is one of the most vital and deserved
to be approved. Giving students a chance to
publish through both small and relatively large
media is a benefit which is rarely so readily
available as it is through the publications Doard
structure. However, we are concerned with the
way the three-quarter assessment has been

Speakers Bureau — yes

This year's full schedule of well-attended,
well-organized events sponsored by the ASSU
Speaker's Bureau has proven that this
organization is capable of putting together
interesting, informative programs, often
involving the leading experts of a particular
field. Because of this group students this year
were able to hear from people as diverse as

SACDF — yes

The Stanford Arms Control and Disarmament
Forum is purposed to educate the community
on all sides of the issue of nuclear arms. They
have been active in their two years of existence
and, funded mostly by local business
organizations, have brought a variety of
speakers (i.e.John Kenneth Galbraith) to
campus and most notably sponsored two

SEE — no recommendation

The Daily's decision not to make a
recommendation on the SEE fee assessment
stems not from any dissatisfaction with the goals
of the group, nor any doubt as to the
importance of environmental education. While
we agree with the need for students to be aware

Stanford Progressive Alliance —yes

The Stanford Progressive Alliance (SPA),
demonstrated great care and effort in its
programs this year, i.e. Disorientation Week,
and therefore deserves the two quarter fee
assessment requested for next year. SPA,
making no pretense of its left-wing slant,

SURE — yes

Stanford United for Rape Elimination and the
Rape Education Project have combined to
request a one quarter, $12,000 fee assessment.
The money would be used to buy a golf cart so
that SURE could extend its escort service to
include weekends and an evening shuttle
service to and from the libraries. REP needs

Women's Center — yes

While the Womens' Center does not provide
specific services that every student will at some
time want to use, it is nonetheless a valuable
resource for those women who do wish to take
advantage of its many references and informal
programs. By co-sponsoring speakers and
programs of interest to the entire Stanford

Assessment Amendment— yes

Nearly every time you attend a speech, read a
student publication, listen to the Band, or take a
class taught bv a guest professor, you are
enjoying the benefits of a fee assessment. In the
present system, however, groups are being
crippled and have been forced to cut back on
their programs and services because large
numbers of students — even more than vote in
elections — indiscriminately claim refunds.
The proposed reform, which the Daily has
supported from the outset, would solve the
most pressing problems. This system would

Freeze Referendum — yes

Last week the whole array of educational
events associated with around zero week
helped to educate Stanford students and the
whole nation on nuclear issues.
This week students have a chance to vote on a
referendum that calls for the government of the
U.S. to propose to the government of the Soviet
Union to implement a mutually verifiable freeze
on the production, testing and deployment of
all nuclear warheads, missiles and delivery
systems.
While the value of such a referendum is
mainly symbolic, overwhelming support of the
freeze, when added to similar manifestations of

Please support the Daily

The Daily relies primarily on advertising
revenues for the bulk of its operating costs.
Through ad sales we are able to provide roughly
92 percent of the capital needed for typesetting,
printing, materials, business and editorial
expenses. Unfortunately, like most newspapers,
if we don't pay our bills on time, we're out of
business. On the other hand our advertisers
sometimes insist on a three or four-month
leeway, leaving our day-to-day operations with
tricky cash flow problems.
The eight percent of our operating costs
which the fee assessment actually provides,
represents a critical, cash-on-hana balance,
without which, we would be in serious trouble.
Ideally, the Daily could maintain a reserve

Richard Allen, Ray Bradbury and Gore Vidal to
name only a few. The bureau has proven it can
draw such people and organize their
appearances. Next year's director has already
begun formulating plans for the bureau's
extensive activities. The Bureau deserves a
three-quarter Fee Assessment so it can
continue.

"Weapons Crisis Weeks." Because their private
funding was contingent on their securing future
student support and because the subject of
nuclear arms is one of national, international,
and life's-blood concern we feel it appropriate
that students assume a portion of the financial
support for their education in this matter.

of environmental issues, our primary concern is
that SEE programs this year do not seem to have
reached a sufficiently large number of students,
nor does their budget proposal indicate
convincing need, to warrant their receiving a
fee assessment.

organizations. In the interest of diversity we

series of rape education panels. We feel that
both of these organizations provide a great and
necessary community service and deserve
student support for expansion.

many students, male and female. We believe it is
important to have such a group on campus and
therefore support the Center's bid for a fee
assessment.

allow refunds only to those who vote. Student
opinion would then be expressed at the polls,
rather than in the refund line. The reform would
establish an Association Fee which would
logically group together three valuable ASSU
groups — the Program Fee, Academic
Organizations Board and Publications Board.
Moreover, it would make it more difficult for
groups to get on the ballot which, we hope, will
prevent the amount of total assessments from
continuing to increase.

concern being made all across the country, will
put added pressure on government leaders to
make sincere and serious efforts at reducing the
levels of production and spending on nuclear
weapons.
In addition, widespread support of nuclear
freeze measures will challenge politicians to
seek innovative ways of effectively dealing with
an almost 40 year problem.
For these reasons we urge students to join In
support of the national nuclear freeze
movement by voting yes on the bilateral nuclear
freeze referendum in the upcoming ASSU
elections.

receivable. However, two years ago the
management decided to purchase a
computerized typesetting system which both
depleted our reserves and has proven very
costly to maintain. We are enjoying the
educational benefits of the VDT system, but it
has put us in a critical financial position.
We are asking for a four-quarter fee
assessment as a bulk subscription from our
nearly 12,000-strong student readership. We ask
that you support us so that we can continue our
commitment to covering the campus as no one
else can, every day. We ask that you vote yes on
the Stanford Daily's fee assessment.

Nearly a thousand students participate in 30

The Glee Club is requesting a one quarter fee

Undeniably, the publications board

Nearly every time you attend a speech, read a
student publication, listen to the Band, or take a
class taught bv a guest professor, you are

crippled and have been forced to cut back on
their programs and services because large
numbers of students — even more than vote in

Freeze Referendum — yes

Last week the whole array of educational
events associated with around zero week

whole nation on nuclear issues.
This week students have a chance to vote on a
referendum that calls for the government of the
U.S. to propose to the government of the Soviet
Union to implement a mutually verifiable freeze
on the production, testing and deployment of
all nuclear warheads, missiles and delivery
systems.
While the value of such a referendum is
mainly symbolic, overwhelming support of the

Please support the Daily

The Daily relies primarily on advertising
revenues for the bulk of its operating costs.
Through ad sales we are able to provide roughly
92 percent of the capital needed for typesetting,
printing, materials, business and editorial
expenses. Unfortunately, like most newspapers,
if we don't pay our bills on time, we're out of
business. On the other hand our advertisers
sometimes insist on a three or four-month
leeway, leaving our day-to-day operations with
tricky cash flow problems.
The eight percent of our operating costs
which the fee assessment actually provides,
represents a critical, cash-on-hana balance,
without which, we would be in serious trouble.
Ideally, the Daily could maintain a reserve

Stanford United for Rape Elimination and the

While the Womens' Center does not provide

Assessment Amendment— yes

Nearly every time you attend a speech, read a
student publication, listen to the Band, or take a
class taught bv a guest professor, you are
enjoying the benefits of a fee assessment. In the
present system, however, groups are being
crippled and have been forced to cut back on
their programs and services because large
numbers of students — even more than vote in
elections — indiscriminately claim refunds.
The proposed reform, which the Daily has
supported from the outset, would solve the
most pressing problems. This system would

Freeze Referendum — yes

Last week the whole array of educational
events associated with around zero week
helped to educate Stanford students and the
whole nation on nuclear issues.
This week students have a chance to vote on a
referendum that calls for the government of the
U.S. to propose to the government of the Soviet
Union to implement a mutually verifiable freeze
on the production, testing and deployment of
all nuclear warheads, missiles and delivery
systems.
While the value of such a referendum is
mainly symbolic, overwhelming support of the
freeze, when added to similar manifestations of

Please support the Daily

The Daily relies primarily on advertising
revenues for the bulk of its operating costs.
Through ad sales we are able to provide roughly
92 percent of the capital needed for typesetting,
printing, materials, business and editorial
expenses. Unfortunately, like most newspapers,
if we don't pay our bills on time, we're out of
business. On the other hand our advertisers
sometimes insist on a three or four-month
leeway, leaving our day-to-day operations with
tricky cash flow problems.
The eight percent of our operating costs
which the fee assessment actually provides,
represents a critical, cash-on-hana balance,
without which, we would be in serious trouble.
Ideally, the Daily could maintain a reserve

organizations like the Black Pre-Law Society

Band has been reborn: for next year, there is an
emphasis on quality of sound, attention to
precision of formation, regular practice and no

Chaparral — yes —

Its editors admit the fact freely: the Chaparral
needs money. Requesting only the third fee
assessment in the organization's 84 year history,
the Chappie promises that this last request will
send the humor magazine into the black.
Although there's a charge for the magazine,

Club Sports — yes -

Nearly a thousand students participate in 30
sports clubs that will benefit from the three
quarter fee assessment requested by Club
Sports. Money from fee assessments account for
only half of this group's budget which is used to
offset some of the equipment, coaching and
travel expenses incurred by the various clubs.
Because of the high cost of competing all
participants in club sports must pay dues and

Glee Club — no

The Glee Club is requesting a one quarter fee
assessment to cover travel expenses for their
next tour, on the basis that their tours provide a
public relations service for Stanford. We feel,
however, that it is unfair for them to expect the
student body to fund their travel when many

and co-sponsoring programs like the upcoming

Legal Counseling — no recommendation

There is a certain amount of fear that one will
be left without counsel some dark and stormy
night after being arrested for sign-stealing, so
most students leave their dollars in the coffers of
the legal counseling service as insurance.
However, we feel it may be time to take a look
at the service which, it should be noted, neither

Education (SCOPE) has done an impressive job

quarter AOB fee assessment deserves your
support; small groups are just as beneficial to
their members and important to the University
as large groups are, and academic groups are at
least as important as primarily social ones.

without abandoning the flair that makes the
band so unique, the band particularly deserves
your support. Here is a group that a wide range

Through its attempts to finance its own

recommendation for this fee assessment.

SCOPE has assembled a core group of
dedicated underclassmen, which is vital to
ensure the successful continuation of its
program. We recommend them for a one
quarter fee assessment.

Publicatons Board—yes

Undeniably, the publications board
assessment is one of the most vital and deserved
to be approved. Giving students a chance to
publish through both small and relatively large
media is a benefit which is rarely so readily
available as it is through the publications Doard
structure. However, we are concerned with the
way the three-quarter assessment has been

This year's full schedule of well-attended,
well-organized events sponsored by the ASSU
Speaker's Bureau has proven that this
organization is capable of putting together
