## Davis wins Pac-10s 
### Sally Jenkins 
Surprising everyone but
themselves, the Cardinal men's
tennis team took the singles
and doubles titles of the Pacif
ic-10 Individual Men's Tennis
Championships yesterday at
Ojai to finish a close second to
UCLA in the team tournament.
Stanford sophomore Scott
Davis triumphed over Bruin
Marcel Freeman to win the top
singles spot in only two sets 6-0,
7-6. He combined with team
mate Jeff Arons to destroy
Freeman and Robbie Venter in
the doubles final in only two
sets again, 6-3,6-3.
Davis and Arons sucessfully
defended Stanford titles at
both spots with their victories.
Davis lost a narrow match to
departed teammate Tim May
otte in an all-Stanford finals last
season, and Arons de
parted Mike Falberg previously
held the doubles title.
UCLA finished first in team
totals with 17 points to take the
tournament trophy Thatcher

Cup, which was no surprise
since this year's Bruin squad
has more depth and power
than an offshore rig.
But Stanford was only a step
away with 12 points and far
ahead of the rest of the more
than respectable field, a puzzl
ing turn of events to everyone
but Stanford head coach Dick
Gould.
The Cardinal did a very good
imitation of a bad team in los
ing to USC and UCLA by identi
cal 7-2 match scores in Los An
geles last week, but Gould
maintained that he hadn't seen
anything a good home crowd
couldn't fix.
So Stanford was either at a
home court disadvantage in
Los Angeles, or else was doing
a very neat hustle, because the
Cardinal players wreaked all
kinds of havoc on the more
neutral courts of Ojai. USC and
Arizona, both of which had de
feated Stanford earlier in the
season, were able to manage
only five points each to tie for

third, and Arizona State fin
ished fourth with four points.
Set the tower bells to ringing,
because UC-Berkeley finshed
last with only three points.
Davis' journey to the title was
perhaps the most masterful
tournament performance seen
at Ojai in a long time. He de
stroyed four of five opponents
in only two sets, his only third
set coming against USC's Sean
Brawley in the second round.
In the doubles, Davis and
Arons rolled over Sullivan and
Dewey Cratten of ASU 6-2,6-1,
and barely avoided an upset
against Blaine Willenbourgand
John Davis of UCLA in the
quarterfinals, 4-6, 6-4, 7-6.
Dan Saltz and Bobby Berger
of UCLA lasted for two tough
sets in the semis Saturday 7-6,
7-5, and Davis and Arons over
came the last and toughest
Bruin twosome in Freeman and
Venter relatively easily yester
day afternoon.
The regular season draws to
what should be an exciting
close this Friday and Saturday,
when the Trojans and Bruins
travel to Stanford for the last
all-important home matches.
In the meantime, Pepperdine
will visit the varsity courts
Wednesday afternoon at noon.
