# NCAA puts USC on probation
## 
### Associated Press 
Los Angeles — A source close to USC said Saturday that
members of the athletic department and some university
administrators were aware that assistant coach Marv Goux
sold tickets for football players. He also said that Goux
wasn't the only coach on the staff who sold players' tickets
• over a period of several years.
The NCAA placed USC on probation for three years Fri
day with two years of direct penalties, prohibiting the
school from appearing in bowl games in the 1982-83 and
1983-84 academic years and on television in 1983 and 1984.
The other part of the penalty prevents Goux from recruiting
for two years and freezes his salary during that period.
It is believed that sanctions against USC were based main
' ly on Goux's ticket-selling activities.
"Does somebody think that Marv Goux is some evil
sorcerer who devised this whole plan by himself?" the
source said. "If they do, they're very naive. Everybody was
aware of what was going on. Marv was a line officer follow
ing orders. This just happened to be his off-the-field duty.
"Marv wasn't the only guy selling tickets. There wasn't a
coach on the (USC) staff who didn't help a few alums by
buying tickets through the players."
The NCAA in its official statement said that an assistant
coach (Goux wasn't named in the report) "during a period
of 1971-1979 deliberately violated NCAA rules by selling
complimentary tickets for varsity football team members at
prices in excess of their face value in order to provide large
sums of cash to team members who chose to participate in
this arrangement."
The NCAA said players received as much as $2000 in one
year for their tickets.
"They would buy tickets from freshman players at a
modest price and then would sell what they said were their
tickets to eight different guys," he said. "Everybody wants
to buy a ticket from a star player."
The players are allowed four complimentary tickets and it
was once permissible under NCAA rules to sell them at face
value. Now, however, the NCAA has ruled that tickets can't
be sold "at, below or above face value."
