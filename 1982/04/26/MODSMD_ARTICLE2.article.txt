# National News Council: 'UN of journalism?'
## 
### 
While it has no power to regulate or impose
penalties, the National News Council provides a
forum through which individuals or organiza
tions can present a complaint when they feel an
injustice has been done because of "inaccurate
and/or unfair reporting of the news," accord
ing to their statement of purpose.
Usually consulted when redress to the news
organizations themselves fails, the council's
services are provided freely, with the stipu
lation that complainant'(s)' sign a waiver "stipu
lating that no legal action is underway or con
templated."

The council's decision in Nelson vs.ABC is
likely the final step in a series of measures taken
on the Polish scholar's behalf by the Com
munication Dept. and his colleagues; com
plaints began the evening the broadcast was
aired, when the PJFs sent telegrams to ABC de
manding a retraction. Since the March 4 broad
cast, they have written numerous letters to vari
ous organizations like the Columbia Journalism
Review, but received little satisfaction.
Despite the tempered decision, Communica
tion Prof. Lyle Nelson says he still believes or
ganizations like the National News Counil are a

good thing.
"It's vital to have an organization of that type.
Otherwise I don't see any other organization
for criticism of the press and I am absolutely
against any kind of government regulations.
The only avenue you have is peer pressure."
Nelson said that while an attorney who had
reviewed the evidence in this case involving
Samotyj suggested that legal redress through a
libel suit might be warranted, the cost and pro
tracted litigation made that option unaccep
table for Samotyj.
Meanwhile PJF Ed Beitiks called the council
the "UN of journalism.
"They sit around and talk about things they
believe make a difference ... but by their own
admission it's a hit or miss thing. Some news or
ganizations give it fair play, others ignore it."
The CBS network has publicly stated that
should the National News Council rule against
it, CBS will air those findings.
Last Friday's agenda featured several dif
ferent examples of the kinds of cases the coun
cil addresses.
One discussion involved the options for ade
quate viewer/reader redress despite techno
logical restrictions.
On Thursday, the Council had sternly
chastised Time magazine for not meeting "ac

cepted journalistic standards for fairness and
accuracy" in reporting a story involving child
sexuality.
In addition to its role as a kind of media
watchdog, the council also seeks to protect un
warranted attacks on the press. Franklin Wil
liams and Ernest van den Haag, a professor of
law from New York Law School, were the most
vocally skeptical of the merits of the Nelson vs.
ABC complaint. Midway into the discussion of
the Samotyj incident Friday morning, Williams
expressed some concern that the council had
been willing to blast Time magazine the day
before and indicated that he thought it perhaps
was now turning on television.
In another case, the council found a charge
against a CBS news report that it had distorted
and in effect interjected considerable opinion
into a news report, unwarranted. A lively de
bate regarding whether networks had the re
sponsibly to label different program segments
more clearly preceded that ruling.
Prof. Elie Abel of the Communication Dept.
(who is also a council member) noted in the
course of a discussion, that reporters like CBS'
Bill Moyers were "trying to create a new style of
reporting," and that it might require new ways
of presenting stories as opinion or commentary.
