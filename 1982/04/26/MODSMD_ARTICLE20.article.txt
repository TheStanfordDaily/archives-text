# Men win last match
## 
### Robert Stone 
Victory was a long time in
coming but it was all that much
sweeter for the Cardinal as it
methodically picked apart Cal
State-Long Beach in men's vol
leyball action Friday.
The 3-1 triumph came in
Stanford's season finale and
snapped a 10-match losing
streak that began in March.
The Cardinal finished 8-18 ov
erall and 3-13 in conference
play, while Long Beach State
dropped to 4-11 in the league.
After a shaky start with Stan
ford winning a game 15-12 and
losing one 6-15, the team re
grouped and polished off the
49ers 15-3 and 15-8. "I wasn't
pleased in the first game, we
gave them too many points —
offensively we made too many
errors," said Card assistant
coach Don Shaw, "and we
were flat in the second game,
that's all there was to it."
In the first game Stanford fell
behind quickly but battled
back as the lead see-sawed un
til the 49ers opened up a 12-9
margin. It was as far as the vis
itors would go, however, and
the Cardinal climbed ahead in
spurts to take a 14-12 advan
tage.
After a series of sideouts
Stanford wrapped the game up
when Card senior Mark Rea
gan set up a Randy Smith slam
to the back of the court that
Long Beach State couldn't
reach.
It appeared as if Stanford had
built the momentum to sweep
the 49ers, but the second game
was an about-face. Long Beach
State had jumped ahead 5-0

before Stanford closed the
score to 8-5 with a staunch de
fense and a pair of 49er techni
cal errors.
When Long Beach moved
ahead 11 -6, however, there was
no stopping them. The 49ers
took advantage of a collapsed
Stanford defense and gained
four quick points for the win.
"In the third and fourth
game the guys played really
well, I knew they were going to
win it tonight," noted Shaw.
The third game was Stanford
all the way as the Cardinal
would add three points almost
every time it served. Cardinals
Smith and Steve Saeta hustled
on defense and setter Kip
Engen directed the offense as
the Cardinal showed no mercy.
The match-winning game
started out as a replay of the
third game but the 49ers
weren't going to let it be that
easy. The Cardinal carved out a
9-3 lead on the powerful hit
ting of Reagan and freshman
Craig Lauchner before Long
Beach rallied to halt a Stanford
rout. The 49er front line
blocked a Saeta slam to bring
them within two, 10-8.
At this point it was Long
Beach State that lost its poise as
they committed a double hit
and a net violation to help the
Stanford cause. The game
point came for the Cardinal
when Long Beach hit the bal!
out on the right side.
The match was the last in
tercollegiate competition for
seniors Engen, Smith, and Bob
Dean. "It was nice to end on a
winning note — we had a lot of
tough losses," said Smith.
