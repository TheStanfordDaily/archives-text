Great summer
jobs in Hawaii
. .are really hard to find, but if
you like sitting in the sun, not get
ting involved and remaining ig
norant of the world around you,
the Daily may be the place for you.
Surprised? Well, come on by
and pick up a news or features as
signment; or come in and sign up
to night staff. Once in the door,
the Daily's trained crew of de-pro
grammers will shake those lazy
spring cobwebs off your no-doubt
peeling body, take you to
charted areas of the university, in
troduce you to the people about
whom you have only read, clue
you in to what "the usual" means
at Luv's and show you how we put
out the Daily, every day.
Drop by and ask to speak to
Managng Editor Julie Kaufmann
or one of the department editors
this afternoon or any afternoon af
ter 2 p.m.
