Britain captures South Georgian
London — Taking the military offensive for the first time in its con
frontation with Argentina over the Falkland Islands, Britain announced
last night it had recaptured the remote South Atlantic island of South
Georgia yesterday.
In an assault by a vanguard of the naval task force Britain dispatched
to the South Atlantic 20 days ago, British troops landing by combat heli
copter from a few warships offshore retook the port of Grytviken after a
brief battle with a small Argentine occupation force, British Defense
Minister John Nott said here yesterday night.
"The Argentine forces offered only limited resistance to British
forces," Nott said in a statement read to reporters outside 10 Downing
Street with Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher at his side. " So far, no Brit
ish casualties have been reported. We have no information on the Ar
gentine casualty position."
By late yesterday night, there was no confirmation from Buenos Aires
of the British claim to have taken the island, but the Argentine govern
ment said earlier in the day that British warships and aircraft had at
tacked the garrison on the island with "intense shelling" and that its
forces were resisting. The ruling military junta in Buenos Aires also re
ported that two British helicopters attacked an Argentine submarine in
the main port of the South Georgia Islands, z dependency of the
Falkland Islands 600 miles to the west.
The military clash, the first for British naval forces since the Suez
hostilities in 1956, came 23 days after Argentine troops seized South
Georgia and the Falklands, which have been the subject of disputes be
tween the two countries for nearly 150 years.
The British landing came as U.S. Secretary of State Alexander Haig was
still seeking to fashion a negotiated settlement to the crisis after spend
ing the past two weeks shuttling among London, Buenos Aires and
Washington. He presented new U.S. ideas to British Foreign Secretary
Francis Pym in Washington Thursday and Friday and was scheduled to
meet yesterday afternoon with Argentine Foreign Minister Nicanor
Costa Mendez, who arrived in Washington yesterday.
(In Washington, the State Department said that a meeting
scheduled for yesterday afternoon between Haig and Costa
Mendez was postponed at the request of Argentine officials.
The statement added, however, that Haig and Costa Mendez
had talked by telephone during the afternoon and would
discuss the situation again this morning.)
Britain's invading troops reportedly were aided by a dozen
Royal Marine commandos who sneaked onto the island
from a submarine Thursday and reported there were fewer
than 50 Argentine troops defending it.
British combat helicopters began the attack at dawn by fir
ing on Argentine positions in Grytviken and attacking and
badly damaging a surfaced Argentine submarine entering
the harbor, according to British sources. While "a number of
warships" shelled Grytviken, the helicopters began landing
British troops at 4 p.m. London time (11 a.m. EDT), Nott said,
and the Argentine defenders surrendered two hours later.
"Just rejoice at that news and congratulate our forces and
the Marines," Thatcher told reporters as she and Nott re
fused to answer shouted questions about his statement. "Re
joice, rejoice," she said as she turned to walk back into 10
Downing Street with Nott.
Israeli pullout of Sinai finished
Rafah, Egypt — The red, white and black flag of Egypt was
unfurled over the northern and eastern stretches of the Sinai
yesterday for the first time in 15 years, marking the end of
Israel's occupation of the peninsula and the beginning of a
new era in Israeli-Egyptian relations.
In a simple but emotional 30-minute ceremony here, the
Egyptian governor of North Sinai, Youssef Abu Taleb, raised
the flag as a small crowd of local people and federal
dignitaries sang Egypt's national anthem and shouted, "Long
live Egypt, long live Egypt."
"Thanks be to God for the return of this precious part of
our land to mother Egypt," Taleb said in a brief speech. "I
feel that I am not alone. With us are the spirits of the martyrs
and heroes and foremost Anwar Sadat, our late leader who
gave his life for this moment. It was his decision of war and
then his decision of peace that made this moment possible."
Taleb was referring to the slain president's decision to
launch the last war against Israel in October 1973 and his his
toric trip to Jerusalem in November 1977 to make peace with
Israel.
While the flag was being hoisted here in Rafah and in
Sharm el-Sheikh in the far southern Sinai, President Hosni
Mubarak was laying a wreath at Sadat's burial place at the
tomb of the unknown soldier in a Cairo suburb near where
he was assassinated last October by Moslem extremists.
Later, Mubarak participated in a joint Israeli-Egyptian tele
cast, reaffirming once again Egypt's commitment to peace
with Israel. He hailed the Israeli's response to the "historic
and courageous peace initiate" of president Sadat, and said it
expressed "the will of every Egyptian" and had culminated in
peace.
Mubarek gave special thanks to the "historic role" of

former president Jimmy Carter in helping to arrange the
peace treaty between Egypt and Israel.
Begin threatens attacks on PLO
Washington — Israeli Prime Minister Menachem Begin
yesterday refusedto rule out the possibility of future Israeli
attacks against Palestine Liberation Organization encamp
ments in Lebanon if the PLO continues to "shed Jewish
blood."
"If they are quiet on the other side, we shall keep the
peace on our side," Begin said in a televised interview from
Jerusalem. "!f they attack us again, we shall hit them."
Last week's air raids on Palestinian sites near Beirut, Leba
non, were ordered because PLO guerrillas had killed 17 Is
raelis and wounded 250 others since the U.S.-mediated
cease-fire between Israel and the PLO took effect last year,
Begin said in an interview on NBC-TV's "Meet the Press."
"We exercised restraint for over nine months," he said. "But
there are limits."
Begin said his country made "great sacrifices" in returning
the Sinai Peninsula to Egypt, but he denied that the Israeli
people are filled with forebodings about surrendering the
desert region.
"I do not agree with the cynics who say the peace treaty is a
piece of paper," Begin said. "It is not. It is the most serious
commitment. I cannot accept the assumption that our peo
ple have forebodings."
Moreover, he said, the Egyptians realize that "Israel's reac
tion will be swift" if there is any breach in the Egyptian com
mitment to the pact under which the Sinai was returned.
Begin said he does not expect the United States to take a
hard-line stance toward Israel in regard to other goals in the
Camp David process, such as autonomy for Palestinians in
the occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip. But, he said, "If at
any time we face pressure, we will press back."
On the question of Palestinian autonomy, Begin said he
would accept a U.S. initiative to get talks moving again if the
proposals are "good and proper." "If not," he siad, "we shall
reject them. But I don't know if there are such proposals."
Asked if Israel might also withdraw from the occupied
Golan Heights, captured from Syria in 1967 and annexed last
December, Begin said there is "no comparison" between
that area and the Sinai.
El Salvador rightists tighten rule
San Salvador, El Salvador — Right-wingers backing Rob
erto d'Aubuisson have consolidated their grip on the Consti
tuent Assembly and are likely to keep an equally tight rein on
the provisional president they pick.
Mario Redaelli, spokesman for d'Aubuisson's Republican
Nationalist Alliance, or ARENA, said: "The assembly is like
the mother of the little boy. It can say yes or no."
D'Aubuisson, an ultra-rightist and cashiered army major
who last fall was an underground figure accused of plotting
to overthrow the government, was elected to run the as
sembly Thursday night.
"El Salvador has triumphed. We have won the ideological

struggle," proclaimed the new speaker, flanked by nine oth
er rightists who fill out the assembly's new directorate. There
wasn't a Christian Democrat in the group, despite pro
claimed U.S. pressure to include them.
El Salvador's new provisional president, who could be
chosen as early as today, may be the kind of moderate the
United States says it would like to see running the nation. But
the power of the presidency relative to the right-dominated
assembly is likely to be small.
The assembly not only will pick the chief executive, but
also has the power to set general elections, and write a new
constitution for El Salvador, which has been torn for 30
months by civil war between left and right.
Asked if the composition of the new leadership meant the
Christian Democrats lost their chance at legislative power
here, party leader Julio Rey Prendes replied: "We never had
it."
U.S. officials including Ambassador Deane Hinton and
House Majority Leader Jim Wright — have said repeatedly
that U.S. aid to El Salvador would flow smoother to a govern
ment including the Christian Democrats.
Polish church, government meet
Warsaw, Poland The heads of Poland's government and
its Roman Catholic Church met for more than two hours
here last night in what was seen as a potentially significant
new effort to ease political tensions in this crisis-torn nation.
The surprise meeting, between party and martial-law chief
Gen. Wojciech Jaruzelski and the Polish Primate,
Archbishop Jozef Glemp, was believed to be only their sec
ond since martial law was declared last December. The first
was in early January and was reportedly inconclusive.
Yesterday's session, which was announced by Polish tele
vision after it was under way, came on the eve of the
primate's scheduled departure for Rome for talks with Pope
John Paul 11.
It also followed by only two weeks Glemp's disclosure that
a lay Catholic social council had prepared a position paper
on the conditions necessary for "social accord." The an
nouncement was seen as an effort by the primate to force the
authorities to substantiate their repeated assertions of a de
sire to seek national agreement.
The churchman and the soldier apparently met in the
same government villa where they and the now-interned
Solidarity leader. Lech Walesa, held an unprecedented
three-way summit last November.
Informed sources said that Glemp had expected to meet
Jaruzelski two weeks ago, but that the session was twice post
poned. As of late last week, the primate had reportedly given
up hope of seeing Jaruzelski before his visit to Rome begin
ning today.

ish casualties have been reported. We have no information on the Ar
gentine casualty position."
By late yesterday night, there was no confirmation from Buenos Aires
of the British claim to have taken the island, but the Argentine govern
ment said earlier in the day that British warships and aircraft had at
tacked the garrison on the island with "intense shelling" and that its
forces were resisting. The ruling military junta in Buenos Aires also re
ported that two British helicopters attacked an Argentine submarine in
the main port of the South Georgia Islands, z dependency of the
Falkland Islands 600 miles to the west.
The military clash, the first for British naval forces since the Suez
hostilities in 1956, came 23 days after Argentine troops seized South
Georgia and the Falklands, which have been the subject of disputes be
tween the two countries for nearly 150 years.
The British landing came as U.S. Secretary of State Alexander Haig was
still seeking to fashion a negotiated settlement to the crisis after spend
ing the past two weeks shuttling among London, Buenos Aires and
Washington. He presented new U.S. ideas to British Foreign Secretary
Francis Pym in Washington Thursday and Friday and was scheduled to
meet yesterday afternoon with Argentine Foreign Minister Nicanor
Costa Mendez, who arrived in Washington yesterday.
(In Washington, the State Department said that a meeting
scheduled for yesterday afternoon between Haig and Costa
Mendez was postponed at the request of Argentine officials.
The statement added, however, that Haig and Costa Mendez
had talked by telephone during the afternoon and would
discuss the situation again this morning.)
Britain's invading troops reportedly were aided by a dozen
Royal Marine commandos who sneaked onto the island
from a submarine Thursday and reported there were fewer
than 50 Argentine troops defending it.
British combat helicopters began the attack at dawn by fir
ing on Argentine positions in Grytviken and attacking and
badly damaging a surfaced Argentine submarine entering
the harbor, according to British sources. While "a number of
warships" shelled Grytviken, the helicopters began landing
British troops at 4 p.m. London time (11 a.m. EDT), Nott said,
and the Argentine defenders surrendered two hours later.
"Just rejoice at that news and congratulate our forces and
the Marines," Thatcher told reporters as she and Nott re
fused to answer shouted questions about his statement. "Re
joice, rejoice," she said as she turned to walk back into 10
Downing Street with Nott.
Israeli pullout of Sinai finished
Rafah, Egypt — The red, white and black flag of Egypt was
unfurled over the northern and eastern stretches of the Sinai
yesterday for the first time in 15 years, marking the end of
Israel's occupation of the peninsula and the beginning of a
new era in Israeli-Egyptian relations.
In a simple but emotional 30-minute ceremony here, the
Egyptian governor of North Sinai, Youssef Abu Taleb, raised
the flag as a small crowd of local people and federal
dignitaries sang Egypt's national anthem and shouted, "Long
live Egypt, long live Egypt."
"Thanks be to God for the return of this precious part of
our land to mother Egypt," Taleb said in a brief speech. "I
feel that I am not alone. With us are the spirits of the martyrs
and heroes and foremost Anwar Sadat, our late leader who
gave his life for this moment. It was his decision of war and
then his decision of peace that made this moment possible."
Taleb was referring to the slain president's decision to
launch the last war against Israel in October 1973 and his his
toric trip to Jerusalem in November 1977 to make peace with
Israel.
While the flag was being hoisted here in Rafah and in
Sharm el-Sheikh in the far southern Sinai, President Hosni
Mubarak was laying a wreath at Sadat's burial place at the
tomb of the unknown soldier in a Cairo suburb near where
he was assassinated last October by Moslem extremists.
Later, Mubarak participated in a joint Israeli-Egyptian tele
cast, reaffirming once again Egypt's commitment to peace
with Israel. He hailed the Israeli's response to the "historic
and courageous peace initiate" of president Sadat, and said it
expressed "the will of every Egyptian" and had culminated in
peace.
Mubarek gave special thanks to the "historic role" of

former president Jimmy Carter in helping to arrange the
peace treaty between Egypt and Israel.
Begin threatens attacks on PLO
Washington — Israeli Prime Minister Menachem Begin
yesterday refusedto rule out the possibility of future Israeli
attacks against Palestine Liberation Organization encamp
ments in Lebanon if the PLO continues to "shed Jewish
blood."
"If they are quiet on the other side, we shall keep the
peace on our side," Begin said in a televised interview from
Jerusalem. "!f they attack us again, we shall hit them."
Last week's air raids on Palestinian sites near Beirut, Leba
non, were ordered because PLO guerrillas had killed 17 Is
raelis and wounded 250 others since the U.S.-mediated
cease-fire between Israel and the PLO took effect last year,
Begin said in an interview on NBC-TV's "Meet the Press."
"We exercised restraint for over nine months," he said. "But
there are limits."
Begin said his country made "great sacrifices" in returning
the Sinai Peninsula to Egypt, but he denied that the Israeli
people are filled with forebodings about surrendering the
desert region.
"I do not agree with the cynics who say the peace treaty is a
piece of paper," Begin said. "It is not. It is the most serious
commitment. I cannot accept the assumption that our peo
ple have forebodings."
Moreover, he said, the Egyptians realize that "Israel's reac
tion will be swift" if there is any breach in the Egyptian com
mitment to the pact under which the Sinai was returned.
Begin said he does not expect the United States to take a
hard-line stance toward Israel in regard to other goals in the
Camp David process, such as autonomy for Palestinians in
the occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip. But, he said, "If at
any time we face pressure, we will press back."
On the question of Palestinian autonomy, Begin said he
would accept a U.S. initiative to get talks moving again if the
proposals are "good and proper." "If not," he siad, "we shall
reject them. But I don't know if there are such proposals."
Asked if Israel might also withdraw from the occupied
Golan Heights, captured from Syria in 1967 and annexed last
December, Begin said there is "no comparison" between
that area and the Sinai.
El Salvador rightists tighten rule
San Salvador, El Salvador — Right-wingers backing Rob
erto d'Aubuisson have consolidated their grip on the Consti
tuent Assembly and are likely to keep an equally tight rein on
the provisional president they pick.
Mario Redaelli, spokesman for d'Aubuisson's Republican
Nationalist Alliance, or ARENA, said: "The assembly is like
the mother of the little boy. It can say yes or no."
D'Aubuisson, an ultra-rightist and cashiered army major
who last fall was an underground figure accused of plotting
to overthrow the government, was elected to run the as
sembly Thursday night.
"El Salvador has triumphed. We have won the ideological

struggle," proclaimed the new speaker, flanked by nine oth
er rightists who fill out the assembly's new directorate. There
wasn't a Christian Democrat in the group, despite pro
claimed U.S. pressure to include them.
El Salvador's new provisional president, who could be
chosen as early as today, may be the kind of moderate the
United States says it would like to see running the nation. But
the power of the presidency relative to the right-dominated
assembly is likely to be small.
The assembly not only will pick the chief executive, but
also has the power to set general elections, and write a new
constitution for El Salvador, which has been torn for 30
months by civil war between left and right.
Asked if the composition of the new leadership meant the
Christian Democrats lost their chance at legislative power
here, party leader Julio Rey Prendes replied: "We never had
it."
U.S. officials including Ambassador Deane Hinton and
House Majority Leader Jim Wright — have said repeatedly
that U.S. aid to El Salvador would flow smoother to a govern
ment including the Christian Democrats.
Polish church, government meet
Warsaw, Poland The heads of Poland's government and
its Roman Catholic Church met for more than two hours
here last night in what was seen as a potentially significant
new effort to ease political tensions in this crisis-torn nation.
The surprise meeting, between party and martial-law chief
Gen. Wojciech Jaruzelski and the Polish Primate,
Archbishop Jozef Glemp, was believed to be only their sec
ond since martial law was declared last December. The first
was in early January and was reportedly inconclusive.
Yesterday's session, which was announced by Polish tele
vision after it was under way, came on the eve of the
primate's scheduled departure for Rome for talks with Pope
John Paul 11.
It also followed by only two weeks Glemp's disclosure that
a lay Catholic social council had prepared a position paper
on the conditions necessary for "social accord." The an
nouncement was seen as an effort by the primate to force the
authorities to substantiate their repeated assertions of a de
sire to seek national agreement.
The churchman and the soldier apparently met in the
same government villa where they and the now-interned
Solidarity leader. Lech Walesa, held an unprecedented
three-way summit last November.
Informed sources said that Glemp had expected to meet
Jaruzelski two weeks ago, but that the session was twice post
poned. As of late last week, the primate had reportedly given
up hope of seeing Jaruzelski before his visit to Rome begin
ning today.

Britain captures South Georgian
London — Taking the military offensive for the first time in its con
frontation with Argentina over the Falkland Islands, Britain announced
last night it had recaptured the remote South Atlantic island of South
Georgia yesterday.
In an assault by a vanguard of the naval task force Britain dispatched
to the South Atlantic 20 days ago, British troops landing by combat heli
copter from a few warships offshore retook the port of Grytviken after a
brief battle with a small Argentine occupation force, British Defense
Minister John Nott said here yesterday night.

forces," Nott said in a statement read to reporters outside 10 Downing

tween the two countries for nearly 150 years.
The British landing came as U.S. Secretary of State Alexander Haig was
still seeking to fashion a negotiated settlement to the crisis after spend
ing the past two weeks shuttling among London, Buenos Aires and
Washington. He presented new U.S. ideas to British Foreign Secretary
Francis Pym in Washington Thursday and Friday and was scheduled to
meet yesterday afternoon with Argentine Foreign Minister Nicanor
Costa Mendez, who arrived in Washington yesterday.
(In Washington, the State Department said that a meeting
scheduled for yesterday afternoon between Haig and Costa
Mendez was postponed at the request of Argentine officials.
The statement added, however, that Haig and Costa Mendez
had talked by telephone during the afternoon and would
discuss the situation again this morning.)
Britain's invading troops reportedly were aided by a dozen
Royal Marine commandos who sneaked onto the island
from a submarine Thursday and reported there were fewer
than 50 Argentine troops defending it.
British combat helicopters began the attack at dawn by fir
ing on Argentine positions in Grytviken and attacking and
badly damaging a surfaced Argentine submarine entering
the harbor, according to British sources. While "a number of
warships" shelled Grytviken, the helicopters began landing
British troops at 4 p.m. London time (11 a.m. EDT), Nott said,
and the Argentine defenders surrendered two hours later.
"Just rejoice at that news and congratulate our forces and
the Marines," Thatcher told reporters as she and Nott re
fused to answer shouted questions about his statement. "Re
joice, rejoice," she said as she turned to walk back into 10
Downing Street with Nott.
Israeli pullout of Sinai finished
Rafah, Egypt — The red, white and black flag of Egypt was
unfurled over the northern and eastern stretches of the Sinai
yesterday for the first time in 15 years, marking the end of
Israel's occupation of the peninsula and the beginning of a
new era in Israeli-Egyptian relations.
In a simple but emotional 30-minute ceremony here, the
Egyptian governor of North Sinai, Youssef Abu Taleb, raised
the flag as a small crowd of local people and federal
dignitaries sang Egypt's national anthem and shouted, "Long
live Egypt, long live Egypt."
"Thanks be to God for the return of this precious part of
our land to mother Egypt," Taleb said in a brief speech. "I
feel that I am not alone. With us are the spirits of the martyrs
and heroes and foremost Anwar Sadat, our late leader who
gave his life for this moment. It was his decision of war and
then his decision of peace that made this moment possible."
Taleb was referring to the slain president's decision to
launch the last war against Israel in October 1973 and his his
toric trip to Jerusalem in November 1977 to make peace with
Israel.
While the flag was being hoisted here in Rafah and in
Sharm el-Sheikh in the far southern Sinai, President Hosni
Mubarak was laying a wreath at Sadat's burial place at the
tomb of the unknown soldier in a Cairo suburb near where
he was assassinated last October by Moslem extremists.
Later, Mubarak participated in a joint Israeli-Egyptian tele
cast, reaffirming once again Egypt's commitment to peace
with Israel. He hailed the Israeli's response to the "historic
and courageous peace initiate" of president Sadat, and said it
expressed "the will of every Egyptian" and had culminated in
peace.
Mubarek gave special thanks to the "historic role" of

former president Jimmy Carter in helping to arrange the
peace treaty between Egypt and Israel.
Begin threatens attacks on PLO
Washington — Israeli Prime Minister Menachem Begin
yesterday refusedto rule out the possibility of future Israeli
attacks against Palestine Liberation Organization encamp
ments in Lebanon if the PLO continues to "shed Jewish
blood."
"If they are quiet on the other side, we shall keep the
peace on our side," Begin said in a televised interview from
Jerusalem. "!f they attack us again, we shall hit them."
Last week's air raids on Palestinian sites near Beirut, Leba
non, were ordered because PLO guerrillas had killed 17 Is
raelis and wounded 250 others since the U.S.-mediated
cease-fire between Israel and the PLO took effect last year,
Begin said in an interview on NBC-TV's "Meet the Press."
"We exercised restraint for over nine months," he said. "But
there are limits."
Begin said his country made "great sacrifices" in returning
the Sinai Peninsula to Egypt, but he denied that the Israeli
people are filled with forebodings about surrendering the
desert region.
"I do not agree with the cynics who say the peace treaty is a
piece of paper," Begin said. "It is not. It is the most serious
commitment. I cannot accept the assumption that our peo
ple have forebodings."
Moreover, he said, the Egyptians realize that "Israel's reac
tion will be swift" if there is any breach in the Egyptian com
mitment to the pact under which the Sinai was returned.
Begin said he does not expect the United States to take a
hard-line stance toward Israel in regard to other goals in the
Camp David process, such as autonomy for Palestinians in
the occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip. But, he said, "If at
any time we face pressure, we will press back."
On the question of Palestinian autonomy, Begin said he
would accept a U.S. initiative to get talks moving again if the
proposals are "good and proper." "If not," he siad, "we shall
reject them. But I don't know if there are such proposals."
Asked if Israel might also withdraw from the occupied
Golan Heights, captured from Syria in 1967 and annexed last
December, Begin said there is "no comparison" between
that area and the Sinai.
El Salvador rightists tighten rule
San Salvador, El Salvador — Right-wingers backing Rob
erto d'Aubuisson have consolidated their grip on the Consti
tuent Assembly and are likely to keep an equally tight rein on
the provisional president they pick.
Mario Redaelli, spokesman for d'Aubuisson's Republican
Nationalist Alliance, or ARENA, said: "The assembly is like
the mother of the little boy. It can say yes or no."
D'Aubuisson, an ultra-rightist and cashiered army major
who last fall was an underground figure accused of plotting
to overthrow the government, was elected to run the as
sembly Thursday night.
"El Salvador has triumphed. We have won the ideological

struggle," proclaimed the new speaker, flanked by nine oth
er rightists who fill out the assembly's new directorate. There
wasn't a Christian Democrat in the group, despite pro
claimed U.S. pressure to include them.
El Salvador's new provisional president, who could be
chosen as early as today, may be the kind of moderate the
United States says it would like to see running the nation. But
the power of the presidency relative to the right-dominated
assembly is likely to be small.
The assembly not only will pick the chief executive, but
also has the power to set general elections, and write a new
constitution for El Salvador, which has been torn for 30
months by civil war between left and right.
Asked if the composition of the new leadership meant the
Christian Democrats lost their chance at legislative power
here, party leader Julio Rey Prendes replied: "We never had
it."
U.S. officials including Ambassador Deane Hinton and
House Majority Leader Jim Wright — have said repeatedly
that U.S. aid to El Salvador would flow smoother to a govern
ment including the Christian Democrats.
Polish church, government meet
Warsaw, Poland The heads of Poland's government and
its Roman Catholic Church met for more than two hours
here last night in what was seen as a potentially significant
new effort to ease political tensions in this crisis-torn nation.
The surprise meeting, between party and martial-law chief
Gen. Wojciech Jaruzelski and the Polish Primate,
Archbishop Jozef Glemp, was believed to be only their sec
ond since martial law was declared last December. The first
was in early January and was reportedly inconclusive.
Yesterday's session, which was announced by Polish tele
vision after it was under way, came on the eve of the
primate's scheduled departure for Rome for talks with Pope
John Paul 11.
It also followed by only two weeks Glemp's disclosure that
a lay Catholic social council had prepared a position paper
on the conditions necessary for "social accord." The an
nouncement was seen as an effort by the primate to force the
authorities to substantiate their repeated assertions of a de
sire to seek national agreement.
The churchman and the soldier apparently met in the
same government villa where they and the now-interned
Solidarity leader. Lech Walesa, held an unprecedented
three-way summit last November.
Informed sources said that Glemp had expected to meet
Jaruzelski two weeks ago, but that the session was twice post
poned. As of late last week, the primate had reportedly given
up hope of seeing Jaruzelski before his visit to Rome begin
ning today.

Britain captures South Georgian
London — Taking the military offensive for the first time in its con
frontation with Argentina over the Falkland Islands, Britain announced
last night it had recaptured the remote South Atlantic island of South
Georgia yesterday.
In an assault by a vanguard of the naval task force Britain dispatched
to the South Atlantic 20 days ago, British troops landing by combat heli
copter from a few warships offshore retook the port of Grytviken after a
brief battle with a small Argentine occupation force, British Defense
Minister John Nott said here yesterday night.
"The Argentine forces offered only limited resistance to British
forces," Nott said in a statement read to reporters outside 10 Downing
Street with Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher at his side. " So far, no Brit
ish casualties have been reported. We have no information on the Ar
gentine casualty position."
By late yesterday night, there was no confirmation from Buenos Aires
of the British claim to have taken the island, but the Argentine govern
ment said earlier in the day that British warships and aircraft had at
tacked the garrison on the island with "intense shelling" and that its
forces were resisting. The ruling military junta in Buenos Aires also re
ported that two British helicopters attacked an Argentine submarine in
the main port of the South Georgia Islands, z dependency of the
Falkland Islands 600 miles to the west.
The military clash, the first for British naval forces since the Suez
hostilities in 1956, came 23 days after Argentine troops seized South
Georgia and the Falklands, which have been the subject of disputes be
tween the two countries for nearly 150 years.
The British landing came as U.S. Secretary of State Alexander Haig was
