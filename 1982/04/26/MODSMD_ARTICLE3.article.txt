Britain captures South Georgian
London â€” Taking the military offensive for the first time in its con
frontation with Argentina over the Falkland Islands, Britain announced
last night it had recaptured the remote South Atlantic island of South
Georgia yesterday.
In an assault by a vanguard of the naval task force Britain dispatched
to the South Atlantic 20 days ago, British troops landing by combat heli
copter from a few warships offshore retook the port of Grytviken after a
brief battle with a small Argentine occupation force, British Defense
Minister John Nott said here yesterday night.
"The Argentine forces offered only limited resistance to British
forces," Nott said in a statement read to reporters outside 10 Downing
Street with Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher at his side. " So far, no Brit
ish casualties have been reported. We have no information on the Ar
gentine casualty position."
By late yesterday night, there was no confirmation from Buenos Aires
of the British claim to have taken the island, but the Argentine govern
ment said earlier in the day that British warships and aircraft had at
tacked the garrison on the island with "intense shelling" and that its
forces were resisting. The ruling military junta in Buenos Aires also re
ported that two British helicopters attacked an Argentine submarine in
the main port of the South Georgia Islands, z dependency of the
Falkland Islands 600 miles to the west.
The military clash, the first for British naval forces since the Suez
hostilities in 1956, came 23 days after Argentine troops seized South
Georgia and the Falklands, which have been the subject of disputes be
tween the two countries for nearly 150 years.
The British landing came as U.S. Secretary of State Alexander Haig was
still seeking to fashion a negotiated settlement to the crisis after spend
ing the past two weeks shuttling among London, Buenos Aires and
Washington. He presented new U.S. ideas to British Foreign Secretary
Francis Pym in Washington Thursday and Friday and was scheduled to
meet yesterday afternoon with Argentine Foreign Minister Nicanor
Costa Mendez, who arrived in Washington yesterday.
