# Sorority rush attracts largest recent turnout
## 
### Kathy Bodovitz Senior staff writer 
Last Wednesday 165 Stanford
women recieved bids from five of the
local sororities, only one of which,
Delta Gamma (DG), is recognized by
the University.
Rush Co-Chairman Andrea Fish
said that more than 250 women
began the rush process, the largest
turnout in the last three years. All the
sororities, with the exception of
Alpha Chi Omega because it had
only 10 members, held rush together.
Because four of the sororities are not
recognized by the University, rush
was held entirely off campus.
The activities began the week of
April 12 with four nights of open
houses. Each woman went to two
open houses, either Monday and
Wednesday or Tuesday and Thurs
day. The open houses were held at
Terman Junior High School on
Arastradero Road.
After the open houses, both the
women and the sororities made in
itial decisions as to their preferences
and based on those, the sororities
sent out invitations to the first set of
parties, of which each woman could
attend four. These parties were all
held atalumnae housesand alumnae
also provided all the transportation
from the Wilbur Hall parking lot to
the open houses and parties.
The second invitational round in
volved the same procedure, but each
woman could attend only three
parties. The third round was based on
the same process of listing prefer
ences and each woman could attend
two parties.
After the preference parties, the
women signed a preference card list
ing up to five sororities. Inter-Sorori
ty Council President Anne Bye said
that if a woman listed all five
sororities on her preference card,
she was guaranteed a place in one of
those sororities.
The next step was bid matching,

when each sorority went through the
bid preferences and placed as many
women as it could in their first
choice. All the sororities had a max
imum quota based on the number of
women who participated in rush. If
each group filled its quota, some
could then take in more women. If
not, women were placed in theirsub
sequent choice. Bye said that this
year about 85 percent of the women
received bids from their first choice.
Outlining the sorority recognition
issue, Diana Conklin, Row Director
and Sorority Rush Advisor, said the
history of sororities at Stanford began
when the University was opened in
112 1891. At that time 559 students were
registered and 20 percent were wom
en. Two sororities were founded that
year and over the following years
eight more were established here.
In 1933 the original restriction on
the number of women admitted to
the University was modified and 1050
women enrolled. This meant that
fewer than one-third of the women
could join sororities. By 1943, as more
women were admitted, fewer than
one-fifth of the women were able to
join sororities.
This situation led to a revolt against
the sorority system. Conklin said
there were sharp differences and
competition between hall women
(those living in dormitories) and
sorority women.
Following rush in 1943 six sorority
and seven hall women jointly sub
mitted a petition to the University
board of trustees requesting Univer
sity intervention in the sorority sys
tem.
The three planks of the petition
were that the dual system of
sororities and dormitories was not in
the best interest of the women stu
dents, that it had caused serious dis
unity among the women students,
and that changes in the rush rules
would not eliminate the fundamen-
tal causes of disunity.
At the April 1944 Board of Trustees
meeting, then University President
Ray Lyman Wilbur said, "Women stu
dents are so tense and tired that their
college work suffers unmistakably."
He noted that the sorority system was
favoring women from preparatory
schools and that many women not
chosen by sororities were leaving
Stanford. After much deliberation,
the board decided to ban the
sororities.
In 1977, after again hearing all sides
involved, the board of trustees voted
to amend the ban and allow women
to reform the sororities and then
petition for recognition. The key to
their recognition, Conklin said, is
being able to show complete local
autonomy in membership selection
and group governance.
Conklin said the procedure for
gaining University recognition is for
her to go over each sorority's na
tional charter and point out anything
which conflicts with local autonomy.
Local autonomy, she said, means that
Stanford women make their own de
cisions without any interference
from anyone outside the University.
So far, Delta Gamma (DG) is the
only sorority that has been able to ac
ceptably adapt its charter. Conklin
said, "The (DG) national was very
flexible. They wanted a recognized
chapter here."
Both Conklin and Bye said that the
problem is convincing the national
chapter to change the rules just for
Stanford. Conklin said that Delta
Sigma Theta, a black sorority has very
few points not resolved and is the
closest to recognition. Bye said all the
groups actively work to resolve the
conflicts during fall and winter quar
ters, but are busy in the spring with
rush.
