# Black Business Students Assoc. conference meets
## Speaker notes need for black economic parity 
### Mike Lanza 
Rep. Parren Mitchell (D-Md.)
warned a Black Business Students As
sociation conference Saturday that
unless blacks gain control over more
American production, especially
products of which blacks are the
chief consumers, they will not reach
either economic or political parity.
Mitchell's keynote speech, which
stressed a need for blacks to attain
economic power and suggested
means by which they might obtain it,
highlighted the "Target for the '80s:
Striking a Balance Between Corpo
rate Careers, Entrepreneurship and
Community Service" conference.
Mitchell pointed out that only 18
of the 435 members of the House of
Representatives are black and no
U.S. Senators are black. And, he
added, "We are nowhere near eco
nomic parity."
Mitchell said that blacks should
strive more to gain economic parity
first and then gain political parity as a
by-product, rather than using politi
cal clout to achieve economic goals.
"Although successful black can
didates receive an overwhelming
proportion of their votes from
blacks," Mitchell said, "a great ma
jority of their campaign funds comes
from whites." In this scenario,
Mitchell added, "it is often difficult
for black politicians to act wholly
consistent with the needs of blacks."

An active member of the House
Committee on Small Business, which
is partly responsible for minority
businessman's interests, Mitchell
sponsored legislation in 1976 which
provides minorities with a mandatory
10 percent of all government con
tracts. He was the first to serve two
consecutive terms as Chairman of the
Black Congressional Caucus. In addi
tion, Mitchell is now one of 11 Dem
ocratic Whips in the House.
Mitchell addressed the conflict
which he said "most talented blacks
inevitably face when they must
choose between working for person
al gain and working for the advance
ment of all blacks.
"There are not enough black busi
nesses around to absorb all this tal
ent," Mitchell observed before the
crowd at Bishop Auditorium, "...
bui give us a shot first. If this doesn't
work, go into the white corporate
world.
"Learn the system, learn it all up
side down ana inside out and then
bring it back to us. If you want to stay,
that's okay, but sena everything you
can back to us."
Mitchell's concluding words were
ones of warning. "The only danger
we have to confront is the danger of
letting our spirits be broken." He
added, "That's the one thing that no
body's been able to do to us."
