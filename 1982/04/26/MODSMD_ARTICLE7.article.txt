## Argentine military backs Galtieri 
### Washington Post 
Buenos Aires, Argentina — Argentina's
military, despite misgivings about Presi
dent Leopoldo Galtieri's management of
the Falkland Islands crisis, is now locked
into a unified stance behind the general's
apparent determination to battle a British
task force before yielding sovereignty, ac
cording to informed sources here.
While some army and Air Force com
manders are reported to be deeply con
cerned about the possible consequences
of a military conflict in the South Atlantic,
the nearness of the British fleet to the is
lands and the lack of a broad civilian move
ment urging moderation have prevented
any conciliatory sentiment from emerging
openly within the military command, mili
tary sources say.
At the same time, the hard-line position
of high Navy commanders and Galtieri's
dramatic assertions of Argentina's control
over the South Atlantic islands has made it
impossible for the military president to
back down without serious loss of prestige.
As a result, Argentine military analysts
say the military will have to suffer a reverse
in an armed conflict with Britain before a
shift in position on the crucial issue of Ar
gentine sovereignty over the islands could
be embraced.

These analysts say the unwieldy and in
flexible nature of the military power struc
ture here means that only a clear failure by
the ruling junta of service chiefs could
prompt a coalition of army and civilian
leaders to force a major shift in position.
Such a move would be likely to prompt a
government crisis in which the power of all
three junta members would be at stake.
"The construction of the military gov
ernment under Galtieri eliminates the pos
sibility of a moderate change," said one in
formed Argentine military analyst. "If
there is a failure, it will mean the downfall
of the entire junta, and there is no process
for handling such a situation."
The rigidity of the command arises from
the roots of political authority under the
military government and the unusual way
in which the islands were seized, analysts
and military sources here ;aid.
Although the position of Galtieri as pres
ident and army commander-in-chief is at
stake, he has had to respond to only a small
circle of associates in managing the de
fense of the islands and determining Ar
gentina's negotiating position.
Retired general Roberto Viola, the pre
vious military president, directed govern
ment policy but had to respond to — and

was eventually removed by — the three
man junta because he was no longer com
mander of the preeminently powerful
army.
Galtieri, however, remained army com
mander-in-chief after taking over as presi
dent last December. As a result, the ag
gressive, 55-year-old general is the most
influential member of the only body for
mally empowered to review his actions as
president.
The major strategic decisions in the
crisis, including the original order for the
April 2 invasion, were approved jointly by
the junta. As a result, the junta is common
ly bound to defend Argentina's sovereign
ty claim, analysts here say.
During the past three weeks, subtle dif
ferences have emerged among the three
armed forces leaders, these analysts and
sources not*.'.
I
Adm. Jorge Anaya, whose service had
the primary role in an invasion it had been
