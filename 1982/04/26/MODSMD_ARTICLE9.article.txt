## National News Council Lack of communication plagues media 
### Rose Chan 
Lack of communication may be at
the root of the media's problems, ac
cording to the chairman of the Na
tional News Council which met-here
last week.

T/iere wouldn't be any
need for ombudsmen
or news councils or
anything else if only
news people would
listen to complaints
and look into them
appraisingly.'

"There wouldn't be any need for
ombudsmen or news councils or
anything else if only news people
would listen to complaints and look
into thern appraisingly," said Nor
man Isaacs, chairman of the Council
and a Hearst visiting professor here.
"If they did that, we would be out
of business," he said. A non-profit,
non-governmental, voluntary or
ganization established in 1973, the
Council is in the businesss of in
vestigating complaints against the
pews media. It provides an alter
native to expensve legal proceed
ings for parties frustrated by prior at
tempts to come to terms with the of
fending news organizations. The
Council also tries to protect news or
ganizations against unfair attacks.
The Council bears all costs for the
investigations and a complaint can
cost upwards of $5000, according to
Isaacs. More than half of the Coun
cil's support comes from founda
tions such as the John and Mary R.
Markle Foundation, and another
quarter comes from media organiza
tions. Corporations such as Alcoa,
Bechtel and Xerox provide 15 per
cent and individuals, 3 percent.
The Council neither has, nor
seeks, power to regulate or impose
penalties.
"All we're trying to do is to per
suade, induce or seduce American
communications into improving its
standards," Isaacs said. The Council
issues decisions and hopes that the
news organizations concerned will

publish or broadcast them.
"That's all we want to do. If we go
beyond that, we're opening up a
door for punitive action against the
press," Isaacs said. "The press has got
to be free."
The Council consists of 10 individ
uals from the public sector, current
ly including Prof. Elie Abel of Stan
ford's communication department
and Lucy Benson, former Under Sec
retary of State. The media is repre
sented by eight individuals, includ
ing Robert Maynard of the Oakland
Tribune and Margo Huston of the
Milwaukee Journal.
For an organization without the
authority to enforce, the Council has
seen remarkable success in its efforts
to effect change, Isaacs said.
"Surprisingly, they listen. It
fascinates me," Isaacs said. "I didn't
realize until a few years ago that ev
ery time we had isssued a finding,
CBS had adopted internal rules cov
ering that particular oversight."

the press. The press has

In another case, the Council is
sued a report criticizing a newspaper
in Louisville, Ky.
"Lo and behold, they put it on
page one," Isaacs said. "On top of
that, the editor wrote a long editorial
on which the headline said, 'We de
served it and we learned our les
son.' "
The Council meets at least four
times a year to consider cases, de
pending on the case load and the ur
gency of issues at hand. The Coun-

cil's professional staff in New York
screens an average of 1000 lettters
each year. The seven cases which
were on this session's agenda were
weeded out of about 100 cases,
Isaacs said.
"We have some things that come
and that we don't think are worthy of
ging through the full, complete
process," Isaacs said. "But we think
people have a point and we try to
serve as intermediaries. We try to get
editors together with the complaint.
Usually something good comes out
of it.
"Some of it is parochial that it has
no national interest. Some of it is just
trivial," he said. He added that peo
ple are often so angry when they
write that they neglect to specify
their charges and to include the

broadcast or publication date of the
offending news item. Complaints
are generally not considered by the
Council beyond 90 days of publica
tion or broadcast.
Not all letters register complaints.
Some inquire about ethical applica
tions.
"We try to give them what we have
found out and how this applies to
their situations," Isaacs explained.
The Council staff's research into sub
jects of major journalistic relevance
are usually published in book or
brochure form. A newsletter called
Excerpts is distributed regularly to
schools of journalism and com
munication.
"What we see here at this meeting
is a tiny tip of the iceberg," Isaacs
said.
