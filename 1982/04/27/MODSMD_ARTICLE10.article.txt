# Do you know... how CAT scanning works?

CAT scanning (the biomedical technique
of computerized tomography) is a special
ized form of general tomography, a tech
nique devised in the early 1930s for visualiz
ing selected planes of a patient's body, in an
attempt to determine the exact nature of a
patient's malady.
CAT scanning produces an image similar to
a cross-sectional slice through the body. The
technology is very much like that of an X-ray
machine but with the added ability to rotate
about the subject "taking pictures" from ev
ery angle.
Simply, an X-ray tube that emits X-rays is
placed on one side of the subject's body and a

detectoi lhat detects X-rays passing through
the body is placed on the other. X-rays are
projected through the subject at every angle
by rotating the X-ray tube and the detector
about the subject. Data (from the "picture" at
each angle) is fed into a computer by the de
tector and processed. With this information
the computer can create cross-sectional im
ages of the body. -' 'ij|
CAT scanning represents a significant im
provement over the X-ray in which all struc
tures lying in the direction of the X-ray beam
are superimposed on each other. What CAT
scanning has succeded in doing is adding a
third dimension to the two dimensional X
™y.
