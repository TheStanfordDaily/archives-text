# Prematurity can cause blindness
## 
### Kristen Christopher 
While medical techniques
have advanced to a point
where babies that weigh only
two pounds can often be
saved, doctors are now looking
for ways to halt a problem that
some of these infants develop:
blindness.
Failure to acquire normal
eyesight can occur because
blood vessels on the surface of
the retina, one of the two main
sources of blood for the retina,
are underdeveloped in pre
mature babies. After birth,
these vessels may develop ab
normally, leading to blindness.
This problem became ap
parent in the early 19405, and
was termed retrolental (behind
the lens) fibroplasia (RLF).
More than a decade later, doc
tors accepted the hypothesis
that RLF was caused by high
levels of oxygen given to pre
mature infants to protect
against possible brain damage.
(Incubators allowing a con
tinuous flow of oxygen were
developed near the end of
World War II.)
Hospitals began to carefully
regulate the percentage of ox
ygen in the incubator at
mosphere, lowering it in an at
tempt to prevent RLF, while si
multaneously assuring that
brain damage did not result.
Consequently, there was a
great decrease in the oc

curence of RLF in the late
19505, and it seemed the solu
tion had been found.
"When they cut back (ox
ygen) to about 40 percent,
(RLF) seemed to disappear,"
Dr. Michael Gaynon, assistant
professor of surgery and op
thamology here, said.
However, since last July,
there has been a rise in the in
cidence of RLF, because doc
tors have begun saving smaller
babies, according to Gaynon.
He said the real problem is pre
maturity, rather than oxygen,
and therefore, doctors are now
calling it retinopathy of pre
maturity, rather than RLF.
There have been infants who
have become blind without
any oxygen supplementation
and, Gaynon said, "now we're
at a point where even cutting
back oxygen to the absolute
minimum to prevent brain
damage, still a certain per
centage will develop this."
Blindness may result, accord
ing to Gaynon, because there is
an area of retina that is
deprived of oxygen to some
degree because the develop
ing blood vessels have not yet
extended into this region. The
process leading to blindness
begins with a proliferation of
new blood vessels on the sur
face of the retina that go in
search of a blood supply.

"If you could create a par
allel to other living things,"
Gaynon said, "you could think
of plants in a drought sending
out little tap roots looking for
water." However, in the pre
mature infant, these blood
vessels never find other
sources of circulation.
It has been postulated,
Gaynon said, that a hormone
known to cause growth of
vessels in other retinal diseases
is produced by the premature
retina.
As the blood vessels in the in
fant grow in the absence of ox
ygen, this tissue may eventually
transform itself into fibrous, or
scar, tissue. "Scar tissue has a
tendency to contract," Gaynon
said, "and as it contracts, it will
act as if there is a pursestring
around the wall of the eye and
it will tend to pull the retina in
toward the center, and as it
does, it will detach the retina at
some point."
Many premature babies go
through some of these stages,
but then the problem will re
gress, or the retina will detach
in such a way that it can be re
paired. "It is the very small ma
jority that ever get to the point
where they truly risk loss of vi
sion," Gaynon said, "but it is
those very small babies (under
approximately two and a half
pounds) who are truly at risk of
this because their vessels have
matured the least."
The problem doctors have
recently been facing is how to
prevent retinopathy of pre
maturity from occuring.
Gaynon said that since they are
aware of the problem now,
they examine the babies very
early in life to determine if
there is a large zone that is void
of vessels or if any abnormal
growth is occuring.
When there appears to be a

problem, doctors here and at
several other hospitals have
begun experimenting with a
treatment used in some other
eye diseases, according to
Gaynon. A freezing probe
freezes the wall of the eye in
the area where there are no ret
inal vessels, thereby stopping
proliferation of new vessels.
Gaynon said this treatment also
seems to reverse any abnormal
changes that had taken place.
It is important to note that
the area of the eye which is
frozen does not normally con
tain blood vessels needed for
vision, and the treatment has
not proved to have any serious
side effects.
Doctors are now working on
determining at which stage to
apply treatment. "Because
most of these kids will get bet
ter on their own, we've got to
try to figure out which are that
small percentage which are
going to go downhill," Gaynon
said. "However, we've gotten a
pretty good feel for that over
the past six months â€” we feel
we know which ones to treat,
but it is still too early to make a
definitive statement."
Since treating premature in
fants with the freezing probe is
still in the experimental stage
(due to the fact that very few
extremely small babies are
born), parents generally de
cide to have doctors begin by
applying the technique to only
one eye, according to Gaynon.
The changes in both eyes are
compared for a period of time,
and the other eye may then be
treated if that appears advan
tageous.
Research is also being done
in an attempt to determine the
chemical composition of the
hormone believed to be re
sponsible for the proliferation
of new blood vessels on the
surface of the retina.
