## Special Report: ASSU Fee Assessment Election Special ASSU election to cost about $3000 
### Kathy Bodovitz Senior staff writer 
The election scheduled for
Wednesday and Thursday this week
will cost the ASSU approximately
$3000, according to Barry (8.J.) Beal,
currently serving as elections com
missioner in the absence of Eric
Laurence.
Beal explained that because the
ASSU must hold two elections in the
spring, a main election and another
one which at least includes a run-off
for senior class president, the associa
tion usually spends about $6000 on
elections every spring.
Beal said these estimates are based
on the cost of the fee assessmemt
election last fall. He said confirmed
cost figures for the two elections this
spring will not be available until after
the election this week.
One major expense is the salaries
of the elections commissioner and
the two members of the Elections

Commission. The commissioner re
ceives $350, Beal said, and each of the
commission members receives $135.
The other labor expense is the $4
per hour that each poll watcher re
ceives, totaling about $850, he said.
Purchase of the ballots and rental
of the electronic scanner used to
count the votes will total about $500,
according to Beal.
He said total advertising costs, in
cluding flyers distributed in dorms,
posters placed around campus, and
ads placed in the Daily will cost ap
proximately $400.
Another major expense is the type
setting and printing of the 2000 elec
tion pamphlets for each of the two
elections, which Beal said will cost
about $450.
Other lesser expenses, he said, in
clude $50 for rented tables used at
the polling places, and an estimated
$150 phone bill for relaying the ballot
totals from the overseas campuses.
