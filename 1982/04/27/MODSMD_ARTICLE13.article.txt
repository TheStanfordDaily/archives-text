# Collection of student activity fees differs at other schools

Stanford's method of determining fee assessments by
a student body vote is an anomaly when compared with
the processes used at UC-Berkeley (Cal), San Jose State,
Brown and Princeton.
Rather than the University's practice of allocating re
fundable fees through a student body vote, these four
schools have formed committees that decide how to
divide mandatory activities fees.
Though students at the four schools do not strongly
support their fee assessment systems, their reaction is
one of general acceptance, according to representatives
of the associated student organizations. "From what we
read in the papers, it is accepted. There have been no
strong objections," said Ken Saxon, chairman of Prince
ton's Undergraduate Student Government.
"The problem is when something controversial comes
up and the students protest," David Heller, a Brown stu
dent council member, explained. "But those cases are
far and few between us."
Brown's method of funding on-campus groups is per
haps the simplest of the four. In an annual election, 25
student council members vote to determine which
groups get what percentage of the student activities fees.
Students at Brown each paid a $47 activities fee last
September that financed the school's student organiza
tions for the entire year. This money then went into the
hands of the council, which appoints a five-member fi

nance committee, headed by the treasurer. The subcom
mittee votes on all proposals under $1000 and makes a
recommendation to the 25-member council on requests
over that amount.
Heller, who acts as the council's informal vice presi
dent, said he thinks Stanford's election system would fail
if implemented at Brown. "It would not work here just
because people would not vote to fund anything,"
hesaid.
Heller noted a Phyllis Schlafly lecture on campus as
an example of student's rejection of Brown's fee
assessment process. "Many people were upset that she
was allowed to speak here for a considerable fee from
their student activities fund/' he explained.
Another Ivy League school, Princeton, also advocates
a method that p!aces the responsibility for the decision
with a committee rather than with the student body.
One-third of Princeton's mandatory activities fee goes to
a 12-member projects board, consisting of four student
government members, one delegate and one appointed
person from each class. The student activites fee was $18
this academic year and will rise to $28 next year.
The Projects Board distributes funds to only "cultural
and educational groups, including club sports that are
not funded by the Athletic Department," according to
Saxon. Organizations wishing to obtain financing submit
a detailed written proposal to the board and then attend
one of its seven monthly meetings to present their cause

orally. Each month the same amount of money is
divided.
This year student activities fees at Princeton totalled
$128,930, with $36,500 of it going to the Projects Board.
The remaining money went to the social, undergraduate
life and academics (course guide) committees as well as
the campus' Coalition of Independant College and Uni
versity Students â€” a national student lobby designed "to
keep students in touch with national events," Saxon said.
He also indicated that the experienced project board
is able to handle the distribution of funds in an efficient
way. "The members of the board know where the mon
ey can do the best good. Regular students don't know
that," he said.
Once a year student groups at Cal can submit an ap
plication for finances to a senate subcommittee for re
view. Then the subcommittee puts forth a recommenda
tion to the senate, which almost always votes for the sub
committee's endorsements. The senate then decides the
needs and value of a certain group and funds it accord
ingly. Groups recieve from "a few hundred dollars to
$6000, with a few of the more prominent groups getting
more," a representative of Berkeley's Student Activities
Office said.
For groups that miss the application deadline, a stu
dent senator can introduce a bill that, if passed, would
fund these organizations. All money for on-campus
group financing comes from a $12.50 mandatory ac

tivities fee paid quarterly by each student and profits
from the Store, the student mall which includes a book
store.
The senate officially can only fund "non-political,
non-religious groups," according to the Student Ac
tivities Office. However, a lawsuit contesting this is pres
ently in the courts.
The Cal student body will vote this week on a bill that
would make all fees optional. "It is almost unanimously
unsupported," according to the Student Activities Of
fice.
San jose State permits groups to obtain funding in
three ways. At registration, students pay a $10 activities
fee to the associated students' general fund. Certain
groups are already in the budget and recieve money
from this fund.
Organizations not in this budget can request financing
from a Special Allocations Project Board. Among others,
directors of Community Affairs, Ethnic Affairs, Student
Services and Sponsored Projects make up the 12-person
board, which also draws money from the general fund.
Finally, a group may be elected funds in a fashion simi
lar to Stanford's. Through the Automatic Funding In
itiative, students vote on the merit of an organization.
The fee assessment is refundable "but people haven't
caught on yet," a representative of the Associated Stu
dents Office said. "Ours are such a petty amount (usually
25 or 50 cents each) that no one cares."
