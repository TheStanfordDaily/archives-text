## Students should elect to vote 
### 
Yes, the recent ASSU election was poorly run.
Yes, the disputes, the recriminations, the
improprieties and the petty squabbles made the
entire process a disillusioning one. But yes, vote
in the fee assessment elections tomorrow and
Thursday.
Groups seeking funding in the electon
provide services and opportunities that make
Stanford more than a series of classroom
lectures. SCOPE, SPA, SACDF, Speakers Bureau
and other groups sponsor many of the speakers
appearing on campus. Thousands of students
participate in and benefit from the efforts of the
Band, the Chapparal and, yes, the Daily. The
Women's Center, the Graduate Students
Association and Club Sports add special
opportunites for the entire community as well as
for the students they affect directly. The
Program Fee, the Academic Organizations

Board (AOB) and the Publications Board
provide funding to scores of groups, services
and publications that would be paralyzed
without fee assessment support. And other
benefits of groups seeking funding could be
listed on and on .. .
These and the other groups listed on the ballot
depend upon and deserve fee assessment
funding. Twenty percent of the student body
must vote on a particular fee assessment for that
group to receive any fee assessment funding:
your vote is crucial. Groups overwhelmingly
supported by voters have not qualified for
funding because not enough students took the
time to vote (this happened to the Program Fee
in the recent election). Don't let the past
election and the ASSU wrangling keep you from
the polls. Vote, on behalf of the groups that
enliven — and in many ways shape — your time
at Stanford.
