# Res Ed's conception Illegitimate

### 
The Draw has again passed this
year. As usual, the fate of a full year's
housing depends on the contents of
that little manilla envelope. Yet, for
all the complaints about housing, the
placement system (the draw, return
ing residence priorities, and wait
lists) receives very little criticism.
There are some real problems gener
ated by the draw. Yet the lottery sys
tem itself appeals to our sense of de-

I'd like to argue that
the Residential
Education concept is
not used well and that

mocracy so effectively that it defends
the rest of the institution and in
sulates it from criticism. I would like
to point out that "fairness" is a matter
of judgment and that the present
placement system is just one among
many that could be used, successfully
and fairly, to determine places in
housing.
The main institutions of the pres
ent system are the draw and the re
turning residence priority. This
means that a student's sophomore
draw (the one at the end of freshman
year) is the critical determinant of
what kind of housing he or she will
get for the next two guaranteed

years. This is because the returning
residence priority, while definitely
assuring some continuity among
houses, also assures that many stu
dents who might like to live in the
row or priority houses never will. It's
great for the people who draw well,
but what about the people whose
draw numbers start approximating
tuition costs?
Unfortunately, the draw treats
poorly housed students no different
ly than others. (By that, I mean stu
dents housed in places they would
rather not be.) Suppose that one of
the goals of the system were to pro
vide everyone the chance to live in
someplace they In that case,
the draw would be an inappropriate
mechanism,for the system as it now
stands makes no provision to give as
many people as possible the chance
to live in one of their higher-rated
choices in housing.
Residential Education is both the
name of the housing office and the
concept that legitimates the return
ing residence priority. Continuity
seems to be the key to making educa
tion an integral part of the housing
experience. This is especially true in
the row and priority houses. Or is it?
Why is continuity so important?
I'd like to argue that the Residen
tial Education concept is not used
well, and that we ought to seriously
consider dumping the returning resi
dence priority in favor of a system
that either rea//y encourages residen
tial education and/or gives everyone
a shot at living in a place they like.
There are roughly three facets to
this criticism of the placement sys
tem. First of all, housing here is two
tiered, varying in quality and thus
also in desirability.
People may argue as to the merits
of living in Lambda Nu as opposed to
558 Mayfield, but not usually ATO vs.
(for example) Stern. Secondly, peo
ple are initially assigned to this two
tiered system of housing in an in
discriminate manner, the luck of the
draw (among ranked preferences)
being the determinant. The next
year, though, there is no provision
made for those who could not get
into a residence that they preferred.
Thirdly, while the returning resi
dence priority assures everyone the
same chance at getting their old
place back, that is only valuable to

those who are living in a place they
like.
The two most disturbing problems
that can be identified are that hous
ing at Stanford is unequal, and that
not everyone even gets to live in the
desirable places. There is not much
the draw can do about the first prob
lem. But giving as many people as
possible the chance to live in row
type housing at some point would be
a goal that would make getting stuck
someplace you don't like that much
easier to bear. This could be im
plemented in any number of ways.
Of course, any system which at
tempts to do this would have to serve
at the expense of the returning resi
dence priority. I am not saying we
should abolish the returning resi
dence priority post-haste. However,
no system is inherently more fair than
any other, and we owe it to ourselves
to at least examine the alternatives to
the present one.
The democratic ethos that per
vades our way of thinking seems to
defend the placement system as it

now stands. Yet this system weighs
heavily against some other important
values, one of them being equality of
experience for all students. Housing
is an important part of Stanford, and
how we get there really needs to be
debated. This would be the perfect
issue for a referendum: people un
derstand the implications and cer
tainly consider it something worth
voting on. Housing ought to be taken
off its pedestal and given a thorough
examination. After all, don't you feel
sorry for those people that have to
spend two years in Stern?
