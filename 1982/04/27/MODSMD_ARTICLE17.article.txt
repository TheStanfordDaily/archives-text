## University shelters aid faculty search for affordable housing 
### 
The letter to The Stanford Daily on faculty housing
written by Graham Sommer, acting assistant professor of
radiology, is incomplete in a number of important re
spects, and makes significant errors in its interpretation
of our policies.
First, Sommer said, "It would appear that the problems
(relating to the affordability of faculty housing) result
from unwillingness of the University to accept any signif
icant sacrifices on behalf of its stated goal of affordable
housing." That assertion neglects the Housing Allow
ance Program, which supplemer ts the annual income of
each new and recently-arrived faculty member by an an
nual amount between $3213 and $8379, depending on
his/her income, if such individual buys a house in the lo
cal area within three years.
This amount mitigates the high cost of real estate here
by a compensation supplement equal to the differential
between costs here and the average cost over the rest of
the country. Payments continue on a declining basis for
seven years, with the homeowner receiving one-seventh
of the initial payment during the last year.
The Stanford Coinvestment Program (COIN), which
Sommer mentions but mischaracterizes, actually shares

the risk of owning a house between the University and
the faculty member. The individual begins by paying
only 5 percent current interest; the remaining interest is
deferred, and made contingent upon increases in the
price of the house. Five percent represents a very sub
stantial discount against current mortgage rates of more
than 16 percent.
The faculty member will pay more only if he or she
benefits proportionately from future appreciation in the
value of the house, and then only up to the maximum
stated interest rate. (The deferred payment need not be
made until the house is sold.) Sommer's dissatisfaction
with this program suggests a belief that the University
should provide up-front discount in mortgage rates, and
then permit the recipient to reap a windfall if the price of
the house escalates.
Our approach to faculty housing has been to make it
affordable as best we can, but to avoid hidden subsidies
to particular individuals on the basis of self-selection or
subjective determination. The HAP and COIN program
benefits are not hidden, and they are available to all
members of the faculty who fall within the appropriate
eligibility criteria. HAP is, in effect an interest subsidy

since this additional salary is intended to help with mort
gage payments. The costs of HAP are allocated in the
University's regular budget process, where they com
pete openly with other University priorities. The COIN
program qualifies as a reasonable investment of Univer
sity endowment funds.
What about Sommer's "obvious guiding principle"
that the University should sell newly-constructed hous
ing at the lowest possible price and that future resale
prices of such housing should be limited by a salary-re
lated index? The question of whether we should include
land value in the price of University-constructed hous
ing has been debated extensively by University officers,
including the deans of Stanford's seven schools, the
provost, and the vice-presidents. We decided to include
land value in setting prices, and to mitigate the conse
quences with HAP, COIN, graduated-payment mort
gages, and if necessary with additional assistance pro
grams for faculty.
The driving force for that decision was not primarily fi
nancial, though putting the value of the land to work for
University purposes such as housing assistance is not an

inconsequential consideration. The real difficulty with
leaving land value out is the later requirement for rigid
price controls to avoid windfalls by first-time buyers.
Such controls would eliminate freedom of choice for
future generations of buyers and sellers.
We prefer not to undertake the social engineering in
volved in linking University salary levels to house prices,
and in the allocation of individual housing units to its fac
ulty. Those would be inevitable consequences of per
manent price control on housing resales.
Dealing with the consequences of the troublesome
imbalance of supply and demand for mid-Peninsula
housing is a formidable task, and my colleagues and I do
not claim to have "solved" the problem. Much thought
has gone into balancing the complex factors involved,
and we have not hesitated to commit substantial Univer
sity financial and land resources. Sommer's claim that
present programs are "half-baked"and "inadequate"
may relieve some frustrations, but rhetoric doesn't help
much with his problem, or with ours.

ing has been debated extensively by University officers,
including the deans of Stanford's seven schools, the
provost, and the vice-presidents. We decided to include
land value in setting prices, and to mitigate the conse
quences with HAP, COIN, graduated-payment mort
gages, and if necessary with additional assistance pro
grams for faculty.
The driving force for that decision was not primarily fi
nancial, though putting the value of the land to work for
University purposes such as housing assistance is not an

inconsequential consideration. The real difficulty with
leaving land value out is the later requirement for rigid
price controls to avoid windfalls by first-time buyers.
Such controls would eliminate freedom of choice for
future generations of buyers and sellers.
We prefer not to undertake the social engineering in
volved in linking University salary levels to house prices,
and in the allocation of individual housing units to its fac
ulty. Those would be inevitable consequences of per
manent price control on housing resales.
Dealing with the consequences of the troublesome
imbalance of supply and demand for mid-Peninsula
housing is a formidable task, and my colleagues and I do
not claim to have "solved" the problem. Much thought
has gone into balancing the complex factors involved,
and we have not hesitated to commit substantial Univer
sity financial and land resources. Sommer's claim that
present programs are "half-baked"and "inadequate"
may relieve some frustrations, but rhetoric doesn't help
much with his problem, or with ours.
