## Economic sanctions may be only alternative for Falklands 
### 
Anticipating the failure of the so
called shuttle talks, the Argentines
are seeking support for their occupa
tion of the Falklands from the Or
ganization of American States (OAS).
That they will receive economic,
diplomatic or military sanctions
against Great Britain seems unlikely,
and would be against the spirit of the
Rio Treaty of 1947, which clearly pro
vides for defense. Argentina, for all
her attempts to point up British ag
gression, was the originator of the
Falklands crisis.
Nevertheless, the convening of the
OAS will prove an embarassment to
the Reagan administration. The Unit
ed States, ironically, will find itself in
a position similar to one in which
Great Britain has been placed in the
past. This similarity of experience has
not markedly increased British sym
pathy for the American president,
however.
A recent cartoon in the Daily Mail
of London shows President Ronald
Reagan dressed as a gun-toting cow
boy, crying that "a man's gotta do
what a man's gotta do," and then
burying his head in the sand.
It is true that the United States has
been slow to grasp the emotional in
volvement of both Britain and Argen
tina in the dispute. The Falklands
crisis at first provoked little more
than a wave of amusement; shades of
Queen Victoria, Nelson and
Trafalgar, Gilbert and Sullivan were
invoked, and jokes about British
sheep abounded. All very amusing.
But there is now a sinister move
toward the other extreme. One pow

erful national newspaper is calling
for arms for Britain, as confidence in
Haig's attempts at diplomacy wavers.
There may be a middle course, how
ever; the possibility of onomic
sanction remains an alternative.
The confidence of the United
States in this form of economic war
fare was shaken by its failure during
the hostage crisis. It is a difficult
weapon to use; international
bankers are easily driven away, and
nobody seeks to risk their country's
role in profitable world finance. Nev
ertheless, Argentina is particularly
vulnerable economically, with un
employment at 13 percent, inflation
at 147 percent, and a highly unstable
government. If she continues to
maintain advantages she has gained
by military aggression, she may prove
amenable to this form of coercion
where diplomacy has failed.
Negotiations must continue while
there is any remaining hope of agree
ment. But if war is to be avoided the
United States may yet have to con
sider the uncomfortable possibility
of economic sanction.

A closer look-SEE
In response to the Daily's surpris
ing decision to not recommend Stan
ford for Environmental Education's
one-quarter fee assessment, we
would like to comment on the Daily's
stated "concerns."
One was that not enough students

are affected by SEE activities, al
though the question of attendance
was never discussed during the in
terview. In fact, nearly 2000 people
have attended SEE's 25 programs this
year. Though we plan to do even bet
ter next year, we feel this is an im
pressive record for a new organiza
tion, particularly since many of SEE's
programs are deliberately residence
oriented. SEE has also brought its
share of "big names" such as David
Brower, Denis Hayes, and Lester
Brown to campus, and we are already
planning appearances by energy ex
pert Amory Lovins and EPA chief
Anne Gorsuch for next year.
The other was that SEE's budget
proposal did not indicate a "convinc
ing need" for fee assessment money,
apparently because of our success in
raising matching funds from outside
sources this year. The reality is that
without fee assessment income to
provide seed money, such fundrais
ing is extremely difficult, and SEE's
programming will have to be
drastically curtailed.
We feel that the Daily's reluctance
to endorse SEE is not based on sub
stantive criticism, but rather an un
willingness to damage their credibili
ty by approving every group on the
ballot. We hope the Stanford com
munity will realize this and continue
to support environmental education
by voting yes for SEE.

Different counsel
As Finance Committee chair I was
surprised by the Daily's failure to
make a positive endorsement of the
Legal Counseling Office fee
assessment, especially since a
positive endorsement has been the
rule of the past.
When a legal problem comes up in
your life it is indeed "a dark and
stormy night"(Da//y, April 26). These
legal problems are not confined to
sign-stealing. They include serious
car and bike accidents, mechanical
malpractice, consumer problems of
all types, family-law problems, wills
and inheritances, buying a house and
a multitude of legal problems of ev
ery description. These problems are
perplexing, and usually demand im
mediate attention to find out how to
proceed.
We at the ASSU who have the re
sponsibility for sponsoring student
services believe strongly that the Le
gal Counseling service more than jus
tifies its cost. At least 8 percent of
the student body each year uses the
service and user response to the ser
vice is overwhelmingly favorable.
Furthermore, during the last election
the Legal Counseling Office received
the lowest number of no votes and
had the fewest number of refunds.
Similar service is not available any
where else at this price.
