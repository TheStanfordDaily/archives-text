# No special fall fee elections to be held

Fee assessment elections will not be held again
next fall, even if some groups fail to attain the re
quired 20 percent voter turnout in the upcoming
election, Associate Dean of Students Thomas
Massey said Friday in a letter to ASSU Senate Chair
Dave Phelps.
An organization seeking a fee assessment must
have 20 percent of the student body vote on it, in
addition to receiving a majority of the votes cast, in
order to attain an assessment.
Last spring, a majority of the 17 groups on the
ballot failed to pass, largely because of a low voter
turnout. However, the groups were still able to
schedule a special election in the fall in which all of
the assessments passed. In his letter to Phelps,

Massey said that the University would no longer be
responsible for the collection of fees assessed by
such a special election.
The University's decision not to permit another
election puts additional pressure on groups seek
ing assessments to encourage students to vote so
that the minimum turnout necessary to validate
the election is attained.
Bambi Markel, a student member of Stanford
Arms Control and Disarmament Forum (SACDF),
said she was very worried that the groups on the
ballot would not receive the required percentage
of voters because the assessment election is not
being held concurrently with the election for
ASSU Senate and the Council of Presidents.
The assessment election is scheduled for tomor

row and Thursday, instead of April 14-15 with the
senate elections as originally planned, because
Elections Commissioner Eric Laurence failed to ad
vertise the election by the date required by the
constitution.
However, the election delay did give SACDF,
Students United for Rape Elimination (SURE), and
the Glee Club the additional time needed to col
lect the number of signatures required for a group
to be placed on the ballot.
Altogether, 18 groups are hoping to get out the
vote tomorrow and Thursday so that their
assessments will be passed. The total is slightly
higher than usual, according to Phelps. There were
15 groups on the ballot last fall, 17 last spring, and
15 in the spring of 1980.
