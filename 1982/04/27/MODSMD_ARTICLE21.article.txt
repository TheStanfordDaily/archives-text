# Court proceedings 'moot' point

### Lauren Saunders 
"All risel Oh yay, oh yay, oh yay! The Su
preme Court of the United States is now in
session."
The audience jumped immediately to its
feet, startled out of sunbaked languor by
the booming voice.
Sunbaked? In Washington, D.C.? No,
this "Supreme Court" held session in the
Law School's Kresge Auditorium, hearing
the final arguments of the 30th Annual
Marion Rice Kirkwood Moot Court Com
petition.
Friday's event was the culmination of an
annual competition here in which second
and third-year law students team up to
argue before a panel of judges sitting as
the Supreme Court of the United States.
Wilfred 112 einburg, chief judge of the Unit
ed States Court of Appeals for the Second
Circuit, Judge Damon Keith of the Sixth
Circuit, and Justice Frank Richardson of
the California Supreme Court judged this
year's event.
The student finalists, selected from a
field of 56 entrants, were Jonathan Rowe
and Alan Sparer, who argued for petitioner
Ellis Burgh Daniels, and Lee Bendekgey
and Richard Mendelson, representing the
United States government.
The case, "Daniels v. United States," was
designed by the Moot Court Board, a
group of eight law students elected by the
participants last Spring and advised by
Nancy Millich and Jack Friedenthal of the
Law School. The Board had been meeting
since the fall.
Chosen to be current, controversial and
to involve an unsettled area of law, the
case was "completely out of our imagina
tion," said Richter. It concerned an Ameri
can reporter, Daniels, who published a
magazine article containing top secret de
fense information. The question before
the Court was whether evidence obtained
by a wiretap of Daniels's home phone
should be admitted in the trial of Daniels
for bribery of a Pentagon official.

Daniels objected that the introduction
of this evidence would violate his rights
under the Foreign Intelligence Sur
veillance Act of 1978, an actual law passed
by Congress to regulate wiretapping in
foreign intelligence cases.
In order to reach the final round of oral
arguments, the students had to write a
brief for one side of the case, determined
by a coin flip, and then argue both sides in
a series of preliminary rounds. In the final
round, Rowe and Sparer were awarded
Best Brief, Mendelson was judged to have
presented the Best Oral Argument, and
Bendekgey and Mendelson won Best
Team. The judges selected the winners on
the basis of their advocacy skills, and not
on the merits of the case.
"We couldn't have had four more
superlative arguments," said Scott Richter,
a third-year law student and the coordi
nator of the Moot Court Board, which put
on the competition. Feinberg agreed that
"the participants were uniformly excellent
(and) the competiton was exceedingly
close."
"The complexity of the problem made it
consistently rewarding," said Rowe. The
students had been working intensively on
the case since January, and by the final
round they had already argued it five
times. But "there were so many different
approaches and possibilities for develop
ing arguments," said Sparer, that they did
not tire of the issue.
However, this complexity was also a
drawback, and Rowe commented, "I
wouldn't do it again ... It took a tremen
dous amount of time."
"My social life has been shot," agreed
Bendekgey.
With only 15 minutes each to present
their cases, the finalists had to be exceed
ingly well-prepared and knowledgable of
all the nuances of a very complex case. "At
any moment a judge can stop and ask a
question ... totally out in left field," said
Richter.

Bendekgey compared the experience to
"Roman gladiator games," and Rowe
descirbed it as "Sunday football for in
tellectuals ... a spectacle of people being
humiliated." All seemed to agree with
Mendelson, however, who was "delighted
by the judges and the quality of the ques
tions."
Although Rowe thought the experience
was "unpleasant," the others seemed to
enjoy the performing aspects of arguing in
front of the judges. Bendekgey, a future
corporate lawyer, originally entered the
competition because it was "the closest
thing to theater ... very much like doing
improvisations."
What did they get out of the experience?
"In law school, the professors do the talk
ing and the students listen ... (the com
petiton gave me) the opportunity to talk
... one on one with the judges," said
Sparer, who will be a trial lawyer in San
Francisco next year.
Bendekgey said he realized "the extent
to which 'lawyers are hired guns' can be
right. Switching back and forth (during the
preliminary arguments) promotes this at
titude ... It has taught me not to distance
myself too much from the goals of my
client."
The finalists were not the only ones who
benefited from the competition. Richter
said that the Moot Court Board "has been
my life this year. I enjoyed the teaching
aspect... (and) I learned more about brief
writing as a grader" than as a competi
tioner. All eight members of the Board had
been in the competition in the past. In ad
dition to designing the case and judging
the briefs in the preliminary rounds, the
Board was also available to the entrants for
help in refining their arguments. Men
delson praised the Board as "very en
couraging and helpful ... No one got
thrown (by the judges' questions)."
"All risel Oh yay, oh yay, oh yay! The Su

to which 'lawyers are hired guns' can be
right. Switching back and forth (during the
preliminary arguments) promotes this at
titude ... It has taught me not to distance
myself too much from the goals of my
client."
The finalists were not the only ones who
benefited from the competition. Richter
said that the Moot Court Board "has been
my life this year. I enjoyed the teaching
aspect... (and) I learned more about brief
writing as a grader" than as a competi
tioner. All eight members of the Board had
been in the competition in the past. In ad
dition to designing the case and judging
the briefs in the preliminary rounds, the
Board was also available to the entrants for
help in refining their arguments. Men
delson praised the Board as "very en
couraging and helpful ... No one got
thrown (by the judges' questions)."
"All risel Oh yay, oh yay, oh yay! The Su
preme Court of the United States is now in
session."
The audience jumped immediately to its
feet, startled out of sunbaked languor by
the booming voice.
Sunbaked? In Washington, D.C.? No,
this "Supreme Court" held session in the
Law School's Kresge Auditorium, hearing
the final arguments of the 30th Annual
Marion Rice Kirkwood Moot Court Com
petition.
Friday's event was the culmination of an
annual competition here in which second
and third-year law students team up to
argue before a panel of judges sitting as
the Supreme Court of the United States.
Wilfred 112 einburg, chief judge of the Unit
ed States Court of Appeals for the Second
Circuit, Judge Damon Keith of the Sixth
Circuit, and Justice Frank Richardson of
the California Supreme Court judged this
year's event.
The student finalists, selected from a
field of 56 entrants, were Jonathan Rowe
and Alan Sparer, who argued for petitioner
Ellis Burgh Daniels, and Lee Bendekgey
and Richard Mendelson, representing the
United States government.
The case, "Daniels v. United States," was
designed by the Moot Court Board, a
group of eight law students elected by the
participants last Spring and advised by
Nancy Millich and Jack Friedenthal of the
Law School. The Board had been meeting
since the fall.
Chosen to be current, controversial and
to involve an unsettled area of law, the
case was "completely out of our imagina
tion," said Richter. It concerned an Ameri
can reporter, Daniels, who published a
magazine article containing top secret de
fense information. The question before
the Court was whether evidence obtained
by a wiretap of Daniels's home phone
should be admitted in the trial of Daniels
for bribery of a Pentagon official.

Daniels objected that the introduction
of this evidence would violate his rights
under the Foreign Intelligence Sur
veillance Act of 1978, an actual law passed
by Congress to regulate wiretapping in
foreign intelligence cases.
In order to reach the final round of oral
arguments, the students had to write a
brief for one side of the case, determined
by a coin flip, and then argue both sides in
a series of preliminary rounds. In the final
round, Rowe and Sparer were awarded
Best Brief, Mendelson was judged to have
presented the Best Oral Argument, and
Bendekgey and Mendelson won Best
Team. The judges selected the winners on
the basis of their advocacy skills, and not
on the merits of the case.
"We couldn't have had four more
superlative arguments," said Scott Richter,
a third-year law student and the coordi
nator of the Moot Court Board, which put
on the competition. Feinberg agreed that
"the participants were uniformly excellent
(and) the competiton was exceedingly
close."
"The complexity of the problem made it
consistently rewarding," said Rowe. The
students had been working intensively on
the case since January, and by the final
round they had already argued it five
times. But "there were so many different
approaches and possibilities for develop
ing arguments," said Sparer, that they did
not tire of the issue.
However, this complexity was also a
drawback, and Rowe commented, "I
wouldn't do it again ... It took a tremen
dous amount of time."
"My social life has been shot," agreed
Bendekgey.
With only 15 minutes each to present
their cases, the finalists had to be exceed
ingly well-prepared and knowledgable of
all the nuances of a very complex case. "At
any moment a judge can stop and ask a
question ... totally out in left field," said
Richter.

Bendekgey compared the experience to
"Roman gladiator games," and Rowe
descirbed it as "Sunday football for in
tellectuals ... a spectacle of people being
humiliated." All seemed to agree with
Mendelson, however, who was "delighted
by the judges and the quality of the ques
tions."
Although Rowe thought the experience
was "unpleasant," the others seemed to
enjoy the performing aspects of arguing in
front of the judges. Bendekgey, a future
corporate lawyer, originally entered the
competition because it was "the closest
thing to theater ... very much like doing
improvisations."
What did they get out of the experience?
"In law school, the professors do the talk
ing and the students listen ... (the com
petiton gave me) the opportunity to talk
... one on one with the judges," said
Sparer, who will be a trial lawyer in San
Francisco next year.
Bendekgey said he realized "the extent
to which 'lawyers are hired guns' can be
right. Switching back and forth (during the
preliminary arguments) promotes this at
titude ... It has taught me not to distance
myself too much from the goals of my
