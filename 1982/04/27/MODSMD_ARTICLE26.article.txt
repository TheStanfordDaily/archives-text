## 'Victor Victoria': fantasies of the wayward director 
### Steve Vineberg Victor Victoria 
I found the genprally laudatory reviews for
Victor Victoria almost as bewildering as the
gpod notices Blake Edwards received for his
film, 5.0.8. Are there really critics who
consider Victor Victoria a great musical com
edy? Though it's not sour, self-serving and
objectionable like 5.0.8. — you don't feel
Unclean when you walk out of the theater —
it certainly doesn't have much going for it.
, • The idea is tantalizing: in mid-'3os Paris, a
fcay nightclub singer out of a job teams up
Kith a starving soprano and turns her into a
Mar by passing her off as a female im
personator (hence the title). One thinks of
ficrprie Like It Hot and La Cage aux Folles and
iZabaret, and the romantic twist — the hero
jne, pretending to be her gay manager's lov
er; falls in love with a straight club owner
who's being backed by Chicago mobsters —
"is potentially Shakespearean. But apart from
a wonderful performance from Robert Pres
ton in the role of Toddy, the homosexual,
and the odd imaginatively staged gag, a ter
rific idea is about all Edwards offers us.
I Jhe essential problem with Victor Victora
is its leading lady, Julie Andrews. Edwards
has such an inflated idea of what Andrews
can do — husband and wife off-screen, they
have practically become partners in the mov
ies: this is the fifth time they have worked to
gether — that he apparently thought noth
ing of handing her a role that requires not
only crack comic timing (which she has nev
er demonstrated in any film) but also an an
drogynous sexiness.
Edwards must do a lot of fantasizing when
he watches his own pictures: Andrews was

pathetically unconvincing as the Mata Hari
charcter in Darling Lili, and the scene in
5.0.8. in which she bared her breasts was so
embarrassing that I nearly looked away (part
ly because it was painful to watch Edwards
debasing his wife in exactly the same way the
Richard Mulligan character was debasing his
in the film). Or maybe Victor Victoria is Ed
wards' attempt to make amends to her after
5.0.8. — by pretending she can be sexy on
screen.
In either case, the casting backfires horri
bly: though Andrews looks pretty in Depres
sion tatters in the early scenes (just as she did
in '20s clothes in Thoroughly Modern Mil
lie), she looks so cherubically boyish in drag
that her scenes in bed with James Garner,
who plays the club owner, King Marchand,
make one wince. And her musical numbers,
which should be jazzy and sophisticated, are
like those awful scenes in '30s and '40s musi
cals in which opera stars condescended to
perform pop. (It must be said, in all fairness,
that Andrews receives no assistance fromthe
songwriters, Henry Mancini and Leslie
Bricusse, and that Paddy Stone has choreo
graphed the songs so ineptly that they look
cluttered and shapeless.) |
The script, which Blake Edwards wrote
himself, is very convoluted, and most of it is
based on a faulty thesis. Toddy sells Victoria
to the best agent in Paris, a close friend of his,
as a female impersonator, but the response
to her singing is so sensational that one won
ders why she needs to perpetrate such an
elaborate hoax at all. Furthermore, if the
agent is such a good pal of Toddy's, why
doesn't he get Toddy a job? He seems to be a
much more talented performer than Victoria

is — but perhaps that's just because Preston
puts over his numbers with such vaudevillian
assurance. (He even tones Andrews up in a
duet that is easily the film's musical high
light.)
Even Edwards' fabled slapstick gifts desert
him here — there's an extended Feydeau bit
> involving characters stealing in and out of
hotel suites that appears to have been played
at the wrong speed, and the leftovers from
his Pink Panther pictures (with an actor
named Sherloque Tanney as a misbegotten
Paris sleuth) are as exhausted as they are mis
placed. He has so little sense of the period in
which he's set the movie that he has Victoria
deliver a lecture about sex roles that couldn't
possibly have predated Kate Millett, and the
dialogue contains occasional anachronistic
references to "relating" and "segues."
Besides Robert Preston, who makes sec
ond-rate lines sound first-rate (as he did in
5.0.8.), some funny deadpan comedy by
Graham Stark as a waiter, and the good-na
tured presence of Alex Karras as Marchand's
bodyguard, Victor Victoria is not very well
acted. Lesley Ann Warren may be even more
ludicrously miscast than Julie Andrews: as
Marchand's dumb sexpot mistress Norma,
she tries for a melange of Jean Harlow in Din
ner at Eight (a popular choice these days),
Jean Hagen in Singin' in the Rain and Vivian
Blaine in Guys and Dolls, and the results are
fairly appalling. And James Garner is so pas
sive that he's practically nonexistent. Watch
ing his sceneswith Julie Andrews, you keep
recasting the movie in your mind; if Barbra
Streisand and Burt Reynolds had played
these roles, the picture might have had a
chance.
