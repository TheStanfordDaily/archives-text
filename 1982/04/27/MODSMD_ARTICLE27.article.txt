# Atlantic sheds some light on jazz's 'mystery man'
## 
### Ted Gioia Requiem The Lennie Tristano Quartet 
Lennie Tristano
Atlantic Records
Although nearly four years have elapsed since pianist
Lennie Tristano passed away, it may be several decades
before critics reach any consensus about his place in jazz
history. To some, Tristano was a genius who had created
;music of the greatest sophistication and artistic beauty;
toothers he was simply a manipulative and unscrupulous
;man who doctored the tapes of his performances in or
der to make people believe he could play faster and
cleaner than other musicians.
If Tristano's talent and integrity can be called into
question, few can doubt his influence. He held sway over
■many of the most gifted musicians in jazz; so much so,
that many saw him more as a guru than as a musician,
Tristano was perhaps most famous for his tutelage of Lee
Konitz and Warne Marsh, two brilliant saxophonists who
were instrumental in developing the "cool" school of
jazz. But among other talented exponents ot the Tristano
tradition we must include Connie Crothers, Sal Mosca,
Billy Bauer, Peter Ind, Arnold Fishkin, Bob Wilber, and
Bud Freeman — the latter two coming to Tristano after
already being acknowledged as seasoned professional
musicians. Also, it is not hard to hear Tristano's indirect
influence on individuals such as Bill Evans, Dave
Brubeck, and Gerry Mulligan.
Yet in evaluating Tristano's own abilities as a musician,
we run into serius difficulties. The most serious is the fact
that he made virtually no recordings during the last two
decades of his life. The scattered tapes that have surfaced
(available on the Inner City disc Decent into the
Maelstrom) are frenzied attacks on the keyboard that

bear little resemblance to the precise and meticulously
crafted albums of the mid-'sos. The less than perfect rec
ording quality of trese cuts only adds to the confusion.
As if this were not enough, the potential Tristano ad
mirer has long been faced with almost insuperable dif
ficulties in tracking down the earlier recordings of this
enigmatic figure. The Capitol sessions with Konitz and
Marsh, perhaps the most creative sessions ever recorded
in a "cool" idiom, are out of print; the Prestige sessions,
also with Konitz and Marsh, were unavailable until 1979;

Was he a genius of sophistication
and artistic beauty or an
unscrupulous man who doctored
his performance tapes?

while the more mature efforts released by Atlantic in the
'50s were until recently commanding high prices in spe
cialty record stores.
Not only has Atlantic alleviated this problem with the
release of the double album Requiem — which com
prises the two albums originally released as Lenni'e
Tristano and the New Tristano — but they have also gone
into their vaults and come up with another double
album of previously unreleased material.
This second album, The Lennie Tristano Quartet, may
be the best available record of Tristano's unique talent.
The four sides, recorded live at the Sing Song Room of
the Confucius Restaurant in New York in 1955, have re
markable sound clarity when one considers the primitive
nature of on-site recording during those days. But more

importantly they give the listener a chance to hear
Tristano take long, elegant solos in what must have been
a comfortable setting.
Here we have several striking examples of beautifully
sustained solos with the intricate Baroque twists and
turns that were characteristic of Tristano's music. Indeed
the similarity between bebop and the melodic lines of
Bach, which was implicit in the work of Parker and
Powell, is brought to the fore in these sides. Tristano and
Konitz craft long drawn out phrases which bubble over
bar lines and slip under down beats. Sometimes the con
trapuntal possibilities of these melodic lines are made
manifest when Tristano offers a counter-melcJy to
Konitz's lead line, rather than simply comp with chords.
Also striking is the rhythmic subtlety of Tristano's mu
sic, which looks forward to the early Village Vanguard
sessions of Bill Evans. On the version of "There Will Nev
er Be Another You" that adorns the live album, Tristano
uses rhythmic displacements of the chords which were
far beyond what other jazz musicians were doing in the
early '50s. The last four bars of this solo contain a chordal
passage so radically syncopated that one admires the
other musicians in the group for not losing their places.
In the light of these subtle displays of pianism, one is
tempted to overlook the fine performance by the sax
ophonist Konitz. When these recordings were made,
Konitz, then in his mid 20s, was already a celebrated mu
sician who had in many ways gained greater recognition
than his mentor. Here the strong influence that Tristano
had on him is seen when their solos are put side by side.
When the spotlight shifts from Lennie to Lee it is almost
as if the same solo is continuing, but on a different instru
ment.
The other album Requiem contains the famous tracks
which Tristano altered in the studio, supposedly because
he couldn't play them live. I am more inclined to believe

Tristano's view that the tapes were altered in order to get
the rhythms together in the way he desired. Certainly
Tristano's technique on these cuts is no different than
that on the live date, and rather than being technical tour
de forces, these cuts are purely musical in the appeals
they make to the listener. Ironically, these pieces are
among the least enjoyable of the numbers on the rec
ord; one fancies that the original, slower versions might
have been more artistically satisfying.

Few can doubt Tristano's
influence on many of the most
gifted musicians in jazz. Many
thought of him more as a guru
than a musician.

On the whole, however, there is plenty to satisfy the
jazz fan on Requiem. "You Go To My Head" and "All
The Things You Are" are rather fine examples of the
playing of both Tristano and Konitz. Konitz in particular
seems to be inspired by the latter of these two tunes. He
has recorded the Jerome Kern standard a number of
times, and has repeatedly achieved some of his most
memorable performances with it.
These two albums should spark a greater appreciation
of Tristano. One suspects that some recordings, whether
amateur or professional, were made of Tristano during
the last years of his life. These would be significant addi
tions to the small discography of this celebrated musi
cian. As it is, the Atlantic reissues fili what was until re
cently an enormous void.

Yet in evaluating Tristano's own abilities as a musician,
we run into serius difficulties. The most serious is the fact
that he made virtually no recordings during the last two
decades of his life. The scattered tapes that have surfaced
(available on the Inner City disc Decent into the
Maelstrom) are frenzied attacks on the keyboard that

bear little resemblance to the precise and meticulously
crafted albums of the mid-'sos. The less than perfect rec
ording quality of trese cuts only adds to the confusion.
As if this were not enough, the potential Tristano ad
mirer has long been faced with almost insuperable dif
ficulties in tracking down the earlier recordings of this
enigmatic figure. The Capitol sessions with Konitz and
Marsh, perhaps the most creative sessions ever recorded
in a "cool" idiom, are out of print; the Prestige sessions,
also with Konitz and Marsh, were unavailable until 1979;

Was he a genius of sophistication
and artistic beauty or an
unscrupulous man who doctored
his performance tapes?

while the more mature efforts released by Atlantic in the
'50s were until recently commanding high prices in spe
cialty record stores.
Not only has Atlantic alleviated this problem with the
release of the double album Requiem — which com
prises the two albums originally released as Lenni'e
Tristano and the New Tristano — but they have also gone
into their vaults and come up with another double
album of previously unreleased material.
This second album, The Lennie Tristano Quartet, may
be the best available record of Tristano's unique talent.
The four sides, recorded live at the Sing Song Room of
the Confucius Restaurant in New York in 1955, have re
markable sound clarity when one considers the primitive
nature of on-site recording during those days. But more

importantly they give the listener a chance to hear
Tristano take long, elegant solos in what must have been
a comfortable setting.
Here we have several striking examples of beautifully
sustained solos with the intricate Baroque twists and
turns that were characteristic of Tristano's music. Indeed
the similarity between bebop and the melodic lines of
Bach, which was implicit in the work of Parker and
Powell, is brought to the fore in these sides. Tristano and
Konitz craft long drawn out phrases which bubble over
bar lines and slip under down beats. Sometimes the con
trapuntal possibilities of these melodic lines are made
manifest when Tristano offers a counter-melcJy to
Konitz's lead line, rather than simply comp with chords.
Also striking is the rhythmic subtlety of Tristano's mu
sic, which looks forward to the early Village Vanguard
sessions of Bill Evans. On the version of "There Will Nev
er Be Another You" that adorns the live album, Tristano
uses rhythmic displacements of the chords which were
far beyond what other jazz musicians were doing in the
early '50s. The last four bars of this solo contain a chordal
passage so radically syncopated that one admires the
other musicians in the group for not losing their places.
In the light of these subtle displays of pianism, one is
tempted to overlook the fine performance by the sax
ophonist Konitz. When these recordings were made,
Konitz, then in his mid 20s, was already a celebrated mu
sician who had in many ways gained greater recognition
than his mentor. Here the strong influence that Tristano
had on him is seen when their solos are put side by side.
When the spotlight shifts from Lennie to Lee it is almost
as if the same solo is continuing, but on a different instru
ment.
The other album Requiem contains the famous tracks
which Tristano altered in the studio, supposedly because
he couldn't play them live. I am more inclined to believe

Tristano's view that the tapes were altered in order to get
the rhythms together in the way he desired. Certainly
Tristano's technique on these cuts is no different than
that on the live date, and rather than being technical tour
de forces, these cuts are purely musical in the appeals
they make to the listener. Ironically, these pieces are
among the least enjoyable of the numbers on the rec
ord; one fancies that the original, slower versions might
have been more artistically satisfying.

Few can doubt Tristano's
influence on many of the most
gifted musicians in jazz. Many
thought of him more as a guru
than a musician.

On the whole, however, there is plenty to satisfy the
jazz fan on Requiem. "You Go To My Head" and "All
The Things You Are" are rather fine examples of the
playing of both Tristano and Konitz. Konitz in particular
seems to be inspired by the latter of these two tunes. He
has recorded the Jerome Kern standard a number of
times, and has repeatedly achieved some of his most
memorable performances with it.
These two albums should spark a greater appreciation
of Tristano. One suspects that some recordings, whether
amateur or professional, were made of Tristano during
the last years of his life. These would be significant addi
tions to the small discography of this celebrated musi
cian. As it is, the Atlantic reissues fili what was until re
cently an enormous void.
Lennie Tristano
Atlantic Records
Although nearly four years have elapsed since pianist
Lennie Tristano passed away, it may be several decades
before critics reach any consensus about his place in jazz
history. To some, Tristano was a genius who had created
;music of the greatest sophistication and artistic beauty;
toothers he was simply a manipulative and unscrupulous
;man who doctored the tapes of his performances in or
der to make people believe he could play faster and
cleaner than other musicians.
If Tristano's talent and integrity can be called into
question, few can doubt his influence. He held sway over
■many of the most gifted musicians in jazz; so much so,
that many saw him more as a guru than as a musician,
Tristano was perhaps most famous for his tutelage of Lee
Konitz and Warne Marsh, two brilliant saxophonists who
were instrumental in developing the "cool" school of
jazz. But among other talented exponents ot the Tristano
tradition we must include Connie Crothers, Sal Mosca,
Billy Bauer, Peter Ind, Arnold Fishkin, Bob Wilber, and
Bud Freeman — the latter two coming to Tristano after
already being acknowledged as seasoned professional
musicians. Also, it is not hard to hear Tristano's indirect
influence on individuals such as Bill Evans, Dave
Brubeck, and Gerry Mulligan.
Yet in evaluating Tristano's own abilities as a musician,
we run into serius difficulties. The most serious is the fact
that he made virtually no recordings during the last two
