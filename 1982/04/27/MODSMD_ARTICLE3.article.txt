# Panel examines grad student ties to Industry

Public disclosures of the finan
cial interests of faculty members
should be instituted in order to
avoid potential conflicts of in
terest between academics and in
dustry, said several speakers at a
panel discussion yesterday at
Terman Auditorium.
Ralph Abascal, general attorney
for the California Rural Legal As
sistance Organization said that
when a faculty member has an
equity relationship with a firm,
there should be full disclosure on
the amount of equity, and when
he has a consulting relationship,
the specific nature of that rela
tionship should be known.
"The most important thing for
academics to recognize is that the
source, of funds determines the
research priorities," Abascal said.
University President Donald
Kennedy, who opened the sym
posium, said that a problem in for
mulating a comprehensive policy
is that different academic areas
currently have different regu
lations about faculty retaining in
come from personal activities.
As an example, Kennedy

pointed out that faculty who pub
lish books hold 100 percemt of the
royalties, while in the Medical
School there is heavy restriction
on how much income a professor
can retain from personal clinical
projects. "This shows a polar op
posite treatment of the fruits of a
faculty member's special activi
ty,"he said.
Med School Prof. Halstead
Holman, another panelist, said
that this disclosure should come
through published papers. He
said faculty members should be
induced, through an honor code
system, to completely disclose the
source of their funds. "The debate
we're in now is one of a crisis of
confidence. The way out is full
public exposure," he added.
Dean of Graduate Studies and
Research Gerald Lieberman said
the dangers of industrial-univer
sity ties are that professors who
have extensive ties to industry
may withhold data related to their
outside interests, they may have
insufficient energy to give to their
students, and finally, they "may
not advance the forefronts of sci
ence, but rather aid in com

mercialization."
According to Lieberman the
,problem is getting exposure now
because there are "un
precedented financial gains avail
able in such areas as computer
software and biotechnology."
He said it is important to re
member, that in the past year in
dustrial firms provided less than 5
percent of the total budget for
university research.
"I don't anticipate this next year
to be a much different number.
Ten years down the line, I see not
more than a doubling," he said.
Abascal countered that this
amount, while small, is a "vital
part of the sum."
Chemical Engineering graduate

student Bill Smith said that gradu
ate students suffer from this situ
ation when faculty persuade them
to work with them on their private
projects. Two of the problems
with this situation, according to
Smith, are that the quality of aca
demics may decrease and that stu
dents often don't get credit for
their work.
Smith said he feels that this situ
ation could be improved by re
quiring that faculty members dis
cuss their industrial project plans
before actually moving in this
direction. "Now their policy is like
asking 'who is playing with
matches' after the barn burns
down," he said.


Ralph Abascal
Chemistry Prof. Carl Djerassi is one
of those who did work in both the
University and with an industrial
firm, Syntex Corporation.
Like Smith, Djerassi advocated
complete disclosure of a professor's
activites.
Computer Science graduate stu
dent Tom Dietterich said that cur
rently there is an artificial in
telligence company being managed
by staff and faculty of the computer
science department.
