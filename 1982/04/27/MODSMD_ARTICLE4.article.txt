# University considers changing faculty policy
## 
### Cici Oremland Senior staff writer 
Charges of potential conflicts of interest have
led University administrators to consider bar
ring faculty from serving simultaneously as ad
visers and business employers for graduate re
search projects.
"This policy will solve some potential prob
lems. It will take students out of the awkward
position of being employeed by their educa
tional advisers," Gerald Lieberman, dean of
graduate studies and research, said yesterday.
But a spokesman for the Graduate Students
Association (GSA) which recently sent a memo
to the Academic Council Committee on Re
search concerning the issue said this solution
alone "dodges the problem."
"I can understand the University's position
because in that situation it would be easy to
transfer knowledge over without University
consent," said Bill Smith of the GSA, "but the
students involved in this situation are haopy
with the arrangement." The students are reluc
tant to place formal charges against their ad
visers who might have conflicts of interest be
cause they fear they will lose future job op

portunities as well as industrial research grants,
Smith said.
The conflict of interest problem has risen be
cause profits from research endeavors have in
creased the number of faculty who are assum
ing equity, holding managerial positions and
serving as consultants to industrial interests.
Both Smith and Lieberman say facul
ty/industry conflicts of interest are difficult to
document beyond hearsay but both acknowl
edge the problem is not new to universities that
concentrate heavily on research. For example,
UC-Davis denied a $2.5 million grant from Al
lied Corp. to researcher Raymond Valentine
who founded Calgene, an agriculture
bioengineering firm, when it was discovered
that Allied owned 20 percent interest in
Calgene.
"We're worried that because of rapid in
crease in the number of faculty involved in
commercial concerns, conflict of interest will
come as a result of systemic forces rather than
personal idiosyncrasies as in the past," Smith
said.
The memo outlined four cases of conflict of
interest reported to the Ombudsman's Office.

The cases did not mention names or depart
ments but discussed a post-doctorate student
whose project was undertaken by a firm where
her adviser was a consultant, and a masters stu
dent who designed a system for a faculty mem
ber's company — a project that offered little
educational value.
The memo proposes solutions which include
educating students as to existing University
channels for complaint such as the Om
budsman's Office and the Committee on Re
search. Another solution proposed would
make it mandatory for faculty members to dis
close their outside activities to the University.
Present University policy operates on a kind
of honor system where faculty members must
only disclose their outside interests when they
feel there may be a conflict of interest. Other
universities, such as the Massachusetts Institute
of Technology, require disclosure of their facul
ty members.
"I prefer the Stanford way," said Lieberman.
"Routine disclosure often only adds paper
work. And, when a faculty member has dis
closed his activities he may feel absolved of any
conflict of interest simply through his dis
closure."
