Britain warns time short
London — Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher warned Argentina yes
terday that time for negotiating a peace settlement is "getting extremely
short" before Britain follows its recapture of South Georgia island with
military action against Argentine forces on the Falklands.
Amid growing speculation among politicians and analysts here that
Britain's next military move may be made within 48 hours, Thatcher re
fused to discuss specific options or timing. But she noted that the British
fleet is approaching "closer to the Falklands" and told Parliament, "It's
obvious you simply cannot go on sitting there forever with a very large
task force."
After a little more than a day of sporadic, light fighting, Thatcher told
Parliament, the commander of the Argentine forces on South Georgia
"formally surrendered" yesterday morning. Military prisoners included
40 who surrendered at the Argentine garrison at the port of Grytviken
Sunday afternoon, 100 crewmen and garrison reinforcements aboard
the Argentine submarine attacked and disabled by British combat heli
copters Sunday morning, and 16 who surrendered at Leith, north of
Grytviken, yesterday morning.
Reporting that the only casualty was an injured Argentine sailor or
the submarine, Thatcher said, "British forces throughout the operation
used the minimum force necessary to achieve a successful outcome."
Negotiations "will have to come to a head soon," Thatcher said later
in her first national television appearance in three weeks. Discussing de
tails of the negotiations for the first time in an interview, she said she
would not yield on three points of principle: complete Argentine with
drawal from the Falklands; restoration at least temporarily of British ad
ministration, perhaps with an international peace-keeping force; and
guaranteed self-determination for the islands' 1800 English-speaking In
habitants in any future sovereignty talks.
Thatcher also said on television yesterday night, "I want minimum es
calation" of the conflict. But she refused to rule out military options and
said she hoped the recapture of South Georgia would make Argentina
realize that "we are quietly determined in pursuit of a principle."
Argentina admits island overrun
Buenos Aires — Argentine government officials
conceded privately Sunday that British forces had ov
errun the 140-man defense force on the South Atlan
tic island of South Georgia, although official com
muniques asserted that the Argentines were "resist
ing intense shelling" from ships and machine-gun fire
from the air.
The barren island's defenders radioed to their
headquarters during the day that they were destroy
ing their codes "before facing the final combat" as
British commandoes went ashore by helicopter and
landing craft under cover of heavy fire from ships
close to shore.
Argentina apparently was caught by surprise by the
timing of the attack on the desolate island 1200 miles
east of the mainland, and 800 miles east of the
Falkland Islands. Military sources said the Argentines
had not expected an attack before today.
The military junta that rules Argentina went into
session at mid-morning in the navy headquarters here
and remained closeted throughout Sunday.
Reports circulated in diplomatic circles that the
three-man junta was divided over how to react, with
President Leopoldo Galtieri, who also is army com
mander-in-chief, and the navy commander, Admiral
Jorge Anaya, demanding a strong reaction, while the
air force chief, Basilio Lami Dozo, counseled restraint.
The original Argentine strategy was to keep its fleet,
which includes an ancient cruiser and a rebuilt air
craft carrier, in comparatively shallow waters close to
the mainland in order to maintain air superiority and
make it difficult for British nuclear submarines to op
erate.
But sources said that Admiral Anaya is eager to sail
toward the Falklands and engage the larger and more
modern British fleet.
Whatever the outcome of the Argentine strategy
meetings, government officials said privately that the
South Georgia fighting has all but destroyed any
chance that Secretary of State Alexander Haig Jr. can
find a peaceful way out of the crisis, which began
April 2, when Argentine troops invaded the Falklands.
Argentine officials said two or three crewmen were
badly wounded in the attack.
Reapportionment upheld
Washington — The U.S. Supreme Court yesterday
threw out the Republican National Committee's legal
challenge to the congressional reapportionment plan

that is scheduled for use in California's primary and
general election this year.
The Republicans had argued that the plan —
adopted by the Democratic-controlled California
Legislature last year — carved up congressional dis
tricts unfairly in a way aimed at maximizing the
chances for Democrats. The plan should not be used
at least until after a referendum on reapportionment
is held in California in June, the GOP lawyers main
tained.
Under the 1980 census, California's congressional
delegation will increase next year from 43 seats to 45.
At the moment, there are 22 Democrats and 21 Re
publicans in the California delegation. The Re
publican National Committee complained in court
papers that the 1981 redisricting plan, designed by
Rep. Phillip Burton (D-Calif.), will have the "probable
effect" of leading to the election of 28 Democrats and
17 Republicans.
The Supreme Court decided to leave in effect last
January's ruling by the California Supreme Court,
which permits the new congressional districts to be
used in this year's elections. The Supreme Court jus
tices acted in a brief, one-line order without any com
ment or dissenting votes.
Salvadoran assembly boycotted
San Salvador — El Salvador's Christian Democratic
Party boycotted the formal inaugural session of the
newly elected constituent assembly yesterday, saying
the ruling military-civilian junta had not been official
ly invited by an "arrogant" right-wing assembly lead
ership.
It was a political act evidently designed by the
Christian Democrats to embarrass the newly elected
chief of the assembly, former army Maj. Roberto
D'Aubuisson, whose rightist supporters control the
legislative body. He delivered his welcoming speech
to a half-empty hall, telling the assembled diplomats,
including U.S. Ambassador Deane Hinton, that the
day opens "one of the most beautiful chapters of our
national history."
The inaugural session of the assembly came before
formal agreement was reached on the appointment
of a provisional president to rule the country until a
presidential election can be organized. The assembly
is expected to name banker Alvaro Alfredo Magana
over the objection of D'Aubuisson's party.
Members of D'Aubuisson's Nationalist Republican
Alliance, known as ARENA, its Spanish abbreviation,
were furious, insisting that all members of the 30-
month-old military-civilian junta, includingtheChris

tian Democratic junta President Jose Napoleon
Duarte, had been invited properly, receiving formal
invitation cards signed by D'Aubuisson.
Freeze approval predicted
Washington — Rep. Edward Markey (D-Mass.),
predicted yesterday that the House of Represent
atives will approve a resolution this session calling
upon the United States and the Soviet Union to freeze
production and deployment of nuclear weapons.
"Never in my six years in Congress have I seen an
issue take hold so quickly and with such broad-based
intensity," said Markey, co-sponsor of the freeze res
olution, which he said now has 169 backers in the
House, including 28 Republicans.
Markey made his comments at a news conference
here sponsored by the Nuclear Weapons Freeze
Campaign, a coalition of about 100 groups supporting
the freeze idea.
Campaign officials also released the names of 133
Roman Catholic bishops who have endorsed the
freeze. Bishop Joseph Francis of Newark, N.J., said this
figure represented nearly half of the active Roman
Catholic bishops in the country.
Markey's optimistic forecast for the freeze resolu
tion in the House contrasted with the prospects in the
Senate of a similar resolution backed by the Freeze
Campaign and introduced by Sens. Edward Kennedy
(D-Mass.), and Mark Hatfield (R-Ore.).
Co-sponsors of the Kennedy-Hatfield resolution
concede that they will have a difficult time because of
an alternative proposal, introduced by Sens. Henry
Jackson (D-Wash.) and John Warner (R-Va.), that links
a freeze to equality of nuclear weapons between the
United States and the Soviets. Freeze campaign lead
ers say this condition would lead to continuation of
the arms race.
Egypt proposes peace talks
Cario — In a major foreign policy address following
the completion of the Israeli withdrawal from the Si
nai, President Hosni Mubarak yesterday called on
other Arab states and the Palestinians to join Israel
and Egypt in the search for a comprehensive Middle
East peace settlement.
Reaffirming again Cairo's full commitment to the
Camp David accords and its treaty with Israel,
Mubarak said he would pursue in the coming days the
resumption of talks with Israel on the Palestinian au
tonomy issue. He called the talks the "key" to a just

solution and"the only guarantee of stability and se
curity in the region."
Mubarak's hour-long speech seemed to be aimed
primarily at ending Israeli and American fears that
Egypt might pull away from the Camp David peace
process following the Israeli pullout of the Sinai Sun
day and might give priority to Egyptian normalization
of relations with the other Arab states.
While he was openly critical of Israeli plans toestab
lish new settlements in the West Bank and Gaza Strip,
and of recent Israeli military actions in those occupied
territories and in Lebanon, Mubarak said nothing to
indicate all of this had shaken his faith in the peace
process.
The Egyptian leader said it was "imperative" to take
the first step toward solving the Palestinian problem
by opening negotiations on autonomy and ending
the consolidation of Israeli military and civilian rule in
the West Bank and Gaza Strip.
CIA documents requested
Washington — A House subcommittee may con
front President Reagan on a question of secrecy this
week by pressing for publication of CIA documents
on the extent of Arab investments in the United
States.
Reagan has formally refused to permit disclosure of
the studies on the grounds that their release "would
be likely to cause grave injury to our foreign relations
or would compromise sources and methods of in
telligence gathering."
Rep. Benjamin Rosenthal (D-N.Y.), the subcommit
tee chairman, fired back last week by introducing a
resolution calling on the House to overrule Reagan
and authorize publication with only a few deletions to
protect "specific intelligence sources and methods."
Stocks reach three-month high
New York — The stock market climbed to a three
month high yesterday, extending a spring rally in a
late buying surge led by technnology issues.
The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials, which rose
9.04 points Friday, added another 3.42 points to close
at 865.58. The blue-chip average recovered from
being down 2.95 points at noon.
Today's weather
Coastal low clouds spreading locally inland this
morning, otherwise fair through tonight. Partly
cloudy tomorrow. Lows in the mid 40s to mid 50s.
Highs in the upper 50s to upper 60s.

Britain warns time short
London — Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher warned Argentina yes
terday that time for negotiating a peace settlement is "getting extremely
short" before Britain follows its recapture of South Georgia island with
military action against Argentine forces on the Falklands.
Amid growing speculation among politicians and analysts here that
Britain's next military move may be made within 48 hours, Thatcher re
fused to discuss specific options or timing. But she noted that the British
fleet is approaching "closer to the Falklands" and told Parliament, "It's
obvious you simply cannot go on sitting there forever with a very large
task force."
After a little more than a day of sporadic, light fighting, Thatcher told
Parliament, the commander of the Argentine forces on South Georgia
"formally surrendered" yesterday morning. Military prisoners included
40 who surrendered at the Argentine garrison at the port of Grytviken
Sunday afternoon, 100 crewmen and garrison reinforcements aboard
the Argentine submarine attacked and disabled by British combat heli
copters Sunday morning, and 16 who surrendered at Leith, north of
Grytviken, yesterday morning.
Reporting that the only casualty was an injured Argentine sailor or
the submarine, Thatcher said, "British forces throughout the operation
used the minimum force necessary to achieve a successful outcome."
Negotiations "will have to come to a head soon," Thatcher said later
in her first national television appearance in three weeks. Discussing de
tails of the negotiations for the first time in an interview, she said she
would not yield on three points of principle: complete Argentine with
drawal from the Falklands; restoration at least temporarily of British ad
ministration, perhaps with an international peace-keeping force; and
guaranteed self-determination for the islands' 1800 English-speaking In
habitants in any future sovereignty talks.
Thatcher also said on television yesterday night, "I want minimum es
calation" of the conflict. But she refused to rule out military options and
said she hoped the recapture of South Georgia would make Argentina
realize that "we are quietly determined in pursuit of a principle."
Argentina admits island overrun
Buenos Aires — Argentine government officials
conceded privately Sunday that British forces had ov
errun the 140-man defense force on the South Atlan
tic island of South Georgia, although official com
muniques asserted that the Argentines were "resist
ing intense shelling" from ships and machine-gun fire
from the air.
The barren island's defenders radioed to their
headquarters during the day that they were destroy
ing their codes "before facing the final combat" as
British commandoes went ashore by helicopter and
landing craft under cover of heavy fire from ships
close to shore.
Argentina apparently was caught by surprise by the
timing of the attack on the desolate island 1200 miles
east of the mainland, and 800 miles east of the
Falkland Islands. Military sources said the Argentines
had not expected an attack before today.
The military junta that rules Argentina went into
session at mid-morning in the navy headquarters here
and remained closeted throughout Sunday.
Reports circulated in diplomatic circles that the
three-man junta was divided over how to react, with
President Leopoldo Galtieri, who also is army com
mander-in-chief, and the navy commander, Admiral
Jorge Anaya, demanding a strong reaction, while the
air force chief, Basilio Lami Dozo, counseled restraint.
The original Argentine strategy was to keep its fleet,
which includes an ancient cruiser and a rebuilt air
craft carrier, in comparatively shallow waters close to
the mainland in order to maintain air superiority and
make it difficult for British nuclear submarines to op
erate.
But sources said that Admiral Anaya is eager to sail
toward the Falklands and engage the larger and more
modern British fleet.
Whatever the outcome of the Argentine strategy
meetings, government officials said privately that the
South Georgia fighting has all but destroyed any
chance that Secretary of State Alexander Haig Jr. can
find a peaceful way out of the crisis, which began
April 2, when Argentine troops invaded the Falklands.
Argentine officials said two or three crewmen were
badly wounded in the attack.
Reapportionment upheld
Washington — The U.S. Supreme Court yesterday
threw out the Republican National Committee's legal
challenge to the congressional reapportionment plan

that is scheduled for use in California's primary and
general election this year.
The Republicans had argued that the plan —
adopted by the Democratic-controlled California
Legislature last year — carved up congressional dis
tricts unfairly in a way aimed at maximizing the
chances for Democrats. The plan should not be used
at least until after a referendum on reapportionment
is held in California in June, the GOP lawyers main
tained.
Under the 1980 census, California's congressional
delegation will increase next year from 43 seats to 45.
At the moment, there are 22 Democrats and 21 Re
publicans in the California delegation. The Re
publican National Committee complained in court
papers that the 1981 redisricting plan, designed by
Rep. Phillip Burton (D-Calif.), will have the "probable
effect" of leading to the election of 28 Democrats and
17 Republicans.
The Supreme Court decided to leave in effect last
January's ruling by the California Supreme Court,
which permits the new congressional districts to be
used in this year's elections. The Supreme Court jus
tices acted in a brief, one-line order without any com
ment or dissenting votes.
Salvadoran assembly boycotted
San Salvador — El Salvador's Christian Democratic
Party boycotted the formal inaugural session of the
newly elected constituent assembly yesterday, saying
the ruling military-civilian junta had not been official
ly invited by an "arrogant" right-wing assembly lead
ership.
It was a political act evidently designed by the
Christian Democrats to embarrass the newly elected
chief of the assembly, former army Maj. Roberto
D'Aubuisson, whose rightist supporters control the
legislative body. He delivered his welcoming speech
to a half-empty hall, telling the assembled diplomats,
including U.S. Ambassador Deane Hinton, that the
day opens "one of the most beautiful chapters of our
national history."
The inaugural session of the assembly came before
formal agreement was reached on the appointment
of a provisional president to rule the country until a
presidential election can be organized. The assembly
is expected to name banker Alvaro Alfredo Magana
over the objection of D'Aubuisson's party.
Members of D'Aubuisson's Nationalist Republican
Alliance, known as ARENA, its Spanish abbreviation,
were furious, insisting that all members of the 30-
month-old military-civilian junta, includingtheChris

tian Democratic junta President Jose Napoleon
Duarte, had been invited properly, receiving formal
invitation cards signed by D'Aubuisson.
Freeze approval predicted
Washington — Rep. Edward Markey (D-Mass.),
predicted yesterday that the House of Represent
atives will approve a resolution this session calling
upon the United States and the Soviet Union to freeze
production and deployment of nuclear weapons.
"Never in my six years in Congress have I seen an
issue take hold so quickly and with such broad-based
intensity," said Markey, co-sponsor of the freeze res
olution, which he said now has 169 backers in the
House, including 28 Republicans.
Markey made his comments at a news conference
here sponsored by the Nuclear Weapons Freeze
Campaign, a coalition of about 100 groups supporting
the freeze idea.
Campaign officials also released the names of 133
Roman Catholic bishops who have endorsed the
freeze. Bishop Joseph Francis of Newark, N.J., said this
figure represented nearly half of the active Roman
Catholic bishops in the country.
Markey's optimistic forecast for the freeze resolu
tion in the House contrasted with the prospects in the
Senate of a similar resolution backed by the Freeze
Campaign and introduced by Sens. Edward Kennedy
(D-Mass.), and Mark Hatfield (R-Ore.).
Co-sponsors of the Kennedy-Hatfield resolution
concede that they will have a difficult time because of
an alternative proposal, introduced by Sens. Henry
Jackson (D-Wash.) and John Warner (R-Va.), that links
a freeze to equality of nuclear weapons between the
United States and the Soviets. Freeze campaign lead
ers say this condition would lead to continuation of
the arms race.
Egypt proposes peace talks
Cario — In a major foreign policy address following
the completion of the Israeli withdrawal from the Si
nai, President Hosni Mubarak yesterday called on
other Arab states and the Palestinians to join Israel
and Egypt in the search for a comprehensive Middle
East peace settlement.
Reaffirming again Cairo's full commitment to the
Camp David accords and its treaty with Israel,
Mubarak said he would pursue in the coming days the
resumption of talks with Israel on the Palestinian au
tonomy issue. He called the talks the "key" to a just

solution and"the only guarantee of stability and se
curity in the region."
Mubarak's hour-long speech seemed to be aimed
primarily at ending Israeli and American fears that
Egypt might pull away from the Camp David peace
process following the Israeli pullout of the Sinai Sun
day and might give priority to Egyptian normalization
of relations with the other Arab states.
While he was openly critical of Israeli plans toestab
lish new settlements in the West Bank and Gaza Strip,
and of recent Israeli military actions in those occupied
territories and in Lebanon, Mubarak said nothing to
indicate all of this had shaken his faith in the peace
process.
The Egyptian leader said it was "imperative" to take
the first step toward solving the Palestinian problem
by opening negotiations on autonomy and ending
the consolidation of Israeli military and civilian rule in
the West Bank and Gaza Strip.
CIA documents requested
Washington — A House subcommittee may con
front President Reagan on a question of secrecy this
week by pressing for publication of CIA documents
on the extent of Arab investments in the United
States.
Reagan has formally refused to permit disclosure of
the studies on the grounds that their release "would
be likely to cause grave injury to our foreign relations
or would compromise sources and methods of in
telligence gathering."
Rep. Benjamin Rosenthal (D-N.Y.), the subcommit
tee chairman, fired back last week by introducing a
resolution calling on the House to overrule Reagan
and authorize publication with only a few deletions to
protect "specific intelligence sources and methods."
Stocks reach three-month high
New York — The stock market climbed to a three
month high yesterday, extending a spring rally in a
late buying surge led by technnology issues.
The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials, which rose
9.04 points Friday, added another 3.42 points to close
at 865.58. The blue-chip average recovered from
being down 2.95 points at noon.

Britain warns time short
London — Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher warned Argentina yes
terday that time for negotiating a peace settlement is "getting extremely
short" before Britain follows its recapture of South Georgia island with
military action against Argentine forces on the Falklands.
Amid growing speculation among politicians and analysts here that
Britain's next military move may be made within 48 hours, Thatcher re
fused to discuss specific options or timing. But she noted that the British
fleet is approaching "closer to the Falklands" and told Parliament, "It's
obvious you simply cannot go on sitting there forever with a very large
task force."
After a little more than a day of sporadic, light fighting, Thatcher told
Parliament, the commander of the Argentine forces on South Georgia
"formally surrendered" yesterday morning. Military prisoners included
40 who surrendered at the Argentine garrison at the port of Grytviken
Sunday afternoon, 100 crewmen and garrison reinforcements aboard
the Argentine submarine attacked and disabled by British combat heli
copters Sunday morning, and 16 who surrendered at Leith, north of
Grytviken, yesterday morning.
Reporting that the only casualty was an injured Argentine sailor or
the submarine, Thatcher said, "British forces throughout the operation
used the minimum force necessary to achieve a successful outcome."
Negotiations "will have to come to a head soon," Thatcher said later
in her first national television appearance in three weeks. Discussing de
tails of the negotiations for the first time in an interview, she said she
would not yield on three points of principle: complete Argentine with
drawal from the Falklands; restoration at least temporarily of British ad
ministration, perhaps with an international peace-keeping force; and
guaranteed self-determination for the islands' 1800 English-speaking In
habitants in any future sovereignty talks.
Thatcher also said on television yesterday night, "I want minimum es
calation" of the conflict. But she refused to rule out military options and
said she hoped the recapture of South Georgia would make Argentina
realize that "we are quietly determined in pursuit of a principle."
Argentina admits island overrun
Buenos Aires — Argentine government officials
conceded privately Sunday that British forces had ov
errun the 140-man defense force on the South Atlan
tic island of South Georgia, although official com
muniques asserted that the Argentines were "resist
ing intense shelling" from ships and machine-gun fire
from the air.
The barren island's defenders radioed to their
headquarters during the day that they were destroy
ing their codes "before facing the final combat" as
British commandoes went ashore by helicopter and
landing craft under cover of heavy fire from ships
close to shore.
Argentina apparently was caught by surprise by the
timing of the attack on the desolate island 1200 miles
east of the mainland, and 800 miles east of the
Falkland Islands. Military sources said the Argentines
had not expected an attack before today.
The military junta that rules Argentina went into
session at mid-morning in the navy headquarters here
and remained closeted throughout Sunday.
Reports circulated in diplomatic circles that the
three-man junta was divided over how to react, with
President Leopoldo Galtieri, who also is army com
mander-in-chief, and the navy commander, Admiral
Jorge Anaya, demanding a strong reaction, while the
air force chief, Basilio Lami Dozo, counseled restraint.
The original Argentine strategy was to keep its fleet,
which includes an ancient cruiser and a rebuilt air
craft carrier, in comparatively shallow waters close to
the mainland in order to maintain air superiority and
make it difficult for British nuclear submarines to op
erate.
But sources said that Admiral Anaya is eager to sail
toward the Falklands and engage the larger and more
modern British fleet.
Whatever the outcome of the Argentine strategy
meetings, government officials said privately that the
South Georgia fighting has all but destroyed any
chance that Secretary of State Alexander Haig Jr. can
find a peaceful way out of the crisis, which began
April 2, when Argentine troops invaded the Falklands.
Argentine officials said two or three crewmen were
badly wounded in the attack.
Reapportionment upheld
Washington — The U.S. Supreme Court yesterday
threw out the Republican National Committee's legal
challenge to the congressional reapportionment plan

that is scheduled for use in California's primary and
general election this year.
The Republicans had argued that the plan —
adopted by the Democratic-controlled California
Legislature last year — carved up congressional dis
tricts unfairly in a way aimed at maximizing the
chances for Democrats. The plan should not be used
at least until after a referendum on reapportionment
is held in California in June, the GOP lawyers main
tained.
Under the 1980 census, California's congressional
delegation will increase next year from 43 seats to 45.
At the moment, there are 22 Democrats and 21 Re
publicans in the California delegation. The Re
publican National Committee complained in court
papers that the 1981 redisricting plan, designed by
Rep. Phillip Burton (D-Calif.), will have the "probable
effect" of leading to the election of 28 Democrats and
17 Republicans.
The Supreme Court decided to leave in effect last
January's ruling by the California Supreme Court,
which permits the new congressional districts to be
used in this year's elections. The Supreme Court jus
tices acted in a brief, one-line order without any com
ment or dissenting votes.
Salvadoran assembly boycotted
San Salvador — El Salvador's Christian Democratic
Party boycotted the formal inaugural session of the
newly elected constituent assembly yesterday, saying
the ruling military-civilian junta had not been official
ly invited by an "arrogant" right-wing assembly lead
ership.
It was a political act evidently designed by the
Christian Democrats to embarrass the newly elected
chief of the assembly, former army Maj. Roberto
D'Aubuisson, whose rightist supporters control the
legislative body. He delivered his welcoming speech
to a half-empty hall, telling the assembled diplomats,
including U.S. Ambassador Deane Hinton, that the
day opens "one of the most beautiful chapters of our
national history."
The inaugural session of the assembly came before
formal agreement was reached on the appointment
of a provisional president to rule the country until a
presidential election can be organized. The assembly
is expected to name banker Alvaro Alfredo Magana
over the objection of D'Aubuisson's party.
Members of D'Aubuisson's Nationalist Republican
Alliance, known as ARENA, its Spanish abbreviation,
were furious, insisting that all members of the 30-
month-old military-civilian junta, includingtheChris

tian Democratic junta President Jose Napoleon
Duarte, had been invited properly, receiving formal
invitation cards signed by D'Aubuisson.
Freeze approval predicted
Washington — Rep. Edward Markey (D-Mass.),
predicted yesterday that the House of Represent
atives will approve a resolution this session calling
upon the United States and the Soviet Union to freeze
production and deployment of nuclear weapons.
"Never in my six years in Congress have I seen an
issue take hold so quickly and with such broad-based
intensity," said Markey, co-sponsor of the freeze res
olution, which he said now has 169 backers in the
House, including 28 Republicans.
Markey made his comments at a news conference
here sponsored by the Nuclear Weapons Freeze
Campaign, a coalition of about 100 groups supporting
the freeze idea.
Campaign officials also released the names of 133
Roman Catholic bishops who have endorsed the
freeze. Bishop Joseph Francis of Newark, N.J., said this
figure represented nearly half of the active Roman
Catholic bishops in the country.
Markey's optimistic forecast for the freeze resolu
tion in the House contrasted with the prospects in the
Senate of a similar resolution backed by the Freeze
Campaign and introduced by Sens. Edward Kennedy
(D-Mass.), and Mark Hatfield (R-Ore.).
Co-sponsors of the Kennedy-Hatfield resolution
concede that they will have a difficult time because of
an alternative proposal, introduced by Sens. Henry
Jackson (D-Wash.) and John Warner (R-Va.), that links
a freeze to equality of nuclear weapons between the
United States and the Soviets. Freeze campaign lead
ers say this condition would lead to continuation of
the arms race.
Egypt proposes peace talks
Cario — In a major foreign policy address following
the completion of the Israeli withdrawal from the Si
nai, President Hosni Mubarak yesterday called on
other Arab states and the Palestinians to join Israel
and Egypt in the search for a comprehensive Middle
East peace settlement.
Reaffirming again Cairo's full commitment to the
Camp David accords and its treaty with Israel,
Mubarak said he would pursue in the coming days the
resumption of talks with Israel on the Palestinian au
tonomy issue. He called the talks the "key" to a just

solution and"the only guarantee of stability and se
curity in the region."
Mubarak's hour-long speech seemed to be aimed
primarily at ending Israeli and American fears that
Egypt might pull away from the Camp David peace
process following the Israeli pullout of the Sinai Sun
day and might give priority to Egyptian normalization
of relations with the other Arab states.
While he was openly critical of Israeli plans toestab
lish new settlements in the West Bank and Gaza Strip,
and of recent Israeli military actions in those occupied
territories and in Lebanon, Mubarak said nothing to
indicate all of this had shaken his faith in the peace
process.
The Egyptian leader said it was "imperative" to take
the first step toward solving the Palestinian problem
by opening negotiations on autonomy and ending
the consolidation of Israeli military and civilian rule in
the West Bank and Gaza Strip.
CIA documents requested
Washington — A House subcommittee may con
front President Reagan on a question of secrecy this
week by pressing for publication of CIA documents
on the extent of Arab investments in the United
States.
Reagan has formally refused to permit disclosure of
the studies on the grounds that their release "would
be likely to cause grave injury to our foreign relations
or would compromise sources and methods of in
telligence gathering."
Rep. Benjamin Rosenthal (D-N.Y.), the subcommit
tee chairman, fired back last week by introducing a
resolution calling on the House to overrule Reagan
and authorize publication with only a few deletions to
protect "specific intelligence sources and methods."
Stocks reach three-month high
New York — The stock market climbed to a three
month high yesterday, extending a spring rally in a
late buying surge led by technnology issues.
The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials, which rose
9.04 points Friday, added another 3.42 points to close
at 865.58. The blue-chip average recovered from
being down 2.95 points at noon.
Today's weather
Coastal low clouds spreading locally inland this
morning, otherwise fair through tonight. Partly
cloudy tomorrow. Lows in the mid 40s to mid 50s.
Highs in the upper 50s to upper 60s.
