Britain warns time short
London — Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher warned Argentina yes
terday that time for negotiating a peace settlement is "getting extremely
short" before Britain follows its recapture of South Georgia island with
military action against Argentine forces on the Falklands.
Amid growing speculation among politicians and analysts here that
Britain's next military move may be made within 48 hours, Thatcher re
fused to discuss specific options or timing. But she noted that the British
fleet is approaching "closer to the Falklands" and told Parliament, "It's
obvious you simply cannot go on sitting there forever with a very large
task force."
After a little more than a day of sporadic, light fighting, Thatcher told
Parliament, the commander of the Argentine forces on South Georgia
"formally surrendered" yesterday morning. Military prisoners included
40 who surrendered at the Argentine garrison at the port of Grytviken
Sunday afternoon, 100 crewmen and garrison reinforcements aboard
the Argentine submarine attacked and disabled by British combat heli
copters Sunday morning, and 16 who surrendered at Leith, north of
Grytviken, yesterday morning.
Reporting that the only casualty was an injured Argentine sailor or
the submarine, Thatcher said, "British forces throughout the operation
used the minimum force necessary to achieve a successful outcome."
Negotiations "will have to come to a head soon," Thatcher said later
in her first national television appearance in three weeks. Discussing de
tails of the negotiations for the first time in an interview, she said she
would not yield on three points of principle: complete Argentine with
drawal from the Falklands; restoration at least temporarily of British ad
ministration, perhaps with an international peace-keeping force; and
guaranteed self-determination for the islands' 1800 English-speaking In
habitants in any future sovereignty talks.
Thatcher also said on television yesterday night, "I want minimum es
calation" of the conflict. But she refused to rule out military options and
said she hoped the recapture of South Georgia would make Argentina
realize that "we are quietly determined in pursuit of a principle."
