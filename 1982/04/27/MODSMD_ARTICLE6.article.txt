# 'Garp' author Irving discusses his writing
## 
### Ray Newman 
John Irving, the author of the
bestseller The World According to
Carp, told a packed Kresge
Auditorium audience last night that
in his works he attempted to com
municate a "mystery and magic and
sense of wonder of people".
Irving, whom Time magazine
called "the most successful 'serious'
young writer in America", read from
Carp and told stories of his own liter
ary rejections.
Before reading a short story taken
from Carp, Irving, who brought the

crowd to laughter during the talk, de
tailed the dismal publishing history
of the story. Irving tried to get the
story published by The New Yorker.
That magazine rejected the story and
particularly disliked the parts of the
story that Irving liked best. After The
New Yorker rejected the story, he
said every other major magazine in
the country also rejected it.
One rejection notice that Irving
said he especially liked said, "The
story is only mildly interesting, and it
does nothing new with language or

form." The magazine was the Paris
Review.
Because of his many rejections
from magazines, Irving said that he
was glad he did not have to deal with
magazines often, since he usually
writes novels.
Although Irving has already pub
lished five books, and was recently
pictured on the cover of Time, he
said that all of his works in progress
were "truly not fit to read".
Irving told the capacity crowd how
he had written his story. Explaining
that "I have a slow mind and I need to
know where I am going," Irving

wrote the ending of the story first.
The story itself, which is near the be
ginning of the Garp novel, was writ
ten only after three-quarters of the
book was finished.
The story that Irving read was
about a man who works as a hotel in
spector for the Tourist Bureau. He
and his family investigate a class "C"
hotel whose guests include a trained
bear, a man who can walk only on his
hands, and a gypsy that tells dreams.
Irving said that the function of the
story within the novel was to provide
evidence of Garp's ability to write.
Irving called the story "the only good
short story I ever wrote".
Irving spoke here as part of the
Jean and Bill Lane Lecture Series.
