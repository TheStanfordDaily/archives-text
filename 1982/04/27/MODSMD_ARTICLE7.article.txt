# University to keep its aid-blind admissions
## 
### Sally Newman 
Despite poor economic conditions
and proposed federal budget cuts,
Dean of Admissions Fred Hargadon
said the University will remain com
mitted to its aid-blind admissions pol
icy.
Stanford is among the few of the
nation's more than 3000 four-year
colleges and universities still able to
assure all undergraduate applicants
equal consideration, and to guaran
tee that all admitted students will
have enough money to pay for an
education.
University officials are so com
mitted to the program that, accord
ing to Vince DeAnda, assistant direc
tor of financial aids, "We're not even
looking at an alternative, and as far
ahead as we can see, we don't need
to find one."
Wesleyan University in Mid
dletown, Conn., was the most recent
well-known institution to drop its
aid-blind policy, and the several
dozen schools that retain the policy
face the dilemma of fulfilling their
promises with shrinking funds.
No college claims to meet student
financial need solely by gift aid (mon
ey which students need not repay).
Like several other schools, Stanford
requires students to meet a portion
of their expenses via self-help, such
as on-campus jobs or loans: here that
sum averages 25 percent of the aid
package, according to DeAnda.
However, the University does
divide recipients of financial aid into
several categories which determine
the percentage of aid from each
source.
The 5 to 10 percent of each enter
ing class which the Office of Ad
missions deems the most academ
ically outstanding is placed into one
group, generally not expected to get
jobs during the school year, though
some do anyway to lower their loan
liability, DeAnda said.
Students who come to Stanford on
athletic scholarships are also handled
separately; the proportion of gift aid
which they receive is generally larg
er, and is usually financed by the
Buck or Cardinal Clubs, two alumni
backed groups which provide athlet
ic scholarships.
One feature of most under
graduate aid packages, the expecta

tion of self-help, varies widely from
school to school. At Harvard, for ex
ample, every student who receives fi
nancial aid is expected to get a job
during the term, according to a fi
nancial aid officer there.
As at Stanford, Brown and Cal
Tech, a typical job obligation at
Harvard is 10 hours per week; Welles
ley College students average six
hours per week, according to Welles
ley Financial Aids Director Amy
Nychis. At Cal Tech, however,
freshmen are not allowed to hold
jobs during the school year and must
borrow the $2700 self-help figure ex
pected there, according to Sterling
Huntley, Cal Tech director of ad
missions.
Huntley, who was an associate
dean of admissions here for 11 years,
said that Cal Tech is "strongly com
mitted to the aid-blind policy until
we run out of money." Before dis
carding such a policy, Huntley said,
"we would add more self-help â€”
currently ours is considerably lower
than MlT's expectation of $4200 per
year.
"The next step would be to give
less aid to foreign and transfer stu
dents." (Unlike Stanford, Cal Tech
now meets the full need of both for
eign students and transfers. Stanford
is one of the few private universities
which doesn't aid foreign students.)
"Ultimately we would limit the
'marginal admits,' but we're still a
long way from that," Huntley said.
From President Donald Kennedy's
strong affirmation of Stanford's com
mitment to both aid-blind ad
missions and meeting every under
graduate's demonstrated need, the
University appears to be a long way
from considering dropping it as well.
"Nothing can be more important
than for us to continue to admit stu
dents on the basis of merit alone,"
Kennedy told the Academic Council
April 9.
"Our need-blind admissions poli
cy is central to everything we do,"
Kennedy said. "It recognizes the
critical importance of our student
body to our educational objectives,
and identifies the merit and diversity
of that student body as features to
which we are fully committed."
"The bottom line is the institu
