# University to keep its aid-blind admissions
## 
### Sally Newman 
Despite poor economic conditions
and proposed federal budget cuts,
Dean of Admissions Fred Hargadon
said the University will remain com
mitted to its aid-blind admissions pol
icy.
Stanford is among the few of the
nation's more than 3000 four-year
colleges and universities still able to
assure all undergraduate applicants
equal consideration, and to guaran
tee that all admitted students will
have enough money to pay for an
education.
University officials are so com
mitted to the program that, accord
ing to Vince DeAnda, assistant direc
tor of financial aids, "We're not even
looking at an alternative, and as far
ahead as we can see, we don't need
to find one."
Wesleyan University in Mid
dletown, Conn., was the most recent
well-known institution to drop its
aid-blind policy, and the several
dozen schools that retain the policy
face the dilemma of fulfilling their
promises with shrinking funds.
No college claims to meet student
financial need solely by gift aid (mon
ey which students need not repay).
Like several other schools, Stanford
requires students to meet a portion
of their expenses via self-help, such
as on-campus jobs or loans: here that
sum averages 25 percent of the aid
package, according to DeAnda.
However, the University does
divide recipients of financial aid into
several categories which determine
the percentage of aid from each
source.
The 5 to 10 percent of each enter
ing class which the Office of Ad
missions deems the most academ
ically outstanding is placed into one
group, generally not expected to get
jobs during the school year, though
some do anyway to lower their loan
liability, DeAnda said.
Students who come to Stanford on
athletic scholarships are also handled
separately; the proportion of gift aid
which they receive is generally larg
er, and is usually financed by the
Buck or Cardinal Clubs, two alumni
backed groups which provide athlet
ic scholarships.
One feature of most under
graduate aid packages, the expecta

tion of self-help, varies widely from
school to school. At Harvard, for ex
ample, every student who receives fi
nancial aid is expected to get a job
during the term, according to a fi
nancial aid officer there.
As at Stanford, Brown and Cal
Tech, a typical job obligation at
Harvard is 10 hours per week; Welles
ley College students average six
hours per week, according to Welles
ley Financial Aids Director Amy
Nychis. At Cal Tech, however,
freshmen are not allowed to hold
jobs during the school year and must
borrow the $2700 self-help figure ex
pected there, according to Sterling
Huntley, Cal Tech director of ad
missions.
Huntley, who was an associate
dean of admissions here for 11 years,
said that Cal Tech is "strongly com
mitted to the aid-blind policy until
we run out of money." Before dis
carding such a policy, Huntley said,
"we would add more self-help —
currently ours is considerably lower
than MlT's expectation of $4200 per
year.
"The next step would be to give
less aid to foreign and transfer stu
dents." (Unlike Stanford, Cal Tech
now meets the full need of both for
eign students and transfers. Stanford
is one of the few private universities
which doesn't aid foreign students.)
"Ultimately we would limit the
'marginal admits,' but we're still a
long way from that," Huntley said.
From President Donald Kennedy's
strong affirmation of Stanford's com
mitment to both aid-blind ad
missions and meeting every under
graduate's demonstrated need, the
University appears to be a long way
from considering dropping it as well.
"Nothing can be more important
than for us to continue to admit stu
dents on the basis of merit alone,"
Kennedy told the Academic Council
April 9.
"Our need-blind admissions poli
cy is central to everything we do,"
Kennedy said. "It recognizes the
critical importance of our student
body to our educational objectives,
and identifies the merit and diversity
of that student body as features to
which we are fully committed."
"The bottom line is the institu
tional commitment to this policy,"
said Tim Warner, an assistant provost
for management and budget. "If they
wanted, some other institutions
could take money away from other
things and apply it to financial aid,"
he said.
Warner added that Stanford is for
tunate in that it is not as dependent
on federal aid as are private schools
located in states without strong state
scholarship programs. "We're not as
highly leveraged with regard to Pell
Grants and SEOGs, which makes our
position with regard to maintaining

the aid-blind policy much more
feasible," he said.
If the University ever had to begin
denying admission to students un
able to afford to attend, "my guess is
the quality or the class would suffer
— and the two most important parts
of a college are a first-rate faculty and
a first-rate student body," said
Hargadon.
James Rogers, Brown University di
rector of admissions, said that while
this year Brown was not able to afford
to adhere to a strict aid-blind policy,
the quality of the class did not suffer.
"We do go through the admissions
process without looking at the fi
nances for about 95 percent of the
class, and in that way we got all of the

clear admits.
"We admitted about 2450, leaving
100 or so spaces in the class. This year,
for the first time, we asked, 'How is
the aid budget doing?'," Rogers said.
"Since the applicant pool doesn't
change drastically from year to year,
we then looked to see if we had the
same general number — of quarter
backs, classicists, engineers and so
forth — as last year. Where the need
for students in that borderline group
was low and the aid they needed was
high, they weren't admitted," he
said.
"No scenarios for dropping the
policy (here) have been created,"
Warner said. "It really hasn't been
considered."

divide recipients of financial aid into
several categories which determine
the percentage of aid from each
source.
The 5 to 10 percent of each enter
ing class which the Office of Ad
missions deems the most academ
ically outstanding is placed into one
group, generally not expected to get
jobs during the school year, though
some do anyway to lower their loan
liability, DeAnda said.
Students who come to Stanford on
athletic scholarships are also handled
separately; the proportion of gift aid
which they receive is generally larg
er, and is usually financed by the
Buck or Cardinal Clubs, two alumni
backed groups which provide athlet
ic scholarships.
One feature of most under
graduate aid packages, the expecta

tion of self-help, varies widely from
school to school. At Harvard, for ex
ample, every student who receives fi
nancial aid is expected to get a job
during the term, according to a fi
nancial aid officer there.
As at Stanford, Brown and Cal
Tech, a typical job obligation at
Harvard is 10 hours per week; Welles
ley College students average six
hours per week, according to Welles
ley Financial Aids Director Amy
Nychis. At Cal Tech, however,
freshmen are not allowed to hold
jobs during the school year and must
borrow the $2700 self-help figure ex
pected there, according to Sterling
Huntley, Cal Tech director of ad
missions.
Huntley, who was an associate
dean of admissions here for 11 years,
said that Cal Tech is "strongly com
mitted to the aid-blind policy until
we run out of money." Before dis
carding such a policy, Huntley said,
"we would add more self-help —
currently ours is considerably lower
than MlT's expectation of $4200 per
year.
"The next step would be to give
less aid to foreign and transfer stu
dents." (Unlike Stanford, Cal Tech
now meets the full need of both for
eign students and transfers. Stanford
is one of the few private universities
which doesn't aid foreign students.)
"Ultimately we would limit the
'marginal admits,' but we're still a
long way from that," Huntley said.
From President Donald Kennedy's
strong affirmation of Stanford's com
mitment to both aid-blind ad
missions and meeting every under
graduate's demonstrated need, the
University appears to be a long way
from considering dropping it as well.
"Nothing can be more important
than for us to continue to admit stu
dents on the basis of merit alone,"
Kennedy told the Academic Council
April 9.
"Our need-blind admissions poli
cy is central to everything we do,"
Kennedy said. "It recognizes the
critical importance of our student
body to our educational objectives,
and identifies the merit and diversity
of that student body as features to
which we are fully committed."
"The bottom line is the institu
tional commitment to this policy,"
said Tim Warner, an assistant provost
for management and budget. "If they
wanted, some other institutions
could take money away from other
things and apply it to financial aid,"
he said.
Warner added that Stanford is for
tunate in that it is not as dependent
on federal aid as are private schools
located in states without strong state
scholarship programs. "We're not as
highly leveraged with regard to Pell
Grants and SEOGs, which makes our
position with regard to maintaining

the aid-blind policy much more
feasible," he said.
If the University ever had to begin
denying admission to students un
able to afford to attend, "my guess is
the quality or the class would suffer
— and the two most important parts
of a college are a first-rate faculty and
a first-rate student body," said
Hargadon.
James Rogers, Brown University di
rector of admissions, said that while
this year Brown was not able to afford
to adhere to a strict aid-blind policy,
the quality of the class did not suffer.
"We do go through the admissions
process without looking at the fi
nances for about 95 percent of the
class, and in that way we got all of the

clear admits.
"We admitted about 2450, leaving
100 or so spaces in the class. This year,
for the first time, we asked, 'How is
the aid budget doing?'," Rogers said.
"Since the applicant pool doesn't
change drastically from year to year,
we then looked to see if we had the
same general number — of quarter
backs, classicists, engineers and so
forth — as last year. Where the need
for students in that borderline group
was low and the aid they needed was
high, they weren't admitted," he
said.
"No scenarios for dropping the
policy (here) have been created,"
Warner said. "It really hasn't been
considered."
Despite poor economic conditions
and proposed federal budget cuts,
Dean of Admissions Fred Hargadon
said the University will remain com
mitted to its aid-blind admissions pol
icy.
Stanford is among the few of the
nation's more than 3000 four-year
colleges and universities still able to
assure all undergraduate applicants
equal consideration, and to guaran
tee that all admitted students will
have enough money to pay for an
education.
University officials are so com
mitted to the program that, accord
ing to Vince DeAnda, assistant direc
tor of financial aids, "We're not even
looking at an alternative, and as far
ahead as we can see, we don't need
to find one."
Wesleyan University in Mid
dletown, Conn., was the most recent
well-known institution to drop its
aid-blind policy, and the several
dozen schools that retain the policy
face the dilemma of fulfilling their
promises with shrinking funds.
No college claims to meet student
financial need solely by gift aid (mon
ey which students need not repay).
Like several other schools, Stanford
requires students to meet a portion
of their expenses via self-help, such
as on-campus jobs or loans: here that
sum averages 25 percent of the aid
package, according to DeAnda.
However, the University does
divide recipients of financial aid into
several categories which determine
the percentage of aid from each
source.
The 5 to 10 percent of each enter
