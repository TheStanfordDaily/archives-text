# Procedures changed for this week's election
## 
### Kathy Bodovitz Senior staff writer 
Following the plethora of com
plaints about the April 14-15 ASSU
election, Elections Commissioner
Barry (8.J.) Beal and assistant Patrick
O'Reilly have instituted many
changes in the election procedures
which will be exercised again this
week. "It's going to be a very tight
election," Beal said.
Voting will take place April 28-29
on fee assessments, senior class presi
dents (run-off), a constitutional
amendment regarding fee
assessments, a nuclear freeze refer
endum and a Student Conduct Legis
lative Council representative (for
which no one has filed), Beal said.
The first change is that all voters
will be required to sign a list and give
their student identification number
so that the number of signatures can
be matched with the number of
ballots. In addition, each identi
fication card will be marked so stu
dents cannot vote twice.
In response to a complaint that a
candidate carried a box of ballots
back to the ASSU office in the last
election, Beal said he and O'Reilly
have arranged the polling schedules
such that they will be able to collect
all the boxes themselves and will be
the only ones'to handle the corn

pleted ballots.
As both a response to the com
plaints about the Meyer Library poll
being open longer than advertised,
and a measure to expedite ballot
tallying, the polls will close earlier on
the second day of voting. The latest
polls will be open until only 10 p.m.
Four new polling places will be
added in this election, all aimed at at
tracting graduate voters. The new
polls are at Terman Hall, the Law
School, the Medical School and
Green Library.
Poll watchers for the upcoming
election will be better briefed,
O'Reilly said. They attended a man
datory meeting Monday night, and
signed statements asserting that they
understood the poll watching rules
and would show up at their assigned
times.
O'Reilly also said poll watchers will
have to sign for the ballots they take
to the polls and wear badges identi
fying themselves as authorized poll
watchers.
Beat said that two extra poll
watchers will canvas the polls and
take over if any appointed watcher
for some reason does not arrive.
Two separate election pamphlets
are being made, O'Reilly said, one
with the senior class slates and one
without. He said juniors will be in
dentified by their student identi
fication number and only juniors will
be given the pamphlets with the sen
ior class slates.
All of the pamphlets will be lami
nated, O'Reily said, to keep students
from marking on the pamphlets, a
problem in the last election. Beal said
that an optional demographic ques
tion will be included, asking the stu
dent's year and residence.
Beal and O'Reilly emphasized that
the improved organization of this
election was attributed to additional
help from current ASSU members
(several of whom were candidates in
the last election and therefore could
not help).
Beal stressed the necessity of get
ting students to the polls. "It's really
crucial to get people out this time,"
he said. In order for any fee
assessments to pass, at least 20 per
cent of the total student body must
vote on that assessment and the ma
jority of the votes must be in favor of
it.
