Prehistoric leftover
This strange looking creature is a prehistoric sea turtle — these animals have not
changed in appearance since the age of dinosaurs. All species of sea turtles are con
sidered endangered species, and researchers who are still trying to understand
their unusual misratory patterns do not want to lose this "living dinosaur". Some
turtles are killed for their food or shells, and often the beaches where they nest are
destroyed so that houses can be built.
