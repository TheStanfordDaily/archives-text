SACDF Statement
The Stanford Anns Control and Disarmament Forum (SACDF) is a
campus organization dedicated to educating the Stanford Community
about the effectsa and dangers of the arms race. SACDF also hopes to
provoke discussion about possible solutions. We serve as a reliable
clearinghouse for information on the problems of arms control and
disarmament.
Arms control is.a very complex issue. Most discussion is presently
relegated to experts, in isolated forums, who use technical terminology
' which even the most educated of citizens find intimidating. SACDF
provides a forum in which more people can intelligently discuss these
issues.
To date, we have sponsored Weapons Crisis Weeks 1 and 11 , Caspar
Weinberger, John Kenneth Gailbraith, and such forums as "Ethics and
the Anns Race," and"The Psychological Causes and Consequences of
the Arms Race."
Senate Recommendation: Yes
SACDF plays a vital role in educating students on the crucial issue of
amis control and disarmament. Transending partisan politics and special
interest groups, SACDF draws from an exceptionally wide variety of
students and staff. A minimum of 3000 students have participated in
SACDF-sponsored events. Since most of its programs have been funded
by privately donated grants which will not be repeated, SACDF needs
and deserves a secure source of funding. We heartily recommend this
