Club Sports Statement
Stanford Club Sports is cocducational and exists to provide additional
opportunites in competition, instruction, and recreation for undergraduate
and graduate students, and faculty and staff in an array of sports which
arc not funded through the other areas of the Stanford Athletic
Department. With the emphasis on student initiative not only in
competition and performance but also in team management, the club
program provides participants the opportunity to shape their own
experience to a much greater degree than any other program.
The enthusiasm and team pride engendered by this environment are
readily perceived and are reflected by the fact that well over 1,300
participants within the Stanford Community curcrcntly tare part in one
or more of the 30 club sports offered.
Senate Recommendation: Yes
Thirty different sports clubs compose the Club Sports Council. The
Stanford Club Program exists to provide additional opportunities in
competition, instruction, and rccreation for undergraduates and graduates
students at Stanford. Each club provides the opportunity for students to
initiate, organize, and lead their respective clubs. Club Sports runs a
tight ship, and we are confident the the student fee dollars will be well
spent by this organization.
