# Leland Stanford Junior University Marching Band (LSJUMB) 3 Quarters
## 
### 
Band Statement:
The Stanford Band, or the Incomparable Lcland Stanford Junior
University Marching Band (LSJUMIJ) for short, is one of Stanford better
known student-run organizations. The sole aim of the LSJUMB is to
entertain students, alumni, and other members of the Stanford
Community, primarily by playing their unique music at various campus
functions and by executing field shows at football games. Additionally,
the Hand represents the University at away football games, playing for
the enjoyment of the local alumni and home crowd.
As a focal point for campus enthusiasm, the Band contributes
immeasurably to the atmosphere of Stanford and is one of Stanford's
unique assets. This year the Band is moving to rtcw styles and ideas, yet
is retaining the distinctive personality familiar with the LSJUMB. Once
again, the Band requests a three quarter fee assessment to provide for
our continued spirited appearances.
Senate Recommendation: Yes
Although the Band's "new look" became public aflcr the football season,
its new commitment to tone over loudness, cleverness over obscenity, and
musicians over "ringers" seems to indicate a new responsiveness to
concerns that the band is slipping. The Band is requesting its traditional
two quarter assessment for next year, a request that includes funds for a
road trip to ASU. In addition, the Band is requested a one quarter
assessment to cut a new record. It is our understanding that this album
will break even and that the students arc necessary to cope with the cash
flow problems surrounding record production. The income generated
from record sales should appear as an asset next year and the Band
should be seeking less direct student support. The Band's new
commitment to responsive changes and the unchanging need for the

Band to be an independent student organization compel us to
recommend a yes vote.
