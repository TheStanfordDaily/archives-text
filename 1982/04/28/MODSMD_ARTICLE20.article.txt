SEE Statement
Humanity's impact on the Karth is now seen as far more complex and
potentially devestating that ever before imagined. SEE exists as the
campus educational organization to address thes problems. SEE has
performed on all of its campaign promises: a major symposium (on Clean
Air), Earth Week, extensive residential programs spread throughout the
dorms, and publishing an Environmental Course Directory. Next year,
SKK will continue each of these programs and bring a guest professor to
campus. Alumni contact, job and internship placement, and providing a
support network for all persons concerned about the Knvironmcnt will be
the tasks for 1982-1983.
Senate Recommendation: Yes
SKK exists as a campus educational organization providing a forum for
discussion of issues relating to humanity's impact on the earth. SBK has
come throuh with all of its fall campaign promises: a clean air
symposium, Karth Week, dorm outreach programs, and the publication of
an environmental course guide. SKK's membership is growing, its
leadership will be returning, and its strong ties with professors will
continue Students voted in the Fall for a SKK program which has been
fully delivered and, assuming that students still want these programs to
continue, we recommend a yes vote.
