Chaparral Statement
The Old Boy founded die Stanford Chaparral 84 years ago. Most of us
have forgotten those happy days of freshman beanies. Big Game
bonfires, and a lack of academic rigor. Today's students arc a
sophisticated bunch, and Stanford has become a prestigious Western
University. As young men and women facing the challenges of the 80's,
we need a magazine that will keep us informed: of employment trends,
modern lifestyles, and new products. The iconoclastic rag cffccionatcly
dubbed the "Chappie" (pronounced "Happy") answers all our needs and
l*clps us to deal more effectively with our lives; the "Orientation Issue"
is free and Boffo laugh riot.
By Consensus the Stanford Chaparral is superior to the Harvard
Lampoon, the Berkeley Pelican, and all other challengers -- we like that.
The Young Student, you, the leader of tomorrow, must not neglect the
ancient one, the Old Boy now in his time of need, for il a besoin <lc
Fargent. Many Thank.
Senate Recommendation: Yos
The Stanford Chaparral is the second oldest, continously published
humor magazine in the United States -- for that matter the world. In its
84 year history, the Chappie has received two fee assessments. This is
the third. Although it is disturbing that all three fee requests have
occurred in the past three years, there is every indication that the
Chappie can turn itself around by next year. The Fxlitor and the
Business Manager have already begun the process of increasing revenues
and decreasing expenses. The Chappie provides community services such
as the break-even Saturday Movies, the quarterly liegpnck, and the free
orientation issue. The Chappie is an instruction with the institution;
your fee dollar can save it for future students.
