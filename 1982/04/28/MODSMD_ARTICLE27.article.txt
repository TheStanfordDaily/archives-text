Women's Center Statement
During the past year, the Women's Center has funded events by ethnic,
gay, and progressive political organizations, in addition to co-sponsoring
Rape Awareness Week, an ongoing women's support group, and a
women's self defense class. This Spring wc arc sponsoring two plays and
presentations by several women writers and musicians. The Center also
maintains a large library of feminist books and periodicals and offers
speakers for dorm presentations on women's isssucs.
Senate Recommendation: Neutral
The Women's Center is a valuable resource at Stanford. The Senate's
neutral endorsement stems from the fact tiiat the Center has not handled
its finances well in the past. Furthermore, there is a weighted feminist
focus in Women's Center programming which perhaps fails to reflect the
other areas of interest for a Stanlord Women. Previous years have seen
a lack of continuity in Women's Center staffers; however, next year the
turnover will be very small. l ; or this reason wc expect an increase in the
quality of financial supervision and prgramming next fall.
