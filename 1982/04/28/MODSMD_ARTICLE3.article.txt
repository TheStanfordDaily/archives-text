# Election Procedures

### 
Elections are conducted for the Association by the Elections
Commission. The Commission is in complete charge of the
election, and a member will be on call from 10:00 a.m. to 5:00
p.m., April 28 and 29, at the ASSU business offices (497-
4331). Poll watchers are officers of the Commission, and are
in complete charge of their polling stations (subject to the
rules made by the Commission).
Polls
The Elections Commission intends to keep all polls open at
the palaces and during the times advertised in this Handbook
and the Stanford Daily.
Voting
Please hand your Stanford ID to the poll watcher when you
wish to vote. Your ID will be marked and returned to you
when you arc finished voting. Please feel free to consult this
Elections Handbook (copies of which will be available at the
polls), any other materials available, or the poll watchers when
voting.
Ballots
Please read the section on how to mark your ballot carefully
before voting. Remember to use a number 2 pencil and to
press down hard. Any ballots incorrectly marked may be
declared invalid in either whole or part by the Elections
Commission.
