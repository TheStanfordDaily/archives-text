Daily Statement
While the Stanford Daily continues to generate most of its revenue
through advertising, measures to improve educational and training
benefits at the paper, namely a computer typesetting system, have placed
a serious financial drain on our operating budget. At present a fee
asscssmcntm it vital toward allowing us to continue publishing the paper
on a daily basis and distributing it freely on campus. This assessment
totals less than 2 cents per issue. It costs us nearly 12 cents per copy for
paper printing and typesetting and an additional 14 cents per copy for
labor, supplies, insurance, and utilities. Therefore, this assessment covers
less than 8% of our direct costs -- please help us.
Senate Recommendation: Yes
The Stanford Daily has requested that the student body take out a bulk
subscription to its publication, amounting to one dollar per student per
quarter. The external benefits of a daily publication, we believe, are
substantial enough to recommend such a subscription. Moreover, the
Daily's financial performance has been down over the last two years and
is expected to fall below expectation until their new computer has been
fully paid off. And yet, the computer is only part of the problem behind
the Daily's poor financial performance. Rising costs of production, a
desire to keep advertising rates at a level accessible to student
organizations, and inadequate management in the past have all
contributed to the Daily's current situation. The Stanford Daily seems to
have the situation under control this year. They have stabilized their
financial position, created enduring systems of measurement and control
for the diture, and has set the Daily on a course for success. The
combination of the Daily's direct and indirect benefits to students at
Stanford, and the Daily's financial need for support from the student
body, compels us to recommend a yes vote.
