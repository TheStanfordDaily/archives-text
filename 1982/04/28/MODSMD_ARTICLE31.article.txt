# Stanford Committee on Political Education (SCOPE) 1 Quarter

SCOPE Statement
The Stanford Committee on Political Education (SCOPH) sponsors
nationally known political figures to address the Stanford Community on
issues of current political interest. This provides students and others the
opportunity to hear and interface with noted leaders and professors in a
non-classroom environment. In addition, we sponsor and help co
ordinate the speaking and educational programs of politically oriented
student run organizations oil campus lacking adequate ftmding. Through
Winter Quarter 1982, SCOPH sponsored speeches by Rep. Morris Udall
Senator William Proxmire, Defense Secretary Caspar Weinberger and co
sponsorcd the Phyllis Schlally-Catherinc Mackinnon debate and former
CIA agent John Stockwell.
Senate Recommendation: Yes
SCOPE was almost extinct last year. This year SCOPE has experienced a
revival. Membership is way up from last year and the addition of
freshman and sophmorcs to the leadership of the organization seems to
have secured continuity for the group. In addition, SCOPH, in response
to the Senate's concern that they were spending too much money in co
sponsorship and allocations, has used its last fee assessment on SCOPF
and SCOPH speaking engagements. The leadership of the organization
has managed to turn SCOPH around this year, their performance is
beyond our expectation, and we therefore recommcnd a yes vote.
