The scope of the class presidents' duties include organizing all of the
major social functions for seniors such as Casino Night, pub nights,
and senior brunches. They also play a major role in corrdinating
graduation and planning class day. The presidents serve as class repre
sentatives at alumni and faculty functions, and one member of the slate
serves on the board of trustees of Stanford and another is a member of
the trustee nominating committee which also chooses the graduation
speaker. As senior class presidents, a major duty is to be in contact
with the other members of our class in order to find out their ideas
and desires and also to keep them informed about activities and
opportunities available to them on campus. We would hold the
responsibility of coming up with ideas and taking the initiative to plan
and provide activities in which seniors can derive benefit, learn, and
have a great time.
We feel that seniors are most concerned with their futures while at the
same time desiring to have a fun and active last year at Stanford. In
order to help the members of our class find post graduate oppor
tunities, we propose to start a newsletter that would be sent to all
seniors. This would inform them of the different job search oppor
tunities and services available to them and how to go about using
them. This also would include a senior calendar with important
deadline dates listed, as well as social functions and activities. To pro
vide entertainment we have several proposed festivities including a
senior ski trip and casino night at Tahoe, and a Last-Chance Full Moon
party. We also plan to continue the already traditional and successful
parties and events.
As a slate we feel we have an enthusiastic and dedicated group of
people with diverse interests and backgrounds (one Japanese RA, one
Italian thespian, one retired swimmer turned Zete, and one small-town
lowan). We are able to work well together with the organization
necessary to carry out our responsibilities efficiently. We psssess the
energy and drive to generate the enthusiasm needed to make our
social functions a success, and we feel we are a strong group that can
represent our class well. We can make it better with

The duties of the Senior Class Presidents lie in four major areas. The
first of these is to plan and organize social activities for the class.
Among our plans are the traditional Senior bashes such as Casino
Night, Halloween parties, and Pub Nights. We would also organize
additional functions providing other means of entertainment and
increased senior interaction. Some of our ideas include a Senior
Formal, Senior-sponsored Concert, Boathouse Bar-B-Ques and a
Senior Ditch Day.
A second responsibility is to provide the opportunity for seniors to
discuss and get advice on their future plans from faculty and alumni.
We view faculty and alumni input as a valuable and available resource
that students rarely tap. Through brunches and informal discussion
groups, seniors well be able to get better acquainted with faculty and
become.more comfortable in discussing their future options and
goals.
Furthermore, in order to provide the activities and opportunities that
the senior class wants, we plan to send out an interest survey and a
class newsletter to get feedback from our classmates. A newsletter will
also serve to keep our class informed, tell them what we are doing and
planning so that all who wish to, may participate.
Finally, we feel it is our responsibility to raise the funds to finance our
proposed activities. Local business and corporate sponsorship for
activities and concerts are examples of fund raising tactics we will use.
We consider ourselves to be an energetic slate with a core of solid,
realistic ideas. Our three main objectives are (1) to create a series of
fun social events that will be diverse in nature and will appeal to a wide
cross section of the senior class; (2) to organize and execute faculty
and alumni senior get-togethers in both structured and informal
settings to help students feci t.iore comfortable with their faculty and
their futures; and (3) to invorporate channels of communications that
enable us, as class presidents, to know what the interests and con
cerns of our classmates are so we can better act on them. Class
participation in our decision making will be encouraged both to
make our job more effective and satisfactory to seniors.
