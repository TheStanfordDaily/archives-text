# Academic Organizations Board (AOB) 3 Quarters
## 
### 
Senate Recommendation: Yes
The AOB was almost dissolved this year. The Board's performance
under their new By-Laws has been admirable. In addition to handling
their own allocations, the Board has become involved in co-operative
programming and intends to present a "Why Study ?" scries
this Spring. The Board is experiencing a revival this year and we have
increased its fee assessment to include an additional quarter of funding in
order to accommodate graduate academic organizations which currently
do not belong to the Board. In addition, the Board's new concern with
programming will ncrcasc their expenses in the next acadcmic year. We
rccommcnd a yes vote.
