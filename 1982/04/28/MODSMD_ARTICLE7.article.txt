# ASSU Program Fee 3 Quarters
## 
### 
Senate Recommendation: Yes
The Program Fee provides operational and programming expenses to
smaller organizations a Stanford. Over two hundred organizations
qualify for Program l ; cc funding, although only 25 to 30 apply, on the
average. In the past we have not been able to fund organizations for
much more than operating expenses and, for this reason, we have added
a third quarter to this assessment to meet these organization's need for
programming dollars. The Senate allocates this money at two times
during the year -- once in Spring and then again in the Fall. In
addition, all year long, the Finance Committee provides discretionary
funds for innovative and traditional projects. The importance of funding
these small organizations cannot be overstated, and we therefore
recommend a yes vote.
