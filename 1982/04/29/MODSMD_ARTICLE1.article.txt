# Possible magnetic monopole detected
## 
### Mike Thurman Senior staff writer 
The scientific community stirred yesterday with
the announcement that Senior Research Associate
Bias Cabrera may have detected the presence of a
monopole — a magnetic particle predicted in
physics theory more than 50 years ago, but still un
verified by researchers.
Cabrera reported that on Feb. 14 at 1:53 p.m. a
change occured in the electric current flowing
through his makeshift superconducting detector
in the Varian Physics Laboratory that was not un
like a reading that would indicate the presence of a
monopole.
The possible detection is important because, al
though scientists have often theorized on the ex
istence of a basic unit of magnetism that is positive
ly or negatively charged, researchers have failed to
perform verified detections of monopoles.
In a paper submitted for publication to Physical
Review Letters, Cabrera said that he has eliminated
nearly every other possible explanation for the un
usual reading, although he said he cannot "de
finitively say it was a monopole" as a result of the

occurrence of the single, isolated event.
"We've only seen one event in 185 days running
time," Cabrera said. "That makes it extremely dif
ficult to do the kind of checks that one can do in a
typical low-temperature experiment."
According to Peter Michelson, a physical sci
ences research associate, the reading taken by
Cabrera is "not a discovery as of yet, but simply an
unconfirmed interesting event."
Michelson said that if the experiment can be
successfully replicated, the discovery of the
monopole would be "one of the most fundamen
tal discoveries in physics in 100 years."
He said that the best way to understand
monopoles is to consider breaking a magnet with
its north and south poles into two. Although bro
ken, the properties of a magnet are such that each
piece of the magnet would continue to have the
two poles.
In contrast, "monopole means it's a single pole
of magnetic charge. It's like only having a north
pole or only having a south pole," Michelson said.
"Nobody's ever seen an isolated magnetic
charge, and if this particle exists, that's the main

property it has that distinguishes it from all other
kinds of matter. Its just fundamentally new, never
having been verifiably seen before."
Michelson said that the existence of monopoles
is important with respect to several theories of
physics, including a class of theories known as the
Grand Unification Theory of Fundamental Interac
tions.
The Grand Unification Theory, according to
Michelson, attempts to unify the interactions of
the three forces of nature observed as the strong
force (which binds atoms together), the weak
force (radioactive decay) and electromagnetic
energy into a single interaction at some very high
energy level.
"What we see in our ordinary world at low
energy," Michelson said, "is just essentially a
breaking of a symmetry that manifests itself as elec
tromagnetic interaction, weak interaction and
strong interaction. But really they're man
ifestations of a single infraction."

made by the Grand Unification The
ory are the decay of protons and the
existence of monopoles. (Although
complex experiments are being con
ducted, no detection of the decay of
protons has been reported.)
A team of scientists led by Buford
Price at U.C.-Berkeley claimed to
have detected a monopole in 1975
but Price's experiment was not veri
fied by subsequent attempts, and the
scientific community continued to
regard the monopole as a theoretical
structure.
Michelson said that monopoles
have several interesting character
istics that are unusual in comparison
to other fundamental particles. Sci
entists believe that monopoles con
sist of an extremely large mass,
weighing nearly as much as a bac
terium.
The second expected character
istic of a monopole is that, due to its
size and the fact that there is no

known force in the universe capable
of carrying such mass at velocities ap
proaching the speed of light, it is very
slow.
A third characteristic, which has
contributed to the difficulties re
searchers have had in detecting
monopoles, is that a monopole is be
lieved to have the capability to pass
through matter without causing any
great disturbance.
Due to lack of funding, Cabrera
borrowed equipment from other re
searchers to perform his potential
breakthrough experiment. He has
since applied for funds from the Na
tional Science Foundation and the
Department of Energy in order to
continue his experiments.
In conducting his experiments,
Cabrera used a two-inch diameter
loop of the element niobium to de
termine the presence of monopoles.
Cooled to a temperature of 4.2 Kelvin
(4.2 degrees above the absolute Zero
— Zero Kelvin equals -273 C or -459.4
F), the loop becomes a super
conductor of electricity which is then
measured to indicate the presence of
a monopole.

piece of the magnet would continue to have the
two poles.
In contrast, "monopole means it's a single pole
of magnetic charge. It's like only having a north
pole or only having a south pole," Michelson said.
"Nobody's ever seen an isolated magnetic
charge, and if this particle exists, that's the main

property it has that distinguishes it from all other
kinds of matter. Its just fundamentally new, never
having been verifiably seen before."
Michelson said that the existence of monopoles
is important with respect to several theories of
physics, including a class of theories known as the
Grand Unification Theory of Fundamental Interac
tions.
The Grand Unification Theory, according to
Michelson, attempts to unify the interactions of
the three forces of nature observed as the strong
force (which binds atoms together), the weak
force (radioactive decay) and electromagnetic
energy into a single interaction at some very high
energy level.
"What we see in our ordinary world at low
energy," Michelson said, "is just essentially a
breaking of a symmetry that manifests itself as elec
tromagnetic interaction, weak interaction and
strong interaction. But really they're man
ifestations of a single infraction."
Michelson said that among the predictions

made by the Grand Unification The
ory are the decay of protons and the
existence of monopoles. (Although
complex experiments are being con
ducted, no detection of the decay of
protons has been reported.)
A team of scientists led by Buford
Price at U.C.-Berkeley claimed to
have detected a monopole in 1975
but Price's experiment was not veri
fied by subsequent attempts, and the
scientific community continued to
regard the monopole as a theoretical
structure.
Michelson said that monopoles
have several interesting character
istics that are unusual in comparison
to other fundamental particles. Sci
entists believe that monopoles con
sist of an extremely large mass,
weighing nearly as much as a bac
terium.
The second expected character
istic of a monopole is that, due to its
size and the fact that there is no

known force in the universe capable
of carrying such mass at velocities ap
proaching the speed of light, it is very
slow.
A third characteristic, which has
contributed to the difficulties re
searchers have had in detecting
monopoles, is that a monopole is be
lieved to have the capability to pass
through matter without causing any
great disturbance.
Due to lack of funding, Cabrera
borrowed equipment from other re
searchers to perform his potential
breakthrough experiment. He has
since applied for funds from the Na
tional Science Foundation and the
Department of Energy in order to
continue his experiments.
In conducting his experiments,
Cabrera used a two-inch diameter
loop of the element niobium to de
termine the presence of monopoles.
Cooled to a temperature of 4.2 Kelvin
(4.2 degrees above the absolute Zero
— Zero Kelvin equals -273 C or -459.4
F), the loop becomes a super
conductor of electricity which is then
measured to indicate the presence of
a monopole.
The scientific community stirred yesterday with
the announcement that Senior Research Associate
Bias Cabrera may have detected the presence of a
monopole — a magnetic particle predicted in
physics theory more than 50 years ago, but still un
verified by researchers.
Cabrera reported that on Feb. 14 at 1:53 p.m. a
change occured in the electric current flowing
through his makeshift superconducting detector
in the Varian Physics Laboratory that was not un
like a reading that would indicate the presence of a
monopole.
The possible detection is important because, al
though scientists have often theorized on the ex
istence of a basic unit of magnetism that is positive
ly or negatively charged, researchers have failed to
perform verified detections of monopoles.
In a paper submitted for publication to Physical
Review Letters, Cabrera said that he has eliminated
nearly every other possible explanation for the un
usual reading, although he said he cannot "de
finitively say it was a monopole" as a result of the

occurrence of the single, isolated event.
"We've only seen one event in 185 days running
time," Cabrera said. "That makes it extremely dif
ficult to do the kind of checks that one can do in a
typical low-temperature experiment."
According to Peter Michelson, a physical sci
ences research associate, the reading taken by
Cabrera is "not a discovery as of yet, but simply an
unconfirmed interesting event."
Michelson said that if the experiment can be
successfully replicated, the discovery of the
monopole would be "one of the most fundamen
tal discoveries in physics in 100 years."
He said that the best way to understand
monopoles is to consider breaking a magnet with
its north and south poles into two. Although bro
ken, the properties of a magnet are such that each
piece of the magnet would continue to have the
two poles.
In contrast, "monopole means it's a single pole
of magnetic charge. It's like only having a north
pole or only having a south pole," Michelson said.

charge, and if this particle exists, that's the main
