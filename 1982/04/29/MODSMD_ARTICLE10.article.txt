# Costa Rica arms forces

### Washington Post 
San )o*e, Costa Rica — Less than three years
ago, police officers walking the beat in what was
then the relaxed little democracy of Costa Rica
were known to carry screwdrivers in their
holsters instead of pistols. The screwdrivers were
used to remove the license plates of parking vio
lators.
Today, the holsters are filled with .38-caliber
revolvers, and many of the 7000 members of
Costa Rica's security forces soon may have
American M-16 automatic rifles slung over their
shoulders.
Costa Rica is still a democracy, but it is no
longer relaxed.
A handful of terrorist incidents, a collapsing
economy, organized crime and fears of
domestic political unrest, the increasing vio
lence of the region as a whole and particularly
the long shadow of Nicaragua's growing military
to the north may soon lead this country to
create, with the help of Washington and perhaps
other Western nations, something very like an
army.
No one (jses that word, of course. Costa Ricans
have a longstanding aversion to so much as the
suggestion of conventional armed forces.
Given the coup-ridden history of Latin Ameri
ca, Costa Ricans argue that it is the absence of an
army that has ensured the development of their
unique democracy.
The democratic Costa Rican system represents
politically what the Reagan administration says it
wants for all of the Caribbean region.
But there was a major uproar here last August
when American Ambassador to the United Na
tions Jeane Kirkpatrick publicly mentioned U.S.
willingness to supply "military assistance" along
with economic aid to this country to defend it
from "destabilization."
The matter of arming Costa Rica is especially
sensitive since the Reagan administration has
sought to isolate revolutionary Nicaragua to the
north, regional tensions have grown and
Nicaraguan leaders say that any serious military
effort to overthrow them would cause violence
throughout Central America.
Without an army, Costa Rica would find itself
militarily helpless to respond to any serious spill
over of regional fighting or a major attempt to
mount subversive actions within its borders.
No one here believes there is a threat of an im

minent Nicaraguan invasion. The concern i»
about potential trouble in an increasingly vol
atile environment and a possible intimidation of
Costa Rica.
There is much concern about provoking
Nicaragua's Sandinistas and for that reason many
Costa Ricans do not want to form an army.
Currently, relations with Nicaragua are cool
and correct, although among members of the
incoming government and on the street one
often hears bitter regret about the course of the
Nicaraguan revolution, which many Costa Ri
cans actively supported three years ago.
There is a serious worry that arms supply
networks and connections made to aid the Sand
inistas in their struggle to overthrow dictator
Anastasio Somoza could be turned against Costa
Rica.
These concerns combine with dark worries
about how far Costa Rica's democracy and
pacifism can be pushed given the rising econom
ic and social difficulties.
"The fundamental threat here is external,"
said Alfonso Carro, who will take over as the
minister of governance when the Monge admin
istration is sworn in May 8.
But Carro added in a recent interview that "in
the cellars of Costa Rican society there are very
dangerous elements."
Carro, 58, a lawyer who is often talked of as
presidential material in the National Liberation
Party, said he was impressed with the judgment
of a former public security minister who recently
told him, "this country is completely unaware of
the forces operating beneath the surface ...
completely unaware, really, of the volcano
below."
The steady deterioration of the Costa Rican
economy has had much to do with whatever
rumblings have thus far become apparent.
Conventional crime has risen dramatically
over the last three years as inflation has soared
above 100 percent by some estimates and the
Costa Rican colon, long artifically pegged at 8.50
to the dollar now trades at more than 50 to the
dollar.
Organized crime also has moved into Costa
Rica. This narrow country just north of drug
dominated Colombia and just south of the Cen
tral American wars has become a major base of
operations for cocaine-traffickers and gun
runners.

Organized crime also has moved into Costa
Rica. This narrow country just north of drug
dominated Colombia and just south of the Cen

operations for cocaine-traffickers and gun
runners.
