## Breaking into business... Frozen yogurt store opens in Tresidder 
### Karen Springen 
Attention frozen yogurt addicts: do your legs get tired bicyling
all the way to the Stanford Shopping Center to satisfy your craving
for that ice-cold delicacy?
Now, The Corner Pocket in Tresidder will prevent further phys
ical suffering and hunger pangs by providing frozen yogurt daily.
Three student entrepreneurs, appointed by Tresidder, will man
age the food service.
In addition to frozen yogurt, the student-run enterprise will
feature pizza by the slice, fresh salads and quiche on occasion.
The Corner Pocket location is the result of recent Tresidder re
modelling.
According to junior Dan Burgess, one of the three en
trepreneurs, The Corner Pocket is currently scheduled to operate
from 11:30 a.m. to 11:30 p.m. "We'll end up locking up (Tresidder)
a few nights," he said. Burgess emphasized that exact hours are
tentative, however.
According to Greg Larson, assistant director of Tresidder, The
Corner Pocket's expanded hours should increase Tresidder's role
as a social center. "Meyer can go back to being a library," he said.
Larson said the experimental project is in response to heavy stu
dent demand. "There's an increasng entrepreneurial interest
among students," he said.
Last quarter, five groups interested in running frozen yogurt
operations approached him within a 24-hour period, said Larson.
The demand appeared to be there, he said. Four groups sub
mitted proposals in late February for operation of The Corner
Pocket. After interviewing the candidates and reviewing the pro
posals, Tresidder awarded the contract to Burgess, junior Sally
Boyce and junior Steve Francis.
According to Burgess, his group met at Cliveden last fall. When
they returned here, they did the cost research necessary to submit
a proposal.
The trial project is the only one of its type, said Larson. It is set up
so that students are risking time rather than money, he said.
"We link the students' success with the amount of money they
receive." Under this philosophy, students receive a percent of to
tal sales.
In effect, students provide management, labor and marketing,
while Tresidder and Servomation foot the bill for utilities, equip
ment and food.
Larson emphasized, "We wouldn't be doing it if we didn't think
it would be successful."
Larson cited his role as a consumer advocate in Tresidder's rela
tions with student-run operations such as the Coffee House. Oth
er entrepreneurial businesses affiliated with Tresidder include
the daily Big Way Yacht Club barbecue burger table in front of the
Tresidder patio.

According to Larson, three major advantages to students which
both The Corner Pocket and the Big Way Yacht Club entreprises
offer are the low financial investment, the managerial responsi
bility and the entrepreneurial linkage.
The Corner Pocket should help Tresidder better meet popular
needs. "We'll be a lot more responsive to students," said Larson.
"The more you have students involved, the more students like it."
For those yogurt aficionados who want precise details, the
group plans to offer two flavors daily. Flavors will alternate.
Burgess estimated that five toppings will also be available.
According to Larson, The Corner Pocket represents about a
$25,000 total investment. "We're making a pretty big investment,
and we really hope it works," he said. If the project is successful, It
may be expanded, said Larson.
Tresidder currently contracts out to Servomation, Marcel's and
the Coffee House, Inc. The Office of Student Affairs directs Tres
idder itself.
