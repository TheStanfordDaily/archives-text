# Students restart service
## Campus dry cleaning arrives 
### Karen Springen 
A new service here may help students iron out
some of their problems â€” at least those that are
laundry-related.
On-Campus Cleaners Inc., a student-run busi
ness, opened earlier this month in the Old Fire
house.
According to senior Steven Brown, president
of On-Campus Cleaners, it is the same dry
cleaning business as the service which operated
out of Mirrieles for three weeks last spring quar
ter.
The entrepreneurs chose dry-cleaning after
taking a marketing survey last year. A dry-clean
ing service was the biggest student demand, said
Brown. (A late night food service finished sec
ond.)
In addition, the dry-cleaning business could
be incorporated, ensuring that no single individ
ual is held legally responsible should the com
pany fail.
On-Campus Cleaners subcontracts to Cres
cent Cleaners in East Palo Alto. According to
John Bennett, On-Campus Cleaners' general
manager, Crescent taughthim the basics of run
ning a laundry operation such as properly tag
ging clothes.
Brown said the service is not yet turning a prof
it. But last year the service made about $100 prof
it a week, he said.

Brown cited several advantages of dry-clean
ing: clothes last twice as long, shrink less, look
nicer, and fade less than when laundered. In ad
dition, the cleaning agent is less harsh than de
tergent, he said.
The business is sponsored by the Black Busi
ness Society and the Student Association for the
Advancement of Black Enterprise. It should con
tinue under the Black Business Society next year,
said Brown.
Bennett stressed that the business provides
"good experience in managing a whole en
terprise."
Brown also emphasized that aspect, particu
larly since the University offers no under
graduate business major.
Both entrepreneurs said that most starting
businesses fail, and so they feel fortunate to have
the opportunity to experiment on a small scale
now.
Students involved in the business include sen
ior Tim Daniels, senior Hosea Beltram, and sen
ior Shelly Sanders.
The managers don't want students to feel
"pressed" into using their service. But they do
plan to step up advertising.
They said that On-Campus Cleaners is less ex
pensive than other area dry cleaners. They offer
three-day service.
Prices range from $2.50 for a shirt to $5.50 for a
two-piece suit and $6.75 for a three-piece suit.
