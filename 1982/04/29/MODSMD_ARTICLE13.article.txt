## Viewpoint/John Sage Stop uprooting Native Americans 
### 
Decision makers within the federal
government have long shown an in
sensitlvity toward the Native Ameri
can. Insensltlvity marks the historical
injustice that has translated into a
series of court decisions that have
deprived Native Americans of much
of their original homeland. The Nava
jo, largest of this country's some 150
Indian tribes, have suffered con
siderable loss and degradation in the
last century at the hands of U.S. law
makers.
The most tragic event in Navajo
history is known as The Long Walk, a
reference to the 19th century re
moval of 8500 tribesmen from their
Arizona home to internment at Fort
Sumner, N. Mex. Today, the Navajo
are faced with another tragedy, one
so potentially great that many are re
ferring to it as the Second Long Walk.
The Second Long Walk is how
many Navajos are terming the forced
relocation provision of the recently
decided Hopi-Navajo land dispute. A
brief history of the land dispute is
necessary for a clearer under
standing of the relocation problem.
The Navajo and Hopi have lived as
neighbors on some 2.5 million acres
of reservation land in northeastern
Arizona for more than a century. As
violent clashes and territorial dis
putes between the two tribes in
creased, Congress directed the tribes
to federal court for grievance resolu
tion. In 1962, a special three judge
court ruled that 1.8 million acres of
the land was to be designated a Joint
Use Area (JUA), a large buffer zone
between the two reservations that
was to be used by both tribes. The
court did not petition the area.
After witnessing continuing dis
agreement and dissention between
the Navajo and Hopi, Congress au
thorized a federal court to partition
the 1.8 million JUA acres. The
judgment, handed down in 1979,
split the land in a manner that placed
9500 Navajos on "the wrong side of
the fence" while fewer tnan 100
Hopis were on land partitioned to
the Navajos. The following year,
Congress enacted the now infamous
PL 96-305, which called for the re
location of Navajos from lands
awarded the Hopi Tribe and vice ver
sa. HL 96-305 is a solution that is
neither viable nor humane, for it ig

nores the attendant costs of reloca
tion and more importantly, the seri
ous effects relocation will have on
the Navajo people.
Although Congress appropriated
$37 million for the removal of the
Navajo people, it is now estimated
that the relocation of the 9500 af
fected will cost taxpayers a half
billion dollars. Experts note that
these projected expenditures are es
timates of direct costs only and that
the final cost of relocation could
climb as high as $700 million. While
the outrageous costs associated with
the move are likely to spark criticism,
there are more important factors to
be taken into account — factors
which make it imperative that the

It is difficult for most to com
prehend the great importance which
Navajos attach to their land. Prying
them from their territory is analgous
to pulling someone from a life sup
port machine. In a 1981 report to
Congress, experts reported that re
location caused severe psychological
problems such as mental illness, de
pression, loneliness and physi
ological problems such as de
terioration of health. Dr. Thayer
Scudder, a Cal Tech anthropologist,
warned that "the human costs of
compulsory relocation for Navajos
have been seriously under
estimated."
He said in a detailed study that

"loss of land through relocation
deprives Navajos of their birthright,
their livelihood, proper social rela
tionship and upsets the order of na
ture." His findings have been well
documented to date: 25 percent of
the families who have al
ready relocated have suffered seri
ous financial problems, severe de
pression and suicidal tendencies.
Navajos scheduled to be moved are
seeking psychological counseling at
eight times the rate of other Navajos.
Certain members of the tribe have
been especially hard hit. The resi
dents of Big Mountain, Ariz, are gen
erally older and more traditional
than many in the tribe. Their govern
ing resolution states, "If we are every
physically and destructively moved
from our land by the United States
government, we, the people, will
waste away."
Indeed, government action poses
a direct threat to the religious free
dom of the Navajos of Big Mountain.
The Mountain is considered sacred
and a standing temple to the an
cestors of the residents. It is central to
their religion, their reason for being
and a shrine to which they pray. Forc
ing these people to leave would vio
late their Constitutional rights under
the Free Exercise of Religion clause
of the First Amendment and ignore
the intent of the American Indian Re
ligious Freedom Act.
Clearly, a solution must be reached
that will allow the Navajos threat
ened with relocation to stay on the
land that is so vital to their existence.
Three alternatives to compulsory re
location, repeal of law, buyout of
Hopi interest and land exchange,
would cost the government far less
than relocation and allow the Navajo
to continue living in harmony with
the land.
Government decisionmakers must
recognize the religious attachment
that Native Americans have to their
land and consider the plight these
citizens will be in if their means of
cultural survival is taken away. It is
time for U.S. officials to stop the
deplorable policy of uprooting and
relocating the Native American Indi
an.

It is difficult for most to com
prehend the great importance which
Navajos attach to their land. Prying
them from their territory is analgous
to pulling someone from a life sup
port machine. In a 1981 report to
Congress, experts reported that re
location caused severe psychological
problems such as mental illness, de
pression, loneliness and physi
ological problems such as de
terioration of health. Dr. Thayer
Scudder, a Cal Tech anthropologist,
warned that "the human costs of
compulsory relocation for Navajos
have been seriously under
estimated."
He said in a detailed study that

"loss of land through relocation
deprives Navajos of their birthright,
their livelihood, proper social rela
tionship and upsets the order of na
ture." His findings have been well
documented to date: 25 percent of
the families who have al
ready relocated have suffered seri
ous financial problems, severe de
pression and suicidal tendencies.
Navajos scheduled to be moved are
seeking psychological counseling at
eight times the rate of other Navajos.
Certain members of the tribe have
been especially hard hit. The resi
dents of Big Mountain, Ariz, are gen
erally older and more traditional
than many in the tribe. Their govern
ing resolution states, "If we are every
physically and destructively moved
from our land by the United States
government, we, the people, will
waste away."
Indeed, government action poses
a direct threat to the religious free
dom of the Navajos of Big Mountain.
The Mountain is considered sacred
and a standing temple to the an
cestors of the residents. It is central to
their religion, their reason for being
and a shrine to which they pray. Forc
ing these people to leave would vio
late their Constitutional rights under
the Free Exercise of Religion clause
of the First Amendment and ignore
the intent of the American Indian Re
ligious Freedom Act.
Clearly, a solution must be reached
that will allow the Navajos threat
ened with relocation to stay on the
land that is so vital to their existence.
Three alternatives to compulsory re
location, repeal of law, buyout of
Hopi interest and land exchange,
would cost the government far less
than relocation and allow the Navajo
to continue living in harmony with
the land.
Government decisionmakers must
recognize the religious attachment
that Native Americans have to their
land and consider the plight these
citizens will be in if their means of

relocating the Native American Indi
an.

Decision makers within the federal
government have long shown an in
sensitlvity toward the Native Ameri
can. Insensltlvity marks the historical
injustice that has translated into a
series of court decisions that have
deprived Native Americans of much
of their original homeland. The Nava
jo, largest of this country's some 150
Indian tribes, have suffered con
siderable loss and degradation in the
last century at the hands of U.S. law
makers.
The most tragic event in Navajo
history is known as The Long Walk, a
reference to the 19th century re
moval of 8500 tribesmen from their
Arizona home to internment at Fort
Sumner, N. Mex. Today, the Navajo
are faced with another tragedy, one
so potentially great that many are re
ferring to it as the Second Long Walk.
The Second Long Walk is how
many Navajos are terming the forced
relocation provision of the recently
decided Hopi-Navajo land dispute. A
brief history of the land dispute is
necessary for a clearer under
standing of the relocation problem.
The Navajo and Hopi have lived as
neighbors on some 2.5 million acres
of reservation land in northeastern
Arizona for more than a century. As
violent clashes and territorial dis
putes between the two tribes in
creased, Congress directed the tribes
to federal court for grievance resolu
tion. In 1962, a special three judge
court ruled that 1.8 million acres of
the land was to be designated a Joint
Use Area (JUA), a large buffer zone
between the two reservations that
was to be used by both tribes. The
court did not petition the area.
After witnessing continuing dis
agreement and dissention between
the Navajo and Hopi, Congress au
thorized a federal court to partition
the 1.8 million JUA acres. The
judgment, handed down in 1979,
split the land in a manner that placed
9500 Navajos on "the wrong side of
the fence" while fewer tnan 100
Hopis were on land partitioned to
the Navajos. The following year,
Congress enacted the now infamous
PL 96-305, which called for the re
location of Navajos from lands
awarded the Hopi Tribe and vice ver
sa. HL 96-305 is a solution that is
neither viable nor humane, for it ig
