# Frosting at the mouth over Elton's trip to yellow brick school
## 
### 
It started off like just another Tuesday morning. I was
lumbering through the breakfast line, getting my usual
two eggs, hash browns, orange juice and glazed
doughnut with the red and green sprinkly things on top.
I guess I was preoccupied with many of the same
thoughts that all of us share early on a Tuesday morning:
Will I get to class on time? Will the three men aboard the
space shuttle next April close their eyes when the first
female astronaut needs to use the toilet? What do you
call that little indentation above your upper lip and
below your nose?
Suddenly, as I casually flipped open my Daily, none of
that seemed to matter any more. The headline on the
right side of the page screamed out at me and sent a chill
up and down my spine and out of my shoes: "Elton John
concert awaits confirmation."

Elton John coming to Stanford I The real Elton John.
The "Goodbye Yellow Brick Road" Elton John. The
"Crocodile Rock" Elton John. The Elton John with the
pink sunglasses. I was so overcome with excitement that I
momentarily forgot that I don't even like Elton John. No
matter. A full-fledged star was coming to Stanford to give
a concert, and that's something to write home about
(and I haven't written home in three years).
I quickly sat down and began to read the rest of the
article. John would be appearing at Frost Amphitheater,
which seats more than 13,000 people. The Stanford Band
was sponsoring the concert, and they had the pre
liminary approval of the committee on campus enter
tainment. It all seemed too good to be true, and un
fortunately, it was. When I read the date on which the
concert would be held, I almost choked on my
doughnut: June 27.
June 27? It had to be a misprint. I sprinted out of the
dining room and headed for the Daily, clutching my pa
per in one hand and my doughnut in the other. "It is
true?" I cried, "Is it true? Is it really true?" Yes, I was told,
Elton John will be here on June 27 — when I'll be back in
Chicago roaming the beaches of Lake Michigan and tell-

ing high school girls that I go to Stanford.
Much later on in the day, I was able to calm myself
down and give this thing some serious thought. For the
past few years, a lot of the students have been complain
ing that there are never any concerts here. Every spring,
on a bunch of those ASSU Senate posters that infest the
campus, you always find the line, "More on-campus
concerts" (usually right after the lines, "More equitable
draw system" and "Cheaper and better food").
Now, finally, there would be a big-time concert at
Stanford. Unfortunately, although we are in school nine
months out of the year, it looks as though the concert
will be held on one of those rare days when most of us
aren't here.
At first, I'll admit, this upset me. I'm not an Elton John
fan, but I still think it would be neat to go to one of his
concerts. I haven't been to many concerts in my lifetime.
When I was very young, my mother told me that going to
concerts would stunt my growth — so I never went.
However, despite my temporary discontent, I now
think that the June 27 date isn't such a bad idea after all.
On the contrary, I think we're finally making some
progress. Think about it. First, we were all here, but there

were no concerts. Next, there'll be a concert, but none
of us will be here. Now, all we have to do Is combine the
two and take that final step: have a concert when we're
all here!
I know that's kind of a crazy, radical idea, but I think it
can work. All we have to do next time is let the Campus
Entertainment Board know that we want to have a con
cert that we can actually go to. You see, I'm not really
blaming anyone for the Elton John date. After all, none
of us ever specifically said that we wanted a concert
while we were here.
I'm just worried about the precedent that this might
establish. For instance? if the speakers' bureau starts
scheduling their events like this, the next time I open up
my Daily at breakfast I may read the following: "Presi
dent Ronald Reagan and Soviet President Leonid
Brezhnev have agreed to debate in Memorial
Auditorium. The debate will be held at 3 a.m. on August
2." So from now on, let's all be very specific with our re
quests. That way, I can enjoy my breakfast In peace.

of us ever specifically said that we wanted a concert
while we were here.
I'm just worried about the precedent that this might
establish. For instance? if the speakers' bureau starts
scheduling their events like this, the next time I open up
my Daily at breakfast I may read the following: "Presi
dent Ronald Reagan and Soviet President Leonid
Brezhnev have agreed to debate in Memorial
Auditorium. The debate will be held at 3 a.m. on August
2." So from now on, let's all be very specific with our re
quests. That way, I can enjoy my breakfast In peace.

It started off like just another Tuesday morning. I was
lumbering through the breakfast line, getting my usual
two eggs, hash browns, orange juice and glazed
doughnut with the red and green sprinkly things on top.
I guess I was preoccupied with many of the same
thoughts that all of us share early on a Tuesday morning:
Will I get to class on time? Will the three men aboard the
space shuttle next April close their eyes when the first
female astronaut needs to use the toilet? What do you
call that little indentation above your upper lip and
below your nose?
Suddenly, as I casually flipped open my Daily, none of
that seemed to matter any more. The headline on the
right side of the page screamed out at me and sent a chill
up and down my spine and out of my shoes: "Elton John
concert awaits confirmation."

Elton John coming to Stanford I The real Elton John.
The "Goodbye Yellow Brick Road" Elton John. The
"Crocodile Rock" Elton John. The Elton John with the
pink sunglasses. I was so overcome with excitement that I
momentarily forgot that I don't even like Elton John. No
matter. A full-fledged star was coming to Stanford to give
a concert, and that's something to write home about
(and I haven't written home in three years).
I quickly sat down and began to read the rest of the
article. John would be appearing at Frost Amphitheater,
which seats more than 13,000 people. The Stanford Band
was sponsoring the concert, and they had the pre
liminary approval of the committee on campus enter
tainment. It all seemed too good to be true, and un
fortunately, it was. When I read the date on which the
concert would be held, I almost choked on my
doughnut: June 27.
June 27? It had to be a misprint. I sprinted out of the
dining room and headed for the Daily, clutching my pa
per in one hand and my doughnut in the other. "It is
true?" I cried, "Is it true? Is it really true?" Yes, I was told,
Elton John will be here on June 27 — when I'll be back in
Chicago roaming the beaches of Lake Michigan and tell-

ing high school girls that I go to Stanford.
Much later on in the day, I was able to calm myself
down and give this thing some serious thought. For the
past few years, a lot of the students have been complain
ing that there are never any concerts here. Every spring,
on a bunch of those ASSU Senate posters that infest the
campus, you always find the line, "More on-campus
concerts" (usually right after the lines, "More equitable
draw system" and "Cheaper and better food").
Now, finally, there would be a big-time concert at
Stanford. Unfortunately, although we are in school nine
months out of the year, it looks as though the concert
will be held on one of those rare days when most of us
aren't here.
At first, I'll admit, this upset me. I'm not an Elton John
fan, but I still think it would be neat to go to one of his
concerts. I haven't been to many concerts in my lifetime.
When I was very young, my mother told me that going to
concerts would stunt my growth — so I never went.
However, despite my temporary discontent, I now
think that the June 27 date isn't such a bad idea after all.
On the contrary, I think we're finally making some
progress. Think about it. First, we were all here, but there

were no concerts. Next, there'll be a concert, but none
of us will be here. Now, all we have to do Is combine the
two and take that final step: have a concert when we're
all here!
I know that's kind of a crazy, radical idea, but I think it
can work. All we have to do next time is let the Campus
Entertainment Board know that we want to have a con
cert that we can actually go to. You see, I'm not really
blaming anyone for the Elton John date. After all, none
of us ever specifically said that we wanted a concert
while we were here.
I'm just worried about the precedent that this might
establish. For instance? if the speakers' bureau starts
scheduling their events like this, the next time I open up
my Daily at breakfast I may read the following: "Presi
dent Ronald Reagan and Soviet President Leonid
