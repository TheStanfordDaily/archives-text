COPping out: Buhl's authority revoked out of self-interest

The three members of the Council
of Presidents (COP) who revoked the
executive authority of the fourth
member, Fred Buhl, should be
ashamed of themselves for taking
what I regard as a dangerous and self
righteous action. Marianne
Byerwalter, Chris Greene and
Dragan Popov were apparently upset
over Buhl's departure from the neu
tral COP stance in the post-election
controversy.
As a student who voted for this
slate in the spring elections of last
year, I feel a deep sense of betrayal
on the part of the three members.
Contrary to what their action implies,
I did not vote to elect just Byerwalter,
Greene and Popov, rather I voted for
all four, and that includes Buhl.
More importantly, this un
precedented action raises some seri
ous questions about the COP's ability
and willingness to represent the in
terests of students.
According to Byerwalter, she and
the two other COP members were
troubled by Buhl's search for addi
tional information to help the case of
those seeking to invalidate the elec
tion. But a glance back at Tuesday
night's ASSU Senate meeting reveals
that Buhl was not alone in his dis
satisfaction with the way this last elec
tion was handled. Indeed, while 10
senators voted to accept the results
of the election, seven did not. Clear
ly, a substantial percentage of the
student-elected body saw ir
regularities in the present election
system, as did former elections com

missioner Doug Mitchell, according
to a story in the Daily.
The three COP members also said
that they took this action against Buhl
because of his previous threats to re
sign. But is that a sufficient, nay even
legitimate reason? Would the U.S.
Congress vote to exclude a fellow
member who merely threatened to
resign? Of course not. Such a pro
posal would be regarded as pre
posterous. Consequently, the COP's
(minus one) decision to effectively
censure Buhl amounts to little more
than self-righteous indignation.
Moreover, by revoking the author
ity of Buhl, the three COP members
did not address the real issue of elec
toral reform. Rather, whatever the in
tent, their action suggests a willing
ness to silence criticism in the face of
open dissent, a very dangerous prop
osition to say the least.
In addition, one is left to ponder
the reasons why the COP would re
main publicly silent on a question so
fundamental as the legitimacy of a
student election. Was it to avoid
charges of being called partisan?
Well, COP, the legitimacy of a stu
dent election is a partisan issue —
one which most students fervently
support. Or did the COP adopt a
neutral position to prevent rocking
the ASSU boat, at which the COP
itself operates the helm? In either
event, Buhl is to be applauded for
having the courage and moral con
viction to sound the alarm, when

others could or would not.
Having revoked the executive au
thority of Buhl, the three COP mem
bers would conceivably argue that
they acted in the best interest of all
University students. However, given
the unprofessional way in which this
situation was handled and the COP's
unexplained neutrality on the elec
tion procedures, one must ultimately
ask "Who's representing whose in
terests?"

Task Force bites costs
The ASSU Task Force on University
Food Service consists of 15 members,
including student senators, interns,
COP members and a faculty advisor.
We are working in close co-opera
tion with University Food Service and
the University administration to cut
costs, improve quality, and enhance
the Residential Education aspects of
Food Service in student housing.
Our work over the past year has in
cluded the generation of cost esti
mates for the provision of student
meals by University Food Service.
Rod Beckstrom, recently named
chairman of the Task Force, used
these figures in the recent campaign
on behalf of the Council of Presi
dents slate of Beckstrom-Epstein-
Townsend and Mathewson, the
"BET'M" slate.
Differences in cost accounting ex

plain the differences in the prices
quoted in the BET'M campaign liter
ature and in the Viewpoint column
by Janet Craycroft (Daily, April 20).
The figures presented by BET'M are
based on accounting data published
by University Food Service available
to all students and, in our opinion,
fairly represent the costs of meals ac
tually eaten by Stanford students.
The figures presented in the View
point column reflect the averages of
meal opportunities, rather than
meals served.
We feel differences is ccst esti
mates reflect a choice in accounting
principles and that neither author
has misinterpreted data on Univer
sity Food Service.
Both make the point that man
datory board plans are too expensive
to students. Cutting these costs, im
proving quality, and promoting Resi
dential Education values of diversity,
individual responsibility, and a
home-like environment in student
housing are some of the goals of our
Task Force. We invite interested stu
dents to share with us, in writing or at
dorm meetings, their questions, con
cerns and suggestions about Univer

COPping out: Buhl's authority revoked out of self-interest

The three members of the Council
of Presidents (COP) who revoked the
executive authority of the fourth
member, Fred Buhl, should be
ashamed of themselves for taking
what I regard as a dangerous and self
righteous action. Marianne
Byerwalter, Chris Greene and
Dragan Popov were apparently upset
over Buhl's departure from the neu
tral COP stance in the post-election
controversy.
As a student who voted for this
slate in the spring elections of last
year, I feel a deep sense of betrayal
on the part of the three members.
Contrary to what their action implies,
I did not vote to elect just Byerwalter,
Greene and Popov, rather I voted for
all four, and that includes Buhl.
More importantly, this un
precedented action raises some seri
ous questions about the COP's ability
and willingness to represent the in
terests of students.
According to Byerwalter, she and
the two other COP members were
troubled by Buhl's search for addi
tional information to help the case of
those seeking to invalidate the elec
tion. But a glance back at Tuesday
night's ASSU Senate meeting reveals
that Buhl was not alone in his dis
satisfaction with the way this last elec
tion was handled. Indeed, while 10
senators voted to accept the results
of the election, seven did not. Clear
ly, a substantial percentage of the
student-elected body saw ir
regularities in the present election
system, as did former elections com

missioner Doug Mitchell, according
to a story in the Daily.
The three COP members also said
that they took this action against Buhl
because of his previous threats to re
sign. But is that a sufficient, nay even
legitimate reason? Would the U.S.
Congress vote to exclude a fellow
member who merely threatened to
resign? Of course not. Such a pro
posal would be regarded as pre
posterous. Consequently, the COP's
(minus one) decision to effectively
censure Buhl amounts to little more
than self-righteous indignation.
Moreover, by revoking the author
ity of Buhl, the three COP members
did not address the real issue of elec
toral reform. Rather, whatever the in
tent, their action suggests a willing
ness to silence criticism in the face of
open dissent, a very dangerous prop
osition to say the least.
In addition, one is left to ponder
the reasons why the COP would re
main publicly silent on a question so
fundamental as the legitimacy of a
student election. Was it to avoid
charges of being called partisan?
Well, COP, the legitimacy of a stu
dent election is a partisan issue —
one which most students fervently
support. Or did the COP adopt a
neutral position to prevent rocking
the ASSU boat, at which the COP
itself operates the helm? In either
event, Buhl is to be applauded for
having the courage and moral con
viction to sound the alarm, when

others could or would not.
Having revoked the executive au
thority of Buhl, the three COP mem
bers would conceivably argue that
they acted in the best interest of all
University students. However, given
the unprofessional way in which this
situation was handled and the COP's
unexplained neutrality on the elec
tion procedures, one must ultimately
ask "Who's representing whose in
terests?"

Task Force bites costs
The ASSU Task Force on University
Food Service consists of 15 members,
including student senators, interns,
COP members and a faculty advisor.
We are working in close co-opera
tion with University Food Service and
the University administration to cut
costs, improve quality, and enhance
the Residential Education aspects of
Food Service in student housing.
Our work over the past year has in
cluded the generation of cost esti
mates for the provision of student
meals by University Food Service.
Rod Beckstrom, recently named
chairman of the Task Force, used
these figures in the recent campaign
on behalf of the Council of Presi
dents slate of Beckstrom-Epstein-
Townsend and Mathewson, the
"BET'M" slate.
Differences in cost accounting ex

plain the differences in the prices
quoted in the BET'M campaign liter
ature and in the Viewpoint column
by Janet Craycroft (Daily, April 20).
The figures presented by BET'M are
based on accounting data published
by University Food Service available
to all students and, in our opinion,
fairly represent the costs of meals ac
tually eaten by Stanford students.
The figures presented in the View
point column reflect the averages of
meal opportunities, rather than
meals served.
We feel differences is ccst esti
mates reflect a choice in accounting
principles and that neither author
has misinterpreted data on Univer
sity Food Service.
Both make the point that man
datory board plans are too expensive
to students. Cutting these costs, im
proving quality, and promoting Resi
dential Education values of diversity,
individual responsibility, and a
home-like environment in student
housing are some of the goals of our
Task Force. We invite interested stu
dents to share with us, in writing or at
dorm meetings, their questions, con
cerns and suggestions about Univer
sity Food Service in theirdorm.
