## SF Ballet unveils superb new Stravinsky program 
### Mary Walp 
7 T vvaiu
!Two brand new ballets were
featured on an excellent
Stravinsky-dominated pro
gifcm Saturday night. Of the six
works, four were set to
Stravinsky. The evening
opened with his "Greeting
Prelude," an overture which
was performed by the or
chestra alone, demonstrating
the excellence of the Per
forming Arts Orchestra.
'Jerome Robbins' frolicking
Circus Polka, danced by 48 lit-

Robbins'
transition from
elephants to little
girls is done with a
light touch and a
bit of humor.

tOe girl students of the San Fran
dsco Ballet's school, was the
ffrst ballet of the evening. Dif
ferent colored tutus defined
the three age groups of the
ballet, creating interesting de
signs as they danced about the
stage. Circus Polka is cute, but
not in this well-rehearsed
number. There were only one
or two moments when some
one forgot and did too many
passees or ran to the wrong
spot, and for the most part,
they remembered to smile and

keep their legs straight.
The theme of the ringmaster
leading the girls through their
formations carries over from
the music's original purpose —
a vehicle for the Ringling
Brothers' talented elephants.
Robbins' transition from
elephants to little girls is done
with a light touch and a bit of
humor.
In blue and pink costumes
that are neither macho or ef
fieminate, five women and five
men battle out John McFall's
funny new ballet, Badinage.
The forceful dancing and sub
tle competition between the
sexes c ites a wonderful
work. Badinage opens with the
men marching, jumping and
clenching fists. Not violent or
angry, just strong.
The women then run in and
start dancing while the men
watch. Affected sexiness pre
vails until the pas de deux with
Tracy-Kai Maier and Russell
Murphy.
The traditional roles are
turned around though, as
Maier caresses Murphy's body,
putting her hand on his breast
before he tries the same with
her.
A sensual dance follows and
then the rest of the cast reen
ters to finish the ballet. More
backward roles are created,
one of the pas de deux being
particularly funny. The woman

supports the man, lifting him,
pushing him away, always
staying in control. He comes
running back to her.
McFall's choreography is
funny and innovative with lots
of new lifts and twists given to
old forms.
Next was Michael Smuin's
Shinju which is set to a mixture
of ancient japanese and
modem orchestral music. The
ballet is a.trajedy involving the
double suicide of two unlucky
lovers. Beautiful japanese cos
tumes and a spare stage set the
mood of the work.
Everything is minimized in
Shinju, music and movement
included. Long intervals
danced without music and
even long moments with no
dancing qt all pare Shinju down
to an absolute minimum. Yet it
is this economy which accen
tuates the movements and in
tensify the mood. The ballet
hypnotizes and works in
credibly well, right up to the
startling, excruciating suicide at
the end.
The other new ballet Steps
for Two, begins with Eda
Holmes and Russell Murphy
strolling casually onto opposite

sides of the stage. She is
dressed in yellow leotard and
tights, he in blue. A yellow
square is projected on the
backdrop. They eye each oth
er, casually stretch and pose for
each other, pretending that
they don't notice the other.
The music begins and he
dances for her while she pre
tends not to notice. But then
she does the same for him.
These two dancers did an ex
cellent job of portraying those

first flirtatious moments of a re
lationship. They finally dance
together with light and playful
movements. But then, just as
Holmes expects to be sup
ported in a turn, Murphy lifts
her up and rolls her over his
back, and she lands on the
floor. A blue square is added to
the backdrop. Surprised, she
stand up, strolls away, thinking.
She's got something up her
sleeve.
Ruud's choreography pro

ceeds with a series of delightful
moves, the two dancers con
stantly playing tricks on each
other. Holmes' and Murphy's
brilliant technique was com
plimented by their charming
taunting and showing off.
Finally, when each has won
four squares, they turn and
look at the screen. The music
stops and they casually stroll off
the stage, arm in arm.
Lew Christensen's standard

Bariations de Ballet finished up
the evening with a flourish.
Slavic character dances strong
ly influence this neo-classical
work set to Glazounov's music.
The dancers glittered with
energy on Saturday, the corps
de ballet was perfect, and the
addition of the new variation
danced by five men made Vari
ations an extra treat. Variations
de Ballet provided a bright fin
ish to a wonderful and interest
ing program.

spot, and for the most part,
they remembered to smile and

keep their legs straight.
The theme of the ringmaster
leading the girls through their
formations carries over from
the music's original purpose —
a vehicle for the Ringling
Brothers' talented elephants.
Robbins' transition from
elephants to little girls is done
with a light touch and a bit of
humor.
In blue and pink costumes
that are neither macho or ef
fieminate, five women and five
men battle out John McFall's
funny new ballet, Badinage.
The forceful dancing and sub
tle competition between the
sexes c ites a wonderful
work. Badinage opens with the
men marching, jumping and
clenching fists. Not violent or
angry, just strong.
The women then run in and
start dancing while the men
watch. Affected sexiness pre
vails until the pas de deux with
Tracy-Kai Maier and Russell
Murphy.
The traditional roles are
turned around though, as
Maier caresses Murphy's body,
putting her hand on his breast
before he tries the same with
her.
A sensual dance follows and
then the rest of the cast reen
ters to finish the ballet. More
backward roles are created,
one of the pas de deux being
particularly funny. The woman

supports the man, lifting him,
pushing him away, always
staying in control. He comes
running back to her.
McFall's choreography is
funny and innovative with lots
of new lifts and twists given to
old forms.
Next was Michael Smuin's
Shinju which is set to a mixture
of ancient japanese and
modem orchestral music. The
ballet is a.trajedy involving the
double suicide of two unlucky
lovers. Beautiful japanese cos
tumes and a spare stage set the
mood of the work.
Everything is minimized in
Shinju, music and movement
included. Long intervals
danced without music and
even long moments with no
dancing qt all pare Shinju down
to an absolute minimum. Yet it
is this economy which accen
tuates the movements and in
tensify the mood. The ballet
hypnotizes and works in
credibly well, right up to the
startling, excruciating suicide at
the end.
The other new ballet Steps
for Two, begins with Eda
Holmes and Russell Murphy
strolling casually onto opposite

sides of the stage. She is
dressed in yellow leotard and
tights, he in blue. A yellow
square is projected on the
backdrop. They eye each oth
er, casually stretch and pose for
each other, pretending that
they don't notice the other.
The music begins and he
dances for her while she pre
tends not to notice. But then
she does the same for him.
These two dancers did an ex
cellent job of portraying those

first flirtatious moments of a re
lationship. They finally dance
together with light and playful
movements. But then, just as
Holmes expects to be sup
ported in a turn, Murphy lifts
her up and rolls her over his
back, and she lands on the
floor. A blue square is added to
the backdrop. Surprised, she
stand up, strolls away, thinking.
She's got something up her
sleeve.
Ruud's choreography pro

ceeds with a series of delightful
moves, the two dancers con
stantly playing tricks on each
other. Holmes' and Murphy's
brilliant technique was com
plimented by their charming
taunting and showing off.
Finally, when each has won
four squares, they turn and
look at the screen. The music
stops and they casually stroll off
the stage, arm in arm.
Lew Christensen's standard

Bariations de Ballet finished up
the evening with a flourish.
Slavic character dances strong
ly influence this neo-classical
work set to Glazounov's music.
The dancers glittered with
energy on Saturday, the corps
de ballet was perfect, and the
addition of the new variation
danced by five men made Vari
ations an extra treat. Variations
de Ballet provided a bright fin
ish to a wonderful and interest
ing program.

!Two brand new ballets were
featured on an excellent
Stravinsky-dominated pro
gifcm Saturday night. Of the six
works, four were set to
Stravinsky. The evening
opened with his "Greeting
Prelude," an overture which
was performed by the or
chestra alone, demonstrating
the excellence of the Per
forming Arts Orchestra.
'Jerome Robbins' frolicking
Circus Polka, danced by 48 lit-

Robbins'
transition from
elephants to little
girls is done with a
light touch and a
bit of humor.

tOe girl students of the San Fran
dsco Ballet's school, was the
ffrst ballet of the evening. Dif
ferent colored tutus defined
the three age groups of the
ballet, creating interesting de
signs as they danced about the
stage. Circus Polka is cute, but
not in this well-rehearsed
number. There were only one
or two moments when some
one forgot and did too many
passees or ran to the wrong
spot, and for the most part,
they remembered to smile and

keep their legs straight.
