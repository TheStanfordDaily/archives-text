# Local union blamed for higher repair costs
## 
### David Azrin 
The University's year-old pro
gram to make students more ac
countable for damages which
they cause has raised some con
cern over what many feel are un
necessarily high charges for on
campus repairs.
Rod Beckstrom, chair-elect of
the Council of Presidents,
summed up the complaints of
many students, "It's ridiculous to
think that students can afford such
incredible charges for accidental
damages."
Some students have placed the
blame on the local union for what
they feel are excessive charges.
"We're getting charged for the
University's contract with the
union," said Douglas Hansen, a
resident of the DU house.
Meanwhile, the union—Unit
ed Stanford Employees, Local 680
(USE) — has claimed that the Uni
versity often violates the union
contract by hiring temporary,
non-union workers in order to
find cheaper labor and avoid
paying union benefits.
In fact, two weeks ago, the
union called a meeting with ad
ministrators to voice their com
plaints over the temporary em
ployment of Willie Montoya, a
non-union worker who has been
employed periodically since Sep
tember. The union claimed that
Montoya's employement was a vi
olation of the union contract; ad
ministrators were reluctant to dis
cuss the incident.
The University must weigh two
important considerations when
choosing who they will ask to re
pair damages, their desire to keep
charges down and their desire to
abide by the union contract.
The University's contract with
USE provides an implied first re
fusal agreement with the union
shop, meaning that the University
must first ask USE to repair dam
ages before contracting them out
to anyone else.
James Morgan, director of Op
erations and Maintenance, ex
plained the University's policy on
hiring out temporary work: "We
hire according to the best average
estimate we can make and then
subcontract out temporary work

according to demand."
The union contract provides
that bargaining unit work shall
"not be performed by individuals
not in the bargaining unit to the
extent that it directly results in a
worker's layoff or removal." The
University is required to create a
permanent position if a worker
stays on a job for more than four
months.
Price comparisons between the
shop on campus and local
craftsmen's prices show that in
deed, the University's prices tend
to be higher than those off cam
pus. The Operations and Main
tenance shop charged $59.60 to
repair a double strength, first floor
window at Stern. A random sam
ple of five local glass repair shops
showed an average charge of $54
for the same kind of repair.
The University charges $20.25
per hour for grounds main
tenance, $10 per hour for ex
traordinary custodial cleaning,
$28.50 per hour for painting,
$21.50 per hour for general labor
and $31.50 per hour for plumbing.
The University's plumbing charge
does compare favorably with an
average charge of $45.70 per from
a sample of five local plumbers
surveyed.
Horgan admitted that private,
temporary contractors may some
times be cheaper for a specific
job, but he defended the need for
a fully-equipped, centralized
shop on campus to take responsi
bility for University maintenance,
saying, "I wouldn't deny you for a
minute that you couldn't find
somebody cheaper in the short
run, but you'd find that your rent
would start to go up because ev
erything would eventually go to
hell."
Tim Johnson, president of USE,
said the University uses the
loopholes in the contract to avoid
hiring union members.
"The University is anti-union
and they have a policy of eroding
the union by every means pos
sible. There are loopholes in the
contract and they are exploiting
them to that end," he said.
To cite one specific complaint,
USE recently sent a letter to
Horgan complaining of violations

of the union contract by Row Fa
cilities Manager Heloisa Edwards.
The union charged that Edwards
had violated the union contract by
hiring Montoya, a personal friend
of Edwards, to do bargaining unit
work. The union also charged that
Edwards was criticising the union
and the shop stewards, blaming
them for the high price*.*-
Edwards denied the charges,
calling them rumors.
Doug Sunde, a resident of the
DU house, said that when he has
complained to Edwards about
high bills, "she blames the union
for high prices and she tells us that
she has tried to hire her own labor
at lower prices which is non
union and that the union will not
let her."
Duane Johnson, a worker in
Operations and Maintenance,
said, "I've been working here for
more than 13 years and I feel that I
deserve the job a lot more than
does some guy who just comes in
here. It's not our fault that prices
are so high. Hell, we don't get the
money. We're some of the lowest
paid workers around."
Operations and maintenance
agreed to allow Edwards to hire
Montoya last summer to do some
specific furniture repair work in
the row and cluster houses.
"First of all, it was the furniture
repair. It was very legitimate.
There was a couple of weeks
worth of repairs. Then what was
supposed to be a couple of weeks
lasted much longer than that. He
began getting into other kinds of
work. So that created a problem
for the union having Willie in here
taking work away from them."
Horgan said.

"Willie kind of hung on a little bit.
And, now I have to assume, that, yes,
he was a little cheaper and Heloisa
maybe figured she was saving a few
bucks." Horgan said.
The union claimed that Edwards
began asking Montoya to do bargain
ing unit work, including major
carpentry repairs, electrical work and
plaster repairs. Listinsky said that not
only was it a violation of the contract,
but that Montoya was unqualified to
do the work. "Our people were hav
ing to go back and correct some of
the work that he did, resulting in a
double charge to the students," he
said.
Edwards and Scoles denied that
they violated the union contract. Ed
wards said that Montoya's work came
under the heading of "furnishings"
which she said was housing's respon
sibility. Scoles said that there was no
violation of the contract because no
union worker was laid off as a result
of Montoya's employment.
Montoya was hired in September
and worked until December 1. He

was rehired to repair the Zete house
during winter break and then hired
"off and on until a few weeks ago,"
according to Scoles.
The practice of hiring workers for
three months and 29 days, firing
them and then rehiring them is a
common practice by the University
to get around the four month pro
vision in the union contract, accord
ing to Johnson.
Edwards and Scoles denied this
practice. "That is not the procedure
of my office and I am not aware of
that. It may have been done in the
past and it may be done right now but
I have not done that," Edwards said.
Scoles said that although Mon
toya's contract has run out, he is con
sidering rehiring him in the future.
"There's still more work to be done
there, but I have held up any renewal
until we clarify the situation." The
union claims Montoya is still working
here.
"Where there's a continuing need,
a permanent need, I would want to
create a permanent position," Scoles
said.
The union contract expires August
31. According to Listinsky, "This
(Montoya's employment) is going to
be a really heavy issue in the nego
tiations this summer."

Rod Beckstrom, chair-elect of
the Council of Presidents,
summed up the complaints of
many students, "It's ridiculous to
think that students can afford such
incredible charges for accidental
damages."
Some students have placed the
blame on the local union for what
they feel are excessive charges.
"We're getting charged for the
University's contract with the
union," said Douglas Hansen, a
resident of the DU house.
Meanwhile, the union—Unit
ed Stanford Employees, Local 680
(USE) — has claimed that the Uni
versity often violates the union
contract by hiring temporary,
non-union workers in order to
find cheaper labor and avoid
paying union benefits.
In fact, two weeks ago, the
union called a meeting with ad
ministrators to voice their com
plaints over the temporary em
ployment of Willie Montoya, a
non-union worker who has been
employed periodically since Sep
tember. The union claimed that
Montoya's employement was a vi
olation of the union contract; ad
ministrators were reluctant to dis
cuss the incident.
The University must weigh two
important considerations when
choosing who they will ask to re
pair damages, their desire to keep
charges down and their desire to
abide by the union contract.
The University's contract with
USE provides an implied first re
fusal agreement with the union
shop, meaning that the University
must first ask USE to repair dam
ages before contracting them out
to anyone else.
James Morgan, director of Op
erations and Maintenance, ex
plained the University's policy on
hiring out temporary work: "We
hire according to the best average
estimate we can make and then
subcontract out temporary work

according to demand."
The union contract provides
that bargaining unit work shall
"not be performed by individuals
not in the bargaining unit to the
extent that it directly results in a
worker's layoff or removal." The
University is required to create a
permanent position if a worker
stays on a job for more than four
months.
Price comparisons between the
shop on campus and local
craftsmen's prices show that in
deed, the University's prices tend
to be higher than those off cam
pus. The Operations and Main
tenance shop charged $59.60 to
repair a double strength, first floor
window at Stern. A random sam
ple of five local glass repair shops
showed an average charge of $54
for the same kind of repair.
The University charges $20.25
per hour for grounds main
tenance, $10 per hour for ex
traordinary custodial cleaning,
$28.50 per hour for painting,
$21.50 per hour for general labor
and $31.50 per hour for plumbing.
The University's plumbing charge
does compare favorably with an
average charge of $45.70 per from
a sample of five local plumbers
surveyed.
Horgan admitted that private,
temporary contractors may some
times be cheaper for a specific
job, but he defended the need for
a fully-equipped, centralized
shop on campus to take responsi
bility for University maintenance,
saying, "I wouldn't deny you for a
minute that you couldn't find
somebody cheaper in the short
run, but you'd find that your rent
would start to go up because ev
erything would eventually go to
hell."
Tim Johnson, president of USE,
said the University uses the
loopholes in the contract to avoid
hiring union members.
"The University is anti-union
and they have a policy of eroding
the union by every means pos
sible. There are loopholes in the
contract and they are exploiting
them to that end," he said.
To cite one specific complaint,
USE recently sent a letter to
Horgan complaining of violations

of the union contract by Row Fa
cilities Manager Heloisa Edwards.
The union charged that Edwards
had violated the union contract by
hiring Montoya, a personal friend
of Edwards, to do bargaining unit
work. The union also charged that
Edwards was criticising the union
and the shop stewards, blaming
them for the high price*.*-
Edwards denied the charges,
calling them rumors.
Doug Sunde, a resident of the
DU house, said that when he has
complained to Edwards about
high bills, "she blames the union
for high prices and she tells us that
she has tried to hire her own labor
at lower prices which is non
union and that the union will not
let her."
Duane Johnson, a worker in
Operations and Maintenance,
said, "I've been working here for
more than 13 years and I feel that I
deserve the job a lot more than
does some guy who just comes in
here. It's not our fault that prices
are so high. Hell, we don't get the
money. We're some of the lowest
paid workers around."
Operations and maintenance
agreed to allow Edwards to hire
Montoya last summer to do some
specific furniture repair work in
the row and cluster houses.
"First of all, it was the furniture
repair. It was very legitimate.
There was a couple of weeks
worth of repairs. Then what was
supposed to be a couple of weeks
lasted much longer than that. He
began getting into other kinds of
work. So that created a problem
for the union having Willie in here
taking work away from them."
Horgan said.


Katy Dore/Daily
"Willie kind of hung on a little bit.
And, now I have to assume, that, yes,
he was a little cheaper and Heloisa
maybe figured she was saving a few
bucks." Horgan said.
The union claimed that Edwards
began asking Montoya to do bargain
ing unit work, including major
carpentry repairs, electrical work and
plaster repairs. Listinsky said that not
only was it a violation of the contract,
but that Montoya was unqualified to
do the work. "Our people were hav
ing to go back and correct some of
the work that he did, resulting in a
double charge to the students," he
said.
Edwards and Scoles denied that
they violated the union contract. Ed
wards said that Montoya's work came
under the heading of "furnishings"
which she said was housing's respon
sibility. Scoles said that there was no
violation of the contract because no
union worker was laid off as a result
of Montoya's employment.
Montoya was hired in September
and worked until December 1. He

was rehired to repair the Zete house
during winter break and then hired
"off and on until a few weeks ago,"
according to Scoles.
The practice of hiring workers for
three months and 29 days, firing
them and then rehiring them is a
common practice by the University
to get around the four month pro
vision in the union contract, accord
ing to Johnson.
Edwards and Scoles denied this
practice. "That is not the procedure
of my office and I am not aware of
that. It may have been done in the
past and it may be done right now but
I have not done that," Edwards said.
Scoles said that although Mon
toya's contract has run out, he is con
sidering rehiring him in the future.
"There's still more work to be done
there, but I have held up any renewal
until we clarify the situation." The
union claims Montoya is still working
here.
"Where there's a continuing need,
a permanent need, I would want to
create a permanent position," Scoles
said.
The union contract expires August
31. According to Listinsky, "This
(Montoya's employment) is going to
be a really heavy issue in the nego
tiations this summer."
The University's year-old pro
gram to make students more ac
countable for damages which
they cause has raised some con
cern over what many feel are un
necessarily high charges for on
