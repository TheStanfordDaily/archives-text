### Steve Vineberg Tragedy of a Ridiculous Man 
The colossal effort of making his five-hour epic 1900 and bat
tling the distributors about how to cut and package it must have
burned Bernardo Bertolucci out, at least for the time being. His
last film, Luna, with Jill Clayburgh struggling against impossible
odds to play an opera singer with an incestuous yen for her
teenage junkie son, was a near-total fiasco, and his latest, Tragedy
of a Ridiculous Man, is even worse.
It is extremely difficult to write so censoriously about a director
whose work has always meant so much to me; I think Last Tango in
Paris may be the greatest film of the last 30 years, and there are
passages in even a bad movie like The Spider's Stratagem that are
and fired with temperament that only a genius could
have conceived them.
But Tragedy of a Ridiculous Man is like bad Antonioni — you
wade through all the angst and struggle with the deliberate opaci
ty of the plot, try to figure out the tone and why Bertolucci sud
denly shoots one scene entirely with tilted cameras or why one of
the characters breaks into a jitterbug or pogos by himself in a
dance hall after the music has stopped, and there just isn't any
pay-off.
Tiagedy of a Ridiculous Man is hardly even visually interesting;
most of Carlo Di Palma's photography is flat and cold, as if he'd
been shooting for television.There is an occasional vivid moment
— a scene in a cornfield that, in a small way, suggests some of the
splendor of the best parts of 7900, a trek through the woods that
recalls the climactic passage in The Conformist — and the pan
oramic shots still show a fine eye for composition. But the charac
ters are so poorly written (the script is Bertolucci's own) that their
idiosyncrasies don't intrigue us, the way Dominique Sanda's did
in The Conformist or Maria Schneider's in Last Tango; they just
seem like directorial affects.
As Primo, the cheese factory owner whose son may or may not
have been kidnaped and may or may not be dead, Ugo Tognazzi
gives an overheated, unattractive performance, and Anouk
Aimee is inexpressive in the role of his wife; lolling in furs, her
eyelids so heavy that her face might be a mask, she is like one of
those damnable Antonioni mystery women. It's easy to grow tired
of these two, and Bertolucci hasn't given us anything else to
watch, so we're stuck. He appears to be stuck, too; Bertolucci is
far from being a ridiculous director, but this dumb, pointless
puzzle picture is really his tragedy.
