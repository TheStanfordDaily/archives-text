# High school humor
## Raunchy hit a sorry excuse for comedy 
### Christine Roum 
Twentieth Century Fox's Porky's is a box
office hit'drawing even greater post-Oscar
and Easter vacation crowds than Academy
Award winning Chariots of Fire. It is also a ter
rible movie. Ironically, it is the pet project of a
supposedly serious director, Bob Clark (Trib
ute, Murder by Decree), who wrote,
directed, and co-produced this mangy dog of
a film.
Porky's is a raunchy nightclub in the
backwoods of Florida that serves as a symbol
of an adolescent vision of manhood for a
group of seniors at Angel Beach High. Out
side, Porky's offers a neon sign flashing the
promise "Get it at Porky's" while inside it of
fers a motley group of local outcasts:
toothless rowdiqs, flabby nude dancers, a
mean-looking midget, several degenerate
sows, and the elephantine proprietor, Porky.
The film claims to revolve around these
kids' attempts to get into Porky's and thus to
fulfill their single-minded desire: to "get
laid." These guys, however, Pee Wee, Jimmy,
Timmy, Billy, Mickey, and Meat, played by a
cast of unknowns, make only one attempt to
"get it at Porky's."
The rest of the film imposes on the au
dience a series of unimaginative gags cen
tered on adolescent sex. Porky's, then, is a
worthless attempt to give the film some sort
of a throughline.
In reality Porky's is a plotless, thoughtless
regurgitation of every high school joke in the
history of high school. The Porky's ad cam
paign claims that this movie crammed with
"fat" jokes, condom jokes, and "Mike Hunt"
jokes is the "funniest movie about growing
up ever made." Clark seems to have a de
luded sense of comedy, however; at times he
even resorts to having everyone on the
screen laughing at their own jokes. Rather
than making it entertaining, Clark's
sledgehammer approach makes Porky's one
of the least imaginative films about growing
up ever made.

Porky's is more than just a bad film, how
ever; it is also an offensive one. In a half
baked attempt to add dimension to the story
Clark brings in the issue of child abuse and of
prejudice. Timmy is the result of an ex-con
vict father who beats him for such reasons as
losing a fight to a Jewish boy, Brian Schwartz,
or being the butt of a gag involving a huge
black man.
Consequently, Timmy is a bigot and
harasses Brian until, in a simplistic con
clusion, he realizes that his prejudice is un
founded.
The characters are stereotyped and the sit
uations are treated with insensitivity and im
perception; it is an obnoxious attempt to be
more than what it can ever hope to be: a low
comedy.
Another of the film's great offenses is its ex
ploitation of women; they are treated only as
the objects of the boys' obsessive quest for
sex; they are either naked bodies in a shower,
objects of unfunny, awkward sex gags, or the
prize for Pee Wee's persistence in trying to
"get some". The other women in the film are
only characterized by their attitude towards
sex.
Cherry Forever is a rough and ready prosti
tute, Beulah Babricker is a frustrated gym
teacher, and Miss Lynn Honeywell is the girls'
drill team coach who has a voracious sexual
appetite triggered by the smell of the men's
locker room.
At best, Porky's is kiddie porn. Despite its R
rating it is obvious that its target audience is
high school kids, and I would hazard a guess
that this is the audience that is flocking to see
it.
By simply putting the story in the '50s with a
few jalopies and a cardigan sweater does not
make the film appealing to those who would
have been in high school at that time. Porky's
is an adolescent film that is never amusing
and always dangerously tasteless: a garbage
heap of bad jokes and a sorry excuse for com
edy.

few jalopies and a cardigan sweater does not
make the film appealing to those who would
have been in high school at that time. Porky's
is an adolescent film that is never amusing
and always dangerously tasteless: a garbage
heap of bad jokes and a sorry excuse for com
edy.
