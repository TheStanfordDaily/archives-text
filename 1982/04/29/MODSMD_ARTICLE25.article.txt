# Theatre Works play offers tropical set, dry humor
## 
### Marc Vincenti 
As if inspired by our local burst of warm
weather, the sultry tropics of Mexico's Pa
cific coast have taken root in Menlo Park's
Burgess Theatre, where the Theatre Works
is presenting Tennessee Williams' The
Night of the Iguana. The production offers
an evocative set, some dry humor and col
orful characterizations.
The Night of the Iguana embodies a
longing for sympathy and helpfulness be
tween people. It sighs with yearning for
human kindness, for a link of compassion
and mercy that can give people rest from
their nerve-wracking, physically-corrupt
earthly lives. The play regards this com
passionate link as brief, fitful, even
doubtful, and the playwright's refrain is a
poetic disillusionment with life — a feeling
that the world offers much pain, through
which may only rarely be glimpsed the
helping hand of a fellow creature.
In the world of the play there are two
sides to human experience, which exert a
magnetic push and pull on the characters'
feelings. On the one side is sex — some
times comforting, sometimes shameful —
and on the other side are spiritual qualities
of mercy and understanding. The play's
chief character is torn between these
poles.
The plot centers on Lawrence Shannon,
a 35-year-old, one-time minister who was
kicked out of his church because of his
sexual involvement with a young Sunday
school teacher. He goes to work as a tour
guide, knocking around the globe from
one job to another. The play finds him
shepherding a busload of Texas school
teachers around Mexico, threatened with
losing his job because he seduced a girl in
the tour-group.
He leads them to a coastal hotel, the set
ting for the play, where he hopes to soothe
his frayed nerves under the comforting
ministrations of the hotel's proprietress,
Maxine — a "rapaciously lusty" woman
who sleeps with her yoUng Mexican
bellhops. Into this out-of-the-way setting
wander a New England spinster, Hannah,

and her 97-year-old grandfather — she a
painter and he a poet — a pair of almost
starving but dignified artists. Reverend
Shannon's feverish mind is soothed by
Hannah's kindness and gentility, thus pro
voking Maxine's jealousy.
For the coastal hotel, set-designer Wil
liam Truett Roberts has worked wonders
with the stodgy, picture-frame stage at the
Burgess Theatre, creating sculptural depth
with his raked verandah, staggered
bedroom cubicles, and arched passage
way. His attention to detail was well worth
the effort: the tin lamps, thatched ceiling
and brilliant red flowers provide the kind
of atmospheric surroundings that Wil
liams' plays thrive on.
As Hannah, Sally Cotton has summoned
up the repertoire of small, soft gestures
that we readily associate with Williams'
spinster heroines, from Blanche Dubois on
down. Upturned palms, willowy wrists,
hands that toy with her fluttering scarf —
Cotton uses (and does not over-use) these
idiosyncrasies to portray an appealing
woman who has stitched the tattered
shreds of her pride into a makeshift, make
the-best-of-it garment.
Cotton often hits just the right note.
When she describes Shannon as "a man of
God — on vacation," the character's "wry,
dry" humor is excellently defined. Han
nah's speech describing how she and her
grandfather earn their living is nicely bal
anced between the desire to please and
the weariness of having always to please.
Cotton slips in the right tone of busi
nesslike shrewdness at the right places.
Williams has made Hannah an odd mix
ture of composure and desperation; the
actress gives both these qualities their due.
The playwright also lays little traps of self
pity for his performers, from which Cotton
does not always escape unscathed.
Reverend Shannon is described by the
playwright as "a young man who has
cracked up before and is going to crack up
again ... His nervous state is terribly ap
parent." Williams makes great demands
on the actor in this role, requiring him to

show man who is in thrall to religious guilt
and yet rails against God, who is both
gentle and nasty, and who is beset by in
visible inner demons — a tall order for an
actor. As Shannon, Henry Woessner, a self
assured and hard-working actor, is con
stantly clutching his hands, gripping his
arms, and rubbing his brow — showing all
the symptoms of mental strain. But the
source of the strain is not as well-defined
as the symptoms.
Shannon speaks of being forced to "op
erate on the realistic level" — to cope with
balky tourists and to try to save his job.
These concrete realities don't always vis
ibly impinge on Shannon in this produc
tion. Most important of all, Hannah's pres
ence must visibly impinge on Shannon;
Williams describes Shannon as "suddenly
pacified" by her appearance. This link, vi
tal to the play's theme — the yearning for
sympathy and compassion — was not
clearly forged.
The director, Robert Kelley, has brought
unexpected humor to the play. When
Shannon is beset by, first, the ringleader of
the irrate Texas school teachers, and later
by the school girl he seduced ("a teenage
Medea"), who cuddles up to him plead
ingly, the effect is one of a hapless comic
here being buffeted by demands on all
sides. Similarly, a note of farcical incon
gruity is struck when Shannon, at the
height of his distress and lashed into a
hammock so he won't run amok, is offered
a little cup of soothing poppyseed tea by
the solicitous Hannah.
Sharon McDonald, as Maxine, rolls the
word "baby" off her tongue with cozy sen
suality when Maxine is being nice to Shan
non. If her body would 101 l as comfortably
as her tongue, the picture would be com
plete. Maxine's feelings about her dead
husband were well-drawn.
The Night of the Iguana reprises its play
wright's concern with "the kindness of
strangers" and with "a proud person's
hope of acceptance when it is desperately
needed." The Theatre Works production is
playing through May 22.

which may only rarely be glimpsed the
helping hand of a fellow creature.
In the world of the play there are two
sides to human experience, which exert a
magnetic push and pull on the characters'
feelings. On the one side is sex — some
times comforting, sometimes shameful —
and on the other side are spiritual qualities
of mercy and understanding. The play's
chief character is torn between these
poles.
The plot centers on Lawrence Shannon,
a 35-year-old, one-time minister who was
kicked out of his church because of his
sexual involvement with a young Sunday
school teacher. He goes to work as a tour
guide, knocking around the globe from
one job to another. The play finds him
shepherding a busload of Texas school
teachers around Mexico, threatened with
losing his job because he seduced a girl in
the tour-group.
He leads them to a coastal hotel, the set
ting for the play, where he hopes to soothe
his frayed nerves under the comforting
ministrations of the hotel's proprietress,
Maxine — a "rapaciously lusty" woman
who sleeps with her yoUng Mexican
bellhops. Into this out-of-the-way setting
wander a New England spinster, Hannah,

and her 97-year-old grandfather — she a
painter and he a poet — a pair of almost
starving but dignified artists. Reverend
Shannon's feverish mind is soothed by
Hannah's kindness and gentility, thus pro
voking Maxine's jealousy.
For the coastal hotel, set-designer Wil
liam Truett Roberts has worked wonders
with the stodgy, picture-frame stage at the
Burgess Theatre, creating sculptural depth
with his raked verandah, staggered
bedroom cubicles, and arched passage
way. His attention to detail was well worth
the effort: the tin lamps, thatched ceiling
and brilliant red flowers provide the kind
of atmospheric surroundings that Wil
liams' plays thrive on.
As Hannah, Sally Cotton has summoned
up the repertoire of small, soft gestures
that we readily associate with Williams'
spinster heroines, from Blanche Dubois on
down. Upturned palms, willowy wrists,
hands that toy with her fluttering scarf —
Cotton uses (and does not over-use) these
idiosyncrasies to portray an appealing
woman who has stitched the tattered
shreds of her pride into a makeshift, make
the-best-of-it garment.
Cotton often hits just the right note.
When she describes Shannon as "a man of
God — on vacation," the character's "wry,
dry" humor is excellently defined. Han
nah's speech describing how she and her
grandfather earn their living is nicely bal
anced between the desire to please and
the weariness of having always to please.
Cotton slips in the right tone of busi
nesslike shrewdness at the right places.
Williams has made Hannah an odd mix
ture of composure and desperation; the
actress gives both these qualities their due.
The playwright also lays little traps of self
pity for his performers, from which Cotton
does not always escape unscathed.
Reverend Shannon is described by the
playwright as "a young man who has
cracked up before and is going to crack up
again ... His nervous state is terribly ap
parent." Williams makes great demands
on the actor in this role, requiring him to

show man who is in thrall to religious guilt
and yet rails against God, who is both
gentle and nasty, and who is beset by in
visible inner demons — a tall order for an
actor. As Shannon, Henry Woessner, a self
assured and hard-working actor, is con
stantly clutching his hands, gripping his
arms, and rubbing his brow — showing all
the symptoms of mental strain. But the
source of the strain is not as well-defined
as the symptoms.
Shannon speaks of being forced to "op
erate on the realistic level" — to cope with
balky tourists and to try to save his job.
These concrete realities don't always vis
ibly impinge on Shannon in this produc
tion. Most important of all, Hannah's pres
ence must visibly impinge on Shannon;
Williams describes Shannon as "suddenly
pacified" by her appearance. This link, vi
tal to the play's theme — the yearning for
sympathy and compassion — was not
clearly forged.
The director, Robert Kelley, has brought
unexpected humor to the play. When
Shannon is beset by, first, the ringleader of
the irrate Texas school teachers, and later
by the school girl he seduced ("a teenage
Medea"), who cuddles up to him plead
ingly, the effect is one of a hapless comic
here being buffeted by demands on all
sides. Similarly, a note of farcical incon
gruity is struck when Shannon, at the
height of his distress and lashed into a
hammock so he won't run amok, is offered
a little cup of soothing poppyseed tea by
the solicitous Hannah.
Sharon McDonald, as Maxine, rolls the
word "baby" off her tongue with cozy sen
suality when Maxine is being nice to Shan
non. If her body would 101 l as comfortably
as her tongue, the picture would be com
plete. Maxine's feelings about her dead
husband were well-drawn.
The Night of the Iguana reprises its play
wright's concern with "the kindness of
strangers" and with "a proud person's
hope of acceptance when it is desperately
needed." The Theatre Works production is
playing through May 22.

Theatre Works' Night of the Iguana features Henry Woessner, Sharon McDonald and Sal
ly Cotton in a tropical setting.
As if inspired by our local burst of warm
weather, the sultry tropics of Mexico's Pa
cific coast have taken root in Menlo Park's
Burgess Theatre, where the Theatre Works
is presenting Tennessee Williams' The
Night of the Iguana. The production offers
an evocative set, some dry humor and col
orful characterizations.
The Night of the Iguana embodies a
longing for sympathy and helpfulness be
tween people. It sighs with yearning for
human kindness, for a link of compassion
and mercy that can give people rest from
their nerve-wracking, physically-corrupt
earthly lives. The play regards this com
passionate link as brief, fitful, even
doubtful, and the playwright's refrain is a
poetic disillusionment with life — a feeling
that the world offers much pain, through
which may only rarely be glimpsed the
helping hand of a fellow creature.
