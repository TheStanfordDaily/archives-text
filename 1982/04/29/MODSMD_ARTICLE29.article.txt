## Tomorrow last day to file for rebates 
### Felicia Lee 
The Stanford Bookstore will again
offer rebates to students, faculty and
staff who have purchased books
there in the past year.
Rebate envelopes for books
purchased between May 1,1981, and
April 30,1982, must be filled out and
delivered to the Bookstore by tomor
row.
The Bookstore, a non-profit or
ganization, renewed its rebate policy
last year after an absence of about 10
years. During this time, the financial
pressures of the store's renovation
and expansion precluded the possi
bility of offering such rebates, ac
cording to Manager Elvin Speed.
The rebate policy is uncommon
among college bookstores, accord
ing to Speed. Although many other
college bookstores are also non
profit, most do not offer a program
similar to Stanford's, in which the
store's excess revenues are shared
with customers.

The amount of money returned to
customers through the rebate system
is determined by both the book
store's anticipated revenues (its fiscal
year does not end until June) and the
store's anticipated — and past — ex
penditures. Last year, Speed said, the
store returned 14 percent of its book
sales in rebates.
However, he said that such figures
are not fixed and cannot be guaran
teed. "This has been a tougher year
than last year," he said. The rebates
are only possible when the Book
store makes a profit, which Speed
said itself is not guaranteed from year
to year.
Even though the rebates are only
available to those who have
purchased books, the Bookstore's
profits come chiefly from souvenirs
and supplies. According to Speed,
the Bookstore merely breaks even
with the sale of regular books, and
takes a loss on the sale of textbooks.
