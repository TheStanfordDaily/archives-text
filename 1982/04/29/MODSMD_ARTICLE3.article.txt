OAS recognizes Argentine rule
Washington — The Organization of American States, overriding U.S.
objections, capped several hours of closed-door debate early yesterday
by voting, 17 to 0, to approve a resolution recognizing Argentine sov
ereignty over the Falkland Islands and calling on Britain to "cease im
mediately" hostilities in the South Atlantic.
The United States, Chile, Colombia and Trinidad abstained on the
final vote.
The United States had been fighting an uphill battle through the night
to dissuade the OAS from adopting the resolution, whose overtly pro-
Argentine language is regarded by U.S. officials as harmful to American
efforts to mediate the Falklands dispute.
The final vote was delayed while the U.S. delegation sought to
eliminate or water down language that the United States argued would
be unacceptable to Britain.
Specifically, the United States objected to sections of the resolution
that recognize Argentina's "right ot sovereignty" over the disputed is
lands, that "deplore" the action of Britain's European Economic Com
munity partners in imposing sanctions against Argentina and that, in the
U.S. view, call on Britain to make a greater show of good faith than is
asked of Argentina.
