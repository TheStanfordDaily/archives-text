OAS recognizes Argentine rule
Washington — The Organization of American States, overriding U.S.
objections, capped several hours of closed-door debate early yesterday
by voting, 17 to 0, to approve a resolution recognizing Argentine sov
ereignty over the Falkland Islands and calling on Britain to "cease im
mediately" hostilities in the South Atlantic.
The United States, Chile, Colombia and Trinidad abstained on the
final vote.
The United States had been fighting an uphill battle through the night
to dissuade the OAS from adopting the resolution, whose overtly pro-
Argentine language is regarded by U.S. officials as harmful to American
efforts to mediate the Falklands dispute.
The final vote was delayed while the U.S. delegation sought to
eliminate or water down language that the United States argued would
be unacceptable to Britain.
Specifically, the United States objected to sections of the resolution
that recognize Argentina's "right ot sovereignty" over the disputed is
lands, that "deplore" the action of Britain's European Economic Com
munity partners in imposing sanctions against Argentina and that, in the
U.S. view, call on Britain to make a greater show of good faith than is
asked of Argentina.
Removal of these provisions would have
brought the resolution into conformity with the
appeal Monday by Secretary of State Alexander
Haig for pursuing a solution based on a cease
fire, removal of Argentine occupation forces
from the Falklands and negotiations for a settle
ment of the islands' future status.
However, that would have been unaccep
table to Argentina, which wants the other Latin
American countries to make a show of solidarity
with its cause to help counter backing given to
Britain in the United Nations and elsewhere.
Even in its final form, the resolution amounts
only to a show of moral support, and contains
no call for OAS members to take economic, dip
lomatic or military action against Britain under
the 1947 Rio treaty of reciprocal hemispheric as
sistance. It calls on both sides to refrain from
further hostile actions, and urges full im
plementation of a U.S.-backed U.N. Security
Council resolution calling for cessation of
hostilities, negotiations and Argentina's with
drawal from the islands it invaded April 2.
British surround Falklands
London — Britain yesterday announced a to
tal air and sea blockade of the Falkland Islands
beginning tomorrow morning and threatened
to attack any aircraft or ship within a 200-mile
radius of the islands.
The blockade, to be imposed by the British
naval task force now in the vicinity of the
Falklands, was described by officials here as
"another turning of the screw" to persuade Ar
gentina to withdraw its troops before Britain
tries to remove them by force.
Government spokesmen said Britain was
considering formal proposals from the United
States to settle the crisis. But they said no British
response was likely until Argentina reacts to the
proposals and they expressed no optimism that
the American plan would be accepted by the
Argentine military government.
The blockade of the Falklands, announced af
ter an emergency meeting of Prime Minister
Margaret Thatcher's Cabinet, is seen here as a
prelude to a British attempt to recapture the
Falklands from Argentine forces who seized
them nearly four weeks ago. A senior British
source said the government was not slowing its
timetable for military action while Argentina
considered the American peace proposals.
Using its nuclear submarines, Britain estab
lished a 200-mile maritime exclusion zone for
Argentine ships around the Falklands April 12.
But the blockade announced yesterday will be
far more sweeping because it includes aircraft,
including those on the ground in the islands,
and applies to aircraft and ships of all nations.

U.S. pushing for mediation
Washington — With the Falklands crisis at the
edge of warfare, the Reagan administration
sought yesterday to get Secretary of State Alex
ander Haig's stalled mediation effort moving
again, while making clear that the United States
will side openly with Britain if the dispute erupts
into heavy fighting.
Administration officials said privately that
strong efforts were under way to get indirect
British-Argentine negotiations going on a U.S.
peace proposal by having Haig fesume his shut
tle diplomacy with a trip to Buenos Aires by the
weekend.
Despite indications yesterday from Buenos
Aires that Argentina's military government had
rejected the idea of a Haig visit, the Argentines
made it known that they are still leaving the
door open to a possible new mediation effort
by Haig.
Argentine Foreign Minister Nicanor Mendez
paid a call on Haig at the State Department and
said afterward that he had come specifically to
inform the secretary that his government had
not rejected the idea of a Haig trip, that the U.S.
plan "is under examination and analysis" and
that the possibility of continued U.S. mediation
"is not discarded."
At the same time, officials in a number of gov
ernment agencies expressed the view that a
new military confrontation is now more likely
than a last-minute diplomatic solution. At a
breakfast meeting with reporters yesterday,
Norman Bailey, director of planning for the Na
tional Security Council staff, said "the two
countries are heading toward a generalized
conflict."
Other officials said that while no final or spe
cific decisions have been made by President
Ronald Reagan, there is widespread agreement
within the administration that if new fighting
breaks out, the United States would no longer
have anything to gain in Argentina by trying to
play the neutral mediator and everything to
lose in Britain, especially in public opinion
there, by appearing to be an unreliable ally.
Poland drops curfew
Warsaw, Poland — Four months after the in
troduction of martial law, Poland's military
rulers yesterday announced the release of 1000
internees and the abolition of the night-time
curfew beginning Sunday.
An announcement issued after a meeting of
the ruling Military Council for National Salva
tion said that 800 internees would be freed and
another 200 allowed to return home "on vaca
tion." This leaves between 3000 and 4000 ac
tivists of the independent Solidarity union
movement still interned, plus several hundred
more serving prison sentences for violating

martial law.
At the same time Poles learned officially that a
planned visit here in August by Pope John Paul
II will almost certainly be postponed. The news
was contained in a report, broadcast on radio
and television, on a meeting in the Vatican be
tween the Polish-born pontiff and the Roman
Catholic primate of Poland, Archbishop Jozef
Glemp.
The radio reporter quoted Glemp as saying
that the current political situation in Poland
made it difficult for the pope to come here at
present — but the visit might be rescheduled
for next year. The pope, who was last here in
June 1979, had been invited to take part in cele
brations marking the 600 th anniversary of the
arrival in Poland of the nation's most revered re
ligious symbol, the Black Madonna of
Czestechowa.
Soviets leading in arms sales
Washington — The Reagan administration
yesterday accused the Soviet Union of spurring
a world-wide race to sell arms to the Third
World. Officials said this "irresponsible" policy
has led to "the disintegration of world public
order and the spread of fear and panic."
The officials' comments came as the Arms
Control and Disarmanent Agency, an arm of the
State Department, released a report on arms
sales which showed that by the end of 1979, the
Soviet Union had become the world's largest
exporter of arms.
However, the officials conceded that the ad
ministration has responded to the threat posed
by the Soviet sales to American strategic in
terests, with sharp increases in U.S. sales of
weapons, training and military services abroad.
Faced with massive Soviet arms sales, the United
States has no choice but to respond in kind, the
the report said.
Stocks continue to drop
New York — Stock prices fell yesterday, ex
tending Tuesday's retreat, amid concern over
budget talks in Washington and a military
buildup in the South Atlantic.
The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials,
which fell 8.08 points Tuesday, shed another
4.86 to close at 852.64. Prior to Tuesday's slide,
the blue-chip average had climbed 70.11 points
from its two-year low of 795.47 on March 8.
