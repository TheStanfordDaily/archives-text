Election pamphlet
The journalistic community was
stunned yesterday by a report of a
further inaccuracy in this spring's
ASSU Election Handbook which had
heretofore been recognized as one
of the world's premier publications.
The Daily learned yesterday that
the platforms of the candidates for
senior class president were switched

in the handbook, which was released
early yesterday. Thus, tl.v. nlatform
under the title "Bollard sKe" is ac
tually that of the slate's jpponents,
the "Four Play slate" and vice versa.

Staffers who don't sign up for the
Daily night at the Bleacher Bums,
may be relegated to the bench in up
coming innings.
