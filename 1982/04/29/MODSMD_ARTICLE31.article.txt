Perhaps it happened this,
way: Germany, created by
Otto van Bismarck under
Prussian hegemony in 1871, be
comes the principal instigator
of the First World War, suffers
defeat and must bear the
burden of reparations. Out of

this arises National Socialism
and the extermination of Eu
ropean Jewry — along with
much of Central Europe.
From the ashes of total de
feat Germany becomes a major
power in the Common Market
— this through German in
dustriousness — the principal
European partner in NATO,
and a bulwark against Soviet
Communism.

Or this way: Germany,
created by Bismarck under
Prussian hegemony in 1871, be
comes the home of the largest
worker's party in the world, but
fails in its attempt to establish a
socialist state due to the treach
ery of Noske and the Freikorps,
and is duped by big business
into accepting Adolf Hitler.
True Germans go under
ground, emigrate, or are killed.
After the liberation of Hitler's
Germany by the Red Army, this
Germany arises separately to
become a major power in
COMECON — this through
German industriousness — the
principal European partner in
the Warsaw pact, and a socialist
German state.
Thus for the non-German as
well as the German it is virtually
impossible to speak of Germa
ny and the Germans. Yet there
can be little doubt: no other
European nation has in its re
cent history been a home to so
many divergent forces, so
ruled by contradictions, or has
occupied so prominent a piace
in the dreams and nightmares
of its neighbors.
If some students of Germany
have asked: "Why Hitler?" or
"Why did the principles of lib
eral democracy fail in Germa
ny?", the pertinent questions
for the student of present-day
Germany are: "What and
where is Germany today? How
are these Germans handling
the question of a divided na
tion? Of freedom and de
mocracy?"
Gordon Craig's The Ger
mans is always mindful of these
problems with a problematic
people. The book poses these
questions of the two Germa
nys, and Craig's portrayal and
assessment of the contem
porary German scenes can only
be described as masterful.
It is Craig's intention, as an
observer of Germany and one
of the preeminent modern
German historians, to describe
the country and the people in a
style that is at once learned and
informal. It may well be con
sidered as an homage to a na
tion he has grown to know so
well, yet an homage always
marked by the critical eye of
the professional.
The Germans Is divided into
three sections, "Past and Pres
ent," an historical outline of
German unity and discord
since the Thirty Years' War,
"Continuity and Change,"
nine chapters on various
aspects of German life and so
ciety ranging from chapters on
women, literature and religion

to the final chapter on Berlin.
The final section, "Democracy
and Nationalism," attempts to
sum up the positions of both
German nations in these two
areas. An appendix, "The Aw
ful German Language," rounds
out this most comprehensive
work.
The range and profusion of
detail and insight offered here
is astonishing. While providing
the less than knowledgeable
reader with the necessary ma
terial for the comprehension of
the whole, it is the middle sec
tion on the individual aspects
of contemporary German soci
ety that marks the scope of
Craig's knowledge and mastery
of German history. The general
structure of these chapters is
tripartite: a pointed overview
of the origins of institutions
such as the military and the
universities, their develop
ment through the Third Reich,
and a weighing of the breaks
within that heritage that post
war society has been able or
found necessary to create.
It is true that German history
is marked by events that both
German states claim as their
heritage (most notably literary
figures), and part of the present
German-German debate must
be seen in this light. Craig, too
is concerned with the active
self-definition of Germans,
their conscious attempts to

break with an inglorious past.
At times this caesura has a
large base of support, as Craig
demonstrates in the chapter on
the military, at times it is en
forced by segments of society
against the majority, as in the
reform of the universities or
with the women's movement.
Yet none of these changes is
easy or without internal and
historical contradictions.
Throughout, Craig consistantly
brings to light those elements
at work in the formation of
German societies at present.
Historical continuity and
heritage have been more prob
lematic in the West. The Ger
man Democratic Republic
(GDR) has not, as my opening
suggests, ever claimed any re
sponsibility for the sins of Ger
many under Hitler. These have
been laid at the door of the re
vanchists in the West. Curious
• ly, Craig's treatment of the
GDR, particularly in these
middle sections, seems to ac
cept this notion as well, albeit
negatively.
While the rhetoric of the East
and the paucity of hard in
formation make judgments dif
ficult, I believe it would be pos
sible to show the ways in which
the GRD has developed into a
specifically German form of so
cialism, whatever its obliga
tions — and they are, as Craig
