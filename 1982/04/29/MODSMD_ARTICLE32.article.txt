In the essays that are col
lected in Toward a New Cold
War, Noam Chomsky ques
tions the "remarkable uniform
ity" of mainstream in
telligentsia in the United States
— a uniformity, he claims, that
has little difficulty in passing
particular interests for those of
all sensible women and men.
Chomsky subjects both
scholarship and the media to
his scrutiny. Between them, he
points out in merciless detail,
they realize that the power to
define is the power to control.
What they cannot define, they
distort, and what they cannot
distort, they ignore.
Ignoring of course, takes two
forms. The conventional way, is
to fail to report on an issue, as is
the case with the atrocities that
took place in East Timor. The
other way is to over-expose an
issue and orchestrate it out of
proportion by raising it to the
level of a global confrontation
thereby drawing attention
away from the basic issue, as in
the case of Central America.
Years ago Chomsky revolu
tionized the science of
linguistics with his concept that
human beings possess an in
nate sense of the structure of
language which explained how
children could construct sen
tences they had never heard
before. Since then, he has
turned to international affairs,
and has been an outspoken,
often acerbic critic of Ameri
can foreign policy.
His basic contention is that
the common view that internal

freedom makes for humane
and moral international behav
ior is supported neither by his
torical evidence nor reason,
and that the United States has a
history of imposing oppressive,
and terrorist regimes in coun
tries within its power, such as
the "sugar" and "banana" re
publics of the Carribean and
Central America.
Contrary to claims by his
critics who allege that his works
are like the ravings of an ideal
ist without any factual evi
dence, his latest book, like all
his work, is marked by astute
political analysis and ex
haustive attention to detail. It is
the detail — the 106 pages of
footnotes, in fact, that makes
this major collection of essays
drawn from articles and lec
tures between 1973 and 1981.
To question them without
equally convincing evidence
would call for a certain amount
of intellectual dishonesty.
Each essay in the collection is
concerned with some aspect of
the current U.S. return to the
Cold War posture. Chomsky
begins by analyzing the role of
intellectuals in determining
policy. He then discusses the
Paris accords of January 1973,
the "apologetics" that fol
lowed for the Vietnam war, the
current options for U.S. policy
toward Israel, the Israeli-
Palestinian conflict and the re
ality behind the "human rights
rhetoric" of the 19705.
The last chapter of the book
concerns a place that most
people have probably never
heard of: East Timor, a small is
land near Indonesia where a
quarter of a nation of 700,000
were killed by starvation and
warfare following an Indo
