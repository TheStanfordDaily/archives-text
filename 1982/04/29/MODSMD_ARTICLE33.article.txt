Aldo Huxley Bottoms, an aspiring
singer/songwriter better known as Tramp, is,
in his own words "without a clue." He is re
turhing, without his girlfriend, money or his
band to his broken-down home, "The Last
Resort" and his equally broken-down family.
Thus begins Scott Sommer's excellent new
book The Last Resort. In this novel we follow
Tramp through a summer of outrageous and
endearing characters and adventures. Tramp
is struggling to make it in the music business
and get Leah, his girlfriend, back — in other
words, he is a man in search of a clue.
The story is told in the first person and the
unique and irreverent moral vision is fresh,
crisp, thought-provoking and always enter
taining. From the first page Sommer estab
lishes control of the story and pulls the reader
through to the last.
Sommer, a young writer from New York
City, has written one novel and a collection of
short fiction which received critical acclaim.
Characterization is his strong point. The peo
ple in The Last Resort are finely drawn and
skillfully portrayed. The dialogue is ev
erything dialogue should be; real, revealing,
entertaining as are the characters.
Sommer's choice of details is creative and
slightly askew. Take for example this descrip
tion: "Leah's father, Wharton Summit, all
bones, wearing an olive stretch bathing suit
and a pair of yellow radiophones clamped
over his ears, was fishing at shore for bass. On
weekdays the man hauled nuclear waste for a
utility company."

Tramp is a hero, although slightly offbeat,
and his story is liberally spiced with sex, drugs
and rock and roll. Sometimes you like him,
and sometimes you don't — but you always
believe him. You have to have a soft spot for a
man who answers the phone with his girl
friend's name and breaks into the dog pound
in the middle of the night to tell his dog about
a possible record contract.
One thing which stands out about this
book is the language. Through Tramp, Som
mer revels in the English language, often as
saulting us with a veritable barrage of ver
biage. Too often you feel as if you are slog
ging through a wasteland of three-syllable
words. Granted, some of it is all part of the
plan — Sommer mocking Sommer — as when
Tramp is describing his song "Ashes to
Ashes": "my whimsical ditty of fear and trem
bling in an iconoclastic epoch of
monogamous ambiguity."
Most of his best writing is his simplest: pure
clean sentences such as "Leah's tenderness
begins in her eyes and rinses downward." It is
for sentences like that you read books and
The Last Resort is full of them.
Sommer's weakness is plot. Much of it is
slapped together and haphazard. The last
quarter of the book is particularly sloppy and
rushed, and seems almost like an unrevised
first draft. But, in light of the rest of the book,
it can be forgiven.
Other writers might leap to mind when you
read this book — Kurt Vonnegut, J. D. Sal
inger, John Irving. But that is too simple. Som
mer is uniquely Sommer and The Last Resal
is distinctly his book. Don't miss it — it's
worth reading.
