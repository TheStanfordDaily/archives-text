# Cold War seen as a political device to unite allies

### Chitra Subramaniam 
Noam Chomsky spoke re
cently with the Daily in a tele
phone interview from his
Massachussetts Institute of
Technology office.
Chitra Subramanlam: You
say there is a tendency on the
part of the media to perceive
every issue as being essentially
bi-polar. Why?
Noam Chomsky: It's not just
the media. Even the scholar
ship and the general ideology
tends to look at the world as a
bi-polar system of conflict.
There is certainly a conflict in
terms of the super-power rival
ry, but by invoking a bi-polar
premise, you can appeal to the
"fear of the enemy" among the
people, especially when you
want to carry out certain
threats. For example, it is utter
ly ludicrous to raise the issue of
El Salvador to the level of an in
ternational confrontation,
presenting it as a communist
campaign orchestrated by the
Soviet Union with the coopera
tion of Cuba, Ethiopia and Viet
nam to take over Central Amer
ica. But you see, the Soviet
Union is a very credible enemy,
and intellectuals find it very
convenient to work within this
framework.
CS: There is also a tendency
to interpret international
events in certain predictable
patterns. Why?
NC: The pattern is very
simple. Any development that
threatens American interests is
immediately attributed to Rus
sian subversive tactics. This
goes back to the period after
theSecond World Warwhen a
measure of freedom was
achieved by countries in the
Third World, and the era of un

constrained consumption of
natural resources drew to a
close. The decline of American
hegemony was hastened, and
in some ways symbolized by
the failure of the United States
to crush the resistance to its
domination in Indochina. This
weakened the United States
somewhat relative to its in
dustrial allies-rivals, and con
strained its ability "to work its
will on the rest of the world."
Especially nationalist move
ments in Europe and Asia that
ranged from the reformist to
the revolutionary, were dra
matically opposed to the Unit
ed States. So the decline of U.S.
hegemony is generally de
scribed in terms of the super
power conflict, and when rela
tions with other countries are
considered, it is within this
standard framework.
CS: But isn't this framework
deceptive?
NC: Yes it is. Loss of
hegemony and relative eco
nomic decline are problems af
fecting the Soviet Union as well
as the United States. The
phrase "Communist ability to
harass the U.S." conceals
something quite different: the
decline in U.S. ability to impose
its will. More generally, what
has been declining is the Cold
War system that proved so use
ful for both super-powers as a
device for controlling their al
lies and mobilizing domestic
support for the ugly and often
costly measures required to
impose the desired form of or
der and stability on their re
spective domains. These de
velopments pose problems for
decisionmakers within the U.S.
as well as for the transnational
corporations that are clo«ely

linked to U.S. state power and
that rely on it to maintain a
world system in which they can
expand and prosper. The mili
tary-bureaucratic elite that
rules the USSR faces similar dif
ficulties in its own narrower
domain of influence and con
trol.
CS: Would you comment on
the belief that the American
press is generally free, and that
people here are allowed to ex-,
press opinions without any
fear.
NC: In a sense that is true be
cause there is no state repres
sion here as in the Soviet Union
where it is more brutal and ob
vious. The control here is very
subtle — there is a systematic
bias in scholarship and the me
dia expressed over a fairly
broad mainstream of opinion.
In the Soviet Union someone
like me would probably get ar
rested. But here the way it is
done is that my credibility is
questioned and the New York
Times in its review would dis
miss my book as an expression
of emotions.
CS: Don't people realize
what is happening?
NC: Yes, they do. In fact
there is a significant split be
tween the population and the
elite groups that control policy.
There were popular move
ments against American in
tervention in El Salvador. But
the media pretty much takes
the line of the government.
That is typical. «
CS: Is there any alternative
for a journalist who wants to
see things for what they are?
NC: Well, its very difficult
because if you refuse to con
form, the system weeds you
out.

CS: What is the audience
segment you are trying to
reach?
NC: Well, students and
church groups. They have
been quite firm about oppos
ing U.S. intervention in other

countries.
CS: Would you define your
political premise?
NC: Anarchist,. I guess. A lib
ertarian socialist, anti-Leninist
Marxist....
