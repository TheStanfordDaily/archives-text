Sylvia Plath, Sylvia Plath ...
Do you think she really ex
isted?
That strange, half-mythical
figure out of the mists of time
... mists of time? 1963 was the
year she murdered herself:
when you and I were babes in
the cot, and the Beatles' first LP
came out, and the '60s really
got into its swing, and feminist
poetry got into its swing ....
Sylvia Plath. Let's recite the
legend: how a woman ap
peared in New England: how
her mother was a tireless
guardian and her father was an
aching vacuum where a father
should have been because he
died when she was nine. Yet
there were memories of a
father-figure, hulking and Ger
manic.
And how she wrote poetry,
went mad, tried to kill herself,
and wrote poetry, and went
mad, and tried to kill herself.
She wrote in Lady Lazarus, "I
have done it again. One year in
every 101 manage it... Dying is
an art, like everything else. I do
it exceptionally well."
And how she went to Eng
land, and America, and Eng

land . . . And how she met, and
fell in love with, and married
Ted Hughes: a poet and father
figure: hulking and Northern-
And how she wrote poetry,
and went mad, and tried to kill
herself on February 11, 1963.
And how she succeeded.
You may have thought that
the fabulous ghostliness of her
legend was due to the
fragmentariness of her poetry.
What have we got after all? A
few hundred poems: scattered
instantiations of her deeper
myth. Now we have more. This
year her Collected Poems and
journals have appeared.
Now here's the curious
thing: the more you readaboui
her, instead of the details mak
ing her seem plausible and hu
man, she just seems more
mythic yet.
Let's track along her
Odyssey.
We begin with her juvenilia:
the interesting thing about her
early poems is how intent they
are, gone over again and again
with a thesaurus, like cold
worked steel. And there are
wonderful phrases and lines:
Green-singing birds explore
from all the rocks: So we could
rave on, darling, you and I /

Safe-shocketed in rock / Trans
fixed by glare of gorgon's eye.
It's like reading her future in a
Tarot pack.
Even the rhythm of her final
poems is faintly heard here.
Groups of word recur, crying
out for internal rhyming, such
as "I, sky, eye" and "rock,
clock, luck, black."
And then she went to col
lege, and tried to kill herself for
the first time. More precisely,
she became very happy, and
then very depressed. She wrote
up her feelings in her journal in
a curiously abstracted way:
"Outside the window it was
dark, and the light from the
kitchen was on the underside
of the tree leaves... I had nev
er felt so happy in that particu
lar way ... Cod, if ever I have
come close to committing sui
cide it is now ... I feel behind
my eyes a numb, paralyzed
cavern, a pit of hell, a mim
icking nothingness..."
She was duly resurrected,
became a Big Woman On Cam
pus; and went to Cambridge,
England on a Fulbright Scholar
ship — and there she met Ted
Hughes.
She described their meeting
in her journal: .. And I was
stamping and he was stamping

on the floor, and then he kissed
me bang smash on the mouth
... And when he kissed my
neck I bit him long and hard on
the cheek, and when we came
out of the room blood was run
ning down his face."
She promptly wrote a poem
entitled Pursuit: ... In the
wake of the fierce cat/Kindled
like torches for his joy /
Charred and ravished women
lie /Become his starving body's
bait.
Hughes became the tough,
brutal Man and she the quiver
ing Woman: not stereotypes
but archetypes. Indeed, in the
last years of her life, Hughes lit
erally hypnotised her.
And then she married him.
And then she thought she was
barren. And then she bore two
children.
She alluded to her pregnan
cy in her poems and journal.
She writes enigmatically: "Ted
dreams of killing animals. My
self or the baby?"
To her children she dedi
cated poems of dreamy am
bivalence such as Balloons:
Since Christmas they have lived
with us / Guileless and clear
Oval soul-animals .. . soul
animals. ..
The word "oval" recurs in

the poems by both herself and
her husband. She uses it in root
sense of egg-like, as above, but
he describes a jaguar as ...
trying to grind some Square
Socket between his hind legs
round. . . He's wearing himself
to heavy ovals.
At this point, Plath's surviv
ing journal peters out: the only
remembrances of the months
leading up to her suicide are
her poems.
Incredibly, Ted Hughes de
stroyed her last journal: a sym
bolic act of fabulous desecra
tion and hubris.
Plath has two afterlives, real
ly. The first is that of a Founding
Mother of Modern Women's
Poetry. But the second and
more interesting lies in the on
going myth of Ted Hughes.
In his book Crow Hughes
writes about the myth of a hero
descending to the underworld
to redeem his desecrated wife.
Even more amazingly, Hughes
carried out a form of symbolic
suicide: he devised a grand
mythic spectacular called Or
ghast, describing the
shamanistic healing of the cos
mos. After it was performed in
the ruins of Persepolis, he de
stroyed the manuscript.

herself on February 11, 1963.
And how she succeeded.
You may have thought that
the fabulous ghostliness of her
legend was due to the
fragmentariness of her poetry.
What have we got after all? A
few hundred poems: scattered
instantiations of her deeper
myth. Now we have more. This
year her Collected Poems and
journals have appeared.
Now here's the curious
thing: the more you readaboui
her, instead of the details mak
ing her seem plausible and hu
man, she just seems more
mythic yet.
Let's track along her
Odyssey.
We begin with her juvenilia:
the interesting thing about her
early poems is how intent they
are, gone over again and again
with a thesaurus, like cold
worked steel. And there are
wonderful phrases and lines:
Green-singing birds explore
from all the rocks: So we could
rave on, darling, you and I /

Safe-shocketed in rock / Trans
fixed by glare of gorgon's eye.
It's like reading her future in a
Tarot pack.
Even the rhythm of her final
poems is faintly heard here.
Groups of word recur, crying
out for internal rhyming, such
as "I, sky, eye" and "rock,
clock, luck, black."
And then she went to col
lege, and tried to kill herself for
the first time. More precisely,
she became very happy, and
then very depressed. She wrote
up her feelings in her journal in
a curiously abstracted way:
"Outside the window it was
dark, and the light from the
kitchen was on the underside
of the tree leaves... I had nev
er felt so happy in that particu
lar way ... Cod, if ever I have
come close to committing sui
cide it is now ... I feel behind
my eyes a numb, paralyzed
cavern, a pit of hell, a mim
icking nothingness..."
She was duly resurrected,
became a Big Woman On Cam
pus; and went to Cambridge,
England on a Fulbright Scholar
ship — and there she met Ted
Hughes.
She described their meeting
in her journal: .. And I was
stamping and he was stamping

on the floor, and then he kissed
me bang smash on the mouth
... And when he kissed my
neck I bit him long and hard on
the cheek, and when we came
out of the room blood was run
ning down his face."
She promptly wrote a poem
entitled Pursuit: ... In the
wake of the fierce cat/Kindled
like torches for his joy /
Charred and ravished women
lie /Become his starving body's
bait.
Hughes became the tough,
brutal Man and she the quiver
ing Woman: not stereotypes
but archetypes. Indeed, in the
last years of her life, Hughes lit
erally hypnotised her.
And then she married him.
And then she thought she was
barren. And then she bore two
children.
She alluded to her pregnan
cy in her poems and journal.
She writes enigmatically: "Ted
dreams of killing animals. My
self or the baby?"
To her children she dedi
cated poems of dreamy am
bivalence such as Balloons:
Since Christmas they have lived
with us / Guileless and clear
Oval soul-animals .. . soul
animals. ..
The word "oval" recurs in

the poems by both herself and
her husband. She uses it in root
sense of egg-like, as above, but
he describes a jaguar as ...
trying to grind some Square
Socket between his hind legs
round. . . He's wearing himself
to heavy ovals.
At this point, Plath's surviv
ing journal peters out: the only
remembrances of the months
leading up to her suicide are
her poems.
Incredibly, Ted Hughes de
stroyed her last journal: a sym
bolic act of fabulous desecra
tion and hubris.
Plath has two afterlives, real
ly. The first is that of a Founding
Mother of Modern Women's
Poetry. But the second and
more interesting lies in the on
going myth of Ted Hughes.
In his book Crow Hughes
writes about the myth of a hero
descending to the underworld
to redeem his desecrated wife.
Even more amazingly, Hughes
carried out a form of symbolic
suicide: he devised a grand
mythic spectacular called Or
ghast, describing the
shamanistic healing of the cos
mos. After it was performed in
the ruins of Persepolis, he de
stroyed the manuscript.

Do you think she really ex
isted?
That strange, half-mythical
figure out of the mists of time

year she murdered herself:
when you and I were babes in
the cot, and the Beatles' first LP
came out, and the '60s really
got into its swing, and feminist
poetry got into its swing ....
Sylvia Plath. Let's recite the
legend: how a woman ap
peared in New England: how
her mother was a tireless
guardian and her father was an
aching vacuum where a father
should have been because he
died when she was nine. Yet
there were memories of a
father-figure, hulking and Ger
manic.
And how she wrote poetry,
went mad, tried to kill herself,
and wrote poetry, and went
mad, and tried to kill herself.
She wrote in Lady Lazarus, "I
have done it again. One year in
every 101 manage it... Dying is
an art, like everything else. I do
it exceptionally well."
And how she went to Eng
land, and America, and Eng

land . . . And how she met, and
fell in love with, and married
Ted Hughes: a poet and father
figure: hulking and Northern-
And how she wrote poetry,
and went mad, and tried to kill
herself on February 11, 1963.
