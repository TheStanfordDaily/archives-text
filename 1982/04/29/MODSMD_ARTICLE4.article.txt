# University disagrees with aid based on admissions tests
## 
### Cici Oremland Senior staff writer 
The fundamental principles which guide higher
education could be jeopardized if federal grants to the
needy were only awarded to those students who score
well on the College Board tests, said Ray Bacchetti, vice
provost for management and director of University
budget.
.. That notion misunderstands what higher educa
tion means as a whole," Bacchetti told the Daily yester
day. "Educational possibilities should not be limited to
only those who can afford higher education or receive
the highest scores."
The idea, proposed last week by Harvard University
President Derek Bok in his annual report to Harvard's
board of overseers, represents one way to limit construc
tively federal student grants. In a story released by The
Associated Press April 24, Bok said his idea is premised on
the theory that those who score well on the College
Board tests are the most likely to finish their education.

His remarks were sparked by the Reagan adminis
tration proposals to cut funding levels for student aid
programs. Bok said the cuts may keep many lower- and
middle-income students from attending private univer
sities or from attending any university at all, and sug
gested his idea as a means of ensuring that the best stu
dents will be able to attend school.
"In seeking to correct a short-term fiscal problem, the
administration threatens to lower the quality of many
students' education and to weaken colleges and univer
sities to a degree that could do long-term harm to the
public interest," Bok said.
Bok's idea has met with much criticism. A represent
ative of Ralph Nader's office in Washington, D.C., for ex
ample, said there is no correlation between high scores
and finishing school. Ron Brownstein, who worked on a
report evaluating the efficacy of the College Board tests,
said, "Grants based solely on performance on the col
lege boards is absurd. The accuracy of the tests in predic-
ting who will finish school have
about the same odds as rolling a
dice."
But the test scores do show a rela
tion between test scores and income
status — usually, the lower the in
come, the lower the scores, he said.
"Under such criteria, college aid
grants would be systematically de
nied to those students who need it
the most," he said.
Dean of Admissions Fred
Hargadon said he agreed with the
spirit of Bok's remarks: he said he be
lieved there should be some tie be
tween need and performance, but
performance should not be based on
scores alone.
Hargadon said he supports some
tightening up of the federal grant sys
tem because of past abuses. For ex
ample, Hargadon said, some students

are receiving aid even though they
are not attending classes or are flunk
ing.
"So much aid is being given that is
not at all tied to academic per
formance,"he said. "It would be
good policy for our country and for
our educational system to have fed
eral money being given go toward
the purpose it is supposed to serve."
Hargadon said he felt sure Bok did
not mean his statements to be taken
literally. "If he meant that literally
then I disagree," he said.
Bacchetti said the test scores do
represent opportunity for those stu
dents whose grades do not reflect
their academic capabilities, though
test results may be unfair to others.
"The test scores are only one piece in
making a balanced presentation of a
student's abilities. But to make test
scores the single criterion (for defin
ing aid) would be retrogressive," he
said.
Bok was unavailable for comment.
