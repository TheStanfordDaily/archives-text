The fundamental principles which guide higher
education could be jeopardized if federal grants to the
needy were only awarded to those students who score
well on the College Board tests, said Ray Bacchetti, vice

Bok's idea has met with much criticism. A represent
ative of Ralph Nader's office in Washington, D.C., for ex
ample, said there is no correlation between high scores
and finishing school. Ron Brownstein, who worked on a
report evaluating the efficacy of the College Board tests,
said, "Grants based solely on performance on the col
