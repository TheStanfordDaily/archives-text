# Ex-Salvadoran colonel says people voted because of fear
## 
### Ray Newman 
A former membar of the ruling
junta in Ei Salvador, Army Lt. Colonel
Rene Guerra, said last night that the
real democratic sectors, and also the
sectors from the left, didn't have a
chance to participate in the recent
elections in El Salvador.
Guerra spoke at a seminar along
with five other experts on Central
America. The seminar dealt with El
Salvador, Nicaragua, and Guatemala,
and with U.S. policy towards those
countries.
Guerra, a member of the 1979 "re
formist" coup that deposed General
Humberto Romero, told the Bishop
Auditorium audience that the mili
tary government in El Salvador pre
vented opposition leaders from par
ticipating in the elections. "At the
same time that the regime was giving
an invitation to participate in these
elections, the military high command
was issuing in the newspapers in El
Salvador a 'hit list' " that included the
opposition leaders, he said.
Guerra said that the rightist Re
publican Nationalist Alliance
(ARENA) received the same quantity
of votes this election as in the last
election because "Salvadorans just
went to vote because of fear... be
cause of fear."

"The regime wanted votes.. ."he
added.
Guerra, who was exiled in January
1960, spoke harshly of the juntas that
have ruled since 1979. "Each of these
juntas have been characterized for
becoming more and more,
progressively, more educated with
repression, with persecution, and
with horror", he said.
According to Guerra, the Christian
Democrats have not been a major
part of government in El Salvador
since 1979. "The Christain Democrats
that had been part of those three jun
tas are just remnants of the Christian
Democrat party." The "more
progressive" members left the party,
he said, leaving "the skeleton of the
very conservative sectors" to "make
an alliance with the military high
command."
Jack Bmns, a former U.S. am
bassador to Honduras, refuted
Guerra's claim, saying that only a
small fraction of the Christian Demo
crats had changed parties.
Guerra said that according to the
acting Archbishop of El Salvador, in
the last month alone there were
more than 350 deaths in the country.
About the current ruling junta in El
Salvador Guerra said, "they are re

forming my country, they are making
my country become a cemetery."
Deborah Barry, a consultant for the
Ministry of Planning of Nicaragua,
charged the Reagan administration
with "very, very serious and danger
ous steps to destabilize the
Nicarguan revolution." She said, "a
secret war is being waged against
Nicaragua now. It's already begun
and it's being done covertly."
Barry said "It appears... that since
the beginning of the Reagan admin
istration, there has been a policy of
destabilization." This policy includes
U.S. pressure on international lend
ing institutions, leading to Nicaragua
losing loans, and the "fairly unsuc
cessful" attempt by the United States
to isolate Nicaragua diplomatically.
Barry said that the "recent accusa
tions" that Nicaragua was a "center
for command and control for the
Salvadoran revolution" and the "re
peated attempts"to identify
Nicaragua as the major arms supplier
for El Salvador were made "with no
substantial evidence."
Other speakers at the event in
cluded Robert Wesson, a Hoover fel
low, Carol Smith, professor of an
thropolgy, Richard Fagen, political
science professor.
