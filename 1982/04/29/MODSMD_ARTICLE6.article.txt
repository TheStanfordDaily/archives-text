# Peripheral canal could increase energy costs

Los Altos — Energy bills in Califor
nia may rise significantly if the Per
ipheral Canal is built, said Contra
Costa Supervisor Sunne Wright
McPeak last night here.
McPeak noted that the California
State Water Project is now the single
largest user of energy in California.
"Senate Bill 200 (the Peripheral Canal
legislation) will double that energy
use. If you think your energy bill is
high now, wait until they start pump
ing water uphill to Los Angeles."
McPeak was one of five partici
pants in a League of Women Voters
sponsored debate on Proposition 9
— the referendum placed on the
June ballot in opposition to the Per
ipheral Canal.
The Peripheral Canal is the center
piece of Senate Bill 200, passed by the

California State Legislature and
signed by Governor Jerry Brown on
July 18,1980.
The Canal is a proposed unlined
channel 43 miles long, 400 feet wide
and 30 feet deep, that would divert
water >m the Sacramento River wa
terway around the Sacramento-San
Joaquin Delta into the State
Aqueduct. The Canal is expected to
cost approximately $3.68 billion plus
other unknown costs, according to
an estimate by the State Legislative
Analyst's office.
Yet, McPeak maintained that the
real cost estimates "are all over the
ballpark. All references to money in
the bill were dropped because a
money bill requires a two-thirds
vote. This way they only needed a
simple majority."
McPeak, a leader in the statewide
anti-canal campaign, also discussed
the economic and environmental
impact of the proposed canal.
"Senate Bill 200 perpetrates the
mentality of build now and solve the
problems later," she said.
Ron Esau, assistant general man
ager of the Santa Clara Valley Water
District, and Don Stevens, a senior
fishery biologist with the California
Department of Ftsh and Game, both
spoke in favor of the Canal.
"The Peripheral Canal is the best
water management plan possible in a
diverse state like ours," Esau said.
"You are voting not only on a bal
anced, reasonable water supply plan
but on protection for northern Cali
fornia waterways."
Specifically, Senate Bill 200 was
linked to Assembly Constitutional
Amendment 90 which prohibits the
export of water from any northern
California rivers that drain into the
sea, including the Klamath, the Eel
and the Trinity. It also leaves the

rights to the water in the Delta region
in the hands of the State Water Quali
ty Control Board.
Stevens commented on Fish and
Wildlife provisions in Senate Bill 200
that promise to maintain wildlife in
the Bay and Delta at historic levels.
He also stated that the Canal would
improve conditions for the migration
and spawning of fish by permitting
the waterways of the Delta to flow in
their natural direction.
"If you change the export location
of the pumps (as the Canal plan does)
the Delta waterways will all resume
their natural flow toward the sea."
McPeak responded to claims of
environmental protection being
built into the Canal plan by stating
that such protection plans had not
worked in the past. "We've had the
Delta Protection Act on the books for
20 years ... yet the Delta has been
continually degraded. We have al
ready diverted 50 percent of the wa
ter runoff from the Delta-Bay system.
Already scientists have said that ir
reparable damages may occur if
more than 30 percent of the flow is
diverted.
