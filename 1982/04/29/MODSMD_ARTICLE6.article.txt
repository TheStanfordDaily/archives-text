# Peripheral canal could increase energy costs

Los Altos — Energy bills in Califor
nia may rise significantly if the Per
ipheral Canal is built, said Contra
Costa Supervisor Sunne Wright
McPeak last night here.
McPeak noted that the California
State Water Project is now the single
largest user of energy in California.
"Senate Bill 200 (the Peripheral Canal
legislation) will double that energy
use. If you think your energy bill is
high now, wait until they start pump
ing water uphill to Los Angeles."
McPeak was one of five partici
pants in a League of Women Voters
sponsored debate on Proposition 9
— the referendum placed on the
June ballot in opposition to the Per
ipheral Canal.
The Peripheral Canal is the center
piece of Senate Bill 200, passed by the

California State Legislature and
signed by Governor Jerry Brown on
July 18,1980.
The Canal is a proposed unlined
channel 43 miles long, 400 feet wide
and 30 feet deep, that would divert
water >m the Sacramento River wa
terway around the Sacramento-San
Joaquin Delta into the State
Aqueduct. The Canal is expected to
cost approximately $3.68 billion plus
other unknown costs, according to
an estimate by the State Legislative
Analyst's office.
Yet, McPeak maintained that the
real cost estimates "are all over the
ballpark. All references to money in
the bill were dropped because a
money bill requires a two-thirds
vote. This way they only needed a
simple majority."
