## Deng drafts a new Chinese constitution 
### Newsday 
Beijing — China is about to adopt a new
constitution prohibiting strikes and bar
ring Catholics from allegiance to the pope.
Both provisions, which appear to be re
actions to the Communist Party crisis in Po
land, were revealed in the text of a draft
charter made public last night for public
discussion before all-but-certain ratifi
cation by the National People's Congress
(parliament) later this year.
The clause on religion, which states "No
religious affairs may be dominated by any
foreign country," appeared a final answer
to Pope John Paul ll's effort for reconcil
iation with Chinese Catholics. Since strikes
rarely occur and Chinese Catholics have
been effectively cut off from Rome since
1954, the clauses dealing with both are

largely symbolic. The timing, however,
suggests linkage to Poland, where un
authorized strikes and an independent
church were central to the Solidarity inde
pendent trade union's challenge to the
Communist regime.
The charter is very much Deng Xiaop
ing's, a pragmatic document expunging
the idealistic fictions and leftist manipu
lations of China's 1975 and 1978 constitu
tions. Deng, who turns 77 this summer, has
been handing power over to younger men
and the draft embodies his ideas for pre
venting the rise of another Mao or an ide
ological circus like the late Chairman's
Cultural Revolution.
More immediately significant for China
are the new provisions on command of the

armed forces, chairmanship of the state
and abolition of Mao's favored commune
as a unit of government:
•The chairman of the Communist Party will
no longer be commander-in-chief of the
armed forces. Instead, a quasi-independ
ent Central Military Council will be named
by parliament and its chairman will be
nominal commander-in-chief.
•A new "chairman of the state" will be
elected, roughly equivalent to a Western
style weak presidency that symbolically
appoints and dismisses cabinets, signs leg
islation and receives foreign diplomats.
•The People's Commune, the basic unit of
rural government for 30 years, will be re
placed by elected township governments.
