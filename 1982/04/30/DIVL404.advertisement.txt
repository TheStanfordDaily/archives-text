TESTRELLITA }
1 RESTAURANT 1
) The Stanford Daily says: )
J "La Estrellita features a classic Mexican J
I menu which includes everything from \
# exquisite tacos to exotic dishes like chalupas. #
V The restaurant specializes in five different V
/ kinds of burritos. These are not, however, the /
\ average Taco Bell variety which can be eaten \
| in four bites. These burritos are well over a 112
\ foot long and a meal by themselves. In j
112 addition to their famous burritos, the owner 112
1 recommends suizas, enchiladas made with 1
112 chile sauce and covered with guacamole and 112
1 sour cream; chimichangas, a flour tortilla 1
112 filled with shredded beef and topped with I
1 guacamole and sour cream; and for 1
112 vegetarians, one of their many tostadas, all C
1 served on large platters in very generous J
112 portions guaranteed to satisfy even big • C
1 appetites. I
I This restaurant has an informal, relaxed \
J atmosphere. The white-walled interior, J
% candlelit tables and handmade Mexican decor \
i create the unpretentious ambience found 3
\ south of the border. We highly recommed « \
I Estrellita.' i
