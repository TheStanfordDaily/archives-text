## Prescribe drugs 
### 
All laws regulating the consump
tion and distribution of drugs should
be repealed and abolished for good.
Yes, I am serious, and no, I don't
mean only the "pleasure drugs." I
also mean prescription drugs used
to treat illness.
I'm sure everyone is familiar with
the fact that prohibition of pleasure
drugs only leads to a black market,
organized crime and uncontrollable
violence. I can only assume that the
reason such prohibition still exists is
the large number of altruists who
prefer to forfeit their own safety (and
everyone elses) in order to save drug
users "from themselves." Personally,
I'd rather buy their drugs for them
than try to buy a big enough police
force to control them — thereby
making my world into a police state.

You happen to be in a
strange town on a
Sunday without your
medicine,
(prescription,of
course), when you
get an "attack". You
cannot simply go and
buy the medicine you
need.

But, to proceed to prescription
drugs: I am not denying the ad
visability of seeking the advice of ex
perts — doctors and pharmacists —
with regard to taking strong medica
tion, but the laws we have currently
make it not advisable, they make it
mandatory, even when it is not nec
essary. In so doing they overwork the
medical profession, cause patients to
suffer needlessly, and create a
Dr./patient relationship that I call the
"Veterinarian position."
A vet, of course, does not attempt
to get the patient's opinion on what is
wrong or what should be done, and
has no qualms about lying to, manip
ulating, or tricking the patient into
doing what he deems best. O.K. for
animals, maybe, but not for one's fel
low human beings. Yet, most of us
who hae ever been seriously ill have
been treated to the Veter
inarian/animal relationship.
Let me illustrate. You have some
sort of chronic illness or condition
such as Diabetes, U-tract infections,
gallstones, allergies, etc. You happen
to be in a strange town on a Sunday
without your medicine (prescription,
of course) when you get an "attack."
You can't even just go to a pharma
cist, who could advise you on dosage,
timing and intake of food and water
(Why do they have to know these
things if no one ever asks?). You must
by law get to a doctor.

I am not denying the
advisability of seeking
the advice of experts
— doctors and
pharmacists — with
regard to taking
strong medication,
but the laws we have
currently make it not
advisable, they make
it mandatory.. .In so
doing they overwork
the medical
profession...

So, you present yourself at the
nearest Emergency Room, feeling
foolish because your "emergency" is
really a chronic condition that you
can identify and you can treat, but
you need legal permission to do so.
Now comes the Veterinarian treat
ment. After a long wait (in misery),
you tell the doctor what your condi
tion is, how long you've had it, how
many attacks you'd had in the last few
years and what experiments your
regular doctors has already tried —
results, conclusions — you request
the drug that has worked before.
A rare doctor will simply write out
the appropriate prescription. Most
will not. Legally, they are on the spot
too. They are not supposed to let you
diagnose and treat yourself — their
function is to give expert advice. Of
course, you didn't really come to him
for his advice, only for his permission
to treat yourself.
So, in order to perform his proper

function and to maintain an air of su
periority, he treats you like a dog. 1)
"I'd like to run some tests to verify
that this is really whatever." Trans
lation: "I don't believe a word you've
just said." 2) "I'd like to try a drug that
I've had success with in other cases."
Translation: "I have no respect for
your judgment or integrity and
want to experiment on you." 3)
"Please wait in the other room until
the tests are finished — the lab tech is
out to lunch." Translation: "You suf
fering is unimportant compared to
my superiority and the technician's
lunch." 4) "You will be alright in a
few hours/days" — very often a lie
and a method of reassuring, i.e., ma
nipulating you into cooperating.
The practice of medicine will be
vastly improved when people go to
doctors truly to seek their expert ad
vice and out of caution instead of le
gal mandate. At such time doctors
could feel secure in their expertise,
communicate with their patients and
knock off the phony superiority at
the patient's expense. Patients, you
and I, could also act as if we owned
our own bodies instead of behaving
as government property.

ulating, or tricking the patient into
doing what he deems best. O.K. for
animals, maybe, but not for one's fel
low human beings. Yet, most of us
who hae ever been seriously ill have
been treated to the Veter
inarian/animal relationship.
Let me illustrate. You have some
sort of chronic illness or condition
such as Diabetes, U-tract infections,
gallstones, allergies, etc. You happen
to be in a strange town on a Sunday
without your medicine (prescription,
of course) when you get an "attack."
You can't even just go to a pharma
cist, who could advise you on dosage,
timing and intake of food and water
(Why do they have to know these
things if no one ever asks?). You must
by law get to a doctor.

I am not denying the
advisability of seeking
the advice of experts
— doctors and
pharmacists — with
regard to taking
strong medication,
but the laws we have
currently make it not
advisable, they make
it mandatory.. .In so
doing they overwork
the medical
profession...

So, you present yourself at the
nearest Emergency Room, feeling
foolish because your "emergency" is
really a chronic condition that you
can identify and you can treat, but
you need legal permission to do so.
Now comes the Veterinarian treat
ment. After a long wait (in misery),
you tell the doctor what your condi
tion is, how long you've had it, how
many attacks you'd had in the last few
years and what experiments your
regular doctors has already tried —
results, conclusions — you request
the drug that has worked before.
A rare doctor will simply write out
the appropriate prescription. Most
will not. Legally, they are on the spot
too. They are not supposed to let you
diagnose and treat yourself — their
function is to give expert advice. Of
course, you didn't really come to him
for his advice, only for his permission
to treat yourself.
So, in order to perform his proper

function and to maintain an air of su
periority, he treats you like a dog. 1)
"I'd like to run some tests to verify
that this is really whatever." Trans
lation: "I don't believe a word you've
just said." 2) "I'd like to try a drug that
I've had success with in other cases."
Translation: "I have no respect for
your judgment or integrity and
want to experiment on you." 3)
"Please wait in the other room until
the tests are finished — the lab tech is
out to lunch." Translation: "You suf
fering is unimportant compared to
my superiority and the technician's
lunch." 4) "You will be alright in a
few hours/days" — very often a lie
and a method of reassuring, i.e., ma
nipulating you into cooperating.
The practice of medicine will be
vastly improved when people go to
doctors truly to seek their expert ad
vice and out of caution instead of le
gal mandate. At such time doctors
could feel secure in their expertise,
communicate with their patients and
knock off the phony superiority at
the patient's expense. Patients, you
and I, could also act as if we owned
our own bodies instead of behaving
as government property.

All laws regulating the consump
tion and distribution of drugs should
be repealed and abolished for good.
Yes, I am serious, and no, I don't
mean only the "pleasure drugs." I
also mean prescription drugs used
to treat illness.
I'm sure everyone is familiar with
the fact that prohibition of pleasure
drugs only leads to a black market,
organized crime and uncontrollable
violence. I can only assume that the
reason such prohibition still exists is
the large number of altruists who
prefer to forfeit their own safety (and
everyone elses) in order to save drug
users "from themselves." Personally,
I'd rather buy their drugs for them
than try to buy a big enough police
force to control them — thereby
making my world into a police state.

You happen to be in a
strange town on a
Sunday without your
medicine,
(prescription,of
course), when you
get an "attack". You
cannot simply go and
buy the medicine you
need.

But, to proceed to prescription
drugs: I am not denying the ad
visability of seeking the advice of ex
perts — doctors and pharmacists —
with regard to taking strong medica
tion, but the laws we have currently
make it not advisable, they make it
mandatory, even when it is not nec
essary. In so doing they overwork the
medical profession, cause patients to
suffer needlessly, and create a
Dr./patient relationship that I call the
"Veterinarian position."
A vet, of course, does not attempt
to get the patient's opinion on what is
wrong or what should be done, and
has no qualms about lying to, manip
ulating, or tricking the patient into
doing what he deems best. O.K. for
animals, maybe, but not for one's fel
low human beings. Yet, most of us
who hae ever been seriously ill have
been treated to the Veter
inarian/animal relationship.
