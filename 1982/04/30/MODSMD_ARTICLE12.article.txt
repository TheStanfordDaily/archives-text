Ventura, Calif. — Public-office
seekers ought to have the guts to de
bate their opponents. It's democracy
in action. Yet, in California, debate
dodging has made a mockery of the
primary campaign season.
At a recent "forum" here, six GOP
candidates for the U.S. Senate recited
their qualifications, damned their
opponents and, in some cases, de
parted before their rivals had
spoken. Such a "beauty contest" may
have satisfied members of the local
Republican women's club, but it pro
vided an inadequate treatment of
complex national issues.
Sari Diego Mayor Pete Wilson
began the show with an error-filled
attack on Rep. Pete McCloskey's vot
ing record. McCloskey, in turn, ac
cused Wilson of "blind allegiance" to
Israel. Meanwhile, other hopefuls
dumped on the current frontrunner,
Rep. Barry Goldwater, Jr., whom ui
traconservative candidate Rep. Rob
ert Dornan called a "crybaby" and
"no leader."
Mindless mudslinging might not
have been necessary had Goldwater
agreed to debates long ago. Prior to
the Ventura meeting, he cited what
he cal'ed a "classic" strategy for a
frontrunner — don't debate — which
only infuriated the other candidates.
In their hearts, they knew they could
embarrass an esteemed Arizona sen
ator's witless namesake in a one-on
one confrontation.
Nevertheless, most Californians
would probably agree that the de
bate over debates has been some
thing of a joke. Maureen Reagan's
last-minute efforts notwithstanding,
no frontrunner in either party has
dared risk exposure to the questions
and ideas of a fellow contestant.
Gov. jerry Brown, the frontrunner
for the Democratic Senate nomi
nation, isn't debating novelist-oppo
nent Gore Vidal; Los Angeles Mayor
Tom Bradley, the leading Democratic
candidate for governor, isn't debat
ing State Sen. John Garamendi; Lt.
Gov. Mike Curb, now running for the
GOP's gubernatorial nomination,
isn't debating his close rival, Attorney
General George Deukmejian.
Of course, one can't blame the
Barry and Jerry jrs. for their reluc
tance. From a strategic point of view,
debates don't make good sense
when you're ahead in the polls. As
pollster Peter Hart says, debates
enable voters to look at c« . Jdates in
an "unvarnished way." George
Washington University political sci
entist Stephen Wayne adds that, all
things being equal, debates only help
the challenger.
Moreover, some point out that de
bates can favor personality over sub
stance. Others see the media hype of
inadvertant blunders — such as
Gerald Ford's toast to a "liberated"
Poland in 1976 — as debate's domi
nant feature. Catholic University po
litical scientist Michael Robinson says
we're naive to think that debates are
absolutely necessary. "You will learn
all you can above a candidate from
reading a newspaper."
As imperfect as debates may be,
however, we have doubts that Cali
fornians or voters elsewhere are pre
pared to scrap the prospect. Here
and in other large states, where me
dia time is both essential and costly,
the absence of a genuine in
terchange between political conten
ders isolates the Garamendis, Vidals
and other underfinanced under
dogs. Accordingly, advertising cam
paigns tell us only to vote "Gold
water — a tradition in the U.S. Sen
ate."
The California primary campaign
of 1982 again signals the need for re
quired debates — early and often.
The more we do to reform the debate

process and reduce the dominance
of Ventura County beauty contests,
the healthier our democracy will be.
HERE WE GO AGAIN: When they
consider the long-awaited Omnibus
Criminal Code bill next month, sena
tors are expected to offer over 100
personal amendments. None of the
proposals may deserve the attention
merited by Amendment 135. As pro

N.C.), John East (R-N.C.) and
Jeremiah Denton (R-Ala.) — the
amendment would make premarital
"sexual contact" a federal crime. The
penalty? Up to two years in prison for
first offenders and five years for folks
who don't respond to rehabilitation.

Gonzo journalist Hunter S.
Thompson, who seems to exist these
days only in the Doonesbury cartoon
strips of Garry Trudeau, popped up
recently at Arizona State University
in nearby Tempe. Always a crowd
pleaser, Thompson had no trouble
living up to his reputation as Ameri
ca's most-buzzed writer.
"Mr. Duke" insisted that a large
bottle of Wild Turkey be placed close
by the lectern. He then refused to de
liver an address, merely answering
questions and insulting members of
the audience. A good time was had
by all. His fee: $4500, according to
school officials.
