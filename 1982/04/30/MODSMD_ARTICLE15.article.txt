# Timing crucial for defense computers

"The worldwide computer
network on which the Pentagon re
lies to keep track of its own and Sovi
et forces has a failure rate of between
40 and 85 percent.
"So far, $1 million has been spent
on it but, according to an official gov
ernment study in the United States,
its equipment is so dated that it can
literally take weeks to give the an*
answer to questions ... the per
formance of the system can be so er
ratic and unreliable as to be virtually
useless."
—The Guardian, March 12,1980

Have you ever heard of the
"Launch on Warning" (LOW) policy?
Simply stated, such a policy would
make it possible to launch a nuclear
attack on an adversary as their mis
siles were being detected on that
country's worldwide computer
network. During the past couple of
years, the Pentagon's computers
have malfunctioned and more than
once because a faulty chip, warned
its operators of a nuclear attack. It
can be safely assumed that the same
kind of event has occurred in the So
viet Union.
Because of the sheer distances in
volved, either superpower now has
about 30 minutes to decide whether
to launch a counter attack to any per
ceived attack. So far, this razor's edge
of time has been long enough to
enable the nuclear powers to de
termine that no real missile attack
was taking place. A LOW policy
would be deemed necessary orv'y if
the time between launch and impact
were to be shortened to the point
where computer malfunctions could
not be checked.

Unfortunately, that future is close
upon us. The proposed stationing of
Pershing 2 missiles in Western Eu
rope in 1983 will have the disasterous
effect of putting almost every major
Soviet city within four to 10 minutes
of nuclear obliteration. The Soviets
see the deployment of these weap-

ons as a strategic threat. As a conse
quence the Soviet Union will proba
bly respond by adopting a LOW poli
cy, relying on their own less than
perfect missile warning systems.
They will also be obliged, as
Brezhnev has so candidly hinted, to
put some of their own nuclear mis
siles closer to the United States, plac
ing Washington and every other ma
jor U.S. city under the same four

minute threat, thus forcing the Unit
ed States government to adopt a
LOW policy of its own. And so it
seems the human species as we know
it, is in imminent danger of commit
ting genetic suicide by accident.
Admittedly this is only one aspect
of the nuclear disarmament dilemma
but, it is certainly a most urgent ques
tion to address. It is the responsibility
of all citizens who enjoy the right of
publically demonstrating their con
cerns, to do just that and to get into
the streets on June 12, the opening
day of the United Nations debate on
disarmament. On that day there will
be mass demonstrations near the UN
in New York and in San Francisco.
Among other legitimate concerns, it
will be necessary to demand that the
Pershing 2s not be deployed, as the
European peace movement has de
manded, not because we are dupes
of the Soviet Union or because we
are naive pacifists but, for the simple
reason that we oppose the genetic
death of the human species.
