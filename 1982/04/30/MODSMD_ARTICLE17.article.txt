## Security, sirens keep some awake at night 
### 
It's getting to the point where I can
hardly get to sleep at night. The
sound of sirens (of police cars, that is,
not the female variety) has been
drowning out the chirping of crickets
and interrupting my sleep.
The activities of police on campus
have become much more noticeable
to me over the past several months.
This first came to my attention late in
fall quarter when I went out for an

evening walk with a friend who re
marked how safe she felt after three
police cars passed us in 15 minutes. I
agreed.
Since then, however, I have wit
nessed the arrest of an innocent man
outside Stern Hall, who was accused
of being the campus rapist; have
heard stories of black students being
stopped indiscriminately; and have
seen police stop several people, for
reasons I can only surmise. Hardly a
day goes by when I do not hear a
siren.
Is all of this really necessary to pro
tect me and the rest of the Stanford
community from untold evils lurking
behind every eucalyptus tree? I just
can't believe that there is that much
criminal activity or potential for it
here.
I don't mean to make a mockery
out of Stanford security. It's not that
there haven't been serious crimes
here in the past. The campus has cer
tainly been a safer place over the past
several weeks. It's just that I think we
may have too much security and it's
starting to make me feel uncom
fortable. It makes me nervous to see
so many police on a college campus,
especially when I know that the areas
hardest hit by crime in this country
suffer from a shortage of police.
The idea of a police force is to help
me to sleep better at nigh?. As it is
now, with the constant blaring of
sirens and my continual wondering
about who is being stopped, I can
hardly get to sleep at all.

A key paragraph was omitted from
the summary of my reply to Dr.
Owen Chamberlain Daily April 23. It
bears on the historical evidence of
the Soviet Union's violations of past
agreements and the crucial Im
portance of verifiability in the pro
posed freeze of nuclear weapons.
The paragraph reads:
Even more recently, the Soviet
Union has violated the 1972 Geneva
Convention, of which it is a signatory,

on the prohibition, stockpiling and
use of biological weapons. The use of
'Yellow Rain' in Afghanistan and oth
er areas where the Soviet Union and
its satellite troops have been active is
now well known. There was also evi
dence that in 1979, the massive an
thrax outbreak in Sverdlovsk was a
consequence of the secret and illegal
manufacture of biological warfare
agents. During the 1980 review Con
ference of the Convention, the soviet
Union refused to comply with the re
quest of other signatories to the Con
vention for relevant information on
the Sverdlovsk catastrophe, another
violation of the Convention."

Shocked and appalled
In the hopes that more people will
take springtime seriously, I felt a .
hitherto unvoiced opinion should be
heard. Academic work seems to take
a back seat to the more hedonistic
pursuits of the sun-worshipping pop
ulace on this campus. I am usually
distracted, but more often shocked
and appalled by the ever-waning
morals among college students.
Let me illustrate. One need only ,
walk through White Plaza to get the
feeling of being in a women's locker
room. And I mean the numerous
half-clad female bodies jogging to
and fro unsupported by any means.
Who designs their athletic wear any
way?
Get serious about the last quarter
here on the Farm — there's so much
more to be learned in class than
you're getting from the study of
anatomy and the optimal tanning
