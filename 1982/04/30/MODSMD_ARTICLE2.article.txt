In a sweeping display of support for student organiza
tions, 31 percent of the student body turned out
Wednesday and yesterday to pass all of the fee
assessments except that of the Glee Club.
Leading the yes votes was the Daily with 2718 in favor
and 568 against. SURE/Rape Education Program was sec
ond with 2661 in favor and 501 against, and Speaker's Bu
reau received 2631 votes in favor and 548 against.
The Glee Club assessment was the only one that did
not pass, with 759 in favor and 2181 against.
The close votes involved the Womens' Center, which
won by 114 votes, Chaparral, which won by 155 votes and
the Stanford Progressive Alliance, which won by 274
votes.
These totals, however, are not final because the ballots
from overseas have not yet been received. Elections
Commissioner B.J. (Barry) Beal said that because of un
certainty generated by the petition submitted to the
ASSU Senate requesting a new election, the ballots for
this election were not printed until Wednesday and were
mailed to the overseas campuses on Thursday
B' M said he expects that the overseas results will be in
no later than Wednesday of next week and added that he
does not think they will make a difference in the fee
assessment results. In last fall's election only 96 ballots
were cast overseas and the narrowest margin in thiselec
tion was the Womens' Center, winning by 114 votes.
Both Beal and Assistant Elections Commissioner Pa
trick O'Reilly said they believed the election was a great
success. O'Reilly attributed part of the success to public-

The elections commission spent about $50, he said, on
1500 flyers and posters, printed and distributed through
the Office of Public Affairs and $661 on a full page ad in
the Daily. O'Reilly said, "That (the Daily ad) probably did
more than anything."
"I think President (Donald) Kennedy's remarks at the
(ASSU) senate meeting helped a lot too — that helped
our legitimacy," he said.
Another concerted publicity effort was that of the
Graduate Student Association (GSA) which, according to
Treasurer Eric Berg, put up 400 posters, made 6000 flyers
and put one in every graduate student's box and dis
tributed 3000 flyers to undergraduate dorms.
O'Reilly also attributed the election success to the ad
ditional polling places. "The two big surprises," he said,
"were Green (Library) and Terman. Terman was very
busy (the hours were extended yesterday after a big
turnout there Wednesday). We found a whole new ac
cess route to campus that we had overlooked before."
He also noted that on Wednesday more people voted
at Green Library (300) than at Meyer Library. A new poll
ing place was opened at the Law School, where O'Reilly
said about 60 peeple voted each day during the two
hours that poll was open.
The Medical School poll, reinstated for this election,
drew 40 voters during the two days, which O'Reilly said
was an increase over that poll's turnout in past elections.
He said about 150 students voted at the Business School
poll Thursday.
