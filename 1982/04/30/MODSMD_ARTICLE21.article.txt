## Bondurant win is key Men upset Pepperdine 
### Sally Jenkins 
A real live championship contender is lurking
in the wings of the varsity courts. An unfamiliar
looking Stanford men's team overcame and just
generally beat No. 3 Pepperdine 5-4 Wednesday
at the tennis stadium.
Let's throw major upset in there too, because
that's what it was if one must be objective about
the whole thing. The Cardinal, ranked a
lukewarm No. 13 in the nation, took four of six
singles matches and won a two-set match at the
top doubles spot for the 5-4 victory. The win
sends the Cardinal into today and tomorrow's
matches against No. 1 ranked UCLA and No. 4
USC hungry for another upset.
'It gives some confidence and momentum,"
said head coach Dick Gould. "And we can play
even better. We still haven't played up to our
potential."
Pepperdine was without No. 3 singles player
Rich Gallien, injured in a 7-2 victory over UC-
Berkeley Tuesday night, and Stanford seized on
the slight advantage. In doing so it put itself right
back in the race for the national championship
and proved to a whole lot of Bruins, Trojans, and
other things too, that the Cardinal is a sleeper.
We're talking deceptively dangerous here.
Another lineup shuffle by Gould gave the team a
whole new look, and a little more confidence
going into the final crucial matches of the sea
son.
Senior Scott Bondurant moved from No. 5 to
No. 3 singles, while sophomore Mark McKeen
moved back to his original No. 5 spot. Senior Jeff
Arons moved from No. 4 to No. 2, and senior
John Corse went to No. 4. Freshman Paul Rob
inon is back at No. 6 replacing Jim Miller, who
still plays No. 3 doubles with McKeen.
The heroic award of the day went to team cap
tain Bondurant, who came back from a 0-5 defi-
: t in the first set against John Van Nostrand to

win seven straight games and the set 7-5, and
eventually the match. He dropped the second
set 2-6 when he couldn't overcome another 0-5
disadvantage, but broke Van Nostrand in the
first and third games of the final set to take the
match 7-5, 2-6,6-4.
Scott Davis stayed at the No. 1 spot, where he
destroyed Glenn Michibata of Pepperdine in
two sets, 7-6 (7-2) 6-3. Davis aced Michibata on
the first and last points of the tiebreaker, and
went on to break him in the first set at 2-2, again
at 3-3 after Michibata broke back, and again at
5-3 for the match.
In his first match at the No. 2 spot, Arons fell in
straight sets to Brad Gilbert, who often plays No.
1 for Pepperdine. Arons dropped the first set 3-6,
and held serve only once in the second at 0-2.
Gilbert never looked back, winning the final set
6-1.
Corse won a decisive two-set match at No. 4
over Rill Baxter 6-4,7-5. He made his move early
in the first set, breaking serve to make it 3-2 and
holding for a 4-2 advantage, but couldn't do
more than hold on until 5-5 in the second, when
he finally broke again and helcj for the match.
McKeen was obviously feeling more com
fortable back at No. 5, in the victory column with
a solid 6-3,4-6,6-4 win over Clive Edges. At No. 6
Robinson lost the second singles match of the
day to White 4-6,6-4,4-6.
Davis and Arons locked the overall match
away at No. 1 doubles with a 6-4,6-4 victory over
Baxter and Van Nostrand. At No. 2 Corse and
Bondurant succumbed to Michibata and Edges
5-7, 1-6, and McKeen and Miller fell to Gilbert
and White 6-7, 2-6 at No. 3.
UCLA visits the varsity courts at noon today,
and tomorrow's match agaist USC will be in
door-outdoor, with afternoon play beginning at
noon and evening play in Maples Pavilion at 6
p.m.
