# Stanford hosts Trojans
## 
### Adam Berns 
The USC baseball team visits
Stanford this weekend in an im
portant conference matchup.
The Cardinal is currently in
second place in the Pac-10
Southern Division. Although
Stanford is four games behind
Arizona and has virtually no
chance of winning the con
ference title, a second place
finish would give them a
chance to play the Pac-10
Northern Division winner to
earn a playoff spot.
Currently Stanford has a
two-game lead over third
place Arizona and leads fourth
place Berkeley by four games.
In contrast, the Trojans enter
today's contest in the the 6-Pac
cellar with a 7-17 conference
mark.

Although Stanford has a
14-10 conference record,
35-16-1 overall, it has been
slumping recently. The
Cardinal lost two-of-three
from Arizona State in its last
conference matchup and lost
again last Tuesday to Arizona
State in a non-league contest.
Although USC has a less than
enviable record, Stanford
coach Mark Marquess is not
taking them lightly.
"They (USC) had a lot of in
juries earlier this year and also
had a lot of young players,"
Marquess said. "The Trojans
are much improved from the
last time we faced them. I ex
pect them to be tough."
Leading batters for USC are

designated hitter Craig
Clemens (.360), first baseman
Dave Smith (.355, 5 HR), center
fielder John Wallace (.319, 7
HR) and third baseman Craig
Stephens (.309).
Trojan coach Rod Dedeaux
will send righthander Sid Atkin
(5-6, 2.89 ERA), and southpaws
Bob Gunnarsson (5-4,4.70) and
Steve Heslop (1-3, 5.36) to the
mound.
Last month the Cardinal
swept USC in Los Angeles, 12-7,
11-5,11-4.
Today's game starts at 2:30
p.m. at Sunken Diamond. Sat
urday and Sunday the contests
begin a 1 p.m.
Brian Mignano (8-5, 3.58),
Brian Myers (5-2, 3.76), and
David Harris (6-0,1.84) will start
for the Stanford this weekend.
