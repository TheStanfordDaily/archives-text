# Geisse on U.S. Select Team
## 
### Sid Spaeth 
Stanford senior Nancy
Geisse was one of 43 women
collegiate soccer players from
across the nation to be named
to the United States Select
Team by the International
Sports Exchange.
Geisse was nominated by
Stanford coach Tony Igwe and
will play on one of Two U.S.
teams that will travel to Europe
May 25 and play in numerous
tournaments including The In
ternational Tournament in

Denmark.
"It's pretty exciting to be
named to the team," Geisse
said, "but it's more exciting
from a team standpoint. Stan
ford has always had a good
team and not been able to
show it. (Most collegiate soccer
teams have joined the AIAW
and compete in the fall, but
Stanford continues to compete
in the spring against local
schools). Stanford will get
some recognition now. Maybe,
we can draw some more re
cruits."

Stanford currently holds a
8-2 record and will compete in
the Northern California Soccer
Conference playoffs Saturday
and Sunday in Sonoma.
Berkeley will be favored in
the four-team tournament, but
Igwe is confident.
"We will be going there as
underdogs," Igwe said, "but I
have no doubt that we can
win."
Igwe feels Stanford should
be ranked third in the tour
nament behind Cal and Chico
State.
