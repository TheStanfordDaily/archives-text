Coming off an excellent performance last
weekend, the women's golf team heads to
Athens, Ga., for perhaps its most important
regular-season tournament.
The three-day Southern Intercollegiate be
gins today and finishes Sunday.
"It will probably have the best teams in the
nation," junior Roxy Gumlia said. "It is the
last big tournament before the NCAA's and
probably will show how the teams will fare in
them."
The Card, who has faced West Coast teams
all year, will have a chance this weekend to
compete against some of the stronger Eastern
squads â€” many of which will be at Stanford

for the NCAA Championships May 26-29.
And since the home team no longer re
ceives an automatic berth in the NCAA's, the
Southern Intercollegiate becomes that much
more important for the Card.
"This will be a critical tournament as for
getting into the NCAAs," GumUa said.
Stanford's five-person squad consists of
freshman Diane Nixon, sophomore Kathy
Nino, junior Joanne Pacillo, and seniors Deb
bie Barberio and Lori Castillo. Last weekend
Castillo fired a 67 in a three-way meet with
San Jose and Sacramento States, leading the
Card to a two-stroke victory.
"Everyone is peaking at their games right
now," Gumlia noted.
