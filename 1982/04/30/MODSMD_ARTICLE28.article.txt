## 
### Sarah Carrel 
In a two-day, head-to-head
rivalry, the Stanford track team
will duel with Cal on Berkeley's
home turf today and tomor
row.
The Cardinal women, who
will be running this afternoon,
are favored to win by a small
margin. Sparked by an outstan
ding distance crew, head coach
Brooks Johnson hopes for a vic
tory over the Bears. Junior Kim
Schnurpfeil, who set a school
record last week in the 10,000
meters at the Husky invita
tional in Seattle, will be hard to
beat in the 1500 meters. Anoth
er distance runner freshman
Ceci Hopp, could prove un
beatable in the 3000 meters.
In the field events,
sophomore Carol Cady will
participate in the shotput, dis
cus, and javelin. In all three
events she is formidable, espe
cially in the shotput, where she
holds the school record of 46
feet, 9 inches.
Other strong events include
the 800 meters, where
freshman Regina Jacobs holds
the time of 2:05.4. Pam Donald
will long jump with a personal
record of 20-4.
On Saturday, the men will
take on a team they haven't
beaten in ten years. Once
again, the Bears look strong,
with such runners as world
class sprinter and hurdler Larry
Cowling. The Cal roster also in
cludes pole vaulter Ross
McAlexander (17-5), and dis
tance runner Tom Downs
(3:45.2 in the 1500 meters.)
But this year, Stanford an
swers with a slate to challenge
head coach Erv Hunt's Bears.
Brian Pettingill, a freshman
from Cumberland, Maine,
bests Downs' 1500 meter time
with a time of 3:43.9. In the
5000, veteran Bill Graham
probably won't have to look at
anyone's back. He has posted a
personal record of 14:00.
In field events, freshman
Shaun Pickering, a native of
Great Britain, has a personal
best in the hammer throw of
207-9.
The Cardinal women have a
record of 8-4, while the men
stand at 6-4.
The Berkeley men are 7-2
this season in dual meets, los
ing only to conference leaders
UCLA and Arizona State.
