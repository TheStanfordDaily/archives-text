# Fac. senate stresses minority enrollment goal
## 
### Kathy Olmsted Senior staff writer 
Reports urging the University to at
tract more women and minorities to
Ph.D. programs and to faculty posi
tions were presented yesterday to
the Faculty Senate.
Gerald Lieberman, dean of gradu
ate studies and research, said the
1980-81 Graduate Student Af
firmative Action Annual Report he
presented indicated that the Univer
sity had a "successful, not banner"
year in attracting minority graduate
students and needed to intensify its
recruiting efforts.
Provost Albert Hastorf, who pre
sented the Faculty Affirmative Action
Annual Report, said that the Univer
sity's only moderate success in attrac

ting female and minority faculty
members also indicated that the Uni
versity should remain "alert and in
tense" to opportunities to increase
the number of minorties on the fac
ulty.
Lieberman praised the University
for significantly increasing the minor
ity enrollment of the professional
schools over the last few years, but he
said the number of minority students
admitted to Ph.D. programs here was
not increasing at the rate that it
should.
Lieberman said that minorities and
women are probably attending pro
fessional schools rather than Ph.D.
programs here because of the poor
teaching market.
University President Donald Ken

nedy agreed, saying that minority
students probably elected to go to
law and medical schools rather than
Ph.D. programs because their
"marginal economic circumstances"
forced them 'o make the conserva
tive decision to pursue lucrative pro
fessions rather than hazard the un
certainties of academia.
Lieberman also presented the 1981
Affirmative Action Report on the Ac
ademic Staff-Research. Because 2 A of
the Academic Staff-Research mem
bers enter the program directly from
their graduate studies here,
Lieberman said, an increase in the
number of minorities in graduate
student programs here is needed
before the Academic Staff-Research
program can significantly improve its

minority representation.
Hastorf said the increase in the
number of women and minorities in
faculty positions here is proceeding
at the same "undramatic" rate that
the graduate student ratio is increas
ing.
The report also said the percentage
of minorities in tenure-line positions
here had increased slowly, but that
the percentage of tenured minorities
had doubled in the last decade.
Despite the slight gains, Hastorf
said the report didn't show "as much
improvement as we'd like to see."
In other business, the senate heard
the interim report of the ad hoc com
mittee on the Adjunct Professoriate
and renewed the Individually De
signed Majors Program.
