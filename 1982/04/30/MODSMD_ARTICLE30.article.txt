gourmet cuisine prepared
here, we were not surprised to
learn that the chef, Dan
Philpot, formerly worked at
Trader Vic's in San Francisco.
Because the prices — and
ambiance — reflect this cul
inary sophistication, The Velvet
Turtle is not destined to be a
Stanford hang-out. But it is a
good choice for a special meal.
Our efficient and friendly
waiter brought hot sour-dough
bread to our table while we
carefully surveyed our menus.
The menu, like those of many
fine restaurants, was relatively
small but complete.
Appetizer selections in
cluded Oysters Rockefeller
($4.95), Escargot ($4.50),
Avocado with Crab Meat Salad
($4.75), and Deep-fried
Calamari ($3.50).
The soup and salad choices
ranged from Gazpacho ($1.75)
to Chilled Cucumber Soup
($1.75).
Because all entrees are
served with choice of soup or
salad, we did not make an ap
petizer selection. After feasting
our eyes on the descriptions of
veal and foul, beef, and
seafood, we made our de
cisions: Tournedos Bearnaise

($11.95) and Fresh Rainbow
Trout ($9.95).
While waiting for our en
trees, we enjoyed our mixed
green salads. Although the
salads themselves were good

pepper. And our waiter tossed
the lettuce with the house
dressing by our table.
The Tournedos Bernaise
were two small filets topped
with bearnaise sauce. Re
quested medium-rare, they
were found to be "rich and
cooked to perfection." Both
pieces were placed on toasted
bread rounds and topped with

mushroom caps.
Like the other entrees listed,
the Tournedos description in
cluded a house wine sugges
tion: Cabernet Sauvignon.
The Fresh Rainbow Trout, a
sauteed fish filled with crab
meat, scallops, bay shrimp and
mushrooms, was an ample
serving, beautifully prepared.
Both dinner plates were at
tractively garnished with
parsley and lemon slices. Small
potatoes, lightly-cooked car
rots, and asparagus covered
with bernaise-sauce accom
panied our entrees.
According to banquet man
ager Patricia Moon, The Velvet
Turtle's specialties include
beef Wellington for dinner and
eggs benedict for brunch.
Desserts
In addition to standard des
sert fare, The Velvet Turtle of
fers international coffees,
cognacs, and international cor
dials to help add a finishing
touch to an elegant meal.
International coffees ($3), all
served with fresh whipped
cream, include cappuccino, a
blend of five liquers, spices, ex
presso coffee and chocolate;
cafe italiano, a mix of amaretto
and coffee; calypso coffee,

prepared with Tia Maria and
Myer's rum; keoke coffee, a
blend of grand marnier and
kahlua; and Irish coffee.
For those with a chronic
sweet tooth, succumbing to
the dessert tray will be in
evitable. Once resigned to
your fate, you will face a dif
ficult choice: chocolate torte

($2.95), amaretto torte, grand
marnier torte, cheesecake
($1.95), chocolate mousse
($1.75), or creme caramel
($1.50).
We selected the amaretto
torte and the grand marnier
torte. Both were rich, mouth
watering blends of creme, sug
ar, chocolate, and liquer. Be
cause the desserts are not
made on the premises, they are
not completely fresh. But they
are delicious — and served, un
surprisingly, on chilled dessert
plates.
Decor
In general, The Velvet Turtle
is decorated in a traditionally
elegant style.
The restaurant has a 180-per
son capacity. But far from
being one large room, it is
divided into several theme

centers: a lounge, a library, a
garden room, an executive
room, and a banquet room. We
ate in the library (I guess they
identified us as students and
found us an appropriate
room?!).
According to banquet man
ager Patricia Moon, the garden
room is most popular, particu
larly during the lunch when
open windows allow the sun to
stream in.
The Menlo Park branch was
remodeled last October. The
new look is more bright than
the previous dark, Spanish
tone.
The overall effect is quite
elegant. Our large table was
covered with a white linen
cloth. And a small pink rose
adorned each table in the res
taurant. We sat in a corner

booth with bookshelves be
hind us — typical of the library
section. (The garden seating
area, in contrast, had an out
doorsy feel created by wicker
chairs and hanging plants.)
