## Pianist's masterful improvisation evokes emotions 
### John Kelley 
The lights dim in the opera
house revealing a single piano
outlined in spotlights against a
black curtain. From the left, a
lithe figure approaches the
center of the stage. He bows to
the audience with a Buddhist
nod, bows before his instru
ment, and seats himself down.
With the suppleness of a cat, he
stretches his back, flexes his
sinewy arms; and then Keith
Jarrett begins to play.
Jarrett's music is totally im
provisational: what you hear is
what he feels like playing at the
moment; the music changes
and flows like shifts in a sum
mer storm. At the Opera
House, he opened with a long,
intermittently cacophonic
piece that resembled an ex
ercise in musical introspection.
Against a sustained rhythmic
pattern he introduced a series
of brief themes that seems cal
culated to evoke a sense of
mystery and even agony in the
listener. As he played, Jarrett's
entire body surged into the
music, dancing with it, almost
painfully jerking and groaning
as his hands laid out a complex
tempo.
This first piece was a vision of
demonic possession. It rose
and fell as Jarrett created
sounds on the piano that re
sembled more the tones of a
synthesizer or organ. The au
dience was as hushed as it
might have been hearing a re
quiem, seemingly mesmerized
by the uncertainty of where
the piece was progressing.

With Jarrett, there is no tell
ing where the music will lead
him. It is as if he were listening
to some transcendental work,
and merely bringing it down to
our mundane realm through
his inner attention. But this is
the illusion of a music master.
With the same precision that
Bach brought to the keyboard,
Jarrett brought his piece to a
conclusion, but one that was
transitory and ephemeral, not
fixed in the rigid calculations of
harmony.
When Jarrett returned after a
brief intermission, it was clear
that he wanted to give the au
dience a taste of something dif
ferent. Before laying his hands
on the piano again, he reflect
ed thoughtfully, and then he
started introducing much live
lier, more accessible tunes into
his music.
While the first piece was in
trospective and agonizing, the
second reached out to the au
dience and tried to engage it in
his ecstasy. The rhythms he
worked with were more pro
nounced and syncopated. At
times this second piece re
sembled a gospel work as Jar
rett beat out his own per
cussion accompaniment by
banging on the stage floor with
his foot, and by knocking on
the piano with one hand.
At this point the audience
could no longer contain itself,
and howls and cheers broke
into a great chant of clapping.
Jarrett then seemed to become
distracted. He rose from the pi
ano bench and began clapping

with the audience. When after
a long pause he returned to the
keyboard, he had resolved sim
ply to give the people what
they had asked for: they
wanted to hear themselves,
and not him. He brought his
piece to a rapid close, and
walked off stage again.

Only a round of thunderous
applause and calls for encoures
brought Jarrett back for a third
and final piece. This was a
quick, hummingbird dance
along the scales in the upper
register. When he brought this
third piece and the concert to a
conclusion, it was with a short

melodic refrain that left ev-;
eryone with a tune that they
could whistle as they walked
out into the fine spring night.
Jarrett had taken the members
of the audience through
vast hollows of his musical soul,,
let them join with him in re
ligious inspiration, and left:
them with something that they
might be able to relate to the!
songs they would hear on the:
radio the next day: he re-:
mained in complete control
throughout the concert.
I cannot recall seeing a per-!
formance I have enjoyed .as;
much in some time, although t
wish that Jarrett had played
longer. If there is one thingthat
he can be faulted for, it is per
haps the extreme jealousy with
which he guards his musical vi
sions. One criticism that has
been made of Jarrett's work is
that he frequently does not
perform well with other musi
cians. He has a lonely style. Thus
introspection, or -sen-cen{f#R
edness, was evident even in his
solo concert in the manner
that he reacted to the au
dience's clapping during the
second piece.
If you choose to listen to Jar
rett, you must hold yourself in
check, even if you remain in
awe: he will take you where he
wants to go, and nowhere else.
At the end of the evening he
told the story of a music master
who could evoke countless
colors and emotions with his
music. "At the end you felt per
plexed .. . that's the important
thing."
