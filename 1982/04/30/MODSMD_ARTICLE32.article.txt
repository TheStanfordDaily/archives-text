# Sound-of-the-seagulls, smell-of-the-sea
## Dining by the wharf: seafood in the best tradition 
### 
The Waterfront
Pier 7, San Francisco
The quest for a fine fish din
ner in San Francisco all too
often leads to the proverbial
flip of the coin as one stands
beneath the giant neon signs at
Fisherman's Wharf. Tourist lore
has it that one can hardly go
wrong when choosing among
names like Alioto's, Sabella's,
Tarantino's, Castagnola's.
Unfortunately, all too often
visitors come away from the

wharf disappointed in their
meals, and it's rarely the fault of
the coin; to their credit, these
restaurants are expected to
mass produce top quality meals
for the hundreds of souvenier
laden tourists with cranky chil
dren who wander in each day,
often more tired than hungry
aftersightseeing and shopping.
Yet diners — be they tourists or
not — are paying the tab for a
fine dinner and deserve one,
regardless of their dispositions
or moods.

Indeed, part of going native
in the City by the Bay is know
ing where to eat. As most resi
dents will confirm, when it
comes to fish, the best dinners
available are almost always
found off the beaten path. Un
fortunately the fishing boats,
and vats of crabs steaming
along the dock and salt air
don't follow one inland; much
of the atmosphere must fre
quently be sacrificed.
Fortunately, however, there
is the Waterfront, one of San

Francisco's finest seafood res
taurants which serves ex
traordinary meals and com
bines a bit of the sound-of-the
seagulls and smell-of-the-sea
at its location at Pier 7 along the
Embarcadero.
The Waterfront sits beneath
the shadow of a monstrous
concrete freeway ramp about a
block from the Ferry building.
Once inside, the diner be
comes a part of the wharf, as
tall windows offer a charming
view of the rough hewn dock

and pilot boats gently bobbing
at their berths only a few yards
away.
In the tiered-style of Borel's,
the Waterfront offers a pleas
ant view to all of its patrons in a
not-too-crowded, yet large ca
pacity dining area.
There's a sense of humour
about the place which em
braces its stylish decor, over
head fans and rather formally
dressed waiters. The sly crab on
the menu promises a meal de
signed, not simply prepared.
Appetizers of crab, oyster,
clam and salmon delicacies are
a rich and flavorful start; our
waiter suggested the Ceviche
Supreme ($4.25), salmon and
sea bass marinated in lemon
juice with onions, tomatoes
and cilantro. While it was de
licious with a hunk of tart
sourdough bread, the Su
preme is very rich beginning,
and we only nibbled at our
shared order. The Ceviche
again appears in the salad cate
gory, but we chose simpler of
ferings in a delicious Boston
clam chowder ($2.25) and a
house salad ($2.25).

There's a sense of humour about the place
which embraces its stylish decor,
overhead fans and rather formally
dressed waiters. The sly crab on the menu
promises a meal designed, not simply
prepared.

From the midst of an ex
tensive assortment of seafood
entrees and the obligatory
steak and lobster offerings, I
chose the broiled swordfish
while my partner chose the
evening special — salmon
stuffed with crab and shrimp,
served in hollandaise sauce
($11.95).
I prefer simply prepared
seafood, myself, and the
broiled swordfish was the best I
have ever had. Hands down. I
could not finish the rich filet,
which was cooked to per
fection.
The special was superb, but
we would advise planning
ahead when ordering ap-

petizers and soup or salad, as
three dishes featuring rich
shellfish are a bit overpower
ing. The dishes are prepared at
tractively and served with au
gratin potatoes. Other possi
bilities include Calamari
Marinara ($6.95); Gulf Prawns
Meuniere ($11.25); ; poached
Deep sea bass ($10.25); and
Abalone Almondine ($21.95).

Indeed, part of going native in the City by
the Bay is knowing where to eat. As most
residents will confirm, when it comes to
fish, the best dinners available are almost
always found off the beaten path.

Despite our waiter's strong
recommendation, we were just
not up to sampling any of the
pasta dishes. The pasta selec
tions — ranging from linguine
with a cream and baby clam
sauce ($7.50) to seafood can
nelloni ($6.95) — are best or

dered as the main course, with
perhaps a crab or shrimp louis
and/or the vegetable of the
day. That night, the vegetable

was fresh asparagus, was served
hollandaise sauce.
We would certainly en
courage patrons to enlist the
aid of the Waterfront's waiters,
who are pleasant and helpful.
We were fortunate to be
served by the head waiter,
Michael, who we had to thank
for the excellent recommenda
tion of an Acacia Vineyards'

Chardonnay to accompany our
meal. The wine list features Cal
ifornia selections, exclusively.
Dessert, had we been better
prepared (read 'less full'),
would likely have been more
enjoyable. The chocolate
mousse tort must have
weighed a pound all by itself
but it had a wonderful flavor;
meanwhile an orange-flavored
cake, I found rather strong and
really too sweet.
By dining at the Waterfront,
one can escape the high-pres
sured service and gaudy at
mosphere which plague so
many otherwise good restau
rants in the City, yet also enjoy
the scenic waterfront setting
absent at the more obscure yet
otherwise top-quality seafood
spots like Scott's.
We highly recommend the
Waterfront. A

ant view to all of its patrons in a
not-too-crowded, yet large ca
pacity dining area.
There's a sense of humour
about the place which em
braces its stylish decor, over
head fans and rather formally
dressed waiters. The sly crab on
the menu promises a meal de
signed, not simply prepared.
Appetizers of crab, oyster,
clam and salmon delicacies are
a rich and flavorful start; our
waiter suggested the Ceviche
Supreme ($4.25), salmon and
sea bass marinated in lemon
juice with onions, tomatoes
and cilantro. While it was de
licious with a hunk of tart
sourdough bread, the Su
preme is very rich beginning,
and we only nibbled at our
shared order. The Ceviche
again appears in the salad cate
gory, but we chose simpler of
ferings in a delicious Boston
clam chowder ($2.25) and a
house salad ($2.25).

From the midst of an ex
tensive assortment of seafood
entrees and the obligatory
steak and lobster offerings, I
chose the broiled swordfish
while my partner chose the
evening special — salmon
stuffed with crab and shrimp,
served in hollandaise sauce
($11.95).
I prefer simply prepared
seafood, myself, and the
broiled swordfish was the best I
have ever had. Hands down. I
could not finish the rich filet,
which was cooked to per
fection.
The special was superb, but
we would advise planning
ahead when ordering ap-

petizers and soup or salad, as
three dishes featuring rich
shellfish are a bit overpower
ing. The dishes are prepared at
tractively and served with au
gratin potatoes. Other possi
bilities include Calamari
Marinara ($6.95); Gulf Prawns
Meuniere ($11.25); ; poached
Deep sea bass ($10.25); and
Abalone Almondine ($21.95).

Indeed, part of going native in the City by
the Bay is knowing where to eat. As most
residents will confirm, when it comes to
fish, the best dinners available are almost
always found off the beaten path.

Despite our waiter's strong
recommendation, we were just
not up to sampling any of the
pasta dishes. The pasta selec
tions — ranging from linguine
with a cream and baby clam
sauce ($7.50) to seafood can
nelloni ($6.95) — are best or

dered as the main course, with
perhaps a crab or shrimp louis
and/or the vegetable of the
day. That night, the vegetable

was fresh asparagus, was served
hollandaise sauce.
We would certainly en
courage patrons to enlist the
aid of the Waterfront's waiters,
who are pleasant and helpful.
We were fortunate to be
served by the head waiter,
Michael, who we had to thank
for the excellent recommenda
tion of an Acacia Vineyards'

Chardonnay to accompany our
meal. The wine list features Cal
ifornia selections, exclusively.
Dessert, had we been better
prepared (read 'less full'),
would likely have been more
enjoyable. The chocolate
mousse tort must have
weighed a pound all by itself
but it had a wonderful flavor;
meanwhile an orange-flavored
cake, I found rather strong and
really too sweet.
By dining at the Waterfront,
one can escape the high-pres
sured service and gaudy at
mosphere which plague so
many otherwise good restau
rants in the City, yet also enjoy
the scenic waterfront setting
absent at the more obscure yet
otherwise top-quality seafood
spots like Scott's.
We highly recommend the
Waterfront. A


The Waterfront
Pier 7, San Francisco
The quest for a fine fish din
ner in San Francisco all too
often leads to the proverbial
flip of the coin as one stands
beneath the giant neon signs at
Fisherman's Wharf. Tourist lore
has it that one can hardly go
wrong when choosing among
names like Alioto's, Sabella's,
Tarantino's, Castagnola's.
Unfortunately, all too often
visitors come away from the

wharf disappointed in their
meals, and it's rarely the fault of
the coin; to their credit, these
restaurants are expected to
mass produce top quality meals
for the hundreds of souvenier
laden tourists with cranky chil
dren who wander in each day,
often more tired than hungry
aftersightseeing and shopping.
Yet diners — be they tourists or
not — are paying the tab for a
fine dinner and deserve one,
regardless of their dispositions
or moods.

Indeed, part of going native
in the City by the Bay is know
ing where to eat. As most resi
dents will confirm, when it
comes to fish, the best dinners
available are almost always
found off the beaten path. Un
fortunately the fishing boats,
and vats of crabs steaming
along the dock and salt air
don't follow one inland; much
of the atmosphere must fre
quently be sacrificed.
Fortunately, however, there
is the Waterfront, one of San

Francisco's finest seafood res
taurants which serves ex
traordinary meals and com
bines a bit of the sound-of-the
seagulls and smell-of-the-sea
at its location at Pier 7 along the
Embarcadero.
The Waterfront sits beneath
the shadow of a monstrous
concrete freeway ramp about a
block from the Ferry building.
Once inside, the diner be
comes a part of the wharf, as
tall windows offer a charming
view of the rough hewn dock

and pilot boats gently bobbing
at their berths only a few yards
away.
In the tiered-style of Borel's,
the Waterfront offers a pleas
ant view to all of its patrons in a
not-too-crowded, yet large ca
pacity dining area.
