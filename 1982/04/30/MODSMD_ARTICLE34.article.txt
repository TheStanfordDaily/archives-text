## Savoyards capture charm of Gilbert & Sullivan production 
### Robert Riggs 
According to Gilbert & Sul
livan historians, The Yeoman of
the Guard was Sir Arthur Sul
livan's favorite opera among
the 13 he scored for lyricist Wil
liam Schwenck Gilbert. It
seems Sir Arthur's work filled
him with tragically contradic
tory feelings.
A man who yearned for
greatness as a classical com
poser, he found it only as a
writer of "common" music:
His musical adaptations of Gil
bert's lyrics. Consequently, he
felt half-scorn for many of his
most acclaimed creations as
vulgarities fit only for con
sumption by the masses.
Supposedly, Yeoman of the
Guard was his favorite because
its script is least prone to the
excesses of popularization. It
lacks the magic potions, fairy
spells, and witch's curses that
Sullivan's aristocratic peers
considered the cheapest ele
ments of other Gilbert & Sul
livan works. Still, the Stanford
Savoyards have captured much
charm in their spring per
formance of Yeoman.
The Gilbert & Sullivan style is
consummately English; other
wise it is difficult to categorize.
Yeoman lacks the majestic arias
that would constitute it serious
opera, yet it features the typi
cally ingenious romantic Sul
livan score of undeniably high
quality.
The plot is simple and
Shakespearean. The best gen
ius of the work probably lies in
the famous staccato songs,
which can be reminiscent of a
slightly cleaned-up Benny Hill
(who they clearly foreshadow
artistically). Unlike Benny,
however, the Gilbert lines are
wit, not bawd, and if well-per
formed produce more titters
than guffaws.
This combination of musi
cality and comedy is not alto
gether easy to pull off suc
cessfully, but the Savoyards
have done a solid job. The star
of the evening is Kevin Skiles as
Colonel Fairfax, the con
demned British officer whose

head the good guys in the op
era are seeking to save from the
block.
Gilbert was a barrister before
he conceived the notion that
he was a comedy writer, and
the legal background shows up
in the script's unlikely premise:
Fairfax has been unjustly ac
cused of sorcery as a result of
the connivings of a powerful
relative to whom Fairfax's es
tate would devolve should he
die unmarried.
To thwart the knave, Fairfax
arranges to marry the first
woman who chances by the
Tower of London; she consents
only because of the promise
that she will be widowed
within the hour. The prisoner's
inevitable escape gives rise, of
course, to merry conundrums
for both bride and groom.
The twists and turns provide
Skiles with plenty of op
porunities to show off his mag
nificent vocal skills inthe Fair
fax role. For an amateur group,
the remainder of the case
maintains a surprisingly high
level of musicality.
What some perhaps lack in
power, they make up for in ac
curacy. In particularly, Jac
queline Dickey as Elsie, the
bride, and Jennifer Sullivan as
Phoebe, the woman who save
Fairfax, display pretty voices.
Irish Bourdart also turns in a
noteworthy singing per
formance as Dame Carruthers,
the Tower matron. The players
are consistently well-backed
by the pit orchestra, under the
direction of Sharon Paul.
The quality of the acting is
also good, although Gilbert &
Sullivan does not demand a
tremendous degree of subtle
ty. Todd Schurk does a find job
as Jack Point, Elsie's jester
fiancee jilted by her marriage
to Fairfax. Schurk draws a few
laughs with his riddles, some of
which are better than, "What is
the different between Jack
Point and the Archbishop of
Canterbury?" (Answer:
"Whereas the Archbishop is
paid 10,000 pounds a year for
being good, I am good — for

nothing!") (incidentally, the
Archbishop didn't like it,
either.)
The biggest kudos for 'his
Yeoman of the Guard produc
tion must go to stage director
Anton Orazem, who has or
chestrated the play magnif
icently. Two brilliant examples

are the "bullfight" scenes that
he introduces between
Phoebe (Sullivan) and Wilfred
Shadbolt (Ed Glazier), the
rogue jailer who loves her. In
the first, a pink handkerchief is
used by Phoebe to entice Shad
bolt; in the second, Shadbolt
captures Phoebe's white hand

kerchief as he extracts a reluc
tant promise of marriage.
These scenes have been very
well directed; they yield hu
mor without the burlesquerie
to which the bullfight
metaphor se often descends.
Orazem has also done an ex
cellent job of orchestrating the

24-member Chorus of the
Guard across the Dinkelspiel
stage.
Yeoman of the Guard will
again be performed by the
Savoyards at 8 p.m. this Friday
through Sunday, Apr. 30 —
May 2. General Admission is $3
for students, and $5 for others.

The performance lasts a good
two and a half hours, so don't
count on it if you are planning
on a quick getaway. Otherwise,
Yeoman is a good bet to send
you home with a smile on your
face.

Orazem has also done an ex

24-member Chorus of the

Yeoman of the Guard will
again be performed by the
Savoyards at 8 p.m. this Friday
through Sunday, Apr. 30 —
May 2. General Admission is $3
for students, and $5 for others.

The performance lasts a good
two and a half hours, so don't

Yeoman is a good bet to send

Savoyards' Yeomen of the Guard
According to Gilbert & Sul
livan historians, The Yeoman of
the Guard was Sir Arthur Sul
livan's favorite opera among
the 13 he scored for lyricist Wil
liam Schwenck Gilbert. It
seems Sir Arthur's work filled
him with tragically contradic
tory feelings.
A man who yearned for
greatness as a classical com
poser, he found it only as a
writer of "common" music:
His musical adaptations of Gil
bert's lyrics. Consequently, he
felt half-scorn for many of his
most acclaimed creations as
vulgarities fit only for con
sumption by the masses.
Supposedly, Yeoman of the
Guard was his favorite because
its script is least prone to the
excesses of popularization. It
lacks the magic potions, fairy
spells, and witch's curses that
Sullivan's aristocratic peers
considered the cheapest ele
ments of other Gilbert & Sul
livan works. Still, the Stanford
Savoyards have captured much
charm in their spring per
formance of Yeoman.
The Gilbert & Sullivan style is
consummately English; other
wise it is difficult to categorize.
Yeoman lacks the majestic arias
that would constitute it serious
opera, yet it features the typi
cally ingenious romantic Sul
livan score of undeniably high
quality.
The plot is simple and
Shakespearean. The best gen
ius of the work probably lies in
the famous staccato songs,
which can be reminiscent of a
slightly cleaned-up Benny Hill
(who they clearly foreshadow
artistically). Unlike Benny,
however, the Gilbert lines are
wit, not bawd, and if well-per
formed produce more titters
than guffaws.
This combination of musi
cality and comedy is not alto
gether easy to pull off suc
cessfully, but the Savoyards
have done a solid job. The star
of the evening is Kevin Skiles as
Colonel Fairfax, the con
demned British officer whose

head the good guys in the op
era are seeking to save from the
block.
Gilbert was a barrister before
he conceived the notion that
he was a comedy writer, and
the legal background shows up
in the script's unlikely premise:
Fairfax has been unjustly ac
cused of sorcery as a result of
the connivings of a powerful
relative to whom Fairfax's es
tate would devolve should he
die unmarried.
To thwart the knave, Fairfax
arranges to marry the first
woman who chances by the
Tower of London; she consents
only because of the promise
that she will be widowed
within the hour. The prisoner's
inevitable escape gives rise, of
course, to merry conundrums
for both bride and groom.
The twists and turns provide
Skiles with plenty of op
porunities to show off his mag
nificent vocal skills inthe Fair
fax role. For an amateur group,
the remainder of the case
maintains a surprisingly high
level of musicality.
What some perhaps lack in
power, they make up for in ac
curacy. In particularly, Jac
queline Dickey as Elsie, the
bride, and Jennifer Sullivan as
Phoebe, the woman who save
Fairfax, display pretty voices.
Irish Bourdart also turns in a
noteworthy singing per
formance as Dame Carruthers,
the Tower matron. The players
are consistently well-backed
by the pit orchestra, under the
direction of Sharon Paul.
The quality of the acting is
also good, although Gilbert &
Sullivan does not demand a
tremendous degree of subtle
ty. Todd Schurk does a find job
as Jack Point, Elsie's jester
fiancee jilted by her marriage
to Fairfax. Schurk draws a few
laughs with his riddles, some of
which are better than, "What is
the different between Jack
Point and the Archbishop of
Canterbury?" (Answer:
"Whereas the Archbishop is
paid 10,000 pounds a year for
being good, I am good — for

nothing!") (incidentally, the
Archbishop didn't like it,
either.)
The biggest kudos for 'his
Yeoman of the Guard produc
tion must go to stage director
Anton Orazem, who has or
chestrated the play magnif
icently. Two brilliant examples

are the "bullfight" scenes that
he introduces between
Phoebe (Sullivan) and Wilfred
Shadbolt (Ed Glazier), the
rogue jailer who loves her. In
the first, a pink handkerchief is
used by Phoebe to entice Shad
bolt; in the second, Shadbolt
captures Phoebe's white hand

kerchief as he extracts a reluc
tant promise of marriage.
These scenes have been very
well directed; they yield hu
mor without the burlesquerie
to which the bullfight
metaphor se often descends.

cellent job of orchestrating the

24-member Chorus of the
