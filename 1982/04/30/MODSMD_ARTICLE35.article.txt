j, An evolutionary primer, or:
How I Learned to Stop Worrying
and Love Cosmic Mutation.
Stanley Kurbrick's epic rewrite
of the Book of Revelation finds
mankind ready to make a giant
Ifeap into the unknown. In
Kubrick's vision, what we're leap
ing from is particularly bleak. His
characters are engulfed in tech
nology that makes life com
! fortable and boring. Surrounded
E t|y the splendid emptiness of
i space, they seem drained and va
§ cant: they've carried the work
E ethic out between the planets.
E Space must ultimately be a seduc
\ ttess, and mankind meets its
| greater fate only through the
§ kindness of strangers.
§ With Keir Dullea, Gary
| Lockwood, and a computer
1 named Hal. Plays tonight and
| tomorrow with Kubrick's A
Clockwork Orange.

1 'Altered States *
S- New Varsity, Palo Alto
§T Altered States is the world's
|[ first 70-millimeter, six-track ster
-3 eo Looney Tune. It's brightly col
li ered, wonderfully noisy, and ut
s terly vacuous.
g Ken Ru«seH (Women in Love,
s Tommy) directed; Paddy
S Chayefsky (Marty) wrote the
1 script. This tale of a man who
f§ turns into an ape and does other,

equally eccentric things after he
takes a rare drug reflects the
worst aspects of both its creators.
Russell gives it pointless visual
flamboyance; Chayefsky lends it
pointless visual discussions
("What is man? Is there a God?
When do we eat?"). Its special ef
fects, however, are very pretty —
the movie practically begs you to
stop thinking long enough to en
joy them — and the soundtrack
("Megasound") is loud and
creepy. It's amazing what great
things you can do with noideasat
all.
Tonight only with The Man
Who Fell to Earth.

Spellbound
Fox, Redwood City
The screenplay, by Ben Hecht,
is an amazingly literal rendering
of psycho-analysis (with nodding
references to such juicy topics as
"the labyrinth of the guilt com
plex"), and, for once, Hitchcock
seems to be more concerned
about what the people are doing
rather than what they're think
ing. Gregory Peck, who plays a
guilt-ridden amnesiac as inex
pressively as he plays everything
else, doesn't do much to help
matters. But his co-star, Ingrid
Bergman, is one of Hitchcock's
favorite actresses, and when she's
on-screen she warms the film's
rather icy narrative and makes it
seem almost inviting. Hitchcock
puts in some beautiful touches: a
wide-angle flashback where,
concisely and stunningly, we see
the cause of the hero's condition;
a funny, touching love scene
where the Bergman's first kiss is
symbolized by a series of opening
doors; and the firing of a revolver
as seen from the point of view of a
suicide victim.
Triple-billed on Sunday with
Rebecca and Notorious.

Missing **★
Palo Alto Square
Costa-Ga vras' political
melodrama take place in Chile
during the 1973 coup, but it
seems to be set in hell. The film,
made with an open leftist bias, is a
stunning demonstration of what
it is like to be in a country in a
state of seige, and as the wife of
the missing American, Sissy
Spacek does her best work in
years. However, there is a second
plot — the politicization of her
father-in-law, dreadfully played
by jack Lemmon — that nearly
wrecks the movie. '<

The Paper Chase
Saturday, Cubberley
Timothy Bottoms plays a stu
dent at Harvard Law School. John
Houseman plays a professor who
proudly displays a heart of ice.
Lindsay Wagner plays an attrac
tive young woman who plays lit
tle purpose in the plot — maybe
she was a friend of the producer.
This movie is all about how mi
serable first-year law students
are. No notes, books, or brief
cases will be allowed into the
auditorium.

Atlantic City ****
Mountain View Theater
One character in Atlantic City
tells another, "I never wear seat
belts — I don't believe in grav
ity." It's evident that director
Louis Malle and screenwriter
John Guare don't believe in grav
ity, either — their movie, which
deals with love, chance, and co
caine-peddling, levitates effort
lessly between black comedy and
pathos, without ever quite settl
ing in either condition. Susan
Sarandon plays Sally, a waitress
studying to be a blackjack dealer,
and Burt Lancaster plays Lou, a
former second-rate gangster now
turned second-rate numbers
runner. Both are better than
they've ever been. The superb
supporting cast includes Kate
Reid and Robert Joy.

Arthur
New Varsity, Palo Alto
Not a great movie, but often
quick enough, and witty enough,
and warped enough to make it far
more enjoyable than the other
comedies that were foisted upon
us last summer. Dudley Moore, in
the title role, plays an incredibly
wealthy alcoholic who falls in
love with the guttersnipe played
by Liza Minnelli, who spends her
time shoplifting and dreaming of
being an actress. The movie's real
love match, however, is between
Moore and |ohn Gielgud, who
plays Arthur's aging valet and
best friend. Gielgud's so good
that the movie dies a little
whnever he's offscreen.
Starts next Thursday with
Private Benjamin.

Notorious *★★★
Fox, Redwood City
Notorious, directed by Alfred
Hitchcock, is a spy story done
with the wit and grace of high
comedy; it is among the most
beautifully crafted films of the
genre. This is a film composed of
gleaming surfaces: keys,
winebottles, and teacups take on
a glowing sheen of intrigue. Cary
Grant plays an American agent
who must discover the secrets of
Claude Rains. The device he uses
is Ingrid Bergman. The film's iro
ny is that Rains engages our sym
pathies more than Grant does —
Rains is the member of the tri
angle who knows the least and
whose love is most sincere.
Ted Tetzlaff did the stunning
black-and-white photography;
Ben Hecht wrote the script.
Triple-billed on Sunday with
Rebecca and Spellbound.

Rebecca
Fox, Redwood City
Rebecca, based on the novel
by Daphne du Maurier, was
Alfred Hitchcock's first American
movie. Lawrence Olivier marries
sweet young Joan Fontaine and
brings her home to manage his
estate; complications arise when
she can't reach the standards set
by Olivier's late, first wife. Fon
taine's character is so timid that
we never learn her name (the title
refers to the dead wife), and she
creeps about the mansion like a
tourist in a museum after closing
time. Hitchcock's rendering of
the mansion's oppressiveness is

very fine — he makes gloom =
seem tangible.
Triple-billed on Sunday with |
Rebecca and Notorious.

Private Benjamin ★★
New Varsity, Palo Alto
A Goldie Hawn production of |
a Goldie Hawn star vehicle. The 112
movie is a big-budgeted "Perils |
of Goldie." Hawn plays a know- |
nothing rich girl who loses her 5
husband, meets the reality of the 112
army, grows up, becomes inde- |
pendent thinking. Hawn's talents |
are considerable, but she's lost s
much of her perspective here — 112
many of her best sequences are 112
pushed beyond the breaking |
point. Director Howard Zieff |
(Hearts of the West) has a nice |
comic touch, but he stumbles \
badly when the movie takes a ro- \
mantic turn.
Starts next Thursday with ;
Arthur.

Das Boot ★★★V!i
Bijou, Palo Alto
A solidly crafted movie by Ger
man director Wolfgang Peterson,
distinguished by other World
War II U-boat pictures by its per- \
spective: almost the entire film is
shot within the submarine, so we
experience the attacks of the the
British vessels as the crew of the
boat does. The picture is also a
small, funny essay on the horrors
of intimate communal living, but
when it veers off into character
detail or observations of conflict
between humanitarian and polit
ical ideals, it becomes a little pre
tentious. The downer of an end
ing is a cheat.

Fantasia
Belmont 3, Belmont
In the late'3os, Walt Disney de
cided to "do" Bach, Beethoven,
Stravinsky, and others in a car
toon extravaganza which set the
music to motion. Bach and
Beethoven were dead already,
but Stravinsky, it's said, was a little
bitter about seeing Rite of Spring
transformed into an evolutionary
allegory, with swamps and
dinosaurs and such. Actually, the
only truly embarassing sequence
is, The Pastoral Symphony, now
become a half-baked Olympian
frolic with cutesy fauns and
faunettes. The rest of the movie is
usually enjoyable and in at least
three comes close to
brilliance. In the sequence built
around Paul Dukas' The
Sorcerer's Apprentice, Mickey
Mouse misapplies his master's
magic and ends up nearly
drowned beneath a flood of
buckets and broomsticks. The
Dance of the Hours is the movie's
funniest and one of its best
animated, with dancing os
triches alligators, and hippos.
(Ponchielli, like Beethoven and
Bach, was beyond caring what
happened to his music.) The
next-to-last sequence, set to
Moussorgsky's Night on Bald
Mountain, contains some of Dis
ney's most impressive — and
frightening — animation.
In its latest re-release, Fantasia
has been revamped with a digital
stereo soundtrack.
