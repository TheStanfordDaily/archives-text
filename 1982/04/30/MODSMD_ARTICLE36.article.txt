Edit board meeting today
Don't be tempted by the sun — or try not to. Now that the ASSU elections
are over we can get on to bigger and better topics (and probably get finished a
whole lot earlier). Remember today's meeting: 12:30 in the edit o" : ce.
Remember Bleacher bums
Even those of you staffers who forgot to sign up for the cheap tickets to
Bleacher bums are invited to come with those who did. We're getting togeth
er at 7:30 p.m. in the Daily office for a pre-game pep talk and will take the field
at 8 p.m. It's been rumored that the festivities will continue after the game too,
so think about making a night out of it, especially if you like Irish coffee.
First-year staffers
It's coming. Cub reporters and editors should start planning the annual
first-year staffers issue, which is slated this year for Monday, May 10. "First
year" means just that; everything for that issue must be reported, written and
edited by cub staffers. There are other traditions, too. But you'll find out abobt
those soon enough...
