# Fee assessment plan, nuke referendum pass
## 
### Douglas Jehl 
The student body yesterday voted
overwhelmingly to amend the ASSU
constitution so that only students
who vote can claim fee assessment
refunds.
Voters also strongly supported a
referendum urging that the U.S. gov
ernment propose a bilateral, mutual
ly verifiable freeze on nuclear weap
ons to the government of the Soviet
Union.
Seventy-six percent of the voters
backed the fee assessment amend
ment, which needed a two-thirds
margin to pass. Theamendment does
not govern the collection of fees au
thorized by thiselection, but the new
system will be in effect for the next
fee assessment election, which will
likely take place next spring.
The passing of the amendment is
likely to be the final step in a process
that began early last quarter when
the ASSU Senate rules committee,
concerned over the large numbers of
students who requested refunds,
began debating possible alternatives
to the present system.
After the senate was unable to de
cide between proposals for a man
datory assessment system or the so
called "refunds-to-voters system,"
the senate placed a referendum on

the April 14-15 ballot asking voters to
decide between the two. The student
body voted by a 9-1 margin in favor of
the refunds-to-voters system.
The senate then placed that plan
on yesterday's ballot in the form of
the constitutional amendment, al
though the ballot itself did not speci
fy how the fee assessment system
would be changed upon passage of
the amendment. Instead, it de
scribed the amendment as a "reform
of the fee assessment system" and re
ferred voters to the text of the
amendment that was printed in the
ASSU Spring Elections Handbook.
"We had a poor system; now we
have a system that although it is not
perfect, is more fair to student
groups," Senate Rules Committee
Chair Jim McGrath told the Daily last
night.
"It doesn't satisfy anyone per
fectly, but it really is a very good com
promise," McGrath said. McGrath
had supported the refunds-to-voters
system from the start, often over
strong objections voiced by other
senators.
Some ASSU officials last night ex
pressed concern that the University
might not accept the amendment be
cause it creates a three-dollar As
sociation Fee that will replace indi
vidual fee assessments for the Publi
cations Board, the Academic Or
ganizations Board and the Program
Fee, and which will be assessed auto
matically without appearing on elec
tion ballots. The Board of Trustees
must approve all constitutional
amendments.
Larry Ausubel, a member of the

Stanford Progressive Alliance who
was instrumental in gathering signa
tures to place the nuclear freeze ref
erendum on the ballot, last night said
"even more than we expected, the
Stanford student body is overwhelm
ingly against the nuclear arms race."
The referendum was supported by 85
percent of the voters.
Juniors also elected the Bollard
Slate of Joe DelHierro, Katy Dore,
Kevin O'Beirne and Mary
Ruckleshaus as next year's senior
class presidents. The Bollard Slate de

feated the Four Play Slate by a 415-238
margin.
Also includedon yesterday's ballot
was a space to write-in candidates to
sit on the Student Conduct Legisla
tive Committee (SCLC) because no
one declared his candidacy for the
position. The ASSU elections com
mission last night refused to release
the names of those who received
write-in votes because the votes from
the overseas campuses (which won't
be tallied until the middle of next
week) might drastically change the
results.
