# Fee assessment plan, nuke referendum pass
## 
### Douglas Jehl 
The student body yesterday voted
overwhelmingly to amend the ASSU
constitution so that only students
who vote can claim fee assessment
refunds.
Voters also strongly supported a
referendum urging that the U.S. gov
ernment propose a bilateral, mutual
ly verifiable freeze on nuclear weap
ons to the government of the Soviet
Union.
Seventy-six percent of the voters
backed the fee assessment amend
ment, which needed a two-thirds
margin to pass. Theamendment does
not govern the collection of fees au
thorized by thiselection, but the new
system will be in effect for the next
fee assessment election, which will
likely take place next spring.
The passing of the amendment is
likely to be the final step in a process
that began early last quarter when
the ASSU Senate rules committee,
concerned over the large numbers of
students who requested refunds,
began debating possible alternatives
to the present system.
After the senate was unable to de
cide between proposals for a man
datory assessment system or the so
called "refunds-to-voters system,"
the senate placed a referendum on

the April 14-15 ballot asking voters to
decide between the two. The student
body voted by a 9-1 margin in favor of
the refunds-to-voters system.
The senate then placed that plan
on yesterday's ballot in the form of
the constitutional amendment, al
though the ballot itself did not speci
fy how the fee assessment system
would be changed upon passage of
the amendment. Instead, it de
scribed the amendment as a "reform
of the fee assessment system" and re
ferred voters to the text of the
amendment that was printed in the
ASSU Spring Elections Handbook.
"We had a poor system; now we
have a system that although it is not
perfect, is more fair to student
groups," Senate Rules Committee
Chair Jim McGrath told the Daily last
night.
"It doesn't satisfy anyone per
fectly, but it really is a very good com
promise," McGrath said. McGrath
had supported the refunds-to-voters
system from the start, often over
strong objections voiced by other
senators.
Some ASSU officials last night ex
pressed concern that the University
might not accept the amendment be
