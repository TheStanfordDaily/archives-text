Little hope for peace in Falklands
Washington â€” As a British air and sea blockade went into effect this
morning and Argentina proclaimed a war zone of its own, the Reagan
administration all but conceded the failure of its peace efforts in the
Falkland Islands crisis. "There is very little basis for optimism" that war
can be averted in the South Atlantic, it declared.
"The situation remains very serious," spokesmen at both the White
House and State Department said in identical statements yesterday.
"There is no movement. However, we remain in touch with both
parties."
State Department spokesman Dean Fischer said that, in Secetary of
State Alexander Haig's view of the situation, "there is very little basis for
optimism ... that a peaceful resolution can be achieved." The White
House gave the same assessment of the crisis in its statement.
Argentine Foreign Minister Nicanor Costa Mendez, who had met
Haig late Wednesday and promised an answer "as soon as possible" toa
final U.S. proposal for compromise, flew to New York yesterday without
seeing Haig again. An Argentine Embassy spokesman said Costa
Mendez planned to return to Argentina today.
Late yesterday, Argentina's official information agency Telam re
ported that the U.S. proposals were rejected. The agency said that the
Argentine ambassador in Washington, Esteban Takacs, delivered a reply
to Assistant Secretary of State Thomas Enders that called for "further
clarifications."
Later, in a closed briefing on Capitol Hill, Haig told the House Foreign
Affairs Committee and the bipartisan leadership of the House that the
situation looked bad and that an outbreak of fighting seemed immi
nent, committee members said.
