Little hope for peace in Falklands
Washington — As a British air and sea blockade went into effect this
morning and Argentina proclaimed a war zone of its own, the Reagan
administration all but conceded the failure of its peace efforts in the
Falkland Islands crisis. "There is very little basis for optimism" that war
can be averted in the South Atlantic, it declared.
"The situation remains very serious," spokesmen at both the White
House and State Department said in identical statements yesterday.
"There is no movement. However, we remain in touch with both
parties."
State Department spokesman Dean Fischer said that, in Secetary of
State Alexander Haig's view of the situation, "there is very little basis for
optimism ... that a peaceful resolution can be achieved." The White
House gave the same assessment of the crisis in its statement.
Argentine Foreign Minister Nicanor Costa Mendez, who had met
Haig late Wednesday and promised an answer "as soon as possible" toa
final U.S. proposal for compromise, flew to New York yesterday without
seeing Haig again. An Argentine Embassy spokesman said Costa
Mendez planned to return to Argentina today.
Late yesterday, Argentina's official information agency Telam re
ported that the U.S. proposals were rejected. The agency said that the
Argentine ambassador in Washington, Esteban Takacs, delivered a reply
to Assistant Secretary of State Thomas Enders that called for "further
clarifications."
Later, in a closed briefing on Capitol Hill, Haig told the House Foreign
Affairs Committee and the bipartisan leadership of the House that the
situation looked bad and that an outbreak of fighting seemed immi
nent, committee members said.
"There were no new developments that would lead
you to be any more optimistic" than that, Rep. John
Leßoutillier (R-N.Y.) said after the briefing.
"The whole question here is the national honor of
both countries," he said. "(Haig) still thought a diplo
matic (solution) would end up happening some time
— but whether that's before, during or after the fight
ing, who knows?"
As the declared deadline arrived for Britain's total
air and sea blockade of the islands, it appeared that
fighting was more likely than renewed talking.
In London, Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher told
an emergency session of Parliament that "gentle per
suasion is not going to make the Argentine govern
ment give up what it has seized by force.
"The key to peace is in the hands of the Argentine
government," she said. "The responsibility is theirs."
Salvadoran president elected
San Salvador — El Salvador's constituent assembly
elected banker Alvaro Magana provisional president
of the nation yesterday, ending a month of struggle
over the division of power by also naming three vice
presidents, one from each major party.
The agreement, pressed by the armed forces with
strong U.S. encouragement, creates at least the
facade of a government of national unity assigned to
wage war against leftist guerrillas, agree on the future
of existing social reform programs and continue to re
ceive U.S. military and economic aid.
Magana, 56, accused by his opponents of being
dangerously leftist, was supported by the largest par
ty, the Christian Democrats, and the third-ranking
National Conciliation Party.
The three vice presidents, in order of their suc
cession to the presidency, are Raul Molina, leader of
the traditionally conservative National Conciliation
Party; law Prof. Gabriel Mauricio Gutierrez Castro of
the second-ranking and extreme rightist Nationalist
Republican Alliance (ARENA from the Spanish), and
Fidel Chavez Mena of the centrist Christian Demo
crats, who is minister of foreign relations under the
current military-civilian junta.
Deep divisions among these men and their parties
will not be healed overnight. It was not certain until
minutes before the vote that the fragile alliance be
tween Christian Democrats and National Conciliation

would survive a strong challenge from ARENA and
others of the extreme right. Howling opponents
packed the assembly galleries, waving signs and
shouting their pain to the end over what they said was
a betrayal of the March 28 election results.
They passed out leaflets that attacked Magana, a
Roman Catholic, as "a little Jew" and a communist
whose election would be treason.
But leaders of the three warring groups had met
Wednesday night at a private home with the military
high command, who "pleaded more than ordered"
that the parties agree so that U.S. aid would continue,
according to one party official.
Violence erupts in the West Bank
Jerusalem — A new round of violence erupted in four
towns in the occupied West Bank yesterday, with Is
raeli troops firing on rock-throwing Palestinians, kill
ing two students and wounding others.
A third Palestinian died in an Israeli hospital of a
gunshot wound received in a demonstration on April
12, bringing to 15 the number of protesters reported
by Arab sources to have been killed by troops or
armed civilian settlers since widespread protests
began on March 18 after the first of three West Bank
mayors was summarily removed from office by Israeli
authorities for alleged incitement.
An Arab news agency, the Palestine Press Services,
said that in addition to 15 killed, it had a list of more
than 200 protesters wounded in clashes with Israeli
forces since March 18.
An Israeli army spokesman, in response to an in
quiry, said nine Arab youths have been killed by army
gunfire since March 18 and two soldiers have died,
one stabbed to death in Jenin and another killed by a
hand grenade thrown by Arabs in the Gaza Strip. He
said 90 Arabs have been wounded by gunfire and 33
soldiers and 16 Israeli civilians have been injured in
rock-throwing clashes.
The wide disparity in the reported numbers of Ar
abs wounded has been attributed, in part, by Israeli
military sources and Palestinians to a reluctance by
youths lightly wounded to go to a hospital out of fear
that they will be interrogated by security forces. Many
of them obtain treatment in private clinics instead,
the sources said.
The clashes yesterday, which followed more than a
week of relative calm, underscored the chain-reac
tion nature of much of the violence in the West Bank,

where reports of confrontations travel fast and some
times fuel further confrontations.
The trouble began about 7:30 a.m. in Halhoul, on
the outskirts of Hebron. Students raised a Palestinian
flag, set fire to gasoline-soaked tires and erected rock
barricades across the Jerusalem-to-Hebron road.
Palestinian sources said that when an army patrol
arrived, the youths threw rocks and bottles at them.
Israeli authorities said the soldiers first tried to dis
perse the crowd with teargas and warning shots fired
into the air but that when the rock-throwing "became
risky to the troops," they fired into the crowd, aiming
at the legs.
One student, Jamal Mousa Shalaldeh, 17, was shot
in the throat and died on the way to a hospital. The
army command said two other students were shot,
but Palestinian sources said 15 were shot, most of
whom sought treatment at private clinics for light
gunshot wounds.
Shortly after Shalaldeh's death, word reached his
home village of Sair, a few miles away, and rock
throwing demonstrations erupted there, prompting
security forces to impose a curfew, military sources
said. The army command said that at about 10:30 a.m.
the curfew was broken and an army patrol clashed
with rock-throwing youths, opening fire and killing
Abdel Rahaim Abdel jaradat, 17. Halhoul and Sair re
mained under curfew yesterday night.
State income growth slow
Washington — In contrast to California's national im
age as a land of booming sunbelt salaries, the state ac
tually had a lower income growth rate during the
1970s than the nation as a whole, recently tabulated
1980 census data indicate.
Adjusted for inflation, California's median family
income grew by only 1.1 percent from 1969 to 1979
while the nation recorded a 4.9 percent increase. Cali
fornia ranked in the bottom quarter of states in rate of
real income growth per family, but the state's $21,479
median family income in 1979, still exceeded the na
tional median of $19,908.
On the other hand, the state lived up to its national
image as a land of unraveling marriages, with five Cali
fornia metropolitan areas heading the national rank
ing of large urban areas in percentages of divorced or
separated persons.
California's 1.1 percent growth in family median in

come during the 1970s was exceeded by every
Western state, except Hawaii. The greatest national
increases in family income were recorded in Wyo
ming, with 27 percent, and Mississippi, with 24.2 per
cent. Texas increased by 15.3 percent and Florida by
7.3 percent.
California's income growth rate was even exceeded
by some economically troubled Midwestern states
like Ohio and Illinois. On the other hand, a few
Northeastern states, including New York and Con
necticut, actually declined in real income per family
during the 19705.
George Patterson, chief of the Census Bureau's in
come statistics staff, said that the bureau had not
analyzed the cause of California's relatively slow
growth in median income, but suggested that the
causes could be found in the large influx of Mexican
immigrants and in the increase in families headed by
females, which typically have a lower-than-average
income.
Of all the nation's metropolitan areas of over a mil
lion persons, Los Angeles-Long Beach had the highest
portion — 19 percent — of women who had ever
been married and were either divorced or separated
in 1980. Ranked next in that category, by which the
Bureau measures "marital disruption," were San
Francisco-Oakland with 18.2 per cent; Sacramento
with 17.8 per cent; San Jose with 17.4 per cent and San
Diego with 17.3 per cent.
Stocks still retreating
The stock market's broad retreat extended into a
third straight day yesterday as the collapse of budget
negotiations between President Ronald Reagan and
Congress renewed concern over prospects for re
covery from recession.
The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials dropped
7.70 to 844.94, bringing its loss over the past three ses
sions to 20.64 points.
Five stocks fell in price for every two that rose on
the New York Stock Exchange. Gold was $348.95 per
troy ounce in New York.
Today's Weather
Sunny and warm today. Highs upper 60s at the coast
to near 80 inland. Light winds.
