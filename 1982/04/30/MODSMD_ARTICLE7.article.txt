# Policy prohibiting student repairs problematic
## 
### David Azrin (Last in a series) 
One afternoon last quarter, Kelvin
Davis, an ASSU senatcr-elect, was
throwing darts at his dart board. He
took aim and threw, missing the dart
board and cracking his window.
Having repaired broken windows
before at home, Davis decided to fix
the window himself. He kept the
drapes closed so that the main
tenance people would not see the
broken window. But before he had a
chance to fix it, the maintenance
people spotted it. They repaired the
window and handed Davis the bill.
The present University policy on
student repairs only allows students
to change their light bulbs, paint
their room to personalize it, do ex
traordinary cleaning after house ac
tivities.
According to Ed Scoles, director of
housing management, the policy is
based on three considerations: the
quality of student repairs, the safety
of student workers and the Univer
sity's agreements with United Stan
ford Employees Local 680 (USE).
But Scoles said that he and Norm
Robinson, associate dean of residen

tial education, hope to formulate a
new policy by the end of spring quar
ter.
"The extent to which students are
permitted to do repairs is really an
open question right now. We're
trying to look at our own policy and
come up with a more formalized ap
proach."
Scoles said that he favors giving
students more freedom to do their
own repairs. "We're looking at the
possibility that students could —

where they've done damage — make
minor repairs such as gluing a leg
back on a table, filling a hole in the
wall, putting up a ceiling tile — it's re
ally no great trick, " he said.
"I feel they should be able to do
those simple household things that
any person with average intelligence
can do without difficulty," he said.
The University recently formed a
committee to examine the issue of
student damages. The committee,
which includes two students, a resi
dent assistant, a resident fellow and
two administrators, met for the first
time Wednesday. Scoles said that he
will consider the committee's find
ings in formulating the new policy.
The current policy has met with
considerable opposition from stu
dents who want to repair their own
damages. "We're being charged in
credible amounts of money when
the students can do these things
themselves. It's just ridiculous that
we're not given the opportunity to fix
these things if we're qualified," Davis
said.
Davis said that he and Rod
Beckstrom, chair-elect of the Coun
cil of Presidents, are considereing

setting up a formal system sponsored
by the ASSU where students could
hire other qualified students to do
repairs.
"We could have students hired
and contracted for five or six dollars
an hour. It would not only save the
students money but provide a lot of
students with needed jobs," Davis
said.
Window repairmen in Operations
and Maintenance are paid $9.80 per
hour.
University administrators object to
students doing any major repairs, es
pecially where there is a risk to the
student's safety or where a skill is re
quired.
"Anyone can put in a window.
Hell, it's not that difficult. But you're
not going to be putting them in the
way they ought to be. You just don't
know the tricks of the trade," said
lames Horgan, director of operations
and maintenance.
"It's not that students could not go
in and do it, but students go up and
down on this issue," he said.
While Scoles said he would like to
see student's doing more simple re


Kity Dore/Daily
pairs, he would not allow students to
do any major repairs.
"We're going to crack down on
students doing repairs where per
sonal safety is involved, such as glass,
mechanical work, plumbing and
electrical work," he said.
The union is also concerned about
students doing more repairs. Accord
ing to Tim Johnson, president of USE,
"I know the students want to work
and save a little cash for the week
ends. But the workers, they have fam

ilies to support. For us, it's a matter of
survival.
"We don't have a beef with the stu
dents. Our beef is with (University
President) Donald Kennedy. Man
agement is trying to use the union as
a scapegoat," he said.
Scoles claimed that his program of
allowing students to do more minor
repairs would not encroach on union
jobs. "The program I'm talking
about, it's so minor, that if you take
all the work that would be done by
students in this regard, you might be
looking at one percent of the total
maintenance repair work and that's
certainly not going to endanger any

workman's job," he said.
The enforcement of the present
policy has been an integral part of the
University's year-long program to
make students more accountable for
their damages. The formal an
nouncement of a new policy is
needed, according to Scoles, be
cause the University has had many
problems with the present policy.
Problems have arisen in enforcing
the current policy because, in the
past, the policy was never followed
rigidly in all of the residences. In the
Row and cluster houses, students

have been allowed to do many major
and minor repairs. In the various resi
dence halls, the policy had been en
forced differently by the different
residence adminstrators.
"Everybody had their own ideas
about the policy," said Victoria
Baker, office assistant at Stern.
