## Western Culture update—fine tuning the program 
### Bob Cohn 
There is a quote in Approaching Stanford that says,
"You have lots of freedom at Stanford to choose what
classes to take. That is, after you complete Western Cul
ture, Freshman English, eight distribution requirements
..To many freshmen, Western Culture is the most in
teresting, thought-provoking, controversial and certain
ly most demanding of these requirements.
The Western Culture Program began almost two years
ago largely as a response to pressure from members of
the Humanities Department. A relative of the old
Western Civilization requirement, Western Culture of
fers seven "tracks" — Great Works, History, Humanities,
Values Technology and Science, Philosophy and Re
ligion, Comparative Literature and Structured Liberal
Education — which place an emphasis on the integration
of history and literature.
Some potentially problematic issues that the Western
Culture Program faces are excessive reading require
ments, a disparity in the workloads among the various
tracks, a decline in the writing ability of students and an
overworked faculty. Proponents of the program are busy
trying to solve problems and prove that making Western
Culture a requirement two years ago was not a mistake.
Last spring the program underwent extensive eval
uations from both students and faculty. According to
Professor Charles Lyons, head of the Drama Department
and Chairman of the Western Culture Program Commit
tee, "The evaluation went over the course syllabi, read
sample papers, midterms and finals and then used both
the ASSU and our own yearlong evaluation forms. It's
rather unusual to do that extensive of an evaluation after
the first year, but we wanted to assure ourselves that we
were doing the best possible job."
More than four out of five of last year's Western Cul
ture students thought the Program had been a "very

positive" or "positive" academic experience, according
to a survey they completed, thereby assuring Lyons they
had indeed done a good job. While Lyons interprets
these findings as "good news about the course," he ad
mits that "the evaluations pointed out some things to
work on and we're working on them."
Professor Ron Rebholz, chairman of the Great Works
track and one of the founding fathers of the program,
recognized that the "difficulty of all the tracks is that
there's too much reading and therefore the coverage is
too minimal. "The difficulty," Rebholz explained, "is
getting people to cut the (core reading) list." Lyons also
expressed concern about the reading, stating that he
wished "there was a way to schedule less reading and
more substantial and contemplative thought."
Yet some see the reading load as beneficial. "It in
troduces you to a wide variety of thoughts and ideas
without dwelling on any one particular author," offered
Jenny Daves, a Great Works student. "We read a lot, but
we shouldn't read any less because it's better to get a lot
of breadth rather than specificity."
Marcia Diaz, also studying Great Works, voiced a more
familiar sentiment. "I think the course could be im
proved because they give us 15 books to read and only
two days per book. Rather we should read five books per
quarter and go into more detail."
The difficulty seems to lie in which works to omit. A
committee selects a core list that all tracks must read. Ac
cording to Linda Johnson, a sophomore majoring in Hu
man Biology and a student member of the Western Cul
ture Program Committee, there is an 'A' list, which is re
quired for all seven tracks and a 'B' list, which is recom
mended. Johnson said the goal is "to encourage people
to read all the 'A' stuff and take a good representative
sample from the recommended list as well."
Johnson noted that some tracks, like Great Works,

elect more from this 'B' list than do the others. Of the
seven tracks, many perceive Great Works as having the
toughest reading load.
Lyons said that he is "concerned about the disparity in
the workloads."A student in VTS admitted that "You do
less reading than they do in the other tracks. You're not
tested on the lectures or readings. Nobody even did the
reading until this quarter, when they started assigning
one page papers." Tom O'Reilly, a freshman in Human
ities, observed that, "Anything is harder than VTS — it's
just for the engineers." Tommy Battat, admittedly a
potential engineer, countered that "VTS is especially
good because it gives you a perspective that is different
from the other tracks."
Johnson explained that people with engineering in
terests are drawn to VTS because, if they are forced to
take a literature class, VTS seems most suited to their aca
demic needs. She added that one of the purposes of her
committee is to try and maintain a balance of both sexes
and academic interests in all the tracks.
"I think it would be impossible to put in Approaching
Stanford that VTS is easier than Great Works," said
Rebholz. "VTS is extremely popular because of its de
scription in Approaching Stanford. People perceive that
course as fulfilling their math/science interests." The
only way that people can discover that workloads are
vastly different," he added, "is by coming is the autumn
and talking to people. There are switches in September."
At the Faculty Senate meeting on April 1, Chairman
Lyons made his annual address on the state of the pro
gram. As a whole, the meeting revealed a concern for the
writing ability of the students. Lyons was quoted in an
April 7 article in Campus Report about the meeting as
claiming that students are coming to Stanford "with de
creasing levels of writing ability," and now have skills
"radically different" — and poorer — than 20 years ago.
Other faculty members teaching in the Program ex

pressed a similar concern.
Probably the most serious problem facing the Western
Culture Program at this point is the access and availability
of enough teachers. The common consensus is that the
faculty, especially the "lecturers" who teach the small
discussion groups in courses like Great Works, are over
worked. Considering that beginning with next year
transfer students will be required to take Western Cul
ture, an addition of some 270 spots, the enlargement of
the teaching staff will be essential.
"Across the board they're trying to increase the
number of people (to teach) in order to diminish the size
of classes," said Rebholz. He expressed special concern
for the lecturers in his Great Works track, who are pres
ently responsible for teaching 60 students in small dis
cussion groups each quarter.
Lyons also said that new faculty must be brought into
the program, yet he noted the economic constraints.
"Much of the program relies on departments volun
teering their faculty. I think we need to have a more for
malized budget plan."
The most controversial issue seems to be concerning
the merits of Western Culture being a requirement.
Rebholz explained that it was instilled after a two year pi
lot program which came "as a result of pressure from the
people in the Humanities Circle."
Diaz stressed, "I don't think that it should be a year re
quirement because it's not fair to people who aren't in
terested in humanities. They don't make people who
aren't interested in science take three quarters of sci
ence."
"It's stuff that you might never take and that you
should know," confessed Robert Northcutt, a Great
Works students interested in math/science. It's a fair re
quirement. It's for people who are closed-minded — like
me."

tested on the lectures or readings. Nobody even did the
reading until this quarter, when they started assigning
one page papers." Tom O'Reilly, a freshman in Human
ities, observed that, "Anything is harder than VTS — it's
just for the engineers." Tommy Battat, admittedly a
potential engineer, countered that "VTS is especially
good because it gives you a perspective that is different
from the other tracks."
Johnson explained that people with engineering in
terests are drawn to VTS because, if they are forced to
take a literature class, VTS seems most suited to their aca
demic needs. She added that one of the purposes of her
committee is to try and maintain a balance of both sexes
and academic interests in all the tracks.
"I think it would be impossible to put in Approaching
Stanford that VTS is easier than Great Works," said
Rebholz. "VTS is extremely popular because of its de
scription in Approaching Stanford. People perceive that
course as fulfilling their math/science interests." The
only way that people can discover that workloads are
vastly different," he added, "is by coming is the autumn
and talking to people. There are switches in September."
At the Faculty Senate meeting on April 1, Chairman
Lyons made his annual address on the state of the pro
gram. As a whole, the meeting revealed a concern for the
writing ability of the students. Lyons was quoted in an
April 7 article in Campus Report about the meeting as
claiming that students are coming to Stanford "with de
creasing levels of writing ability," and now have skills
"radically different" — and poorer — than 20 years ago.
Other faculty members teaching in the Program ex

pressed a similar concern.
Probably the most serious problem facing the Western
Culture Program at this point is the access and availability
of enough teachers. The common consensus is that the
faculty, especially the "lecturers" who teach the small
discussion groups in courses like Great Works, are over
worked. Considering that beginning with next year
transfer students will be required to take Western Cul
ture, an addition of some 270 spots, the enlargement of
the teaching staff will be essential.
"Across the board they're trying to increase the
number of people (to teach) in order to diminish the size
of classes," said Rebholz. He expressed special concern
for the lecturers in his Great Works track, who are pres
ently responsible for teaching 60 students in small dis
cussion groups each quarter.
Lyons also said that new faculty must be brought into
the program, yet he noted the economic constraints.
"Much of the program relies on departments volun
teering their faculty. I think we need to have a more for
malized budget plan."
The most controversial issue seems to be concerning
the merits of Western Culture being a requirement.
Rebholz explained that it was instilled after a two year pi
lot program which came "as a result of pressure from the
people in the Humanities Circle."
Diaz stressed, "I don't think that it should be a year re
quirement because it's not fair to people who aren't in
terested in humanities. They don't make people who
aren't interested in science take three quarters of sci
ence."
"It's stuff that you might never take and that you
should know," confessed Robert Northcutt, a Great
Works students interested in math/science. It's a fair re
quirement. It's for people who are closed-minded — like
me."
There is a quote in Approaching Stanford that says,
"You have lots of freedom at Stanford to choose what
classes to take. That is, after you complete Western Cul
ture, Freshman English, eight distribution requirements
..To many freshmen, Western Culture is the most in
teresting, thought-provoking, controversial and certain
ly most demanding of these requirements.
The Western Culture Program began almost two years
ago largely as a response to pressure from members of
the Humanities Department. A relative of the old
Western Civilization requirement, Western Culture of
fers seven "tracks" — Great Works, History, Humanities,
Values Technology and Science, Philosophy and Re
ligion, Comparative Literature and Structured Liberal
Education — which place an emphasis on the integration
of history and literature.
Some potentially problematic issues that the Western
Culture Program faces are excessive reading require
ments, a disparity in the workloads among the various
tracks, a decline in the writing ability of students and an
overworked faculty. Proponents of the program are busy
trying to solve problems and prove that making Western
Culture a requirement two years ago was not a mistake.
Last spring the program underwent extensive eval
uations from both students and faculty. According to
Professor Charles Lyons, head of the Drama Department
and Chairman of the Western Culture Program Commit
tee, "The evaluation went over the course syllabi, read
sample papers, midterms and finals and then used both
the ASSU and our own yearlong evaluation forms. It's
rather unusual to do that extensive of an evaluation after
the first year, but we wanted to assure ourselves that we
were doing the best possible job."
More than four out of five of last year's Western Cul
ture students thought the Program had been a "very

positive" or "positive" academic experience, according
to a survey they completed, thereby assuring Lyons they
had indeed done a good job. While Lyons interprets
these findings as "good news about the course," he ad
mits that "the evaluations pointed out some things to
work on and we're working on them."
Professor Ron Rebholz, chairman of the Great Works
track and one of the founding fathers of the program,
recognized that the "difficulty of all the tracks is that
there's too much reading and therefore the coverage is
too minimal. "The difficulty," Rebholz explained, "is
getting people to cut the (core reading) list." Lyons also
expressed concern about the reading, stating that he
wished "there was a way to schedule less reading and
more substantial and contemplative thought."
Yet some see the reading load as beneficial. "It in
troduces you to a wide variety of thoughts and ideas
without dwelling on any one particular author," offered
Jenny Daves, a Great Works student. "We read a lot, but
we shouldn't read any less because it's better to get a lot
of breadth rather than specificity."
Marcia Diaz, also studying Great Works, voiced a more
familiar sentiment. "I think the course could be im
proved because they give us 15 books to read and only
two days per book. Rather we should read five books per
quarter and go into more detail."
The difficulty seems to lie in which works to omit. A
committee selects a core list that all tracks must read. Ac
cording to Linda Johnson, a sophomore majoring in Hu
man Biology and a student member of the Western Cul
ture Program Committee, there is an 'A' list, which is re
quired for all seven tracks and a 'B' list, which is recom
mended. Johnson said the goal is "to encourage people
to read all the 'A' stuff and take a good representative
sample from the recommended list as well."
Johnson noted that some tracks, like Great Works,

elect more from this 'B' list than do the others. Of the
seven tracks, many perceive Great Works as having the
toughest reading load.
Lyons said that he is "concerned about the disparity in
the workloads."A student in VTS admitted that "You do
less reading than they do in the other tracks. You're not
tested on the lectures or readings. Nobody even did the
reading until this quarter, when they started assigning
