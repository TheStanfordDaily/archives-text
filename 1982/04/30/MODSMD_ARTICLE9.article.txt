# Weekend in Watsonville
## Farm life away from 'The Farm' 
### Katie Smith 
Driving in to downtown, they passed
the movie theater billing "Johnny
Chicano," slipped by the hole-in-the
wall "La Colima Real" cafe and viewed
numerous members of Watsonville's 90
percent Mexican American community.
Then, arriving at the garage-like head
quarters of the United Farm Workers, 15
students began the Stanford Commitee
on Hunger's (SCOH) "rural plunge"
weekend.
The weekend's events consisted of an
evening spent with UFW staff and farm
worker families, a chance to talk with and
help workers in the lettuce and
cauliflower fields and an opportunity to
tour the facilities of Monterey
Mushrooms (a UFW contract) and speak
with the farm's management.
Byron Bland, minister of United Cam
pus Christian Ministries and a member of
SCOH saw the weekend as an opportuni
ty "to become acquainted with the strug
gle of farm workers and in particular to
learn how people must struggle to gain
the power to address their situation."
Student Gerald Scallon saw the relation
of the weekend to SCOH as part of "mak
ing students more aware that hunger and
food production is in all areas of society."
The learning began Friday evening
when students and farmworkers shared a
meal at the home of Raphael Morales, a
young man of Guadalajara-Haliscan ori
gin, who is director of the UFW'S field of
fice in the Watsonville/Pajaro region.
Morales explained that the biggest prob
lem that the UFW faced after its 1962 con
ception was overcoming the workers'
own fear of social action. He described
workers who preferred to work non-UFW
contracts for less pay and without medical
or social security benefits, because they
were afraid, in a sense, of having rights to
guard.
According to Morales, the history
which spawned this attitude is one of clas
sic labor exploitation. When agriculture
first blossomed in the Salinas Valley,
Japanese peasants were brought over to
work the fields. Then, when they started

having families and "cultivating their own
gardens," they were dismissed to the less
fertile side of the tracks — Pajaro, and a
new source of labor was found in single
males, enticed from the Phillipines by il
lusions of American wealth. Learning
from their past "mistakes," Californians
prevented these men from using family
labor to begin their own farms, by passing
a law in the 30s that prohibited the new
crop of workers from taking non-Phillip
ino spouses. Thus tillers were effectively
married to growers' soil.
When this law was finally revoked in
the 50s, many Phillipino's moved to settle
in Pajaro and the Mexicans became the
next candidates for the "American
Dream." Growers have historically en
couraged Mexican illegal alien labor and
then used the threat of deportation as a
controlling device. Workers without their
"green cards" often hesistate to join the
UFW for fear that growers will then look
into their residence status. Fear of rub
bing shoulders too closely with the "gr
ingos" has also resulted in relatively few
landed-immigrant Mexicans pursuing
U.S. citizenship status, even though such
status is now quite accessible and would
allow them to immediately bring their
families across the border.
Nevertheless, the UFW has proven that
relationships between workers and
growers can be saprophytic. When the
group toured Monterey Mushrooms on
Saturday, industrial relations manager
Ken Allonso had much to say about the
progress of employee/management
dynamics.
"When I applied for the job here in '79,
I was told there were labor problems —
then, my first day of duty, 200 workers
came storming down to the entrance gate
shaking their tools and shouting
'Queremos contratoKWe want a con
tract).' " The workers were awarded their
UFW contract that same year and since
then Allonso and Morales have worked
together on management and worker de
mands/grievances.
Allonso recalled one situation where
workers did not want to carry their five to

eight pound mushroom baskets the quar
ter mile or so from the "picking station"
to the packaging lot. "Don't you guys
have to go back that way any how to get to
your cars at the end of the day?" Morales
had asked with his ever-present smile.
Yes, they did and so the argument ended.
He went on to describe a Salinas farm
which proved it could not financially
meet UFW wage contracts (usually about
$6 per hour) and how in deference the
Union had agreed to a lesser wage there.
"We don't want to run farms out of busi
ness," said Morales, "If they will show us
their books, we can discuss com
promises." Scallon felt the tour helped
the group discard the assumption "that all
labor contracts are anti-management."
Although Morales admitted that past
Union victories like the lettuce strike of
'79 had cost some workers "everything
they had including their lives," he said
that increasingly UFW struggles in hisarea
are not based in power or worker de
mands but on matters of personal dignity.
"We want to hold as rights what growers
have tried to extend to us as privileges."
Besides a decent wage, medical and social
security benifits, these rights include hir
ing and firing through the union on a
basis of rules, not personal preference.
Living conditions for the farm worker
families range from cramped trailer lots to
small homes like that of Ines and
Mercedes Marines, parents of five, who
hosted three of the SCOH members. "It
was nice to actually meet a family and
they really went out of their way to tell us
about themselves and their children."
said one of their guests, Marcia Preciado.
Working on the cauliflower farm, Pre
ciado spoke with workers who "felt that
owners discriminated against Union
members.. .and would not give UFW
workers good references," (perhaps part
of the sentiment that has caused the UFW
membership to drop from 100,000 to
30,000 workers in the past few years). She
went on to describe the tension that de
scended on the group when the farm's
owner showed up to find out who the
SCOH members were.

Workers on the lettuce farm expressed
satisfaction with the life they had found in
Watsonville. "But college is better in
Mexico because it's free," added one
field hand. The same worker inquired
about Stanford. "Everybody there is a
doctor or engineer?.. .Are there many
Mexicans?"
SCOH member Myrna Irigon met a
Phillipino worker in his 70s who was still
single, but said he liked working in Cali
fornia because "of all the pretty women."
Irigon felt that while she learned a lot, she
didn't think the workers knew why the

students were there. "There wasn't
enough time. I had a positive feeling
about the union members but I don't
think they wanted to say much. When I
started to ask more pointed questions
one worker replied 'Excuse me, can I go
take my break now?"
Nevertheless, the general feeling
amongst workers was expressed by the
old Phillipino who said, "It's better than it
was." And Morales said he hopes that
with time and continued efforts at com
promise and understanding the obstacles
of fear can be overcome.

FIELD WORK — Members of Stanford's Committee on Hunger spent a week
end living and working with union farmworkers in Watsonville. During the
weekend, students ana farmworkers had an opportunity to learn about one
another and their respective lifestyles.
