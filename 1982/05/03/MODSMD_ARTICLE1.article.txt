Come and get it!
Four students passed out free ice cream last Friday in White Plaza to students who said they had
voted for Le Slate in the recent Council of Presidents election. Le Slate, whose members are Brett
Love, Margot Sherr. Mike Seigel, and Tomasso the fruit vendor, was a write-in candidate in this last
election. In giving the ice cream to students who claimed to have voted for them they were trying to
demonstrate that they had garnered enough votes to force a runoff.
