What kind of event would include a storyteller, country
western music, square-dancing, a bake-off, a pie-eating contest,
and a tug of war?
A turn-of-the-century county fair, of course!
The first annual American County Fair, held as an American
Studies House theme project, gave Flo Mo field a festive at
mosphere Saturday afternoon from noon until 5 p.m.
According to senior Nancy Alpert, about 100 people attended
the fair. But she stressed, "The people who are here are having a
good time."
Livestock, frisbee-playing, balloons, and game booths all added
to the eclectic air.
The dunking booth was particularly popular. Senior Ken
Abrams, a dunking booth victim, said about 100 contestants tried
to dunk him during a one and a half hour period, but only two
succeeded.
The pie-eating contest, won by freshman Bob March, also at
tracted a large crowd. About seven contestants attacked Marie

Callender's pies without aid of silverware. "I just drove my face
into it," said junior Mike Novik of his technique.
Food also lent a taste of the turn-of-the-century. Lemonade and
15 cent popcorn led sophomore Katrin Tobin to emphasize the
"old-fashioned prices."
The egg throw attracted over 30 contestants, as partners tossed
raw eggs from increasing distances. Senior Joe Zamora, beaten af
ter having his egg break in his hand, cracked, "It's better to end up
with egg in your hand than egg in your face."
Entertainment throughout the afternoon included Texas Flyer,
a country western group; the Fleet Street Singers, a barber shop
quartet; the Mendicants; story-teller Ken Millikan; banjo player
Ben Norris; and guitar players Andy Fisher and John Hajda.
Sophomore Erin Stevenson, who produced the fair with senior
Sue Schultz, called it the biggest event that American Studies has
put on this year.
Game booths ensured that most guests did not leave empty
handed. Prizes ranged from frozen yogurt to books to record
albums.
