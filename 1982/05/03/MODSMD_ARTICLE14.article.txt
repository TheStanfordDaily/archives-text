### 
Tempe, Ariz. — On a recent Tues
day night in this Phoenix suburb, ap
proximately 1000 students and young
professionals from nearby Arizona
State University were enjoying them
selves as if there were no tomorrow.
And yet it was reportedly a slow night
by local standards.
Indulging in drink, rock n' roll and
video games, among other amuse
ments, they were doing so underone
enormous roof. They were patron
izing Tempe's "Devil House," one of
a chain of arena-sized "pleasure
domes" catering to college towns.
What we saw may have been ex
emplary of the inevitable conflict be
tween restraint and self-indulgence,
and how easily we fail to juggle the
two.

Undergraduates at
MIT are planning a
full-page ad for The
New York Times this
month. In the ad
they'll cite the names
of 10 congressmen
with the "worst"
records on student
aid cuts. Meanwhile,
600 students at the
University of Missouri
have "declared war"
on President Ronald
Reagan, allying
themselves with
about 50 other
schools which have
issued similar
vendettas.

Tempe's monstrous Devil House,
on one hand, plays to the public's
long-standing fears of intemperance
and unruliness. Pleasure domes en
courage excess. Their carnival-like
atmosphere and easy accessibility
(not to mention 25 cent beers) seem
to elicit decadence. Thus, we foresaw
many undergrads returning home to
tally wasted.
At the same time, however, with so
much of the bar market sequestered
under one roof, drunk drivers and
crowd control become less of a prob
lem for the local authorities.
We had enough of Devil House af
ter one night. But it may take more
evenings for others to grow tired of
the noise, crowds and vacuous rou
tine. That's part of growing old, we

guess.

How neutral were the U.S. govern
ment observers at the recent
Salvadoran elections? In his election
diary, which he recently turned over
to Notre Dame University's student
newspaper, Father Theodore
Hesburgh reveals his inclinations:
"We're going to try to enter some
of the regions where the guerrillas
say they are in control, and perhaps
by landing there and looking at the
polls and encouraging the people
who are voting there," Hesburgh
wrote, "we may be able to give a
body-blow to the guerrilla forces. It's
a fairly fai -out chance, but it seems to
all of us that unless we do this we are
not really going to pass muster with
the large press corps here ..."

For what it's worth, Argentina's
military junta may have acted too
quickly in ordering a ban on imports
from the EEC (European Economic
Community). Though the Common
Market has halted all exports to Ar
gentina as well, it turns out the ruling
generals have a contract to purchase
plastic, computer-coded identity
cards from a West German company.
Every man, woman, child and poten
tial subversive was going to receive
one.

The U.S. Geological Survey has re
cently revised its estimates of the
amount of oil remaining to be dis
covered in the United States — up
ward.
According to the USGS, 82.6 billion
barrels of oil are sitting unearthed
somewhere, just waiting for the Exx
on crowd. In 1975 the estimate was 82
billion barrels. Meanwhile, estimates
of undiscovered natural gas have
risen 23 percent over the 1975 figure
to 598 trillion cubic feet.

Making a killing off Karen
Silkwood? At least count, the anti
nuclear movement could boast at
least two books, two films, two tele
vision programs, two songs and one
play about the mysterious death of
the Kerr-McGee employee. In 1974
Silkwood died in an auto accident on
her way to a meeting with a New York

safety violations at a Kerr-McGee

Update on student loans: Though
further cuts in student loan and grant
programs aren't likely this year, stu
dents continue to organize around
the possibility. Undergraduates at
the Massachusetts Institute of Tech
nology are planning a 112r 1 ' iage ad
for The New York Times this month.
In the ad they'll cite the names of 10

congressmen with the "worst" rec
ords on student aid cuts. Meanwhile,
600 students at the University of Mis

dent Ronald Reagan, allying them

Can the nuclear-arms-freeze
movement affect the deliberations of
Congress? Watch the House of Rep
resentatives in the coming weeks for
a clue. Members will soon debate on
administration proposal to imple
ment a revised $4.2 billion civil de
fense program. The White House be
lieves proper planning could save up
to 160 million Americans in the event
of a nuclear attack. Skeptics, how
ever, think civil defense is not only
pointless, but also based on the as
sumption that nuclear war is in
evitable. These days, more Ameri
cans are less willing to be so fatalistic.

According to the USGS, 82.6 billion

of undiscovered natural gas have
risen 23 percent over the 1975 figure
to 598 trillion cubic feet.

Tempe, Ariz. — On a recent Tues
day night in this Phoenix suburb, ap
proximately 1000 students and young
professionals from nearby Arizona
State University were enjoying them
selves as if there were no tomorrow.
And yet it was reportedly a slow night
by local standards.
Indulging in drink, rock n' roll and
video games, among other amuse
ments, they were doing so underone
enormous roof. They were patron
izing Tempe's "Devil House," one of
a chain of arena-sized "pleasure
domes" catering to college towns.
What we saw may have been ex
emplary of the inevitable conflict be
tween restraint and self-indulgence,
and how easily we fail to juggle the
two.

Undergraduates at
MIT are planning a
full-page ad for The
New York Times this
month. In the ad
they'll cite the names
of 10 congressmen
with the "worst"
records on student
aid cuts. Meanwhile,
600 students at the
University of Missouri
have "declared war"
on President Ronald
Reagan, allying
themselves with
about 50 other
schools which have
issued similar
vendettas.

Tempe's monstrous Devil House,
on one hand, plays to the public's
long-standing fears of intemperance
and unruliness. Pleasure domes en
courage excess. Their carnival-like
atmosphere and easy accessibility
(not to mention 25 cent beers) seem
to elicit decadence. Thus, we foresaw
many undergrads returning home to
tally wasted.
At the same time, however, with so
much of the bar market sequestered
under one roof, drunk drivers and
crowd control become less of a prob
lem for the local authorities.
We had enough of Devil House af
ter one night. But it may take more
evenings for others to grow tired of
the noise, crowds and vacuous rou
tine. That's part of growing old, we

guess.

How neutral were the U.S. govern
ment observers at the recent
Salvadoran elections? In his election
diary, which he recently turned over
to Notre Dame University's student
newspaper, Father Theodore
Hesburgh reveals his inclinations:
"We're going to try to enter some
of the regions where the guerrillas
say they are in control, and perhaps
by landing there and looking at the
polls and encouraging the people
who are voting there," Hesburgh
wrote, "we may be able to give a
body-blow to the guerrilla forces. It's
a fairly fai -out chance, but it seems to
all of us that unless we do this we are
not really going to pass muster with
the large press corps here ..."

For what it's worth, Argentina's
military junta may have acted too
quickly in ordering a ban on imports
from the EEC (European Economic

generals have a contract to purchase
plastic, computer-coded identity
cards from a West German company.
