# Africa rapport rides on Clark
## 
### 
Last fall, the U.S. Senate, with the
strong backing of the Reagan admin
istration, adopted an amendment to
the foreign aid bill that would repeal
the so-called Clark Amendment. The
Senate's action was subsequently de
leted from the bill during a con
ference committee markup; but the
possibility that another attempt at re
peal may be made later this year
raises serious questions about the
future of U.S. policy in Africa.
The Clark Amendment was ori
ginally enacted after Congress
learned that the Ford administration
had provided more than $20 million
in covert military aid and assistance
to two of the three contending politi
cal groups (FNLA and UNITA) during
the 1975-1976 civil war in Angola,
without the prior knowledge or ap
proval of Congress. This secret oper
ation had only escalated the conflict,
causing further deaths and destruc
tion in Angola.
The passage of the Clark Amend
ment in 1976 reflected the view of the
Congress that the United States
neither promoted its own interests
nor enhanced the prospects of a
peaceful solution by conducting an
ill-conceived covert operation, an
operation carried out with the ap
parent help of South Africa.
The Clark Amendment requires
the president to submit a detailed,
unclassified statement explaining
why he believes that supplying as
sistance to the Angolan rebels would
be "important to the national secur
ity interests of the United States," af
ter which the Congress must give its
express authorization to any re
quested aid.
A repeal of the Clark Amendment
would, however, undermine our
three basic policy objectives in
southern Africa and Africa as a
whole, namely (1) the achievement
of independence and the peaceful
transition to majority rule in
Namibia; (2) countering Soviet,
Cuban and East German interven
tion; and (3) improving our ties with
nations throughout the African con
tinent.
With regard to Namibia, lifting the

Clark Amendment would seriously
impair the efforts of the United Na
tions and the Western Contact
Group (France, Great Britain, West
Germany, Canada and the United
States) to resolve the current crisis.
For the past four years, the U.N. and
the Contact Group have been seek
ing the full implementation of Secur
ity Council Resolution 435, an in
ternationally-accepted plan which
provides for Namibian independ
ence and a peaceful transition to ma
jority rule.
As the key member of the
Frontline states (which also include
Tanzania, Botswana, Zimbabwe,
Zambia and Mozambique) and the
principal mediator for the forces of
the South-West African People's Or
ganization (SWAPO), Angola has
long played a critical and construc
tive role in the Namibian nego
tiations.
To repeal the Clark Amendment
and open the way for covert U.S. as
sistance to UNITA — the primary op
position party dedicated to over
throwing the MPLA government —
would threaten the security of
Angola and thereby decrease the
likelihood that Angola would accept
proposals either for a demilitarized
zone located in its territory or for a
cease-fire.
Moreover, lifting the ban on CIA
paramilitary activity in Angola would
be certain to result in a breakdown in
relations with the other Frontline
states and with SWAPO, rendering
the attainment of a solution accep
table to all parties even more dif
ficult.
As far as the Cuban troops in
Angola are concerned, a repeal of
the Clark Amendment would clearly
not lead to a withdrawal or a reduc
tion in the number of those troops;
in fact, it would do just the opposite.
A repeal of the amendment, by
threatening to destabilize the cur
rent government in Luanda, would
increase, not diminish, the reliance
Angola now has on Cuban troops for
its perceived security needs.
If the Reagan administration is seri
ous about its desire for the withdraw
al of Cuban troops from southern
Africa, it should pursue a policy that
will bring true independence and
majority rule to Namibia, leading to
the end of South African incursions
into Angola. By contrast, a policy
which overlooks the South African
raids and which seeks instead to re
peal the Clark Amendment will only*

prolong the Cuban presence in the
area.
Finally, repealing the Clark;
Amendment would have a potential
ly disastrous effect on U.S. relations
throughout Africa. African nations
have made it clear that they oppose
the lifting of the Clark Amendment
or any other attempts by the United,
States to provide covert aid to
UNITA. ~
U.S. relations with African states,
would be further damaged by the
clear perception of a "tilt" toward
South Africa that would be created r
by a repeal of the Clark Amendment.
As early as last summer, the members
of the OAU condemned what they,
see as the Reagan administration's
greater willingness to tolerate South
Africa's racial repression and illegal
dominance over Namibia. If we were
now to repeal the Clark Amendment, •
suspicions about U.S. cooperation.-
with Pretoria would only increase,
risking the alienation of the United-
States from the rest of Africa.
It is important to note that Africans"
are not the only ones who have
voiced their deep concern about the
implications of a repeal of the Clark
Amendment. Members of the Amer- 1
ican business community, including
representatives of Gulf Oil and Cities
Services Company among others,
have also expressed serious reseiva
tions about the far-reaching conse
quences that a repeal would have on
their business interests in Angola and
the rest of Africa.
In sum, the proposed repeal of the
Clark Amendment would be a major
foreign policy blunder. Such an ac
tion would severely damage and deC
lay any prospects for a settlement irr
Namibia. It also would not produce
withdrawal or a reduction in the'
number of Cuban troops based in
Angola; rather, it would lead to
destabilization of the Angolan govC
ernment, thereby increasing the op-;
portunity for further Cuban and So
viet intervention. Finally, a repeal of
the Clark Amendment would have;
serious repercussions on United-
States relations throughout Africa. *
For all these reasons, it is essentiaC
that Congress maintain restrictions
on U.S. military assistance to the*
UNITA forces. That will be the best"
way of safeguarding American in
terests in Angola, Namibia, and the
rest of Africa.
