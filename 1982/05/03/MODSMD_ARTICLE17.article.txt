## Clear-sighted gratitude for the simple things 
### 
My eyeballs were throbbing when
I awoke at 5 a.m., two hours after
going to sleep. I tried everything to
relieve the staggering pain, but noth
ing worked. I suffered in the dark
with a feeling of helplessness that
made me almos.t as miserable as the
intense ache in my eyes. Although
usually a semi-masochist, I was defi
nitely not having fun. It became ap
parent that, after managing to avoid
it for my first year and a half at Stan
ford, I was going to have to go to the
dreaded Cowell Student Health Cen
ter.
A nuse led me through a short
maze of hallways and attended to me
right away. I was still miserable when
I left less than an hour later but my
eyes felt much better. I had a patch
over one eye and couldn't open the
other. It would take a day for the
abrasions on my cornea, caused by
wearing my contacts too long, to
heal.
I did not even have any horror
stories about Cowell to take with me
like most other people I know. They
treated me well and did not am
putate my leg by mistake. I now wish I
knew who to thank but at the time I

just wanted something else to com
plain about.
I slept all day and night and was
fine the next day. I am an expert com
plainer, but I was so happy to see
again that I forgot about the pain and
inconvenience. I had caught up on
my sleep and now saw more than just
my surroundings. I saw how for
tunate I am and how much I take
things for granted. Everything looked
more beautiful than it had just two
days ago. I realized how blessed I was
to have all the things I usually com
plain about. But I did have a new
complaint: people who complain
too much.
Food service is a favorite target for
student complaints. One rarely hears
about the delicious zucchini bread at
Stern, only complaints when there is
no more. People have to listen to
gripes about the food every day, but
no one, especially hashers, wants to
hear them. Your dormmatesand the
hashers do not make the food, so do
not grumble to them about it. If you
have to complain, go to your Food
Service representative or a manager.
Before you do, however, even if it
is a worn out idea, think about the

people in the world who are starving
and be thankful for that cheesy
mushroom tortilla casserole. If you
really consider it, your California
quiche may even begin to taste bet
ter.
The newest campus complaint is
draw numbers. Believe it or not,
many would helve been happy with
4012. Even if you did draw 4996 and
are unguaranteed, you can have a
great time off campus with the right
attitude.
The same people who complained
about the rain last month are now
upset because it is too hot. It is easy to
complain, but it feels better to be
happy and it is not too difficult. No
one wants to hear how much home

work you have, so don't tell them un
less they ask. You don't have to stop
complaining, but complain to people
who are paid to listen, not your
friends all the time.
Even if it is seven months until
Thanksgiving, you have a lot to give
thanks for now. If you wake up
tomorrow in a bed, can see the ceil
ing, can hear the alarm, can walk to
the bathroom, or are not intensely
hungry, give someone a compliment
instead of a complaint.
Stanford is not perfect, but there
are worse things than Cowell, Food"
Service, and the draw. Be glad you're,
not going to Berkeley.
