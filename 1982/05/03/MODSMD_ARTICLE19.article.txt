' Cabaret' re-viewed *
I read with disgust Katie Smith's re
view of the Ram's Head production
of Cabaret {Daily, April 12).
She is undoubtedly too young to
remember the ghastly events that
prompted th£ writing of this musical
but it tells it like it was. I saw the play
on Saturday evening and I was im
pressed. Since I am considerably
older than she I have experienced
things she is going to become aware
of and a production like this one will
be a part of her learning experience.
There are things going on in our
world that we would prefer not to
know about but sometimes it is im
portant to open one's eyes and take a
good hard look.
I know for a fact that the people in
volved in Cabaret worked for many
months to bring a gripping version to
Stanford. They also attended classes
and did the usual 36 hours of home
work each day. They set a mood that
all too realistically reminded us old
folks of the terror that was Nazi Ger
many. We need to be reminded of

that now and then because it can
happen again.
Aside from the dramatic message
we all got, I felt the acting and staging
were outstanding and brought home
the message to me that Stanford in
deed has again shown me what out
standing students it admits.

Rickie Lee Jones' legs
I am writing in response to Mike
Hale's review (Daily, April 12) of
Rickie Lee Jones' recent concert in
Berkeley. The fact is that it took all of
my will power to read through the
entire article because of a remark
made in the second paragraph. Ap
parently, Hale was distracted from
the music by the sight of "the backs
of Rickie Lee Jones' thighs. Too much
cellulite." The implication is that
women with fat thighs are offensive,
and should take care to hide them
selves.
Hale's remark hammers home the
fact that women are expected to live
up to some kind of ideal, to personify
a myth of "perfection." It is no won

der that we have a well-documented
paranoia about our weight and as a
result, a distorted body image.
I suppose that if Jones was thinner,
Hale would have had something fa
vorable to say about her body. But
why mention it at all? What compels
hirn to focus on this aspect of her per
son?

Lemmon's no Lemmon
I take note of Steven Vineberg's
minireview of "Missing" in the Dai
ly's Cinemascope because first, I am
glad to see that this superb movie is
still running and second, I am
astonished anew at Vineberg's lam
entable misunderstanding of the role
played by Jack Lemmon.
It is amazing that the film "Miss
ing" was released to play in this coun
try. The considerable embarrassment
and unease felt by State Department
officials apparently did not inhibit its
release to American audiences. Lem
mon's interpretation of Ed Horman
must be one of the most brilliant per

formances I have ever seen in mov
ies. Curious that Vineberg and other
critics of far more prestige and ex
perience than he seem unable to
grasp the significance of Ed Horman
in the film.
Lemmon's part as Charlie's father
was far more important than that of
the daughter-in-law, and Sissy
Spacek understood her excellent but
secondary role very well — she gave
beautiful support to Lemmon.
Lemmon played a man whose
character, understanding and opin
ions underwent a profound change,
a change pivotal to the stunning im
pact of this important and tragic film.
It seems clear to me that middle-class
and upper middle-class Americans
must blind themselves to what hap
pened in Chile in 1973 because it is
too dreadful for us really to look at. I
think the other actors in this ex
traordinary movie who commanded
my respect as fully as Lemmon were
those who played the bastards in
charge of the U.S. embassy in San
tiago.

Plath work inspirational
I find it incredible that Jonathan
Treitel concluded his otherwise in
teresting review of the journals of
Sylvia Plath (Daily, Apr. 29) by claim
ing that the most interesting part of
Plath's twofold legacy (already a re
ductive scheme) is Ted Hughes'
"symbolic suice" — which consists of
staging a poetic/dramatic ex
travaganza in Greece and then de
stroying his manuscript.
Not only is the relationship of this
and Crow to Plath's suicide an entire
ly hypothetical, speculative, un
substantiated and hence ir
responsible bit of psychologizing on
Treitel's part, but, more seriously, it
chooses to find this "symbolic sui
cide" more interesting than the in
creasing recognition of poetry writ
ten by women, including the popu
larization of Plath's own work, in
which she, and others, find constant
symbols of life and resurrection.
Treitel's assertion is a slap in tne
face. First, it claims that "symbolic
death" is more interesting than life,
symbolic or otherwise. Any serious
appraisal of Plath's poetic career and
life story needs to leave behind this

juvenile fascination with morbidity.
Second, the moral of the story
seems to be that Hughes'
widowhood is more important than
the careers of hundreds of women
who have been inspired by Plath's
work and moved by her life. Are hus
bands always more important than
wives? Hughes is a fine poet in his
own right, and certainly is privately
entitled to whatever mourning proc
ess he needs to undergo. But it is pat
ently absurd to claim that whatever
effect his wife's death had on his
poetic development (and again,
Treital's point is not sound: Hughes'
original poetry and translations have
always been characterized by morbid
imagery and themes), is the end for
which Plath livedanddiedand is thus
"more interesting" than her own im
portance in the emerging canon of
good women poets.
The reviewer's conclusion is ter
ribly reductive of Plath as an influen
tial aesthetic figure, and reductive of
both Plath and Hughes' stature as
poets.

of Cabaret {Daily, April 12).
She is undoubtedly too young to
remember the ghastly events that
prompted th£ writing of this musical
but it tells it like it was. I saw the play
on Saturday evening and I was im
pressed. Since I am considerably
older than she I have experienced
things she is going to become aware
of and a production like this one will
be a part of her learning experience.
There are things going on in our
world that we would prefer not to
know about but sometimes it is im
portant to open one's eyes and take a
good hard look.
I know for a fact that the people in
volved in Cabaret worked for many
months to bring a gripping version to
Stanford. They also attended classes
and did the usual 36 hours of home
work each day. They set a mood that
all too realistically reminded us old
folks of the terror that was Nazi Ger
many. We need to be reminded of

that now and then because it can
happen again.
Aside from the dramatic message
we all got, I felt the acting and staging
were outstanding and brought home
the message to me that Stanford in
deed has again shown me what out
standing students it admits.

Rickie Lee Jones' legs
I am writing in response to Mike
Hale's review (Daily, April 12) of
Rickie Lee Jones' recent concert in
Berkeley. The fact is that it took all of
my will power to read through the
entire article because of a remark
made in the second paragraph. Ap
parently, Hale was distracted from
the music by the sight of "the backs
of Rickie Lee Jones' thighs. Too much
cellulite." The implication is that
women with fat thighs are offensive,
and should take care to hide them
selves.
Hale's remark hammers home the
fact that women are expected to live
up to some kind of ideal, to personify
a myth of "perfection." It is no won

der that we have a well-documented
paranoia about our weight and as a
result, a distorted body image.
I suppose that if Jones was thinner,
Hale would have had something fa
vorable to say about her body. But
why mention it at all? What compels
hirn to focus on this aspect of her per
son?

Lemmon's no Lemmon
I take note of Steven Vineberg's
minireview of "Missing" in the Dai
ly's Cinemascope because first, I am
glad to see that this superb movie is
still running and second, I am
astonished anew at Vineberg's lam
entable misunderstanding of the role
played by Jack Lemmon.
It is amazing that the film "Miss
ing" was released to play in this coun
try. The considerable embarrassment
and unease felt by State Department
officials apparently did not inhibit its
release to American audiences. Lem
mon's interpretation of Ed Horman
must be one of the most brilliant per

formances I have ever seen in mov
ies. Curious that Vineberg and other
critics of far more prestige and ex
perience than he seem unable to
grasp the significance of Ed Horman
in the film.
Lemmon's part as Charlie's father
was far more important than that of
the daughter-in-law, and Sissy
Spacek understood her excellent but
secondary role very well — she gave
beautiful support to Lemmon.
Lemmon played a man whose
character, understanding and opin
ions underwent a profound change,
a change pivotal to the stunning im
pact of this important and tragic film.
It seems clear to me that middle-class
and upper middle-class Americans
must blind themselves to what hap
pened in Chile in 1973 because it is
too dreadful for us really to look at. I
think the other actors in this ex
traordinary movie who commanded
my respect as fully as Lemmon were
those who played the bastards in
charge of the U.S. embassy in San
tiago.

Plath work inspirational
I find it incredible that Jonathan
Treitel concluded his otherwise in
teresting review of the journals of
Sylvia Plath (Daily, Apr. 29) by claim
ing that the most interesting part of
Plath's twofold legacy (already a re
ductive scheme) is Ted Hughes'
"symbolic suice" — which consists of
staging a poetic/dramatic ex
travaganza in Greece and then de
stroying his manuscript.
Not only is the relationship of this
and Crow to Plath's suicide an entire
ly hypothetical, speculative, un
substantiated and hence ir
responsible bit of psychologizing on
Treitel's part, but, more seriously, it
chooses to find this "symbolic sui
cide" more interesting than the in
creasing recognition of poetry writ
ten by women, including the popu
larization of Plath's own work, in
which she, and others, find constant
symbols of life and resurrection.
Treitel's assertion is a slap in tne
face. First, it claims that "symbolic
death" is more interesting than life,
symbolic or otherwise. Any serious
appraisal of Plath's poetic career and
life story needs to leave behind this

juvenile fascination with morbidity.
Second, the moral of the story
seems to be that Hughes'
widowhood is more important than
the careers of hundreds of women
who have been inspired by Plath's
work and moved by her life. Are hus
bands always more important than
wives? Hughes is a fine poet in his
own right, and certainly is privately
entitled to whatever mourning proc
ess he needs to undergo. But it is pat
ently absurd to claim that whatever
effect his wife's death had on his
poetic development (and again,
Treital's point is not sound: Hughes'
original poetry and translations have
always been characterized by morbid
imagery and themes), is the end for
which Plath livedanddiedand is thus
"more interesting" than her own im
portance in the emerging canon of
good women poets.
The reviewer's conclusion is ter
ribly reductive of Plath as an influen
tial aesthetic figure, and reductive of
both Plath and Hughes' stature as
poets.
