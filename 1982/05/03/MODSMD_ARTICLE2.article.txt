Brit sub torpedoes
Argentine warship
London — A British submarine torpedoed and is believed to have
"severely damaged" an Argentine warship just outside Britain's 200-
mile blockade zone around the Falkland islands at about 3 p.m. EDT yes
terday, the Defense Ministry announced here early this morning.
The Argentine cruiser, the General Belgrano, had "posed a significant
threat to the British task force" enforcing the blockade, a Defense Min
istry statement said, and was attacked by a submarine guarding the task
force perimeter. The Defense Ministry said the British submarine was
not damaged during the attack and has resumed patrolling.
In a communique issued at 10:20 p.m. EDT yesterday the Argentine
joint chiefs of staff said that "up until the present hour no war actions
have been recorded in the Falklands,"Washington Post correspondent
Jackson Diehl reported from Buenos Aires.. The statement, which was
mainly devoted fo reviewing Saturday's clashes, made no mention of
possible incidents outside of the island.
Officials at the joint chiefs' headquarters and at the Argentine navy
said they had received no report on an attack on the General Belgrano.
The General Belgrano, Argentina's only heavy warship, is a Brooklyn
class cruiser dating from World War II that Argentina purchased from
the United States. It has been outfitted with Seacat surface-to-air mis
siles and can also carry two helicopters.
Although the cruiser was just outside the declared blockade zone,
the British statement said it was liable to attack under the warning Brit
ain issued April 23 that "any approach by warships or aircraft which
could amount to a threat on British forces would encounter an ap
propriate response."
The ministry said the Argentine cruiser posed such a threat, and the
attack on it was "fully in accordance with instructions given to the task
force commander based on the right to self-defense under Article 51 of
the United Nations Charter."
The attack, about which the ministry said there now were no more
available details, was the only combat reported yesterday by either Brit
ain or Argentina after 20 hours of bombing raids, aerial dogfights and
naval bombardment in the South Atlantic conflict.
British government sources and military analysts said Saturday's at
tack had succeeded in cutting off Argentine forces on the islands from
resupply by air. They said the next step would be new military pressure
in the form of commando raids, landings by British forces, further aerial
attacks and naval bombardment, all designed to force Argentina to
withdraw its 5000 to 10,000 troops from the Falklands.
The British Defense Ministry said yesterday that Argentina
lost at least three warplanes and suffered heavy damage to
two airfields on the Falklands, while British forces escaped
without serious casualties. A ministry spokesman said Argen
tine anti-aircraft gunners around the Port Stanley airfield
may even have shot down one of their own supersonic
Mirage jet fighters. British journalists aboard the aircraft car
rier Hermes reported that four Argentine planes were shot
down.
The Argentine military command gave a much different
account, saying its forces had shot down at least five British
jets and probably destroyed six others, and had severely
damaged a British frigate, Diehl reported from Buenos Aires.
Other reports citing military sources also claimed that the
Argentines had badly damaged the Hermes, flagship of the
British naval task force.
Haig meets with British, follows
Peruvian peace initiative
Washington — The United States was involved in in
tensified diplomatic activity last night amid new military and
political developments in the Falkland Islands conflict.
Secretary of State Alexander Haig, according to a State De
partment spokesman, conferred by telephone with Peruvian
President Fernando Belaunde Terry about 7 p.m. EDT follow
ing the Peruvian's announcement in Lima of a peace in
itiative to stop the fighting.
Haig also was in touch with British Foreign Secretary Fran
cis Pym, who left Washington for New York late yesterday af
ter a four-hour meeting with the secretary of state and a 50-
minute session with Defense Secretary Caspar Weinberger.
Although "a number of ideas were exchanged" in the
wake of the Peruvian initiative, the State Department said,
"There has been no agreement on anything."
Spokesman joseph Reap confirmed that the United States
received a diplomatic note from Argentina as that nation re
acted to the latest developments in the deepening clash.
Reap declined to discuss the contents of the message, which
was reported in Buenos Aires to blame the United States for
"accelerating the confrontation with Great Britain."
The protest note, according to reports in the Argentine
capital, declared that the U.S. shift to support Britain "will
leave deep marks in Argentine-American relations."
Neither State Department nor Defense Department
spokesmen would comment on a British submarine's torpe
do attack on Argentina's only cruiser near the Falklands.
Pym, meeting reporters following his meeting with Haig
yesterday afternoon, denied that Argentina had inflicted any
damage on the British armada and said, "You can count on
the truth and validity of any communiques we may give you

from our Ministry of Defense."
It was Pym's first visit here since the talks almost two weeks
ago that led to formulation of a U.S. peace plan. Its subse
quent rejection by Argentina caused President Ronald Rea
gan to suspend U.S. mediation efforts and declare support
for Britain.
El Salvador president assumes office
San Salvador, El Salvador — Alvaro Magana, a 56-year-old
banker and political centrist, assumed the provisional presi
dency of El Salvador yesterday with a plea for unity and peace
in the face of an insurgency "fueled intensely from the out
side."
In an uncommon display of harmony, leadersof the outgo
ing government, the armed forces and the bitterly divided
political parties attended the inaugural ceremony to show
support for El Salvador's evolving political process.
"We have no room for resentment, for revenge, for hatred
or for sectarianism," Magana declared moments after he was
invested with the blue-and-white sash of office by Roberto
D'Aubuisson, president of the new constituent assembly.
"Only a true spirit of fraternity and solidarity on the part of
all Salvadorans will enable us to overcome the worst crisis in
our history," he said.
The transfer of power to Magana and three vice presidents
marked the end of a period of 30 months and 17 days of rule
by a civilian-military junta that governed by decree.
The junta, with slightly different membership at first,
seized power in a coup in October, 1979, and decreed a
number of political and social reforms in an effort to forestall
full-scale revolution. The civil strife that has nonetheless oc
curred has claimed at least 30,000 lives.
The reforms alienated powerful conservative business in
terests and landowners, who managed to recapture a meas
ure of power on March 28, when right-wing parties won 36 of
the 60 seats in the constituent assembly. D'Aubuisson
emerged as their spokesman.
Magana was elected provisional president last Thursday af
ter the assembly bowed to pressure from the United States
and the armed forces, who argued that a moderate leader
was necessary to ensure continued U.S. military support.
In his 20-minute inaugural address, Magana made no ref
erence to the political and social changes, such as land re
form, instituted by the outgoing junta headed by Jose
Napoleon Duarte, leader of the moderate Christian Demo
cratic Party.
Polish protest in May Day march
Warsaw, Poland — Chanting "down with the junta," tens
of thousands of Poles defied martial law Saturday by staging
an emotional May Day demonstration in support of the sus
pended Solidarity trade union. •

The Solidarity march coincided with an official parade ob
serving May Day that was headed by military and Communist
Party leaders. At one point the two processions passed within
several blocks of each other, separated only by a line of po
lice supported by watercannon.
Officially conceived as a show of support for the Com
munist authorities, this year's May Day celebrations in Po
land demonstrated that Solidarity is still a force to be
reckoned with. The unofficial march, which began almost
spontaneously following a mass in St. John's Cathedral in
Warsaw's old town, ended as the biggest display of public de
fiance to martial law yet seen here.
Estimates of the crowd varied between 20,000 and 50,000.
They dispersed peacefully after singing the national anthem
and religious songs such as "God, Return Us a Free Poland."
Parades in support of Solidarity also were reported in oth
er Polish cities including Gdansk, where the trade union
movement was born in August 1980.
The marches were the first large-scale, peaceful demon
strations of support for Solidarity since the military
crackdown Dec. 13 and could therefore have important psy
chological consequences for a nation that is gradually over
coming its sense of fear.
Israel drops plans for prohibition
of future settlement concessions
Jerusalem — Prime Minister Menachem Begin and his
Cabinet yesterday dropped plans tb put to a parliamentary
test a resolution that would prohibit the dismantling of Jew
ish civilian settlements in any future peace negotiations.
Faced with a bare majority, at best, for such a measure, the
Cabinet decided that if it could not demonstrate a broad na
tional consensus for the resolution, there would be no point
in bringing it before the parliament today, as planned.
Instead, a Cabinet spokesman said, Begin will emphasize
Israel's refusal to give up settlements in the occupied West
Bank and Gaza Strip when he makes a policy speech today to
mark the opening of the parliament's summer session.
The plan to gain a parliamentary stamp of approval on the
government's refusal to dismantle settlements in the future,
as it did when Israel withdrew from the Sinai Peninsula last
week, began to unravel when opposition Labor Party leader
Shimon Peres refused to support the measure. Begin's Likud
coalition has only a one-vote parliamentary majority.

Haig meets with British, follows
Peruvian peace initiative
Washington — The United States was involved in in
tensified diplomatic activity last night amid new military and
political developments in the Falkland Islands conflict.
Secretary of State Alexander Haig, according to a State De
partment spokesman, conferred by telephone with Peruvian
President Fernando Belaunde Terry about 7 p.m. EDT follow
ing the Peruvian's announcement in Lima of a peace in
itiative to stop the fighting.
Haig also was in touch with British Foreign Secretary Fran
cis Pym, who left Washington for New York late yesterday af
ter a four-hour meeting with the secretary of state and a 50-
minute session with Defense Secretary Caspar Weinberger.
Although "a number of ideas were exchanged" in the
wake of the Peruvian initiative, the State Department said,
"There has been no agreement on anything."
Spokesman joseph Reap confirmed that the United States
received a diplomatic note from Argentina as that nation re
acted to the latest developments in the deepening clash.
Reap declined to discuss the contents of the message, which
was reported in Buenos Aires to blame the United States for
"accelerating the confrontation with Great Britain."
The protest note, according to reports in the Argentine
capital, declared that the U.S. shift to support Britain "will
leave deep marks in Argentine-American relations."
Neither State Department nor Defense Department
spokesmen would comment on a British submarine's torpe
do attack on Argentina's only cruiser near the Falklands.
Pym, meeting reporters following his meeting with Haig
yesterday afternoon, denied that Argentina had inflicted any
damage on the British armada and said, "You can count on
the truth and validity of any communiques we may give you

from our Ministry of Defense."
It was Pym's first visit here since the talks almost two weeks
ago that led to formulation of a U.S. peace plan. Its subse
quent rejection by Argentina caused President Ronald Rea
gan to suspend U.S. mediation efforts and declare support
for Britain.
El Salvador president assumes office
San Salvador, El Salvador — Alvaro Magana, a 56-year-old
banker and political centrist, assumed the provisional presi
dency of El Salvador yesterday with a plea for unity and peace
in the face of an insurgency "fueled intensely from the out
side."
In an uncommon display of harmony, leadersof the outgo
ing government, the armed forces and the bitterly divided
political parties attended the inaugural ceremony to show
support for El Salvador's evolving political process.
"We have no room for resentment, for revenge, for hatred
or for sectarianism," Magana declared moments after he was
invested with the blue-and-white sash of office by Roberto
D'Aubuisson, president of the new constituent assembly.
"Only a true spirit of fraternity and solidarity on the part of
all Salvadorans will enable us to overcome the worst crisis in
our history," he said.
The transfer of power to Magana and three vice presidents
marked the end of a period of 30 months and 17 days of rule
by a civilian-military junta that governed by decree.
The junta, with slightly different membership at first,
seized power in a coup in October, 1979, and decreed a
number of political and social reforms in an effort to forestall
full-scale revolution. The civil strife that has nonetheless oc
curred has claimed at least 30,000 lives.
The reforms alienated powerful conservative business in
terests and landowners, who managed to recapture a meas
ure of power on March 28, when right-wing parties won 36 of
the 60 seats in the constituent assembly. D'Aubuisson
emerged as their spokesman.
Magana was elected provisional president last Thursday af
ter the assembly bowed to pressure from the United States
and the armed forces, who argued that a moderate leader
was necessary to ensure continued U.S. military support.
In his 20-minute inaugural address, Magana made no ref
erence to the political and social changes, such as land re
form, instituted by the outgoing junta headed by Jose
Napoleon Duarte, leader of the moderate Christian Demo
cratic Party.
Polish protest in May Day march
Warsaw, Poland — Chanting "down with the junta," tens
of thousands of Poles defied martial law Saturday by staging
an emotional May Day demonstration in support of the sus
pended Solidarity trade union. •

The Solidarity march coincided with an official parade ob
serving May Day that was headed by military and Communist
Party leaders. At one point the two processions passed within
several blocks of each other, separated only by a line of po
lice supported by watercannon.
Officially conceived as a show of support for the Com
munist authorities, this year's May Day celebrations in Po
land demonstrated that Solidarity is still a force to be
reckoned with. The unofficial march, which began almost
spontaneously following a mass in St. John's Cathedral in
Warsaw's old town, ended as the biggest display of public de
fiance to martial law yet seen here.
Estimates of the crowd varied between 20,000 and 50,000.
They dispersed peacefully after singing the national anthem
and religious songs such as "God, Return Us a Free Poland."
Parades in support of Solidarity also were reported in oth
er Polish cities including Gdansk, where the trade union
movement was born in August 1980.
The marches were the first large-scale, peaceful demon
strations of support for Solidarity since the military
crackdown Dec. 13 and could therefore have important psy
chological consequences for a nation that is gradually over
coming its sense of fear.
Israel drops plans for prohibition
of future settlement concessions
Jerusalem — Prime Minister Menachem Begin and his
Cabinet yesterday dropped plans tb put to a parliamentary
test a resolution that would prohibit the dismantling of Jew
ish civilian settlements in any future peace negotiations.
Faced with a bare majority, at best, for such a measure, the
Cabinet decided that if it could not demonstrate a broad na
tional consensus for the resolution, there would be no point
in bringing it before the parliament today, as planned.
Instead, a Cabinet spokesman said, Begin will emphasize
Israel's refusal to give up settlements in the occupied West
Bank and Gaza Strip when he makes a policy speech today to
mark the opening of the parliament's summer session.
The plan to gain a parliamentary stamp of approval on the
government's refusal to dismantle settlements in the future,
as it did when Israel withdrew from the Sinai Peninsula last
week, began to unravel when opposition Labor Party leader
Shimon Peres refused to support the measure. Begin's Likud
coalition has only a one-vote parliamentary majority.

Brit sub torpedoes
Argentine warship
London — A British submarine torpedoed and is believed to have
"severely damaged" an Argentine warship just outside Britain's 200-
mile blockade zone around the Falkland islands at about 3 p.m. EDT yes
terday, the Defense Ministry announced here early this morning.
The Argentine cruiser, the General Belgrano, had "posed a significant
threat to the British task force" enforcing the blockade, a Defense Min
istry statement said, and was attacked by a submarine guarding the task
force perimeter. The Defense Ministry said the British submarine was
not damaged during the attack and has resumed patrolling.
In a communique issued at 10:20 p.m. EDT yesterday the Argentine
joint chiefs of staff said that "up until the present hour no war actions
have been recorded in the Falklands,"Washington Post correspondent
Jackson Diehl reported from Buenos Aires.. The statement, which was
mainly devoted fo reviewing Saturday's clashes, made no mention of
possible incidents outside of the island.
Officials at the joint chiefs' headquarters and at the Argentine navy
said they had received no report on an attack on the General Belgrano.
The General Belgrano, Argentina's only heavy warship, is a Brooklyn
class cruiser dating from World War II that Argentina purchased from
the United States. It has been outfitted with Seacat surface-to-air mis
siles and can also carry two helicopters.
Although the cruiser was just outside the declared blockade zone,
the British statement said it was liable to attack under the warning Brit
ain issued April 23 that "any approach by warships or aircraft which
could amount to a threat on British forces would encounter an ap
propriate response."
The ministry said the Argentine cruiser posed such a threat, and the
attack on it was "fully in accordance with instructions given to the task
force commander based on the right to self-defense under Article 51 of
the United Nations Charter."
The attack, about which the ministry said there now were no more
available details, was the only combat reported yesterday by either Brit
ain or Argentina after 20 hours of bombing raids, aerial dogfights and
naval bombardment in the South Atlantic conflict.
British government sources and military analysts said Saturday's at
tack had succeeded in cutting off Argentine forces on the islands from
resupply by air. They said the next step would be new military pressure
in the form of commando raids, landings by British forces, further aerial
attacks and naval bombardment, all designed to force Argentina to
withdraw its 5000 to 10,000 troops from the Falklands.
The British Defense Ministry said yesterday that Argentina
lost at least three warplanes and suffered heavy damage to
two airfields on the Falklands, while British forces escaped
without serious casualties. A ministry spokesman said Argen
tine anti-aircraft gunners around the Port Stanley airfield
may even have shot down one of their own supersonic
Mirage jet fighters. British journalists aboard the aircraft car
rier Hermes reported that four Argentine planes were shot
down.
The Argentine military command gave a much different
account, saying its forces had shot down at least five British
jets and probably destroyed six others, and had severely
damaged a British frigate, Diehl reported from Buenos Aires.
Other reports citing military sources also claimed that the
Argentines had badly damaged the Hermes, flagship of the
British naval task force.

seized power in a coup in October, 1979, and decreed a
number of political and social reforms in an effort to forestall
full-scale revolution. The civil strife that has nonetheless oc
curred has claimed at least 30,000 lives.
The reforms alienated powerful conservative business in
terests and landowners, who managed to recapture a meas
ure of power on March 28, when right-wing parties won 36 of
the 60 seats in the constituent assembly. D'Aubuisson
emerged as their spokesman.
Magana was elected provisional president last Thursday af
ter the assembly bowed to pressure from the United States
and the armed forces, who argued that a moderate leader
was necessary to ensure continued U.S. military support.
In his 20-minute inaugural address, Magana made no ref
erence to the political and social changes, such as land re
form, instituted by the outgoing junta headed by Jose
Napoleon Duarte, leader of the moderate Christian Demo
cratic Party.
Polish protest in May Day march
Warsaw, Poland — Chanting "down with the junta," tens
of thousands of Poles defied martial law Saturday by staging
an emotional May Day demonstration in support of the sus
pended Solidarity trade union. •

The Solidarity march coincided with an official parade ob
serving May Day that was headed by military and Communist
Party leaders. At one point the two processions passed within
several blocks of each other, separated only by a line of po
lice supported by watercannon.
Officially conceived as a show of support for the Com
munist authorities, this year's May Day celebrations in Po
land demonstrated that Solidarity is still a force to be
reckoned with. The unofficial march, which began almost
spontaneously following a mass in St. John's Cathedral in
Warsaw's old town, ended as the biggest display of public de
fiance to martial law yet seen here.
Estimates of the crowd varied between 20,000 and 50,000.
They dispersed peacefully after singing the national anthem
and religious songs such as "God, Return Us a Free Poland."
Parades in support of Solidarity also were reported in oth
er Polish cities including Gdansk, where the trade union
movement was born in August 1980.
The marches were the first large-scale, peaceful demon
strations of support for Solidarity since the military
crackdown Dec. 13 and could therefore have important psy
chological consequences for a nation that is gradually over
coming its sense of fear.
Israel drops plans for prohibition
of future settlement concessions
Jerusalem — Prime Minister Menachem Begin and his
Cabinet yesterday dropped plans tb put to a parliamentary
test a resolution that would prohibit the dismantling of Jew
ish civilian settlements in any future peace negotiations.
Faced with a bare majority, at best, for such a measure, the
Cabinet decided that if it could not demonstrate a broad na
tional consensus for the resolution, there would be no point
in bringing it before the parliament today, as planned.
Instead, a Cabinet spokesman said, Begin will emphasize
Israel's refusal to give up settlements in the occupied West
Bank and Gaza Strip when he makes a policy speech today to
mark the opening of the parliament's summer session.
The plan to gain a parliamentary stamp of approval on the
government's refusal to dismantle settlements in the future,
as it did when Israel withdrew from the Sinai Peninsula last
week, began to unravel when opposition Labor Party leader
Shimon Peres refused to support the measure. Begin's Likud
coalition has only a one-vote parliamentary majority.
Today's weather
Fair and sunny today, with low clouds tonight. High tem
