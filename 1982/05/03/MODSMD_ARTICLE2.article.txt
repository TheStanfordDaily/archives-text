Brit sub torpedoes
Argentine warship
London — A British submarine torpedoed and is believed to have
"severely damaged" an Argentine warship just outside Britain's 200-
mile blockade zone around the Falkland islands at about 3 p.m. EDT yes
terday, the Defense Ministry announced here early this morning.
The Argentine cruiser, the General Belgrano, had "posed a significant
threat to the British task force" enforcing the blockade, a Defense Min
istry statement said, and was attacked by a submarine guarding the task
force perimeter. The Defense Ministry said the British submarine was
not damaged during the attack and has resumed patrolling.
In a communique issued at 10:20 p.m. EDT yesterday the Argentine
joint chiefs of staff said that "up until the present hour no war actions
have been recorded in the Falklands,"Washington Post correspondent
Jackson Diehl reported from Buenos Aires.. The statement, which was
mainly devoted fo reviewing Saturday's clashes, made no mention of
possible incidents outside of the island.
Officials at the joint chiefs' headquarters and at the Argentine navy
said they had received no report on an attack on the General Belgrano.
The General Belgrano, Argentina's only heavy warship, is a Brooklyn
class cruiser dating from World War II that Argentina purchased from
the United States. It has been outfitted with Seacat surface-to-air mis
siles and can also carry two helicopters.
Although the cruiser was just outside the declared blockade zone,
the British statement said it was liable to attack under the warning Brit
ain issued April 23 that "any approach by warships or aircraft which
could amount to a threat on British forces would encounter an ap
propriate response."
The ministry said the Argentine cruiser posed such a threat, and the
attack on it was "fully in accordance with instructions given to the task
force commander based on the right to self-defense under Article 51 of
the United Nations Charter."
The attack, about which the ministry said there now were no more
available details, was the only combat reported yesterday by either Brit
ain or Argentina after 20 hours of bombing raids, aerial dogfights and
naval bombardment in the South Atlantic conflict.
British government sources and military analysts said Saturday's at
tack had succeeded in cutting off Argentine forces on the islands from
resupply by air. They said the next step would be new military pressure
in the form of commando raids, landings by British forces, further aerial
attacks and naval bombardment, all designed to force Argentina to
withdraw its 5000 to 10,000 troops from the Falklands.
