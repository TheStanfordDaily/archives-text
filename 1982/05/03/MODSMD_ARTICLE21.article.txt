Jf Â«r. Stanford completed its six
me sweep of the Trojans this
pr, beating USC 9-3, 12-5,
id 6-5 at Sunken Diamond
Is weekend.
f'This is the first time I've ever
en a Stanford team take six
>m USC," Stanford coach
afk Marquess commented
[er the game. "These were
ally big wins."
Although the Trojans are in
e 6-Pac cellar, Marquess was
>t underestimating the im
>rtance of this weekend's

series. With its three wins over
the weekend, the magic
number for the playoffs is now
three. Any combination of
three Stanford wins or Arizona
losses will assure Stanford of a
second place finish in the
Southern Division of the Pac-10
and a playoff spot.
Stanford boosted its con
ference record to 17-10 and
holds a two game lead over
third place Arizona (13-10). Be
cause Stanford took four-of-six
from Arizona earlier this year,
it would go to the playoffs in
the case of a tie. The Cardinal
has three conference games
remaining, all with California.

Yesterday's game with USC
was the closest of the series.
The Cardinal banged out eight
hits and six runs, but com
mitted three errors en route to
a 6-5 victory.
Brian Myers did not have
one of his better days but
pitched well enough to pick up
his sixth victory against two de
feats. He scattered 11 hits and
lasted 8 2 A innings. Jeff Ballard
came in to get the save.
At the game's outset, Myers
seemed to be throwing the ball
a little high and USC had no
trouble getting hits. Trojan left
fielder Gary Snell led off the
game with a sharp single to
center. After moving to second
on a sacrifice bunt, center
fielder John Wallace moved
him to third with a bloop single
to right. Second baseman Bob
Batesole then followed with a
sacrifice fly to left field, scoring
Snell, and giving the Trojans a
1-0 lead.
Stanford came back to score
two runs in the bottom of the
second. After Cardinal catcher

Bob Hausladen walked and
second baseman Steve Bue
chele followed with a single,
pinch hitter Eric Hardgrave
moved them to second and
third with a sacrifice bunt.
Hausladen then scored on a
ground ball by first baseman
Mike Aldrete. Center fielder
Darryl Stephens followed with
a single to left scoring Bue
chele.
The Cardinal widened its
lead to 3-1 in the fourth inning
when Hardgrave scored on a
single by shortstop Bob De-
Costa.
USC tied the game in the
fifth inning when Trojan third
baseman Craig Stevenson hit a
towering two-run homer to
deep left-center following an
infield single by Snell.
In the sixth inning, USC
added another run to takea4-3
lead.
Stanford came back to score
three runs in the seventh in
ning.
