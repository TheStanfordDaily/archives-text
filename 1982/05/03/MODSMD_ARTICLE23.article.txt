# USC, UCLA rip Card
## 
### Sally Jenkins 
No. 1 ranked UCLA and No. 4 ranked USC
soundly defeated the Cardinal men's tennis
team 7-2 and 5-4 respectively at home this
weekend, and in doing so considerably nar
rowed Stanford's chances for an NCAA tour
nament berth.
The Cardinal came closer than the scores
sound, but in the end couldn't overcome a
case of fatalism. There was desperation in the
air as the workmanlike Bruins swept five of six
singles matches Friday, and the Trojan squad
took Nos. 2, 3, 5 and 6 singles and No. 3
doubles at the varsity courts in the first half of
Saturday's indoor-outdoor match.
Card ace Scott Davis, fresh off a solid vic
tory over Bruin Marcel Freeman at the Pacif
ic-10 Individual Championships two weeks
ago, found himself in the dead zone Friday.
Freeman annihilated him in only two sets, 0-6,
3-6. Stanford's only victories came at No. 4
singles, where John Corse defeated Dan Saltz
7-6 (8-6), 6-3, and at No. 1 doubles where
Davis and Jeff Arons defeated Freeman and
Robbie Venter 6-4, 6-3.
The Trojans came into Stanford on a down
swing after a 5-4 loss to UC-Berkeley Friday.
But the strengths of the Cardinal lineup —
No. 1 singlesand Nos. 1 and 2doubles — were

left all dressed up and with no chance of win
ning in Maples Pavilion that evening. The Tro
jans won an easy two-set victory at No. 3
doubles Saturday afternoon as Jim Agate and
Rich Bengston defeated Mark McKeen and
Jim Miller 6-4, 6-3 to make their score on the
afternoon 5-1.
Stanford swept all three matches with a
vengeance Saturday night to make it the
score as close as it was. Davis, still seething
over his loss to Freeman, destroyed Matt An
ger 6-1,6-3, losing only eight points in the first
set. Scott Bondurant and Corse defeated
Tony Emerson and Todd Whitskein at No. 2
doubles 6-4, 7-6, 7-2, and Davis and Arons
cruised past Roger Knapp and Sean Brawley
at the first doubles spot 6-2,6-2.
Only Corse turned in winning singles per
formances on both days. His effort against
Trojan Knappat No. 4 was awe-inspiring as he
fought back from a toial of 10 match points
in the second set to finally win the three-set
match 6-7 (5-7), 7-6 (8-6), 6-2 amid whoops,
hollers and standing ovations. Down 2-6 in
the second set tiebreaker, Corse fought off
four straight match points with near perfect
tennis, even bringing Knapp to his knees with
an overhead at 6-6.
