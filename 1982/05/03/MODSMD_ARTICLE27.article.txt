## Student arrested 
### 
Stanford junior Karl Miller was ar
rested early Friday morning on suspi
cion of possessing stolen property
and possessing suspected drugs, ac
cording to Stanford Police Chief
Marvin Herrington.
Herrington said Miller was
stopped at 3 a.m. Friday because his
license plates were out of date. Video
equipment allegedly taken from an
athletics department storage build
ing near the varsity tennis courts was
found in Miller's vehicle, police said.
Miller was booked at North Coun
ty jail and released on his own recog
nizance.
Miller, who is a member of the ten
nis team, told the Daily last night that
while evidence seems to indicate that
he broke the law, he can explain the
possession of the property and hopes
that the charges will be dropped.
He said he had been walking
around near the tennis courts early
Friday morning and stumbled onto
valuable equipment that was half in
and half out of the storage shed. He
said that because it was so late and he
had a mid-term the next day, he took
the equipment and put it Into his car,
intending to inform athletic depart
ment officials in the morning.
"I really thought I was doing the
right thing," Miller said.
Miller said he often takes walks
near the tennis court late at night.
The date for Miller's arraignment
has been set for May 13.
