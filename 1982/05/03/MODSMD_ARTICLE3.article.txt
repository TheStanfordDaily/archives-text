## 
### Geoff Dryvynsyde 
A panel discussing women in
sports agreed last Thursday that while
women athletes at Stanford are
treated well, questions remain about
the future of women's collegiate ath
letics.
The discussion, entitled "Women
In Sports: Who Cares?," was the third
in a series on sports called "Heroes or
Victims" which is being sponsored by
Rinconada and Otero.
The University was praised for its
women's athletic programs by all the
panelists. Women's basketball coach
Dottie McCrea told an audience of
about 50 students, "In no way does
Stanford lack in anything they give
their women athletes."
Stanford has had 70 Fulbright
scholarships for women athletes,
which Women's Sports Magazine
editor Amy Rennert said is more than
any other college in the United
states.
Donna Garton of the Stanford
Cardinal Club said the club has raised
more money than any other club in
the country." An auction in the fall
raised $200,000 for women athletes
here.
The panelists agreed that while
women athletes have made great
progress, they need to stop and see

where they are going.
"We are not shouting 'let us in' be
cause we have got in," said Rennert.
There are now more women
playing organized vollyball and
swimming than men, according to
Rennert, who also said that two
women have been elected to the In
ternational Olympic committee. She
detailed how the Olympics were de
fined 87 years ago as "male athlet
icism and female applause."
McCrea told of her fight to be ac
cepted as a woman athlete. "I was
better than any of the boys, but I was
the mascot," she said. Now, she said,
"fathers put up backboards on the
garage for their daughters."
Rachael Smith, assistant field hock
ey coach here, said that women do
not want exactly the same thing that
men want out of sports. McCrea
agreed, saying, "Where we go will
depend on values: as women we
have a few different ones. It depends
if we want to continue or make it bet
ter."
During the question period follow
ing the speeches, McCrea made this
observation on the business-like na
ture of college sport: "Football pays
my bills: I'm a great football fan."
