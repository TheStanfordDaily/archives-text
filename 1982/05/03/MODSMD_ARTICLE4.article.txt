# Drop in fee refunds reported
##

While fewer students claimed fee assessment refunds
this quarter than last, some student organizations were
still hard-hit in the quarterly rebate rush.
Only about 22 percent of the student body claimed
their rebates last week, compared to more than 40 per
cent last quarter. This can be attributed to there being
only half as many groups levying fees this quarter, ac
cording to ASSU Council of Presidents member Chris
Greene. This winter, a record 20 fee assessments on the
list prompted many students to ask for all or part of their
rebates.
1 he hardest hit student group was the Academic Or
ganizations Board (AOB), which lost $2700. "This will just
thin out the funds going to the various pre-professional
groups that make up our organization," said Brian
Mariscal, adviser to and former head of the AOB.
Though Mariscal said that the assessments account for
100 percent of their budget, he said he didn't foresee any
immediate cancellation of projects because of this
spring's rebates.
The Guest Professorship Board was more directly af
fected. That organization lost about $2600 this quarter,
and Director Luke Cole said that it could have an effect
on next year's programs, because they hadn't expected
to lose quite that much. Combined with last quarter, the
board lost a total of $7500.
Cole said that people claimed their rebates be
cause the board hasn't brought in a "big name" this year.
"Last year we had John Anderson, but people haven't

heard about us this year, so they're taking their money
back," he said.
The Guest Professorship Board has only their fee
assessment to pay for the salaries, travel and housing ex
penses of visiting scholars. Cole said this about the large
volume of rebates claimed: "People don't realize when
they're taking back their $1 how much time and effort
goes into these programs that are funded completely by
their small contributions."
The Campus Entertainment Board (CEB) has been
holding fund raisers to make up for their rebate losses
and for the fact that they won't have a fee assessment
next year. According to Todd Ackerman, group leader,
the CEB won't have any specific projects cut out this
spring, because most of their activities take place in the
fall and winter, when less is happening on campus. "Next
year's activities may be slightly affected, but we're going
to be promoting concerts to make up the difference."
Club Sports receives $30,000 from the University Gen
eral Fund, but fee assessments make up the other half of
their budget. Rickie Sobel, the president of Club Sports,
said that the loss of $2400 this quarter will just stretch a
budget already thinned by inflation a little more.
"All the sports will lose," said Sobel, "we'll just have to
divide up the pie into smaller pieces."
ASSU Legal Counseling had the smallest amount of
fees taken back, with only 9 percent of the student body
forfeiting its right to use the service. Still, according to
office manager Bonnie Senko, losing the 9 percent hurt.
