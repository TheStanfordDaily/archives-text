# Air-conditioning unit taken off Meyer's roof
## 
### Ruth Harlow 
A dramatic lifting effort ordered by
the office of Operations and Main
tenance succeeded Friday in remov
ing a large piece of abandoned
equipment from the Meyer Library
roof. With this equipment out of the
way, extensive roof repairs will begin
in an attempt to solve the library's
leaking problem.
A massive 40,000-pound crane with
a 150-foot boom picked up an old
• cooling tower, approximately 20 feet
high by 40 feet wide, and placed it on
a truck to be hauled away, cul
minating a tricky three-day-long
project.
The cooling tower was part of
Meyer's original heating, ventilating
and air conditioning system. Several
years ago the University installed a
new heating and cooling system,
robbing the old tower of its function
but leaving it standing on the roof.
This year Operations and Main
tenance discovered leaks beneath
the tower, necessitating its removal
before effective roof repairs could
begin.
The tower not only blocked roof
repairs but also contributed to roof
damage because it had become the
roosting place for dozens of pigeons.
Al Genevero, facility engineer at Op
erations and Maintenance, estimated
that the birds had made a mess "a
couple of feet high" on the roof
around the tower.
He explained that the acid in their
droppings gradually eats away at the
roofing, eventually allowing water to
seep through.
Removing the cooling tower cost
approximately $6000. Asked about
the cost for all the planned roof re
pairs, Genevero said, "We'll be
spending about $50,000 altogether

on this project."
This week workers will begin to
waterproof the roof's 17-foot-high
exterior walls, a total surface of 10,000
square feet. These walls make a one
story addition on top of Meyer
feasible. Extensive re-roofing will be
gin sometime after spring quarter.
This part of the project accounts for
the largest share of the repair costs,
approximately $30,000.
Leaks have plagued Meyer for the
past three years. Because water
comes in only around the perimeters
and in manageable amounts, there
has not been damage to books. In
assessing the need tor repairs,
spokesmen for Operations and
Maintenance stressed protecting the
building itself.
"We place a certain value on each
of our buildings," Genevero said.
"We have to keep the water out. It's
the most destructive thing."
Ben Asaro, project manager of fa
cilities project management, similar
ly described the water problem as a
threat to the worth and lifespan of all
University bL'dings. He said, "Last
year the leaking problem was brutal
to a lot of our buildings. Meyer Li
brary has taken a lot of punishment."
The removal operation, while a
postitive step in Operation and
Maintenance's ongoing effort to
make Meyer watertight, produced a
couple of negative side effects —
homeless baby pigeons and a gaping
hole in the pavement in front of
Meyer.
Because of the crane's great weight
and because of a previously un
known water leak below ground,
planks supporting the crane at one
point sunk several feet through the
paved path.
