# Industry-prof connection blasted

Research universities and American industry are
starting to act like one "party," and this relationship
can have a corruptive influence on academic re
search, according to Al Meyerhof, a representative of
the Natural Resources Defense Council.
"First the companies provide grant money, then
they hire a professor as a consultant, then they in
crease the consultant's salary." Meyerhof said the end
result is that some professors point their research in
directions that will benefit the company.
He warned that people other than just corporate
and university presidents should decide what direc
tion scientific research will take.
Meyerhof spoke on a Thursday afternoon panel
titled "Science For Sale: Private Control of a Public
Resource," the third in a five-part symposium entitled
"Universities, Industries, and Graduate Education."
He cited the recent conference at Pajaro Dunes,
which was attended by the presidents of Stanford,
Harvard, MIT, CalTech and the University of Califor
nia, along with the presidents of 11 of the largest high
technology corportations in America, and which re
stricted entry to the press, as an example of how uni
versities and industry are acting like one "party."
Some professors may even endanger society if it
means maintaining a financial connection, Meyerhof
claimed. He spoke about Charles Hine, a professor at
UC-San Francisco, who did a study of pesticides at the
same time that he was working for Shell, which was
planning to market the pesticide that Hine was study
ing. Hine found that it had a carcinogenic effect on
animals, yet he did not disclose this information. Shell
went on to market the product, consequently causing
harm to some workers who were exposed to it.
Meyerhof said this type of situation points to the
need for full disclosure of a professor's outside finan

cial interests, so that he cannot direct his university
related work to his company work. He pointed out
that research funded by public funds, such as in the
form of grants from the National Associaton of Sci
ence, should also be monitored so that there can be
no similarities in the professor's public and private
work.
David Noble, an historian at MIT, was the other
speaker on the panel. He agreed that the industry
university relationship is not in the best interest of so
ciety. "What is good for the scientists, is good for busi
ness, is good for the country, rings hollow today," he
said.
Noble called industry's involvement with science
"the selling of the tree of knowledge to Wall Street."
According to him, this relationship will lead to the
university's adoption of the industrial sector's ideas of
profit maximization, and thereby will give rise to a
conflict of interests in the university.
He said one of the reasons for this relationship is the
small role that government plays. According to
Noble, since World War 11, at which time federal sup
port of science was very high, the government has
been increasingly less visible in terms of financial and
administrative aid. This has opened the door to in
dustry.
Noble thinks now it would be very difficult for the
government to regain a significant role because of the
"exaggerated response" which people have to it.
"There's a public outcry against any murmur of gov
ernment interference in science, but an absence of
concern in the case of private control," he said.
Noble is optimistic, though, that there are people
trying to make the public aware of this situation, help
ing them to see that they should not entrust society's
resources to "private and privileged hands.
"The battle over science is just beginning," he said.
