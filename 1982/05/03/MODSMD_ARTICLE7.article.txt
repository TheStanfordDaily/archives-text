The Chapparal, the campus humor

for concert production" by the Com
mittee on Contemporary Entertain
ment (COCE), according to Vicky
Holt, director of University Events
and Services.
Although it has been reported in
the Daily and elsewhere that the
Chapparal was trying to bring the
Grateful Dead here, both Holt and
Thorn Massey, associate dean of stu
dent affairs and chairman of the
COCE, refused to either confirm or
deny this.
Chapparal staffers were un
available for comment.
Holt also said that "Elton John is
definitely not coming here" when
aksed whether the Band, which has
also been given preliminary approval
to hold a concert here, had indeed
obtained the pop singer's services.
Band manager John Howard con
firmed that negotiations with John
had ended because of a scheduling
conflict. "We're negotiating for a
new concert but we're not sure who
were going to get," he said.
Howard complained that publicity
about the possiblity of a John concert
was damaging to contract nego
tiations.
