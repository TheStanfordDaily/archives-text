## Amsterdam: old city with new problems 
### Los Angeles Times 
Amsterdam â€” What used to be one of
the world's most beautiful cities is in trou
ble.
Amsterdam's tree-shaded streets and
picturesque canals are littered with trash.
Historic, centuries-old buildings are cov
ered with graffiti.
But worse, drug-related crime has
reached a level that has demoralized po
lice officers and terrified the Dutch peo
ple.
"We have become the drug capital of
the world," cab driver Geoff Miller said
the other day.
"I wouldn't say that," Reinder
Hoornstra, a police department spokes
man, said, "but we have certanly become
one of the drug capitals of the world."
Police Chief Jaap Valken called the drug
problem "enormous."
"In Amsterdam we have 3000 registered
heroin addicts," he said, "but in reality
there are 10,000."
Amsterdam's population is about
710,000.

Last year, according to police statistics,
there were 34 known heroin deaths in Am
sterdam. Valken complained in a recent
roundtable discussion with other law en
forcement officers that his department was
overworked and ensnarled in red tape.
"The citizen feels threatened and un
safe," he said, "and the police themselves
do not feel safe."
But drugs and crime are only the tip of
the iceberg. Amsterdam has other prob
lems. The 700-year-old city, long noted for
its cleanliness and devotion to urban beau
tification, is littered with trash these days,
and graffiti covers many of its landmark
buildings. Some of the city's most famous
buildings, among them the Rijksmuseum,
which houses many of the major works of
Holland's most famous artist, Rembrandt
van Rijn, have been scarred in this way.
The city is plagued by a massive traffic
problem, which is compounded by the
canal system and a determination to main
tain the historic character of the city center
by limiting efforts to modernize the road
system. Bicycles are still a major form of

transportation.
The state of the economy has con
tributed to the overall problem. Industry
has been moving out, resulting in the loss
of about 5000 jobs a year over the past 10
years. About 10 percent of the population
is unemployed.
In recent years there has been a massive
influx of foreigners from former Dutch
lands abroad, especially from South Amer
ica and the Far East, and this is helping to
change the character of the city. Amster
dam now has more than 100,000 foreigners
from 125 countries.
Although long reputed to be an interna
tionally minded city that served as a haven
for oppressed foreigners, Amsterdam has
become concerned over the growing
number of foreigners. This concern is re
flected in a widely quoted remark by
Mayor Wim Polak: "I never imagined
being the mayor of 14,000 Turks and 12,000
Moroccans."
City officials said there is no serious re
sentment of the foreigners, as there is in
neighboring West Germany.
