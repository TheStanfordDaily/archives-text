# Beating the odds:
## Make health a habit 
### Doryn Davis Dr.P. H Harvey Weinstein, M. D 
Life is a risky business. It is
almost impossible to miss the
newspaper articles or the
reports on the 7 o'clock news
that relate something enjoyable
to some frightening disease.
Suddenly it seems that
anything we do is a gamble.
The relationship between
the way we live and our health
has become a widely accepted
principle. Its increasing
prominence has to do with
changing patterns of what
causes illness and death. Early
in this century, the plethora of
infectious diseases claimed
people's lives in great
numbers. With the advent of
improved sanitation and the
discovery of antibiotics,
infectious diseases were
replaced by chronic maladies
as the stuff to snuff us out. We
find ourselves in the
historically unprecedented
situation of being able to live
long enough to develop
diseases related to lifestyle.
And lifestyles have changed.
Foods became more highly
processed and people became
more sedentary. As we became
accustomed to "labor-saving"
appliances and conveniences,
exercise was often transformed
into the pressing of buttons and
the flicking of switches.
America's love of the
automobile led to an aversion
to walking. With more leisure
and increased affluence, we
became gourmet cooks,
addicted to rich foods and
sauces. Awash in alcohol,
cigarettes, and
self-satisfaction, our waistlines
grew and so did the prevalence
of cardiovascular disease,
cancer, and alcoholism.
So one's lifestyle is
important. It is both what we
do — exercise, eat well, drink
moderately, deal with stress —
and don't do — smoke, bake in
the sun, overeat — that is
consequential.
To complicate the issue still
further, a chosen lifestyle
interacts with one's genetic
makeup and environmental
factors. The same amount of
salt injested by different people
will have different
consequences for each person's
blood pressure. Also,
advertising agencies, media,
and industries such as the
production of alcohol or
tobacco limit how freely we
can make choices — often .
because of lack of information
or one-sided information. Our
choices are restricted.
Environmental factors
become even more
immediately powerful in a
university setting. Positiveand
negative pressures are exerted
on each student to behave in a
certain way. Pressure to be
physically active or not to
smoke can be benevolent,
while the pressure to drink
alcohol can have dire
consequences. For each
individual, thequestion is how
to decide what risks are worth
taking and which ones are
worth reducing. It becomes a
matter of choice, the difficulty
of this choice notwithstanding.
Most people act as if they
will be forever invulnerable.
This limits one's perceptions.

When we think of the future,
we think of tomorrow or next
week (or maybe, in a pinch, of
next quarter). Aging is not a
concern when you're in your
early 20s. Yet, as students lay
down the knowledge and
acquire the skills that must last
the next 40 or 50 years, it is
shortsighted to ignore the
knowledge and choices that
can help us stay around long
enough {p enjoy the fruits of
our labors.
Many people feel the
equation isn't balanced.
Delaying one's gratification
now for a nebulous effect
doesn't seem entirely
equitable. But changes made
now often have perceivable
positive effects now, as well as
40 years from now. Those who
have stopped smoking report
improved endurance during
physical activity. Regular
exercisers report more energy,
an improved ability to cope
with stress, and reduction in

insomnia. In the same way,
maintaining ideal weight has
positive effects on self-esteem.
The hallmark of the college
years is increasing the ability to
make active decisions about
one's life. Not only do those
decisions include career and
relationship choices, but they
also include decisions about
how you're going to lead your
life.
The decision to make
healthful choices can be as
conscious and deliberate as
deciding what field to enter.
Our invitation is to use this
time to decide what risks are
worth taking and which are
worth reducing. The crucial
factor is that one's actions
should be based on active
decisions and not merely the
result of habit or conformity.
