fruit and vegetable intake).

3) If you are a female taking estrogen or birth control pills, add I point if score is 12 or below, 2 points if risk
score is 13 or above (especially if you smoke, are overweight, have high blood pressure or high blood cholesterol).
Interpretation
Maximum points = 24
Zone Score
F 21-24 The probability of having a premature heart
attack or stroke is about four to five times the
U.S. average. Action is urgent. Try to drop four
points within a month and three more points
within six months.
E 17-20 Incidence of heart attack or stroke is about
twice the U.S. average. Action is urgent. Try to
drop four points within six months and con
tinue reduction.
D 13-16 The U.S. average is 14. This is an uncomfortable
and readily avoidable zone. Careful planning
can result in a five- to six-point reduction
within a year.
C 9-12 The likelihood of having a heart attack or
stroke is about one-half the U.S. average. This is
a zone rather easily achieved by most people
within a year if they are now in Zone D or E.
Careful planning can result in a four- to six
point reduction within a year.
B 5-8 Incidence of heart attack or stroke about one
quarter of the U.S. average. This goal is achiev
able by many but often takes one or two years
to reach.
A 0-4 Incidence of heart attack or stroke rates very
low, averaging less than one-tenth die rate in
the U.S. 35-65 age group. This goal requires
diligent effort, considerable family support, and
often takes three to four years to reach. Indi
