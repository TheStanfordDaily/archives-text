BLEEDING: Active and
vigorous bleeding can
almost always be controlled
by the application of
pressure directly on the
wound.
BOILS: A boil is a localized
infection caused by the
staphylococcus germ. When
this particular germ
inhabits a person's skin,
recurrent problems may
persist for months or even
years. Boils may be single
or multiple and can occur
anywhere on the body.
Warm soaks should be
applied several times a day
to help bring the boil "to a
head." The boil should
rupture and drain by
itself—don't squeeze! If the
boil occurs on the face, if
"blood poisoning"
(streaking) occurs, or if
fever is present, see a
doctor.
EAR WAX:Ear wax is the
natural cleansing agent for
the outer passages of the
ear. Wax should not be
removed by any object,
including cotton swabs. If
vou feel as if vour ear is
"plugged." vou can try
removing the wax with
hydrogen peroxide, or come
in to Cowell let have it
checked.
PUNCTURE WOUNDS:
Puncture wounds are
caused by nails, pins, and
other sharp objects. Let the
wound bleed as much as
possible to help carrv any
foreign material to the

outside. The wound should
be washed thoroughly with
soap and warm water.
Hydrogen peroxide can also
be used to cleanse the
wound. Keep it clean and
check for signs of infection
for four or five days after
the injury. If you haven't
had a tetanus booster
within the past 10 years,
you will need another
booster.
SEBORRHEIC DERMATITIS:
This is a long term for a
skin disease that might be
compared to dandruff of the
skin other than the scalp.
(The medical term for scalp
dandruff is seborrhea.)
Over-the-counter shampoos
such as Selsun Blue are
often effective.
SUNBURN: Exposure to the
sun accelerates the aging
process and increases the
chances for skin cancer.
Sunscreen agents help
prevent buring while still
permitting some tanning to
occur. Anything containing
the chemical "PABA"
blocks out virtually all rays.
Suntan lotions which do not
contain sunscreen agents
block relatively little solar
radiation.
WARTS: Warts can be
surgically removed, frozen,
or burned off. but they will
also often go away by
themselves if left untreated.
Warts are caused by a
virus and are a response to
a minor local viral infection.
If you get one wart, vou are
likely to get more.

Chemicals are available
over-the-counter for the
treatment of warts, and,
with persistence on your
part, they are often
effective. Cowell doesn't
ordinarily treat warts.
WATER: The body requires
at least four eight-ounce
glasses of water (or its
equivalent in other
beverages) each day. Water
is essential for maintaining
stable body temperature,
cleaning impurities from the
body, and maintaining blood
circulation and life. A twist
of lemon or lime can help
make water a more
attractive beverage.
VITAMINS: Americans are
said to have the most
expensive urine in the
world. Its added value
comes from unneeded.
water-soluble vitamins (C
and Bs) which are excreted
unmetabolized in the urine
and cannot aid the body. In
addition, fat-soluble
vitamins such as A and D
can build up in the body
and be potentially harmful
in large amounts.
Vitamins—chemically kno
wn as coenzymes—are
essential to normal body
functioning in minute
amounts. A well-balanced
diet automatically provides
the required quantity of
vitamins. Unless a physician
documents a vitamin
deficiency and recommends
a supplement, use of
vitamins is entirely optional.
