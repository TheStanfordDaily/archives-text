# Six death-defying acts
## 
### 
Eat sensibly. Overweight
individuals are at greater risk
for diabetes, gall bladder
disease, and high blood
pressure. So it makes good
sense to maintain proper
weight. But good eating habits
also mean holding down the
amount of fat (especially
saturated fat), cholesterol,
sugar and salt in your diet. If
you must snack, try nibbling on
fresh fruits and vegetables.
You'll feel better — and look
better, too.
Excrcise regularly. Almost
everyone can benefit from
exercise — and there's some
form of exercise almost
everyone can do. (If you have
any doubt, check first with
your doctor.) Usually, as little
as 15-30 minutes of vigorous
exercise three times a week
will help you have a healthier
heart, eliminate excess weight,
tone up sagging muscles, and
sleep better. Think how much
difference all these
improvements could make in
the way you feel!
Learn to handle stress. Stress
is a normal part of living;
everyone faces it to some
degree. The causes of stress can
be good or bad. desirable or
undesirable (such as a
promotion on the job or the loss
of a spouse). Properly handled,
stress need not be a problem.
But unhealthy responses to
stress — such as driving too
fast or erratically, drinking too
much, or prolonged anger or
grief — can cause a variety ot
physical and mental problems.
Even on a very busy day, find a
few minutes to slow down and
relax. Talking over a problem
with someone you trust can
often help you find a
satisfactory solution. Learn to
distinguish between things
that are "worth fighting about"
and things that are less
important.
Be safety conscious. Think
"safety first" at home, at work.

at school, at play, and on the
highway. Buckle seat belts and
obey traffic rules. Keep poisons
and weapons out of the reach of
children, and keep emergency
numbers by your telephone.
When the unexpected
happens, you'll be prepared.
Avoid cigarettes. Cigarette
smoking is the single most
important preventable cause of
illness and early death. It is
especially risky for pregnant
women and their unborn
babies. Persons who stop
smoking reduce their risk of
getting heart disease and
cancer. So if you're a cigarette
smoker, think twice about
lighting that next cigarette. If
you choose to continue
smoking, try decreasing the
number of cigarettes you
smoke and switching to a low
tar and nicotine brand.
Follow sensible drinking
habits. Alcohol produces
changes in mood and behavior.
Most peoplewhodrinkareable
to control their intake of
alcohol and to avoid
undesired, and often harmful,
effects. Heavy, regular use of
alcohol can lead to cirrhosis of
the liver, a leading cause of
death. Also, statistics clearly
show that mixing drinking and
driving is often the cause of
fatal or crippling accidents.
Use care in taking drugs.
Today's greater use of drugs —
both legal and illegal — is one
of our most serious health
risks. Even some drugs
prescribed by your doctor can
be dangerous if taken when
drinking alcohol or before
driving. Excessive or
continued use of tranquilizers
(or "pep pills") can cause
physical and mental problems.
Using or experimenting with
illicit drugs such as marijuana,
heroin, cocaine, and PCP may
lead to a number of damaging
effects or even death.
