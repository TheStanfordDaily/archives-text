Cancer related
checkups:
Women:
Breast — see adjacent arti
cle
Cervix — Current recom
mendations by the Ameri
can Cancer Society (ACS)
are for two initial Pap tests 1
year apart. If these are nor
mal. at least every three years
subsequently. Those with
early age at Ist intercourse,
herpes or multiple sex
partners are at higher risk.-
These recommendations are
controversial; the American
College of Obstetrics and
Gynecology still feels that
annual Pap tests are indi
cated.
DES — women whose
mothers took DES (diethyl
stilbesterol) while they were
in utcro have an increased
susceptability toan unusual
type of vaginal cancer.
Opinions differ as to how
these women should be

monitored — they probably
should at least be seen an
nually by a gynecologist.
Men:
Testicular cancer — Cur
rent recommendations of
the ACS are for men to do
regular self-examination to
check for lumps or nodules.
Either Sex:
Thyroid — students who
have had radiation therapy to
the head and neck (not diag
nostic x-rays) may be at in
creased risk of thyroid
cancer. If you have such a
history, confer with a doc
tor.
Skin — There are several
different kinds of skin
cancer. Pair-skinned indi
viduals are at higher risk.
Most common in this age
group is: Melanoma — a
maligant mole. Any mole
which gets darker or starts
spreading into surrounding
tissue is suspect. Increased
sun time increases risk of
skin cancer.
