# The 						breast self-exam
## 
### Diane Pagani, R. N 
The breasts are the foremost
site of cancer deaths in women,
and one in 11 women will
develop breast cancer.
Although the statistics are
frightening, the situation is far
from hopeless. If the cancer is
discovered in its early,
localized stage before it has
spread beyond the breast, most
breast cancer patients will
survive and live normal,
productive lives. Almost 85
percent of all women who
discover breast cancer early
and are treated promptly
recover.
Ninety-five percent of breast
cancer is discovered by the
women themselves. Breast
self-exams should be done
once a month, at the end of the
menstrual period. This is the
time when the cyclical
hormonal stimulation of the
breast has subsided. When the
breast self-exam is done
regularly, you will know what
your breasts feel like and thus
will be better able to detect

change. The monthly
self-exam should be
supplemented by an annual
check-up with a physician.
If you detect a lump during a
self-exam, call for an
appointment with your doctor
immediately. You should keep
in mind the fact that 80 percent
of all lumps discovered in the
breasts are benign.
It is also important to know
your family history, as this will
determine your risk for breast
cancer. For example, if your
mother or sister had breast
cancer before menopause and
in both breasts, your risk will
be almost nine times greater
than a woman who has no
family history of cancer. If your
family history shows a case of
breast cancer after menopause
and in only one breast, the risk
is slightly greater than that of a
woman with no family history
of the disease. Your doctor can
advise you whether you have a
higher than average risk for
breast cancer. (Diane Pagani is
