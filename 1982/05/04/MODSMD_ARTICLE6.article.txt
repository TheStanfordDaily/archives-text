# Understanding the Pap test
## 
### 
The Papanicolou smear (Pap
smear or Pap test), a simpleand
painless procedure, is the most
common screening test for cer
vical cancer. Using a swab
and/or stick, the practitioner
scrapes cells off of the cervix
during a pelvic examination
and applies them to a glass
slide, where they are preserved
and reviewed by a cytologist.
Abnormal Pap tests are quite
common. About 25 Pap tests a
week are done at Cowell and
approximately 10-15% of these
are not normal, indicating that
the cytology lab cannot say for
sure that there are no cancer
cells present.
Remember that the Pap test is
a screening test; it does not give
definitive information. The
vast majority of abnormal Pap
tests, when repeated in three to
six months, show a return to
normal. Much of the time a vag
initis or cervicitis has caused
enough inflammation and a
distortion of the cells that the
cytologist can't tell if they are
normal. In such a case, when
the test is repeated after the in
flammation has been treated or
subsided, the Pap usually ap

pears normal again.
If a Pap test is quite abnormal
or if a mild abnormality per
sists for a long time, usually a
culposcopy is recommended.
The culposcope is like an
operating microscope which
allow the gynecologist to view
the cervix under high power. If
an area looks particularly ab
normal, the physician will then
take a biopsy of the area (not
just a scraping but actual tis
sue). Only if the biopsy is
dearly abnormal will any diag
nosis of cancer be considered.
However, the sensitivity of
the Pap test is such that even at
this stage, abnormalities re
vealed in the biopsy can usu
ally be cured, either by
cryosurgery (freezing) or by
cone biopsy (a larger portion of
the cervix is removed). There
are no long-term side effects
from these procedures.
When a Pap report comes
back with an abnormal finding,
many women feel a hysterec
tomy is the next step. That is
simply not true. An abnormal
Pap is a cause for attention and
concern, but need not be re
garded as catastrophic.
