# Preventing exercise-related injury
## 
### Tom Pagani Ken Morgan 
Everyone is into
conditioning. Look around the
campus and you will see
joggers everywhere. Yet the
prevention of athletic injuries
is an area of health in which
most of us are negligent.
Reduction of the possibility of
an injury allows more days of
athletic enjoyment, of feeling
good, of getting into shape, and
of having fun.
Before doing any level of
exercise, know yourself.
Gather as much information as
possible to set some reasonable
goals, and then be flexible
enough to change them, if
necessary. As the workouts
increase, you will learn to use
your body signals as a monitor
for pace, distance and/or
problems.
Many of the injuries treated
at Cowell are the result of
students trying to do too much
too soon. Do not try to play
championship form without
going through the proper
training. Becoming an athlete
in a particular sport takes time
and practice. Do not be overly
competitive early in the
season. Each sport requires a
different set of musculature in
a different sequence of
motions.
The solution is simple, if it
hurts, slow down or stop.
There is an athletic adage
which goes, "train, don't

strain." Conditioning takes
place over a long period of
time, and an injury can cause
enough discomfort to make
you give up after the first few
days. A good warm-up is
essential. Loosen up ankles,
knees, hips, shoulders, trunk
and back, neck, etc. Slow, fluid
and full motion is best. Do not
do any ballistic stretching. As
an example, bouncing up and
down to try to touch the toes
can do more harm than good.
Next break a sweat in an easy
running pace. If your activity
requires cutting motions, then
do a few of these. The same
holds true with throwing
motions. Several daily, mild
stretches of the musculature
involved is critical.
Often overlooked, but
extremely important are the
equipment used and the field
of play. Check for any hazards
on the field or court. Whenever
possible run on grass or trails
which have been built for
runners. Because of the shock
of landing on hard surfaces,
running on roads or sidewalks
can led to ankle, knee and hip
injuries.
Wear the necessary
protective equiment that a
particular sport requires. In
cold weather sports or in sports
in which there is idle time
between plays or halves, keep
warm. Have sweat clothes
handy. Stay loose by not
cooling down too thoroughly.

One of the best ways to avoid
injury is in the shoe
department. Buy a good fitting
pair of shoes that provide
support. Be especially wary of
shoes with excessive heel lifts
as they can cause problems
with a shortened achilles
tendon. Do not buy a pair of
shoes on someone else's
recommendation. The shoe
must fit your foot.
After the activity is over, a
few easy stretches or a short
"cooldown" run will help keep
muscles loose. Take a warm,
cleansing shower. Dry off
thoroughly, including your
hair. Dress warmly if you must
go outside immediately after a
shower; flus and colds can be
just as debilitating as sprains or
strains.
Finally, if you do sustain an
injury, seek immediate and
proper treatment. A
"wait-and-see" attitude can be
mostly frustration.
Volumes have been written
on the subjects of conditioning
and injuries. This is but a
sampling. To understand it
better, read as much as possible
then go out and enjoy yourself.
