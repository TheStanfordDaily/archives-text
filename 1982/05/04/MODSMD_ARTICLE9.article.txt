# Cholesterol can be heartbreaking
## 
### 
Even though most of us (as
students) are healthier than an
older adult population, our
lifestyles now can affect how
healthy we will be in the
future. With heart disease
being the number one killer in
the United States today,
preventive steps taken now can
reduce the probability of heart
disease tomorrow.
Cholesterol levels have long
been the subject of debate as a
risk factor in heart disease. In
1975, however, the
relationship discovered
between lipoproteins,
including cholesterol, offered a
feasible explanation.
along with
triglycerides, are fatty
substances manufactured by
the liver and derived from
foods in our diet, such as meat,
shellfish, dairy products, and
eggs. Cholesterol is only found
in foods of animal origin.
Foods of vegetable origin
contain no cholesterol.
Until the discovery of how
lipoproteins function, the
transportation of these
substances in the body was
unresolved.
What was found is that
cholesterol and triglycerides
are carried through the
bloodstream by a series of
molecules called lipoproteins.
These molecules are classified
by their density: the largest and
least dense are VLDL,
middle-size low density are
LDL, and smaH high density
lipoproteins are HDL.
Low density lipoproteins,
supposedly the worst
of these molecules. They pick
up cholesterol that originates
from the diet or liver and
deposit it in the cells for
processing. If, however, there
is an excess of cholesterol,
some of the LDLs may deposit
the fatty substance on the
interior linings of arteries. This
eventually sets up conditions
for atherosclerosis (hardening
of the arteries) and/or heart
attacks.
High density lipoproteins,
HDLs, work in the opposite
direction. They float in the
bloodstream and pick up
excess cholesterol, and appear
to carry it back to the liver for
excretion from the body. In
effect, what the lipoprotein
hypothesis says, is that a high
HDL/LDL ratio is favorable in
combatting heart disease.
Research done at the
University of Cincinnati
Medical Center showed that a
high HDL level may be an
inherited trait. It was also
discerned that women
generally have a higher
HDL-to-LDL ratio, which is

even more favorable before
menopause.
Dr. Peter Wood, a director of
the Stanford Heart Disease
Prevention Program and
adjunct professor of medicine
at Stanford University, stated
that much of the adult
population already has some
coronary artery disease.
though much of it is
undiagnosed.
Risk factors, though, do vary
among the population. People
with natural HDL protective
levels are less prone to heart
disease. Women also appear to
be less vulnerable, especially
during childbearing years.
Because atherosclerosis
develops gradually, age also
appears to be a powerful risk
factor. Ideally, a person who is
a non-smoker, is not
overweight, has a normal or
low blood pressure, has a high
HDL/LDL ratio, is fairly
relaxed and maintains a good
mental outlook runs a much
lower risk of heart disease.
There are steps to be taken to
achieve this state of health. A
good, low-cholesterol diet
emphasizing vegetables,
whole grain breds and cereals,
fish, little meat, and no junk
fods may have almost the same
effect as a favorable HDL
generic trait. A reduction in
salt intake and shift from
saturated to polyunsaturated
fat is also recommended.
The benefits of rigorous
exercise in relation to heart
disease have been extensively
researched. Regular exercise,
which strengthens the heart
muscle and increases blood
flow, is believed to be
important in creating favorable
HDL levels.
Research done by Dr. Wood
has shown that long distance
runners, characteristically lean
non-smokers with larger
hearts, have a much lower risk
of heart disease than the
general population. There was,
however, little correlation With
the duration of running.
Another study done by Dr.
Ralph Paffenbarger, also of
Stanford, provides some
evidence that physical activity
continued into middle age
protects against heart disease.
In his study, Harvard and
Pennsylvania alumni who
were overweight or smokers,
and also relatively active,
suffered fewer heart attacks
than those who were
overweight or smokers, and
relatively inactive. His studies
also showed that men who
played sports in college but
subsequently gave them up
had no protection against heart
attack later, comparable to
"lifetime sedentary" alumni.

students) are healthier than an
older adult population, our
lifestyles now can affect how
healthy we will be in the
