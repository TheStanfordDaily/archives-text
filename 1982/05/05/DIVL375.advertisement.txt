Dear Graduating Seniors:
By now you probably have received the 1982
Senior Survey. The questionnaire is an
essential part of our continuing efforts to
improve the quality of undergraduate
education at Stanford.
Please complete your questionnaire and
return it to us as soon as possible. Without
your help, it will be impossible for us to learn
from your experiences.
With best wishes,
Donald Kennedy Herant Katchadourian
President Vice Provist and
Dean of Undergraduate
Studies
