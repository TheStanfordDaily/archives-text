London — Britajn suffered its first deaths of the escalating war over
the Falkland Islands yesterday when an Argentine air attack set the de
stroyer HMS Sheffield ablaze, forcing the crew to abandon ship. A Har
rier jet fighter was shot down during another British bombing raid on
airfields in the Faiklands.
The Sheffield, a heavily armed Type 42 destroyer that was one of Brit
ain's most modern warships and which normally carried a crew of nearly
300, was hit by a missile believed to have been fired by an Argentine
warplane inside the 200-mile blockade zone the British are enforcing
around the Faiklands.
"The ship caught fire, which spread out of control," British Defense
Ministry spokesman lan Mcdonald said last night. "When there was no
longer any hope of saving the ship, the ship's company abandoned the
ship. All who abandoned her were picked up."
Repeating the Defense Ministry statement in Parliament later last
night, as Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher sat ashen-faced beside him,
Defense Minister john Nott added that "12 men are missing." Later, in
the midst of heated debate, he broke in dramatically after receiving a
message on the floor and said the death toll "may be as high as 30."
British sources said the operations room of the Sheffield was hit by
one of two radar-guided Exocet air-to-ship missiles fired from as far as
20 miles away by an Argentine warplane, possibly a French-built Super
Etendard fighter-bomber, flying from a base in Argentina. The other of
the two missiles, which skim above the water line after being dropped
from a plane until they hit their target, is reported by British sources to
have missed.
Adhering to strict military censorship, the Defense Ministry did not
reveal the location of the Sheffield when it was attacked. But it could
have been acting as a radar picket between the Faiklands and Argentina
in the blockade zone to give early warning of air attack to the rest of the
British fleet.
Or it could have been escorting one of the two aircraft carriers in the
British task force that would have moved to within 90 miles of East
Falkland Island for yesterday's British bombing raids on island's air
fields, the second wave of such attacks in four days.
One of a number of the carrier-based Sea Harriers participating in
those raids was shot down by Argentine antiaircraft fire. "The pilot has
been killed," ministry spokesman Mcdonald said. "All the other Sea
Harriers returned safely."
As in similar British bombing raids on the Stanley and Goose Green
airfields on the Faiklands on Saturday, both a long-range Vulcan bomb
er flying from Ascension Island and Harrier vertical-takeoff jets from
one of the two aircraft carriers in the task force bombed the Stanley
field. Macdonald said the attack by the Vulcan, which normally carries
21 1000-pound bombs, was "successful" and the Vulcan returned safely
to base.
Saturday's bombing left the Stanley runway "cratered and unusable
by large transport aircraft from the Argentine mainland," Nott told Par
liament in announcing the air raid, but not any casualties, earlier Tues
day. "A further sortie was made today to render the airstrip unusable for
light supply, communications and ground attack aircraft operating
within the Falkland Islands themselves."
