London — Britajn suffered its first deaths of the escalating war over
the Falkland Islands yesterday when an Argentine air attack set the de
stroyer HMS Sheffield ablaze, forcing the crew to abandon ship. A Har
rier jet fighter was shot down during another British bombing raid on
airfields in the Faiklands.
The Sheffield, a heavily armed Type 42 destroyer that was one of Brit
ain's most modern warships and which normally carried a crew of nearly
300, was hit by a missile believed to have been fired by an Argentine
warplane inside the 200-mile blockade zone the British are enforcing
around the Faiklands.
"The ship caught fire, which spread out of control," British Defense
Ministry spokesman lan Mcdonald said last night. "When there was no
longer any hope of saving the ship, the ship's company abandoned the
ship. All who abandoned her were picked up."
Repeating the Defense Ministry statement in Parliament later last
night, as Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher sat ashen-faced beside him,
Defense Minister john Nott added that "12 men are missing." Later, in
the midst of heated debate, he broke in dramatically after receiving a
message on the floor and said the death toll "may be as high as 30."
British sources said the operations room of the Sheffield was hit by
one of two radar-guided Exocet air-to-ship missiles fired from as far as
20 miles away by an Argentine warplane, possibly a French-built Super
Etendard fighter-bomber, flying from a base in Argentina. The other of
the two missiles, which skim above the water line after being dropped
from a plane until they hit their target, is reported by British sources to
have missed.
Adhering to strict military censorship, the Defense Ministry did not
reveal the location of the Sheffield when it was attacked. But it could
have been acting as a radar picket between the Faiklands and Argentina
in the blockade zone to give early warning of air attack to the rest of the
British fleet.
Or it could have been escorting one of the two aircraft carriers in the
British task force that would have moved to within 90 miles of East
Falkland Island for yesterday's British bombing raids on island's air
fields, the second wave of such attacks in four days.
One of a number of the carrier-based Sea Harriers participating in
those raids was shot down by Argentine antiaircraft fire. "The pilot has
been killed," ministry spokesman Mcdonald said. "All the other Sea
Harriers returned safely."
As in similar British bombing raids on the Stanley and Goose Green
airfields on the Faiklands on Saturday, both a long-range Vulcan bomb
er flying from Ascension Island and Harrier vertical-takeoff jets from
one of the two aircraft carriers in the task force bombed the Stanley
field. Macdonald said the attack by the Vulcan, which normally carries
21 1000-pound bombs, was "successful" and the Vulcan returned safely
to base.
Saturday's bombing left the Stanley runway "cratered and unusable
by large transport aircraft from the Argentine mainland," Nott told Par
liament in announcing the air raid, but not any casualties, earlier Tues
day. "A further sortie was made today to render the airstrip unusable for
light supply, communications and ground attack aircraft operating
within the Falkland Islands themselves."
Thatcher made no comment yesterday night on the first
reported British combat casualties of the conflict. Only one
British seaman was previously reported injured, in addition
to a helicopter crewmen who died in an accidental crash.
The shaken and saddened British government suffered the
first effects yesterday of what is expected to mount into a
gale of criticism in the days ahead over its handling of the
Falkland Islands crisis.
On the day the British destroyer Sheffield was sunk by an
Argentine aerial attack, the government was suffering as
saults — some direct, some veiled — from its leftist opposi
tion in Parliament, from its allies in the European Economic
Community and even from the United States.
How well Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher can weather
the storm of rebuke may well determine the fate of her gov
ernment, political analysts here said.
Argentine crew still missing 360
Buenos Aires, Argentina — Some 360 men remained miss
ing in the South Atlantic yesterday as Argentina counted the
lives saved and lost when the aged cruiser General Belgrano
sailed out to its last battle.
Launched in 1938 as the U.S. Navy light cruiser Phoenix,
the Gen. Belgrano had a long and colorful history. The
Japanese missed her at Pearl Harbor. But at dusk Sunday, the
British did not.
In a confrontation between a navy of today and a navy of
the past, the British nuclear submarine Conqueror sank the
old cruiser in the waters south of the Falkland Islands. The<
British used two Tigerfish torpedoes, which have a range of
20 miles, and are guided to their target by wire and com
puter.
The torpedoes cost almost $1 million apiece Only a hand
ful of vessels as old as the Gen. Belgrano still remain in sevice
in the 1980s.
But, naval experts here surmised, from the location where
the Belgrano sunk, that the Belgrano may have been at
tempting to move into combat. The ship sank south of the
westernmost of the two islands in the Falklands, called the
Malvinas here, and may have been attempting to skirt the is
lands to the east and get into position for a surprise strike on
the British fleet or garrison left on the South Georgia Islands
800 miles east.
Except for the aircraft carrier 25 of May, she was Argen
tina's biggest ship.
Ireland calls for Security Council
meeting on Falklands crisis
Paris — Ireland called yesterday for an urgent meeting of
the United Nations Security Council as Britain's European
Community partners abandoned their previously united
backing for Lonuuii in the Falkland Islands crisis.
Sharing the Irish proposal for a cease-fire and U.N. in
volvement in negotiations between Argentina and Britain
were the Italian and West German governments.
In addition, the Irish announced they will seek the lifting
of economic sanctions taken by the 10-nation community on
April 10 to back Britain's diplomatic efforts to force Argen
tina to withdraw its occupation troops from the Falklands.
(U.N. Secretary General Javier Perez de Cuellar said yes
terday that he has set a deadline of midday today for Britain
and Argentina to reply to proposals for resolving the crisis,
and a senior official said the Security Council will be con
vened if the reaction is negative, special correspondent
Michael Berlin reported from the United Nations.)
Behind the change of heart of Britain's major European al
lies lay the extent of the hostilities in the South Atlantic, es
pecially the feared high death toll aboard the Argentine
cruiser General Belgrano torpedoed and sunk by a British
submarine, although the day's developments came before
the British announced that one of their destroyers had been
sunk by an Argentine missile.
Gone was the mood of self-congratulation generated
within days of Argentina's seizure of the British-ruled islands
when London's European partners unanimously applied ec
onomic sanctions against the Buenos Aires government last
month.
As that unity evaporated yesterday, Irish Defense Minister
Patrick Power told reporters in Dublin before a Cabinet ses
sion, "We felt Argentina was the first aggressor and originally
backed Britain, but obviously the British themselves are very
much the aggressors now, and we are taking a neutral
stance."
Echoing a line developed by West German, Italian and
Danish leaders, the Irish government said it was "appalled by
the outbreak of what amounts to open war."
In Bonn, West German Chancellor Helmut Schmidt said
"we are concerned" about the hostilities. Later, government
spokesman Lothar Ruehl expressed Bonn's "surprise and
dismay" at the sinking of the cruiser, "in which many persons
obviously lost their lives."
He appealed for a cease-fire and asked both sides to "ex
plore all possibilities for a peaceful solution" of the crisis.
France, previously the most solid supporter of the British
stand on the Falklands, expressed its "consternation" at the
cruiser's sinking in a Foreign Ministry spokesman's
statement.

Andre Chandernagor, deputy foreign minister for Europe
an affairs, told a radio station that hostilities should "eno as
quickly as possible" and regretted that the crisis had "de
generated into war."
Hinckley trial begins
Washington — John Hinckley was portrayed yesterday
both as a cunning, patient gunman who had "a conscious
plan" to assassinate President Reagan and as a lonely, "alien
ated" young man with a history of mental troubles.
The two pictures of Hinckley were presented by prose
cution and defense attorneys in their opening statements to
a newly sworn jury at Hinckley's trial on charges of attempt
ing to assassinate President Ronald Reagan.
As Hinckley, seated at the defense table, stared ahead
blankly with hands folded on his lap, chief prosecutor Roger
Adelman said the 26-year-old defendant had "a deliberate
plan, a conscious plan" to murder Reagan on March 30,1901.
Several weeks earlier Hinckley had practiced target shoot
ing in Denver, not far from the home of his parents, Adelman
said. Later Hinckley purchased a quantity of explosive "Dev
astator" bullets to use against the president, the prosecutor
told jurors.
The day of the shooting in Washington Hinckley "loaded
six of them, one at a time," into his .22-caliber revolver,
Adelman said. "Think about that when we talk of grand plan
ning."
Hinckley's defense is based on a plea of insanity. jUnder a
ruling handed down Saturday, to obtain a conviction, the
prosecution must prove "beyond a reasonable doubt" that
Hinckley was sane.
Israelis kill one in riots
Jerusalem — Israeli soldiers shot and killed an Arab
schoolgirl yesterday and wounded another in the Gaza Strip
as sometimes-violent Arab demonstrations against Israeli oc
cupation policies continued, the military said.
Military sources said that troops fired at the legs of rioting
students at a girls' high school in the Gaza village of Khan
Yunis but one girl was hit in the chest. She died later at a hos
pital.
The dead student was identified by Palestinian sources as
Ehssan Abu Druz, 17. The wounded girl was identified as
Sabash Ibrahim Abu Ismail, 18.
Military sources said a group of about 10 knife-wielding
teenage boys, their faces covered by Arab khaffiya head
scarves, entered the school and attempted to organize a
demonstration. Soldiers followed the youths onto tne cam
pus and arrested two of them.
The girls showered the army patrol with rocks, bricks, ce
ment building blocks, chairs and other debris. Military au
thorities said the troops first fired warning shots, then fired at
the girls' legs.
Palestinian sources said the troops also used tear gas.
The death increased to 11 the number of Arabs reported
by the Israeli military to have been killed in seven weeks of
rioting that began after Israeli authorities dismissed the
elected mayor of the West Bank town of El Birch.
During the same period, two Israeli soldiers were killed
and 33 Israeli troops and 38 Israeli civilians were wounded.
The four West Bank mayors — all with close ties to the
Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO) — were dismissed as
part of a campaign by Menachem Milson, the head of the six
month-old Israeli West Bank civil administration, to break
the political power of the PLO in the occupied territories.
However, Milson was reported yesterday to have ex
pressed concern that the ultimate result of the campaign
may be the collapse of municipal services throughout tne
West Bank. Most other West Bank mayors, town council
members and other municipal authorities have threatened
to quit their jobs if the four ousted mayors are not reinstated.
"The collapse of the municipalities is not in Israel's best in
terests," Milson told a meeting of military and civilian of
ficers, according to the left-leaning Hebrew newspaper Al
Hamishmar. The newspaper reported that Milson said nis in
tention in ousting the mayors was to end their radical leader
ship while leaving municipal services intact.
Justice Dept. refuses tape release
Washington — The Justice Department refused yesterday
to provide the Senate Labor Committee with the secretly
recorded conversations of a reputed Mafia soldier involving
Secretary of Labor Raymond Donovan.
Although the tapes were provided last year to the alleged
mobster and his co-defendants in two criminal cases, the FBI
took the position that the contents "could compromise the
identity of a confidential source" and might "result in dan
ger to the source and others close to the source."
By contrast, special prosecutor Leon Silverman, whose
staff has already reviewed all of the so-called "Masselli
tapes," has said he had no objection to the committee's re
quest.
Administration officials, it was clear, were still miffed by
the committee's release last weekend of certain incriminat
ing allegations and other information about Donovan that
had remained buried in the FBl's files during last year's
stormy Senate confirmation hearings.
Committee Chairman Orrin Hatch (R-Utah) and Sen. Ed
ward Kennedy (D-Mass.) decided to make the details public

and called on the FBI for an explanation of what went wrong.
justice Department spokesman Tom DeCair indicated that
no thought was given to providing the tapes to the commit
tee in return for a pledge to keep them secret.
"There's no reason to believe that anything given to Sen.
Hatch can remain confidential," DeCair said. "The last batch
of stuff we sent up there wound up coming out in Senate re
port with a stamp on it saying 'Embargoed for Sunday re
lease.' "
In a letter delivered yesterday to Hatch and Kennedy, As
sistant Attorney General Robert McConnell said another
reason for the denial was that "the material requested also
contains allegations of improper conduct, uncorroborated
by investigation, concerning government officials" other
than Donovan.
Republican leader breaks with
Reagan over budget dispute
Washington — Senate Budget Committee Chairman Pete
Domenici (R-N.M.) brushed aside President Ronald Rea
gan's budget yesterday and proposed massive deficit reduc
tions including a $125 billion tax increase over the next three
years and the freezing of many federal programs, including
Social Security and pay for government workers, for at least
one year.
In the first such open break with Reagan by a Republican
leader, Domenici said he would accept a delay in the 10 per
cent individual income tax cut scheduled for July 1903, which
Reagan has attempted to rule off-limits in the budget debate.
"If that is the price of an agreement that will lower interest
rates and lead to a real recovery, then I will pay such a price,"
said Domenici of deferring the tax cut as he laid out his latest
budget alternative as the starting point for rewriting Rea
gan's high-deficit budget for fiscal 1983.
At the White House, the initial reaction was chilly but low
key. Deputy presidential press secretary Larry Speakes said
Reagan opposed "certain elements" of Domenici's plan, in
cluding deferral of the 1983 tax cut and any Social Security
savings that do "not focus on the goal of restoring the
solvency" of the system.
Domenici acknowledged that his plan, which calls for $228
billion in spending cuts as well as $125 billion in tax increases
to reduce the federal deficit from a possible $233 billion to
$19 billion by 1985, does not yet have the votes even to get
out of his committee.
Brezhnev cites British colonialism
Moscow — Soviet President Leonid Brezhnev, in his first
public comments on the Falkland Islands conflict, implicitly
accused Britain yesterday of "colonial brigandage" in its ef
forts to reclaim the disputed South Atlantic islands.
Speaking at a Kremlin dinner Nicaraguan leader Daniel
Ortega, Brezhnev stopped well short of endorsing Argen
tina's invasion of the Falklands a month ago. His remarks
were brief, circumspect and cautious and contained no clear
suggestion that the Soviet Union contemplates an active role
in the crisis. He did not mention Britain or Argentina by
name.
"The people want to be masters of their land, of their
homes, be it in Central America or in the South Atlantic,"
Brezhnev said, in an assertion that appeared to overlook the
staunchly pro-British feelings of the Falkland Islands' 1800 ci
vilian residents.
Brezhnev's remarks on the Falklands, confined to five
short paragraphs in a speech notable for its brevity, were
consistent with Soviet press reports, which have been thor
oughly sympathetic toward Argentina without actually en
dorsing its use of force.
"And if in the Western hemisphere, too, there emerge
dangerous complications and conflict situations, it is precise
ly because there are forces which are trying to preserve or
restore their positions of dominance and to impose foreign
oppression on the peoples.
"They do not stop at threats and pressure, blackmail and
blockade, or the use of arms," Brezhnev said, and went on to
accuse unnamed forces of resorting to actions "hailing back
to the time of colonial brigandage."

enx ession, closed with a 5.42 gain at 854.45.

under 10 points.
