# Job quotas: hated, but useful
## 
### Washington Post 
Washington — As the Senate argued its way
toward passage of the Civil Rights Act one day in
1964, one of its leading liberals, exasperated,
tried one more time to reassure the opposition
on a critical point.
"I will start eating the pages, one after anoth
er," Sen. Hubert Humphrey (D-Minn.) vowed, if
they contain "any language which provides that
an employer will have to hire on the basis of per
centage or quota related to color."
That "bugaboo," he assured at another point,
"is nonexistent."
Humphrey never ate those words. But 18 years
after passage of the historic act and over a dec
ade after the Nixon administration introduced
the notion of goals and timetables for hiring
blacks and others, American society is still
digesting the bugaboo.
Government-enforced employment quotas
based on sex, race or other group status have
grown into the most explosive, the most de
spised and, supporters say, one of the most ef
fective of the anti-discrimination initiatives.
They are a key tool — but not the only one —
in the audacious package known loosely as "af
firmative action."
In the simplest terms, the phrase "affirmative
action" means doing something that takes race
or sex specifically into account in order to repair
the effects of injustice, something beyond sim
ply, passively, not being unjust anymore.
It lies at the heart of the civil rights issue of the
decade: access to jobs. And yet Congress has
passed no law spelling out what it is.
Instead, a sort of bureaucratic virgin birth oc
curred in about 1969, when Nixon appointees in
the Labor Department made the hiring of white
women and minorities a bid specification under
federal procurement law, just as bids specify a
certain weight of nail or grade of marble.
Its actual record of achievements, shrouded in
righteous rhetoric from all sides, is a murky one
— of small, haphazard successes, crazy ironies
and a high price-tag of bitterness and confusion.
Today's hard times and the uneven effects of
affirmative action threaten the tenuous political
coalition that has fought for equal opportunity.

For instance, blacks, especially men, express re
sentment that white women are reaping greater
benefits than they, the original objects of af
firmative action.
Redistributing privileges is never easy, but the
civil rights movement did not invent the idea.
Both federal and state governments have for
decades made a major exception to the merit
standard by affording massive, permanent, spe
cial preferences to military veterans at virtually
every level.
How has affirmative action worked for its in
tended beneficiaries, those known in the
parlance as "protected classes?" In general, of
course, they continue to lag far behind white
men in terms of earnings and employment.
But evidence shows that the policy has
spurred significant advances in certain catego
ries, for certain people, at least for the short
term:
— White women — the largest of all groups,
including white men in total population, and
over 43 percent of the workforce — are the big
gest gainers. The vaunted "influx of women"
into the workforce has consisted essentially of
white women, who have taken a share of new
opportunities out of proportion to even their
large numbers.
— Black women, with their "two-fer" status,
also seem to have taken relatively good advan
tage of new openings, although some specialists
believe this is changing. Black women have
always had a high work rate, traditionally in low
er-rung jobs. The rising generation is breaking
out of the house-maid role and into better
paying fields and they even out-earn white
women in three occupational categories: man
agerial, clerical and sales.
— Black men advanced in certain categories.
A study for the Urban League indicates that in
the last decade black men have increased by 71
percent in higher-paying jobs (managers, pro
fessionals and skilled craft workers), or twice the
rate of their overall employment growth. (Blacks
and other minorities such as American Indians
are 12.6 percent of the workforce, and Hispanics
— most of them included in the white count —
are about 5.5 percent.)
