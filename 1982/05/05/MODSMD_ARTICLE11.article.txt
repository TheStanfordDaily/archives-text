## Packing them in—spring quarter dorm plays 
### Rose Chan 
Being 3000 miles away from the lights of
42nd Street seems not to have dampened the
zeal of theater fans here. Just as there are
Broadway shows and off-Broadway shows in
New York, Stanford has institutional theater
and lower-key dorm productions. This spring
alone, almost a dozen house productions
have or will vie with the likes of Ram's Head,
the Company and Savoyard productions for
the attention of the Stanford community.
Offerings range from the traditional Broad
way musicals to theater of the absurd.
"I think the reason most of us do it is just
because it's a lot of fun," said Philip Halperin
who is producing the Branner version of Bye,
Bye, Birdie, "This is a good chance to try the
stage."
"It's the first time I've ever acted," said
Christopher' Keys, supporting actor and tech
nical director for Cardenal's production of
The Man Who Came to Dinner. "I thought it
would be fun to put on a play on our own.
And, the only way to get a major role was to
put on our own."
For Paul Salazar, the play's director, much
of the fun conies from watching people play
characters similar to themselves. "Tne cast
ing is really typecast," he said. "They're
almost all doing their roles without trying
and without realizing it."
Choosing a show is based on any of several
factors, as suggested by the wide range of
productions being done this quarter. Most
houses opt to do musicals. Madera's The Boys
from Syracuse, Larkin's Joseph and the Amaz
ing Technicolored Dreamcoat, and Toyon's
The Pajama Came are examples. In contrast,
the Florence-Moore based productions, The
Mouse That Roared and The Man That Came
to Dinner are comedy plays.
"Technically, it's an easy show to do," said
Halperin of Bye, Bye Birdie. "Otherwise, we
chose it because it's about teenagers and
teeny boppers. People could play them

selves. It's easy to do in terms of singing, and
it's hard to put on a really bad Bye, Bye
Birdie."
Phi Psi's choice of the absurdist play,
Knackery Made Easy, held last month, was
made for other reasons. "I thought it was a
good choice, because it had so many charac
ters in it. All the characters were a lot of fun
and you didn't need a whole lot of acting ex
perience," said janet Heimlich, the
play'sdirector. "It came off very well and
we're all really proud of it."
"Another reason we did the show was it's a
show that Stanford rarely sees. It's an anti-war
play and it's not mainstream by any means.
We didn't want to do anything that was com
mercial. We really went for something that
was left-field — and had a lot of fun as a re
sult."
The search for willing and dedicated work
ers is not easy in spite of the high interest in
drama. Director Salazar recalled, "All of a
sudden, lots of people were interested — but
no one wanted to be in charge."
The size and composition of a house work
as limiting factors. Kappa Sigma had to draw
on outside talent for its production of Harvey.
The comedy is about a 6-foot-IVi inch in
visible rabbit who befriends a man named
Elwood P. Dowd.
Another production with special problems
is No, No, Nanette sponsored by the Row
Houses. "I don't think any play has been
done by the Row," said jim Sherman, musical
director for the production. "It's difficult to
get participation on the Row." Fifteen people
auditioned last weekend for the seven leads
in the musical. Although the lead parts were
cast, Sherman said more people were needed
for the chorus and the orchestra.
"There's problems," said Cardenal's
Salazar. Actors with bit parts are "not as dedi
cated to it because they don't have as much at
stake. It's totally understandable. We all
didn't want it to run our lives.

TAKE FIVE — This quarter's schedule is packed full of dorm plays. (Counter
clockwise from upper left) Toyon play members read over their script as they pre
pare for opening night of The Pajama Came. Set construction is another important
dimension of preparing for a play. During rehearsal, actors often find time for relax
ing in between tneir lines. AH the worm may be a stage but the Madera first-floor
bathroom was the make-up room for the house's production of The Boys from Syr
acuse Practice makes perfect for the actors in Larkin's Joseph and his Amazing
Technicolor Coat And finally as the rehearsals end, these two actors get a chance
to show their stuff on stage tor Roble's Little Mary Sunshine
