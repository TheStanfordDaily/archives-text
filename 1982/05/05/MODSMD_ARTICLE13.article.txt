## Editorial Terrorism distorts election 
### 
Any hope that the Reagan administration was
sincerely pursuing a policy that encouraged the
respect for human rights in El Salvador has been
completely dashed by its recent assurances of
continued aid to that nation in light of the
election of former Major Roberto D'Aubuisson
as president of the constituent assembly.
Apparently, the Reagan administration is
unconcerned with the solid evidence linking
D'Aubuisson to numerous political murders —
evidence that prompted former U.S.
Ambassador to El Salvador Robert White to refer
to him as a "psychopathic killer."
D'Aubuisson, leader of the right wing
Nationalist Republican Alliance (ARENA) will
wield a great deal of clout in the constituent
assembly even though his powers will be
subordinate to those of recently-named
president Alvaro Magana.
Known by some as "Major Blowtorch" in
reference to his sadistic treatment of victims,
D'Aubuisson has a long history of violence. He
has been closely associated with paramilitary
death squads responsible for the murders of
hundreds of civilians and left wing politicians.
D'Aubuisson ordered the 1979 murder of
Archbishop Romero, a champion of peace and
social reform in this strife-torn country.
D'Aubuisson's activities are repugnant
enough when taken alone, but they are even
more damaging when they are considered in
the context of the situation in El Salvador. The
overall effect of the systematic elimination of
political opposition carried on by people like
D'Aubuisson was to ensure a climate where
political parties on the left would refuse to
participate in the election process for fear of
their lives.
The ruthless and brutal terrorism carried out
by people like D'Aubuisson had the effect of

making the whole election process illegitimate.
Now D'Aubuisson and the right wing party
leaders are capitalizing on the distorted election
process that they helped to create, by taking all
of the important cabinet positions in the
government. The Christian Democrats — the
only centrist party that participated in the
elections — are now almost totally excluded
from the new government.
The travesty of democracy being played out in
El Salvador continues to be encouraged by the
Reagan administration. This support is clearly
illustrated by a recent statement made by U.S.
Ambassador to El Salvador Deane Hinton in
which he called the election of D'Aubuisson "an
example of democracy at work."
The failure of the Reagan administration to
recognize the unrepresentative process which
brought about D'Aubuisson's rise to power and
to realize what a dangerous and violent man he
is, further emphasizes the true objective of this
administration's policy — to stop what it sees as
the Communist threat. Unfortunately, the
Reagan administration sees all parties on the
left, which have the support of a large
percentage of the population, as being
connected to Moscow through the as yet
unproven, El Salvador to Nicaragua to Cuba to
Russia link.
Besides being morally abhorrent, the terrorist
activities of D'Aubuisson provide ample reason
for seriously considering a halt to American aid
to El Salvador, but when considering the
election process that put him into power the
arguments against aid become convincing.
Thus we advocate an immediate halt to U.S.
aid to El Salvador and the opening of a
negotiated settlement that includes the current
government and representatives from the leftist
parties.
