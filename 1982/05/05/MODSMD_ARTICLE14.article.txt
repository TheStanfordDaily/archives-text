# Perspectives on the important, urgent
## 
### 
On any day, if you were to ask ten people if they
could spare a few minutes to chat, they would
probably glance at their watch, sigh with regret
and say they had an urgent meeting to attend, or
an urgent phone call to receive or something or
other very urgent to do. The encounter would
leave you feeling rather unimportant.
But, I think, it is not so much that you were "un
important," rather you were just not "urgent."
The difference between the two concepts is of
more than just semantic significance to us.
Although something that is important can be ur
gent and vice versa, usually urgency characterizes
something whose value rises to supremacy for a
brief span of time. Urgent matters must be taken
care of immediately and for their moment of glory
demand our full attention. Among the urgencies
that crowd our schedules are tests, bills, phone
calls, burning toast, messy rooms and the vast array
of mechanical gadgets that seem to break down
one after another. Like these, most urgencies are
temporal and tangible.
Importance, on the other hand, abides in some
thing that has consistent value unaffected by time.
Probably the most compatible synonym would be
"worth," whose root in classical Greek literally
means "tipping of the scales" â€” something that
has weight. Among such important things are
friendships, life goals, human rights, preservation
of freedom, justice and mercy towards those who
suffer. These needs are generally less tangible and
more perrrvanent.
The profilem arises when those things deemed
"urgent" consistently preempt those things we
recognize as "important." The danger is that we

can become so bound to the urgent that we never
are free to undertake the important. Indeed the
complexity of our lifestyles today contains enough
urgencies to completely consume most of our
waking hours; the chaos, our elders say, only gets
worse.
The dilemma is analogous to the student who in
tends to buy collision insurance for his car but the
mid-term and the party and the football game
make the purchase of it this week impossible.
Besides, odds are small that he will have an acci
dent this week. This justication continues until, ac
cording to Murphy's Law, the accident occurs. The
student explains to his parents that he had planned
to purchase insurance the next day and his parents
say that such a thing is very important and he says
"I know." Left long enough alone, the important
does become urgent, but by this time it is often too
late.
Certainly there are more poignant examples
than car insurance.
World hunger, for instance, remains a problem
of lasting significance of which we all are aware.
But few of us, I would imagine, have resolved upon
a personal course of action in response. Detached
from the struggle for food, we are only reminded
of the suffering of undernourished peoples
through irregular news reports and pictures.
Unless we observe the suffering first hand, the
need for us to research our options for contribu
tion will seldom seem urgent. Nevertheless, this
should not diminish its importance; the problem
certainly will not go away. Numerous organiza
tions allow students on a budget to aid the famine
stricken countries through specially targeted, af
fordable programs.
Another important but often ignored emphasis
is the skill of conducting successful relationships,
especially those within the family. We musn't too
quickly dismiss this topic as a pious sermon on eth
ics, inapplicable to real problems. The less pleasant
aspects of politics, law and international affairs
have come about because people have not
learned to live with each other. Indeed the crisis in

the Falklands sprouts from the same ignoble hu
man traits that cause two children to fight over a
toy truck; the former, of course, is a crisis of
greater complexity and of graver consequences.
For parents, urgencies can easily and seemingly
harmlessly hinderthe important time spent with
their children. Similarly, recognizing the needs of
a spouse can become hindered by the pressures
that come from meeting the demands of bosses
and clients. The fragmentation of the family units
and the ill effects that follow witness to the im
portance of diligently seeking to conduct suc
cessful relationships.
As our society increasingly seeks to find fulfill
ment in material gain, it has become easier to table
indefinitely questions about our own human na
ture and our spirituality. These questions are not so
heavenly minded that they are of no earthly good.
Every theory of politics and social behavior has at
its base an assumption about human nature. Au
gustine, Acquinas, Bacon, Shakespeare, Freud,
Marx and innumerable others had to deal first with
questions about the nature of man and the ex
istence of God before going on with their works.
Indeed the question of God's relationship to
man holds profound possibilities for improvement
of ourselves as individuals, the knowledge of our
identity and the hopes for our future. Any issue
that has engaged great minds for centuries is wor
thy of more advanced contemplation than an athe
ist at a firing squad might give it.
To live life by those urgent needs that, like trick
birthday candles, perpetually summon our atten
tion is to live life by accident, never quite in control
of our direction. Becoming singleminded people
who are determined to define and pursue those
things that are truly important will free us from
what has been called the "tyranny of the urgent."
The horror of ignoring this issue is the inevitable
realization that one has spent one's life doing what
was urgent, but not what was important.
