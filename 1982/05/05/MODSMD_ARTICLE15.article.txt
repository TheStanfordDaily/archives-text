## British imperialismâ€”interloping since 1833 
### 
President Monroe is remembered in history with his
famous quote: "America for Americans." It may be that
President Ronald Reagan will be remembered with a
similar quote: "America for the British."
It seems that the American leaders, have consistently
misunderstood the people living below the Rio Grande.
The situation in Cuba, Nicaragua and El Salvador are ex
amples of the policies employed in Latin America. The
words: "Yankees go home" are, in many countries, the
first English words most Latin Americans learn.
Unable to understand other American peoples, the
U.S. leaders have tried to support dictatorial type gov
ernments in Latin America; as in Brazil and Guatemala
among others.
It happens now that American leaders are unable to
understand either a dictatorial type government or the
Argentinian people. They decided to support the British
economically and militarily. Last Friday, the U.S. govern
ment officially decided to support Great Britain in a 19th
century type colonialist expedition with the final goal of
invading the Malvinas Islands (Falklands for the British)
for the second time in 150 years.
In 1816, Argentina declared herself an independent
country. The territory, at that moment called Vice-King
dom of the Rio de la Plata, became what is called now
Argentina. A couple of islands in the south Atlantic,
called Malvinas, were part of the Vice-Kingdom and
therefore, part of Argentina.
In 1823, Argentina designated Pablo Arequati gov
ernor of the islands, while many Argentinian families
moved there to do sheep farming. On Jan. 3, 1833, the
British decided to invade the islands and they did so, ex
pelling all the Argentinians. One Argentinian, Rivero,
did not obey, and he was put in jail for 15 years.
Since that moment, only white (no black) members of
the Commonwealth were allowed to live there. Many

Argentinians wanted to move to the islands, others
wanted to buy land and some Argentinian private busi
ness wanted to open commercial branches, but none
was allowed.
Sir 1833, Argentina has tried to recover the islands,
illegally taken by the British by diplomatic means, and
has presented form.il protests to the British every year
since then. Little could be done against the most pow
erful empire of the 19th century. In 1965, keeping the
diplomatic alternative, Argentina achieved an important
progress: a resolution from the United Nations urging
Great Britain to start talkings with Argentina about the
return of the islands.
For 16 years the talks were a total waste of time. The
British had decided to keep the islands, seized by the use
of force.
On April 2,1982, Argentina, using force as Great Brit
ain used 149 years ago, recovered the islands.
The British government, feeling that only Great Britain
is allowed to use force, built a special task force to invade
the islands for a second time.
In this context it is very important to remark that al- !
though the decision to invade the islands was taken by a
dictatorial type government, the responsibility of the de
cision was assumed by the Argentinian people. Proof of
this assertion are the massive rallies that have run all over
Argentina since April 2 supporting the decision, the
many millions of dollars raised from private donations,
the Argentinian women knitting and cooking for the sol
diers. People are committed in keeping what they own. (
The Argentinians want to live in their own country.
They do not want war, they want to live in peace with all
countries but they expect that the other countries of the
world will respect their rights.
