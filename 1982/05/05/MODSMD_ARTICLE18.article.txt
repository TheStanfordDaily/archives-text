## Whistle-blowing? 
### 
David Lempert wrote to the Daily
to complain that his sleep was being
interrupted by sirens. "Hardly a day
goes by that I do not hear a siren."
My God, I had not thought it so seri
ous! And furthermore, it seems the
police actually arrested a man sus
pected of being the campus rapist
and he turned out to be innocent. So,
maybe they had a good reason to sus
pect him. He turned out to be inno
cent! Next thing you know, the po
lice will be after the guy who at
tacked the Stanford woman near
Kresge on April 29.
It makes Lempert nervous that
there are so many police around.
Then he says that the highest crime
rate occurs when there is a shortage
of police. Excellent reason for cutting
down the Stanford police force,
David. I only wonder how your
female friend can say she feels safe
with all these silly noise-making ma
chines cruising the campus, driven
by you-know-whos. Forget the at
tack, forget the vandalization of
school offices and for God's sake,
forget the rapes. You've convinced
me, David. I, too,, no longer believe
that there is a potential for serious
crime around Stanford. No longer
will I escort my female friends to or

from anywhere. No longer will I
cheer the disillusioned SURE volun
teers. No longer will I congratulate
the Daily, or any organization, for
blowing stories out of proportion, or
for inventing some horror-comic
scenario. And no longer will I toler
ate the noisy, nosey police force in
terrupting my carefree existence, not
to mention my sleep. Go get 'em
David! I'm behind you all the way!

Murphy's collision law
On Friday afternoon, large ob
stacles materialized on the ap
proaches to the ramps in the space
between the Mitchell Building and
Durand. I presume that these ob
stacles are intended to deny the use
of the ramps to automobiles. While
most of us agree upon the desirability
of keeping cars out of the inner cam
pus, we should bear in mind that this
is not an end in itself. The ultimate
objective is, of course, to make the
campus a relatively safe place for pe
destrians and cyclists.
It appears that the grand idea has
been forgotten in this case — my im
pression of these new barriers is that
they must be a greater hazard than
the cars that they are re-routing. Any
student of Murphy's law knows that a
catastrophic collision between a bike
and a barrier will occur sooner or lat
er and in view of the design of these
particular obstructions my guess is
that it will be sooner — perhaps it has
happened already. (Those who are
annoyed by the careless habits of
some cyclists might find justice in
this, but the first victim will not nec
essarily be of that group.) My
purpose in writing is simply to re
mind the traffic moniters of the
purpose of their work and to suggest
that they reconsider whether that
purpose is best served by these new
devices.

0.K., I'm going to make an issue
out of nothing — Cory Brinaughti's
letter, "Shocked and Appalled" In
last Friday's Daily. Let's get serious;
Spring is a time for fun. It also gets
pretty hot come springtime in Cali
fornia. Hence, we shed the long
pants and the sweaters for more com
fortable shorts and t-shirts. And yes,
even the female half of the popu
lation does the same. Is there some
thing so wrong with being cool and
comfortable? Does this really mean
that our morals are suffering, just be
cause of the sun?
