Stanford sophomore Chris John
son committed suicide - yesterday
evening by diving from the second
floor roof of Terra House in the Cow
ell Cluster. Officials at Stanford Uni
versity Hospital pronounced John
son dead at 6:44 p.m., 24 minutes af
ter his arrival there.
Emergency Center Nurse Mary
Durando attributed the death to
massive head and internal injuries in
curred as a result of the dive.
Johnson had gone up to the roof at
approximately 4:30 p.m. and Terra
resident associate Brent Haddad
spent more than an hour trying to
talk him out of jumping.
The Santa Clara County Coroner is
currently investigating the case and
will perform an autopsy this after
noon, according to Durando.
Johnson was a former resident of
Terra, who had stopped out this
quarter and was living on the sun
roof of Terra. He was a 20-year-old
native of Alexandria, Virginia. Dean
of Student Affairs James Lyons
notified Johnson's parents of the
death last night.
Terra resident John Delgado said
that he had talked to Johnson for an
hour-and-a-half yesterday afternoon
at which time he realized something

was wrong with Johnson.
"He was incoherent and down on
himself/' Delgado said, adding that
johnson was depressed because he
felt that he was letting his friends
down. "Apparently he had become
really depressed this weekend,"he
said.
Laura Nordby, a Stanford student
who was walking through the court
yard of Terra immediately before the
suicide, said that when she realized
what was going on she tried to help
Haddad talk Johnson out of suicide,
but that Johnson was not responding
to anything they were saying.
Nordby said that while Haddad was
talking to Johnson he was on a lower
level of the roof and was unable to
reach Johnson. When he jumped
Nordby said she tried to somehow
break his fall but was unsuccessful.
One resident said that earlier yes
terday Johnson came up to a resident
to whom he usually did not speak
and gave hera hug and said goodbye.
Johnson was characterized by one
Terra resident as someone who
seemed "real happy" and usually
walked around the house smiling.
Meanwhile Nordby said that John
son "had always been someone
who's looking for the truth."
