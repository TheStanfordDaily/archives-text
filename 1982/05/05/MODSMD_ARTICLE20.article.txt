# Homes with a bit of history
## 
### Audrey Yee 
They might be missed at first
— they're sprinkled amongst
the houses of modern day sub
urbia, but a closer look reveals
Queen Anne ornamentation.
Or that decorative porch might
suddenly catch the eye and re
mind the observer that traces
of the past are lurking in the
sleepy neighborhood.
These are the 16 historical
homes of College Terrace,
nearly all built at the turn of the
century and virtually in Stan
ford's backyard, bordering the
Escondido village side of cam
pus. The Palo Alto Historic Re
sources Board and Palo Alto
Historical Association have or
ganized a historical tour of Col
lege Terrace with the homes
described architecturally and
historically in their brief pam
phlet.
A short ride from the bustle
of El Camino to the quiet resi
dential Eastern school streets
(Yale, Princeton, Stanford of
the East ) begin the tour. The
first home is magnificent, it's

Amherst, owned by Stanford
Law Professor John Kaplan and
his wife Dorothy. The Queen
Anne style, scalloped shingles,
stained glass ornaments,
wisteria-hemmed porch and
hedge of high shrubbery bring
forth both a sense of privacy
and a hint of nostalgia. The
Kaplans have enthusiastically
brought about major renova
tions to their Victorian style
home which was originally
built for Walter Miller, a mem
ber of Stanford's first faculty.
"We think it's important to
restore houses that have his
torical significance and even
those that don't, to keep the
link with the past," John
Kaplan noted. When they
purchased the home six years
ago, they found that it had ob
viously undergone numerous
changes from its original form.
Various rooms, each equipped
with a heavy bolt type lock on
the door littered the upstairs of
the home, remnants of the
1920s when the Amherst home
was used to board Stanford stu

dents. Asbestos siding, popular
in the 19405, covered the entire
right half of the house. A cast
iron bannister framed the en
trance of the house; an apart
ment had been constructed
where the original porch
stood.
The Kaplans, however, have
taken pains to restore the
house very closely to its ori
ginal grace, using old pictures,
or clues from the house itself to
insure authenticity. When the
asbestos siding was removed,
the Kaplans discovered win
dow openings that had been
covered and fitted them with
custome made stain glass. And,
"We knew for a fact that the
cast iron bannister wasn't ori
ginal, so we had 52 of those
spindles 'turned' to match ex
actly the way they were when
the house was built." Dorothy
Kaplan said, as she explained
the original of a very new Vic
torian styled wooden bannister
at the entrance of the home.
Most of the other homes on
the tour retain their Victorian
facade but have lost much of
the "air" of the past. These are
a new breed of house —
hybrids of historical skeleton
and modern day advancement.
2130 Yale, for example obvious
ly possesses older architecture
— "shingles and slanted bay"
of the Victorian age and "col
umns of the colonial period."
The home today is painted yel
low with bright pink and blue
trim, much more colorful than
its Victorian ancestor. "No kid
ding! Our house is on the
tour?" exclaimed Denny Dahl,
a Stanford graduate student,
happily surprised to discover
the historical value of the
home he now rents. While the
exterior of the home hints of
1900s archictecture, the in
terior has been completely re
modeled and exhibits much of
the modern day life-styles.
The Historical Society, in its
pamphlet notes that it was built

by an English stone mason's
colleagues for his bride. Dahl
had another version of the
house's origin, one a bit more
amusing. "This house was built
by an Italian immigrant and
when he went back to Italy to
find a wife, he hadn't put in the
fireplace yet. So, his friends de
cided to build one as-a surprise
for the wife." What the friends
installed was a bizarre beige
stone structure, a lot like a de
formed log cabin. "We were
wondering if it was so ugly that
it scared his wife back to Italy!
And, I don't know if you can
see them, but look at the squir
rels," Dahl laughed as he
pointed out the ornamental ro
dents carved into the side of
the mantle. Part of the fun of
living in a home built so long
ago, according to Dahl, is dis
covering some of the renova
tions which have occurred in
previous years. The Yale home
originally had its entrance
where the side of the house
now stands and Dahl said that
he could tell that he was living
in a "really old house" because
of the discovery of an aged
China cabinet in his garage.
Likewise, the Kaplans found
the original fireplace mantle in
. their basement.
The residents of 519 Stan
ford, Jack and Margaret
Albrect found even more ma
jor changes. They deduced
from an uneven plastering job
on a wall that separated the
kitchen and dining rooms, that
a kitchen door had been cov
ered up. "We also noticed a
chimney, but when we came
inside, there was no fireplace!"
Margaret explained. The
chimney today is hidden in var
ious walls of the house, but if
one walks up to a bedroom
which once was the attic,
opens the closet door and
peers inside, the chimney,
bricks, mortar and all are still
there.
The original owner of the

house, the Mayfield railroad
stationmaster for 40 years,
clearly reminds everyone that
519 Stanford is a historical
house. He had his name
"Holston" stamped into the
concrete sidewalk that passes
in front of the house.
All of the above mentioned
homes were modernized as
well as well maintained. Each
obviously underwent much
renovation to bring it to its
present state. John Schaefer of
1487 College noted that when
his family moved into their
home, the plaster and lathe
walls were literally crumbling.
"Little chunks of the wall
would just fall out," said
Schaefer. New paint, sheet
rock and continuing improve
ments have made the "un
liable" (his son commented)
home a comfortable one. "We
still have a ways to go."

Schaefer concluded.
One predicament which
confronts many of these his
torical homes, is lack of main
tenance. The students who had
lived in the Schaefer home had
neglected them. Similarly, 2130
Yale and 591 Stanford were
found rather "beat up" by their
new owners free renovations.
These homes were the lucky
ones, as their decay was halted
by improvements. Others on
the College Terrace tour have
suffered harsher blows from
age and lack of maintenance.
1531 College described in the
Historical society's brochure as
"a small, richly ornamented
cottage in the queen Anne
style; its gable and bay details
are executed with great delica
cy ... " apparently a rental
unit, now is just a plain house in
need of some care. Its Victorian
mistique has been lost to neg
lect. The home on 610 Califor

nia has also forfeited its his
torical beauty to lack of atten
tion and the terse note posted
on the front door reads:
"Please do not disturb the ten
ants for information. Please
contact the realtor."
Many of the homes of the
College Terrace tour today are
indeed rental property. Some
are well kept, others not. It is
easy to see however, that as
time progresses, the signs of
the past fade slowly away.
There are not many Victorian
homes in the Palo Alto area —
many were destroyed in the
1906 earthquake so those that
are here now have exhibited a
certain resilience. A bit of his
tory may be hard to find amid
the modern homes, street signs
and effects of the 20th century.
College Terrace however, pro
vides a few lasting remnants of
turn of the century life.

FIT FOR ROYALTY — Located at 2275 Amherst/ this Vic
torian styled home marks the beginning of a historical tour

HOLSTON HOUSE — Named after its original owner, this home sits at 519 Stanford Ave
nue. The victim of a number of structural alterations, it now features a chimney hidden in
an upstairs bedroom closet.
