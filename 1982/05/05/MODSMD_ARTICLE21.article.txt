Costly bids
While students at Stanford go through
the process of fraternity rushing and bids,
students at Loyola University are having a
difficult time starting their chapter of the
Sigma Delta Chi, originally founded as an
honorary journalism fraternity. Accord
ing to The Loyola Phoenix the problem
seems to be the fee of $27.50, which fails
to attract overwhelming support from
communication majors for this endeavor.
The department, however, isanxiousto
have a chapter at Loyola and has even
provided funding for the student society.
Said Adviser Edmund Rooney, "I don't
think they (the students) realize how im
portant it is to make contacts. They are
missing out on many professional con
tacts in SDX." Suggested alternatives of
payment include an installment plan of $5
a week or even $5 a month, "just as long as
you join," added Rooney.
More than 173 chapters have been
founded all over the country at many uni
versities, including Northwestern, Mar
quette and Creighton. Contests are spon
sored by the society for national student
chapters and members are eligible for
low-cost insurance programs, as well as
attendance at the annual regional con
ferences and a national convention to be
held in Wisconsin this November.
Besides, membership dues are tax deduc
tible.
We shall overrun
More than 600 mice, all genetically dif
ferent but with the same skin color, were
apparently released from their cages one
night in the Medical School, reports The
Daily Pennsylvanian. The alleged sabo
tage ruined three years' of research for

post-doqtorate medical student Alicia
Dustira, who had been raising the mice
for use in her work on immunology. Her
research had applications in tumor re
search and skin-graft transplants.
Dustira claimed that "it was something
deliberate.. .The cage lids were de
liberately left half-off in the animal
room." Animal Colony Supervisor
Warren Allen, who oversees the men who
clean the animal cages, said his depart
ment recently had received a request to
clean the cages on a more regular basis.
But, he added, there was "no way" that
his men had anything to do with the al
leged sabotage of the experiment.
(Conservation Kops
Those charts and graphs in your dorm
or house depicting this year's use of
energy compared to last year's may or
may not produce results. But the follow
ing might (lightheartedly that is).
A team of energy-conscious students at
Penn State formed a comic vigilante force
which went around handing out citations
for good or bad energy habits in
classrooms and residence halls. Spon
sored by the University's Executive
Energy Conservation Committee, four
energetic theater majors patrol campus in
the garb of cops, issuing citations to in
crease conservation awareness. Reports
The Daily Collegian, the whole charade
serves an important purpose. The ironic
result, however, is the near-arrest of two
Konservation Kops themselves. The
charge: impersonating an officer.
Flying dogs, mad ducks
From the University of Southern Cali
fornia (USC) we hear a report of Arno, the
dog that tried to fly.. .and found out he

V
couldn't. The Daily Trojan writes that one
of the University Security's police dogs
leaped off the fourth and top floor of
Parking Structure B, breaking his right
foreleg.
"He tried to fly," explained Security
Chief Steven Ward. "He rode up (to the
top floor) in the car and we assume he
didn't know he was on the roof." When
the 2-foot-tall German shepard jumped
over the wall and landed in some ground
cover, the officers who rushed down
found him "up and ready to go," said
Ward. "They say he looked a little embar
rassed."
Elsewhere at another USC (University
of South Carolina), an April issue of
Gamecock headlines the story about a
ferocious duck. Authorities were unable
to apprehend the berserk fowl which
trapped thousands in the Thomas Cooper
Library and kiiieri four students.
"We usually handle stolen bikes, lost
wallets and opening and locking build
ings, not using our guns," said Security
Director Carl Stokes. "Some of our sauaa
is out of practice and have been unable to
shoot down the vicious little animal."
Experts said that the duck was probably
reacting at last to the mistreatment stu
dents had given it, possibly by feeding it
cafeteria food. But at any rate, the death
toll rose when eight officers, in trying to
shoot the mad duck, were fatally caught
in a cross-fire.
Oh, by the way, this last incident was re
ported on April 1.
Thinking about brawn
Science has almost gone overboard on
the physical examinations of the Univer
sity of Pennsylvania heavyweight crew

members. This year, reports Th* Daily
Pennsylvanian, virtually no part of their
bodies escaped scrutiny. "These test have
been exhaustiveln that they have allowed
a doctor of medicine, a psychiatrist and a
sports physiologist as well as a heart spe
cialist and an internist to study the
oarsmen," said Crew Coach Ted Nash.
The results of testing quadriceps,
hamstrings, blood composition, lung ca
t pacity, heart composition and a whole
' host of other things will be studied in
three different medical arenas.
According to Nash, each man is getting
$700 worth of testing free, because all the
doctors involved are also using the tests to
their own advantage.
Lookin' good
Beauty is not skin deep. You have to
photograph well, too, if you want to be
the cover of some month in the 1983
Looking Good: Men of USC and Women
of USC calendars. Entrepreneurs Greg
Farber and Nick Coicachis began this en
terprise last year, but look forward to
looking better this year with color photos.
The university bookstore sold 500
copies of the 1982 edition on the first day;
400 more were sold the second day. Since
then, reports the Daily Trojan, 3600 copies
have been sold in Southern California.
With an early start, Coicachis said they
will have professional photographs ana
the calendars will be marketed na
tionwide. Most of the members involved
in this venture graduated from the en
trepreneur program at USC's business
school. Farber said they contact people to
ask them: "Who's the best knock-out you
know?"
Coicachis added that the producers try
to get respondents to name only one per
son so that they are really naming who
they feel is the best looking person on
campus. The "fast buck" is not all they are
looking for; the producers of this project

also help by taking the photos to mod
elling agencies, thereby creating op
portunities for the participants, if not ca
reers.
Bud made it!
Quaff your beer, don't sip it. Drink it all
down, don't play with it. So urged Len
Anklowitz, owner of the Beverage Barn in
Princeton and acknowledged professor
of beer, during the First Annual Daily
Princetonian Beer-Tasting.
The newspaper reports that huddled
behind shabby news desks, represent
atives from eight eating clubs and The
Daily Princetonian sampled eight beers,
ales and malt liquors from plastic cups
numbered one through eight.
On a scale of A-plus to F-minus, volun
teers graded Heineken,Coors, Michelob,
Canadian Ace, Old English 800 Malt Liq
uor, Miller, Black Horse Ale and Utica
Club Light.
The taste buds went for The Bud over
the more expensive beers, showing that a
higher price doesn't always mean a bet
ter-tasting beer.
After tasting Heineken from cup
number two, Dan Baxter, ex-social chair
man of Terrace Club, commented that it
"smelts like Prince Oscar Sardines."
Heineken, the prestigious brew of the
label conscious, tied for second place
with Canadian Ace, imported from in
dustrial Hammonton, New Jersey.
Coors, at $4.39 a six-pack, was the most
expensive beer tested, receiving a C rat
ing. It tied with Miller, America's main
stay beer. Everyone recommended that
the last three beers — Old English 800,
Black Horse Ale, and Utica Club Light -~
should be dumped with the next batch of
toxic wastes. The criticism of Old English
ranged from:"It tastes like someone
dropped sugar in it — a kiddie beer,' to
'sweat sock soup."
