## Stanford, healthy again, rips Cal 
### Sid Spaeth 
Stanford ail but assured itself a No. 1 seeding for the first NCAA
Women's Tennis Tournament May 16 in Salt Lake City with a re
sounding 9-0 shutout of No. 11 California at the Varsity Courts yes
terday.
The win improved the Cardinal's umblemished mark to 15-0
and, coupled with USC's 7-2 win over No. 2 UCLA Friday, puts
Stanford well ahead of the Bruins going into the final dual be
tween the two teams here at 11 a.m. Saturday.
Stanford, playing at full strength for the first time since April 9,
rallied for three, three-set singles wins in beating an improved
Bear team in a match that was much closer than it appeared.
"This match came at the perfect time," Stanford coach Frank
Brennan said. "Practices have been getting kind of lackadaisacal.
We needed a good match before UCLA and they really gave us
one. They were 100 percent better than last time. We didn't lose a
set last time — it was routine."
Elise Burgin, the nation's No. 1 rated player, fell into a routine of
her own dropping two straight matches after an 8-0 start. Burgin
split her first two sets against Cal's Nina bland and was having fits
with Blands slow, methodical and bland (no pun intended)
baseline game. The score was tied 1-1 games and 3-3 points in the
third set when Burgin got in a heated argument with the umpire.
After Bland's first serve, Burgin called time out because a ball
was rolling onto the court. The umpire said he had called time
during Bland's first serve and awarded her two serves.
"It was just one of those stupid things," Brennan explained.
"She (Burgin) knew when she had called time and couldn't un
derstand why the umpire was giving her (Bland) two serves. She
was just so mad that she began cracking the ball all over the place
— I've been trying to get her to do that for a month. She just
opened up her game and won big."

Burgin won the remaining games easily cruising to a 6-4,4-6,6-1
win at No. 2 singles.
Michelle Weiss and Alycia Moulton also got tangled up in
three-set affairs after dropping their first sets.
Moulton lost a first-set tiebreaker to Barrie Bulmore and was in
trouble in a second-set tiebreaker falling behind 1-3 after three
unforced forehand errors. After rifling a forehand past Bullmore's
forehand, a mishit volley and two overhead winners, Moulton
crawled back to tie at four-all.
The players traded two more points before Moulton slammed
away two overheads to claim the second set tiebreaker 8-6.
The match continued to be close in the third set, but Moulton
averted a tiebreaker by holding serve at four-all and breaking
Bulmore for a 6-7,7-6,6-4 win at No. 1 singles.
Weiss stormed out to a 3-1 lead in her third set against Stacey
Savides and was serving at 2-0 when her game began to falter.
Savides came back to break serve and the players traded games
until at 5-4, Weiss used a little luck to sew up the win. At 2-2,
Savides double faulted to go to match point and on Savides sec
ond serve, Weiss drilled a forehand return that ticked the net cord
and dribbled over to give her a 4-6,6-3,6-4 win at No. 5.
Kate Gompert continued to show little mercy after returning
from a sprained ankle last week and ripped Vickie Corrales 6-2,
6-1. Linda Gates eased past Julie Grummel 6-2, 6-4 and Caryn
Copeland used less than an hour to defeat Wendy Driver 6-1,6-3.
Copeland and Moulton returned to the No. 1 doubles spot after
six weeks at No. 2 and the defending Al AW champions responded
with a 6-3,6-3 win over Breed and Grummel.
Brennan rested his No. 2 team of Gates and Burgin, but Gom
pert and Weiss stepped up to blast Bulmore and Corrales 6-3,6-0.
Gayle Chan and Sue Rasmussen edged Bland and Hanah Somer
ville 7-6,6-3 at No. 3.
