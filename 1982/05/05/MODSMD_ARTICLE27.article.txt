# Golfers fading

The men's golf team has its
work cut out for tomorrow's
fourth and final round of the
Pac-10 championships at Ore
gon's Corvallis Country Club.
The Card is in fifth place after
54 holes with a team total of
1,106 on the par-71, 5,769 yard
course. UCLA sits atop the pack
at four under par 1,061, a com
fortable 24 stroke cushion over
second-place USC. Host Ore
gon (1,098) is third and Arizona
State (1,091) fourth.
As the unusually low scores
indicate, play has been ex
tremely competitive in Cor
vallis. Although the Card may
very well be playing its best golf
of the season, its overall team
standing has not changed.
For Stanford to have a re
alistic hope of being selected
for the NCAA championships
May 24-29 in North Carolina,
they must finish at least third,
ahead of Oregon, Arizona, and
Arizona State.
Translated into numbers, the
Card must make up a 15 stroke
difference between itself and
Oregon â€” no easy task over
just 18 holes. Stanford golfers
must lower their stroke aver
age from 73.7 to 70 or 71 tomor
row.
After 36 holes, David Games
headed the Stanford linksters
with a 142, three shots better
than teammate Doug Thomp

son. Scott Erickson tallied 147,
Josh Mondry 150 and Lew
Dickey and Jim Scanlon had
151s.
After three rounds, UCLA
owns the top three spots in the
individual competition. Corey
Pavin fired a 10 under par 203,
while Jeff Johnson and Jay Defs
ing each had 210s.
Over the weekend, the Stan
ford men's golf team disap
pointingly took 13th in the
three-round Sun Devil Classic
at Scottsdale, Ariz. Stanford fin
ished with an aggregate 1,131,
53 strokes off BYU's winning
pace.
Lew Dickey and Josh Mon
dry led Card golfers with a pair
of 223's over the par-72 Mc-
Cormick Ranch Golf Course.
David Games fired a 225 and
Scott Erickson a 230. Doug
Thompson hit a first round 71,
but followed it with an 80 and
an 83 for a 234 total. John
Scanlon had a 54-hole score
three strokes behind Thomp
son's.
After shooting a sterling 363
over the first 18 holes, the Card
fired a 379 on the second day
and a 389 on the third.
BYU, who won the NCAA
championship last year at Stan
ford, held off a late-charging
UCLA and finished with a two
under-par 1,078. UCLA was six
shots back at 1,084, followed by
host Arizona State (1,090),
Weber State (1,096), USC
(1.098) and San Diego State
(1.099).
San Jose State placed sev
enth, powered by Kurt de
Varona's six under par 210
(70-68-72). The SJS golfer tied
with Weber State's Storm
Gleim (69-73-68) and San Diego
State's Scott Williams
(69-72-69). Gleim won the
three-way 'All-State'playoff on
the second hole.
