### Tirra Austin 
Last weekend the Stanford
women's lacrosse team won
the California Championships
for the second year in a row.
The team beat second place
finisher Long Beach twice and
other tournament victories in
cluded Berkeley and Santa
Barbara.
Stanford placed 11 players
on the California all-star team
â€” the most of any team in the
tournament.
The team finishes the year
with a 15-1 record, the only de
feat coming in a 7-6 loss to Can
ada. The club traveled to Van
couver, British Columbia the

weekend of April 24 to take on
the select provincial British Co
lumbian team, many of whose
players will represent Canada's
national team in international
play. The more experienced
Stanford team outplayed the
aggressive, well conditioned
Canadians with calm team-ori
ented play to win two-of-three

games played in Vancouver's
Stanly Park.
First year coach Janet Luce
praised the clubs play, com
menting that the team had
reached its goal of playing its
season best at the Santa
Barbara tournament last week
end.
