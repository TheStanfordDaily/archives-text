# Col. Majano implicates D'Aubuisson in killing
## 
### Clay Moltz 
In a press conference before his public address
in the History Corner, Col. Adolfo Majano said he
has information that implicates Roberto
D'Aubuisson, recently-elected El Salvadoran con
stituent assembly president, in the March 1980 as
sassination of Roman Catholic Archbishop Oscar
Romero.
Majano told reporters that there is "concrete ev
idence" of the rightist D'Aubuisson's involvement
in the shooting. "My impression is that he is in
volved," Majano stated, "but I don't think he was
the only one."
While serving in the junta Majano had then-
Army Major D'Abuisson arrested. Various docu
ments were seized in the arrest which he said con
firmed his role in at least the planning of this and
other terrorist activities.
However, D'Aubuisson's influential friends in
the government had him released and later played
a role in ousting Majano from the ruling junta. Ma
jano was arrested in December 1980 after he nar
rowly escaped an assassination attempt and he was
subsequently exiled from his country.
The silence of the El Salvadoran government on

Romero's death, Majano said, showed that other
people in high places were also implicated. "It was
forces within the government itself that opposed
an investigation and put put obstacles in its path,'
he said, noting that these same forces still oppose a
negotiated political settlement in the country.
The coup that boosted Majano to power in 1979
was in part an attempt by junior military officers to
clean out the ranks of the army and end the
atrocities which had been associated with joint op
erations with Salvadoran security forces.
Political Science Prof. Richard Fagen told the
Daily that Majano, a young career officer, jumped
from his position as vice-director of the Salvadoran
military academy to the ruling junta because of his
"clean record" and reputation as a liberal.
Majano said that within the military there is a
small corrupt sector that has carried out atrocities,
but there is also a "strong current which is liberal
and open in perspective." He said that the younger
officer corps does not share the repressive and
anti-reform mentality of the present government
and older officers.
Some observers have speculated recently that
Majano, an influential soldier and ex-official,

might act as mediator in a settlement to end the
civil war.
Unlike the present D'Aubuisson government
which rejects a negotiated settlement with the left,
Majano said "It is essential that all political tenden
cies in El Salvador should get together and resolve
the crisis." Majano recently went to Venezuela to
discuss possibilities for a coalition among centrist
Salvadoran parties.
Majano yesterday deplored the present abuse of
the armed forces and said that the military
oligarchy in El Salvador was destroying the army's
integrity. He said the army now acts like "a bull in a
china shop, destroying everything." U.S. military
aid, boosted under the Reagan administration, he
said, "is like giving this bull more food."
Without a rearranged political order there is no
possibility for a political settlement, Majano said.
He argued that polarization must be overcome
and a stable center rebuilt. One of the the failures
of the recent elections, he said, was "that no effort
was made to break down the polarization and
create a broad center."
