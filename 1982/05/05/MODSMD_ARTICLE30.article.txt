# Women charge to NCAA's
## 
### Mark Zeigler 
Turning in its best per
formance this season, the
women's golf team virtually as
sured itself a berth in the first
ever NCAA Championships to
be held at Stanford May 26-29.
The Card placed an im
pressive fourth in a field of the
country's best golf teams at the
Southern Intercollegiate in
Athens, Ga., this weekend. "It
proved that we are one of the
stronger teams in the country,"
coach Tim Baldwin said. "We
can play in the top ten."
Pacing the attack waÂ£
freshman Diane Nixon, who
fired a 234 (79-79-76), good
enough for 10th in the individ
ual competition.
Stanford tied with Florida at
944, behind host Georgia, Flor
ida State and winner Tulsa. The
Golden Hurricane equalled
the course and tournament
record with a scorching 912.
Three Tulsa golfers placed in
the top ten.
"Tulsa right now is playing as
good as any college team has
ever played," Baldwin com

mented.
San Jose State's Julie Inkster
won the individual competi
tion with a five over-par 221.
Her team shot an aggregate 947
and should also be on hand for
the NCAAs.
Joanne Pacillo finished four
strokes behind Nixon, includ
ing an opening day 77. Kathy
Nino shot 239, while Lori
Castillo checked in at 241, fol
lowing a disasterous first round
89. Debbie Barberio shot 245.
The field mostly consisted of
eastern golf powers in what
amounted to a preview of the
NCAAs. Baldwin sees both
Tulsa and Florida as legitimate
challengers for the title later
this month.
The Card is undoubtedly on
top of its game right now, after
winning a three-way meet two
weeks ago and finishing fourth
in such a prestigious event as
the Southern Intercollegiate.
"I definitely see us getting
better," Baldwin said. "Our
backs were against the wall as
far as qualifying for the
NCAAs."

The defending champion Stanford Cardinal travels to Berkeley today in a last-ditch ef
fort to quajify for the NCAA Tournament May 15 in Athens, Geor. If Stanford wins, the
Cardinal will qualify for the tournament, but, tney will probably be eliminated if the team
loses.
