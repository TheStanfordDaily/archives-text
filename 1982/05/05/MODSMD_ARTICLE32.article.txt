## Stanford bids for Super Bowl XIX 
### 
Don't get your hopes up yet, but its possible that Super
Bowl XIX will be played at Stanford Stadium. The key word
here is possible because nothing definite has been worked
out yet.
Stanford Sports Information Director Bob Rose told the
Daily yesterdaythat Geiger and several San Fransisco city of
ficials talked with the N.F.L. about the possibility of bringing
the Super Bowl to the Bay Area.
Officials from San Fransisco want to bring the Super Bowl
to the Bay Area, and because of its seating capacity, Stanford
Stadium would be the obvious place to have it. According
to Rose, San Francisco officials initiated this action.
Although there are many advantages to holding the Su
per Bowl at Stanford — good weather, plenty of hotel ac
commadations (especially when you include San Jose and
San Francisco), and a large stadium — problems still exist.
The most publicized is Stanford Stadium's tax status which
could be put in jeopardy. Rose, however, thinks that the
problem can be overcome.
"The Santa Clara County Supervisor has gone on record
saying that this could be worked out," Rose said.
The most obvious reason why they would want to work
out a deal with Stanford would be the large amount of mon
ey and additional tax revenue that this could mean for the
county.
Stanford Athletic Director Andy Geiger put the issue in
perspective. When asked what progress has been made so
far, he responded, "Everything is still preliminary."
