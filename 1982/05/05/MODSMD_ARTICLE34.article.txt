First year edition
Fresh ideas combined with out
standing talent could make this year's
first year staffers edition a spectacular
success. The only problem: locating
these ingredients. If you have both,
or one, or neither, of these ingre
dients, but have enthusiasm and a
desire to learn see Mike Thurman,
who will be leading this brave, group.
Softball time
Its that time again, the moment
we've all been waiting for. The re
match that they said couldn't hap
pen, with an array of stars that no one
thought could be assembled on the
same field at the same time playing
the same game, is taking place this
Saturday at 11 a.m. at Roble Field.
Those nasty professional journal
ism fellows have the audacity to
challenge Daily staffers to yet anoth
er Softball game. All staffers are in
vited to participate in what some ana
lysts have called the rematch of the
century.
This contest not only involves the
softball supremacy of the Daily it gets
into a much broader ideologically
conflict, kind of an us against them
battle. So show up and help prove
that our system (vdt?) is better. After
all, here at the Daily softball isnt't just
a game it's our life.
