# Survey will assess course evaluations

### Bill Beyda 
The Faculty Senate Sub-Commit
tee on the Evaluation and Improve
ment of Teaching (SC-EIT) is dis
tributing a questionnaire and con
ducting interviews with faculty mem
bers this week in order to assess the
effectiveness of the SC-EIT/ASSU
Course Guide computerized course
evaluation form.
The questionnaires will be sent to
about 20 percent of the students, as
well as to faculty members in the
schools of Humanities and Sciences,
Education and Earth Sciences, which
currently use the 3C-EIT/ASSU
Course Guide form for faculty eval
uation, according to SC-EIT member
and Education Prof. Nathaniel Gage.
Gage is directing the effort to survey
members of the Stanford community
on the evaluation forms. In addition,
department heads in the three
schools will be interviewed to find
out "how they are using the results of
the evaluations," Gage said.
"There are several possible uses for
the results of the evaluations," Gage
said, "It may be used for guiding de
cisions about faculty tenure, promo
tions, and salary and for the improve
ment of the quality of teaching. We

don't know how it's being used —
that's one of the reasons we're send
ing out these surveys and doing the
interviews."
"Departments have an obligation
to provide information about the
teaching effectiveness of their facul
ty," Registrar Sally Mahoney said,
"but there are a variety of methods
that can be used. These surveys will
help us determine how the (SC
EIT/ASSU Course Guide) forms are
being used by faculty and students."
"Much statistical analysis will be
done on the survey results," Gage
said, "to aid in our analysis of any
problems that may exist."
Neither Gage nor Mahoney would
speculate on what problems were
likely to come up in the survey re
sults.
The student survey centers on how
seriously — and fairly — students fill
out the SC-EIT/ASSU Course Guide
forms, the mechanics involved, how
large a role the course evaluations in
the ASSU Course Guide play in stu
dent course selection and what effect
the students think their evaluations
are having.
