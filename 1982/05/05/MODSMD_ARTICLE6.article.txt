# Congressional bill will restrict visas
## 
### Fred Shapiro Jonathan Greene 
Legislation that will require most
foreign students to return home for
two years after they graduate from
college is scheduled for final revision
before a Senate subcommittee
tomorrow.
Section 212 of the proposed Immi
gration Reform and Control Act
would require foreign nationals with
a student (type F) or type M visa to re
turn home for a period of two years
before applying for permanent resi
dent status, an immigrant visa, or a
non-immigrant (H or L type) visa.
Section 212 would only apply to
those foreign students who apply for
visasafter the law is parsed.
Harris Miller, a staff member of the
House Subcommitte on Immigra
tion, Refugees and International
Law, said yesterday that the purpose
of the F visa is to allow students to
study at U.S. schools and then "to
take the knowledge back to their
homeland. He added that there are
about 300,000 foreign students in the
United States and that, according to
the Dept. of Labor, one in three re
main after graduation.
By applying for the F visa with the
intention of staying, foreign students
"are breaking an implicit agree
ment," Miller said. He stressed that
many students stay illegally by means
of "questionable marriages" or
"questionable jobs."
Arnold Liebowitz, staff member of
the Senate Subcommittee on Immi
gration and Refugee Policy, con
firmed that there "is a good deal of
visa abuse." He said that "there has
been considerable reaction" to the
bill and he expected "some softening
of the legislation" before it passes.
According to Lee Zeigler, director
of Bechtel International Center, the
legislation is "unduly restrictive as
there are lots of different categories
! and problems students might have."
112 Zeigler said that 1483 Stanford gradu
ate students and 256 undergraduates
are foreign nationals. They account
for 28.4 percent of the enrollment in
' the School of Engineering, where
they are most heavily concentrated,
10.9 percent of the Scnool of Human
ities and Sciences and 20 percent of
the Business School.
Richard Reiss, director for Engi
neering and Sciences at the Career
Planning and Placement Center, said
each year he helps about 60 foreign
engineering students who are seek
ing jobs.
"My guess is that about half to 60
percent of these end up getting jobs
and stay in the country," Reiss said.

He noted that the majority of foreign
students "have always planned to re
turn" home.
"The law probably wouldn't affect
a whole bunch of students," Reiss
said. "It's not insignificant, but won't
affect a horrendous number."
Robert Rosenzweig, vice-presi
dent for public affairs, said that Stan
ford had not yet examined the bill.
Industries that hire foreign stu
dents are scrambling to make Con
gress aware of their opposition to the
bill. Liebowitz said he has heard from
Proctor and Gamble, Exxon Research
and Schlumberger, among others.
John Calhoun, head of govern
ment affairs for Intel, a major Silicon
Valley electronics firm, said Section
212 would worsen the "overall short
age of engineers," disadvantaging
U.S. firms relative to their Japanese
competitors. Thirty percent of Intel's
recruits are foreign nationals. He also
noted that Intel might have to move
more of its technical operations ov
erseas.
The American Electronics Associa
tion (AEA), a trade organization, is
"very concerned about this legisla
tion," Pat Hubbard, Vice President
for Engineering Education, said.
Noting that there are currently
2500 open engineering faculty posi
tions in the United States, Hubbard
pointed out that the shortage of en
gineering instructors may be
worsened. "Twenty-four percent of
junior engineering faculty in ac
credited institutions received their
BS degrees from other than U.S. uni
versities," Hubbard said.
The AEA anticipates the bill will
come before the House in June.
However, a spokesman for the Na
tional Association for Foreign Stu
dent Affairs said that because of Con
gress's preoccupation with the
budget this session it is unlikely that
the bill will be passed by the House.
He expected that the bill will be rein
troduced in the next session.
The Institute of Electrical and Elec
tronics Engineers (lEEE), a pro
fessional organization, "is for in
creased enforcement" to prevent
visa abuse, according to a spokes
man. But it is "against blanket cate
gorizing" and favors a case by case
basis for appoval of visas.
Richard Gowan, chairman of the
lEEE Manpower Task Force, has ex
pressed concern that foreign pro
fessionals may currently be at a disad
vantage and work for less than com
petitive salaries.

dents are scrambling to make Con
gress aware of their opposition to the
bill. Liebowitz said he has heard from
Proctor and Gamble, Exxon Research
and Schlumberger, among others.
John Calhoun, head of govern
ment affairs for Intel, a major Silicon
Valley electronics firm, said Section
212 would worsen the "overall short
age of engineers," disadvantaging
U.S. firms relative to their Japanese
competitors. Thirty percent of Intel's
recruits are foreign nationals. He also
noted that Intel might have to move
more of its technical operations ov
erseas.
The American Electronics Associa
tion (AEA), a trade organization, is
"very concerned about this legisla
tion," Pat Hubbard, Vice President
for Engineering Education, said.
Noting that there are currently
2500 open engineering faculty posi
tions in the United States, Hubbard
pointed out that the shortage of en
gineering instructors may be
worsened. "Twenty-four percent of
junior engineering faculty in ac
credited institutions received their
BS degrees from other than U.S. uni
versities," Hubbard said.
The AEA anticipates the bill will
come before the House in June.
However, a spokesman for the Na
tional Association for Foreign Stu
dent Affairs said that because of Con
gress's preoccupation with the
budget this session it is unlikely that
the bill will be passed by the House.
He expected that the bill will be rein
troduced in the next session.
The Institute of Electrical and Elec
tronics Engineers (lEEE), a pro
fessional organization, "is for in
creased enforcement" to prevent
visa abuse, according to a spokes
man. But it is "against blanket cate
gorizing" and favors a case by case
basis for appoval of visas.
Richard Gowan, chairman of the
lEEE Manpower Task Force, has ex
pressed concern that foreign pro
fessionals may currently be at a disad
vantage and work for less than com
petitive salaries.
