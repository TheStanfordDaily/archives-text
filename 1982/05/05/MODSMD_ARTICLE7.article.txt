# Exiled Salvadoran denounces recent election
## 
### Clay Moltz 
Exiled Salvadoran junta member Col. Adolfo
Majano told an audience of 50 people yesterday
that the results of the recent elections in El
Salvador will increase political strife in El Salvador
without dealing with the underlying socio-eco
nomic inequities that form the root of the present
crisis.
He called the leading elected party ARENA (Na
tionalist Republican Alliance) "the most violent
party" in El Salvador.
The turbulent political conditions, he said,
created elections which "legitimized specifically
those people who are responsible for the crimes
and atrocities" in his country.
Majano, who served in the ruling junta formed
by reform-minded junior officers after a October
1979 coup, argued that the elections were
fraudulent because they took place in a political
atmosphere "fraught with conflict and violence--
to the point that only those parties with security
forces could conduct a viable political campaign.
The centrist parties had no possibility of expressing
themselves."
The right-wing coalition ARENA, Majano said,

distributed election materials in rural and leftist
leaning areas from helicopters and troop carriers.
The center's failure in the elections he said was due
to those parties' inability to match this campaign,
adding that ARENA "really has an army of its own."
The history of the present crisis figured centrally
in Majano's presentation, which traced decades of
governments dominated by a wealthy oligarchy
which consolidated its power through legislation
in the 1800's which stripped land from native
Salvadoran peasants for the formation of coffee
plantations. The socio-economic inequities and
situation of poverty among the people today, he
said, have resulted in the "total demoralization of
the people."
Majano blamed the centrists' failure in large part
on the government of Jose Napoleon Duarte gov
ernment, which he said posed as a moderate gov
ernment while pitting the left and right against
each other for its own political benefit. Duarte
forced out other moderates and "essentially dis
placed anyone who could function as a viable po
litical rival," he said.
The result was a militarized and polarized elec
tion contest rejected by the left, whose leaders did

not trust the Duarte regime to allow campaigning
without repression. The winner was the militarized
right, Majano said, "the people who have his
torically opposed economic reform, agricultural
reform, and who are responsible for most of the
political violence."
The hope for the future of El Salvador, he said,
lies in the possibility of a new centrist coalition to
bring an end to the violence and the establishment
of actual condition? of democracy.
Majano argued that the U.S. government, by fa
voring the ruling oligarchy, has exacerbated
Salvadoran civil strife. "He (Reagan) could be very
helpful if he would take a neutral and impartial
stand," Majano said, adding that the United States
should not "meddle in the internal affairs of my
country."
The involvement of the Mexican government,
however, Majano supported as a potential mid
point between the Salvadoran and U.S. govern
ments. He said that he foresees a "positive role"
for Mexico aiding a negotiated settlement. An
swering a question about a possible Cuban role, he
argued that it could be a negotiating party only on
regional issues.
