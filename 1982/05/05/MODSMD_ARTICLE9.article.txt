# Government wiretapping is on upswing

### Los Angeles Times 
Washington — Wiretapping and bug
ging by federal agents increased by 30.9
percent in 1981, resulting chiefly from
racketeering and narcotics investigations,
the Administrative Office of U.S. Courts
reported Monday.
However, state wiretapping, roughly
four times as frequent as federal, occurred
at the same rate as in the previous year,
making the overall increase above 1980
only 4.1 percent. In all, federal and state
: judges granted 589 applications to install
telephone wiretaps and bugs, or micro
phone devices.

Costs for installing and monitoring wire
taps rose 26.5 percent in 1981, averaging
$21,686 an installation, which is more than
three times the 1975 average outlay, the
annual federal analysis said. This works out
to an annual cost of about $12 million.
The highest reported cost of a single in
vestigation was incurred by a federal wire
tap and microphone eavesdrop in
Northern Illinois that ran $428,444. The in
stallation, which was used in a racketeer
ing investigation, operated 214 days.
The report said that wiretapping and
bugging in 1981 led to arrests of 1,735 per
sons. Of those, 248 defendants, or 14.3 Der

cent, were convicted. The figures are in
complete because many of the criminal
cases that relied one electronic sur
veillance in 1981 are still under active in
vestigation, the administrative office said.
Measured by arrests and convictions,
the most successful wiretap — in Dade
County, Florida — resulted in 70 arrests,
three trials and 65 convictions.
The number of persons whose conversa
tions were overheard averaged 84 for each
installed device, the report said, and the
total conversations intercepted averaged
848.
