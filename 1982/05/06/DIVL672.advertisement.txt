How to
do well in
Economy Class
Simple. Fly Capitol Air's Economy Class. Our
fares are the lowest of any scheduled airline so
you can use the money you save for lots of
other things. Like a Eurail pass if you fly us to
Brussels, Frankfurt or Zurich. More time in the
sun if you're headed for Miami, San Juan or
Puerto Plata. Or for even more fun in New Vbrk,
Los Angeles, San Francisco, Chicago or Boston.
And, if you are flying to Europe this summei;
make your reservation and buy your ticket
now. With our guaranteed fare policy you are
protected against any fare increases from now
until departure.
So if you want to do well in Economy Class
fly Capitol's.
For reservations, call your Travel Agent or
Capitol at 213-986-8445.
No one makes Economy Class
as economical as we do.
