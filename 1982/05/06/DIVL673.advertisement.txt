Thinking about El Salvador, 1982
Because every day they chop heads off
I'm silent * \ t \
In each person's head they chopped off
was a tongue,
for each tongue they silence
r a word in my mouth
unsays itself.
From each person's head two eyes
looked at the world;
for each gaze they cut
a line of seeing unwords itself.
Because evcty day they chop heads off
slows into language,
think themselves worthless.
No blade of machete
threatens my neck,
but its muscles
cringe and tighten,
my voice
hides in its throat-cave
ashamed to sound
into that silence,
Pthe silence "•
of raped women,
of priests and peasants, / H
teachers and children,
of all whose heads every day _ rfx
float down the river
and rot
and sink, ,
not Orpheus heads
still singing, bound for the sea,
but mute.
