# University locals voice opinions on possible Falkland settlement
## 
### Mike Thurman Douglas Jehl 
John Wirth, professor of history
and director of the Center for Latin
American Studies, told the Daily yes
terday that it is time to get the dispute
over the Falkland Islands "settled
right now" but that a diplomatic suc
cess would depend largely upon the
Argentines.
And History Prof. Richard Morse,
also a Latin American expert, said iast
night, "I wouldn't be surprised to see
both countries coming to terms
soon."
Their comments came in the wake
of reports that the United States and
Peru are seeking to impose a plan
that would resolve the South Atlantic
crisis. The Daily polled them and two
other scholars for their views on the
situation in the Falklands.
Secretary of State Alexander Haig
and Peruvian President Fernando
Belaunde are currently collaborating
to bring about a 72-hour cease fire as
the first stage of the plan, the Wash
ington Post reported yesterday. The
Post also reported that Britain has
characterized the need for a diplo
matic solution as urgent and that Ar
gentina has signalled that it is willing
to explore the matter further. But the
story also quoted sources who called
the plan a long shot.
Before the story was released,
Wirth told the Daily that the most
promising settlement would be the
Peruvian initiative.
"Right now would be an excellent
time for negotiations," Wirth said.
"Each side has lost a ship, and both
have stood up for their principles."
He said that both sides could step
back and negotiate without losing

pride.
Morse said, "I think the shooting
may be over tomorrow."
According to Morse, the economic
costs for both countries as well as re
cent allied criticism of Britain should
shorten the confrontation.
"I can't see (the two countries)
stomaching a long-term engagement
at this rate," Morse said.
Wirth said that Argentina's failure
to display any diplomatic strategy or
to respond to British overtures had
"put things out of phase," forcing the
British to undertake strong military
measures.
"It's a diplomatic conflict," Wirth
said. "Nobody wanted to see it be
come a military conflict."
"The question is: can they (the Ar
gentines) get their act together?"
Wirth said.
He said he expects the British to
continue their stronghanded ap
proach and possibly even land on
West Falkland if a settlement is not
reached in the near future.
Others in the University discussed
the nature of the conflict to date and
explained the role of the United
States as a mediating country.
Gerry Marks, a British grad student
in political science, said he felt that
there would be no British aggression
if the Argentines would sit down and
negotiate.
"They have a maximal position
from which they don't want to re
treat," Marks said. "Not only did they
invade the islands, but they don't
want to negotiate about it afterwards.
"It's pretty obvious that Britain is
going to compromise, maybe is even
going to compromise fundamentally

on the question of sovereignty. But in
terms of the moral issue of sovereign
ty, it's by no means clear that sov
ereignty lies with the Argentines."
He said that in terms of the dis
covery and previous claims, the claim
of the British is stronger.
"Only the argument of geography
is strong on the Argentine side,"
Marks said.
Marks said that the conflict is not a
case of British imperialism, or "op
pression of the people," as charged
by some Argentine allies. "In fact, the
reverse is the case."
Assoc. History Prof. Barton Berns
tein, who condemned the war as
"unnecessary and lamentable" said
that the American government
should not have taken sides at all, but
should have continued trying to me
diate the situation.
"But it is quite clear," Bernstein
said, "given the importance of NATO
and given the fact jhat the Thatcher
government has been the most pow
erful supporter for the Reagan/Haig
aggressive policies in Europe that
Reagan and Haig felt that they had no
other alternative than to support the
Thatcher government in the crisis."
Regarding the blockade and even
tual use of force by the British, Marks
said that the British were hoping to
pressure Argentina militarily into
making diplomatic compromises.
"What the Thatcher governmentt
was trying to do was trying to in
crease the costs over the short term
for the Argentinean government,"
he said, "and that necessitated quite
drastic steps."
