## Editorial Financial aid on merit 
### 
In the wake of the Reagan administration's
short-sighted efforts to sharply curtail federal
financial aid, Harvard University President
Derek Bok last week put forth a sound
contingency proposal to ensure that students
most likely to complete college will be most
likely to continue receiving aid.
The Bok proposal, contained in his annual
report, suggests that high school grades and
standardized test scores be used to determine a
financial aid cutoff level, below which some
students would be ineligible for federal grants.
Already Bok's idea has met with vociferous
opposition from educators across the country,
many of whom believe that grades and test
scores can be valid indicators of a student's
potential. While there are problems with
judging academic potential on the basis of
grades and test scores, when there must be an
aid decision between students of comparable
economic backgrounds, merit, however
defined, can be a useful way of deciding who
gets scarce funds.
Ideally, there should be no cutbacks in federal
financial aid programs. If President Ronald

Reagan were truly concerned about this
country's future economic health, he surely
would recognize that college-educated
students represent one of the wisest economic
investments the federal government can make.
But, if aid can't be maintained at current
levels, then the student with the best chance of
academic success — given a choice between
two students with similar demonstrated
financial need — should be favored.
Grades and test scores are a starting point for
assessing merit once decisions of aid allotment
have to be made.
Bok's annual report quotes a study by a
Harvard Kennedy School of Government
professor, which found that students in the
lowest quarter of their high school class with a
combined SAT score of 700 or less have only a 30
percent chance of finishing college.
It is unfortunate that Reagan insists on
shrinking an already small pie. But since federal
grants are designed to serve a significant public
purpose, the students who can benefit from
them the best and show the most academic
promise deserve to be guaranteed aid.
