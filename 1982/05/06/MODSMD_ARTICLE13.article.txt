# Firing up for his biggest role, Ron takes last shot at Oscar
## 
### 
"All right, everybody, quiet on the
set. Lights, audio, camera, and ...
Roll 'em. You're on, Ron."
Ron: "And I can assure that no one
is more concerned about the possi
bility of a nuclear holocaust than In
_n
am.
Francfc Ford: "Pretty good, Ron,
but let's try it again and could you be
a little more fatherly this time? Think
serious, think concerned; don't nod
your head too much or people will
think that your nervous system is
going ... that's it. Hey, makeup!
How many times do I have to tell you,
no gray hair! Now get some Grecian
Formula on this guy and I mean now!
All right, let's go for another take...
Lights, audio, camera, and ..."
Buck: "Excuse me, Mr. Hoopla,
but..."
Francis Ford: "What is it? Don't
you know enough not to interrupt
me when I'm creating?"

Buck: "I'm sorry, Mr. Hoopla, but
I'm Buck Raker from the Enquirer
and I have a few questions ..."
Francis Ford: "Look, talk to the
president's press agent, that's what
he's there for."
Buck: "Don't you mean his press
secretary?"

We had Frank Sinatra,
Charlton Heston,
Bob Hope, but did we
get best musical, best
comedy, best drama?
Nancy was truly hurt
when she didn't even
get the nomination
for best costume.

Francisco Ford: "Agent, secretary,
what's the difference? Now get out of
my sight and stay off my set! Here we
go everybody, lights, audio, camera,
and ... roll 'em."
Buck: "Excuse me, Mr. Speakes,
but I'm Buck Raker from the Enquirer
and I have a few questions..."

Speakes: "I'll be glad to talk about
anything but foreign policy and eco
nomic policy — I'm tired of saying
the same things over and over."
Buck: "All right, then, could you
tell me if there's any truth to the
rumor that the president is making
his press conferences into a full
length movie?"
Speakes: "Look, Buck, you're typi
cal of the media industry. You think
news is news and movies are movies.
Here in the administration we have a
different point of view: media is me
dia. Get with the times — stop trying
to draw a line between news and en
tertainment media because it just
won't work.
We've been fighting old-fashioned
attitudes like yours for some time
now. Why, just a few months ago we
came out with a major production —
Let Poland Be Poland. We had plenty
of facts, but did we get nominated for
best documentary? We had the lead
ers of 14 major countries, but did a
single one of them get best support
ing actor? We had Frank Sinatra, Bob
Hope, Charlton Heston, but did we
get best musical, best comedy, best
drama? Nancy was truly hurt when
she didn't even get the nomination

for best costume.
Then we had Ron himself, who
wasn't even considered for best ac
tor. With all of our talent and effort
we didn't even get a single nomi
nation for an Academy Award, not
because we weren't good enough,
but just because the judges didn't
even consider that a media presenta
tion by the government might de
serve some awards. Needless to say,
we're trying to change that attitude.
So we've decided to make a full
length film: Ronald Reagan. The
man. The myth. There will be no way
that Hollywood £an ignore this one."
Buck: "So you would say that the
president is personally interested in
an Oscar?"
Speakes: "I sure would. He's got
the desk, the office, the symbols, the
attention, the money, the power, but
he just doesn't have that Oscar. No
actor's life is complete without it."
Buck: "Would you say that this is
Reagan's most demanding role, even

when compared to, say, Bedtime for
Bonzoi"
Speakes: "I sure would. You think
maybe it's easy, trying to convince
most of America that you're con
cerned about deficits when vour
budget has the largest deficit in the
history of the United States, trying -o
show that you're concerned about
the arms race when you're pushing
for a $1.6 trillion arms buildup, trying
to make people believe that you're
concerned about the little guy while
at the same time you rob from the
poor and give to the rich, trying to
convince people that the govern
ments that we support in Central
American respect human rights
when they really murder and torture
people every day?
I'm telling you that for Reagan to
convince people that he's a con
cerned, fair-minded, competent, in
formed and intelligent man requires
the greatest acting in the history of
film."

Buck: "I see what you mean.
Would you say that any one aspect of
the role is giving him the most dif
ficulty?"
Speakes: "Well, to be perfectly
frank, the 'informed and intelligent'
part is giving us a little trouble."
Buck: "How do you mean?"
Speakes: "Well, take a look for
yourself."
Ron: "... and this red line here is
what we have if my budget
passes ..."
Francis Ford: "No, no, no! Your
budget is the black lina,-Congress/vis
the red one. Scholarly,-think scholar
ly, intelligent, erudite!"
Ron: "Think what?"
Buck: "I see what you mean. If he
can pull this one off, he's sure got my
vote."
Ronald Reagan. The man. The
myth. Coming soon to a TV near you.
