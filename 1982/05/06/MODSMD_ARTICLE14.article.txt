## Comments on COIN loan Justified 
### 
I read with interest University Pres
ident Donald Kennedy's Viewpoint
(Daily, Apr, 30), in which a number of
comm'PTTTS""WT i re made concerning
my earlier letter letter regarding fac
ulty housing. I am glad Kennedy took
the time to read and reply to my let
ter and I did gain some insights into
the thinking behind the University's
housing policies from his reply.
I do feel that it is necessary to point
out that, since my rather lengthy ori
ginal letter to the Daily was edited,
some of my original points appeared
out of context, and subject to pos
sible misinterpretation. This is partic
ularly true of my discussion of the
COIN loan program, which was de
leted from the published letter, aside
from a concluding remark in which I
referred to the 25 percent maximum
overall loan rate.
The basic point I tried to make in
my discussion of COIN was that it
could either be a very good or a poor
financing vehicle, depending on the
type of property to which it is ap
plied. Under current interpretation
of the terms of this loan agreement,
which I have confirmed with officials
of the housing office, any improve
ments to a property which do not re
quire a construction permit will not
be taken into consideration when
the property is sold and a capital gain
is realized.
The clear implication of this fact is
that the COIN loan will likely be a
poor choice for a "fixer-upper" type
of home, since the overall interest
paid may ultimately be very high,
perhaps the 25 percent loan limit. On
the other hand, the loan could cer
tainly work out very well when ap
plied to a property requiring little de
ferred maintenance, especially if the
purchaser doesn't expect to sell the
house for a good many years.
The second point I wished to make
is that I believe that the 25 percent
overall rate limit of the COIN loan
seems higher than it should be, corn

pared even to current extremely high
rates of 16 or 17 percent. I have read
the terms of the draft COIN Two loan
agreement and discussed the agree
ment with University housing of
ficials; I don't feel that my original

comments concerning the COIN
loan or the above discussion in any
way mischaracterizes the loan agree
ment.
