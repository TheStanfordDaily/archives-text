## Abortion: voice majority opinion 
### 
In 1973, the Supreme Court decided that a woman has
the right to either continue or terminate her pregnancy.
In other words, she can choose to have an abortion. To
day, some legislators are trying to take away this right. A
constitutional amendment, introduced by Sen. Orin
Hatch (R-Utah) is the first part of a strategy to make abor
tion a felony crime equal to murder. The Hatch Amend
ment says:
The right to abortion is not secured by this Constitu
tion. The Congress and the states shall have the concur
rent power to restrict and prohibit abortions: provided,
that a law of a State which is more restrictive than a law of
Congress shall govern.
This measure, which has also been called the "State's
Rights' bill, appears to give the decision to outlaw or
keep abortions legal to the states. But in effect it main
tains the power of the U.S. government. If a federal law is
passed which is more restrictive than the state's law con
cerning abortion, the federal law takes precedence over
the state law.
/
In effect, the federal government could outlaw abor
tion by passing a bill which requires a simple majority of
the House and Senate and the president's signature. (We
all know how difficult that will be).
Why is this happening when a recent Gallup Poll

showed that 70 percent of Americans are in favor of legal
abortion? If our Congress is supposed to represent the
people, then either the people are not communicating
with their legislators or the legislators are ignoring the
wishes of the people. A vocal minority, which for re
ligious or other reasons believes that abortion is murder,
is trying to impose their belief on all of us.
We respect their beliefs for their own lives, but we do
not want them to impose their values on us. When abor
tion is legal, everyone has the choice to do what they
personally feel is right about their pregnancies, even
those who believe abortion is wrong. But if abortion is
outlawed, there is no choice. The people who would
have chosen to have an abortion cannot. They can only
do what this vocal minority believes is right.
As we said before, the right to abortion is threatened.
If you care about keeping abortion legal, make your
voice heard. The Hatch Amendment is being debated
now on the senate floor and will soon be voted on.
Hopefully the majority of the population will be repre
sented and the Senate will vote down this amendment.
