Passing on words of wisdom and
suggestions for next year, ASSU sena
tors gave their final committee re
ports to the new members of the 13th
Senate, which convened for the first
time last night.
The committee chairmen met this
week with the new (13th Senate)
committee members and discussed
strengths and weaknesses of the
committees this year, as well as goals
for next year.
Finance Committee Chair Mark
Epstein noted that this year some ov
erlap existed in funding for student
groups — different organizations
sometimes agreed to provide money
to cover costs that have already been
covered.
The Finance Committee report
said that a proposed computer sys
tem, which both the University and
ASSU would use to identify financial
needs of student groups, could al
leviate that overlap.
Reporting for the Academic Affairs
Committee, Raga Elim named the
Faculty Day (held last fall on the Row)
as the big accomplishment of the
committee this year, and listed better
ASSU relations with University com
mittees, increased student-faculty in
teraction, and a study of the Academ
ic Organizations Board as goals for
next year.
The current task of the Student Af
fairs Committee is to assign new sen

ators to districts for next year, chair
Andy Benn said. The undergraduate
districts are arranged by living units
and the 15 districts are served by 36
senators, Council of Presidents mem
bers, and other interested ASSU of
ficials.
The report of the Rules Committee
noted as a possible goal for next year
making the various boards and bu
reaus fiscally responsive to the sen
ate.
Reporting for the Nominations
Commission, Sue Goldfarb said
currently 78 positions are available
for next year on more than 40 Univer
sity and ASSU committees, panels,
boards and commissions. She said
that 500 applications have been taken
out but only three have been re
turned and stressed the influence
and involvement students can have
on the various committees.
Introducing the new COP mem
bers to the senate, Chairman Rod
Beckstrom outlined the individual
priorities and areas of responsibility
for each of the members.
His priorities — projects to initiate
before school is out in June — are the
conversion of Encina Station into a
pizza parlor, food service reform,
and futher investigation into student
damages in residences.
Mark Epstein, who will share re
sponsibility for finances and boards
and bureaus with Cynthia
Mathewson, also places Encina Sta
tion on his priority list, Beckstrom

said, along with development of a
new Lakeside Recreation Center
(near Sterling Quadrangle), student
group rights and student damages.
Beckstrom said Mathewson is also
working on Encina Station and the
Lakeside Recreation Center. Yolanda
Townsend, who will be in charge of
University policies, is working on es
tablishing a state and national stu
dent lobbyist for Stanford, reviewing
minority affairs and setting up a grad
uate cabinet.
The last meeting of this year's sen
ate will be Tuesday, May 11, at which
