## Tug of war over Sweeney Ridge 
### Claire van Schaik 
Sweeney Ridge, a small natural area
in San Mateo County with historic and
scenic value, has become the center of
a national controversy between Con
gress and the Reagan administration
over how the national park system
should be managed.
In 1981 Congress appropriated $10
million to purchase the 1100-acre
Sweeney Ridge site as an addition to the
Golden Gate National Recreation Area
(GGNRA). The land would link the the
existing GGNRA to other public lands
along the crest of the San Francisco Pen
insula. However, Interior Secretary
James Watt is refusing to purchase the
privately-owned land.
According to an Interior Department
spokesman, Watt has nothing against
Sweeney Ridge, but has decided to
place a blanket moratorium on the
purchase of all new parklands, contend
ing that the government should use
available funds to maintain existing
parks rather than add acreage tothe sys
tem.
Watt's refusal to comply with a con
gressional mandate is backed by a Rea
gan administration proposal that would
virtually eliminate the $335 million Land
and Water Conservation Fund allocated
for federal acquisition of new public
lands in fiscal year 1982.
Leading the battle for Sweeney Ridge
in Congress are Rep. Pete McCloskey
(R-San Mateo) and Rep. Tom Lantos (D-
San Mateo). Like Watt, they realize the
financial significance of the purchase,
but unlike Watt, they believe that fail
ure to purchase Sweeney Ridge now is
financially unsound. According to Lan
tos, Watt's proposal is "penny-wise and
pound-foolish."
Up until February 15, 1982 an or
ganization called the Trust for Public
Land held an option for the purchase of
Sweeney Ridge for $9.6 million. This op
tion can be extended for two additional
years, but each extension involves a
substantial price increase. Thus, since
Watt failed to actually buy the land, the
purchase price for the Ridge went up by
$2 million last February, exceeding
Congress' appropriation of $10 million.
In a recent statement before the Ap
propriations Committee Subcommittee
on the Interior, Lantos said that in light

of the escalating price of land in the San
Francisco Bay Area it would be fiscally
irresponsible to deter this acquisition
for three or four more years. It could
then cost $15 or $20 million more
Environmental leader Olive Mayer
testified on behalf of the Loma Prieta
chapter at the recent congressional
hearing. She stated that the addition of
Sweeney Ridge to the national park sys
tem would integrate the 26,000 acres of
surrounding public parcels into a park
system of national importance.
"Walking along the 800 to 1200 foot
high Sweeney Ridge is like hiking the
moors of Scotland," Meyer told the
subcommittee. "The view is spec
tacular. The whole West Coast is spread
below you on one side, and the
gorgeous Crystal Springs Lakes and the
Bay is on the other side."

The Ridge also has historic signifi
cance. Known as the "Plymouth Rock
of the West" the Ridge was the site from
which a band of Spaniards first "dis
covered" San Francisco in 1769.
An additional factor is Sweeney
Ridge's proximity to a major urban area.
As the Trust for Public Land points out,
few sites in the country combine such
open space and beauty with easy access
to city dwellers.
Lantos stated before Congress that
"people in the cities are important and
entitled to have access to our national
treasures ... Our national parks must
not be so located that they are available
only to the affluent."
According to Lantos, the urban-ori
ented GGNRA receives 10 percent of
the total visitation of the entire national
park system.
