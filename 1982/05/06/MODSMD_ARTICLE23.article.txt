# Water initiative campaign garners 500,000 signatures

Because voters will be faced
with several major decisions
regarding the state's water
future this year, 1982 is being
called a "watershed year" for
California. Among the issues to
be resolved are the restructur
ing of the 1902 Reclamation
Act, a referendum on the Per
ipheral Canal and a court opin
ion affecting Mono Lake.
The most recent addition to
this crowded agenda of water
decisions is the Water Con
servation and Efficiency In
itiative, the purpose of which is
to promote greater efficiency
in the use of an estimated 5 mil
lion acre-feet of California's ex
isting water supply.
The initiative's sponsors at
the California Water Resources
Protection Council (CWRPC)
turned in a half million signa
tures on April 29 to try to put
the initiative on the November
ballot. Although the official
qualification process takes
about a month, the CWRPC is
confident that they obtained
the necessary 346,101 legal sig
natures.
Water use has traditionally
been a volatile political issue in
California. Argiculture places
by far the heaviest demand on
the state's water resources.
Presently, agriculture uses 85
percent of the developed wa
ter of the state and its demand
continues to increase. Because
of the limited nature of the
state's water resources, it has
become apparent that plan
ning for efficient use is essen
tial to the continued economic
development of the state.
If passed, the initiative could
radically alter the way water
use is planned in California.
The goal of the initiative is to
promote efficient water use in
three ways: by implementing
cost effective conservation and
reclamation alternatives
before the importation of

more of California's un
developed water supplies is
considered, by requiring that
groundwater management
plans be created to reduce or
eliminate overdraft problems,
and by ensuring that adequate
water remains in streams and
lakes to protect the wildlife and
the recreation and aesthetic
value of these waters.
The initiative would also lim
it water storage in the New
Melones Reservoir, located on
the already heavily dammed
Stanislaus River, to a moderate
level until the extra water is al
ready contracted for. Environ
mentalists and white-water raf
ting enthusiasts advocate this
provision as a way of preserv
ing the spectacularly beautiful
Stanislaus River Canyon and its
nine-mile stretch of white wa
ter.
However, opponents of the
initiative, most notably the
state's agricultural interests,
stress the need for New
Melones water for irrigation,
although contracts for the wa
ter have yet to be signed. Bill
Dubois, director of the Farm
Bureau Federation, explained,
"the New Melones water is ter
ribly important to farmers. If
they can't get water, food will
cost more; it's as simple as
that."
The water is also needed for
human consumption to en
hance the water quality in two
nearby counties, added
Michael Catino, regional direc
tor of the Midpacific Region of
the Bureau of Reclamation, the
federal agency responsible for
the New Melones project.
"Both the San Joaquin and
Stanislaus counties are hurting
because their groundwater
quality is bad," he said.
John Fraser, executive direc
tor of the Association of Cali
fornia Water Agencies, which
also opposes the initiative,
agreed that the need for New

Melones water is a real one,
and said "giving fish and wild
life priority over human con
sumption and agriculture is
very unwise."
But environmentalists insist
that the claims that New
Melones water is needed are
shaky. "Anyone who tells you
that your taps may run dry if we
don't develop more water is
either ignorant of the facts and
the law, or is attempting to mis
lead you," said David Abelson,
former director of the Planning
and Conservation League.
In the meantime, the reser
voir is half full and continuesto
be filled despite a court injunc
tion to keep the elevation to
844 feet. Catino claimed that
the continued filling of the res
ervoir in this year of ex
traordinarily heavy precipita
tion has averted $7 million
worth of flood damage to the
Delta.
Paul Nicholas, Santa Clara
County petition coordinator
for the initiative, admitted that
flood control was a problem,
but said "we aren't asking that
the filling of the reservoir be
halted, just that it be kept to a
moderate level."
Although the New Melones
is a big issue, it is not the only
controversial section of the in
itiative. The groundwater pro
vision, which requires that lo
cal agencies draw up
groundwater management
plans which are then subject to
approval by the State Water
Resources Control Board, is
also the focus of much debate.
John Fraser of the ACWA
said, "The groundwater plan is
unrealistic and poorly written.
It would take away the free
doms that local agencies now
enjoy and place the power in
the hands of a non-elected
body, the State Water Re
sources Control Board, giving
the board a virtual stranglehold
on the state's groundwater."
