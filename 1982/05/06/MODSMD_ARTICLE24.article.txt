# A 						health awareness day—guaging fitness and shaping up
## 
### Karen Springen 
The third annual Health Awareness Day
kicked off with a Health Faire in White
Plaza yesterday.
From 10 a.m. to 3 p.m., students in the
Optimal Health and Fitness class manned
booths on leading a healthy life.
Sections included a six-exercise station
fitness assessment trailer; a Medical Cen
ter display on heart disease and lung
cancer; information booths on heart and
lung disease (which featured a diseased
heart and lung), stress management, ex
ercise, cancer prevention, contraception,
and nutrition; measurement of body fat
and cardiorespiratory fitness; and an
assessment of blood pressure and heart
rate performed by representatives of the
Stanford Scientific Corporation.
Senior Tom Engelman called the body
fat measurement station "the favorite
booth here." He said the skinfold test to
determine the percent of body fat pro
vides a ratio of muscle to fat rather than a
measurement of total fat.
Junior Janet Lee said, "The muscles and
fat are marbled together." A high percent
reading does not necessarily indicate that
the individual is overweight, however.
"It's called 'overfat'," said Lee.
Optimal body fat for women is 20 to 22

percent and for men 10 to 15 percent. Men
are tested in the front of the thigh and in
the back. Women are measured at the
back of their upper arm and right above
the hip bone.
According to junior Chris Ehly, the
booth attracted about 40 people per hour.
Engelman said the entire class has tested
their body fat. Part of their course grade
will be based on the improvement of their
total fitness at the end of the quarter.
The blood pressure and pulse machines
also proved popular. Stanford Scientific
corporation representative Donald Light
described most of those who volunteered
to be tested as "pretty healthy." He said
many of the students were below the 60 to
100 beat-per-minute average.
But regardless of the health of the blood
pressure volunteers, "a lot of them are ap
prehensive the first time," he said.
According to Maureen Roskoph of the
University Blood Bank, few students
stopped by the blood booth. The bank has
a donor trailer in a different area each day,
but Roskoph estimated that the center re
ceives fewer than 50 donors per day.
The maximum oxygen consumption
test, an important indicator of cardio
vascular fitness, used the Harvard step test
to measure the amount of oxygen muscles

utilize in response to a heavy workload.
Other activities for Health Awareness
Day include a "Smoke Out" and an educa
tion program designed to warn of the dan
gers associated with indiscriminate salt
use. About 80 people pledged in the
"Smoke Out" in which cigarette smokers
are asked to stop smoking for one day.
The Stanford Challenge, a six-event race
starting from Angell Field Sunday at 11
a.m., is also part of the Health Awareness
Day program. It will include an 880 yard
run, a two mile bike race, a swim across
Lake Lag, a five mile run past the dish, an
inner tube or rubber raft race, and an ex
ercise circuit course.
According to class instructor Jack
Martin, the project is in lieu of a mid-term
examination. Participation in either the
fair or the race is mandatory for all stu
dents. "It's not a really competitive situ
ation," said Martin. "It's to help people
become aware of what good health is."
The 135 students and 11 teaching assis
tants in Martin's Optimal Health and Fit
ness class (cross-referenced as PE 109 and
Family, Community, and Preventive Medi
cine 211) organized the fair. The Cowell
Health Center and Res Ed also presented
the community service. Budweiser helped
sponsor the event.

HEALTH SHOT? — Lynn Lazar waits to hear the results as Chris Elhy measures her body
fat to muscle ratio during the health awareness fair held yesterday in White Plaza. Co
sponsored by an optimal fitness class, the fair featured a variety of booths where stu
dents could nave tneir blood pressure checked or obtain information about cardio
vascular fitness.
