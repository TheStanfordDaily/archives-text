strictive clauses of Title IX, female

First year edition
Immature ideas combined with
unproven talent could make this
year's first year staffers' edition a big

If you are one, or would like to pre
tend, see Mike Thurman, who will Be
leading this foolhardy group.
Softball game

them win last time, want to have an
other chance. We'll meet them this
Saturday at Roble Field. The time: 11
a.m. (That means those who attend
the previous night's Joanie-dinner
shouldn't overindulge.)
