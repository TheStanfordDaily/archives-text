# BAR REVIEW

### Andrew J. Preston 
M A Y* 6 *1 9 8 2

Right or wrong, for many
of us, bars have become an
integral part of our social
experience. Whether it be
before a dinner date or after
d movie, or just going out
tor a few drinks, bars are a
part of our lives.
The selection of a bar is
very important to the suc
cess of an evening. Like
selecting the proper ward
robe, the selection of the
proper bar depends on
what you are going there
for. You don't go to the
Oasis for a drink before din-

ner at the Bella Vista, nor
would you go the BBC (Brit
ish Banker's Club) after a
softball game.
I tend to classify bars into
three groups: dive bars,
basic all-purpose bars, and
bars that provide entertain
ment oraancing. Many bars
fit into two or three catego
ries. My classifications re
flect how I see these bars
based on years of thorough
research study. You should
make your own classi
fications based on your own
personal research.

Drinks anyone?

DIVE BARS
Bars that fit into this category
tend to have uniquely grungy
atmosphere, inexpensive if not
cheap beer and electronic
games. They are also character
ized by a wide range of clien
tele. Because of the relative
lyhigh income level in this area,
true dive bars are hard to find.
What we find around Stanford
are pseudo-dive bars.
The Oasis
241 El Camino
Menlo Park
The Oasis has one of the
widest range of patrons of any
bar in the area. It ranges from
the after-softball group to the
preppies on Thursday night. Its
atmosphere can be best de
scribed as trashy and its admit
tance policies strict. Without a
good I.D. you'll probably not
get into the Oasis.
Besides all these short
comings, the Oasis is one of the
most popular bars in the im
mediate Stanford area. It pro
vides an opportunity to con
sume mass quantities of beer
surrounded by peanut shells
and initials of Stanford alumni
dating back to the beginning of
time. The wide variety of elec
tronic games as well as the in
famous "O" burgers lend to
this drinking institution's mis
tique. If you've never been to
the "O," by all means go.

The Dutch Goose
3567 Alameda del las Pulgas
The Dutch Goose is just one
step above the Oasis in its
grungy but intimate decor. The
attractions of the Dutch Goose
include the ever familiar
peanuts on the floor, initials in
the table, tacky signs on the
wall and restrooms that border
on the unsanitary. However,
the atmosphere is greatly en
hanced by the presence of a
table shuffle board. Many a
pitcher can be consumed over
endless games on this "non
electronic" game.
The variety of food provided
at the Goose is significantly
greater than that at the Oasis.
However, I would stick to the
burgers.
The clientele at the Goose is
not as diverse as the "O" but is
interesting all the same. It
could probably be classified as
the preppiest hangout in all of
San Mateo County. The
menagerie of Stanford types
who high-tail it out the Cam
pus Drive backdoor to this es
tablishment is awesome. The
convenience of being within
five minutes of Campus Drive
and Mayfield is definitely one
of the Goose's biggest assets.
Besides, all your friends wil be
ihere.

l he Alpine Inn
viormerly Rossotti's)
Alpine Road
Woodside
Zots, made famous by the
turkey trot, is your basic after
noon bar. The large outdoor
seating capacity as well as the
Woodside location make it the
perfect afternoon getaway. Af
ter an invigorating jog or bike
ride, Zots is just the doctor's or
der for quenching your thirst.
Pitchers of beer are ever-flow
ing as well as are the burgers
and dogs that Zots is famous
for. If you have nothing better
to do one afternoon and want
to catch some rays while down
ing some brew or are looking
for some place to bike ride on
aturday afternoon, Zots is the
•lace.
Antonio's Nut House
321 California Avenue
Palo Alto
The Nut House is the most
convenient dive bar to Escon
dido Village and the south end
of campus. The Nut House,
which gained its name from the
huge barrels of peanuts it gave
freely to its patrons, has been
forced by inflation to charge
for them now. However, a bag
of peanuts and a pitcher of
beer at the Nut House is still an

admirable way to spend an af
ternoon or evening.
The clientele tends to be
more local in nature. However,
as long as you stay away on Fri
day afternoons after everyone
has cashed their paychecks,
even the preppiest Stanford
types can find enjoyment in the
pool tables and electronic
games.
Rudyard's
University Avenue
Palo Alto
Rudyard's is quickly becom
ing one of Stanford's more
popular hangouts. Its decor
and atmosphere attempt to
portray an Indian pub in a
Rudyard Kipling novel but its
clientele smacks of Palo Alto,
Cal. and Stanford U.S.A. If you
are into a quick game of darts
in an intimate and delightful at
mosphere, Rudy's is the place.
Located very close to cam
pus, just on the other side of El
Camino on University Ave., it is
one of the most convenient
watering holes to the Farm. The
mixture of people who fre
quent this establishment is one
of its strongest assets. Watching
a preppie play darts with a
Hell's Angel is a truly re
markable experience. If you're
looking for something new and
different in the dive bar scene,
I would highly recommend
trying Rudy's.

scribed as trashy and its admit
tance policies strict. Without a
good I.D. you'll probably not
get into the Oasis.
Besides all these short
comings, the Oasis is one of the
most popular bars in the im
mediate Stanford area. It pro
vides an opportunity to con
sume mass quantities of beer
surrounded by peanut shells
and initials of Stanford alumni
dating back to the beginning of
time. The wide variety of elec
tronic games as well as the in
famous "O" burgers lend to
this drinking institution's mis
tique. If you've never been to
the "O," by all means go.

The Dutch Goose
3567 Alameda del las Pulgas
The Dutch Goose is just one
step above the Oasis in its
grungy but intimate decor. The
attractions of the Dutch Goose
include the ever familiar
peanuts on the floor, initials in
the table, tacky signs on the
wall and restrooms that border
on the unsanitary. However,
the atmosphere is greatly en
hanced by the presence of a
table shuffle board. Many a
pitcher can be consumed over
endless games on this "non
electronic" game.
The variety of food provided
at the Goose is significantly
greater than that at the Oasis.
However, I would stick to the
burgers.
The clientele at the Goose is
not as diverse as the "O" but is
interesting all the same. It
could probably be classified as
the preppiest hangout in all of
San Mateo County. The
menagerie of Stanford types
who high-tail it out the Cam
pus Drive backdoor to this es
tablishment is awesome. The
convenience of being within
five minutes of Campus Drive
and Mayfield is definitely one
of the Goose's biggest assets.
Besides, all your friends wil be
ihere.

l he Alpine Inn
viormerly Rossotti's)
Alpine Road
Woodside
Zots, made famous by the
turkey trot, is your basic after
noon bar. The large outdoor
seating capacity as well as the
Woodside location make it the
perfect afternoon getaway. Af
ter an invigorating jog or bike
ride, Zots is just the doctor's or
der for quenching your thirst.
Pitchers of beer are ever-flow
ing as well as are the burgers
and dogs that Zots is famous
for. If you have nothing better
to do one afternoon and want
to catch some rays while down
ing some brew or are looking
for some place to bike ride on
aturday afternoon, Zots is the
•lace.
Antonio's Nut House
321 California Avenue
Palo Alto
The Nut House is the most
convenient dive bar to Escon
dido Village and the south end
of campus. The Nut House,
which gained its name from the
huge barrels of peanuts it gave
freely to its patrons, has been
forced by inflation to charge
for them now. However, a bag
of peanuts and a pitcher of
beer at the Nut House is still an

admirable way to spend an af
ternoon or evening.
The clientele tends to be
more local in nature. However,
as long as you stay away on Fri
day afternoons after everyone
has cashed their paychecks,
even the preppiest Stanford
types can find enjoyment in the
pool tables and electronic
games.
Rudyard's
University Avenue
Palo Alto
Rudyard's is quickly becom
ing one of Stanford's more
popular hangouts. Its decor
and atmosphere attempt to
portray an Indian pub in a
Rudyard Kipling novel but its
clientele smacks of Palo Alto,
Cal. and Stanford U.S.A. If you
are into a quick game of darts
in an intimate and delightful at
mosphere, Rudy's is the place.
Located very close to cam
pus, just on the other side of El
Camino on University Ave., it is
one of the most convenient
watering holes to the Farm. The
mixture of people who fre
quent this establishment is one
of its strongest assets. Watching
a preppie play darts with a
Hell's Angel is a truly re
markable experience. If you're
looking for something new and
different in the dive bar scene,
I would highly recommend
trying Rudy's.

Right or wrong, for many
of us, bars have become an
integral part of our social
experience. Whether it be
before a dinner date or after
d movie, or just going out
tor a few drinks, bars are a
part of our lives.
The selection of a bar is
very important to the suc
cess of an evening. Like
selecting the proper ward
robe, the selection of the
proper bar depends on
what you are going there
for. You don't go to the
Oasis for a drink before din-

ner at the Bella Vista, nor
would you go the BBC (Brit
ish Banker's Club) after a
softball game.
I tend to classify bars into
three groups: dive bars,
basic all-purpose bars, and
bars that provide entertain
ment oraancing. Many bars
fit into two or three catego
ries. My classifications re
flect how I see these bars
based on years of thorough
research study. You should
make your own classi
fications based on your own
personal research.

Drinks anyone?

DIVE BARS
Bars that fit into this category
tend to have uniquely grungy
atmosphere, inexpensive if not
cheap beer and electronic
games. They are also character
ized by a wide range of clien
tele. Because of the relative
lyhigh income level in this area,
true dive bars are hard to find.
What we find around Stanford
are pseudo-dive bars.
The Oasis
241 El Camino
Menlo Park
The Oasis has one of the
widest range of patrons of any
bar in the area. It ranges from
the after-softball group to the
preppies on Thursday night. Its
atmosphere can be best de
scribed as trashy and its admit
tance policies strict. Without a
good I.D. you'll probably not
get into the Oasis.
Besides all these short
comings, the Oasis is one of the

mediate Stanford area. It pro
vides an opportunity to con
sume mass quantities of beer
