# ENTERTAINMENT AND DANCING
## 
### 
These bars attempt to pro
vide an entire evening under
one roof — drinking, dining,
and dancing all at one stop. The
Stanford area is fairly weak in
this type of establishment. Usu
ally one must go to San Francis
co or the San Jose area. How
ever, there are some notable
successes within a short dis
tance of campus.
The Winery
2390 El Camino
Palo Alto
The Winery provides dinner
in its large and spacious dining
rooms. The food selection and
price range are both varied and
adequate. In the entertain
ment area, the Winery presents
programs ranging from Com
edy Night on Wednesday to
jazz on Thursday and rock
bands on the weekends. The
caliber of the entertainment is
usually high and the availability
of seating always adequate.
Drink prices are very reason
able although there is some
times a cover charge. The low
lighting, wood beams, and

plants make it an intimate and
appropriate place to take a
date for an evening out. If you
are into specials, Thursday is
Ladies Night — drinks are half
price. And Tuesday's Kamakazi
night at $1 a shot.
Keystone Palo Alto
California Avenue
Palo Alto
The Keystone, located in an
abandoned grocery store, is
truly an experience. Providing
live entertainment from blue
grass to punk to jazz, The Key
stone is Palo Alto's under
ground concert hall.
If for nothing else, go to The
Keystone to watch the people.
The clientele is diverse and at
times very strange. Cover
charges are usually steep and
drinks expensive. The price
you pay is for the quality enter
tainment which is usually pro
vided. Do not, however, go to
the Keystone for the bar. The
drinks are usually poorly made
and the beer selection inade
quate.
Toby's
1960 El Camino
Menlo Park
Toby's is prodominently a
restaurant and is located be
tween Atherton and Menlo

Park on El Camino. However,
on Friday and Saturday nights
they usually provide entertain
ment in the form of a bluegrass,
country western or rock band.
The bar area is small and in
timate, which leads to strained
eardrums and vocal chords
when more boisterous groups
are playing. However, vocal
cords can be adequately
soothed by the moderately
priced drinks. If you are in that
neck of the woods, and want a
local bar which has a pleasant
and intimate decor Toby's
would be a good choice.
Saint James' Infirmary
390 Moffett Boulevard
Mountain View
Saint James' should be listed
under the dive bar selection.
However, they provide danc
ing to a pre-recorded tape. The
crowd usually tends to be less
intellectual and the music
poorly programmed. How
ever, it is one of the only places
in the area where one can
dance. Beer and drinks are rel
atively cheap and the at
mosphere is anything but in
timate. Saint lames' is truly an
experience but not my type of
place to bring a date you are
trying to impress.
