U.N.peace proposal
gets positive reaction
United Nations — U.N. Secretary General Perez de Cuellar an
nounced late last night that Argentina has given a "positive reaction" to
his plan to bring peace to the Falkland Islands.
The secretary general said he expects the British response to his pro
posals today. He said London is considering his initiative "with great in
terest and a sense of urgency."
U.N. diplomats said the secretary general's plan calls for a cease-fire
and the withdrawal of Argentine troops from the Falklands, which Ar
gentina seized April 2. In turn, the British would withdraw its naval task
force, sent to recover the islands for Britain.
After both sides pull back, U.N. officials would administer the islands
while the United Nations tries to work out a lasting solution to the ques
tion of sovereignty over the territory, which Britain has governed as a
colony since 1833 and which Argentina has claimed since 1816.
"I have a positive reaction from the Argentine government for the
ideas I proposed to them," the secretary general told reporters. "Now I
am expecting a reaction from the other side."
In Buenos Aires, the Foreign Ministry announced that Argentina "is
ready to negotiate a peaceful solution to the conflict" with Britain and
said that it has accepted Perez de Cuellar's intervention as a mediator. .
The Foreign Ministry's statement said that "the first step
towards the solution should be an immediate cease-fire"
and added:
"Argentina accepts, by considering it the most ap
propriate path, the intervention of the United Nations at this
time through the secretary-general, the Security Council, or
the combined action of both.
In London, Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher's office was
non-committal about Perez de Cuellar's initiative and Ar
gentina's response. A spokesman for Thatcher confirmed
that the proposals are being studied but added that he could
not say when the British reply would be made.
In Washington, British sources acknowledged that Perez
de Cuellar's moves had caused "some excitement" but said
that Britain might prefer a new negotiating formula worked
out by the Reagan administration.
The administration's mediation efforts in the conflict were
revived Wednesday when British Ambassador Nicholas Hen
derson met with Secretary of State Alexander Haig Jr. for the
second time in two days to deliver the formal reaction of
Thatcher's government to a new Haig plan for a cease-fire
and disengagement of British and Argentine forces.
At the United Nations in New York, Perez de Cuellar told
reporters that he felt a "sense of relief" from the reaction of
the Argentine government to his initiative and from the
strong support his peace efforts received in the U.N. Security
Council.
After a three hour meeting Monday, the Council ex
pressed its backing of the Secretary General's mediation ef
forts in the South Atlantic war.
"The members of the Security Council express deep con
cern at the deterioration of the situation in the region of the
Falkland Islands and the loss of lives,"Council President Ling
Qing of China said in a statement.
"The members of the Security Council also express strong
support for the efforts of the Secretary General with regard
to his contacts with the two parties."
The original Peruvian plan was rejected Sunday by Buenos
Aires on grounds that it was almost exaclty like an earlier
Haig plan already turned down by Argentina.
Committee adopts Reagan budget
Washington — Apparently ending three months of budget
paralysis, the Senate Budget committee last night adopted a
sweeping plan supported by President Ronald Reagan that
would reduce deficits in Reagan's budget by $188 billion
over the next three years.
The Republican-controlled committee cleared the plan
for action by the full Senate by a party-line vote of 11-9.
The action came shortly after the plan's author, committee
Chairman Pete Domenici (R-N.M.) dramatically announced
it had the president's support.
The White House would not comment officially on
Domenici's report that his new proposal was acceptable to
the president.
But an administration source, who asked not to be identi
fied, said that Domenici was "basically correct." He said,
"The White House has signaled a willingness to accept the
basic outline of what Domenici is talking about."
"Now that we have the White House on board, it (the
Domenici plan) has a good chance of passage, not only in the
Senate but in the House of Representatives," Sen. William
Armstrong (R-Colo.) declared shortly after Domenici dis
closed the president's support at a meeting of the budget
committee.
The original plan called for $125 billion in new revenues
instead of $95 billion. Conservatives protested that the $125
billion figure could have jeopardized implementation of a 10
percent income tax cut scheduled for July 1983. Reagan has
insisted on retaining this third phase of the 25 percent in
come tax cut enacted last year, while Democrats have tried to
repeal or defer it.
On Social Security, Domenici dropped his proposal to
eliminate a 7.4 percent cost-of-living increase scheduled for
July 1 — a proposal opposed by Reagan. Instead, Domenici

said he had the president's support tor a plan to require Con
gress to adopt $40 billion in unspecific Social Security re
forms before the end of the year.
Brits urge diplomatic solution
London — The British government declared yesterday that
mounting military losses on both sides in its conflict with Ar
gentina have made urgent the need to find a diplomaticsolu
tion to the Falkland Islands crisis.
In an apparent response to escalating domestic and in
ternational pressure, Foreign Secretary Francis Pym told Par
liament that the government was actively supporting a flurry
of new diplomatic efforts aimed at negotiating a cease-fire
and an Argentine military withdrawal from the islands.
This change in tone from the government's rhetorical de
termination a few days ago to "put the screws on the Argen
tines" militarily follows the sinking of the Argentine cruiser
General Belgrano and the destruction of the British de
stroyer Sheffield.
As many as 400 Argentine seamen may have perished with
the Belgrano after it was torpedoed by a British submarine
Sunday. About 30 of the crew of the Sheffield are missing and
feared dead and the government yesterday reported that as
many as 60 more were injured after the destroyer was hit
Tuesday by a missile fired by an Argentine warplane.
Pym said he is keeping in touch with United Nations Secre
tary General Javier de Cuellar about similar "helpful ideas"
that "seem certain to be reflected in the basis of any solution
we are able to achieve." He also said for the first time that a
U.N. trusteeship of the disputed Falklands "might very well
prove a highly suitable" long-term solution, if a cease-fire
and Argentine withdrawal could first be negotiated.
The new settlement proposals appear to be variations
combining a call for a cease-fire by both sides with Haig's
earlier proposals for a phased Argentine withdrawal from
the Falklands and a pullback of the British naval task force.
This would be followed by a tripartite interim administration
by Britain, Argentina and the United States using British civil
servants while the islands' long-term future is negotiated.
But Pym and others here said that Britain would have to be
assured of Argentina's commitment to withdraw before it
could agree to a cease-fire. Otherwise, said Stanley Clinton-
Davis, an opposition Labor Party parliamentary spokesman
on foreign affairs, Argentina could use a cease-fire and relax
ation of the British blockade "as a breathing space simply to
reinforce their garrison on the Falklands."
U.S., Peru call for cease-fire
Washington — The United States and Peru yesterday were
seeking to bring about a 72-hour cease-fire between Britain
and Argentina as the first phase of a plan to resolve the South
Atlantic crisis by withdrawing all military forces from the
Falkland Islands area and beginning negotiations on its
future.
Diplomatic sources said the cease-fire was the immediate
objective of an intense, highly secret round of diplomacy
being conducted by Secretary of State Alexander Haig, work
ing with Britain, and Peruvian President Fernando Terry,
dealing with Argentina.
However, while the sources said the U.S.-Peruvian in
itiative appeared to offer the best available hope of prevent
ing further bloodshed, they stressed that, as of last night, it
was still a long shot whose chances of successful implemen
tation remained unclear.
In its broad outline, the plan closely resembles a U.S. in
itiative that foundered because of Argentina's demand that
any outcome acknowledge its sovereignty over the
Falklands.
In fact, the sources said, the initial Argentine rejection of
Belaunde's proposal was based on the continuing insistence
of President Leopoldo Galtieri's military regime that the sov
ereignty issue is not negotiable.
However, the sources added, in the revised form under

discussion, the sovereignty question is couched in am
biguous language that reportedly can be interpreted as per
mitting Argentina to withdraw from the islands while reserv
ing its position.
Another big problem, the sources continued, stems from
British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher's insistence that
the wishes of the Falkland Island residents must be "para
mount" in reaching any long-range solution. In a series of
exchanges with London that intensified Tuesday night, Haig
reportedly sought to induce the British to soften their stance
on this issue.
According to the sources, Britain indicated that it would
be willing to accept language stating that a solution take into
account "the wishes and aspirations" of the islanders. How
ever, that was described by the sources as still too strong for
Argentina, which reportedly wants any cease-fire agreement
to talk only about "the interests" of the islanders.
Church condemns Polish riots
Warsaw, Poland — The primate of Poland's powerful Ro
man Catholic Church yesterday condemned widespread
street disturbances this week to protest martial law as playing
into the hands of "extremists" on both sides that wish con
frontation.
In a 40-minute interview, Archbishop Jozef Glemp also
criticized the Communist authorities for not moving fast
enough to defuse social unrest. He said he believed that the
organizers of demonstrations in many Polish cities on Mon
day had acted without the consent of the leaders of the sus
pended Solidarity trade union.
Glemp was speaking at his Warsaw residence following a
two-day meeting with his fellow bishops in Czestochowa,
Poland's most revered religious shrine. The meeting of the
Polish episcopate ended with a statement declaring that the
disturbances might "delay social agreement, stop steps
taken toward normalization of life, and disorientate young
people."
Bush negotiates in China
Hangzhou, China — Vice President George Bush, arriving
here yesterday for a four-day visit, expressed hope that he
could reduce the growing differences between the United
States and China, but he indicated there was no immediate
prospect of resolving the most difficult of them, the con
tinued U.S. arms sales to Taiwan.
Bush said the arms issue would be discussed "with
frankness and candor," but gave no sign that the United
States was ready to make the concessions — an eventual
cutoff of all arms sales to Taiwan — that China has de
manded.
"Whether there will be final resolutions or not is not really
the point of my visit," Bush said on his arrival here from New
Zealand. "Certainly we are prepared to discuss all issues,
bilateral and international, with frankness and candor, and I
hope we can. Where there is misunderstanding, I hope I can
have a major role in reducing it.
Stocks mixed; trading brisk
New York — The stock market was mixed yesterday in a
session marked by pressure on some high-technology issues.
Trading set a brisk pace for the second straight day.
The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials, up more than 4
points at its best level of the day, closed at 854.45, unchanged
from Tuesday.
Volume on the New York Stock Exchange totaled 58.86
million shares, against 58.72 in the previous session.
Gold was listed at $338.40 per troy ounce.

Belaunde's proposal was based on the continuing insistence
of President Leopoldo Galtieri's military regime that the sov
ereignty issue is not negotiable.
However, the sources added, in the revised form under

discussion, the sovereignty question is couched in am
biguous language that reportedly can be interpreted as per
mitting Argentina to withdraw from the islands while reserv
ing its position.
Another big problem, the sources continued, stems from
British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher's insistence that
the wishes of the Falkland Island residents must be "para
mount" in reaching any long-range solution. In a series of
exchanges with London that intensified Tuesday night, Haig
reportedly sought to induce the British to soften their stance
on this issue.
According to the sources, Britain indicated that it would
be willing to accept language stating that a solution take into
account "the wishes and aspirations" of the islanders. How
ever, that was described by the sources as still too strong for
Argentina, which reportedly wants any cease-fire agreement
to talk only about "the interests" of the islanders.
Church condemns Polish riots
Warsaw, Poland — The primate of Poland's powerful Ro
man Catholic Church yesterday condemned widespread
street disturbances this week to protest martial law as playing
into the hands of "extremists" on both sides that wish con
frontation.
In a 40-minute interview, Archbishop Jozef Glemp also
criticized the Communist authorities for not moving fast
enough to defuse social unrest. He said he believed that the
organizers of demonstrations in many Polish cities on Mon
day had acted without the consent of the leaders of the sus
pended Solidarity trade union.
Glemp was speaking at his Warsaw residence following a
two-day meeting with his fellow bishops in Czestochowa,
Poland's most revered religious shrine. The meeting of the
Polish episcopate ended with a statement declaring that the
disturbances might "delay social agreement, stop steps
taken toward normalization of life, and disorientate young
people."
Bush negotiates in China
Hangzhou, China — Vice President George Bush, arriving
here yesterday for a four-day visit, expressed hope that he
could reduce the growing differences between the United
States and China, but he indicated there was no immediate
prospect of resolving the most difficult of them, the con
tinued U.S. arms sales to Taiwan.
Bush said the arms issue would be discussed "with
frankness and candor," but gave no sign that the United
States was ready to make the concessions — an eventual
cutoff of all arms sales to Taiwan — that China has de
manded.
"Whether there will be final resolutions or not is not really
the point of my visit," Bush said on his arrival here from New
Zealand. "Certainly we are prepared to discuss all issues,
bilateral and international, with frankness and candor, and I
hope we can. Where there is misunderstanding, I hope I can
have a major role in reducing it.

U.N.peace proposal
gets positive reaction
United Nations — U.N. Secretary General Perez de Cuellar an
nounced late last night that Argentina has given a "positive reaction" to
his plan to bring peace to the Falkland Islands.
The secretary general said he expects the British response to his pro
posals today. He said London is considering his initiative "with great in
terest and a sense of urgency."
U.N. diplomats said the secretary general's plan calls for a cease-fire
and the withdrawal of Argentine troops from the Falklands, which Ar
gentina seized April 2. In turn, the British would withdraw its naval task
force, sent to recover the islands for Britain.
After both sides pull back, U.N. officials would administer the islands
while the United Nations tries to work out a lasting solution to the ques
tion of sovereignty over the territory, which Britain has governed as a
colony since 1833 and which Argentina has claimed since 1816.
"I have a positive reaction from the Argentine government for the
ideas I proposed to them," the secretary general told reporters. "Now I
am expecting a reaction from the other side."
In Buenos Aires, the Foreign Ministry announced that Argentina "is
ready to negotiate a peaceful solution to the conflict" with Britain and
said that it has accepted Perez de Cuellar's intervention as a mediator. .
The Foreign Ministry's statement said that "the first step
towards the solution should be an immediate cease-fire"
and added:
"Argentina accepts, by considering it the most ap
propriate path, the intervention of the United Nations at this
time through the secretary-general, the Security Council, or
the combined action of both.
In London, Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher's office was
non-committal about Perez de Cuellar's initiative and Ar
gentina's response. A spokesman for Thatcher confirmed
that the proposals are being studied but added that he could
not say when the British reply would be made.
In Washington, British sources acknowledged that Perez
de Cuellar's moves had caused "some excitement" but said
that Britain might prefer a new negotiating formula worked
out by the Reagan administration.
The administration's mediation efforts in the conflict were
revived Wednesday when British Ambassador Nicholas Hen
derson met with Secretary of State Alexander Haig Jr. for the
second time in two days to deliver the formal reaction of
Thatcher's government to a new Haig plan for a cease-fire
and disengagement of British and Argentine forces.
At the United Nations in New York, Perez de Cuellar told
reporters that he felt a "sense of relief" from the reaction of
the Argentine government to his initiative and from the
strong support his peace efforts received in the U.N. Security
Council.
After a three hour meeting Monday, the Council ex
pressed its backing of the Secretary General's mediation ef
forts in the South Atlantic war.
"The members of the Security Council express deep con
cern at the deterioration of the situation in the region of the
Falkland Islands and the loss of lives,"Council President Ling
Qing of China said in a statement.
"The members of the Security Council also express strong
support for the efforts of the Secretary General with regard
to his contacts with the two parties."
The original Peruvian plan was rejected Sunday by Buenos
Aires on grounds that it was almost exaclty like an earlier
Haig plan already turned down by Argentina.
Committee adopts Reagan budget
Washington — Apparently ending three months of budget
paralysis, the Senate Budget committee last night adopted a
sweeping plan supported by President Ronald Reagan that
would reduce deficits in Reagan's budget by $188 billion
over the next three years.
The Republican-controlled committee cleared the plan
for action by the full Senate by a party-line vote of 11-9.
The action came shortly after the plan's author, committee
Chairman Pete Domenici (R-N.M.) dramatically announced
it had the president's support.
The White House would not comment officially on
Domenici's report that his new proposal was acceptable to
the president.
But an administration source, who asked not to be identi
fied, said that Domenici was "basically correct." He said,
"The White House has signaled a willingness to accept the
basic outline of what Domenici is talking about."
"Now that we have the White House on board, it (the
Domenici plan) has a good chance of passage, not only in the
Senate but in the House of Representatives," Sen. William
Armstrong (R-Colo.) declared shortly after Domenici dis
closed the president's support at a meeting of the budget
committee.
The original plan called for $125 billion in new revenues
instead of $95 billion. Conservatives protested that the $125
billion figure could have jeopardized implementation of a 10
percent income tax cut scheduled for July 1983. Reagan has
insisted on retaining this third phase of the 25 percent in
come tax cut enacted last year, while Democrats have tried to
repeal or defer it.
On Social Security, Domenici dropped his proposal to
eliminate a 7.4 percent cost-of-living increase scheduled for
July 1 — a proposal opposed by Reagan. Instead, Domenici

said he had the president's support tor a plan to require Con
gress to adopt $40 billion in unspecific Social Security re
forms before the end of the year.
Brits urge diplomatic solution
London — The British government declared yesterday that
mounting military losses on both sides in its conflict with Ar
gentina have made urgent the need to find a diplomaticsolu
tion to the Falkland Islands crisis.
In an apparent response to escalating domestic and in
ternational pressure, Foreign Secretary Francis Pym told Par
liament that the government was actively supporting a flurry
of new diplomatic efforts aimed at negotiating a cease-fire
and an Argentine military withdrawal from the islands.
This change in tone from the government's rhetorical de
termination a few days ago to "put the screws on the Argen
tines" militarily follows the sinking of the Argentine cruiser
General Belgrano and the destruction of the British de
stroyer Sheffield.
As many as 400 Argentine seamen may have perished with
the Belgrano after it was torpedoed by a British submarine
Sunday. About 30 of the crew of the Sheffield are missing and
feared dead and the government yesterday reported that as
many as 60 more were injured after the destroyer was hit
Tuesday by a missile fired by an Argentine warplane.
Pym said he is keeping in touch with United Nations Secre
tary General Javier de Cuellar about similar "helpful ideas"
that "seem certain to be reflected in the basis of any solution
we are able to achieve." He also said for the first time that a
U.N. trusteeship of the disputed Falklands "might very well
prove a highly suitable" long-term solution, if a cease-fire
and Argentine withdrawal could first be negotiated.
The new settlement proposals appear to be variations
combining a call for a cease-fire by both sides with Haig's
earlier proposals for a phased Argentine withdrawal from
the Falklands and a pullback of the British naval task force.
This would be followed by a tripartite interim administration
by Britain, Argentina and the United States using British civil
servants while the islands' long-term future is negotiated.
But Pym and others here said that Britain would have to be
assured of Argentina's commitment to withdraw before it
could agree to a cease-fire. Otherwise, said Stanley Clinton-
Davis, an opposition Labor Party parliamentary spokesman
on foreign affairs, Argentina could use a cease-fire and relax
ation of the British blockade "as a breathing space simply to
reinforce their garrison on the Falklands."
U.S., Peru call for cease-fire
Washington — The United States and Peru yesterday were
seeking to bring about a 72-hour cease-fire between Britain
and Argentina as the first phase of a plan to resolve the South
Atlantic crisis by withdrawing all military forces from the
Falkland Islands area and beginning negotiations on its
future.
Diplomatic sources said the cease-fire was the immediate
objective of an intense, highly secret round of diplomacy
being conducted by Secretary of State Alexander Haig, work
ing with Britain, and Peruvian President Fernando Terry,
dealing with Argentina.
However, while the sources said the U.S.-Peruvian in
itiative appeared to offer the best available hope of prevent
ing further bloodshed, they stressed that, as of last night, it
was still a long shot whose chances of successful implemen
tation remained unclear.
In its broad outline, the plan closely resembles a U.S. in
itiative that foundered because of Argentina's demand that
any outcome acknowledge its sovereignty over the
Falklands.
In fact, the sources said, the initial Argentine rejection of
Belaunde's proposal was based on the continuing insistence
of President Leopoldo Galtieri's military regime that the sov
ereignty issue is not negotiable.
However, the sources added, in the revised form under

discussion, the sovereignty question is couched in am
biguous language that reportedly can be interpreted as per

come tax cut enacted last year, while Democrats have tried to
repeal or defer it.
On Social Security, Domenici dropped his proposal to
eliminate a 7.4 percent cost-of-living increase scheduled for
July 1 — a proposal opposed by Reagan. Instead, Domenici

said he had the president's support tor a plan to require Con
gress to adopt $40 billion in unspecific Social Security re
forms before the end of the year.
Brits urge diplomatic solution
London — The British government declared yesterday that
mounting military losses on both sides in its conflict with Ar
gentina have made urgent the need to find a diplomaticsolu
tion to the Falkland Islands crisis.
In an apparent response to escalating domestic and in
ternational pressure, Foreign Secretary Francis Pym told Par
liament that the government was actively supporting a flurry
of new diplomatic efforts aimed at negotiating a cease-fire
and an Argentine military withdrawal from the islands.
This change in tone from the government's rhetorical de
termination a few days ago to "put the screws on the Argen
tines" militarily follows the sinking of the Argentine cruiser
General Belgrano and the destruction of the British de
stroyer Sheffield.
As many as 400 Argentine seamen may have perished with
the Belgrano after it was torpedoed by a British submarine
Sunday. About 30 of the crew of the Sheffield are missing and
feared dead and the government yesterday reported that as
many as 60 more were injured after the destroyer was hit
Tuesday by a missile fired by an Argentine warplane.
Pym said he is keeping in touch with United Nations Secre
tary General Javier de Cuellar about similar "helpful ideas"
that "seem certain to be reflected in the basis of any solution
we are able to achieve." He also said for the first time that a
U.N. trusteeship of the disputed Falklands "might very well
prove a highly suitable" long-term solution, if a cease-fire
and Argentine withdrawal could first be negotiated.
The new settlement proposals appear to be variations
combining a call for a cease-fire by both sides with Haig's
earlier proposals for a phased Argentine withdrawal from
the Falklands and a pullback of the British naval task force.
This would be followed by a tripartite interim administration
by Britain, Argentina and the United States using British civil
servants while the islands' long-term future is negotiated.
But Pym and others here said that Britain would have to be
assured of Argentina's commitment to withdraw before it
could agree to a cease-fire. Otherwise, said Stanley Clinton-
Davis, an opposition Labor Party parliamentary spokesman
on foreign affairs, Argentina could use a cease-fire and relax
ation of the British blockade "as a breathing space simply to
reinforce their garrison on the Falklands."
U.S., Peru call for cease-fire
Washington — The United States and Peru yesterday were
seeking to bring about a 72-hour cease-fire between Britain
and Argentina as the first phase of a plan to resolve the South
Atlantic crisis by withdrawing all military forces from the
Falkland Islands area and beginning negotiations on its
future.
Diplomatic sources said the cease-fire was the immediate
objective of an intense, highly secret round of diplomacy
being conducted by Secretary of State Alexander Haig, work
ing with Britain, and Peruvian President Fernando Terry,
dealing with Argentina.
However, while the sources said the U.S.-Peruvian in
itiative appeared to offer the best available hope of prevent
ing further bloodshed, they stressed that, as of last night, it
was still a long shot whose chances of successful implemen
tation remained unclear.
In its broad outline, the plan closely resembles a U.S. in
itiative that foundered because of Argentina's demand that
any outcome acknowledge its sovereignty over the
Falklands.
In fact, the sources said, the initial Argentine rejection of
Belaunde's proposal was based on the continuing insistence
of President Leopoldo Galtieri's military regime that the sov
ereignty issue is not negotiable.
However, the sources added, in the revised form under

discussion, the sovereignty question is couched in am
biguous language that reportedly can be interpreted as per
mitting Argentina to withdraw from the islands while reserv
ing its position.
Another big problem, the sources continued, stems from
British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher's insistence that
the wishes of the Falkland Island residents must be "para
mount" in reaching any long-range solution. In a series of
exchanges with London that intensified Tuesday night, Haig
reportedly sought to induce the British to soften their stance
on this issue.
According to the sources, Britain indicated that it would
be willing to accept language stating that a solution take into
account "the wishes and aspirations" of the islanders. How
ever, that was described by the sources as still too strong for
Argentina, which reportedly wants any cease-fire agreement
to talk only about "the interests" of the islanders.
Church condemns Polish riots
Warsaw, Poland — The primate of Poland's powerful Ro
man Catholic Church yesterday condemned widespread
street disturbances this week to protest martial law as playing
into the hands of "extremists" on both sides that wish con
frontation.
In a 40-minute interview, Archbishop Jozef Glemp also
criticized the Communist authorities for not moving fast
enough to defuse social unrest. He said he believed that the
organizers of demonstrations in many Polish cities on Mon
day had acted without the consent of the leaders of the sus
pended Solidarity trade union.
Glemp was speaking at his Warsaw residence following a
two-day meeting with his fellow bishops in Czestochowa,
Poland's most revered religious shrine. The meeting of the
Polish episcopate ended with a statement declaring that the
disturbances might "delay social agreement, stop steps
taken toward normalization of life, and disorientate young
people."
Bush negotiates in China
Hangzhou, China — Vice President George Bush, arriving
here yesterday for a four-day visit, expressed hope that he
could reduce the growing differences between the United
States and China, but he indicated there was no immediate
prospect of resolving the most difficult of them, the con
tinued U.S. arms sales to Taiwan.
Bush said the arms issue would be discussed "with
frankness and candor," but gave no sign that the United
States was ready to make the concessions — an eventual
cutoff of all arms sales to Taiwan — that China has de
manded.
"Whether there will be final resolutions or not is not really
the point of my visit," Bush said on his arrival here from New
Zealand. "Certainly we are prepared to discuss all issues,
bilateral and international, with frankness and candor, and I
hope we can. Where there is misunderstanding, I hope I can
have a major role in reducing it.

U.N.peace proposal
gets positive reaction
United Nations — U.N. Secretary General Perez de Cuellar an
nounced late last night that Argentina has given a "positive reaction" to
his plan to bring peace to the Falkland Islands.
The secretary general said he expects the British response to his pro
posals today. He said London is considering his initiative "with great in
terest and a sense of urgency."
U.N. diplomats said the secretary general's plan calls for a cease-fire
and the withdrawal of Argentine troops from the Falklands, which Ar
gentina seized April 2. In turn, the British would withdraw its naval task
force, sent to recover the islands for Britain.
After both sides pull back, U.N. officials would administer the islands
while the United Nations tries to work out a lasting solution to the ques
tion of sovereignty over the territory, which Britain has governed as a
colony since 1833 and which Argentina has claimed since 1816.
"I have a positive reaction from the Argentine government for the
ideas I proposed to them," the secretary general told reporters. "Now I
am expecting a reaction from the other side."
In Buenos Aires, the Foreign Ministry announced that Argentina "is
ready to negotiate a peaceful solution to the conflict" with Britain and
said that it has accepted Perez de Cuellar's intervention as a mediator. .
The Foreign Ministry's statement said that "the first step
towards the solution should be an immediate cease-fire"
and added:
"Argentina accepts, by considering it the most ap
propriate path, the intervention of the United Nations at this
time through the secretary-general, the Security Council, or
the combined action of both.
In London, Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher's office was
non-committal about Perez de Cuellar's initiative and Ar
gentina's response. A spokesman for Thatcher confirmed
that the proposals are being studied but added that he could
not say when the British reply would be made.
In Washington, British sources acknowledged that Perez
de Cuellar's moves had caused "some excitement" but said
that Britain might prefer a new negotiating formula worked
out by the Reagan administration.
The administration's mediation efforts in the conflict were
revived Wednesday when British Ambassador Nicholas Hen
derson met with Secretary of State Alexander Haig Jr. for the
second time in two days to deliver the formal reaction of
Thatcher's government to a new Haig plan for a cease-fire
and disengagement of British and Argentine forces.
At the United Nations in New York, Perez de Cuellar told
reporters that he felt a "sense of relief" from the reaction of
the Argentine government to his initiative and from the
strong support his peace efforts received in the U.N. Security
Council.
After a three hour meeting Monday, the Council ex
pressed its backing of the Secretary General's mediation ef
forts in the South Atlantic war.
"The members of the Security Council express deep con
cern at the deterioration of the situation in the region of the
Falkland Islands and the loss of lives,"Council President Ling
Qing of China said in a statement.
"The members of the Security Council also express strong
support for the efforts of the Secretary General with regard
to his contacts with the two parties."
The original Peruvian plan was rejected Sunday by Buenos
Aires on grounds that it was almost exaclty like an earlier
Haig plan already turned down by Argentina.
Committee adopts Reagan budget
Washington — Apparently ending three months of budget
paralysis, the Senate Budget committee last night adopted a
sweeping plan supported by President Ronald Reagan that
would reduce deficits in Reagan's budget by $188 billion
over the next three years.
The Republican-controlled committee cleared the plan
for action by the full Senate by a party-line vote of 11-9.
The action came shortly after the plan's author, committee
Chairman Pete Domenici (R-N.M.) dramatically announced
it had the president's support.
The White House would not comment officially on
Domenici's report that his new proposal was acceptable to
the president.
But an administration source, who asked not to be identi
fied, said that Domenici was "basically correct." He said,
"The White House has signaled a willingness to accept the
basic outline of what Domenici is talking about."
"Now that we have the White House on board, it (the
Domenici plan) has a good chance of passage, not only in the
Senate but in the House of Representatives," Sen. William
Armstrong (R-Colo.) declared shortly after Domenici dis
closed the president's support at a meeting of the budget
committee.
The original plan called for $125 billion in new revenues
instead of $95 billion. Conservatives protested that the $125
billion figure could have jeopardized implementation of a 10
percent income tax cut scheduled for July 1983. Reagan has
insisted on retaining this third phase of the 25 percent in
come tax cut enacted last year, while Democrats have tried to
repeal or defer it.
On Social Security, Domenici dropped his proposal to
eliminate a 7.4 percent cost-of-living increase scheduled for
July 1 — a proposal opposed by Reagan. Instead, Domenici

said he had the president's support tor a plan to require Con
gress to adopt $40 billion in unspecific Social Security re
forms before the end of the year.
