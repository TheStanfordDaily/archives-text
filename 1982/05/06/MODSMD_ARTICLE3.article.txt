U.N.peace proposal
gets positive reaction
United Nations â€” U.N. Secretary General Perez de Cuellar an
nounced late last night that Argentina has given a "positive reaction" to
his plan to bring peace to the Falkland Islands.
The secretary general said he expects the British response to his pro
posals today. He said London is considering his initiative "with great in
terest and a sense of urgency."
U.N. diplomats said the secretary general's plan calls for a cease-fire
and the withdrawal of Argentine troops from the Falklands, which Ar
gentina seized April 2. In turn, the British would withdraw its naval task
force, sent to recover the islands for Britain.
After both sides pull back, U.N. officials would administer the islands
while the United Nations tries to work out a lasting solution to the ques
tion of sovereignty over the territory, which Britain has governed as a
colony since 1833 and which Argentina has claimed since 1816.
"I have a positive reaction from the Argentine government for the
ideas I proposed to them," the secretary general told reporters. "Now I
am expecting a reaction from the other side."
In Buenos Aires, the Foreign Ministry announced that Argentina "is
ready to negotiate a peaceful solution to the conflict" with Britain and
said that it has accepted Perez de Cuellar's intervention as a mediator. .
