# BASIC ALLPURPOSE BARS
## 
### 
This category is something of
a catch all. Bars listed here do
not clearly fit in any of the oth
er two categories. In general,
they can be used for a wide
range of situations. These bars
are usually moderately priced,
do not carry draft beer and
have a warm uncluttered at
mosphere.
518 Bryant Avenue
Palo Alto
The 42nd Street, located in
an alley between Bryant and
Ramona, is one of the more
popular bars in the area. Its un
usual system of ceiling fans
driven by pulleys and the as
sortment of plants and ferns
make it also one of the most
unique bars in the area. At
tempting to determine where
the end of the pulley is after a
few of your favorite drinks is
quite a challenge.
42nd Street provides an
open, but intimate atmosphere
to discuss a play you have just
seen with a friend or meet new
and unusual people. Drinks
tend to be on the expensive
side and on ►•■days and Satur
days a good I.D. is essential to
gain entrance. The biggest
complaint I have regarding
42nd Street is the unusual
amount of smoke that is
swirled around by those many
ceiling fans. Those of you who
wear contacts may want to take
42nd Street in short intervals.
On any given night, a signifi
cant portion of the business
and law school can be found at
this establishment. The re
mainder of the clientele tends
to be in the 21 to 35 age group
(except for the Paly High types
who have outstanding I.D's). If
you've never been to the 42nd
Street I encourage it. Find
some friends or go alone —
either way the experience will
be worth it.

La Cumbre
Stanford Shopping Center
Palo Alto
La Cumbre is not your or
dinary restaurant bar. Al
though not populated in the
evening, it is an outstanding
Happy Hour watering hole.
From 4-6 p.m. patrons can en
joy two-for-one drinks and
crisp tortilla chips with hot
sauce. The atmosphere is
pleasant as well as sociable. La
Cumbre's daiquiris and fruit
drinks are above average.
However, so are their prices.
But the two-for-one Happy
Hour deal cannot be beat, so if
you find yourself with nothing
to do at 4:30 on a Friday after
noon, La Cumbre may be just
the spot.
Talbot's
463 California Avenue
Palo Alto
Talbot's is one of my favorite
bars, even if they do not ad
vertise in The Stanford Daily. It
is your basic all-American bar.
Clientele, although tending to
the older side, is often smat
tered with a number of Stan
ford grad students and faculty.
Talbot's comes as close as
one can in this area to a basic
New York bar. The bar area, lo
cated in the front of the build
ing, is long and narrow and
provides ample opportunity
for table seating as well as
standing in the bar. Its layout
makes it an ideal spot to catch a
Monday night football or
baseball game as well as other
sporting events on the tube.
The back room of Talbot's is an
great location for a group of
people to get together for
some drinks or dinner.
Talbot's serves a reasonably
priced assortment of typical
bar foods which are well pre
pared and served by a friendly
and attentive staff. If you're
looking for a place to get a
quick dinner, watch a good
baseball game or just meet
your friends for a few drinks,
Talbot's is highly recom
mended.
British Banker's Club
1090 El Camino Real
Menlo Park
The BBC is the closest thing
to a pick-up bar in the area. The
bar's proximity to Atherton
and the Menlo train station at
tracts an older crowd. How
ever, even if you are not into
the middle-aged group, the at
mosphere and decor of the
BBC itself makes it worth the
trip.
The owners have assembled
an impressive collection of an
tiques and memorabilia from
the British Isles. The bar's

layout as well as sound system
and music selection make it a
fun place to go for some drinks.
Upstairs, the restaurant sup
plies expensive but finely pre
pared continental dishes. If
you are into the meat market
scene, or into watching the
meat market scene, Friday af
ternoon Happy Hour at the
BBC is a real experience.
Acapulco
2515 El Camino
Palo Alto
Acapulco is basically a res
.iurant bar. The atmosphere,
•n suggested by the name, is
(('finitely Mexican. The layout
<>t ihe bar portion lends itself to
urge groups interested in the
serious drinking of
margueritas. Furthermore, the
ample supply of munchies,
both hot and cold, curing Hap
py Hour makes the Acapulco
an attractive place for an early
evening drink.
Because it is prodominently
a restaurant, the Acapulco
closes early in the evening.
However, if you are interested
in meeting with a number of
people and need a place for
drinks in a nice and delightful
atmosphere, you may want to
consider the Acapulco.
Sundance Mining
Company
1921 El Camino
Palo Alto
The Sundance Mining Com
pany, like the Acapulco, is pro
dominently a restaurant. How
ever, its bar area is very nice. Its
dark and intimate atmosphere,
usually accented with a fire in
the fireplace, is the perfect lo
cation for a quiet drink with
someone you care for. The bar
has an impressive repertoire of
exotic and unusual drinks.
Their bartenders are quite
skillful in the preparation of
the strangest drinks you can
imagine. Being on the some
what expensive side, Sundance
Mining Company should be
reserved for those special oc
cassions where impressing the
person sitting next to you may
be important.
This category is something of

you've never been to the 42nd
Street I encourage it. Find
some friends or go alone —
either way the experience will
be worth it.

La Cumbre
Stanford Shopping Center
Palo Alto
La Cumbre is not your or
dinary restaurant bar. Al
though not populated in the
evening, it is an outstanding
Happy Hour watering hole.
From 4-6 p.m. patrons can en
joy two-for-one drinks and
crisp tortilla chips with hot
sauce. The atmosphere is
pleasant as well as sociable. La
Cumbre's daiquiris and fruit
drinks are above average.
However, so are their prices.
But the two-for-one Happy
Hour deal cannot be beat, so if
you find yourself with nothing
to do at 4:30 on a Friday after
noon, La Cumbre may be just
the spot.
Talbot's
463 California Avenue
Palo Alto
Talbot's is one of my favorite
bars, even if they do not ad
vertise in The Stanford Daily. It
is your basic all-American bar.
Clientele, although tending to
the older side, is often smat
tered with a number of Stan
ford grad students and faculty.
Talbot's comes as close as
one can in this area to a basic
New York bar. The bar area, lo
cated in the front of the build
ing, is long and narrow and
provides ample opportunity
for table seating as well as
standing in the bar. Its layout
makes it an ideal spot to catch a
Monday night football or
baseball game as well as other
sporting events on the tube.
The back room of Talbot's is an
great location for a group of
people to get together for
some drinks or dinner.
Talbot's serves a reasonably
priced assortment of typical
bar foods which are well pre
pared and served by a friendly
and attentive staff. If you're
looking for a place to get a
quick dinner, watch a good
baseball game or just meet
your friends for a few drinks,
Talbot's is highly recom
mended.
British Banker's Club
1090 El Camino Real
Menlo Park
The BBC is the closest thing
to a pick-up bar in the area. The
bar's proximity to Atherton
and the Menlo train station at
tracts an older crowd. How
ever, even if you are not into
the middle-aged group, the at
mosphere and decor of the
BBC itself makes it worth the
trip.
The owners have assembled
an impressive collection of an
tiques and memorabilia from
the British Isles. The bar's

layout as well as sound system
and music selection make it a
fun place to go for some drinks.
Upstairs, the restaurant sup
plies expensive but finely pre
pared continental dishes. If
you are into the meat market
scene, or into watching the
meat market scene, Friday af
ternoon Happy Hour at the
BBC is a real experience.
Acapulco
2515 El Camino
Palo Alto
Acapulco is basically a res
.iurant bar. The atmosphere,
•n suggested by the name, is
(('finitely Mexican. The layout
<>t ihe bar portion lends itself to
urge groups interested in the
serious drinking of
margueritas. Furthermore, the
ample supply of munchies,
both hot and cold, curing Hap
py Hour makes the Acapulco
an attractive place for an early
evening drink.
Because it is prodominently
a restaurant, the Acapulco
closes early in the evening.
However, if you are interested
in meeting with a number of
people and need a place for
drinks in a nice and delightful
atmosphere, you may want to
consider the Acapulco.
Sundance Mining
Company
1921 El Camino
Palo Alto
The Sundance Mining Com
pany, like the Acapulco, is pro
dominently a restaurant. How
ever, its bar area is very nice. Its
dark and intimate atmosphere,
usually accented with a fire in
the fireplace, is the perfect lo
cation for a quiet drink with
someone you care for. The bar
has an impressive repertoire of
exotic and unusual drinks.
Their bartenders are quite
skillful in the preparation of
the strangest drinks you can
imagine. Being on the some
what expensive side, Sundance
Mining Company should be
reserved for those special oc
cassions where impressing the
person sitting next to you may
be important.
This category is something of
a catch all. Bars listed here do
not clearly fit in any of the oth
er two categories. In general,
they can be used for a wide
range of situations. These bars
are usually moderately priced,
do not carry draft beer and
have a warm uncluttered at
mosphere.
518 Bryant Avenue
Palo Alto
The 42nd Street, located in
an alley between Bryant and
Ramona, is one of the more
popular bars in the area. Its un
usual system of ceiling fans
driven by pulleys and the as
sortment of plants and ferns
make it also one of the most
unique bars in the area. At
tempting to determine where
the end of the pulley is after a
few of your favorite drinks is
quite a challenge.
42nd Street provides an
open, but intimate atmosphere
to discuss a play you have just
seen with a friend or meet new
and unusual people. Drinks
tend to be on the expensive
side and on ►•■days and Satur
days a good I.D. is essential to
gain entrance. The biggest
complaint I have regarding
42nd Street is the unusual
amount of smoke that is
swirled around by those many
ceiling fans. Those of you who
wear contacts may want to take
42nd Street in short intervals.
On any given night, a signifi
cant portion of the business
and law school can be found at
this establishment. The re
mainder of the clientele tends
to be in the 21 to 35 age group
(except for the Paly High types
who have outstanding I.D's). If
you've never been to the 42nd
Street I encourage it. Find
some friends or go alone —
either way the experience will
be worth it.
