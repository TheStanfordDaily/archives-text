Scotch 22

We set out for the Hyatt Palo
Alto last Friday with high ex
pectations. With the extent of
our previous bar-going ex
perience in the area confined
to such beer-drinking institu-

Scotch 22, which opened scarcely

the chance to visit a place that
actually offered dancing was
mind-boggling.
Scotch 22, which opened
scarcely three weeks ago, bills
itself as the place "where you

get more than a drink." A more
appropriate slogan might be
"the place to watch middle
aged people dance." The
Dutch Goose Disco this place is
not.
If, however, you class your
self as a member of the "older
set," and you enjoy tripping

the light fantastic once in a
while, the Scotch 22 may be
your kind of place. Let me first
point out, before we go on,
however, that this review
places me at a distinct disad
vantage. I would feel far more

comfortable doing this were I
10 years older. After all, when
we first came through the
doors our first thoughts were
that we'd walked in on a social
outing of the local Elk's Lodge.
Please keep this in mind if my
opinions seem a little tepid.
People used to the hard
wood decor of most local
drinking establishments are in
for quite a change of pace
here. Plush booths, chan
deliers, and a blaze of colored
lights are the order of the day.
But if your mind conjures up
images of Saturday Night
tcver, don't let it. There's no
oversized, glittering crystal ball
— everything is very stylish,
tven without the music, Scotch
22 has a hearbeat of its own.
Speaking of music, enter
tainment is provided by the
Bob Tucker Band, a five-piece
group that plays all your top-40
favorites (and more) just a little
better than my J.C. Penney
stereo. Don't go expecting the
B-52's and you'll find Mr.

Tucker & Co. more than ade
quate to boogie by. They may
not be ready for the pages of
Billboard magazine, but any
man who can belt out Quarter
flash, "Mammas Don't Let Your
Babies Grow Up to be Cow
boys," and "Celebrate" in
rapid succession deserves
more credit than Ice give.

Plush booths, chandeliers and a blaze
of colored lights are the order of the
day. But if your mind conjures up
images of Saturday Night Fever, don't
let it. There's no over-sized, glittering
crystal ball —everything is very stylish.
Even without the music, Scotch 22 has
a heartbeat all its own.

mium brands of Scotch
whiskey, including favorites
like Chivas Regal, Johnny
Walker Black and Red, and
lesser known classics such as
Glenfiddich and Haig. Whiskey
prices run from $2.25 to $3 a
glass. For those less partial to
Scotch, their extensive bar of
fers most any concoction you
might have in mind, including
hot drinks like Jamaican, Ro
mano and Irish Coffee.
Manager Rick Rumbaugh
described Scotch 22 as "a fun

place where you don't have to
dress up." Despite all the trim
mings, this place does have a
somewhat casual air to it, and
though sportcoats were the
dominant fashion Friday night,
clothing ran the gamut from
black tie to Ocean Pacific.
Scotch 22 aims at the 25-45
age group, but Friday's crowd
included some who missed
that range on both ends, so

don't take those numbers too
seriously. To the Stanford stu
dent who's read this far: well,
as for me, I won't be back un
less I'm with a big group, but
maybe if you like to dance and
you're growing tired of beer
and popcorn every Saturday
you might give this place a try.
Who knows? You might even
learn how to Rumba.
Scotch 22 is open Tuesdays
through Saturdays from 5 p.m.
to 2 a.m. Dancing is from 9 p.m.
to 1 a.m.

less I'm with a big group, but
maybe if you like to dance and
you're growing tired of beer
and popcorn every Saturday
you might give this place a try.
Who knows? You might even
learn how to Rumba.
Scotch 22 is open Tuesdays
through Saturdays from 5 p.m.
to 2 a.m. Dancing is from 9 p.m.
to 1 a.m.
