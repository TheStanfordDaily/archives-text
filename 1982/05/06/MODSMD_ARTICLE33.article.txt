Not since the Vietnam era have Stanford
students likely had so much at stake in what's
going on in Washington as they do today.
Only now, it's the once-maligned
"administration" which is doing the fighting
for us... and most of it is behind the scenes.
University President Donald Kennedy has
found himself in Washington, D.C.,quitea bit
this year. He goes there to testify, to confer
and to lobby — about student aid cuts, about
technology transfer, about federal grants.
Because the complex relationship between
the federal government and the University is
becoming increasingly important, we sent
former Daily editor Sam Howe and
photography editor Artie Streiber to
Washington with Kennedy on his latest visit.
What we learned from their visit — and the
subsequent work of Sam's co-coordinator
Heather Millar and some of our best
reporters — is here before you today.
"Stanford's Washington Connection" — it
may be worth fighting for.
Joan O'Connell
Editor
Justifying the project — an examination of
Stanford's relationship to the federal
government — wasn't very difficult to do. In
the words of Robert Rosenzweig, vice
president for public affairs, "A modern
American university is incomprehensible
unless you come to terms with the federal
government."
We hope you will benefit from our efforts.

Magazine coordinators
