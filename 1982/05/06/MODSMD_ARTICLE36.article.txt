## Federal friendship: The
						University-government relationship is up for review 
### Samuel Howe 
Friendship, friendship,
lust a perfect blendship...
When other friendships have been
forgot,
Ours will still be hot!
It's friendship, friendship,
lust a perfect blendship...
When other friendships
have ceased to jell,
Ours will still be swell!
— Cole Porter,
from Dußarry Was A Lady
To hear many officials from both
universities and the federal
government tell the story,
"Friendship" may as well be the tune
the two establishments have been
singing to each other since the creation
of an extraordinary partnership more
than a quarter-century ago.
The friendship, they say, represents
an interdependence which grew out of
the notion, developed during World
War II and just after, that major
universities like Stanford had the
capability and were indeed best able to
conduct research as well as other
programs in the national interest, and
therefore deserved increasing federal
support.
Originally the idea came out of
university efforts to aid the national
defense. Soon enough, however, it was
applied to other areas, such as health,
agriculture, space exploration (spurred
by the Soviet Sputnik program) and
even social policy. Universities began to
rely on the federal government for
partial funding in almost all areas of
university operation, including student
financial aid, while the government
invested in them to train the nation's
best minds.
Judging by continued legislative
backing and university acceptance,
both groups saw federal support as a
sound economic investment, as well as
a socially desirable goal.
Time will tell whether society will
continue to promote the idea that
government ought to play such a major
role in the support of higher education.
But there is no question that a series of
events in the past few years has put
some strains on the friendship, and that
something of a national debate is being
conducted about just how the
relationship should proceed.
Ironically, at the same time that the
government threatens to withdraw
funding, it may also play an increasing
role in regulating universities and in
demanding accountability for the
dollars it does offer. Educational
institutions are not necessarily going to
be accorded the same degree of trust to
run themselves that they have enjoyed
in the past.
In short, the universities like Stanford
are finding that they are no longer
sacred, and that the friendship is
undergoing redefinition.
The problem is that one of the friends
— the federal government — has
started to question just how "mutual"
the friendship is. Figuratively speaking,
a new administration in Washington is
singing a different Cole Porter tune, this
one from Anything Goes: "Times have
changed, and we've often rewound the
clock..
While the university administrators,
including Stanford President Donald
Kennedy, tend to claim that any money
given them or their students is a crucial
investment in the long-term health of

the nation, the government —
particularly reflected in the attitude of
President Ronald Reagan — is calling
for cuts in many areas of both research
and student aid funding. It says support
levels must be cut back to regain the
fiscally responsible policy necessary to
that same long-term health of the
nation.
Reagan administration officials call
for greater institutional self-reliance,
saying the universities can do virtually
the same quality job on leaner federal
contributions, especially if they solicit
alternative funds more actively. They
also say students can get by on much
less direct federal aid and loan support.
Conflict is apparent in other areas as
well. The government has, in the past
five years, mandated that universities
show more accountability for federal
funds by reporting out the efforts of
personnel involved in federally funded
projects. This represents a break with a
previous era in which almost total trust
was placed in universities to spend
money as it had been earmarked.
As a means of budget-cutting, at least
one major federal agency — the
National Institutes of Health — has
proposed that universities not be
reimbursed in full forthe indirect costs

pertaining to federally funded work,
such as utilities and certain clerical
support. Previously, the universities
3nd the government had negotiated
formulas by which these expenses were
treated as being as legitimate as direct
costs.
As well, a number of incidents,
including some here, involving federal
requests for universities to monitor the
activities of foreign (especially Eastern
Bloc) scholars visiting campuses has
brought claims of national security
interests directly into conflict with the

ideal of academic freedom.
Finally, in many other areas
universities have found they are not
only becoming subject to government
control, but are being treated as
economic entities no different from
private industry. These areas include
medical care administration for those
universities with major medical centers,
the Affirmative Action requirements
designed to ensure equal job access for
minorites and women, and health
regulations governing occupational
safety or the treatment in research of
human and animal subjects.
At Stanford, a core of
administrators in the Office of
Public Affairs has assumed the
increasingly important — and complex
— task of representing the University's
interests in Washington. These
specialists in government relations act
as lobbyists (although they are not
officially registered as such) within the
legislative process. They also work
closely with educational associations
based in Washington that represent the
interests of their member schools.
Stanford makes its presence felt in
the nation's capital at least as much as
does any other university. This view was

repeated in Daily interviews not only by
the University's allies in Washington,
but also by a number of congressmen,
and certain officials who actively
oppose Stanford in legislative battles.
This recognition partly stems from
the vitality of the Stanford government
relations program, and partly from the
priority that its president places on
federal matters. Kennedy is clearly an
effective politician. He is also respected
in Washington for his performance as
commissioner of the Food and Drug
Administration from 1977 to 1979 and

for his knowledge of how government
operates.
Set against this backdrop of
university-government
relations is an incipient senseof
urgency for university adminstrators, as
well as students and faculty, to
understand the development of this
involvement. Administrators
acknowledge that this understanding is
important indeterminingthe
universities' purpose, and the direction
of higher education.
In the words of Stanford's vice
president for publicaffairs, Robert
Rosenzweig, "The government is
simplya partofourlife. Ifyou want
to understanda university like Stanford,
you have to understand its relationship
to the federal government. Nevermind
whether you approve of it or
disapprove of it — you have to
understand it. A modern American
university is incomprehensible unJess
you come to terms with the role of the
federal government."
Stanford University has been either a
particularly fortunate participant in the
great flowering of university
government involvement, or,
alternately, it has been a particularly
avaricious culprit in an era which has
created unrealistic expectations about
the extent to which the federal
government ought to support higher
education.
In any case, Stanford last year
received nearly $200 million in federal
contracts and grants (including
financial aid) — a figure equivalent to
46.5 percent of the University's total
operating expenditures, excepting
construction and renovation of major
facilities.
Moreover, according to the Office of
the Dean of Graduate Studiesand
Research, Stanford has received
somewhere between 2.5 and 3.1
percent of the total federal outlay for
research and development to colleges
and universities each year since 1963.
Among all educational institutions,
Stanford has been either second, third
or fourth in total funds received each
year but one during that time. (MIT has
ranked first each year, with the other
top spots shared among the University
of Washington, Stanford, Harvard and
the University of California at San
Diego.)
In financial aid in the most recent
year, the federal government gave
Stanford nearly $4 million in direct
support of institutional loan or grant
programs and another $5 million to
individuals in the University.
Perhaps more important than any
statistics, however, is the debate about
the wisdom of accepting — even
depending upon — such a large
amount of federal support. Those who
favor the policy — among them
Kennedy and Rosenzweig — say the
government gets a "bargain" for any
investment it makes in education, and
that the government has until recently
made no attempt to control the
workings of the universities in
proportion to the support they receive.
Thus, they say, the government
should be at least as opposed as schools
like Stanford to reducing federal
commitment and to increasing
regulations that would make it more
difficult for universities to do their job.
