## Security concerns prompt more federal regulation 
### Heather Millar 
University administrators and
government officials now
perform the dance of the
spider and the fly, as strand by strand
the federal government appears to be
weaving a web of regulations around
university research which educational
leaders say could fundamentally alter
the nature of the American scientific
community.
In an effort to plug — in former CIA
Deputy Director Bobby Inman's words
— the "hemorrhage of this country's
technology," federal agencies have
attempted to extend federal export
regulations from control of "end
products" such as computer hardware
to control of technological "know
how" such as concepts outlined in
research papers. This new application
of the export restrictions has caused an
outcry from the academic community
and has led University President Donald
Kennedy and four other university
presidents to write, in a recent letter to
the secretaries of Defense, State and
Commerce, that the latter applications
of the restrictions "represent the worst
possible direction... They fail to
preserve the status quoand virtually ./
guarantee that there will be no future."
The conflict has been developing
over the last few years:
• In December 1980, the director of
the Very High Speed Integrated Cjjrcuit
Program Office issued a memorandum
which attempts'to restrict the
publication of unclassified university
research results arising from
Department of Defense (DOD)
sponsored projects.
• Early in 1981, the State Department
informed officials at Cornell University
that a visiting Hungarian engineer must
limit his study of electronics to the
classroom, and should be allowed no
private discussions or seminars and no
access to pre-publication copies of
research papers.
• Later in 1981, the Commerce
Department asked Electrical
Engineering Prof. Bruce Lusignan,
director of the Commdnications
Satellite Planning Centerhere, to
provide an extensive description of the
lab equipment a Chinese scholar would
be exposed to and an itinerary detailing
where the visitor would go during an
exchange program. The inquiry also
asked Lusignan to outline the ties, both
formal and informal, his lab had to
government and industry. On all
counts, Lusignan refused.
• In January of this year, the issue
received nationwide publicity when
Gerald Lieberman, Stanford's vice
provost and dean of graduate study and
research, refused to apply federal
export regulations to the activities of
visiting Soviet scientist Nicolai Umnov.'
The regulations would have barrel*
Umnov from, among other things,
industrial visits, theory and
programming techniques, and
production research "except for
documents approved for public release
with unlimited distribution."
Rep. Pete McCloskey (R-Menlo Park)
suggested that these incidents manifest
"the sort of aftti-communist mentality
of the far jright that... has convinced
President Reagan.. . that the
continuing flow of scientific
information to the Russians weakens
mn country."
* But according to Mechanical
Engineering Prof. Bernard Roth, who
was to have been Umnov's host here,
the government first began to spin the

webof regulationsduring the Carter
administration, a time which saw the
establishment of the Export
Administration Regulations (EAR). This
act and the International Trade in Arms
Regulations (ITAR) joinedto limit
technology transfer to hostile
countries. The application of these
regulations to the universities,
however, is a spin-off of the Reagan
administration.
According to Richard Delauer,
undersecretary of defense for research
and engineering, Soviet espionage
efforts have indited the broader
implementation of export regulations:
"We have positive evidence of a large
scale Soviet science and technology
transfer program." Delauer said the
Soviets implement the program in four
waysr first, &y purchasing the product
on the open market and taking it apart;
second, by obtaining designs available
in the marketplace; third, by industrial
espionage;%)urth, by straight 007-styl<?
espionage.
"I don't think there's a question that
there's a technology leak," said Pat
Devaney, associate dean of graduate
study and research. "The question is
how much of this is coming from the
universities and whether or not it's a
workable solution to restrict scholars."
Stanford has assumed the stance that
not only do universities contribute very
little to the technology leak, but thatX
restricting scholars is a fundamentally
unworkable and undesirable solution.
Kennedy has even questioned the \
legality of the new applications of the
controls. |
Roth said it would have been
impossible for hfm to monitor Umnov's
movements/but that Umnov's ability to
obtain vital information from a brief
visit was limited anyway. "If I could
learn that kind of thing in two seconds,
it would be great," said Roth. "I've
traveled around the world; and I've
learned some things. But in general,
there aren't any great secrets that
nobody knows about. The whole image
of the spy is off-base..."

In a global context, American
universities maintain a uniquely open
and fluid atmosphere which American
scholars insist responsible for, and
necessary to maintain, the United
States' edge in technology.
In Europe — in contrast to the
American situation — most basic
research is done Mn private institutes
such as the Max Planck Institute in
Germany These labs are not associated
with the universities. Even when their
research is unclassified, there is less
chance of a student or visiting foreign
scientist stumbling upon data that
should be off limits in a private lab than
there iyfn the open labs of a university
in theAJnited States.

Since the 1960s or early 1970s most
American schools have cut away their
classified research programs, or
separated them from their core
campuses (as is the case with the
University-of-California-run Lawrence
Livermore Labs in the East Bay and Los
Alamos labs in New Mexico). In 1969, by
Faculty Senate vote, Stanford followed
this trend and released a set of
Guidelines on Secrecy in University
Research mandatingthat"no program
of research that requires secrecy... be
conducted at Stanford University."
In response to the federal
government's attempts to impose
secrecy on University affairs, the Faculty

Senate last Mar<:h passed a resolution
affirming the necessity of free and open
intellectual inquiry /this resolution
marked the first action byfaculty
representatives at a major University to
-oppose the application of federal
export controls to academia.
Although openness may
promote American research
lefforts, ft may also, in the view
of some government officials, facilitate
Soviet technology-grabbing. "In terms
of moving ahead as fast as possible,
there's no doubt (that an open
environment encourages research
efforts)," said Leo Young, director of
research and technical information in
the Office of the Undersecretary of
Defense for Research and Engineering.
"But at the same time, if you publicly
said we have a radar system on such and
such a frequency, we don't need that to
conduct better research, but the enemy
wants to know it so they can counter
measure."
Since most militarily-sensitive
technology is classified, and thus secret,
it would seem that federal export
regulations such as the Militarily
Critical technologies List would have
little bearing on the University because
it refuses to involve itself in such
projects. But as the gap between a
breakthrough in basic research and its
practical application grows ever
narrower, it has become increasingly
difficult to determine what is purely
academic, and what is "militarily
critical," according to Devartey. Once a
university scholar creates a pure
mathematical algorithm, it can be
inserted intocbmputer software almost
immediately, Devaney said. But this
computer software could conceivably
be used to monitor weapons systems.
The DOD submits that the new
applications of the ITAR and the EAR
may bef& necessary evil in view of the
fact tha| "with few exceptions the
development of high technology,
whatever the source, has military
impact," as George Millburn, acting
deputy undersecretary of defense for

research and engineering, wrote in a
report treating the "Impact of National
Security Considerations on Science and
Technology."
Robert Rosenzweig, vice president
for public affairs,countered that not
only is it impossible to stem the tide of
technology flow, it is impractical as
well. "If the idea is to keep existing
knowledge away from others, I doubt as
a practical matter that you can do it for
very long," Rosenzweig said. "But that
goal is directly at odds with the goal of
maintaining the advantage that we
have. In order to do that... youneed
the advantages of openness ... The
Russians knew the secret of the atom
bomb almost as soon as it was done.
That's the most highly protected
project we've ever undertaken."
Various proposals to address the
conflict between academic freedom
and national security are bantered
around the corridors of Washington,
although all confirm the issue is an
extremely complex one. In a
controversial speech given to the
American Association of Science last
January, former CIA deputy director
Inman proposed that scientists follow
the lead of cryptologists who submit
sensitive research papers to a
governmental review before
publishing.
Along this line, the DOD is no\fr
(Considering a recommendation by a
Defense Science Board task force to
establish contractual restrictions on
information flow that would exceed the
restrictions imposed by ITAR and EAR.
The DOD contends that this would be
voluntary, as the university would be
free to reject the contract. This could,
hoWever, drastically affect Stanford,
which last year depended on the DOD
for 12 percent of its research support.
In the House of Representatives, Rep.
Charfes Bennett (D-Fla.) has introduced
a bill which, because of broad
language, could Conceivably give the
secretary of defense the rightto
control, restrict or forbid technical
communications of any kind. The
proposed bill would restrict the
publication of a largeamountof
University research since it requires
prior government approval of
publication of results in areas such as
lasers, computer circuitry technology
and high-energy particle beams. While
it is unlikely that such an extreme bill
will pass, it issignificant thatthe bill has
been introduced in two sessions of
Congress.
Several groups have been established
to weigh the views of the government
officials and the scholars. Kennedy co
chairs a DOD forum with Defense
undersecretary Delaueron the issue as
it pertains to universities. Stanford
Linear Accelerator Center Director
Wolfgang Panofsky serves on a National
Academy of Sciences committee that
also treats the issue of technology
export in general.
"The message is that it's not a
simplistic situation where general
principles are going to apply in every
Delauer told the Daily.
Universities, he added, must "take a
responsible view" on national security
interests. shouldn't be confined
to the Pentagon."
Liebermart, who serves on a
"working group" of the DOD forum,
said University officials feel optimistic
that the dialogue started at the
committee's firit meeting may help
untangle the technology export control
controversy. t
