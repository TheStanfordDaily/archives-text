# Frederick Ter man:
## Provost's technique for bringing government money to Stanford 
### 
History, it is often said, is written
by those who win the war. While
the university-government
relationship is still characterized more by
good feelings than by hostilities, there is at
least a battle of sorts among those who
differ on the degree to which the federal
government ought to be involved in
higher education. Whoever "wins" that
battle may have a lot to say about how the
history of higher education from 1950 to
1980 is written.
Still, at least a few facts are clear. In the
1930s and before, with the exception of the
land-grant colleges, the federal
government and the universities had little
to do with each other. What came out of
World War 11 was the perception that
campuses could conduct important
research for the increasingly technically
oriented national defense — later, the
concept was transferred to other
applications as well.
At Stanford, involvement with the
federal government accelerated

largely by the efforts of one man:
Frederick Terman. Just as is impossible to
understand universities without knowing
something about the federal government,
it is impossible to understand Stanford
without knowing something about
Frederick Terman.
It is widely held that during the 1950s
and early 60s, Stanford was transformed
from a good regional institution to a world
class university, and that this was largely
accomplished through the solicitation of
funds from both government and industry.
Terman, now 82and still living on the
Stanford campus, was dean of engineering
and then provost during much of that
time, and is credited with understanding
the new post-war relationship: "This new
ballgame would be called sponsored
research," he recalled in a 1977 interview.
"It seemed to me there'd be a new wave of
government research support, the
scientific war effort had been so very
successful."
Believing in the idea that sponsored

research was an "investment" in the
future, Terman, whocountsamong his
former students at Stanford both William
Hewlett and David Packard, started an
aggressive campaign to recruit to the
University the most talented faculty and
the most desirable research projects in
the country.
Acting in tandem with President J.E.
Wallace Sterling, he also encouraged
faculty to consult outside of the academic
walls: today, two-thirds of the faculty here
consult for either business or government.
By 1952, Stanford had its first Nobel Prize
winner (Felix Bloch, for physics), and
within the next decade it added four more.
Terman said in a recent Daily interview,
"There really wasn't all that much to it. I
had a technique — you get the best
people, the best people do the best
research, and it falls into place." Terman
also described his theory of "steeples of
excellence," by which he concentrated on
finding what he considered to be the
absolutely top people.
