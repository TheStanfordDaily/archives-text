# Financial aid:
## Uncertainty shrouds the issue of student support 
### Kathy Bodovitz 
As President Ronald Reagan pushes Congress
to accept his proposed cuts in federal student
financial aid, many university students —
present and prospective — wonder if they will be able
to afford to go to school next year.
While no one is able to predict the precise effect on
students of the proposed cuts, everyone seems to
agree that students at expensive institutions like
Stanford will suffer the most.
In terms of the potential effects of the cuts,
everyone has his own opinion. While the Department
of Education (DED) claims that under the new
allocations, no student would be barred from
attending school for lack of money, the American
Council on Education (ACE) believes that the cuts
would make college education impossible for
millions of students. University officials here seem to
be unsure as to what the outcome would be.
The Reagan administration's proposed education
cuts for the fiscal year (FY) 1983 budget are a product
of a new philosophy summarized by Gary Jones, DED
deputy undersecretary for planning: "Seemingly,
everyone believes that the first commitment (to
education) has been the responsibility of the federal
government... We're simply suggesting that families
should share a larger burden of the cost of their
children attending colleges and universities."
Jones pointed out that between 1978 and 1981,
while family income increased 30 percent,
contributions to higher education actually decreased
6 percent.
Opponents of both the philosophy and the
proposals, such as Charles Saunders, vice president

for governmental relations for the ACE, believe: "The
(Reagan) administration is moving toward outright
rejection of federal responsibility for access to higher
educaton, a tenet that has united Republicans and
Democrats since the Eisenhower administration."
President Dwight Eisenhower, concerned with
national defense, initiated the National Defense
Education Act which stated, "The Congress hereby
finds and declares that the security of the Nation
requires the fullest development of the mental
resurces and technical skills of its young men and
women." Access to education then was viewed as a
form of insurance for national security, not
necessarily a social good.
President Lyndon Johnson reaffirmed the
commitment by the Higher Education Act of 1965,
saying, "I propose that we declare a national goal of
full educational opportunity... We want this not
only for (the student's) sake — but for the nation's
sake."
His successor, Richard Nixon, expanded the
commitment and the resulting Education
Amendment of 1972 established Basic Educational

Opportunity (Pell) Grants as a national program.
Nixon said; "No qualified student who wants to go to
college should be barred by lack of money."
Signing an education amendment in 1980,
President Jimmy Carter said, "Through the Middle
Income Student Assistance Act (passed in 1978) we've
brought college within the reach of every student in
this nation who's qualified for higher education. The
idea that lack of money should be no barrier to a
college education is no longer a dream, it's a reality
Current Secretary of Education Terrel Bell says
that the Reagan administration is still
committed "to provide access to higher
education for the truly needy," but describes the
present program as "way out of hand" and claims that
"winding down inflation ... is perhaps the single
most important thing we can do."
David Stockman, director of the Office of
Management and Budget, told the House Budget
Committee in October, "I do not accept the notion
that the federal government has an obligation to fund
generous grants to anybody that wants to go to
college. It seems to me that if people want to go to
college bad enough, then there is opportunity and
responsibility on their part to finance their way
through the best they can."
DED points out that in 1960 the federal
government's commitment to needy college students
consisted of $40 million in Direct Student Loans. In
1966 the appropriation for grants and loans was $346.4
million, and in 1973 the total was $1.2 billion. "This

administration is proposing an appropriation of $4.3
billion for these same programs in 1903 — over 100
times or 10,000 percent as much support for college
students as in 1960," a DED statement said.
The administration is not only proposing future
cuts for FYB3 but rescissions in the FYB2 allocations as
well, so portions of many student aid programs are
still in jeopardy.
The proposed rescissions in FYB2 student aid
funding (for the 1982-83 academic year) include $91
million from the Pell Grants; $44 million from Work-
Study; $6 million from SSIGs; $9.9 million from the
TRIO programs; $1.9 million from public service
fellowships; and $0.1 million from law school
fellowships for minorities.
Probably the most discussed area of the proposed
FYB3 cuts is graduate exclusion from the GSL
program. The ACE contends that a majority of the
nation's graduate students, currently relying on GSLs,
may be unable to continue their education if the
administration's recommendations are adopted.
The Department of Education, on the other hand,
claims that if the student pays his interest as it accrues,

through part-time work, family help, etc., his
repayment burden would increase a maximum of 5
percent under the administration's proposal.
In addition, theadministration is proposing that the
GSL Auxiliary Loan program, Auxiliary Loans to Assist
Students (ALAS), take up some of the burden of
graduate loans. This is a state-run program that will
provide loans at 14 percent interest, and repayment
must begin 60 days after the loan is taken out.
Arthur Marmaduke, director of the California
Student Aid Commission in Sacramento, said he
hopes the state program, CLAS, will be operational in
California this summer so students can take out loans
for this fall.
The problem is that only "seven very, verysmall
lenders have agreed to participate," he said. Many
more larger lenders are still needed, he said, to make
the program functional.
Asked if the CLAS program is an adequate
substitute for the GSL program Marmaduke said,
"Absolutely not." He said that while the interest
payments on the first $300 borrowed may not be
unbearable, by a graduate student's third or fourth
year, his payment will be $250-300 per month. "It
seems to me that negates the whole purpose of the
program," he said.
Gerald Lieberman, vice provost and dean of
graduate studies and research, said GSLs are stil! up in
the air for next year. He also pointed out that the
ALAS program is not yet operating in California and
that it "ultimatelyamountsto increased debtthat
graduate students accrue."
Lieberman said that this increased debt will force
students to place a higher consideration on the
salaries offered in their field, and will discourage
people from going into academic careers because
they don't pay relatively well.
For medical students, Lieberman said that incurring
large debt will force the hand of physicians"to go out
and make a quick buck."
A DED statement expressed the situation
differently: "For borrowers who can expect their
training to result in professional salaries, this added
burden can be handled." The statement did say, "In
some cases, graduate student debt could be increased
more than 60 percent — if the in-school interest is
accrued to principal... Those who do not expect
their graduate training to yield sufficient income
should not undertake such loans."
Lieberman said that for next year, the National
Science Federation and National Institutes of Health
stipends for graduate students will be continued.
Karlene Dickey, director of graduate awards, pointed
out that most doctoral students in Humanities and
Sciences are admitted with fellowships and
assistanceships already in hand and therefore the loan
cuts will not severely affect them.
Dickey said the crunch will fall on masters students
who rely on loans, and she said that graduate students
borrowed $6 million last year. Dickey said, "We don't
expect any particular change in grants and fellowhips
for the coming year, but we just don't know what will
happen in Washington."
Lieberman said that while it is very hard to assess the
impact of the reduction in loans, it is possible that
students already admitted to Stanford for next year
may not show up because of indebtedness. "A larger
no-show rate wouldn't surprise me, especially in the
masters programs," he said.
He also noted that "it's possible that if the loan
program is made less attractive, we may see a larger
proportion of foreign students doing graduate work
here." This year, he said, there was a higher increase
in foreign applications than in domestic applications.
Most graduate students pay their own way and the
University's policy is to admit students based on
merit.
