## The 						University's government relations team goes to work on Capitol Hill

Washington — Stanford
President Donald Kennedy
usually runsthe Dish on
Tuesday mornings, but not on this
particular Tuesday — April 20. Still, the
president of the University, even 3000
miles away from campus in the nation's
capital, is on the run.
This Tuesday is one of the dozen or
more days annually that Kennedy says
he spends either lobbying or testifying
on behalf of the University in
Washington. Before him he has a busy
schedule of meetings with members of
Congress, other university presidents,
representatives of educational
organizations based here and a
reporter from The Washington Post, as
well as a dinner hosted by California
universities for the state's congressional
delegation.
Kennedy is not alone in Washington.
A team of administrators at Stanford is
also here, and will beengaged in
meetings and lobbying efforts of their
own. They work for Stanford's Office of
Public Affairs, and it is their job to
represent the University's interests — to
congressmen, agency officials,
reporters and anyone else of
importance who will listen.
Those who work closely with the
University in legislative battles and
those who oppose it most bitterly agree
on at least one thing — Stanford's
government relations program is one of
the most effective in the country, and it
is only strengthened by the political
skill of Kennedy.
Nan Wells, Princeton's director of
government relations, says Stanford's
government relations team is"the best
in the country."
Although the University does not
maintain an office in Washington, it has
two officials who work virtually full time
on federal matters, and a third who
generally divides her time between
state and federal issues.
Stanford's director of government
relations, Larry Horton, is both
energetic and persistent. In
Washington, he, like Kennedy, isa man
on the run — especially in the halls of
the Capitol building. He makes brief
stops all over, checking up on contacts,
providing answers to questions, telling
a joke or two to maintain the political
acquaintances that, in Washington, can
havea funny wayof making the
difference between defeat and victory
on a key vote.
Robert Freelen, the associate vice
president for public affairs, works more
or less interchangeably with Horton on
government relations. Robert
Rosenzweig, the vice president for
public affairs, also spends a great deal of
time on federal matters> but he retains
many other obligations within the
University and, like Kennedy, tends to

spend a more concentrated amount of
time in Washington.
"One of the great ironies of
advocacy," says Freelen, is that it has
sucha bad name,butthe one quality
which you have to have consistently is
honesty. If you don't provide accurate
information or withhold it, then you
have used up your goodwill. . . Once
you have shaded the truth or lied, you
don't have access to that individual
anymore."
What is involved isa careful and well
documented plea for whatever the
interests of the University happen to be.
"We must make the case for what we
know best," says Horton. "It's not our
job to tell them (congressmen) how to
make economies. It would be foolish of
us to say, 'You need more MlRVsand
less student aid.'"

AwA uesday, April 20, is another
I beautiful spring day in
-JL Washington. A few Cherry
Blossoms are still out, although most
have already done their blooming and
have blown away in a spring storm.
Kennedy hasspent the morningata
Washington hotel finishing up a two
day meeting of the Association of
American Universities, an organization
of the 48 top research universities in the
country, as well as two from Canada.
The meeting is exclusive, even secretive
— only presidents and AAU officials are
allowed to attend. But all the presidents
are there: Bok of Harvard, Giamatti of
Yale, Saxon of California, even the only
woman president of the 50, Hannah
Gray of of the University of Chicago.
Horton, meanwhile, continues till the
last minute to make plans for Kennedy's
afternoon visit to Capitol Hill. One part
of his function is not all that different
from that of the advance man in a
political campaign. However, a greater
part involves his own duties as
spokesman and lobbyist for the
University.

Horton continually laysthe
groundwork for Kennedy's brief visits
to Washington. "With Don, it's not the
quantity of time, but the time is
concentrated and he's awfully
effective." Horton himself estimates
that he makes 12 to 15 — or more —
trips to the capital per year, and those
visits can last anywhere from a day to a
week.
Around noon, the AAU meeting
breaks up.
It isa 10-minute ride to the Capitol
building. Kennedy answers a few
questions about what he hopes to
accomplish with his afternoon there, but
as the taxicab approaches the building,
he becomes quiet for a few moments.
Politician Kennedy takes a rest, and
Biologist Kennedy goes to work.
Flowers around the Capitol are in
bloom, and he starts identifying them
one by one.
Perhaps what happened at lunch —
or didn't happen — is instructive about
how Kennedy spends his time in
Washington. Both he and Horton
emphasize that his schedule must be
kept "fluid," because it often will be
changed at the last minute. While
Horton says he never schedules two
meetings at the same time, he usually
does make some tentative
appointments in case a scheduled one
is changed. "It's all free-form back
here," says Kennedy. "There is just a lot
of free wheeling."
Congressman Tom Lantos, who
under redistricting would represent
Stanford if he is reelected this fall, has
invited us to lunch in the congressional
dining hall. Butatthe last moment, he
has been called to the White House to
be in a ceremony commemorating the
Holocaust.
Thus, the president of the United
States has intervened to change our fine
cuisine with "Members only" to a tuna
fish sandwich with "Staff aides only" in
the basement coffee shop. Kennedy
and Horton take it in stride, however —
they say that similar twists of fate often
land them meetings with key politicians
they did not expect to be able to see.
At 1:25, we are ushered into the
office of Congressman Neal Smith of
lowa. Smith is back in the state, so
Kennedy meets with his senior
legislative aide, Tom Dawson. It is
relatively rare for Kennedy to meet with
a staff aide rather than the congressman
himself, and the rest of the day's
meetings are in fact with members of
Congress.
But Horton points out that meeting
with staff can be at least as effective as
meeting with members themselves
because the staff usually advise their
bosses on the merits of bills anyway. For
that reason, Horton says, he often takes
any time that's needed with
congressional staff, no matter how far
down the rungs of the ladder, to

convince them of the merits of a
Stanford position.
According to Kennedy, "In a normal
situation, I'm asking for something."
On this day he certainly is, asking Smith
to watch the wording of a committee
bill pertaining to indirect cost recovery,
a major concern to Stanford.
Shortly after quarter of three,
Kennedy meets Washington Post
science reporter Cristine Russell
outside the House office building.
At 3:15, a meeting is scheduled with
Pete McCloskey, in whose district the
University now lies. McCloskey's
campaign forthe U.S. Senate has put
him on a punishing schedule involving
long weekends of campaigningin
California and midweek returnsfor
business to Washington. If he is tired,
he doesn't really show it as he bounds
up from his desk to welcome Kennedy.
"Don, I'm here to listen to you,"says
McCloskey, but he asks him a question
about the Stanford baseball team first.
McCloskey was on the varsity himself as
a Stanford undergraduate.
Kennedy and Horton have a specific
item for the McCloskey agenda. The
congressman has led the crusade
against the House Small Business

Innovation Development Act, a bill
which the University strongly opposes
on the grounds it will create a wasteful
set-aside program and will needlessly
divert funds from basic research which
is conducted at the universities. "Pete,
what should we be doing? Whatare our
chances?," Kennedy asks.
The two discuss strategy for awhile.
McCloskey has recently sent out a
"Dear Colleague" lettertoall members
of the Houseexplaining hisopposition.
Soon enough, the topic comes around
to House Speaker Tip O'Neill's position
on the bill. O'Neill is in a difficult
position because his district in
Massachusetts includes Harvard, MIT
and Tufts, who all oppose the bill, and
the Small Business Association of New
England, a leading proponent.
"Hey, I've got an old friend who
knows Tip pretty well," says
McCloskey. An old Kennedy guy —
they used to spend summers together at
Hyannisport... Let me see if he can
speak to Tip."
A few minutes later, the friend is on
the line. "Hello Badger," McCloskey
booms into the phone. "Howyadoin'?
Look, let me talk to you about
somethingfora few minutes...

McCloskey goes into a brief summary
of the bill, and the reasons that he
opposes it. "Could you let me know
what Tip thinks?/' he asks. The hope is
that even if O'Neill won't come out
against the bill, he will at least lie low on
it.
After a meeting with a Massachusetts
congressman on indirect costs, Horton
and Kennedy press on for a 5 o'clock
meeting in the Senate Office Building
with Missouri Sen. Tom Eagleton. Again
the subject is indirect cost recovery —
Eagleton, as a chair of the human
relations subcommittee of the
appropriations commitee, wields
immense power to affect the outcome
of the indirect cost debate.
As Kennedy's goes through an
explanation of how he believes the
failure to recover indirect costs in full
could drive University expenses even
beyond the amount lost —or
significantly decrease the amount of
research done on campus — Eagleton
shakes his head. "I just don't know,
Don, you're going too fast for me. But
I'll believe it if you s?iy it."
At 6 o'clock, Kennedy and Horton are
back on the House side of Capitol Hill,
and Stanford — along with the

University of California, Cal Tech and
USC — is playing host to members of
Congress from California. Although a
few noticeables (McCloskey, as well as
both senators) are unable to attend,
administrators from the school
enthusiastically wplrome those who
have shown up. Afterdinner, it is
Kennedy who rises to lead a discussion.
Above all, the president of Stanford is
taking the role of the conciliator. "How
i\<n we work together?" and "What can
we do to improve communication?"
are the themes of Kennedy's
presentation.
California's congressman and
California's university presidents talk
on until the conversation fragments
into a series of individual discussions. It
is time, anyway, for President Kennedy
and Vice President Robert Rosenzweig
to push on — they are barely on
schedule for a flight to New York and an
8 a.m. foundation breakfast the next
morning. Both Horton and Freelen are
to remain in Washington, for there is
always more work to be done here.
There will be more meetings, more
phone calls, more letters...
Although Stanford's four leading
spokesmen in Washington have spent

a Stanford undergraduate.
Kennedy and Horton have a specific
item for the McCloskey agenda. The
congressman has led the crusade
against the House Small Business

Innovation Development Act, a bill
which the University strongly opposes
on the grounds it will create a wasteful
set-aside program and will needlessly
divert funds from basic research which
is conducted at the universities. "Pete,
what should we be doing? Whatare our
chances?," Kennedy asks.
The two discuss strategy for awhile.
McCloskey has recently sent out a
"Dear Colleague" lettertoall members
of the Houseexplaining hisopposition.
Soon enough, the topic comes around
to House Speaker Tip O'Neill's position
on the bill. O'Neill is in a difficult
position because his district in
Massachusetts includes Harvard, MIT
and Tufts, who all oppose the bill, and
the Small Business Association of New
England, a leading proponent.
"Hey, I've got an old friend who
knows Tip pretty well," says
McCloskey. An old Kennedy guy —
they used to spend summers together at
Hyannisport... Let me see if he can
speak to Tip."
A few minutes later, the friend is on
the line. "Hello Badger," McCloskey
booms into the phone. "Howyadoin'?
Look, let me talk to you about
somethingfora few minutes...

McCloskey goes into a brief summary
of the bill, and the reasons that he
opposes it. "Could you let me know
what Tip thinks?/' he asks. The hope is
that even if O'Neill won't come out
against the bill, he will at least lie low on
it.
After a meeting with a Massachusetts
congressman on indirect costs, Horton
and Kennedy press on for a 5 o'clock
meeting in the Senate Office Building
with Missouri Sen. Tom Eagleton. Again
the subject is indirect cost recovery —
Eagleton, as a chair of the human
relations subcommittee of the
appropriations commitee, wields
immense power to affect the outcome
of the indirect cost debate.
As Kennedy's goes through an
explanation of how he believes the
failure to recover indirect costs in full
could drive University expenses even
beyond the amount lost —or
significantly decrease the amount of
research done on campus — Eagleton
shakes his head. "I just don't know,
Don, you're going too fast for me. But
I'll believe it if you s?iy it."
At 6 o'clock, Kennedy and Horton are
back on the House side of Capitol Hill,
and Stanford — along with the

University of California, Cal Tech and
USC — is playing host to members of
Congress from California. Although a
few noticeables (McCloskey, as well as
both senators) are unable to attend,
administrators from the school
enthusiastically wplrome those who
have shown up. Afterdinner, it is
Kennedy who rises to lead a discussion.
Above all, the president of Stanford is
taking the role of the conciliator. "How
i\<n we work together?" and "What can
we do to improve communication?"
are the themes of Kennedy's
presentation.
California's congressman and
California's university presidents talk
on until the conversation fragments
into a series of individual discussions. It
is time, anyway, for President Kennedy
and Vice President Robert Rosenzweig
to push on — they are barely on
schedule for a flight to New York and an
8 a.m. foundation breakfast the next
morning. Both Horton and Freelen are
to remain in Washington, for there is
always more work to be done here.
There will be more meetings, more
phone calls, more letters...

ON CAPITOL HILL — Stanford President Donald Kennedy and Government Re
lations Director Larry Horton leave Rep. Pete McCloskev's office (above) as they
continue on the lobbying trail, later (left), the University's representatives dis
cum indirect cost recovery policy with Sen. Tom Eagleton (D-Missouri).


Robert Freeleii
the past few days laying out their
concerns and cornering the right
people, the University's voice can never
bequite loud enough.
Washington — Stanford
President Donald Kennedy
usually runsthe Dish on
Tuesday mornings, but not on this
particular Tuesday — April 20. Still, the
president of the University, even 3000
miles away from campus in the nation's
capital, is on the run.
This Tuesday is one of the dozen or
more days annually that Kennedy says
he spends either lobbying or testifying
on behalf of the University in
Washington. Before him he has a busy
schedule of meetings with members of
Congress, other university presidents,
representatives of educational
organizations based here and a
reporter from The Washington Post, as
well as a dinner hosted by California
universities for the state's congressional
delegation.
Kennedy is not alone in Washington.
A team of administrators at Stanford is
also here, and will beengaged in
meetings and lobbying efforts of their
own. They work for Stanford's Office of
Public Affairs, and it is their job to
represent the University's interests — to
congressmen, agency officials,
reporters and anyone else of
importance who will listen.
Those who work closely with the
University in legislative battles and
those who oppose it most bitterly agree
on at least one thing — Stanford's
government relations program is one of
the most effective in the country, and it
is only strengthened by the political
skill of Kennedy.
Nan Wells, Princeton's director of
government relations, says Stanford's
government relations team is"the best
in the country."
Although the University does not
maintain an office in Washington, it has
two officials who work virtually full time
on federal matters, and a third who
generally divides her time between
state and federal issues.
Stanford's director of government
relations, Larry Horton, is both
energetic and persistent. In
Washington, he, like Kennedy, isa man
on the run — especially in the halls of
the Capitol building. He makes brief
stops all over, checking up on contacts,
providing answers to questions, telling
a joke or two to maintain the political
acquaintances that, in Washington, can
havea funny wayof making the
difference between defeat and victory
on a key vote.
Robert Freelen, the associate vice
president for public affairs, works more
or less interchangeably with Horton on
government relations. Robert
Rosenzweig, the vice president for
public affairs, also spends a great deal of
time on federal matters> but he retains
many other obligations within the
University and, like Kennedy, tends to

spend a more concentrated amount of
time in Washington.
"One of the great ironies of
advocacy," says Freelen, is that it has
sucha bad name,butthe one quality
which you have to have consistently is
honesty. If you don't provide accurate
information or withhold it, then you
have used up your goodwill. . . Once
you have shaded the truth or lied, you
don't have access to that individual
anymore."
What is involved isa careful and well
documented plea for whatever the
interests of the University happen to be.
"We must make the case for what we
know best," says Horton. "It's not our
job to tell them (congressmen) how to
make economies. It would be foolish of
us to say, 'You need more MlRVsand
less student aid.'"

AwA uesday, April 20, is another
I beautiful spring day in
-JL Washington. A few Cherry
Blossoms are still out, although most
have already done their blooming and
have blown away in a spring storm.
Kennedy hasspent the morningata
Washington hotel finishing up a two
day meeting of the Association of
American Universities, an organization
of the 48 top research universities in the
country, as well as two from Canada.
The meeting is exclusive, even secretive
— only presidents and AAU officials are
allowed to attend. But all the presidents
are there: Bok of Harvard, Giamatti of
Yale, Saxon of California, even the only
woman president of the 50, Hannah
Gray of of the University of Chicago.
Horton, meanwhile, continues till the
last minute to make plans for Kennedy's
afternoon visit to Capitol Hill. One part
of his function is not all that different
from that of the advance man in a
political campaign. However, a greater
part involves his own duties as
spokesman and lobbyist for the
University.

Horton continually laysthe
groundwork for Kennedy's brief visits
to Washington. "With Don, it's not the
quantity of time, but the time is
concentrated and he's awfully
effective." Horton himself estimates
that he makes 12 to 15 — or more —
trips to the capital per year, and those
visits can last anywhere from a day to a
week.
Around noon, the AAU meeting
breaks up.
It isa 10-minute ride to the Capitol
building. Kennedy answers a few
questions about what he hopes to
accomplish with his afternoon there, but
as the taxicab approaches the building,
he becomes quiet for a few moments.
Politician Kennedy takes a rest, and
Biologist Kennedy goes to work.
Flowers around the Capitol are in
bloom, and he starts identifying them
one by one.
Perhaps what happened at lunch —
or didn't happen — is instructive about
how Kennedy spends his time in
Washington. Both he and Horton
emphasize that his schedule must be
kept "fluid," because it often will be
changed at the last minute. While
Horton says he never schedules two
meetings at the same time, he usually
does make some tentative
appointments in case a scheduled one
is changed. "It's all free-form back
here," says Kennedy. "There is just a lot
of free wheeling."
Congressman Tom Lantos, who
under redistricting would represent
Stanford if he is reelected this fall, has
invited us to lunch in the congressional
dining hall. Butatthe last moment, he
has been called to the White House to
be in a ceremony commemorating the
Holocaust.
Thus, the president of the United
States has intervened to change our fine
cuisine with "Members only" to a tuna
fish sandwich with "Staff aides only" in
the basement coffee shop. Kennedy
and Horton take it in stride, however —
they say that similar twists of fate often
land them meetings with key politicians
they did not expect to be able to see.
At 1:25, we are ushered into the
office of Congressman Neal Smith of
lowa. Smith is back in the state, so
Kennedy meets with his senior
legislative aide, Tom Dawson. It is
relatively rare for Kennedy to meet with
a staff aide rather than the congressman
himself, and the rest of the day's
meetings are in fact with members of
Congress.
But Horton points out that meeting
with staff can be at least as effective as
meeting with members themselves
because the staff usually advise their
bosses on the merits of bills anyway. For
that reason, Horton says, he often takes
any time that's needed with
congressional staff, no matter how far
down the rungs of the ladder, to

convince them of the merits of a
Stanford position.
According to Kennedy, "In a normal
situation, I'm asking for something."
On this day he certainly is, asking Smith
to watch the wording of a committee
bill pertaining to indirect cost recovery,
a major concern to Stanford.
Shortly after quarter of three,
Kennedy meets Washington Post
science reporter Cristine Russell
outside the House office building.
At 3:15, a meeting is scheduled with
Pete McCloskey, in whose district the
University now lies. McCloskey's
campaign forthe U.S. Senate has put
him on a punishing schedule involving
long weekends of campaigningin
California and midweek returnsfor
business to Washington. If he is tired,
he doesn't really show it as he bounds
up from his desk to welcome Kennedy.
"Don, I'm here to listen to you,"says
McCloskey, but he asks him a question
about the Stanford baseball team first.
McCloskey was on the varsity himself as
a Stanford undergraduate.
Kennedy and Horton have a specific
item for the McCloskey agenda. The
congressman has led the crusade
against the House Small Business

Innovation Development Act, a bill
which the University strongly opposes

set-aside program and will needlessly

are there: Bok of Harvard, Giamatti of
Yale, Saxon of California, even the only
woman president of the 50, Hannah
Gray of of the University of Chicago.
Horton, meanwhile, continues till the
last minute to make plans for Kennedy's
afternoon visit to Capitol Hill. One part
of his function is not all that different
from that of the advance man in a
political campaign. However, a greater
part involves his own duties as
spokesman and lobbyist for the
University.

Horton continually laysthe
groundwork for Kennedy's brief visits
to Washington. "With Don, it's not the
quantity of time, but the time is
concentrated and he's awfully
effective." Horton himself estimates
that he makes 12 to 15 — or more —
trips to the capital per year, and those
visits can last anywhere from a day to a
week.
Around noon, the AAU meeting
breaks up.
It isa 10-minute ride to the Capitol
building. Kennedy answers a few
questions about what he hopes to
accomplish with his afternoon there, but
as the taxicab approaches the building,
he becomes quiet for a few moments.
Politician Kennedy takes a rest, and
Biologist Kennedy goes to work.
Flowers around the Capitol are in
bloom, and he starts identifying them
one by one.
Perhaps what happened at lunch —
or didn't happen — is instructive about
how Kennedy spends his time in
Washington. Both he and Horton
emphasize that his schedule must be
kept "fluid," because it often will be
changed at the last minute. While
Horton says he never schedules two
meetings at the same time, he usually
does make some tentative
appointments in case a scheduled one
is changed. "It's all free-form back
here," says Kennedy. "There is just a lot
of free wheeling."
Congressman Tom Lantos, who
under redistricting would represent
Stanford if he is reelected this fall, has
invited us to lunch in the congressional
dining hall. Butatthe last moment, he
has been called to the White House to
be in a ceremony commemorating the
Holocaust.
Thus, the president of the United
States has intervened to change our fine
cuisine with "Members only" to a tuna
fish sandwich with "Staff aides only" in
the basement coffee shop. Kennedy
and Horton take it in stride, however —
they say that similar twists of fate often
land them meetings with key politicians
they did not expect to be able to see.
At 1:25, we are ushered into the
office of Congressman Neal Smith of
lowa. Smith is back in the state, so
Kennedy meets with his senior
legislative aide, Tom Dawson. It is
relatively rare for Kennedy to meet with
a staff aide rather than the congressman
himself, and the rest of the day's
meetings are in fact with members of
Congress.
But Horton points out that meeting
with staff can be at least as effective as
meeting with members themselves
because the staff usually advise their
bosses on the merits of bills anyway. For
that reason, Horton says, he often takes
any time that's needed with
congressional staff, no matter how far
down the rungs of the ladder, to

convince them of the merits of a
Stanford position.
According to Kennedy, "In a normal
situation, I'm asking for something."
On this day he certainly is, asking Smith
to watch the wording of a committee
bill pertaining to indirect cost recovery,
a major concern to Stanford.
Shortly after quarter of three,
Kennedy meets Washington Post
science reporter Cristine Russell
outside the House office building.
At 3:15, a meeting is scheduled with
Pete McCloskey, in whose district the
University now lies. McCloskey's
campaign forthe U.S. Senate has put
him on a punishing schedule involving
long weekends of campaigningin
California and midweek returnsfor
business to Washington. If he is tired,
he doesn't really show it as he bounds
up from his desk to welcome Kennedy.
"Don, I'm here to listen to you,"says
McCloskey, but he asks him a question
about the Stanford baseball team first.
McCloskey was on the varsity himself as
a Stanford undergraduate.
Kennedy and Horton have a specific
item for the McCloskey agenda. The
congressman has led the crusade
against the House Small Business

Innovation Development Act, a bill
which the University strongly opposes
on the grounds it will create a wasteful
set-aside program and will needlessly
divert funds from basic research which
is conducted at the universities. "Pete,
what should we be doing? Whatare our
chances?," Kennedy asks.
The two discuss strategy for awhile.
McCloskey has recently sent out a
"Dear Colleague" lettertoall members
of the Houseexplaining hisopposition.
Soon enough, the topic comes around
to House Speaker Tip O'Neill's position
on the bill. O'Neill is in a difficult
position because his district in
Massachusetts includes Harvard, MIT
and Tufts, who all oppose the bill, and
the Small Business Association of New
England, a leading proponent.
"Hey, I've got an old friend who
knows Tip pretty well," says
McCloskey. An old Kennedy guy —
they used to spend summers together at
Hyannisport... Let me see if he can
speak to Tip."
A few minutes later, the friend is on
the line. "Hello Badger," McCloskey
booms into the phone. "Howyadoin'?
Look, let me talk to you about
somethingfora few minutes...

McCloskey goes into a brief summary
of the bill, and the reasons that he
opposes it. "Could you let me know
what Tip thinks?/' he asks. The hope is
that even if O'Neill won't come out
against the bill, he will at least lie low on
it.
After a meeting with a Massachusetts
congressman on indirect costs, Horton
and Kennedy press on for a 5 o'clock
meeting in the Senate Office Building
with Missouri Sen. Tom Eagleton. Again
the subject is indirect cost recovery —
Eagleton, as a chair of the human
relations subcommittee of the
appropriations commitee, wields
immense power to affect the outcome
of the indirect cost debate.
As Kennedy's goes through an
explanation of how he believes the
failure to recover indirect costs in full
could drive University expenses even
beyond the amount lost —or
significantly decrease the amount of
research done on campus — Eagleton
shakes his head. "I just don't know,
Don, you're going too fast for me. But
I'll believe it if you s?iy it."
At 6 o'clock, Kennedy and Horton are
back on the House side of Capitol Hill,
and Stanford — along with the

University of California, Cal Tech and
USC — is playing host to members of
Congress from California. Although a
few noticeables (McCloskey, as well as
both senators) are unable to attend,
administrators from the school
enthusiastically wplrome those who
have shown up. Afterdinner, it is
Kennedy who rises to lead a discussion.
Above all, the president of Stanford is
taking the role of the conciliator. "How
i\<n we work together?" and "What can
we do to improve communication?"
are the themes of Kennedy's
presentation.
California's congressman and
California's university presidents talk
on until the conversation fragments
into a series of individual discussions. It
is time, anyway, for President Kennedy
and Vice President Robert Rosenzweig
to push on — they are barely on
schedule for a flight to New York and an
8 a.m. foundation breakfast the next
morning. Both Horton and Freelen are
to remain in Washington, for there is
always more work to be done here.
There will be more meetings, more
phone calls, more letters...
Although Stanford's four leading
spokesmen in Washington have spent

ON CAPITOL HILL — Stanford President Donald Kennedy and Government Re
lations Director Larry Horton leave Rep. Pete McCloskev's office (above) as they
continue on the lobbying trail, later (left), the University's representatives dis
cum indirect cost recovery policy with Sen. Tom Eagleton (D-Missouri).


Robert Freeleii
the past few days laying out their
concerns and cornering the right
people, the University's voice can never
bequite loud enough.
Washington — Stanford
President Donald Kennedy
usually runsthe Dish on
Tuesday mornings, but not on this
particular Tuesday — April 20. Still, the
president of the University, even 3000
miles away from campus in the nation's
capital, is on the run.
This Tuesday is one of the dozen or
more days annually that Kennedy says
he spends either lobbying or testifying
on behalf of the University in
Washington. Before him he has a busy
schedule of meetings with members of
Congress, other university presidents,
representatives of educational
organizations based here and a
reporter from The Washington Post, as
well as a dinner hosted by California
universities for the state's congressional
delegation.
Kennedy is not alone in Washington.
A team of administrators at Stanford is
also here, and will beengaged in
meetings and lobbying efforts of their
own. They work for Stanford's Office of
Public Affairs, and it is their job to
represent the University's interests — to
congressmen, agency officials,
reporters and anyone else of
importance who will listen.
Those who work closely with the
University in legislative battles and
those who oppose it most bitterly agree
on at least one thing — Stanford's
government relations program is one of
the most effective in the country, and it
is only strengthened by the political
skill of Kennedy.
Nan Wells, Princeton's director of
government relations, says Stanford's
government relations team is"the best
in the country."
Although the University does not
maintain an office in Washington, it has
two officials who work virtually full time
on federal matters, and a third who
generally divides her time between
state and federal issues.
Stanford's director of government
relations, Larry Horton, is both
energetic and persistent. In
Washington, he, like Kennedy, isa man
on the run — especially in the halls of
the Capitol building. He makes brief
stops all over, checking up on contacts,
providing answers to questions, telling
a joke or two to maintain the political
acquaintances that, in Washington, can
havea funny wayof making the
difference between defeat and victory
on a key vote.
Robert Freelen, the associate vice
president for public affairs, works more
or less interchangeably with Horton on
government relations. Robert
Rosenzweig, the vice president for
public affairs, also spends a great deal of
time on federal matters> but he retains
many other obligations within the
University and, like Kennedy, tends to

spend a more concentrated amount of
time in Washington.
"One of the great ironies of
advocacy," says Freelen, is that it has
sucha bad name,butthe one quality
which you have to have consistently is
honesty. If you don't provide accurate
information or withhold it, then you
have used up your goodwill. . . Once
you have shaded the truth or lied, you
don't have access to that individual
anymore."
What is involved isa careful and well
documented plea for whatever the
interests of the University happen to be.
"We must make the case for what we
know best," says Horton. "It's not our
job to tell them (congressmen) how to
make economies. It would be foolish of
us to say, 'You need more MlRVsand
less student aid.'"

AwA uesday, April 20, is another
I beautiful spring day in
-JL Washington. A few Cherry
Blossoms are still out, although most
have already done their blooming and
have blown away in a spring storm.
Kennedy hasspent the morningata
Washington hotel finishing up a two
day meeting of the Association of
American Universities, an organization
of the 48 top research universities in the
country, as well as two from Canada.
The meeting is exclusive, even secretive
— only presidents and AAU officials are
allowed to attend. But all the presidents
are there: Bok of Harvard, Giamatti of
Yale, Saxon of California, even the only
woman president of the 50, Hannah
Gray of of the University of Chicago.
