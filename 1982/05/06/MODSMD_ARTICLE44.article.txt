# Donald Kennedy: In another life...?

/ -w- n another lifetime, Don would be an Irish politician,"
I says Larry Horton, Stanford's director of government
JL relations.
There are those, however, who say they wonder whether
Stanford President Donald Kennedy will even need to go
through reincarnation to become one.
"Don Kennedy is a guy who would make a fine president of
the United States," says Rep. Pete McCloskey (R-Menlo Park),
"and Woodrow Wilson was the last college president who ever
had all thosequalities."

'Don Kennedy is a guy who would make a
fine president of the United States,
and Woodrow Wilson was the last college
president who ever had all those qualities.'
— U.S. Rep. Pete McCloskey

And a chancellor in the University of California system said,
in reference to an April Fool's story in this year's Da/7y which
reported that Kennedy would enter the race for U.S. Senate,
"The thing about that is that it's really not all that unbelievable,
is it?"
Across Washington, Kennedy's name is well known, both for
his effectiveness on Capitol Hill as the president of Stanford,
and for his two-year tenure as commissioner of the Food and
Drug Administration (FDA). He has testified several times
before congressional committees, and has built up literally
hundreds of political friendships over the years.
Kennedy himself likes to shrug off anysuggestionsthat he
has future political ambitions. "I really don't think about the
future in that way. I am 50... If you look at the average tenure
of college presidents in this country, you could conclude that I
might have a few years at the end of this (tenure) to do
something else, and if that turns out to be true and if there's
something in government, I would certainly consider it. But I
am not plotting toward it, I am not expecting it, I don't even
think it's necessarily the most attractive of the prospective
alternatives I can see. Stanford is and I think will remain the
most important institution I've ever had anything to do with.
Asked about McCloskey's assessment of his presidential
stature, Kennedy said, "It's wonderful to hear that sort of thing,

and sometimes your friends get carried away, but that's just not
very realistic.. That was very nice of Pete."
Perhaps more likely than elective office for Kennedy ("I very
much doubt it,"he says of that possibility) is another influential
position in a government agency, and perhaps a cabinet rank
position in some future administration.
"There's no question that he would likely be on lots of short
lists for high government posts," says Horton.
One possibility might be the Department of Health and
Human Services and, says Kennedy, "In terms of my own
background in science and public policy, (HHS) is certainly
more likely than many, and there are certainly agencies from
which I would be disqualified due to lack of knowledge."
Kennedy is, of course, not a favorite with everybody in
Washington. Says Richard Delauer, undersecretary of defense
for research and engineering, "This is a political town, and
some people will say that he's attached to the previous (Carter)
administration."
And some people will talk downright bitterly about
Kennedy, although they will grudge him the effectiveness with
which others credit him. "He's not a very favored person
around here," says one staff member of the Small Business
Oversight Committee who is trying to get the Small Business
Innovation Development Act passed, a bill which Kennedy has

'It's wonderful to hear that sort of thing, and
sometimes your friends get carried away, but
that's just not very realistic... That was very
nice of Pete/

led thefightagainst.
"First of all, Kennedy whips into town and starts banging on
everybody's door telling them this bill is going to destroy
universities," said the staff member, who declined to be
identified. "He comes in here with all the arrogance of a major
university president, and it's very unfortunate that the
universities have been picking a fight with small business...
Don Kennedy would take his clothes off in front of you if that's
what it takes to defeat this bill."
