## The 						University must follow many government rules

Increased scrutiny of government
expenditures for higher
education has caused colleges
and universities to "lose their immunity
from the regulation to which other
actors in the society are subject,"
according to Robert Rosenzweig,
University vice president for public
affairs.
Even a partial list of major
government regulations which affect
the University — laws governing
hazardous waste disposal and human
subject research; Affirmative Action
and Title IX; effort reporting and
indirect cost recovery; and privacy of
educational records — demonstrates
how the federal government is
intimately concerned with almost every
aspect of University life.
Office of Management and Budget
(OMB) Circular A-21, first published in
March 1978, containsonesetof
regulations which created an uproar in
the academic community. According to
Frank Riddle, associate controller, the
University will spend $2.2 million by the
end of fiscal year 1981-82 to comply
even with the simplified compromise
version which went into effect last
September. Had the original version
been adopted, however, "the cost of
developing the program would have

been half a million dollars and it would
have cost $200,000 per year to operate,"
said Riddle.
The regulations, which fill a
notebook three inchesthick,apply to
colleges and universities which do
business with the federal government
— a category into which Stanford,
which in fiscal year 1980-81 had
government contracts totaling almost
$200 million annuallyand 32 people
administering them in the Sponsored
Projects Office alone, obviously fails.
A-21 regulations "determine how we
allocate both overhead and direct costs
and how we account for them,"
according to Janet Sweet, assistant
controller. This accounting procedure
is known as "effort reporting"' on
government-sponsored projects.
Graduate student tuition remission and
indirect cost recovery are also part of
the circular.
The cost of any project is divided into
two parts: indirect and direct expenses.
Direct costs include the salaries of
faculty and all other persons involved;
consumable supplies and equipment
purchased especially for the project;
computer time; and travel and

communication expenses.
Indirect costs are further subdivided
into two parts: those for which the
University can submit a claim for
reimbursement and those for which it
may not. Janitorial services, heating and
lighting, building and equipment
depreciation, and administration and
library costs are recoverable;
fundraising, student financial aid,
Memorial Church and other University
overhead costs are nonrecoverable
expenses which the University must
assume alone.
A-21 evolved from a well-intentioned
plan to control "spiraling indirect costs
of research" and eliminate what the
General Accounting Office called
"widespread cost mismanagement"
and colleges' "misuse of federal
resources" by improving
documentation. In its initial form, it was
criticized by both administrators and
" academics.
"That first plan for effort reporting
would have been a disaster for higher
education," said Riddle. "It was almost
unworkable — faculty members almost
would have had to fill out time cards."
The tuition remission segment of
A-21 would have affected graduate
students and the professors who
employ them for government
sponsored research projects. The

required change would have caused a
net increase in direct costs charged to
sponsored research (excluding SLAC)
of more than $1 million.
"If tuition remission had become a
necessity, the amount of money we
received wouldn't have gone up
enough" to accommodate money lost,
Prof. William Reynolds, Mechanical
Engineering Dept. chairman and head
of a study group set up to analyze the
impact of A-21 on Stanford.
"Suppose a department spends
$60,000 to support 10 graduate
students," said Riddle. "If it has to pay
the $60,000 which the government had
taken care of, it might only have
enough money to hire five students."
Riddle said that the department would
then be forced to let the other five
students go without necessarily making
provisions for support for them
elsewhere.
University negotiators convinced the
OMB not to implement that type of
change here. As in A-21's unsuccessful
attempt to increase effort reporting,
"we demonstrated to the government
that if we implemented the new cost
handling requirements, they would

have had to incur even more new
costs," according to Sweet.
Regulations like A-21 are not
the only ones which exact a
significant monetary toll on
the University. Rules governing
hazardous waste disposal also require
the University to allocate moneyand
manpower to comply. Unlike A-21,
most hazardous waste disposal laws
were not designed for colleges and
universities alone. Rather, they were
created to regulate industry, and this
poses a problem for the University.
"The regulations are usually
designed for industry," said Alain
Decleve, adjunct professor of radiology
and director of health and safety,
biosafety. "The waste regulations were
designed to avert environmental
disasters caused by industry — not
really things generated in an academic
environment." Universities "don't
produce tons of chemicals." Instead,
"we are dealing with small quantities of
thousands of chemical* " he said.
This year, the Universi'v allocated
$258,000 toward dealing with hazardous
wastes, according to Riddle. The
Resource Conservation Recovery Act
(RECRA) provides for "cradle-to
grave" control of hazardous materials.
It stipulates that:
• Generators of waste hazardous by
RECRA definition must adhere to
stringent recordkeeping and reporting
requirements. The state of California's
definition of hazardous waste includes
more substances than the federal
government's does, according to
Decleve. One Risk Management staffer
commented that "according to
California's definition, the citricacid
from an orange is potentially
hazardous."
Generators of hazardous waste must
take responsibility for seeing that the
waste materials which they have
produced have been transported — in
approved and properly labeled
containers — to facilities which have
valid permits.
"We must have adequate facilities,"
Decleve said, and "we must overcome
the 'not in my backyard' syndrome."
One such facility (actually it is for
temporary storage, not permanent
disposal) is located, literally, in
Stanford's backyard. A storage facility
"with all the gadgets possible to make
sure it is safe" will open soon just
behind the Medical Microbiology
building.
Regulations governing research
conduct abound, but most pertain
solely to research in the sciences. One
controversial set of regulations
proposed by the Department of Health
and Human Services (HHS) would
review all research, including
behavioral sciences projects, involving
the use of human subjects.
In August 1979, HHS (then the
Department of Health, Education and
Welfare) proposed to extend its control
over regulations designed to protect

"human subjects in biomedical and
behavioral research" to include studies
in any field that seek "generalizable"
knowledge by methods that include
information collection by which
research subjects may be identified.
Any named subjects would have had to
give consent prior to publication of any
research findings.
"Nobody questions the applications
of these rules in the social sciences. The
question arises in howfarthose
regulations extend into other
disciplines. They were so broadly
written; they tried to cover so much
that they swept in new categories that
the planners hadn't intended —
categories which bring up First
Amendment questions," said Larry
Horton, University director of
government relations.
The proposed regulations would
require all research conducted at
Stanford involving human subjects, as
defined-by HEW, to comply with HEW
procedures. This requirement "clashes
head-on with institutional autonomy
and sound management," wrote Vice
Provost and Dean of Graduate Studies
and Research Gerald Lieberman in
November 1979.
"It appears that the regulations apply
to types of research not hitherto
thought subject to human subjects
protection review, for example,
historical or journalistic research
involving individual interviews or
letters of inquiry... So broad is the
resulting coverage that the legitimate
goal of protecting human subjects from
real harm becomes dwarfed by the
enormity of the bureaucratic approvals
required for activities which are not
harmful or risky by any common sense
definition," Lieberman said.
With regai d to federal regulations,
the University is largely "in reactive
«mode," Rosenzweig said. One notable
counterexample of Stanford's ability to
shift to "initiative mode" can be found
in its Affirmative Action policy.
Though he said "I'm not at all
persuaded that we would have done
much about Affirmative Action if we
hadn't been forced to do so,"
Rosenzweig said the University has
consistently been well ahead of new
Affirmative Action legislation.
"We have Affirmative Action here for
the diversity it brings, and this is
independent of the federal
government," said Santiago Rodriguez,
the University's Affirmative Action
officer. "If we feel that it's being foisted
on us, we can subvert it."
Rodriguez's main tasksare to:
actively seek out qualified minorities
and women ("though we never use
differential standards to fill some
numerical quota," Rodriguez said);
clarify and solve the problems which
"supervising a diverse work force
engenders" for managers; and devote
effort towards retention of the work
force. "The hierarchy here is one inch
high and a mile wide," he said.
