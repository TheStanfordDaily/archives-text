"We are for peace; we are for friendship be
tween the Soviet people and the American people
... and we stand for it," declared Edward Batalov,
spokesman for the USSR-USA Friendship Society.
He spoke for the 15 men and four women mem
bers of the society's "unofficial" tourist delegation
at a reception held at the Bechtel International
Center yesterday afternoon.
Speaking with delegates after the formal presen
tation, it seemed that they felt the initiative for
peace lay with the United States government. Del
egation leader Vasily Vlasihin, a research fellow at
the Institute of U.S. and Canadian Studies in Mos
cow, said President Leonid Brezhnev would
"absolutely" support mutual nuclear disarma
ment. "Brezhnev has announced that the Soviet
Union is unilaterally freezing all medium range
missiles in Europe," said Vlasihin.
When asked about the high number of missiles

already installed, he said that in fact NATO and the
Soviet Union were at parity. "It's just that the Unit
ed States has Pershings not considered to be
strategic or medium ranged, but to us they're
damn strategic."
"The Soviet proposal for no first-strike missiles
must be agreed on by all nations and Salt II must be
signed â€” then we can work on Salt III," added
Batalov. In response to the question of mutual veri
fication, Vlasihin replied he felt it was "very impor
tant" and said, "I'm sure they would find some way
to control each other."
"You know,"he went on, "I don't want to
criticize our U.S. friends, but the United Nations
. .. last year... approved a declaration which said
it was a crime against the human race to use nucle
ar weapons. Do you know who proposed this dec
laration? The USSR. Do you know who voted
against it? That's right... your country."
The atmosphere at the reception was cordial ex

cept for a tense moment when Prof. William
Hermanns, a visiting scholar, described Soviet
diplomats he had met in Belgium as puppets of
their delegation leader, and asked the moderator,
"Will you kindly ask them if they can speak freely."
Vlaslhin asked quickly, "Is this a free country?"
Nevertheless, afterwards several delegates re
ferred difficult questions back to Vlasihin. In one
conversation a delegate was asked how one be
came a member of the Friendship Society. "My
English is not so good, you better asked him
(Vlasihin)," he replied. Vlasihin said that though
only one of their representatives was not a "pro
fessional," anyone, including workers, could join
the society.
One of the women delegates, a psychology pro
fessor, was asked about the ratio of men to women
in the friendship society. "I think the proportions
are quite good, but Vasiliy Vlasihim would know
