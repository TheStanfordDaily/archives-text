# Inside:
## Black men—rapist's other victims 
### Joan O'Connell 
Marie had left her office late, just
after midnight. She approached the
street corner where, from behind,
she could see that a black man was
leaning against a bollard. They were
the only two people in the area. She
quickened her pace and walked past
him toward her car. Suddenly she
heard the sound of heavy footsteps:
Her heart raced, she wanted to run,
but instead she turned and looked
back .., the man had a clipboard in
his hand and was doing jumping
jacks to keep warm. She later learned
that he was a volunteer for a bike
safety survey.
The above incident happened
about a month ago. It may not seem
astonishing or anything more than a
too-hasty conclusion, yet it is the
kind of scene which has become fair
ly common on campus this year. With

last Friday's headlines recounting the
attack on a woman walking near
Kresge Auditorium, a tension and
uneasiness — similar to that which
characterized the campus following
a rash of assaults last fall and winter —
has returned for some women. The
description of the attacker is haunt
ingly familiar; he is said to be black,
between 18 and 25 years of age,
about five foot 10, medium build,
afro haircut. According to the police,
however, little more is known about
the assailant and the police have no
suspects.
Upon hearing about the latest inci
dent, "I just thought, 'Oh no, not
again'/' said junior Mary Haynes,
"now there's going to be more ten
sion."
But the tension of which Haynes
spoke is not confined to women.
There is another group which per
haps feels the impact of the rapist's
attacks as much as the women who

fear for their safety.
Fewer than 5 percent of Stanford's
12,000 students are black males; yet
since the rash of attacks and the three
rapes, this small minority of students
has born a hefty share of the campus
wide /nsecurity.
Many black males here say they
feel frustrated and alienated about
the climate since the attacks; they are
tired of the nervousness and fright
which their presence sometimes in
spires among women they meet, par
ticularly at night; they are often em
barrassed and inconvenienced after
being stopped or followed by the po
lice and asked for identification. In
short, they say they are angry with a
situation they say they can under
stand, but not accept.
Assistant Dean of Student Affairs
Ron Hudson, who also serves as a
counsellor to black students here,
said the pressures on some students
may be making them "psychological

victims."
One student who wished to re
main anonymous said "For all prac
tical purposes, I am the campus
rapist, as far as a lot of people who
have seen the composite drawing are
concerned. Since that picture was
printed in the Daily, I've been
stopped and questioned at least five
times. I'm really sick of being
hassled."

Sophomore Craig Spearman
said "It's a sad but true fact that
you can go walking through
White Plaza and everybody
smiles and says 'hi/ but at
night, I've actually had a per
son turn 180 degrees and walk
back to the library. d*~~-
"People have reaiin I'jtfvted
away from at
night, as soon snhby saw I was
black — it doeisn'r everfmatter
that I'm 6'5",y>pearman said.
Stnford pJ/tjfi€/Chief Marvin
Herringtoh agreed that while
the person who grabbed a
soplyiynbre woman last Thurs
day, evening indeed matches
th£^description of the man
wjrve come to refer to as the
campus rapist, often black men
here who do not meet the de
scription in any other category
but race have often been
ported when they're
walking down the streets* 6r
waiting for a friend.
In their quest to catch the as
sailant, the police have proc
essed hundreds of calls from
persons who thought they had
s4en someone matchbitajjjfee
rapist's description. .Part of fot
lowng up on thsise oHs^ery
lives\>ff campus,
one tilie or another, he ananw
four bther housemates, all
black, i?ut certainly not all
matching the description of

stopped andrfjuestioned by the
police.
Spearman said that one night
he was walking by Mem Aud
and a policeman who he had
known for two years got out of
his car and talked to him. "I
could see he was embarassed
after he realized it was me. The
cops are pretty sensitive here,"
he said; nonetheless, he asked
Spearman for identification

and the reason for ht„ being in
the area.
Herrington explained "dur
ing the height of the concern
(for about two weeks in De
cember) we would get three or
four calls a day from people
who would just say 'I saw the
rapist,' We'd ask, 'did he do
anything?' and the ,p©^qr>
Herrington
have no hesitation in stopping
an individual if there is a rea
sonable cause to stop them.
But there are problems with
the community being para
noid. We try to stress that
there's a difference between
being careful and being para
noid."
said
Her
rington conducted a series of
workshops at which he urged
the to over
helghtened awareness which
women to be more
careful worsens the situation
for him and for other black
men, "It's extremely bad after
(reports of a rape or attack) hit
the Daily."
Officers are advised to pro
ceed carefully in stopping
potential suspects in this case,
as in any other.
"It's difficult to do this. You
know the individual is going to
be sensitive. For the most part,
though, people have taken it in
stride. You try to be as diplo
matic as you can and you try
not to make anyone more un

comfortable than they have to
be. Especially stopping males in
a sex-related case like this,
though, they are bound to be
more apprehensive and in
some cases, defensive."
Debbie Myers, a physician at
the Med School and a resident
fellow in Ujamaa, the Afro
men should feel guilty or tense
about their resemblance to the
rapist.
"I don't find that it is a prob
lem here. My perspective is
that the problem is coming
from the people who are likely
to be doing the calling."
Myers said that if one looks
out as
crime are likely to be minority
persons," and that there have
been
here
tioned long before thta ye.
According to Spearman
though, "We don't feel guilty,
we feej mad. It doesn't help the;
have a black male rapist
just hope to God it's not
dent.
"The guy
it's ludicrous to ali%ijpthe ra
cist issue," he said, noting that
the women attacked were not
all of the same race.
Meanwhile Hudson, himself
black, said that he has been
concerned about black stu
dents and that he has received
"sketchy" reports in the past
months that the police were
possibly being overly attentive
and that some students were
uneasy about what was going
on. He had not heard that the
police were operating in an ob
jectionable manner, however.
"I've asked students to docu
ment incidents so that I have a
feel for what's going on,"
Hudson said, adding that he

has in fact received no
documentation. He said that
should he get information in
dicating considerable concern,
he would want to call a house
meeting in Ujamaa, or a kind of
"town hall" meeting with the
police in order to iron out the
problems.
Herrington said that he has
received no reports from any
one complaining about his of
ficers' behavior in stopping
suspects or investigating re
ports of persons meeting the
description.
yne group which formed
last ralLjo confront some of
these issues was an outgrowth
of "Men Vgainst Male Vio
lence/' a Sa*n Francisco-based
organization However, ac
cording to one coordinator,
law student Am Steyer, the
group has had considerable
attracting men to its
mfc«|mgs and that a lot of the
group's organizers
have been
inco the Rape
there are a
white people around
here who think all black men
look alike. It's not a malicious
racism but rather a kind of ig
norant racism."
Steyer added that he thought
white men on the whole are
"really insensitive to what
black males have to deal with"
in regard to their association
with the "campus rapist."
Steyer said that no black men
had expressed interest in the
group.
Most of the men to whom we
spoke expressed similar feel
ings about their reactions
when they meet women walk
ing on the street.
"To be walking down the
street and have women cross to
the other side is a weird feel

ing. Sometimes I start to say 'be
cool, I'm not him,' but starting
to talk even scares them
more," said one student.
One of Greene's room
mates, John McGee, said he
feels very angry when a woman
appears nervous or tense when
meeting him.
"I feel very angry. I feel
slighted as a person. They
know nothing about me and
they make some kind of
judgement. But the worst thing
is that I can understand why
they do it. I just hope they find
this guy and put him in the
chair. It's not the right reaction
maybe but you can't help it,"
Spearman said.
Several women the Daily
spoke to said they felt very bad
ly for the black men here who
are made to feel uneasy and say
the situation has prompted
guilt for them, too. Steyer said
discussions about these facts
often take up a good amount of
the REP sessions.
Last week, on the night the
woman was attacked near
Kresge, junior Jan Mireles
pulled her car into the same
parking lot near where the at
tack later took place. She said
she saw a black man sitting in a
car by himself as she got out of
her car.
"I almost got back into my
car, because he startled me.
But then I started feeling guilty
and just got out and went to the
library. Later when I found out
about the attack, I called the
police and gave them a de
scription which they said close
ly matched the other woman's.
"It's strange, because in not
wanting to act prejudiced, I
could have done something
which turned out to be really
stupid. But because I reacted I
was able to give some sort of a
description," said Mireles.
Meanwhile, Haynes remem
bered, "I was riding my bike
with a black guy Friday night.
We were riding by the quad
and he was ahead of me. A
woman was walking toward us

and (you could) see the tension
in her face until we turned the
corner and she saw me... (she
looked) as if to say 'Oh, do you
know how relieved I am?' "
Herrington appears frus
trated with trying to balance
safety on the one hand with
preventing that paranoia on
the other. He also fears that the
warm weather and longer day
light hours might prompt
women on campus to drop
their guards and not call for es
corts.
"It seems the majority of
people on campus take a com
mon sense approach. The
problem is that somebody op
erating like this, if he's de
termined and patient, only

needs one person by
themself."
The attack on Thursday night
happened because the at
tacker was likely just waiting in
the parking lot; "waiting his
chance," said Herrington.
"In these kinds of cases,
(calls from people just trying to
be helpful) provide the kind of
information we need to solve
it. In my own experience, we
go through hundreds of these
calls," until they catch the per
son, he said. And until the
rapist is caught, the police will
continue responding to calls
and questioning those for
whom they find "reasonable
cause".
