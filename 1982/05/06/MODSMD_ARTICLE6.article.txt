# Inside:
## Black men—rapist's other victims 
### Joan O'Connell 
Marie had left her office late, just
after midnight. She approached the
street corner where, from behind,
she could see that a black man was
leaning against a bollard. They were
the only two people in the area. She
quickened her pace and walked past
him toward her car. Suddenly she
heard the sound of heavy footsteps:
Her heart raced, she wanted to run,
but instead she turned and looked
back .., the man had a clipboard in
his hand and was doing jumping
jacks to keep warm. She later learned
that he was a volunteer for a bike
safety survey.
The above incident happened
about a month ago. It may not seem
astonishing or anything more than a
too-hasty conclusion, yet it is the
kind of scene which has become fair
ly common on campus this year. With

last Friday's headlines recounting the
attack on a woman walking near
Kresge Auditorium, a tension and
uneasiness — similar to that which
characterized the campus following
a rash of assaults last fall and winter —
has returned for some women. The
description of the attacker is haunt
ingly familiar; he is said to be black,
between 18 and 25 years of age,
about five foot 10, medium build,
afro haircut. According to the police,
however, little more is known about
the assailant and the police have no
suspects.
Upon hearing about the latest inci
dent, "I just thought, 'Oh no, not
again'/' said junior Mary Haynes,
"now there's going to be more ten
sion."
But the tension of which Haynes
spoke is not confined to women.
There is another group which per
haps feels the impact of the rapist's
attacks as much as the women who

fear for their safety.
Fewer than 5 percent of Stanford's
12,000 students are black males; yet
since the rash of attacks and the three
rapes, this small minority of students
has born a hefty share of the campus
wide /nsecurity.
Many black males here say they
feel frustrated and alienated about
the climate since the attacks; they are
tired of the nervousness and fright
which their presence sometimes in
spires among women they meet, par
ticularly at night; they are often em
barrassed and inconvenienced after
being stopped or followed by the po
lice and asked for identification. In
short, they say they are angry with a
situation they say they can under
stand, but not accept.
Assistant Dean of Student Affairs
Ron Hudson, who also serves as a
counsellor to black students here,
said the pressures on some students
may be making them "psychological

victims."
One student who wished to re
main anonymous said "For all prac
tical purposes, I am the campus
rapist, as far as a lot of people who
have seen the composite drawing are
concerned. Since that picture was
printed in the Daily, I've been
stopped and questioned at least five
times. I'm really sick of being
hassled."
