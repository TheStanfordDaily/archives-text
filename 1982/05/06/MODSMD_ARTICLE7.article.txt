## Nicaragua seeks Soviet support 
### Washington Post 
Managua, Nicaragua —
Against a background of in
creasingly radical political
rhetoric here in recent weeks,
Sandinista leader Daniel Or
tega is visiting Moscow ap
parently to seek aid that could
enable Nicaragua's revolu
tionary government to move
closer to an open proclamation
of a Marxist-Leninist state.
Ortega, coordinator of the
government junta and one of
nine top Sandinista comman
ders, was guest of honor at a
dinner hosted by Soviet leader
Leonid Brezhnev.
Many Nicaraguans believe
the mission will be decisive for
the country's immediate
future, depending on whether
the Soviets decide to provide

desperately needed funds to
the government here and, in
effect, subsidize the road to so
cialism as was the case with
Cuba.
Until recently, Nicaragua's
revolutionary leaders had
down-pedaled the Marxist
aspects of their ideology,
saying they represented a
uniquely Nicaraguan, Sand
inista philosophy.
But growing domestic and
international pressures, many
promoted by Washington,
have put the Sandinistas in an
increasingly defensive posture.
As the consensus appears to
have grown among the leader
ship that there is no hope of
reaching an accommodation
with the United States, Sand

inista ideology becomes less a
vague amalgam of nationalism
and social democracy and
tends more overtly toward
communism and toward align
ment with the Soviet Bloc.
At the same time, the
Nicaraguan leadership has de
clared a state of emergency un
der which the media are
censored and opposition polit
ical activity is restricted.
Many Sandinista officials are
beginning to portray the move
toward socialism as their only
chance for survival in a hostile
world.
"We have a revolutionary
project that we have demon
strated over the course of three
years to be a moderate project
in the face of great difficulties
and adversities," one official
said.
"But what happens? We see
more each time that our politi
cal will to develop our project
is being sabotaged system
atically from all sides.
"We are going to continue
making efforts to maintain our
project. But if we are put in a
position where we .., have to
decide whether we survive or
not as a revolution, then we are
going to take the measures
necessary to survive."
At rallies around the country
to commemorate international
Labor Day on Saturday, mem
bers of the Sandinista National
Dictorate addressed the new
slogan adopted by Sandinista
labor unions: "We will defend
the revolution for the con
struction of socialism."
Interior Minister Tomas
Borge, considered one of the

most radical Marxists in the top
Sandinista leadership, ad
dressed a rally of more than
50,000 people in Managua's
Plaza of the Revolution.
Borge charged that oppo
nents of the government
would soon form a "junta of
treason" made up of numerous
critics of the government, in
cluding Roman Catholic
Archbishop Miguel Obando y
Bravo. Obando, who is still in
Managua, subsequently de
nied any interest in political
posts.
After reciting what one busi
nessman later described as
"this enemies list of the gov
ernment," Borge told his au
dience, "They do not know
where we are going."
As he paused a chant began
to well up from the crowd:
"Socialism! Socialism! Social
ism!"
Borge, who carefully
avoided the use of the word
himself, said quietly, "Our
hard-working people know
where we are headed."
In the farming town of Esteli
where some of the hardest
fighting against the forces of
the Somoza dictatorship or
somocistas took place three
years ago, agrarian reform min
ister Jaime Wheelock vowed
that "Nicaragua is no longer
divided between somocistas
and non-somocistas.
"It is divided between revo
lutionaries and coun
terrevolutionaries," said
Wheelock in front of a poster
juxtaposing Marx, Engels and
Lenin with Nicaraguan revolu
tionary heroes.
