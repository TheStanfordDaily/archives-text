## Life in El Salvador: a refugee's retrospective 
### David Chen 
Delia Santa Maria escaped from El
Salvador with her youngest son, Jose Rivera,
in September of last year. Santa Maria, who
was a school teacher in San Miguel, is a 40ish
woman, well built and strong. Her English
was broken but we communicated well with
the help of a translator. She was an animated
speaker, gesturing frequently, and the con
viction in her voice belied the personal trag
edies she had suffered.
She agreed to talk on a Saturday as her
weekdays are spent looking for work. She
and her son live in a church on Diamond St.,
near the Mission District. She offered her
own political perspective, describing El
Salvador's problems from the point of view

I live because I left my
country. If I not leave my

of a woman distressed by what is happening
around her. She spoke at length about her
personal experiences — her story is not
always a pleasant one. But the thing she
always came back to is her belief in the peo
ple of this country — her faith that it is the
American people who could reverse the U.S.
government's policy toward her country.
What follows is a transcription of our con
versation that afternoon.
Daily: What was life like in El Salavador
and what were your reasons for leaving?
Delia Santa Maria: My life in El Salvador, it
was wonderful sometimes. I was a teacher
for 30 years. In my profession, my life was
wonderful, but in the government — no. I
helped to found a union of teachers, in 1964
it began — a strong union. Every teacher, ev

ery educator organized at every level to start
the union.
Every teacher fights for social service and
better salary and especially for dignity. If the
president falls, that is if there is a coup, when
the new so-called president comes in he de
mands the teachers to sign a loyalty oath.
Some teachers never sign. I never signed, no.
My major problem with the government in
my country was that I formed a union of
teachers. I formed a part of a committee
whose people were murdered and disap
peared.
For a long time, the teachers and me in my
country fight, fight for everything to teach.
In 1972 was our first strike. A lot of people
supported us, the university, the Catholic
Church, business and other unions too all
supported our strike. The government killed
two people, workers. They took off their
skin, decapitated them. For 60 days, the
teachers were on strike, but when our union
saw the bodies destroyed like this, it stopped
the strike, everything changed.
I lived because I left my country. If I not
leave my country in 1981,1 would have been
killed. Every teacher leader was killed. In
classrooms, sometimes many children were
killed also — in class. All the young teachers
— decapitated. In a city of my country they
hung the heads outside on the points of a
fence.
In the city of San Miguel, where I lived, in a
school they killed 15 children. They were 12
and 15 years old, two girls the rest boys. They
killed every one. They were playing soccer in
the playground. The military forces came
there, put in a line 15 children and one, one,
one killed them. After they killed everybody
they dragged the bodies around the building
and wrote using their blood — the military
forces their fingers — "Communistas." The
killing of Communists, the children.
It was March 8 in 1979, this killing. After
the killing, they brought the dead bodies to a
morgue and there were so many children
there that when the mothers claimed the
bodies to take them for burial the mothers —
all the mothers — were crying and screaming
and very upset. They were afraid that more
children would die in San Miguel. I don't be
lieve it. I saw it but don't believe.
Daily: You managed to escape here to the
United States with your youngest son, what
about the rest of your family?
Santa Maria: My oldest son disappeared
on Oct. 9,1976. He was 22 years old. He was a
technical engineer — mechanical and elec

trical and communications. For five years I
looked for my son, with my husband, rny
brother, my sister, my youngest son. When
the newspaper had news of somebody
dying, in the morgue in the street... if the
newspaper told that person was 20 years old
or had the characteristics of my son, I have to
look. I have to looking for my son. But never
I could found him. Many of the intelligensia
helped, because the government killed the
intelligent. The government is afraid of the
intelligent people.
Two months after my son disappeared I
went to the American Embassy about my

'My feeling h that in the long
run what is going to save the
people of El Salvador is the
people of the United States.
Once they become aware of
the suffering in El Salvador it
is they who will be able to
help El Salvador/

son. They were very sympathetic. They
promised me to help. They said you have to
be fast because your son is tied up on the
second floor of the National Guard building,
incommunicado. It was very dangerous for
the person at the embassy to tell me this. I
promised him to never tell it, but now I
broke my promise. But I won't give you his
name. He was very sympathetic and wanted
to help me, but it didn't work out.
In 1980, after they killed Monsigneur
Romero(Archbishop Romero)on March 24,
they killed my brother. He was a medical
doctor. He was very lovely with teachers,
children, young people. He was mayor for
two periods in San Miguel.
In my country, now, 2 million people they
have a reason for killing. Only wearing ten
nis shoes and blue jeans, and the military
forces say, "this is guerilla, let's kill him."
Daily:El Salvador has a very stratified so
cio-economic structure. How directly is this
related to El Salvador's problems?
Santa Maria: Sixty-five percent of
Salvadoreans do farm work, but no farmers
work like in the United States. Farmers wear
in my country no shoes, only wear raggedy
clothes, only hat, no food, a small house. A
lot of children drink no milk. The economy
in my country is very agricultural. Work
men work very hard, but get no salary.
They only get about four or five pounds of
the coffee they harvest. Sixty percent are
working very hard for the rich, not for them
selves.

Thirteen families own the land, banks,
business, industries, everything — only 13
families. These families are indifferent to the
suffering of the people. Now these families
are in Miami, Fla. When they want money,
they take it out of banks in Switzerland or the
United States. But a lot of people in El
Salvador are hungry, no food, no house, no
education. This is a Basque problem in my
country, not communist. Anybody can read
Karl Marx. The military forces come to your
house and rob and steal and whatever they
want. They are unjust and they are cruel and
for 50 years we have been living under this
kind of military rule.
Now some of the farmers are supporting
the guerilla movement because their other
choice is to die of hunger. They want a better

way of life. The farmers union they tried to
organize is now outlawed. The union started
to form five years ago but it't not working
under color of law because the law says the
farmers are not entitled to organize or form a
union. But they have been doing it clan
destinely. The farm workers are raising their
hands now. They are preferring die or live.
Injustice! Too much. They have only two
choices, die or fight for their life. Young peo
ple too. Being young in El Salvador is very
dangerous — reason to be killed.
People in my country who are still produc
tive have fled the country because they are
being killed. They are in exile or they're
abroad or they come to the United States.
Part of the problem of Latin America is that
we are so dependent on this economy.
Daily: So is the guerilla movement made
up entirely of peasant farmers? What kind of
people are now actually working against the
government?
Santa Maria: All the people. Since last year,
the University closed, 1980. The preparatory
school, closed. Everyone has converted to
being a guerilla, all levels of life. Enrique
Alvarez was a man from my country who was
a millionaire. His family had been very
wealthy for several generations and he
joined the movement himself and they killed
him last year. He went over and joined the
FDR (Democratic Revolutionary Front). He
organized the hacienda that he owned, or
ganized the workers then went over to the
FDR, but then they assassinated him, De
cember of 1980. The ex-minister of educa
tion left the junta and then went over to an
other guerilla group himself and made an
announcement he was leaving the junta.
The FDR are a representative organization
of every people in El Salvador. Business peo
ple, university people, campes/nos, every
level. (The FDR now represents 90 percent of
the Salvadorean people). There are four
groups together now, strong. Before they
were separate but with the same objective.
Now, together.
Daily: How do you react to the fact of U.S.
military aid and the presence of U.S. military
advisors in your country?
Santa Maria: I want to be very clear and tell
you that it bothers me a lot that this country

sends money to El Salvador to destroy a peo
ple that is just a very simple, humble people.
If you knew what helicopters do when they
pass over the land. They destroy everything.
They don't leave anything, not even trails.
This country is so rich and the fact that its
doing that to El Salvador is something that
makes me feel bad.
I've met a lot of American people since
I've been here who've been very kind and
very good and very sensitive. I make a clear
distinction between the American people
and those in power who make decisions. If
the North American people could know
how people have to live in El Salvador, the
poverty.
My feeling is that in the long run what is
going to save the people of El Salvador is the

people of the United States. Once they be
come aware of how people have to live there
— here people get tired of clothes, get tired
of shoes they just throw it out. There you
keep patching and patching and patching
until you don't even have the original mate
rial left. You just have something made out
of patches.
The people of one country have to help
the people of another country. In this day
when the technology has become so sophis
ticated, it is unjust when that technology is
used to kill people, and to harass them and to
destroy them, rather than being used for the
betterment of all mankind.
Daily: How about a negotiated settlement
between the leftists and the government? Is
it possible that the elections will restore peo
ple's faith in the government and lead to a
peaceful solution?
Santa Maria: The people in El Salvador
now don't believe in elections. The people
have been going through elections for many
years, trying to get their freedom back dem
ocratically. But now, the people have per
ceived that they cannot elect the president,
its impossible. How can we have elections
today when there are a lot of fighters in all of
El Salvador, in all the country? All the can
didates, all of them are right-wing. There is
no other party, all of them are from the right.
One of them is General Medrano. He was
founder of ORDEN, a paramilitary organiza
tion. He had training in Vietnam. He was
trained in the last war between El Salvador
and Honduras. He is very criminal. How can
people believe him? It is impossible.
I would make an appeal to the North
American people not to let this sort of thing
in El Salvador continue, the kind of killing
that is going on. People in El Salvador would
like to live like this. They would like to have
windows made of glass, they would like to be
able to walk in the streets, go where they
want, be able to talk without being taken
prisoner. The difference between El
Salvador and here is very great and I would
like people to appreciate that by helping
Salvadoreans have that kind of freedom too.
Daily: So what is your outlook for the
future? Can the revolution be successful?

Santa Maria: Now or tomorrow or some
day, because the fight is just, the govern
ment will not win. It will be the people. The
government can't win because it's a rotten
government and it's corrupt. The people
have the reason to win the war.
In 1932, the government represented by
Martinez killed 32,000 farm workers. Then
who helped him? Same problem today. Back
then, Fidel Castro was just a little baby. Today
there are 32,000 people killed by the military
in two years, since 1980. All of these move
ments in all of Latin America are going to
happen, because it's needed, all the way up
to the Andes, all the way through Mexico.
It's going to be one after the other, because
it's the same problem everywhere, injustice,
brutality, repression, poverty ... injustice!

looked for my son, with my husband, rny
brother, my sister, my youngest son. When
the newspaper had news of somebody
dying, in the morgue in the street... if the
newspaper told that person was 20 years old
or had the characteristics of my son, I have to
look. I have to looking for my son. But never
I could found him. Many of the intelligensia
helped, because the government killed the
intelligent. The government is afraid of the
intelligent people.
Two months after my son disappeared I
went to the American Embassy about my

'My feeling h that in the long
run what is going to save the
people of El Salvador is the
people of the United States.
Once they become aware of
the suffering in El Salvador it
is they who will be able to
help El Salvador/

son. They were very sympathetic. They
promised me to help. They said you have to
be fast because your son is tied up on the
second floor of the National Guard building,
incommunicado. It was very dangerous for
the person at the embassy to tell me this. I
promised him to never tell it, but now I
broke my promise. But I won't give you his
name. He was very sympathetic and wanted
to help me, but it didn't work out.
In 1980, after they killed Monsigneur
Romero(Archbishop Romero)on March 24,
they killed my brother. He was a medical
doctor. He was very lovely with teachers,
children, young people. He was mayor for
two periods in San Miguel.
In my country, now, 2 million people they
have a reason for killing. Only wearing ten
nis shoes and blue jeans, and the military
forces say, "this is guerilla, let's kill him."
Daily:El Salvador has a very stratified so
cio-economic structure. How directly is this
related to El Salvador's problems?
Santa Maria: Sixty-five percent of
Salvadoreans do farm work, but no farmers
work like in the United States. Farmers wear
in my country no shoes, only wear raggedy
clothes, only hat, no food, a small house. A
lot of children drink no milk. The economy
in my country is very agricultural. Work
men work very hard, but get no salary.
They only get about four or five pounds of
the coffee they harvest. Sixty percent are
working very hard for the rich, not for them
selves.

Thirteen families own the land, banks,
business, industries, everything — only 13
families. These families are indifferent to the
suffering of the people. Now these families
are in Miami, Fla. When they want money,
they take it out of banks in Switzerland or the
United States. But a lot of people in El
Salvador are hungry, no food, no house, no
education. This is a Basque problem in my
country, not communist. Anybody can read
Karl Marx. The military forces come to your
house and rob and steal and whatever they
want. They are unjust and they are cruel and
for 50 years we have been living under this
kind of military rule.
Now some of the farmers are supporting
the guerilla movement because their other
choice is to die of hunger. They want a better

way of life. The farmers union they tried to
organize is now outlawed. The union started
to form five years ago but it't not working
under color of law because the law says the
farmers are not entitled to organize or form a
union. But they have been doing it clan
destinely. The farm workers are raising their
hands now. They are preferring die or live.
Injustice! Too much. They have only two
choices, die or fight for their life. Young peo
ple too. Being young in El Salvador is very
dangerous — reason to be killed.
People in my country who are still produc
tive have fled the country because they are
being killed. They are in exile or they're
abroad or they come to the United States.
Part of the problem of Latin America is that
we are so dependent on this economy.
Daily: So is the guerilla movement made
up entirely of peasant farmers? What kind of
people are now actually working against the
government?
Santa Maria: All the people. Since last year,
the University closed, 1980. The preparatory
school, closed. Everyone has converted to
being a guerilla, all levels of life. Enrique
Alvarez was a man from my country who was
a millionaire. His family had been very
wealthy for several generations and he
joined the movement himself and they killed
him last year. He went over and joined the
FDR (Democratic Revolutionary Front). He
organized the hacienda that he owned, or
ganized the workers then went over to the
FDR, but then they assassinated him, De
cember of 1980. The ex-minister of educa
tion left the junta and then went over to an
other guerilla group himself and made an
announcement he was leaving the junta.
The FDR are a representative organization
of every people in El Salvador. Business peo
ple, university people, campes/nos, every
level. (The FDR now represents 90 percent of
the Salvadorean people). There are four
groups together now, strong. Before they
were separate but with the same objective.
Now, together.
Daily: How do you react to the fact of U.S.
military aid and the presence of U.S. military
advisors in your country?
Santa Maria: I want to be very clear and tell
you that it bothers me a lot that this country

sends money to El Salvador to destroy a peo
ple that is just a very simple, humble people.
If you knew what helicopters do when they
pass over the land. They destroy everything.
They don't leave anything, not even trails.
This country is so rich and the fact that its
doing that to El Salvador is something that
makes me feel bad.
I've met a lot of American people since
I've been here who've been very kind and
very good and very sensitive. I make a clear
distinction between the American people
and those in power who make decisions. If
the North American people could know
how people have to live in El Salvador, the
poverty.
My feeling is that in the long run what is
going to save the people of El Salvador is the

people of the United States. Once they be
come aware of how people have to live there
— here people get tired of clothes, get tired
of shoes they just throw it out. There you
keep patching and patching and patching
until you don't even have the original mate
rial left. You just have something made out
of patches.
The people of one country have to help
the people of another country. In this day
when the technology has become so sophis
ticated, it is unjust when that technology is
used to kill people, and to harass them and to
destroy them, rather than being used for the
betterment of all mankind.
Daily: How about a negotiated settlement
between the leftists and the government? Is
it possible that the elections will restore peo
ple's faith in the government and lead to a
peaceful solution?
Santa Maria: The people in El Salvador
now don't believe in elections. The people
have been going through elections for many
years, trying to get their freedom back dem
ocratically. But now, the people have per
ceived that they cannot elect the president,
its impossible. How can we have elections
today when there are a lot of fighters in all of
El Salvador, in all the country? All the can
didates, all of them are right-wing. There is
no other party, all of them are from the right.
One of them is General Medrano. He was
founder of ORDEN, a paramilitary organiza
tion. He had training in Vietnam. He was
trained in the last war between El Salvador
and Honduras. He is very criminal. How can
people believe him? It is impossible.
I would make an appeal to the North
American people not to let this sort of thing
in El Salvador continue, the kind of killing
that is going on. People in El Salvador would
like to live like this. They would like to have
windows made of glass, they would like to be
able to walk in the streets, go where they
want, be able to talk without being taken
prisoner. The difference between El
Salvador and here is very great and I would
like people to appreciate that by helping
Salvadoreans have that kind of freedom too.
Daily: So what is your outlook for the
future? Can the revolution be successful?

Santa Maria: Now or tomorrow or some
day, because the fight is just, the govern
ment will not win. It will be the people. The
government can't win because it's a rotten
government and it's corrupt. The people
have the reason to win the war.
In 1932, the government represented by
Martinez killed 32,000 farm workers. Then
who helped him? Same problem today. Back
then, Fidel Castro was just a little baby. Today
there are 32,000 people killed by the military
in two years, since 1980. All of these move
ments in all of Latin America are going to
happen, because it's needed, all the way up
to the Andes, all the way through Mexico.
It's going to be one after the other, because
it's the same problem everywhere, injustice,
brutality, repression, poverty ... injustice!

Delia Santa Maria escaped from El
Salvador with her youngest son, Jose Rivera,
in September of last year. Santa Maria, who
was a school teacher in San Miguel, is a 40ish
woman, well built and strong. Her English
was broken but we communicated well with
the help of a translator. She was an animated
speaker, gesturing frequently, and the con
viction in her voice belied the personal trag
edies she had suffered.
She agreed to talk on a Saturday as her
weekdays are spent looking for work. She
and her son live in a church on Diamond St.,
near the Mission District. She offered her
own political perspective, describing El
Salvador's problems from the point of view

I live because I left my
country. If I not leave my
country in 1981J would
have been killed. Every
teacher leader was killed. In
classrooms/m
front of children, sometimes
many children were killed
also.. .in class. All the

of a woman distressed by what is happening
around her. She spoke at length about her
personal experiences — her story is not
always a pleasant one. But the thing she
always came back to is her belief in the peo
ple of this country — her faith that it is the
American people who could reverse the U.S.
government's policy toward her country.
What follows is a transcription of our con
versation that afternoon.
Daily: What was life like in El Salavador
and what were your reasons for leaving?
Delia Santa Maria: My life in El Salvador, it
was wonderful sometimes. I was a teacher
for 30 years. In my profession, my life was
wonderful, but in the government — no. I
helped to found a union of teachers, in 1964
it began — a strong union. Every teacher, ev

ery educator organized at every level to start
the union.
Every teacher fights for social service and
better salary and especially for dignity. If the
president falls, that is if there is a coup, when
the new so-called president comes in he de
mands the teachers to sign a loyalty oath.
Some teachers never sign. I never signed, no.
My major problem with the government in
my country was that I formed a union of
teachers. I formed a part of a committee
whose people were murdered and disap
peared.
For a long time, the teachers and me in my
country fight, fight for everything to teach.
In 1972 was our first strike. A lot of people
supported us, the university, the Catholic
Church, business and other unions too all
supported our strike. The government killed
two people, workers. They took off their
skin, decapitated them. For 60 days, the
teachers were on strike, but when our union
saw the bodies destroyed like this, it stopped
the strike, everything changed.
I lived because I left my country. If I not
leave my country in 1981,1 would have been
killed. Every teacher leader was killed. In
classrooms, sometimes many children were
killed also — in class. All the young teachers
— decapitated. In a city of my country they
hung the heads outside on the points of a
fence.
In the city of San Miguel, where I lived, in a
school they killed 15 children. They were 12
and 15 years old, two girls the rest boys. They
killed every one. They were playing soccer in
the playground. The military forces came
there, put in a line 15 children and one, one,
one killed them. After they killed everybody
they dragged the bodies around the building
and wrote using their blood — the military
forces their fingers — "Communistas." The
killing of Communists, the children.
It was March 8 in 1979, this killing. After
the killing, they brought the dead bodies to a
morgue and there were so many children
there that when the mothers claimed the
bodies to take them for burial the mothers —
all the mothers — were crying and screaming
and very upset. They were afraid that more
children would die in San Miguel. I don't be
lieve it. I saw it but don't believe.
Daily: You managed to escape here to the
United States with your youngest son, what
about the rest of your family?
Santa Maria: My oldest son disappeared
on Oct. 9,1976. He was 22 years old. He was a
technical engineer — mechanical and elec

trical and communications. For five years I
looked for my son, with my husband, rny
brother, my sister, my youngest son. When
the newspaper had news of somebody
dying, in the morgue in the street... if the
newspaper told that person was 20 years old
or had the characteristics of my son, I have to
look. I have to looking for my son. But never

organized the hacienda that he owned, or
ganized the workers then went over to the
FDR, but then they assassinated him, De
cember of 1980. The ex-minister of educa
tion left the junta and then went over to an
other guerilla group himself and made an
announcement he was leaving the junta.
The FDR are a representative organization
of every people in El Salvador. Business peo
ple, university people, campes/nos, every
level. (The FDR now represents 90 percent of
the Salvadorean people). There are four
groups together now, strong. Before they
were separate but with the same objective.
Now, together.
Daily: How do you react to the fact of U.S.
military aid and the presence of U.S. military
advisors in your country?
Santa Maria: I want to be very clear and tell
you that it bothers me a lot that this country

sends money to El Salvador to destroy a peo
ple that is just a very simple, humble people.
If you knew what helicopters do when they
pass over the land. They destroy everything.
They don't leave anything, not even trails.
This country is so rich and the fact that its
doing that to El Salvador is something that
makes me feel bad.
I've met a lot of American people since
I've been here who've been very kind and
very good and very sensitive. I make a clear
distinction between the American people
and those in power who make decisions. If
the North American people could know
how people have to live in El Salvador, the
poverty.
My feeling is that in the long run what is
going to save the people of El Salvador is the

people of the United States. Once they be
come aware of how people have to live there
— here people get tired of clothes, get tired
of shoes they just throw it out. There you
keep patching and patching and patching
until you don't even have the original mate
rial left. You just have something made out
of patches.
The people of one country have to help
the people of another country. In this day
when the technology has become so sophis
ticated, it is unjust when that technology is
used to kill people, and to harass them and to
destroy them, rather than being used for the
betterment of all mankind.
Daily: How about a negotiated settlement
between the leftists and the government? Is
it possible that the elections will restore peo
ple's faith in the government and lead to a
peaceful solution?
Santa Maria: The people in El Salvador
now don't believe in elections. The people
have been going through elections for many
years, trying to get their freedom back dem
ocratically. But now, the people have per
ceived that they cannot elect the president,
its impossible. How can we have elections
today when there are a lot of fighters in all of
El Salvador, in all the country? All the can
didates, all of them are right-wing. There is
no other party, all of them are from the right.
One of them is General Medrano. He was
founder of ORDEN, a paramilitary organiza
tion. He had training in Vietnam. He was
trained in the last war between El Salvador
and Honduras. He is very criminal. How can
people believe him? It is impossible.
I would make an appeal to the North
American people not to let this sort of thing
in El Salvador continue, the kind of killing
that is going on. People in El Salvador would
like to live like this. They would like to have
windows made of glass, they would like to be
able to walk in the streets, go where they
want, be able to talk without being taken
prisoner. The difference between El
Salvador and here is very great and I would
like people to appreciate that by helping
Salvadoreans have that kind of freedom too.
Daily: So what is your outlook for the
future? Can the revolution be successful?

Santa Maria: Now or tomorrow or some
day, because the fight is just, the govern
ment will not win. It will be the people. The
government can't win because it's a rotten
government and it's corrupt. The people
have the reason to win the war.
In 1932, the government represented by
Martinez killed 32,000 farm workers. Then
who helped him? Same problem today. Back
then, Fidel Castro was just a little baby. Today
there are 32,000 people killed by the military
in two years, since 1980. All of these move
ments in all of Latin America are going to
happen, because it's needed, all the way up
to the Andes, all the way through Mexico.
It's going to be one after the other, because
it's the same problem everywhere, injustice,
brutality, repression, poverty ... injustice!


David Chen/Daily

Delia Santa Maria escaped from El
Salvador with her youngest son, Jose Rivera,
in September of last year. Santa Maria, who
was a school teacher in San Miguel, is a 40ish
woman, well built and strong. Her English
was broken but we communicated well with
the help of a translator. She was an animated
speaker, gesturing frequently, and the con
viction in her voice belied the personal trag
edies she had suffered.
She agreed to talk on a Saturday as her
weekdays are spent looking for work. She
and her son live in a church on Diamond St.,
near the Mission District. She offered her
own political perspective, describing El
Salvador's problems from the point of view

I live because I left my
country. If I not leave my
country in 1981J would
have been killed. Every
teacher leader was killed. In
classrooms/m
front of children, sometimes
many children were killed
also.. .in class. All the
young teachers...
decapitated. In a city of my
country they hung the heads
outside on the points of a
fence.

of a woman distressed by what is happening
around her. She spoke at length about her
personal experiences — her story is not
always a pleasant one. But the thing she
always came back to is her belief in the peo
ple of this country — her faith that it is the
American people who could reverse the U.S.
government's policy toward her country.
What follows is a transcription of our con
versation that afternoon.
Daily: What was life like in El Salavador
and what were your reasons for leaving?
Delia Santa Maria: My life in El Salvador, it
was wonderful sometimes. I was a teacher
for 30 years. In my profession, my life was
wonderful, but in the government — no. I
helped to found a union of teachers, in 1964
it began — a strong union. Every teacher, ev

ery educator organized at every level to start
the union.
Every teacher fights for social service and
better salary and especially for dignity. If the
president falls, that is if there is a coup, when
the new so-called president comes in he de
mands the teachers to sign a loyalty oath.
Some teachers never sign. I never signed, no.
My major problem with the government in
my country was that I formed a union of
teachers. I formed a part of a committee
whose people were murdered and disap
peared.
For a long time, the teachers and me in my
country fight, fight for everything to teach.
In 1972 was our first strike. A lot of people
supported us, the university, the Catholic
Church, business and other unions too all
supported our strike. The government killed
two people, workers. They took off their
skin, decapitated them. For 60 days, the
teachers were on strike, but when our union
saw the bodies destroyed like this, it stopped
the strike, everything changed.
I lived because I left my country. If I not
leave my country in 1981,1 would have been
killed. Every teacher leader was killed. In
classrooms, sometimes many children were
killed also — in class. All the young teachers
— decapitated. In a city of my country they
hung the heads outside on the points of a
fence.
In the city of San Miguel, where I lived, in a
school they killed 15 children. They were 12
and 15 years old, two girls the rest boys. They
killed every one. They were playing soccer in
the playground. The military forces came
there, put in a line 15 children and one, one,
one killed them. After they killed everybody
they dragged the bodies around the building
and wrote using their blood — the military
forces their fingers — "Communistas." The
killing of Communists, the children.
It was March 8 in 1979, this killing. After
the killing, they brought the dead bodies to a
morgue and there were so many children
there that when the mothers claimed the
bodies to take them for burial the mothers —
all the mothers — were crying and screaming
and very upset. They were afraid that more
children would die in San Miguel. I don't be
lieve it. I saw it but don't believe.
Daily: You managed to escape here to the
United States with your youngest son, what
about the rest of your family?
Santa Maria: My oldest son disappeared
on Oct. 9,1976. He was 22 years old. He was a
technical engineer — mechanical and elec

trical and communications. For five years I
looked for my son, with my husband, rny
brother, my sister, my youngest son. When
the newspaper had news of somebody
dying, in the morgue in the street... if the
newspaper told that person was 20 years old
or had the characteristics of my son, I have to
look. I have to looking for my son. But never
I could found him. Many of the intelligensia
helped, because the government killed the
intelligent. The government is afraid of the
intelligent people.
Two months after my son disappeared I
went to the American Embassy about my

'My feeling h that in the long
run what is going to save the
people of El Salvador is the
people of the United States.
Once they become aware of
the suffering in El Salvador it
is they who will be able to
help El Salvador/

son. They were very sympathetic. They
promised me to help. They said you have to
be fast because your son is tied up on the
second floor of the National Guard building,
incommunicado. It was very dangerous for
the person at the embassy to tell me this. I
promised him to never tell it, but now I
broke my promise. But I won't give you his
name. He was very sympathetic and wanted
to help me, but it didn't work out.
In 1980, after they killed Monsigneur
Romero(Archbishop Romero)on March 24,
they killed my brother. He was a medical
doctor. He was very lovely with teachers,
children, young people. He was mayor for
two periods in San Miguel.
In my country, now, 2 million people they
have a reason for killing. Only wearing ten
nis shoes and blue jeans, and the military
forces say, "this is guerilla, let's kill him."
Daily:El Salvador has a very stratified so
cio-economic structure. How directly is this
related to El Salvador's problems?
Santa Maria: Sixty-five percent of
Salvadoreans do farm work, but no farmers
work like in the United States. Farmers wear
in my country no shoes, only wear raggedy
clothes, only hat, no food, a small house. A
lot of children drink no milk. The economy
in my country is very agricultural. Work
men work very hard, but get no salary.
They only get about four or five pounds of
the coffee they harvest. Sixty percent are
working very hard for the rich, not for them
selves.

Thirteen families own the land, banks,
business, industries, everything — only 13
families. These families are indifferent to the
suffering of the people. Now these families
are in Miami, Fla. When they want money,
they take it out of banks in Switzerland or the
United States. But a lot of people in El
Salvador are hungry, no food, no house, no
education. This is a Basque problem in my
country, not communist. Anybody can read
Karl Marx. The military forces come to your
house and rob and steal and whatever they
want. They are unjust and they are cruel and
for 50 years we have been living under this
kind of military rule.
Now some of the farmers are supporting
the guerilla movement because their other
choice is to die of hunger. They want a better

way of life. The farmers union they tried to
organize is now outlawed. The union started
to form five years ago but it't not working
under color of law because the law says the
farmers are not entitled to organize or form a
union. But they have been doing it clan
destinely. The farm workers are raising their
hands now. They are preferring die or live.
Injustice! Too much. They have only two
choices, die or fight for their life. Young peo
ple too. Being young in El Salvador is very
dangerous — reason to be killed.
People in my country who are still produc
tive have fled the country because they are
being killed. They are in exile or they're
abroad or they come to the United States.
Part of the problem of Latin America is that
we are so dependent on this economy.
Daily: So is the guerilla movement made
up entirely of peasant farmers? What kind of
people are now actually working against the
government?
Santa Maria: All the people. Since last year,
the University closed, 1980. The preparatory
school, closed. Everyone has converted to
being a guerilla, all levels of life. Enrique
Alvarez was a man from my country who was
a millionaire. His family had been very
wealthy for several generations and he
joined the movement himself and they killed
him last year. He went over and joined the
FDR (Democratic Revolutionary Front). He
organized the hacienda that he owned, or
ganized the workers then went over to the
FDR, but then they assassinated him, De
cember of 1980. The ex-minister of educa
tion left the junta and then went over to an
other guerilla group himself and made an
announcement he was leaving the junta.
The FDR are a representative organization
of every people in El Salvador. Business peo
ple, university people, campes/nos, every
level. (The FDR now represents 90 percent of
the Salvadorean people). There are four
groups together now, strong. Before they
were separate but with the same objective.
Now, together.
Daily: How do you react to the fact of U.S.
military aid and the presence of U.S. military
advisors in your country?
Santa Maria: I want to be very clear and tell
you that it bothers me a lot that this country

If you knew what helicopters do when they

to the Andes, all the way through Mexico.
It's going to be one after the other, because
it's the same problem everywhere, injustice,
brutality, repression, poverty ... injustice!
