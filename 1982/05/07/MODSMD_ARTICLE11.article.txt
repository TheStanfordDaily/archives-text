# Stanford in Washington: The University's
## 
### Samuel Howe 
Washington Stanford
President Donald Kennedy
usually runs the Dish on
Tuesday mornings, but not on this
particular Tuesday April 20. Still, the
president of the University, even 3000
miles away fronTcampus in the nation's
capital, is on the run.
This Tuesday is one of the dozen or
more days annually that Kennedy says
he spends either lobbying or testifying
on behalf of the University in
Washington. Before him he has a busy
schedule of meetings with members of
Congress, other university presidents,
representatives of educational
organizations based here and a
reporter from The Washington Post, as
well as a dinner hosted by California
universities for the state's congressional
delegation.
Kennedy is not alone in Washington.
A team of administrators at Stanford is
also here, and will be engaged in
meetings and lobbying efforts of their
own. They work for Stanford's Office of
Public Affairs, and itistheir jobto
represent the University's interests to
congressmen, agency officials,
reporters and anyone else of
importance who will listen.
Those who work closely with the
University in legislative battles and
those who oppose it most bitterly agree
on at least one thing Stanford's
government relations program is one of
the most effective in the country, and it
is only strengthened by the political
skill of Kennedy.
Nan Wells, Princeton's director of
government relations, says Stanford's
government relations team is"the best
in thecountry."
Although the University does not
maintain an office in Washington, it has
two officials who work virtually full time
on federal matters, and a third who
generally divides her time between
state and federal issues.
Stanford's director of government
relations, Larry Horton, is both
energeticand persistent. In
Washington, he, like Kennedy, isa man
on the run especially in the halls of
the Capitol building. He makes brief
stops all over, checking up on contacts,
providing answers to questions, telling
a joke or two to maintain the political
acquaintances that, in Washington, can
have a funny way of making the
difference between defeat and victory
on a key vote.
Robert Freelen, the associate vice
president for public affairs, works more
or less interchangeably with Horton on
government relations. Robert
Rosenzweig, the vice president for
public affairs, also spends a great deal of
time on federal matters, but he retains
many other obligations within the
University and, like Kennedy, tends to

spend a more concentrated amount of
time in Washington.
"One of the great ironies of
advocacy," says Freelen, is that it has
such a bad name, but the one quality
which you have to have consistently is
honesty. If you don't provide accurate
information or withhold it, then you
have used up your goodwill.. . Once
you have shaded the truth or lied, you
don't have access to that individual
anymore."
What is involved is a careful and well
documented plea for whatever the
interests of the University happen to be.
"We must make the case for what we
know best," says Horton. "It's not our
job to tell them (congressmen) how to
make economies. It would be foolish of
us to say, 'You need more MIRVs and
less student aid.' "

AwA uesday, April 20, is another
I beautiful spring day in
JLWashington. A few Cherry
Blossoms are still out, although most
have already done their blooming and
have blown away in a spring storm.
Kennedy has spent the morning at a
Washington hotel finishing up a two
day meeting of the Association of
American Universities, an organization
of the 48 top research universities in the
country, as well as two from Canada.
The meeting is exclusive, even secretive
only presidents and AAU officials are
allowed to attend. But all the presidents
are there: Bok of Harvard, Giamatti of
Yale, Saxon of California, even the only
woman president of the 50, Hannah
Gray of of the University of Chicago.
Horton, meanwhile, continues till the
last minute to make plans for Kennedy's
afternoon visit to Capitol Hill. One part
t of his function is not all that different
from that of the advance man in a
political campaign. However, a greater
part involves his own duties as
spokesman and lobbyistforthe
University.

Horton continually lays the
groundwork for Kennedy's brief visits
to Washington. "With Don, it's not the
quantity of time, but the time is
concentrated and he's awfully
effective." Horton himself estimates
that he makesl2tols or more
trips to the capital per year, and those
visits can last anywhere from a day to a
week.
Around noon, the AAU meeting
breaks up.
It is a 10-minute ride to the Capitol
building. Kennedy answers a few
questions about what he hopes to
accomplish with his afternoon there, but
as the taxicab approaches the building,
he becomes quiet for a few moments.
Politician Kennedy takes a rest, and
Biologist Kennedy goes to work.
Flowers around the Capitol are in
bloom, and he starts identifying them
one by one.
Perhaps what happened at lunch
or didn't happen is instructive about
how Kennedy spends his time in
Washington. Both he and Horton
emphasize that his schedule must be
kept "fluid," because it often will be
changed atthe last minute. While
Horton says he never schedules two
meetings at the same time, he usually
does make some tentative
appointments in case a scheduled one
is changed. "It's all free-form back
here," says Kennedy. "There is just a lot
of free wheeling."
Congressman Tom Lantos, who
under redistricting would represent
Stanford if he is reelected this fall, has
invited us to lunch in the congressional
dining hall. But atthe last moment, he
has been called to the White House to
be in a ceremony commemorating the
Holocaust.
Thus, the president of the United
States has intervened to change our fine
cuisine with "Members only" to a tuna
fish sandwich with "Staff aides only" in
the basement coffee shop. Kennedy
and Horton take it in stride, however
they say that similar twists of fate often
land them meetings with key politicians
they did not expect to be able to see.
At 1:25, we are ushered into the
office of Congressman Neal Smith of
lowa. Smith is back in the state, so
Kennedy meets with his senior
legislative aide, Tom Dawson. It is
relatively rare for Kennedy to meet with
a staff aide rather than the congressman
himself, and the rest of the day's
meetings are in fact with members of
Congress.
But Horton points out that meeting
with staff can be at least as effective as
meeting with members themselves
because the staff usually advise their
bosses on the merits of bills anyway. For
that reason, Horton says, he often takes
any time that's needed with
Congressional staff, no matter how far
down the rungs of the ladder, to

convince them of the merits of a
Stanford position.
According to Kennedy, "In a normal
situation, I'm askingforsomething."
On this day he certainly is, asking Smith
to watch the wording of a committee
bill pertaining to indirect cost recover)
a major concern to Stanford.
Shortly after quarter of three,
Kennedy meets Washington Post
science reporter Cristine Russell
outside the House office building .
At 3:15, a meeting is scheduled
Pete McCloskey, in whose district TO
University now lies. McCloskey's
campaign for the U.S. Senate has put
him on a punishing schedule involving
long weekends of campaigning in
California and midweek returnsfor
business to Washington. If he is tired,
he doesn't really show it as he bounds
up from his desk to welcome Kennedy
"Don, I'm here to listen to you," say;
McCloskey, but he asks him a question
about the Stanford baseball team first.
McCloskey was on the varsity himself a
a Stanford undergraduate.
Kennedy and Horton have a specific
item for the McCloskey agenda. The
congressman has led the crusade
against the House Small Business
