# government relations team goes to work on Capitol Hill
## 
### 
Innovation Development Act, a bill
which the University strongly opposes
on the grounds it will create a wasteful
set-aside program and will needlessly
divert funds from basic research which
is conducted at the universities. "Pete,
what should we be doing? What are our
chances?," Kennedy asks.
The two discuss strategy for awhile.
McCloskey has recently sent out a
"Dear Colleague" letter to all members
of the House explaining his opposition.
Soon enough, the topic comes around
to House Speaker Tip O'Neill's position
on the bill. O'Neill is in a difficult
position because his district in
Massachusetts includes Harvard, MIT
and Tufts, who all oppose the bill, and
the Small Business Association of New
England, a leading proponent.
"Hey, I've got an old friend who
knows Tip pretty well," says
McCloskey. An old Kennedy guy

they used to spend summers together at
Hyannisport... Let me see if he can
speak to Tip."
A few minutes later, the friend is on
the line. "Hello Badger," McCloskey
booms into the phone. "Howya doin'?
Look, let me talk to you about
somethingfora few minutes...

McCloskey goes into a brief summary
of the bill, and the reasons that he
opposes it. "Could you let me know
what Tip thinks?," he asks. The hope is
that even if O'Neill won't come out
against the bill, he will at least lie low on
it.
After a meeting with a Massachusetts
congressman on indirect costs, Horton
and Kennedy press on for a 5 o'clock
meeting in the Senate Office Building
with Missouri Sen. Tom Eagleton. Again
the subject is indirect cost recovery
Eagleton, as a chair of the human
relations subcommittee of the
appropriations commitee, wields
immense power to affect the outcome
of the indirect cost debate.
As Kennedy's goesthrough an
explanation of how he believes the
failure to recover indirect costs in full
could drive University expenses even
beyond the amount lost or
significantly decrease the amount of
research done on campus Eagleton
shakes his head. "I just don't know,
Don, you're going too fast for me. But
I'll believe it if you say it."
At 6 o'clock, Kennedy and Horton are
back on the House side of Capitol Hill,
and Stanford along with the

University of California, Cal Tech and
USC is playing host to members of
Congress from California. Although a
few noticeables (McCloskey, as well as
both senators) are unable to attend,
administrators from the school
enthusiastically welcome those who
have shown up. After dinner, it is
Kennedy who rises to lead a discussion.
Above all, the president of Stanford is
taking the role of the conciliator. "How
can we work together?" and "What can
we do to improve communication?"
are the themes of Kennedy's
presentation.
California's congressman and
California's university presidents talk
on until the conversation fragments
into a series of individual discussions. It
is time, anyway, for President Kennedy
and Vice President Robert Rosenzweig
to push on theyare barely on
schedule for a flight to New York and an
8 a.m. foundation breakfast the next
morning. Both Horton and Freelen are
to remain in Washington, forthere is
always more work to be done here.
There will be more meetings, more
phone calls, more letters.. .
Although Stanford's four leading
spokesmen in Washington have spent

the past few days laying out their
concerns and cornering the right
people, the University's voice can never
be quite loud enough.
