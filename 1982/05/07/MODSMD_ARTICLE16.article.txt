# Other governments: Sacramento, Palo Alto affect University
##

University involvement with
state and local governments,
overshadowed lately by
controversy surrounding federal
financial support and federal limits on
research, is "at least as important as its
involvement with the federal
government," according to Larry
Horton, director of government
relations here.
Campus awareness of the state
government was heightened last month
when a committee of the state Senate
recommended passage of a bill
vehemently opposed by the University
administration. Senate Bill 1438 would
abolish the sellingof animals from
pounds to research facilities such as the
Stanford Hospital. Passage of the bill
could precipitate a major decline in
animal research activity here,
University researchers claim, as the
University would be forced to buy
animals from private breeders.
Many have lauded the bill as a major
step toward halting what they see as
needless cruelty to animals in research
facilities, and entertainment stars such
as Loretta Switt testified against the bill
when it was introduced to the state
Senate. Administrators here, on the
other hand, say the research is critical
forthe study ofthe prevention of illness
and for increased scientific knowledge.

Battle lines thus have been drawn for
the continuing fight over the bill, which
still must pass one more committee and
the floor of the Senate, and two
committees and the floor in the
Assembly.
Whatever the bill's fate, it has served
to focus the University's attention back
on the state government. Local
goverments, too, can have a serious
effect on University affairs. The Palo
Alto City Council's adamant stand two
years ago against further
industrialization of four acres of land on
Arastradero Road has caused the
University to let the land lay idle.
Local policy, coupled with state
government action such as the animal
research bill, have spotlighted the role
of the Office of Public Affairs here,
which carefully monitors state
legislation and works closely with the
Palo Alto City Council and Santa Clara
County. Horton and Jacyn Mitchell,
legislative analyst, said they are closely
watching 119 state bills either in
committee or waiting to be introduced.
The key to understanding the
University's involvement with-
California government, according to
Horton, is to understand how the state

government differs from the federal
government. The California legislature
passes 46 percent of the bills it
considers, compared to the federal
government's miserly 4 percent.
"The state legislature does just that
legislate," said Horton.
The state enacted 2586 bills last year,
compared to Congress' 613. As a result,
the University has more bills to coddle
and more to prevent.
Unfortunatelyforthe University,
more bills are on its prevention list than
on its approval list.Sixty to 70 of the bills
Horton and Mitchell are monitoring are
medical service or reform bills which
would change Stanford Hospital policy.

Hospital officials are particularly
concerned about bills which may affect
the the complicated process which
determines MediCal reimbursement
levels for patient care. Many other bills,
such as the animal research bill, could
also cause substantial financial loss to
the University.
There is only one major bill which the
University is supporting: a piece of ,
legislation which would increase the
amount of bonds issued by state offices.
The apparatus responsible for those
2586 bills is a two-house legislature
which differs from Congress in one vital
aspect theauthorof a bill may
support the bill during committee
hearings and even on the floor vote in
the house of which he isa member. He
may testify for his bill and amend it at a
wave of his hand, and, if that senatoror
assemblyman happens to be a
particularly adroit back-scratcher, he
can count on widespread support for a
bill if he is willing to compromise.
Often th-s process causes bills to
acquire support thatthey would not
otherwise have, according to Horton. A
case in point, Horton claimed, isthe
animal research bill. A similar bill was
defeated overwhelmingly two years
ago in its first committee vote, but this

bill has unusual support in the person of
state Sen. David Roberti (D-L.A.),
senate president pro tern, who began
pushingthe bill earlierthisyear.
That particular bill isalsoastudyin
how the University mobilizes its
lobbying efforts. Having received the
bill, the University took the following
steps:
• Horton and Mitchell distributed
copies of the bill to various
administrative offices and faculty
members to determine the University's
official response to it. The consensus
was that the faculty was opposed to the
bill.
• Letters from faculty members and
from Mitchell were sent to
assemblymen and senators urgingthem
to voteagainstthe bill.
• The University's lobbyists were
notified of its stand against bill.
Lobbying efforts in Sacramento are
concentrated in the Association of
Independent California Colleges and
Universities (AICCU) and the University
of California lobbyists.
• Horton and other lobbyists met with
senators and assemblymen and
presented their arguments against the
bill.

• Committee hearings were held. The
University has offered to have a
professor testify before the committee
if necessary, although nobody has been
asked so far.
• The bill passed its first committee,
but the University's lobbying efforts will
follow it through future committees
and floor votes, continually lobbying to
prevent its passage.
The study of the University's
involvement with the Palo Alto
City Council will reveal an
attempt to reconcile University land use
policy with Palo Alto's goal of stopping
growth except if it entails building more
housing in the area, according to Andy
Doty, University director of community
relations.

Doty said a similar study involving
Palo Alto and Santa Clara County would
reveal a history of attempts to reconcile
city policy with county goals.
Asa result of this potentially
explosive situation, Doty has become a
self-described "sensitive antennae,"
carefully tuned to community response
to University policy.
And the area to which Doty devotes
the most attention is land use policy,
prompted by the University's
ownership of 8100 acres of land, the
largest private holding on the San

Francisco Peninsula.
The ownership of this land was not
always a problem, however, said Doty.
In the early 1950'5, when both the
University and Palo Alto were small and
in need of money, a leasing agreement
was arranged between the two which
put an industrial park, a shopping
center and a professional center on
University land.
During the mid-19605, however, this
situation of mutual benefit became a
major headache for the city because it
developed what it calls a jobs-housing
imbalance. The office buildings caused
a large influx of workers into the area
during the day, but there was no
housing for them. Traffic problems as
well as complaints from many local
merchants caused the city to push for
more housing developments and clamp
down on industrial developments.

The Arastradero Road case is an
example of this desire. Syntex, a
corporation which leases land near
Gunn High School south of campus,
wanted to expand into a then-unused
four-acre parcel of University land. The
City Council conceded on condition
that Syntex agree to either build a
complementary group of housing units
or pay a fee so that the city could build
more housing. Syntex agreed, but the
University Board of Trustees, after a

financial analysis, decided that the land
wasn't suitable for housing. The land
has not been used since then.
Doty's job, then, is to see that he
pleases as many people as possible,
including, of course, University
officials.
That job was made a bit more difficult
recently because of a controversy
involving the use of land on Quarry
Road between the Arboretum and the
Stanford Shopping Center. The
University considered the land
available for expansion of the Shopping
Center parking lot. The City Council,
however, preferred that the land not be
used and asked the Santa Clara County
to designate it as open space. The
University opposed that decision, but
the county decided in favor of Palo
Alto. Now, the University is attempting
to compromise with the city.
This particular issue illustrates how
the University works with the county,
which actually has final say in many
matters because it provides the
University with police and fire service.
Doty works closely with the local
representative to the County Board of
Supervisors, Becky Morgan, and calls
the University's relationship with the
county "quite good."
