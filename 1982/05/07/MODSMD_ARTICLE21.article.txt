# 'Depression' rally protests Reagan policies
## 
### David Azrin 
More than 250 people gathered at
White Plaza yesterday to watch "guer
rilla theater" and listen to speeches and
songs at a noon rally for the Hooverville
'32/Reaganville 'B2 activities this week
end.

Reaganville organizer Scott Summers
told the rally audience, "The location of
the Hoover Institute at Stanford pro
vides a unique way to draw parallels be
tween the Reagan administration's pol
icies and Hoover's policies." The build
ing of the shantytown called "Hoover
ville," a symbol of the Depression years,
will further serve to link the current ec
onomic situation with those of the
19305, he said.
At the rally r six of the people fasting
described their reasons for partici
pating in the three-day fast.
"For us, fasting is a sacrifice, a choice,
a gesture. Butthereare millions of peo
ple in this country for whom fasting is
not a Choice. It's away of life," said Nick
Burbules, a Reaganville organizer.
Lisa Tripp, an 11-year-old Palo Alto
elementary school student, said she is

also participating in a three-day juice
fast.
"I want people to know how strongly
I feel and how I support the freeze,"
Tripp said. "My mother thinks it's fine."
The guerrilla theater, a form of
satirical theater popular in the '6os, was
performed by a number of Stanford stu
dents.
The students satirized the Reagan ad
ministration by portraying them as crew
members of the "U.S.S. Starship Free
Enterprise." In one part of the skit, Dr.
Spockman (Budget Director David
Stockman) noticed that communist in
surgents were approaching the ship.
Captain Jerk (President Ronald Reagan)
immediately called out, "Swerve to the
right." .
Music was provided by a local Palo
Alto high school folk group Somebody
Else's Relatives. The group sang '6os
songs by Bob Dylan as some members
of the audience clapped along.
The Reaganville activities begin to
night with the building of a shantytown
in front of Hoover Tower, music by Soli
darity Singers and a soup line which will

break the fast of 20 students who have
been fasting since Wednesday morn
ing.
The Reaganville activities will focus
on the increase in unemployment, the
Reagan administration's recent cut
backs in social services and the adminis
tration's "militaristic" foreign policy,
said Summers.
"It's going to be kind of a celebration,
a time to get people together to talk to
each other about how Reagan's gov
ernmental and economic policies affect
our lives," said Burbules.
"Progressive students can no longer
allow the Hoover Institute to legitimize
this University and the Reagan adminis
tration's policies with the Insitute. We
must shun our identification with the
Hoover Institute by making our voices
heard," Summers said.
"President Reagan is a second-rate
actor and a salesman. He's trying to sell
us the ideas of the Hoover Institute, and
he's turning them into government pol
icy," said organizer Peter Radcliff. "And
I won't buy it."
"Everytime I look at the Hoover In

stitute and that tower I just get sick to
my stomach," Radcliff said.
Comparing these demonstrations
with those of the '6os, Burbules said,
"The students aren't any different. It's
the circumstances that are different.
Nixon was an easy president to get mad
at and protest against... but Reagan's
policies are much worse, and when we
realize that, we will be able to get angry
again."
The event has been endorsed by U.S.
Rep. Shirley Chisolm (D-New York),
National Democratic Socialist Chair
Michael Harrington, San Fransisco Su
pervisor Harry Britt, political commen
tator Noam Chomsky, the United Cam
pus Christian Ministries, the Santa Clara
Central Labor Council, the Black Stu
dents' Union, the Mid-Peninsula Con
version Project, the Gay Peoples' Union
and United Stanford Workers. Arturo
Pacheco, associate dean of the School
of Education, Richard Fagen, professor
of political science, and Jean Franco,
professor of Spanish and Portuguese,
have also endorsed the event.
