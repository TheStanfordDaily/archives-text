# Walton: Colleges too often fall to educate their star athletes
## 
### Michael Weiss 
At public universities like UCLA, coaches and
academic advisors are more concerned about
student-athletes excelling in their sports than in
their education, according to Bill Walton,
former professional basketball star.
"Because of this, books are just full of players
who are now cleaning up the stadiums that they
once filled," he said.
Walton joined with-former Stanford football
players and current San Francisco 49ers team
mates Milt McColl and Rick Gervais on a panel
discussion last night entitled "Sports After Col
lege; What's in the Future?" The discussion,
sponsored by Rinconada and Otero dorms, was
the last in the four-part series that focused on
college athletics.
Walton said the lengthened college basketball
season, the expanding media coverage and the
scheduling of games nearly every day of the
week has made it more difficult for a college
basketball player to get a good education.
Walton, currently a first-year law student
here, said.he was unique: coming from an aca
demically oriented family, he did not need to be
told to get a good education in college. FHe ma
jored in history and was able to do his work,
mostly reading, while on road trips.
Walton said he is worried about the players on
the other end of the spectrum those who have
no inner sense of the importance of an educa
tion. Many good players come to college not ex
cited about learning, but rather about all the big

money they have been hearing about, he said.
"They come to school expecting this money,
they get offered handouts, they accept them and
then sometimes they get busted for it/' Walton
said.
Walton said he sees college athletics heading
toward a "quasi-professional" situation in which
colleges are paying their athletes and are no
longer pretending to give them an education.
Rick Gervais, currently a fifth-year senior ma
joring in engineering, said getting accustomed
to being treated like a resource which can be
used or discarded at any time was the most dif
ficult part of turning professional.
McColl, a linebacker for the 49ers last season,
said he, like Walton, is worried that "a lot of
football players that come out of college don't
know what to do." McColl himself attended
medical school here during the professional sea
son.
McColl said one of the best weeks of his life
was the week in which he made the 49ers as a
free agent and was also accepted at the Medical
School. "It was the only school that would have
considered letting me play pro football and go
to school at the same time."
He said he worked out a plan with the school
which allowed him to take just one class,
anatomy, during the season. Most of the dissect
ing was done during the day by other medical
students, so he was mostly just observing things
that were already done, he said.
