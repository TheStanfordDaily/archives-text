The task force of warships around the
Falklands started out with only 20 Har
rier jump jets as the main air defense
system for the ships. It has now been re
duced to 17 to contend with Argen
tina's more than 100 American and
French-built jet fighter-bombers.
A Harrier was shot down by Argen
tine anti-aircraft fire Tuesday and the pi
lot killed during a bombing raid on an
airstrip in the Falklands, which were
seized by Argentina from Britain five
weeks ago.
Yesterday's losses mean that the task
force has been deprived of 15 percent
of its jet aircraft.
With the loss of each plane it be
comes "more difficult" for the task
force to mount guard around the ships
and prevent Argentine violation of the
200-mile blockade zone Britain has pro
claimed, a military analyst noted. He
said the two countries were involved in
an "air war of attrition."

Twenty more Harriers are en route to
the fleet aboard a container ship that
left Britain almost two weeks ago and is
expected to reach the vicinity of the
Falklands shortly.
Those 20 Royal Air Force Harriers,
converted for use on the two aircraft
carriers in the fleet, are regarded as es
sential for any invasion of the Falklands
Britain may carry out if diplomacy fails
to achieve the removal of the 6000 to
10,000 Argentine troops from the is
lands.

Argentina demonstrated the vulner
ability of the fleet Tuesday when a Su
per Etendard fighter-bomber avoided
detection by radar or Harriers and de
stroyed the British destroyer HMS Shef
field with an Exocet sea-skimming mis
sile.

The Defense Ministry announced
yesterday that 20 members of the ship's
crew "must now be presumed dead."
Five officers, including two lieutenant
commanders, were among those killed.
Earlier it had been feared that the death
toll was 30.

Another 24 sustained injuries, and
one man was listed in serious condition.
Correspondents on task force ships had
reported earlier that most of those in
jured were suffering burns. The remain
ing 242 crewmen were well and have
been transferred to other ships in the
task force, McDonald said.
As a result of the loss of the Sheffield,
it is believed that the task force has
moved further east of the Falklands to
stay out of range of Argentine planes.
Reagan to propose cuts
in first strike missiles
Washington President Ronald
Reagan is preparing a proposal for
sharp cuts, possibly as much as 50 per
cent, in Soviet and American long
range nuclear striking power to reduce
fears that either nation could launch a
successful first strike on the missile
forces of the other, according to U.S. of
ficials.
The Soviet Union now has some 2700
intercontinental-range missiles and
bombers and the United States just un
der 2000. It is fear of a successful first
strike against the most threatening and
most vulnerable of those forces the
highly accurate land-based missiles
that is at the heart of the nuclear arms
race between the two superpowers.
The idea behind the emerging ad
ministration proposal is to reduce the
overall destructive power of the oppos
ing nuclear arsenals to equal levels. The
remaining forces would be useful in de
terring a nuclear attack and retaliating
in the event a nuclear war started. But
the smaller arsenels would prevent
either nation from launching a stagger
ing first blow.
Budget committee GOPs
suggest tax hike
Washington President Ronald
Reagan and Republicans on the Senate
Budget Committee are proposing $95

billion in new taxes over the next three
years, a target that will require approval
of major new revenue sources.
The Budget Committee can only set
overall revenue and spending goals,
but its chairman, Pete Domenici (R-
N.M.) has identified several major taxes
that could be enacted to reach this goal,
according to aides.
U.S. outlines need
for chemical weapons
Washington The Unitea States
must build new chemical weapons to
redress the "decisive military advan
tage" the Soviets have to wage chemical
war, admininstration officials told the
Senate Appropriations Committee yes
terday.
Contradicting civilian experts who
testified Wednesday, witnesses from
the Defense and State departments said
the U.S. chemical weapons stockpile is
not enough to force the Soviets into "a
deterrent posture" in which they would
be required to put on protective gear
and use decontamination equipment.
The Reagan administration is seeking
$705 million in fiscal 1983, mostly for de
fensive items such as protective equip
ment and troop training.
