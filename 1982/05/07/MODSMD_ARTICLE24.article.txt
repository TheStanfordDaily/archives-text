# Expert says Egyptian internal conflicts slow peace process

Egypt's President Hosni
Mubarak is in an "almost hope
less position" trying to bal
ance three often separate ele
ments in the country while
dealing with a crippled econo
my, according to Prof. Zev
Brinner of UC-Berkeley's Near
Eastern Studies Department.
Brinner spoke about Egypt
and Israel last night to a group
of students in Paloma lounge.
Mubarak, he said, is devoted
to the late President Anwar
Sadat's peace policies but must
balance the feelings and at
titudes of those who favor Arab
unity, those who identify
themselves solely as Egyptians
and those who identify with
their religion first and fore
most.
Brinner said the Arab world
those countries whose of
ficial language is Arabic is
unique because of its "simulta

neous calls for unity and de
velopments toward separa
tism." He said Egypt is one of
the few countries to have
achieved the status of a nation
state, with a sense of its own
identity. He said that Mubarak,
however, cannot afford to al
ienate either the Muslims or
the Arab world which os
tracized Sadat and on which
Egypt partly depends financial
ly.
At the same time, Egypt's
leader cannot make the mis
take of playing into the hands
of the radical Muslim fun
damentalists or selling himself
to the Arab world, according to
Brinner, who said he believes
that the latter maneuver would
lead to an Arab-Israeli war with
Egypt at the forefront.
"Without Egypt, there can't be
an Arab-Israeli war," he said.
Brinner said local identi
fication identification with

one's own territory has be
come much stronger than the
concept of Arab unity. He
quoted Sadat as saying that
Egypt will not continue to be a
blood bank for the Arab world.
Brinner also referred to the
Palestinians as an example of a
fragmented group forced to
come together as a result of Is
raeli actions and actions on the
part of Arabs who, he said,
"have killed off more Palesti
nians than Israel has ever been
responsible for."
Brinner said, "There's no
doubt that group (the Pales
tians) is on its way to na
tionhood." He said Israeli
Prime Minister Menachem Be
gin's belief in "autonomy for
people and not for land," was
unrealistic. Brinner advocated
a policy whereby Israel would
"get rid of responsibilities on
the West Bank" while main
taining a secure position.
