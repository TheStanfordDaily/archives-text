Cole Porter,
from Dußarry Was A Lady
To hear many officials from both
universities and the federal
government tell the story,
"Friendship" may as well be the tune
the two establishments have been
singing to each other since the creation
of an extraordinary partnership more
than a quarter-century ago.
The friendship, they say, represents
an interdependence which grew out of
the notion, developed during World
War 11 and just after, that major
universities like Stanford had the
capability and were indeed best able to
conduct research as well as other
programs in the national interest, and
therefore deserved increasing federal
support.
Originally the idea came out of
university efforts to aid the national
defense. Soon enough, however, it was
applied to other areas, such as health,
agriculture, space exploration (spurred
by the Soviet Sputnik program) and
even social policy. Universities began to
rely on the federal government for
partial funding in almostall areas of
university operation, including student
financial aid, while the government
invested in them to train the nation's
best minds.
judging by continued legislative
backing and university acceptance,
both groups saw federal support as a
sound economic investment, as well as
a socially desirable goal.
Time will tell whether society will
continue to promote the idea that
government ought to play such a major
role in the support of higher education.
But there is no question that a series of
events in the past few years has put
some strains on the friendship, and that
something of a national debate is being
conducted about just how the
relationship should proceed.
Ironically, at the same time that the
government threatens to withdraw
funding, it mayalso play an increasing
role in regulating universities and in
demanding accountability forthe
dollars it does offer. Educational
institutions are not necessarily going to
be accorded the same degree of trust to
run themselves that they have enjoyed
in the past.
In short, the universities like Stanford
are finding that they are no longer
sacred, and that the friendship is
undergoing redefinition.
The problem is that one of the friends
the federal government has
started to question just how "mutual"
the friendship is. Figuratively speaking,
a new administration in Washington is
singing a different Cole Porter tune, this
one from Anything Goes: "Times have
changed, and we've often rewound the
clock.. ."
While the university administrators,
including Stanford President Donald
Kennedy, tend to claim that any money
given them or their students is a crucial
investment in the long-term health of

the nation, the government
particularly reflected in the attitude of
President Ronald Reagan is calling
for cuts in many areas of both research
and student aid funding. It says support
levels must be cut back to regain the
fiscally responsible policy necessary to
thatsame long-term health of the
nation.
Reagan administration officials call
for greater institutional self-reliance,
saying the universities can do virtually
the same quality jobon leanerfederal
contributions, especially if they solicit
alternative funds more actively. They
also say students can get by on much
less direct federal aid and loan support.
Conflict is apparent in other areas as
well. The government has, in the past
five years, mandated that universities
show more accountability for federal
funds by reporting out the efforts of
personnel involved in federally funded
projects. This represents a break with a
previous era in which almost total trust
was placed in universities to spend
money as it had been earmarked.
As a means of budget-cutting, at least
one major federal agency the
National Institutes of Health has
proposed that universities not be
reimbursed in full forthe indirect costs

pertaining to federally funded work,
such as utilities and certain clerical
support. Previously, the universities
and the government had negotiated
formulas by which these expenses were
treated as being as legitimate as direct
costs.
As well, a number of incidents,
including some here, involving federal
requests for universities to monitor the
activities of foreign (especially Eastern
Bloc) scholars visiting campuses has
brought claims of national security
interests directly into conflict with the

ideal of academic freedom.
Finally, in many other areas
universities have found they are not
only becoming subject to government
control, but are being treated as
economic entities no different from
private industry. These areas include
medical care administration for those
universities with major medical centers,
the Affirmative Action requirements
designed to ensure equal job access for
minorites and women, and health
regulations governing occupational
safety or the treatment in research of
human and animal subjects.
At Stanford, a core of
administrators in the Office of
Public Affairs has assumed the
increasingly important and complex
task of representing the University's
interests in Washington. These
specialists in government relations act
as lobbyists (although they are not
officially registered as such) within the
legislative process. They also work
closely with educational associations
based in Washington that represent the
interests of their member schools.
Stanford makes its presence felt in
the nation's capital at least as much as
does any other university. This view was

repeated in Da/7y interviews not only by
the University's allies in Washington,
butalso by a numberof congressmen,
and certain officials who actively
oppose Stanford in legislative battles.
This recognition partly stems from
the vitality of the Stanford government
relations program, and partly from the
priority that its president places on
federal matters. Kennedy is clearly an
effective politician. He is also respected
in Washington for his performance as
commissioner of the Food and Drug
Administration from 1977 to 1979 and

for his knowledge of how government
operates.
Set against this backdrop of
university-government
relations is an incipient sense of
urgency for university adminstrators, as
well as students and faculty, to
understand the development of this
involvement. Administrators
acknowledge that this understanding is
important in determining the
universities' purpose, and the direction
of higher education.
In the words of Stanford's vice
president for public affairs, Robert
Rosenzweig, "The government is
simply a part of our life. If you want
to understanda university like Stanford,
you have to understand its relationship
to the federal government. Never mind
whether you approve of it or
disapprove of it you have to
understand it. A modern American
university is incomprehensible unless
you come to terms with the role of the
federal government."
Stanford University has been either a
particularly fortunate participant in the
great flowering of university
government involvement, or,
alternately, it has been a particularly
avaricious culprit in an era which has
created unrealistic expectations about
the extent to which the federal
government ought to support higher
education.
In any case, Stanford last year
received nearly $2OO million in federal
contracts and grants (including
financial aid) —a figure equivalent to
46.5 percent of the University's total
operating expenditures, excepting
construction and renovation of major
facilities.
Moreover, according to the Office of
the Dean of Graduate Studies and
Research, Stanford has received
somewhere between 2.5 and 3.1
percent of the total federal outlay for
research and developmenttocolleges
and universities each year since 1963.
Among all educational institutions,
Stanford has been either second, third
or fourth in total funds received each
year but one during that time. (MIT has
ranked first each year, with the other
top spots shared among the University
of Washington, Stanford, Harvard and
the University of California at San
Diego.)
In financial aid in the most recent
year, the federal government gave
Stanford nearly $4 million in direct
support of institutional loan or grant
programs and another $5 million to
individuals in the University.
Perhaps more important than any
statistics, however, is the debate about
the wisdom of accepting even
depending upon such a large
amount of federal support. Those who
favorthe policy amongthem
Kennedy and Rosenzweig say the
government gets a "bargain" for any
investment it makes in education, and
that the government has until recently
made no attempt to control the
workings of the universities in
proportion to the support they receive.
Thus, they say, the government
should be at least as opposed as schools
like Stanford to reducing federal
commitment and to increasing
regulations that would make it more
difficult for universities to do their job.

Until fairly recently, Rosenzweig said,
this benevolent attitude was in fact
prevalent: "1 don't suppose there's ever
been a patron in the history of
philanthropy .. . asgenerousand as
relatively free of control as the federal
government was in the support of
research and higher education in this
country between 1950 and 1970,1975
maybe."
Some, however, see the matter in an
entirely different light. Where
university administrators see a
"partnership," government officials see
a free ride spinning out of control.
Where educational leaders talk of
"investment" in educational
institutions by the government,
government officials talk of those
leaders' unwillingness to seek funds
elsewere, to wean themselves off the
federal dole.
Gary Jones, the Department of
Education's deputy undersecretary for

planning, said, "Every university
president attempts to address their
needs in any way thatthey deem
possible, and obviously they would
prefer that the federal government
continue to fund at the level they're
funding, so they need not reassess the
allocations of their dollars within their
institution. So I'm notsurprised that
university presidents are saying, 'Hey,
we simply are facing dire
consequences.' The fact is, I don't
believe that.
"There are institutions Stanford,
Harvard and others while they're
high-cost institutions, they're in far
better fiscal condition than the federal
government," continued Jones. "But
for some reason people believe
the federal government should
continue to operate in deficit spending,
and it doesn't hurt the federal
government to do that, but it certainly
would hurt us to do that."

Finally, Jones said, Stanford "needs to
ask, 'Where can we get more dollars
without going tothefederal
government. Can we get more through
the philanthropic process in this nation,
can we get more from the state of
California?'. . ."
Kennedy countered, "We're not
going to go out of business, but there is
a range of things it will not be possible
for us to do" if the full set of proposed
budget cuts are adopted, and measures
such as a lessening of indirect cost
reimbursements enacted. "The real
advantage of government funding is
(that) it is the only possible source of
supportforthe fundamental research
enterprise in universitieslikethisoneat
anything like its present scale. It makes
possible a scholarly venture. . . that
isn't supportable by any other means."
Kennedy said that for Stanford to
support independently just the volume

of research sponsored by the
government here last year $lBO
million requirean
endowment of $3.75 billion, a figure
floated around only in the dreams of
University budget officials.
Moreover, he said, that support is
simply not available from private
industry: even in a "good year"
industry can be expected to support
only 4 to 5 percent of the $lBO million
figure.
"I don't think that any of the research
done at Stanford can be supported by
corporate sources on a profitable
basis," Kennedy added. "A corporation
is not going to make any money off a
particular grant or contract that it has in
the University, except way down the
line and very indirectly." Also, he said,
most large industries have their own
research and development

'We in the higher education
community view the current cuts in
the federal research and student aid
budgets as nothing less than a major
withdrawal of government from
three decades of commitment to
the enterprises of fundamental
research and higher learning.. /

Kennedy

'Every university president...
obviously would prefer that the
federal government continue
(present levels of) funding, so they
need not reassess the allocations of
dollars within their institution. So
I'm notsurprised that university
presidents are saying, 'Hey, we
simply are facing dire
consequences.' The fact is, I don't
believe that.'

organizations and are likely to
relinquish their own control only when
they feel "the talent (at the University)
is exactly right for their particular
purposes."
In general, society's criteria for
deciding which forms of research can
be supported feasibly by private
industry involve the extent to which
knowledge can be "expropriated"
from an individual firm and thus affect
thefirm'sabilitytomakea profit from it,

according to Michael Boskin, professor
of economics here. For the support of
research with broad applications not
necessarily usable by one firm, "We
need collectively funded organizations
through some form of government,"
said Boskin.
Rosenzweig said, "Basic research is so
clearly a responsibility of the
government in a modern society that it
seems to me hardly worth arguing
about anymore. It's an activity that has
no specific benefit to any potential

sponsor, but clearly and broadly
distributed benefits to society."
Stanford and universities like it,
however, have probably come to
expect a greater volume of research
than the federal government can
possibly support, according to Denis
Prager, assistant director of the White
House Office of Science and
Technology Policy.
Although Prager said that in the past
30 years "the government has realized
the degree to which it needed to

depend upon the universities for basic
science. . ~ the universities got
themselves on a growth track. The
money was coming fast and furiously;
the universities were able to hire a lot of
tenured faculty to build large facilities,
to buy the best of equipment, and the
momentum was such That even when
the money coming from the federal
government began to dry up, the
universities didn't plan ahead. There
was no contingency planning. I think
that in some ways the universities
actually overshot: they kept growing
and expecting money past a time when
it made any sense to."
Prager, who holds a Ph.D. in
physiology from Stanford, also said that
while the total volume of research in
this country continues to increase each
year, universities feel pinched only
because funding has failed to increase
at the rate they expected it to.
Carol Scheman, the director of
federal relations for health and
biomedical research at the Association
of American Universities, one of the
educational organizations in
Washington with which Stanford works
closely, differed with Prager's
assessment.
While the bottom line on research is
up slightly, the recent shift away from
completely grant-oriented agencies to
defense-related research has taken
some sponsored work away from the
universities, she said. Because of this,
in-house university research sponsored
by the government is down 6.7 percent
from last year.
What is perhaps most significant
about the differing interpretations is
that they seem to represent a common
theme in Washington these days.
In financial aids, for example, the
educational lobbying organizations
such as the Association of American
Universities and the American Council
on Education claim the president's
proposed fiscal 1983 budget would "put
college beyond the reach of several
hundred thousand young Americans
.. . and force millionsof students to
change their college plans by
transferring to less expensive
institutions or dropping out entirely."
The Department of Education,
however, absolutely disagrees with the
conclusion. Asked if there are students
who will not be able to go to college
under the FYB3 budget who can afford

to attend now, deputy undersecretary
Jones replied, "No. That's been one of
the major distortions of the
administration's proposals."
Nobody can really calculate who is
right, only because the answer would to
a great degree involve the extent to
which future students would be willing
to sacrifice —and go heavily into debt
to obtain higher education.
Even with proposed budget
cuts, it is of course ludicrous to
posit a complete severing of
the relationship between the federal
government and the universities or a
devastating break in the friendship built
up over the last generation. However, it
may be equally ludicrous to assume that
federal support of higher education will
continue along the growth track of the
past 30 years.
University administrators may thus be
wise to evaluate carefully their financial
needs and highest priorities,
recognizing that some cuts are
probably inevitable. Their credibility
will almost certainly be at risk if they
attack all cuts indiscriminately, and fail
to indicate those areas where they
might be able to endure some
retrenchment. Misguided proposals
such as indirect cost recovery-cutting
may be a direct function of the
administrators' unwillingness to accept
direct cuts in other areas.
Finally, the increase in government
regulation of universities may not be
irreversible. Without question, many
forms of government support do
represent sound long-term investments
in the future of the nation, and of the
world. But not all forms do. If leaders in
higher education manifest cooperation
in the difficult process of restoring the
nation's economic health, they may be
able to reapproach the level of trust and
goodwill that characterized the
friendship for so many years.

Washington with which Stanford works
closely, differed with Prager's
assessment.
While the bottom line on research is
up slightly, the recent shift away from
completely grant-oriented agencies to
defense-related research has taken
some sponsored work away from the
universities, she said. Because of this,
in-house university research sponsored
by the government is down 6.7 percent
from last year.
What is perhaps most significant
about the differing interpretations is
that they seem to represent a common
theme in Washington these days.
In financial aids, for example, the
educational lobbying organizations
such as the Association of American
Universities and the American Council
on Education claim the president's
proposed fiscal 1983 budget would "put
college beyond the reach of several
hundred thousand young Americans
.. . and force millionsof students to
change their college plans by
transferring to less expensive
institutions or dropping out entirely."
The Department of Education,
however, absolutely disagrees with the
conclusion. Asked if there are students
who will not be able to go to college
under the FYB3 budget who can afford

to attend now, deputy undersecretary
Jones replied, "No. That's been one of
the major distortions of the
administration's proposals."
Nobody can really calculate who is
right, only because the answer would to
a great degree involve the extent to
which future students would be willing
to sacrifice —and go heavily into debt
to obtain higher education.
Even with proposed budget
cuts, it is of course ludicrous to
posit a complete severing of
the relationship between the federal
government and the universities or a
devastating break in the friendship built
up over the last generation. However, it
may be equally ludicrous to assume that
federal support of higher education will
continue along the growth track of the
past 30 years.
University administrators may thus be
wise to evaluate carefully their financial
needs and highest priorities,
recognizing that some cuts are
probably inevitable. Their credibility
will almost certainly be at risk if they
attack all cuts indiscriminately, and fail
to indicate those areas where they
might be able to endure some
retrenchment. Misguided proposals
such as indirect cost recovery-cutting
may be a direct function of the
administrators' unwillingness to accept
direct cuts in other areas.
Finally, the increase in government
regulation of universities may not be
irreversible. Without question, many
forms of government support do
represent sound long-term investments
in the future of the nation, and of the
world. But not all forms do. If leaders in
higher education manifest cooperation
in the difficult process of restoring the
nation's economic health, they may be
able to reapproach the level of trust and
goodwill that characterized the
friendship for so many years.
Friendship, friendship,
Just a perfect blendship.. .
When other friendships have been
forgot,
Ours will still be hot!
It's friendship, friendship,
Just a perfect blendship. . .
When other friendships
have ceased to jell,
Ours will still be swell!
Cole Porter,
from Dußarry Was A Lady
To hear many officials from both
universities and the federal
government tell the story,
"Friendship" may as well be the tune
the two establishments have been
singing to each other since the creation
of an extraordinary partnership more
than a quarter-century ago.
The friendship, they say, represents
an interdependence which grew out of
the notion, developed during World
War 11 and just after, that major
universities like Stanford had the
capability and were indeed best able to
conduct research as well as other
programs in the national interest, and
therefore deserved increasing federal
support.
Originally the idea came out of
university efforts to aid the national
defense. Soon enough, however, it was
applied to other areas, such as health,
agriculture, space exploration (spurred
by the Soviet Sputnik program) and
even social policy. Universities began to
rely on the federal government for
partial funding in almostall areas of
university operation, including student
financial aid, while the government
invested in them to train the nation's
best minds.
judging by continued legislative
backing and university acceptance,
both groups saw federal support as a
sound economic investment, as well as
a socially desirable goal.
Time will tell whether society will
continue to promote the idea that
government ought to play such a major
role in the support of higher education.
But there is no question that a series of
events in the past few years has put
some strains on the friendship, and that
something of a national debate is being
conducted about just how the
relationship should proceed.
Ironically, at the same time that the
government threatens to withdraw
funding, it mayalso play an increasing
role in regulating universities and in
demanding accountability forthe
dollars it does offer. Educational
institutions are not necessarily going to
be accorded the same degree of trust to
run themselves that they have enjoyed
in the past.
In short, the universities like Stanford
are finding that they are no longer
sacred, and that the friendship is
undergoing redefinition.
The problem is that one of the friends
the federal government has
started to question just how "mutual"
the friendship is. Figuratively speaking,
a new administration in Washington is
singing a different Cole Porter tune, this
one from Anything Goes: "Times have
changed, and we've often rewound the
clock.. ."
While the university administrators,
including Stanford President Donald
Kennedy, tend to claim that any money
given them or their students is a crucial
investment in the long-term health of

the nation, the government
particularly reflected in the attitude of
President Ronald Reagan is calling
for cuts in many areas of both research
and student aid funding. It says support
levels must be cut back to regain the
fiscally responsible policy necessary to
thatsame long-term health of the
nation.
Reagan administration officials call
for greater institutional self-reliance,
saying the universities can do virtually
the same quality jobon leanerfederal
contributions, especially if they solicit
alternative funds more actively. They
also say students can get by on much
less direct federal aid and loan support.
Conflict is apparent in other areas as
well. The government has, in the past
five years, mandated that universities
show more accountability for federal
funds by reporting out the efforts of
personnel involved in federally funded
projects. This represents a break with a
previous era in which almost total trust
was placed in universities to spend
money as it had been earmarked.
As a means of budget-cutting, at least
one major federal agency the
National Institutes of Health has
proposed that universities not be
reimbursed in full forthe indirect costs

pertaining to federally funded work,
such as utilities and certain clerical
support. Previously, the universities
and the government had negotiated
formulas by which these expenses were
treated as being as legitimate as direct
costs.
As well, a number of incidents,
including some here, involving federal
requests for universities to monitor the
activities of foreign (especially Eastern
Bloc) scholars visiting campuses has
brought claims of national security
interests directly into conflict with the

ideal of academic freedom.
Finally, in many other areas
universities have found they are not
only becoming subject to government
control, but are being treated as
economic entities no different from
private industry. These areas include
medical care administration for those
universities with major medical centers,
the Affirmative Action requirements
designed to ensure equal job access for
minorites and women, and health
regulations governing occupational
safety or the treatment in research of
human and animal subjects.
At Stanford, a core of
administrators in the Office of
Public Affairs has assumed the
increasingly important and complex
task of representing the University's
interests in Washington. These
specialists in government relations act
as lobbyists (although they are not
officially registered as such) within the
legislative process. They also work
closely with educational associations
based in Washington that represent the
interests of their member schools.
Stanford makes its presence felt in
the nation's capital at least as much as
does any other university. This view was

repeated in Da/7y interviews not only by
the University's allies in Washington,
butalso by a numberof congressmen,
and certain officials who actively
oppose Stanford in legislative battles.
This recognition partly stems from
the vitality of the Stanford government
relations program, and partly from the
priority that its president places on
federal matters. Kennedy is clearly an
effective politician. He is also respected
in Washington for his performance as
commissioner of the Food and Drug
Administration from 1977 to 1979 and

for his knowledge of how government
operates.
Set against this backdrop of
university-government
relations is an incipient sense of
urgency for university adminstrators, as
well as students and faculty, to
understand the development of this
involvement. Administrators
acknowledge that this understanding is
important in determining the
universities' purpose, and the direction
of higher education.
In the words of Stanford's vice
president for public affairs, Robert
Rosenzweig, "The government is
simply a part of our life. If you want
to understanda university like Stanford,
you have to understand its relationship
to the federal government. Never mind
whether you approve of it or
disapprove of it you have to
understand it. A modern American
university is incomprehensible unless
you come to terms with the role of the
federal government."
Stanford University has been either a
particularly fortunate participant in the
great flowering of university
government involvement, or,
alternately, it has been a particularly
avaricious culprit in an era which has
created unrealistic expectations about
the extent to which the federal
government ought to support higher
education.
In any case, Stanford last year
received nearly $2OO million in federal
contracts and grants (including
financial aid) —a figure equivalent to
46.5 percent of the University's total
operating expenditures, excepting
construction and renovation of major
facilities.
Moreover, according to the Office of
the Dean of Graduate Studies and
Research, Stanford has received
somewhere between 2.5 and 3.1
percent of the total federal outlay for
research and developmenttocolleges
and universities each year since 1963.
Among all educational institutions,
Stanford has been either second, third
or fourth in total funds received each
year but one during that time. (MIT has
ranked first each year, with the other
top spots shared among the University
of Washington, Stanford, Harvard and
the University of California at San
Diego.)
In financial aid in the most recent
year, the federal government gave
Stanford nearly $4 million in direct
support of institutional loan or grant
programs and another $5 million to
individuals in the University.
Perhaps more important than any
statistics, however, is the debate about
the wisdom of accepting even
depending upon such a large
amount of federal support. Those who
favorthe policy amongthem
Kennedy and Rosenzweig say the
government gets a "bargain" for any
investment it makes in education, and
that the government has until recently
made no attempt to control the
workings of the universities in
proportion to the support they receive.
Thus, they say, the government
should be at least as opposed as schools
like Stanford to reducing federal
commitment and to increasing
regulations that would make it more
difficult for universities to do their job.



Mark Wilson/Daily
Until fairly recently, Rosenzweig said,
this benevolent attitude was in fact
prevalent: "1 don't suppose there's ever
been a patron in the history of
philanthropy .. . asgenerousand as
relatively free of control as the federal
government was in the support of
research and higher education in this
country between 1950 and 1970,1975
maybe."
Some, however, see the matter in an
entirely different light. Where
university administrators see a
"partnership," government officials see
a free ride spinning out of control.
Where educational leaders talk of
"investment" in educational
institutions by the government,
government officials talk of those
leaders' unwillingness to seek funds
elsewere, to wean themselves off the
federal dole.
Gary Jones, the Department of
Education's deputy undersecretary for

planning, said, "Every university
president attempts to address their
needs in any way thatthey deem
possible, and obviously they would
prefer that the federal government
continue to fund at the level they're
funding, so they need not reassess the
allocations of their dollars within their
institution. So I'm notsurprised that
university presidents are saying, 'Hey,
we simply are facing dire
consequences.' The fact is, I don't
believe that.
"There are institutions Stanford,
Harvard and others while they're
high-cost institutions, they're in far
better fiscal condition than the federal
government," continued Jones. "But
for some reason people believe
the federal government should
continue to operate in deficit spending,
and it doesn't hurt the federal
government to do that, but it certainly
would hurt us to do that."

Finally, Jones said, Stanford "needs to
ask, 'Where can we get more dollars
without going tothefederal
government. Can we get more through
the philanthropic process in this nation,
can we get more from the state of
California?'. . ."
Kennedy countered, "We're not
going to go out of business, but there is
a range of things it will not be possible
for us to do" if the full set of proposed
budget cuts are adopted, and measures
such as a lessening of indirect cost
reimbursements enacted. "The real
advantage of government funding is
(that) it is the only possible source of
supportforthe fundamental research
enterprise in universitieslikethisoneat
anything like its present scale. It makes
possible a scholarly venture. . . that
isn't supportable by any other means."
Kennedy said that for Stanford to
support independently just the volume

of research sponsored by the
government here last year $lBO
million requirean
endowment of $3.75 billion, a figure
floated around only in the dreams of
University budget officials.
Moreover, he said, that support is
simply not available from private
industry: even in a "good year"
industry can be expected to support
only 4 to 5 percent of the $lBO million
figure.
"I don't think that any of the research
done at Stanford can be supported by
corporate sources on a profitable
basis," Kennedy added. "A corporation
is not going to make any money off a
particular grant or contract that it has in
the University, except way down the
line and very indirectly." Also, he said,
most large industries have their own
research and development

'We in the higher education
community view the current cuts in
the federal research and student aid
budgets as nothing less than a major
withdrawal of government from
three decades of commitment to
the enterprises of fundamental
research and higher learning.. /

Kennedy

'Every university president...
obviously would prefer that the
federal government continue
(present levels of) funding, so they
need not reassess the allocations of

believe that.'

organizations and are likely to
relinquish their own control only when
they feel "the talent (at the University)
is exactly right for their particular
purposes."
In general, society's criteria for
deciding which forms of research can
be supported feasibly by private
industry involve the extent to which
knowledge can be "expropriated"
from an individual firm and thus affect
thefirm'sabilitytomakea profit from it,

according to Michael Boskin, professor
of economics here. For the support of
research with broad applications not
necessarily usable by one firm, "We
need collectively funded organizations
through some form of government,"
said Boskin.
Rosenzweig said, "Basic research is so
clearly a responsibility of the
government in a modern society that it
seems to me hardly worth arguing
about anymore. It's an activity that has
no specific benefit to any potential

sponsor, but clearly and broadly
distributed benefits to society."
Stanford and universities like it,
however, have probably come to
expect a greater volume of research
than the federal government can
possibly support, according to Denis
Prager, assistant director of the White
House Office of Science and
Technology Policy.
Although Prager said that in the past
30 years "the government has realized
the degree to which it needed to

depend upon the universities for basic
science. . ~ the universities got
themselves on a growth track. The
money was coming fast and furiously;
the universities were able to hire a lot of
tenured faculty to build large facilities,
to buy the best of equipment, and the
momentum was such That even when
the money coming from the federal
government began to dry up, the
universities didn't plan ahead. There
was no contingency planning. I think
that in some ways the universities
actually overshot: they kept growing
and expecting money past a time when
it made any sense to."
Prager, who holds a Ph.D. in
physiology from Stanford, also said that
while the total volume of research in
this country continues to increase each
year, universities feel pinched only
because funding has failed to increase
at the rate they expected it to.
Carol Scheman, the director of
federal relations for health and
biomedical research at the Association
of American Universities, one of the
educational organizations in
Washington with which Stanford works
closely, differed with Prager's
assessment.
While the bottom line on research is
up slightly, the recent shift away from
completely grant-oriented agencies to
defense-related research has taken
some sponsored work away from the
universities, she said. Because of this,
in-house university research sponsored
by the government is down 6.7 percent
from last year.
What is perhaps most significant
about the differing interpretations is
that they seem to represent a common
theme in Washington these days.

change their college plans by
transferring to less expensive
institutions or dropping out entirely."
The Department of Education,
however, absolutely disagrees with the
conclusion. Asked if there are students
who will not be able to go to college
under the FYB3 budget who can afford

to attend now, deputy undersecretary
Jones replied, "No. That's been one of
the major distortions of the
administration's proposals."
Nobody can really calculate who is
right, only because the answer would to
a great degree involve the extent to
which future students would be willing
to sacrifice —and go heavily into debt
to obtain higher education.

'Every university president...
obviously would prefer that the
federal government continue
(present levels of) funding, so they
need not reassess the allocations of
dollars within their institution. So
I'm notsurprised that university
presidents are saying, 'Hey, we
simply are facing dire
consequences.' The fact is, I don't
believe that.'

organizations and are likely to
relinquish their own control only when
they feel "the talent (at the University)
is exactly right for their particular
purposes."
In general, society's criteria for
deciding which forms of research can
be supported feasibly by private
industry involve the extent to which
knowledge can be "expropriated"
from an individual firm and thus affect
thefirm'sabilitytomakea profit from it,

according to Michael Boskin, professor
of economics here. For the support of
research with broad applications not
necessarily usable by one firm, "We
need collectively funded organizations
through some form of government,"
said Boskin.
Rosenzweig said, "Basic research is so
clearly a responsibility of the
government in a modern society that it
seems to me hardly worth arguing
about anymore. It's an activity that has
no specific benefit to any potential

sponsor, but clearly and broadly
distributed benefits to society."
Stanford and universities like it,
however, have probably come to
expect a greater volume of research
than the federal government can
possibly support, according to Denis
Prager, assistant director of the White
House Office of Science and
Technology Policy.
Although Prager said that in the past
30 years "the government has realized
the degree to which it needed to

depend upon the universities for basic
science. . ~ the universities got
themselves on a growth track. The
money was coming fast and furiously;
the universities were able to hire a lot of
tenured faculty to build large facilities,
to buy the best of equipment, and the
momentum was such That even when
the money coming from the federal
government began to dry up, the
universities didn't plan ahead. There
was no contingency planning. I think
that in some ways the universities
actually overshot: they kept growing
and expecting money past a time when
it made any sense to."
Prager, who holds a Ph.D. in
physiology from Stanford, also said that
while the total volume of research in
this country continues to increase each
year, universities feel pinched only
because funding has failed to increase
at the rate they expected it to.
Carol Scheman, the director of
federal relations for health and
biomedical research at the Association
of American Universities, one of the
educational organizations in
Washington with which Stanford works
closely, differed with Prager's
assessment.
While the bottom line on research is
up slightly, the recent shift away from
completely grant-oriented agencies to
defense-related research has taken
some sponsored work away from the
universities, she said. Because of this,
in-house university research sponsored
by the government is down 6.7 percent
from last year.
What is perhaps most significant
about the differing interpretations is
that they seem to represent a common
theme in Washington these days.
In financial aids, for example, the
educational lobbying organizations
such as the Association of American
Universities and the American Council
on Education claim the president's
proposed fiscal 1983 budget would "put
college beyond the reach of several
hundred thousand young Americans
.. . and force millionsof students to
change their college plans by
transferring to less expensive
institutions or dropping out entirely."
The Department of Education,
however, absolutely disagrees with the
conclusion. Asked if there are students
who will not be able to go to college
under the FYB3 budget who can afford

to attend now, deputy undersecretary
Jones replied, "No. That's been one of
the major distortions of the
administration's proposals."
Nobody can really calculate who is
right, only because the answer would to
a great degree involve the extent to
which future students would be willing
to sacrifice —and go heavily into debt
to obtain higher education.
Even with proposed budget
cuts, it is of course ludicrous to
posit a complete severing of
the relationship between the federal
government and the universities or a
devastating break in the friendship built
up over the last generation. However, it
may be equally ludicrous to assume that
federal support of higher education will
continue along the growth track of the
past 30 years.
University administrators may thus be
wise to evaluate carefully their financial
needs and highest priorities,
recognizing that some cuts are
probably inevitable. Their credibility
will almost certainly be at risk if they
attack all cuts indiscriminately, and fail
to indicate those areas where they
might be able to endure some
retrenchment. Misguided proposals
such as indirect cost recovery-cutting
may be a direct function of the
administrators' unwillingness to accept
direct cuts in other areas.
Finally, the increase in government
regulation of universities may not be
irreversible. Without question, many
forms of government support do
represent sound long-term investments
in the future of the nation, and of the
world. But not all forms do. If leaders in
higher education manifest cooperation
in the difficult process of restoring the
nation's economic health, they may be
able to reapproach the level of trust and
goodwill that characterized the
friendship for so many years.
Friendship, friendship,
Just a perfect blendship.. .
When other friendships have been
forgot,
Ours will still be hot!
It's friendship, friendship,
Just a perfect blendship. . .
When other friendships
have ceased to jell,
Ours will still be swell!
Cole Porter,
from Dußarry Was A Lady
To hear many officials from both
universities and the federal
government tell the story,
"Friendship" may as well be the tune
the two establishments have been
singing to each other since the creation
of an extraordinary partnership more
than a quarter-century ago.
The friendship, they say, represents
an interdependence which grew out of
the notion, developed during World
War 11 and just after, that major
universities like Stanford had the
capability and were indeed best able to
conduct research as well as other
programs in the national interest, and
therefore deserved increasing federal
support.
Originally the idea came out of
university efforts to aid the national
defense. Soon enough, however, it was
applied to other areas, such as health,
agriculture, space exploration (spurred
by the Soviet Sputnik program) and
even social policy. Universities began to
rely on the federal government for
partial funding in almostall areas of
university operation, including student
financial aid, while the government
invested in them to train the nation's
best minds.
judging by continued legislative
backing and university acceptance,
both groups saw federal support as a
sound economic investment, as well as
a socially desirable goal.
Time will tell whether society will
continue to promote the idea that
government ought to play such a major
role in the support of higher education.
But there is no question that a series of
events in the past few years has put
some strains on the friendship, and that
something of a national debate is being
conducted about just how the
relationship should proceed.
Ironically, at the same time that the
government threatens to withdraw
funding, it mayalso play an increasing
role in regulating universities and in
demanding accountability forthe
dollars it does offer. Educational
institutions are not necessarily going to
be accorded the same degree of trust to
run themselves that they have enjoyed
in the past.
In short, the universities like Stanford
are finding that they are no longer
sacred, and that the friendship is
undergoing redefinition.
The problem is that one of the friends
the federal government has
started to question just how "mutual"
the friendship is. Figuratively speaking,
a new administration in Washington is
singing a different Cole Porter tune, this
one from Anything Goes: "Times have
changed, and we've often rewound the
clock.. ."
While the university administrators,
including Stanford President Donald
Kennedy, tend to claim that any money
given them or their students is a crucial
investment in the long-term health of

the nation, the government
particularly reflected in the attitude of
President Ronald Reagan is calling
for cuts in many areas of both research
and student aid funding. It says support
levels must be cut back to regain the
fiscally responsible policy necessary to
thatsame long-term health of the
nation.
Reagan administration officials call
for greater institutional self-reliance,
saying the universities can do virtually
the same quality jobon leanerfederal
contributions, especially if they solicit
alternative funds more actively. They
also say students can get by on much
less direct federal aid and loan support.
Conflict is apparent in other areas as
well. The government has, in the past
five years, mandated that universities
show more accountability for federal
funds by reporting out the efforts of
personnel involved in federally funded
projects. This represents a break with a
previous era in which almost total trust
was placed in universities to spend
money as it had been earmarked.
As a means of budget-cutting, at least
one major federal agency the
National Institutes of Health has
proposed that universities not be
reimbursed in full forthe indirect costs

pertaining to federally funded work,
such as utilities and certain clerical
support. Previously, the universities
and the government had negotiated
formulas by which these expenses were
treated as being as legitimate as direct
costs.
As well, a number of incidents,
including some here, involving federal
requests for universities to monitor the
activities of foreign (especially Eastern
Bloc) scholars visiting campuses has
brought claims of national security
interests directly into conflict with the

ideal of academic freedom.
Finally, in many other areas
universities have found they are not
only becoming subject to government
control, but are being treated as
economic entities no different from
private industry. These areas include
medical care administration for those
universities with major medical centers,
the Affirmative Action requirements
designed to ensure equal job access for
minorites and women, and health
regulations governing occupational
safety or the treatment in research of
human and animal subjects.
At Stanford, a core of
administrators in the Office of
Public Affairs has assumed the
increasingly important and complex
task of representing the University's
interests in Washington. These
specialists in government relations act
as lobbyists (although they are not
officially registered as such) within the
legislative process. They also work
closely with educational associations
based in Washington that represent the
interests of their member schools.
Stanford makes its presence felt in
the nation's capital at least as much as
does any other university. This view was

repeated in Da/7y interviews not only by
the University's allies in Washington,
butalso by a numberof congressmen,
and certain officials who actively
oppose Stanford in legislative battles.
This recognition partly stems from
the vitality of the Stanford government
relations program, and partly from the
priority that its president places on
federal matters. Kennedy is clearly an
effective politician. He is also respected
in Washington for his performance as
commissioner of the Food and Drug
Administration from 1977 to 1979 and

for his knowledge of how government
operates.
Set against this backdrop of
university-government
relations is an incipient sense of
urgency for university adminstrators, as
well as students and faculty, to
understand the development of this
involvement. Administrators
acknowledge that this understanding is
important in determining the
universities' purpose, and the direction
of higher education.
In the words of Stanford's vice
president for public affairs, Robert
Rosenzweig, "The government is
simply a part of our life. If you want
to understanda university like Stanford,
you have to understand its relationship
to the federal government. Never mind
whether you approve of it or
disapprove of it you have to
understand it. A modern American
university is incomprehensible unless
you come to terms with the role of the
federal government."
Stanford University has been either a
particularly fortunate participant in the
great flowering of university
government involvement, or,
alternately, it has been a particularly
avaricious culprit in an era which has
created unrealistic expectations about
the extent to which the federal
government ought to support higher
education.
In any case, Stanford last year
received nearly $2OO million in federal
contracts and grants (including
financial aid) —a figure equivalent to
46.5 percent of the University's total
operating expenditures, excepting
construction and renovation of major
facilities.
Moreover, according to the Office of
the Dean of Graduate Studies and
Research, Stanford has received
somewhere between 2.5 and 3.1
percent of the total federal outlay for
research and developmenttocolleges
and universities each year since 1963.
Among all educational institutions,
Stanford has been either second, third
or fourth in total funds received each
year but one during that time. (MIT has
ranked first each year, with the other
top spots shared among the University
of Washington, Stanford, Harvard and
the University of California at San
Diego.)
In financial aid in the most recent
year, the federal government gave
Stanford nearly $4 million in direct
support of institutional loan or grant
programs and another $5 million to
individuals in the University.
Perhaps more important than any
statistics, however, is the debate about
the wisdom of accepting even
depending upon such a large
amount of federal support. Those who
favorthe policy amongthem
Kennedy and Rosenzweig say the
government gets a "bargain" for any
investment it makes in education, and
that the government has until recently
made no attempt to control the
workings of the universities in
proportion to the support they receive.
Thus, they say, the government
should be at least as opposed as schools
like Stanford to reducing federal
commitment and to increasing
regulations that would make it more
difficult for universities to do their job.



Mark Wilson/Daily
Until fairly recently, Rosenzweig said,
this benevolent attitude was in fact
prevalent: "1 don't suppose there's ever
been a patron in the history of
philanthropy .. . asgenerousand as
relatively free of control as the federal
government was in the support of
research and higher education in this
country between 1950 and 1970,1975
maybe."
Some, however, see the matter in an
entirely different light. Where
university administrators see a
"partnership," government officials see
a free ride spinning out of control.
Where educational leaders talk of
"investment" in educational
institutions by the government,
government officials talk of those
leaders' unwillingness to seek funds
elsewere, to wean themselves off the
federal dole.
Gary Jones, the Department of
Education's deputy undersecretary for

planning, said, "Every university
president attempts to address their
needs in any way thatthey deem
possible, and obviously they would
prefer that the federal government
continue to fund at the level they're
funding, so they need not reassess the
allocations of their dollars within their
institution. So I'm notsurprised that
university presidents are saying, 'Hey,
we simply are facing dire
consequences.' The fact is, I don't
believe that.
"There are institutions Stanford,
Harvard and others while they're
high-cost institutions, they're in far
better fiscal condition than the federal
government," continued Jones. "But
for some reason people believe
the federal government should
continue to operate in deficit spending,
and it doesn't hurt the federal
government to do that, but it certainly
would hurt us to do that."

Finally, Jones said, Stanford "needs to
ask, 'Where can we get more dollars
without going tothefederal
government. Can we get more through
the philanthropic process in this nation,
can we get more from the state of
California?'. . ."
Kennedy countered, "We're not
going to go out of business, but there is
a range of things it will not be possible
for us to do" if the full set of proposed
budget cuts are adopted, and measures
such as a lessening of indirect cost
reimbursements enacted. "The real
advantage of government funding is
(that) it is the only possible source of
supportforthe fundamental research
enterprise in universitieslikethisoneat
anything like its present scale. It makes
possible a scholarly venture. . . that
isn't supportable by any other means."
Kennedy said that for Stanford to
support independently just the volume

of research sponsored by the
government here last year $lBO
million requirean
endowment of $3.75 billion, a figure
floated around only in the dreams of
University budget officials.
Moreover, he said, that support is
simply not available from private
industry: even in a "good year"
industry can be expected to support
only 4 to 5 percent of the $lBO million
figure.
"I don't think that any of the research
done at Stanford can be supported by
corporate sources on a profitable
basis," Kennedy added. "A corporation
is not going to make any money off a
particular grant or contract that it has in
the University, except way down the
line and very indirectly." Also, he said,
most large industries have their own
research and development

'We in the higher education
community view the current cuts in
the federal research and student aid
budgets as nothing less than a major
withdrawal of government from
three decades of commitment to
the enterprises of fundamental
research and higher learning.. /

prefer that the federal government
continue to fund at the level they're
funding, so they need not reassess the
allocations of their dollars within their
institution. So I'm notsurprised that
university presidents are saying, 'Hey,
we simply are facing dire
consequences.' The fact is, I don't
believe that.
"There are institutions Stanford,
Harvard and others while they're
high-cost institutions, they're in far
better fiscal condition than the federal
government," continued Jones. "But
for some reason people believe
the federal government should
continue to operate in deficit spending,
and it doesn't hurt the federal
government to do that, but it certainly
would hurt us to do that."

Finally, Jones said, Stanford "needs to
ask, 'Where can we get more dollars
without going tothefederal
government. Can we get more through
the philanthropic process in this nation,
can we get more from the state of
California?'. . ."
Kennedy countered, "We're not
going to go out of business, but there is
a range of things it will not be possible
for us to do" if the full set of proposed
budget cuts are adopted, and measures
such as a lessening of indirect cost
reimbursements enacted. "The real
advantage of government funding is
(that) it is the only possible source of
supportforthe fundamental research
enterprise in universitieslikethisoneat
anything like its present scale. It makes
possible a scholarly venture. . . that
isn't supportable by any other means."
Kennedy said that for Stanford to
support independently just the volume

of research sponsored by the
government here last year $lBO
million requirean
endowment of $3.75 billion, a figure
floated around only in the dreams of
University budget officials.
Moreover, he said, that support is
simply not available from private
industry: even in a "good year"
industry can be expected to support
only 4 to 5 percent of the $lBO million
figure.
"I don't think that any of the research
done at Stanford can be supported by
corporate sources on a profitable
basis," Kennedy added. "A corporation
is not going to make any money off a
particular grant or contract that it has in
the University, except way down the
line and very indirectly." Also, he said,
most large industries have their own
research and development

organizations and are likely to
relinquish their own control only when
they feel "the talent (at the University)
is exactly right for their particular
purposes."
In general, society's criteria for
deciding which forms of research can
be supported feasibly by private
industry involve the extent to which
knowledge can be "expropriated"
from an individual firm and thus affect
thefirm'sabilitytomakea profit from it,

according to Michael Boskin, professor
of economics here. For the support of
research with broad applications not
necessarily usable by one firm, "We
need collectively funded organizations
through some form of government,"
said Boskin.
Rosenzweig said, "Basic research is so
clearly a responsibility of the
government in a modern society that it
seems to me hardly worth arguing
about anymore. It's an activity that has
no specific benefit to any potential

sponsor, but clearly and broadly
distributed benefits to society."
Stanford and universities like it,
however, have probably come to
expect a greater volume of research
than the federal government can
possibly support, according to Denis
Prager, assistant director of the White
House Office of Science and
Technology Policy.
Although Prager said that in the past
30 years "the government has realized
the degree to which it needed to

depend upon the universities for basic
science. . ~ the universities got
themselves on a growth track. The
money was coming fast and furiously;
the universities were able to hire a lot of
tenured faculty to build large facilities,
to buy the best of equipment, and the
momentum was such That even when
the money coming from the federal
government began to dry up, the
universities didn't plan ahead. There
was no contingency planning. I think
that in some ways the universities
actually overshot: they kept growing
and expecting money past a time when
it made any sense to."
Prager, who holds a Ph.D. in
physiology from Stanford, also said that
while the total volume of research in
this country continues to increase each
year, universities feel pinched only
because funding has failed to increase
at the rate they expected it to.
Carol Scheman, the director of
federal relations for health and
biomedical research at the Association
of American Universities, one of the
educational organizations in
Washington with which Stanford works
closely, differed with Prager's
assessment.
While the bottom line on research is
up slightly, the recent shift away from
completely grant-oriented agencies to
defense-related research has taken
some sponsored work away from the
universities, she said. Because of this,
in-house university research sponsored
by the government is down 6.7 percent
from last year.
What is perhaps most significant
about the differing interpretations is
that they seem to represent a common
theme in Washington these days.
In financial aids, for example, the
educational lobbying organizations
such as the Association of American
Universities and the American Council
on Education claim the president's
proposed fiscal 1983 budget would "put
college beyond the reach of several
hundred thousand young Americans
.. . and force millionsof students to
change their college plans by
transferring to less expensive
institutions or dropping out entirely."
The Department of Education,
however, absolutely disagrees with the
conclusion. Asked if there are students
who will not be able to go to college
under the FYB3 budget who can afford

to attend now, deputy undersecretary
Jones replied, "No. That's been one of
the major distortions of the
administration's proposals."
Nobody can really calculate who is
right, only because the answer would to
a great degree involve the extent to
which future students would be willing
to sacrifice —and go heavily into debt
to obtain higher education.
Even with proposed budget
cuts, it is of course ludicrous to
posit a complete severing of
the relationship between the federal
government and the universities or a
devastating break in the friendship built
up over the last generation. However, it
may be equally ludicrous to assume that
federal support of higher education will
continue along the growth track of the
past 30 years.
University administrators may thus be
wise to evaluate carefully their financial
needs and highest priorities,
recognizing that some cuts are
probably inevitable. Their credibility
will almost certainly be at risk if they
attack all cuts indiscriminately, and fail
to indicate those areas where they
might be able to endure some
retrenchment. Misguided proposals
such as indirect cost recovery-cutting
may be a direct function of the
administrators' unwillingness to accept
direct cuts in other areas.
Finally, the increase in government
regulation of universities may not be
irreversible. Without question, many
forms of government support do
represent sound long-term investments
in the future of the nation, and of the
world. But not all forms do. If leaders in
higher education manifest cooperation
in the difficult process of restoring the
nation's economic health, they may be
able to reapproach the level of trust and
goodwill that characterized the
friendship for so many years.
Friendship, friendship,
Just a perfect blendship.. .
When other friendships have been
forgot,
Ours will still be hot!
It's friendship, friendship,
Just a perfect blendship. . .
When other friendships
have ceased to jell,
Ours will still be swell!
Cole Porter,
from Dußarry Was A Lady
To hear many officials from both
universities and the federal
government tell the story,
"Friendship" may as well be the tune
the two establishments have been
singing to each other since the creation
of an extraordinary partnership more
than a quarter-century ago.
The friendship, they say, represents
an interdependence which grew out of
the notion, developed during World
War 11 and just after, that major
universities like Stanford had the
capability and were indeed best able to
conduct research as well as other
programs in the national interest, and
therefore deserved increasing federal
support.
Originally the idea came out of
university efforts to aid the national
defense. Soon enough, however, it was
applied to other areas, such as health,
agriculture, space exploration (spurred
by the Soviet Sputnik program) and
even social policy. Universities began to
rely on the federal government for
partial funding in almostall areas of
university operation, including student
financial aid, while the government
invested in them to train the nation's
best minds.
judging by continued legislative
backing and university acceptance,
both groups saw federal support as a
sound economic investment, as well as
a socially desirable goal.
Time will tell whether society will
continue to promote the idea that
government ought to play such a major
role in the support of higher education.
But there is no question that a series of
events in the past few years has put
some strains on the friendship, and that
something of a national debate is being
conducted about just how the
relationship should proceed.
Ironically, at the same time that the
government threatens to withdraw
funding, it mayalso play an increasing
role in regulating universities and in
demanding accountability forthe
dollars it does offer. Educational
institutions are not necessarily going to
be accorded the same degree of trust to
run themselves that they have enjoyed
in the past.
In short, the universities like Stanford
are finding that they are no longer
sacred, and that the friendship is
undergoing redefinition.
The problem is that one of the friends
the federal government has
started to question just how "mutual"
the friendship is. Figuratively speaking,
a new administration in Washington is
singing a different Cole Porter tune, this
one from Anything Goes: "Times have
changed, and we've often rewound the
clock.. ."
While the university administrators,
including Stanford President Donald
Kennedy, tend to claim that any money
given them or their students is a crucial
investment in the long-term health of

the nation, the government
particularly reflected in the attitude of
President Ronald Reagan is calling
for cuts in many areas of both research
and student aid funding. It says support
levels must be cut back to regain the
fiscally responsible policy necessary to
thatsame long-term health of the
nation.
Reagan administration officials call
for greater institutional self-reliance,
saying the universities can do virtually
the same quality jobon leanerfederal
contributions, especially if they solicit
alternative funds more actively. They
also say students can get by on much
less direct federal aid and loan support.
Conflict is apparent in other areas as
well. The government has, in the past
five years, mandated that universities
show more accountability for federal
funds by reporting out the efforts of
personnel involved in federally funded
projects. This represents a break with a
previous era in which almost total trust
was placed in universities to spend
money as it had been earmarked.
As a means of budget-cutting, at least
one major federal agency the
National Institutes of Health has
proposed that universities not be
reimbursed in full forthe indirect costs

pertaining to federally funded work,
such as utilities and certain clerical
support. Previously, the universities
and the government had negotiated
formulas by which these expenses were
treated as being as legitimate as direct
costs.
As well, a number of incidents,
including some here, involving federal
requests for universities to monitor the
activities of foreign (especially Eastern
Bloc) scholars visiting campuses has
brought claims of national security
interests directly into conflict with the

ideal of academic freedom.
Finally, in many other areas
universities have found they are not
only becoming subject to government
control, but are being treated as
economic entities no different from
private industry. These areas include
medical care administration for those
universities with major medical centers,
the Affirmative Action requirements
designed to ensure equal job access for
minorites and women, and health
regulations governing occupational
safety or the treatment in research of
human and animal subjects.
At Stanford, a core of
administrators in the Office of
Public Affairs has assumed the
increasingly important and complex
task of representing the University's
interests in Washington. These
specialists in government relations act
as lobbyists (although they are not
officially registered as such) within the
legislative process. They also work
closely with educational associations
based in Washington that represent the
interests of their member schools.
Stanford makes its presence felt in
the nation's capital at least as much as
does any other university. This view was

repeated in Da/7y interviews not only by
the University's allies in Washington,
butalso by a numberof congressmen,
and certain officials who actively
oppose Stanford in legislative battles.
This recognition partly stems from
the vitality of the Stanford government
relations program, and partly from the
priority that its president places on
federal matters. Kennedy is clearly an
effective politician. He is also respected
in Washington for his performance as
commissioner of the Food and Drug
Administration from 1977 to 1979 and

for his knowledge of how government
operates.
Set against this backdrop of
university-government
relations is an incipient sense of
urgency for university adminstrators, as
well as students and faculty, to
understand the development of this
involvement. Administrators
acknowledge that this understanding is
important in determining the
universities' purpose, and the direction
of higher education.
In the words of Stanford's vice
president for public affairs, Robert
Rosenzweig, "The government is
simply a part of our life. If you want
to understanda university like Stanford,
you have to understand its relationship
to the federal government. Never mind
whether you approve of it or
disapprove of it you have to
understand it. A modern American
university is incomprehensible unless
you come to terms with the role of the
federal government."
Stanford University has been either a
particularly fortunate participant in the
great flowering of university
government involvement, or,
alternately, it has been a particularly
avaricious culprit in an era which has
created unrealistic expectations about
the extent to which the federal
government ought to support higher
education.
In any case, Stanford last year
received nearly $2OO million in federal
contracts and grants (including
financial aid) —a figure equivalent to
46.5 percent of the University's total
operating expenditures, excepting
construction and renovation of major
facilities.
Moreover, according to the Office of
the Dean of Graduate Studies and
Research, Stanford has received
somewhere between 2.5 and 3.1
percent of the total federal outlay for
research and developmenttocolleges
and universities each year since 1963.
Among all educational institutions,
Stanford has been either second, third
or fourth in total funds received each
year but one during that time. (MIT has
ranked first each year, with the other
top spots shared among the University
of Washington, Stanford, Harvard and
the University of California at San
Diego.)
In financial aid in the most recent
year, the federal government gave
Stanford nearly $4 million in direct
support of institutional loan or grant
programs and another $5 million to
individuals in the University.
Perhaps more important than any
statistics, however, is the debate about
the wisdom of accepting even
depending upon such a large
amount of federal support. Those who
favorthe policy amongthem
Kennedy and Rosenzweig say the
government gets a "bargain" for any
investment it makes in education, and
that the government has until recently
made no attempt to control the
workings of the universities in
proportion to the support they receive.
Thus, they say, the government
should be at least as opposed as schools
like Stanford to reducing federal
commitment and to increasing
regulations that would make it more
difficult for universities to do their job.



Mark Wilson/Daily
Until fairly recently, Rosenzweig said,
this benevolent attitude was in fact
prevalent: "1 don't suppose there's ever
been a patron in the history of
philanthropy .. . asgenerousand as
relatively free of control as the federal
government was in the support of
research and higher education in this
country between 1950 and 1970,1975
maybe."
Some, however, see the matter in an
entirely different light. Where
university administrators see a
"partnership," government officials see
a free ride spinning out of control.
Where educational leaders talk of
"investment" in educational
institutions by the government,
government officials talk of those
leaders' unwillingness to seek funds
elsewere, to wean themselves off the
federal dole.
Gary Jones, the Department of
Education's deputy undersecretary for

planning, said, "Every university
president attempts to address their
needs in any way thatthey deem
possible, and obviously they would
prefer that the federal government
continue to fund at the level they're
funding, so they need not reassess the
allocations of their dollars within their
institution. So I'm notsurprised that
university presidents are saying, 'Hey,
we simply are facing dire
consequences.' The fact is, I don't
believe that.
"There are institutions Stanford,
Harvard and others while they're

for some reason people believe

continue to operate in deficit spending,
and it doesn't hurt the federal
government to do that, but it certainly
would hurt us to do that."

Finally, Jones said, Stanford "needs to
ask, 'Where can we get more dollars
without going tothefederal
government. Can we get more through
the philanthropic process in this nation,
can we get more from the state of

Kennedy countered, "We're not

a range of things it will not be possible
