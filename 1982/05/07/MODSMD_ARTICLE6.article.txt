# Money: Government assumes the role of patron of research efforts
## 
### Samuel Howe 
Every year there is a chorus of
groans about proposed tuition
increases, but those who
develop the University's budget know
that whatever figure is finally agreed
upon and delivered by students it
will still comprise only a relatively small
portion (usually less than one-fifth) of
the University's operating
expenditures.
In fact, in the 1980-81 budget year,
tuition and student fees represented
hardly a third of the amount that came
from another single source: the federal
government. Of the sources of
Stanford's operating expenditures,

which represent the University's total
expenditures except for construction
and renovation of major facilities,
government contracts and grants made
up 46.5 percent of the total. Gifts and
non-government grants, meanwhile,
made up 8.9 percent of the total.
The government-contributed figure
came to $l9B million. It is directed
primarily toward research â€”some $lBO
million worth. The other money is used
for construction, non-research grants
and financial aid programs. At Stanford,
the government sponsors more than 15
times the volume of research of all
other sponsors here combined, and,
last year, 91 percent of the total volume
of research. Science and engineering
fields, including the Medical Center,
received more than three-quarters of
those funds.
The percentage of Stanford's
expenditures represented by federal
contributions has increased
astronomically from the period before
the 19505, when major research

universities had very little financial
support from the federal government.
By 1952, the University was receiving
about $3.5 million from government
sources less than 2 percent of today's
figures (in dollars unadjusted for
inflation).
By 1968, government contributions
made up 58.7 percent of Stanford's
annual expenditures, and this figure
dropped a year later (to 49.5 percent,
and eventually into the 30s, before
risingtocurrent levels) onlyafterthe
Faculty Senate voted that the University
stop accepting classified research
contracts.
The 1980-81 levels represent the last
full budget process under President
Jimmy Carter.

Federal funding comes here through
a complex process of applications and
appropriations, and much of it comes
with restrictions and regulations. Here,
the crucial link in this exchange is the
University's Sponsored Projects Office,
which monitors and reports on almost
all federal contracts and grants, in
addition to any work individual faculty
members or other researchers must do
to secure them. Furthermore,
Sponsored Projects reviews all non
government work.

Many people, including
representatives of the federal
government, have suggested that
universities rely fartoo much on the
government for money.
"Stanford is quite dependent on the
federal government for our program
here," Sponsored Projects Director Earl
Cilley said. "I think we have more
federal funds here as a proportion of

the total than would in some sense be
desirable.. . Butthat would only be
true in asubstantive way if we thought
the government was going to start
behaving as a monolith." Cilley
suggested that if the government
created a single agency responsible for
all research funding, Stanford could be
subjected to great danger.
"That's not the case now; federal
agencies are not monolithic," he said.
Moreover, Stanford President
Donald Kennedy said he doubts federal
funding has really affected the
academicdirectionstaken and
decisions made by Stanford. "I think
generally government research policy
has been quite good at keeping a wide
view of the horizon. I don't think that,
considering the government funding in
toto, it has produced a very much
different result than would have been
produced by a whole set of faculty
interests acting independently.. .It's
an enormous credittoour political
system that government support has
been produced in a pattern and a
fashion that is so respectful of the
independence of private universities."
Kennedy also said as have many
other college presidents in response to
President Ronald Reagan's budget-

cutting proposals that the nation
should be at least as interested in
supporting research grants as the
universities are in receiving them. "I
think it would be very shortsighted of
the government not to do it, because I
think it's quite clear that maintaining
the intellectual capital for a vigorous
and innovative research establishment
is absolutely essential to productivity,
and the nation that neglects that makes
a serious mistake."
On the other hand, Gary Jones,
deputy undersecretary for planning in
the Department of Education, said that
universities ought to be able to
maintain their standards of quality with
Reagan's budget proposals by some
tightening within the budget process
and retrenching on unnecessary
programs.
Rep. Pete McCloskey (R-Menlo
Park), whose district presently includes
the University, said, "There is as much
waste in some of those academic
departments.. . There is no operation
of any government agency or anybody
funded by government that cannot
waste money. At NIH (the National
Institutes of Health) we find guys doing
projects they shouldn't be doing. But
because they've built their little empire
... they keep the project going."
Stanford's director of government
relations, Larry Horton, said the
University has done "serious
stocktaking" of its financial situation
throughout the past decade and cited
the Budget Adjustmentand Budget
Equalization programs (BAP and BEP)
here in the 19705. While there may be
much waste at other institutions, said

Horton, "That's just not true here."
And Carol Scheman, the Association
of American Universities' director of
federal relations for health and
biomedical research, said the proposed
cuts go far beyond waste reduction in
government agencies. "The sum effects
of the program we're looking at are
much more than a no-growth
situation," she said. "We're looking at
severe cuts in the size and the number
of NIH grants, a major portion (of
which) go to the universities.. . What's
really happening is that the (research)
infrastructure is being decimated."
In any event, increasingly scarce
funds are coming with greater
restrictions and regulations. Even as
they do, the universities' immunity
from control has begun to wane as well.
"Highereducation expenditures
came to be less unquestioningly made
by the government," said Rosenzweig.
"(It) began to be concerned with things
such as accountability, the civil rights
movement and the women's
movement." At the same time, "The
colleges and universities losttheir
immunity from the regulations to which
the other actors in society were
subject."

However, Rosenzweig said the
reason for some of those controls has
nothing to do with the universities
themselves. "People frequently
confuse those kinds of regulations that
come to universities because they are
educational and research institutions
... and those kinds of regulationsthat
come simply because we're operating
in a society that increasingly seeks

'Basic research is so clearly a
responsibility of the government in a
modern society that it seems to me
hardly worth arguing about
anymore. It's an activity that has no
specific benefit to any potential
sponsor, but clearly and broadly
distributed benefits to society
Robert Rosenzweig, vice
president for public affairs

'The universities got themselves on a
growth track. The momentum ivas
such that even when the money
coming from the federal
government began to dry up, the
universities didn't plan ahead. I
think that in some ways the
universities actually overshot: they
kept growing and expecting money
past a time when it made any sense

protection for its members.
"There's no conceivable argument
that we ought to be immune from it/'
continued Rosenzweig, or "that our
employees are entitled to less
protection than employees who do the
same kind of work someplace else."
Nobody really knows exactly how
much the University can expect to
receive in future years or how many
additional regulations there will be.
Many of those decisions will be made
by future politicians (and the voters
who elect them), and by the
administrators.

And although assessments of what
could happen if the Reagan budget
proposals are passed differ widely,
University administrators say they are
actually doing little in the way of
planning, and will instead waittosee
exactly what will happen to
government funding levels.
"We have not done much
contingency planning to say X (budget
cut) will do this, V will do that," said Ray
Bacchetti, vice provost and the
University's budget director.
"Sometimes it's better to wait untilthat
sort of thing is absolutely needed."

In addition to those who charge
that the University risks yielding
the ability to set its own direction
and to plan for the institution on a
long-term basis by accepting so
much government money, another
group says it also abrogrates a degree of
moral responsibility by accepting
certain forms of research contracts.
They usually refer to nuclear research
and to research done for the Defense
Department, which sponsored 12
percent of the federally sponsored
research funding at Stanford last year.
In a speech delivered last fall at a
symposium on "the Optimum
Utilization of Knowledge," Mechanical
Engineering Prof. Bernard Roth said,
"The defense establishment will
continue to be a major financier for
selected segments of our civilian
educational, research and production
efforts, thereby continuing to define,
the types of knowledge our society
deems most critical.
"The knowledge the arms race
creates," said Roth, " is primarily for the
purpose of continuing the arms race.
Throughout the Cold War the
knowledge to perpetuate the arms race
has been much more sought after than
the knowledge to end it. It is in this
subversion of values that the arms race
has had its greatest impact on the
optimum utilization of knowledge."
Robert Rosenzweig, vice president
for public affairs, said, "I think it's very

hard to control the uses of knowledge
by controlling the production of
knowledge. The way to control the uses
of knowledge isto think very hard
about those applications and try to
construct, if they don't already exist,
social mechanisms for limiting harmful
applications. The least efficient and
most damaging way to try to do that, it
seems to me, is to try to cut knowledge
off at its source."

Moreover, said Rosenzweig,
decisions about what research is done
at the University are and should be
made at an individual level, rather than
through University-imposed guidelines
(except for the stipulation here that all
research be open and unclassified).
"The individual faculty member has to
decide whether the research which he
proposes to do has potential
applications, or likely applications, that
are so damaging, so destructive, so
contrary to his own notions of moral
behavior, that he doesn't want to be
engaged in it."
Kennedy said it is often difficult for
one to determine the potential
applications of any particular kind of
research. Lasers, he said, have
enormous potential for both
destructive and medical purposes.
Junior Doug Dietrich, who teaches a
SWOPSI class called "The Bomb Next
Door: Nuclear Weapons Proliferation
in the Bay Area," said he thinks military
aid to research is far greater than is

(in percentage)

necessary and that researchers here
ought to "start thinking, 'Hey, enough
of the military,' even if it means hard
times, that (research) funds will never
come.
"Military aid weakensthe civilian
economy, where the real strength of
the nation is," said Dietrich. Further, he
said, weapons research has reached
"irrational" limits: "I'm just not ever
going to be comfortable with a balance
of terror, with the rationality of
irrational actors."
That argument is countered by Leo
Young, director of research and
technical information for the Office of
the Undersecretary of Defense for
Research and Engineering. "I have no
sympathy whatsoever for people who
say that, that there should be no
connection between the universities
and defense. There is no question in my
mind that our society as a free society is
morally sosuperiortoa police state, like
you have in Russia and many other
countries too, and that those states are
dangerous to themselves as well as to
the world. If we are not prepared to
defend ourselves, we are going to be in
trouble. We can't just let our defenses
down and hope for the best:"

The sum effects of the program
we're looking at are much more
than a no-growth situation. We're
looking at severe cuts in the size and
the number of NIH grants, a major
portion (of which) go to the
universities... What's really
happening is that the (research)
infrastructure is being decimated.'
