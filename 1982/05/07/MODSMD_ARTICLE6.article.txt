# Money: Government assumes the role of patron of research efforts
## 
### Samuel Howe 
Every year there is a chorus of
groans about proposed tuition
increases, but those who
develop the University's budget know
that whatever figure is finally agreed
upon and delivered by students it
will still comprise only a relatively small
portion (usually less than one-fifth) of
the University's operating
expenditures.
In fact, in the 1980-81 budget year,
tuition and student fees represented
hardly a third of the amount that came
from another single source: the federal
government. Of the sources of
Stanford's operating expenditures,

which represent the University's total
expenditures except for construction
and renovation of major facilities,
government contracts and grants made
up 46.5 percent of the total. Gifts and
non-government grants, meanwhile,
made up 8.9 percent of the total.
The government-contributed figure
came to $l9B million. It is directed
primarily toward research â€”some $lBO
million worth. The other money is used
for construction, non-research grants
and financial aid programs. At Stanford,
the government sponsors more than 15
times the volume of research of all
other sponsors here combined, and,
last year, 91 percent of the total volume
of research. Science and engineering
fields, including the Medical Center,
received more than three-quarters of
those funds.
The percentage of Stanford's
expenditures represented by federal
contributions has increased
astronomically from the period before
the 19505, when major research

universities had very little financial
support from the federal government.
By 1952, the University was receiving
about $3.5 million from government
sources less than 2 percent of today's
figures (in dollars unadjusted for
inflation).
By 1968, government contributions
made up 58.7 percent of Stanford's
annual expenditures, and this figure
dropped a year later (to 49.5 percent,
and eventually into the 30s, before
risingtocurrent levels) onlyafterthe
Faculty Senate voted that the University
stop accepting classified research
contracts.
The 1980-81 levels represent the last
full budget process under President
Jimmy Carter.

Federal funding comes here through
a complex process of applications and
appropriations, and much of it comes
with restrictions and regulations. Here,
the crucial link in this exchange is the
University's Sponsored Projects Office,
which monitors and reports on almost
all federal contracts and grants, in
addition to any work individual faculty
members or other researchers must do
to secure them. Furthermore,
Sponsored Projects reviews all non
government work.

Many people, including
representatives of the federal
government, have suggested that
universities rely fartoo much on the
government for money.
"Stanford is quite dependent on the
federal government for our program
here," Sponsored Projects Director Earl
Cilley said. "I think we have more
federal funds here as a proportion of

the total than would in some sense be
desirable.. . Butthat would only be
true in asubstantive way if we thought
the government was going to start
behaving as a monolith." Cilley
suggested that if the government
created a single agency responsible for
all research funding, Stanford could be
subjected to great danger.
"That's not the case now; federal
agencies are not monolithic," he said.
Moreover, Stanford President
Donald Kennedy said he doubts federal
funding has really affected the
academicdirectionstaken and
decisions made by Stanford. "I think
generally government research policy
has been quite good at keeping a wide
view of the horizon. I don't think that,
considering the government funding in
toto, it has produced a very much
different result than would have been
produced by a whole set of faculty
interests acting independently.. .It's
an enormous credittoour political
system that government support has
been produced in a pattern and a
fashion that is so respectful of the
independence of private universities."
Kennedy also said as have many
other college presidents in response to
President Ronald Reagan's budget-

cutting proposals that the nation
should be at least as interested in
supporting research grants as the
universities are in receiving them. "I
think it would be very shortsighted of
the government not to do it, because I
think it's quite clear that maintaining
the intellectual capital for a vigorous
and innovative research establishment
is absolutely essential to productivity,
and the nation that neglects that makes
a serious mistake."
On the other hand, Gary Jones,
deputy undersecretary for planning in
the Department of Education, said that
universities ought to be able to
maintain their standards of quality with
Reagan's budget proposals by some
tightening within the budget process
and retrenching on unnecessary
programs.
Rep. Pete McCloskey (R-Menlo
Park), whose district presently includes
the University, said, "There is as much
waste in some of those academic
departments.. . There is no operation
of any government agency or anybody
funded by government that cannot
waste money. At NIH (the National
Institutes of Health) we find guys doing
projects they shouldn't be doing. But
because they've built their little empire
... they keep the project going."
Stanford's director of government
relations, Larry Horton, said the
University has done "serious
stocktaking" of its financial situation
throughout the past decade and cited
the Budget Adjustmentand Budget
Equalization programs (BAP and BEP)
here in the 19705. While there may be
much waste at other institutions, said

Horton, "That's just not true here."
And Carol Scheman, the Association
of American Universities' director of
federal relations for health and
biomedical research, said the proposed
cuts go far beyond waste reduction in
government agencies. "The sum effects
of the program we're looking at are
much more than a no-growth
situation," she said. "We're looking at
severe cuts in the size and the number
of NIH grants, a major portion (of
which) go to the universities.. . What's
really happening is that the (research)
infrastructure is being decimated."
In any event, increasingly scarce
funds are coming with greater
restrictions and regulations. Even as
they do, the universities' immunity
from control has begun to wane as well.
"Highereducation expenditures
came to be less unquestioningly made
by the government," said Rosenzweig.
"(It) began to be concerned with things
such as accountability, the civil rights
movement and the women's
movement." At the same time, "The
colleges and universities losttheir
immunity from the regulations to which
the other actors in society were
subject."

However, Rosenzweig said the
reason for some of those controls has
nothing to do with the universities
themselves. "People frequently
confuse those kinds of regulations that
come to universities because they are
educational and research institutions
... and those kinds of regulationsthat
come simply because we're operating
in a society that increasingly seeks

'Basic research is so clearly a
responsibility of the government in a
modern society that it seems to me
hardly worth arguing about
anymore. It's an activity that has no
specific benefit to any potential
sponsor, but clearly and broadly
distributed benefits to society
Robert Rosenzweig, vice
president for public affairs

'The universities got themselves on a
growth track. The momentum ivas
such that even when the money
coming from the federal
government began to dry up, the
universities didn't plan ahead. I
think that in some ways the
universities actually overshot: they
kept growing and expecting money
past a time when it made any sense
