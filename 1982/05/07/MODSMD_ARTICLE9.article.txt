# Financial aid: Uncertainty shrouds the issue of student support
## 
### Kathy Bodovitz 
As President Ronald Reagan pushes Congress
to accept his proposed cuts in federal student
financial aid, many university students
present and prospective wonder if they will be able
to afford to go to school next year.
While no one is able to predict the precise effect on
students of the proposed cuts, everyone seems to
agree that students at expensive institutions like
Stanford will suffer the most.
In terms of the potential effects of the cuts,
everyone has his own opinion. While the Department
of Education (DED) claims that under the new
allocations, no student would be barred from
attending school for lack of money, the American
Council on Education (ACE) believes that the cuts
would make college education impossible for
millions of students. University officials here seem to
be unsure as to what the outcome would be.
The Reagan administration's proposed education
cuts for the fiscal year (FY) 1983 budget are a product
of a new philosophysummarized by Gary Jones, DED
deputy undersecretary for planning: "Seemingly,
everyone believes that the first commitment (to
education) has been the responsibility of the federal
government. . . We're simply suggesting that families
should share a larger burden of the cost of their
children attending colleges and universities."
Jones pointed out that between 1978 and 1981,
while family income increased 30 percent,
contributions to higher education actually decreased
6 percent.
Opponents of both the philosophy and the
proposals, such as Charles Saunders, vice president

for governmental relations for the ACE, believe: "The
(Reagan) administration is moving toward outright
rejection of federal responsibility for access to higher
educaton, a tenet that has united Republicans and
Democrats since the Eisenhower administration."
President Dwight Eisenhower, concerned with
national defense, initiated the National Defense
Education Act which stated, "The Congress hereby
finds and declares that the security of the Nation
requires the fullest development of the mental
resurces and technical skills of its young men and
women." Access to education then was viewed as a
form of insurance for national security, not
necessarily a social good.
President Lyndon Johnson reaffirmed the
commitment by the Higher Education Act of 1965,
saying, "I propose that we declare a national goal of
full educational opportunity .. .We want this not
only for (the student's) sake but for the nation's
sake."
His successor, Richard Nixon, expanded the
commitment and the resulting Education
Amendment of 1972 established Basic Educational

Opportunity (Pell) Grants as a national program.
Nixon said, "No qualified student who wants to go to
college should be barred by lack of money."
Signing an education amendment in 1980,
President Jimmy Carter said, "Through the Middle
Income Student Assistance Act (passed in 1978) we've
brought college within the reach of every student in
this nation who's qualified for higher education. The
idea that lack of money should be no barrier to a
college education is no longer a dream, it's a reality
n
Current Secretary of Education Terrel Bell says
thatthe Reagan administration isstill
committed "to provide access to higher
education for the truly needy," but describes the
present program as "way out of hand" and claims that
"windingdown inflation . . . is perhaps the single
most important thing we can do."
David Stockman, director of the Office of
Management and Budget, told the House Budget
Committee in October, "I do not accept tbe notion
that the federal government has an obligation to fund
generous grants to anybody that wants to go to
college. It seems to me that if people want to go to
college bad enough, then there is opportunity and
responsibility on their part to finance their way
through the bestthey can."
DED points out that in 1960 the federal
government's commitment to needy college students
consisted of $4O million in Direct Student Loans. In
1966 the appropriation for grants and loans was $346.4
million, and in 1973 the total was $1.2 billion. "This

administration is proposing an appropriation of $4.3
billion for these same programs in 1983 over 100
times or 10,000 percent as much support for college
students as in 1960/' a DED statement said.
The administration is not only proposing future
cuts for FYB3 but rescissions in the FYB2 allocations as
well, so portions of many student aid programs are
still in jeopardy.
The proposed rescissions in FYB2 student aid
funding (for the 1982-83 academic year) include $9l
million from the Pell Grants; $44 million from Work-
Study; $6 million from SSIGs; $9.9 million from the
TRIO programs; $1.9 million from publicservice
fellowships; and $O.l million from law school
fellowships for minorities.
Probably the most discussed area of the proposed
FYB3 cuts is graduate exclusion from the GSL
program. The ACE contends that a majority of the
nation's graduate students, currently relying on GSLs,
may be unable to continue their education if the
administration's recommendations are adopted.
The Department of Education, on the other hand,
claims that if the student pays his interest as it accrues,

through part-time work, family help, etc., his
repayment burden would increase a maximum of 5
percent under the administration's proposal.
In addition, the administration is proposingthatthe
GSL Auxiliary Loan program, Auxiliary Loans to Assist
Students (ALAS), take"up some of the burden of
graduate loans. This is a state-run program that will
provide loans at 14 percent interest, and repayment
must begin 60 days after the loan is taken out.
Arthur Marmaduke, director of the California
Student Aid Commission in Sacramento, said he
hopes the state program, CLAS, will be operational in
California this summer so students can take out loans
for this fall.
The problem is that only "seven very, very small
lenders have agreed to participate," he said. Many
more larger lenders are still needed, he said, to make
the program functional.
Asked if the CLAS program is an adequate
substitute for the GSL program Marmaduke said,
"Absolutely not." He said that while the interest
payments on the first $3OO borrowed may not be
unbearable, by a graduate student's third or fourth
year, his payment will be $250-300 per month. "It
seems to me that negates the whole purpose of the
program," he said.
Gerald Lieberman, vice provost and dean of
graduate studies and research, said GSLs are still up in
the air for next year. He also pointed out that the
ALAS program is not yet operating in California and
that it "ultimately amounts to increased debt that
graduate students accrue."
Lieberman said that this increased debt will force
students to place a higher consideration on the
salaries offered in their field, and will discourage
people from going into academic careers because
they don't pay relatively well.
For medical students, Lieberman said that incurring
large debt will force the hand of physicians"to go out
and make a quick buck."
A DED statement expressed the situation
differently: "For borrowers who can expect their
training to result in professional salaries, this added
burden can be handled." The statement did say, "In
some cases, graduate student debt could be increased
more than 60 percent if the in-school interest is
accrued to principal. . . Those who do not expect
their graduate training to yield sufficient income
should not undertake such loans."
Lieberman said that for next year, the National
Science Federation and National Institutes of Health
stipends for graduate students will be continued.
Karlene Dickey, director of graduate awards, pointed
out that most doctoral students in Humanities and
Sciences are admitted with fellowships and
assistanceships already in hand and therefore the loan
cuts will not severely affect them.
Dickey said the crunch will fall on masters students
who rely on loans, and she said that graduate students
borrowed $6 million last year. Dickey said, "We don't
expect any particular change in grants and fellowhips
for the coming year, but we just don't know what will
happen in Washington."
Lieberman said that while it is very hard to assess the
impact of the reduction in loans, it is possible that
students already admitted to Stanford for next year
may not show up because of indebtedness. "A larger
no-show rate wouldn't surprise me, especially in the
masters programs," he said.
He also noted that "it's possible that if the loan
program is made less attractive, we may see a larger
proportion of foreign students doing graduate work
here." This year, he said, there was a higher increase
in foreign applications than in domesticapplications.
Most graduate students pay their own way and the
University's policy is to admit students based on
merit.

Michele Leiser, financial aid
assistant at the business school,
said that 72 percent of the
business students receive some
support through GSLs, which
totals $2 million. "If they (GSLs)
are cut it will have a substantial
effect on our students," she
said.
The Business School, Leiser
said, has committed itself to
covering the GSL loans for next
year through Business School
loans, which are normally a last
resort. However, she added,
"We can't promise to cover the
GSLs for more than one year."
The picture looks more

secure for Stanford
undergraduates, according to
Robert Huff, director of
financial aids, because the
University has decided it will
make up any grant funds cut by
the federal government, and
University President Donald
Kennedy vows that the
University will maintain its aid
blind admissions policy.
"The undergraduate student
who demonstrates financial
need is reasonably secure,"
Huff said, "because Stanford
has the meansand
commitment to assure that he
will be able to attend."
However Kennedy said, "I

can't tell you what will happen
after five years of economic
disaster, nobody can. All I can
tell you is that (aid-blind
admissions) is such a high
priority that it will beoneofthe
last things to go."
As to the state of both this
year's and next year's budget,
Huff said, "We don't expect
any further cuts. Those
amounts (proposed in the
rescissions) could be changed,
but I don'tthinkthey will be."
To help make upfor lost
grant money, Huff said the
University is looking to outside
sources and is especially trying
to attract private support,

which hesaidcould make upa
great part of the lost grant
money.
Huff admitted that more
problems exist at the graduate
level. "The prospects are good
for next year," he said, "but
beyond that I'm uncertain." He
said that this year graduate
students borrowed a total of
$l2 million, $8 million in GSLs
and $4 million in other loans.
"There is no question that
Stanford will find some source
to make up funds if the GSLs
are cut (to graduate students),"
Huff said, "but the question is
whether it will be acceptable."
He said that while the

University has a long history of
commitment to meeting the
financial needs of its
undergraduates, the situation
is more complicated for
graduate students. "What is the
appropriate number of
students in each field, how
many jobs will there be?" he
asked.
"Stanford has a strong
commitment to its gradute
students," Huff said, "but that
commitment is somewhat
decentralized. It reflects the
commitment of each school
and the labor market
situation."
So where does all this leave
students? Probably confused
and angry. Council of
Presidents (COP) member
Dragan Popov said that during
the COP's two-day letter
writing campaign in White
Plaza last month more than 100
students wrote letters to
congressmen and that similar
campaigns were held at the
Law, Business and Medical
schools.
However, Rep. Pete
McCloskey (R-Menlo Park)
told the Daily, "I haven't had a
word from anybody at Stanford
saying, 'Keep it.'"

impact of the reduction in loans, it is possible that
students already admitted to Stanford for next year
may not show up because of indebtedness. "A larger
no-show rate wouldn't surprise me, especially in the
masters programs," he said.
He also noted that "it's possible that if the loan
program is made less attractive, we may see a larger
proportion of foreign students doing graduate work
here." This year, he said, there was a higher increase
in foreign applications than in domesticapplications.
Most graduate students pay their own way and the
University's policy is to admit students based on
merit.

Michele Leiser, financial aid
assistant at the business school,
said that 72 percent of the
business students receive some
support through GSLs, which
totals $2 million. "If they (GSLs)
are cut it will have a substantial
effect on our students," she
said.
The Business School, Leiser
said, has committed itself to
covering the GSL loans for next
year through Business School
loans, which are normally a last
resort. However, she added,
"We can't promise to cover the
GSLs for more than one year."
The picture looks more

secure for Stanford
undergraduates, according to
Robert Huff, director of
financial aids, because the
University has decided it will
make up any grant funds cut by
the federal government, and
University President Donald
Kennedy vows that the
University will maintain its aid
blind admissions policy.
"The undergraduate student
who demonstrates financial
need is reasonably secure,"
Huff said, "because Stanford
has the meansand
commitment to assure that he
will be able to attend."
However Kennedy said, "I

can't tell you what will happen
after five years of economic
disaster, nobody can. All I can
tell you is that (aid-blind
admissions) is such a high
priority that it will beoneofthe
last things to go."
As to the state of both this
year's and next year's budget,
Huff said, "We don't expect
any further cuts. Those
amounts (proposed in the
rescissions) could be changed,
but I don'tthinkthey will be."
To help make upfor lost
grant money, Huff said the
University is looking to outside
sources and is especially trying
to attract private support,

which hesaidcould make upa
great part of the lost grant
money.
Huff admitted that more
problems exist at the graduate
level. "The prospects are good
for next year," he said, "but
beyond that I'm uncertain." He
said that this year graduate
students borrowed a total of
$l2 million, $8 million in GSLs
and $4 million in other loans.
"There is no question that
Stanford will find some source
to make up funds if the GSLs
are cut (to graduate students),"
Huff said, "but the question is
whether it will be acceptable."
He said that while the

University has a long history of
commitment to meeting the
financial needs of its
undergraduates, the situation
is more complicated for
graduate students. "What is the
appropriate number of
students in each field, how
many jobs will there be?" he
asked.
"Stanford has a strong
commitment to its gradute
students," Huff said, "but that
commitment is somewhat
decentralized. It reflects the
commitment of each school
and the labor market
situation."
So where does all this leave
students? Probably confused
and angry. Council of
Presidents (COP) member
Dragan Popov said that during
the COP's two-day letter
writing campaign in White
Plaza last month more than 100
students wrote letters to
congressmen and that similar
campaigns were held at the
Law, Business and Medical
schools.
However, Rep. Pete
McCloskey (R-Menlo Park)
told the Daily, "I haven't had a
word from anybody at Stanford
saying, 'Keep it.'"
As President Ronald Reagan pushes Congress
to accept his proposed cuts in federal student
financial aid, many university students
present and prospective wonder if they will be able
to afford to go to school next year.
While no one is able to predict the precise effect on
students of the proposed cuts, everyone seems to
agree that students at expensive institutions like
Stanford will suffer the most.
In terms of the potential effects of the cuts,
everyone has his own opinion. While the Department
of Education (DED) claims that under the new
allocations, no student would be barred from
attending school for lack of money, the American
Council on Education (ACE) believes that the cuts
would make college education impossible for
millions of students. University officials here seem to
be unsure as to what the outcome would be.
The Reagan administration's proposed education
cuts for the fiscal year (FY) 1983 budget are a product
of a new philosophysummarized by Gary Jones, DED
deputy undersecretary for planning: "Seemingly,
everyone believes that the first commitment (to
education) has been the responsibility of the federal
government. . . We're simply suggesting that families
should share a larger burden of the cost of their
children attending colleges and universities."
Jones pointed out that between 1978 and 1981,
while family income increased 30 percent,
contributions to higher education actually decreased
6 percent.
Opponents of both the philosophy and the
proposals, such as Charles Saunders, vice president

for governmental relations for the ACE, believe: "The
(Reagan) administration is moving toward outright
rejection of federal responsibility for access to higher
educaton, a tenet that has united Republicans and
Democrats since the Eisenhower administration."
President Dwight Eisenhower, concerned with
national defense, initiated the National Defense
Education Act which stated, "The Congress hereby
finds and declares that the security of the Nation
requires the fullest development of the mental
resurces and technical skills of its young men and
women." Access to education then was viewed as a
form of insurance for national security, not
necessarily a social good.
President Lyndon Johnson reaffirmed the
commitment by the Higher Education Act of 1965,
saying, "I propose that we declare a national goal of
full educational opportunity .. .We want this not
only for (the student's) sake but for the nation's
sake."
His successor, Richard Nixon, expanded the
commitment and the resulting Education
Amendment of 1972 established Basic Educational

Opportunity (Pell) Grants as a national program.
Nixon said, "No qualified student who wants to go to
college should be barred by lack of money."
Signing an education amendment in 1980,
President Jimmy Carter said, "Through the Middle
Income Student Assistance Act (passed in 1978) we've
brought college within the reach of every student in
this nation who's qualified for higher education. The
idea that lack of money should be no barrier to a
college education is no longer a dream, it's a reality
n
Current Secretary of Education Terrel Bell says
thatthe Reagan administration isstill
committed "to provide access to higher
education for the truly needy," but describes the
present program as "way out of hand" and claims that
"windingdown inflation . . . is perhaps the single
most important thing we can do."
David Stockman, director of the Office of
Management and Budget, told the House Budget
Committee in October, "I do not accept tbe notion
that the federal government has an obligation to fund
generous grants to anybody that wants to go to
college. It seems to me that if people want to go to
college bad enough, then there is opportunity and
responsibility on their part to finance their way
through the bestthey can."
DED points out that in 1960 the federal
government's commitment to needy college students
consisted of $4O million in Direct Student Loans. In
1966 the appropriation for grants and loans was $346.4
million, and in 1973 the total was $1.2 billion. "This

administration is proposing an appropriation of $4.3
billion for these same programs in 1983 over 100
times or 10,000 percent as much support for college
students as in 1960/' a DED statement said.
The administration is not only proposing future
cuts for FYB3 but rescissions in the FYB2 allocations as
well, so portions of many student aid programs are
still in jeopardy.
The proposed rescissions in FYB2 student aid
funding (for the 1982-83 academic year) include $9l
million from the Pell Grants; $44 million from Work-
Study; $6 million from SSIGs; $9.9 million from the
TRIO programs; $1.9 million from publicservice
fellowships; and $O.l million from law school
fellowships for minorities.
Probably the most discussed area of the proposed
FYB3 cuts is graduate exclusion from the GSL
program. The ACE contends that a majority of the
nation's graduate students, currently relying on GSLs,
may be unable to continue their education if the
administration's recommendations are adopted.
The Department of Education, on the other hand,
claims that if the student pays his interest as it accrues,

through part-time work, family help, etc., his
repayment burden would increase a maximum of 5
percent under the administration's proposal.
In addition, the administration is proposingthatthe
GSL Auxiliary Loan program, Auxiliary Loans to Assist
Students (ALAS), take"up some of the burden of
graduate loans. This is a state-run program that will
provide loans at 14 percent interest, and repayment
must begin 60 days after the loan is taken out.
Arthur Marmaduke, director of the California
Student Aid Commission in Sacramento, said he
hopes the state program, CLAS, will be operational in
California this summer so students can take out loans
for this fall.
The problem is that only "seven very, very small
lenders have agreed to participate," he said. Many
more larger lenders are still needed, he said, to make
the program functional.
Asked if the CLAS program is an adequate
substitute for the GSL program Marmaduke said,
"Absolutely not." He said that while the interest
payments on the first $3OO borrowed may not be
unbearable, by a graduate student's third or fourth
year, his payment will be $250-300 per month. "It
seems to me that negates the whole purpose of the
program," he said.
Gerald Lieberman, vice provost and dean of
graduate studies and research, said GSLs are still up in
the air for next year. He also pointed out that the
ALAS program is not yet operating in California and
that it "ultimately amounts to increased debt that
graduate students accrue."
Lieberman said that this increased debt will force
students to place a higher consideration on the
salaries offered in their field, and will discourage
people from going into academic careers because
they don't pay relatively well.
For medical students, Lieberman said that incurring
large debt will force the hand of physicians"to go out
and make a quick buck."
A DED statement expressed the situation
differently: "For borrowers who can expect their
training to result in professional salaries, this added
burden can be handled." The statement did say, "In
some cases, graduate student debt could be increased
more than 60 percent if the in-school interest is
accrued to principal. . . Those who do not expect
their graduate training to yield sufficient income
should not undertake such loans."
Lieberman said that for next year, the National
Science Federation and National Institutes of Health
stipends for graduate students will be continued.
Karlene Dickey, director of graduate awards, pointed
out that most doctoral students in Humanities and
Sciences are admitted with fellowships and
assistanceships already in hand and therefore the loan
cuts will not severely affect them.
Dickey said the crunch will fall on masters students
who rely on loans, and she said that graduate students
borrowed $6 million last year. Dickey said, "We don't
expect any particular change in grants and fellowhips
for the coming year, but we just don't know what will
happen in Washington."
Lieberman said that while it is very hard to assess the
impact of the reduction in loans, it is possible that
students already admitted to Stanford for next year
may not show up because of indebtedness. "A larger
no-show rate wouldn't surprise me, especially in the
masters programs," he said.

times or 10,000 percent as much support for college
students as in 1960/' a DED statement said.
The administration is not only proposing future
cuts for FYB3 but rescissions in the FYB2 allocations as
well, so portions of many student aid programs are
still in jeopardy.
The proposed rescissions in FYB2 student aid
funding (for the 1982-83 academic year) include $9l
million from the Pell Grants; $44 million from Work-
Study; $6 million from SSIGs; $9.9 million from the
TRIO programs; $1.9 million from publicservice
fellowships; and $O.l million from law school
fellowships for minorities.
Probably the most discussed area of the proposed
FYB3 cuts is graduate exclusion from the GSL
program. The ACE contends that a majority of the
nation's graduate students, currently relying on GSLs,
may be unable to continue their education if the
administration's recommendations are adopted.
The Department of Education, on the other hand,
claims that if the student pays his interest as it accrues,

through part-time work, family help, etc., his
repayment burden would increase a maximum of 5
percent under the administration's proposal.
In addition, the administration is proposingthatthe
GSL Auxiliary Loan program, Auxiliary Loans to Assist
Students (ALAS), take"up some of the burden of
graduate loans. This is a state-run program that will
provide loans at 14 percent interest, and repayment
must begin 60 days after the loan is taken out.
Arthur Marmaduke, director of the California
Student Aid Commission in Sacramento, said he
hopes the state program, CLAS, will be operational in
California this summer so students can take out loans
for this fall.
The problem is that only "seven very, very small
lenders have agreed to participate," he said. Many
more larger lenders are still needed, he said, to make
the program functional.
Asked if the CLAS program is an adequate
substitute for the GSL program Marmaduke said,
"Absolutely not." He said that while the interest
payments on the first $3OO borrowed may not be
unbearable, by a graduate student's third or fourth
year, his payment will be $250-300 per month. "It
seems to me that negates the whole purpose of the
program," he said.
Gerald Lieberman, vice provost and dean of
graduate studies and research, said GSLs are still up in
the air for next year. He also pointed out that the
ALAS program is not yet operating in California and
that it "ultimately amounts to increased debt that
graduate students accrue."
Lieberman said that this increased debt will force
students to place a higher consideration on the
salaries offered in their field, and will discourage
people from going into academic careers because
they don't pay relatively well.
For medical students, Lieberman said that incurring
large debt will force the hand of physicians"to go out
and make a quick buck."
A DED statement expressed the situation
differently: "For borrowers who can expect their
training to result in professional salaries, this added
burden can be handled." The statement did say, "In
some cases, graduate student debt could be increased
more than 60 percent if the in-school interest is
accrued to principal. . . Those who do not expect
their graduate training to yield sufficient income
should not undertake such loans."
Lieberman said that for next year, the National
Science Federation and National Institutes of Health
stipends for graduate students will be continued.
Karlene Dickey, director of graduate awards, pointed
out that most doctoral students in Humanities and
Sciences are admitted with fellowships and
assistanceships already in hand and therefore the loan
cuts will not severely affect them.
Dickey said the crunch will fall on masters students
who rely on loans, and she said that graduate students
borrowed $6 million last year. Dickey said, "We don't
expect any particular change in grants and fellowhips
for the coming year, but we just don't know what will
happen in Washington."
Lieberman said that while it is very hard to assess the
impact of the reduction in loans, it is possible that
students already admitted to Stanford for next year
may not show up because of indebtedness. "A larger
no-show rate wouldn't surprise me, especially in the
masters programs," he said.
He also noted that "it's possible that if the loan
program is made less attractive, we may see a larger
proportion of foreign students doing graduate work
here." This year, he said, there was a higher increase
in foreign applications than in domesticapplications.
Most graduate students pay their own way and the
University's policy is to admit students based on
merit.

Michele Leiser, financial aid
assistant at the business school,
said that 72 percent of the
business students receive some
support through GSLs, which
totals $2 million. "If they (GSLs)
are cut it will have a substantial
effect on our students," she
said.
The Business School, Leiser
said, has committed itself to
covering the GSL loans for next
year through Business School
loans, which are normally a last
resort. However, she added,
"We can't promise to cover the
GSLs for more than one year."
The picture looks more

secure for Stanford
undergraduates, according to
Robert Huff, director of
financial aids, because the
University has decided it will
make up any grant funds cut by
the federal government, and
University President Donald
Kennedy vows that the
University will maintain its aid
blind admissions policy.
"The undergraduate student
who demonstrates financial
need is reasonably secure,"
Huff said, "because Stanford
has the meansand
commitment to assure that he
will be able to attend."
However Kennedy said, "I

can't tell you what will happen
after five years of economic
disaster, nobody can. All I can
tell you is that (aid-blind
admissions) is such a high
priority that it will beoneofthe
last things to go."
As to the state of both this
year's and next year's budget,
Huff said, "We don't expect
any further cuts. Those
amounts (proposed in the
rescissions) could be changed,
but I don'tthinkthey will be."
To help make upfor lost
grant money, Huff said the
University is looking to outside
sources and is especially trying
to attract private support,

which hesaidcould make upa
great part of the lost grant
money.
Huff admitted that more
problems exist at the graduate
level. "The prospects are good
for next year," he said, "but
beyond that I'm uncertain." He
said that this year graduate
students borrowed a total of
$l2 million, $8 million in GSLs
and $4 million in other loans.
"There is no question that
Stanford will find some source
to make up funds if the GSLs
are cut (to graduate students),"
Huff said, "but the question is
whether it will be acceptable."
He said that while the

University has a long history of
commitment to meeting the
financial needs of its
undergraduates, the situation
is more complicated for
graduate students. "What is the
appropriate number of
students in each field, how
many jobs will there be?" he
asked.
"Stanford has a strong
commitment to its gradute
students," Huff said, "but that
commitment is somewhat
decentralized. It reflects the
commitment of each school
and the labor market
situation."
So where does all this leave
students? Probably confused
and angry. Council of
Presidents (COP) member
Dragan Popov said that during
the COP's two-day letter
writing campaign in White
Plaza last month more than 100
students wrote letters to
congressmen and that similar
campaigns were held at the
Law, Business and Medical
schools.
However, Rep. Pete
McCloskey (R-Menlo Park)
told the Daily, "I haven't had a
word from anybody at Stanford
saying, 'Keep it.'"
As President Ronald Reagan pushes Congress
to accept his proposed cuts in federal student
financial aid, many university students
present and prospective wonder if they will be able
to afford to go to school next year.
While no one is able to predict the precise effect on
students of the proposed cuts, everyone seems to
agree that students at expensive institutions like
Stanford will suffer the most.
In terms of the potential effects of the cuts,
everyone has his own opinion. While the Department
of Education (DED) claims that under the new
allocations, no student would be barred from
attending school for lack of money, the American
Council on Education (ACE) believes that the cuts
would make college education impossible for
millions of students. University officials here seem to
be unsure as to what the outcome would be.
The Reagan administration's proposed education
cuts for the fiscal year (FY) 1983 budget are a product
of a new philosophysummarized by Gary Jones, DED
deputy undersecretary for planning: "Seemingly,
everyone believes that the first commitment (to
education) has been the responsibility of the federal
government. . . We're simply suggesting that families
should share a larger burden of the cost of their
children attending colleges and universities."
Jones pointed out that between 1978 and 1981,
while family income increased 30 percent,
contributions to higher education actually decreased
6 percent.
Opponents of both the philosophy and the
proposals, such as Charles Saunders, vice president

for governmental relations for the ACE, believe: "The
(Reagan) administration is moving toward outright
rejection of federal responsibility for access to higher
educaton, a tenet that has united Republicans and
Democrats since the Eisenhower administration."
President Dwight Eisenhower, concerned with
national defense, initiated the National Defense
Education Act which stated, "The Congress hereby
finds and declares that the security of the Nation
requires the fullest development of the mental
resurces and technical skills of its young men and
women." Access to education then was viewed as a
form of insurance for national security, not
necessarily a social good.
President Lyndon Johnson reaffirmed the
commitment by the Higher Education Act of 1965,
saying, "I propose that we declare a national goal of
full educational opportunity .. .We want this not
only for (the student's) sake but for the nation's
sake."
His successor, Richard Nixon, expanded the
commitment and the resulting Education
Amendment of 1972 established Basic Educational

Opportunity (Pell) Grants as a national program.
Nixon said, "No qualified student who wants to go to
college should be barred by lack of money."
Signing an education amendment in 1980,
President Jimmy Carter said, "Through the Middle
Income Student Assistance Act (passed in 1978) we've
brought college within the reach of every student in
this nation who's qualified for higher education. The
idea that lack of money should be no barrier to a
college education is no longer a dream, it's a reality
n
Current Secretary of Education Terrel Bell says
thatthe Reagan administration isstill
committed "to provide access to higher
education for the truly needy," but describes the
present program as "way out of hand" and claims that
"windingdown inflation . . . is perhaps the single
most important thing we can do."
David Stockman, director of the Office of
Management and Budget, told the House Budget
Committee in October, "I do not accept tbe notion
that the federal government has an obligation to fund
generous grants to anybody that wants to go to
college. It seems to me that if people want to go to
college bad enough, then there is opportunity and
responsibility on their part to finance their way
through the bestthey can."
DED points out that in 1960 the federal
government's commitment to needy college students
consisted of $4O million in Direct Student Loans. In
1966 the appropriation for grants and loans was $346.4
million, and in 1973 the total was $1.2 billion. "This

administration is proposing an appropriation of $4.3
billion for these same programs in 1983 over 100
times or 10,000 percent as much support for college
students as in 1960/' a DED statement said.
