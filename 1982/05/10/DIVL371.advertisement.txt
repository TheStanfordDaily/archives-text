CUBBIES BEAT THE ODDS
It had been twelve months since the Cubs pulled through and won
a game when this year's crop of Daily rookie staffers took up bats to
beat off veteran player-editors and manned the field at the Daily
offices last night. Despite curves of unordered Dominoes pizzas,
telephone heckling by vets, sabotaged pitching signals-computer
commands, and a field brawl between teams in the now-totaled
spo and ops offices, the cubbies managed to turn the game around
in the ninth inning and get the paper off to the printer before sun- -
rise ... better than the vet-geriatrics could have done in their
drunken state. Three cheers!
