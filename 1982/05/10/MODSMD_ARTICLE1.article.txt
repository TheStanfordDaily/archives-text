# Woman assaulted
## 
### 
A woman was attacked near the in
tersection of Bowdoin Street and
Campus Drive at 12:30 a.m. last Friday
morning, but she escaped when the
attacker lost his grip on her as she fell
off her bike.
The victim's description of her at
tacker is very similar to the descrip
tion of a man who attacked another
Stanford student exactly one week
before near Kresge Auditorium. Both
women described their assailants as a
black male in his mid-20s, 5"I1,
160-170 lbs., medium build. The latest
victim said her attacker had his hair
styled in corn row braids.
The woman was riding her bike Fri
day night when a man hiding in the
bushes near the Wilbur parking lot
grabbed her hair and pulled her off
her bike. The attacker lost his grip on
the woman as she fell, thus giving her
the opportunity to run. She told po
lice that the assailant ran in the op
posite direction.
After retrieving her bike, the wom
an went back to the dorm she was vis
iting and called the police.
The only significant difference be
tween the two recent victims' de
scriptions of their attackers was the
hair style, according to Herrington.
He said the assailant could have
changed his hair style, or the at
tackers could have been different in
dividuals.
