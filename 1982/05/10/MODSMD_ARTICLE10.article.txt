## Acknowledging death at Stanford 
### 
A single death jolts us, and a suicide even more so.
All of a sudden we wonder about the reasons anyone
would take his or her own life, and then we grasp onto
the reassurances of meaning and direction in our own
lives. We wonder where the fault lies.
If you don't live in the dorm where Chris Johnson
lived, you may not be emotionally jolted. No contact —
no concern. British sailors dying in Argentine waters are
too far away and faceless to affect us. Students killed in
Poland or in Lebanon seem equally distant. It has been 10
years since the senseless deaths at Kent State in Ohio
wrought our collective anger and sorrow. Chris Johnson
was a student living here, at Stanford.
Stanford is a socially active and aware community.
People participate, share, and go out of their way for
each other. Stanford is also a lonely place. The responsi
bility to achieve can isolate us from others. Competition
and time contraints distance us from one another and
even from a part of ourselves.
Too often, these academic pressures are coped with as
if they were distinct from emotional stress and social ex
pectations. Legitimacy must be given to the part of
ourselves that enjoys life's intangibles. The part that
gazes through dense pines at the mountains and sky; the
part that exchanges smiles with the people packed onto
city sidewalks during sunny lunch hours; or even just the
part that shares a little kid's excitement when a kitten's
eyes finally open up. There is no quantative measure for
these acts of the heart.
The emotional facet of a Stanford student is equally, if
not fundamentally more important to develop than the

academic. It is hard to justify the notion that intelligent
people are able to cope emotionally — to rationally sort
out the unquantifiable. The need for counseling can
often go beyond a close friend's emotional capabilities.
Stanford acknowledges the students' stress-related
needs by carefully selecting Resident Assistants. Cowell's
Houston House and the student-run Bridge counseling
center are two additional places where people listen and
help.
It doesn't matter if you're a hard-core pre-med
sophomore, a poli-sci junior who has returned from
Cliveden with a new flame or a confused fresh ma njrjev
eryone can get ripped up inside. In a crisis situation it
takes sensitivity and courage to know when and how to
direct a friend to more formal help. It takes guts to take
that responsibility of directing another person's life.
Sometimes it won't work — and that hurts. v
When a person at Stanford takes his or her own life it
hurts. We wonder why — we wonder where we could
have acted differently as friends, RAs and teachers. It
takes an unexpected jolt making that spot between your
heart and your stomach tighten into a knot to know that
something will never be the same.
It is foolish to try to internalize every human tragedy.
Indeed, the volume of televised world suffering only
anaesthetizes our capability for compassion But if Chris
Johnson becomes just another faceless tragedy we are
too hastily ignoring the individual need for emotional in
ventory — even at Stanford.
