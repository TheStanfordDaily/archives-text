## Communism viewed objectively 
### 
Most Americans learn to hate com
munism long before they have any
idea of what it really is. This is un
fortunate. With the the world situ
ation as it now stands, it is important
for the American people to put away
their prejudicial paranoia so that they
can look objectively upon com
munism and try to understand it. If
they were to do so, they would dis
cover that communism calls for noth
ing more than a centralized economy
under the control of the proletariat, a
classless society based in economic
equality and an abolition of op
presive capitalistic notions of religion
and God. In short, such an examina
tion of communism would replace
paranoia with legitimate fear.
While it is often held that com
munism is too ideal, this is clearly not
the case. Not only is communism im
practical, it is inherently a bad idea.
The thought of centralized economic
and political power under the "dic
tatorship of the proletariat" is far
from Utopian; it is chilling. Marx
somehow neglected to tell us exactly
what this dictatorship would be but if
it is true that absolute power corrupts
absolu r ely (as it seems to), then who
could possibly favor the consolida
tion of power which communism im
plies?
Although capitalism is certainly
not perfect, under the proper regu
lation, it is in the end preferable to
communism. Capitalism provides
those products for which there is a
demand. In other words, each indi
vidual, through his spending pat
terns, plays a role in deciding what
will be produced and how scarce re
sources will be allocated. In Marx's
time, the problem of economic ine
quality was extremely severe and la
borers were commonly exploited.
Presently, in developed capitalist
countries, economic inequality is still
a problem but the power of industry
is offset by unionization and govern

ment regualtion. Graduated income
tax, proposed by Marx, has long been
instituted.
Communism, on the other hand,,
has no mechanism which reacts to
the demands of consumers. Certain
individuals decide what shall be pro
duced and who shall benefit from
production. The notion of equality is
forgotten. In order to make the sys
tem work, every experiment in com
munism has ended with the in
troduction of incentive mechanisms.
In China, for example, a s
nician earns about seven times more
than an un-skilled laborer. Still more
disturbing is the control exercised by
communism over the individual.
With capitalism, individual needs
and desires determine what will be
produced. Under communism, indi
vidual needs and desires are de
termined by the state.
Not only does the "dictatorship of
the proletariat" decide what kind of
education you will receive, it decides
where you'll live and work, what
you'll eat and even what color of
tooth brush you'll be able to get. This
is the only equality one can hope for
under communism. In the case of tru
ly competitive, regulat d capitalism,
power is divided among conflicting
interests insuring greater freedom
for all. Capitalist nations impose no
emigration limitations on their own
citizens. Only communist countries
have had to resort to this.
Of course, many claim that it is un
fair to use specific examples of com
munist countries, when criticizing
Marxist theory. They hold that none
of these countries are truly com
munist and that communism has yet
to be proven in the world. Nothing
could be further from the truth. Op
presive dictatorial regimes like the
Soviet Union are in fact exactly what
one would expect to result from the
implementation of communist theo
ry Marx believed that while power

might be initially centralized it
would eventually De localized and
the necessity for government would
disappear. This has proven to be an
incorrect assumption. The nature of
power is to seek more power and this
is exactly what has occurred.
The only thing even closely re
sembling the "dictatorship of the
proletariat" envisioned by Marx is
the "dictatorship of the bureau
cracy" which seems to have taken
over this role. Capitalist countries
also experience problems with bu
reaucracy, but there is an essential
difference: with capitalist govern
ments, the elected power elite holds
bureaucracy in check. With com
uununism, the bureaucracy pro
duces the power elite. As the bureau
cracy grows, it comes to dominate
virtually every aspect of life within
the country. The process is actually
the reverse of what Marx theorized;
economic and political power is cen
tralized rather than decentralized.
This centralization of control, in
fact, surpasses the economic and po
litical realms. The state eventually de
mands everything from the individ
ual. The communist state replaces re
ligion with devotion to production
and strives to eliminate
notions of God and morality which it
perceives as threats. The only time
communism has been able to accept
religious beliefs is out of political ne
cessity as in Poland.
"A spector is haunting our worldâ€”
the spector of communism." Those
of us who have seen what is done in
its name must not stand idly by, en
couraging its acceptance. In an at
tempt to be "open" to new ideas,
many college students look too kind
ly upon this spector. If they would
only open their eyes a little further,
they would see that commi'nism is
not merely an alternate lifestyle; it is
a fearful alternative.

its name must not stand idly by, en
couraging its acceptance. In an at
tempt to be "open" to new ideas,
many college students look too kind
ly upon this spector. If they would
only open their eyes a little further,
they would see that commi'nism is
not merely an alternate lifestyle; it is
a fearful alternative.

Most Americans learn to hate com
munism long before they have any
idea of what it really is. This is un
fortunate. With the the world situ
ation as it now stands, it is important
for the American people to put away
their prejudicial paranoia so that they
can look objectively upon com
munism and try to understand it. If
they were to do so, they would dis
cover that communism calls for noth
ing more than a centralized economy
under the control of the proletariat, a
classless society based in economic
equality and an abolition of op
presive capitalistic notions of religion
and God. In short, such an examina
tion of communism would replace
paranoia with legitimate fear.
While it is often held that com
munism is too ideal, this is clearly not
the case. Not only is communism im
practical, it is inherently a bad idea.
The thought of centralized economic
and political power under the "dic
tatorship of the proletariat" is far
from Utopian; it is chilling. Marx
somehow neglected to tell us exactly
what this dictatorship would be but if
it is true that absolute power corrupts
absolu r ely (as it seems to), then who
could possibly favor the consolida
tion of power which communism im
plies?
Although capitalism is certainly
not perfect, under the proper regu
lation, it is in the end preferable to
communism. Capitalism provides
those products for which there is a
demand. In other words, each indi
vidual, through his spending pat
terns, plays a role in deciding what
will be produced and how scarce re
sources will be allocated. In Marx's
time, the problem of economic ine
quality was extremely severe and la
borers were commonly exploited.
Presently, in developed capitalist
countries, economic inequality is still
a problem but the power of industry
is offset by unionization and govern

ment regualtion. Graduated income
tax, proposed by Marx, has long been
instituted.
Communism, on the other hand,,
has no mechanism which reacts to
the demands of consumers. Certain
individuals decide what shall be pro
duced and who shall benefit from
production. The notion of equality is
forgotten. In order to make the sys
tem work, every experiment in com
munism has ended with the in
troduction of incentive mechanisms.
In China, for example, a s
nician earns about seven times more
than an un-skilled laborer. Still more
disturbing is the control exercised by
communism over the individual.
With capitalism, individual needs
and desires determine what will be
produced. Under communism, indi
vidual needs and desires are de
termined by the state.
Not only does the "dictatorship of
the proletariat" decide what kind of
education you will receive, it decides
where you'll live and work, what
you'll eat and even what color of
tooth brush you'll be able to get. This
is the only equality one can hope for
under communism. In the case of tru
ly competitive, regulat d capitalism,
power is divided among conflicting
interests insuring greater freedom
for all. Capitalist nations impose no
emigration limitations on their own
citizens. Only communist countries
have had to resort to this.
Of course, many claim that it is un
fair to use specific examples of com
munist countries, when criticizing
Marxist theory. They hold that none
of these countries are truly com
munist and that communism has yet
to be proven in the world. Nothing
could be further from the truth. Op
presive dictatorial regimes like the
Soviet Union are in fact exactly what
one would expect to result from the
implementation of communist theo
ry Marx believed that while power

might be initially centralized it
would eventually De localized and
the necessity for government would
disappear. This has proven to be an
incorrect assumption. The nature of
power is to seek more power and this
is exactly what has occurred.
The only thing even closely re
sembling the "dictatorship of the
proletariat" envisioned by Marx is
the "dictatorship of the bureau
cracy" which seems to have taken
over this role. Capitalist countries
also experience problems with bu
reaucracy, but there is an essential
difference: with capitalist govern
ments, the elected power elite holds
bureaucracy in check. With com
uununism, the bureaucracy pro
duces the power elite. As the bureau
cracy grows, it comes to dominate
virtually every aspect of life within
the country. The process is actually
the reverse of what Marx theorized;
economic and political power is cen
tralized rather than decentralized.
This centralization of control, in
fact, surpasses the economic and po
litical realms. The state eventually de
mands everything from the individ
ual. The communist state replaces re
ligion with devotion to production
and strives to eliminate
notions of God and morality which it
perceives as threats. The only time
communism has been able to accept
religious beliefs is out of political ne
cessity as in Poland.
