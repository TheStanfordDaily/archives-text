# Appreciating life at Stanford
## 
### 
Since my birthday is this week, I've
decided to give myself the present of
writing a column that requires little
thought and even less researching of
facts. In short, the following is purely
a collection of my opinions.
I like the humanities. I like them
because they are for everyone. Now
don't get me wrong, I agree with that
great literary figure Lazarus Long
who once said, "People who do not
understand mathematics are only
sub-human," but math is not some
thing you study for enjoyment. I find
the humanities enjoyable, for you
don't have to specialize in them to
get something out of them. History,
philosophy and English literature
have not fallen victim to the jargon
that has rendered any conversation
in the pure and social sciences totally

I wouldn't change my
mechanical
engineering major
for any on campus
but you can't tell me
engineers and MB As
are the only people
who currently have
something to offer...

unintelligible to an outsider. Conse
quently, you don't have to be a liter
ary scholar to appreciate
Shakespeare, and you don't have to
take 38 cumulative prerequistes in
order to understand an upper level
American History course.
I wouldn't change my mechanical
engineering major for any on cam
pus, but you can't tell me engineers
and MBAs are the only people who
currently have something to offer to
this nation's economy. Someone
who has done well in the humanities
has no doubt acquired the skills of
critical thinking and clear writing,
and knows a little about human na
ture, too — three attributes all too
rare in today's work-force and assets
which will not become obsolete due

to technical advancements. If the Na
tional Endowment for the Human
ities really wanted to help its benefi
ciary it would commission a study to
determine which leaders in America
received a liberal arts education. I
may be wrong but I bet the results
would surprise a lot of people who
think majoring in art history is a waste
of time.
•••
One thing I do like on campus is
the care and feeding of the land
scape. Stanford no cjoubt spends a lot
of money on groundskeeping, and it
shows. This campus is clean, man
icured and full of natural color. I
don't think the people who are re
sponsible get enough credit. Maybe
we should have a grounds crew ap
preciation day, or at least give them a
smile.
Another thing I appreciate about
Stanford is the varsity athletic pro
gram. Without a doubt, this univer
sity comes closer than any other in
meeting the ideal of the student ath
lete. 85 percent of Stanford's athletes
goon to graduate school, and yet our
teams compete favorably with pro
fessional athletes from the likes of
USC, UCLA, and ASU. Yes, I know
our football team had a losing season
last year, but at least it is eligible to
compete for a Rose Bowl bid this
year; Trojan fans will have to be con
tent knowing their ticket dollars are
paying for the gas in their heroes'
Trans Ams.
•••
To round off this essay I'd like to
talk about the two things every col
lege male gripes about —the food
service and the coeds. I too have my
ideas of how to improve the food ser
vice at Stanford, a service which
seems to be a little expensive. I pro
pose running the Food Service on a
credit card system in which everyone
on the plan pays in a certain amount
of money at the beginning of the
quarter and then presents their per
sonalized Stanford Food Service
credit card everytime they want to
eat. Students would only be charged
for the meals they eat, and the cards
would be accepted at all food loca
tions on campus (even Union
Crossroads and the Coffee House if
everyone is game for a little competi
tion). The beauty of this plan is you
no longer are penalized for skipping
lunch if you only want a hamburger
at Tressider or if you spend the day at

the beach. And if you don't like
what's being served some night you
can hop in your car and head for Taco
Bell. Any credit you don't use during
the quarter can be refunded the next
quarter.
An unworkable pipe dream you
say, well that's what I thought last
year when Washington University
became the first college in the coun
try to switch to a credit card system.
By the end of the year, when I had
spent only $800 on food for nine
months, I was a believer. Now I know
food is cheaper in St. Louis than it is
out here, but I had spent $300 more
in the previous year — that's a 27 per
cent savings. If the so-called BET'M

slate really wants to decrease the cost
of Stanford's food service they will
look into the credit card system.
Don't leave Stanford without it.
•••
As far as I know there are only two
colleges in the country where the
guys don't complain about the lack
of beautiful women, and both those
schools are in Los Angeles. I for one
am tired of hearing guys criticize the
women here. You've probably all
heard the one that starts, "Nine out
of ten women in California are beau
tiful, ..Now I'm going to general
ize here and probably upset a lot of
feminists, but I see the women of
Stanford as being intelligent,
progressive, athletic, career-minded,
and, yes, physically attractive. Un
fortunately for us guys they are quite
career-minded. Now don't get me
wrong, that's the way it should be.
My personal priorities are sleeping,
eating, studying and social life, in that
order. It's just kind of hard on the ego
to get turned down in favor of a Hum
Bio exam, and that, not a prolifera
tion of homeliness, is the real reason
why you hear punchlines like, ..

One thing I do like on campus is
the care and feeding of the land
scape. Stanford no cjoubt spends a lot
of money on groundskeeping, and it
shows. This campus is clean, man
icured and full of natural color. I
don't think the people who are re
sponsible get enough credit. Maybe
we should have a grounds crew ap
preciation day, or at least give them a
smile.
Another thing I appreciate about
Stanford is the varsity athletic pro
gram. Without a doubt, this univer
sity comes closer than any other in
meeting the ideal of the student ath
lete. 85 percent of Stanford's athletes
goon to graduate school, and yet our
teams compete favorably with pro
fessional athletes from the likes of
USC, UCLA, and ASU. Yes, I know
our football team had a losing season
last year, but at least it is eligible to
compete for a Rose Bowl bid this
year; Trojan fans will have to be con
tent knowing their ticket dollars are
paying for the gas in their heroes'
Trans Ams.
•••
To round off this essay I'd like to
talk about the two things every col
lege male gripes about —the food
service and the coeds. I too have my
ideas of how to improve the food ser
vice at Stanford, a service which
seems to be a little expensive. I pro
pose running the Food Service on a
credit card system in which everyone
on the plan pays in a certain amount
of money at the beginning of the
quarter and then presents their per
sonalized Stanford Food Service
credit card everytime they want to
eat. Students would only be charged
for the meals they eat, and the cards
would be accepted at all food loca
tions on campus (even Union
Crossroads and the Coffee House if
everyone is game for a little competi
tion). The beauty of this plan is you
no longer are penalized for skipping
lunch if you only want a hamburger
at Tressider or if you spend the day at

the beach. And if you don't like
what's being served some night you
can hop in your car and head for Taco
Bell. Any credit you don't use during
the quarter can be refunded the next
quarter.
An unworkable pipe dream you
say, well that's what I thought last
year when Washington University
became the first college in the coun
try to switch to a credit card system.
By the end of the year, when I had
spent only $800 on food for nine
months, I was a believer. Now I know
food is cheaper in St. Louis than it is
out here, but I had spent $300 more
in the previous year — that's a 27 per
cent savings. If the so-called BET'M

of Stanford's food service they will

Don't leave Stanford without it.

As far as I know there are only two
colleges in the country where the

Since my birthday is this week, I've
decided to give myself the present of
writing a column that requires little
thought and even less researching of
facts. In short, the following is purely
a collection of my opinions.
I like the humanities. I like them
because they are for everyone. Now
don't get me wrong, I agree with that
great literary figure Lazarus Long

understand mathematics are only
sub-human," but math is not some
thing you study for enjoyment. I find
