## 
### Dan Labov 
Job seekers: it's 11:59, but all
is not lost. The Student Em
ployment Office (SEO) of the
Career Planning and Place
ment Center offers assistance
to those still in search of sum
mer employment.
When asked point-blank
whether it is too late to find a
job, Mary Wolf, one of the
three SEO counselors con
cedes, "Students are at much
more of a disadvantage at this
time. It's tricky now ... I think
the job market is getting
tougher. Summer jobs are the
first ones looked at for budget
cutbacks."
But Wolf added, "We still
strongly urge (jobless students)
to come in. I'm hoping if we
can get them in here, we can
get Wiem on the right road."
Hector Cuevas, SEO direc
tor, maintains that jobless stu
dents need not give up hope,

yet he points out, "The expec
tations level (should) be re
alistic."
The realization that the
deadline for the perfect job has
past, or that all the internships

"We will strongly urge (jobless
students) to come in. I'm hoping if we
can get them in here, ive can get them
on the right road/'

spots have been filled, often
frustrates job-seekers now util
izing the SEO. One need only
be in the SEO for several
minutes to hear the lament,
"Ohhhh, I should have come
here earlier!"
Students react positively to
the SEO's assistance. Freshman
Paul Toback was surprised that
the SEO had so many op

portunities and connections in
his home town of Chicago on
file. Toback said he was also im
pressed that when he "just
wandered in to have a look
around" the staff was attentive
and helpful.

"Next year I'll be back (at the
SEO) in November," said
Toback. "They're so willing to
help..."
At this late date, the SEO is at
its busiest. "It doesn't taper off
like it used to," said Cuevas.
"Even in June it's crowded
here."
According to Cuevas and
Wolf, the student's best chance

for a job may be in technical
fields because there are more
technical job openings. Yet
Wolf said students in liberal
arts fields should not dispair.
"It's now the creative go-get
ter who has the best chance,"
she said. In order to find a job
now, Wolf said, "people need
to think creatively, be flexible,
and be open to many different
types of things." •
The SEO does its best to let
the students know about the
various services they offer, say
Cuevas and Wolf. There will be
a workshop on May 11th in
Tresidder Union for students
still without a summer job. A
20-minute video tape about all
the center's services entitled
"Did you ever have to make up
your mind?" will be shown in
student residences.
"We're always looking for
ways to get more exposure,"
said Cuevas.
