# Icky's: where tackiness lives on
## 
### Kathy Olmsted 
It was 9:00 Tuesday night
and George had finished his
Physics lab early. He cruised
the halls of Soto, seeking fel
low starving students. A
small crowd gathered be
hind him as the dorm re
alized an event was in the
making, finally assembled,
the group charged to the
parking lot with one
thought, on their minds:
"Icky's run!"
Icky's, to the uninitiated,
is the definitive northeast
Wilbur gastronomic cult.
Literally dozens of Rin
conada and Soto denizens

make regular trips to the a
small donut shop in Palo
Alto affectionately known
as "Icky D's" (for icky
donuts).
It is precisely the medi
ocrity of the donuts, the
esthetic of tackiness about
the atmosphere, and the,
well, overall ickiness of
Icky's that has enabled this
tiny cafe to acquire such a
cultish following.
The constant remodelling
of the establishment neces
sitates a welter of two-by
fours, sawdust and buzz
saws which combine to pro
duce an ambience ir

resistable to Stanford stu
dents seeking the bizarre
and the deviant.
The customers, who look
as if they slept at the bus sta
tion, and the usually bellig
erent help only serve to
augment the attraction.
On one Icky's run, the
waitress toid students
forced to pantomine over
the roaring of a power saw
to quiet down. On another
occasion, smoke from an
epic grease fire forced the
delighted would-be cus
tomers to drop to the res
taurant floor in order to
breathe fresh air.

Tales like this only serve
to exponentially increase
the number of Icky's devo
tees. Pictures of infamous
Icky's runs dominate the
Rinconada lounge; signs
advertising seminars on the
history of Icky's ("a tour of
Ancient Grease") decorate
the Soto entryway.
Of course, Icky's patrons
love to hate the coveted
donuts, calling them
"glazed cat abortions,"
"maple adidases," and con
jecturing on the possible
utility of donut holes as golf
balls. But the fans keep re
turning.
