# The 						Farm goes Hawaiian

While most people have
neither the time northe money
to experience the pleasures of
the Hawaii, many students got
a little "taste of aloha" at the
two luaus held last weekend.
Balmy sunshine brought a
touch of the magical islands to
Chuck Taylor Grove on Friday
afternoon where more than
200 freshmen gathered for the
second annual frosh luau or
ganized by the Stanford Alum
ni Network (STAN). Each dorm
sponsored a table spread with
fresh tropical fruit and con
cocted a drink to be entered in
the "best drink contest,"
judged by Fred Hargadon,
dean of admissions. After
sampling all of the drinks sev
eral times, Hargadon declared
Wilbur's mai-tais the best
drink.
Margot Nelson of STAN said
the luau theme was decided
upon last year by a committee
of freshmen. Sophomore
Cricket Barlow, a member of
last year's frosh committee,
said, "It was the biggest, most
exciting thing we could think
of I"
Nelson added a luau was also
something which would get all
of the dorms involved. STAN

sponsored the frosh luau in or
der to promote freshman class
unity, Nelson said. In the past,
STAN has sponsored the frosh
ice-cream study break, and
most recently the junior Great
Gatsby night.
"Once you graduate, the
biggest class event you have is a
reunion," Nelson said. "If you
don't know people in your
class, it's just not fun."
The sun also shined Satur
day, though gusty winds re
minded the 300 or so people at
the Hawaii Club luau that they
were still in California. The
luau was held on the Cowell
cluster lawn and included
authentic Hawaiian food along
with hours of entertainment.
The food included such Ha
waiian delicacies as Khalua pig,
poi, and chicken long rice.
Hicela Castruvita, one of the
three luau chairpersons, said
that everything for the dinner,
except the vegetables and
punch, was flown in from Ha
waii by Western Airlines.
Castruivita added that many of
the supplies had been
donated, such as the flowers
and pineapples, by parents and
companies like Dole and Del
Monte.
Traditional hula dancing girls

pet-formed to music performed
by a band composed of Hawaii
Club members. They per
formed numbers ranging from
ancient Hawaiian chants to
jazzy modern songs such as
"Royal Hawaiian Hotel,"
played on the islands today.
The program also included a
lesson in talking "pigeon," a
Hawaiian slang which is a syn
thesis of Hawaiian, English,
Chinese, Japanese, and other
languages.
Publicity Chairman Jeff Au
said that the 75 to 100 members
of the Hawaii Club had been
working for two months on the
ninth annual luau. This year's
luau, with the theme "A Taste
of Aloha," concentrated on the
cultural aspects of Hawaii and
the surrounding islands
through ancient to modern
times.
Au, who was involved in
both luaus, gave his personal
interpretation of what the
theme meant to him: "It's the
human feeling that you get
from the Hawaiian people, that
extra touch of kindness that
goes beyond the call of duty."
Au, who is from the islands,
said "these last two days have
almost been like going back
home again."
