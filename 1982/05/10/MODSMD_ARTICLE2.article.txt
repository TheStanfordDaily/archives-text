Reagan proposes arms reduction
Eureka, III. — President Ronald Reagan, calling for "dismantling of
the nuclear menace," yesterday proposed one-third reductions in the
strategic missile arsenals of both the United States and the Soviet Union.
Speaking at the commencement ceremony of Eureka College, from
which he graduated 50 years ago, Reagan unveiled a two-phase plan of
nuclear arms reductions and urged the Soviets to join in discussions on
them by the end of June.
"I believe that the West can fashion a realistic, durable policy that will
protect our interests and keep the peace, not just for this generation,
but for your children and grandchildren," Reagan said to a burst of ap
plause.
The first phase of the president's proposal would reduce ballistic mis
sile warheads to "equal ceilings at least a third below current levels,"
with no more than half of these missiles based on land. This would cut
the roughly equivalent level of warheads on both sides from 7,500 to
5,000.
A prime goal is reduction of "the most destablizing nuclear systems,"
a reference to the powerful and accurate Soviet SS-18 and SS-19 missiles.
A second phase, on which the president provided no details, looks to
an equal ceiling on all strategic nuclear forces, with the apparent but
unspecified goals of preventing either superpower from launching a
successful first nuclear strike against the other.
In Moscow, in an apparent attempt to take the edge off Reagan's arms
control initiative, Defense Minister Dmitri Ustinov said in sharply
worded article in Pravda that "The Soviet Union will not allow the exist
ing balance of forces to be disrupted."
In his speech, Reagan said he was willing to negotiate in good faith on
Soviet counter-proposals. A senior administration official said yesterday
that he expects the Russians to counter with some proposal to reduce
the number of bombers, in which the United States nas a definite edge.
The official said the United States is prepared to negotiate on this issue.
Reagan also hinted that he was willing to accept Soviet President
Leonid Brezhnev's proposal for a fall summit meeting.
"I have already expressed my own desire to meet
with President Brezhnev in New York next month,"
Reagan said. "If this cannot be done I would hope we
could arrange a future meeting where positive results
can be anticipated. And when we sit down, I will tell
President Brezhnev that the United States is ready to
build a new understanding based upon the principles
I have outlined today."
Britain ends Falklands lull
Buenos Aires, Argentina — Britain ended a lull in
the South Atlantic yesterday, striking the Falkland Is
lands by air and sea, attacking a fishing vessel it said
was spying on the British fleet and reportedly shoot
ing down an Argentine transport helicopter.
Argentina said that British Harriers sank the fishing
vessel Narval and then machine gunned survivors in
its lifeboats.
In London, a Defense Ministry spokesman de
scribed as "ludicrous" the charge that Britain strafed
the lifeboats. He said the crew of the Argentine vessel
had been taken prisoner with no casualties and was
aboard a British ship. The Narval, he said, was afloat
and in British custody.
Britain returned to the offensive in the Falklands
war yesterday, slipping in close to East Falkland under
cover of darkness and shellng military targets near the
islands' capital of Stanley and the small port of
Darwin. A helicopter flying over the Falklands was
also shot down in the attack. It was not immediately
clear whether the helicopter was carrying Argentine
troops at the time or was instead flying a supply mis
sion.
The aim of the attack, the British reporters said, was
to further enforce the blockade of the islands. The last
two days, they said, Harriers had intercepted and
turned back Argentine C-130 Hercules transports
trying to reach the Falklands, and it was feared that
some supplies were reaching the Argentine garrison.
A C-130 is capable of operating on a short grass air
strip and, thus, could have circumvented British ef
forts to knock out the only paved runway, at Stanley.
It was the first war action since Tuesday, when Ar
gentina wrecked the British destroyer Sheffield with a
missile attack from the air.
Britain said that it had no reports of British casual
ties in yesterday's action and that all aircraft had re
turned safely to the fleet.
Israeli warplanes bomb Lebanon
Jerusalem — Israeli warplanes bombed and strafed
Palestinian guerrilla positions along the coast of Leba
non yesterday and Palestinian gunners retaliated by
shelling the Galilee region of northern Israel in the
most serious breakdown yet of the fragile, 10-month
cease-fire between the two sides.
Lebanese officials said at least 16 people were killed
and 56 wounded in the raids, which the Israeli Army
Command said Israel's Cabinet ordered against three
Mediterranean coastal bases "after terrorist organiza
tions during the past days repeatedly and severely vio
lated the ceasefire arrangement."
Less than an hour after the air strikes, Soviet-made
Katuysha rockets presumed to have been fired from
Palestinian positions in Nabatiyeh, southern Leba
non, fell in Galilee. Israeli television reported yester
day night that at least 150 shells were reported by resi
dents of the northern border area.
It was the first direct exchange of cross-border fire
between Israel and the Palestine Liberation Organiza
tion since the two sides, through the mediation of
U.S. special envoy Philip Habib and the U.N. peace
keeping force, agreed to a cease-fire July 24 following
the "mini" war of attrition last summer.
An Israeli Army Command spokesman said Israeli
jets bombed an arms depot and bunkers at Mazrat
Vista, three miles south of Zaharani, where the
Zaharani River flows into the Mediterranean; a train
ing base of Fatah, the main military arm of the PLO, in
Dahar Aklun, three miles south of Damour, and two
100-mm artillery guns positioned near Sidon.
The Army Command said that Palestinian anti-air

craft guns along the coast opened fire on the attack
ing Israeli planes and were bombed also.
Israel threatens end to peace talks
Jerusalem — The Israeli Cabinet threatened to scut
tle the Palestinian autonomy talks yesterday unless
Egypt agreed to hold at least one-third of the nego
tiation sessions in Jerusalem.
Meeting a few hours before the arrival of U.S.
Middle East negotiator Richard Fairbanks, the Cabi
net adopted a resolution declaring it was incon
ceivable that Israel would agree to talks that bypassed
Jerusalem.
Fairbanks plans to confer today with Israel's chief
autonomy negotiator, Interior Minister Yosef Burg,
on arrangements for restarting the stalled nego
tiations over limited self-rule for the 1.2 million Arabs
living in the occupied West Bank of the Jordan River
and the Gaza Strip. Fairbanks planned to go to Cairo
following his talks in Jerusalem.
Egypt so far has refused to participate in autonomy
negotiations in Jerusalem because the Egyptians con
tend that one issue in the talks is the future of pre
dominantly Arab East Jerusalem, which Israel cap
tured from Jordan in the Six Day War of 1967 and sub
sequently annexed. Israel maintains that it will never
again permit the partition of Jerusalem and will not
even consider permittting Arab residents of East Jeru
salem to take part in the proposed autonomy plan.
Israel's insistence on holding meetings in Jerusalem
is a new obstacle in the way of drafting rules to govern
the "whole autonomy," which the 1978 Camp David
accords proposed for the West Bank and Gaza Arabs.
Even before the new issue was raised, the talks had
reached a point of almost total deadlock.
"Questions of procedure must not stand in the way
of the autonomy talks," Fairbanks said in an arrival
statement yesterday. "Now we need imagination and
initiative to make progress in the autonomy."
Graham preaches for disarma
ment
Moscow — Evangelist Billy Graham preached a
message for disarmament in Moscow's Baptist church
yesterday as a hymn-singing overflow congregation
held an extraordinary service behind police bar
ricades on the street outside.
In his sermon the Rev. Graham reminded the con
gregation that while their first commitment must be
to Jesus Christ they must also remember that the bible
calls on them to "obey the authorities."
Speaking on the anniversary of one of the main So
viet public holidays — the victory day over Nazi Ger
many — he sought to use the memory of U.S.-Russian
wartime friendship for a new joint disarmament ef
fort.
"At that time the United States and the Soviet
Union were allies against Nazi Germany," he said.
"Now we have another common enemy — the possi
bility of a nuclear holocaust."
At the end of his sermon, a young woman unfurled
a banner from the balcony pews reading, in English,
"We have more than 150 prisoners for the work of the
gospel." The banner apparently referred to Baptists
who have been imprisoned for preaching and hold
ing services without permission.
At the same time, another banner, also in English,
was raised in the aisles directly in front of Granam,
saying "Deliver those who are driven away to death."
During his sermon at the Baptist church and later in
an address during services at the Yelohovski Russian
Orthodox cathedral, Graham made no mention to
either religous or human rights.
Instead, he told the audiences that "God can make
you love people you normally would not love. He
gives you the power to be a better workers, a more
loyal citizen because in the 13th of Romans we are
told to obey the authorities."
Edwards to leave cabinet post
Washington — Secretary of Energy James Edwards,
has told White House officials that he will accept the

presidency of the Medical University of South Caroli
na.
Edwards, a dentist, who will become the first Cabi
net member to leave the Reagan administration, is
scheduled to depart June 30 to mixed reviews. The
former governor of South Carolina, whose memo
rable comment when he returned to dentistry was
that he wanted to "get my hands in the saliva again,"
came in with the expectation of closing down the de
partment, as Reagan had promised in the 1980 presi
dential campaign. Instead, he became a defender of
some of Energy's embedded giveaways, notably the
synthetic fuels program that Edwards saved from dec
imation at the hands of budget director David Stock
man last year.
Now that the talk of doing away with the Energy De
partment by merging it with Commerce has become a
paper promise, the administration is seeking an
energy expert to replace Edwards. "We want some
one who will run the department aggressively," an
Foundations can't replace govern
ment
Detroit — After a year of assessing Reagan Adminis
tration budget cuts, the leaders of major private and
corporate foundations say they are financially unable
to reduce significantly the impact of those cuts on so
cial services across the country.
It is unrealistic "to assume that the private sector
can be an alternative to what government has done,"
James Joseph, president of the Council on Founda
tions, said. "Those who emphasize the potential of
the independent sector and private philanthropy also
have an obligation to emphasize the limitations."
At the same time, a newly released nationwide
study by Independent Sector, an umbrella group of
foundations, business corporations and voluntary or
ganizations" said budget cuts are "weakening many
of the voluntary organizations" the administration is
relying on to expand services.
Budget cuts are affecting "disproportionately and
severely already vulnerable persons in our society,"
the study said.
The reductions already made in the federal budget
will result in a loss of $140 billion during the next four
years to social service and social welfare programs, as
well as to other nonprofit organizations, according to
the Urban Institute. In contrast, private and corporate
philanthropic foundations last year spent $5.2 oillion
funding scientific and medical research, social experi
ments and advocacy programs and supplementing
the budgets of agencies and programs receiving fed
eral funding.
"It is impossible for foundations to fill the un
quenchable thirst for funds" created by federal
spending cuts, according to Joseph Dempsey, chief
operating officer of the W. M. Keck Foundation in Los
Angeles.
That theme was repeated as foundation executives
from across the country assembled in Detroit for a
weeklong meeting sponsored by the Council on
Foundations. Further, the foundation leaders made
these points:
—The administration has created an atmosphere of
false expectations about what the private sector can
do in the wake of budget cuts.
—Funds that are diverted to services and programs
previously supported by the government will be at
the expense of activities that nave traditionally pro
duced economic and social progress. Included in this
category are medical research, educational programs,
social experiments and cultural activities, all areas that
have been heavy beneficiaries of foundations.
—There is a danger that programs and grass-roots
organizations designed to help the disadvantaged
may vanish from the American social landscape.
—In a report released May 6, Independent Sector
identified some of those programs in the greatest
jeopardy, including organizations "that represent
groups long neglected such as our Hispanic popu
lation, newer causes that are only beginning to re

ceive public attention such as battered women and
children, or less tangible and more distant concerns
such as education for international understanding."
"The people who seem to be the most adversely af
fected are the individuals and families who have been
dependent on the government for one or more of the
services being reduced, especially job training, in
come assistance, social services, basic health care and
special services for handicapped such as special
education classes," said Brian O'Connell, the study's
author and president of Independent Sector. "Tne
many persons who have depended on two or more of
these programs are in greatest difficulty."
One reason the foundations are limited in their
ability to take up the slack left by federal cuts is that
many endowments are based on holdings of common
stocks. As stock prices have generally declined in the
last two years, so have the values of endowments.
Most foundation executives interviewed in Detroit
said they did not expect major increases in their ex
penditures in the near future.
Regan: interest rates to decline
Paris — Secretary of the Treasury Donald Regan, of
fering reassurance to European leaders, said Sunday
that high U.S. interest rates are likely to start falline by
the end of summer. There is a possibility, he added,
that the extraordinary borrowing charges will begin
to drop sooner in the wake of the sharp decline in the
dollar value last week.
Regan spoke to reporters on the eve of the annual
meeting of ministers of the 24-nation Organization
for Economic Cooperation and Development open
ing tomorrow.
The OECD has scaled back its forecast of recovery
from a world recession, partly because the slump has
lasted longer than expected, and so far has failed to
bring relief from the high interest rates in the United
States. In response, European nations have raised
their interest rates to match the American borrowing
charges, but that has tended to stifle economic
growth in all the major industrial nations.
The issue, which Regan said he expected to be
raised at the sessions, also may come up at the seven
nation economic summit in Versailles next month,
which President Reagan will attend.
"I think the ministerial meetings will sort of set a
tone for the summit," Regan said. "Many will proba
bly deplore the high rates of interest in the United
States and they may be asking questions as to how we
intend to get those interest rates down.
"It's as much of a problem and a puzzle to us as it is
to them," Regan told the Anglo-American press
group, adding that the 3.5 percent inflation rate in the
United States for the last six months normally would
bring a prime lending rate of 8 percent, at most, in
stead of the current level of 16.5 percent.
"Most times that interest rates come down it's
toward the end of a recession and they are still com
ing down at the start of the recovery period," he said.
"I think perhaps that's going to happen this time,"
Regan added, renewing the forecast of a strong re
covery starting in July in the United States.
"We will offer them (OECD) delegates some en
couragement that we think we're going to be pulling
out of our recession shortly and if so then our high
rates of interest should be coming down."
In other respects, however, Regan painted a bleak
picture of the faltering U.S. economy, with un
employment surging over 10 million last month. He
said the jobless rate was unlikely to fall quickly even if
an economic rebound begins this summer.
Today's weather

Reagan proposes arms reduction
Eureka, III. — President Ronald Reagan, calling for "dismantling of
the nuclear menace," yesterday proposed one-third reductions in the
strategic missile arsenals of both the United States and the Soviet Union.
Speaking at the commencement ceremony of Eureka College, from
which he graduated 50 years ago, Reagan unveiled a two-phase plan of
nuclear arms reductions and urged the Soviets to join in discussions on
them by the end of June.
"I believe that the West can fashion a realistic, durable policy that will
protect our interests and keep the peace, not just for this generation,
but for your children and grandchildren," Reagan said to a burst of ap
plause.
The first phase of the president's proposal would reduce ballistic mis
sile warheads to "equal ceilings at least a third below current levels,"
with no more than half of these missiles based on land. This would cut
the roughly equivalent level of warheads on both sides from 7,500 to
5,000.
A prime goal is reduction of "the most destablizing nuclear systems,"
a reference to the powerful and accurate Soviet SS-18 and SS-19 missiles.
A second phase, on which the president provided no details, looks to
an equal ceiling on all strategic nuclear forces, with the apparent but
unspecified goals of preventing either superpower from launching a
successful first nuclear strike against the other.
In Moscow, in an apparent attempt to take the edge off Reagan's arms
control initiative, Defense Minister Dmitri Ustinov said in sharply
worded article in Pravda that "The Soviet Union will not allow the exist
ing balance of forces to be disrupted."
In his speech, Reagan said he was willing to negotiate in good faith on
Soviet counter-proposals. A senior administration official said yesterday
that he expects the Russians to counter with some proposal to reduce
the number of bombers, in which the United States nas a definite edge.
The official said the United States is prepared to negotiate on this issue.
Reagan also hinted that he was willing to accept Soviet President
Leonid Brezhnev's proposal for a fall summit meeting.
"I have already expressed my own desire to meet
with President Brezhnev in New York next month,"
Reagan said. "If this cannot be done I would hope we
could arrange a future meeting where positive results
can be anticipated. And when we sit down, I will tell
President Brezhnev that the United States is ready to
build a new understanding based upon the principles
I have outlined today."
Britain ends Falklands lull
Buenos Aires, Argentina — Britain ended a lull in
the South Atlantic yesterday, striking the Falkland Is
lands by air and sea, attacking a fishing vessel it said
was spying on the British fleet and reportedly shoot
ing down an Argentine transport helicopter.
Argentina said that British Harriers sank the fishing
vessel Narval and then machine gunned survivors in
its lifeboats.
In London, a Defense Ministry spokesman de
scribed as "ludicrous" the charge that Britain strafed
the lifeboats. He said the crew of the Argentine vessel
had been taken prisoner with no casualties and was
aboard a British ship. The Narval, he said, was afloat
and in British custody.
Britain returned to the offensive in the Falklands
war yesterday, slipping in close to East Falkland under
cover of darkness and shellng military targets near the
islands' capital of Stanley and the small port of
Darwin. A helicopter flying over the Falklands was
also shot down in the attack. It was not immediately
clear whether the helicopter was carrying Argentine
troops at the time or was instead flying a supply mis
sion.
The aim of the attack, the British reporters said, was
to further enforce the blockade of the islands. The last
two days, they said, Harriers had intercepted and
turned back Argentine C-130 Hercules transports
trying to reach the Falklands, and it was feared that
some supplies were reaching the Argentine garrison.
A C-130 is capable of operating on a short grass air
strip and, thus, could have circumvented British ef
forts to knock out the only paved runway, at Stanley.
It was the first war action since Tuesday, when Ar
gentina wrecked the British destroyer Sheffield with a
missile attack from the air.
Britain said that it had no reports of British casual
ties in yesterday's action and that all aircraft had re
turned safely to the fleet.
Israeli warplanes bomb Lebanon
Jerusalem — Israeli warplanes bombed and strafed
Palestinian guerrilla positions along the coast of Leba
non yesterday and Palestinian gunners retaliated by
shelling the Galilee region of northern Israel in the
most serious breakdown yet of the fragile, 10-month
cease-fire between the two sides.
Lebanese officials said at least 16 people were killed
and 56 wounded in the raids, which the Israeli Army
Command said Israel's Cabinet ordered against three
Mediterranean coastal bases "after terrorist organiza
tions during the past days repeatedly and severely vio
lated the ceasefire arrangement."
Less than an hour after the air strikes, Soviet-made
Katuysha rockets presumed to have been fired from
Palestinian positions in Nabatiyeh, southern Leba
non, fell in Galilee. Israeli television reported yester
day night that at least 150 shells were reported by resi
dents of the northern border area.
It was the first direct exchange of cross-border fire
between Israel and the Palestine Liberation Organiza
tion since the two sides, through the mediation of
U.S. special envoy Philip Habib and the U.N. peace
keeping force, agreed to a cease-fire July 24 following
the "mini" war of attrition last summer.
An Israeli Army Command spokesman said Israeli
jets bombed an arms depot and bunkers at Mazrat
Vista, three miles south of Zaharani, where the
Zaharani River flows into the Mediterranean; a train
ing base of Fatah, the main military arm of the PLO, in
Dahar Aklun, three miles south of Damour, and two
100-mm artillery guns positioned near Sidon.
The Army Command said that Palestinian anti-air

craft guns along the coast opened fire on the attack
ing Israeli planes and were bombed also.
Israel threatens end to peace talks
Jerusalem — The Israeli Cabinet threatened to scut
tle the Palestinian autonomy talks yesterday unless
Egypt agreed to hold at least one-third of the nego
tiation sessions in Jerusalem.
Meeting a few hours before the arrival of U.S.
Middle East negotiator Richard Fairbanks, the Cabi
net adopted a resolution declaring it was incon
ceivable that Israel would agree to talks that bypassed
Jerusalem.
Fairbanks plans to confer today with Israel's chief
autonomy negotiator, Interior Minister Yosef Burg,
on arrangements for restarting the stalled nego
tiations over limited self-rule for the 1.2 million Arabs
living in the occupied West Bank of the Jordan River
and the Gaza Strip. Fairbanks planned to go to Cairo
following his talks in Jerusalem.
Egypt so far has refused to participate in autonomy
negotiations in Jerusalem because the Egyptians con
tend that one issue in the talks is the future of pre
dominantly Arab East Jerusalem, which Israel cap
tured from Jordan in the Six Day War of 1967 and sub
sequently annexed. Israel maintains that it will never
again permit the partition of Jerusalem and will not
even consider permittting Arab residents of East Jeru
salem to take part in the proposed autonomy plan.
Israel's insistence on holding meetings in Jerusalem
is a new obstacle in the way of drafting rules to govern
the "whole autonomy," which the 1978 Camp David
accords proposed for the West Bank and Gaza Arabs.
Even before the new issue was raised, the talks had
reached a point of almost total deadlock.
"Questions of procedure must not stand in the way
of the autonomy talks," Fairbanks said in an arrival
statement yesterday. "Now we need imagination and
initiative to make progress in the autonomy."
Graham preaches for disarma
ment
Moscow — Evangelist Billy Graham preached a
message for disarmament in Moscow's Baptist church
yesterday as a hymn-singing overflow congregation
held an extraordinary service behind police bar
ricades on the street outside.
In his sermon the Rev. Graham reminded the con
gregation that while their first commitment must be
to Jesus Christ they must also remember that the bible
calls on them to "obey the authorities."
Speaking on the anniversary of one of the main So
viet public holidays — the victory day over Nazi Ger
many — he sought to use the memory of U.S.-Russian
wartime friendship for a new joint disarmament ef
fort.
"At that time the United States and the Soviet
Union were allies against Nazi Germany," he said.
"Now we have another common enemy — the possi
bility of a nuclear holocaust."
At the end of his sermon, a young woman unfurled
a banner from the balcony pews reading, in English,
"We have more than 150 prisoners for the work of the
gospel." The banner apparently referred to Baptists
who have been imprisoned for preaching and hold
ing services without permission.
At the same time, another banner, also in English,
was raised in the aisles directly in front of Granam,
saying "Deliver those who are driven away to death."
During his sermon at the Baptist church and later in
an address during services at the Yelohovski Russian
Orthodox cathedral, Graham made no mention to
either religous or human rights.
Instead, he told the audiences that "God can make
you love people you normally would not love. He
gives you the power to be a better workers, a more
loyal citizen because in the 13th of Romans we are
told to obey the authorities."
Edwards to leave cabinet post
Washington — Secretary of Energy James Edwards,
has told White House officials that he will accept the

presidency of the Medical University of South Caroli
na.
Edwards, a dentist, who will become the first Cabi
net member to leave the Reagan administration, is
scheduled to depart June 30 to mixed reviews. The
former governor of South Carolina, whose memo
rable comment when he returned to dentistry was
that he wanted to "get my hands in the saliva again,"
came in with the expectation of closing down the de
partment, as Reagan had promised in the 1980 presi
dential campaign. Instead, he became a defender of
some of Energy's embedded giveaways, notably the
synthetic fuels program that Edwards saved from dec
imation at the hands of budget director David Stock
man last year.
Now that the talk of doing away with the Energy De
partment by merging it with Commerce has become a
paper promise, the administration is seeking an
energy expert to replace Edwards. "We want some
one who will run the department aggressively," an
Foundations can't replace govern
ment
Detroit — After a year of assessing Reagan Adminis
tration budget cuts, the leaders of major private and
corporate foundations say they are financially unable
to reduce significantly the impact of those cuts on so
cial services across the country.
It is unrealistic "to assume that the private sector
can be an alternative to what government has done,"
James Joseph, president of the Council on Founda
tions, said. "Those who emphasize the potential of
the independent sector and private philanthropy also
have an obligation to emphasize the limitations."
At the same time, a newly released nationwide
study by Independent Sector, an umbrella group of
foundations, business corporations and voluntary or
ganizations" said budget cuts are "weakening many
of the voluntary organizations" the administration is
relying on to expand services.
Budget cuts are affecting "disproportionately and
severely already vulnerable persons in our society,"
the study said.
The reductions already made in the federal budget
will result in a loss of $140 billion during the next four
years to social service and social welfare programs, as
well as to other nonprofit organizations, according to
the Urban Institute. In contrast, private and corporate
philanthropic foundations last year spent $5.2 oillion
funding scientific and medical research, social experi
ments and advocacy programs and supplementing
the budgets of agencies and programs receiving fed
eral funding.
"It is impossible for foundations to fill the un
quenchable thirst for funds" created by federal
spending cuts, according to Joseph Dempsey, chief
operating officer of the W. M. Keck Foundation in Los
Angeles.
That theme was repeated as foundation executives
from across the country assembled in Detroit for a
weeklong meeting sponsored by the Council on
Foundations. Further, the foundation leaders made
these points:
—The administration has created an atmosphere of
false expectations about what the private sector can
do in the wake of budget cuts.
—Funds that are diverted to services and programs
previously supported by the government will be at
the expense of activities that nave traditionally pro
duced economic and social progress. Included in this
category are medical research, educational programs,
social experiments and cultural activities, all areas that
have been heavy beneficiaries of foundations.
—There is a danger that programs and grass-roots
organizations designed to help the disadvantaged
may vanish from the American social landscape.
—In a report released May 6, Independent Sector
identified some of those programs in the greatest
jeopardy, including organizations "that represent
groups long neglected such as our Hispanic popu
lation, newer causes that are only beginning to re

ceive public attention such as battered women and
children, or less tangible and more distant concerns
such as education for international understanding."
"The people who seem to be the most adversely af
fected are the individuals and families who have been
dependent on the government for one or more of the
services being reduced, especially job training, in
come assistance, social services, basic health care and
special services for handicapped such as special
education classes," said Brian O'Connell, the study's
author and president of Independent Sector. "Tne
many persons who have depended on two or more of
these programs are in greatest difficulty."
One reason the foundations are limited in their
ability to take up the slack left by federal cuts is that
many endowments are based on holdings of common
stocks. As stock prices have generally declined in the
last two years, so have the values of endowments.
Most foundation executives interviewed in Detroit
said they did not expect major increases in their ex
penditures in the near future.
Regan: interest rates to decline
Paris — Secretary of the Treasury Donald Regan, of
fering reassurance to European leaders, said Sunday
that high U.S. interest rates are likely to start falline by
the end of summer. There is a possibility, he added,
that the extraordinary borrowing charges will begin
to drop sooner in the wake of the sharp decline in the
dollar value last week.
Regan spoke to reporters on the eve of the annual
meeting of ministers of the 24-nation Organization
for Economic Cooperation and Development open
ing tomorrow.
The OECD has scaled back its forecast of recovery
from a world recession, partly because the slump has
lasted longer than expected, and so far has failed to
bring relief from the high interest rates in the United
States. In response, European nations have raised
their interest rates to match the American borrowing
charges, but that has tended to stifle economic
growth in all the major industrial nations.
The issue, which Regan said he expected to be
raised at the sessions, also may come up at the seven
nation economic summit in Versailles next month,
which President Reagan will attend.
"I think the ministerial meetings will sort of set a
tone for the summit," Regan said. "Many will proba
bly deplore the high rates of interest in the United
States and they may be asking questions as to how we
intend to get those interest rates down.
"It's as much of a problem and a puzzle to us as it is
to them," Regan told the Anglo-American press
group, adding that the 3.5 percent inflation rate in the
United States for the last six months normally would
bring a prime lending rate of 8 percent, at most, in
stead of the current level of 16.5 percent.
"Most times that interest rates come down it's
toward the end of a recession and they are still com
ing down at the start of the recovery period," he said.
"I think perhaps that's going to happen this time,"
Regan added, renewing the forecast of a strong re
covery starting in July in the United States.
"We will offer them (OECD) delegates some en
couragement that we think we're going to be pulling
out of our recession shortly and if so then our high
rates of interest should be coming down."
In other respects, however, Regan painted a bleak
picture of the faltering U.S. economy, with un
employment surging over 10 million last month. He
said the jobless rate was unlikely to fall quickly even if
an economic rebound begins this summer.

ing down at the start of the recovery period," he said.
"I think perhaps that's going to happen this time,"
Regan added, renewing the forecast of a strong re
covery starting in July in the United States.
"We will offer them (OECD) delegates some en
couragement that we think we're going to be pulling
out of our recession shortly and if so then our high
rates of interest should be coming down."
In other respects, however, Regan painted a bleak
picture of the faltering U.S. economy, with un
employment surging over 10 million last month. He
said the jobless rate was unlikely to fall quickly even if
an economic rebound begins this summer.

Reagan proposes arms reduction
Eureka, III. — President Ronald Reagan, calling for "dismantling of
the nuclear menace," yesterday proposed one-third reductions in the
strategic missile arsenals of both the United States and the Soviet Union.
Speaking at the commencement ceremony of Eureka College, from
which he graduated 50 years ago, Reagan unveiled a two-phase plan of
nuclear arms reductions and urged the Soviets to join in discussions on
them by the end of June.
"I believe that the West can fashion a realistic, durable policy that will
protect our interests and keep the peace, not just for this generation,
but for your children and grandchildren," Reagan said to a burst of ap
plause.
The first phase of the president's proposal would reduce ballistic mis
sile warheads to "equal ceilings at least a third below current levels,"
with no more than half of these missiles based on land. This would cut
the roughly equivalent level of warheads on both sides from 7,500 to
5,000.
A prime goal is reduction of "the most destablizing nuclear systems,"
a reference to the powerful and accurate Soviet SS-18 and SS-19 missiles.
A second phase, on which the president provided no details, looks to
an equal ceiling on all strategic nuclear forces, with the apparent but
unspecified goals of preventing either superpower from launching a
successful first nuclear strike against the other.
In Moscow, in an apparent attempt to take the edge off Reagan's arms
control initiative, Defense Minister Dmitri Ustinov said in sharply
worded article in Pravda that "The Soviet Union will not allow the exist
ing balance of forces to be disrupted."
In his speech, Reagan said he was willing to negotiate in good faith on
Soviet counter-proposals. A senior administration official said yesterday
that he expects the Russians to counter with some proposal to reduce
the number of bombers, in which the United States nas a definite edge.
The official said the United States is prepared to negotiate on this issue.
Reagan also hinted that he was willing to accept Soviet President
Leonid Brezhnev's proposal for a fall summit meeting.
"I have already expressed my own desire to meet
with President Brezhnev in New York next month,"
Reagan said. "If this cannot be done I would hope we
could arrange a future meeting where positive results
can be anticipated. And when we sit down, I will tell
President Brezhnev that the United States is ready to
build a new understanding based upon the principles
I have outlined today."
Britain ends Falklands lull
Buenos Aires, Argentina — Britain ended a lull in
the South Atlantic yesterday, striking the Falkland Is
lands by air and sea, attacking a fishing vessel it said
was spying on the British fleet and reportedly shoot
ing down an Argentine transport helicopter.
Argentina said that British Harriers sank the fishing
vessel Narval and then machine gunned survivors in
its lifeboats.
In London, a Defense Ministry spokesman de
scribed as "ludicrous" the charge that Britain strafed
the lifeboats. He said the crew of the Argentine vessel
had been taken prisoner with no casualties and was
aboard a British ship. The Narval, he said, was afloat
and in British custody.
Britain returned to the offensive in the Falklands
war yesterday, slipping in close to East Falkland under
cover of darkness and shellng military targets near the
islands' capital of Stanley and the small port of
Darwin. A helicopter flying over the Falklands was
also shot down in the attack. It was not immediately
clear whether the helicopter was carrying Argentine
troops at the time or was instead flying a supply mis
sion.
The aim of the attack, the British reporters said, was
to further enforce the blockade of the islands. The last
two days, they said, Harriers had intercepted and
turned back Argentine C-130 Hercules transports
trying to reach the Falklands, and it was feared that
some supplies were reaching the Argentine garrison.
A C-130 is capable of operating on a short grass air
strip and, thus, could have circumvented British ef
forts to knock out the only paved runway, at Stanley.
It was the first war action since Tuesday, when Ar
gentina wrecked the British destroyer Sheffield with a
missile attack from the air.
Britain said that it had no reports of British casual
ties in yesterday's action and that all aircraft had re
turned safely to the fleet.
Israeli warplanes bomb Lebanon
Jerusalem — Israeli warplanes bombed and strafed
Palestinian guerrilla positions along the coast of Leba
non yesterday and Palestinian gunners retaliated by
shelling the Galilee region of northern Israel in the
most serious breakdown yet of the fragile, 10-month
cease-fire between the two sides.
Lebanese officials said at least 16 people were killed
and 56 wounded in the raids, which the Israeli Army
Command said Israel's Cabinet ordered against three
Mediterranean coastal bases "after terrorist organiza
tions during the past days repeatedly and severely vio
lated the ceasefire arrangement."
Less than an hour after the air strikes, Soviet-made
Katuysha rockets presumed to have been fired from
Palestinian positions in Nabatiyeh, southern Leba
non, fell in Galilee. Israeli television reported yester
day night that at least 150 shells were reported by resi
dents of the northern border area.
It was the first direct exchange of cross-border fire
between Israel and the Palestine Liberation Organiza
tion since the two sides, through the mediation of
U.S. special envoy Philip Habib and the U.N. peace
keeping force, agreed to a cease-fire July 24 following
the "mini" war of attrition last summer.
An Israeli Army Command spokesman said Israeli
jets bombed an arms depot and bunkers at Mazrat
Vista, three miles south of Zaharani, where the
Zaharani River flows into the Mediterranean; a train
ing base of Fatah, the main military arm of the PLO, in
Dahar Aklun, three miles south of Damour, and two
100-mm artillery guns positioned near Sidon.
The Army Command said that Palestinian anti-air

craft guns along the coast opened fire on the attack
ing Israeli planes and were bombed also.
Israel threatens end to peace talks
Jerusalem — The Israeli Cabinet threatened to scut
tle the Palestinian autonomy talks yesterday unless
Egypt agreed to hold at least one-third of the nego
tiation sessions in Jerusalem.
Meeting a few hours before the arrival of U.S.
Middle East negotiator Richard Fairbanks, the Cabi
net adopted a resolution declaring it was incon
ceivable that Israel would agree to talks that bypassed
Jerusalem.
Fairbanks plans to confer today with Israel's chief
autonomy negotiator, Interior Minister Yosef Burg,
on arrangements for restarting the stalled nego
tiations over limited self-rule for the 1.2 million Arabs
living in the occupied West Bank of the Jordan River
and the Gaza Strip. Fairbanks planned to go to Cairo
following his talks in Jerusalem.
Egypt so far has refused to participate in autonomy
negotiations in Jerusalem because the Egyptians con
tend that one issue in the talks is the future of pre
dominantly Arab East Jerusalem, which Israel cap
tured from Jordan in the Six Day War of 1967 and sub
sequently annexed. Israel maintains that it will never
again permit the partition of Jerusalem and will not
even consider permittting Arab residents of East Jeru
salem to take part in the proposed autonomy plan.
Israel's insistence on holding meetings in Jerusalem
is a new obstacle in the way of drafting rules to govern
the "whole autonomy," which the 1978 Camp David
accords proposed for the West Bank and Gaza Arabs.
Even before the new issue was raised, the talks had
reached a point of almost total deadlock.
"Questions of procedure must not stand in the way
of the autonomy talks," Fairbanks said in an arrival
statement yesterday. "Now we need imagination and
initiative to make progress in the autonomy."
Graham preaches for disarma
ment
Moscow — Evangelist Billy Graham preached a
message for disarmament in Moscow's Baptist church
yesterday as a hymn-singing overflow congregation
held an extraordinary service behind police bar
ricades on the street outside.
In his sermon the Rev. Graham reminded the con
gregation that while their first commitment must be
to Jesus Christ they must also remember that the bible
calls on them to "obey the authorities."
Speaking on the anniversary of one of the main So
viet public holidays — the victory day over Nazi Ger
many — he sought to use the memory of U.S.-Russian
wartime friendship for a new joint disarmament ef
fort.
"At that time the United States and the Soviet
Union were allies against Nazi Germany," he said.
"Now we have another common enemy — the possi
bility of a nuclear holocaust."
At the end of his sermon, a young woman unfurled
a banner from the balcony pews reading, in English,
"We have more than 150 prisoners for the work of the
gospel." The banner apparently referred to Baptists
who have been imprisoned for preaching and hold
ing services without permission.
At the same time, another banner, also in English,
was raised in the aisles directly in front of Granam,
saying "Deliver those who are driven away to death."
During his sermon at the Baptist church and later in
an address during services at the Yelohovski Russian
Orthodox cathedral, Graham made no mention to
either religous or human rights.
Instead, he told the audiences that "God can make
you love people you normally would not love. He
gives you the power to be a better workers, a more
loyal citizen because in the 13th of Romans we are
told to obey the authorities."
Edwards to leave cabinet post
Washington — Secretary of Energy James Edwards,
has told White House officials that he will accept the

presidency of the Medical University of South Caroli
na.
Edwards, a dentist, who will become the first Cabi
net member to leave the Reagan administration, is
scheduled to depart June 30 to mixed reviews. The
former governor of South Carolina, whose memo
rable comment when he returned to dentistry was
that he wanted to "get my hands in the saliva again,"
came in with the expectation of closing down the de
partment, as Reagan had promised in the 1980 presi
dential campaign. Instead, he became a defender of
some of Energy's embedded giveaways, notably the
synthetic fuels program that Edwards saved from dec
imation at the hands of budget director David Stock
man last year.
Now that the talk of doing away with the Energy De
partment by merging it with Commerce has become a
paper promise, the administration is seeking an
energy expert to replace Edwards. "We want some
one who will run the department aggressively," an
Foundations can't replace govern
ment
Detroit — After a year of assessing Reagan Adminis
tration budget cuts, the leaders of major private and
corporate foundations say they are financially unable
to reduce significantly the impact of those cuts on so
cial services across the country.
It is unrealistic "to assume that the private sector
can be an alternative to what government has done,"
James Joseph, president of the Council on Founda
tions, said. "Those who emphasize the potential of
the independent sector and private philanthropy also
have an obligation to emphasize the limitations."
At the same time, a newly released nationwide
study by Independent Sector, an umbrella group of
foundations, business corporations and voluntary or
ganizations" said budget cuts are "weakening many
of the voluntary organizations" the administration is
relying on to expand services.
Budget cuts are affecting "disproportionately and
severely already vulnerable persons in our society,"
the study said.
The reductions already made in the federal budget
will result in a loss of $140 billion during the next four
years to social service and social welfare programs, as
well as to other nonprofit organizations, according to
the Urban Institute. In contrast, private and corporate
philanthropic foundations last year spent $5.2 oillion
funding scientific and medical research, social experi
ments and advocacy programs and supplementing
the budgets of agencies and programs receiving fed
eral funding.
"It is impossible for foundations to fill the un
quenchable thirst for funds" created by federal
spending cuts, according to Joseph Dempsey, chief
operating officer of the W. M. Keck Foundation in Los
Angeles.
That theme was repeated as foundation executives
from across the country assembled in Detroit for a
weeklong meeting sponsored by the Council on
Foundations. Further, the foundation leaders made
these points:
—The administration has created an atmosphere of
false expectations about what the private sector can
do in the wake of budget cuts.
—Funds that are diverted to services and programs
previously supported by the government will be at
the expense of activities that nave traditionally pro
duced economic and social progress. Included in this
category are medical research, educational programs,
social experiments and cultural activities, all areas that
have been heavy beneficiaries of foundations.
—There is a danger that programs and grass-roots
organizations designed to help the disadvantaged
may vanish from the American social landscape.
—In a report released May 6, Independent Sector
identified some of those programs in the greatest
jeopardy, including organizations "that represent
groups long neglected such as our Hispanic popu
lation, newer causes that are only beginning to re

ceive public attention such as battered women and
children, or less tangible and more distant concerns
such as education for international understanding."
"The people who seem to be the most adversely af
fected are the individuals and families who have been
dependent on the government for one or more of the
services being reduced, especially job training, in
come assistance, social services, basic health care and
special services for handicapped such as special
education classes," said Brian O'Connell, the study's
author and president of Independent Sector. "Tne
many persons who have depended on two or more of
these programs are in greatest difficulty."
One reason the foundations are limited in their
ability to take up the slack left by federal cuts is that
many endowments are based on holdings of common
stocks. As stock prices have generally declined in the
last two years, so have the values of endowments.
Most foundation executives interviewed in Detroit
said they did not expect major increases in their ex
penditures in the near future.
Regan: interest rates to decline
Paris — Secretary of the Treasury Donald Regan, of
fering reassurance to European leaders, said Sunday
that high U.S. interest rates are likely to start falline by
the end of summer. There is a possibility, he added,
that the extraordinary borrowing charges will begin
to drop sooner in the wake of the sharp decline in the
dollar value last week.
Regan spoke to reporters on the eve of the annual
meeting of ministers of the 24-nation Organization
for Economic Cooperation and Development open
ing tomorrow.
The OECD has scaled back its forecast of recovery
from a world recession, partly because the slump has
lasted longer than expected, and so far has failed to
bring relief from the high interest rates in the United
States. In response, European nations have raised
their interest rates to match the American borrowing
charges, but that has tended to stifle economic
growth in all the major industrial nations.
The issue, which Regan said he expected to be
raised at the sessions, also may come up at the seven
nation economic summit in Versailles next month,
which President Reagan will attend.
"I think the ministerial meetings will sort of set a
tone for the summit," Regan said. "Many will proba
bly deplore the high rates of interest in the United
States and they may be asking questions as to how we
intend to get those interest rates down.
"It's as much of a problem and a puzzle to us as it is
to them," Regan told the Anglo-American press
group, adding that the 3.5 percent inflation rate in the
United States for the last six months normally would
bring a prime lending rate of 8 percent, at most, in
stead of the current level of 16.5 percent.
"Most times that interest rates come down it's
toward the end of a recession and they are still com
ing down at the start of the recovery period," he said.
"I think perhaps that's going to happen this time,"
Regan added, renewing the forecast of a strong re
covery starting in July in the United States.
"We will offer them (OECD) delegates some en
couragement that we think we're going to be pulling
out of our recession shortly and if so then our high
rates of interest should be coming down."

employment surging over 10 million last month. He
said the jobless rate was unlikely to fall quickly even if
an economic rebound begins this summer.

"It's as much of a problem and a puzzle to us as it is
to them," Regan told the Anglo-American press
group, adding that the 3.5 percent inflation rate in the
United States for the last six months normally would
bring a prime lending rate of 8 percent, at most, in
stead of the current level of 16.5 percent.
"Most times that interest rates come down it's
toward the end of a recession and they are still com

"I think perhaps that's going to happen this time,"
Regan added, renewing the forecast of a strong re
covery starting in July in the United States.
"We will offer them (OECD) delegates some en
couragement that we think we're going to be pulling
out of our recession shortly and if so then our high
rates of interest should be coming down."
In other respects, however, Regan painted a bleak
picture of the faltering U.S. economy, with un
employment surging over 10 million last month. He
said the jobless rate was unlikely to fall quickly even if
an economic rebound begins this summer.

Reagan proposes arms reduction
Eureka, III. — President Ronald Reagan, calling for "dismantling of
the nuclear menace," yesterday proposed one-third reductions in the
strategic missile arsenals of both the United States and the Soviet Union.
Speaking at the commencement ceremony of Eureka College, from
which he graduated 50 years ago, Reagan unveiled a two-phase plan of
nuclear arms reductions and urged the Soviets to join in discussions on
them by the end of June.
"I believe that the West can fashion a realistic, durable policy that will
protect our interests and keep the peace, not just for this generation,
but for your children and grandchildren," Reagan said to a burst of ap
plause.
The first phase of the president's proposal would reduce ballistic mis
sile warheads to "equal ceilings at least a third below current levels,"
with no more than half of these missiles based on land. This would cut
the roughly equivalent level of warheads on both sides from 7,500 to
5,000.
A prime goal is reduction of "the most destablizing nuclear systems,"
a reference to the powerful and accurate Soviet SS-18 and SS-19 missiles.
A second phase, on which the president provided no details, looks to
an equal ceiling on all strategic nuclear forces, with the apparent but
unspecified goals of preventing either superpower from launching a
successful first nuclear strike against the other.
In Moscow, in an apparent attempt to take the edge off Reagan's arms
control initiative, Defense Minister Dmitri Ustinov said in sharply
worded article in Pravda that "The Soviet Union will not allow the exist
ing balance of forces to be disrupted."
In his speech, Reagan said he was willing to negotiate in good faith on
Soviet counter-proposals. A senior administration official said yesterday
that he expects the Russians to counter with some proposal to reduce
the number of bombers, in which the United States nas a definite edge.
The official said the United States is prepared to negotiate on this issue.
Reagan also hinted that he was willing to accept Soviet President
Leonid Brezhnev's proposal for a fall summit meeting.
"I have already expressed my own desire to meet
with President Brezhnev in New York next month,"
Reagan said. "If this cannot be done I would hope we
could arrange a future meeting where positive results
can be anticipated. And when we sit down, I will tell
President Brezhnev that the United States is ready to
build a new understanding based upon the principles
I have outlined today."
Britain ends Falklands lull
Buenos Aires, Argentina — Britain ended a lull in
the South Atlantic yesterday, striking the Falkland Is
lands by air and sea, attacking a fishing vessel it said
was spying on the British fleet and reportedly shoot
ing down an Argentine transport helicopter.
Argentina said that British Harriers sank the fishing
vessel Narval and then machine gunned survivors in
its lifeboats.
In London, a Defense Ministry spokesman de
scribed as "ludicrous" the charge that Britain strafed
the lifeboats. He said the crew of the Argentine vessel
had been taken prisoner with no casualties and was
aboard a British ship. The Narval, he said, was afloat
and in British custody.
Britain returned to the offensive in the Falklands
war yesterday, slipping in close to East Falkland under
cover of darkness and shellng military targets near the
islands' capital of Stanley and the small port of
Darwin. A helicopter flying over the Falklands was
also shot down in the attack. It was not immediately
clear whether the helicopter was carrying Argentine
troops at the time or was instead flying a supply mis
sion.
The aim of the attack, the British reporters said, was
to further enforce the blockade of the islands. The last
two days, they said, Harriers had intercepted and
turned back Argentine C-130 Hercules transports
trying to reach the Falklands, and it was feared that
some supplies were reaching the Argentine garrison.
A C-130 is capable of operating on a short grass air
strip and, thus, could have circumvented British ef
forts to knock out the only paved runway, at Stanley.
It was the first war action since Tuesday, when Ar
gentina wrecked the British destroyer Sheffield with a
missile attack from the air.
Britain said that it had no reports of British casual
ties in yesterday's action and that all aircraft had re
turned safely to the fleet.
Israeli warplanes bomb Lebanon
Jerusalem — Israeli warplanes bombed and strafed
Palestinian guerrilla positions along the coast of Leba
non yesterday and Palestinian gunners retaliated by
shelling the Galilee region of northern Israel in the
most serious breakdown yet of the fragile, 10-month
cease-fire between the two sides.
Lebanese officials said at least 16 people were killed
and 56 wounded in the raids, which the Israeli Army
Command said Israel's Cabinet ordered against three
Mediterranean coastal bases "after terrorist organiza
tions during the past days repeatedly and severely vio
lated the ceasefire arrangement."
Less than an hour after the air strikes, Soviet-made
Katuysha rockets presumed to have been fired from
Palestinian positions in Nabatiyeh, southern Leba
non, fell in Galilee. Israeli television reported yester
day night that at least 150 shells were reported by resi
dents of the northern border area.
It was the first direct exchange of cross-border fire
between Israel and the Palestine Liberation Organiza
tion since the two sides, through the mediation of
U.S. special envoy Philip Habib and the U.N. peace
keeping force, agreed to a cease-fire July 24 following
the "mini" war of attrition last summer.
An Israeli Army Command spokesman said Israeli
jets bombed an arms depot and bunkers at Mazrat
Vista, three miles south of Zaharani, where the
Zaharani River flows into the Mediterranean; a train
ing base of Fatah, the main military arm of the PLO, in
Dahar Aklun, three miles south of Damour, and two
100-mm artillery guns positioned near Sidon.
The Army Command said that Palestinian anti-air

craft guns along the coast opened fire on the attack
ing Israeli planes and were bombed also.
Israel threatens end to peace talks
Jerusalem — The Israeli Cabinet threatened to scut
tle the Palestinian autonomy talks yesterday unless
Egypt agreed to hold at least one-third of the nego
tiation sessions in Jerusalem.
Meeting a few hours before the arrival of U.S.
Middle East negotiator Richard Fairbanks, the Cabi
net adopted a resolution declaring it was incon
ceivable that Israel would agree to talks that bypassed
Jerusalem.
Fairbanks plans to confer today with Israel's chief
autonomy negotiator, Interior Minister Yosef Burg,
on arrangements for restarting the stalled nego
tiations over limited self-rule for the 1.2 million Arabs
living in the occupied West Bank of the Jordan River
and the Gaza Strip. Fairbanks planned to go to Cairo
following his talks in Jerusalem.
Egypt so far has refused to participate in autonomy
negotiations in Jerusalem because the Egyptians con
tend that one issue in the talks is the future of pre
dominantly Arab East Jerusalem, which Israel cap
tured from Jordan in the Six Day War of 1967 and sub
sequently annexed. Israel maintains that it will never
again permit the partition of Jerusalem and will not
even consider permittting Arab residents of East Jeru
salem to take part in the proposed autonomy plan.
Israel's insistence on holding meetings in Jerusalem
is a new obstacle in the way of drafting rules to govern
the "whole autonomy," which the 1978 Camp David
accords proposed for the West Bank and Gaza Arabs.
Even before the new issue was raised, the talks had
reached a point of almost total deadlock.
"Questions of procedure must not stand in the way
of the autonomy talks," Fairbanks said in an arrival
statement yesterday. "Now we need imagination and
initiative to make progress in the autonomy."
Graham preaches for disarma
ment
Moscow — Evangelist Billy Graham preached a
message for disarmament in Moscow's Baptist church
yesterday as a hymn-singing overflow congregation
held an extraordinary service behind police bar
ricades on the street outside.
In his sermon the Rev. Graham reminded the con
gregation that while their first commitment must be
to Jesus Christ they must also remember that the bible
calls on them to "obey the authorities."
Speaking on the anniversary of one of the main So
viet public holidays — the victory day over Nazi Ger
many — he sought to use the memory of U.S.-Russian
wartime friendship for a new joint disarmament ef
fort.
"At that time the United States and the Soviet
Union were allies against Nazi Germany," he said.
"Now we have another common enemy — the possi
bility of a nuclear holocaust."
At the end of his sermon, a young woman unfurled
a banner from the balcony pews reading, in English,
"We have more than 150 prisoners for the work of the
gospel." The banner apparently referred to Baptists
who have been imprisoned for preaching and hold
ing services without permission.
At the same time, another banner, also in English,
was raised in the aisles directly in front of Granam,
saying "Deliver those who are driven away to death."
During his sermon at the Baptist church and later in
an address during services at the Yelohovski Russian
Orthodox cathedral, Graham made no mention to
either religous or human rights.
Instead, he told the audiences that "God can make
you love people you normally would not love. He
gives you the power to be a better workers, a more
loyal citizen because in the 13th of Romans we are
told to obey the authorities."
Edwards to leave cabinet post
Washington — Secretary of Energy James Edwards,
has told White House officials that he will accept the

presidency of the Medical University of South Caroli
na.
Edwards, a dentist, who will become the first Cabi
net member to leave the Reagan administration, is
scheduled to depart June 30 to mixed reviews. The
former governor of South Carolina, whose memo
rable comment when he returned to dentistry was
that he wanted to "get my hands in the saliva again,"
came in with the expectation of closing down the de
partment, as Reagan had promised in the 1980 presi
dential campaign. Instead, he became a defender of
some of Energy's embedded giveaways, notably the
synthetic fuels program that Edwards saved from dec
imation at the hands of budget director David Stock
man last year.
Now that the talk of doing away with the Energy De
partment by merging it with Commerce has become a
paper promise, the administration is seeking an
energy expert to replace Edwards. "We want some
one who will run the department aggressively," an
Foundations can't replace govern
ment
Detroit — After a year of assessing Reagan Adminis
tration budget cuts, the leaders of major private and
corporate foundations say they are financially unable
to reduce significantly the impact of those cuts on so
cial services across the country.
It is unrealistic "to assume that the private sector
can be an alternative to what government has done,"
James Joseph, president of the Council on Founda
tions, said. "Those who emphasize the potential of
the independent sector and private philanthropy also
have an obligation to emphasize the limitations."
At the same time, a newly released nationwide
study by Independent Sector, an umbrella group of
foundations, business corporations and voluntary or
ganizations" said budget cuts are "weakening many
of the voluntary organizations" the administration is
relying on to expand services.
Budget cuts are affecting "disproportionately and
severely already vulnerable persons in our society,"
the study said.
The reductions already made in the federal budget
will result in a loss of $140 billion during the next four
years to social service and social welfare programs, as
well as to other nonprofit organizations, according to
the Urban Institute. In contrast, private and corporate
philanthropic foundations last year spent $5.2 oillion
funding scientific and medical research, social experi
ments and advocacy programs and supplementing
the budgets of agencies and programs receiving fed
eral funding.
"It is impossible for foundations to fill the un
quenchable thirst for funds" created by federal
spending cuts, according to Joseph Dempsey, chief
operating officer of the W. M. Keck Foundation in Los
Angeles.
That theme was repeated as foundation executives
from across the country assembled in Detroit for a
weeklong meeting sponsored by the Council on
Foundations. Further, the foundation leaders made
these points:
—The administration has created an atmosphere of
false expectations about what the private sector can
do in the wake of budget cuts.
—Funds that are diverted to services and programs
previously supported by the government will be at
the expense of activities that nave traditionally pro
duced economic and social progress. Included in this
category are medical research, educational programs,
social experiments and cultural activities, all areas that
have been heavy beneficiaries of foundations.
—There is a danger that programs and grass-roots
organizations designed to help the disadvantaged
may vanish from the American social landscape.
—In a report released May 6, Independent Sector
identified some of those programs in the greatest
jeopardy, including organizations "that represent
groups long neglected such as our Hispanic popu
lation, newer causes that are only beginning to re

ceive public attention such as battered women and
children, or less tangible and more distant concerns
such as education for international understanding."
"The people who seem to be the most adversely af
fected are the individuals and families who have been
dependent on the government for one or more of the
services being reduced, especially job training, in
come assistance, social services, basic health care and
special services for handicapped such as special
education classes," said Brian O'Connell, the study's
author and president of Independent Sector. "Tne
many persons who have depended on two or more of
these programs are in greatest difficulty."
One reason the foundations are limited in their
ability to take up the slack left by federal cuts is that
many endowments are based on holdings of common
stocks. As stock prices have generally declined in the
last two years, so have the values of endowments.
Most foundation executives interviewed in Detroit
said they did not expect major increases in their ex
penditures in the near future.
Regan: interest rates to decline
Paris — Secretary of the Treasury Donald Regan, of
fering reassurance to European leaders, said Sunday
that high U.S. interest rates are likely to start falline by
the end of summer. There is a possibility, he added,
that the extraordinary borrowing charges will begin
to drop sooner in the wake of the sharp decline in the
dollar value last week.
Regan spoke to reporters on the eve of the annual
meeting of ministers of the 24-nation Organization
for Economic Cooperation and Development open
ing tomorrow.
The OECD has scaled back its forecast of recovery
from a world recession, partly because the slump has
lasted longer than expected, and so far has failed to
bring relief from the high interest rates in the United
States. In response, European nations have raised
their interest rates to match the American borrowing
charges, but that has tended to stifle economic
growth in all the major industrial nations.
The issue, which Regan said he expected to be
raised at the sessions, also may come up at the seven
nation economic summit in Versailles next month,
which President Reagan will attend.
"I think the ministerial meetings will sort of set a
tone for the summit," Regan said. "Many will proba
bly deplore the high rates of interest in the United
States and they may be asking questions as to how we
intend to get those interest rates down.
"It's as much of a problem and a puzzle to us as it is
to them," Regan told the Anglo-American press
group, adding that the 3.5 percent inflation rate in the
United States for the last six months normally would
bring a prime lending rate of 8 percent, at most, in
stead of the current level of 16.5 percent.

ing down at the start of the recovery period," he said.

covery starting in July in the United States.

said the jobless rate was unlikely to fall quickly even if
an economic rebound begins this summer.

their interest rates to match the American borrowing
charges, but that has tended to stifle economic
growth in all the major industrial nations.
The issue, which Regan said he expected to be
raised at the sessions, also may come up at the seven
nation economic summit in Versailles next month,
which President Reagan will attend.
"I think the ministerial meetings will sort of set a
tone for the summit," Regan said. "Many will proba
bly deplore the high rates of interest in the United
States and they may be asking questions as to how we
intend to get those interest rates down.
"It's as much of a problem and a puzzle to us as it is
to them," Regan told the Anglo-American press
group, adding that the 3.5 percent inflation rate in the
United States for the last six months normally would
bring a prime lending rate of 8 percent, at most, in
stead of the current level of 16.5 percent.
"Most times that interest rates come down it's
toward the end of a recession and they are still com
ing down at the start of the recovery period," he said.
"I think perhaps that's going to happen this time,"
Regan added, renewing the forecast of a strong re
covery starting in July in the United States.
"We will offer them (OECD) delegates some en
couragement that we think we're going to be pulling
out of our recession shortly and if so then our high
rates of interest should be coming down."
In other respects, however, Regan painted a bleak
picture of the faltering U.S. economy, with un
employment surging over 10 million last month. He
said the jobless rate was unlikely to fall quickly even if
an economic rebound begins this summer.
