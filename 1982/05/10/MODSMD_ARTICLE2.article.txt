Reagan proposes arms reduction
Eureka, III. — President Ronald Reagan, calling for "dismantling of
the nuclear menace," yesterday proposed one-third reductions in the
strategic missile arsenals of both the United States and the Soviet Union.
Speaking at the commencement ceremony of Eureka College, from
which he graduated 50 years ago, Reagan unveiled a two-phase plan of
nuclear arms reductions and urged the Soviets to join in discussions on
them by the end of June.
"I believe that the West can fashion a realistic, durable policy that will
protect our interests and keep the peace, not just for this generation,
but for your children and grandchildren," Reagan said to a burst of ap
plause.
The first phase of the president's proposal would reduce ballistic mis
sile warheads to "equal ceilings at least a third below current levels,"
with no more than half of these missiles based on land. This would cut
the roughly equivalent level of warheads on both sides from 7,500 to
5,000.
A prime goal is reduction of "the most destablizing nuclear systems,"
a reference to the powerful and accurate Soviet SS-18 and SS-19 missiles.
A second phase, on which the president provided no details, looks to
an equal ceiling on all strategic nuclear forces, with the apparent but
unspecified goals of preventing either superpower from launching a
successful first nuclear strike against the other.
In Moscow, in an apparent attempt to take the edge off Reagan's arms
control initiative, Defense Minister Dmitri Ustinov said in sharply
worded article in Pravda that "The Soviet Union will not allow the exist
ing balance of forces to be disrupted."
In his speech, Reagan said he was willing to negotiate in good faith on
Soviet counter-proposals. A senior administration official said yesterday
that he expects the Russians to counter with some proposal to reduce
the number of bombers, in which the United States nas a definite edge.
The official said the United States is prepared to negotiate on this issue.
Reagan also hinted that he was willing to accept Soviet President
Leonid Brezhnev's proposal for a fall summit meeting.
