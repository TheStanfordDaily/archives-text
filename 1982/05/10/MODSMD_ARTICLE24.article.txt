## Netters defeat No. 2 UCLA 
### Mark Zeigler 
The No.l ranked women's
tennis team further widened
the gap between itself and No.
2 UCLA by completing a 16-0
undefeated season with a 8-1
thrashing of the Bruins Satur
day at the Varsity Courts.
The Card swept all six singles
matches, dropping only the no.
2 doubles spot. "I think ev
erybody played really well,"
said co ach Frank Brennan. "It
was just one of those days."
All the Card victories were in
straight sets. Only No. 2 singles
went the full three sets with
Elise Burgin beating UCLA's
Shelley Solomon 3-6,6-2,6-4.
Stanford's victory ensured it
a No. 1 seeding in next week's
NCAA championships at Salt
Lake City, Utah. UCLA should
be seeded second, USC third
and Trinity of Texas fourth. The
Card has now beaten the
Bruins twice this year.
Caryn Copeland set the tone
for Stanford by finishing off
Bruin Helena Mansetat the
sixth spot in less than an hour,
6-1, 6-1. "Caryn Copeland
played the best tennis I've seen
her play in three years," Bren
nan said.
Three hours after her straight
set victory, Copeland teamed
up with Aiycia Moulton to

down UCLA's Lynn Lewis-
Heather Ludloff No. 1 doubles
pair just as convicingly — 6-1,
6-4. Lewis-Ludloff sported a
16-1 record going into the
match and was thought of as
the best doubles team in the
nation.
At the top singles position,
Moulton disposed of Katherin
Keil 7-6 (7-5), 7-6 (7-5), Improv
ing her individual record to
12-2 as well as her chances for
the NCAA singles crown.
After jumping out to a first
set 3-0 lead, Moulton faltered
and Keil took five straight
games from the Cardinal sen
ior. Then Moulton held service
twice and broke Keil's once to
gain a 6-5 advantage. But again
the momentum shifted as Keil
captured the next four points
while holding serve.
Despite a pair of double
faults in the tie breaker,
Moulton hit a forehand
crosscourt winner and then
forced a Keil error for the first
set victory.
The second set was almost a
duplicate of the first. Down 5-3,
Moulton hit three straight
smashes to break Keil's serve
Moulton proceeded to hold, a'
the Bruin's efforts at ap
proaching the net were
thwarted by masterfully placed

passing shots.
After both players held,
Moulton again was on the up
per end of a 7-5 tie breaker de
cision. Keil hit winner past an
attacking Moulton to tie it at
5-5, but the Card ended the set
by handcuffing Keil with one of
her trademark serves and a
strong forehand return off a
Keil serve.
Burgin, ranked first in the na
tion, got off to a very slow start
against Solomon. The Card
sophomore fell behind 5-1 and
dropped the fist set 6-3. Burgin
had trouble hitting overhead
smashes, but nevertheless
climbed to a 4-2 lead en route
to a 6-2 second set win.
Both players, especially dur
ing key points, opted for a
baseline game, with Burgin oc
casionally charging the net.
Burgin began the final set in
dramactic fashion by dropping
a half volley for a winner to
break Solomon's serve in the
first game. After each player
held serve once and broke
twice, Burgin held again,
fueled by a perfect topspin lob
to move ahead 5-3. The Card
finished off the Bruin with an
array of two fisted backhand
slices.
Ludloff was no match for
Kate Gompert's supreme

baseline game. Freshman
Gompert, playing in the third
slot, broke the Bruin's serve at
4-3 in the first set and never
looked back, eventually win
ning 6-3.
Linda Gates ran her individ
ual record to 10-1 by making
quick work of Bruin Lynn Lew
is, 6-1,6-3. Gates seemed to be
coasting mid-way through the
second set until she argued a
call and ultimately lost the
game, allowing Lewis pull
within one game. But she re
gained her composure and
held serve at 5-3, winning all
four points in the game.
At No. 5 singles, Michelle
Weiss defeated three-time Ail-
American Kathy O'Brien.
Weiss came back to win the
opening set 7-5 by breaking
O'Brein at 5-5.
The Card sophomore again
played catch-up tennis suc
cessfully, holding serve to
force a tie breaker. Tied at 4-4,
Weiss fired a backhand winner
down the line after a soft ap
proach shot. She then won the
match behind a strong first
serve.
Stanford also won No. 3
doubles, with Allison Hardy
and senior Sue Rasmussen
beating O'Brein-Keil 7-5,6-3.

day at the Varsity Courts.
The Card swept all six singles
matches, dropping only the no.
2 doubles spot. "I think ev
erybody played really well,"
said co ach Frank Brennan. "It
was just one of those days."
All the Card victories were in
straight sets. Only No. 2 singles
went the full three sets with
Elise Burgin beating UCLA's
Shelley Solomon 3-6,6-2,6-4.
Stanford's victory ensured it
a No. 1 seeding in next week's
NCAA championships at Salt
Lake City, Utah. UCLA should
be seeded second, USC third
and Trinity of Texas fourth. The
Card has now beaten the
Bruins twice this year.
Caryn Copeland set the tone
for Stanford by finishing off
Bruin Helena Mansetat the
sixth spot in less than an hour,
6-1, 6-1. "Caryn Copeland
played the best tennis I've seen
her play in three years," Bren
nan said.
Three hours after her straight
set victory, Copeland teamed
up with Aiycia Moulton to

down UCLA's Lynn Lewis-
Heather Ludloff No. 1 doubles
pair just as convicingly — 6-1,
6-4. Lewis-Ludloff sported a
16-1 record going into the
match and was thought of as
the best doubles team in the
nation.
At the top singles position,
Moulton disposed of Katherin
Keil 7-6 (7-5), 7-6 (7-5), Improv
ing her individual record to
12-2 as well as her chances for
the NCAA singles crown.
After jumping out to a first
set 3-0 lead, Moulton faltered
and Keil took five straight
games from the Cardinal sen
ior. Then Moulton held service
twice and broke Keil's once to
gain a 6-5 advantage. But again
the momentum shifted as Keil
captured the next four points
while holding serve.
Despite a pair of double
faults in the tie breaker,
Moulton hit a forehand
crosscourt winner and then
forced a Keil error for the first
set victory.
The second set was almost a
duplicate of the first. Down 5-3,
Moulton hit three straight
smashes to break Keil's serve
Moulton proceeded to hold, a'
the Bruin's efforts at ap
proaching the net were
thwarted by masterfully placed

passing shots.
After both players held,
Moulton again was on the up
per end of a 7-5 tie breaker de
cision. Keil hit winner past an
attacking Moulton to tie it at
5-5, but the Card ended the set
by handcuffing Keil with one of
her trademark serves and a
strong forehand return off a
Keil serve.
Burgin, ranked first in the na
tion, got off to a very slow start
against Solomon. The Card
sophomore fell behind 5-1 and
dropped the fist set 6-3. Burgin
had trouble hitting overhead
smashes, but nevertheless
climbed to a 4-2 lead en route
to a 6-2 second set win.
Both players, especially dur
ing key points, opted for a
baseline game, with Burgin oc
casionally charging the net.
Burgin began the final set in
dramactic fashion by dropping
a half volley for a winner to
break Solomon's serve in the
first game. After each player
held serve once and broke
twice, Burgin held again,
fueled by a perfect topspin lob
to move ahead 5-3. The Card
finished off the Bruin with an
array of two fisted backhand
slices.
Ludloff was no match for
Kate Gompert's supreme

baseline game. Freshman
Gompert, playing in the third
slot, broke the Bruin's serve at
4-3 in the first set and never
looked back, eventually win
ning 6-3.
Linda Gates ran her individ
ual record to 10-1 by making
quick work of Bruin Lynn Lew
is, 6-1,6-3. Gates seemed to be
coasting mid-way through the
second set until she argued a
call and ultimately lost the
game, allowing Lewis pull
within one game. But she re
gained her composure and
held serve at 5-3, winning all
four points in the game.
At No. 5 singles, Michelle
Weiss defeated three-time Ail-
American Kathy O'Brien.
Weiss came back to win the
opening set 7-5 by breaking
O'Brein at 5-5.
The Card sophomore again
played catch-up tennis suc
cessfully, holding serve to
force a tie breaker. Tied at 4-4,
Weiss fired a backhand winner
down the line after a soft ap
proach shot. She then won the
match behind a strong first
serve.
Stanford also won No. 3
doubles, with Allison Hardy
and senior Sue Rasmussen
beating O'Brein-Keil 7-5,6-3.
The No.l ranked women's
tennis team further widened
the gap between itself and No.
2 UCLA by completing a 16-0
undefeated season with a 8-1
thrashing of the Bruins Satur
