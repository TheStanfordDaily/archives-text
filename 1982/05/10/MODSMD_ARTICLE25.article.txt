# Men out of contention for NCAAs
## 
### Subtle Russet 
The Cardinal men's tennis
team fell to UC-Berke!ey 5-4
Wednesday at Cal, and the dif
ference between a win and a
loss was a matter of just one
point. But this point meant no
NCAA championship play for
Stanford this season.
The defending NCAA cham
pion Cardinal, which finished
the regular season 15-10 over
all, had a slim chance of making
the 16-team national tour
nament, if it could pull out a
victory over the Bears at home.

But while the dirty golden
quadrupeds played as if there
was something terribly impor
tant at stake, the Cardinal
played as if it were slumming,
taking only two-of-six singles
matches and thus putting itself
in the position of having to
sweep the doubles to win.
Cal prevented just that at No.
3 doubles, where Courtney
Benham and John Severly pre
vailed over Mark McKeen and
Jim Miller of Stanford in two
quiet sets 6-2,6-4. In defeating
McKeen and Miller, season

long underdogs who fought in
experience with scrap and
heart, Severly and Benham se
cured a spot for the Bears as the
last team in the NCAA tour
nament.
The Cardinal had won a con
vincing 6-3 match over Cal at
the varsity courts four weeks
ago, when McKeen and Miller
defeated Benham and Severly
4-6, 7-6 (7-3) 6-3. In addition,
the Cardinal had finished sec
ond while the Bears finished
last at the Pacific-10 Individuals
April 25 in Ojai. Thus, it was
more than a surprise when only
sophomore Scott Davis at No. 1
and senior Jeff Arons at No. 2
won their singles matches.
Davis defeated Randy Nixon
6-4,6-3, and Arons pulled out a
tough three-setter over Mark
Woolridge 6-7 (4-7), 6-4,6-2.
Stanford has struggled all
season to find a solid player at
the No. 2 position, where
sophomore McKeen and sen
ior Scott Bondurant have also
played intermittently. When
Arons came through for his
first victory at the spot, it
seemed to be just the combina
tion with Davis' win that the
Cardinal needed to defeat the
Bears.
But if Arons' win came where
one was least expected, so did
the losses. Bondurant and sen
ior John Corse were tripped up
at No. 3 and No. 4 respectively,
and it was just as much of a rari
ty as the win at No. 2. Bond
urant won his first set over Sev
erly 6-3 and was but two points
away from winning the match
in the second, only to let it go
by 5-7,3-6.
Corse struggled through a
first set worthy of epic poetry
with Harold Hecht, a junk
player with all kinds of shots,

only to lose it 6-7 in a grueling
8-10 tiebreaker. Hecht threw
everything but real garbage at
Corse in the second set and
finally just plain outsmarted
him 6-1 for the match.
Elsewhere in the Card line
up: at No. 5 McKeen rallied for
a 6-4 second set score after los
ing 0-6 in the first to Doug
Stone but the Bear put things
away in the third 6-3. At No. 6
freshman Paul Robinson fell to
Benham in straight sets 2-6,5-7.
Cal will go to the NCAA's as
the fourth team from the
Western region behind No. 1
ranked UCLA, No. 4 ranked
USC, and No. 3 ranked Pep
perdine. Cal was the last team
to be invited last year as well,
but responded by upsetting
Southern Methodist University.
Even after the loss to Cal,
which left the Cardinal with a
3-7 Pacific-10 conference rec
ord, Gould still harbored long
shot hopes for a berth in the
tournament. Although losses
to UCLA (7-2) and USC (5-4) at
home consideraby hurt its
chances, the Cardinal had a 5-4
upset of Pepperdine under its
belt, and a history of outstand
ing performances in the tour
nament. Stanford has taken
home the title six times in the
last nine years, and won 19 of 20
tournament matches over the
last five years.
"The thing that hurts is that
there will be teams in the tour
nament that we have beaten,"
said Gould.
The Cardinal will have its
representatives in Athens nev
ertheless. Davis will be there
competing for the singles title,
and he and Arons will also play
in the doubles tournament
along with the Card No. 2 team
Bondurant and Corse.

Benham and John Severly pre
vailed over Mark McKeen and
Jim Miller of Stanford in two
quiet sets 6-2,6-4. In defeating
McKeen and Miller, season

long underdogs who fought in
experience with scrap and
heart, Severly and Benham se
cured a spot for the Bears as the
last team in the NCAA tour
nament.
The Cardinal had won a con
vincing 6-3 match over Cal at
the varsity courts four weeks
ago, when McKeen and Miller
defeated Benham and Severly
4-6, 7-6 (7-3) 6-3. In addition,
the Cardinal had finished sec
ond while the Bears finished
last at the Pacific-10 Individuals
April 25 in Ojai. Thus, it was
more than a surprise when only
sophomore Scott Davis at No. 1
and senior Jeff Arons at No. 2
won their singles matches.
Davis defeated Randy Nixon
6-4,6-3, and Arons pulled out a
tough three-setter over Mark
Woolridge 6-7 (4-7), 6-4,6-2.
Stanford has struggled all
season to find a solid player at
the No. 2 position, where
sophomore McKeen and sen
ior Scott Bondurant have also
played intermittently. When
Arons came through for his
first victory at the spot, it
seemed to be just the combina
tion with Davis' win that the
Cardinal needed to defeat the
Bears.
But if Arons' win came where
one was least expected, so did
the losses. Bondurant and sen
ior John Corse were tripped up
at No. 3 and No. 4 respectively,
and it was just as much of a rari
ty as the win at No. 2. Bond
urant won his first set over Sev
erly 6-3 and was but two points
away from winning the match
in the second, only to let it go
by 5-7,3-6.
Corse struggled through a
first set worthy of epic poetry
with Harold Hecht, a junk
player with all kinds of shots,

only to lose it 6-7 in a grueling
8-10 tiebreaker. Hecht threw
everything but real garbage at
Corse in the second set and
finally just plain outsmarted
him 6-1 for the match.
Elsewhere in the Card line
up: at No. 5 McKeen rallied for
a 6-4 second set score after los
ing 0-6 in the first to Doug
Stone but the Bear put things
away in the third 6-3. At No. 6
freshman Paul Robinson fell to
Benham in straight sets 2-6,5-7.
Cal will go to the NCAA's as
the fourth team from the
Western region behind No. 1
ranked UCLA, No. 4 ranked
USC, and No. 3 ranked Pep
perdine. Cal was the last team
to be invited last year as well,
but responded by upsetting
Southern Methodist University.
Even after the loss to Cal,
which left the Cardinal with a
3-7 Pacific-10 conference rec
ord, Gould still harbored long
shot hopes for a berth in the
tournament. Although losses
to UCLA (7-2) and USC (5-4) at
home consideraby hurt its
chances, the Cardinal had a 5-4
upset of Pepperdine under its
belt, and a history of outstand
ing performances in the tour
nament. Stanford has taken
home the title six times in the
last nine years, and won 19 of 20
tournament matches over the
last five years.
"The thing that hurts is that
there will be teams in the tour
nament that we have beaten,"
said Gould.
The Cardinal will have its
representatives in Athens nev
ertheless. Davis will be there
competing for the singles title,
and he and Arons will also play
in the doubles tournament
along with the Card No. 2 team
Bondurant and Corse.

CORSES LAST STAND — Stanford's John Corse lost to Cals
Harold Hecht 7-6,6-1. Hecht's win was one of several Cal
upsets in its 5-4 victory over Stanford.
The Cardinal men's tennis
team fell to UC-Berke!ey 5-4
Wednesday at Cal, and the dif
ference between a win and a
loss was a matter of just one
point. But this point meant no
NCAA championship play for
Stanford this season.
The defending NCAA cham
pion Cardinal, which finished
the regular season 15-10 over
all, had a slim chance of making
the 16-team national tour
nament, if it could pull out a
victory over the Bears at home.

But while the dirty golden
quadrupeds played as if there
was something terribly impor
tant at stake, the Cardinal
played as if it were slumming,
taking only two-of-six singles
matches and thus putting itself
in the position of having to
sweep the doubles to win.
Cal prevented just that at No.
3 doubles, where Courtney
Benham and John Severly pre
vailed over Mark McKeen and
Jim Miller of Stanford in two
quiet sets 6-2,6-4. In defeating
McKeen and Miller, season

long underdogs who fought in
