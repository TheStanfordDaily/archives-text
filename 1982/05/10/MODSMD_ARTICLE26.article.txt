Nineteen teams from the
western United States and
scores of other participants and
spectators converged on Stan
ford's campus this weekend to
take part in the second annual
Mother's Day ULtimate Frisbee
Festival. Ultimate games were
just one element of the festival,
which included frisbee golf
competition, freestyle demon
strations, and a makeshift
"store" selling frisbees and ac
cessories.
Although rather strong
winds may have made play a bit
more challenging, they were
hardly a deterrent. At any one
time, there were eight separate
ultimate frisbee games in
progress on the intramural
fields behind Maples Pavilion
near El Camino Road.
A rather large crowd
watched the Bay Circus defeat
the San Diego Flo in the cham
pionship game on Sunday af
ternoon by a score of 21-10.
The two teams advanced to the
finals after semi-final victories
earlier that day. The San Diego
Flo defeated the Eugene Dark
Stars and the Bay Circus
eliminated Stanford. The
Circus-Stanford game repre
sented a rematch of last year's
finals in the Mother's Day tour
nament, in which the Circus
narrowly captured the title
over Stanford by one goal.
Host Stanford started the
weekend tournament with a
first round victory over the
Portland Fun Hogs on Saturday
morning. They went on to face
two different Santa Barbara
teams on Saturday afternoon,

with mixed results. First Stan
ford was upset by Santa
Barbara's second teams in a
match highlighted by Santa
Barbara's blanketing man-to
man defense. Stanford
bounced back, however, and
advanced to the semi-finals by
surprising Santa Barbara's top
rated first team to wrap up Sat
urday's action.
Stanford co-captain Brett
Foy stressed how well the team
played in this fast game. "The
team we beat," Foy said, "was a
team of real stars. This was
probably our best game of the
year."
Stanford's hopes of gaining a
berth in the championship
game were crushed due to
Sunday's semi-final loss. Ac
cording to Foy, "We just
couldn't get it together."
Among the 19 teams compet
ing, four were composed of all
women as they held their own
separate tournament. A rotat
ing pool pitted Stanford's new
ly-formed club team against
Santa Cruz, Humboldt, and
Dark Star in individual games
Saturday and Sunday. Dark Star
and the Santa Cruz Kaos
emerged as the top teams and
met in the women's cham
pionship. Kaos edged Dark Star
for the overall title.
Tournament rules usually
dictate that games be played to
a certain socre — 15 — in the
early rounds, then 17,19 and 21
for the playoffs. No clock is
necessary. In addition, ultimate
frisbee uses no referees; games
are played by the "honor" sys
tem, and, ideally, no calls are
contested.
The disc golf competition

was set on a very difficult and
heavily-wooded course laid
out by Stanford frisbee teach
er, Tom Mcßann. It featured
nine holes winding through
trees and other obstacles
around Stanford Stadium.
Among the more than 20 en
trants, David McMillan walked
away with the $25 first prize
with a two under par 25.
McMillan was followed by -a
five-way tie for secondp lace at
an even par 27.
Disc golf may be the most
popular individual frisbee ;
event. The play is extremely
similar to golf, even to the
point that players carry several
discs with them on the course,
because, as one player said,
"Different discs are good for
different shots." i
Although one of the volun
teers at the tournament
claimed that, "No one is in
charge," things seemed to run
rather smooth. An announcer
manning the public address
system periodically inter
rupted the taped rock music
that paced the action with
scores and announcements of
up-coming events.
The Second Annual Moth
er's Day Ultimate Festival pro
vided not only the best ul
timate frisbee on the West
Coast, but more importantly, a
setting for frisbee enthusiasts
to watch, teach, learn, eat,
drink, and just toss the disc
around. All agreed that not
only was Stanford a showcase
for great frisbee talent, this
weekend, but it served to rein
force and spread the popu
larity of one of America's
fastest growing pastimes.
