# Stanford challenge brings fitness, fun
## 
### Mark Zeigler 
Some midterm. As a require
ment for Jack Martin's Optimal
Health and Fitness class, the
students organized a two-day
program in tune with the
course's theme — "physical fit
ness is a multi-dimensional ac
tivity."
The first part of the program
was Thursday's health fair in
White Plaza, while the second
half was the Stanford
Challenge. Sundav morning at
Angel Field, Stanford affiliates
ana community members
played Bruce Jenner for a day
over a multi-event course that
included running, biking and
swimming. There were both in
dividual and three-man teams
(with each person doing two of
the six events) entries.
Participants began at Angel
Field at 11 a.m. with a half mile
run. Then they hopped on
bikes en route to tne Lake
Lagunita where the swimming
portion of the competition
took place. After swimming
around a bouy in the middle of
lake, those involved ran "The
Dish," a course more than four
miles long. Upon their return
to Lake Lag, participants com
peted in the so-called yacht
race — another escapade
around a bouy, only this time
sitting in an innertube. Finally,
after a second bike ride back to
Angel Field, competitors did an
obstacle course, including
push-up and sit-up stations as
well as a set of hurdles. Most
people finished about an hour
after they started, with the win
ning team completing the
challenge in 46 minutes. Six

minutes later the top individ
uals crossed the finish line.
The idea of the Stanford
Challenge was developed by
three students in Martin's class
last year. "The idea is not just
for tne elite, highly fit person to
do it," Martin said.
"Some of the events are very
difficult, some are very easy.
The Disn Loop run is the really
only hard event,"he con
tinued. "The person who is the
best runner will have an advan
tage."
The competive aspect of the
Challenge was downplayed,
according to Martin. "Its a very
minimal prize (for the win
ners)," he explained. "We are
not trying to emphasize the
winner so much. Everyone who
participates is a winner." All
finishers recieved a certificate
verifying their paricipation in
the event.
The Stanford Challenge also
attracted a few out of the or
dinary entries, including one
man who completed the
course in khaki and army
boots. Why? "For the hell of
it,"he said.
One team member who had
a tough time with the Dish
Loop run said, "It was tough,
but it was a hell of a time. A
few minutes later he was talk
ing about "next year."
Another individual com-
Eetitor lamented that he had
een beaten "by three girls."
