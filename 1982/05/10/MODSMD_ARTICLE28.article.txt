# Golfers fall short

### Mark Zeigler 
The men's golf team rose to
the occasion, but so did ev
eryone else. Needing a third
place finish in the Pac-10 cham
pionships at Corvallis, Oregon,
the Card shot probably its best
round all season — but so did
the other teams.
Stanford finished in fifth
place, with a four round 1,496
total, behind host Oregon
(1,454), USC (I,4so),jArizona
State (1,442) and winher UCLA
(1,416). Bruin Corey Pavin cap
tured the individual crown by
shattering the Pac-10 record
with an 11 under par 273.
Teammates Jay Delsing (280)
and Jeff Johnson (282) placed
second and third, respectively.
The Card fired a three over
par 358 in the fourth and final
round, a 71.6 stroke average.
However, Arizona State shot an
aggregate 351 and Oregon a
356. USC faded a bit over the
final 18 (365), but not enough
to fall behind Stanford. '
Ideally, the Card needed to

finish third behind USC and
UCLA, already guaranteed
NCAA championship berths by
virtue of their regular season
Rerformances. The Card still
as an outside chance at land
ing a NCAA spot, as the NCAA
tournament selection commit
tee could chose as many as five
Pac-10 schools. However, three
or four Pac-10 representatives
is more likely.
The women's team will par
ticipate in the third annual
Cardinal Club Celebrity Golf
Tournament which begins to
day at 12:30 p.m. Singer Dinah
Shore, Jim Plunkett and Joe
Montana head a field of 180
linksters and 36 teams.
The fund raising event will
benefit Stanfod's women's ath
letic scholarshipprogram.
Also p laying will be Oakland
Raider head coach Tom Flores
San Francisco 49ers Randy
Cross, Guy Benjamin and
Dwight Clark. Former Giants
star Willie McCovey, will also
be at the tee off as well.
