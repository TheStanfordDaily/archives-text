# Joan's head not enough as PJFs cheat way by Daily
## 
### Adam Berns 
* The heads up play of Daily
editor Joan O'Connell was
not enough to overcome
the dirty tactics of the Pro
fessional Journalism Fellows
in softball action Saturday
afternoon.
' After the controversal
contest which the PJFs won
15-14 (after all the beers, no
body on the Daily could re
member the exact score),
'the Daily squad promptly
Challenged the PJFs to
three-out-of-five, but the
old men chickened out.
O'Connell was the start
ing pitcher for the Daily but
soon got bombed — in both
senses — as the PJFs ex
ploded for nine early runs.
The mighty Daily team,
upholding the qualities of
spOrtmanship and fair play,
utilized its entire team — in
cluding women — while the
PJFs used primarily its male
members.
Perhaps the most blatant
example of the lengths the
PJFs were willing to go in or
nder to win involved knock
-1 jng O'Connell out of com
mission.
-n The incident occurred
with two outs in the bottom
of the ninth inning when
O'Connell was hit in the
head with a baseball while
running to first. Although
♦ co

she was safe, the Daily's best
baserunner was put out of
action.
Immediately following
this foul act, Don Willen
burg, a Daily editoral con
sultant and student at the
law school let out a howl. He
immediately demanded
either five runs or $500,000,
or legal action would be
taken. A couple of moments
later his rage subsided when
he was offered an editorial
position at the New York
Times. Left without legal
counsel, O'Connell, who
was still on her back, was
softly heard muttering,
"Maybe we should have en
dorsed legal counseling."
After a pinch runner went
in for O'Connell, Sam Howe
came to the plate. Howe,
who had been impressing
the spectators with his
sports knowledge, hit a
pitiful ground bali to the
shortstop and was easily
thrown out at first base. At
the games conclusion, in or
der to save face, Howe tried
to bribe certain Daily edi
tors to print that the Daily
won the game 15-0 to es
cape criticism from the
press.
There were many spec
tacular plays in Saturday's
game — most of them by
members of the Daily

squad.
"One particular play
stood out in my mind as par
ticularly noteworthy," said
Daily staffer Bill Beyda. "It
was that outstanding snag of
a line drive by the second
baseman in the eighth in
ning. The catch was truly
phenomenal."
Beyda played second base
in the eighth inning.
One major problem that
the Daily nad to deal with
were its sexually precocious
female members who came
back early Saturday morn
ing from a wild rampage
through San Francisco.
O'Connell was led by this
sex-starved crew to a male
strip joint. Decorum pre
vents details of the ex
cursion to be releasted, but
photo editor Jae So and
copy editor Sally Newman
were reported to have been
especially decadent. Need
less to say the women were
not in top playing form.
The PJFs utilized their
women in an entirely dif
ferent fashion. In fact, they
all played the same position
— left out. As the old men
huffed and puffed, trying to
recapture their lost youth,
the women relaxed in the
sun and drank beer and
soda.
