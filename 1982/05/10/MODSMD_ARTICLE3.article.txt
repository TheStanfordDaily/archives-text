# Rally protests Reaganomics
## News 
### David Azrin 
More than 2,500 people gathered
last weekend in the area adjacent to
Hoover Tower to protest the Reagan
administration's policies by drawing
a parallel between the economic
conditions of the Depression era and
the economic conditions of today.
The demonstration, called Hoo
verville '32/Reaganville '82, drew
protesters from all over California
and received national media cov
erage.
The weekend activities began Fri
day morning with the construction of
a temporary shantytown near the
tower and culminated on Saturday
with a full program of protest ac
tivities.
More than 100 people slept in a
field near the tower Friday night in
about twenty shanties made of wood
and cardboard, recreating the "Hoo
vervilles" of the 1930's which sprung
up during the Great Depression as
millions of unemployed workers
roamed the country looking for
work.
Organizers also set-up a soup line
in the field Friday night while some
walked around in rags Saturday to
emphasize the parallels with the De
pression era.
Saturday's activities included
speeches by union leaders, anti-draft
spokespersons, minority leaders and
nuclear freeze advocates, protest
songs by folk singers, satirical comic
performances and political dis
cussion workshops. Speakers
criticized the Reagan adminis
tration's cut-backs in social programs
and the increase in military spending.

Berkeley Mayor Gus Newport said
at a discussion workshop, "We have
to redistribute our resources away
from Reagan's military program.
Rather than putting money to buy
goods to kill and maim people, we
should redistribute money to the
people for human services and pro
grams."
Some speakers predicted more vi
olent protests in the future if Rea
gan's domestic and foreign policies
are continued.
"There is not going to be peace in
the 80's," said Rev. Cecil Williams of
the Glide Memorial Church. "I have
talked to people in the ghettos who
said, 'we are engaged in violence be
cause we have nothing to eat, no
where to live, no money, and no
where to work. The fire we saw in the
60's will now become an inferno in
the 80's."
Peter Servantes-Gautschi of the
Santa Clara Labor Council said that
Reagan's policies are creating the
highest unemployment rates since
the Depression era.
"We have lost over 10,000 jobs due
to plant closures here and our
brothers and sisters in the building
and trade industriesareexperiencing
a 30 perpent rate of unemployment,"
Gautrschi said. "You cannot take
away the people's jobs, their shelter,
and their subsistence and at the same
time talk about spending trillions of
dollars on a non-job producing,
highly expensive arms build up."
"Crime is going to be more and
more of a problem as people cannot
get food for their families," he said.

According to Elizabeth Stanley, a
union spokesperson displaced by the
General Motors plant closure in Fre
mont, unemployment is creating
growing opposition to the Reagan
administration among workers.
"There is a large amount of anger
being generated by these shutdowns
and the Reagan admistration attitude
toward these closings," Stanley said.
"They say its ok because it's all in the
name of profits and free enterprise.
But they don't say that when it comes
to giving tax deductions to corpo
rations. There is a real double stan
dard going on here."
Charlotte Suskind of the Grey
Panthers lambasted the Reagan ad
ministration's decision to cut child
care programs, nutrition programs,
school lunches, Medi-Cal, college
benefits, the CETA jobs program and
social security, which she said will
have a particularly detrimental effect
on young families.
Suskind mimicked the Reagan ad
ministration sarcastically, "Oh yes,
indeed. Happy Mother's Day, young
mothers."
Dave McFadden of the State
Bilateral Freeze Committee also
noted the ill-effects Reagan's in
creased military spending may have
on the domestic economy.
McFadden said that military spend
ing helps create high interest rates,
high inflation, large budget deficits
and unemployment. The final result
of this spending will be either eco
nomic collapse or war, he said.

PUTTING UP THE SHANTIES — Various people began setting up for
Hoovemlle as early as Friday by building shanties reminiscent of the
Hoovervilles of the 1930'5. Here several people are setting up one
such novel in front of Hoover tower, besides which many of the later
activities of the Hooverville '32/Reaganville '82 rally toon place.
Speakers criticized U.S. military
spending not only for the effect it
may have on the domestic economy,
but also for the support it provides to
repressive governments around the
world.
Rosa Rivera, co-founder of the El
Salvador Teacher's Union, was highly
critical of the Reagan adminstra
tion's military aid to El Salvador.
"I can't tell you what it is like when
they take your children away in the
middle of the night, when they kill
them, when they decapitate them
without any reason," Rivera said,
speaking through a translator.
"There is no such thing as human
rights in El Salvador."
"This is a government who as
sasinates teachers for teaching the
truth, who assasinates children, who
assasinated Archbishop Romero
while he was in the act of consecra
tion," she continued.
"My friends, your tax dollars
should not be going to kill people, to
oppress people. You should keep
those dollars here to continue the
progress in social programs that you
have worked for," Rivera said.
At one point in the speeches,
members of the Women's Action
group climbed up on the base of the
tower and hung a 50 foot banner that
read "PH A LLOCENTR ISM/MALE
DOMINANCE/MILITARISM " across
the face of the tower.

tower and culminated on Saturday
with a full program of protest ac
tivities.
More than 100 people slept in a
field near the tower Friday night in
about twenty shanties made of wood
and cardboard, recreating the "Hoo
vervilles" of the 1930's which sprung
up during the Great Depression as
millions of unemployed workers
roamed the country looking for
work.
Organizers also set-up a soup line
in the field Friday night while some
walked around in rags Saturday to
emphasize the parallels with the De
pression era.
Saturday's activities included
speeches by union leaders, anti-draft
spokespersons, minority leaders and
nuclear freeze advocates, protest
songs by folk singers, satirical comic
performances and political dis
cussion workshops. Speakers
criticized the Reagan adminis
tration's cut-backs in social programs
and the increase in military spending.

Berkeley Mayor Gus Newport said
at a discussion workshop, "We have
to redistribute our resources away
from Reagan's military program.
Rather than putting money to buy
goods to kill and maim people, we
should redistribute money to the
people for human services and pro
grams."
Some speakers predicted more vi
olent protests in the future if Rea
gan's domestic and foreign policies
are continued.
"There is not going to be peace in
the 80's," said Rev. Cecil Williams of
the Glide Memorial Church. "I have
talked to people in the ghettos who
said, 'we are engaged in violence be
cause we have nothing to eat, no
where to live, no money, and no
where to work. The fire we saw in the
60's will now become an inferno in
the 80's."
Peter Servantes-Gautschi of the
Santa Clara Labor Council said that
Reagan's policies are creating the
highest unemployment rates since
the Depression era.
"We have lost over 10,000 jobs due
to plant closures here and our
brothers and sisters in the building
and trade industriesareexperiencing
a 30 perpent rate of unemployment,"
Gautrschi said. "You cannot take
away the people's jobs, their shelter,
and their subsistence and at the same
time talk about spending trillions of
dollars on a non-job producing,
highly expensive arms build up."
"Crime is going to be more and
more of a problem as people cannot
get food for their families," he said.

According to Elizabeth Stanley, a
union spokesperson displaced by the
General Motors plant closure in Fre
mont, unemployment is creating
growing opposition to the Reagan
administration among workers.
"There is a large amount of anger
being generated by these shutdowns
and the Reagan admistration attitude
toward these closings," Stanley said.
"They say its ok because it's all in the
name of profits and free enterprise.
But they don't say that when it comes
to giving tax deductions to corpo
rations. There is a real double stan
dard going on here."
Charlotte Suskind of the Grey
Panthers lambasted the Reagan ad
ministration's decision to cut child
care programs, nutrition programs,
school lunches, Medi-Cal, college
benefits, the CETA jobs program and
social security, which she said will
have a particularly detrimental effect
on young families.
Suskind mimicked the Reagan ad
ministration sarcastically, "Oh yes,
indeed. Happy Mother's Day, young
mothers."
Dave McFadden of the State
Bilateral Freeze Committee also
noted the ill-effects Reagan's in
creased military spending may have
on the domestic economy.
McFadden said that military spend
ing helps create high interest rates,
high inflation, large budget deficits
and unemployment. The final result
of this spending will be either eco
nomic collapse or war, he said.

PUTTING UP THE SHANTIES — Various people began setting up for
Hoovemlle as early as Friday by building shanties reminiscent of the
Hoovervilles of the 1930'5. Here several people are setting up one
such novel in front of Hoover tower, besides which many of the later
activities of the Hooverville '32/Reaganville '82 rally toon place.
Speakers criticized U.S. military
spending not only for the effect it
may have on the domestic economy,
but also for the support it provides to
repressive governments around the
world.
Rosa Rivera, co-founder of the El
Salvador Teacher's Union, was highly
critical of the Reagan adminstra
tion's military aid to El Salvador.
"I can't tell you what it is like when
they take your children away in the
middle of the night, when they kill
them, when they decapitate them
without any reason," Rivera said,
speaking through a translator.
"There is no such thing as human
rights in El Salvador."
"This is a government who as
sasinates teachers for teaching the
truth, who assasinates children, who
assasinated Archbishop Romero
while he was in the act of consecra
tion," she continued.
"My friends, your tax dollars
should not be going to kill people, to
oppress people. You should keep
those dollars here to continue the
progress in social programs that you
have worked for," Rivera said.
At one point in the speeches,
members of the Women's Action
group climbed up on the base of the
tower and hung a 50 foot banner that
read "PH A LLOCENTR ISM/MALE
DOMINANCE/MILITARISM " across
the face of the tower.

More than 2,500 people gathered

administration's policies by drawing
