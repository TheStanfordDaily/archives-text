## Hockey violence is still a problem 
### 
Yes California, there is
professional ice hockey.
What's that you say? It's
absurd to talk about the Na
tional Hockey League when
the thermometer is soaring
toward 90 degres, the
baseball season is through
its first month and even the
National Basketball Associa
tion playoffs are well under
way. My point exactly. As
the New York Islanders
march to their third con
secutive Stanley Cup title,
the NHL continues to take
one more step into the
black holes of "The Sporting
Green."
The lack of West Coast
media coverage given the
Stanley Cup stems partly
from obvious regional dif
ferences, but more so be
cause of the greed and mis
management of NHL, an or
ganization that combines
some of the worst qualities
of all professional sports.
The Stanley Cup playoffs,
traditionally a widely cov
ered championship, have
been transformed into a
boring, second-rate, mara
thon struggle. After rigging
a lengthy 80 game season,
the league's wise men de
emed it necessary to include
16 of 21 teams in the cham
pionship rounds, primarily
to pad their wallets with ex
tra playoff revenue. Predic
tably, the results are some
thing to yawn at; in the Cup
finals the Islanders will face
either Vancouver or Chica
go, both winners of 30 of 80
during the regular season,
while the playoffs drag on
into May.
Not only does the sea
son's length make the sport
less interesting, but ex
pansion, to maximize profit,
threatens the league's
credibility. Case in point is
the newest franchise, the
Colorado Rockies. The
Rockies produce less excite
ment on the ice than they
do regarding speculation as
to their future home. While
the Rockies floundered this
past season, Wayne Gretzky
was flying into the NHL rec
' ord books. However, he did
so by shooting holes in in
creasingly porous defenses,
the result of spreading only
so much talent across 21
rosters. To create a more
competitive format and
higher caliber party, the
NHL ought to consider
merging weak franchises
like Colorado, Washington

and Los Angeles (no one
ever frets leaving L.A.),
among others.
Unfortunately, the NHL
hierarchy seems to believe
that the cure-all for its woes
lies in society's taste for vio
lence. Much of the blame
for this narrow-minded pol
icy goes to Commissioner
Larry Zeigler, a take charge
leader who makes Bowie
Kuhn look like Benito
Mussolini. Although the
league stiffened penalties
for bench-clearing brawls, it
still sees one-on-one com
bat as a ticket seller.
Back in December, Phil
ly's Paul Holmgren pum
meled a referee and was
wrist-slapped by Ziegler
with a five game suspension
and a whopping $500 fine.
That's truly more of an in
centive to get a few days off
than a deterrent against
decking a referee. Baseball's
Bill Madlock received a sim
ilar penalty a few years ago
for just brushing an ump's
nose with his glove.
Also earlier this year, Los
Angeles' Paul Mulvey was
sent packing by the Kings
when he refused his coach's
order to enter a brawl. As
usual the league failed to act
convincingly to discourage
the irresponsible behavior
of Kings coach Don Perry.
The league often argues
that violence is part of the
game, that fights are in
herent in such a fast and
physical sport. Such reason
ing holds little weight if one
considers pro football, a
fairly physical sport, and the
limited altercations that re
sult with the NFL's strict
guidelines. By condoning
the senseless combat,
Zeigler and Co. only tarnish
hockey's public image and
create a sport that looks
more like professional
wrestling each day.
A true hockey fan knows
that the sport is as exciting as
any other when a Wayne
Gretzky or a Guy Lafleu'r is
let loose against the best
competition in a clean, un
interruppted game. But as
things stand, it is quite un
derstandable that the
Stanley Cup playoffs wlil go
largely unnoticed. Unless
the NHL realizes that quality
athletes earns the respect of
the fans and the media, the
next few years may see more
people ignoring the endless
and senseless NHL season,
leaving hockey even less
space in the morning news
paper.
