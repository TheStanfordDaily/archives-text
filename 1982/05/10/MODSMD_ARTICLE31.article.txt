# Protest against abortion amendment begins
## 
### Kathy Christie 
A number of Bay Area groups led
by Planned Parenthood have
launched a letter-writing campaign
to Congressional leaders in the
hopes of heading off the proposed
Hatch amendment.
The amendment, which would
give states the right to decide wheth
er abortions are legal or not, would
negate the 1973 U.S. Supreme Court
decision legalizing abortion.
Gail Kaufman of the San Francisco
Office of the Committee to Defend
Reproductive Rights, said that the
letter-writing campaign has been
"very successful. According to
Kaufman, letters are primarily being
sent to Senators S.I. Hayakawa and
Alan Cranston, and Cranston has

been especially responsive.
"Sen. Cranston's office has gone
from predominantly anti-choice to
overwhelmingly pro-choice," said
Kaufman, adding that "Cranston has
gone to working actively against the
Hatch amendment."
Groups are opposing the amend
ment, according to Pat Colby, ex
ecutive director of Planned Parent
hood in San Mateo County, because
they want to insure that women will
always be free to have abortions.
"We're working to preserve freedom
of choice," she said.
"We believe that the moral
judgement should be made by the
person, not the government," said
Nan Bostick of tne Bay Area Pro-
Choice Coalition. "We live in a plu
ralistic country ... we have a demo

cratic principle at stake."
Bostick said that since both sides
are so polarized on the issue some
legislators won't touch it "with a ten
foot pole." She attributed Cranston's
strong stand to the fact that the pro
choice issue is the "number two issue
that he's getting letters on."
"The Hatch version of the Human
Rights Amendment looks like bills by
Mark Hatfield and Jesse Helms," said
Kaufman, adding that Hatfield's bill
attempts to deal with the litigation is
sues of abortion and Helms regards
the fetus as a human from concep
tion.
These bills should concern pro
choicers, Kaufman said because of an
attempt to add them on to the federal

budget appropriation. "The Senate
might go along with them for fear
that the federal budget that they've
been working on for months might
not go through,"she said.
Ann Benner, a staff member from
Congressman Tom Lantos' office,
said that Lantos is opposed to the
Hatch Amendment. "He believes
that constitutional amendments are
not a good way to run the govern
ment,"she said.
Besides letter-writing, Kaufman
said that a number of groups in the
Bay Area calling themselves Emer
gency Action are planning a rally to
be held at U.N. Plaza in San Francisco
when the amendment is considered
by the Senate.
