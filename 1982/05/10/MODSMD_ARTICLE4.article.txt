# Chairman of EE dept. criticizes visa bill
## 
### 
by Fred Shapiro and Jonathan
Greene
A bill which would make it more
difficult for foreign students to work
in this country after graduating has
drawn sharp criticism from the chair
man of the Electrical Engineering de
partment here.
The bill was recently approved by
the U.S. Senate Subcommittee on
Immigration and is scheduled for dis
cussion on the Senate floor on May
24.
Prof. Robert White, chairman of
the electrical engineering depart
ment, termed the provisions of the
bill affecting students "positively lu
dicrous" in a letter to Senator Alan
Simpson (R-Wyo.), co-sponsor of the
bill.
White noted that approximately 20
percent of the master's candidates
and about half of the doctoral can
didates in his department are for
eign.
"Foreign students are frequently
our top students since the admission
criteria are higher," White told the
Daily. Those who choose to take jobs
here are "serving to reduce a press
ing talent shortage" in American in
dustry.
The part of the Simpson-Mazzoli
Bill that affects foreign students is
Section 212, which would require

foreign nationals with student visas
(type F or M) to return home for a pe
riod of two years before they are
eligible to apply for an immigrant
visa, permanent residence or a non
immigrant visa (type H or L). This pro
vision would apply only to those ad
mitted to the U.S. after enactment of
the bill.
However, another provision of the
section would bar even students al
ready admitted under type F or M vi
sas from adjusting their status to per
manent resident while in the U.S.
They would have to "depart and app
ly abroad," according to Maurice
Roberts, of the American Council for
Nationalities Service in Washington.
"I didn't expect to stay here when I
came out," a former graduate stu
dent in chemical engineering said.
"But there are no jobs in England in
my field .. . unemployment has
doubled since I came here." He now
works at a Sunnyvale firm which per
forms contract work for the Depart
ment of Energy.
"Making it harder for people to
stay here legally will just encourage
illegal immigration," the student
said, noting that marriages of conve
nience are often used to circumvent
restrictions.
The requirement of a two-year
wait is similar to current restrictions

on certain exchange-visitor (type J)
visas, except that the usual pro
cedure for waiver of the restriction
would not apply.
No important changes to Section
212 were made by the subcommittee,
according to Roberts. The bill has yet
to pass either house of Congress.
Cemal Dincer, a doctoral can
didate in industrial engineering from
Turkey, is not worried about the bill.
He thought most students return
home, because of "cultural dif
ferences, friends overseas and fami
lies," and did not think the bill would
discourage students from applying
here.
"I'm planning to go home — but I
don't like restrictions/' Dincer said.
"Most students seek a job (here) for
training and experience," he said,
since jobs in their high technology
fields may not be available at home.
The bill was motivated, according
to Roberts, by the "problem of un
documented aliens taking jobs away
from Americans."
Responding to arguments that for
eign graduates depress wages, White
stated in his letter that "I know of no
evidence of a foreign student accept
ing, or even being offered, a position
at less than market salary."
White was disturbed that "the
hearings were conducted without
major constituents being repre-

sented" and "were basically secret."
He referred to Section 212 as a
"buried paragraph" in the 78-page
bill.
"I would be amazed if the Univer
sity takes no action," White said.
Stanford "will make our views
known" to Congress, President
Donald Kennedy said, but added that
i lobbying effort is now focused on
other legislation affecting the Uni
versity, notably the Small Business In
novation Development Act.
Referring to the large number of
pending bills which may affect the
University, Kennedy said "It's a prob
lem when things like this come from
unexpected quarters. . . particularly,
I think this is the result of having an
inexperienced Congress."
"I can't imagine it will have a signif
icant effect on Stanford," Dean of the
School of Engineering William Kays
said. "It is a problem for industry
more than for us."
Kays added that "The number of
Ph.Ds has decreased almost to the
disaster point."
Industries that hire foreign gradu
ates are gearing up to fight the bill.
The American Electronics Associa
tion is on "red alert" and the Institute
of Electrical and Electronics Engi
neers, a professional organization,
will issue a position paper today.

A bill which would make it more
difficult for foreign students to work
in this country after graduating has
drawn sharp criticism from the chair
man of the Electrical Engineering de
partment here.
The bill was recently approved by
the U.S. Senate Subcommittee on
Immigration and is scheduled for dis
cussion on the Senate floor on May
24.
Prof. Robert White, chairman of
the electrical engineering depart
ment, termed the provisions of the
bill affecting students "positively lu
dicrous" in a letter to Senator Alan
Simpson (R-Wyo.), co-sponsor of the
bill.
White noted that approximately 20
percent of the master's candidates
and about half of the doctoral can
didates in his department are for
eign.
"Foreign students are frequently
our top students since the admission
criteria are higher," White told the
Daily. Those who choose to take jobs
here are "serving to reduce a press
ing talent shortage" in American in
dustry.
The part of the Simpson-Mazzoli
Bill that affects foreign students is
Section 212, which would require

foreign nationals with student visas
(type F or M) to return home for a pe
riod of two years before they are
eligible to apply for an immigrant
visa, permanent residence or a non
immigrant visa (type H or L). This pro
vision would apply only to those ad
mitted to the U.S. after enactment of
the bill.
However, another provision of the
section would bar even students al
ready admitted under type F or M vi
sas from adjusting their status to per
manent resident while in the U.S.
They would have to "depart and app
ly abroad," according to Maurice
Roberts, of the American Council for
Nationalities Service in Washington.
"I didn't expect to stay here when I
came out," a former graduate stu
dent in chemical engineering said.
"But there are no jobs in England in
my field .. . unemployment has
doubled since I came here." He now
works at a Sunnyvale firm which per
forms contract work for the Depart
ment of Energy.
"Making it harder for people to
stay here legally will just encourage
illegal immigration," the student
said, noting that marriages of conve
nience are often used to circumvent
restrictions.
The requirement of a two-year
wait is similar to current restrictions

on certain exchange-visitor (type J)
visas, except that the usual pro
cedure for waiver of the restriction
would not apply.
No important changes to Section
212 were made by the subcommittee,
according to Roberts. The bill has yet
to pass either house of Congress.
Cemal Dincer, a doctoral can
didate in industrial engineering from
Turkey, is not worried about the bill.
He thought most students return
home, because of "cultural dif
ferences, friends overseas and fami
lies," and did not think the bill would
discourage students from applying
