# Panel discusses misperceptions in relations between US, Soviets
## 
### Steve Trousdale 
While agreeing that mispercep
tions exist between the U.S. and the
Soviet Union, experts on Soviet-
American relations offered differing
views on the source of these mis
perceptions and their impact on the
relationship last Friday.
The panel discussion, led by His
tory Prof. Alexander Dallin, who
heads the International Relations
program, addressed the topic
"Mutual Perceptions and Mis
perceptions in U.S.-Soviet Rela
tions."
The other panelists included Prof.
Alexander George of the political sci
ence department, Professor Morton
Schwartz of U.C.-Riverside, Dimitri
Simes, a visiting professor at U.C.-
Berkeley this quarter and head of the
Russian Institute of the School for
Advanced International Studies
(SAIS) at John Hopkins University,
Prof. Robert Tucker of Princeton
University and Associate Prof. Gail
Lepidus, chairperson of the Slavic
Center at U.C.-Berkeley.
Dallin said the purpose of the con
ference was to compare the way in
which one set of observers sees and
misperceives the other, saying that
"perceptions are more important
than the reality."
Schwartz said that there are two
views of U.S. policies in Russia; one
perceives the U.S. as an aggressive
nation while the other holds a more
benign judgement of this country's
actions.
Tucker said that, given the Soviet's
benign self-view, any action one's
opponent takes is viewed as ag
gressive.
Simes, a Russian emigre, discussed
the various changes in Soviet policy

in the 1970'5. He said that these alter
ations had affected the view of the
U.S. held by Russian policymakers.
In describing the Nixon and
Brezhnev eras, Simes said that both
sides misperceived the interests of
the U.S. and the Soviet interests as
overlapping. Now Simes said that the
two countries are moving in different
directions and that "they just hap
pened to be at this point at this time."
Schwnrtz said that Soviet policies
are most affected by the views o ( the

United States held by the Russian
leaders themselves.
Tucker discussed a psychodynamic
model of perception, saying that
people have a fundamental wish to
see their own desires in a good light.
However, he said that this benign
self-perception can "bedevil" the
view of the actions of one side by the
other.
George, the first to speak, said that
"there are genuine conflicts of in

terest" between the two countries
and not just misperceptions about
these interests.
Discussing cases in which the Sovi
et Union sent signals to the United
States which were misperceived on
the receiving end, George said, "So
viet signalling seems so damned sub
tle."
Lepidus discussed how American
experts often shape discussions in
Soviet policy centers, and the nature
of U.S. policy as seen by the Soviet
Union. She disagreed with other

panelists' views about the nature of
the Soviet leadership, arguing that it
is not as hawkish as supposed and
that many people had been expelled
from it who were more hawkisn than
Brezhnev.
However, one observer of the de
bate said that these so-called hawks
were removed because of their ambi
tions for Brezhnev's job and not their
hawkishness.
