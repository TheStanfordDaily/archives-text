# Inside: Concerts here have a controversial history

### Steve Trousdale 
Though within the last few years
there has been plenty of talk
about large, big-name rock con
certs coming back to Stanford, the
actual results of all the discussion
have certainly not been substan
tial. Elton John, the Grateful Dead,
Pablo Cruise, the Doobie
Brothers, Linda Ronstadt, Kenny
Loggins, George Benson and Jim
my Buffett have all been men
tioned as possibilities. They may
make for an impressive line-up,
but none have yet shown up. The
real question is whether any big
name performer will ever again
perform here. This week Daily
staffers Adam Goodman and
Steve Trousdale take a look at the
concert situation on campus —
from the ups and downs of the
now defunct ASSU Special Events
to the predictions and possibilities
for the future. In between will be a
close-up view of concerts from
the perspectives of University of

such as Bill Graham as well as a
comparative analysis of the con
cert scene at other area univer
sities. Today: The history of stu

last performance by a major band
was the Jefferson Starship concert

groups to campus once again.
Earlier last year the Student-
Alumni Network (STAN) at
tempted to bring Pablo Cruise
here for a concert; the proposal
was approved over the summer
and an October concert date was
set. However, due to circum
stances beyond anyone's control

— the band's drummer broke his
hand — the concert had to be can
celled.
More recently two student or
ganizations, the leland Stanford
Junior University Marching Band
(LSJUMB) and the Chaparral mag
azine, have been trying to stage a
major concert here.
The LSJUMB attempted to bring
Elton John here in late June; how
