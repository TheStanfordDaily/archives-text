# Inside: Concerts here have a controversial history
## 
### Steve Trousdale 
Though within the last few years
there has been plenty of talk
about large, big-name rock con
certs coming back to Stanford, the
actual results of all the discussion
have certainly not been substan
tial. Elton John, the Grateful Dead,
Pablo Cruise, the Doobie
Brothers, Linda Ronstadt, Kenny
Loggins, George Benson and Jim
my Buffett have all been men
tioned as possibilities. They may
make for an impressive line-up,
but none have yet shown up. The
real question is whether any big
name performer will ever again
perform here. This week Daily
staffers Adam Goodman and
Steve Trousdale take a look at the
concert situation on campus —
from the ups and downs of the
now defunct ASSU Special Events
to the predictions and possibilities
for the future. In between will be a
close-up view of concerts from
the perspectives of University of
ficials and professional promoters
such as Bill Graham as well as a
comparative analysis of the con
cert scene at other area univer
sities. Today: The history of stu
dent-run concerts.
Even the oldest students on
campus have only vague memo
ries of concerts at Stanford. The
last performance by a major band
was the Jefferson Starship concert
of two years ago. Recently, how
ever, there have been attempts by

various student groups here to
bring big-name pop and rock
groups to campus once again.
Earlier last year the Student-
Alumni Network (STAN) at
tempted to bring Pablo Cruise
here for a concert; the proposal
was approved over the summer
and an October concert date was
set. However, due to circum
stances beyond anyone's control

— the band's drummer broke his
hand — the concert had to be can
celled.
More recently two student or
ganizations, the leland Stanford
Junior University Marching Band
(LSJUMB) and the Chaparral mag
azine, have been trying to stage a
major concert here.
The LSJUMB attempted to bring
Elton John here in late June; how
ever, according to Vicky Holt, di
rector of University Events and
Services, he"isdefinitely not com
ing here." John Howard, the
LSJUMB manager, said that since it
has already received approval to
sponsor a concert on June 27 the
LSJUMB will look for another per
former.
However, he said that "no artist
of significant importance" will be
in the Bay Area at that time. Thus,
he commented that if no other ar
tist can be found the LSJUMB will
wait until next year to put on a
concert.
The reason John could not ap
pear here was due to a change
made in the middle of his tour that
necessitated having to move all of
the singer's shows indoors, ac
cording to Howard; Frost Am
phitheatre, which would have
been used for his concert here, is
an outdoor arena.
The Chaparral is also attempting
to bring a group to campus; ac
cording to Holt, the humor maga
zine's proposal has been "ap
proved ... Tor concert produc
tion." According to recent reports
in the Daily, the Chaparral has
been trying to bring the Grateful
Dead here. Holt refused to con
firm or deny this, and Thorn
Massey, an associate dean h«ire,
also declined comment on the sta
tus of negotiations with the Dead,

LSjUMB were presented to the
COCE Concert Committee.
According to Holt, there are
three steps any campus group
must take in any attempt to co
sponsor a concert here — first, the
COCE must approve the organiza
tion and its plan for a concert. Sec
ondly, the group must receive ap
proval for the specific performer

$92,000 loss in 1979-80. Because of
this tremendous drain on ASSU
resources, the operation was
ended, and the ASSU Task Force
on Contemporary Entertainment
was initiated to investigate the
failure of what had once been the
ASSU's biggest money maker.
According to the report pub
lished by the task force, there
were several problems that con
tributed to the tremendous losses
experienced by the organization.
Among these were a poor rela
tionship between the Special
Events project director and the
ASSU student financial manager, a
lack of continuity from year to
year for project members and a
pay scale that rewarded quantity
6f concerts put on instead of how
successful each one was.
The report also cited problems
caused by the relative inex
perience of the organization's
members which included over
bidding and underbudgetting on
concerts, lack of negotiating abili
ty and lack of a permanent system
of recordkeeping.
In summary, the report says of
the problems, "interviews with
the representatives of each de
partment, past project managers,
and past financial managers reveal
many miscommunications, non
communications and poor inten
tions."
Following the recommenda
tions of the task force, campus
groups putting on concerts now

moters, usually Bill Graham Pres
ents, often working with Scher as a
liason.
However, there have been
problems in the past with the
Graham organization. Cynthia

requested, and finally, the COCE
must approve the group's plans,
for implementing the concert.
The ISfUMB had passed the first
and second steps before finding
out that John had scheduling con
flicts; the Chaparral has passed
the first step so far.
The Campus Entertainment
Eloard (CEB) is an ASSU organiza
tion with the purpose of providing
free entertainment for students,
according to Director Todd
Ackerman. Ackerman said that
the board wants to put on major
concerts next year, the receipts of
which would then be used to raise
money for other free events.
Before the creation of these two
boards concerts here were, for the
most part, organized by an ASSU
board called Special Events. In
contrast to the CEB and the stu
dent groups approved by the
COCE, which intend to work with
outside promoters on major con
certs, at one time Special Events
promoted its own concerts.
Although the organization lost
money in earlier years (it went
$25,000 in the red in 1972-73), un
der the directorship of then Grad
uate School of Business student
Danny Scher, Special Events made
money — $55,000 in 1973-74 and
over $50,000 in 1974-75 (Scher is
presently a vice-president for Bill
Graham Presents).
However, in later years the or
ganization once again began to
lose monev, culminating in a

University's
Committee on
Contemporary
Entertainment
(COCE), overseeing
the Co n cert
Committee, which
"approves proposals
for concerts" by any
campus group and
also advises students
trying to produce
concerts here....

Mathewson, a member ot the
COCE and the present student fi
nancial manager, said that on one
instance Graham scheduled a
concert in Berkeley simultane
ously with a concert here. She also
said that Graham's agency could
not be used for all types of music;

for instance, blue grass musicians
refuse to work with him, she said.
When Special Events still ex
isted, relations with Graham were
somewhat rockier. According to a
Daily article on Feb. 21, 1978,
Graham's "domination" of con
cert promotion in the Bay Area
was considered the biggest prob
lem facing Special Events. Mark
Curtis, then director of Special
Events, was quoted as saying that
"Graham hates it when Stanford
gets a show."
Mark Epstein, newly-elected
Council of Presidents member
and also a member of both the
COCE and the CEB, was even
more direct. He said that Special
Events irritated "the shit out of
him (Graham)." He said that the
ASSIi is not planning to promote
concerts independently but
would instead co-promote with
outside promoters; however, he
said that "when you co-prdnnote
you have to co-promote with peo
ple with less than acceptable busi
ness practices."
According to Epstein, the COCE
was created to protect students
from these practices. However,
Holt, who writes the performance
contracts and negotiates all cam
pus concerts, said that whenever
Bill Graham Presents is the co
promoter, the University operates
under a no-risk agreement, there
by avoiding up front financial
guarantees.
Though within the last few years
there has been plenty of talk
about large, big-name rock con

LSjUMB were presented to the
COCE Concert Committee.
According to Holt, there are
three steps any campus group
must take in any attempt to co
sponsor a concert here — first, the
COCE must approve the organiza
tion and its plan for a concert. Sec
ondly, the group must receive ap
proval for the specific performer

$92,000 loss in 1979-80. Because of
this tremendous drain on ASSU
resources, the operation was
ended, and the ASSU Task Force
on Contemporary Entertainment
was initiated to investigate the
failure of what had once been the
ASSU's biggest money maker.
According to the report pub
lished by the task force, there
were several problems that con
tributed to the tremendous losses
experienced by the organization.
Among these were a poor rela
tionship between the Special
Events project director and the
ASSU student financial manager, a
lack of continuity from year to
year for project members and a
pay scale that rewarded quantity
6f concerts put on instead of how
successful each one was.
The report also cited problems
caused by the relative inex
perience of the organization's
members which included over
bidding and underbudgetting on
concerts, lack of negotiating abili
ty and lack of a permanent system
of recordkeeping.
In summary, the report says of
the problems, "interviews with
the representatives of each de
partment, past project managers,
and past financial managers reveal
many miscommunications, non
communications and poor inten
tions."
Following the recommenda
tions of the task force, campus
groups putting on concerts now

moters, usually Bill Graham Pres
ents, often working with Scher as a

However, there have been

for implementing the concert.
The ISfUMB had passed the first
and second steps before finding
out that John had scheduling con
flicts; the Chaparral has passed
the first step so far.
The Campus Entertainment
Eloard (CEB) is an ASSU organiza
tion with the purpose of providing
free entertainment for students,
according to Director Todd
Ackerman. Ackerman said that
the board wants to put on major
concerts next year, the receipts of
which would then be used to raise
money for other free events.
Before the creation of these two
boards concerts here were, for the
most part, organized by an ASSU
board called Special Events. In
contrast to the CEB and the stu
dent groups approved by the
COCE, which intend to work with
outside promoters on major con
certs, at one time Special Events
promoted its own concerts.
Although the organization lost
money in earlier years (it went
$25,000 in the red in 1972-73), un
der the directorship of then Grad
uate School of Business student
Danny Scher, Special Events made
money — $55,000 in 1973-74 and
over $50,000 in 1974-75 (Scher is
presently a vice-president for Bill
Graham Presents).
However, in later years the or
ganization once again began to
lose monev, culminating in a

University's
Committee on
Contemporary
Entertainment
(COCE), overseeing
the Co n cert
Committee, which
"approves proposals
for concerts" by any
campus group and
also advises students
trying to produce
concerts here....

Mathewson, a member ot the
COCE and the present student fi
nancial manager, said that on one
instance Graham scheduled a
concert in Berkeley simultane
ously with a concert here. She also
said that Graham's agency could
not be used for all types of music;

for instance, blue grass musicians
refuse to work with him, she said.
When Special Events still ex
isted, relations with Graham were
somewhat rockier. According to a
Daily article on Feb. 21, 1978,
Graham's "domination" of con
cert promotion in the Bay Area
was considered the biggest prob
lem facing Special Events. Mark
Curtis, then director of Special
Events, was quoted as saying that
"Graham hates it when Stanford
gets a show."
Mark Epstein, newly-elected
Council of Presidents member
and also a member of both the
COCE and the CEB, was even
more direct. He said that Special
Events irritated "the shit out of
him (Graham)." He said that the
ASSIi is not planning to promote
concerts independently but
would instead co-promote with
outside promoters; however, he
said that "when you co-prdnnote
you have to co-promote with peo
ple with less than acceptable busi
ness practices."
According to Epstein, the COCE
was created to protect students
from these practices. However,
Holt, who writes the performance
contracts and negotiates all cam
pus concerts, said that whenever
Bill Graham Presents is the co
promoter, the University operates
under a no-risk agreement, there
by avoiding up front financial
guarantees.
Though within the last few years
there has been plenty of talk
about large, big-name rock con
certs coming back to Stanford, the
actual results of all the discussion
have certainly not been substan
tial. Elton John, the Grateful Dead,
Pablo Cruise, the Doobie
Brothers, Linda Ronstadt, Kenny
Loggins, George Benson and Jim
my Buffett have all been men
tioned as possibilities. They may
make for an impressive line-up,
but none have yet shown up. The
real question is whether any big
name performer will ever again
perform here. This week Daily
staffers Adam Goodman and
Steve Trousdale take a look at the
concert situation on campus —
from the ups and downs of the
now defunct ASSU Special Events
to the predictions and possibilities
for the future. In between will be a
close-up view of concerts from
the perspectives of University of
ficials and professional promoters
such as Bill Graham as well as a
comparative analysis of the con
cert scene at other area univer
sities. Today: The history of stu
dent-run concerts.
Even the oldest students on
campus have only vague memo
ries of concerts at Stanford. The
last performance by a major band
was the Jefferson Starship concert
of two years ago. Recently, how
ever, there have been attempts by

various student groups here to
bring big-name pop and rock
groups to campus once again.
Earlier last year the Student-
Alumni Network (STAN) at
tempted to bring Pablo Cruise
here for a concert; the proposal
was approved over the summer
and an October concert date was
set. However, due to circum
stances beyond anyone's control

— the band's drummer broke his
hand — the concert had to be can
celled.
More recently two student or
ganizations, the leland Stanford
Junior University Marching Band
(LSJUMB) and the Chaparral mag
azine, have been trying to stage a
major concert here.
The LSJUMB attempted to bring
Elton John here in late June; how
ever, according to Vicky Holt, di
rector of University Events and
Services, he"isdefinitely not com
ing here." John Howard, the
LSJUMB manager, said that since it
has already received approval to
sponsor a concert on June 27 the
LSJUMB will look for another per
former.
However, he said that "no artist
of significant importance" will be
in the Bay Area at that time. Thus,
he commented that if no other ar
tist can be found the LSJUMB will
wait until next year to put on a
concert.
The reason John could not ap
pear here was due to a change
made in the middle of his tour that
necessitated having to move all of
the singer's shows indoors, ac
cording to Howard; Frost Am
phitheatre, which would have
been used for his concert here, is
an outdoor arena.
The Chaparral is also attempting
to bring a group to campus; ac
cording to Holt, the humor maga
zine's proposal has been "ap
proved ... Tor concert produc
tion." According to recent reports
in the Daily, the Chaparral has
been trying to bring the Grateful
Dead here. Holt refused to con
firm or deny this, and Thorn
Massey, an associate dean h«ire,
also declined comment on the sta
tus of negotiations with the Dead,

for instance, blue grass musicians
refuse to work with him, she said.
When Special Events still ex
isted, relations with Graham were
somewhat rockier. According to a
Daily article on Feb. 21, 1978,
Graham's "domination" of con
cert promotion in the Bay Area
was considered the biggest prob
lem facing Special Events. Mark
Curtis, then director of Special
Events, was quoted as saying that
"Graham hates it when Stanford
gets a show."
Mark Epstein, newly-elected
Council of Presidents member
and also a member of both the
COCE and the CEB, was even
more direct. He said that Special
Events irritated "the shit out of
him (Graham)." He said that the
ASSIi is not planning to promote
concerts independently but
would instead co-promote with
outside promoters; however, he
said that "when you co-prdnnote
you have to co-promote with peo
ple with less than acceptable busi
ness practices."
According to Epstein, the COCE
was created to protect students
from these practices. However,
Holt, who writes the performance
contracts and negotiates all cam
pus concerts, said that whenever
Bill Graham Presents is the co
promoter, the University operates
under a no-risk agreement, there
by avoiding up front financial
guarantees.
Though within the last few years
there has been plenty of talk
about large, big-name rock con
certs coming back to Stanford, the
actual results of all the discussion
have certainly not been substan
tial. Elton John, the Grateful Dead,
Pablo Cruise, the Doobie
Brothers, Linda Ronstadt, Kenny
Loggins, George Benson and Jim
my Buffett have all been men
tioned as possibilities. They may
make for an impressive line-up,
but none have yet shown up. The
real question is whether any big
name performer will ever again
perform here. This week Daily
staffers Adam Goodman and
Steve Trousdale take a look at the
concert situation on campus —
from the ups and downs of the
now defunct ASSU Special Events
to the predictions and possibilities
for the future. In between will be a
close-up view of concerts from
the perspectives of University of
ficials and professional promoters
such as Bill Graham as well as a
comparative analysis of the con
cert scene at other area univer
sities. Today: The history of stu
dent-run concerts.
Even the oldest students on
campus have only vague memo
ries of concerts at Stanford. The
last performance by a major band
was the Jefferson Starship concert
of two years ago. Recently, how
ever, there have been attempts by

various student groups here to
bring big-name pop and rock
groups to campus once again.
Earlier last year the Student-
Alumni Network (STAN) at
tempted to bring Pablo Cruise
here for a concert; the proposal
was approved over the summer
and an October concert date was
set. However, due to circum
stances beyond anyone's control

— the band's drummer broke his
hand — the concert had to be can
celled.
More recently two student or
ganizations, the leland Stanford
Junior University Marching Band
(LSJUMB) and the Chaparral mag
azine, have been trying to stage a
major concert here.
The LSJUMB attempted to bring
Elton John here in late June; how
ever, according to Vicky Holt, di
rector of University Events and
Services, he"isdefinitely not com
ing here." John Howard, the
LSJUMB manager, said that since it
has already received approval to
sponsor a concert on June 27 the
LSJUMB will look for another per
former.
However, he said that "no artist
of significant importance" will be
in the Bay Area at that time. Thus,
he commented that if no other ar
tist can be found the LSJUMB will
wait until next year to put on a
concert.
The reason John could not ap
pear here was due to a change
made in the middle of his tour that
necessitated having to move all of
the singer's shows indoors, ac
cording to Howard; Frost Am
phitheatre, which would have
been used for his concert here, is
an outdoor arena.
The Chaparral is also attempting
to bring a group to campus; ac
cording to Holt, the humor maga
zine's proposal has been "ap
proved ... Tor concert produc
tion." According to recent reports
in the Daily, the Chaparral has
been trying to bring the Grateful
Dead here. Holt refused to con
firm or deny this, and Thorn
Massey, an associate dean h«ire,
also declined comment on the sta
tus of negotiations with the Dead,

of these latest attempts to sched

The powerful of the two is

LSjUMB were presented to the
COCE Concert Committee.
According to Holt, there are
three steps any campus group
must take in any attempt to co
sponsor a concert here — first, the
COCE must approve the organiza
tion and its plan for a concert. Sec
ondly, the group must receive ap
proval for the specific performer

$92,000 loss in 1979-80. Because of
this tremendous drain on ASSU
resources, the operation was
ended, and the ASSU Task Force
on Contemporary Entertainment
was initiated to investigate the
failure of what had once been the
ASSU's biggest money maker.
According to the report pub
lished by the task force, there
were several problems that con
tributed to the tremendous losses
experienced by the organization.
Among these were a poor rela
tionship between the Special
Events project director and the
ASSU student financial manager, a
lack of continuity from year to
year for project members and a
pay scale that rewarded quantity
6f concerts put on instead of how
successful each one was.
The report also cited problems
caused by the relative inex
perience of the organization's
members which included over
bidding and underbudgetting on
concerts, lack of negotiating abili
ty and lack of a permanent system
of recordkeeping.
In summary, the report says of
the problems, "interviews with
the representatives of each de
partment, past project managers,
and past financial managers reveal
many miscommunications, non
communications and poor inten
tions."
Following the recommenda
tions of the task force, campus
groups putting on concerts now

moters, usually Bill Graham Pres
ents, often working with Scher as a
liason.
However, there have been
problems in the past with the
Graham organization. Cynthia

requested, and finally, the COCE
must approve the group's plans,
for implementing the concert.
The ISfUMB had passed the first
and second steps before finding
out that John had scheduling con
flicts; the Chaparral has passed
the first step so far.
The Campus Entertainment
Eloard (CEB) is an ASSU organiza
tion with the purpose of providing
free entertainment for students,
according to Director Todd
Ackerman. Ackerman said that
the board wants to put on major
concerts next year, the receipts of
which would then be used to raise
money for other free events.
Before the creation of these two
boards concerts here were, for the
most part, organized by an ASSU
board called Special Events. In
contrast to the CEB and the stu
dent groups approved by the
COCE, which intend to work with
outside promoters on major con
certs, at one time Special Events
promoted its own concerts.
Although the organization lost
money in earlier years (it went
$25,000 in the red in 1972-73), un
der the directorship of then Grad
uate School of Business student
Danny Scher, Special Events made
money — $55,000 in 1973-74 and
over $50,000 in 1974-75 (Scher is
presently a vice-president for Bill
Graham Presents).
However, in later years the or
ganization once again began to
lose monev, culminating in a

(COCE), overseeing

Committee, which

Mathewson, a member ot the
COCE and the present student fi
nancial manager, said that on one
instance Graham scheduled a
concert in Berkeley simultane
ously with a concert here. She also
said that Graham's agency could
not be used for all types of music;

for instance, blue grass musicians
refuse to work with him, she said.
When Special Events still ex

somewhat rockier. According to a
