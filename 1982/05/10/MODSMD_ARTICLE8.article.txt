The Hooverville
'32/Reaganville '82 activities
here last week drew a wide va
jjety of groups from across the
)tate in addition to national
.media attention. Students from
more than ten campus or
fjanizations spent more than
ive months organizing the ac
tivities as a protest against the
Reagan administration's poli
cies.
Z. Both CBS and NBC carried
yoverage of Friday's and Satur
day's activities on Saturday
"Might evening news programs,
and local newspapers, TV and
radio stations also carried ex
tensive coverage of the ac
tivities. NBC spokespersons
said that they requested per
mission to land a five-person
helicopter on campus to cover
the rally, but they were denied
permission by University po
lice and administrators.
Though the turnout was
much less than the 5,000 peo
ple that were expected, or
ganizers called the event a suc
cess.
"We succeeded in bringing a
diverse group of people to
gether to discuss their com
mon interest in the Reagan ad
ministration policies," said
Nick Burbules, who helped
stage the event.
"This is a major crowd," Pe
ter Radcliffe, another or
ganizer, said. "People are real

ly relaxed. They're enjoying
the entertainment, responding
to the speeches, and it seems
that a community spirit is de
veloping here.'.'
Organizer Phil Ansell also
emphasized that the activities
were successful in helping to
build a new coalition of
groups.
"Even though there wasn't a
huge number of people, the
people we've contacted are
going to remember this next
time," he said. "It's a way of
building coalitions."
Ansell noted that the new
coalition includes groups such
as the Santa Clara Labor Coun
cil and some church and com
munity groups that never en
dorsed tne protest demonstra
tions of the 60's.
In Rev. Cecil Williams open
ing speech, he said, "Don't be
discouraged by the number of
people who are here today. We
don't need numbers. We need
concerned people who are
ready to move."
Wnile the crowd at Satur
day's activities included rela
tively few Stanford students,
many students from neighbor
ing universities, members of
neighboring communities,
union members and members
of other statewide political or
ganizations attended the
event.
Information booths were set
up along Serra Road on Satur

day near Hoover Tower by
more than 20 organizations
representing a wide variety of
political groups. Organizers
said they sent more than 3,500
mailings to individuals and
groups across the state.
The circle in front of Memo
rial Auditorium was filled with
people sitting around the foun
tain or laying on the grass lis
tening to the speeches and en
tertainment at the foot of Hoo
ver Tower. Others walked
among the booths and the
shanties in the field or waited

in line to buy hamburgers or
balloons.
The crowd reached its largest
size when Holly Near and the
San Francisco Mime Troupe
took the stage. Near per
formed a number of folk songs
including "Fight Back" and "El
Salvador" as members of the
audience clapped and sang
along. The mime troupe pre
sented a series of satirical skits,
poking fun at Jerry Falwell's
Moral Majority. The Solidarity
Singers also performed a
number of protest songs, in

cluding the"The Jellybean
Blues" and "Brother Can You
Spare a Five," as members of
the audience clapped along.
Besides building cardboard
and wood shanties, demon
strators used other symbols to
make their political statements.
Students from a Stanford
Workshop on Political and So
cial Issues (SWOPSI) disarma
ment course constructed a 20-
foot mock MX missile near the
foot of Hoover Tower out of re
cycling bins. The missile was

labeled "Mass X-termination
Missile" and carried a price-tag
of $34,000,000,000.
The Miwok Indians set up
two teepees in the field among
the shanties. Jonathan "Swift
Turtle" Ladeux said he set up
the teepees because, "We are
here to promote harmony."
One demonstrator carried a
placard which said, "U.s. Guns
Kill U.s. Nuns."
Malgosia Mazgaj Frank, a
Polish citizen who left Poland a
month before martial law was
instated (Dec. '81), also at
tended the rally. She said, "It's
very impressive. All these en
thusiastic people around who
are concerned about what's
going on."
One student here said "I
think it's very exciting. I came
because I wanted to see what's
going on and to be a part of it if
I could."
When a women from San
Jose State was asked why she
came to the activities here, she
said "My position is some
where between being radical
and getting a sun tan."
According to one organizer,
University administrators and
campus police were "very co
operative" in helping to or
ganize the event. He especially
commended the University
grounds crew, calling them
"incredible."
Nan Bentley, office manager
of University Events and Ser

vices, said that the Reaganville
organizers were "very cons
cientious" in their planning
and that she expected no prob
lems.
According to a Hoover Fel
low who asked not to be identi
fied, "The people at the Hoo
ver Institute were kind of ner
vous. They remembered the
student protests in the 60's.
They locked the mailroom
door which isn't usually
locked, but that's about all."
The activities were endorsed
by more than 30 political
groups including the San
Fransisco Grey Panthers, the
Santa Clara Labor Council, the
Children's Rights Group of San
Fransisco, the National Re
sistance Committee, the Unit
ed Stanford Workers, the Third
World Coalition, the Black Stu
dent Union, United Campus
Christian Ministries, the Cay
People's Union, the War Re
sistor's League, Palo Alto High
