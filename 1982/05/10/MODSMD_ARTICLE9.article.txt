## RAs aren't martyrs, egotists 
### 
The biggest challenge a frosh dorm
RA faces is to avoid being seduced —
or seduced by exaggerated concep
tions of what he or she can ac
complish. Because of both the trust
freshman repose in their RAs and the
all-encompassing nature of the role
itself, the temptation for an RA to
play God is trempndous.
As the only upperclassmen
around, frosh dorm RAs become the
first and last authorities on many mat
ters, ranging from the relatively
harmless "where's the best place to
study?" to the trickier "what are the
fraternities like at Stanford?" You
find your opinion being given a lot of
weight. It's flattering and who among
us is impervious to flattery?
Freshman also idealize their RAs a
bit. You're there to help them get
through their first year, and they
want to believe in you as much as
they can. You look a little taller, your
jokes seem a little funnier and your
ideas better than anyone else's. Of
course a lot of this wears off, but
some residue lingers.
Thus is born the temptation for an
RA in a freshman dorm to see himself
as all-powerful. The temptation is re
inforced by the demanding nature of
the role itself. Like priests and po
licemen, RAs are always "on-duty."
They live their roles. The perfect RA
always spots those in trouble and
reaches out to them in a com
passionate but not condescending

way. He seizes each opportunity to
further greater social and intellectual
interaction. He never acts as anything
less than a perfect role model,
himself. No one can fulfill such a role,
but because RAs are just as duty-con
scious as the average Stanford stu
dent, they try.
To be sure, there is nothing wrong
with stretching yourself beyond your
limits. Trying to fulfill the role brings
out the best in you and fosters mean
ingful personal growth. Because you
really do "live your role," the
strength and attributes which you
develop "on the job" become a part
of your personality. You become a
better listener and a bit more or
ganized in your personal life.
It is dangerous, however, for an RA
to ever believe that he or she can or
should be able to completely fill the
role. Such a belief inspires either
egomania or martyrdom. Either you
find yourself really believing that you
can be all things to all people or you
sacrifice your outside interests for
the dorm.
"Martyr" RAs are easy to spot.
They tell you F'Aing in a freshman
house means giving up grades and
outside friends. In cutting them
selves off, they usually become too
dependent on their frosh, the people
they are supposed to help, for
positive affirmation and support.
Egomaniac RAs are also easy to
identify. They usually become embit
tered and "burnt out" after their fall
quarter following drifts away. Few
RAs let themselves reach such ex
tremes. Realistically however, I think
experiencing elements of both is in
escapable. I have seen a little of each
in myself.
The happy medium between
thinking that you're God's gift to the

dorm and that you're never in the
dorm enough is hard to reach. The
key to achieving it is realizing your
limits. You can't solve every problem
and meet every need, and if you
don't save enough time for outside
friends and interests, then you're not
going to be a very happy person and
won't be much good to anybody.
Once you're willing to drop any il
lusions of personal omnipotence and
to forgo the comfortable aura of
dorm martyr, I think you'll find that
the appreciation of your frosh is
more than enough to keep you
going. For them, the most important
thing is not what you do but why you
do it. It's not the advice you give or
the programs you plan which earns
the appreciation of your frosh but
the fact that in making these and oth
er efforts, you show you care for
them. They forgive your short
comings and appreciate your efforts.
They look past your sometimes pa
tronizing admonitions and your
sometimes overzealout rallying calls
and are touched by your concern.
So they respond to you, each in dif
ferent way. Some walk right up to
you and give you big bear hugs in the
halls. Others make a point of includ
ing you in various activities. A lot of
them just plain tell you that they ap
preciate you. It's a very good feeling.
Is that all there is to being an RA,
simply trying hard? Basically, yes. Of
course, simply caring for them is not
going to solve all their problems. As
RA, you can't solve their problems;
only they can. You can make things a
little easier, however, and that's im
portant.

develop "on the job" become a part
of your personality. You become a
better listener and a bit more or
ganized in your personal life.
It is dangerous, however, for an RA
to ever believe that he or she can or
should be able to completely fill the
role. Such a belief inspires either
egomania or martyrdom. Either you
find yourself really believing that you
can be all things to all people or you
sacrifice your outside interests for
the dorm.
"Martyr" RAs are easy to spot.
They tell you F'Aing in a freshman
house means giving up grades and
outside friends. In cutting them
selves off, they usually become too
dependent on their frosh, the people
they are supposed to help, for
positive affirmation and support.
Egomaniac RAs are also easy to
identify. They usually become embit
tered and "burnt out" after their fall
quarter following drifts away. Few
RAs let themselves reach such ex
tremes. Realistically however, I think
experiencing elements of both is in
escapable. I have seen a little of each
in myself.
The happy medium between
thinking that you're God's gift to the

dorm and that you're never in the
dorm enough is hard to reach. The
key to achieving it is realizing your
limits. You can't solve every problem
and meet every need, and if you
don't save enough time for outside
friends and interests, then you're not
going to be a very happy person and
won't be much good to anybody.
Once you're willing to drop any il
lusions of personal omnipotence and
to forgo the comfortable aura of
dorm martyr, I think you'll find that
the appreciation of your frosh is
more than enough to keep you
going. For them, the most important
thing is not what you do but why you
do it. It's not the advice you give or
the programs you plan which earns
the appreciation of your frosh but
the fact that in making these and oth
er efforts, you show you care for
them. They forgive your short
comings and appreciate your efforts.
They look past your sometimes pa
tronizing admonitions and your
sometimes overzealout rallying calls
and are touched by your concern.
So they respond to you, each in dif
ferent way. Some walk right up to
you and give you big bear hugs in the
halls. Others make a point of includ
ing you in various activities. A lot of
them just plain tell you that they ap
preciate you. It's a very good feeling.
Is that all there is to being an RA,
simply trying hard? Basically, yes. Of
course, simply caring for them is not
going to solve all their problems. As
RA, you can't solve their problems;
only they can. You can make things a
little easier, however, and that's im
portant.

The biggest challenge a frosh dorm
RA faces is to avoid being seduced —
or seduced by exaggerated concep
tions of what he or she can ac
complish. Because of both the trust
freshman repose in their RAs and the
all-encompassing nature of the role
itself, the temptation for an RA to
play God is trempndous.
As the only upperclassmen
around, frosh dorm RAs become the
first and last authorities on many mat
ters, ranging from the relatively
harmless "where's the best place to
study?" to the trickier "what are the
fraternities like at Stanford?" You
find your opinion being given a lot of
weight. It's flattering and who among
us is impervious to flattery?
Freshman also idealize their RAs a
bit. You're there to help them get
through their first year, and they
want to believe in you as much as
they can. You look a little taller, your
jokes seem a little funnier and your
ideas better than anyone else's. Of
course a lot of this wears off, but
some residue lingers.
Thus is born the temptation for an
RA in a freshman dorm to see himself
as all-powerful. The temptation is re
inforced by the demanding nature of
the role itself. Like priests and po
licemen, RAs are always "on-duty."
They live their roles. The perfect RA
always spots those in trouble and
reaches out to them in a com
passionate but not condescending

way. He seizes each opportunity to
further greater social and intellectual
interaction. He never acts as anything
less than a perfect role model,
himself. No one can fulfill such a role,
but because RAs are just as duty-con
scious as the average Stanford stu
dent, they try.
To be sure, there is nothing wrong
with stretching yourself beyond your
limits. Trying to fulfill the role brings
out the best in you and fosters mean
ingful personal growth. Because you
really do "live your role," the
strength and attributes which you
develop "on the job" become a part
of your personality. You become a
better listener and a bit more or
ganized in your personal life.
