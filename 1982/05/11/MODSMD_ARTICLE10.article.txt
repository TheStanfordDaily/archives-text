## ASSU, University discuss control Boathouse under review 
### Geoff Dryvynsyde 
Though many students
here enjoy the unique rec
reational facilities of Lake
Lagunita's Boathouse, the
Boathouse's future is now in
question.
The University and the
ASSU have recently dis
cussed which group should
be responsible for main
taining the Boathouse. In
fact the issue even arose
during this year's ASSU-
University budget nego
tiations.
A Lake Usage Committee
has now been set up to look
into the question of the
future of the Boathouse. Ac
cording to committee mem
ber Cynthia Mathewson,
lawyers are checking into li
ability concerns right now.
When asked who will end
up with control over the
Boathouse she replied, "I
can't say which way it is
going to go." The commit
tee should come up with
some findings by the end of
spring, Mathewson said.
Currently, the ASSU has a
long term lease with the
university for the Boathouse
land. Under the terms of the
lease the ASSU is changed
with maintaining the safety
of the lake, according to a
report prepared by last
year's head lifeguard Garth
Everhart.
The ASSU runs the
Boathouse through five life
guards who are chosen ev
ery spring to live at the
Boathouse the following
year. These guards take care
of the building, act as night
watchmen and are in charge
of the 30 other guards who
work at the Boathouse.
The Stanford Sailing As
sociation takes space in the
Boathouse and does main
tenance work in lieu of rent.
This year every student in
windsurfing and sailing

classes must work on the
Boathouse in order to re
ceive a passing grade. The
university does no main
tenance, according to Gwil
Evans, current head guard.
Although the University
does provide some money
for guard's salaries, the
Boathouse is funded prima
rily through fee
assessments. Evans said that
this year, of a fee assessment
of $11,000 about 45 percent
was taken back by students.

This meant that much
work could not be done on
the Boathouse, he said. In
stallation of washrooms was
considered at one point,
however Evans said that a
new waterline would have
been too costly. Currently,
the nearest public wash
rooms are located at Tres
idder Union.
Some work has been
done on the Boathouse by
the live-in guards. Some of
the decking and the railing
has been repaired. The un
derside of the Boathouse,
however is "starting to
hurt," Evans said.
"If the university decided

to leave it (the Boathouse)
here, it would be (last) five
to six years," he said.
Guards have also
launched a campaign to
keep non-Stanford people
out, Evans said. Chains and
bollards have been erected
and ID may now be re
quested of people on the
beach.
Currently, Stanford stu
dents, faculty and staff are
able to enjoy Boathouse
privileges,such as canoe
rental and use of the beach
and barbeque.
The Boathouse is a good
place for parties and is
rented out to dorms and
sororities, Evans said. Wind
surfer storage is available
and windsurfing and sailing
classes are run out of the
Boathouse.
The lake is always busy
"especially with the Big Way
Yacht Club," said Evans. Stu
dents from nearby dorms
also come down to the
beach. There are usually
three lifeguards on duty in
the afternoons and four to
five on duty on busy week
ends.
The present Boathouse is
38 years old. The previous
Boathouse was 30 years old
when it was condemned in
late 1942. Lake Lagunita was
built at the turn of the cen
tury and was originally
sealed with clay. The clay
was spread across the bot
tom of the lake and then
trampled down by 1000
sheep which were specially
imported for the purpose.
During the World War II the
clay was scraped off and a
victory garden was planted.
The wheat grown there pro
vided bread for the entire
campus. The first story of
the present Boathouse was
completed in 1945. It was
funded by student dona
tions and fees.

quested of people on the
beach.
Currently, Stanford stu
dents, faculty and staff are
able to enjoy Boathouse
privileges,such as canoe
rental and use of the beach
and barbeque.
The Boathouse is a good
place for parties and is
rented out to dorms and
sororities, Evans said. Wind
surfer storage is available
and windsurfing and sailing
classes are run out of the
Boathouse.
The lake is always busy
"especially with the Big Way
Yacht Club," said Evans. Stu
dents from nearby dorms
also come down to the
beach. There are usually
three lifeguards on duty in
the afternoons and four to
five on duty on busy week
ends.
The present Boathouse is
38 years old. The previous
Boathouse was 30 years old
when it was condemned in
late 1942. Lake Lagunita was
built at the turn of the cen
tury and was originally
sealed with clay. The clay
was spread across the bot
tom of the lake and then
trampled down by 1000
sheep which were specially
imported for the purpose.
During the World War II the
clay was scraped off and a
victory garden was planted.
The wheat grown there pro
vided bread for the entire
campus. The first story of
the present Boathouse was
completed in 1945. It was
funded by student dona
tions and fees.
Though many students
here enjoy the unique rec
reational facilities of Lake
Lagunita's Boathouse, the
Boathouse's future is now in
question.
The University and the
ASSU have recently dis
cussed which group should
be responsible for main
taining the Boathouse. In
fact the issue even arose
during this year's ASSU-
University budget nego
tiations.
A Lake Usage Committee
has now been set up to look
into the question of the
future of the Boathouse. Ac
cording to committee mem
ber Cynthia Mathewson,
lawyers are checking into li
ability concerns right now.
When asked who will end
up with control over the
Boathouse she replied, "I
can't say which way it is
going to go." The commit
tee should come up with
some findings by the end of
spring, Mathewson said.
Currently, the ASSU has a
long term lease with the
university for the Boathouse
land. Under the terms of the
lease the ASSU is changed
with maintaining the safety
of the lake, according to a
report prepared by last
year's head lifeguard Garth
Everhart.
The ASSU runs the
Boathouse through five life
guards who are chosen ev
ery spring to live at the
Boathouse the following
year. These guards take care
of the building, act as night
watchmen and are in charge
of the 30 other guards who
work at the Boathouse.
The Stanford Sailing As
sociation takes space in the
Boathouse and does main
tenance work in lieu of rent.
This year every student in
windsurfing and sailing

classes must work on the
Boathouse in order to re
ceive a passing grade. The
university does no main
tenance, according to Gwil
Evans, current head guard.
Although the University
does provide some money
for guard's salaries, the
Boathouse is funded prima
rily through fee
assessments. Evans said that
this year, of a fee assessment
of $11,000 about 45 percent
was taken back by students.

Currently,"the
ASSU has a lease

This meant that much
work could not be done on
the Boathouse, he said. In
stallation of washrooms was
considered at one point,
however Evans said that a
new waterline would have
been too costly. Currently,
the nearest public wash
rooms are located at Tres
idder Union.
Some work has been
done on the Boathouse by
the live-in guards. Some of
the decking and the railing
has been repaired. The un
derside of the Boathouse,
however is "starting to
hurt," Evans said.
"If the university decided

to leave it (the Boathouse)
here, it would be (last) five
to six years," he said.
Guards have also
launched a campaign to
keep non-Stanford people
out, Evans said. Chains and
bollards have been erected
and ID may now be re
quested of people on the
beach.
