## Nuclear energy: cheap, safe, reliable 
### 
Steve Borish's column (Daily, May 4) is dist
inguished by the same sincerity, eloquence, casual
disregard of some facts and blithe ignorance of
others that have characterized all of his previous
columns on nuclear power.
He states that in the early days of nuclear energy
it was a "peculiarly American form of hubris" that
led to our insisting on supplying underdeveloped
countries with "secrets" of atomic energy. We
"were shoving this technology down people's
throats. We shipped a research reactor to the Con
go, which needed more elementary school
rooms" (Here Borish is quoting Massachusetts In
stitute of Technology Prof. George Rathjens).
Well — in the first place, we did not shove any
thing down anybody's throat. Countries which ob
tained research reactors did so quite willingly and
eagerly, and are still anxious for technical as
sistance in the nuclear area. This particular reactor
for the Congo went to the University of Lavanium
(Kinshala) where it has been used for education,
research in neutron and solid-state physics, and
production of radioisotopes for agriculture and
medicine.
Maybe classrooms were more urgently needed,
but who is now showing hubris? Wasn't this a de
cision to be made at the time by the Congolese,
rather than by Rathjens and Borish 20 years later?
The question raised by Borish on the linkage be
tween civilian nuclear power and military applica
tions is indeed a disturbing one. The nuclear in
dustry, almost unanimously, has rejected outright
any attempt of the administration to convert the
plutonium from spent power reactor fuel to weap
ons. Almost nobody in the industry wants any of
the plutonium used for weapons. In fact, a good
way to ensure that it won't be used for weapons is

to recycle it as an energy resource, in both light wa
ter and breeder reactors.
Borish asserts that the Reagan administration is
out to "save" the nuclear industry, citing, among
other things, its attempts to streamline the licens
ing process. Actually, the administration's record
on support of nuclear power is mixed, but on this
particular issue, I see it as a simple correction of
regulatory overkill, rather than a bailout.
A major contributor to the long construction
time (12 to 14 years) of U.S. power reactors is the
total regulatory burden (local, state and federal)
imposed on the industry. Few other countries in
the world delay construction for so long — in some
(France, Japan, etc.) the construction time is half as
long as in the U.S. Their reactors do not seem to be
any less safe than ours. This is important, because
for a capital-intensive industry like nuclear power,
the economics rapidly get worse as the construc
tion time stretches, owing to interest payments
and other cost escalations.
If nuclear power in the U.S. is indeed in econom
ic trouble, the complexity and inefficiency of the
regulatory process are in large part to blame.
Streamlining of this process without compromis
ing safety is both possible and overdue.
Borish accuses the administration of pushing the
building of a nuclear waste repository, "despite
widespread scientific and public doubt that a safe
disposal method has been or can be found." In
fact, there is remarkable agreement among
cognizant scientists that there are no technical im
pediments to safe nuclear waste disposal. As a sin
gle example, I refer Borish to the 1978 report of the
American Physical Society Study Group on Nucle
ar Fuel Cycles and Waste Management, published

in Reviews of Modern Physics.
Borish's claim that the proposal to dismantle
DOE is a plot to place both nuclear weapons and
nuclear power programs under one roof is bizarre,
to say the least. Since 1954 these programs have
always been under one (civilian) agency, first the
Atomic Energy Commission, then E.R.D.A. and
since 1976, DOE. It is true that regulatory oversight
of the nuclear power industry was given to the Nu
clear Regulatory Commission in 1974, but the pro
posed dismantling of DOE will not affect NRC.
Would Borish have preferred the Department of
Defense to have been in charge of nuclear weap
ons research and production? In any case, this may
be a dead issue, since there now seems little
chance of the proposed elimination of DOE get
ting through Congress.
Borish says that nuclear power is "an economic
catstrophe, a public health disaster and an
ecological nightmare." Strong words indeed — we
all know of the people who have fallen by droves
in this disaster and we can all see the vast areas of
the world laid waste by this ecological nightmare.
To paraphrase Winston Churchill: Some disaster!
Some nightmare!
It would certainly be nice if we could live in a
world without energy, or if we could obtain the
necessary energy without having to pay for it in
some manner. In the real world neither is possible.
Far from being the monster portrayed by Borish,
nuclear energy is cheap, safe, reliable and environ
mentally benign. It should not be abandoned be
cause of irrational fears of grossly exaggerated or
imaginary dangers.
