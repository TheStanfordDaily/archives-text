## Endorsement of merit-based aid misleading, inadequate 
### 
The recent Daily editorial on the
proposed federal cutbacks in student
aid ("Financial Aid on Merit," May 6)
is an inadequate and misleading
analysis of the Reagan adminis
tration's cost-saving proposals and
Harvard President Derek Bok's alter
natives.
Bok raised a storm of controversy
with his recent suggestion that some
form of merit-based aid should be es
tablished. In particular, according to
the editorial, Bok has proposed that
"high school grades and standard
ized test scores be used to determine
a financial aid cutoff level, below
which some students would be in
eligible federal grants."

The Daily's support of Bok's con
cept fails to account not only for the
inherent difficulties in adopting any
objective standard for assessing
"merit," but also for Bok's reserva
tions with his own suggestion.
Bok admits the impossibility of
predicting whether a specific high
school senior will go on to complete
an undergraduate program. Stating
that the goal is not simply to aid just
those students with high grades or
scores but to assist those who will
eventually graduate, he suggests that
"it might be even better to convert
the entire program to loans and then
cancel repayment for all recipients
who finish their course of study."

Clearly this proposal would saddle
those students least likely to repay
their loans — college dropouts —
with all the loan obligations. A better
alternative would be a system which
increases federal aid as one
progresses through school; the study
Bok cites in his annual report fails to
compare the probability of gradu
ation for a sophomore against that of
a senior.
Bok's proposals and the Daily edi
torial seem to suggest that financial
aid should be limited to the Harvard
and Stanford applicant pools; stu
dents at less competitive schools can
fend for themselves. What is sadly
lacking in the Daily editorial, and in

current protests over student aid cuts
in general, is a sense of perspective
and a sense of fairness.
"Ideally," the editorial states,
"there should be no cutbacks in fed
eral financial aid programs." This
stance clashes with the congressional
bipartisan consensus and the views of
even Bok. The previous student fi
nancial aid program was excessively
generous. Bok specifically criticizes
the extension of Basic Educational
Opportunity Grant (BEOG) eligibility
to middle income families and the
amendments to the Middle Income
Assistance Act of 1980 granting Guar
anteed Student Loans (GSL) regard
less of need. Such policies,, writes

Bok, were "indefensible, even in af
fluent times." The question is no
longer if to cut, but where.
So far, the administration's pro
posals have included the rollback of
Social Security benefits to college
students and the tightening of
eligibility requirements for BEOG re
cipients and GSL borrowers. These
cuts have preserved aid for the truly
impoverished student while making
it more expensive, though by no
means impossible, for the middle-in
come student to get a college
degree.
The administration's latest pro
posals, dealing mostly with the GSL
program, are identical in effect and

intent. They seek to correct abuses,
keep basic commitments intact, and
force each student to take a harder
look at the costs and benefits of
pursuing a college degree.
In the pursuit of equitable solu
tions, extreme approaches and
equally extreme alternatives will in
evitably be proposed. Bok's plea for a
merit-based aid policy is self-serving
and inadequate. Its shortcomings are
surpassed only by the Daily's ill-con
sidered endorsement.
