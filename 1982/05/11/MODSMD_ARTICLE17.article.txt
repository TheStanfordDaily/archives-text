## El Salvadorans elected fairly 
### 
The Daily's most recent editorial
on the elections in El Salvador ("Ter
rorism distorts election/' May 5),
struck me as one of the most arrogant
examples of hegemonic haughtiness
since the proclamation of the
Monroe Doctrine. The bottom line
of the editorial was that the election
should be discredited, and U.S. aid
discontinued, simply because the re
sults were not to the Daily's liking.
Regardless of the tremendous
turnout of voters — despite guerilla
attacks on polling places — in an
election carried out under the
monitoring of observers from the
U.S. Congress and the Organization
of American States, an election
which, in one important respect, was
fairer than any conducted during the

first 132 years of the Constitutional
United States (women got to vote in
this one), the Daily feels that the
whole process should be scrapped
due to the strong showing of rightist
Roberto d'Aubuisson.
I guess those peasants just didn't
understand that they were supposed
to be part of the "large percentage of
the population" supporting the
guerillas. But it's not surprising that
the Salvadorans didn't know as well
as the Daily what was best for them,
seeing as the perspective of events is
much better from here in Palo Alto.
Well, what about the election?
First, it was, in fact, a credible test of
the people's will. The Daily tremored
that, "political parties on the left re
fused to participate in the election
process for fear of their lives." Pre
sumably, they chose instead to con
tinue their activity in the safety
guerilla warfare.
It seems more likely that the far left
refused to participate because they
calculated (correctly) that the elec
tion offered no chance of their ob
taining power. Furthermore, they
feared that an election would destroy
the myth of widespread support for
the guerillas. Why else would they
resort to killing innocent citizens
who lined up to vote?
The lack of popular support for the
guerillas is borne out by a breakdown
of the election results. D'Aubuisson
campaigned vigorously on a pledge
to put an end to guerilla activity
(whereas jose Napoleon Duarte had
lost credibility in this regard), and he
scored best in the rural areas, which
were subjected to stronger leftist ter
rorism than the cities.
In a certain respect, one might say
that the United States, through its
tepid support of the torture-tested,
democrat Duarte, forced many
Salvadorans to side with the far right
in much the same way that liberal
apologists owe Nicaragua's increas
ingly Marxist/Soviet slant to an
absence of U.S. backing. But one
cannot carry this analogy too far
since post-revolutionary Nicaragua
has never held an election, free,
tainted, or otherwise.
I do not wish to imply that the Daily
should refrain from criticizing
d'Aubuisson's background; but how
can they say that a Salvadoran gov
ernment by popular election, which

includes right extremists, is not legit
imate, whereas a coalition govern
ment produced by elite, leadership
negotiations which include left ex
tremists (the Daily's proposal), would
be?
Doesn't the left's terrorism — the
aforementioned election day attacks,
numerous crop burnings, slaughter--
ings of security force relatives, etc. —
make them every bit as "dangerous
and violent" as the likes of
d'Aubuisson? Their inclusion in a
negotiated government would serve
to legitimize only one thing — the
idea that power is obtained from the
barrel of a gun.
Despite the Daily's fears of
d'Aubuisson, the truth is that his
power is quite constricted. He is not,
as the Daily admits, in charge of the
civilian government. Nor does he
wield any control over the armed.
forces, as evidenced by the military's
objections to d'Aubuisson's choice"
for the presidency.
The head of the government is the
politically independent, U.S. trained
economist Alvaro Magana. As for the
centrist Christian Democrats, they
control more assembly seats (24 of 60)
than any other single party by virtue
of their election plurality, and are
also guaranteed one of three vice
presidencies. The Daily believes that
this constitutes, "almost total ex
clusion from the new government." '
One of the top priorities of the
Salvadoran government is the sched
uling of new elections. By some re
ports, these may come as early as next
year. If the Daily truly has the in
terests of the Salvadoran people at
heart, they should support continua
tion of the electoral process in lieu of
power politics negotiations. Beyond
that, they should advocate a policy of
bolstering the moderate wing of the
government through economic aid,
a more favorable trade policy, and
even efforts to check the flow of for
eign arms to the guerillas.
In this way the centrists could...
further strengthen their grip onnn- n
tional affairs through the electoral
process, as the reasons for turning to
the extreme solutions of ther right
fade. This offers the only hope for the
founding of stable, democratic poli -
tics. p B t

Regardless of the tremendous
turnout of voters — despite guerilla
attacks on polling places — in an
election carried out under the
monitoring of observers from the
U.S. Congress and the Organization
of American States, an election
which, in one important respect, was
fairer than any conducted during the

first 132 years of the Constitutional
United States (women got to vote in
this one), the Daily feels that the
whole process should be scrapped
due to the strong showing of rightist
Roberto d'Aubuisson.
I guess those peasants just didn't
understand that they were supposed
to be part of the "large percentage of
the population" supporting the
guerillas. But it's not surprising that
the Salvadorans didn't know as well
as the Daily what was best for them,
seeing as the perspective of events is
much better from here in Palo Alto.
Well, what about the election?
First, it was, in fact, a credible test of
the people's will. The Daily tremored
that, "political parties on the left re
fused to participate in the election
process for fear of their lives." Pre
sumably, they chose instead to con
tinue their activity in the safety
guerilla warfare.
It seems more likely that the far left
refused to participate because they
calculated (correctly) that the elec
tion offered no chance of their ob
taining power. Furthermore, they
feared that an election would destroy
the myth of widespread support for
the guerillas. Why else would they
resort to killing innocent citizens
who lined up to vote?
The lack of popular support for the
guerillas is borne out by a breakdown
of the election results. D'Aubuisson
campaigned vigorously on a pledge
to put an end to guerilla activity
(whereas jose Napoleon Duarte had
lost credibility in this regard), and he
scored best in the rural areas, which
were subjected to stronger leftist ter
rorism than the cities.
In a certain respect, one might say
that the United States, through its
tepid support of the torture-tested,
democrat Duarte, forced many
Salvadorans to side with the far right
in much the same way that liberal
apologists owe Nicaragua's increas
ingly Marxist/Soviet slant to an
absence of U.S. backing. But one
cannot carry this analogy too far
since post-revolutionary Nicaragua
has never held an election, free,
tainted, or otherwise.
I do not wish to imply that the Daily
should refrain from criticizing
d'Aubuisson's background; but how
can they say that a Salvadoran gov
ernment by popular election, which

includes right extremists, is not legit
imate, whereas a coalition govern
ment produced by elite, leadership
negotiations which include left ex
tremists (the Daily's proposal), would
be?
Doesn't the left's terrorism — the
aforementioned election day attacks,
numerous crop burnings, slaughter--
ings of security force relatives, etc. —
make them every bit as "dangerous
and violent" as the likes of
d'Aubuisson? Their inclusion in a
negotiated government would serve
to legitimize only one thing — the
idea that power is obtained from the
barrel of a gun.
Despite the Daily's fears of
d'Aubuisson, the truth is that his
power is quite constricted. He is not,
as the Daily admits, in charge of the
civilian government. Nor does he
wield any control over the armed.
forces, as evidenced by the military's
objections to d'Aubuisson's choice"
for the presidency.
The head of the government is the
politically independent, U.S. trained
economist Alvaro Magana. As for the
centrist Christian Democrats, they
control more assembly seats (24 of 60)
than any other single party by virtue
of their election plurality, and are
also guaranteed one of three vice
presidencies. The Daily believes that
this constitutes, "almost total ex
clusion from the new government." '
One of the top priorities of the
Salvadoran government is the sched
uling of new elections. By some re
ports, these may come as early as next
year. If the Daily truly has the in
terests of the Salvadoran people at
heart, they should support continua
tion of the electoral process in lieu of
power politics negotiations. Beyond
that, they should advocate a policy of
bolstering the moderate wing of the
government through economic aid,
a more favorable trade policy, and
even efforts to check the flow of for
eign arms to the guerillas.
In this way the centrists could...
further strengthen their grip onnn- n

The Daily's most recent editorial
on the elections in El Salvador ("Ter
rorism distorts election/' May 5),
struck me as one of the most arrogant
examples of hegemonic haughtiness
since the proclamation of the
Monroe Doctrine. The bottom line
of the editorial was that the election
should be discredited, and U.S. aid
discontinued, simply because the re
sults were not to the Daily's liking.
