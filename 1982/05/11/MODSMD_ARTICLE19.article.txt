## ASSU ballot wording Indicated obvious bias 
### 
I am writing to express my dis
satisfaction with the ballot for ASSU
elections (April 14), in particular the
wording of the fee assessment re
form proposals and the bills sub
mitted as amendments to the ASSU
constitution.
Concerning the amendments to
the constitutions, I found the bill
summaries to be terribly one-sided.
After reading each proposal, I felt I
should mark "yes" as if it were the
correct answer. I am not at all familiar
with the finer points of this docu
ment and, perhaps, these changes
are very much needed, as I was lead
to believe. Nonetheless. I hardly see
this as an appropriate manner in
which to amend it. If the ASSU wishes
to educate voters, I suggest they do it
in a more neutral fashion.
I also take issue with the wording
of the reform proposals for fee
assessments. Again, it is very clear
which option the ASSU would like us
to support, the one which "allows
groups to organize budgets and plan
definite programs" and which makes
small groups "more secure from loss
of money through refunds."
Personally, I only needed to know
points one and five of this option;
that no students are eligible for re
funds of student fees and that stu
dents decide which mandatory fees
are assessed through majority ap
proval or disapproval. The other
points were added to make the man
datory fee option appear more at

tractive. One might have added to
the alternative option that allowing
students to collect refunds protected
individuals' rights. Qr, that this meth
od of student control held the or
ganizations funded in this manner
more responsible to the electorate.
Were the fee assessments proposal
preventing student refunds not so
closely analogous to income tax
withholding, perhaps I would not
take the time to write. But something
which may seem fairly trivial on the
University scale indeed manifests
itself in much larger proportions
elsewhere in our society. Hence, I
feel that when considering new
methods of administering student
government each proposal be neu
trally and fairly presented on the
ballot.
Perhaps these objections I have
raised are problems unique to the
overseas ballots. Regardless, I would
hope that in the future the wording
of the ballot be more carefully con
sidered.

We are writing this letter in re
sponse to David Lempert, who is kept
awake at night by "the constant blar
ing of sirens" and is apparently made
uneasy by the fact that security meas

ures intrude upon his consciousness.
We can only conclude from his
statements about being made "ner
vous" by "too much security" that he
wants the Stanford Police to reduce
its level of activity, or at least go un
dercover so as not to disturb his
nightly slumber. Perhaps the prob
lem is that Lempert is in a perpetual
state of slumber, thus preventing him
from finding out about the numer
ous rapes and attempted rapes on
campus this year, one of which was
reported in the Daily on the same day
his letter appeared.
We fail to see any other way that
Lempert could possibly make the
statement, "I just can't believe that
there is that much criminal activity or
potential for it here."
The fact is that such activity does
occur. For every female proceeding
from one point on campus to anoth
er, there are the "untold evils lurking
behind every eucalyptus tree" that
Lempert so smugly scoffs at. We are
sure that the women whose lives
have been permanently scarred by
these attacks, as well as that portion
of the Stanford community that must
live under constant fear of such at
tacks, do not share Lempert's cavalier
attitude toward the security system
that protects their lives.
The goal of the campus police
force is to prevent attacks before
they occur. Apparently the police are
not making potential assailants as

nervous as they make Lempert. Until
they do, we fail to see any compelling
reason for curtailing security meas
ures on the Stanford campus.

Angry yellow flyers appeared on
campus last week. They depict a
muscular woman kicking a cringing
man, whom the slogan implies is a
rapist.
I object to the violence of this im
age. Although this year's sexual as
saults have angered me, violence is
not the necessary expression of this
anger.
Rape must be confronted and de
feated. Women can take responsi
bility for their own safety and de
fense, and should be able to use vio
lence against an attacker. But vio
lence is not the way to end rape in
our society. Men and women must
work to change the attitudes that
promote rape.
One of those attitudes is the accep
tance of violence in our everyday
lives. In fighting rape, we must also
guard against seeing violence as the
cure and not the symptom.

sponse to David Lempert, who is kept
awake at night by "the constant blar
ing of sirens" and is apparently made
uneasy by the fact that security meas

ures intrude upon his consciousness.
We can only conclude from his
statements about being made "ner
vous" by "too much security" that he
wants the Stanford Police to reduce
its level of activity, or at least go un
dercover so as not to disturb his
nightly slumber. Perhaps the prob
lem is that Lempert is in a perpetual
state of slumber, thus preventing him
from finding out about the numer
ous rapes and attempted rapes on
campus this year, one of which was
reported in the Daily on the same day
his letter appeared.
We fail to see any other way that
Lempert could possibly make the
statement, "I just can't believe that
there is that much criminal activity or
potential for it here."
The fact is that such activity does
occur. For every female proceeding
from one point on campus to anoth
er, there are the "untold evils lurking
behind every eucalyptus tree" that
Lempert so smugly scoffs at. We are
sure that the women whose lives
have been permanently scarred by
these attacks, as well as that portion
of the Stanford community that must
live under constant fear of such at
tacks, do not share Lempert's cavalier
attitude toward the security system
that protects their lives.
The goal of the campus police
force is to prevent attacks before
they occur. Apparently the police are
not making potential assailants as

nervous as they make Lempert. Until
they do, we fail to see any compelling
reason for curtailing security meas
ures on the Stanford campus.

Guard against violence
Angry yellow flyers appeared on
campus last week. They depict a
muscular woman kicking a cringing
man, whom the slogan implies is a
rapist.
I object to the violence of this im
age. Although this year's sexual as
saults have angered me, violence is
not the necessary expression of this
anger.
Rape must be confronted and de
feated. Women can take responsi
bility for their own safety and de
fense, and should be able to use vio
lence against an attacker. But vio
lence is not the way to end rape in
our society. Men and women must
work to change the attitudes that
promote rape.
One of those attitudes is the accep
tance of violence in our everyday
lives. In fighting rape, we must also
guard against seeing violence as the
cure and not the symptom.

I am writing to express my dis
satisfaction with the ballot for ASSU
elections (April 14), in particular the
wording of the fee assessment re
form proposals and the bills sub
mitted as amendments to the ASSU
constitution.
Concerning the amendments to
the constitutions, I found the bill
summaries to be terribly one-sided.
After reading each proposal, I felt I
should mark "yes" as if it were the
correct answer. I am not at all familiar
with the finer points of this docu
ment and, perhaps, these changes
are very much needed, as I was lead
to believe. Nonetheless. I hardly see
this as an appropriate manner in
which to amend it. If the ASSU wishes
to educate voters, I suggest they do it
in a more neutral fashion.
I also take issue with the wording
of the reform proposals for fee
assessments. Again, it is very clear
which option the ASSU would like us
to support, the one which "allows
groups to organize budgets and plan
definite programs" and which makes
small groups "more secure from loss
of money through refunds."
Personally, I only needed to know
points one and five of this option;
that no students are eligible for re
funds of student fees and that stu
dents decide which mandatory fees
are assessed through majority ap
proval or disapproval. The other
points were added to make the man
datory fee option appear more at

tractive. One might have added to
the alternative option that allowing
students to collect refunds protected
individuals' rights. Qr, that this meth
od of student control held the or
ganizations funded in this manner
more responsible to the electorate.
Were the fee assessments proposal
preventing student refunds not so
closely analogous to income tax
withholding, perhaps I would not
take the time to write. But something
which may seem fairly trivial on the
University scale indeed manifests
itself in much larger proportions
elsewhere in our society. Hence, I
feel that when considering new
methods of administering student
government each proposal be neu
trally and fairly presented on the
ballot.
Perhaps these objections I have
raised are problems unique to the
overseas ballots. Regardless, I would
hope that in the future the wording
of the ballot be more carefully con
sidered.
