# University hopes new system will solve computer problem
## 
### Kathy Olmsted Senior staff writer 
Officials at the Research Libraries Group (RLG) and the
Center for Information Technology (CIT) said they hope
the delivery here last Monday of an IBM 3081 computer
will help alleviate current problems involving the Uni
versity and RLG computer systems.
The unexpectedly large number of users, the lack of
adequate memory capacity and the contention factor
between diverse elements of the two programs led to an
extremely slow response time of the 3081 shared by the
RLG — a bibliographic research consortium based here
— and Stanford.
The slow response time inconvenienced the computer
users and led to large backlogs of uncatalogued books at
many of the universities, including Stanford, that use
RLG for bibliographic processing.
The new 3081 computer will be used solely by RLG,
thus freeing the current 3081 for exclusive use by the Uni
versity.
In January, RLG and Stanford combined their two sep
arate computing systems onto the single 3081 for finan
cial reasons. However, according to John Schroeder, di
rector of computer systems and services at RLG, the sin
gle computer did not have the capacity to handle the di
versity of programs and number of users of both pro-
HMMasing number of problems caused by the
ftn led to the resignation last month of RLG
Shaw, who has retained his University
positions as CIT director and associate provost for in
formation systems.
Shaw said in his letter of resignation to the board gov
ernors of RLG that he felt he no longer enjoyed "the trust
and confidence of this Board." Saying "it is not possible
to manage, much less lead, in such a circumstance,"
Shaw resigned the RLG presidency.
"The problems that we've had this year created an en
vironment in which the board ... felt that they needed a
change," Shaw told the Daily.
William Massy, vice president for business and fi
nance, said Shaw retains the "full confidence" of the
University administration, including President Donald
Kennedy.
Shaw admitted that he had "mis-projected" the de
mand for computer resources for the RLG and Stanford

communities but he refuted charges that the computer
sharing plan would not have worked even if the demand
hadn't been so heavy.
"The sharing was expected," he said. "There just
wasn't enough to share."
John Heyeck, director of fiscal and network affairs for
RLG, agreed that unexpected demand was part of the
cause of the problems.
"The growth was faster than we anticipated," he said.
Schroeder said the possibiltiy of contention between
the computer programs and the high growth rate were
not foreseen in December when the decision was made
to put both systems on the same computer. The decision
was made, he said, because officials thought that Stan
ford and RLG would be "no worse off technically and
better off financially" to use the same computer.
Heyeck praised Shaw for helping the RLG to grow into
a nationwide enterprise. But he said that some members
of RLG's Board of Governors, frustrated by the mounting
backlog problems, lost faith in Shaw's ability to handle
the situation.
Massy said that the University is prepared to loan RLG
$300,000 toward the lease or purchase of the new 3001
computer. The loan will serve as a prepayment for library
technical processing services, Massy said.
According to Shaw, the addition of the new computer
is the seventh step in a series of attempts to improve the
RLG's services to member universities. Earlier measures
have included instituting new disc and drum technogy
and modifying the software system, he said.
Schroeder said that RLG will further improve its pro
gram in 1983 either by buying a large uniprocessor more
powerful than the 3081 being leased currently, or by
changing the 3081 software to take full advantage of its
dual processors. RLG will continue to limit the number
of terminals each RLG member may use for nine months
in order to gradually absorb the existing backlog,
Schroeder said.
In the meantine, the backlogs are growing at the vari
ous member universities of RLG. Jim Myers, assistant di
rector for technical services of the University Libraries
System, said Stanford is meeting the problem by institut
ing an interim cataloguing system. Myers said this new
system would have a "minimal level of searching
capabilities" but that some sort of a supplement to RLG
was necessary.
