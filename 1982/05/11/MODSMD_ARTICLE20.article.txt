# TASK FORCE REPORT
## University officials voice concerns about concerts 
### Second in a series. by Adam Goodman 
Big name rock concerts may be big
business, but according to University of
ficials, they may also be big trouble for a
university such as Stanford.
"You should go into any encounter
with contemporary events with great cau
tion," warned Vicky Holt, director of the
University's Events and Services and chief
negotiator for University concerts.

'You should go into any
encounter with
contemporary events with
great caution .... The
nature of the business is
very different from
classical music. The
reputations of the
management and the
agencies are very, very
different/

"The nature of the business is very dif
ferent from classical music. The reputa
tions of the management and the agen
cies are very, very different. It's a very
risky business, very volatile. People are
more concerned about profits. It's a
rough business. It's not easy," Holt said.
Currently, Stanford concert policies are
designed by a University Committee on
Contemporary Entertainment (COCE).
The committee includes a concert sub

committee which evaluates and guides
student groups as well as an executive
committee which is designed to make
"rapid action" decisions.
The 11-member COCE is a student and
staff committee which Holt said is trying
to answer questions and solve problems
brought to light in last year's ASSU Task
Force Report on Special Events. Holt said
the major problems include the Univer
sity's accountability for legal, tax and safe
ty purposes as well as the discontinuity of
a student-producing group such as ASSU
Special Events.
"The University is accountable at a con
temporary event whether or not the Uni
versity is actually the producer. Second,
the University is under very strict sur
veillance by the county assessor In re
gards to the use.of our lands for what can
be perceived as non-educational
purposes. So any event that happens on
campus, no matter whether is is tem
porary or not, has to be evaluatedin light
of its effect on the tax implications of the
University," she said.
"The third issue is that any system that
we set up that only included students
couldn't provide any continuity or pro
fessional management in the production
process and in the course of that accord
ing to the analysis of the task force that is
the reason the money was lost in Special
Events.
"What we hoped to put up in the COCE
was a system and a format that would take
care of those three basic concerns, that it
would provide professional guidance and
advising, that it would give the University
enough information about what was

going on that we could evaluate the liabil
ity implications and also keep us out of
hot water on the taxes," she said.
Holt stressed the importance of having
a group such as the COCE to coordinate
the concert concerns of the University.
"For something as risky and as difficult to
manage as contemporary events this is a
good way to handle it," she said.
However, others have complained that
the University's procedure is too slow and
point to the fact that no major rock con
cert has been on campus since Jefferson
Starship two years ago. In fact Danny
Scher, a former director of Special Events
and current vice-president of the promot
ing agency Bill Graham Presents, called
the process "complicated" in an in
terview two weeks ago and said he could
not understand it. (Since then, Scher said
he has "come to understand the system"
through almost daily phone conversa
tions with Holt).
Holt defended the University's concert
approval process, "It's working fine. It's a
little slow at first because not everyone
has the information about how the proc
ess is supposed to work so groups are
coming to us at all stages." Holt said stu
dent groups should first talk to the COCE
when they are considering a contem
porary event, then make a preliminary
application, and if it is approved, finally
discuss specifics.
She pointed to the Stanford Band's at
tempt to bring Elton John to Stanford for a
concert, According to Holt, Band mem
bers first contacted Bill Graham Presents
before talking with the University com
mittee. "That's not a problem because

that's going to happen for awhile until
people know what the process is. But we
kind of had to put Graham on hold while
we ran the application through.
"The procedure is slow but you also
have to remember that when the Stanford
Band and the Chaparral brought their
preliminary applications in to us they also
all left for spring break. Part of the slow
ness of the process had nothing to do with
us. They were gone for 10 days and they
were gone/' Holt commented. "And the
process will get better."
The difficulties involved in the plan
ning and producing of a large rock con
cert are not University officials' only wor
ries, however.
According to Robert Beth, director of
risk management for the University and
member of the COCE, safety and legal
ities are the University's main concerns
for contemporary events on campus. Se
curity, traffic control and monitoring,
clean-up service and liability insurance
must all be considered, he said.
The size of the crowd seems to be the
biggest worry factor.
"It's all relative. Obviously an Elton
John or a Grateful Dead would generate
such a crowd and also generate a lot of a
cash," Beth said. "Obviously if it turned
into a Woodstock the University could
not cope with that."
Beth said the University's tax status
would probably not be put in jeopardy by
contemporary events as long as the event
was not "purely a moneymaker."He said
as long as the event could be shown to be
cultural, educational, or recreational
there would be "no problem."

For these events, Beth said the Univer
sity has a $300,000 deductible insurance
policy. "It's better for us to assume the
risk."
Beth said the University has had prob
lems with rock concerts in the past. He
said Frost Amphitheater can be especially
troublesome because people have fallen
out of trees and tripped over shrubbery at
past events. Security personnel also have

management.

to prevent altercations by keeping people
"separate and friendly."
"I'm sure there are people in the Uni
versity that think concerts are a hassle,"
Beth said. "People are so quick to sue in
this day and age. The mental set is to go
against the University so we do get a bit
paranoid."
