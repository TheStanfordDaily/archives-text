## 'Diner': the mysterious power of pop culture 
### Steve Vineberg 
There is a telling scene early
in Robert Altman's lovely, un
derrated California Split in
which the two gambler heroes,
played by George Segal and El
liott Gould, become ac
quainted in a nearly deserted
late-night bar. They feel each
other out by shooting trivia
questions at each other —
Gould asks Segal to name all of
Disney's seven dwarfs — and
when they are satisfied that
their minds hold the same
stores of pop cultural scraps,
they know they can be friends.
This scene is so funny because
we recognize our own ob
sessions in it; Altman depicts
our priorities with startling ac
curacy. We call the minutiae of
the music we grew up listening
to and the TV programs we
watched as kids and the comic
books we read and the movies
we've always loved "trivia",
but maybe we should find a
word that conveys how impor
tant they really are; merged as
they have been with our mem
ories and the unfulfilled de
sires that we associate with
them, these bits of trivia are
pieces of our past and thus of
our identities.
Barry Levinson, who based
his wonderful picture Diner on
his own past — it is set in Balti
more around Christmas of

-1959, when a group of men in
their early 20s gather to
celebrate the wedding of one
of them and to send off the
decade that saw their
adolescence — understands
the highly emotionally charged
nature of trivia. It colors the
movie as it illuminates the lives
of its characters. Eddie (Steve
Guttenberg), the groom-to-be,
has stipulated that he won't
marry his fiance unless she
passes a football quiz he has
prepared for her. Shrevie
(Daniel Stern) quarrels with his
wife Beth (Ellen Barkin) be
cause she refuses to treat his
fastidiously catalogued record
collection with reverence.
Fenwick (Kevin Bacon)
watches C.E. College Bowl and
beats every contestant to the
buzzer. Boogie (Mickey
Rourke) pounds his fist against
the side of his car when he
learns that his favorite team has
lost a game. Each of these im
ages resonates in an almost
novelistic manner: we become
conscious of other layers of
meaning — that Eddie is setting
hurdles in the path of his wed
ding because he is terrified of
marriage, that Shrevie's ex
plosion is an expression of the
gulf between him and Beth,
that Fenwick, who dropped
out of college, is wasting a
sharply honed intelligence. But

what binds these scenes to
gether is a common theme: the
passion these guys feel for their
pop cultural heritage.
We've all felt this irrational
kind of passion; even if we
don't administer quizzes to our
potential mates, we do de
mand the impossible of them:
that they both complement us
and match our own en
thusiasms — be, in other
words, our other selves and a
reflection of us at the same
time. When Shrevie yells at
Beth because she doesn't know
who Charlie Parker is, he is
crying out against a denial of
part of himself; he feels that
marriage threatens to sub
merge his identity. Music is the
absolute against which the
young men in Diner measure
everything that transpires in
their lives. Shrevie recalls what
song was playing on the
jukebox when he walked into
the dance, five years earlier,
where he first met Beth, and
Eddie leads an argument about
who is the greatest singer of the
era (Sinatra and johnny Mathis
are the prime contenders) that
turns on their reminiscences of
which one they made out to in
high school. (I've heard my
brothers' friends, also children
of the '50s, hold almost the
identical discussion.) The mu-
