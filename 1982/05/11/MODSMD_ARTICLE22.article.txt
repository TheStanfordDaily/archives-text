## 'Diner': the mysterious power of pop culture 
### Steve Vineberg 
There is a telling scene early
in Robert Altman's lovely, un
derrated California Split in
which the two gambler heroes,
played by George Segal and El
liott Gould, become ac
quainted in a nearly deserted
late-night bar. They feel each
other out by shooting trivia
questions at each other —
Gould asks Segal to name all of
Disney's seven dwarfs — and
when they are satisfied that
their minds hold the same
stores of pop cultural scraps,
they know they can be friends.
This scene is so funny because
we recognize our own ob
sessions in it; Altman depicts
our priorities with startling ac
curacy. We call the minutiae of
the music we grew up listening
to and the TV programs we
watched as kids and the comic
books we read and the movies
we've always loved "trivia",
but maybe we should find a
word that conveys how impor
tant they really are; merged as
they have been with our mem
ories and the unfulfilled de
sires that we associate with
them, these bits of trivia are
pieces of our past and thus of
our identities.
Barry Levinson, who based
his wonderful picture Diner on
his own past — it is set in Balti
more around Christmas of

-1959, when a group of men in
their early 20s gather to
celebrate the wedding of one
of them and to send off the
decade that saw their
adolescence — understands
the highly emotionally charged
nature of trivia. It colors the
movie as it illuminates the lives
of its characters. Eddie (Steve
Guttenberg), the groom-to-be,
has stipulated that he won't
marry his fiance unless she
passes a football quiz he has
prepared for her. Shrevie
(Daniel Stern) quarrels with his
wife Beth (Ellen Barkin) be
cause she refuses to treat his
fastidiously catalogued record
collection with reverence.
Fenwick (Kevin Bacon)
watches C.E. College Bowl and
beats every contestant to the
buzzer. Boogie (Mickey
Rourke) pounds his fist against
the side of his car when he
learns that his favorite team has
lost a game. Each of these im
ages resonates in an almost
novelistic manner: we become
conscious of other layers of
meaning — that Eddie is setting
hurdles in the path of his wed
ding because he is terrified of
marriage, that Shrevie's ex
plosion is an expression of the
gulf between him and Beth,
that Fenwick, who dropped
out of college, is wasting a
sharply honed intelligence. But

what binds these scenes to
gether is a common theme: the
passion these guys feel for their
pop cultural heritage.
We've all felt this irrational
kind of passion; even if we
don't administer quizzes to our
potential mates, we do de
mand the impossible of them:
that they both complement us
and match our own en
thusiasms — be, in other
words, our other selves and a
reflection of us at the same
time. When Shrevie yells at
Beth because she doesn't know
who Charlie Parker is, he is
crying out against a denial of
part of himself; he feels that
marriage threatens to sub
merge his identity. Music is the
absolute against which the
young men in Diner measure
everything that transpires in
their lives. Shrevie recalls what
song was playing on the
jukebox when he walked into
the dance, five years earlier,
where he first met Beth, and
Eddie leads an argument about
who is the greatest singer of the
era (Sinatra and johnny Mathis
are the prime contenders) that
turns on their reminiscences of
which one they made out to in
high school. (I've heard my
brothers' friends, also children
of the '50s, hold almost the
identical discussion.) The mu-


Larry Maslon/Daily
sic of this decade dominates
the soundtrack — Chuck Berry,
Bobby Vinton, Jerry Lee Lewis,
Tommy Edwards, The Dell-Vik
ings — and when the guys sing
along, they throw themselves
into the choruses with a fierce
ness everyone in the audience
must recognize. After his fight
with Beth, Shrevie drives alone
through the streets of the city,
pouring his broken heart into
the silly lyrics of the songs he
hears on the radio. (Movie
buffs fond of making connec
tions may think of Pennies
from Heaven and the ineffah'e
scene in Shoot the Moon in
which Diane Keaton sings "If I
Fell" to herself in the bathtub.)
Diner — the title refers to the
favorite neighborhood hang
out, where much of the movie
takes place — is the best kind of
period piece; it never sinks
into nostalgia, like American
Graffiti did, because every de
tail in it seems deeply felt.
Levinson wrote dialogue that is
clearly faithful to the idiom of
the time; even when you don't
recognize the catch phrases
("It's a smile," to describe a
pleasurable experience, or the
ultimate tribute to a woman,
"She is death"), you know they
must be authentic. Characters'
idiosyncrasies feel right, too,
like* Boogie's pouring sugar
from a glass shaker into his
mouth and washing it down
with coke. And Levinson gets
every setting perfect — not
only the diner, but also a pool
hall, a dance hall, an electrical
appliance store, a Jewish wed
ding. One of the pleasures the
movie offers us is in in watch
ing the way the characters re
late to these locales and how
they use them to inspire or
complete the routines that
make up the fabric of their

lives. Eddie and Modell (Paul
Reiser) transform a dispute
over a roast beef sandwich into
a sketch worthy of Laurel and
Hardy, and later on the guys
cheer on a hefty diner regular
who, to their delight, de
molishes several meals at a sit
ting. Eddie comes by his comic
gifts honestly: his mother
(Jessica James), fond of playing
dramatic games herself, chases
him around the kitchen wield
ing a knife when he demands
to be fed lunch in mid-after
noon, while he eggs her on like
a cartoon bullfighter. Even the
serious exchanges in these
people's lives have the self
consciousness of staged bits.
When Billy (Timothy Daly)
learns that his girl friend
Barbara (Kathryn Dowling) is
pregnant, they talk in the
slightly stilted rhythms of the
television melodramas of the
period, and when Boogie asks
Beth out (she is an old flame),
they sound like a replay of
something they've absorbed
from the movies. (Levinson
shows us enough footage of A
Summer Place and a TV soap
opera to suggest at least two
possible sources.)
The acting in Diner has the
kind of verisimilitude we usual
ly find in great documentaries
like Frederick Wiseman's.
Michael Tucker, who plays a
middle-aged diner hanger-on
named Bagel, a neighborhood
sage with a genuine interest in
these boys' futures, takes a
long, tight close-up that would
break down many another
good actor and doesn't lose
hold of his character for an ins
tant. The comedy routines and
trivia matches have such im
mediacy that we really can be
lieve they form the texture of
the boys' lives — this is im
provisation with miraculous

timing. Levinson coaxed a
peerless set of performances
from his cast, and he's made
some terrific discoveries too; I
only recognized two of the ac
tors. Daniel Stern was the tall,
wry jokester in Breaking Away
who claimed he kept flunking
college admissions tests to grat
ify his understanding father; in
the difficult role of Shrevie, he
demonstrates more depth than
Breaking Away allowed him,
and he even sounds different
— like a male Jodie Foster.
Levinson gives him a mono
logue about marriage that is as
challenging (and, in its more
restricted idiomatic style, as
well written) as Dennis Quaid's
speech in Breaking Away about
his failed dreams of athletic
glory, and Stern provides a
beautifully muted reading of it.
Mickey Rourke, whose in
tensity in his one scene in Body
Heat (where he played an
arsonist) exposed the rest of
the picture as hopelessly syn
thetic, makes debt-ridden
Boogie an irresistible charmer.
Like the Warren Beatty charac
ter in Shampoo, his job in a
beauty parlor seems an em
bodiment of his love for wom
en, and it is a treat to watch him
in action whenhe wants to turn
one of them on. Steve Gutten
berg has a rubbery face that he
can manipulate into
marvelous shapes, and the
funniest belligerent attitude
since Oliver Hardy. Kevin
Bacon, whose voice sounds as
if too many binges had sliced
the top layer off his larynx,
plays the unhappiest of the
group, Fenwick — whose pa
rents have disowned him be
cause he won't go to school
and won't work in the family
business — with enough wit to
keep him unpredictable; it's a
booby-trapped role, but Bacon

steers clear of the potential
sentimentality in it. Timothy
Daly's Billy has a closed, un
readable face, but he uses it to
advantage by hiding reserves
of sensitivity and aggression in
the character that continually
surprise us. As Beth, Ellen
Barkin gives a tough consistent
performance; she lets us see
why both Shrevie and Boogie
would be attracted to her.
Barry Levinson used to write
for The Carol Burnett Show,
and he's listed in the credits of
a couple of Mel Brooks pic
tures, Silent Movie and High
Anxiety; in collaboration with
Valerie Curtin, he wrote two of
the worst scripts of the last few
years, . . . And Justice for All
and Inside Moves. Yet Diner,
his first film as a director, is a
great American comedy and
perhaps the most sensuous and
complexly funny rites of pas
sage movie ever made in this
country. If you go to the mov
ies regularly, you may begin to
wonder what the hell is going
on when the latest work of
Francis Coppola and Bernardo
Bertolucci is just dreadful and
some of the best new movies
come from people you'd given
up on, like Herbert Ross (Pen
nies from Heaven), or never
thought much of like Alan
Parker (Shoot the Moon).
There's no apparent reason for
this switch — just as there's no
reason why, in the midst of a
terrible period when movies
threaten to practically become
television, we should suddenly
have a raft of good films like
Shoot the Moon, Personal Best,
Three Brothers, Quest for Fire,
Das Boot, and now Diner. Mov
ies defeat our efforts to predict
and categorize them; and a pic
ture like Diner justifies our
faith in them.

some of the best new movies
come from people you'd given
up on, like Herbert Ross (Pen
nies from Heaven), or never
thought much of like Alan
Parker (Shoot the Moon).
There's no apparent reason for
this switch — just as there's no
reason why, in the midst of a
terrible period when movies
threaten to practically become
television, we should suddenly
have a raft of good films like
Shoot the Moon, Personal Best,
Three Brothers, Quest for Fire,
Das Boot, and now Diner. Mov
ies defeat our efforts to predict
and categorize them; and a pic
ture like Diner justifies our
faith in them.
There is a telling scene early
in Robert Altman's lovely, un
derrated California Split in
which the two gambler heroes,
played by George Segal and El
liott Gould, become ac
quainted in a nearly deserted
late-night bar. They feel each
other out by shooting trivia
questions at each other —
Gould asks Segal to name all of
Disney's seven dwarfs — and
when they are satisfied that
their minds hold the same
stores of pop cultural scraps,
they know they can be friends.
This scene is so funny because
we recognize our own ob
sessions in it; Altman depicts
our priorities with startling ac
curacy. We call the minutiae of
the music we grew up listening
to and the TV programs we
watched as kids and the comic
books we read and the movies
we've always loved "trivia",
but maybe we should find a
word that conveys how impor
tant they really are; merged as
they have been with our mem
ories and the unfulfilled de
sires that we associate with
them, these bits of trivia are
pieces of our past and thus of
our identities.
Barry Levinson, who based
his wonderful picture Diner on
his own past — it is set in Balti
more around Christmas of

-1959, when a group of men in
their early 20s gather to
celebrate the wedding of one
of them and to send off the
decade that saw their
adolescence — understands
the highly emotionally charged
nature of trivia. It colors the
movie as it illuminates the lives
of its characters. Eddie (Steve
Guttenberg), the groom-to-be,
has stipulated that he won't
marry his fiance unless she
passes a football quiz he has
prepared for her. Shrevie
(Daniel Stern) quarrels with his
wife Beth (Ellen Barkin) be
cause she refuses to treat his
fastidiously catalogued record
collection with reverence.
Fenwick (Kevin Bacon)
watches C.E. College Bowl and
beats every contestant to the
buzzer. Boogie (Mickey
Rourke) pounds his fist against
the side of his car when he
learns that his favorite team has
lost a game. Each of these im
ages resonates in an almost
novelistic manner: we become
conscious of other layers of
meaning — that Eddie is setting
hurdles in the path of his wed
ding because he is terrified of
marriage, that Shrevie's ex
plosion is an expression of the
gulf between him and Beth,
that Fenwick, who dropped
out of college, is wasting a
sharply honed intelligence. But

what binds these scenes to
gether is a common theme: the
passion these guys feel for their
pop cultural heritage.
We've all felt this irrational
kind of passion; even if we
don't administer quizzes to our
potential mates, we do de
mand the impossible of them:
that they both complement us
and match our own en
thusiasms — be, in other
words, our other selves and a
reflection of us at the same
time. When Shrevie yells at
Beth because she doesn't know
who Charlie Parker is, he is
crying out against a denial of
part of himself; he feels that
marriage threatens to sub
merge his identity. Music is the
absolute against which the
young men in Diner measure
everything that transpires in
their lives. Shrevie recalls what
song was playing on the
jukebox when he walked into
the dance, five years earlier,
where he first met Beth, and
Eddie leads an argument about
who is the greatest singer of the
era (Sinatra and johnny Mathis
are the prime contenders) that
turns on their reminiscences of
which one they made out to in
high school. (I've heard my
brothers' friends, also children
of the '50s, hold almost the
identical discussion.) The mu-


Larry Maslon/Daily
sic of this decade dominates
the soundtrack — Chuck Berry,
Bobby Vinton, Jerry Lee Lewis,
Tommy Edwards, The Dell-Vik
ings — and when the guys sing
along, they throw themselves
into the choruses with a fierce
ness everyone in the audience
must recognize. After his fight
with Beth, Shrevie drives alone
through the streets of the city,
pouring his broken heart into
the silly lyrics of the songs he
hears on the radio. (Movie
buffs fond of making connec
tions may think of Pennies
from Heaven and the ineffah'e
scene in Shoot the Moon in
which Diane Keaton sings "If I
Fell" to herself in the bathtub.)
Diner — the title refers to the
favorite neighborhood hang
out, where much of the movie
takes place — is the best kind of
period piece; it never sinks
into nostalgia, like American
Graffiti did, because every de
tail in it seems deeply felt.
Levinson wrote dialogue that is
clearly faithful to the idiom of
the time; even when you don't
recognize the catch phrases
("It's a smile," to describe a
pleasurable experience, or the
ultimate tribute to a woman,
"She is death"), you know they
must be authentic. Characters'
idiosyncrasies feel right, too,
like* Boogie's pouring sugar
from a glass shaker into his
mouth and washing it down
with coke. And Levinson gets
every setting perfect — not
only the diner, but also a pool
hall, a dance hall, an electrical
appliance store, a Jewish wed
ding. One of the pleasures the
movie offers us is in in watch
ing the way the characters re
late to these locales and how
they use them to inspire or
complete the routines that
make up the fabric of their

lives. Eddie and Modell (Paul
Reiser) transform a dispute
over a roast beef sandwich into
a sketch worthy of Laurel and
Hardy, and later on the guys
cheer on a hefty diner regular
who, to their delight, de
molishes several meals at a sit
ting. Eddie comes by his comic
gifts honestly: his mother
(Jessica James), fond of playing
dramatic games herself, chases
him around the kitchen wield
ing a knife when he demands
to be fed lunch in mid-after
noon, while he eggs her on like
a cartoon bullfighter. Even the
serious exchanges in these
people's lives have the self
consciousness of staged bits.
When Billy (Timothy Daly)
learns that his girl friend
Barbara (Kathryn Dowling) is
pregnant, they talk in the
slightly stilted rhythms of the
television melodramas of the
period, and when Boogie asks
Beth out (she is an old flame),
they sound like a replay of
something they've absorbed
from the movies. (Levinson
shows us enough footage of A
Summer Place and a TV soap
opera to suggest at least two
possible sources.)
The acting in Diner has the
kind of verisimilitude we usual
ly find in great documentaries
like Frederick Wiseman's.
Michael Tucker, who plays a
middle-aged diner hanger-on
named Bagel, a neighborhood
sage with a genuine interest in
these boys' futures, takes a
long, tight close-up that would
break down many another
good actor and doesn't lose
hold of his character for an ins
tant. The comedy routines and
trivia matches have such im
mediacy that we really can be
lieve they form the texture of
the boys' lives — this is im
provisation with miraculous

timing. Levinson coaxed a
peerless set of performances
from his cast, and he's made
some terrific discoveries too; I
only recognized two of the ac
tors. Daniel Stern was the tall,
wry jokester in Breaking Away
who claimed he kept flunking
college admissions tests to grat
ify his understanding father; in
the difficult role of Shrevie, he
demonstrates more depth than
Breaking Away allowed him,
and he even sounds different
— like a male Jodie Foster.
Levinson gives him a mono
logue about marriage that is as
challenging (and, in its more
restricted idiomatic style, as
well written) as Dennis Quaid's
speech in Breaking Away about
his failed dreams of athletic
glory, and Stern provides a
beautifully muted reading of it.
Mickey Rourke, whose in
tensity in his one scene in Body
Heat (where he played an
arsonist) exposed the rest of
the picture as hopelessly syn
thetic, makes debt-ridden
Boogie an irresistible charmer.
Like the Warren Beatty charac
ter in Shampoo, his job in a
beauty parlor seems an em
bodiment of his love for wom
en, and it is a treat to watch him
in action whenhe wants to turn
one of them on. Steve Gutten
berg has a rubbery face that he
can manipulate into
marvelous shapes, and the
funniest belligerent attitude
since Oliver Hardy. Kevin
Bacon, whose voice sounds as
if too many binges had sliced
the top layer off his larynx,
plays the unhappiest of the
group, Fenwick — whose pa
rents have disowned him be
cause he won't go to school
and won't work in the family
business — with enough wit to
keep him unpredictable; it's a
booby-trapped role, but Bacon

steers clear of the potential
sentimentality in it. Timothy
Daly's Billy has a closed, un
readable face, but he uses it to
advantage by hiding reserves
of sensitivity and aggression in
the character that continually
surprise us. As Beth, Ellen
Barkin gives a tough consistent
performance; she lets us see
why both Shrevie and Boogie
would be attracted to her.
Barry Levinson used to write
for The Carol Burnett Show,
and he's listed in the credits of
a couple of Mel Brooks pic
tures, Silent Movie and High
Anxiety; in collaboration with
Valerie Curtin, he wrote two of
the worst scripts of the last few
years, . . . And Justice for All
and Inside Moves. Yet Diner,
his first film as a director, is a
great American comedy and
perhaps the most sensuous and
complexly funny rites of pas
sage movie ever made in this
country. If you go to the mov
ies regularly, you may begin to
wonder what the hell is going
on when the latest work of
Francis Coppola and Bernardo
Bertolucci is just dreadful and
some of the best new movies
come from people you'd given
up on, like Herbert Ross (Pen

a couple of Mel Brooks pic
tures, Silent Movie and High
Anxiety; in collaboration with
Valerie Curtin, he wrote two of
the worst scripts of the last few
years, . . . And Justice for All
and Inside Moves. Yet Diner,
his first film as a director, is a
great American comedy and
perhaps the most sensuous and
complexly funny rites of pas
sage movie ever made in this
country. If you go to the mov
ies regularly, you may begin to
wonder what the hell is going
on when the latest work of
Francis Coppola and Bernardo
Bertolucci is just dreadful and
some of the best new movies
come from people you'd given
up on, like Herbert Ross (Pen
nies from Heaven), or never
thought much of like Alan
Parker (Shoot the Moon).
There's no apparent reason for
this switch — just as there's no
reason why, in the midst of a
terrible period when movies
threaten to practically become
television, we should suddenly
have a raft of good films like
Shoot the Moon, Personal Best,
Three Brothers, Quest for Fire,
Das Boot, and now Diner. Mov

faith in them.
There is a telling scene early
in Robert Altman's lovely, un
derrated California Split in
which the two gambler heroes,
played by George Segal and El
liott Gould, become ac
quainted in a nearly deserted
late-night bar. They feel each
other out by shooting trivia
questions at each other —
Gould asks Segal to name all of
Disney's seven dwarfs — and
when they are satisfied that
their minds hold the same
stores of pop cultural scraps,
they know they can be friends.
This scene is so funny because
we recognize our own ob
sessions in it; Altman depicts
our priorities with startling ac
curacy. We call the minutiae of
the music we grew up listening
to and the TV programs we
watched as kids and the comic
books we read and the movies
we've always loved "trivia",
but maybe we should find a
word that conveys how impor
tant they really are; merged as
they have been with our mem
ories and the unfulfilled de
sires that we associate with
them, these bits of trivia are
pieces of our past and thus of
our identities.
Barry Levinson, who based
his wonderful picture Diner on
his own past — it is set in Balti
more around Christmas of

-1959, when a group of men in
their early 20s gather to
celebrate the wedding of one
of them and to send off the
decade that saw their
adolescence — understands
the highly emotionally charged
nature of trivia. It colors the
movie as it illuminates the lives
of its characters. Eddie (Steve
Guttenberg), the groom-to-be,
has stipulated that he won't
marry his fiance unless she
passes a football quiz he has
prepared for her. Shrevie
(Daniel Stern) quarrels with his
wife Beth (Ellen Barkin) be
cause she refuses to treat his
fastidiously catalogued record
collection with reverence.
Fenwick (Kevin Bacon)
watches C.E. College Bowl and
beats every contestant to the
buzzer. Boogie (Mickey
Rourke) pounds his fist against
the side of his car when he
learns that his favorite team has
lost a game. Each of these im
ages resonates in an almost
novelistic manner: we become
conscious of other layers of
meaning — that Eddie is setting
hurdles in the path of his wed
ding because he is terrified of
marriage, that Shrevie's ex
plosion is an expression of the
gulf between him and Beth,
that Fenwick, who dropped
out of college, is wasting a
sharply honed intelligence. But

what binds these scenes to
gether is a common theme: the
passion these guys feel for their
pop cultural heritage.
We've all felt this irrational
kind of passion; even if we
don't administer quizzes to our
potential mates, we do de
mand the impossible of them:
that they both complement us
and match our own en
thusiasms — be, in other
words, our other selves and a
reflection of us at the same
time. When Shrevie yells at
Beth because she doesn't know
who Charlie Parker is, he is
crying out against a denial of
part of himself; he feels that
marriage threatens to sub
merge his identity. Music is the
absolute against which the
young men in Diner measure
everything that transpires in
their lives. Shrevie recalls what
song was playing on the
jukebox when he walked into
the dance, five years earlier,
where he first met Beth, and
Eddie leads an argument about
who is the greatest singer of the
era (Sinatra and johnny Mathis
are the prime contenders) that
turns on their reminiscences of
which one they made out to in
high school. (I've heard my
brothers' friends, also children
of the '50s, hold almost the
identical discussion.) The mu-


Larry Maslon/Daily
sic of this decade dominates
the soundtrack — Chuck Berry,
Bobby Vinton, Jerry Lee Lewis,
Tommy Edwards, The Dell-Vik
ings — and when the guys sing
along, they throw themselves
into the choruses with a fierce
ness everyone in the audience
must recognize. After his fight
with Beth, Shrevie drives alone
through the streets of the city,
pouring his broken heart into
the silly lyrics of the songs he
hears on the radio. (Movie
buffs fond of making connec
tions may think of Pennies
from Heaven and the ineffah'e
scene in Shoot the Moon in
which Diane Keaton sings "If I
Fell" to herself in the bathtub.)
Diner — the title refers to the
favorite neighborhood hang
out, where much of the movie
takes place — is the best kind of
period piece; it never sinks
into nostalgia, like American
Graffiti did, because every de
tail in it seems deeply felt.
Levinson wrote dialogue that is
clearly faithful to the idiom of
the time; even when you don't
recognize the catch phrases
("It's a smile," to describe a
pleasurable experience, or the
ultimate tribute to a woman,
"She is death"), you know they
must be authentic. Characters'
idiosyncrasies feel right, too,
like* Boogie's pouring sugar
from a glass shaker into his
mouth and washing it down
with coke. And Levinson gets
every setting perfect — not
only the diner, but also a pool
hall, a dance hall, an electrical
appliance store, a Jewish wed
ding. One of the pleasures the
movie offers us is in in watch
ing the way the characters re
late to these locales and how
they use them to inspire or
complete the routines that
make up the fabric of their

lives. Eddie and Modell (Paul
Reiser) transform a dispute
over a roast beef sandwich into
a sketch worthy of Laurel and
Hardy, and later on the guys
cheer on a hefty diner regular
who, to their delight, de
molishes several meals at a sit
ting. Eddie comes by his comic
gifts honestly: his mother
(Jessica James), fond of playing
dramatic games herself, chases
him around the kitchen wield
ing a knife when he demands
to be fed lunch in mid-after
noon, while he eggs her on like
a cartoon bullfighter. Even the
serious exchanges in these
people's lives have the self
consciousness of staged bits.
When Billy (Timothy Daly)
learns that his girl friend
Barbara (Kathryn Dowling) is
pregnant, they talk in the
slightly stilted rhythms of the
television melodramas of the
period, and when Boogie asks
Beth out (she is an old flame),
they sound like a replay of
something they've absorbed
from the movies. (Levinson
shows us enough footage of A
Summer Place and a TV soap
opera to suggest at least two
possible sources.)
The acting in Diner has the
kind of verisimilitude we usual
ly find in great documentaries
like Frederick Wiseman's.
Michael Tucker, who plays a
middle-aged diner hanger-on
named Bagel, a neighborhood
sage with a genuine interest in
these boys' futures, takes a
long, tight close-up that would
break down many another
good actor and doesn't lose
hold of his character for an ins
tant. The comedy routines and
trivia matches have such im
mediacy that we really can be
lieve they form the texture of
the boys' lives — this is im
provisation with miraculous

timing. Levinson coaxed a
peerless set of performances
from his cast, and he's made
some terrific discoveries too; I
only recognized two of the ac
tors. Daniel Stern was the tall,
wry jokester in Breaking Away
who claimed he kept flunking
college admissions tests to grat
ify his understanding father; in
the difficult role of Shrevie, he
demonstrates more depth than
Breaking Away allowed him,
and he even sounds different
— like a male Jodie Foster.
Levinson gives him a mono
logue about marriage that is as
challenging (and, in its more
restricted idiomatic style, as
well written) as Dennis Quaid's
speech in Breaking Away about
his failed dreams of athletic
glory, and Stern provides a
beautifully muted reading of it.
Mickey Rourke, whose in
tensity in his one scene in Body
Heat (where he played an
arsonist) exposed the rest of
the picture as hopelessly syn
thetic, makes debt-ridden
Boogie an irresistible charmer.
Like the Warren Beatty charac
ter in Shampoo, his job in a
beauty parlor seems an em
bodiment of his love for wom
en, and it is a treat to watch him
in action whenhe wants to turn
one of them on. Steve Gutten
berg has a rubbery face that he
can manipulate into
marvelous shapes, and the
funniest belligerent attitude
since Oliver Hardy. Kevin
Bacon, whose voice sounds as
if too many binges had sliced
the top layer off his larynx,
plays the unhappiest of the
group, Fenwick — whose pa
rents have disowned him be
cause he won't go to school
and won't work in the family
business — with enough wit to
keep him unpredictable; it's a
booby-trapped role, but Bacon

steers clear of the potential
sentimentality in it. Timothy
Daly's Billy has a closed, un
readable face, but he uses it to
advantage by hiding reserves
of sensitivity and aggression in
the character that continually
surprise us. As Beth, Ellen
Barkin gives a tough consistent
performance; she lets us see
why both Shrevie and Boogie
would be attracted to her.
