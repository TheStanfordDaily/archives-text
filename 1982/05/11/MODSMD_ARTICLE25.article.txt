# The 						Imperials: Gospel group moves toward light, new style
## 
### David Schmelzer 
The Imperials are an old band trying to ad
just to a new style in music. This struggle
showed in their concert Apr. 27 at the San
Jose Center for the Performing Arts, in which
they jettisoned their old white suits and much
of their Southern gospel music in favor of a
more casual look and light pop songs.
Their "contemporary" selections are slick
and professional, produced by multi-Gram
my winner Michael Omartian (Christopher
Cross, Boz Scaggs, and others) and primarily
written by Omartian and his lyricist wife,
Stormie.
The news songs may be too slick for their
Christian message to make any kind of an im
pact, however. Omartian's synthesizer-domi
nated music is pleasant, but never powerful
or memorable and Stormie Omartian hasn't
yet refined her writing, relying mainly on
broad metaphors ("The Trumpet of Jesus") or
on happy, but not particularly provocative
messages ("I'm forgiven/Now I have a reason
for livin'/jesus keeps givin' and givin' "). The
music is agreeable, but until they give its au
dience more credit and make an effort to
show some insight, it won't endure.
This style carries over into the Imperials'
stage manner. While they got into more seri
ous issues later, the first part of their show was
spent in a forced, contrived effort to make
the crowd feel that they were friends with the
guys on stage. The idea was fine, but they ex
ecuted it as if the audience were a class of
third-graders.
They spent a phenomenally long period of
time getting everyone in the several
thousand person crowd to shout their home
towns. They went through a pointless bit in
which one band-member complimented an
other on the way he sang a lead vocal and
then complimented him again and then com
plimented him once more, until the audience
finally caught on that they were to shout en
couragement at this guy, too. And they did an
overlong, broadly staged bit that led into the
questionably important fact that one of the
singers played the cow bell.
In fairness, the audience responded en

thusiastically to each of these, good-nature
dly shouting quips back at the stage. But peo
ple always love to be manipulated; Real Peo
ple still draws big audiences and crowds still
scream happily when rock stars yell "I love
San Francisco!" in the place of talking hon
estly to them. â€¢
The four man group does sing well. Their
harmonies are helped by having one very
deep, very good bass, and one Viennese-
Boys-Choir-high tenor in the band, along
with two baritones.
New lead singer Paul Smith does a good
enough impression of their old lead singer to
fit in well, and he gives some youthful spirit to
a band that needs it, as the other three mem
bers are nearing middle age.
After about 30 minutes, the group took a
short break. When they came back they were
more serious, singing more of their older
songs and talking about issues like Biblical
perspectives of the Falkland Islands dispute,
rather than about the intricacies of mastering
the cow bell.
Even here they did not just sit down and
talk honestly to the audience. While they had
the courage to deal with problems of under
standing God's will and even of knowing Cod
at all, they used gimmicks when they did so.
As one of them spoke, the piano and the syn
thesizers would play softly behind him, get
ting louder and more intense as the speaker
got "angry" or "emotional" and softening
when he got "reflective."
They also asked the audience to repeat a
prayer which they dictated (in case some
people didn't know how to pray but wanted
to, they said).
Their sincerity and their message came
through even in the prayer. They said they
performed not for themselves but to bring
the praise of God to audiences. By encourag
ing the audience to sing and pray with them,
they did more than just keep the spotlight on
themselves. To keep this focus they didn't
end the show with one of their pop numbers,
but, instead, did an older gospel singalong,
"Praise the Lord."
