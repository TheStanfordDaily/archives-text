should submit a written declaration to the editor.
The traditional grilling of candidates will occur at a
staff lunch this Thursday at noon. All staffers are
strongly encouraged to attend: grilling sessions are
your chance to question candidates about their plat
forms and ideas about the Daily. Besides, it's your
chance to ask the toughest questions you can think of
so you can watch the candidates sweat.
