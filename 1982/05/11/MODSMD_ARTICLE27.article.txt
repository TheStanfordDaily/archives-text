# Profs disagree on ties with industry

### Michael Weiss 
A dispute about the nature of the relationship that
should exist between universities and industry arose
between Electrical Engineering Prof. John Linvill and
Assoc. History Prof. Barton Bernstein during a panel
discussion here yesterday.
Bernstein said that as universities and industry have
grown more closely entwined, there has been less ob
jectivity in judgements about research priorities. "It is
not clear that the individuals involved are the best
judges of the prospects," he said.
Linvill said that preparing people for jobs is at least
one of the businesses of the university, and that mar
ket presence was necessary to gauge the type of man
power that is needed.
Linvill is the director of the Center for Integrated
Systems, the $14 million research center for electronic
devices which is being partially funded by 17 private
companies. "At the center, we respond to op
portunities for increasing the workforce of a sector of
the economy," he said.
Bernstein said the great attention given to the high
ly profitable biotechnology field has created an
awareness of the growing pattern of private funding
in universities. He pointed out that the relationship of
faculty to business has also changed.
"Previously, there were consulting and equity rela
tionships. Now there is entrepeneurship," he said.
He said people must begin to ask "Who owns
knowledge?" and then ask whether those who have

control are serving the best interest of the university
and of the nation. "The issue is what kind of restraints,
what kind of accountability should prevail."
Bernstein suggested that since science departments
gave better job preparation than humanities depart
ments, they might be receiving more attention in
terms of fund allocations, which could result in the
commercial sector playing a very important role in
determining university priorities.
He suggested that there be a regular public address
by the university about fund allocations to the dif
ferent departments.
Linvill, who invented and then marketed Optacon,
a device which enables the blind to read through tac
tile sensations, said that it is possible tor students, fac
ulty and society to gain from the university-industry
relationship.According to Linvill, society enjoys the
results of research which could not be done without
industry help, and students benefit by becoming bet
ter prepared for careers.
Geophysics Prof. Jon Claerbout, who said that he
turned down a chance to become a millionare by not
going into the oil industry in 1973, said he felt strongly
that there should not be regulations on the rela
tionship between faculty and graduate students. He
said that when faculty go into business with graduate
students, such as in situations where theysplitthe rev
enues from a lecture series, all parties can gain. "Uni
versities can become famous from these activities,"
he said.
