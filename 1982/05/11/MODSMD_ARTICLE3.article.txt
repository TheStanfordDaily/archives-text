Criticizing many heterosexuals' mistreatment of gay
and lesbian people, Asst. Dean of Memorial Church
Donald Caughey kicked off a Gay and Lesbian Aware
ness Week noon rally in White Plaza yesterday.
The Gay and Lesbian Alliance at Stanford (GLAS), for
merly known as the Gay People's Union produced the
event, which brought about 100 people to hear
Caughey, Asst. Dean of Students Patricia Brandt and the
Choral Majority of San Francisco.
Caughey called for awareness of gay and lesbian peo
ple. "We need to be able to reach out to a lot more peo
ple ... They shouldn't have to hide out," he said.
He blamed heterosexual intolerance for the present
environment. "It is not the victimized or the hated who
constitute the problem," he said. "It is the way we regard
sexuality and power."
Brandt emphasized two key issues: morality and an
environment for gays and lesbians here.
She pointed out that married student housing here is
prohibited for gay and lesbian couples, and suggested
that this policy be reevaluated. "Most issues addressed
by therapy must also be addressed by social change," she
said.
Caughey also addressed the relationship between the
church and gay people. "Neither the Bible nor any au
thority in the church can justify the mistreatment of gay
and lesbian people," he said. "Ask yourself finally how
and why faith in God's love is supposed to justify a put
ting out, an alienation that we have to be responsible
for."
He concluded, "We have confused how we are sexual
ly with humanity itself."
Brandt cited the funding problems faced by gay pro
grams here and the responsibility of the policymakers in
the University to abolish inequalities.
"This culture, while waving the banner of morality,,
makes it difficult to be a moral person," she said.
Calling for a new concern with "human dignity," she
said people must open their hearts to each other. "To
gether we will keep on dancing."

According to Brandt, most people hold damaging
rather than good images of homosexuality. "Lesbians
(and gays) must grow up hiding their sexual identity from
their parents."
Ray Koskovich cf GLAS referred to two letters recently
sent to the gay community: one from Gov. Jerry Brown
in support of Gay Awareness Week, and one from Fred
Eyerly, the mayor of Palo Alto. GLAS has also distributed
a third letter of support, from San Francisco Mayor
Dianne Feinstein.
Palo Alto, whose voters recently turned down a gay
rights ordinance, does not recognize the group,
Koskovich said. But, he joked, "At least the bigtime liber
als (referring to Brown) are still being liberal."
The Choral Majority, a San Francisco quartet known
for original songs such as "Whites' Christmas" and "Dike
the Hall," provided satirical musical interludes through
out the rally.
To the tune of "Onward Christian Soldiers," the two
woman and two-man ensemble sang lyrics including,
"trample human freedom under pious feet," "slay the
homosexuals," and "God above is calling you to beat
and maim and kill."
They also performed a sing-along featuring a chorus of
"Bonzo's to blame." The musical number criticized con
cepts such as limited nuclear warfare and the economic
"trickle-down" theory.
The Choral Majority "donated" another number to
the "Corporate Church." Lyrics included, "Our Lord's
tax-exempt" and "send your bucks to Jesus."
And the group's rendition of "America the Beautiful"
featured the crowd-pleasing line, "We want more
fruited plains."
According to Rhio Hiersch, a member of the steering
committee of GLAS, the organization has retired the fa
miliar GPU name because of the current male connota
tion of the word "gay... The word gay has become more
associated with male concerns," he said.
The recently renamed group is celebrating its 10th an
niversary here.
