Hopes rise as talks continue
United Nations — Hopes for settlement of the Falklands crisis rose
here yesterday as talks continued between British and Argentine repre
sentatives and U.N. Secretary General Javier Perez de Cuellar on his
peace proposals.
British officials predicted that a diplomatic breakthrough in the South
Atlantic conflict could come as early as tonight and this prediction was
endorsed by a senior aide to Perez de Cuellar.
Enrique Ros, Argentine deputy foreign minister, spent two hours with
the secretary general yesterday afternoon and, on leaving, said only that
another session has been set for today. He was followed to Perez de
Cuellar's office by British Ambassador Sir Anthony Parsons. There have
been no face-to-face meetings so far between the Argentines and Brit
ons.
A shift in the Argentine position was indicated Sunday by Foreign
Minister Nicanor Costa Mendez, who said on a U.S. television program
that British acceptance of Argentine ownership of the islands was no
longer a preconditon to talks, although he added that any negotiations
must lead to Argentine sovereignty.
Perez de Cuellar, a Peruvian, told reporters when he arrived at head
quarters yesterday that sovereignty is not a direct issue "at this stage"
because "we are discussing on a procedural basis, not on a substantive
basis." Also, despite the statement by Costa Mendez, Argentina's civil-
ian foreign minister, the attitude toward the apparent
policy shift by the Argentine military is not known.
The secretary general's six-point peace plan — still
not made public by him — is reported to call for a
cease-fire, withdrawal of Argentine invasion forces
from the disputed islands, a withdrawal of the pow
erful naval task force Britain has sent to regain the is
lands, suspension of Western European and U.S. eco
nomic sanctions against Argentina, the establishment
of a U.N. presence in the Falklands and negotiations
to decide their future status.
Renewed British naval bombardment yesterday of
the islands' capital — called Puerto Argentino by the
Argentines and Stanley by the British — and its airfield
were not discussed in the sessions with Perez de
Cuellar, U.N. officials said.
Brits bombard Argentine forces
London — A British warship opened fire last night
on a ship near theFalkland Islands, and there was a
large explosion in the vicinity of the target, the British
Defense Ministry announced early today.
A press officer for the ministry said he had no other
details yet.
Ships of the British battle fleet bombarded Argen
tine positions in the Falklands earlier yesterday for the
second successive day, and correspondents aboard
the Royal Navy task said the action was a prelude to
invasion.
With expectations increasing that the new British
military action is preparation for an invasion within a
week if the mediation attempt by U.N. Secretary Gen
eral Javier Perez de Cuellar fails to achieve a settle
ment soon, British Foreign Secretary Francis Pym and
other officials continued to show greater flexibility in
Britain's negotiating position.
Other officials said most of the movement in the
British position occurred in negotiations last week
through Secretary of State Alexander Haig on a Peru
vian government peace initiative before the diplo
matic focus shifted to the United Nations. Under
some pressure from Haig, according to sources here,
the government of Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher
dropped demands that full British administration be
restored to the islands after an Argentine withdrawal
and that the Falkland Islanders have a virtual veto in
negotiations about the islands' future.

Instead, the Thatcher government has agreed to ac
cept international administration of the Falklands.
The British government no longer is demanding that
its colonial governor be restored to authority in the
Falklands, one informed source here said. But it re
portedly wants all Argentine military administrators
to leave and a U.N. or other international adminis
tration to operate through the islanders' legislative
councils and the few remaining British civil servants
headed by the colonial financial secretary.
U.S.-Soviet arms control proposed
Washington — Arms-control specialists said yester
day that President Ronald Reagan's new strategic
arms-reduction plan would face determined Soviet
opposition because it would require the Soviet Union
to make substantially larger cuts than the United
States in land-based intercontinental ballistic missiles.
Nevertheless, the long-awaited proposal for re
newed negotiations between the world's two nuclear
superpowers, was greeted by many of the adminis
tration's staunchest arms-control critics as a fair basis
for beginning negotiations.
In calling for a one-third overall reduction in war
heads on land-and sea-based missiles, Reagan pro
posed Sunday that no more than half of each coun
try's missile warheads be carried on land-based
ICBMs.
Because the Soviet Union's huge land-based
ICBM's carry more than 70 percent of its nuclear war
heads, the new U.S. proposal would require the Sovi
ets to dismantle about 3260 warheads to none for the
United States.
Although that aspect of the proposal was expected
to draw determined Soviet opposition, the adminis
tration won praise yesterday for addressing head-on
the most dangerous aspect of the nuclear-arms build
up.
Democrats agree on budget
Washington — House Democratic leaders agreed
yesterday on a budget outline that leaves Social Secur
ity intact but uses $151 billion in tax increases over
three years to trim deficits.
James Jones (D-Okia.), House Budget Committee
Chairman, said the panel would begin work tomor
row on the plan, which calls for smaller cuts in

domestic programs and slower growth in military
spending than the $779 billion package adopted last
week by the GOP-majority on the Senate Budget
Committee and embraced by President Ronald Rea
gan.
Jones said he discussed his ideas with the House
Democratic leadership and they supported his pro
posal.
The budget outline agreed to by Senate Re
publicans and Reagan includes $40 billion in Social
Security "solvency" measures — presumably a com
bination of benefit reductions and increased payroll
taxes — over three years.
A preliminary draft of the proposal that lones will
present to his committee shows tax revenue increases
of $31 billion in 1983, $52 billion in 1984 and $68 billion
in 1985.
The Senate Republican proposal calls for tax in
creases of $20 billion in 1983, $35 billion in 1984 and
$40 billion in 1985.
Doctor urged parents not to act
Washington — Three weeks before he shot Presi
dent Ronald Reagan, a distraught, almost incoherent
John Hinckley begged his parents for money to come
home, saying that otherwise "you'll never see me
again."
But despite the urgency of tne plea from a young
man already considered suicidal, the psychiatrist
treating Hinckley urged his parents not to act im
mediately — to make him sweat for a few extra hours.
"There was not as much concern as we eventually
realized we should have had," psychiatrist John Hop
per testified yesterday at Hinckley's trial.
Hopper had treated Hinckley for about six months
before the shooting, seeing him 12 times. He treated
Hinckley with a machine called "biofeedback," and
he had him write an autobiography.
"I have two obsessions in life now, writing and the
person we discussed on Nov. 4," Hinckley wrote
about himself. "I care about nothing else."
The person they had discussed was actress Jodie
Foster, with whom Hinckley became infatuated after
viewing 15 times the movie "Taxi Driver," in which
she played the part of a teen-age prostitute.
Hinckley had made the call to his parents from New
York on March 6,1981, and they delayed sending him

a ticket for his return until the following day. Hopper
said his patient never came to see him after that, but
sent him a card calling for "a quick return to health
and happiness."
Inside the card, Hinckley wrote:
"Thanks for recommending that I starve in New
York City."
Said the psychiatrist, "It was an expression of anger,
albeit sarcastically."
The defense is trying to show that Hinckley was in
sane.
Stocks and prices fall
New York — Stocks retreated over a broad front
yesterday, led by oil and technology issues.
Prices were lower from the opening bell, seldom
showing upward momentum in a session marked by
little news.
The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials — which
began the day at its best level since Jan. 29 — fell 8.28
to 860.92, offsetting its 6-point gain of Friday. The
transportation and utility measures also declined.
Gold was listed at $329 per troy ounce.
