# Commission bemoans deficient technical education
## Gov. Brown-led panel meets here 
### Katherine Brown 
The California Commission on In
dustrial Innovation, chaired by Gov.
Jerry Brown, met at Tresidder yester
day to discuss the crisis of deficient
technical education at the primary
and secondary levels.
According to Education Prof.
Michael Kirst, who delivered a pres
entation on the subject, "Salaries are
really at the heart ... If we paid all
math teachers $50,000 we wouldn't
have a problem."
As the situation exists today,
teaching in public elementary,
schools is no longer an easy place to
earn a living, said Kirst.
"The substitution of capital for la
bor doesn't work. We tried getting
hardware before software ... I saw
closets full of new television sets that
were never used."
Brown said that the state ought to
be adjusting expenditures down
rather than upwards, given the low
percentage of school-age children in
California. He also said "We're put
ting more (state funds) into the com
munity colleges ... What you don't
get up to grade 12, you can get in the
next two years."
Kirst proposed creating summer
retraining programs for teachers in
surplus subject areas such as social
studies, art and music, and using em
ployees from the private sector as
part-time teachers. A systematic re
cruiting program for science and
math teachers would use scholar
ships and stipends as incentives.
UC-Berkeley Chancellor Ira
Heyman said it is difficult to make the
curriculum exciting and attractive
enough to capture the interest of
bright undergraduates before they

get a B.A. or B.S. degree. Only 1 per
cent of Berkeley's entering freshmen
express any interest in elementary or
secondary education, he said.
There was optimism from several
industry members. David Packard,
chairman of the board of Hewlett-
Packard, said that the Round Table
business group of the nation's top ex
ecutives could help leverage industry
talent by sponsoring basic texts on
particular facets of sciences.
Richard Atkinson, chancellor at
UC-San Diego and former head of

the National Science Foundation
(NSF), said a special NSF committee is
looking into this teaching dilemma.
Kirst said a rumor is going around
that Mobil will be giving $10 million
to the cause as well.
A discussion of using a voluntary
sales tax or gasoline tax revenues
ended with few answers. Kirst said
there is no governmental mechanism
for local action taxation, and Brown
said that there are heavy restriction:
on to what uses the gas tax revenues
