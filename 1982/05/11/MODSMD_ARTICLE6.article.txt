# Conservation programs to reduce energy costs

Skyrocketing energy costs, which
have used up an increasingly larger
proportion of the University's
budget, have likewise had an adverse
impact on the individual budgets of
campus facilities and departments,
resulting in the development of
energy conservation programs.
The Medical Center, the Athletic
Department and Tresidder Union
have all formulated programs that
take different approaches toward the
common goal of conservation. These
conservation programs are inde
pendent of but supplemental to the
University-wide efforts coordinated
by the Energy Action Plan.
The Medical Center program
focuses on the reduction of energy
use, while the Athletic Department is
concerned with maximizing the effi
ciency of their systems. Tresidder,
meanwhile, has recruited student in
terns for several conservation
projects.

The Medical Center Energy Use
Reduction Program aims at an overall
reduction in energy use of 15 percent
(adjusted for the growth of tne cen
ter) in the next two-and-a-half-years,
according to Sean Mooney, Med
Center energy conservation coordi
nator.
Mooney stressed that accelerating
energy rates will prevent any real re
duction in costs. Therefore, he said,
the program's goal is "balancing in
creasing rates by decreasing con
sumption."
The three elements of the Medical
Center program are conservation,
systems modification and long-term
energy planning. The latter two have
been in effect for the past two years.
The conservation efforts were in
itiated within the past year, kicked off
by an advertising campaign aimed at
the Med Center faculty and staff
whose main thrust is to teach people
how to save energy both at home and
in the office.

Mooney emphasized the instruc
tive nature of tne effort, saying, "We
do not believe that you can effective
ly order people to save energy."
Systems modification, the second
aspect of the program, consists of the
altering and upgrading of major
energy-using systems and equip
ment.
An example of this effort is the

steam trap proaram, designed to re
duce losses in tne steam distrubution
system. When fully implemented,
said Mooney, this program will save a
minimum of 2.9 million pounds of
steam per year, which equals $30,000
a year at the present steam rate.
