# Conservation programs to reduce energy costs
## 
### Katherine Hutt 
Skyrocketing energy costs, which
have used up an increasingly larger
proportion of the University's
budget, have likewise had an adverse
impact on the individual budgets of
campus facilities and departments,
resulting in the development of
energy conservation programs.
The Medical Center, the Athletic
Department and Tresidder Union
have all formulated programs that
take different approaches toward the
common goal of conservation. These
conservation programs are inde
pendent of but supplemental to the
University-wide efforts coordinated
by the Energy Action Plan.
The Medical Center program
focuses on the reduction of energy
use, while the Athletic Department is
concerned with maximizing the effi
ciency of their systems. Tresidder,
meanwhile, has recruited student in
terns for several conservation
projects.

The Medical Center Energy Use
Reduction Program aims at an overall
reduction in energy use of 15 percent
(adjusted for the growth of tne cen
ter) in the next two-and-a-half-years,
according to Sean Mooney, Med
Center energy conservation coordi
nator.
Mooney stressed that accelerating
energy rates will prevent any real re
duction in costs. Therefore, he said,
the program's goal is "balancing in
creasing rates by decreasing con
sumption."
The three elements of the Medical
Center program are conservation,
systems modification and long-term
energy planning. The latter two have
been in effect for the past two years.
The conservation efforts were in
itiated within the past year, kicked off
by an advertising campaign aimed at
the Med Center faculty and staff
whose main thrust is to teach people
how to save energy both at home and
in the office.

Mooney emphasized the instruc
tive nature of tne effort, saying, "We
do not believe that you can effective
ly order people to save energy."
Systems modification, the second
aspect of the program, consists of the
altering and upgrading of major
energy-using systems and equip
ment.
An example of this effort is the

steam trap proaram, designed to re
duce losses in tne steam distrubution
system. When fully implemented,
said Mooney, this program will save a
minimum of 2.9 million pounds of
steam per year, which equals $30,000
a year at the present steam rate.
The goal of the Medical Center
program's third element, long-term
energy planning, istoensureenergy
efficient designs incorporating flex
ibility for changes in utility rate struc
tures and in facilities use.
This latter consideration is particu
larly important for the Med Center,
according to Mooney, "because of
the constantly progressing areas of
medical research," which require
corresponding modifications in their
facilities.
This long-term planning is evident
in the hospital modernization
project currently underway. The
Medical Center is in the process of
planning a new hospital addition,
and the oasis for all aspects of the de
sign is long-term energy efficiency.
In contrast to the Medical Center's
clearly outlined program for the re
duction of energy consumption, the
Athletic Department has no specific
goals although it emphasizes effi
ciency.
The department is looking at all fa
cilities, such as the distribution sys
tem, to make sure that they are oper
ating efficiently. In addition, it is in
volved in University-wide conserva
tion efforts such as de-lamping and
the installation of a solar heating sys
tem.

In the area of de-lamping, "We
have made substantial progress in
Roble and in Encina Gyms," said As
soc. Director of Athletics Alan Cum
mings. The department is currently
studying which type of fixture to use
in Maples Pavilion.
The Athletic Department's major
project is the installation of a solar
heating system for the DeGuerre
pools. Last year the department ap
plied for a grant from the federal
government to finance such a sys
tem, but was turned down. However,
the department has since been ap
proached by several companies with
proposals.
In keeping with its "pragmatic" ap
proach to energy conservation,
Cummings described the Athletic
Department's interest in solar energy
as "very much a dollars-and-cents is
sue." In other words, the department
wants to use solar energy in order to
reduce their costs, not because it is
currently a popular energy alter
native.
Tresidder Union, which like the
Medical Center and the Athletic De
partment is responsible for its own
utilities bills, has successfully used
student interns in several energy
conservation projects, according to
Assistant Director Greg Larson.
Last year five students were ap
pointed as energy interns. They
worked on conservation education

throughout Tresidder, did relamping
and completed an energy use survey
of the building. The result of their ef
forts was an increasingly larger re
duction in electricity use each quar
ter, culminating in an overall reduc
tion of 15 percent. Similar goals are in
place for this year's program.
Another major conservation effort
by Tresidder was revamping of the
main cafeteria, now called "Union
Crossroads." In this project the light
ing was changed from incandescent
to high pressure sodium, which si
multaneously tripled the amount of
light on the tables and cut electricity
use by 25 percent, said Larson.
