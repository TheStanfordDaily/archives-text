## Treatments for agoraphobia being tested 
### Bruce Quinn 
One of the major revolutions
in clinical psychology and be
havioral medicine in the past 20
years has been the rise of alter
natives to classic psy
choanalytical therapy in the
treatment of behavioral illness.
Two groups here are currently
testing two techniques, behav
ior therapy and chemical anti
depressants, in the treatment
of agoraphobia, a pattern of
fears highlighted by a terror of
driving and public places.
According to Lloyd Williams,
graduate student in psy
chology, one of the most strik
ing characteristics of
agoraphobia is its sudden ap
pearance in otherwise normal,
well-adjusted individuals. The
clinical literature on
agoraphobia includes case
studies of former firefighters
and combat veterans. "They
are clearly not pervasively

timid," said Williams, but may
develop fears so severe that
they become homebound.
"Their sense of their own com
petence is shattered."
Agoraphobia typically be
gins as one or two sudden, ap
parently random panic attacks.
Michael Telch, graduate stu
dent in counseling psychology,
theorized that the core prob
lem of agoraphobia is the pa
tient's terror of his or her own
physiological panic reactions,
which in turn causes the per
son to avoid any situation
which might precipitate the at
tacks.
Williams' research is focused
on better behavioral treat
ments, called "exposure thera
py," for agoraphobics. In re
sponse to dissatisfaction with
classical psychotherapy meth
ods, some researchers began
studying more direct methods
of treatment, such as asking the

patient to imagine driving
down a street or going shop
ping, without abnormal stress.
Such approaches produced
mixed results.
Exposure therapy, however,
has been effective in nearly 100
percent of the subjects studied
so far. In this treatment, the pa
tients are actually taken to a
car, and in a series of stages are
encouraged to drive as far as
they feel they can, on a two
mile course.
A separate research pro
gram, led by Telch through the
Behavioral Medicine Clinic, is
investigating the effect of com
bining behavioral treatment
with chemical antidepressants.
Two bodies of evidence sug
gest that antidepressants may
be useful in agoraphobia. First,
in some studies agoraphobics
show very high ratings on psy

chological tests for depression,4
although it is unknown wheth
er depression causes
agoraphobia, or vice versa.
Second, since agoraphobics
are abnormally disposed to
physiological panic attacks,
which lead to a fear of public
places, the antidepressant
drugs may normalize the brain
neurotransmitters that cause
the physiological reactions.
Telch and his colleagues in
tend to compare subjects in
three experimental situations:
drug only, behavior therapy
only, and a combination of the
two treatments. In addition to
the patient's own reports of his
progress, the groups will be
compared with a small elec
tronic heart rate monitor
which each subject will wear
while following a course
through the Stanford Shopping
Center.
