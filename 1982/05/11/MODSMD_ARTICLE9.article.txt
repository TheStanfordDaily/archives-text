# Do you know... why it was windy yesterday?

The wind that scatters leaves, propels wind
surfers and blows roofs off of buildings is ul
timately a result of the sun's uneven heating
of the earth.
Due to the earth's curvature, the equatorial
area receives more solar radiation per area of
land or water than the polar regions. Also, the
water and vegetation of the tropical regions
absorb sunlight while the snow and ice of the
poles reflect solar radiation. Thus, the air sur
rounding the equator is much warmer than
the air of the poles.
Air which is warmer (and thus lighter) than
its surroundings tends to rise while cooler
(and heavier) air tends to sink. You can ob
serve these processes in action when you feel
hot air rising from a candle flame and cold air

falling to the floor from an open refrigerator.
This phenomenon of air movement being
related to temperature is responsible for the
basic pattern of global air circulation. Warm
equatorial air rises and flows towards the
poles while cold polar air sinks and spreads
over the earth towards the equator.
This basic pattern of air circulation is al
tered into the complex, varying winds that we
observe by the earth's rotation, large bodies
of water, and land features such as mountains
and valleys. Thus, wind may be seen as a
mechanism that tries to equalize the tem
perature differences of the earth-
