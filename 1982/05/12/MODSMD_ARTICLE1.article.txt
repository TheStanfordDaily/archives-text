# Draw assignments released, Co-op houses still unfilled
## 
### Joan O'Connell 
The release of results from the Spring Housing Draw
yesterday not only brought good news to those who
nabbed spots in the brand new dorm, but also forecasted
a dim future for co-op housing on campus.
The difficulty in filling spots in the co-op houses on
campus will result in a serious study by Res Ed into their
popularity and value as living arrangements. The six
co-op houses currently operating here may be restruc
tured or consolidated within the next couple of years,
according to Roger Whitney, assistant dean of Residen
tial Education and director of housing.
Of the 73 spaces which remained unfilled at the end of
Round One, 44 were in either Columbae, Synergy, Terra
or Phi Psi, four of the on-campus co-ops.Eighteen were
for one of three six-person suites in the new dorm which
Whitney said Res Ed is waiting until Round Two to fill so
that it can place groups of six people who want to live
together in them. Another 11 spaces had been reserved
for males in the French House.
Round One placements were limited to those spaces
for which preference was indicated on draw cards and
does not take into account those who expressed no par
ticular preference for a housing assignment as long as it is
on campus — the 006 category.
"We're beginning to wonder if we're over-co-opted,"
said Whitney. He said that Res Ed had even considered
combining those who had listed Columbae and Synergy
into one house, but had decided not to do it during this
year's draw.
"It's always a big decision (about whether) we need to
reconsider or restructure a program between rounds
one and two," said Whitney, adding that the decision
was that Res Ed would take a very close look at the situ
ation this year. Whitney also explained that his office
would likely have no trouble at all filling those spaces in
Round Two, with people who simply wanted to live on
campus, or, if worst came to worst, unguaranteed stu
dents.
"But obviously that doesn't tell you how popular the

residence is," he added.
On-campus housing evidently remains very popular as '
reflected in the fact that 4078 students entered the draw
for 2705 available spaces. In Round One, 2632 spaces
were filled, with only 12 students who were unassigned
and are still in the assignable group. The reason for this,
Whitney explained, was that they were too selective in
their preferences. Of the students who were not as
signed, 1434 were not in an assignable group.
The new dormitory created 421 new spaces: 61 for East
House, 260 assignable spots in the suites and 180 as
signable spots in the independent houses.
The renovated Storey House added 50 spaces and the
former Zete house, 353 Campus Drive, added 53 spots
not available last year.
The cut-off numbers for on-campus assignments for
Round One were 4128 for men who were guaranteed
housing, while for women, spots were assigned up to
number 198 of unguaranteed draws.
Whitney said that residents in the co-ops had been
warned by Director of the Row Diana Conklin that there
was a problem in terms of getting students with priority
to fill the houses — "they realized that they were in a
precarious position," and were encouraged to try to fill
their houses, he said.
"The problem is that once you shore up houses for a
year, there's one aggressive year and then there's a lag,"
he said. Apparently that is what happened here in the
past three years with co-ops. In 1980, there were 18
spaces unfilled at this point, most of them co-op spots.
Last year there were only two and those were in the
French House.
The problem at the French House meanwhile, seems
limited to attracting male students, as there is generally a
good-sized reservoir of women to fill the open spots,
Whitney said. Res Ed even attempted a minor remedy
this year by changing the male-female ratio from 17-17 to
19-15, but still was left with 11 empty spots.
Round Two results of the draw are
expected to be ready by Friday, May
21. Students wishing either to accept
their first round assignment or drop
out of the draw must go to the hous
ing center office in Old Union. To
participate in Round Two, students
need not do anything and will be
guaranteed either at least the same
assignment or an assignment which
bore a higher priority on their draw
card.
Priority in the French House or the
co-ops is available until June 11 and
Whitney noted that if students wish
ing to obtain priority do so by next

week, they can code that information
into the computer and would likely
be assigned to one of those choices.
According to Whitney the draw
went amazingly smoothly this year,
despite something of a tricky plan
ning problem posed by the new spots
which Res Ed hopes will be opening
on time in the new dorm complex.
Because of the need for cont
ingency housing, 353 Campus Drive
was not entered into the draw and
will house the students who will oc
cupy East House when it opens. In
addition, the students who will live in
either the two independent houses
or the suites will be housed in Man
zanita Park until those spots are avail
able. Only about 70 spots in Man
zanita will be opened up to under

graduates not there for contingency
purposes.
However, Jan Van Houten, direc
tor of the new residence, said yester
ay that there is a good chance that the
independent houses, including East
House, will be opening in the fall as
scheduled, and in that case, an addi
tional 120 spots in Manzanita will
open up. Van Houten said '.hat this
summer she will keep in touch with
students who are assigned to the new
dormitory in order to keep them
abreast of where to ship their belong
ings, and of other arrangements they
need to make.
If the new dorm spaces open on
time, the contingency housing will
be filled from waiting lists.
