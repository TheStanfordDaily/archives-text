# Reagan ready for SALT III
## 
### Washington Post 
Washington — Three-and-a-half months ago,
the Reagan administration pointedly refused to
set a date for the beginning of new strategic arms
negotiations with the Soviet Union because of
the "long and dark shadow" of Poland. Today,
repression continues there, but President
Ronald Reagan is ready for the arms talks to be
gin.
Reagan's decision to go ahead now is a dra
matic indication of the flexible politics of arms
control and other aspects of superpower rela
tions, an area in which administrations make up
the rules as they go along, often with an eye to
domestic politics and public opinion.
Reagan, who was bitterly critical of the Carter
administration's strategic arms negotiations and
SALT 2 treaty, declared on the eve of the 1980
election that "as president, I will make im
mediate preparations for negotiations on a SALT
3 treaty."
Once in office, though, other aims took a
higher priority, includinga U.S. military buildup,
which Reagan had described as "the one card
that's been missing" in previous arms control
negotiations.
Reagan and others in his administration also
spoke on occasion of "linking" Soviet behavior
in trouble spots throughout the world to arms
control negotiations. "You can't sit down at a
table and just negotiate that (strategic arms) un
less you take into account — in consideration at
that table — all the other things that are going
on. In other words, I believe in linkage," Reagan
said Jan. 30, 1981, at his first White House news
conference.
Former President Jimmy Carter had applied
"linkage" of a sort on Jan. 3,1980, by asking the

Senate, shortly after the Soviet invasion of Af
ghanistan, to put aside further consideration of
the SALT 2 treaty. Carter later described his ac
tion as a political necessity rather than as a penal
ty against the Soviets, but the connection was
clear enough. Consideration of the treaty was
never resumed.
By last fall, when Reagan initiated negotiations
with the Soviet Union on medium-range weap
ons in Europe, the planning within the govern
ment was for Secretary of State Alexander Haig
and Soviet Foreign Minister Andrei Gromyko to
set a date for the beginning of new strategic arms
negotiations when they met in Geneva this Janu
ary, and for the negotiators to get down to work
in March or April.
By the time Haig met Gromyko, however,
martial law had been declared in Poland Dec. 13
and the administration was holding the Soviets
responsible, declaring there would be no "busi
ness as usual" while repression continued.
Moreover, former Secretary of State Henry Kis
singer in mid-January had strongly attacked the
administration for proceeding ineffectively with
both anti-Soviet sanctions and high-level U.S.-
Soviet talks.
In this situation, Haig cut back his Jan. 26 meet
ing with Gromyko from two dayr. to one (though
the talk lasted nearly eight hours anyway), and
Haig declined to set a date for the strategic arms
negotiations, saying that this would come
"when conditions permit," adding, in response
to questions, that "the current situation of Po
land casts a long and dark shadow over the full
range of East-West relations, including the sub
ject of strategic arms talks."
