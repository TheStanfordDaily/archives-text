## TASK FORCE REPORT The
						Bill Graham influence Professional promoters show interest in campus concerts 
### Third in a series by Adam Goodman 
1975 was a busy year for Danny Scher.
He was completing his MBA at the Stan
ford Business School, playing in a band on
weekends "to make ends meet," and
winding up his second year as part-time
director of ASSU Special Events.
Under his leadership the student or
ganization had posted two years of more
than $50,000 profit. It seemed like ev
eryone wanted Scher.
The ASSU discussed creating a per
manent position for him. So did the Uni
versity. However, Scher decided to take a
full-time job with the top promoter in the
area — Bill Graham.
Today, Scher is vice-president of pro
duction at Bill Graham Presents (BGP) and
he is still busy.
In fact, Scher is still involved in the con
cert scene at Stanford, but this time on the
professional promoter's side. Student
groups wishing to co-promote concerts
most always deal with BGP and Danny
Scher.
The reason is simple, according to
Scher. "We have the inventory."
It is BGP's inventory that has ruined the
efforts of student promoting groups here
and elsewhere, the promoter's critics
claim. BGP's domination of the market,
especially in the Bay Area, has for many
years been met with disdain.
Randy Phillips, Scher's successor at
ASSU Special Events, has called Graham
his "biggest obstacle."
"He literally has the power over the life
and death of Stanford concerts. It's like a
tug of war competing for the few big
name attractions to bid for. Bill makes it
extremely tough. When we do get a show,
it's usually one Bill wanted that we got in
stead," Phillips said in October 1975.
According to Committee on Contem
porary Entertainment (COCE) student in
tern Vinnie Freda, most people on cam
pus involved in concerts have similar
thoughts about Bill Graham.
"They basically feel the same way ev

eryone else in the Bay Area feels about
him. They regret he is the only one they
can work through to get quality per
formers but welcome the fact that he's
willing to put on shows here," he said. "A
lot of people in Special Events felt Bill
Graham Presents actually was trying to
put them out of business."
Freda said if the University wishes to
have concerts it must acknowledge BGP.
"The economics of putting on concerts in
the Bay Area doesn't give Stanford much
to bargain with. (Bill Graham) can say
work through me or you don't get a
show."
"We are a professional company,"
Scher explained in an interview last week,
while describing BGP. "We promote con
certs. No one has to work with us. We
don't have contracts with groups which
say they can't sign with other people. We
can't keep keep groups from signing.
"I just go about my business. I'm not in
terested in creating controversy. I'm a
positive, not a destructive person."
Through Scher, BGP has shown interest
in co-promoting concerts with students
groups here. When a student group co
promotes, it provides a $3000 bond and
the professional promoter puts up the
rest. However, contract negotiations are
done through the University's Director of
Events and Services Vicky Holt.
In the current case of the Stanford
Band's and the Chaparral's attempt to
sponsor a concert with BGP, Holt said she
has frequent phone conversations with
Scher concerning the many details in
volved in a concert production — mostly
financial considerations.
Holt emphasized that student groups
should not expect to make a considerable
amount of money from a co-production.
"There's not a lot of money to be made
in this business in general. That's one of
the great myths of rock-and-roll. I mean
when co-promoters are concerned with
how many garbage cans you're renting, it
is not because they are making hundreds
of thousands of dollars. It's because their

profit margins are very, very slim," she ex
plained.
Concerns over the efficiency of the
Stanford process for concert approval
have also entered the Univer
sity/promoter negotiations, most recent

ly during the Band's bid for an Elton John
concert. Criticism, though often some
what hidden, is present.
"We (BGP) have 30 other cities in which
we do concerts," Schet*said. "We do con
certs at every university in the state. We

don't have a problem."
Scher compared the UC-Berkeley and
Stanford concert efforts. "Berkeley has a
very good reputation. Stanford is new.
They're the new kid on the block."
According to Freda, "Danny's been pa
tient in his attempts to put on shows here
in the last eight years. His patience is final
ly paying off."
The attraction of professional pro
moters to Stanford is most likely due to
the quality of its facilities, what Scher calls
"nice."
"I think it's a good place to put on a
concert. People like going there. It's good
for the artists, the audience and the com
munity," he explained.
Others may say Scher's remarks are an
understatement. "What outside pro
moters tell us is that we've got one of the
best concert facilities in the country in
Frost (Amphitheater) and we do," Holt
said. "It's a beautiful place. It's a lovely
place to perform. The weather is good."
What is important, according to Holt, is
whether there is really enough interest in
concerts here. She quoted ASSU Special
Events statistics that more than 10 percent
of most concert audiences here were stu
dents. According to others involved, fig
ures ranged from 20 to 35 percent.
"We really don't know what the de
mand is or the interest (for concerts),"
Holt said. "Then the University says why
are we are doing it. If it endangers our tax
status, brings us liability problems and
brings us law suits and the kids don't want
to go, then why are we doing them?
"I think there is an audience, but
whether or not Stanford should be in the
business of providing entertainment for
the South Bay is an interesting question. I
think that's one of the questions the
Committee (COCE) is going to have to
grappled with over the next year."
