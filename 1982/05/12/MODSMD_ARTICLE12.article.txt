## Reagan budget lacks energy 
### 
I would like to write one of these columns on some
thing other than the moral and analytic feebleness of the
Reagan administration. And I've tried, I really have. But
every time I crank up for an unrealistic subject, I get
knocked flat by another White House Special. And all
the countless other things that deserve columns —
stories of people and places and ideas beyond President
Ronald Reagan's reach — suddenly seem like rock
ingchair yarns, chit-chat that will have to wait.
But more than a sense of urgency locks me into this
ongoing Washington review. Some of what is going on is
very close to fascinating. Consider for a moment these
tidbits from the 1981-82 budget and what they say about
the men in charge:
• More money is to be spent on military marching bands
than on all solar and energy conservation programs put
together.
• More public money is provided to clean up the nuclear
mess at the Three Mile Island plant than for all energy
conservation programs combined.
• The entire solar budget is less than one-third of what
Reagan proposed to spend on the Clinch River Breeder
reactor.
• Roughly equal amounts of money are slated to provide
servants for Pentagon generals and tofund wind-energy
programs.
At the risk of smothering in figures, let's see how all
this sorts out. Reagan has set aside $72 million for solar
energy next year (down from $260 million in fiscal '82). At
the same time, he wants to pump $252 million into Clinch
River. Even ignoring the Carter administration's primary
reason for abandoning Clinch River — that it would dis
charge enough plutonium every year to make 10,000 nu
clear weapons, which about equals our current arsenal
— the economics of the project make most observers
tremble. In 1977, a Michigan congressman wrote a
scathing report calling it "a boondoggle for the nuclear
industry." The congressman was David Stockman.
The budget for all energy conservation programs has
been set at $22 million for next year (compared to about
$145 million this year.) Meanwhile $27 million will go to
the salvage operation at Three Mile Island so that its

owner, a private utility, can get its nuclear machine back
on line.
So the solar and conservation budgets for fiscal '83 add
up to $94 million. That's about what Reagan and Stock
man plan to spend on marching bands for the Army,
Navy, Marines and Air Force. A little less, actually: the
bands will get $95.5 million.
But that's not even the punch line. The same budget
that allows $5.6 million for research and development of
wind energy will spend about $5 million on personal ser
vants for America's top military brass. Another $1.4 mil
lion will pay veterinary bills for the generals' housepets,
and $1 million will subsidize lunches in the Pentagon din
ing room.
Part of why this devastates me has to do with my own
opinions on nuclear and soft energy paths. I firmly be
lieve that nuclear energy is a wasteful, disruptive,
doomed technology, and that we're meddling with the
atom with about as much awareness and competence as
a 4-year-old with a loaded shotgun. If we have a future as
an industrial society, I'm certain it lies in the limited, pru
dent harnessing of sun, water, biomass and wind power,
bolstered by new attitudes about our energy needs and
new wisdom about our energy use.
Decisively proving these convictions is beyond me. I
don't have the space and I don't have the knowledge. I
could quote a busload of "experts," but so could Reagan
and Westinghouse. Like any lay person, I take in as much
information as curiosity and energy allow and pick out
my experts.
I will argue, though, that whatever the relative merits
of the nuclear and soft energy paths, the above figures
are a screaming indictment of the Reagan policy. The
kindest interpretation would be that the budget man
agers honestly believe that solar, water and wind tech
nologies don't work and never can. If that's the case,
they're ignoring the developmental leaps made by solar
technology in recent years, up to and including the fir
ing-up of Southern Califiornia Edison's 10,000 megawatt
"Power Tower" in the Mojave Desert last month. They're
also postulating that the contemporary problem of
large-scale energy storage is insurmountable. Much as I
dislike sentences that begin "If we can put a man on the
moon ... this dialogue just begs for one.
Another part of this charitable analysis would have to
be that the administration just doesn't know what energy
conservation projects have accomplished for the
isolated companies and communities that have tried
them. Industrial managers routinely report energy sav
ings of 30 to 40 percent after simple retrofits, minor poli

cy changes and employee reorientations. Homeowners
get about the same economy from a few bundles of
fiberglass insulation and a couple rolls of weather-strip
ping.
It's theoretically possible that policymakers know
about none of this, that they're merely ignorant and
short-sighted. But I can't give them that much credit. The
Reagan priorities reflect, I think, an absolute de
termination to keep people dependent on a centralized
energy establishment, owned and operated by familiar
corporations.
If you and I could mount a tiny fission reactor on our
roofs as we can a solar collector or windmill, nuclear de
velopment would get cut off at the knees, too. Instead
we'd be fighting against shale oil boondoggles and the
stripping of the western plains for every last pebble of
surface coal.
The scorn for conservation programs has partly to do

with this same corporate allegiance — if PG&E can't own
the sun, it surely can't own consumption cutback; — and
partly comes from a total identification of prosperity
with growth and expansion. Some people would say that
view never had much wisdom to it; quite clearly it's less
astute today than it was when the Borax Mule Train
crossed the frontier.
There is a phrase from last month's Disorientation
Week that has stayed with me. Almost every Reagan poli
cy, said one of the first night '; speakers, reveals a "brutal
contempt for people." After a winter in which a million
and a half American homes went unheated and as many
as 15,000 Americans died from the cold, that's as good a
description as any of the president's energy policy.

as 15,000 Americans died from the cold, that's as good a
description as any of the president's energy policy.

I would like to write one of these columns on some
thing other than the moral and analytic feebleness of the
Reagan administration. And I've tried, I really have. But
every time I crank up for an unrealistic subject, I get
knocked flat by another White House Special. And all
the countless other things that deserve columns —
stories of people and places and ideas beyond President
Ronald Reagan's reach — suddenly seem like rock
ingchair yarns, chit-chat that will have to wait.
But more than a sense of urgency locks me into this
ongoing Washington review. Some of what is going on is
very close to fascinating. Consider for a moment these
tidbits from the 1981-82 budget and what they say about
the men in charge:
• More money is to be spent on military marching bands
than on all solar and energy conservation programs put
together.
• More public money is provided to clean up the nuclear
mess at the Three Mile Island plant than for all energy
conservation programs combined.
• The entire solar budget is less than one-third of what
Reagan proposed to spend on the Clinch River Breeder
reactor.
• Roughly equal amounts of money are slated to provide
servants for Pentagon generals and tofund wind-energy
programs.
At the risk of smothering in figures, let's see how all
this sorts out. Reagan has set aside $72 million for solar
energy next year (down from $260 million in fiscal '82). At
the same time, he wants to pump $252 million into Clinch
River. Even ignoring the Carter administration's primary
reason for abandoning Clinch River — that it would dis
charge enough plutonium every year to make 10,000 nu
clear weapons, which about equals our current arsenal
— the economics of the project make most observers
tremble. In 1977, a Michigan congressman wrote a
scathing report calling it "a boondoggle for the nuclear
industry." The congressman was David Stockman.
The budget for all energy conservation programs has
been set at $22 million for next year (compared to about
$145 million this year.) Meanwhile $27 million will go to
the salvage operation at Three Mile Island so that its

owner, a private utility, can get its nuclear machine back
on line.
So the solar and conservation budgets for fiscal '83 add
up to $94 million. That's about what Reagan and Stock
man plan to spend on marching bands for the Army,
Navy, Marines and Air Force. A little less, actually: the
bands will get $95.5 million.
But that's not even the punch line. The same budget
that allows $5.6 million for research and development of
wind energy will spend about $5 million on personal ser
vants for America's top military brass. Another $1.4 mil
lion will pay veterinary bills for the generals' housepets,
and $1 million will subsidize lunches in the Pentagon din
ing room.
Part of why this devastates me has to do with my own
opinions on nuclear and soft energy paths. I firmly be
lieve that nuclear energy is a wasteful, disruptive,
doomed technology, and that we're meddling with the
atom with about as much awareness and competence as
a 4-year-old with a loaded shotgun. If we have a future as
an industrial society, I'm certain it lies in the limited, pru
dent harnessing of sun, water, biomass and wind power,
bolstered by new attitudes about our energy needs and
new wisdom about our energy use.
Decisively proving these convictions is beyond me. I
don't have the space and I don't have the knowledge. I
could quote a busload of "experts," but so could Reagan
and Westinghouse. Like any lay person, I take in as much
information as curiosity and energy allow and pick out
my experts.
I will argue, though, that whatever the relative merits
of the nuclear and soft energy paths, the above figures
are a screaming indictment of the Reagan policy. The
kindest interpretation would be that the budget man
agers honestly believe that solar, water and wind tech
nologies don't work and never can. If that's the case,
they're ignoring the developmental leaps made by solar
technology in recent years, up to and including the fir
ing-up of Southern Califiornia Edison's 10,000 megawatt
"Power Tower" in the Mojave Desert last month. They're
also postulating that the contemporary problem of
large-scale energy storage is insurmountable. Much as I
dislike sentences that begin "If we can put a man on the
moon ... this dialogue just begs for one.
Another part of this charitable analysis would have to
be that the administration just doesn't know what energy
conservation projects have accomplished for the
isolated companies and communities that have tried
them. Industrial managers routinely report energy sav
ings of 30 to 40 percent after simple retrofits, minor poli

cy changes and employee reorientations. Homeowners
get about the same economy from a few bundles of
fiberglass insulation and a couple rolls of weather-strip
ping.
It's theoretically possible that policymakers know
about none of this, that they're merely ignorant and
short-sighted. But I can't give them that much credit. The
Reagan priorities reflect, I think, an absolute de
termination to keep people dependent on a centralized
energy establishment, owned and operated by familiar
corporations.
If you and I could mount a tiny fission reactor on our
roofs as we can a solar collector or windmill, nuclear de
velopment would get cut off at the knees, too. Instead
we'd be fighting against shale oil boondoggles and the
stripping of the western plains for every last pebble of
surface coal.
The scorn for conservation programs has partly to do

with this same corporate allegiance — if PG&E can't own
the sun, it surely can't own consumption cutback; — and
partly comes from a total identification of prosperity
with growth and expansion. Some people would say that
view never had much wisdom to it; quite clearly it's less
astute today than it was when the Borax Mule Train
crossed the frontier.
There is a phrase from last month's Disorientation
Week that has stayed with me. Almost every Reagan poli
cy, said one of the first night '; speakers, reveals a "brutal
contempt for people." After a winter in which a million
and a half American homes went unheated and as many
as 15,000 Americans died from the cold, that's as good a
