## Anchormen compete for trust in 'News Sweepstakes' 
### 
Washington — With the Kentucky Derby
out of the way, yet another horse race hyp
notizes the American people to a fault: who
will become the nation's most trusted tele
vision news personality?
All bets are off. The latest field of network
news anchors is stopping at nothing to win
the public's trust. We just hope those of us
holding TV Guides don't get burned in the
final stretch.
Most of us watched the jockeying begin
last month as handsome Tom Brokaw joined
Roger Mudd on the "NBC Nightly News."
With publicity rivaling that of the Royal
Wedding, NBC's news team boasted "ex
perience you can trust."
It was about the same time that frontrun
ner CBS, sensing a challenge on the outside,
took out its whip. Dan Rather donned a
homey vest sweater and opened with a self
introduction. With that, CBS was offering

viewers a "world of difference."
Moguls at ABS then earned themselves a
"Talking-Heads-of-the-Year" award with
the release of a promotional package featur
ing the portraits of six anchorman (suitable
for framing), complete with a short con
fessional. Quipped a pensive Ted Koppel:
"I'm really one big exposed nerve ..."
To their credit, each network can claim
among the finest in reporters and journal
istic standards. Together they invest ob
scenely long hours and untold amounts of
money to deliver the news. One recent edi
tion of ABC's "Nightline," for example, pro
vided live feeds from Boston, Chicago, New
York, London, Moscow and Munich. Com
monplace by today's standards, such a pro
duction would have been inconceivable 15
years ago.
If nothing else, the networks' own ad
vertisements are serving as gentle reminders

that news organizations differ a little from
other businesses. While slick promotions
don't ask us to pay out-of-pocket for their
product, the networks' bidding for our at
tention is fierce. Recalled CBS's Eric Severeid
in a recent with National Journal,
"A few years ago, (when) the news depart
ment began to show a profit, I was worried. I
knew it would be looked at differently by top
executives when it began to mean millions of
dollars for three or four rating points."
Yet each network's recent efforts to boost
its Nielsen ratings have a nasty twist: the
more we're told to trust them, the more
we're inclined to oblige. Sadly, hype and
posturing render a blind faith in an anchor
team's work.
Despite our supposed media malediction,
we've let the news stars become as news
worthy as the events and characters they
cover. But perhaps more dangerously, we've

let Walter Cronkite's legacy get the best of
us. We all know someone, if not ourselves,
who "trusts" only Dan Rather or Roger
Mudd.
Implied in such devotion (and indeed,
what's explicit in the recent barrage of ads) is
the notion that one news teams has "the
word" and can deliver the "whole truth." It's
as if a handful of reporters, as ABC puts it,
can truly "bring you the world."
Alarms should blare when news organiza
tions, supposedly given to documentation,
lunge unabashedly toward an absolute. As
real-world messengers, their boasts of spe
cial insight and super powers may, un
fortunately, be taken too seriously.
Careful attention to all three networks, the
wire services and a hefty dose of daily news
papers doesn't begin to illuminate the
world's infinite facets. Certainly, 22 minutes
of news can tell only a fraction of the story.

Innocents alone, as English poet William
Blake pointed out, dream of seeing "a world
in a grain of sand ... and eternity in an
hour."
Networks do the public a disservice in mix
ing information with an abundance of self
promotion. In luring the viewer's eyes,
they're playing a cruel game with Americans'
weakness for celebritude.
As is the case with so many other public
figures, the Tom Brokaws and the Max Rob
insons may be doomed to falter as their
sense of power, autonomy and responsibility
increases. If the problem can deeply afflict
politicians, it can easiy infect the press too.
The moral, then: don't give up on re
porters, but don't give them too much slack
either.

perience you can trust."
It was about the same time that frontrun
ner CBS, sensing a challenge on the outside,
took out its whip. Dan Rather donned a
homey vest sweater and opened with a self
introduction. With that, CBS was offering

viewers a "world of difference."
Moguls at ABS then earned themselves a
"Talking-Heads-of-the-Year" award with
the release of a promotional package featur
ing the portraits of six anchorman (suitable
for framing), complete with a short con
fessional. Quipped a pensive Ted Koppel:
"I'm really one big exposed nerve ..."
To their credit, each network can claim
among the finest in reporters and journal
istic standards. Together they invest ob
scenely long hours and untold amounts of
money to deliver the news. One recent edi
tion of ABC's "Nightline," for example, pro
vided live feeds from Boston, Chicago, New
York, London, Moscow and Munich. Com
monplace by today's standards, such a pro
duction would have been inconceivable 15
years ago.
If nothing else, the networks' own ad
vertisements are serving as gentle reminders

that news organizations differ a little from
other businesses. While slick promotions
don't ask us to pay out-of-pocket for their
product, the networks' bidding for our at
tention is fierce. Recalled CBS's Eric Severeid
in a recent with National Journal,
"A few years ago, (when) the news depart
ment began to show a profit, I was worried. I
knew it would be looked at differently by top
executives when it began to mean millions of
dollars for three or four rating points."
Yet each network's recent efforts to boost
its Nielsen ratings have a nasty twist: the
more we're told to trust them, the more
we're inclined to oblige. Sadly, hype and
posturing render a blind faith in an anchor
team's work.
Despite our supposed media malediction,
we've let the news stars become as news
worthy as the events and characters they
cover. But perhaps more dangerously, we've

let Walter Cronkite's legacy get the best of
us. We all know someone, if not ourselves,
who "trusts" only Dan Rather or Roger
Mudd.
Implied in such devotion (and indeed,
what's explicit in the recent barrage of ads) is
the notion that one news teams has "the
word" and can deliver the "whole truth." It's
as if a handful of reporters, as ABC puts it,
can truly "bring you the world."
Alarms should blare when news organiza
tions, supposedly given to documentation,
lunge unabashedly toward an absolute. As
real-world messengers, their boasts of spe
cial insight and super powers may, un
fortunately, be taken too seriously.
Careful attention to all three networks, the
wire services and a hefty dose of daily news
papers doesn't begin to illuminate the
world's infinite facets. Certainly, 22 minutes
of news can tell only a fraction of the story.

Innocents alone, as English poet William
Blake pointed out, dream of seeing "a world
in a grain of sand ... and eternity in an
hour."
Networks do the public a disservice in mix
ing information with an abundance of self
promotion. In luring the viewer's eyes,
they're playing a cruel game with Americans'
weakness for celebritude.
As is the case with so many other public
figures, the Tom Brokaws and the Max Rob
insons may be doomed to falter as their
sense of power, autonomy and responsibility
increases. If the problem can deeply afflict
politicians, it can easiy infect the press too.
The moral, then: don't give up on re
porters, but don't give them too much slack
either.
