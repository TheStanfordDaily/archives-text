## Beer ad ferments degrading stereotype 
### 
I was shocked and offended by the
Miller High Life advertisement in the
May 7 Daily. The cartoon depicted a
pile of empty beer cans with the cap
tion, "Same old story. These college
guys love you at night and toss you
out in the morning."
While this may seem like an inno
cent joke, I feel it, in fact, serves to
perpetuate the stereotype that col
lege males (probably all males) are
unfeeling primates who like nothing
better than to "shack up" with ran
dom women they know nothing
about — the moral equivalent of rape
— for one night and then discard
them in the morning. A thinking per
son would realize this cartoon is not
funny.
I hope in the future the Daily ex
ercises stricter editorial control. Such
advertisements only serve to implant
a degrading image of men in the
mind of an impressionable society
and to strain the already-strained re
lationship between men and women.

I was deeply disappointed by An
drew J. Preston's Stanford-area Bar
Review (Daily, May 6,1982). Particu
larly poignant chagrin was aroused
by his cavalier statement that no true
dive bars are to be found near Stan
ford. Not soiEd's Tavern on Emerson
Street and The Old Pro's on El
Camino, across from Palo Alto
Square, can, on "good" nights, rival
some of the dingiest dens in Barstow
or Bakersfield.

I am glad to hear that Jeff Phillips
(Daily, May 10) thinks that for women
to be career-minded is "the way it
should be," even if it is "un
fortunate" for the men on campus.
However, someone who ranks his

priorities as "sleeping, eating, study
ing, and social life, in that order"
should prepare his tender ego to be
turned down not only in favor of
Hum Bio exams, but also in favor of
Domino's pizza and early bedtimes
by all his acquaintances, male and

female. Or was Phillips implying that
men have a right to place careerism
and studies above social life and
women do not, despite "the way it
should be?"
