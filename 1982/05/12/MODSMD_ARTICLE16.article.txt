## Privilege discrepancies hurt staff 
### 
In the fall of 1981 the Academic Council appointed an
ad hoc Committee on the Adjunct Professoriate)
charged to "review the operation of the Adjunct Pro
fessoriate" including the "duties and privileges attached
to membership in the Academic Staff." A major impetus
behind the formation of the committee was that some
faculty members wish to expand the privileges granted
academic research staff members; other faculty mem
bers oppose such moves, citing concerns over the "dele
gation of intellectual control of the university to non
faculty" and "quality control."
To me the important issue to consider is the rela
tionship between the regular faculty and the academic
staff as a basis for considering the duties, responsibilities
and privileges of both groups. Most people on this cam
pus appear to take the differences between faculty and
other University staff as given. The duties and privileges
afforded members of the academic staff are dictated by
the Academic Council, in which members of the aca
demic staff are not included. Indeed, the ad hoc commit
tee is composed of members of the Academic Council,
with no representation from the academic staff (even in
ex officio status).
It may be more useful, however, to delineate the simi
larities between the faculty and the academic staff.
Whereas members of the faculty are hired to conduct re
search and teach, members of the academic staff-re
search (AS-R) are hired only to conduct research, and
members of the academic staff-teaching (AS-T) are hired
only to teach. Both the faculty and the academic staff
contribute to the mission and the overall reputation of
the University and influence its ability to raise money
and attract students. High standards of quality and schol
arship should be applied, if <hey are not at present, for
selecting members to both groups.
Yet hiring procedures differ. Faculty members are
selected through a process of faculty search committees
and are subject to a vote by other faculty and eventually
the Board of Trustees. AS-R members are selected by a
member of the faculty (principal investigator) and sub
ject to the approval of the chairperson, dean and prov
ost. Although the hiring procedures differ, it is not clear
that the standards applied and the quality of the persons
selected are any different.
But because the hiring practices and hence appoint
ments differ, members of the faculty and AS-R are af
forded very different privileges. The most apparent re
gards principal investigator status. Members of the facul
ty, evsn assistant professors just out of graduate school,
are allowed the privilege of trying to secure outside re
search funds in their own names and serving as principal
investigators. Members of the AS-R, although they may
be equally qualified in terms of past education and ex

perience, are not afforded that privilege.
Faculty members, once hired, are subject to no reivew
or evaluation regarding the quality and subject matter of
their research until tenure review. At that time eval
uation is based, in part, on peer review — both inside
and outside the University — of the quality and quantity
of the research performed. AS-R members are evaluated
by their principal investigator. Again procedures for pro
motion differ for members of both groups, but standards
may be quite similar.
Library proxy privileges, although much more minor,
equally symbolize differences between faculty and aca
demic staff. Whereas faculty are allowed to grant proxies
to student research assistants, ostensibly to aid in their
research endeavors, AS-R are not, although they too
conduct research for the University. Why the difference?
If the University is committed to high standards of
scholarship in research, then members of the academic
community who contribute to those endeavors — facul
ty and AS-R alike — should be treated more equally. To
the extent that AS-R and faculty perform similar duties,
are subject to similar standards and both contribute to
the University's reputation and status, they should
be granted similar privileges in carrying out those tasks.
Of course one major difference will always remain:
faculty are eligible for tenure, giving them financial se
curity for the rest of their lives. Securing outside funding
is never required of faculty; it only supplements or re
places internal University funding and allows them to
devote more time to research. AS-R are not eligible for
tenure and thus are forever dependent on outside fund
ing. Yet they are denied the opportunity to secure such
funding in their own name and based on their own ac
complishments. Why?
I submit that current practices of maintaining signifi
cant differences in the privileges between faculty and ac
ademic staff are detrimental to a most important Univer
sity goal: conducting quality research. They impair the
performance of current AS-R and encourage highly
qualified individuals to seek regular faculty appoint
ments elsewhere. They should be reconsidered.
I suggest that members of AS-R be granted the privi
lege of serving as principal investigator and library proxy
privileges. If members of the Academic Council feel that
hiring and promotion procedures do not insure similar
standards of scholarship and quality between faculty and
AS-R, then changes in these procedures should be con
sidered. Privileges for faculty and AS-R, who both con
duct research for the University, should be based on
standards of excellence, not dictated by the nature of the
particular appointments they hold.
