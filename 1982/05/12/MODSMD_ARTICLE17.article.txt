## On being gay: feelings and perceptions 
### Stuart Reges 
"You know, I hate being gay,"
said the boy, leaning over toward
Sutherland, "I just feel it's ruined
my life. I hate the lying to my fami
ly, and I know I'll never be any of
the things they expect of me, be
cause it's like having cancer but
you can't tell them, that's what a
secret vice is like."
Sutherland was speechless at
this declaration; he sat there for a
moment, with the cigarette
holder to his lips, perfectly still.
"Perhaps what you need," he said,
is a speculative tone, "is a good
facial." He turned quickly to his
friend and said: "Oh, darling, for
heaven's sake, don't take it so seri
ously/"
— Andrew Holleran, Dancer from
the Dance
Five years ago I was a senior in
high school. At the time I was, for
all intents and purposes, a heter
osexual. I was a virgin, like most of
my friends. I had a date for the
prom, a girl. We were deeply in
like with each other the way boys
and girls are at that age when they
meet in fourth period AP English
and find that they have dragons,
Virginia Woolf and dancing in
common.
Homosexuality was discussed
on occasion. I found the idea of
sex with a man mildly disgusting,
but I tried to be progressive about
it. Talking about it make me very
uncomfortable, which I hoped
nobody noticed. People who

were uncomfortable talking
about it probably were. And I cer
tainly wasn't one. Or at least, if I
were one, I wasn't about to admit
it to anyone, least of all myself. I
had big plans. I had always been
the favorite son and the teachers'
pet. I was even popular among
friends. Sex was unimportant. Or
rather, sex could be overlooked
for the time being. Eventually, I
said to myself, things might sort
themselves out. That was five
years ago.

When I first came to
Stanford I became a
gay crusader. I
wanted to tell straight
people all of the
things they didn't
know about us.

Since that time I have become
part of the gay community. That is,
being gay is now part of me. I
know what it is to be gay. I've ex
perienced it and I understand it. It
doesn't preoccupy my thoughts
now. It is as natural and as for
gettable to me as breathing is. But
it has taken five years.
I have difficulty writing an arti
cle like this. I have too much to say
in too little space. I start out with a
seemingly simple statement — I'm
gay — and I find that already I've

said 20 or 30 things that I didn't
want to. I've always wanted to
write an article that reads, "I have
no interest in pre-pubescent
boys; my mother was not close
binding; I do not wear women's
underwear to bed; I do not hate
women; I do not want to sleep
with every man ... but I'm gay."
When I first came to Stanford I
became a gay crusader. I wanted
to tell straight people all of the
things they didn't know about us.
Yes, some of us are happy. Yes,
some of us are Catholic. Yes, some
of are even happy and Catholic.
No, we don't want all of you to be
come gay too. The list goes on and
on and I still haven't even
scratched the surface. It soon be
came obvious that what took me
years to work through myself
would take years to explain to
someone else. And one also
quickly becomes aware of the fact
that Stanford has an inexhaustable
supply of ignorance. Every year
we import a new batch of fresh
misconceptions and stereotypes
from Grand Rapids, Michigan,
and Osh Kosh, Wisconsin, and
God knows where else.
And so I switched into the next
phase of political activism, the
"save a life through sex" syn
drome. It's only too easy at Stan
ford to fall into the trap of specula
tion. I get to know people and I
think to myself, if I hadn't had that
great period of depression during

senior year, and if I'd come here as
an undergraduate, i could be just
like him — seemingly straight but
actually gay. The demands of a
heterosexual lifestyle at Stanford
are trivial. Any gay person could
easily manage to "pass" (which
they often do). Stanford students
rarely deal with sex, let alone with
sexuality. So naturally someone
like myself learns the gentle and
the not so gentle methods of pro
ding people, trying to make
them question themselves. I try
not to do this anymore. Gay peo
ple, I've found, are like flowers:
they bloom in their own time.
Trying to force them along only
creates frustration all around.
Eventually I developed a repu
tation. And then I experienced to
lerance. It's what most of the gay
activists say we want. One thing
that can be said for Stanford is that
it is fairly tolerant. I've never
feared bodily harm. Verbal abuse
is minimal. People even manage
sometimes not to wince or to
snicker nervously when they find
out. I attribute this to the fact that
Stanford students are more in
telligent than most. It's not
modern to oppress gays, and Stan
ford students try to be modern.
But lack of hostility is not syno
nymous with acceptance or un
derstanding. Tolerant people still
indulge in those "where do you
people come from?" and "how do
you guys do it anyway?" looks. It's
a hostile curiosity. People are
dying to know but they're pretty
sure they won't like what they
hear. They're perfectly agreeable
to having gay people on campus,
but they're relieved that their
house, at least, is free of them. I
always find it the ultimate irony to
do a speaking engagement to an
audience who thinks I'm the first
gay person they've ever met and
mixed in with the crowd of 60 or
so house members are three gay
people I know.
I very soon realized that toler
ance meant very little to me. I
missed being part of the whole,
the way I was in high school. So I
tried something even more radi
cal. I stopped telling people that I
was gay.
That was right about the time I
started teaching. It seemed like
th'£ professional thing to do, to
keep things quiet. I like to have a
good working relationship with
my students, and I didn't want

being gay to stand in the way. I
had this terrible vision of my stu
dents going back to their dorms
after my first lecture and grumbl
ing to their roommates, "Six peo
ple teaching the course, and I
have to end up in the section with
the faggot."
I don't really have that fear any
more. I don't imagine my students
reacting that way. But I can see
that many of them would be
shocked. I don't think it's kind to
shock straight people with an off
the-cuff remark like, "My lecture
isn't completely prepared today
because the man I went out with
last night kept me out till four." I
don't like to throw it in people's
faces that way because they may
not be able to deal with it.

I very soon realized
that tolerance meant
very little to me. I
missed being part of
the whole.. .Sol
tried something even
more radical. I
stopped telling
people that I was gay.

But this week is different. This
week is the the time we set aside
to make everyone more aware of
gay people. This is our time to
share. There are so many things
straight people don't know about
us. We have our own humor, our
own customs, our own way of
dressing, even our own language.
Our community is strong and sup

portive in a way that most straight
people can't imagine. They don't
even know who most of us are.
People are too reluctant to talk
about gay issues. Nobody's quite
sure how to approach them, so
nobody does. I sometimes catch
bits and pieces of a conversation
about gays, but it never lasts long.
It's like an E. F. Hutton com
mercial: silence all around. Ev
erybody takes it so seriously.
People should remember that
this is Stanford. We should be in
formed on all topics. I don't ex
pect everyone to be pro-gay, but
at least they can be an informed
anti-gay. Informed anti-gay peo
ple are far more interesting than
simple-minded anti-gay people
who base their entire condemna
tion on Leviticus 20 verse 13, or
what Mama used to say or some
obscure formulation of
anatomical correctness.
We gay people don't always
help either. We give bitingly clev
er political speeches and bring up
old grudges like Oscar Wilde. We
only do that to make a point,
though. These things are impor
tant to us, and we want others to
appreciate it.
This is Gay Awareness Week, a
time for straight people to ask
questions, and a time for gay peo
ple to open up. The issue is so old
hat for most of us that we love to
babble about it. It's always fun to
talk about pain and anguish from
the past; it makes the present
seem so much brighter. We're a
fascinating people. Don't miss the
opportunity to know us better.
