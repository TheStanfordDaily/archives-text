# Senate boosts budget, student prices
## 
### Kathy Bodovitz Senior staff writer 
As part of its budget for 1982-03,
the ASSU senate voted unanimously
last night to increase Sunday Flicks
tickets to $1.50, ASSU T-shirts to $7.00
for those without Stanford IDs and
ASSU Lecture Notes to $8.00.
The Senate Finance Committee ex
pects these increases, plus other rev
enues, to add $20,000 to the '82-'B3
budget, raising the total budget from
$81,380 in '81-'B2 to $100,530 in '82-
'83, according to Finance Committee
Chair Mark Epstein. He said the ASSU
believes it needs to improve and in

crease services and because the Uni
versity has not agreed to help with
the additional expenses, the only op
tion was to increase the revenues
from ASSU projects.
The increased revenue will be al
located to three areas.
The first area is salaries. Epstein
said, "Although we reaffirm our
commitment to volunteerism, we
also realize that the association is
competing for student labor and that
we must reimburse students for ex
traordinary time commitment." Thus
new stipends will be allocated for the
Intern Director, Safety Commission

and salaries in the Office of Public Af
fairs.
The second area is communication
to the students. Epstein said, "(this
year) we have not been effective at
disseminating information to the stu
dent body," and attributed the fail
ure mainly to "the lack of budget
priority given to publicity."
Therefore publicity for next year
will be increased from $3675 to $8565.
In addition, the Office of Public Af
fairs budget will be increased from
$1500 to $5335 to cover the basic op
erating costs of a small advertis
ing/promotion office. Epstein also

said $1045 is budgeted for reproduc
tion of the text of the ASSU constitu
tion and by-laws to be distributed to
association officers and members, as
well as to University administrators.
Ttiird, from the to "develop
a sense of unity ana camaraderie
among the officers, employees and
active volunteers of the association,"
a new line item entitled Special
Gatherings has been budgeted, Eps
tein said. This includes $900 for happy
hours and $600 for parties intended
rot only to provide camaraderie, but
as opportunities to acquaint all stu
dents with the ASSU.
Epstein said the price increases in
ASSU projects were necessitated by
the University's contention, based on
an agreement in 1975, that it will only
pay for those services it would be ob
ligated to provide if there were no
ASSU. These include banking ser
vices for student groups and dorms
and minimum lake safety, according
to Margaret Ann Fidler, assistant
dean of student affairs.
The ASSU and the Office of the
Dean of Student Affairs have been
negotiating for nine months over the
'82-'B3 budget and, according to Eps
tein, "We just can't wait any longer"
to draw up a budget.
"Generally," Fidler said, "the kinds
of things they're doing — raising
prices to make a larger governance
structure — is an appropriate trade
off for student leaders to make."
In other business the senate last
night unanimously approved the re
sults of the April 28-29 elections. The
only results not already announced
are the Student Conduct Legislative
Council members: Nathan Selden,
Maria Doelger and Don Willenburg.
The senate also approved the new
project managers for next year:
Course Guide — Russell Poore and
Matt Rattner; Guest Professorship
Bureau — Robert Greenberg; Lec
ture Notes — Alex Van Riesen; Re
cycling — Fred Beddell and Leslie
Young; Sunday Flicks — Scott Culley;
T-Shirts — Tom Shapiro; and Speak
ers' Bureau — Susan Jones.
