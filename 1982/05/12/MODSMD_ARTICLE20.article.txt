"Filthy" conduct
Filthy McNasty's, a popular Kent State
bar in Kent, Ohio, has been suspended
for allowing male go-go dancers to ex
pose themselves, allowing improper con
tact with the dancers and selling a mixed
drink to a minor.
Owner Joseph March maintains he is
innocent and that nothing went wrong. In
particular, he insists that no dancer ex
posed himself.
"I've got a ton of witnesses including a
lot of fairly important people. I had some
of my friends' mothers and fathers there,"
he said. "These guys (the dancers) are
professionals. They know how to do their
job and what they can and can't do."
Marsh said it is "very possible" that the
customers touched the dancers while
putting money in the dancer's belts.
But Marsh said he was particularly in
censed by the charge of serving alcohol to
a minor.
"We don't let kids in the bar. We're the
toughtest in Kent and the police know it,"
he said. According to March a 21-year-old
bought two drinks and gave one to his un
der-age friend.
"If you can come up with a way of en
forcing that, I'd like to know it,"he said.
"They could go in any bar and catch
somebody. I've got people checking
stamps and throwing away drinks all
night."
Marsh said he is perplexed by the situ
ation. "All I know is we ran a real tight
ship," Marsh said. "I guess somebody
didn't like us doing the dances. Once the
agents come into you club, they're going
to do something."

Roach Week
While Stanford students are suffering
through Dead Week, students at Oklaho
ma State University who live in Murray
Hall are celebrating Dead Roach Week.
Roach Week became a tradition in
Murray Hall when it opened in 1975. Ac
tivities include "roach games," a dance,
and an awards banquet complete with
"roach" and "roachette" honors. The an
nual festival is a spring tradition which
honors all residents of Murray, one of the

smaller dorms at OSU. "We had too few
people living here to win any awards at
the (campus-wide) RHA banquet/' said
Head Resident Pam Lane. "We decided to
have our own banquet and award
ourselves. The reason we called it Roach
Week is because at that time there were as
many roaches as there were students liv
ing there."
A tradition of Roach Week is the leg

endary figure of Sebastian Roach. Each
year, he is the focus of a new story. This
spring, Sebastian Roach VI was the tragic
hero. Diagnosed as a sclerosis victime, he
had to undergo emergency surgery at the
Murray Hall Roach clinic. It proved un
successful, however, so Roach Week was
marred by the necessity of a funeral, com
plete with mourners, pallbearers, a eulo
gy and a tiny roach-sized wooden casket.
An udder delight
Speaking of unusual celebrations, Ore
gon State University of Corvallis recently
highlighted the midpoint of the spring
term with their annual "Cow Day." The
event was sponsored by the Agricultural
Executive Council and included demon
strations .n sheep shearing, double buck
sawing and hay bale stacking. Participants
were rewarded with strawberry shortcake
and a ride on a mechanical bull.
The event is co-sponsored by the Me
morial Union Program Council, and was
conceived to "promote agriculture at
OSU," said Cow Day Chairwoman Julie
Hering.
Winners ioss out
The recent questioning of election re
sults for next year's ASSU positions was
not unique to Stanford. The spring elec
tion of student officers at University of
New Mexico has been invalidated by the
Associated Students of UNM, and the
election will have to be reheld.
Gross negligence and incompetence
were the charges brought against the
ASUNM Elections Committee during the
March 31 student elections, the student
court ruled in an appeal from student

government Attorney General Gary
Gordon.
The elections commission was charged
with violating the election code by not
specifying voting locations on campus, by
not allowing poll watchers to accurately
monitor the ballot tabulations and by in
adequately reviewing all campaign mate
rial.
During the election, a new president,
vice-president and 12 student senators
were selected for ASUNM positions.
However, the only races which will be af
fected by the decision of the elections
commission are those of president and
vice-president, since there were only 12
candidates who ran for the 12 senator
positions.
Elven Romero, elections commission
chairman, plans to appeal the ruling all
the way to the UNM regents, if necessary,
and might even take it to the District
Court.
"It's crazy," Romero said. "The allega
tions are totally untrue. What this is, ac
tually, is tied to the (state) governor's
race." The reason that Romero feels this
way is that, according to him, all the stu
dent court justice, the student attorney
general and outgoing ASUMN President
Mike Austin are strong supporters of
Democratic gubernatorial candidate
Toney Anaya, while most of the elections
commission members and newly elected
president Michael Gallegos support
gubernatorial candidate Aubrey Dunn.
Admission competition
Stanford may be one of the toughest
schools in the country to get into, but ad
missions elsewhere are also stiffening. At
Williams College in Williams, Massachu
setts, 21 percent of the class of '86

hopefuls received acceptance letters last
week, as compared to 23.5 percent the
year before. The Admissions Office re
viewed 4426 applications this year.
The 21 percent acceptance rate puts
Williams with Stanford in an elite group of
schools. Only six to 10 schools admit
fewer than 25 percent of their applicants,
according to Williams admissions of
ficials.
Debate rages over KKK leader
From Collegiate Headlines:
Edwin Deßarr was one of the first four
professors of Oklahoma University and
was the founder of its engineering,
chemistry and pharmacy programs. He
was also a Grand Dragon in the Ku Klux
- Klan, according to OU research oi the
70s.
The OU Student Congress is currently
debating whether Deßarr's KKK activity
warrants stripping his name from a cam
pus building. A resolution advocating
changing the name of Deßarr Hall failed
in SC recently, but was reconsidered and
tabled for the summer while its backers
do more research, said Greg Kubiak, stu
dent body president.
He believes that unless Deßarr can be
linked directly to criminal activity, Deßarr
Hall will remain Deßarr Hall. "There are
two issues here — a moral and ethical
question, which most of us feel he's guilty
of violating, and a criminal question,
which hasn't been proven," said Kubiak.
If proponents of the name change can't
prove Deßarr commented criminal acts
while in the KKK, it's unlikely the OU re
gents would accept any student resolu
tion to dishonor his name, said Kubiak.
