## Third shot at singles crown Moulton dreams of team title 
### Sid Spaeth 
Alycia Moulton has twice
been denied the collegiate sin
gles title in the last match of the
season, but to her, what is more
important is that she has never
been on a national cham
pionship team.
This year, Moulton leads the
nation's strongest team into
the first NCAA National Wom
en's Tennis Tournament in Salt
Lake City May 15-22 and can
almost taste the championship.
Stanford, 15-0, will be fa
vored to win the tournament
— a title they haven't won since
1978 and one year before
Moulton enrolled at Stanford.
"I have never been on a
championshipteam," Moulton
said. "Right now, all my con
centration is on that. I'm a little
nervous about it because we
were undefeated. We haven't
slipped up yet, we just hope we
can keep the momentum
going."
Stanford rolling to its first un
defeated season since 1970,
was not without problems, but
a 5-4 win over USC was their
only challenge of the season.
Injuries temporarily side
lined Elise Burgin and Kate
Gompert and coach Frank
Brennan was forced to move
Moulton and Caryn Copeland,
the defending champion

doubles team, down to the No.
2 spot after a slow start.
The Cardinal is now healthy
going into Sunday's team com
petition and Moulton and
Copeland are back on top of
both their game and the lad
der.
"Caryn and I are playing ex
ceptionally well," Moulton
said. "We are playing better
now than at the end of last year
which says a lot. It's difficult to
keep something going for that
long which probably explains
our let-up earlier this season."
As for leading the team in
singles like she has the last
three years, "It's nothing un
usual. I'll be playing the same
girls I've played all year."
Moulton calls this year's
team, the best team she has
been on since coming to Stan
ford and winning All-America
honors three times.
"This team has a different at
titude," she explained. "Ev
eryone on the team has con
fidence that we have the
capability to win."
Stanford's powerful line-up
has also improved Moulton's
game.
"Having Elise (Burgin) and
Kate (Gompert) around has
been the best thing for my
game. Before, I wasn't being
pushed because there was not

as much competition. Now,
either Kate or Elise could play
N0.1."
When individual competi
tion gets under way, Moulton
will again start the long march
to the championship she lost
last year to USC's Anna Maria
Fernandez and two years ago
to Wendy White of Rollins.
"I'd really like to win the ti
tle," she said. "Especially since
I got to the final the last two
years. It's a difficult spot to be
in, but only because I am put
ting a lot of pressure on myself.
There are a lot of up-and-com
ing players who I would not be
extremely upset if I lost to —
some of them are on my team
— namely, Elise and Kate."
Moulton should be the fa
vorite going into the tour
nament, if not the No. 1 seed,
but feels she must overcome
the biggest criticism of her
game — concentration lapses.
"It is definitely one of the
biggest problems with my
game, but what a lot of people
don't understand is that that
kind of problem goes with my
style of play — agressive. I try
and win the points. It's hard for
a serve-and-volley player to
consistently win by big margins
so it's not as unusual as it
seems.
"I tend to let things get close,

but on the other hand, I play
well under pressure."
While Stanford was closing
out the regular season im
pressively with an 8-1 thrashing
of No. 2 UCLA Saturday,
Moulton closed out a typically
tight contest against Katherin
Keil 7-6, 7-6. Moulton came
back from 5-3 deficits in both
sets and eked out identical 7-5
tiebreakers.
In doubles, Moulton and
Copeland finished in a flurry
burying Lynn Lewis and
Heather Ludloff 6-1, 6-4. Lewis
and Ludloff had sported a 16-1
record before the match in
cluding a victory over Moulton
and Copeland.
Match points
Stanford qualified eight
players for the individual tour
nament of the NCAA's which
will begin next Thursday fol
lowing the team tournament.
In singles, the Card will send
Moulton, Burgin, Gompert,
Linda Gates, Michelle Weiss
and Copeland.
Four doubles teams have
also qualified — Moulton-
Copeland, Burgin-Gates,
Weiss-Gompert and Sue
Rasmussen-Alison Hardey.
