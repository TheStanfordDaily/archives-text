# Benjamin helps athletes improve mental side

### Sid Spaeth 
San Francisco 49er quarter
back Guy Benjamin was a
freshman at Stanford in 1973
when President Richard Lyman
granted $12,000 to a committee
of student athletes to give them
a voice in the Athletic Depart
ment and the community. The
committee has since been
holding a class for Stanford ath
letes labelled with a mouthful
of words the Experimental
Seminar on Optimal Human
Performance in the Social
Thought and Institutions de
partment.
Friday, the committee will
feature a benefit basketball
game at Maples Pavilion be
tween the World Champion
49ers and the Stanford varsity
athletes at 7:30 p.m.
Benjamin will join 49ers Joe
Montana, Dwight Clark, Randy
Cross, Freddie Solomon and
Mike Schuman against John
Elway, Matt Moran, Doug Rog
ers, Ken Margerum and Turk
Schonert in an exhibition to
earn money to sponsor guest
speakers and fund the psy
chological experiments of the
class.
Benjamin, who took the class
under George Pegelow in 1973,
has been involved with the
project since its origin and now
teaches the class with Pegelow.
"We try and work on the
mental side of sports," Ben
jamin said. "The class was
started to try and raise the
awareness of the athlete in the
social structure. It has changed
a little over the years, but
basically we try and help the
athletes with problems, wheth
er it be injuries, academics or
disagreements with their
coaches."
Dave Meggyesy, the
Western Director of the Na
tional Football League Players
Association, taught the class for

a few years and has carried its
ideas into his work, while Ben
jamin used the approach with
the 49er's.
"When I was here," Ben
jamin continued, "we liked to
carry our approach over to
team meetings where all the
players would get together.
"This man — the one with
the smile on his face," Ben
jamin took a picture of Bill
Walsh off the wall, "used to tell
us, 'why don't you go have a
team meeting.' He didn't know
what they were about, he just
knew they worked."
Pegelow said the class deals
mainly with concentration,
anxiety attacks, mental re
hearsal and energy awareness
through an "inter-personal re
lationship."
"The idea is that we take re
sponsibility for ourselves,"
Benjamin explained. "We have
team meetings and talk about
team problems and team
goals."
Last fall, the Stanford football
team had a "team meeting"
before the Oregon State game
and went on to win the next
three games.
"This class was not the rea
son they went out and won
those games," Benjamin
added, "but it helped the
players focus their emotions.
The emotions and the truth
help the guys to always find a
rallying point —especially dur
ing bad seasons when they real
ly need something to grasp
onto."
Both Pegelow and Benjamin
note the success the program
has offered.
"We've really seen some en
couraging things," Benjamin
said. "Just about all of the ath
letes who have taken the class
— I think one year we had just
about every football player —
have commented on its effec

tiveness. Some athletes have
come back and said it has
helped them in their pro
fessional careers. I know it has
helped mine.
"As a pro athlete, I look
around the league — there is so
much talent everywhere you
look. The difference is the
mental approach they take. It
really stimulated me to get
going and we're hoping it will
help other players as well.
Currently, Benjamin and
Pegelow teach the two-quarter
class on Tuesdays and
Thursdays for Stanford ath
letes.
"It helps the athletes de
velop skills to optimize their
performance," Pegelow said.
Benjamin teaches the class
because of the effect it had on
him.
"I dived into it because it
seemed to help me," Benjamin
said. "Now it interests me to
help other people, plus, I like
to stay close to the Stanford
community and this is an alter
native to the Buck Club and
other alumni organizations."
Pegelow admits that the field
is new, but is blossoming rapid
ly. Currently the California, Ar
izona State and lowa swim
teams use the approach, the
U.S. Olympic Training Camp
has instituted it and Sweden
has a national program.
"It's really a new field,"
Pegelow said, "but so much is
happening right now."
Benjamin said since the idea
is so young, they get a lot of
help from the world authorities
on the idea.
"It's like a closed fraternity/'
Benjamin explained. "We were
fortunate to be able to tap into
it."
Friday night, athletes in
volved with the program from
both Stanford and the 49ers
will play basketball to raise
money for the committee be
cause, Benjamin said, "We
don't get a lot of help."
Tickets are on sale at all Bass
outlets and will be on sale at
the door. Price of admission is
$4 for adults and $3 for children
under 12.

San Francisco 49er quarter
back Guy Benjamin was a
freshman at Stanford in 1973
when President Richard Lyman
granted $12,000 to a committee
of student athletes to give them
a voice in the Athletic Depart
ment and the community. The
committee has since been
holding a class for Stanford ath
letes labelled with a mouthful
of words the Experimental
Seminar on Optimal Human
Performance in the Social
Thought and Institutions de
partment.
Friday, the committee will
feature a benefit basketball
game at Maples Pavilion be
tween the World Champion
49ers and the Stanford varsity
athletes at 7:30 p.m.
Benjamin will join 49ers Joe
Montana, Dwight Clark, Randy
Cross, Freddie Solomon and
Mike Schuman against John
Elway, Matt Moran, Doug Rog
ers, Ken Margerum and Turk
Schonert in an exhibition to
earn money to sponsor guest
speakers and fund the psy
chological experiments of the
class.
Benjamin, who took the class
under George Pegelow in 1973,
has been involved with the
project since its origin and now
teaches the class with Pegelow.
"We try and work on the
mental side of sports," Ben
jamin said. "The class was
started to try and raise the
awareness of the athlete in the
social structure. It has changed
a little over the years, but
basically we try and help the
athletes with problems, wheth
er it be injuries, academics or
disagreements with their
coaches."
Dave Meggyesy, the
Western Director of the Na
tional Football League Players
Association, taught the class for

a few years and has carried its
ideas into his work, while Ben
jamin used the approach with
the 49er's.
"When I was here," Ben
jamin continued, "we liked to
carry our approach over to
team meetings where all the
players would get together.
"This man — the one with
the smile on his face," Ben
jamin took a picture of Bill
Walsh off the wall, "used to tell
us, 'why don't you go have a
team meeting.' He didn't know
what they were about, he just
knew they worked."
Pegelow said the class deals
mainly with concentration,
anxiety attacks, mental re
hearsal and energy awareness
through an "inter-personal re
lationship."
"The idea is that we take re
sponsibility for ourselves,"
Benjamin explained. "We have
team meetings and talk about
team problems and team
goals."
Last fall, the Stanford football
team had a "team meeting"
before the Oregon State game
and went on to win the next
three games.
"This class was not the rea
son they went out and won
those games," Benjamin
added, "but it helped the
players focus their emotions.
The emotions and the truth
help the guys to always find a
rallying point —especially dur
ing bad seasons when they real
ly need something to grasp
onto."
Both Pegelow and Benjamin
note the success the program
has offered.
"We've really seen some en
couraging things," Benjamin
said. "Just about all of the ath
letes who have taken the class
— I think one year we had just
about every football player —
have commented on its effec

tiveness. Some athletes have
come back and said it has
helped them in their pro
fessional careers. I know it has
helped mine.
"As a pro athlete, I look
around the league — there is so
much talent everywhere you
look. The difference is the
mental approach they take. It
really stimulated me to get
going and we're hoping it will
help other players as well.
Currently, Benjamin and
Pegelow teach the two-quarter
class on Tuesdays and
Thursdays for Stanford ath
letes.
"It helps the athletes de
velop skills to optimize their
performance," Pegelow said.
Benjamin teaches the class
because of the effect it had on
him.
"I dived into it because it
seemed to help me," Benjamin
said. "Now it interests me to
help other people, plus, I like
to stay close to the Stanford
community and this is an alter
native to the Buck Club and
other alumni organizations."
Pegelow admits that the field
is new, but is blossoming rapid
ly. Currently the California, Ar
izona State and lowa swim
teams use the approach, the
U.S. Olympic Training Camp
has instituted it and Sweden
has a national program.
"It's really a new field,"
Pegelow said, "but so much is
happening right now."
Benjamin said since the idea
is so young, they get a lot of
help from the world authorities
on the idea.
"It's like a closed fraternity/'
Benjamin explained. "We were
fortunate to be able to tap into
it."
Friday night, athletes in
volved with the program from
