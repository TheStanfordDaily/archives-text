# Cal and Washington favored in Pac-10s
## Bears cautiously await Huskies 
### 
Redwood Shores — For the
University of California crew,
which will man the favored
boat in the Pacific-10 regatta
Saturday and Sunday at
Redwood Shores, lessons of
the past are not wasted.
Lesson one: never under
estimate the arch-rival Univer
sity of Washington Huskies and
their resourceful coach Dick
Erickson. Not even after beat
ing the Huskies twice in the
same rowing season as the sur
prising Golden Bears have
done this year.
Although Cal defeated
Washington en route to a stun
ning victory in the San Diego
Crew Classic on Mission Bay
and then again in head-to
head competition on Oakland
Estuary, Mike Livingston, the
Bear's second-year coach, was
not ready to forecast a victory
at Redwood Shores.
For one reason, California
enjoyed precisely the same ad
vantage two years ago when
the Huskies — their boat re
vamped by some eleventh
hour changes in personnel by
Erickson — stroked to an upset
victory over Cal in the Pac-10
finals.
For another, Washington
made up considerable water
between one race with Cal and
another — losing by a veritable
heartbeat the second time the
two crews met.
"It seems like Washington
can be best when rowing from
a position of adversity," said
Livingston. "We beat them by
seven seconds in San Diego
and one second in the dual at
Oakland. We can only hope
they don't pick up another six
seconds on us."
Erickson, while admitting
- Ijjis is not the kind of season he
had hoped for after winning a
second straight Pac-10 title a
year ago, agreed that the sec
ond meeting between Cal and
Washington had not provided
; any conclusive result.
"Meeting Cal at Redwood
; Shores is all we have been look
i ihfc-. forwafd* to," said the
■ Huskies'wily coach. "We got a
psychological lift from one
race to another against Cal. We
! have a really good crew up
J here. We know what we can do
and they know what they can
do.
"We proved a big point in
Oakland — we can race with
ihem. We weren't ready, that's
all. There is no way I could
knock California, but the last
time we met it wasn't a race, it
was a water fight because of the
conditions on the estuary.
Redwood Shores will be even
; water. We couldn't ask for a
better place to meet them."
Livingston also likes the
prospect of rowing at

Redwood Shores.
"What we're looking for is
good, flat water," he said. "I
don't mind light winds, but I do
like it very flat. At San Diego,
there was a relatively strong
quartering tailwind and at the
dual there was a direct tailwing.
Both courses had what I would
call a moderate chop. To date,
we haven't raced in ideal con
ditions."
The Cal coach said he much
prefers the prospect of meet
ing the Huskies head-to-head,
which was not the case at San
Diego where Cal notched an
unprecedented sweep in the
varsity, junior varsity and
freshman finals. In the San Die
go varsity final, Yale, Harvard
and Cornell were also in
volved.
"I think when you have two
high quality crews like Cal and
Washington, the dual format is
more of a test," said Livingston.
"When there are more than
two crews in a race you are
going out just to cover the dis
tance as quick as you can. In a
dual, you are responding to the
other boat's moves."
Livingston said he is grat
ified, but not completely sur
prised by the success of his
varsity crew this season. Six of
the nine members of a crew
that lost to Washington in the
Pac-10 semifinals are back this
season.
"I can't imagine having a
more competent or motivated
and mature group of athletes,"
he said. "Despite their inability
to beat Washington they were
a fine crew last year.
"Our one sophomore is an
excellent athlete. Our three
juniors were members of a pre
light crew that won the Thames
Cup at Henley and our seniors
have been around a long time.
The crew rows well technically
and they are real aggressive. If
all goes well, we'll race Wash
ington in the Pac-10 finals."
Erickson said he would not
resist making last-minute
switches in his varsity boat if he
felt that's what it would take to
beat California.
