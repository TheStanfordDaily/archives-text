# Stanford beats Cal
## 
### Jenyth Gearhart 
Racing under less-than
perfect conditions at Redwood
Shores last weekend, the Stan
ford women's varsity crew de
feated California at the Big Re
gatta. Redwood Shores will be
the site of the Pac-10 Cham
pionships Saturday and Sun
day.
The Bears had come out on
top at the San Diego Crew Clas
sic earlier this season, but Stan
ford has improved at the rate
John Davis predicted.
"The issue is still not settled
between Stanford and Cal,"
Davis said, "however, it is nice
to know we can beat them and
should beat them this week
end."
If both Cal and Stanford win
their Saturday morning heats as
expected, they will rematch in
the semi-finals Saturday after
noon. The winner will proba
bly face Washington in Sun
day's final.
Davis believes Washington's
lightning-fast crew is an indica
tion of the progress women
have made in rowing over the
last five years.
"When someone knocks
them off, women's rowing will
be close to its potential. And, of
course, I would like to see us
beat them."
The winner of the Pac-10's
will qualify for the national
championships in Connecti
cut.
The Stanford men didn't fare
as well against the top-ranked
Cal team. Cal swept all the
races, but Stanford coach Bob
Whitford felt Stanford could
have rowed better. "We are
much faster than we rowed to
day," Whitford said.
Monday, Stanford reached
the finals of the Western
Sprints in Long Beach and fin
ished fourth behind UCLA,
UC-lrvine and Santa Clara.
