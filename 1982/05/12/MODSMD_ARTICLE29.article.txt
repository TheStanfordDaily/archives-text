In a New York Daily survey it was revealed that 70
percent of top NFL prospects will not graduate this spring.
This figure, probably low because it includes all red-shirts
who have had five years to complete school, shows how
badly the NCAA sanctions have missed the boat in trying to
better prepare its athletes for post-stardom life.
The Arizona Republic reported that Arizona State's top
four pro prospects — running backs Robert Weathers and
Gerald Riggs, quarterback Mike Pagel and guard John
Meyer — will all enter pro football with more than one year
of academic requirements left.
Susann Tomek, academic adviser for ASU's football team,
doesn't blink an eye when she looks at the figures.
"It's impossible to graduate in four years," she said, "but I
never say that (to incoming freshman). It can be done. It is
done. But not very often."
Arizona State, beaming with academic pride, points out
that they offer five-year scholarships to all of their players so
they can return and complete their degrees. John Mistier of
the New York Giants returned this spring to complete his
degree.
Pagel (remember: the guy who put on a one-man arms
race against Stanford last fall, but had to write the plays
down on his wrist) has the toughest load since he plays
baseball in the spring.
"It's surprising," he said. "I can get more studying done
during the football season because the schedule remains
the same. But with baseball, the schedule changes each
week, and it throws you out of whack.'
Although football is long over for Meyer and Weathers,
they are taking only a combined 17 (semester) hours be
cause of various NFL minicamps this spring.
"I was taking 12 hours," Meyer said. "But I've been trav
eling a lot lately. And some teachers just don't understand
that." (Some do?).
If those 70 percent return to school, this story does not
have to have a sad ending, but as long as the NCAA con
tinues to cut down trees like free T-shirts from UCLA alums
and ticket sales from USC assistant coaches, a forest of
"Tree" Rollinses and Sam Gilberts will continue to flourish.
Let's make a decision. Either they play and learn and grad
uate, or they play. Let's not waste their time sitting in class if
they don't want to get a degree, let them practice some
more — that is their future.

The ballots aren't all in, but it will be interesting to see
who is having more fun. Darrin Nelson blasting Minnesota
or the Minnesota Press blasting Nelson.
The Minneapolis Star facetiously reported that the city of
Minneapolis will enact an ordinance for Darrin Nelson al
lowing the city's discos to remain open until 10 p.m. Nelson,
you see, wasn't so excited about the Minneapolis social life.
Oh well, wait for fall. Nelson will love the offense and the
press won't be cracking bad jokes for long.

Gimme's — A word about NBC's junk sports line-up —
ENOUGH! Lucky they pre-empted the Houston Open's
playoff for that unbelievable drama of lightweight karate/
boxing and the edge-of-the-seat action of the silver dollar
lift in the world's strongest man competition. Maybe we
need another Heidi scandal to shake up the networks ...
Somehow you have to feel sorry for "Sugar-coated public
ity" Ray Leonard. With a little bit of luck, he'll recover from
eye surgery completely, but decide to retire anyway and go
into the real estate business.
