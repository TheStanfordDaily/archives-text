# Trustees approve clock tower, $3 M parking lot
## 
### Joan O'Connell 
Even in the midst of a meeting mainly concerned
with renovations and restorations, the University
Board of Trustees yesterday made the time for a
brand new structure — and approved a brand new
structure for the time — when it O.K.'d plans for a
new clock tower to be built in White Plaza.
The tower will house a clock and bells which are
duplicates of the Winchester Musical Chimes of
London and were originally located here in a struc
ture demolished by the 1906 earthquake. The 45-
foot high structure is made possible by a $250,000
gift by an anonymous donor and scheduled to be
completed next fall, following the board's stamp of
approval yesterday.
The trustees also agreed to spend up to $3 mil
lion on new parking facilities for the Stanford

Shopping Center with»n the next few years, creat
ing between 692 and 733 additional spaces. This
will be necessary because an agreement exists with
tenants at the shopping center.
"In 1975, agreement was reached with the major
tenants to provide certain ratios of parking to gross
leasable areas of stores upon the addition of an
other major store," according to a report to the
board.
A new, major tenant who will construct either a
two- or three-story store is likely to begin con
struction in June 1983. This site for the store sits on
approximately 200 existing spaces, creating a defi
cit according to the agreement, and so the board
authorized the expenditure.
It has not yet been determined whether the
spaces will be created at ground level, or in a struc

ture.
The board also approved a $625,000 project to
renovate Cubberley Auditorium, a move which
will improve sightlines by restructured seating ar
rangements, provide seats with writing surfaces
and improve illumination and ventilation through
out, a report to the board states.
The Building 1-120 renovation, an $11 million
project to date, was given an additional $1.3 mil
lion in funding, after reconsideration of initial
budget figures. Building 1-120 will house the Soci
ology and Communication Departments. Un
fortunately, initial plans called for a more op
timistic fundraising strategy than proved feasible
and some unexpected expenses emerged in the in
terim.
The additional funding was sought
to purchase an adequate level of
furnishings, meet new program and
energy standards, meet increased
costs to implement new man
agement policies and meet addi
tional fees, material testing and ac
tivation costs.
When completed, the renovations
will modernize the existing depart
ment facilities and provide for TV stu
dio and laboratories for the Comm
munication Dept.
A letter was read to the board by
University President Donald Ken
nedy concerning the Research Li
braries Group (RLG). RLG is a corpo
ration owned by 26 of the nation's
major universities and research in
stitutions, including Stanford. It was
established in 1974 as a step toward
creating interdependent collections
of research and scholarly data to be
shared by universities and research
institutions.
According to a report to the board,
"One of the most important objec
tives in establishing RLG was to
create a computer-based biblio
graphic processing system that
would improve efficiency in library
operations, link RLG programs, and
afford library patrons searching for

information an increased and more
flexible set of access points than is
possible in card catalogs."
The idea has come under fire this
year, due to problems with the com
puter system which have produced
far less impressive results than were
expected.
The work of the RLG is "generally
recognized as essential," Robert Ro
senzweig, vice president for public
affairs, told the Daily last night, al
though whether it turns out in the
end best done by that group is un
certain. Rosenzweig said that the
problems with the system are transi
tory .. . and solvable.
"They are extreme but expectable,
because they are pressing available
technology as far as it can go," he
said.
Kennedy, in a presentation to the
board, recommended that Stanford
— which serves as the host institution
for the group — provide a long-term
loan of $300,000 in order to support
the computer for the rest of the year
and incorporate incremental costs
into financial projections. Rosen
zweig said the question prompted
"justified concern with how ap
propriate furthercommitment by the
University would be," but the board
eventually approved Kennedy's pro
posal.
"RLG is the best opportunity for
right now," Rosenzweig said.
