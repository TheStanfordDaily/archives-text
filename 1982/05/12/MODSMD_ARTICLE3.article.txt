# Trustees approve clock tower, $3 M parking lot
## 
### Joan O'Connell 
Even in the midst of a meeting mainly concerned
with renovations and restorations, the University
Board of Trustees yesterday made the time for a
brand new structure — and approved a brand new
structure for the time — when it O.K.'d plans for a
new clock tower to be built in White Plaza.
The tower will house a clock and bells which are
duplicates of the Winchester Musical Chimes of
London and were originally located here in a struc
ture demolished by the 1906 earthquake. The 45-
foot high structure is made possible by a $250,000
gift by an anonymous donor and scheduled to be
completed next fall, following the board's stamp of
approval yesterday.
The trustees also agreed to spend up to $3 mil
lion on new parking facilities for the Stanford

Shopping Center with»n the next few years, creat
ing between 692 and 733 additional spaces. This
will be necessary because an agreement exists with
tenants at the shopping center.
"In 1975, agreement was reached with the major
tenants to provide certain ratios of parking to gross
leasable areas of stores upon the addition of an
other major store," according to a report to the
board.
A new, major tenant who will construct either a
two- or three-story store is likely to begin con
struction in June 1983. This site for the store sits on
approximately 200 existing spaces, creating a defi
cit according to the agreement, and so the board
authorized the expenditure.
It has not yet been determined whether the
spaces will be created at ground level, or in a struc

ture.
The board also approved a $625,000 project to
renovate Cubberley Auditorium, a move which
will improve sightlines by restructured seating ar
rangements, provide seats with writing surfaces
and improve illumination and ventilation through
out, a report to the board states.
The Building 1-120 renovation, an $11 million
project to date, was given an additional $1.3 mil
lion in funding, after reconsideration of initial
budget figures. Building 1-120 will house the Soci
ology and Communication Departments. Un
fortunately, initial plans called for a more op
timistic fundraising strategy than proved feasible
and some unexpected expenses emerged in the in
terim.
