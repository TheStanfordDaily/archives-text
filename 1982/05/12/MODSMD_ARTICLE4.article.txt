British sink tanker, tighten grip on Falklands
London — A British warship opened fire on an Argentine supply
vessel, sinking it early yesterday in Falkland Sound, which divides the
two main islands of the Falkland archipelago, the British government
said here. There were no reports of survivors.
Reports from the flagship of the British task force, HMS Hermes, said
that the frigate Alacrity had entered the sound during the night on pa
trol and spotted an Argentine vessel in the widest part of the sound,
which ranges up to 30 miles in width.
The frigate opened fire with its 4.5-inch guns and hit the target, which
"exploded in a fireball," according to witnesses.
The flagship said that the British had so far spotted no survivors and
because of the explosion's intensity, there was little hope of finding any.
The staff of the naval task force aboard the Hermes said that the Ar
gentine vessel apparently was a tanker traveling from East Falkland to
West Falkland Island, bringing fuel to the Argentine garrison, which is
now cut off from the main base at Port Stanley, capital of the island.
The fact that the engagement took place inside Falkland Sound in
dicated that British warships were now moving at will, not only around
the Falkland Islands, but through the main channel between the two
islands.
"I think this shows how tight our grip is on the islands," said British
defense spokesman lan McDonald.
The action in the South Atlantic came as Prime Minister Margaret
Thatcher met in London with her inner "crisis Cabinet" to determine
how serious the Argentine junta is in the last-ditch negotiations being
conducted at the United Nations.
She also addressed Parliament yesterday concerning the nego
tiations, declaring: "There are certain fundamental principles which we
cannot fudge in any way."
For instance, any cease-fire in the Falklands "must be accompanied
by withdrawal by Argentines to a specific timetable," she said.
"We must also make sure Argentina does not enter into negotiations
in the belief that by the end of them, sovereignty is ceded to them," she
added.
U.N. head demands peace soon
United Nations — Secretary General Javier Perez de
Cuellar, in the fourth day of his drive for peace in the
South Atlantic, pressed Argentine and British nego
tiators yesterday to reach a peace agreement within a
"couple of days."
Arriving at his office to begin another series of sep
arate interviews, first with Argentina's deputy Foreign
Minister Enrique Jorge Ros and then with Sir Anthony
Parsons, Britain's ambassador to the United Nations,
Perez de Cuellar said:
"A couple of days would be a reasonable time for
achieving some practical results, some concrete re
sults."
But Parsons, speaking to a British television in
terviewer yesterday, reported the negotiations stalled
by Argentina's continued insistence that future nego
tiations must lead "inexorably" to Argentine rule
over the Falklands.
"The breakneck speed over the weekend gave us
the feeling the climax would come today (Tuesday),"
Parsons said. "Now a few more days are probably
needed — possibly the end of the week — but there is
no target date."
The British ambassador strayed from routine when
he finished a one-hour meeting with the secretary
general yesterday afternoon and then stopped to see
Ambassador Ling Qing of China, current president of
the Security Council, before leaving the building.
As he emerged from the council chambers, he said
he had just given Ling an "extremely confidential
briefing" on the talks. The council has taken no
Falklands-related action since the passage of a resolu
tion April 3 asking the withdrawal of Argentine in
vasion troops from the disputed islands. Members of
the 15-nation council are following events closely.
House passes housing subsidy bill
Washington — Emergency legislation to pump $1
billion worth of mortgage subsidies into the de
pressed U.S. homebuilding industry was passed
349-55 yesterday by the House and sent to the Senate.
Rep. Les AuCoin (D-Ore.) said the bill could lead to
74,000 housing starts and 130,000 new jobs in the next
six months.
Sen. Richard Lugar (R-lnd.) who is one of 47 spon
sors of similar legislation in the Senate, applauded the
House action on the bill, which has drawn objections
from the Reagan administration because of its cost.
The House bill would provide qualified buyers of
houses and condominiums with subsidies that could
cut up to 4 percentage points off mortgage interest
rates — now typically at more than 16 percent.
To qualify, a person would have to have an income
below 130 percent of the local median income. Priori
ty would be given to first-time homebuyers. The pro
gram would require buyers to contribute at least 25
percent of their monthly incomes toward the mort
gage payment.
Sales of new single-family units fell in March to an
annual rate of 334,000, the lowest since the govern
ment began keeping the figures.
On budget matters, House GOP Leader Bob Michel
said Republicans will not introduce President Ronald
Reagan's revised spending plan for the fiscal year be
ginning Oct. 1 either in the Budget Committee or on
the floor of the House.
It "has never been our intention," to support the
plan as drafted, said Michel, even though White
House aides worked out the proposal with Senate Re
publicans last week.
Meanwhile, a resolution was introduced in the Sen
ate to remove Social Security from the unified na
tional budget.
If adopted, Congress could deal with the problem
of maintaining the system's solvency without"balanc
ing the budget on the backs of Social Security reci
pients," said Sen. John Heinz (R-Pa.), who introduced
the resolution.

Reagan asks banks for interest cuts
Washington — President Ronald Reagan is trying to
use his celebrated powers of persuasion to convince
business leaders who have backed him in the past that
they should rally behind his latest budget proposal
despite the difficulties it faces in Congress.
In the face of high interest rates, which Reagan ac
knowledges are slowing economic recovery, and
prominent GOP congressional defections from his
budget, the president is trying to convince busi
nessmen, especially the investment bankers with
whom he is to meet tomorrow, that they should lower
interest rates for political reasons even if they are un
willing to do so for economic ones.
'We recognize that bankers have many reasons to
feel that the current interest rates are justified and
why market forces, including the deficits, are terribly
important to them," a senior White House official said
yesterday. "But we think it's important to enlist their
support. If the bankers come out of the White House
on Thursday and say the president's budget should be
passed, that's a major step forward."
In recent weeks Reagan has praised the isolated ac
tions of Indiana and Illinois banks that acted on their
own to make loans available below the prevailing in
terest rates. So far he has been unable to persuade any
of the country's biggest banks to do the same.
OECD calls on U.S. to take lead
in world economic recovery
Paris — The 24-nation Organization for Economic
Cooperation and Development (OECD) agreed here
yesterday at the end of a high-level ministerial meet
ing that the main obstacles now to economic recovery
in the industrial world are high interest rates, budget
deficits and market rigidities.
But although agreeing on the problems, they made
no attempt to prescribe any common cure, declaring
that it was up to individual countries "to set their eco
nomic policies in accordance with the varying nature
and severity" of the problems they face. They did,
however, single out the United States for special com
ment:
"Ministers recognized the importance and results
of anti-inflationary policies in the United States be
cause of the key role of its economy and the dollar in
the world economy. Many felt that more action
should be taken now to reduce future budget deficits
considerably in order to ease the pressure on interest
rates and saving flows."
Secretary of the Treasury Donald Regan, who flew
from the Paris meeting yesterday to an International
Monetary Fund meeting in Helsinki, Finland, ex
pressed satisfaction with results, commenting, "I
think we came out of it very well — it is a good omen
for the Versailles summit next month."
Regan said that the American delegation went into
the annual OECD session expecting hard criticism on
interest-rates levels in particular, but he was pleased
with the consensus on broad policy problems that
finally emerged.

Reagan asks banks for interest cuts
Washington — President Ronald Reagan is trying to
use his celebrated powers of persuasion to convince
business leaders who have backed him in the past that
they should rally behind his latest budget proposal
despite the difficulties it faces in Congress.
In the face of high interest rates, which Reagan ac
knowledges are slowing economic recovery, and
prominent GOP congressional defections from his
budget, the president is trying to convince busi
nessmen, especially the investment bankers with
whom he is to meet tomorrow, that they should lower
interest rates for political reasons even if they are un
willing to do so for economic ones.
'We recognize that bankers have many reasons to
feel that the current interest rates are justified and
why market forces, including the deficits, are terribly
important to them," a senior White House official said
yesterday. "But we think it's important to enlist their
support. If the bankers come out of the White House
on Thursday and say the president's budget should be
passed, that's a major step forward."
In recent weeks Reagan has praised the isolated ac
tions of Indiana and Illinois banks that acted on their
own to make loans available below the prevailing in
terest rates. So far he has been unable to persuade any
of the country's biggest banks to do the same.
OECD calls on U.S. to take lead
in world economic recovery
Paris — The 24-nation Organization for Economic
Cooperation and Development (OECD) agreed here
yesterday at the end of a high-level ministerial meet
ing that the main obstacles now to economic recovery
in the industrial world are high interest rates, budget
deficits and market rigidities.
But although agreeing on the problems, they made
no attempt to prescribe any common cure, declaring
that it was up to individual countries "to set their eco
nomic policies in accordance with the varying nature
and severity" of the problems they face. They did,
however, single out the United States for special com
ment:
"Ministers recognized the importance and results
of anti-inflationary policies in the United States be
cause of the key role of its economy and the dollar in
the world economy. Many felt that more action
should be taken now to reduce future budget deficits
considerably in order to ease the pressure on interest
rates and saving flows."
Secretary of the Treasury Donald Regan, who flew
from the Paris meeting yesterday to an International
Monetary Fund meeting in Helsinki, Finland, ex
pressed satisfaction with results, commenting, "I
think we came out of it very well — it is a good omen
for the Versailles summit next month."
Regan said that the American delegation went into
the annual OECD session expecting hard criticism on
interest-rates levels in particular, but he was pleased
with the consensus on broad policy problems that
finally emerged.

British sink tanker, tighten grip on Falklands
London — A British warship opened fire on an Argentine supply
vessel, sinking it early yesterday in Falkland Sound, which divides the
two main islands of the Falkland archipelago, the British government
said here. There were no reports of survivors.
Reports from the flagship of the British task force, HMS Hermes, said
that the frigate Alacrity had entered the sound during the night on pa
trol and spotted an Argentine vessel in the widest part of the sound,
which ranges up to 30 miles in width.
The frigate opened fire with its 4.5-inch guns and hit the target, which
"exploded in a fireball," according to witnesses.
The flagship said that the British had so far spotted no survivors and
because of the explosion's intensity, there was little hope of finding any.
The staff of the naval task force aboard the Hermes said that the Ar
gentine vessel apparently was a tanker traveling from East Falkland to
West Falkland Island, bringing fuel to the Argentine garrison, which is
now cut off from the main base at Port Stanley, capital of the island.
The fact that the engagement took place inside Falkland Sound in
dicated that British warships were now moving at will, not only around
the Falkland Islands, but through the main channel between the two
islands.
"I think this shows how tight our grip is on the islands," said British
defense spokesman lan McDonald.
The action in the South Atlantic came as Prime Minister Margaret
Thatcher met in London with her inner "crisis Cabinet" to determine
how serious the Argentine junta is in the last-ditch negotiations being
conducted at the United Nations.
She also addressed Parliament yesterday concerning the nego
tiations, declaring: "There are certain fundamental principles which we
cannot fudge in any way."
For instance, any cease-fire in the Falklands "must be accompanied
by withdrawal by Argentines to a specific timetable," she said.
"We must also make sure Argentina does not enter into negotiations
in the belief that by the end of them, sovereignty is ceded to them," she
added.
U.N. head demands peace soon
United Nations — Secretary General Javier Perez de
Cuellar, in the fourth day of his drive for peace in the
South Atlantic, pressed Argentine and British nego
tiators yesterday to reach a peace agreement within a
"couple of days."
Arriving at his office to begin another series of sep
arate interviews, first with Argentina's deputy Foreign
Minister Enrique Jorge Ros and then with Sir Anthony
Parsons, Britain's ambassador to the United Nations,
Perez de Cuellar said:
"A couple of days would be a reasonable time for
achieving some practical results, some concrete re
sults."
But Parsons, speaking to a British television in
terviewer yesterday, reported the negotiations stalled
by Argentina's continued insistence that future nego
tiations must lead "inexorably" to Argentine rule
over the Falklands.
"The breakneck speed over the weekend gave us
the feeling the climax would come today (Tuesday),"
Parsons said. "Now a few more days are probably
needed — possibly the end of the week — but there is
no target date."
The British ambassador strayed from routine when
he finished a one-hour meeting with the secretary
general yesterday afternoon and then stopped to see
Ambassador Ling Qing of China, current president of
the Security Council, before leaving the building.
As he emerged from the council chambers, he said
he had just given Ling an "extremely confidential
briefing" on the talks. The council has taken no
Falklands-related action since the passage of a resolu
tion April 3 asking the withdrawal of Argentine in
vasion troops from the disputed islands. Members of
the 15-nation council are following events closely.
House passes housing subsidy bill
Washington — Emergency legislation to pump $1
billion worth of mortgage subsidies into the de
pressed U.S. homebuilding industry was passed
349-55 yesterday by the House and sent to the Senate.
Rep. Les AuCoin (D-Ore.) said the bill could lead to
74,000 housing starts and 130,000 new jobs in the next
six months.
Sen. Richard Lugar (R-lnd.) who is one of 47 spon
sors of similar legislation in the Senate, applauded the
House action on the bill, which has drawn objections
from the Reagan administration because of its cost.
The House bill would provide qualified buyers of
houses and condominiums with subsidies that could
cut up to 4 percentage points off mortgage interest
rates — now typically at more than 16 percent.
To qualify, a person would have to have an income
below 130 percent of the local median income. Priori
ty would be given to first-time homebuyers. The pro
gram would require buyers to contribute at least 25
percent of their monthly incomes toward the mort
gage payment.
Sales of new single-family units fell in March to an
annual rate of 334,000, the lowest since the govern
ment began keeping the figures.
On budget matters, House GOP Leader Bob Michel
said Republicans will not introduce President Ronald
Reagan's revised spending plan for the fiscal year be
ginning Oct. 1 either in the Budget Committee or on
the floor of the House.
It "has never been our intention," to support the
plan as drafted, said Michel, even though White
House aides worked out the proposal with Senate Re
publicans last week.

Thatcher met in London with her inner "crisis Cabinet" to determine
how serious the Argentine junta is in the last-ditch negotiations being
conducted at the United Nations.
She also addressed Parliament yesterday concerning the nego
tiations, declaring: "There are certain fundamental principles which we
cannot fudge in any way."
For instance, any cease-fire in the Falklands "must be accompanied
by withdrawal by Argentines to a specific timetable," she said.
"We must also make sure Argentina does not enter into negotiations
in the belief that by the end of them, sovereignty is ceded to them," she
added.
U.N. head demands peace soon
United Nations — Secretary General Javier Perez de
Cuellar, in the fourth day of his drive for peace in the
South Atlantic, pressed Argentine and British nego
tiators yesterday to reach a peace agreement within a
"couple of days."
Arriving at his office to begin another series of sep
arate interviews, first with Argentina's deputy Foreign
Minister Enrique Jorge Ros and then with Sir Anthony
Parsons, Britain's ambassador to the United Nations,
Perez de Cuellar said:
"A couple of days would be a reasonable time for
achieving some practical results, some concrete re
sults."
But Parsons, speaking to a British television in
terviewer yesterday, reported the negotiations stalled
by Argentina's continued insistence that future nego
tiations must lead "inexorably" to Argentine rule
over the Falklands.
"The breakneck speed over the weekend gave us
the feeling the climax would come today (Tuesday),"
Parsons said. "Now a few more days are probably
needed — possibly the end of the week — but there is
no target date."
The British ambassador strayed from routine when
he finished a one-hour meeting with the secretary
general yesterday afternoon and then stopped to see
Ambassador Ling Qing of China, current president of
the Security Council, before leaving the building.
As he emerged from the council chambers, he said
he had just given Ling an "extremely confidential
briefing" on the talks. The council has taken no
Falklands-related action since the passage of a resolu
tion April 3 asking the withdrawal of Argentine in
vasion troops from the disputed islands. Members of
the 15-nation council are following events closely.
House passes housing subsidy bill
Washington — Emergency legislation to pump $1
billion worth of mortgage subsidies into the de
pressed U.S. homebuilding industry was passed
349-55 yesterday by the House and sent to the Senate.
Rep. Les AuCoin (D-Ore.) said the bill could lead to
74,000 housing starts and 130,000 new jobs in the next
six months.
Sen. Richard Lugar (R-lnd.) who is one of 47 spon
sors of similar legislation in the Senate, applauded the
House action on the bill, which has drawn objections
from the Reagan administration because of its cost.
The House bill would provide qualified buyers of
houses and condominiums with subsidies that could
cut up to 4 percentage points off mortgage interest
rates — now typically at more than 16 percent.
To qualify, a person would have to have an income
below 130 percent of the local median income. Priori
ty would be given to first-time homebuyers. The pro
gram would require buyers to contribute at least 25
percent of their monthly incomes toward the mort
gage payment.
Sales of new single-family units fell in March to an
annual rate of 334,000, the lowest since the govern
ment began keeping the figures.
On budget matters, House GOP Leader Bob Michel
said Republicans will not introduce President Ronald
Reagan's revised spending plan for the fiscal year be
ginning Oct. 1 either in the Budget Committee or on
the floor of the House.
It "has never been our intention," to support the
plan as drafted, said Michel, even though White
House aides worked out the proposal with Senate Re
publicans last week.
Meanwhile, a resolution was introduced in the Sen
ate to remove Social Security from the unified na
tional budget.
If adopted, Congress could deal with the problem
of maintaining the system's solvency without"balanc
ing the budget on the backs of Social Security reci
pients," said Sen. John Heinz (R-Pa.), who introduced
the resolution.

Reagan asks banks for interest cuts
Washington — President Ronald Reagan is trying to
use his celebrated powers of persuasion to convince
business leaders who have backed him in the past that
they should rally behind his latest budget proposal
despite the difficulties it faces in Congress.
In the face of high interest rates, which Reagan ac
knowledges are slowing economic recovery, and
prominent GOP congressional defections from his
budget, the president is trying to convince busi
nessmen, especially the investment bankers with
whom he is to meet tomorrow, that they should lower
interest rates for political reasons even if they are un
willing to do so for economic ones.
'We recognize that bankers have many reasons to
feel that the current interest rates are justified and
why market forces, including the deficits, are terribly
important to them," a senior White House official said
yesterday. "But we think it's important to enlist their
support. If the bankers come out of the White House
on Thursday and say the president's budget should be
passed, that's a major step forward."
In recent weeks Reagan has praised the isolated ac
tions of Indiana and Illinois banks that acted on their
own to make loans available below the prevailing in
terest rates. So far he has been unable to persuade any
of the country's biggest banks to do the same.
OECD calls on U.S. to take lead
in world economic recovery
Paris — The 24-nation Organization for Economic
Cooperation and Development (OECD) agreed here
yesterday at the end of a high-level ministerial meet
ing that the main obstacles now to economic recovery
in the industrial world are high interest rates, budget
deficits and market rigidities.
But although agreeing on the problems, they made
no attempt to prescribe any common cure, declaring
that it was up to individual countries "to set their eco
nomic policies in accordance with the varying nature
and severity" of the problems they face. They did,
however, single out the United States for special com
ment:
"Ministers recognized the importance and results
of anti-inflationary policies in the United States be
cause of the key role of its economy and the dollar in
the world economy. Many felt that more action
should be taken now to reduce future budget deficits
considerably in order to ease the pressure on interest
rates and saving flows."
Secretary of the Treasury Donald Regan, who flew
from the Paris meeting yesterday to an International
Monetary Fund meeting in Helsinki, Finland, ex
pressed satisfaction with results, commenting, "I
think we came out of it very well — it is a good omen
for the Versailles summit next month."
Regan said that the American delegation went into
the annual OECD session expecting hard criticism on
interest-rates levels in particular, but he was pleased
with the consensus on broad policy problems that
finally emerged.
