British sink tanker, tighten grip on Falklands
London â€” A British warship opened fire on an Argentine supply
vessel, sinking it early yesterday in Falkland Sound, which divides the
two main islands of the Falkland archipelago, the British government
said here. There were no reports of survivors.
Reports from the flagship of the British task force, HMS Hermes, said
that the frigate Alacrity had entered the sound during the night on pa
trol and spotted an Argentine vessel in the widest part of the sound,
which ranges up to 30 miles in width.
The frigate opened fire with its 4.5-inch guns and hit the target, which
"exploded in a fireball," according to witnesses.
The flagship said that the British had so far spotted no survivors and
because of the explosion's intensity, there was little hope of finding any.
The staff of the naval task force aboard the Hermes said that the Ar
gentine vessel apparently was a tanker traveling from East Falkland to
West Falkland Island, bringing fuel to the Argentine garrison, which is
now cut off from the main base at Port Stanley, capital of the island.
The fact that the engagement took place inside Falkland Sound in
dicated that British warships were now moving at will, not only around
the Falkland Islands, but through the main channel between the two
islands.
"I think this shows how tight our grip is on the islands," said British
defense spokesman lan McDonald.
The action in the South Atlantic came as Prime Minister Margaret
Thatcher met in London with her inner "crisis Cabinet" to determine
how serious the Argentine junta is in the last-ditch negotiations being
conducted at the United Nations.
She also addressed Parliament yesterday concerning the nego
tiations, declaring: "There are certain fundamental principles which we
cannot fudge in any way."
For instance, any cease-fire in the Falklands "must be accompanied
by withdrawal by Argentines to a specific timetable," she said.
"We must also make sure Argentina does not enter into negotiations
in the belief that by the end of them, sovereignty is ceded to them," she
added.
