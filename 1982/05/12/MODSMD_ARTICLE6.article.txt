# Campus spraying over; Medfly project ending

University residents will see no
more' malathion-bearing heli
copters, and if all goes according
to plan, efforts to eradicate the
Mediterranean fruit fly — includ
ing aerial malathion spraying —
may cease by the end of June, ac
cording to officials.
A four-square-mile parcel near
Woodside is the area closest to the
University that is still in the
spraying zone.
Roger Blake, a Medfly Eradica
tion Project information officer,
said that the June target date is
"the most optimistic outlook on it.
A more practical outlook is that
we will find a couple of flies... (in
which case) we should be done
spraying by the end of July and be
able to declare eradication by the
end of September," he said.
If more flies are found, Blake
said, "we wili plot out a 1.5 mile ra
dius and spray for two lifecycles."
The medfly lifecycle is about 30
days in the summer and 45 days in
the winter, he said.
Blake said he did not expect a
great comeback by the insect dur
ing the summer and said that areas
now being sprayed are being

"phased out piecemeal."
The last fertile fly to be captured
in California was found in the city
of San Mateo on November 20,
1981.
In july 1981, malathion spraying
reached a peak in California: 1400
square miles were sprayed during
that month. Today, just under 200
are being treated, according to
Gina Kaklikian, a supervisor at the
Medfly Information Center.
Although the total area being
sprayed is lessening, the frequen
cy of the spraying is increasing,
said Kaklikian. "In the winter we
were spraying about once every
three weeks, now we're back to
the summer schedule, which is
once a week/' she said.
About 8000 claims have been
filed against the state in associa
tion with the spraying, and three
fourths of those have concerned
car or other property damage, ac
cording to Kaklikian.
In addition, Blake said that 25
health-related suits have been
filed. He called this figure im
pressive, saying "We probably
sprayed 2.5 million people. To
have only 25 suits, whether they
