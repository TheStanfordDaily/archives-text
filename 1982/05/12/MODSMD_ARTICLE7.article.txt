# No gun control attributed to machismo
## 
### Jeff Biddulph 
The main reason that the United
States does not have handgun con
trol is that men treat a gun as a phallic
symbol, John Buckley, former sheriff
of Middlesex County in Massachu
setts, told a small audience at Annen
burg Auditorium last night.
"This is the argument that you
don't hear about, but it's responsible
for slowing gun control legislation,"
said the self-described liberal law en
forcement officer.
Pointing out that 93 percent of the
members of the National Rifle As
sociation, an anti-gun control lobby,
are men, Buckley blamed "the Unit
ed States' machismo, John Wayne
image" for the nation's dearth of gun
control laws. Buckley said that in
Great Britain, a country with strict
handgun bans, there were eight
deaths inl979by handguns. The Unit
ed States had 10,790, he said.
"In some cultures you conquer a
woman to be macho," he said. "In
this country you buy a gun. It's what
gives men power."
However, Buckley, on his way to
San Francisco to lobby for newly-in
troduced gun control legislation,
told the audience that the tide was
turning and that gun control move
ments are popping up throughout
the nation.

Buckley, who has taught courses at
both Harvard and Yale Universities,
devoted the majority of his 40-
minute speech and following ques
tion-and-answer session to gun con
trol questions. He also spoke in favor
of the legalization of marijuana and
the return of a rehabilitative criminal
system.
Buckley drew on his 11-year ex
perience as a sheriff in Massachusetts
tosupportmanyof hisarguments. He
introduced a raft of statistics about
handgun deaths in the United States:
•51 percent of all murders in the
United States are caused by hand
guns.
•The amount of handgun deaths in
the country has risen to the point
where 2000 people were killed by
handguns in California in 1970. In
1979 that many were killed in Los An
geles County alone.
•People who know each other are
responsible for 65 percent of all
handgun deaths.
Buckley claimed that the cure to
this problem was prevention of the
proliferation of handguns — not
stricter sentences for handgun users.
He pointed to recent handgun sale
freezes in Chicago and Washington,
D.C., as well as the total ban of hand
guns in Morton Grove, Illinois as
steps towards prevention.
