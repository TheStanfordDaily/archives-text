# ODUS's responsibilities to be dispersed
## 
### Heather Millar Senior staff writer 
The responsibilities now invested
in the Dean of Undergraduate Stud
ies will be dispersed to two new ad
ministrators in an effort to ease the
tension between conflicting man
agerial and advocacy demands on
the Office of the Dean of Under
graduate Studies (ODUS), the Daily
has learned.
An ad-hoc committee made up of
a group of top University officials
who have been reviewing ODUS for
almost four months — largely behind
closed doors — will release a report
proposing this dispersal to the Facul
ty Senate this afternoon.
The proposals "have been unani
mously agreed upon by the members
of the committee and accepted by
the provost. They will be im

plemented at the start of academic
year 1982-83," a copy of the report
states.
The changes recommended in the
committee's report represent a
change in a policy of centralization
established 12 years ago. University
administrators founded ODUS more
than a decade ago to remedy "di
sheveled" arrangements and provide
"what (Stanford) has never had: a
steady focus on its education of un
dergraduates." At the time, Univer
sity leaders judged this focus was best
achieved by "one committee and
one dean."
The members of the ad-hoc com
mittee include Provost Al Hastorf,
current Dean of Undergraduate
Studies Herant Katchadourian, Dean
of Graduate Studies and Research
Gerald Lieberman, Dean of Human

ities and Sciences Norman Wessels,
Dean of the School of Earth Sciences
Allan Cox, Dean of the School of En
gineering William Kavs, French and
Italian professor Ralpn Hester, phys
ics profesor Alexander (Sandy) Fetter
and students Dave Phelps and Stan
Young.
Although all the members of the
committee were either unavailable
or unwilling to comment on the pro
posal until it is presented to the Fac
ulty Senate later today, authors of the
report take an administrative stance
oppposite the former policy. "The
notion of 'one dean'... remains very
attractive in the abstract," said the re
port. "But we find it flawed when
looked at in the more concrete reali
ty of experience. The tasks of the
(ODUS) are so many and so diverse as
to be internally inconsistent."
The committee's recommenda

tions divide these responsibilities be
tween a new associate dean for un
dergraduate programs and a new
vice-provost for undergraduate
education. Beginning next fall,
ODUS as it now operates will cease to
exist.
The report cautioned however, "It
would be a serious error to character
ize this step as 'dismantling' of ODUS
or eliminating its functions. What we
propose is not a process of elimina
tion, but one of restructuring and re
newal."
This shuffling of administrative re
sponsibilities will involve the shift of
a considerable burden to the School
of Humanities and Sciences (H & S)
which enrolls the largest number of
undergraduates. The new associate
dean Tor undergraduate programs
will work out of H & Sand be active
in that school. But the associate dean

will also be expected to manage sev
eral extra-departmental programs
such as SCIRE, SWOPSI and Individ
ually Designed Majors.
The committee's recommenda
tions accord the role of advocate for
undergraduate education to the new
vice-provost who will frequent the
conference rooms where University
wide policy is determined.
Various academic services may also
be combined, pending an upcoming
review of these programs. The report
suggests a possible merger between
the Learning Assistance Center and
the Teaching and Learning Center
and also between the Action Re
search Liasion Office and internship
programs. However, the report said
operational details have been kept
"deliberately tentative," as adjust
ments will undoubtedly have to be
made as the committee's proposals
are implemented.
