# German economy splits gov't

### Deutsche Presse-Agentur 
Hamburg, West Germany â€” A fundamental
dispute on the future course of West Germany's
economic policy has flared up, a dispute that
may even threaten the coalition government.
Politicians, economists, and other experts
propose differing solutions to the structural and
economic crisis in the West German economy so
that unemployment can be reduced and further
government deficits avoided.
The conservatives and liberals advocate a mix
ed economy with the least possible intervention
by the state, which they feel is best suited to
bring about an economic upswing. They are
against increased taxes and a mammoth govern
ment program aimed at beefing uO the econo
my. They want an end to subsidies, a reduction
in present large public spending for social and
political projects and would like to let com
petitive market forces develop freely.
In contrast, the Social Democrats of Chan

cellor Helmut Schmidt and the socialists ad
vocate a policy of planning and boosting the en
tire economic process to solve the crisis. They
advocate increased taxes, spending and addi
tional government borrowing. They feel the
state must obtain additional financial means in
order to fuel the economy, create jobs and re
duce unemployment, with no attacks on the
present network of social subsidies.
Schmidt is an opponent of "neoconservative"
economic policies, but a convinced advocate of
a mixed economy. But he has been subject to
strong Social Democratic Party pressures to im
plement recent party decisions to raise taxes to
finance job-creating programs and demands for
more government intervention in the economy.
Vice Chancellor Hans-Dietrich Genscher and
his Free Democrats are opposed to this policy.
This split has led to press reports that the 13-
year-old government coalition could come
apart this summer.
