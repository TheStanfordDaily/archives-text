## Heart-lung transplant expert appointed chief of Johns Hopkins cardiac division 
### Christie Wood 
It is not surprising that an outstanding
cardiovascular surgeon from a leading uni
versity medical center should be chosen to
replace the chief of cardiac surgery at the
Johns Hopkins School of Medicine. It is re
markable, however, that he is only 37.
Dr. Bruce Reitz, currently an associate
professor of cardiovascular surgery at the
Stanford Medical Center, has been ap
pointed professor and director of the
division of cardiac surgery at Johns
Hopkins effective June 1. Reitz has headed
Stanford's recent heart-lung transplant ef
forts.
Reitz admitted that his appointment to
the prestigious position at such a young
age is "highly unusual." But, he added, it is
also somewhat typical for Johns Hopkins.
The Johns Hopkins search team unani
mously recommended Reitz to replace Dr.
Vincent Gott, who has headed the cardiac
surgery division there since it was estab
lished as a separate division in 1965. Gott
has asked to be relieved of his adminis
trative duties but will continue his surgery
and clinical research, university officials
there announced.
According to Reitz, the cardiac surgery
division at Johns Hopkins is slightly smaller
than Stanford's â€” five regular faculty
members compared with Stanford's seven.
In addition, though, there have been a
great many kidney and bone marrow
transplants performed, there have never
been heart transplants at Johns Hopkins.

Cardiovascular transplantation is a spe
cial interest of Reitz's. "It will take a good
six months to institute the new program
there," he said.
Reitz's other clinical specialties include
general cardiothoracic surgery and
pediatric cardiac surgery.
"There is already a department for
pediatric cardiac surgery at Hopkins,"
Reitz said. "Twenty years ago they were
the best in the country. We hope to
strengthen that department once again."
Dr. Norman Shumway, Frances and
Charles Field professor of cardiovascular
surgery and chairman of the department
of cardiovascular surgery at Stanford, said
in a statement, "Johns Hopkins is gaining a
fine surgeon and an excellent academ
ician. We will miss Dr. Reitz, but it is grat
ifying for us to see such worthy faculty
members being given an opportunity to
take charge of cardiovascular surgery de
partments at institutions elsewhere."
"The heart-lung transplant program will
continue at Stanford under the direction
of other faculty members," Shumway ex
plained.
Other Stanford-trained faculty mem
bers have gone on to direct at six
cardiovascular surgery programs at major
medical institutions throughout the nation
and overseas. Reitz expressed his gratitude
to the Stanford program, "I've been very
fortunate to have been at Stanford be
cause of the atmosphere in this depart
ment. There is a lot of research going on. I
want to assume a position like Dr.

Shumway,sothat I can helpothersalongas
he has helped me."
Reitz was appointed assistant professor
of cardiovascular surgery at Stanford in
1978. A native of Seattle, he received his
undergraduate degree in physiology from
Stanford in 1966. As a freshman, Reitz took
a biology course taught by the University's
current president, Donald Kennedy.
Reitz received his M.D. degree at Yale in
1970. He then served a year as an intern at
Johns Hopkins and two years at the Na
tional Institutes of Health in Bethesda,
Maryland. Reitz returned to Stanford in
1974, where he served a four-year residen
cy, including a tour as chief resident in the
cardiovascular surgery program.
"Cardiovascular surgery really only
began 25 years ago, it is a relatively young
field," Reitz noted. "And it has only been
in the last 10 years that there has been ma
jor improvement in techniques. But we
have just begun to solve the problems. The
aim of the next 25 years is to simplify our
procedures; make them more reliable,
and easier for the patients."
Reitz will be joined at Johns Hopkins by
Dr. William Bumgartner, 34, who will be
come an assistant professor of cardiac
surgery. Bumgartner, a graduate of the
University of Kentucky Medical School, is
currently a clinical assistant professor of
cardiovascular surgery at Stanford. He
served as chief resident in cardiovascular
surgery here in 1977-78 and chief resident
in general surgery in 1980-81.
