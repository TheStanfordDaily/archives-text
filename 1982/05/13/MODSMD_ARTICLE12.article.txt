Three Stanford seniors have received
awards for study overseas for the years
1982-83. Susan Woolley is the recipient of the
International Telephone and Telegraph Cor
poration (ITT) International Fellowship for
anthropological study in Spain at the Univer
sidad de Seville, and Barbara Ann Markel has
received the first Haas-Koshland Award for
study in Israel in the field of international re
lations. The Church Scholarship for graduate
work in mathematics has been awarded to
Thomas Callister Hales. He has declined it
and instead has accepted a three year schol
arship from the National Science Founda
tion.
Susan Woolley, of Palos Verdes Estates,
California, applied for the ITT grant through
the Fulbright Foundation. She is one of 25
students from the United States to receive
the ITT award this year. She found out about
the grant through her advisers, George and
Jane Collier of the Anthropology Depart
ment, when they asked her to accompany
them as a field assistant to Spain last year.

"It is an extremely competitive fellow
ship," said Woolley who wrote up the ap
plication five days before the deadline. She
felt she won the award because her proposal
of study was clear and because she had a
feasible research design. In addition to the
application and the sending of recommen
dations and transcripts, there was also an in
terview with three members of the Stanford
faculty. Questions asked in the interview
dealt with how she would handle situations
in a country like Spain that hasan anti-Amer
ican sentiment, she said.
Woolley, who is an Resident Assistant (RA)
at Faisan, was thrilled to hear that she had re
cieved the award. "I completely convinced
myself I was not going to get it and that I did
not want to go, but I did want to go to Spain."
Her friends were relieved and happy to hear
about it. "They had more confidence in me
than I had in myself."
She will do research in a village in the prov
ince of Welva. There she plans to study the
changes in womens' roles reflected in the
mass media. The basis for her studies is "to

examine things relating to my life." She said
an overseas experience will help her to see
how other people look at the United States.
Woolley said she became interested in stu
dying overseas when she took Anthropology
1. "It gave me a broader view of the world,"
she said, "and that there are different ways to
look at the world and to live. Seeing how
people deal with the same problems in a dif
ferent way makes you question yourself and
why you're doing what you're doing. It's a
classic comeback to yourself."
In her opinion it is for a worthwhile stu
dent to study overseas. "Going overseas you
learn to see all sides of a different issue." She
said she feels this is what she gained from her
first two quarters of her junior year studying
overseas at the Stanford campus in Salaman
ca. The following quarter she stopped out
and travelled through Italy, France and Ger
many. Woolley said she believes that getting
a break from the United States and its institu
tions is essential to the college experience.
Holding the same opinion is Barbara Ann
Markel of Pittsburgh, Pennsyvlania. She em

phasized the importance of takingadvantage
of the opportunity to work and travel at the
same time. This is the reason she applied for
the Haas-Koshland Award which providesall
expenses paid for one year of work, study
and travel.
This summer she plans to take an intensive
10 week Hebrew program in Haifa Univer
sity. Her plans after that are not definite.
There is a possibility of working in Tel Aviv
with Shai Feldman, a Stanford research fel
low whose specialty is Israeli nuclear issues.
"This is exciting to me because of my in
volvement with the Stanford Arms Control
and Disarmament Forum," said.
Markel stated that it was important for her
to take "two years off after college to see
where my studies were going to take me."
"I would like to see more people take time
off. You learn about others and about your
self. It is crucial to remove yourself from the
place that you are most familiar," she said.
Markel's interest in political science and
international relations began in the eighth
grade when she read Advise and Consent for

a history class. While in high school, involve
ment in community work and local politics
in Boston were very important to her, she
said.
When she came here she found that col
lege was a time for "experimenting." This
led to the decision to take four quarters off
after sophomore year Winter Quarter. Dur
ing this time she worked and studied on tall
ships with the Ocean Research and Educa
tion Society in Boston.
"I had never seen a whale before, so I de
cided that it was time I did." Seeing grey
whales off the coast of Baja and travelling
throughout Europe are experiences that
cover a diverse amount of exploration and
studies. "It's essential to fake advantage of
learning you don't get at school."
As Susan Woolley explained, "Students
are insular. There's this push to go straight
into the professions after graduation. It's im
portant to be on your own and do something
about what you want to do. It's important to
see what I'm like as a person outside of Stan
ford."

California, applied for the ITT grant through
the Fulbright Foundation. She is one of 25
students from the United States to receive
the ITT award this year. She found out about
the grant through her advisers, George and
Jane Collier of the Anthropology Depart
ment, when they asked her to accompany
them as a field assistant to Spain last year.

"It is an extremely competitive fellow
ship," said Woolley who wrote up the ap
plication five days before the deadline. She
felt she won the award because her proposal
of study was clear and because she had a
feasible research design. In addition to the
application and the sending of recommen
dations and transcripts, there was also an in
terview with three members of the Stanford
faculty. Questions asked in the interview
dealt with how she would handle situations
in a country like Spain that hasan anti-Amer
ican sentiment, she said.
Woolley, who is an Resident Assistant (RA)
at Faisan, was thrilled to hear that she had re
cieved the award. "I completely convinced
myself I was not going to get it and that I did
not want to go, but I did want to go to Spain."
Her friends were relieved and happy to hear
about it. "They had more confidence in me
than I had in myself."
She will do research in a village in the prov
ince of Welva. There she plans to study the
changes in womens' roles reflected in the
mass media. The basis for her studies is "to

examine things relating to my life." She said
an overseas experience will help her to see
how other people look at the United States.
Woolley said she became interested in stu
dying overseas when she took Anthropology
1. "It gave me a broader view of the world,"
she said, "and that there are different ways to
look at the world and to live. Seeing how
people deal with the same problems in a dif
ferent way makes you question yourself and
why you're doing what you're doing. It's a
classic comeback to yourself."
In her opinion it is for a worthwhile stu
dent to study overseas. "Going overseas you
learn to see all sides of a different issue." She
said she feels this is what she gained from her
first two quarters of her junior year studying
overseas at the Stanford campus in Salaman
ca. The following quarter she stopped out
and travelled through Italy, France and Ger
many. Woolley said she believes that getting
a break from the United States and its institu
tions is essential to the college experience.
Holding the same opinion is Barbara Ann
Markel of Pittsburgh, Pennsyvlania. She em

phasized the importance of takingadvantage
of the opportunity to work and travel at the
same time. This is the reason she applied for
the Haas-Koshland Award which providesall
expenses paid for one year of work, study
and travel.
This summer she plans to take an intensive
10 week Hebrew program in Haifa Univer
sity. Her plans after that are not definite.
There is a possibility of working in Tel Aviv
with Shai Feldman, a Stanford research fel
low whose specialty is Israeli nuclear issues.
"This is exciting to me because of my in
volvement with the Stanford Arms Control
and Disarmament Forum," said.
Markel stated that it was important for her
to take "two years off after college to see
where my studies were going to take me."
"I would like to see more people take time
off. You learn about others and about your
self. It is crucial to remove yourself from the
place that you are most familiar," she said.
Markel's interest in political science and
international relations began in the eighth
grade when she read Advise and Consent for

a history class. While in high school, involve
ment in community work and local politics
in Boston were very important to her, she
said.
When she came here she found that col
lege was a time for "experimenting." This
led to the decision to take four quarters off
after sophomore year Winter Quarter. Dur
ing this time she worked and studied on tall
ships with the Ocean Research and Educa
tion Society in Boston.
"I had never seen a whale before, so I de
cided that it was time I did." Seeing grey
whales off the coast of Baja and travelling
throughout Europe are experiences that
cover a diverse amount of exploration and
studies. "It's essential to fake advantage of
learning you don't get at school."
As Susan Woolley explained, "Students
are insular. There's this push to go straight
into the professions after graduation. It's im
portant to be on your own and do something
about what you want to do. It's important to
see what I'm like as a person outside of Stan
ford."
Three Stanford seniors have received
awards for study overseas for the years
1982-83. Susan Woolley is the recipient of the
International Telephone and Telegraph Cor
poration (ITT) International Fellowship for
anthropological study in Spain at the Univer
sidad de Seville, and Barbara Ann Markel has
received the first Haas-Koshland Award for
study in Israel in the field of international re
lations. The Church Scholarship for graduate
work in mathematics has been awarded to
Thomas Callister Hales. He has declined it
and instead has accepted a three year schol
arship from the National Science Founda
tion.
