## Viewpoint/Sidney Hook Verifying a nuclear freeze 
### 
No one can be serious about a nu
clear freeze who is not serious about
the problems of verification. No one
can be seriously concerned about
verification without considering the
difficulties posed by the absence of a
free culture whose citizens can
monitor agreements their govern
ments enter into. From this point of
view the response of Joe Walder
(May 4) to my article on this issue is
not serious. His denial that there is no
difference between the likelihood of
violations of agreements in the open
society of the United States and the
closed society of the U.S.S.R. is based
on dogmatism and historical ig
norance.
Consider the failure of the Soviet
Union to comply with the agree
mentsof the Helsinki Final Act. Atthe
present time all the members of the
Helsinki Watch Group in the U.S.S.R.
are in jails or concentration camps,
including Yuri Orlov. Their sole of
fense, declared a crime, was merely
their readiness to monitor violations
of the agreement. There is an organic
connection between the presence or
absence of human rights in countries
that are signatories to pacts and the
degree of reliance one can place on
their compliance. As Andrei
Sakharov has declared "a worldwide
defense of human rights is a neces
sary foundation for international
trust and security; it is a factor which
can deter destructive military con
flicts, even global thermonuclear
conflicts, which threaten the very ex
istence of humanity."
Walder dismisses, when he cannot
distort, the historical record. The
Moratorium Ban of 1958 on the tes
ting of weapons in the atmosphere
collapsed when the Soviet Union ex
ploded a fifty megaton bomb in the
Spring of 1961, technical prepara
tions for which required an intent to
evade the moratorium.
Walder even denies that the
Baruch-Lilienthal Plan, endorsed by
the American scientific community
active in the cause of peace, was a
proposal to surrender the U.S.
monopoly of atomic bombs to an in
ternational authority! This plan was
so generous and reasonable that
Bertrand Russell urged, unwisely,
that the Soviet Union be atom
bombed if it refused to accept it. It is
false to say, as Walder does, that the
plan "left nuclear weapons in Ameri
can hands alone." (Thermonuclear
weapons had not been discovered
then). It was its monopoly of the
plan; of course, the United States re
tained the weapons. What the United
States was proposing was a concrete
piece of international socialism, ac

cepted by all the nations of the world
except the Soviet Union.
I contend that mutual on-site in
spection is the most effective means
of verification, an on-site inspection
the Kremlin has steadfastly refused to
accept. Walder's discovery that the
Soviet Union has suddenly com
mitted itself to on-site inspection on
the basis of a wild assertion by a re
tired American navy officer on White
Plaza on April 20 is a distressing ex
hibition of political infantilism. Noth
ing so clearly indicates his anti-Amer
ican animus as his remarks on his sub
ject.
Walder is also very cavalier about
the evidence that the Soviet Union
and its proxies are violating the 1972
Geneva Convention on thi prohibi
tion of use of biological weapons. It is
not true that allegations about the
use of Yellow Rain have come only
from Afghan refugees. They have
come from South East Asia and also
Eritrea where Soviet proxy troops are
in combat. But why does Walder dis
miss the reports of Afghan refugees
out of hand? I am prepared to listen
refugees from El Salvador, Nicaragua,
Poland and Viet Nam wherever hu
man rights are being trampled.
Walder invents facts as he goes along.
It is false that the American media
have failed to report charges of El
Salvador government excesses
against El Salvador refugees. Actual
ly, it has been widely charged that the
media have failed to report the ex
cess of guerilla terrorists.
My evidence concerning the use
of Yellow Rain is derived from the
testimony of Dr. Richard Harruff
before the Sub-committee on Asian
and Pacific Affairs of the House For
eign Affairs Committee on March 30,
1982, based primarily on his ex
periences in the Ban Vanai Camp of
Northeastern Thailand. It is signficant
that Walder remains silent about the
refusal of the Soviet Union to report
on the 1979 massive anthrax outbreak
in Sverdlovsk (allegedly a conse
quence of the secret and illegal man
ufacture of biological warfare agents)
to the 1980 review Conference of the
Convention. This refusal constituted
another violation of the Convention.
Despite Walder's insinuations I
have been a critic of many features of
American foreign policy but I find
preposterous and politically illiterate
his equation of the American press,
with all its faults, with the controlled
Soviet press, as well as with other in
stitutions bearing on public opinion.
(If there are Soviet Chomskys alive,
they are in jail or concentration
camps, not enjoying directly or in
directly, government grants.)

Walder's points of view reminds
me of the famous, probably
apocryphal, exchange between Sec
retary Marshall and Vice-Chairman
Molotov about the relative state of
freedom in the United States and
U.S.S.R. "In my country," said
Marshall, "any citizen can come to
Washington and tell Truman to his
face that he strongly disagrees with
his foreign policy."
"What is so wonderful about
that?" retorted Molotov, "In my
country, any citizen can come to
Moscow and tell Comrade Stalin to
his face that he, too, strongly dis
agrees with Truman's foreign poli
cy."
