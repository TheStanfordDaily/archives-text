# Mem-Jungle-Gym: the 'real'story
## 
### 
It's a bird. It's a plane. It's a jungle gym. Nope. It's a
"work of art," and its yours, Stanford.
I'm refeslrs, of course, to the huge whatchamacallit
that planted itself on the lawn behind Meyer Library
Monday. There are conflicting reports as to what the
thing is and how it got there. As a fair and honest re
porter with virtually no integrity, I feel that it's my duty to
give you both sides of the story.
First, there's the official university report. University
officials claim that the massive structure, consisting of 18
stainless steel pipes joined by yards of cable, is the work
of artist Kenneth Snelson. They say that Snelson, a native
of New York, calls his masterpiece "Mozart I." Accord
ing to the officials, two Stanford alumni purchased
"Mozart I" from Snelson for approximately $15,000 and
donated it to the University.
That whole story sounds a little farfetched to me. Why
would Snelson call his sculpture "Mozart I?" I mean, it
doesn't look anything like Mozart. He wasn't that tall. Of
course, maybe the thing isn't finished yet. Maybe
Snelson is going to strap a huge piano to "Mozart I." I
don't know.
More importantly, who is Snelson? I've never heard of
him. Are we supposed to believe that two rich alumns
simply decided one day to buy a $150,000 jungle gym
from some guy whose last name sounds like a brand of
fertilizer?
"Hey Bob, what are we going to do with that $150,000
that we wanted to give to Stanford?"
"Why don't we donate a work of art?"
"Okay." What'll it be? A Rembrandt? A Monet ? A Re
noir?"
"How about a Snelson?"
"Snelson? You want to spend all of our money on
fertilizer?"
"No, no, no. Snelson. The artist. From New York."
"Let's see: 42,000 bags of fertilizer, at $3.85 per bag,
would be..."
"You're not listening. Snelson is a New York artist who
has this huge jungle gym he calls 'Mozart I.' He's in my
sister's bowling league. I think I can get a decent price for
him."
"Wait!" You mean this guy Snelson made a statue of
Mozart out of fertilizer?"
You can see why I have a hard time believing the Uni
versity's story.
I have to admit that I have the benefit of inside in
formation. My source in the Stanford police department

(to protect his identity and my rib cage, we'll call him
STREP THROAT) gave me the real story yesterday over
lunch.
"Listen Mitchel, this case is not high school picnic. It
could get ugly. You better keep your nose clean. Al
though I guess for you that's a pretty big job, heh, heh."
"Can we leave the ethnic stuff out of this? Now tell me,
what is this 'Mozart I?' It looks like a jungle gym."
"It is a jungle gym, you idiot."
"How do you know?"
"Does it look like Mozart to you? Pass the catsup."
"But why would anybody pay $150,000 for Snelson's
jungle gym and donate it to the University?"
"Wise up, Mitchel. That was no donation and there is
no Snelson. Snelson? Sounds like a brand of peanut but
ter to me."
"Fertilizer. Who cares? Then who put the thing
there?"
"Terrorists, Mitchel, terrorists. Are you gonna eat that
pickle?"
"Wait a minute. Why would terrorists put up a huge
jungle gym behind the library. It doesn't make sense/'
"Kid, don't they teach you anything about the real
world at that school. Okay, I guess I'll have to spell the
whole thing out for you. You see, there's this small group
of wc..w.ds in the Palo Alto community that have never
been able to accept Stanford. They call themselves
SGOW (small group of weirdos). They know they can't
get rid of the university, so they want the next best thing
— control. For the past five years, they've demanded
only one thing: they want their leader to be named the
president of Stanford University."
"But that's ridiculous. It'll never happen."
"That's what I thought — until now. See, the members
of SGOW are pacifists, so we know they'll never use vio
lence. They'd kidnap Donald Kennedy, but they know
that no one would ever pay the ransom. So they've re
sorted to the lowest, cruelist, ugliest tactic of all: modern
art. Each year, they make their demand and the univer
sity refuses to listen. So they come in when nobody's lis
tening and put up another 'masterpiece.' They make
most of the stuff themselves."
"Are you trying to tell me ... "
"That's right. King Kong's toilet bowl in front of Green
Library, the pelvis in front of the art building, the wall be
hind the physics tank and now, the jungle gym. All of
those things were the workd of SGOW. Use your head,
Mitchel! Why would a group of wealthy alumni, who
wanted to do something nice for the university, waste
their money by littering the campus with garbage like
that?"
"I guess you're right. But that's horrible. If they keep
this up..."
"If they keep this up, the university will have to give in,
kid. There's a limit to how much modern art people can
stomach. I don't know about you, but I'd hate to wake up
one morning and find 'Mozart ll' outside the Admissions
office."
