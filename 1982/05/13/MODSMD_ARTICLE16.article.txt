## Minneapolis swings to silence Nelson's moans 
### 
Minneapolis — Only a few years
ago, Minnesota was a Time magazine
cover story. Little 'ol Minnesota,
Time editors reported, was the best
place in the country to live, although,
in truth, there wasn't much attention
paid to such things as discos and simi
lar weighty matters that are the es
sence of life when you're a Stanford
man and you've seen the bright lights
of, say, Oakland.
Sadly, all the positive feeling gen
erated by that cover story disap
peared Tuesday when Stanford man
Darrin Nelson was ordered to play
football for the Minnesota Vikings.
Under NFL rules, Nelson must be
come a Viking, find a job or move to
Canada. (Edmonton holds Nelson's
negotiating rights in the Canadian
Football League. If Nelson hates Min
neapolis, wait'll he sees Edmonton.)
Anyway, Nelson let the world
know that he is not a happy man. And
a lot of us have had our little old qual
ity-of-life bubbles popped. But the
people of Minnesota know we need
Darrin Nelson. They know we need
him because Bud Grant says we need
him and what Bud Grants says is so.
But more than Grant's needs are at
stake here. Also at stake is any chance
the State ever will have to get back on
the cover of Time.
In an effort to placate Nelson and
rebuild the suddenly tattered image
of our town and region, the civic
minded are coming up with a list of
exciting things to do in Minnesota.
To date, the list isn't complete, but al
ready contains enough stuff to si
lence the moaner.
• Next Tuesday night, a disco in

downtown Fridley is going to stay
open until 11 p.m.! The two-hour ex
tension of normal closing hours,
which was approved by the Fridley
City Council, is be<ng offered be
cause Whoopee John will be fea
tured.
• Even after 1 a.m. on Blooming
ton's notorious strip, a night owl can
look either at the neon sign at the
Standard station, which is on all
night, or have an omelette — with
pancakes! — at Perkins.
• The Grange will be holding a big
planting festival near the Cargill
elevators at the end of May. (If
Nelson chooses to attend this affair,
he must bring a dish to pass: Baked
beans, potato or red jello are recom
mended dishes. The Grange will pro
vide green Kool-Aid.)
• The Columbia Heights tee-ball
championships are scheduled for
early June. (Boys' games will be held
on Tuesdays and Thursdays; girls'
games on Mondays and Wednes
days.)
Nelson can join thousands of other

law-abiding citizens and go to the
Hennepin County government
building and mock sleazy criminals
who have not paid their parking
tickets. (City officials promised that
stocks will be erected before the next
major offensive against overtime
parking scum.)
• For a real adrenalin rush, Nelson
can listen to a Fourth of July speech
by either Al Qule or Don Fraser.
• Nelson would be welcome to join
the 12,052-member, metropolitan
area Lutheran choir, especially if he's
a first tenor. With a name like Nelson,
he must be Scandinavian, meaning
he's probably a Lutheran. And with a
name like Darrin, there's a pretty
good chance he's a first tenor.
• If Darrin's the swinging sort of
California guy he indicated he is, he
can play two cards at any one of
dozens of illegal bingo parlors.
• If Darrin's a President Ronald
Reagan sort of California guy, he can
join the vigilante committees in town
who have promised law enforcement
agencies they will help in the fight to
keep our beaches clear of perverts
who take off their clothes to get max
imum exposure to our 12Vi days of

summer sunshine.
• Given the fact that he's a football
player — even a poorly paid football
player (times haven't been easy for
poor Max Winter, either, Darrin) —
Nelson would be able to afford a
private box at the dome. If he plays as
much as most Viking rookies, he'll be
able to enjoy it. And none of us really
knows what goes on inside those
boxes, do we?
As mentioned, the list isn't com
plete, yet. Sure to be added before
it's sent to Darrin are items about the
big nightcrawler hunt that's held on
the eve of the walleye opener; Hen
nepin (blush) Av; an outsider's guide
to lutefisk dinners and information
about what clothes to clean at the all
night laundromat at the corner of
Chicago and Lake.
All and all, to a big-time football
player from Stanford, it may not
sound like much. But be it ever so
humble and backward and dull, we
call it home.

• Even after 1 a.m. on Blooming
ton's notorious strip, a night owl can
look either at the neon sign at the
Standard station, which is on all
night, or have an omelette — with
pancakes! — at Perkins.
• The Grange will be holding a big
planting festival near the Cargill
elevators at the end of May. (If
Nelson chooses to attend this affair,
he must bring a dish to pass: Baked
beans, potato or red jello are recom
mended dishes. The Grange will pro

• The Columbia Heights tee-ball
championships are scheduled for
early June. (Boys' games will be held
on Tuesdays and Thursdays; girls'
games on Mondays and Wednes
days.)
Nelson can join thousands of other

law-abiding citizens and go to the
Hennepin County government
building and mock sleazy criminals
who have not paid their parking
tickets. (City officials promised that
stocks will be erected before the next
major offensive against overtime
parking scum.)
• For a real adrenalin rush, Nelson
can listen to a Fourth of July speech
by either Al Qule or Don Fraser.
• Nelson would be welcome to join
the 12,052-member, metropolitan
area Lutheran choir, especially if he's
a first tenor. With a name like Nelson,
he must be Scandinavian, meaning
he's probably a Lutheran. And with a
name like Darrin, there's a pretty
good chance he's a first tenor.
• If Darrin's the swinging sort of
California guy he indicated he is, he
can play two cards at any one of
dozens of illegal bingo parlors.
• If Darrin's a President Ronald
Reagan sort of California guy, he can
join the vigilante committees in town
who have promised law enforcement
agencies they will help in the fight to
keep our beaches clear of perverts
who take off their clothes to get max
imum exposure to our 12Vi days of

summer sunshine.
• Given the fact that he's a football
player — even a poorly paid football
player (times haven't been easy for
poor Max Winter, either, Darrin) —
Nelson would be able to afford a
private box at the dome. If he plays as
much as most Viking rookies, he'll be
able to enjoy it. And none of us really
knows what goes on inside those
boxes, do we?
As mentioned, the list isn't com
plete, yet. Sure to be added before
it's sent to Darrin are items about the
big nightcrawler hunt that's held on
the eve of the walleye opener; Hen
nepin (blush) Av; an outsider's guide
to lutefisk dinners and information
about what clothes to clean at the all
night laundromat at the corner of
Chicago and Lake.
All and all, to a big-time football
player from Stanford, it may not
sound like much. But be it ever so
humble and backward and dull, we
call it home.

Minneapolis — Only a few years
ago, Minnesota was a Time magazine
cover story. Little 'ol Minnesota,
Time editors reported, was the best
place in the country to live, although,
in truth, there wasn't much attention
paid to such things as discos and simi
lar weighty matters that are the es
sence of life when you're a Stanford
man and you've seen the bright lights
of, say, Oakland.
Sadly, all the positive feeling gen
erated by that cover story disap
peared Tuesday when Stanford man
Darrin Nelson was ordered to play
football for the Minnesota Vikings.
Under NFL rules, Nelson must be
come a Viking, find a job or move to
Canada. (Edmonton holds Nelson's
negotiating rights in the Canadian
Football League. If Nelson hates Min
neapolis, wait'll he sees Edmonton.)
Anyway, Nelson let the world
know that he is not a happy man. And
a lot of us have had our little old qual
ity-of-life bubbles popped. But the
people of Minnesota know we need
Darrin Nelson. They know we need
him because Bud Grant says we need
him and what Bud Grants says is so.
But more than Grant's needs are at
stake here. Also at stake is any chance
the State ever will have to get back on
the cover of Time.
In an effort to placate Nelson and
rebuild the suddenly tattered image
of our town and region, the civic
minded are coming up with a list of
exciting things to do in Minnesota.
To date, the list isn't complete, but al
ready contains enough stuff to si
lence the moaner.
• Next Tuesday night, a disco in

downtown Fridley is going to stay
open until 11 p.m.! The two-hour ex
tension of normal closing hours,
which was approved by the Fridley
City Council, is be<ng offered be
cause Whoopee John will be fea
tured.
