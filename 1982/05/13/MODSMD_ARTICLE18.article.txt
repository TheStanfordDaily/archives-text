## Celebrate diversity 
### 
Diversity is a social concept that
must be taken beyond mere ac
knowledgement of differences, if it is
to be a dynamic social value worthy
of our celebration. Have you paid
much attention to whom you find
yourself next to in a class, noticed
who else is attending a dorm theatri
cal production, looked across the
line of scrimmage, or peered into an
opposing team's huddle while out on
the intramural fields, surveyed the
crowd at a White Plaza rally, pon
dered who was or was not in your
church, club or social group, looked
off the stern of your Big-Way yacht to
see who's approaching, or checked
out who might also be applauding a
guest speaker who you thought gave
an inspiring talk?
There is a lot more diversity in this
particular social setting than is, or
probably could be, discovered.
Many of us have been adept at find
ing and noting differences and simi
larities, as well. Few of us have
stretched ourselves enough to test
the significance of these differences
or similarities, or to tried to find out
to whom they are important. Let's be
cautious about becoming compla
cent or lazy inhabitants in an abun
dantly diverse community. LET'S
CELEBRATE DIVERSITY.
