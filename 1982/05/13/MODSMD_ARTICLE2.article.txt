# New ASSU senate chairs elected
## 
### Kathy Bodovitz Senior staff writer 
Junior Raga Elim was elected by the
thirteenth ASSU Senate last night as
its chair for next year and senior Roc
Blumenthal was re-elected as deputy
chair.
Elim is an alternate senator this
year and is currently the chairman of
the Academic Affairs Committee.
Listing "musts" for the senate
chair, Elim ranked motivation for and
commitment to the job as primary.
The second requirement he noted
was time. "There are two types of
time — flexible and structured. Struc
tured time is spent at meetings and in
office hours. The (senate chair) posi
tion demands much more than just
that," he said.
Elim also listed objectivity as essen
tial to the senate chair. "There has to
be a neutrality, a fairness and an ob
jectivity coming from the chair," he
said. Organizational abilities and in
terpersonal skills of the senate chair
vyere also deemed necessary by Elim
who said he believed he was compe
tent in both.

"The role of the chair," he said, "is
to assure that we (the senate) move in
the direction we set out to go."
Among the goals he stated for the
senate chair were getting more grad

uate students involved in the ASSU
and improving the inner-ASSU effi
ciency.
Dave Phelps, this year's senate
chair, said, "The senate chair position
requires charisma, organizational
skills and leadership ability and I
think Raga has all these character
istics."
Graduate Senator Charlie Jackson
said of Elim, "I've been impressed
with him as a person who is very
open." Senator Robin Gaither added
that Elim "seemed very personable,
approachable and personal."
In discussing desirable character
istics for a senate chair, Senator Nick
Gault noted that "Raga is an extreme
ly sensitive person and is very good at
determining what people's concerns
are." Senator Al Taira added, "Raga is
so conscientious."
Lauding Elim, Senator Mike Reeds
said, "Raga is very receptive to hear
ing your ideas. He's conscientious,
humble, open and flexible. Once
Raga's put in a position to do some


Raga Elim
thing, he'll do it."
The senate chair serves for the en
tire year and is allowed to enroll for
three quarters as a half-tuition stu
dent. Phelps said his job as senate
chair this year required about 35
hours per week. In addition, the
chair is paid a salary equal to half of
one year's tuition.
Any student may run for senate
chair — a position which is elected
solely by the senate. The deputy chair
is elected from within the senate and
retains his senate seat. Elim and
Blumenthal were elected at a closed
meeting of the senate and therefore
the vote totals were not released.
Blumenthal described the position

of deputy chair as quite undefined.
"This year I put in about 15 hours per
week. I tried to make the deputy
chair the link between the senate and
the (ASSU) boards and bureaus." He
noted that this year he had created
and run the senate internship pro
gram.
Among goals for next year, he said,
"I hope to get more involved in the
organization of the senate." He
added the responsibility of facil
itating ideas to tne duties of the dep
uty cnair and said, "I will make sure
there's a flow of ideas from place to
place."
Graduate Senator Erik Thompson
said, "I was on the ninth senate when
Roc was parliamentarian and I was
very impressed with him."
The deputy chair receives a salary
of $900 for the year.
