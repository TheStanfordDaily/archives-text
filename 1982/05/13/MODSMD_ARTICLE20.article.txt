# Radio club prepares for emergency crisis
## 
### Polly Grunfeld 
Stanford's Amateur Radio Club is integrat
ing its efforts with those of the Stanford Police
and the Southern Peninsula Emergency Com
munication System (SPECS) to gear up for an
emergency.
In case of an emergency, the two radio fre
quencies presently controlled by the Stan
ford police would be swamped. The amateur
radio operators, equipped with hand-held
transceivers, would man pre-assigned refuge
stations. Base stations, plugged in at "emer
gency centers" (i.e. the hospital, the police
station) would be used for communicating
with the police and the volunteers "at large."
During the post-crisis period, the volun
teers would coordinate their work with
whomever needs them — the police, the
medical center, etc.
Stewart Neubarth, the club president,
pointed out that "the short wave radio will be
very useful in the long run with health and
welfare messages ... when parents in Wis
consin want to know if their son, joey, is
0.K."
Neubarth emphasized the importance of
student and faculty involvement in the emer
gency communications plan.
"Students are independent... don't have
families to care for and are more likely to be
available in the case of an emergency," he ex
plained. "They know the area well, and have
the technical knowledge which would be
very useful in cases of biological hazard."

"There is a problem with students coming
and going, which is why we'd like to get staff
members involved."
Neubarth said he wanted to find out how
many amateurs are available here and how
they can be used in case of an emergency.
Police Chief Herrington is enthusiastic
about Stanford's emergency plan. A police
representative and Ted Harris, coordinator of
SPECS, will be on hand at the meeting to talk
about the present emergency plan and how
volunteers may get involved with future op
erations.
Neubarth mentioned how helpful amateur
radio operators were in the recent floods
down in Santa Cruz and Alviso.
Stanford's Amateur Radio Club was estab
lished more than 50 years ago and is com
pletely supported by dues and donations. Al
though many of its approximately 30 mem
bers are electrical engineering majors, the
club attracts a wide variety of ham radio en
thusiasts — from business students to visiting
professors.
"There are two aspects of this club," Neu
barth explained. "The technical part of build
ing the equipment and the social part of get
ting out and talking to people."
"A short wave station allows you to talk to
other countries ... People join so they can
talk to home without paying anything ...
(and some people do it) to practice a foreign
language."
