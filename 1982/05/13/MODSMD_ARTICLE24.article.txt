Stanford is not the only Bay area univer
sity attempting to put on major concerts
but it is one of the few "big" universities
in the area not doing so now.
Both UC-Berkeley and the University of
Santa Clara regularly put on big-name
acts for their students. Each school, how
ever, has their own method of doing this.
Berkeley has two committees that at
tempt to bring concerts to that campus —
one is student-run and is Stu
dent Union Programmed Entertainment
_ Recreation Board (SUPERB) and the other
University-run committee is called Com
mittee on Arts and Lectures (CAL).
SUPERB, which is affiliated with the As
sociated Students of the University of Cal
ifornia (ASUC) is run by a chairperson,
Cheryl Gainer, and a coordinator,-Laurel
Vin.
SUPERB coordinator Vin said that her
organization does progamming for con
certs of various types — major concerts,
free noon concerts and caba.ret concerts.
The number of concerts they do each
year varies, she said; in the past year they
put on six major performances.
She said that her groups was not in
competition with CAL, although she did
comment that both groups often wind up
wanting the same groups. For instance,
- when asked about the Grateful Dead con
cert scheduled for later this month, she
said that she "wished" that her organiza

tion was putting it on.
Nicole Magnuson, an administrativev
aide for SUPERB, said that the board has
put on two to three free outdoor concerts
per week, as well as an annual Jazz Festival
each May. 5n fact, she said, much of the
music that the group has sponsored in the
past has been jazz.
CAL coordinator Ella Baff said that her
organization has put on mainstream rock
concerts, such as the upcoming Grateful
Dead concert, mostly in co-promotion
with Bill Graham Presents (BGP). She de
scribed the committee's relationship with
the Bay Area promoter as a "cooperative"
one, although Magnuson, of SUPERB,
had said that the competition with Bill
Graham was tough for her group.
Ralph Loeb, the program represent
ative for pop for CAL, went into further
detail on concerts at Berkeley. Using the
Grateful Dead concert scheduled for next
month as a specific example, he said that
in the co-promotion agreement with
BGP, Berkeley and CAL specifically, as
sumed no risk for concerts because BGP
provided all funding for concerts
beforehand, and thus the University did
not have to provide any money for con
certs in advance.
He said that the concert side of the pro
gram was used to subsidize the monetar
ily less-successful fine arts part of the pro
gram, Despite this, tickets for most con
certs, which are usually held in Berkeley's

Greek Theatre, averaged approximately
$11.50. This price is comparable to those
for most Bay area big-name per
formances.
He described the relationship between
his organization and SUPERB as an ad
visory one; in fact, he said, he had often
personally acted as an adviser to the
group because of his greater expeflfence

coordinator, UC Santa

with concerts. For example, he said that
for the last three summers CAL had co
promoted or promoted an average of 18
concerts each year, while SUPERB had
done between three and four in each of
these summers.
At Santa Clara, conc.rfs are promoted
almost solely by students in the As
sociated Students of the University of San-

ta Clara (ASUSC). Within the past year
Greg Kihn, the jefferson Starship and the
Tubes h?ve appeared there, according to
joe Mansfield, social vice-president and
the person most responsible for bringing
these acts there.
In putting on a concert, Mansfield said
that he first went to a booking agent — a
scheduling coordinator for performers.
This agent would tell him what bands
would be appearing in the Santa Clara
area at what time and at what price. Then
Mansfield would pick a band that the
ASUSC could afford and which was ap
pearing at the right time.
After this, he would then present a pro
posal to the associate dean of students to
begin negotiations with the specific
bands. If approved, he would contact the
band through the booking agent and a
contract would be drawn up if the band
agreed. The contract would then be
signed by the controller of the University;
this, according to Mansfield, would in
dicate full and complete support by the
university for the concert — the date, the
band and the facility to be used.
Unlike Stanford and Berkeley, Santa
Clara does not use Bill Graham in co-pro
moting concerts. The primary reason for
this, according to Mansfield was that
Graham "tends to take the attitude that
the facility (at Santa Clara the main con

certs facility is the Leavey Activities Cen
ter) is his." Thus, said Mansfield, "people
in my job have tried not to deal with Bill
Graham." Instead, the ASUSC uses a
booking agent called The Parsons Com
pany.
However, because his organization
does not use Graham's services, there is
risk involved. The ASUSC must put mon
ey up front to pay the performer; most of
the other costs are paid after the show's
receipts are in. Last year the group which
Mansfield heads, which js called Social
Presentations, lost $40,000 under another
social vice-president. Although techni
cally the debt was the ASUSC's, the Uni
versity absorbed it and expects to be paid
off in four years at $10,000 a year.
Besides these major concerts, Social
Presentations puts on several free con
certs a quarter, according to Jim Moran,
the social vice president-elect. Moran
also commented that because of the size
of Santa Clara's student body (about 3500
undergraduates), big-name acts were
hard to attract there. However, the rela
tively small number of students has not af
fected concert ticket prices, which run
between $7.50 and $8.50 a show, as com
pared to an average of about $11.50
elsewhere in the Bay Area.
