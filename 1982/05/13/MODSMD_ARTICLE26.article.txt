# Roble Field: Wrigley Field?
## Bleacher Bums plays to the fans 
### Katie Smith Don Willenburg 
Baseball fans, theatregoers, and
transplanted Chicagoans alike invaded
Roble Field last week, trundling
blankets, heavy sweaters, Cracker Jacks
and peanuts. The occasion? A weekend
series between the Chicago Cubs and
their hated rivals, the St. Louis Cardinals
in the nine-inning comedy, Bleacher
Bums.
If it weren't so cold, you could have
believed you really were at Wrigley
Field in August 1977. Director Tony Kel
ly's outdoor staging was imaginative —
a single set of bleachers with a bit of ivy
up front to represent the right field
wall. The free beer and lemonade made
even easier the leap of faith that we
were inside a ballpark watching an as
sortment of losers, hustlers, and fanatic
devotees watch the Cubs blow another
one.
If the Cubs are noted for losing (as
gambler Marvin (Eric Abrams) pointed
out, "No one ever went broke betting
against the Cubs after the Fourth of
July"), their fans — especially those in
the bleachers — are reviled and re
nowned for their persistent dedication
in the face of pennant hopes that tradi
tionally die before the All-Star break.
Bleacher Bums shows a cross-section
of these fans, from hustler Marvin to re
tiree Zig to nurd Richie. Much of the
comedy comes from playing the stere
otypes against each other: somehow
you know that it's not man about town
Decker but Greg, the blind fan who lis
tens to the game on his radio and re
ports the play-by-play, who will walk
cocktail hostess Melody to the "L" stop

after the game. At the same time,
Bleacher Bums pokes behind the stere
otypes to unveil the dependence these
fans have on each other and on the
team which they can count on to let
them down day after day and year after
year.
Most of the acting was commen
dable. There were moments when the
thrill of the ballpark superseded even
the sting of Roble Field's mosquitoes.
The first component of this enthusiasm
the audience met was "the Kid."
Equipped with the advantage of a type
cast role, 13-year-old Chris Ghirardo
was perfect in this cameo of the
ballpark brat. He chewed gum convinc
ingly, took up space selfishly and de
manded a bribe worth several frosty
malts to relinquish his seat to its rightful
owner.
The claimant, Decker (Steve Wraith),
was a man who could afford the price
plus a hot-dog or two. Wraith did a fine
job of portraying a boyish, spendthrift
businessman, essentially the leader of
the bleacher bum pack. His "go-fer,"
Richie (Tom Dobrocky) was the
epitome of terminally repugnant
pubescence. If his fly weren't coming
undone, he was dribbling frosty malt
down his front, picking his nose or mak
ing inane comments. Dobrocky was so
believable in his role that passers-by still
cringe to see him in White Plaza.
Wraith's other main cohort was Zig
(Allen Cohn), a middle-aged, medium
talented gambler on the lam from his
shrewish wife, Rose(Sally Morton). Zig
has been going to Cub games for 15
years to avoid Rose, who disapproves of

his "throwing money away." Rose sur
prises Zig with her sports knowledge
and gambling finesse, setting up a rec
oncilation which had the potential of
being a telling human encounter and
pushing past the stereotypic characters.
Unfortunately, their stiff interaction
and lack of full character development
made their reunion an unbelievable,
maudlin affair.
Both Abrams (as Marvin) and Mark
Dammann (as the obnoxious
cheerleader) were convincing in roles
as opposite as the Cubs and winning.
Abrams' Marvin was the foul-mouthed
winner you love to hate, betting against
the home team and heaping the ridi
cule on Richie that none of the others
were crass enough to voice. Dam
mann's "cheerleader," on the other
hand, was first obnoxious, then endear
ing as his bouyant chants and taunting
of opposing outfielders brought the
others hope and humor in the face of
certain defeat.
As an event, Bleacher Bums was an
enjoyable outing on the grass — a
creative new slant in campus produc
tion. As a play, there were some faults.
The script was somewhat uneven, caus
ing several scenes to drag. Actors Steve
Chapin (Greg) and Katrin Tobin
(Melody) failed to develop solid per
sonae, and in general the multiple de
nouments were unsupported by earlier
events. But the overall atmosphere was
enthusiastic, fun and supportive — the
entire audience rose for both the Star
Spangled Banner and the seventh in
ning stretch. Hey, losers, take heart.
There's space for you in the bleachers at
beautiful Wrigley Field.

oncilation which had the potential of
being a telling human encounter and
pushing past the stereotypic characters.
Unfortunately, their stiff interaction
and lack of full character development
made their reunion an unbelievable,
maudlin affair.
Both Abrams (as Marvin) and Mark
Dammann (as the obnoxious
cheerleader) were convincing in roles
as opposite as the Cubs and winning.
Abrams' Marvin was the foul-mouthed
winner you love to hate, betting against
the home team and heaping the ridi
cule on Richie that none of the others
were crass enough to voice. Dam
mann's "cheerleader," on the other
hand, was first obnoxious, then endear
ing as his bouyant chants and taunting
of opposing outfielders brought the
others hope and humor in the face of
certain defeat.
As an event, Bleacher Bums was an
enjoyable outing on the grass — a
creative new slant in campus produc
tion. As a play, there were some faults.
The script was somewhat uneven, caus
ing several scenes to drag. Actors Steve
Chapin (Greg) and Katrin Tobin
(Melody) failed to develop solid per
sonae, and in general the multiple de
nouments were unsupported by earlier
events. But the overall atmosphere was
enthusiastic, fun and supportive — the
entire audience rose for both the Star
Spangled Banner and the seventh in
ning stretch. Hey, losers, take heart.
There's space for you in the bleachers at
beautiful Wrigley Field.
Baseball fans, theatregoers, and
transplanted Chicagoans alike invaded
Roble Field last week, trundling
blankets, heavy sweaters, Cracker Jacks
and peanuts. The occasion? A weekend
series between the Chicago Cubs and
their hated rivals, the St. Louis Cardinals
in the nine-inning comedy, Bleacher
Bums.
If it weren't so cold, you could have
believed you really were at Wrigley
Field in August 1977. Director Tony Kel
ly's outdoor staging was imaginative —
a single set of bleachers with a bit of ivy
up front to represent the right field
wall. The free beer and lemonade made
even easier the leap of faith that we
were inside a ballpark watching an as
sortment of losers, hustlers, and fanatic
devotees watch the Cubs blow another
one.
If the Cubs are noted for losing (as
gambler Marvin (Eric Abrams) pointed
out, "No one ever went broke betting
against the Cubs after the Fourth of
July"), their fans — especially those in
the bleachers — are reviled and re
nowned for their persistent dedication
in the face of pennant hopes that tradi
tionally die before the All-Star break.
Bleacher Bums shows a cross-section
of these fans, from hustler Marvin to re
tiree Zig to nurd Richie. Much of the
comedy comes from playing the stere
otypes against each other: somehow
you know that it's not man about town
Decker but Greg, the blind fan who lis
tens to the game on his radio and re
ports the play-by-play, who will walk
cocktail hostess Melody to the "L" stop

after the game. At the same time,
Bleacher Bums pokes behind the stere
otypes to unveil the dependence these
fans have on each other and on the
team which they can count on to let
them down day after day and year after
year.
Most of the acting was commen
dable. There were moments when the
thrill of the ballpark superseded even
the sting of Roble Field's mosquitoes.
The first component of this enthusiasm
the audience met was "the Kid."
Equipped with the advantage of a type
cast role, 13-year-old Chris Ghirardo
was perfect in this cameo of the
ballpark brat. He chewed gum convinc
ingly, took up space selfishly and de
manded a bribe worth several frosty
malts to relinquish his seat to its rightful
owner.
The claimant, Decker (Steve Wraith),
was a man who could afford the price
plus a hot-dog or two. Wraith did a fine
job of portraying a boyish, spendthrift
businessman, essentially the leader of
the bleacher bum pack. His "go-fer,"
Richie (Tom Dobrocky) was the
epitome of terminally repugnant
pubescence. If his fly weren't coming
undone, he was dribbling frosty malt
down his front, picking his nose or mak
ing inane comments. Dobrocky was so
believable in his role that passers-by still
cringe to see him in White Plaza.
Wraith's other main cohort was Zig
(Allen Cohn), a middle-aged, medium
talented gambler on the lam from his
shrewish wife, Rose(Sally Morton). Zig
has been going to Cub games for 15
years to avoid Rose, who disapproves of

his "throwing money away." Rose sur
prises Zig with her sports knowledge
and gambling finesse, setting up a rec
oncilation which had the potential of
being a telling human encounter and
pushing past the stereotypic characters.

and lack of full character development
made their reunion an unbelievable,
