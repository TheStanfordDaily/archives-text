## 
### Cici Oremland Senior staff writer 
The more „han 50 pink flyers that
mysteriously appeared last week in
Meyer Library warning campus
women to "Be Advised" about the
possibilities of sexual harassment in
University libraries have been re
moved for lack of proper display per
mission.
The flyers warned women to be
watchful in particular for one indi
vidual, a Dr. Carl Brunsting, who was
recently convicted on charges of
lewd conduct for masturbating
before two women studying in
Meyer last year. The bottom of the
flyer contains a description of Brunst
ing that can be cut out and carried for
his identification.
All facts detailed on the flyer are
accurate according to court records

filed at the San Jose Municipal Court.
Brunsting, a Palo Alto urologist,
pleaded nolo contendre and was
convicted Mar. 12 on one count of
lewd conduct. He was sentenced to
six months in jail which have been
suspended, six months of psychiatric
counseling, 29 days probation and
$750 in fines for the incident which
had occurred the previous March.
The flyers bear no individual or
group name claiming authorship of
the flyers and no one has yet identi
fied himself as their originator.
Library officials gave no permission
for the flyers' posting and have since
removed them from the building.
Stanford Police Chief Marv Her
rington said the police had absolute
ly nothing to do with the distribution
of the flyers but declined to com
ment further on the case.
