### 
Hey, boys and girls, guess what we're having for lunch todayl
Steak, you say? Nah, too expensive.
Chicken? Nah, not that fowl.
We're having roasted editorial candidates!
MMMMmmmmmm. Yesiree, campers, the boiled potatoes and Irish
coffee are beginning to run out and it's time for a new menu. The bi
annual grill session for candidates for editor will take place today at
noon in the Daily offices. Today's fare includes roasted Richard Kllngler
and |iri Weiss in wine sauce, the two declared candidates for the editor
ot Volume 182. Come ask a bunch of tough questions and make them
accountable for their platforms and their promises (Oh, and for you
picky eaters, we're having ham and tuna. Sandwiches, you cynicsl).
Election
Election for the editor of volume 182 will take place on Monday from
10 a.m. to 10 p.m. in the Daily office. A voting list should be ready by late
this afternoon, featuring all staffers who have worked for the paper for
the past two consequtive pay periods. Anyone who has not worked dur
ing these pay periods but who feels they have particular reason to be on
the voting list should contact the editor.
ETC.
Other business for today's staff lunch will include formulation of
plans for the spring banquet and discussion about the future of college
newspaper Softball. Dispell the myth that those who play on the Daily
Softball team are in it only for the money and the fame. Come to lunch.
Paychecks
There are still a lot of paychecks just sitting there waiting to be claimed
in the managing editor's drawer. Stop by and you'll have enough loot to
pay back all your 1.0.U.'5.
