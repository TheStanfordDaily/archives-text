# Nobel prize-winning economist criticizes U.S. economic policies

### Clay Moltz 
Nobel Prize-winning economist
James Tobin told a near-capacity
crowd at Kresge Auditorium last
night that without a reworking of the
President Ronald Reagan adminis
tration's "monetarist-supply side
mix," the high unemployment situ
ation now plaguing the country will
continue.
Tobin, a Sterling professor of eco
nomics at Yale, called for an easing of
rigid monetary controls to lower in
terest rates and a temporary program
of wage and price guidelines.
Addressing the topic "Are These
Hardships Necessary?," Tobin
criticized, on both practical and the
oretical lines, present measures at
tempting to deal with existing infla
tion and unemployment.
He accused the Federal Reserve
Board of following "obsolete" poli
cies by focusing on the money supply
(M 1) as an economic guidepost.
Tobin also criticized supply-side the
orists, saying it was simplistic to be
lieve that inflation could be over
come simply by creating more goods
to satisfy money demand.
Tobin singled out existing high in
terest rates as a major obstacle to ec
onomic recovery, saying that lower
interest rates are necessary if the
Western world is to get over the se
vere economic shocks of the 19705.
Stopping short of blaming the Rea

gan administration completely for
the present recession, Tobin ad
mitted, "The prospects for recovery
aren't very good anyway." Part of the
blame for the rising federal deficit
Tobin placed on the inherited re
cession, which has had the effect of
cutting taxable corporate profits and
personal incomes which fund the
federal government. Yet, according
to Tobin, the deficit will continue to
grow in the short run because of the
added deficit-prone military budget
brought in by the Reagan adminis
tration.
Tobin described U.S. high interest
rates as part of present American
"beggar thy neighbor" policies,
which have hindered European eco
nomic recovery in an attempt to
solve domestic problems. Tobin said
he agreed with Reagan's anti-infla
tionary goal, but pointed to the ex
pense of his policies on both
domestic and foreign fronts. "I think
it (reducing inflation) could be done
in a socially less costly way," he said.
The wage and price guideposts
Tobin suggested in his talk could be
effective, he said, if organized on a
tax-incentive basis. Rewards would
be given in tax breaks to firms whose
wage contracts and product prices
fell within inflationary targets, creat
ing funds for much needed invest
ment.
In monetary policy, Tobin pro

posed that new federal targets
should be set on the basis of esti
mated growth in dollar GNP (the to
tal demand for goods and services),
"rather than any particular stock of
money, Ml, M 2, etc."
Tobin's predictions for the future
of the Reagan administration
sketched stable rates of inflation but
with continued high unemployment.
"The forecast one sees is that we are
going to be lucky to get unemploy
ment down to eight-and-a-half per
