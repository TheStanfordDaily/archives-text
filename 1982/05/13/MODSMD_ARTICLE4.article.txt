House defeats Reagan's budget plans
Washington — A rebellious House and its Democratic-controlled
committees battered President Ronald Reagan on budget issues yester
day, handing him defeats on housing, college student loans, unemploy
ment compensation and welfare.
In its second such action in two days, the House, on a 343-67 roll call,
approved a $1 billion emergency measure, this time an appropriation,
for a new proeram to subsidize mortgage interest payments of families
who buy new nomes. The program is meant to help prop up the sagging
housing industry, a major victim of the recession.
The House passed the authorization bill for the program Tuesday. The
Republican Senate is at work on similar legislation, but the Reagan ad
ministration opposes it as too costly and budget Director Davie Stock
man said yesterday he would recommend that the president veto the
authorization bill.
Yesterday's $5.9 billion appropriations bill also contains $1.3 billion in
supplemental funds for student aid, $321 million more than the presi
dent wants, and $1 billion he did not seek for the Government National
Mortgage Association, also to help support the housing industry. The
House also, in the same bill, declined to rescind more than $6 billion in
previous appropriations for housing assistance to the poor; Reagan had
sought the rescission.
A House Ways and Means subcommittee,
meanwhile, approved legislation reversing
some welfare cuts Congress made last year and
granting up to 13 weeks of additional federal
unemployment benefits to workers who ex
haust their regular 26 weeks of such federal aid
and a further 13 weeks federal-state assistance
available in some states. The extra 13 weeks are
in response to the rising unemployment rate,
now at 9.4 percent, the highest since the Great
Depression. Committee aides said the addi
tional benefits would cost $158 million this fiscal
year and $627 million in fiscal 1983. To pay for
this the subcommittee proposed dropping the
income level at which receipients must start
paying income tax on unemployment com
pensation.
UN debates as Q.E. II sails
United Nations — Secretary General Javier
Perez de Cuellar yesterday welcomed ex
pressions of British optimism and continued
working toward British-Argentine peace agree
ment by tomorrow.
"I still feel that at the end of the week we
might have some really positive results," Perez
de Cuellar said as he left U.N. headquarters at
the end of the fifth day of his separate dis
cussions with British and Argentine represent
atives.
Although Sir Anthony Parsons, the British
ambassador to the United Nations, had raised
the possibility of a second round of discussions
last night, he and Argentina's Deputy Foreign
Minister Enrique Jorge Ros each met only once
with the secretary general yesterday.
Asked if the change in plans might indicate a
possible breakdown in the talks, Perez de
Cuellar replied: "I don't think so."
If there is an agreement by tomorrow, the in
formal deadline also suggested by British of
ficials, the pace of negotiations will have to
speed up.
Meanwhile, cheered by thousands at
dockside, the passenger liner Queen Elizabeth
II sailed for the South Atlantic from South
ampton yesterday with 3,000 crack British
troops aboard.
A banner aboard the famous luxury liner,
now converted to military use, alluded to Prime
Minister Margaret Thatcher, declaring: "All our
Luv to Maggie, Thanks for the Cruise." Soldiers
in battle gear waved farewells to friends and
loved ones as the 67,000-ton cruise ship headed

out to sea, possibly to be used as part of a British
invasion of the Falklands, should diplomacy fail.
Argentines hassle reporters
Buenos Aires, Argentina — Three British
journalists were briefly abducted here yester
day by unidentified men, stripped of their
clothes and left on a road outside the city.
It was also learned that three members of an
American television team were abducted, then
released on Tuesday.
Meanwhile, the government ordered the de
portation of two Norwegian icpuiieis ami a
writer for an American magazine. Two of them,
a government source said, were "damaging the
interests of Argentina."
The U.S. Embassy, citing "increasing anti-
American sentiment," warned U.S. journalists
here that "emotional elements of the Argentine
populace might subject American journalists to
violence."
All of the attacks reported yesterday were
conducted by men in civilian clothes and driv
ing unmarked cars of the type used by govern
ment security agents here.
Norman Fenton, a producer forThamesTele
vision, said he and three members of the
Thames crew here were walking from the For
eign Ministry toward the Sheraton Hotel, near
central Buenos Aires' waterfront section, when
six men in civilian clothes grabbed them. He
said he ran and escaped but that the others
were forced into cars.
Later newsman Julian Manyon, cameraman
Edward Adcock and soundman Trefor Hunter
were stripped of their clothes and belongings,
including their camera and sound equipment,
and left on a road near the town of Pilar, about
18 miles northwest of the capital.
A diplomatic source said he had been told
that the TV team had been insisting that Foreign
Minister Nicanor Costa Mendez talk to them as
he entered the Foreign Ministry and that one of
the TV men had accidentally hit the minister in
the mouth with a microphone.
Knife-wielder attacks Pope
Lisbon, Portugal — A young man dressed as a
priest lunged at Pope John Paul II with a knife
yesterday night at the basilica of the shrine of
Our Lady of Fatima, where the pontiff had just
given thanks to the mother of Jesus for saving
his life from an assassin's bullet just one year
ago.

The pope was not hurt and his attacker was
overpowered and taken away. The Portuguese
news agency ANOP said the knife was a large
bayonet and that the man held it in his hand
when he lunged at the pope. It was not clear
how close the assailant came to the pontiff.
The news agency said the man shouted,
"Down with the pope!" and "Down with Vat
ican II," a reference to the second ecumenical
conference at the Vatican, in 1962-65, at which a
variety of church reforms were instituted.
The attacker appeared on television to be a
man in his mid-20s with short hair, dressed as a
Spanish priest. No further details were available
here.
Archbishop Paul Mercinkus, the pope's bod
yguard, and other Vatican officials were seen
talking with John Paul after the incident, ap
parently urging him to leave the area im
mediately.
However, while Vatican security men grap
pled with the attacker, the pope climbed the
basilica's steps and blessed the hundreds of
thousands of pilgrims there to see him. He then
left through the back door of the basilica,
ANOP reported, and went to the bishop's resi
dence to spend the night. There was no indica
tion that the crowd knew of the incident.
