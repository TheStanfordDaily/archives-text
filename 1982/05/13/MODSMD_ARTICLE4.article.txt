House defeats Reagan's budget plans
Washington â€” A rebellious House and its Democratic-controlled
committees battered President Ronald Reagan on budget issues yester
day, handing him defeats on housing, college student loans, unemploy
ment compensation and welfare.
In its second such action in two days, the House, on a 343-67 roll call,
approved a $1 billion emergency measure, this time an appropriation,
for a new proeram to subsidize mortgage interest payments of families
who buy new nomes. The program is meant to help prop up the sagging
housing industry, a major victim of the recession.
The House passed the authorization bill for the program Tuesday. The
Republican Senate is at work on similar legislation, but the Reagan ad
ministration opposes it as too costly and budget Director Davie Stock
man said yesterday he would recommend that the president veto the
authorization bill.
Yesterday's $5.9 billion appropriations bill also contains $1.3 billion in
supplemental funds for student aid, $321 million more than the presi
dent wants, and $1 billion he did not seek for the Government National
Mortgage Association, also to help support the housing industry. The
House also, in the same bill, declined to rescind more than $6 billion in
previous appropriations for housing assistance to the poor; Reagan had
sought the rescission.
