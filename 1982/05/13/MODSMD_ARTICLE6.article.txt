Calling current anti-abortion legis
lation on the senate floor a "sample
target for eradication of human
rights," Laurie Ingram, member of
the Committee to Defend Reproduc
tive Rights, last night urged support
for the pro-choice movement.
Ingram, speaking to about 30 peo
ple at Cubberly Auditorium, was one
member of a three-speaker sym
posium on reproductive rights and
current abortion legislation. The
event was sponsored by the Stanford
Pro-Choice Alliance and the Wom
en's Center.
Ingram discussed the increase in
Senate legislation designed to curb
abortion rights. "Two years ago,
there were only three anti-abortion
bills in the Senate," she said. "Last
year there were more than 20. What
we are facing is an attack on women's
rights." She added that anti-abortion
legislation progressed further

through the congressional cycle last
year than ever before in the history of
the pro-choice movement.
"The danger is real and it's now, "
added Dorothy Ehrlich, executive di
rector of the American Civil Liberties
Union of Northern California.
"Abortion will always be with us; the
question is whether the decision to
terminate a pregnancy is legal or not
... There are health risks which the
anti-choice groups refuse to con
sider," she said, citing statistics on
abortion-related deaths in states
where abortion is illegal.
Also speaking at the symposium
was Ann Benner, special assistant to
Congressman Tom Lantos (D-San
Mateo). Benner reaffirmed Lantos'
support of the pro-choice move
ment, and stressed that he is deeply
concerned about the issue.
"Abortion is a very basic moral
position for most members of our so
ciety," Banner said. "It's up to the

public to let congressional leaders
know their viewpoints. Lantos has
been very happy about the response
in his district concerning the con
troversy." She praised the Pro-
Choice Alliance, calling it"the
model group for those struggling
against pro-lifers."
"We are hoping that the current
budget considerations will postpone
the abortion debate for a while," In
gram said. "If it quiets down on the
national level, maybe it will do the
same on the state level as well." All
three agreed that a postponement
would allow extra time for the pro
choice movement to gain support
and to rally against current pro-life
legislation.
Questions asked by the audience
were mostly informational except for
one by a pro-life supporter who
asked when the panel felt life began.
Ingram replied, "25-30 weeks."
