# Native American Indian Festival held this week
## 
### Ruth Harlow 
The University's first American In
dian Festival Week began Tuesday
and Native American students here
said they hope the week will be the
beginning of a greater commitment
by the University to Stanford's Amer
ican Indian population.
According to Anne Medicine, as
sistant to the dean of graduate stud
ies and a Seneka Mohawk Indian,
"The idea behind festival week is to
enhance our presence at Stanford. It
presents things valuable to Indians
and to other cultures. Art and music
are integral to all American life."
Medicine conceived the festival
idea and had no trouble getting it ap
proved by the University, she said.
Yet she said she believes that a
stronger Stanford commitment to
Native American students is neces
sary.
"The Indians here have strong
motivation and a deep sense of com
munity. The University must do more
to encourage this," Medicine said.
"It is ironic that we are having a week
to celebrate community and our

community does not even have a
place to live."
Like Medicine, many of Stanford's
62 American Indian students (36 un
dergraduate, 26 graduate) said they
are enthusiastic about the festival,
but many also call for more support
from school administrators. They
point to the lack of recruiting, Native
American studies courses and per
manent powwow funding, and the
absence of a theme house as evi
dence of minimal commitment by
the University.
"Our own (theme) house would
really help. Indians more than any
thing else like to stick together. And
we could add another valuable
dimension to Stanford with a house,"
said Tony Kahn, student coordinator
of the powwow that will end the
week's activities. "I think a lot of stu
dents would like to learn more about
American Indians."
According to Pat Gomez, a senior
from a New Mexico reservation,
"The administration does not ac
knowledge the value of minority
communities here. The adminis

trators cheat themselves and other
Stanford students."
Gomez and other Native Ameri
cans are actively pushing for a theme
house where both graduate and un
dergraduate students could live.
Gomez said he thinks, however, that
the proposal will fail because "Res Ed
is extremel conventional. It inhibits
innovative programs."
Roble Hall is currently a priority
house for Native American under
graduates, but some Native Ameri
cans there said they fear that the pro
gram will disintegrate with next

year's resident fellow change.
Karen Atkinson and Angel Belin
do, long-time Robie residents, said
that resident fellows Dave and Deane
Haskin have given the program much
support although they are not re
quired to function as advisers for the
program.
Before 1977, Gavilan in Florence
Moore Hall was a Native American
theme house, but with a decline in
the enrollment of undergraduate
American Indians the group could
not fill the required 50 percent of
even a small dormitory
The decreasing size of the Native
Americans population here is also a
major concern of many Native Indian
students.
Kahn stresses that "it would help
our community immensely if we had
a recruiter. Students who are quali
fied don't know about Stanford. If
more students come we can improve
our program more easily."
George Clever, assistant dean of
student affairs, is the only official
liaison betweeen the administration
and Native American under
graduates. This year for the first time
the Undergraduate Admissions Of
fice funded a two-week recruiting
trip by Clever, but the fall enrollment
of Native American freshman is not
expected to exceed the number
which attended last year.
First-year medical student Lori
Cupp said she feels that admissions is
the crucial factor for American Indi

ans here. "I would call it a crisis situ
ation," she said. "They have admitted
nine freshmen. We might expect five
to actually enroll."
"It just shows a lack of commit
ment." Cupp said. "Fred Hargadon
says that not enough American Indi
ans are qualified, but anyone can see
that other schools are pulling many
qualified students away from Stan
ford."
As an undergraduate, Cupp at
tended Dartmouth which she said
has three Native American studies
professors in a $100,000 program, a
$20,000 budget for Native American
students and an effective council of
students, faculty and administrators
that considers Native American is
sues. In addition, she cited substan
tial enrollments of Native Americans
at Berkeley, Harvard and Dartmouth.
Most of the time and energy of the
Stanford American Indian Organiza
tion (SAIO) goes into raising money
for the annual powwow here which
has become one of the most presti
gious in the country. According to
Cupp, an event this large run by so

few students should have permanent
funding; currently the University
does not include the powwow in the
its budget. She added that since fall
quarter the organization has been
raising funds for the Friday's eleventh
annual Stanford Indian Powwow
which is expected to attract three to
five thousand participants.
In addition to working for more
support of Native American program
activities by the University, American
Indian students have called for more
resources to help the American Indi
an student become acclamated to
the University environments. Most
Native Americans arrive with weak
academic preparation and must deal
with culture shock, Gomez said. "I've
gotten over the shock," he said. "The
problems in Indian day-to-day life
here are mostly academic."
"We have valued cooperation for
thousands of years," Clever said.
"Here they value how well one com
petes. The students must walk a thin
line to retain their values and to suc
ceed at Stanford."
In dealing with these academic
