# Native American Indian Festival held this week

### Ruth Harlow 
The University's first American In
dian Festival Week began Tuesday
and Native American students here
said they hope the week will be the
beginning of a greater commitment
by the University to Stanford's Amer
ican Indian population.
According to Anne Medicine, as
sistant to the dean of graduate stud
ies and a Seneka Mohawk Indian,
"The idea behind festival week is to
enhance our presence at Stanford. It
presents things valuable to Indians
and to other cultures. Art and music
are integral to all American life."
Medicine conceived the festival
idea and had no trouble getting it ap
proved by the University, she said.
Yet she said she believes that a
stronger Stanford commitment to
Native American students is neces
sary.
"The Indians here have strong
motivation and a deep sense of com
munity. The University must do more
to encourage this," Medicine said.
"It is ironic that we are having a week
to celebrate community and our

community does not even have a
place to live."
Like Medicine, many of Stanford's
62 American Indian students (36 un
dergraduate, 26 graduate) said they
are enthusiastic about the festival,
but many also call for more support
from school administrators. They
point to the lack of recruiting, Native
American studies courses and per
manent powwow funding, and the
absence of a theme house as evi
dence of minimal commitment by
the University.
"Our own (theme) house would
really help. Indians more than any
thing else like to stick together. And
we could add another valuable
dimension to Stanford with a house,"
said Tony Kahn, student coordinator
of the powwow that will end the
week's activities. "I think a lot of stu
dents would like to learn more about
American Indians."
According to Pat Gomez, a senior
from a New Mexico reservation,
"The administration does not ac
knowledge the value of minority
communities here. The adminis

trators cheat themselves and other
Stanford students."
Gomez and other Native Ameri
cans are actively pushing for a theme
house where both graduate and un
dergraduate students could live.
Gomez said he thinks, however, that
the proposal will fail because "Res Ed
is extremel conventional. It inhibits
innovative programs."
Roble Hall is currently a priority
house for Native American under
graduates, but some Native Ameri
cans there said they fear that the pro
gram will disintegrate with next

year's resident fellow change.
Karen Atkinson and Angel Belin
do, long-time Robie residents, said
that resident fellows Dave and Deane
Haskin have given the program much
support although they are not re
quired to function as advisers for the
program.
Before 1977, Gavilan in Florence
Moore Hall was a Native American
theme house, but with a decline in
the enrollment of undergraduate
American Indians the group could
not fill the required 50 percent of
