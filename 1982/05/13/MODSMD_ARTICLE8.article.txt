## Iraq-Iranian front returns to old borders 
### Los Angeles Times 
Khorramshahr, Iraqi-Occupied Iran —
The Iranian army, advancing on the south
ern front, is maneuvering into a position
that could force Iraq to defend its own
country for the first time in this 20-month
old war.
The focal point of the fighting, probably
the most important since the Iraqi in
vasion, is this port city on the Shatt al Arab,
the waterway that forms the southern
boundary of the two countries.
The fall of Khorramshahr, coupled with
Iranian victories on the central front two
months ago, would force Iraqi troops hard
against their own border. Last weekend
the Iraqis retreated to the border north of
Khorramshahr, leaving only a rear guard
and effectively giving up territory they had
held since the opening days of the war.
The progress of the fight for Khor
ramshahr is, at the moment, difficult to
assess. Iran claimed Monday that its forces
were in the final stages of the operation,
sweeping toward the city from three direc
tions and Inflicting heavy losses on the
Iraqis. Iraq, on the other hand, said Tues
day that it had stopped the Iranians in a
bloody three-hour battle just north of
Khorramshahr, the last major Iranian city
held by Iraqi forces.
The truth, no doubt, lies somewhere in
the middle.
The Iranians began the offensive April

30, crossing the Karun River northeast of
Khorramshahr on three pontoon bridges.
On Saturday, Iraqi troops holding posi
tions near the Iranian city of Ahvaz were
pulled back to the border, possibly to act
as reinforcements for what was then the
impending battle of Khorramshahr. The
territory they left behind was empty, ex
cept for a line of tanks to defend the rear
and a few patrols along the highway.
"We don't like to stay in their area," said
an Iraqi general who would only identify
himself as Muhammed. "We are trying to
persuade them we are not fond of their
ground. It is bare desert and they can have
it."
That kind of talk, however, contradicts
the strategy the iraqis have used since the
opening days of the war: take the land and
hold it until the Iranians agree to a settle
ment, which would give the government
of Saddam Hussein full control over the
Shatt al Arab.
Last weekend, two Western reporters
were ferried from Baghdad to the south
ern front, racing over the Iraqi countryside
at 3000 feet in a Soviet-built supply heli
copter.
The chopper passed over the farmland
of central Iraq, following the Tigris River
that snaked lazily through the countryside.
It passed over the marshlands further
south, finally setting down on a dirt pad at

the military base outside Basra, where the
land is bleak desert dotted with a few
scraggly palm trees.
From there, the trip resumed by jeep,
east across the desert into Iran. On either
side of the narrow, rutted road were
mounds of dirt, bulldozed to protect
against enemy shelling. And hundreds of
trucks carrying troops and equipment
were driving West, away from the front.
"It is because they are not necessary,"
said an Iraqi officer in the jeep. As itturned
out, he was wrong. This was the tail end of
the retreat described by the general
named Muhammed.
About five miles inside Iran, an Iraqi
colonel said Khorramshahr was just ahead
and he saluted a soldier manning the last
checkpoint leading into the city.
But instead of going straight, the jeeps
pulled off onto a dirt road that wound its
way to another branch of the Shatt al Arab.
The colonel said there was still shelling in
the city center, coming from Iranian guns
in Abadan, five miles away.
The jeeps stopped in front of the build
ing that long ago was the palace of a local
sheik. It looked out on the waterway, but
there was little else to see. The noise of the
cannon continued.
"You see, it is all quiet here," he said.
"There are no Iranians here."
Twelve hours later, the Iranian siege of
Khorramshahr began.

it."
That kind of talk, however, contradicts
the strategy the iraqis have used since the
opening days of the war: take the land and
hold it until the Iranians agree to a settle
ment, which would give the government
of Saddam Hussein full control over the
Shatt al Arab.
Last weekend, two Western reporters
were ferried from Baghdad to the south
ern front, racing over the Iraqi countryside
at 3000 feet in a Soviet-built supply heli
copter.
The chopper passed over the farmland
of central Iraq, following the Tigris River
that snaked lazily through the countryside.
It passed over the marshlands further
south, finally setting down on a dirt pad at

the military base outside Basra, where the
land is bleak desert dotted with a few
scraggly palm trees.
From there, the trip resumed by jeep,
east across the desert into Iran. On either
side of the narrow, rutted road were
mounds of dirt, bulldozed to protect
against enemy shelling. And hundreds of
trucks carrying troops and equipment
were driving West, away from the front.
"It is because they are not necessary,"
said an Iraqi officer in the jeep. As itturned
out, he was wrong. This was the tail end of
the retreat described by the general
named Muhammed.
About five miles inside Iran, an Iraqi
colonel said Khorramshahr was just ahead
and he saluted a soldier manning the last
checkpoint leading into the city.
But instead of going straight, the jeeps
pulled off onto a dirt road that wound its
way to another branch of the Shatt al Arab.
The colonel said there was still shelling in
the city center, coming from Iranian guns
in Abadan, five miles away.
The jeeps stopped in front of the build
ing that long ago was the palace of a local
sheik. It looked out on the waterway, but
there was little else to see. The noise of the
cannon continued.
"You see, it is all quiet here," he said.
"There are no Iranians here."
Twelve hours later, the Iranian siege of
Khorramshahr began.
