# War shortages hit Argentina
## 
### Los Angeles Times 
Buenos Aires, Argentina —
The lights are going out all over
Argentina. The volleys of hon
or guards ring out at military
funerals. War taxes are being
imposed. The television news
tells of little but the South At
lantic war.
As fall moves toward the win
ter in the southern latitudes,
Argentina is moving closer to a
war stance. In sprawling Bue
nos Aires, where 10 million Ar
gentines live, much has
changed since the first
boisterous days after April 2.
That was when Argentines
turned out by the tens of
thousands to cheer this na
tion's military seizure of the
British-administered Falkland
Islands. Argentines still strong
ly support the action, but its
price is becoming known:
—The government has or
dered a cutback in electrical
power consumption na
tionwide. Restrictions went
into effect Monday night on
the use of electric power.
Street lights were ordered
dimmed. Display signs were
turned off. Store windows now
"remain dark after a dusk which

comes, this far south, at 6:00
p.m.
—The newspapers print lists
of Argentine dead, and there
are military funerals at ceme
teries here and in the cities of
the south where servicemen
are based. Argentina has ad
mitted 28 dead so far. But some
300 men who apparently went
down with the torpedoed
cruiser General Belgrano re
main listed only as missing.
—Argentina is shifting to a
war economy. The already
weak Argentine peso has been
devalued 16.6 percent, and it
now takes 14,000 to make one
U.S. dollar. Imports of luxury
goods have been curtailed.
Taxes in cigarettes were in
creased by 75 percent and on
whiskey by 45 percent.
"I still think it was right, what
we did," said a young govern
ment secretary. "But it will be a
difficult winter."
The weather turned cooler
this week, with clouds and rain,
dampening the enthusiasm of
crowds, which had gathered
earlier in malls and parks to ap
plaud as government officials
entered the colonnaded pal
aces where the ruling junta
holds its meetings. There are

only small groups now. Many
listen to transistor radios for
news of fighting in the
Malvinas, as Argentina calls the
islands.
But thousands turned out
Sunday to rallyaround a gov
ernment television station
broadcasting a 24-hour mara
thon to raise money for the
Malvinas Islands national Patri
otic Fund, which aids the war
effort. Caught in a mammoth
traffic jam, demonstrators
honked horns and waved
plastic, blue and white Argen
tine flags sold by street
hawkers.
Supplies of easily stored food
stuffs have stabilized after an
initial rush to buy at the end of
the month, when the an
nouncement of U.S. sanctions
against Argentina spurred a
rash of hoarding. The head of
Ford Motor Argentina re
ported, meanwhile, that sales
of cars increased by 30 percent
during April — which a Buenos
Aires financial newspaper said
reflected not an increased
need for care but buying by
those who put their pesos into
durable goods as a hedge
against inflation.
