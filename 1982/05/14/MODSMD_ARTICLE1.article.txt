# Student and Soviet spouse on hunger strike
## 
### Clay Moltz 
Lois Becker Frolov, a Stanford
doctoral candidate, joined her
husband Monday in a hunger
strike in an attempt to gain his re
lease from the Soviet Union. Her
husband Andrei Frolov, a Soviet
travel writer and photographer,
has already had two visa requests
denied.
"We've already put ourselves
on the line. We won't settle for in
terim solutions," she said.
Becker, 27, married Frolov, 51,
last May while doing research in
Moscow for her doctoral disserta
tion. After their marriage, her visa
expired and she was forced to
leave her husband. Except for«
phone calls, she was in contact
with him most recently in March
when she returned to the Soviet
Union on a 19-day travel visa. She
said she and her husband then re
jected the idea of a hunger strike.
However, when she heard re
ports from Western journalists in
Moscow that her husband had en
gaged in a fast for his release, she
decided to join him. "It's the only
way I can support him," she said.
Becker said she reached her
husband by telephone Monday
and at first tried to dissuade him
from the strike, but soon realized
"He was very definite about it."
In a telephone interview with
the Daily from her parents' home
in Chicago, Becker stressed that
her campaign in support of her
husband is being made "on a hu

man rights basis," and not a politi
cal one. Legally, the Helsinki Ac
cords bind the Soviets to the re
unification of families across
borders. However, in her appeals
to the Soviet government Becker
said she emphasized the personal
aspects of their case.
Her husband has no relatives in
the Soviet Union and thus Becker
and her family represent his
closest family ties. Becker said that
in addition, he has not been able
to work since June, 1981. When he
first applied for an exit visa, his
work group "suggested" that he
resign, Becker said.
Becker told the Daily that she
and her husband are pressing his
case because, "There is nothing in
his background that would re
quire he be held for political or se
curity reasons." She said the Sovi
ets had denied his first request
"because of bad relations with the
United States," and the second
"because it is not in the interests
of the Soviet state."
"As far as I can see, they have no
grounds whatsoever," she said.
Since yesterday Becker has
stopped going to her job as a
waitress to conserve her strength
for the hunger strike. She said she
will continue work on her dis
sertation in Russian intellectual
history at home, but will take only
water for sustenance.
Becker said she frequently has
headaches and is dizzy in the
mornings from her fast, but feels

better by the afternoon. She said
she does not plan to halt her fast
until she and her husband can be
reunited.
She is more worried, she said,
about the condition of her hus
band: "At 51 years old, I don't
know how long he can do it."
One source of hope is that the
Frolovs have been joined by six
other couples, four in this coun
try, two in France and one in West
Germany, who are in similar situ
ations. Becker said the Soviet hun
ger strikers have joined together
in Frolov's apartment in Moscow,

and she has been in contact with
some of the other spouses, both
male and female.
Becker has also appealed her
case to Sen. Charles Percy (R-lll.),
head of the Senate Foreign Rela
tions Committee, as well as her
congressman and President
Ronald Reagan, but without re
sults thus far. "I don't know what
to expect at this point," she said.
Letters to Percy, Reagan and Sovi
et Ambassador Anatoly Dobrynin
from her friends, Becker said, are
her greatest hope for a successful
resolution.

case because, "There is nothing in
his background that would re
quire he be held for political or se
curity reasons." She said the Sovi
ets had denied his first request
"because of bad relations with the
United States," and the second
"because it is not in the interests
of the Soviet state."
"As far as I can see, they have no
grounds whatsoever," she said.
Since yesterday Becker has
stopped going to her job as a
waitress to conserve her strength
for the hunger strike. She said she
will continue work on her dis
sertation in Russian intellectual
history at home, but will take only
water for sustenance.
Becker said she frequently has
headaches and is dizzy in the
mornings from her fast, but feels

better by the afternoon. She said
she does not plan to halt her fast
until she and her husband can be
reunited.
She is more worried, she said,
about the condition of her hus
band: "At 51 years old, I don't
know how long he can do it."
One source of hope is that the
Frolovs have been joined by six
other couples, four in this coun
try, two in France and one in West
Germany, who are in similar situ
ations. Becker said the Soviet hun
ger strikers have joined together
in Frolov's apartment in Moscow,

and she has been in contact with
some of the other spouses, both
male and female.
Becker has also appealed her
case to Sen. Charles Percy (R-lll.),
head of the Senate Foreign Rela
tions Committee, as well as her
congressman and President
Ronald Reagan, but without re
sults thus far. "I don't know what
to expect at this point," she said.
Letters to Percy, Reagan and Sovi
et Ambassador Anatoly Dobrynin
from her friends, Becker said, are
her greatest hope for a successful
resolution.
