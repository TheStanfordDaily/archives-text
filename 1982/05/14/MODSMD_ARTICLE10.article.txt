## TASK FORCE REPORT Despite concerted efforts The
						future of performances here still unclear 
### Last in a series by Adam Goodman 
The future of big-name concerts here is
anything but clear. Even those involved in
the effort to bring back concerts are un
sure of what lies ahead.
While most may be confident in their
attempt to return large concerts to this
campus, as for specifics — they have
none.
The Band's attempt for an Elton John
concert June 27-28 seems hopeless and,
according to Vicky Holt, director of
events and services, "Is almost a moot
point." Prospects for a replacement for
John in June look almost as bad since
Stanford must compete with Berkeley's
Day on the Green.
While the Chaparral continues nego
tiations with Bill Graham Presents (BGP)
for the Grateful Dead, even that concert
may be questionable. Chaparral mem
bers have become worried because BGP's
Danny Scher, who they say was con
cerned with how long the approval proc

ess here was taking for the Dead, has sent
no word in two weeks.
However, Holt, who does the nego
tiating for all concerts here, said the Dead
proposal was "not into the mill yet" and
th n the group's tour dates were being
studied. The concert here Is planned for
October. Contacted last week, Scher said
he was not at liberty to comment on the
likelihood of a Dead concert at Stanford.
Asked for the chance of big-name per
formers returning to this campus in con
cert, Scher was succinct: "Excellent."
However, some others Involved in the
concert effort here may be losing their
confidence.
The question now being raised by stu
dent groups such as the Chaparral as welt
as by the University is whether concerts
really have to be done with BGP.
The Chaparral has begun telephone
conversations with other professional
promoting organizations in case BGP falls
through.
"(Bill Graham) is not the only one we
have to work with/' explained Vinnie
Freda, Chaparral business manager. "The
Chaparral would be happy if outside pro
moters are willing to work here." Freda
said that Feyline Productions out of Den
ver was "very interested" in doing shows
here.
As the University Committee on Con
temporary Entertainment (COCE) studies
the concert situation here, various pro
moting schemes have been discussed —
the current co-promotion attempts be
tween student groups and promoters
such as the Band and BGP, a student-run
promotion organization such as the old
ASSU Special Events, and even long-term
contracts with one professional pro
moter.
Freda, who is also a COCE intern, said
he supports the long-term contract idea.
According to the terms.of such a contract,
one outside promoter would be respon
sible for the production of concerts on

campus. With such a system, Freda said
student groups could still be guaranteed a
share of the profits as well as production
experience. Using BGP as an example,
Freda said that the organization could in
itiate concerts here rather than have to
co-promote, "save a lot of headaches"
and speed up the process.
"Right now (to co-produce) you have
to be a student, head of a student group
and a concert promoter. Someone who
has that much to do cannot move as fast as
Danny (Scher of BGP) can move," he ex
plained.
Holt said the idea of long-term con
tracts with promoters has only been dis
cussed in the COCE and not with outside
promoters. She compared the proposal to
the set-up at UC-Berkeley.
Holt said what she would really like to
see in the future is for studentshere to be
able to produce their own concerts.
"You don't have to do co-promotion,"
she explained. To produce a small con
cert Holt estimated a $20,000 to $25,000
price tag. A fee assessment could possibly
be used to sponsor a concert.
"I hope we eventually get to that point.
But that means that there is greater finan
cial risk for the student organization. We
may never get to that point. Nobody may
be financially stable enough to do that.
That's actually the best way to do the busi
ness," she said.
"I think co-promotion is the only way
anything is going to happen at Stanford
right now — any large concerts —• just be
cause it's an expensive business and no
body has that kind of money."
Holt predicted that Stanford would not
do more than four or five "big events" on
campus per year because of other nearby
concert locations. "Our students go
elsewhere," she said. ..
As for the immediate future, Holt said
she knew of no other proposals than the
Band's and Chaparral's. The COCE is
sponsoring an orientation meeting May

19 for those groups interested in sponsor
ing concerts. Summer preliminary pro
posals for concerts are due no later than
May 28.
According to COCE member Freda, the
only definite concert this summer is a jazz
performance by Stan Getz July 31 or Aug.
1. Freda was also extremely concerned
with criticism recently leveled against
summer concerts.
"When Special Events was around, par
ticularly when it was successful ... the
shows which really made money were
during the summer," he said. "For a stu
dent group trying to make money and
struggling, it's very important to put on a
show that has odds of being successful."
Freda also said that 80 percent of most
concert audiences are from off-campus.
In addition, this summer Freda said it is

"important to see how the new system is
shaping up."
According to Holt, the most important
thing any group must remember when in
volved with concerts is not to get caught
up in the mystique. "You can't get so
enamored about having a particular artist
that you lose sight of the reason why you
are doing the event/' she said. "I think
that's part of what happened to Special
Everts. It's a very glamorous business but
when you are negotiating you have to re
member that you are negotiating on
behalf of a student organization or uni
versity organization — the primary goal is
to have a successful event with some
good financial return to the organization.
"The final goal is not whether Elton
John comes to Stanford, but whether or
not the Band has a successful fundraiser."


NO CO - Though the Stanford Band
had hoped to sponsor Elton John in a
Frost concert next month the rock
star will not be performing here be
cause he needs an indoor facility in
order to do a laser light show.


STILL UP IN THE AIR — The Chaparral's attempt to bring the Grateful Dead to
campus in October may not be achieved. The humor magazine is beginning to
worry about this co-promotion effort with Bill Graham Presents and nas talked
with other promoters in case BGP falls through.
