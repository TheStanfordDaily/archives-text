# Student-run agency books bands for on-campus parties
## 
### Mark Zeigler 
While student groups and the Uni
versity may be having problems in
getting big-name artists to return to
campus for concerts, three student
entrepreneurs here are working to
ensure that lesser-known musical
groups will continue to perform at
campus parties.
Though it may sound like a Mafia
run outfit, the Entertainment
Network is actually a student-run
band booking agency that more
often than not contracts the various
musical groups at on-campus parties.
Formerly Stanford Booking As
sociates, the Entertainment Network
has officially been in operation for
less than two months and already has
experienced more than a fair degree
of success.
"I think we do provide a viable ser-

vice on campus. It takes time to get a
reputation and prove yourself, but I
think we've done pretty well," said
sophomore Aaron Persky, who han
dles a good deal of the booking
chores.
When Persky says "we" he is refer
ring to himself and the two other stu
dents who make up the Network —
sophomores Todd Baker and Vinnie
Freda. Both Freda and Baker hold
other entertainment-related posi
tions on campus. Freda is a concert
intern for the Committee on Com
temporary Entertainment and Baker
is the director of the Campus Enter
tainment Board.
The roots of this student-op
erated booking business were in last
year's ASSU project of band booking.
"But we really didn't have any coop
eration from the (ASSU) Senate and

the student financial manager (Steve
Davis)," Freda explained. "So we just
decided to make it our own business.
"We started making connections.
Then we got a license (from Califor
nia's Labor Commission) and we be
came a legitimate business," he con
tinued. Freda and Baker spent a con
siderable amount of time during the
summer making these "contacts" —
which meant attending a group's
concert, usually in a San Francicio
nightclub.
The Entertainment Network can
book rock, new wave, punk and jazz
bands, to name a few, from all over
the Bay Area and even the nation.
"We can contact fairly large bands
like Greg Kihn and Hewy Lewis (and
the News)," Freda said. "We can con
tact virtually any band in the U.S."
In fact, the Network had originally

contracted the Tazmanian Devils to
play at Aqua Follies, but the aquatic
event was cancelled and so were the
Devils.
Probably their most prestigious
event to date will be tomorrow's
Splendor on the Crass, an 11 a.m. to
midnight party in Manzanita Park for
which the Network booked all five
performing bands. Two of the
groups, No Sisters and the Punts,
were chosen by Rolling Stone maga
zine as likely to succeed. The head
liner, the Rubinoos, are two-time
Beserkely recording artists and very
popular in the Bay Area.
Baker, who handles most of the
promotion for the agency, talks
about groups as "breaking new
ground. The kind of bands that we
have are on the verge of doing that."
"People don't realize how many

bands are out there and want to play
for Stanford," Freda commented.
Generally, a student group will tell
the Network the type of music they
want and for how much money they
want it. "We book the bands, we get
the contracts, we explain them and
get them signed," Baker said.
The Network takes a commission
from the bands once it has booked
them. "Most of the profits we have
made have been put back into the
business," Freda noted.
The Entertainment Network books
off-campus bands almost exclusively,
since it has experienced problems
with the Stanford groups. "There's
been some sort of conflict in that re
spect," Freda said. "We get heat
from campus bands when we do not
book them." Also, student groups I
seeking a campus band can just as I

easily call the musicians directly, sav
ing both parties time and money.
Baker claims that most of the
"Network's" groups, even the bigger
ones, "don't rea/y clear any money
when they play over here." Instead,
"they get exposure and have a good
time."
In the future, Stanford's booking
agency has many options, according
to Persky.The Network can, for in
stance, branch out and "do high
school bookings" or get into the
campus concert scene, "since that is
looking up (right now)," he said.
Nevertheless, the three seem satis
fied with their present activities.
"Hopefully, we're pumping some
blood into the campus music scene,"
Freda said.

book them." Also, student groups I
seeking a campus band can just as I

easily call the musicians directly, sav
ing both parties time and money.
Baker claims that most of the
"Network's" groups, even the bigger
ones, "don't rea/y clear any money
when they play over here." Instead,
"they get exposure and have a good
time."
In the future, Stanford's booking
agency has many options, according
to Persky.The Network can, for in
stance, branch out and "do high
school bookings" or get into the
campus concert scene, "since that is
looking up (right now)," he said.
Nevertheless, the three seem satis
fied with their present activities.
"Hopefully, we're pumping some
blood into the campus music scene,"
Freda said.
While student groups and the Uni
versity may be having problems in
getting big-name artists to return to
campus for concerts, three student
entrepreneurs here are working to
ensure that lesser-known musical
groups will continue to perform at
campus parties.
Though it may sound like a Mafia
run outfit, the Entertainment
Network is actually a student-run
band booking agency that more
often than not contracts the various
musical groups at on-campus parties.
Formerly Stanford Booking As
sociates, the Entertainment Network
has officially been in operation for
less than two months and already has
experienced more than a fair degree
of success.
"I think we do provide a viable ser-

vice on campus. It takes time to get a
reputation and prove yourself, but I
think we've done pretty well," said
sophomore Aaron Persky, who han
dles a good deal of the booking
chores.
When Persky says "we" he is refer
ring to himself and the two other stu
dents who make up the Network —
sophomores Todd Baker and Vinnie
Freda. Both Freda and Baker hold
other entertainment-related posi
tions on campus. Freda is a concert
intern for the Committee on Com
temporary Entertainment and Baker
is the director of the Campus Enter
tainment Board.
The roots of this student-op
erated booking business were in last
year's ASSU project of band booking.
"But we really didn't have any coop
eration from the (ASSU) Senate and

the student financial manager (Steve
Davis)," Freda explained. "So we just
decided to make it our own business.
"We started making connections.
Then we got a license (from Califor
nia's Labor Commission) and we be
came a legitimate business," he con
tinued. Freda and Baker spent a con
siderable amount of time during the
summer making these "contacts" —
which meant attending a group's
concert, usually in a San Francicio
nightclub.
The Entertainment Network can
book rock, new wave, punk and jazz
bands, to name a few, from all over
the Bay Area and even the nation.
"We can contact fairly large bands
like Greg Kihn and Hewy Lewis (and
the News)," Freda said. "We can con
tact virtually any band in the U.S."
In fact, the Network had originally

contracted the Tazmanian Devils to
play at Aqua Follies, but the aquatic
event was cancelled and so were the
Devils.
Probably their most prestigious
event to date will be tomorrow's
Splendor on the Crass, an 11 a.m. to
midnight party in Manzanita Park for
which the Network booked all five
performing bands. Two of the
groups, No Sisters and the Punts,
were chosen by Rolling Stone maga
zine as likely to succeed. The head
liner, the Rubinoos, are two-time
Beserkely recording artists and very
popular in the Bay Area.
Baker, who handles most of the
promotion for the agency, talks
about groups as "breaking new
ground. The kind of bands that we
have are on the verge of doing that."
"People don't realize how many

bands are out there and want to play
for Stanford," Freda commented.
Generally, a student group will tell
the Network the type of music they
want and for how much money they
want it. "We book the bands, we get
the contracts, we explain them and
get them signed," Baker said.
The Network takes a commission
from the bands once it has booked
them. "Most of the profits we have
made have been put back into the
business," Freda noted.
The Entertainment Network books
off-campus bands almost exclusively,
since it has experienced problems
with the Stanford groups. "There's
been some sort of conflict in that re
spect," Freda said. "We get heat
from campus bands when we do not
book them." Also, student groups I
seeking a campus band can just as I

easily call the musicians directly, sav
ing both parties time and money.
