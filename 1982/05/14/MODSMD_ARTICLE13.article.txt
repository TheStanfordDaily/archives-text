## Editorial Work visas prohibited? 
### 
If the proposed Immigration Reform and
Control Act (H.R. 5872 and S-2222) is passed by
the House of Representatives and Senate as it
now stands, foreign students would be forced to
leave the country for two years before being
eligible to apply for a visa that would allow them
to work here: prohibited from working in the
United States immediately after receiving
degrees from American colleges.
Sound ludicrous? Prof. Robert White,
chairman of the electrical engineering
department here, thinks so and we agree with
him. In a sharply worded letter to Sen. Alan
Simpson (R-Wyo.), White said that he did not
understand the logic of expelling from the
country highly trained individuals after
investing time, energy and resources into their
educataion. "It would be much more sensible,"
White stated in the letter, "to require these
students to stay in the United States... so that
we might reap the benefits of their training.
Expelling them is positively ludicrous."
White pointed out that arguments that foreign
students were taking away jobs from Americans
had no merit, especially in his field as there is an
excess of jobs for graduate electrical engineers.
Because the electrical engineering department

here is the largest in the University, and because
Stanford's department has consistently been the
top-ranked in the country, White's opposition
will have some impact on the legislators.
We hope so. It would be ridiculous to impose
further restrictions on the visa of any foreign
student. Section 212, which would affect foreign
students, seems to us to oppose the Reagan
administration's expressed concern about
technology transfer; it would allow technology
to escape in the form of trained scholars.
It is very possible that the strongly critical
reactions that the bill has already provoked will
cause legislators to strike Section 212 from the
measure; a Senate subcommittee spokesman
said earlier this week that he expected "some
softening of the legislation before it passes."
But, as we see it, the more critical reaction the
better. University President Donald Kennedy
told the Daily that Stanford "will make our views
known to Congress"; we hope he does so soon,
strongly. And we hope others who feel strongly
about the bill will write to legislators too.
Perhaps Rep. Romano Mazzoli (D-Ky.) and
Simpson, who are co-sponsoring the act, made a
careless mistake. But is imperative that we tell
them so.
