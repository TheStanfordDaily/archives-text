# Science not public property
## 
### 
A front page article (Daily, May 3)
recorded a panel discussion on "Sci
ence for sale: private control of a
public resource." Al Meyerhof of the
Natural Resources Defense Council,
a private, presumably non-profit or
ganization, and David Noble of MIT
were quoted as blasting the connec
tion of science, the university and in
dustry. The blast was laced with in
uendos of conspiracy (the press was
limited in its access to a meetingl)
and examples of the shoddy ethics of
some scientists.
Meyerhof pushed for more gov
ernment control over the lives and
work of scientists who work for uni
versities, such as public disclosures of
their personal financial affairs. What
we hear, then, is the cry of another
pressure group or lobby, attempting
to gain control over a productive
union of organizations — a desire to
enslave. What seriously makes me
shudder is the apparently un
disputed labeling of Science (i.e., the
work I do) a "public resource,"
which translates "public property" as
the panelists used it.
So the question arises: who does
the scientist work for? The logical
and objective answer is that the sci
entist works for whoever pays him,
and is controlled in the direction of
his research by his employer, to the
extent that his contract with that em
ployer requires.
That is, he is bound by a voluntary
agreement to do certain kinds of re
search, perhaps keeping some or all
of it confidential. If he is self-em
ployed, he can pursue whatever re
search he likes and reveal or keep it
secret as he chooses, as long as he
perpetrates no fraud or violence on
his fellow man.
But what about the university pro
fessor/scientist? Who does he work
for? Ostensibly he collects his pay
from the university. However, May
erhof and his group state that people

"other than university presidents ...
should decide what direction scien
tific research should take."
As the employer, it seems to me
that the university has the first right
to decide what direction it will take,
although traditionally, it has not. The
contractual agreements that pro
fessors make with universities gener
ally allow for a degree of "academic
freedom," which is to say that the in
dividual professor directs his own re
search because too much control stif
fles creativity.
As for revealing the results of his
work to the general public, it is part
of the professor's pay to attain pres
tige, and also a part of the university's
advantage in hiring him, so publica
tion of the results of research is a part
of most contracts. You will note that
all of this has nothing to do with the
"public good" except that as a secon
dary result of the relationship of sci
entists to universities, the public does
benefit. The relationship does not
make the science public property per
se.
The situation is more complicated
these days for university researchers,
however, since they can no longer
serve one master. Nearly all new fac
ulty in the sciences today are judged
on their ability to bring outside mon
ey for research into the university.
For the last 10-20 years this has meant
government money in the form of
grants from various agencies such as
the National Science Foundation.
So the second employer of the sci
entist is the government, and it gives
him the direction his research will
take (by not granting funds to
projects which do not meet the gov
ernment's current priorities) and de
cides the disposition of the results —
published or kept secret, especially
in cases of defense-related research.
It appears that this connection of
government money and university
research has led to the notion that
science is somehow inherently pub
lic property. But, clearly, this is only
the case where the funding does

come from the public, and then it is
debatable whether government fun
ding and directing of research really
leads to public good.
Now that government is
diminishing its role in supporting sci
entific research, universities, which
have become accustomed to "out
side money," are turning to industry
for support.
Industry also desires to support
only research which suits its current
priorities, and wants to keep secret
those parts of the results which give it
an advantage over competitors. Per
sonally, I'd prefer to work for in
dustry whose motives are obvious
(profits) rather than obscure (public
good? power? bureacratic waste?).
If, for ethical reasons, I suddenly
decide that I won't continue this re
search (it might hurt people), or will
breech my contract and reveal my
work to the public, then if I work for
industry I will probably lose money.
If I work for government, I will prob
ably go to jail, or could even lose my
life — it has been called treason. I'd
rather lose the money, and I'd rather
be able to judge accurately the
motives of my employer. But this is
personal reference.
Since the University is still con

cerned with academic freedom and
the prestige and reputations of its
professors, much negotiation is now
going on as more support comes in
from industry. This is natural. Also,
each scientist involved must enter
into contracts with industry and the
university that are in keeping with his
own ethical principles. But, there are
no guarantees that all scientists are
ethical, in this situation or any other,
any more than any other group of
people. The name of the employer is
of little consequence if the scientist
himself is immoral.
What, then, is the real reason for
this attack on science, scientists, and
the university as a research institu
tion that requires funding? It appears
to me to be another group of power
seeking self-appointed guardians of
the "public good" seeking to use the
law to control and manipulate what
doesn't belong to them, i.e. what
private individuals are producing
and paying for. As scientists, it is time
we asked ourselves who we do work
for, and see to it that we work for
them, else we also are thieves.

and is controlled in the direction of
his research by his employer, to the
extent that his contract with that em
ployer requires.
That is, he is bound by a voluntary
agreement to do certain kinds of re
search, perhaps keeping some or all
of it confidential. If he is self-em
ployed, he can pursue whatever re
search he likes and reveal or keep it
secret as he chooses, as long as he
perpetrates no fraud or violence on
his fellow man.
But what about the university pro
fessor/scientist? Who does he work
for? Ostensibly he collects his pay
from the university. However, May
erhof and his group state that people

"other than university presidents ...
should decide what direction scien
tific research should take."
As the employer, it seems to me
that the university has the first right
to decide what direction it will take,
although traditionally, it has not. The
contractual agreements that pro
fessors make with universities gener
ally allow for a degree of "academic
freedom," which is to say that the in
dividual professor directs his own re
search because too much control stif
fles creativity.
As for revealing the results of his
work to the general public, it is part
of the professor's pay to attain pres
tige, and also a part of the university's
advantage in hiring him, so publica
tion of the results of research is a part
of most contracts. You will note that
all of this has nothing to do with the
"public good" except that as a secon
dary result of the relationship of sci
entists to universities, the public does
benefit. The relationship does not
make the science public property per
se.
The situation is more complicated
these days for university researchers,
however, since they can no longer
serve one master. Nearly all new fac
ulty in the sciences today are judged
on their ability to bring outside mon
ey for research into the university.
For the last 10-20 years this has meant
government money in the form of
grants from various agencies such as
the National Science Foundation.
So the second employer of the sci
entist is the government, and it gives
him the direction his research will
take (by not granting funds to
projects which do not meet the gov
ernment's current priorities) and de
cides the disposition of the results —
published or kept secret, especially
in cases of defense-related research.
It appears that this connection of
government money and university
research has led to the notion that
science is somehow inherently pub
lic property. But, clearly, this is only
the case where the funding does

come from the public, and then it is
debatable whether government fun
ding and directing of research really
leads to public good.
Now that government is
diminishing its role in supporting sci
entific research, universities, which
have become accustomed to "out
side money," are turning to industry
for support.
Industry also desires to support
only research which suits its current
priorities, and wants to keep secret
those parts of the results which give it
an advantage over competitors. Per
sonally, I'd prefer to work for in
dustry whose motives are obvious
(profits) rather than obscure (public
good? power? bureacratic waste?).
If, for ethical reasons, I suddenly
decide that I won't continue this re
search (it might hurt people), or will
breech my contract and reveal my
work to the public, then if I work for
industry I will probably lose money.
If I work for government, I will prob
ably go to jail, or could even lose my
life — it has been called treason. I'd
rather lose the money, and I'd rather
be able to judge accurately the
motives of my employer. But this is
personal reference.
Since the University is still con

cerned with academic freedom and
the prestige and reputations of its
professors, much negotiation is now
going on as more support comes in
from industry. This is natural. Also,
each scientist involved must enter
into contracts with industry and the
university that are in keeping with his
own ethical principles. But, there are
no guarantees that all scientists are
ethical, in this situation or any other,
any more than any other group of
people. The name of the employer is
of little consequence if the scientist
himself is immoral.
What, then, is the real reason for
this attack on science, scientists, and
the university as a research institu
tion that requires funding? It appears
to me to be another group of power
seeking self-appointed guardians of
the "public good" seeking to use the
law to control and manipulate what
doesn't belong to them, i.e. what
private individuals are producing
and paying for. As scientists, it is time
we asked ourselves who we do work
for, and see to it that we work for
them, else we also are thieves.

A front page article (Daily, May 3)
recorded a panel discussion on "Sci
ence for sale: private control of a
public resource." Al Meyerhof of the
Natural Resources Defense Council,
a private, presumably non-profit or
ganization, and David Noble of MIT
were quoted as blasting the connec
tion of science, the university and in
dustry. The blast was laced with in
uendos of conspiracy (the press was
limited in its access to a meetingl)
and examples of the shoddy ethics of
some scientists.
Meyerhof pushed for more gov
ernment control over the lives and
work of scientists who work for uni
versities, such as public disclosures of
their personal financial affairs. What
we hear, then, is the cry of another
pressure group or lobby, attempting
to gain control over a productive
union of organizations — a desire to
enslave. What seriously makes me
shudder is the apparently un
disputed labeling of Science (i.e., the
work I do) a "public resource,"
which translates "public property" as
the panelists used it.
So the question arises: who does
the scientist work for? The logical
