# ERA loses Its appeal
## 
### 
June 30 is the deadline for ratifi
cation of the Equal Rights Amend
ment (ERA). I don't think it will pass.
Apathy is killing the ERA. In the vacu
um left by citizens who don't care
about important political issues, the
forces of narrow-mindedness rush
in.
Apathy elected Ronald Reagan,
with almost three-fourths of the vot
ers staying home in disgust or voting
against him. If the arms race ends in
nuclear holocaust, it will be apathy
that pushed the button. Apathy is al
lowing a guarantee of basic human
freedoms to die quietly.
Let us look at what might have
been with the ERA as a part of our
Constitution. Patchwork laws protec
ting women's rights, now subject to
repeal, would have been made uni
form and universal. Opportunities
for women in work, education and
property ownership would have in
creased. More meaningful life
choices for women, as in marriage,
would have been available. Such
choices would have included tradi
tional as well as new roles.
In the first seven years of ERA ratifi
cation, 35 of the 38 states required
passed it, responding to a surge of
public interest in the ERA. In the last

four years, with interest fading away,
no other states have ratified it.
As the ERA gasps for public con
cern, conservative minorities work to
guarantee women a place in the
home and the kitchen. Our Senate
labors mightily to guarantee preg
nancies to women who don't want
them.
And though opinions polls show
that a majority of Americans want the
ERA, we hear that a Constitutional
amendment really isn't necessary to
deal with the many aspects of gender
discrimination. But we seemingly do
need amendments for single issues of
school prayer, busing and abortion.
Sexual discrimination is a more
pervasive problem than racism,
against which the Constitution offers
at least a little protection. Even in
Stanford's sheltered atmosphere we
can still smell sexism: look at the
paltry number of tenured women
professors.
Where is all the energy and talent
of the Stanford community going?
Not very much is directed into in
telligent political discussion or ac
tion. We sign far more credit card
slips than petitions. If political apathy
is a major problem among people
who want to be leaders in American
society, then it is no wonder that so
many less-motivated fellow citizens
don't care.
Disillusioned, I've let my active
support for the ERA dwindle. It
seems much easier to disperse
energy among 1000 more superficial
things than to concentrate on a pub
licly dead issue.
