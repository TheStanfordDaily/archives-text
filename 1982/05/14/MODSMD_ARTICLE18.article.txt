## Civil liberties—the beat cop's job 
### 
I really like newspapers. I read
them, write for them, and even use
them to wrap fish.
The Daily is one newspaper that I
like a 10t... most of the time.
In the past two weeks, though, let
ters on this page of the Daily have
suggested that I have been "smuggly
scoffing" although I am at the same
time in a "perpetual state of
slumber," somehow completing the
wrong graduate program.
Since it will likely be some time
before my grandmothers send letters
to the Daily attesting to my good
qualities, let me respond by stating
that the first two charges are entirely
untrue. Furthermore, it is only when I
am seated in class that I appear to be a
state of perpetual slumber.
I would not have learned these
juicy tidbits about myseff had I not
written a letter to the editor two
weeks ago about civil liberties. (The
story is not without a touch of irony.)
I was concerned that the police
were stopping black students on
campus. I worried that their rights
were being violated and that rela
tions between blacks and whites on
this campus were being strained.
I was glad to see that Daily re
sponded to this concern with an ex
cellent front page feature last Thurs
day, "Black men — rapist's other vic
tims."
I also wrote to express my curiosity
about police actions on campus. It
had occured to me that the police
were more visible on campus. I fre
quently hear their sirens, which sug
gests to me that they are often stop
ping people. Yet, there is only an oc
casional story in the Daily about an
arrest on campus.
It seemed to me that there were
more police than before and that
they were more active, but I really
didn't know what they were doing
aside from stopping more black stu
dents. I had hoped that by writing to
the Daily, the police might respond
or the Daily might write a story about
this issue.
I have a great deal of respect and
confidence in the police, but I also
like to know what they are doing.
Part of this stems from my interest in
ancient history — the United States in
the early 70s. A few weeks ago, for
example, I read in the Wall Street

Journal that the FBI had been spying
on women's rights groups and black
students at 15 lowa colleges between
1957 and 1979. It wasn't until 1982 that
we found this out thanks to a re
porter who happened to make a
Freedom of Information Act request.
We know now that this sort of
thing went on at a number of col
leges outside of the hotbeds of radi
calism in lowa. In fact, in 1971, police
broke into the offices of the Daily to
search through the paper's files. This
isn't really ancient history at all.
Ronald Reagan was governor of Cali
fornia then.
When I hear the sirens around
campus at night, this is what I think
about.
I would feel much more com
fortable if I knew exactly what the po
lice were doing, but I don't. Neither
does this newspaper. Police don't
break into the Daily's offices any
more, but they don't answer very
many questions either. They're not
very accountable.
At the same time, we need them to
deter crime, and nobody wants to
eliminate the police force, which is
what some people thought I was sug
gesting. We need to find the right
balance. The reason I wrote to the
Daily was to elicit more facts and to
provoke some discussion of what the
proper balance should be.
To draw attention to my letter, I
wrote that my concern for civil liber
ties was keeping me awake at night.
The Daily headlined my letter, "Se
curity, sirens keep some awake at
night." It appeared the same day as
the front page headline, "Woman at
tacked near Kresge."
Some people incorrectly thought I
was writing about noise pollution or
insomnia, which I will admit would
have been pretty silly issues to write
about when there are so many signif
icant issues before us.
I am glad to see that I contributed
to campus debate, but I really think
that we will all be better off if we deal
with the important issues of the day,
rather than comment on personal
qualities of people who write to the
paper.

We might not always find the solu
tions to the problems before us, but
at the very least, this will save my
grandmothers the trouble of writing

in to defend me. (For less than careful
readers, this is not a letter about
grandmothers. It is about civil liber
ties.)

very accountable.
At the same time, we need them to
deter crime, and nobody wants to
eliminate the police force, which is
what some people thought I was sug
gesting. We need to find the right
balance. The reason I wrote to the
Daily was to elicit more facts and to
provoke some discussion of what the
proper balance should be.
To draw attention to my letter, I
wrote that my concern for civil liber
ties was keeping me awake at night.
The Daily headlined my letter, "Se
curity, sirens keep some awake at
night." It appeared the same day as
the front page headline, "Woman at
tacked near Kresge."
Some people incorrectly thought I
was writing about noise pollution or
insomnia, which I will admit would
have been pretty silly issues to write
about when there are so many signif
icant issues before us.
I am glad to see that I contributed
to campus debate, but I really think
that we will all be better off if we deal
with the important issues of the day,
rather than comment on personal
qualities of people who write to the
paper.

We might not always find the solu
tions to the problems before us, but
at the very least, this will save my
grandmothers the trouble of writing

in to defend me. (For less than careful
readers, this is not a letter about
grandmothers. It is about civil liber
ties.)

I really like newspapers. I read
them, write for them, and even use
them to wrap fish.
The Daily is one newspaper that I
like a 10t... most of the time.
In the past two weeks, though, let
ters on this page of the Daily have
suggested that I have been "smuggly
scoffing" although I am at the same
time in a "perpetual state of
slumber," somehow completing the
wrong graduate program.
Since it will likely be some time
before my grandmothers send letters
to the Daily attesting to my good
qualities, let me respond by stating
that the first two charges are entirely
untrue. Furthermore, it is only when I
am seated in class that I appear to be a
state of perpetual slumber.
I would not have learned these
juicy tidbits about myseff had I not
written a letter to the editor two
weeks ago about civil liberties. (The
story is not without a touch of irony.)
I was concerned that the police
were stopping black students on
campus. I worried that their rights
were being violated and that rela
tions between blacks and whites on
this campus were being strained.
I was glad to see that Daily re
sponded to this concern with an ex
cellent front page feature last Thurs
day, "Black men — rapist's other vic
tims."
I also wrote to express my curiosity
about police actions on campus. It
had occured to me that the police
were more visible on campus. I fre
quently hear their sirens, which sug
gests to me that they are often stop
ping people. Yet, there is only an oc
casional story in the Daily about an
arrest on campus.
It seemed to me that there were
more police than before and that
they were more active, but I really
didn't know what they were doing
aside from stopping more black stu
dents. I had hoped that by writing to
the Daily, the police might respond
or the Daily might write a story about
this issue.
I have a great deal of respect and
confidence in the police, but I also
like to know what they are doing.
Part of this stems from my interest in
ancient history — the United States in
the early 70s. A few weeks ago, for
example, I read in the Wall Street

Journal that the FBI had been spying
on women's rights groups and black
students at 15 lowa colleges between
1957 and 1979. It wasn't until 1982 that
we found this out thanks to a re
porter who happened to make a
Freedom of Information Act request.
We know now that this sort of
thing went on at a number of col
leges outside of the hotbeds of radi
calism in lowa. In fact, in 1971, police
broke into the offices of the Daily to
search through the paper's files. This
isn't really ancient history at all.
Ronald Reagan was governor of Cali
fornia then.
When I hear the sirens around
campus at night, this is what I think
about.
I would feel much more com
fortable if I knew exactly what the po
lice were doing, but I don't. Neither
does this newspaper. Police don't
break into the Daily's offices any
more, but they don't answer very
many questions either. They're not
very accountable.
