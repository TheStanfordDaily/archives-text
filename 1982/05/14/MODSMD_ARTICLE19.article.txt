## Freedman deserves tenure 
### 
We were very much interested to read the comments of University officials
cited in the article on tenure at Stanford, (Daily, May 4). As graduate students
in history, our future professional prospects depend on the quality of the
education we receive here and on the reputation of the history department
faculty for scholarly excellence. We are, therefore, deeply troubled by the re
cent decision to deny Asst. Prof. Estelle Freedman tenure at this university.
In the article, University spokespersons stressed that the quality of teaching
and student evaluations of performance are important in determining quali
fications for promotion to tenure at Stanford. Freedman's teaching eval
uations are consistently outstanding, and students sent many letters cor
roborating this before Freedman's department review.
The University has also recognized her contributions to teaching and
education at Stanford by awarding her the Dean's Award for Distinguished
Teaching in 1978 and the Dinkelspiel Award for Outstanding Service to Un
dergraduate Education in 1981.
Because so many undergraduate and graduate students feel that Freed
man s teaching is truly outstanding, following the March decision, many stu
dents met with the associate dean of the School of Humanities and Sciences to
egress their concern in this matter. Students also expressed deep concern
that their comments and the student evaluations were not given sufficient
weight in the tenure decision.
University officials also stressed the importance of scholarship. Reviews of
Freedman s first book. Their Sisters Keepers, have been highly favorable, and
a reviewer in the prestigious Reviews in American History wrote that the book
should be the standard work on the subject for years to come."
As futuie scholars in the historical profession, we feel that Freedman's
award-winning first book is an outstanding contribution in the field of wom
en s history. In our opinion and the opinion of many scholars across the coun
try, Freedman is clearly one of the top four or five scholars in her field. The
research for Freedman s second book promises to be a ground-breaking
study on the subject of gender and deviance in the 20th century. The project
was recently awarded a full-year grant by the National Endowment for the Hu
manities to ensure its early completion.
University officials also emphasize the importance of outside letters for
evaluating scholarship. In response to the decision to deny Freedman tenure,
more than 100 scholars, colleagues and students from Inside and outside
Stanford have written letters attesting to Freedman's strength as both a schol
ar and teacher. These letters, along with the reaffirmation of the history de
partment's support for her promotion, are presently before the Committee
on Appointments and Promotions for reconsideration.
In our opinion, Freedman's record as a teacher and scholar here far sur
passes any reasonable criteria for promotion at this institution. As graduate
students who are deeply concerned about the quality of education at Stan
ford and the future of our profession, we hope theUniversity will stand by the
principles it professes and reverse the earlier decision regarding Freedman's
tenure. • « °
