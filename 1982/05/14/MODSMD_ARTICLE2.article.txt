# Univ. treatment of lab animals draws attention

### Jeff Biddulph 
The treatment of 500 to 600 dogs
and about 150 cats presently held by
the Department of Lab Animal Medi
cine (DLAM) here for research is at
the center of a growing conflict over
proper laboratory animal care.
The progress of a bHI (State Senate
Bill 1438) which would prohibit
pounds from selling stray animals - 1
mostly dogs and cats â€” to research
facilities has centered attention on
how animals are handled in surgery
and caging here. The University
bought 587 dogs and 32 cats for ap
proximately $10 each from pounds
last year.
University officials say that one of
DLAM's major responsibilities is to
protect the health and safety of
animals used in research. They main
tain that the existence of the Admin
istrative Panel on Laboratory Animal
Care (APLAC), a 12-member panel
which assists DLAM in monitoring

the rare of the animals, assures the
minimization of animal mistreat
ment. They also point to the Animal
Welfare Act, which mandates period
ic, unannounced inspections by the
U.S. Department of Agriculture
(USDA) of animal caging, as ensuring
that the animals are appropriately
taken care of before they are ex
perimented on.
Critics of University policy such as
Lise Giraud, librarian and director of
the Palo Alto Humane Society, cite
government reports by those inspec
tors as evidence of abuse. They also
say that much of the surgery per
formed on the animals is unnecessary
and that almost all of it is cruel.
Giraud said she has obtained re
ports filed by USDA inspectors which
list a variety of offenses in the caging
of the animals, as well as descriptions
of surgeries. She showed the Daily
one report dated June 11,1981 which
described monkeys located in cages

where they could not stand upright.
There were no apparent injuries to
the monkeys, but the inspector rec
ommended that they be moved im
mediately. On this particular report,
the inspector noted that many of the
recommendations he had made at
his last inspection had been carried
out.
Giraud also has shown the Daily
what appear to be protocols sub
mitted before surgery on the
animals. Veterinarians must submit a
protocol to DLAM before they can
perform any sort of research surgery.
DLAM refuses surgery rights very
rarely, according to Carolyn Reed,
associate director of the veterinarian
division of DLAM and an ex officio
member of APLAC.
The protocols reported surgeries
where "puppy dogs are exposed to
cold temperatures and lack of ox
ygen. Heart defects are also created
to produce a chronic lack of oxygen.

Reponses to these stresses are ob
served."
One report said that "brains of cats
are injected with penicillin causing
brain damage. Abnormal electrical
discharges (epilepsy) result and are
studied."
University officials claim that all of
these experiments are necessary and
that they contribute to research in
these areas. They call people like
