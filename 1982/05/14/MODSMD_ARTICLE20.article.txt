## Arizona helps Cardinal clinch playoff berth 
### Adam Berns 
The Stanford baseball team
clinched a playoff berth late last
night without even stepping in
a baseball diamond. Arizona
State gave the Cardinal some
help by defeating Arizona 4-2,
thus assuring Stanford of a sec
ond place finish in the South
ern Division of the Pac-10 re
gardless of how it fairs against
UC-Berkeley this weekend.
With last night's loss, Arizo
na's conference record
dropped to 14-13 compared
with the Cardinal's 17-10 con
ference mark. Although
mathematically Arizona could
still compile the same con
ference record as Stanford, the
Cardinal would still qualify for
the playoffs because it took
four-of-six games from Arizo
na in head-to-head competi
tion this year.
Stanford will host the Pac-10
Northern Division winner —
either Oregon State or Wash
ington State — in a best of
three series at Sunken
Diamond next Tuesday,
Wednesday and Thursday.
Cardinal coach Mark Mar
quess, contacted at his home
late last night, was obviously
excited upon hearing his team
had definitely clinched a
playoff berth.
"I feel real good," Marquess
said. "The team came back
from some bad times and

showed a lot of character. We
came back home and re
established ourselves. I think
the three big wins against USC
were the key."
Although Stanford already
has clinched its playoff berth,
Marquess does not feel that his
team will have any motiva
tional problems against the
Bears and he is relieved that he
will have a chance to rest his
top pitchers for next week.
"I think our kids will play
hard against Cal," Marquess
commented. "It will be good
for us. It has been a week since
we have played an actual game.
"As far as our pitching goes,
it is a big advantage. It allows us
to save our pitchers (Brian)
Mignano, (Brian) Myers and
(David) Harris for next week.
"This weekend, I'm planning
on starting Mignano on Friday
and working him two or three
innings. Myers will start on Sat
urday and will work two or
threeinnningwith Harris going
two or three on Sunday. The
rest of our staff will pitch the
remainder of the games."
The Cardinals were play UC-
Berkeley 2:30 p.m. today in
Berkeley. Stanford returns to
Sunken Diamond tomorrow
to host the Bears in a 1 p.m.
contest and then returns to
Berkeley to finish the series 1
p.m. Sunday. Although Stan

ford already has second place
clinched, the Bears should still
provide stiff competition.
"Cal had its problems on a
recent Arizona road trip, much
the way we did, but I'm sure it's
anxious to prove something
this weekend," Marquess said.
"There are some dangerous
hitters in their lineup, and they
can be particularly tough in
Berkeley. I'm sure they'll make
us earn it."
The Bears will send south
paws Bryan Price (6-7,4.44 ERA)
and Nick Esposito (5-4, 4.15),
and righthander Brad Reiches
(2-4, 5.24) against the Cardinal.
Cardinal Cutouts
Stanford enters this week
end's contests with its top field
ing percentage in 15 years. The
Cardinal's current .968 mark
equals the record set in 1967 —
the year that Stanford took
third in the College World
Series. The team was led that
year by All-America first
baseman Marquess — now the
team's head coach.
Cardinal left fielder Mike
Dotterer has played particular
ly well in the past few baseball
games. He has hit safely in his
last five straight games and 21
of his last 22. In the last 19
games, he's posted a .419 bat
ting average with three home
runs and seven doubles.

"I think our kids will play
hard against Cal," Marquess
commented. "It will be good
for us. It has been a week since
we have played an actual game.
"As far as our pitching goes,
it is a big advantage. It allows us
to save our pitchers (Brian)
Mignano, (Brian) Myers and
(David) Harris for next week.
"This weekend, I'm planning
on starting Mignano on Friday
and working him two or three
innings. Myers will start on Sat
urday and will work two or
threeinnningwith Harris going
two or three on Sunday. The
rest of our staff will pitch the
remainder of the games."
The Cardinals were play UC-
Berkeley 2:30 p.m. today in
Berkeley. Stanford returns to
Sunken Diamond tomorrow
to host the Bears in a 1 p.m.
contest and then returns to
Berkeley to finish the series 1
p.m. Sunday. Although Stan

ford already has second place
clinched, the Bears should still
provide stiff competition.
"Cal had its problems on a
recent Arizona road trip, much
the way we did, but I'm sure it's
anxious to prove something
this weekend," Marquess said.
"There are some dangerous
hitters in their lineup, and they
can be particularly tough in
Berkeley. I'm sure they'll make
us earn it."
The Bears will send south
paws Bryan Price (6-7,4.44 ERA)
and Nick Esposito (5-4, 4.15),
and righthander Brad Reiches
(2-4, 5.24) against the Cardinal.
Cardinal Cutouts
Stanford enters this week
end's contests with its top field
ing percentage in 15 years. The
Cardinal's current .968 mark
equals the record set in 1967 —
the year that Stanford took
third in the College World
Series. The team was led that
year by All-America first
baseman Marquess — now the
team's head coach.
Cardinal left fielder Mike
Dotterer has played particular
ly well in the past few baseball
games. He has hit safely in his
last five straight games and 21
of his last 22. In the last 19
games, he's posted a .419 bat
ting average with three home
runs and seven doubles.


PLAYOFF BOUND — The Stanford baseball team
clinched a playoff spot against the Pac-10 Northern
Division winner with Arizona State's 6-4 victory over Ari-

Artie Streiber/Daily
zona last night. Before the team looks ahead too much, it
must still contend with UC-Berkeley this weekend.
