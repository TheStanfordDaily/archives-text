# NCAA women's tourney starts Sunday
## Top-seeded Stanford: a final look 
### Sid Spaeth 
Before Stanford crushed No.
2 UCLA 8-1 in women's tennis
last Saturday concluding their
regular season with a perfect
16-0 record and an indoor
championship, the team relax
ed to luau music from Chuck
Taylor Grove and rallied
against baseball players who
used their hands to return the
ball.
Now Stanford goes into the
NCAA Team Championships
Sunday as the No. 1 seed ahead
of UCLA, USC and Trinity with
the same relaxed attitude.
Both coach Frank Brennan
and the players are a little ner
vous, but they are going to play
in their characteristically loose
fashion.

"We're in the driver's seat."
Brennan said. "We have the
best team and the best line-up
in the country. As long as we
play our own game of tennis
and not worry about the other
teams, we'll be 0.K."
Stanford's line-up:
Alycia Moulton — No. 1 sin
gles — A three-time All-Ameri
ca who has twice taken second
in the individual singles tour
nament. Moulton, senior co
captain, relies on an over
powering serve-and-volley at
tack. Moulton, 12-2 this season
and who sometimes has con
centration problems and
"tends to let things get a little

too close, but I am a good pres
sure player," will be one of the
favorites for the individualtitle.
Elise Burgin — No. 2 singles
— Sophomore Burgin is rated
asthe No. 1 singles player in the
nation with a 10-1 dual mark.
Brennan feels he could play
Burgin, Moulton or No. 3 Kate
Gompert interchangeably in
the No. 1 singles spot, but
elects to go with Moulton's ex
perience. A left-hander,
Burgin is not overpowering,
but possesses an arsenal of

shots and mixes topspin and
slice backhands to keep oppo
nents honest.
Kate Gompert — No. 3 sin
gles — Gompert, 11-1, would
be undefeated if not for a de
fault against Pepperdine be
cause of a sprained ankle.
Probably will play the key role
for Stanford in the team com
petition.
"Kate definitely stands out in
our line-up," Brennan said.
"All the good teams have two
top players who could trade off
at No. 1 — we have three. She is
so good, she really stands out at
that point in our line-up."
Gompert, a left-handed
freshman, plays a patient
baseline game and has a
ferocious "killer instinct."
Brennan said, "Kate will beat
you 6-0, 6-0 time after time af
ter time until you give up."
Linda Gates — No. 4 singles

— Gates, another freshman,
has a 10-1 record and is proba
bly the strongest player on the
team. Is 3-0 against teammates
Burgin and Moulton. Plays an
agressive serve-and-volley
game.
Brennan feels that Gates
could play No. 1 singles at

many schools.
Michelle Weiss — No. 5 singles
— Weiss is undefeated at the
No. 5 position — her only loss
coming at No. 4 against USC.
Alternated with Caryn
Copeland for the fifth spot ear
ly in the year, but affixed
herself there by going un
defeated. Plays agressively, but

mainly in the backcourt with
lacing ground strokes.
Caryn Copeland — No. 6 sin
gles — Copeland, junior co

captain and All-America last
year, relies on a serve-and-vol
ley attack. Closed out the sea
son with the best tennis of the
year — "I like the heat" — win
ning her last three matches
convincingly. Brennan calls her
"probably the best doubles
player on the team."
Moulton-Copeland — No. 1
doubles — Defending national
champion doubles team had a
slow start, but rebounded to
the peak of their game. "Caryn
and I are playing better now

than we did at the end of last
season which says a lot,"
Moulton said. They play a pow
erful attack game that gives
them control of the net.
Brennan said, "I think it's a
big indication of how far they
have come along this season
when they beat (Lynn) Lewis
and (Heather) Ludloff (UCLA's
No. 1 doubles team) 6-1, 6-3
Saturday. Earlier this season,
they got beat 6-1,6-2."
Burgin-Gates — No. 2
doubles — Consistently pow
erful doubles team that played
in the No. 1 spot while
Moulton and Copeland were
slumping. 10-2 this season,
have played the most pressure
matches of all the Cardinal
teams.
Gompert-Weiss — No. 3
doubles — At 8-1, have easily
had the most succesful year of
all Stanford teams, but sat out

several matches as Gompert re
covered from her ankle sprain.
Round out what Brennan calls
"a great group of doubles
teams."
Can this team win their first
title since 1978?
"I don't know what a cham
pionship team looks like,"
Brennan answered, "but I
know what this team looks like.
Our top eight players can all
beat each other and our top 12
players could all play at other
schools. That is what keeps us
sharp — we have so much com
petition.
"They are the hardest team I
have ever had to coach.
They're highly-motivated and
highly-talented. They are a lot
like artists — a little tem-

peramental and fiery. You
should see them before
matches. They get all buggy
and can't wait to get out there.
There may be a lot of competi
tion between them — you
should see the intensity during
intra-team matches, but that's
because they all hate to lose
and love to win.
"You show me a team of 12
girls that always get along and
never have differences be
tween themselves and I'll show
you a group of nice girls that
never win."
"That's not for me. I hate to
lose and I love to win."

should see the intensity during
intra-team matches, but that's
because they all hate to lose
and love to win.
"You show me a team of 12
girls that always get along and
never have differences be
tween themselves and I'll show
you a group of nice girls that
never win."
"That's not for me. I hate to
lose and I love to win."

Before Stanford crushed No.
2 UCLA 8-1 in women's tennis
last Saturday concluding their
regular season with a perfect
16-0 record and an indoor
championship, the team relax
ed to luau music from Chuck
Taylor Grove and rallied
against baseball players who
used their hands to return the
ball.
Now Stanford goes into the
NCAA Team Championships
Sunday as the No. 1 seed ahead
of UCLA, USC and Trinity with
the same relaxed attitude.
Both coach Frank Brennan
and the players are a little ner
vous, but they are going to play
in their characteristically loose
fashion.

"We're in the driver's seat."
Brennan said. "We have the
best team and the best line-up
in the country. As long as we
play our own game of tennis
and not worry about the other
teams, we'll be 0.K."
Stanford's line-up:
Alycia Moulton — No. 1 sin
gles — A three-time All-Ameri
ca who has twice taken second
in the individual singles tour
nament. Moulton, senior co
captain, relies on an over
powering serve-and-volley at
tack. Moulton, 12-2 this season
and who sometimes has con
centration problems and
"tends to let things get a little

too close, but I am a good pres
sure player," will be one of the
favorites for the individualtitle.
Elise Burgin — No. 2 singles
— Sophomore Burgin is rated
asthe No. 1 singles player in the
nation with a 10-1 dual mark.
Brennan feels he could play
Burgin, Moulton or No. 3 Kate
Gompert interchangeably in
the No. 1 singles spot, but
elects to go with Moulton's ex
perience. A left-hander,
Burgin is not overpowering,
but possesses an arsenal of

shots and mixes topspin and
slice backhands to keep oppo
nents honest.
Kate Gompert — No. 3 sin
gles — Gompert, 11-1, would
be undefeated if not for a de
fault against Pepperdine be
cause of a sprained ankle.
Probably will play the key role
for Stanford in the team com
petition.
"Kate definitely stands out in
our line-up," Brennan said.
"All the good teams have two
top players who could trade off
at No. 1 — we have three. She is
so good, she really stands out at
that point in our line-up."
Gompert, a left-handed
freshman, plays a patient
baseline game and has a
ferocious "killer instinct."
Brennan said, "Kate will beat
you 6-0, 6-0 time after time af
ter time until you give up."
Linda Gates — No. 4 singles

— Gates, another freshman,
has a 10-1 record and is proba
bly the strongest player on the
team. Is 3-0 against teammates
Burgin and Moulton. Plays an
agressive serve-and-volley
game.
Brennan feels that Gates
could play No. 1 singles at

many schools.
Michelle Weiss — No. 5 singles
— Weiss is undefeated at the
No. 5 position — her only loss
coming at No. 4 against USC.
Alternated with Caryn
Copeland for the fifth spot ear
ly in the year, but affixed
herself there by going un
defeated. Plays agressively, but

mainly in the backcourt with
lacing ground strokes.
Caryn Copeland — No. 6 sin
gles — Copeland, junior co

captain and All-America last
year, relies on a serve-and-vol
ley attack. Closed out the sea
son with the best tennis of the
year — "I like the heat" — win
ning her last three matches
convincingly. Brennan calls her
"probably the best doubles
player on the team."
Moulton-Copeland — No. 1
doubles — Defending national
champion doubles team had a
slow start, but rebounded to
the peak of their game. "Caryn
and I are playing better now

than we did at the end of last
season which says a lot,"
Moulton said. They play a pow
erful attack game that gives
them control of the net.
Brennan said, "I think it's a
big indication of how far they
have come along this season
when they beat (Lynn) Lewis
and (Heather) Ludloff (UCLA's
No. 1 doubles team) 6-1, 6-3
Saturday. Earlier this season,
they got beat 6-1,6-2."
Burgin-Gates — No. 2
doubles — Consistently pow
erful doubles team that played
in the No. 1 spot while
Moulton and Copeland were
slumping. 10-2 this season,
have played the most pressure
matches of all the Cardinal
teams.
Gompert-Weiss — No. 3
doubles — At 8-1, have easily
had the most succesful year of
all Stanford teams, but sat out

several matches as Gompert re
covered from her ankle sprain.
Round out what Brennan calls
"a great group of doubles
teams."
Can this team win their first
title since 1978?
"I don't know what a cham
pionship team looks like,"
Brennan answered, "but I
know what this team looks like.
Our top eight players can all
beat each other and our top 12
players could all play at other
schools. That is what keeps us
sharp — we have so much com
petition.
"They are the hardest team I
have ever had to coach.
They're highly-motivated and
highly-talented. They are a lot
like artists — a little tem-

peramental and fiery. You
should see them before
matches. They get all buggy
and can't wait to get out there.
There may be a lot of competi
tion between them — you
should see the intensity during
intra-team matches, but that's
because they all hate to lose
and love to win.
"You show me a team of 12
girls that always get along and
