## Venturing into the City? Why not make it a dinner affair? Rain, thunder, lightning, dancing, drinks and dinner flow exotically at Fairmont's Tonga Room

Our assignment was to in
vestigate the new "early-bird"
dinner at the Fairmont's Tonga
Room — a fixed-menu budget
dinner offered between 5-7
p.m. Ready to sample this thrif
ty fare, we set out for Nob Hill.
Upon entering the restau
rant, we were bombared with
South Seas decor to rival Dis
neyland's famed Jungle Ride.
Our first instinct was to dodge
the hourly artificial monsoon,
resplendent with booming
thunder, flashes of lightning
and rain falling from the ceil
ing. The path to our table was
illuminated by thatched bam
boo huts and tiki gods, and we
could not help but notice on
our way that much of the res
taurant was decorated with the
relics of old ships, and that the
dance floor was actually the
deck of an old ship.
Our table was perched on
the edge of the nearly-Olym
pic-sized pool, garnished with
ferns, mossy rocks and flowers,
which dominates the restau
rant. After the waiter placed
our napkins in our laps, we
were pleased to note that the
small boat in the corner of the
pool was to be of some use — a
three-piece Polynesian band
clambered inside and struck up

the familiar tune of "Boogie
Nights." The boat was let out so
that it could drift lazily around
the pool.

waiter had to prod us several
times before we remembered
what we were there for. We
first ordered from a large selec
tion of rum drinks. We decided
on a Scorpion and a Peach Dai
quiri. Our waiter then in
formed us that there were free
hors d'oeuvres available next
to the bar. We went there and
filled our plates with won tons,
pot-stickers, meatballs and lit
tle drumsticks. By the time we
got to our table, the drinks had

arrived. A fragrant gardenia
was floating on top of the rath
er sizeable Scorpion, and both
of the drinks were delicious.
Our appetizers were good, but
only the pot-stickers were

worth a second round.
The "early-bird" menu of
fers three choices, priced at
$6.50, $8, and $9. We chose the
$8 menu which consisted of
Won Ton soup, Mushroom
Chicken, Sweet and Sour Pork,
rice and dessert. We were very
impressed with the Won Ton
soup, and the rest of the dinner
was good but not outstanding.
For dessert we were present
ed with what we supposed to

be a Polynesian delicacy — a
pineapple sherbert liberally
doused with creme de menthe.
Draw your own conclusions. At
the end of the meal, we
pounced on our fortune
cookies with expectant glee,
only to find that they both con
tained the same fortune.
As our plates were cleared by
a waiter resembling an Asian
Elvis Costello, and the band
belted out in succession, "Satin
Doll," "Chariots of Fire," and
"Just the Way You Are," we
surveyed the Tonga Room
clientele. An uncomfortable
prom couple sipped cokes at
the table next to us on one side,
while on the other side a
tableful of boisterous busi
nessmen hailing from New
Mexico persistently offered to
buy us drinks because we
"smelled nice."
Although the "early-bird"
dinner was inexpensive and
entertaining, we would proba
bly recommend the Tonga
Room more as a fun place to
stop for drinks and hors
d'oeuvres before or after a big
night in the City. Of course
there remains to be in
vestigated the considerably
more expensive but extensive
regular menu which is likely to
be very good.

tion of rum drinks. We decided
on a Scorpion and a Peach Dai
quiri. Our waiter then in
formed us that there were free
hors d'oeuvres available next
to the bar. We went there and
filled our plates with won tons,
pot-stickers, meatballs and lit
tle drumsticks. By the time we
got to our table, the drinks had

arrived. A fragrant gardenia
was floating on top of the rath
er sizeable Scorpion, and both
of the drinks were delicious.
Our appetizers were good, but
only the pot-stickers were

worth a second round.
The "early-bird" menu of
fers three choices, priced at
$6.50, $8, and $9. We chose the
$8 menu which consisted of
Won Ton soup, Mushroom
Chicken, Sweet and Sour Pork,
rice and dessert. We were very
impressed with the Won Ton
soup, and the rest of the dinner
was good but not outstanding.
For dessert we were present
ed with what we supposed to

be a Polynesian delicacy — a
pineapple sherbert liberally
doused with creme de menthe.
Draw your own conclusions. At
the end of the meal, we
pounced on our fortune
cookies with expectant glee,
only to find that they both con
tained the same fortune.
As our plates were cleared by
a waiter resembling an Asian
Elvis Costello, and the band
belted out in succession, "Satin
Doll," "Chariots of Fire," and
"Just the Way You Are," we
surveyed the Tonga Room
clientele. An uncomfortable
prom couple sipped cokes at
the table next to us on one side,
while on the other side a
tableful of boisterous busi
nessmen hailing from New
Mexico persistently offered to
buy us drinks because we
"smelled nice."
Although the "early-bird"
dinner was inexpensive and
entertaining, we would proba
bly recommend the Tonga
Room more as a fun place to
stop for drinks and hors
d'oeuvres before or after a big
night in the City. Of course
there remains to be in
vestigated the considerably
more expensive but extensive
regular menu which is likely to
be very good.
