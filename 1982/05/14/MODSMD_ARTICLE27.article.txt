# Paprika, paprika and uh... just a little bit more paprika

Paprikas Fono
900 North Point
San Francisco
Lakes of paprika, mountains of paprika, a
vast rolling terrain of the fine, red dust — is
not the first sight that greets you at Paprikas
Fono, a Hungarian restaurant at Ghirardelli
Square in the City. All the same, there is a lot
of paprika about...
The grinning headwaiter escorted us to our
table. There was a celler of sweet paprika in
the center and he scurried to plunk down a
giant size carton beside its brother.
The style was San Francisco-Hungarian
primitive. We were sitting under stained
wood beams, painted gaily with flowers and
birds, and a-dangle with grape ivy and Indian
corn. There was a mural behind us of peasants
at play, surmounted with a motto in Hungar
ian. There was also a splendid view out across
the Bay — but to get one of those window
seats can be a difficult task.
Ws were served bowls of Gulyas (pro
nounced Goulash): a beef and potato broth.
It was good and meaty, obviously made with
rich stock. It was rusty with paprika. Of
course.
With it we ate Langos: a sort of fried bread,
which we rubbed with garlic and dipped into
sour cream and chopped scallions. Uh huh. I
thought perhaps it could have done with
more zest, so I flirted delicately with the
sweet paprika. My companion had a mean
ingful relationship with the strong stuff.
On tothe main courses. I had Veal Paprikas:
diced veal in — you guessed it — paprika
spiced sauce. This was an unfair battle. Veal is
far too gullible a meat to be treated in so
cavalier a fashion, and it was overwhelmed by
the sauce. With it was served Galuska: an un
remarkable variant on the standard Austro-
Hungarian egg noodle.
My companion chose Mother's Palacsintas
instead, an altogether more lady-like dish.
There were two crepes: one enfolding veal in

a delicate cream and mushroom sauce; the
other a souffle of asparagus. I abandoned my
veal and started nibbling absentmindedly
from one end of my companion's portion
while she showered the other end with
paprika, and tucked into that. She won.
While waiting for the desserts, we sipped
our wines. My companion had a California
Zinfandel, but I felt it my duty as a reviewer to
undergo ritual Balkanization, so I opted for
Tokaji Aszu.
As Tokajis go, it was a little short on tart
ness. It was sweet and muscatel flavored —
and as Tokajis go, it went.
For dessert, my companion had an Amaret
to ice cream: "Made here at Paprikas," it said
on the menu, in suspiciously inverted com
mas. It tasted thoroughly of almonds, and was
very creamy. It didn't seem very Hungarian
though — I wondered musingly if we were
supposed to sprinkle it with paprika.
I had Sweet Chees Palacsintas: a sort of
blintz filled with cheese and raisins and
topped with sour cream. It had just the right
amount of lemon to zing it up without over
powering it. This time it was my companion's
turn to start forking off one end of my por
tion.
A cup of boring coffee ... a bill for about
$20 apiece . .. And that was it.
We patted out stomachs appreciatively and
sized up our fellow diners. They seemed a
world-weary lot. One gentlemen was ex
plaining to his friend how to get somewhere
in London underground and somebody else
was comparing hotels in Tokyo.
"When I was crossing the Himalayas by
camel ..." I stage whispered to my compa
nion. Nobody turned their head.
This is a fine venue for the more discerning
and extroverted Stanford student to display
his/her savoir faire. Learn how to pronounce
Hungarian before you set out, and impress
your friends.
