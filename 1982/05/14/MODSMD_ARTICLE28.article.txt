Fred Astaire and Judy Garland
star In this tune-heavy, plot-light
collection of Irving Berlin songs.
He's a dancer who needs a new
partner; she's a singer who needs
a big break. They meet and, of
course, fall in love. Along the
way, they get to sing and/or
dance to some great stuff, includ
ing We're a Couple of Swells (a
funny hobo number) Steppin'
Out with My Baby (Astaire in —
surprise! — top hat and tails) and,
of course, Easter Parade (trivia of
the month: when Berlin wrote
what would ultimately become
one of his most famous songs, it
was called Smile and Show Your
Dimple. Understandably, it went
nowhere until he changed the
lyrics a few decades later). Peter
Lawford and Ann Miller are also
featured; Charles Walters

True Confessions ★★★
New Varsity, Palo Alto
John Gregory Dunne and Joan
Didion adapted Dunne's novel,
which has its roots in the urban
melodrama that came out of Hol
lywood in the '30s and '40s. Like
the book, the movie lacks focus;
the murder mystery is carelessly
plotted, the wrap-up is disap
pointing, and the relationship be
tween the two brothers, Tommy
and Desmond Spellacy (a cop and
a priest) is never moved into the
foreground. The director, Ulu
Grosbard, doesn't have a very
good film sense, but he does have
a gift for working with actors, and
all the performances — especially
those of Robert Duvall, Robert
De Niro and Charles Durning —
are so good that the movie may
bring you to tears, despite its
weaknesses.

John Belushi and Dan Aykroyd
star in a tiresome film version of
the Thomas Berger novel, a
bewildering mix of suburban
Kafka and slapstick silliness. Larry
Gelbart, who wrote the script,
must have thought he was writing
a black comedy about a middle
class schlemiel (Belushi) whose
quiet, dead end lane is invaded
by a pair of unrestrainable luna
tics (Aykroyd and Kathy Moriar

suffers are more aggravating than
horrific. Director John G.

The characters' names are the

landscape looks familiar, and the
storyline runs more or less the
same, but the soul of the work is
gone. The ultimate responsibility
for this film's failure rests with di
rector Roman Polanski. Unable
to render any real, cinematic in
terpretation of the novel, he con

tents himself with dramatizing its
"big moments." What he forgot
to do, or what he was afraid to at
tempt, was to offer any reason
(Geoffrey Unsworth's polished
"epic" photography isn't
enough) for seeing the movie
rather than staying home and re
reading the book.
Tess' centerpiece is Natassia
Kinski. Looking at her, one can
almost believe that she could,
without in the least intending to,
drive men to do terrible deeds.
But her performance is weak and
shapeless, and, underneath her
much-touted Cornish accent, lies
another one that sounds as if it
drifted in off the banks of the

Cinderella
New Varsity, Palo Alto
Left alone to be a servant in her

Cinderella is ill treated by her
wicked stepmother and two ugly

her fairy godmother, Cinderella
manages to find happiness and
live happily ever after.
Cinderella, as brought to life
by Walt Disney, is filled with rich

there still may be "prince charm

David Lean directed this epic
retelling of the story of T.E. Law

great Englishman-in-the-desert,
carrying a British sensibility about
the proper order of things out
among the dunes. O'Toole's
great feat is to somehow avoid
being swallowed up by a screen
ful of sand. He and Lean achieve
this by making Lawrence a hu

O'Toole projects a fascinating
mixture of enormous ego and de
bilitating insecurity. The cast also

small, funny essay on the horrors

New Varsity, Palo Alto
Bernard (Gerard Depardieu)

ex-lovers, both now married,
who resume their former passion
when fate moves Mathiide into a
house next door to Bernard's.
This variation on Noel Coward's
Private Lives has an extra comic
romantic kicker — these two are
so completely engrossed in their
desire that they destroy them
selves with it — and it could have
been a first-rate movie, but the
dialogue is frustratingly earth
bound and the direction rarely
moves beyond banality. The best
thing about the movie is Fanny
Ardant, whose unusual looks
hold the camera, as does the in
tensity of her acting, which is full
of high spots and yet never quite
clinches — it's more the promise
of a wonderful performance.

The characters' names are the
same as in the Hardy novel, the
landscape looks familiar, and the
storyline runs more or less the
same, but the soul of the work is
gone. The ultimate responsibility
for this film's failure rests with di
rector Roman Polanski. Unable
to render any real, cinematic in
terpretation of the novel, he con

tents himself with dramatizing its
"big moments." What he forgot
to do, or what he was afraid to at
tempt, was to offer any reason
(Geoffrey Unsworth's polished
"epic" photography isn't
enough) for seeing the movie
rather than staying home and re
reading the book.
Tess' centerpiece is Natassia
Kinski. Looking at her, one can
almost believe that she could,
without in the least intending to,
drive men to do terrible deeds.
But her performance is weak and
shapeless, and, underneath her

another one that sounds as if it

a priest) is never moved into the
foreground. The director, Ulu
Grosbard, doesn't have a very
good film sense, but he does have
a gift for working with actors, and
all the performances — especially
those of Robert Duvall, Robert
De Niro and Charles Durning —
are so good that the movie may
bring you to tears, despite its
weaknesses.

New Varsity, Palo Alto
John Belushi and Dan Aykroyd
star in a tiresome film version of
the Thomas Berger novel, a
bewildering mix of suburban
Kafka and slapstick silliness. Larry
Gelbart, who wrote the script,
must have thought he was writing
a black comedy about a middle
class schlemiel (Belushi) whose
quiet, dead end lane is invaded
by a pair of unrestrainable luna
tics (Aykroyd and Kathy Moriar
ty), but the indignities Belushi
suffers are more aggravating than
horrific. Director John G.
Avildsen's notion of style seems
to be to keep everyone bottled
up — the worst possible ap
proach to this kind of material.
Triple-billed Saturday with
Modern Problems and Cad
dyshack.

On Golden Pond ★
Park Theater, Menlo Park
The two central characters are
a retired professor approaching
his 80th birthday (Henry Fonda,
who manages to retain his digni
ty) and his wife, who is 10 years his
junior. He is ornery and foxy; she
is affectionate and sage. This is
the kind of movie in which loons
and sunsets and trout and Jane
Fonda's backflip are used as
emblems of survival and longev
ity and marital bliss and familial
reconciliation. To be avoided at
all costs.

Tess ★
Fox, Redwood City
The characters' names are the
same as in the Hardy novel, the
landscape looks familiar, and the
storyline runs more or less the
same, but the soul of the work is
gone. The ultimate responsibility
for this film's failure rests with di
rector Roman Polanski. Unable
to render any real, cinematic in
terpretation of the novel, he con

tents himself with dramatizing its
"big moments." What he forgot
to do, or what he was afraid to at
tempt, was to offer any reason
(Geoffrey Unsworth's polished
"epic" photography isn't
enough) for seeing the movie
rather than staying home and re
reading the book.
Tess' centerpiece is Natassia
Kinski. Looking at her, one can
almost believe that she could,
without in the least intending to,
drive men to do terrible deeds.
But her performance is weak and
shapeless, and, underneath her
much-touted Cornish accent, lies
another one that sounds as if it
drifted in off the banks of the
Rhine.
Plays tomorrow night with
Women in Love.

Missing ★★★
Palo Alto Square
Costa-Gavras' political
melodrama take place in Chile
during the 1973 coup, but it
seems to be set in hell. The film,
made with an open leftist bias, is a
stunning demonstration of what
it is like to be in a country in a
state of seige, and as the wife of
the missing American, Sissy
Spacek does her best work in
years. However, there is a second
plot — the politicization of her
father-in-law, dreadfully played
by Jack Lemmon — that nearly
wrecks the movie.

Cinderella
New Varsity, Palo Alto
Left alone to be a servant in her
own home after her father dies,
Cinderella is ill treated by her
wicked stepmother and two ugly
stepsisters. Yet, with the help of
her fairy godmother, Cinderella
manages to find happiness and
live happily ever after.
Cinderella, as brought to life
by Walt Disney, is filled with rich
colors, life-like characters, and
charming mice and birds who
come to Cinderella's aid. Cin
derella will make you believe that
there still may be "prince charm
ings" in the world.
Plays Sunday with The Seventh
Voyage of Sinbad.

Lawrence of Arabia
Tonight, Cubberley
David Lean directed this epic
retelling of the story of T.E. Law
rence. Peter O'Toole makes a
great Englishman-in-the-desert,
carrying a British sensibility about
the proper order of things out
among the dunes. O'Toole's
great feat is to somehow avoid
being swallowed up by a screen
ful of sand. He and Lean achieve
this by making Lawrence a hu
man cyclone: he makes it all re
volve around his personality.
O'Toole projects a fascinating
mixture of enormous ego and de
bilitating insecurity. The cast also
includes Alec Guiness and Omar
Sharif, but it's O'Toole's show all
the way.

Monday, Kresge
Groucho plays Jeffrey T.
Spaulding in this Marx brothers
farce. It is one of the earliest —
only The Cocoanuls predates it —
and derived from a stage play by
George S. Kaufman and Morrie
Ryskind. In other words, it isn't
one of their most inspired vehi
cles, But of course it must be
seen. With songs by Bert Kalmar
and Harry Ruby ("Hooray for
Captain Spaulding" and "Why
Am I So Romantic?"); featuring
Lillian Roth and the in
dispensable Margaret Dumont.
Victor Heerman directed.

Das Boot ★★★Vi
Bijou, Palo Alto
A solidly crafted movie by Ger
man director Wolfgang Peterson,
distinguished by other World
War II U-boat pictures by its per
spective: almost the entire film is
shot within the submarine, so we
experience the attacks of the the
British vessels as the crew of the
boat does. The picture is also a
small, funny essay on the horrors
of intimate communal living, but
when it veers off into character
detail or observations of conflict
between humanitarian and polit
ical ideals, it becomes a little pre
tentious. The downer of an end
ing is a cheat.

The Woman Next Door
New Varsity, Palo Alto
Bernard (Gerard Depardieu)
and Mathiide (Fanny Ardant) are
ex-lovers, both now married,
who resume their former passion
when fate moves Mathiide into a
house next door to Bernard's.
This variation on Noel Coward's
Private Lives has an extra comic
romantic kicker — these two are
so completely engrossed in their
desire that they destroy them
selves with it — and it could have
been a first-rate movie, but the
dialogue is frustratingly earth
bound and the direction rarely
moves beyond banality. The best
thing about the movie is Fanny
Ardant, whose unusual looks
hold the camera, as does the in
tensity of her acting, which is full
of high spots and yet never quite
clinches — it's more the promise
of a wonderful performance.
Pays next Tuesday and
Wednesday wit Truffaut's Stolen
Kisses.
