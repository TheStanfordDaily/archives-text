## Minus spectacle, Reeves delivers a powerful 'Lear' 
### Martin Esslin King Lear Stanford Drama Dept. 30 April 1982 
It is one of the most frequently repeated
cliches of theatrical discourse that
Shakespeare's King Lear is, however great a
play it may be, unactable.
Alas, experience tends to confirm that old
standby often enough. Only rarely does one
come across a really first-rate performance
of the play. Its very grandeur and violence of
feeling tempts directors and actors, ranting
and roaring, into a paroxysm of spectacle,
sound and fury.
And yet, as Geoffrey Reeves' memorable
production proves here, at heart this is a
chamber play, an exploration of the
archetypal tensions and cosmic conflicts
within the framework of two families — a
father and three daughters; another father
and two sons. Shakespeare's own theatre
was an intimate space, the spectators were
only too close to the action, whole armies
could be represented by a few men and the
power of the verse was greater than any
artificially roaring storm or thunderclap.
I What Reeves, one of England's best young
Shakespearean directors (currently at Stan
ford as a visiting professor), has done, above
all, is to present this tremendous play with
the utmost clarity; to very judiciously cut
without injuring the basic fabric of its struc
ture all the more lucidly. For example, in the
opening scene of the division of the king
dom, Lear is in the center, the two elder
daughters downstage right and left, Cordelia
farther downstage centre. And in the final
image: the dead bodies of the four are laid
out in exactly the same pattern.
There are many other instances that could
be cited for the way in which clear, gimmick
free blocking clarifies the structure of events
arid illuminates the action.

And, more remarkable and even more
welcome still: Shakespeare's verse is here
spoken with clear articulation and so in
telligently that its full force comes home to
us. That sounds simple enough; but in fact
represents an astonishing achievement. Out
of dozens and dozens of Shakespeare per
formances I have seen very few of them
could be credited with achieving this feat.
Shakespeare tends to be mouthed,
screamed, and rushed through and very
rarely seems to have been understood by the
unfortunate actors who seem to be hurrying
through their lines in order to put them be
hind them as quickly as possible.
That here, in a student performance, such
clarity and control of phrasing could be
achieved must be ascribed to the skill of the
director, and, as well, the loving care of the
actors.
The most outstanding example for the way
Reeves achieves this effect is the famous
storm scene, usually ranted and roared
against a offstage panoply of loud tem
pestuous noises. Here, in the true spirit of
the Elizabethan theatre, we are left to infer
the roaring of the storm from the description
of its fury in the verse. What is more, Lear
almost whispers the lines.
This not only underlines his exhaustion
and his speechlessness (literal and figurative)
at the enormity of his misfortunes; it also
enables us to hear the glorious poetry of the
scene in its full tragic splendour.
A good director, is, above all, character
ized by his skill in casting, and here Reeves
has done wonders.
He found a graduate student who could
act the role of an ancient king — or perhaps
the decided to direct Lear because he had
met just such a student. Rush Rehm has not
only the bear and the gravity of a potential
Lear, he also brings to the part a genuine act
ing talent and a deep understanding of the
nature of tragedy. His Lear is willful and ov

erbearing at the start and beautifully evolves
into anger, astonishment, madness and a
newly found serene humanity. This is a
memorable performance and eclipses, as far
as I personally am concerned, half a dozen
Lears by seasoned professional heavyweight
actors.
Fritz Brun gives an equally interesting ac
count of Gloucester, Lear's counterpart in
the world of long-suffering parents: he is
more serene than Rehm and also less pas
sionately aware, but the pliability of his char
acter, a naivety born from sensuality, is beau
tifully suggested by Brun whose slight

Danish accent gives his lines a peculiarly en
gaging softness, and renders all the more
horrible his sufferings after he is blinded.
Kevin Reidy is suitably villainous as the un
natural Edmund, having a nice line in
diabolic smirks. Laurence Maslon as Edgar,
the banished son who turns into Lear's coun
terpart of dispossessed unhoused humanity,
gives a memorable performance: his mad
ness has the surrealist extravagance of an un
hinged imagination that turns the character
into another Hamlet. This is a very difficult
part, brilliantly realized.
In the trio of Lear's daughters Patricia Ryan

and Debra Skriba not only look spectacularly
attractive but are able to suggest human con
flicts and frustrations behind the sheer
hardness of heart. Drue Bralove doubles as
Cordelia and the Fool; this is a good solution
to the problem of these characters who nev
er appear together and may well, in
Shakespeare's time, also have been played
by the same actor. But in that theatre it was a
boy, for whom, perhaps, it was easjer to turn
into a girl (as all girls were conventionally
acted by boys) than it is for a present-day girl
to turn into a boy.
Paradoxically it seems to me that here the
Fool comes over better than the daughter:
Cordelia is a difficult part; she has to be at
tractive and sympathetic even though she
says such hard things to her father at the
start. Here I f?lt a certain aloofness from the
overwhelming emotional development that
Cordelia undergoes in the course of the play
(admittedly, she has very few lines at her dis
posal).
Stephen Weeks gives a fine performance
in the part of Kent; it is a measure of his suc
cess that we believe Kent's age as well as his
sturdiness.
There are some weaker spots in the cast;
but only in one or two instances does the rec
itation of lines in a monotous and un
modulated voice momentarily arise.
The simplicity of the setting — greenish
drapes all round — and the subtlety of the
lighting (by John Rathman) greatly enhances
the effect of the production, proving once
more that Shakespeare's theatre is best with
a minimum of scenery and scenic effects.
"The play's the thing!"- and here we get the
play, pure and unadulterated, without gim
micks and over-intellectualizing "co ncepts"
and by that very token made manifest as a su
preme philosophical and metaphysical
statement about the human condition as
well as a gripping and deeply moving human
story.

Rush Rehm as Lear and Fritz Brun as Gloucester
It is one of the most frequently repeated
cliches of theatrical discourse that
Shakespeare's King Lear is, however great a
play it may be, unactable.
Alas, experience tends to confirm that old
standby often enough. Only rarely does one
come across a really first-rate performance
of the play. Its very grandeur and violence of
feeling tempts directors and actors, ranting
and roaring, into a paroxysm of spectacle,
sound and fury.
And yet, as Geoffrey Reeves' memorable
production proves here, at heart this is a
chamber play, an exploration of the
archetypal tensions and cosmic conflicts
within the framework of two families — a
father and three daughters; another father
and two sons. Shakespeare's own theatre
was an intimate space, the spectators were
only too close to the action, whole armies
could be represented by a few men and the
power of the verse was greater than any
artificially roaring storm or thunderclap.
I What Reeves, one of England's best young
Shakespearean directors (currently at Stan
ford as a visiting professor), has done, above
all, is to present this tremendous play with
the utmost clarity; to very judiciously cut
without injuring the basic fabric of its struc
ture all the more lucidly. For example, in the
opening scene of the division of the king
dom, Lear is in the center, the two elder
daughters downstage right and left, Cordelia
farther downstage centre. And in the final
image: the dead bodies of the four are laid
out in exactly the same pattern.
There are many other instances that could
be cited for the way in which clear, gimmick
free blocking clarifies the structure of events
arid illuminates the action.

And, more remarkable and even more
welcome still: Shakespeare's verse is here
spoken with clear articulation and so in
telligently that its full force comes home to
us. That sounds simple enough; but in fact
represents an astonishing achievement. Out
of dozens and dozens of Shakespeare per
formances I have seen very few of them
could be credited with achieving this feat.
Shakespeare tends to be mouthed,
screamed, and rushed through and very
rarely seems to have been understood by the
unfortunate actors who seem to be hurrying
through their lines in order to put them be
hind them as quickly as possible.
That here, in a student performance, such
clarity and control of phrasing could be
achieved must be ascribed to the skill of the
director, and, as well, the loving care of the
actors.
The most outstanding example for the way
Reeves achieves this effect is the famous
storm scene, usually ranted and roared
against a offstage panoply of loud tem
pestuous noises. Here, in the true spirit of
the Elizabethan theatre, we are left to infer
the roaring of the storm from the description
of its fury in the verse. What is more, Lear
almost whispers the lines.
This not only underlines his exhaustion
and his speechlessness (literal and figurative)
at the enormity of his misfortunes; it also
enables us to hear the glorious poetry of the
scene in its full tragic splendour.
A good director, is, above all, character
ized by his skill in casting, and here Reeves
has done wonders.
He found a graduate student who could
act the role of an ancient king — or perhaps
the decided to direct Lear because he had
met just such a student. Rush Rehm has not
only the bear and the gravity of a potential
Lear, he also brings to the part a genuine act
ing talent and a deep understanding of the
nature of tragedy. His Lear is willful and ov

erbearing at the start and beautifully evolves
into anger, astonishment, madness and a
newly found serene humanity. This is a
memorable performance and eclipses, as far
as I personally am concerned, half a dozen
Lears by seasoned professional heavyweight
actors.
Fritz Brun gives an equally interesting ac
count of Gloucester, Lear's counterpart in
the world of long-suffering parents: he is
more serene than Rehm and also less pas
sionately aware, but the pliability of his char
acter, a naivety born from sensuality, is beau
tifully suggested by Brun whose slight

Danish accent gives his lines a peculiarly en
gaging softness, and renders all the more
horrible his sufferings after he is blinded.
Kevin Reidy is suitably villainous as the un
natural Edmund, having a nice line in
diabolic smirks. Laurence Maslon as Edgar,
the banished son who turns into Lear's coun
terpart of dispossessed unhoused humanity,
gives a memorable performance: his mad
ness has the surrealist extravagance of an un
hinged imagination that turns the character
into another Hamlet. This is a very difficult
part, brilliantly realized.
In the trio of Lear's daughters Patricia Ryan

and Debra Skriba not only look spectacularly
attractive but are able to suggest human con
flicts and frustrations behind the sheer
hardness of heart. Drue Bralove doubles as
Cordelia and the Fool; this is a good solution
to the problem of these characters who nev
er appear together and may well, in
Shakespeare's time, also have been played
by the same actor. But in that theatre it was a
boy, for whom, perhaps, it was easjer to turn
into a girl (as all girls were conventionally
acted by boys) than it is for a present-day girl
to turn into a boy.
Paradoxically it seems to me that here the
Fool comes over better than the daughter:
Cordelia is a difficult part; she has to be at
tractive and sympathetic even though she
says such hard things to her father at the
start. Here I f?lt a certain aloofness from the
overwhelming emotional development that
Cordelia undergoes in the course of the play
(admittedly, she has very few lines at her dis
posal).
Stephen Weeks gives a fine performance
in the part of Kent; it is a measure of his suc
cess that we believe Kent's age as well as his
sturdiness.
