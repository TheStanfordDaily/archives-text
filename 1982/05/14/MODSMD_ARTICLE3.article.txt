# Committee's ODUS dispersal plan presented to the Faculty Senate
## 
### Jeff Biddulph 
Provost Al Hastorf formally introduced a proposal to
the Faculty Senate yesterday to disperse the present re
sponsibilities of the Dean of Undergraduate Studies to
two new administrators, and called for senators to study
the report closely before taking action on it May 27.
Under the plan, the duties of Herant Katchadourian,
dean of undergraduate studies and vice provost, will be
divided between an associate dean for undergraduate
programs and a vice provost for undergraduate educa
tion, both of which will be half-time positions. Hastorf
called for an implementation of the plan next year and
pointed out that the ad hoc committee had approved the
plan unanimously.
The changes will "reduce bureaucracy and improve
the performance" of the Office of the Dean of Under
graduate Studies (ODUS), Hastorf said.
Only two senators, Profs. Ronald Rebholz and Sanford
Dornbusch, responded to the proposal. Rebholz pro
tested any changes in academic services, such as the Aca

demic Information Center and the Learning Assistance
Center, which may be altered or absorbed by other pro
grams under the plan.
Hastorf responded that none of the alterations are
final and that the effectiveness of the programs would
not be impaired under the proposal.
Dornbusch praised the committee's efforts in for
mulating the plan. The committee spent fpur months re
viewing ODUS to decide on the proposed changes.
The senate confirmed the election of Prof. Alexander
Fetter as Chairman of next year's Faculty Senate, replac
ing Prof. David Abernathy. Serving with Fetter on the
Senate Steering Committee, which he will also chair, will
be Profs. Michael Bratman, J. Merrill Carlsmith, Carolyn
Lougee and William Northway.
The senate also heard a report on the University's li
braries and passed two Committee on Graduate Studies
reports â€” one on guidelines for the dismissal of graduate
students for academic reasons and the other on the con
tinuation of the Cancer Biology Program.
