# Local label provides home for rising new jazz stars
## 
### Ted Gioia 
Jazz on the Peninsula, like
some endangered species of
exotic bird, has seldom nested
long in one place before being
extirpated by public indif
ference. But the emergence of
Palo Alto jazz Records, a local
label with an international
scope, bodes well for the
future. Their initial batch of re
leases features a striking com
bination of established jazz fig
ures and promising young tal
ent.
Urban Dreams
Pepper Adams
Palo Alto Jazz Records
The baritone saxophone
must be the unloved child of
the reed family. In the hands of
most of its practitioners its tone
is as cumbersome as the instru
ment itself; yet its most tal
ented exponents — Harry
Carney, Gerry Mulligan —

have been soloists of the
highest rank.
Pepper Adams shows the
rare ability to combine the in
troverted melodicism of
Mulligan with the more main
stream efforts of Serge Chaloff
and Leo Parker. The result is a
solo style which is equally at
home in ballads such as
Youman's "Time on My
Hands" as in up-tempo pieces
such as Dexter Gordon's
cooker "Dexter Rides Again."
During most of the 70s
Adams was associated with the
Thad Jones/Mel Lewis big
band, and his work with that
group brought him consistent
praise from the critics but little
opportunity to solo at length.
Urban Dreams will no doubt be
greeted with delight by the
fans of Adams work in that larg
er ensemble if only for the fact
that it allows him to stretch out

in a small group setting.
The choice of Jimmy Rowles
as Adam's pianist was no doubt
a wise one. In recent years he
has participated in a number of
inspired recording sessions
featuring leading saxophonists
— Stan Getz, Al Cohn, Zoot
Sims, Lew Tabackin — and he is
no less successful in this set
ting. On many recent dates
Rowles has played with a per
cussiveness and a quirky har
monic sense reminiscent of the
late Thelonious Monk; yet with
Adams, Rowles plays more lyr
ically than he has in years. This
more subdued Rowles is a
perfect foil for the aggressive
Adams. Bassist George Mraz
and drummer Billy Hart, both
experienced jazzmen, round
out the quartet.
If s About Time
Lanny Morgan
Palo Alto Jazz Records

As a member of Super Sax —
a group which performs
elaborate arrangements of
Charlie Parker songs and solos
— Lanny Morgan has no doubt
developed an intimate ac
quaintance with the musical
twists and turns of that bebop
master. It is to his credit that
Morgan has managed to hone
his own striking style while de
voting himself so completely to
the music of Parker.
Certainly the Parker in
fluence can be seen in his
playing, but with very few ex
ceptions that can be said of vir
tually every other alto player
born after the twenties.
Morgan, like so many West
Coast saxophonists, softened
Bird's sharp attack and de
veloped a brighter and more
full-bodied tone.
Morgan's playing at times
bears an uncanny similarity to

that of Richie Cole's, both in
tone and in conception, yet
one can also detect the in
fluence of Art Pepper and Paul
Desmond. His technique is
sure and smooth, without
being obtrusive, and he ap
pears quite comfortable at
even the fastest tempos.
This is amply proved in his
rendition of Parker's rarely
played composition "Ko-Ko."
Based on the changes to the
standard "Cherokee," this
piece offers the soloist a musi
cal obstacle course which only
the hardiest will survive. The
bridge, which zips through the
circle of fifths with a passion,
has been a stumbling-block to
many aspiring boppers, yet
both Morgan and guitarist
Bruce Forman, handle it with
characteristic ease.

Terry Gibbs/Buddy DeFranco
If, as I mentioned earlier, the
baritone sax is the unloved
child of the reed instruments,
the clarinet must be the for
gotten son. Once a major solo
instrument in jazz, the clarinet
has more recently become an
instrument many double on,
but few play exclusively. Signif
icant clarinet players of the past
few decades have most often
been musicians who have
made their reputations as sax
ophonists — one thinks of
Roland Kirk, Joseph Jarman,
Eric Dolphy, Art Pepper and
Roscoe Mitchell.
Buddy DeFranco is an excep
tion to this seemingly iron-clad
rule of modern jazz. He plays a
shimmering bebop lines on the
clarinet without the slightest
fear of appearing
anachronistic; indeed DeFran
co's approach to the clarinet is

well suited to modern jazz. His
playing has always bordered on
the baroque — in the '50s Nor
man Granz matched DeFranco
against the piano virtuoso Art
Tatum, a prospect which would
make even the most skilled
technician at least somewhat
insecure; yet DeFranco, far
from being subdued,
challenged Tatum with a dar
ing barrage of notes, riffs and
scales.
This is one of those albums
which is quite sophisticated yet
quite listenable (alas those two
qualities are often at war with
each other), and comes highly
recommended. As with the
other Palo Alto Jazz releases
this one is well-recorded and
well pressed with minimal sur
face noise. If more discs were
like this we could perhaps quit
going to clubs.

made their reputations as sax
ophonists — one thinks of
Roland Kirk, Joseph Jarman,
Eric Dolphy, Art Pepper and
Roscoe Mitchell.
Buddy DeFranco is an excep
tion to this seemingly iron-clad
rule of modern jazz. He plays a
shimmering bebop lines on the
clarinet without the slightest
fear of appearing
anachronistic; indeed DeFran
co's approach to the clarinet is

well suited to modern jazz. His
playing has always bordered on
the baroque — in the '50s Nor
man Granz matched DeFranco
against the piano virtuoso Art
Tatum, a prospect which would
make even the most skilled
technician at least somewhat
insecure; yet DeFranco, far
from being subdued,
challenged Tatum with a dar
ing barrage of notes, riffs and
scales.
This is one of those albums
which is quite sophisticated yet
quite listenable (alas those two
qualities are often at war with
each other), and comes highly
recommended. As with the
other Palo Alto Jazz releases
this one is well-recorded and
well pressed with minimal sur
face noise. If more discs were
like this we could perhaps quit
going to clubs.
Jazz on the Peninsula, like
some endangered species of
exotic bird, has seldom nested
long in one place before being
extirpated by public indif
ference. But the emergence of
Palo Alto jazz Records, a local
label with an international
scope, bodes well for the
future. Their initial batch of re
leases features a striking com
bination of established jazz fig
ures and promising young tal
ent.
Urban Dreams
Pepper Adams
Palo Alto Jazz Records
The baritone saxophone
must be the unloved child of
the reed family. In the hands of
most of its practitioners its tone
is as cumbersome as the instru
ment itself; yet its most tal
ented exponents — Harry
Carney, Gerry Mulligan —

have been soloists of the
highest rank.
Pepper Adams shows the
rare ability to combine the in
troverted melodicism of
Mulligan with the more main
stream efforts of Serge Chaloff
and Leo Parker. The result is a
solo style which is equally at
home in ballads such as
Youman's "Time on My
Hands" as in up-tempo pieces
such as Dexter Gordon's
cooker "Dexter Rides Again."
During most of the 70s
Adams was associated with the
Thad Jones/Mel Lewis big
band, and his work with that
group brought him consistent
praise from the critics but little
opportunity to solo at length.
Urban Dreams will no doubt be
greeted with delight by the
fans of Adams work in that larg
er ensemble if only for the fact
that it allows him to stretch out

in a small group setting.
The choice of Jimmy Rowles
as Adam's pianist was no doubt
a wise one. In recent years he
has participated in a number of
inspired recording sessions
featuring leading saxophonists
— Stan Getz, Al Cohn, Zoot
Sims, Lew Tabackin — and he is
no less successful in this set
ting. On many recent dates
Rowles has played with a per
cussiveness and a quirky har
monic sense reminiscent of the
late Thelonious Monk; yet with
Adams, Rowles plays more lyr
ically than he has in years. This
more subdued Rowles is a
perfect foil for the aggressive
Adams. Bassist George Mraz
and drummer Billy Hart, both
experienced jazzmen, round
out the quartet.
If s About Time
Lanny Morgan
Palo Alto Jazz Records

As a member of Super Sax —
a group which performs
elaborate arrangements of
Charlie Parker songs and solos
— Lanny Morgan has no doubt
developed an intimate ac
quaintance with the musical
twists and turns of that bebop
master. It is to his credit that
Morgan has managed to hone
his own striking style while de
voting himself so completely to
the music of Parker.
Certainly the Parker in
fluence can be seen in his
playing, but with very few ex
ceptions that can be said of vir
tually every other alto player
born after the twenties.
Morgan, like so many West
Coast saxophonists, softened
Bird's sharp attack and de
veloped a brighter and more
full-bodied tone.
Morgan's playing at times
bears an uncanny similarity to

that of Richie Cole's, both in
tone and in conception, yet
one can also detect the in
fluence of Art Pepper and Paul
Desmond. His technique is
sure and smooth, without
being obtrusive, and he ap
pears quite comfortable at
even the fastest tempos.
This is amply proved in his
rendition of Parker's rarely
played composition "Ko-Ko."
Based on the changes to the
standard "Cherokee," this
piece offers the soloist a musi
cal obstacle course which only
the hardiest will survive. The
bridge, which zips through the
circle of fifths with a passion,
has been a stumbling-block to
many aspiring boppers, yet
both Morgan and guitarist
Bruce Forman, handle it with
characteristic ease.

Terry Gibbs/Buddy DeFranco
If, as I mentioned earlier, the
baritone sax is the unloved
child of the reed instruments,
the clarinet must be the for
gotten son. Once a major solo
instrument in jazz, the clarinet
has more recently become an
instrument many double on,
but few play exclusively. Signif
icant clarinet players of the past
few decades have most often
been musicians who have
made their reputations as sax
ophonists — one thinks of
Roland Kirk, Joseph Jarman,
Eric Dolphy, Art Pepper and
Roscoe Mitchell.
