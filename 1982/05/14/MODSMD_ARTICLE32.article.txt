# An open letter to the President
## 
### 
Dear President Reagan,
We are very fortunate to have you as our great president and a leader of the Free World

We all know that freedom and democracy are priceless ideals to be preserved at all
costs and if we should ever lose them because of our carelessness or lack of vigilance
the costs and sacrifices that would be required to regain them could be staggering and
the dove of peace would also disappear from sight.
In order to achieve world peace our forefathers have endured much sacrifice in life
and treasures. Yet try as they may an effective formula for permanent peace has never
been found. Without a day passed do we not hear the "God of War" calling for
combat The awesome destructive power gf the mountains of implements of war
possessed by the so-called Great Powers threatens the lives of everyone and every
thing on this earth.
Mankind is God's only creation on this earth that is endowed with intelligence. It is
difficult to understand why they continue to kill each other. It saddens one to think
that through theagelnssnessof time man has not learned from even animals who kill
only for food and survival!
Mr. President, if your thinking is also in tune with mine, it is my hope that you'll
find it in your heart to forgive me for being so bold as to submit to you a few very
humble suggest ions for your consideration up to you for leadership since you
are the souvereign head of the richest and the most powerful nation in the world.
There is no denying that these are extraordinary times and if one is to overcome the
forces of evil in tho world without going to war extraordinary measures must be
taken. Whoever in your position of power can accomplish permanent peace for the
world shall undoubtedly be considered by history as a giant amongst leaders past and
future. For ho shall achieve that which had eluded man's supreme effort for a
thousand years.
Basically, however, there are really no insolvable conflicts between peoples and
the same can be said about nations. It is my feeling that if in our every-day life we
approach our peers with honesty and sincerity and our enemies with compassion and
humanity, there is little doubt that we can win over the most stubborn of all enemies.
There is an ancient Chinese saying that honesty and compassion can cut through
gold and shatter boulders.
I often ask myself the question why from the beginning of time brothers cracked
each other's head fighting over a piece of candy or nations cover each other's border
with corpses fighting over an intangible boundry or why man must be enemies if they
cannot be friends. The answer lies in the word "greed"!
Ilecause people in general are ignorant, stubborn, fearful of change and above all
hypocritical. They do not realize that there is only so much land in the world. Not
having learned to share, each trys to take more than his own portion constantly
bringing about war and chaos for all. While not realizing they themselves are at fault
and likeblindmnn leading the blind they search everywhere else for solutions to their
dilemma. Aimlessly they start dreaming up all kinds of "isms" of political
parties and engage in all sorts of evolutions only in getting themselves in deeper and
deeper waters Truely. a new direction must be found if we are to have a better world
to live in While there is no doubt that mankind is inflicted ith the fatal disease of
"false pride" caused by a lack of true compassion in dealing with each other and it is
not my place here to argue who is at fault or what "ism" is right or wrong. It is my
impression that a great "doctor" is called for — one that is not afraid of criticism in
administering the neoded medication.
Mr. President, there's where you come in. you must now bravely confront your
destiny to do what you have to do with compassion and wisdom! The time is ripe for
you to take the first step to save mankind from its own destruction. Every venture is of
course easier said than done, but it is nevertheless ti me to make use of your God given
talent as a great political leader and measure up to your responsibility.
Aside from the question of war and peace the world ii confronted with another
serious threat — that of overpopulation.
As if to test man's ability to survive. God in his wisdom presented us from the very
beginning with a challenge: On the one hand he saw toil that man shall constant Iv be
going through difficult struggle against the element confronting him with all sorts of
life threatening diseases such as cancer and tuberculosis (small pox alone had at one
time caused the death of over one-half of the new-born In some areas of the world):
earthquakes and typhoons that uproot his homes and fearsome animals and poison
ous snakes to cause him pain. On the other hand fie also provided man with
Intelligence to successfully combat and conquer such diseases and forces of nature.
Hut as man finds way to protect and extend life he created for himself a more
threatening sickness of "over-population."
Mr. President. I'm not certain as to your own stand on limiting the growth of the
world's population, but it is my own belief that it is something that mankind must
ernestlv practice sooner or later and that the initiation of a system of birth control
cannot be less important than legislation for old-age pensions, unemployment insur
ance. medicare or medicaide or the Red Gross organization which existence dictated
by today's needs and circumstances
If von shou Id also believe in this Mr President, it is my hope that you shall have the
courage of your conviction to take the lead in this movement. With the persuasive
power of the Presidency at vour disposal the job can indeed be done with half the
effort A true leader can not avoid the responsibility in such a worthwhile task for
there are no better ways to reach the goal of true world pence
Of course, as you cry out from the summit, there will be many people opposing you
on numerous ground The pressure will be so great that vour job as President might at
some point he threatened Vet one must not be fearful of criticism or he will only be
lust another ordinary politician intersted only in his own safety and well-being and
would not be any other in the judgement of history
If the opposition should come from varius religious circles, one should first
concentrate one's effort In winning over all the other non-religious forces, the former
shall also see the light when success is achieved What is at stake here is not only the
very survival of freedom and democracy but our existence as well.
Mr President, vour term in office offers you the greatest opportunity to accomplish
that which others in history had not been able to achieve The question It whether or
not you wi II have the courage to piece the welfare of manki nd above that of your own.

Mr. President, I'm a member of a minority group, a person of humble origin yet this
great country has given me every equal opportunity to |oin the economic life along
with all others. YetJ'm deeply concerned about the futureof this great democracy and
feel compelled to submit to you a few of my observations for your reference to theend
that it shall forever endure. In order that my views shall havea greater opportunity of
reaching you I'm prepared to have this document published in the media whatever
the cost may be as a humble gesture of appreciation to all that this country has meant
to me.
It is my feeling that a great political leader is one that has the courage to do what
must be done at all times. One who dares to take measures that at times others might
consider unusual. In this time of extreme world crisis it is the time for each leader to
surface.
To the end that the world's problems may be quickly resolved may I respectfully
suggest that the following declaration to the world be made by you as President of tho
United States and leader of the Free World.
"As President of the United States. I charge you, the Legislative bodies of
this great country that if my policies as stated in The Universal Brotherhood
Declaration are not acted upon, and as expeditiously as possible and to the
letter of that, aforementioned, Declaration, then within six months of this
date I shall resign my office as your chief executive officer.
To act at once, or to suffer the loss of hope. As President of the United
States. I charge world leaders with thesame responsibility which I have my
own constituency."
A Universal Brotherhood Declaration:
To my dear fellowmen and leaders of the world:
As we are all born to be brothers on this earth there are no fundamental
conflict between individuals or should there be any animosities among
nations. Yet there is no denying that we are living in a world full of hatred
and mistrust which threatens its very existence. Weas human beings are not
born with the concept of "isms" or political divisions or any sense of
hostility toward each other. It is important that we recognizesuch devisive
concepts are today threatening our lives and resolve to do a way with them so
as to treat everybody else as our fellowman with universal love.
From this day on we shall resolve to promote friendship between peoples
in a spirit of cooperation, with compassion we must overlook once and for
all any animosity and misunderstanding that might exist amongst us To
gether we shall begin a new beginning and thus opening up a new great
highway toward a world of paradise in which everyone shall enjoy a life of
abundance.
To this end I'm proposing that the population of the world be reduced in
half so thatthero will be no shortage of material means of livelihood for all.
This will be carried out according to a definite schedule to lie set by experts.
with the root of conflict having thus been eliminated there will be no
justification for nations to attack each other for territorial gains.
It may be a little too optimistic to expect the achievement of such a goal in
our lifetime, but surely within the coming generation. In my capacity as
President of the United States I wish to solemnly declare at this time that if
any nation should from this day on initiateany reckless action against others
before total peace is achieved it will mean the end for us all!
— end of declaration —
Mr. President. America is the leader of the Free World and must not be timid in taking
bold action and shoulder heavy responsibilities After the above declaration is made
the 11 S. should immediately take measures to Implement the policy as stated without
waiting for actions of others There is nothing in this world we cannot do if we
approach our enemies with compassion and our mission with sincerity.
When permanent peace shall thus have been obtained we can turn our full atten
tion to the task of building a world in which all inhabitants shall enjoy a life free of
wants and the U.S. shall be setting an example to the rest of the world Peace and
freedom will then shine brightly like the sun in the skv and mankind s dream for
permanent peace will be a reality for as long as the universe shall exist
Before closing. I would like to touch upon the question of capital punishment.
There is all over our nation in recent years a great debate on whether or not
murderers should be put to death if found guilty by the court of law. I would like to
suggest an idea that might satisfy all sides. My idea is toadd on to our annual Income
tax torm the following entry:
If you should unfortunately be murdered in the coming year and your murderer
caught and found guilty, would you be willing to forgive him for taking your life and
allow hlmtolive.markoneofthefollowing: ve»D noQ Bv this act. each person is
given the opportunitv to express his or preference on the subject. If vou should mark
yet to the question it indicates that you have personally decided to pardon the one
who has commited the crime against you. If the "no should be your choosing it
would mean that the murderer should be made to pav with his own life. In either case
vour wish shall have been expressed by the signature at the end of your lax form
Since government is the servant of the people it would seem appropriate that it be
asked to do thit on your behalf. All It requires is the addition of a single line on the
return which takes up less than an Inch of space and it would allow each person to
express his preference according to his own conscience Furthermore since the one
who is harmed is the principal figure in the affair he alone should have the right to
decide whether to ask for retribution.
In the case of a minor in school who has no income to report such a question could
be inserted on his sth grade entrance application and those below the 4th grade
parents should be asked to decide for thechi Id No third person should have a nything
to say about it.
I can think of no better way to handle this question and put a stop to a II the fruit less
arguments on the issue
Sincerel} yours.
