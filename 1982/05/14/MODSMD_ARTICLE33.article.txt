Elections
Somehow, both candidates for editor
emerged from the traditional roasting ses
sion relatively unscathed. Now it comes
down to the wire. Voting for the two can
didates, Richard Klingler and Jiri will
be held this Monday, April 17, from ICÂ»a.m.
to 10 p.m. in the editors' office. A voting list
is posted on the door of that office; check to
see if you're eligible to vote. Both can
didates have asked that anyone who has
questions about their platforms or goals for
the Daily contact them at the Daily or at
home. Remember: voting is this Monday!
Edit board
OK. It's late in the quarter; you're burned
out; you've got a big weekend ahead of you
and the last thing you want to do is spend
another couple hours in the Daily haggling
over planks in prospective editorials. Un
derstandable.
But we can't stop now. Today's regular
edit board meeting at 12:30 won't last long.
Promise. But there are some important
things on the agenda that need to be dis
cussed. So come early and we'll get through
in a hurry.
