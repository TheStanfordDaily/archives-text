"Out?"
"Out."
"Out?"
"Well, I rather liked that
one myself."
"Okay, it stays."
And so went the judging
of the Seventh Annual Stan
ford Daily Photography
Contest. A panel of three
eye-sharp judges
scrutinized some 83 black
and white prints for this
year's competition. Chuck
Painter, News and Publica
tions photographer; Tim
Davis, a local free-lancer;
and Tony Grant, a graduate
student of photography in
the Art Department picked
first, second, third and hon
orable mention photo
graphs in each of three cat
egories. Winners will re
ceive cash prizes of $25, $15
and $10.
Because of its subjective
nature, judging a photogra
phy contest can turn out to
be an event in which the
judges surprise each other
with their choices and
runners up and losers won
der how tneir print was any
worse than those chosen.
Simply put, those hon
orable mention and un
mentioned photographs
are not "worse" than those
that took first or second
place. In the opinion of the
judges, those prints did not
have the same qualities of
composition, tone, form or
On the cover —

subject matter that the win
ners did.
Almost everything has
been photographed once
and therefore the judges
were looking for a new way
of seeing an 'old' thing, a
fresh perspective. They also
looked for the photograph
that told a story, or had
some unique quality about
it.
"The humor and intensity
of the print really put it out
in front of the others," one
judge remarked about
Chuck Kruger's first place
winner in the "Social Com
ment" category.
The winning entry by
John Nordell in the "Peo
ple" category was noted for
its "honesty and integrity"
and also for its "spontaneity
and balance."
Alan Hill's cover photo of
the Old Chemistry Building
was chosen for its "strong
graphic composition" and
its "repetition of forms that
gives the viewer a per
spective that leads you to
the door at the end of the
hallway."
Much like picking the
best apple pie at the county
fair, pickingthe winnersofa
photography contest is an
"it's up to the judges" affair.
This year's judges did an ex
cellent job with what
Painter believed to be an
overall better group of

photographs than last year's
entries. So don't feel dis
couraged if your print does
not appear in this year's
supplement, it could win
another photography con
test or who knows, maybe
next year...
