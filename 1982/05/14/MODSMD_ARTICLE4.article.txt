Reagan wary of no first use pledge
Washington — President Ronald Reagan said yesterday that he be
lieves the Russian people and their leaders understand the importance
of avoiding war, but he declared that "no useful purpose" would be
served by a U.S. pledge against first use of nuclear weapons.
Critics of U.S. defense strategy have called upon the Reagan adminis
tration to pledge that the United States would not be the first to launch
nuclear weapons in a war with the Soviet Union. But Reagan said U.S.-
made nuclear weapons in Europe stand as an indispensible deterrent to
balance the "massive buildup" of conventional arms by the Soviet
Union and its Warsaw Pact allies in Eastern Europe.
The president, holding his 10th formal news conference at the White
House since assuming office, said he hopes the United States and the
Soviet Union will begin negotiations on his proposal for nuclear arms
reductions by the end of June. He said he had already instructed Secre
tary of State Alexander Haig to begin preliminary sessions with the Sovi
ets on his strategic arms reduction proposal, and has written a letter on
the matter to Soviet President Leonid Brezhnev.
Reagan, who has indicated that he would like to hold a summit meet
ing with Brezhnev this year, said he hopes to receive a reply from the
Soviet leader soon.
When asked why he was willing to set
aside the seven years of negotiations that
had led to the SALT II treaty, Reagan re
iterated his opposition to the treaty, which
he had opposed during his campaign for the
presidency.
Former Secretary of State Henry Kissinger
and several other prominent figures, includ
ing Democratic congressional leaders, re
cently have called for a new move to seek
Senate ratification of the treaty. However,
Reagan has continued his opposition and
Haig has said the treaty is dead.
The reporter who questioned Reagan
about the SALT II treaty referred to it as "a
bird in the hand," but the president de
clared, "This bird isn't a very friendly bird."
He pointed out that the treaty had not been
ratified by the Senate in 1980, when it was
controlled by the Democrats.
And, he charged that SALT II would allow
the Soviet Union to double its nuclear
capability.
Negotiations still hopeful
United Nations — British Ambassador Sir
Anthony Persons reported yesterday that
U.N. talks seeking a cease-fire in the British-
Argentine conflict over the Falklands are
"still in business" as Buenos Aires eased a
key demand on negotiations.
He made his statement as United Nations
Secretary-General Javier Perez de Cuellar
continued his efforts for an agreement be
tween the two countries and later said he
remained "hopeful."
Parsons has represented Britain during
five days of peace discussions here, and he
appeared buoyant as he entered U.N. head
quarters foran hour-long session with Perez
de Cuellar.
There were fears here Wednesday night
that Perez de Cuellar's peace efforts would
fail, as did earlier ones by Secretary of State
Alexander Haig.
The toughness of an Argentine statement
Tuesday on the issue of sovereignty over the
Falkland Islands — called the Malvinas by
Argentina — fed those fears. It looked then
that the Buenos Aires military government
was holding to its earlier demand that any
agreement on the islands' future guarantee
in advance "total and full" Argentine sov
ereignty.
However, by yesterday British diplomats
saw a "change of attitude" in the declara
tion by Argentina's President Leopoldo
Galtieri yesterday that a guarantee of Ar
gentine sovereignty is not a precondition
for peace talks.
Enrique Ros, Argentine deputy foreign
minister, almost smiled as he emerged at
5:45 p.m. from his appointment with the
secretary-general. He stopped at the micro
phone now permanently planted near the
door of the heudquarters building and vol
unteered that he would return today. Nor
mally he declines to comment to reporters.
Committee passes budget
Washington — The Democratic-con
trolled House Budget Committee approved
yesterday a massive deficit-reduction plan
that rejects Social Security cuts endorsed by
President Ronald Reagan and proposes
huge tax increases and defense cutbacks
strongly opposed by the president.
The House Democratic leadership plan,
adopted by a party-line vote of 17-12, also

calls for substantially smaller slashes in
domestic programs than the Reagan
backed budget passed by the Senate Budget
Committee's Republican majority last
week.
Both plans, though sharply diifferent,
would narrow projected federal deficits by
more than $400 billion over the next three
years, a Brobdingnagian task deemed essen
tial to bringing down interest rates and re
viving the economy.
The Senate opens debate on its plan to
day, but primary attention will be focused
on scrambles to form winning coalitions in
the House before debate begins there next
Friday.
The Republican minority in the House is
expected to offer a substitute to the Demo
cratic budget, and the outcome will hinge
on how many "801 l Weevil" conservative
Democrats and "Gypsy Moth" liberal Re
publicans bolt ranks to support the other
party's budget proposal.
This year, with the economy in deep re
cession, Gypsy Moths are clearly anxious
about their reelection chances in politically
marginal Northeast and Midwest districts.
They strongly oppose further deep cuts in
domestic programs, and are particularly up
set by the proposal to cut $40 billion in the
Social Security program supported by Rea
gan and Senate Budget Committee Re
publicans.
As for the 801 l Weevils, while such leaders
as Rep. Phil Gramm (D-Tex.) already are
drafting their own alternatives to the House
committee's budget, the mood of some
conservative Democrats has changed no
ticeably.
The House Budget Committee's plan in
cluded none of the $40 billion in Social Se
curity cuts called for in the Senate commit
tee proposal. In their proposal, Democrats
scuttled a Republican effort to defuse
criticism of the proposed cuts by removing
the Social Security trust fund from the main
federal budget. Democrats contend that
Republicans are seeking to balance the
budget at the expense of Social Security
pensioners.
Brits threaten invasion soon
London — British Foreign Secretary Fran
cis Pym warned Parliament yesterday that
"military pressure is necessary to bring Ar
gentina to negotiate seriously."
His warning to the House of Commons in
creased widespread speculation that a Brit
ish invasion of the Falkland Islands may be
only days away — unless there is some dip
lomatic breakthrough in the South Atlantic
crisis at the United Nations.
"We continue to tighten the military
screw." He said the British blockade is
"making it increasingly hard and costly for
Argentina to sustain her occupation of the
Falkland Islands."
Diplomatic sources say that the British are
running out of hope that the Argentine jun
ta will respond positively to the diplomatic
efforts at the United Nations.
Pym's warning was backed up yesterday
by Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher, who,
in a response to a question asto whetherthe
government might be preparinga diplomat
ic "sellout" to Argentina, told Parliament:
"We are working for a peaceful solution
— not a peaceful sellout."
The toughening attitude of the govern
ment came as more details were released

yesterday by the Defense Ministry of the
aerial action over the British task force on
Wednesday.
The Defense Ministrysaidanother Argen
tine Skyhawk fighter-bomber had crashed
into the South Atlantic Wednesday while
trying to take evasive action during an at
tack on the British task force.
A Defense Ministry spokesman said that
12 U.S.-made Argentine Skyhawks had ap
proached the fleet from the mainland.
After the first Argentine Skyhawk wave
was repulsed, the Defense Ministry said, a
second wave attacked the force and one jet
inflicted minor damage on a British ship.
The Defense Ministry would not say how
badly the ship was damaged or whether it
was hit with missiles, bombs or other weap
ons. But it did say that there were no British
casualties.
Poles stage general strike
Warsaw, Poland — A symbolic general
strike declared by Poland's suspended Soli
darity trade union met with partial success
yesterday as workers, students and some
motorists joined in the first nationally coor
dinated protest against martial law.
Official and unofficial reports indicated
that strikes of up to 15 minutes had taken
place at many major industrial plants
around the country including the Lenin
shipyard in Gdansk where Solidarity was
born in August 1980. Students at several uni
versities interrupted lectures and staged si
lent demonstrations on campuses.
The strike was called by a four-man pro
visional coordinating commission of under
ground Solidarity leaders to mark the pass
ing of five months since the imposition of
martial law on December 13 last year. Soli
darity leaflets and bulletins had appealed to
workers to stop work for 15 minutes at noon
and for drivers to sound their horns and
stop their cars.
After 20 minutes, the demonstrators were
dispersed peacefully by reinforcements of
riot police who moved in with glass helmuts
down and truncheons out. Elsewhere in
Warsaw, and in other Polish cities, there was
little response to Solidarity's call for traffic
to halt.
Government spokesmen promptly
labelled the protests"a failure" and claimed
that work continued normally almost ev
erywhere in the country.
While reliable information from other
towns was difficult to gather, reports in
dicated that the protests were more wide
spread than at any time since last Decem
ber.
A confidential circular letter signed by
Deputy Prime Minister Andrzej Jedynak in
structed government ministries and factory
directors to strictly enforce the martial-law
decrees. Workers were told that they risked
immediate dismissal and up to five years'
imprisonment for organizing or partici
pating in a strike.
U.S. expels Polish diplomats
Washington — The United States an
nounced the expulsion of two Polish
diplomats and suspended a joint U.S-Polish
scientific research project yesterday in re
taliation against espionage charges by Po
land against two Americans in Warsaw. Of
ficials here called the Polish charges
groundless.
Monday, the Polish government accused

the two American diplomats of "promoting
destabilizing activity" when they visited a
Polish scientist recently released by martial
law authorities. The two, John Zerolis, a sci
entific attache, and J. Daniel Howard, a cul
tural affairs officer, were given until Friday
to leave the country.
The U.S. expulsion of Andrzej Koroscik, a
science attache, and Mariusz Wozniak, a
political officer, is a standard retaliatory ac
tion and was expected. Unexpected was the
announcement that travel by participants in
a scientific exchange program would be
suspended until further notice.
State Department spokesman Alan Rom
berg, who announced both actions, ac
cused Polish authorities of allegations in the
controlled press "that visiting American sci
entists are engaged in espionage activities."
He added: "The untrue accusations threat
en the continuation of the jointly financed
program of scientific research in Poland."
The Poles had charged the two Americans
with receiving from the scientist, who was
arrested during the first days of martial law
there and recently released, "materials
damaging to the interests of the state."
The two Polish diplomats and are being
given until midnight Monday to leave the
country.
Airfares rise, stocks fall

showing yesterday and closed mostly lower.
Airline issues were the bright spot, advan
cing in heavy volume following news that
Braniff International suspended operations
and filed for reorganization under
bankruptcy laws.
The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials,
off fractionally for much of the session,
tumbled in late trading and closed down
6.66, to 859.11.
