Reagan wary of no first use pledge
Washington — President Ronald Reagan said yesterday that he be
lieves the Russian people and their leaders understand the importance
of avoiding war, but he declared that "no useful purpose" would be
served by a U.S. pledge against first use of nuclear weapons.
Critics of U.S. defense strategy have called upon the Reagan adminis
tration to pledge that the United States would not be the first to launch
nuclear weapons in a war with the Soviet Union. But Reagan said U.S.-
made nuclear weapons in Europe stand as an indispensible deterrent to
balance the "massive buildup" of conventional arms by the Soviet
Union and its Warsaw Pact allies in Eastern Europe.
The president, holding his 10th formal news conference at the White
House since assuming office, said he hopes the United States and the
Soviet Union will begin negotiations on his proposal for nuclear arms
reductions by the end of June. He said he had already instructed Secre
tary of State Alexander Haig to begin preliminary sessions with the Sovi
ets on his strategic arms reduction proposal, and has written a letter on
the matter to Soviet President Leonid Brezhnev.
Reagan, who has indicated that he would like to hold a summit meet
ing with Brezhnev this year, said he hopes to receive a reply from the
Soviet leader soon.
