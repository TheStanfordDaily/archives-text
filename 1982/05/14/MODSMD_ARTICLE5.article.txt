# ODUS reorganization plan gains acceptance
## 
### Heather Millar Senior staff writer 
While on Wednesday University
faculty and staff whispered ap
prehensively about the pending an
nouncement of Provost Albert
Hastorf's recommendation to
restructure the administration of un
dergraduate education, today the
whispered rumors have changed to
open — and largely positive — con
versation.

News analysis

Yesterday, Hastorf informed the
Faculty Senate that the Office of the
Dean of Undergraduate Studies
(ODUS) will be disbanded and the
duties of Dean of Undergraduate
Studies Herant Katchadourian
divided between two new adminis
trative officers.
The decision is the result of almost
four months of research and de
liberation — conducted in strictest
confidentiality — by an ad-hoc com*
mittee composed of top University
officials. The administrators on the
committee included Hastorf,
Katchadourian, Dean of Graduate
Studies and Research Gerald
Leiberman and Norman Wessels,
dean of the School of Humanities
and Sciences (H & S).
The delegation of the dean of un
dergraduate studies' authority to two
new administrators represents a
change in a policy of centralization
established 12 years ago when the
University created the ODUS dean
ship to provide undergraduate
education with a central manager
and advocate. When the proposals
are implemented next fall, the role of
advocate and manager will be
divided between an associate dean
for undergraduate programs in
H & S, who will shoulder the bulk of
ODUS' managerial functions, and a
vice-provost for undergraduate
education responsible for advocat
ing undergraduate interests.
The fact that such a high-powered
group was making a landmark de

cision, and had the right, even
though it chose not to exercise it, to
avoid consulting anybody and
change a precedent of centralization
in undergraduate administration
with the stroke of a pen, caused un
easiness among staff members.
Though Katchadourian advised his
staff of the committee's progress,
several staff members said they felt
frustrated by the lack of voice they
had in the decision-making process.
Laura Selznick, director of the Un
dergraduate Specials program, said
yesterday,"It was something that was
totally out of my control." Rumors of
all sorts began to filter through aca
demic service offices while the com
mittee investigated ODUS.
Administrators reporting to ODUS
interviewed by the Daily during the
committee's review expressed fears
that their jobs were in jeopardy or
that the loss of ODUS' vice-provostial
aegis would make their programs
vulnerable to budget cuts. It was
feared that without ODUS, the in
terests of undergraduate education
would fare poorly, especially with
graduate student interests cham
pioned by a vice-provost and dean of
graduate studies and research.
Katchadourian, who intiated the
review when he returned from sab
batical leave in january, countered
that ODUS had fallen victim to a
"Byzantine bureaucracy" that forced
the office to manage both academic
and policy concerns. "Even though
my office functioned very well, and I
think I did a good job, there is a fun
damental structural flaw in the sys
tem," said Katchadourian. "The
mish-mash of advocacy and manage
rial functions ... get in the way of
each other."
Katchadourian added that if he
gained a measure of autonomy by
operating independently of the
i schools, he "more than paid the
> price for that independence by deal
ing with the schools as an outsider."
