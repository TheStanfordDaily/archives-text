# Library start endorses group talks
## 
### Suzanne Smith 
Library staff members interviewed
by the Daily unanimously endorsed
the current series of small-group dis
cussions — the second phase of a
large-scale evaluation of the Univer
sity's library system — as useful for in
creasing staff communication.
Staff members disagree, however,
about whether the discussions will
have any long-term effects on library
procedures, paticularly in the area of
staff-administration communica
tions.
The 10-member groups, organized
within each department, have been
meeting approximately once a week
since February to voice complaints
about library policy and to make sug
gestions for improvement. Each
group will submit a report of its sug
gestions to the library administration
by june.
Library administrators will then
present a summary of these reports
to University administrators, includ
ing Provost Al Hastorf and Assistant
Provost Wayne Price.
The discussion groups are a follow
up to a controversial survey of library
staff taken earlier this year. "The li
brary wants us in effect to reinterpret
the data (from the survey). No one
understood the results," said one
staff member.
This will be the first time that an

evaluation of the libraries by the li
brary staff itself will reach the Univer
sity administration, according to
Kathy Schweitzberger, a serials
cataloguer. "Past projects have been
strictly internal/' she said. "This re
port represents a major difference in
approach."
Schweitzberger, who has worked
with three of the groups, said, "Peo
ple have learned to express their
complaints in a positive way — and to
come up with solutions." She said
that the three groups she has worked
with are all proposing similar solu
tions.
"As there seems to be a kind of
consensus, I'm hopeful that the ad
ministration will take the proposals,"
she said.
Jim Meyers, director of Technical
Services, said he thinks the group ses

sions are "going well. People are ap
proaching them with an open mind."
One member of the technical staff
said he considers the "interactive
method" employed by the groups
excessively formal. Each group has a
leader, a recorder (secretary) and a
facilitator who acts as a mediator in
case of disputes.
"There are 324 items on the survey
to be discussed," he said. "Our
group has met for two months and
has only gotten through 11 of them."
He does concede, however, that
the groups have given staff members
a sense of solidarity. "And I realize
now how deep some people's griev
ances go. People I never thought
would complain are doing so in pre
cise and terse terms."
„ Another staff member
Agrees. "This is the first time
I've heard people speak out
freely."
Staff member Lise Giraud
was pessimisticabout the meet
ings' effectiveness, saying
there is "an underlying
cynicism about the whole
process." She noted that in
1972 a report was put out by the
staff, suggesting reforms like
pter review (evaluation by
peers as well as by supervisors),
and a librarians' assembly to
serve in an advisory capacity to
the director. She claimed that
there was no response to the
report.
David Weber, director of
University libraries, denies this.
"In fact, concepts from this re
port led very directly to dis
cussions among library direc
tors throughout the University,
which in turn fashioned a li
brary personnel program."
This program, said Weber, fol
lowed many of the report's
most important recommenda
tions.
Other staff members note
optimistically that this year's
report, unlike previous ones,
will be reviewed by the provost
and other University adminis
trators. "This time we have
pressure from outside," said
Ghaida Firestone, a library spe

cialist and a 14-year veteran of
the library system. "The Uni
versity wouldn't spend this
much money on a survey un
less they really expected
changes to take place."
The grievances being dis
cussed stem mainly from what
staff members consider ex
cessive bureaucracy.
Schweitzberger said there is
a "serious communication
problem."
"The administration puts out
so many memos that is is hard
to be selective about what to
read." Moreover, she said, the
memos are written in "bureau
cratic jargon" that is difficult to
understand.
Some staff members said
they did not express their opin
ions to administrators because
they are afraid of being pun
ished. One staff member said
she has "seen two co-workers
insulted by their department
heads. They actually had some
of their responsibilities taken
away."
Meyers admits that there is a
communication problem, but
said he is "willing and ac
cessible to talk. I have never
turned down a meeting with
any staff member, and I don't
think any other director has.
"The survey had made me
more conscious of the desire of
the staff to have my ear," said
Myers. He claims to spend 30 to
45 minutes per day talking to
staff. "There is a lot of informal

contact," he said.
But he pointed to the dif
ficulty of communicating with
a staff of over 350. "More than
100 people report to me. It
would be impossible for them
to do so in any depth."
He noted that communica
tion is a "two way street: If I say
to staff, 'my door is open,' and I
spend time with them down
stairs, and they feel they can't
come see me ... that puts me
in an awkward situation. I can't
drag them up."
Schweitzberger said "it
would be nice to have more
meetings with administrators."
She noted, however, that the
staff is asked to present agen
das for meetings, but doesn't.
"Yet they are resentful when
there are no meetings, or when
the administration decides the
agendas."
One cataloguer said she feels
communication is adequate.
"If I have a complaint I go to my
department head ... I feel no
need to involve myself with di
rectors."
Lack of decision-making
power is another common
complaint among library staff.
One staff member said that
some groups are promoting a
Japanese management theory
called Theory Z.
"We want to see group de
cision-making, where the staff
is coordinated but not con
trolled by the management,"
she said. "Workers have a lot

more pride if they're involved
in the whole product, not just
one part."
Another cataloguer claimed
that staff are "treated like chil
dren. Only certain supervisors
involve their staff. And in crisis
management, there is never
time to ask for our input."
"There are many ideas that a
bright staff would like to be
consulted about, but isn't,"
said a member of the technical
staff.
Personnel director Carolyn
Henderson disagrees. "De
cisions are not made without
input," she said, though she
does concede that "we may
not be going far enough down
the line."
"Stanford University has a hi
erarchical system. We have to
work within the system," she
said.
As an example of what she
calls the library's "democratic
facade," Giraud cites a com
mittee created a year and a half
ago to establish standards for
the cataloguing department.
According to Giraud, the com
mittee produced a report of 30
to 40 pages, "to which there
was absolutely no response."
Myers claimed, however,
that the committee's minutes
have been turned into policy,
which has not yet been pub
lished because of problems
with RUN, the library's com
puter system.
"We thought it was ir

responsible for us to set stan
dards that for the present were
impossible to adhere to be
cause of technical problems,"
Meyers said.
Weber claimed that "a great
many people do participate in
decision-making." He cited a
task force study performed last
fall, which "showed quite a
broad involvement (by staff)."
Other, lesser grievances
concern salary and promotion.
"In technical services, 40 per
cent of the staff have master's
degrees," said one member of
the technical staff, "and yet
there is little effort made by the
administration in the area of
staff development." He said
there is a two-and-a-half year
waiting list for a prerequisite
course in staff development.
"The administration trims
our jobs to keep us in the same
position," said one staff mem
ber. "There is no reclass
ification; you have to change
jobs." She said there are
"Catch-225" that prevent li
brary staff from being pro
moted.
Meyers denies these
charges. Most high-level jobs
are, he said, filled from within,
and he estimates that from 20
to 30 reclassifications are made
each year.
Schweitzberger notes that li
brary workers tend to be over
qualified, and that "it is the na
ture of the job not to advance."
Giraud extremists who have become
overzealous in their attempts to halt
experimentation on animals.
Both sides admit that the issue is
based largely on one's definition of
cruelty.
Surgery Prof James Dewson, direc
tor of DLAM, points to magazines
such as the Animal Protection In
stitute Magazine as printing mislead
ing articles about animal experimen
tation here. In the Winter, 1982 issue
of the periodical there was a picture
of a cat sitting on a brick. An accom
panying caption read: "Cat sitting on
brick in an experiment at Stanford
University, where 300 cats were kept
awake as long as possible. After 70
sleepless days and nights, this cat
went mad."
The article spurred dozens of
threatening letters to University of
ficials. Dewson replied that the pic
ture originally appeared in Life mag
azine when the experiment took
place 16 years ago. He said that the
cats were deprived solely of rapid
eye-movement sleep for either eight
or 12 hours a day. Only 10 or 20 cats
were studied, according to Dewson,
and most of the animals survived the
experiment and were placed in local
homes. He alsosaidtheexperimenta
tion has led to the most effective
known treatment in humans for en
dogenous depression.
