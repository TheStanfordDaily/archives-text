# Library start endorses group talks
## 
### Suzanne Smith 
Library staff members interviewed
by the Daily unanimously endorsed
the current series of small-group dis
cussions — the second phase of a
large-scale evaluation of the Univer
sity's library system — as useful for in
creasing staff communication.
Staff members disagree, however,
about whether the discussions will
have any long-term effects on library
procedures, paticularly in the area of
staff-administration communica
tions.
The 10-member groups, organized
within each department, have been
meeting approximately once a week
since February to voice complaints
about library policy and to make sug
gestions for improvement. Each
group will submit a report of its sug
gestions to the library administration
by june.
Library administrators will then
present a summary of these reports
to University administrators, includ
ing Provost Al Hastorf and Assistant
Provost Wayne Price.
The discussion groups are a follow
up to a controversial survey of library
staff taken earlier this year. "The li
brary wants us in effect to reinterpret
the data (from the survey). No one
understood the results," said one
staff member.
This will be the first time that an

evaluation of the libraries by the li
brary staff itself will reach the Univer
sity administration, according to
Kathy Schweitzberger, a serials
cataloguer. "Past projects have been
strictly internal/' she said. "This re
port represents a major difference in
approach."
Schweitzberger, who has worked
with three of the groups, said, "Peo
ple have learned to express their
complaints in a positive way — and to
come up with solutions." She said
that the three groups she has worked
with are all proposing similar solu
tions.
"As there seems to be a kind of
consensus, I'm hopeful that the ad
ministration will take the proposals,"
she said.
Jim Meyers, director of Technical
Services, said he thinks the group ses

sions are "going well. People are ap
proaching them with an open mind."
One member of the technical staff
said he considers the "interactive
method" employed by the groups
excessively formal. Each group has a
leader, a recorder (secretary) and a
facilitator who acts as a mediator in
case of disputes.
"There are 324 items on the survey
to be discussed," he said. "Our
group has met for two months and
has only gotten through 11 of them."
He does concede, however, that
the groups have given staff members
a sense of solidarity. "And I realize
now how deep some people's griev
ances go. People I never thought
would complain are doing so in pre
cise and terse terms."
