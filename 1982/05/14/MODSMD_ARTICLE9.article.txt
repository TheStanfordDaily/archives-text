# Carter returns to TV in new Republican ad
## 
### Newsday 
Washington — The visual
memory of Jimmy Carter is
returning to national tele
vision next week. The $1.7-
million comeback is being
brought to millions of tele
vision viewers by the Re
publican Party.
As might be expected
from such a sponsor, it is not
the kind of comeback calcu
lated to make the former
Democratic president hap
py. The Republican Con
gressional Campaign Com
mittee and the Republican
National Committee have
fashioned a 30-second com
mercial blaming Carter and
a favorite GOP target,
House Speaker Thomas
(Tip) O'Neill (D-Mass.) for
the nation's economic
woes.
"The spot is that we have a
lawyer reading to Carter
and O'Neill the Carter
legacy — inflation, un
employment, recession,"
said an official of the GOP
campaign committee, who
requested anonymity.
Carter is played by Ed
Behler, an actor from Waco,
Texas, and O'Neill is
portrayed by Edwin Steffe,

the New York actor who
achieved fame in political
circles for playing the same
part in a highly regarded
1980 GOP commercial.
"I don't think it's exactly
fair to have an actor who
looks like a former presi
dent," commented Jody
Powell, who was Carter's
White House press secre
tary. "If you did it to Ronald
Reagan, you'd have to have
an actor playing an actor
playing a president."
But the Republican
source insisted that "it's not
a nasty spot, not sneering.
The point is that you just
can't push a button and ev
erything will get well. It's to
help Republican candidates
running for the House of
Representatives."
The latest ad and a second
commercial stating that in
flation is now under control
will be running for six weeks
in 56 major media markets
throughout the country. It is
the creation of Corley &
Kay, the same New York ad
agency that produced Xerox
commercials featuring the
beatific monk.
