## Nuclear freeze problematic 
### 
The growing public awareness of
the dangers of nuclear war is one of
the most heartening political de
velopments in recent years. After two
decades of relative indifference to
the superpower nuclear arms
buildup, it is long overdue that the
American people give greater atten
tion to the possibility of controlling
nuclear weapons.
The political pressure created by
the increased public concern over
nuclear arms was undoubtedly one
of the major factors behind the Rea
gan administration's recent proposal
for Strategic Arms Reduction Talks
(START). The president's May 9
speech at Eureka College offered a
generally sound basis for nego
tiations and it was a welcome step
forward for an administration that
had shown unwarranted hostility
toward strategic arms control during
its first 16 months. For this, the nucle
ar freeze movement deserves much
of the credit.
Nevertheless, there are problems
with the nuclear freeze movement,
not the least of which is the un
fortunate tendency among some of
its members to supplant thoughtful
analysis with simple-minded emo
tionalism. More important, the nu
clear freeze proposal that is sup
ported by the movement has a
number of basic flaws.
First, a nuclear freeze would be un
verifiable. Although the California
referendum calls for a freeze that
"can be checked and verified by
both sides," this is a contradiction in
terms. There is no way to verify a ban
on nuclear weapons production;
there is also no way to verify many of
the other features of the
moratorium, short of agreeing to ex
tremely intrusive on-site inspection
procedures (which the Soviet Union,
of course, would refuse to accept).
Without adequate verification, our
confidence that the Soviets were
complying with a freeze would dete
riorate rapidly, leading to greater in
stability. Unless an arms control
agreement can be properly verified,
it clearly will not serve our national
interest.
Second, a freeze would have the
unacceptable effect of ratifying the
status quo in central Europe. The
United States would not be able to
deploy its new intermediate-range
nuclear forces, while the Soviets
would be able to keep all of theirs. A
freeze would thus give the Soviets
precisely what they want and would
undermine the U.S. negotiating posi
tion at the European arms control
talks in Geneva.
Third, a nuclear freeze would pre
clude strategic deployments that
could otherwise promote greater sta
bility. For example, a freeze would
prevent us from taking any steps to
enhance the survivability of our in
tercontinental ballistic missiles
(ICBMs), though it would do nothing
to reduce the threat posed to those
missiles by the Soviets' SS-18s.
Similarly, under a freeze we would
be unable to develop a new bomber
or to give our B-52s a stand-off
capability by equipping them with
air-launched cruise missiles. Yet

without such improvements, our
bomber force will be incapable of
penetrating Soviet air defenses by
the mid-1980s, thus rendering useless
another leg of our Triad.
Fourth, a freeze would raise fun
damental doubts about our relations
with our allies. For the past three dec
ades, American security guarantees
to NATO and Japan have been cen
tered around the U.S. nuclear de
terrent. If we were to take any actions
that would seriously jeopardize the
integrity of that deterrent, we could
no longer maintain a credible com
mitment to our allies' defense.
Along these same lines, a freeze
would magnify the importance of the
Soviet Union's conventional force
superiority. If the deterrent value of
nuclear weapons were to diminish,
the United States and its allies would
face the unenviable task of having to
deter a Soviet attack through con
ventional means alone.
This is, of course, not to suggest
that nuclear weapons can be a sub
stitute for adequate conventional
strength, or that the NATO nations
should continue to accept their
marked inferiority in conventional
forces. Rather, it is merely to point
out that until these countries exhibit
a much greater willingness to under-

There is no way to
verify a ban on
nuclear weapons
production; there is
also no way to verify
many of the other
fearures of the
moratorium.. •

lake a full-scale (end expensive) con
ventional buildup, it would be a
grave mistake for them to abandon
all reliance on nuclear deterrence.
Fifth, the suggestion that a freeze
would be simple to negotiate is pat
ently inaccurate. Even if the Soviets
did not reject the proposal out-of
hand (as, in fact, they did with a simi
lar offer in June 1979), the scope,
duration, subsequent steps and other
details of a freeze would have to be
worked out in prolonged nego
tiations. If the SALT II treaty (which,
incidentally, already includes a
freeze on levels of strategic forces) fs
any indication, the negotiations
could last for several years.
After having been led to believe
that a freeze would be a quick and
simple step, many in the public
would likely become seriously dis
illusioned if an agreement were not
reached instantly. A likely conse
quence wpuld be a return to the
apathy of the past 19 years.
Moreover, if, after extensive nego
tiations, the two sides were unable to
conclude a formal agreement, U.S.
development and production pro
grams would almost certainly have
been much more adversely affected
in the meantime than would Soviet
programs.
All of these factors argue against
the nuclear freeze proposal. It is true,
on the other hand, that the freeze
referendum will have no binding ef
fect and that it is more a healthy ex
pression of concern than a realistic
framework for policy. It is also true
that a strongly-passed referendum in
California could be of significant
benefit in encouraging the adminis

tration to take further steps in arms
control.
Still, it is problematic whether the
proponents of a freeze can make best
use of their time by working for a
measure that is so deeply flawed.
They might be far better off if they
were to support effective and veri
fiable arms control agreements that
truly benefit our security. Only
through such agreements — and
through the maintenance of a strong
deterrent — can we hope to achieve
genuine progress toward our most
basic security objective, namely, the
avoidance of nuclear war.
