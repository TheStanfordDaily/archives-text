## A
						running dialogue with Don Kennedy 
### 
Donald Kennedy was once Ameri
can college president jogging cham
pion. Do not think that I am much
impressed by that in terms of jogging,
but I think it meant a lot to Donald.
Although a very nice man and not the
competitive type, he nonetheless
took secret satisfaction in knowing
he could outrun any academician
who disputed his decisions at the
FDA. I always distrust complete
beings — those who excel in both the
corporeal and the cerebral — so one
morning early I ventured to the dish
to investigate. Not only was Kennedy
running at breakneck speed, he was
reading Kierkegaard as well.
I was washing all the dishes when
the doorbell rang. I thought it was
the front door, but seeing no one
there I went to the back. I think I con
ducted myself prudently.
Donald crossed the laces, looped
the left one and pulled both tight
against his shoe. Holding the loop
with his thumb and first finger, he
curled the middle of the right lace
around and under the loop and
pulled tight. It felt good to have his
laces pulled tight. Donald knew this
but knew he must not think about it
too much or the old feeling would
come back.
It was a fine morning as Donald ran
along the Boulevard Mayfield. The
dew was still on and the grass and
leaves glistened in the early surf, He
passed an old professor coasting on
his bicycle. It felt good to be jogging.

It felt good to be fit and brilliant.
Donald turned left onto Rue Cam
pus. There was a certain stretch of
Rue Campus between Boulevard
Mayfield and Avenue de Serra that
he did not care to run along. To drive
it was another matter but to run it
made Donald feel unpleasant. A cou
ple was jogging ahead of him. He
looked down. "Adidas. A good
brand," he thought. He tried to look
up quickly but could not. He saw
their laces undone or loosely tied.
His head started to work. The old
feeling. He knew he should be toler
ant of them and not let them bother
him but could not. The little plastic
tips clicked then rose then clicked
again on the black bike path. He
wanted to swing on one of them;
anything to stop that loosely tied at
titude and those clicking tips.
To shave, or not to shave, That is
the question: Whether 'tis nobler to
accomplish a mundane tidbit or lie
here and contemplate it for the day.
Donald crossed Avenue de Serra
and ran into the pasture on the other
side. The path rose and turned left
then right. As he climbed he passed
other joggers. "Good morning, Pres
ident Kennedy." "Good morning,"
said Donald. It felt good to be fit and
brilliant and sociable. Turning at the
dish, he looked down towards where
he had come from. The foothills,
green from the winter rains, then
Stanford and, farther out, the Bay,
were clear in the early light. As he ran

back down some cows walked in
front of him, blocking his path. "Ex
cuse me cows," said Donald. It felt
good to be fit and brilliant and so
ciable and courteous.
Blitz, the Story of a Horse is a very
sinister book if read too late in life. It
recounts the adventures of Blitz, a
firehorse, who pulls a water truck
and crew around the city putting out
fires. I had lent the book to Donald
when he asked if I had anything he
could read while jogging. Kennedy
read and reread Blitz, but I never re
alized the effect it had had on him
until he came by one afternoon while
I was shaving. I was just finishing
when the doorbell rang. "Come on
up" I shouted down the stairs. I
cleaned out the basin with warm wa
ter, filled it with cold, then rinsed my
face and toweled.
"Hello Stan."
"Hello Donald."
"Can we talk up here in the bath
room?"
"No, let's go downstairs. There are
some dishes down there. I'll wash,
you dry."
Because I had three weeks worth
of laundry to do before nightfall, I
couldn't afford to have Donald stay
very long. I had discovered this was
the perfect way of getting rid of
friends. We'd go downstairs and
wash the dishes then I'd say I have to
go upstairs and brush my teeth.
We walked into the kitchen. I

turned on the hot water tap and
squirted a thin, short line of dish
washing liquid into the spray. The
suds rose fast and stiff out of the sink.
"Those are good suds," said
Donald.
"They are good," I agreed.
I turned off the water and washed
the dishes while Donald dried.
"I want to be a fireman, Stan."
"What? And leave Stanford?"
"Yes."
"But that's silly. You have a good
life here as president. You can jog in
the morning and recombine DNA in
the afternoon."
"Nothing exciting ever happens.
Don't you ever feel your life is going
by and nothing exciting ever hap
pens?"
"Why don't you come over and
shave with me sometime?"
"I want to be a fireman."
He had a hard, intellectual stub
born streak.
I finished the last dish and pulled
the stopper from the sink. The water
curled down into the drain.
"Well I have to go upstairs and
brush my teeth."
"You have to go?"
"I really must brush them."
"I suppose I had better run. So
long, old kid!"
"So long old sport!"
