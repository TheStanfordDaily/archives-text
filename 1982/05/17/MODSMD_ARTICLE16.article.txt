## Herpes: ignoring it won't reduce the chances 
### 
Washington — There's never been
a congressional hearing on it. And
there probably won't be one until
half of Congress wakes up one morn
ing, stricken.
But in the meantime the rest of us
are suffering directly or indirectly
from genital herpes, a viral strain that
threatens to alter — or abolish — our
species forever. If we don't already
have some form of herpes, we don't
know as much about it as we should.
GERM: A 24-year-old magazine
editor fears she'll pick up a house

mate's herpes infection by sharing a
common bathroom.
GERM: A young professional can't
tell his girlfriend that he has herpes,
fearing honesty would destroy their
relationship.
GERM: Students at a Midwestern
college place a chart on a dormitory
bulletin board, outlining who might
have herpes and who might not.
GERM: In a local magazine, a per
sonal notice solicits a response from
"a male with a similar herpes infec
tion."

While these vignettes comes to us
from friends, the curse of the herpes
simplex II virus could soon touch a
striking percentage of the popu
lation.
One of five herpes-class viruses,
genital herpes is out of control. It's al
ready struck one in five American
adults, dooming many for a life of re
curring illness and, in women, a 50-50
chance of developing cervical
cancer. Unless a miracle drug ap
pears soon (such a cure is believed
years away), another 10 million
Americans will be infected by the
end of the decade.
Though herpex simplex II has been
around for awhile, it's only recently
become an epidemic. The promis
cuity of our generation may have
something to do with this; so might
the techniques exposed in the wide
ly-popular sex manuals.
At any rate, the proliferation of
genital blisters isn't surprising when
the warning signs often don't appear

Indeed, the barricades to a cureare taller than a
simple lack of research funds. Given the
glamour of cancer research ,the American
medical community has probably not felt as
much public pressure to study venereal
diseases. To date, for example, only two U.S.
medical schools — the University of
Washington and Southwestern University in
Texas offer programs for the study of genital
herpes.

until 20 days after exposure. Sadly, by
today's social standards, that's an
eternity.
And though a new drug, acyclovir,
reduces the pain of genital blisters, it
doesn't treat the virus itself. And it
obviously can do nothing to address
the guilt and paranoia that attend a
social disease. Nor can it lessen the
chance that herpes might cause
cervical cancer or birth defects.
Herpes sufferers have unfortunate
ly received little succor from Uncle
Sam or the scientific community. Said
Wendy Wetheimer, director of pub
lic health policy for the American So
cial Health Association: "The federal
government is only spending $3.6
million a year to determine how to
treat Americans with genital herpes.
But that's not enough. Remember

that the government spends hun
dreds of millions in research for
arthritis victims."
Indeed, the barricades to a cure
are taller than a simple lack of re
search funds. Given the glamour of
cancer research, the American medi
cal community has probably not felt
as much public pressure to study ve
nereal diseases. To date, for example,
only two U.S. medical schools — the
University of Washington and South
western University in Texas — offer
programs for the study of genital
herpes.
Perhaps research programs would
blossom were herpes an accepted
public-health issue. But Americans
don't yet fear herpes as they fear
cancer (though the virus could soon
strike innocent victims as suddenly as
the Big C). No matter what doctors
tell us about birth defects, we prefer
to look the other way.
Our laissez faire attitude isn't
helped by the virus's habit of lying

dormant in the body. "Checking
out" one's sexual partners turns out
to be an awkward and often pointless
task. And apart from religious coun
selors, few of our potential "ad
visers" advocate the obvious preven
tion — abstinence.
Yet there's no underestimating this
bug. As an increased number of
herpes-stricken friends and acquain
tances come to feel, as one friend
does, "like a sewer," perhaps public
attitudes will change.
Herpes won't be ignored forever.
We merely think it strange that a gen
eration devoted to the responsible
maxim, "Our Bodies, Ourselves," is
so slow to look herpes in the face.

herpes.

cancer (though the virus could soon

the Big C). No matter what doctors
tell us about birth defects, we prefer
to look the other way.

Washington — There's never been
a congressional hearing on it. And
there probably won't be one until
half of Congress wakes up one morn
ing, stricken.
But in the meantime the rest of us
are suffering directly or indirectly
from genital herpes, a viral strain that
threatens to alter — or abolish — our
species forever. If we don't already
have some form of herpes, we don't
know as much about it as we should.
GERM: A 24-year-old magazine
editor fears she'll pick up a house

mate's herpes infection by sharing a
common bathroom.
GERM: A young professional can't
tell his girlfriend that he has herpes,
fearing honesty would destroy their
relationship.
GERM: Students at a Midwestern
college place a chart on a dormitory
bulletin board, outlining who might
have herpes and who might not.
GERM: In a local magazine, a per
sonal notice solicits a response from
"a male with a similar herpes infec
tion."

While these vignettes comes to us
from friends, the curse of the herpes
simplex II virus could soon touch a
striking percentage of the popu
lation.
One of five herpes-class viruses,
genital herpes is out of control. It's al
ready struck one in five American
adults, dooming many for a life of re
curring illness and, in women, a 50-50
chance of developing cervical
cancer. Unless a miracle drug ap
pears soon (such a cure is believed
years away), another 10 million
Americans will be infected by the
end of the decade.
Though herpex simplex II has been
around for awhile, it's only recently
become an epidemic. The promis
cuity of our generation may have
something to do with this; so might
the techniques exposed in the wide
ly-popular sex manuals.
At any rate, the proliferation of
genital blisters isn't surprising when
the warning signs often don't appear

Indeed, the barricades to a cureare taller than a
simple lack of research funds. Given the
glamour of cancer research ,the American
medical community has probably not felt as
much public pressure to study venereal
diseases. To date, for example, only two U.S.
medical schools — the University of
Washington and Southwestern University in
Texas offer programs for the study of genital
herpes.

until 20 days after exposure. Sadly, by
today's social standards, that's an
eternity.
And though a new drug, acyclovir,
reduces the pain of genital blisters, it
doesn't treat the virus itself. And it
obviously can do nothing to address
the guilt and paranoia that attend a
social disease. Nor can it lessen the
chance that herpes might cause
cervical cancer or birth defects.
Herpes sufferers have unfortunate
ly received little succor from Uncle
Sam or the scientific community. Said
Wendy Wetheimer, director of pub
lic health policy for the American So
cial Health Association: "The federal
government is only spending $3.6
million a year to determine how to
treat Americans with genital herpes.
But that's not enough. Remember

that the government spends hun
dreds of millions in research for
arthritis victims."
