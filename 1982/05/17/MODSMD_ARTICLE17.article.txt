# Letter
## Victim's message 
### 
My name is Liz. I am the woman
who was attacked near Kresge two
weeks ago. I am writing this letter be
cause I feel I have some things to say
to the Stanford community. It is not
my intention to generalize my ex
perience on a world scale, or even on
a community scale. This is just one
woman's feelings on how she felt and
what she thought about after she was
attacked.
It is spring quarter and the rash of
attacks at the beginning of the year
seemed liked very distant and vague
memories. So I relaxed, as I am sure
many other women did. Things like
those attacks always happen to other
people — people you don't know
who are anonymous victims and re
main anonymous victims. And now,
because I have become one of those
victims, I am forced to deal with is
sues I had no wish to deal with before
because I had no need to deal with
them before. The immediate prob
lem I had to deal with was my reac
tion the next day when I ran into an
old friend I had not seen in awhile —
who just happened to be male and
black. I was shocked to find myself
physically cringing from him in fear.
Silly as it may sound, though he
looked nothing like my attacker, I
had transferred that fear and anger I
felt towards my attacker to my friend
— and all because he happened to be
a black male. As the day wore on it
became worse as I became even
more paranoid and angry. For now
the anger was directed not just at
black men, but at all men. Of course
it wasn't fair — but then, it wasn't fair
that I should have been attacked. I
felt that though I was functioning
normally on other levels, on the level

of how I as a woman relate to men
(whether I knew them or not), I had
become very irrational. I couldn't
think of them as people, but rather
only as men who have the power to
inflict pain and humiliation on wom
en. I was scared that I was feeling all
this hate — and frustrated that I
couldn't think my way out of it
logically.
I can't pretend that all those feel
ings are gone; I still have some re
sidual fears and nightmares. What
has helped me tremendously since
the attack was talking it out with
friends. Because through those com
munications I was able to talk a lot of
the problems I experienced and to
accept intellectually and emotionally
the fact that it was not my fault I was
attacked, and that it was also not the
fault of the male population that I
was attacked. It is the same type of
hate and fear I felt that is causing the
tension at Stanford — and that has
become worse since the assault last
week of another Stanford woman. I
don't know what the solutions are; I
only know what has helppd me. My
anger turned me towards the idea
that men — all men — are respon
sible for the act of that one individual
against me. Forcing myself to con
front my black friend and tell him ex
actly how I felt helped me get rid of
the rascist aspects of my anger. Forc
ing myself to talk to male friends, as
well as female friends, has helped
dispell my fears. These attacks are not
just the victims' problems; the fact
that one deviant individual can cause
so many problems for so many peo
ple makes us all victims.
