## 
### Karen Springen 
"Celebrate Diversity" month, sponsored by
the Office of Student Activities, highlights the
multitude of religious, racial, political, sexual,
ethnic, cultural and intellectual activities here at
Stanford.
Lisa Verhovek, assistant programming direc
tor at Tresidder Union, called it "a pulling to
gether of Stanford's diverse events throughout
the month, especially those within the minority
and ethnic communities."
Dean of Students Thom Massey, who ori
ginated the idea of the first annual event, em
phasized the University's "commitment to di
versity." He pointed to its "philosophy of af
firmative action" in recruiting staff, faculty and
students.
"We need to do more than just tolerate diver
sity. We need to celebrate it," said Massey.
"We need to pay a little more than lip-service
to it,"he added.
Asst. Dean of Student Affairs Michael Perez
said, "The purpose (of Celebrate Diversity) is to
facilitate a campaign of publicity for the diversity
at Stanford." He said the celebration should
"demonstrate to the University that these di
verse programs are actually open to everyone."
Perez referred to the need not to neglect di
versity "during this wave of conservatism." He
also urged the Univeristy "not to overlook our
own resources."
According to second-year law student Jeri
Stewart of the Black Community Service Center,
the program is designed to "outreach into the
University communities." She said that the Black

Community Service Center, the umbrella or
ganization for all the black student groups,
wants to help recognize the ethnic, racial and
sexual diversity here.
According to Verhovek, "It's really pulling to
gether a lot of events that were going to happen
anyway." Verhovek, also assistant director of
STARTS, said, "We're trying to design our pro
grams around this theme." She said, "We're
hoping to encourage people to recognize and
participate in these 'diverse' events, especially
those who would not normally do so."
The "Celebrate Diversity" calendar quotes
both President Donald Kennedy and Vice Prov
ost Ray Bacchetti. According to Kennedy, "It is
important by itself for Stanford students to con
front the diversity of their own national gener
ation, to learn to live with that diversity and ul
timately to come to celebrate it."
Bacchetti said, "One of Stanford's great
strengths is its diversity. Yet as individuals, we
too often insulate ourselves from those re
sources."
The month's activities kicked off with a noon
concert by a Latin American group. Other ac
tivities include Cinco de Mayo, Gay Family Day,
an Indian supper, a massage workshop, jazz Day,
a pow-wow, an Irish supper and a libertarian dis
cussion.
"Celebrate Diversity" will culminate with a
picnic May 28 from noon to 5 p.m. in Roble
Field. The free event will include lunch.
According to Perez, coordinator for OSA, the
picnir- provides one opportunity for the Univer
sity's diverse student body to interact without a
political agenda.
