# Candidate Raffel seeks to preserve the future
## 
### Jeff Biddulph 
The future is what bothers Keith
Raffel the most.
Raffel, 31, the Democratic can
didate for the 12th Congressional
District, is campaigning on the theory
that voters in the newly-apportioned
district, which includes parts of San
Mateo, Santa Clara and Stanislaus
Counties, will favor him because he
sees the Reagan Administration as
threatening the future and says that
as a congressman he will do his best
to meet that threat.
His platform stresses a variety of
policies which he says "look beyond
the next 10 or 20 years — unlike the
Reagan Administration." He would
concentrate on closing the federal
budget deficit by cutting defense
spending and closing tax loopholes
for special interests and would push
for a revitalization of the strategic
arms limitations talks. He calls nucle
ar war "the greatest threat to the
future."
Raffel said that he acquired his for
ward-thinking view from studying

history; he majored in that at Harvard
and Oxford.
"I watched what caused certain so
cieties to decline, such as England,"
he said. "I want to make sure we
don't end up like that."
What he said he noticed in England
was a lack of commitment to educa
tion.
"The English poured all of their
money into industry and didn't invest
enough in education," he said.
Raffel said that one of his biggest
priorities would be a major commit
ment to education. Raffel also said
that he supported the growth of in
novative industries in favor of estab
lished ones, as well as a commitment
to clean airand the protection of Cal
ifornia coastlines. He also said that he
opposes any cuts in Social Security
benefits.
It may be difficult to win the No
vember election on this platform in
the 12th district, which most political
analysts say leans slightly to the Re
publican side. Rep. Paul "Pete" Mc-

Closkey (R-Menlo Park), the 12th
district incumbent who is runningfor
a senate seat, drew broad support de
spite the majority of registered dem
ocrats in the district. Republican Ed
Zschau, whom Raffel considers his
major opponent, has strong backing
from a few Silicon Valley electronics
firms, including Systems Industries,
of which Zschau is president.
Raffel is heavily favored over Los
Altos school administrator Emmett
Lynch in the June 8 democratic pri
mary. Raffel said he is concentrating
on the November election and he
fears the recent reapportionment
which took Stanford out of the 12th
District will make beating Zschau
more difficult.
Raffel thinks he would have re
ceived large support from University
students because of his stand on
education. He said he thinks that a
large portion of the University stu
dents who live in Menlo Park and
Palo Alto, and who are in his district,
support his campaign.
Raffel's most solid support comes

from a cadre of California democrat
ic congressmen. He has received en
dorsements from Tom Lantos (San
Mateo), Norman Mineta (San Jose),
Don Edwards (San Jose), Leon Pan
etta (Carmel Valley) and Tony
Coelho (Merced).
Zschau has received endorsements
from McCloskey as well as a few Rea
gan Administration officials.
"He's welcome to that support as
far as I'm concerned," said Raffel.
Raffel grew up in Palo Alto, re
ceived a B.A. from Harvard, an M.A.
from Oxford and a law degree from
Harvard. He has spent the last four
yearsin Washington as counseltothe
Senate Select Committee on In
telligence.
This experience is what Raffel feels
makes him the better candidate than
Zschau. He said that ne has made last
ing connections with many con
gressmen and that he has their sup
port and respect.
"I'd be able to get to work in Wash
ington on the first day,"he said.
