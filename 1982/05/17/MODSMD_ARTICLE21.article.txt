## Funny, high gloss production needs more bite

Lillian Hellman called The
Little Foxes "melodrama." The
term doesn't fully apply to that
play, or to its sequel Another
Part of the Forest — while
there's plenty of evil to hiss at
in both plays, neither presents
much in the way of good; and
what good there is, is too
pathetic to cheer for.
Hellman's point is that the
chronicles of the Hubbard fam
ily should not be taken as trag
edy. Marcus Hubbard's fall in
Another Part of the Forest isn't
inevitable, and it isn't caused
by any tragic flaw — it's
brought about by bad luck, and
a last-ditch bloom of courage
in his son. The post-war Ameri

can South in these two plays
lacks the gods necessary for
tragedy; the characters'
triumphs and downfalls are
due to bad habits and chance
and alcohol. Rather than
prince usurping king, we're
shown parvenu ousting carpet
bagger.
That's what Hellman wrote,
anyway. It's possible, however,
to do Another Part of the Forest
as the tragedy Hellman never
meant it to be — the frequency
of such interpretations is what
led her to speak out — by
roughing up the edges a little
and allowing Marcus to be
magnificent in defeat.
The ACT isn't known for
roughening up anything; if a
play has edges, this company
will generally do its best to hide
them from us. Their current
production of Another Part of

the Forest is firmly in this tradi
tion. Under Allen Fletcher's
direction the play runs along
smoothly like the parlor com
edy Hellman says it is — it's fast
moving, consistently funny,
occasionally moving, and
always fascinating. Un
fortunately, this sort of produc
tion reveals the play's several
failings: its weak, inconclusive
ending, and the final incom
prehensibility (or is it just
sketchiness?) of the play's main
character, Marcus Hubbard.
Marcus isn't really a carpet
bagger — he's a Southerner,
but one from"the piney
woods," not the plantation. He
made his money in shady ways
during the Civil War, and now
the Hubbard's are the richest
family around. But try as he
might — by reading Aristotle
under the trees, taking break

fast from a silver tray on the
patio, supporting music
schools — Marcus can't buy his
way into the gentry; he and his
family have simply moved to
"another part of the forest/'
where their meanness and pet
ty jealousies become interest
ing enough to write a play
about. Ray Reinhardt has
chosen to emphasize Marcus's
intellectual and chivalric pre
tensions, and makes him so un
remittingly courtly that we like
him despite all the talk about
his cowardice and greed, even
despite his behavior to his
wife/slave, Lavinia. Reinhardt
doesn't show us the pathetic
side of Marcus's character until
his cdllapse at play's end,
thereby rendering the ending
even more inexplicable.
Both Reinhardt and Barbara
Dirickson (as the flirtatious

daughter, Regina) give per
formances designed to inter
rupt the smooth flow of the
play as little as possible; both
performances, while wonder
ful from moment to moment,
leave us unsatisfied. The in
cestuous relationship between
Marcus and Regina is one of
the few aspects of the play that
is of more than comic or
melodramatic interest, but
here even that is mainly played
for laughs.
Bruce Williams and Mark
Murphey, playing the Hubbard
brothers, Ben and Oscar, come
off well in the ACT scheme of
things. They both give assured
comic performances through
out; but the narrowness of this
approach is shown again at the
end when Ben can't realistical
ly be mean — Williams relies
on the same smirks and swag

gers that got him through the
rest of the play.
Anne Lawder's performance
as Lavinia, Marcus's put-upon
wife, stands out in sharp relief
against the high gloss of this
production. Lavinia is the one
really three-dimensional char
acter in the play, the only one
Hellman didn't subject to the
leveling required by

melodrama. Lawder doesn't do
anything spectacular, she just
allows Lavinia to grow into the
realizations that are there for
her in the script — the miracle
is that at the end, we believe
she's capable of the trans
formation we see her go
through. As enjoyable as ACT's-.

tensions, and makes him so un
remittingly courtly that we like
him despite all the talk about
his cowardice and greed, even
despite his behavior to his
wife/slave, Lavinia. Reinhardt
doesn't show us the pathetic
side of Marcus's character until
his cdllapse at play's end,
thereby rendering the ending
even more inexplicable.
Both Reinhardt and Barbara
Dirickson (as the flirtatious

daughter, Regina) give per
formances designed to inter
rupt the smooth flow of the
play as little as possible; both
performances, while wonder
ful from moment to moment,
leave us unsatisfied. The in
cestuous relationship between
Marcus and Regina is one of
the few aspects of the play that
is of more than comic or
melodramatic interest, but
here even that is mainly played
for laughs.
Bruce Williams and Mark
Murphey, playing the Hubbard
brothers, Ben and Oscar, come
off well in the ACT scheme of
things. They both give assured
comic performances through
out; but the narrowness of this
approach is shown again at the
end when Ben can't realistical
ly be mean — Williams relies
on the same smirks and swag

gers that got him through the
rest of the play.
Anne Lawder's performance
as Lavinia, Marcus's put-upon
wife, stands out in sharp relief
against the high gloss of this
production. Lavinia is the one
really three-dimensional char
acter in the play, the only one
Hellman didn't subject to the
leveling required by

melodrama. Lawder doesn't do
anything spectacular, she just
allows Lavinia to grow into the
realizations that are there for
her in the script — the miracle
is that at the end, we believe
she's capable of the trans
formation we see her go
through. As enjoyable as ACT's-.

Anotfier Part of the Forest
American Conservatory
Theatre, San Francisco
Lillian Hellman called The
Little Foxes "melodrama." The
term doesn't fully apply to that
play, or to its sequel Another
Part of the Forest — while
there's plenty of evil to hiss at
in both plays, neither presents
much in the way of good; and
what good there is, is too
pathetic to cheer for.
Hellman's point is that the
chronicles of the Hubbard fam
ily should not be taken as trag
edy. Marcus Hubbard's fall in
Another Part of the Forest isn't
inevitable, and it isn't caused
by any tragic flaw — it's
brought about by bad luck, and
a last-ditch bloom of courage
in his son. The post-war Ameri

can South in these two plays
lacks the gods necessary for
tragedy; the characters'
triumphs and downfalls are
due to bad habits and chance
and alcohol. Rather than
prince usurping king, we're
shown parvenu ousting carpet
bagger.
That's what Hellman wrote,
anyway. It's possible, however,
to do Another Part of the Forest
as the tragedy Hellman never
meant it to be — the frequency
of such interpretations is what
led her to speak out — by
roughing up the edges a little
and allowing Marcus to be
magnificent in defeat.
The ACT isn't known for
roughening up anything; if a
play has edges, this company
will generally do its best to hide
them from us. Their current
production of Another Part of

the Forest is firmly in this tradi
tion. Under Allen Fletcher's
direction the play runs along
smoothly like the parlor com
edy Hellman says it is — it's fast
moving, consistently funny,
occasionally moving, and
always fascinating. Un
fortunately, this sort of produc
tion reveals the play's several
failings: its weak, inconclusive
ending, and the final incom
prehensibility (or is it just
sketchiness?) of the play's main
character, Marcus Hubbard.
Marcus isn't really a carpet
bagger — he's a Southerner,
but one from"the piney
woods," not the plantation. He
made his money in shady ways
during the Civil War, and now
the Hubbard's are the richest
family around. But try as he
might — by reading Aristotle
under the trees, taking break

fast from a silver tray on the
patio, supporting music
schools — Marcus can't buy his
way into the gentry; he and his
family have simply moved to
"another part of the forest/'
where their meanness and pet
ty jealousies become interest
ing enough to write a play
about. Ray Reinhardt has
chosen to emphasize Marcus's
intellectual and chivalric pre
tensions, and makes him so un
remittingly courtly that we like
him despite all the talk about
his cowardice and greed, even
despite his behavior to his
wife/slave, Lavinia. Reinhardt
doesn't show us the pathetic
side of Marcus's character until
his cdllapse at play's end,
thereby rendering the ending
