### Sarah Carrel 
Three members of the Stan
ford men's and women's track
teams had season best per
formances at the Modesto Re
lays Saturday. Carol Cady, Gar
ry Shumway and Kevin Jones
made a name for Stanford at
the world class meet.
Cady, a sophomore from Los
Alamos, New Mexico threw
over 49 feet in the shotput, a
feat she has only accomplished
a couple of times. In the discus,
she threw 175 feet.
Stanford's ace hurdler Garry
Shumway also produced his
season and personal best time
at Modesto in the intermediate
hurdles with a time of 51.8.
Kevin Jones, who also is from
the east (Philadelphia, Pennsyl
vania), ran well in the 110-
meter hurdles clocking a time
of 14.05, for another Stanford

season best.
Head coach Brooks Johnson
was pleased with the per
formances of these select
members of his team. Thirty
world records have been set at
the Modesto relays and al
though Stanford did not take a
first place he commented, "for
the kids to go up there and do
that well is pretty gratifying."
Both the men's and women's
teams have finished their dual
meet seasons, the men with a
record of 6-5 and the women
with a mark of 8-5. The next
step will be preparing for the
championship events. For the
men, the Pac-10 Cham
pionships are next weekend at
the University of Oregon.
Then, from June 3rd through
6th, both teams will travel to
Salt Lake City for the NCAA
championships at Brigham
Young University.
