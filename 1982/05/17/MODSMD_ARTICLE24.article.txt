Salt Lake City — Top-seeded
Stanford coasted into today's
second round action of the
NCAA women's tennis
champsionhip at the Canyon
Racquet Club breezing past
last-seeded Clemson 9-0 yes
terday.
The Cardinal will face the win
ner of the Brigham Young Uni
versity-Rollins University
match at 8 a.m. today.
Stanford duplicated there 9-0
victory over Clemson in the
first round of the Nike Indoor
Tournament March 4, by domi
nating the singles without
dropping a set.
Caryn Copeland, at No. 6 sin
gles, led the charge by
smothering Jane Nebille 6-0,
6-0 in 48 minutes. It was the
third straight match that
Copeland had finished in an
hour or less.
Alycia Moulton bounced back
from a three-set win over Gene
Forman in March to ease by her
6-3,6-3 yesterday.
"Caryn played nearly flawless
tennis and Alycia played a great
match," Stanford coach Frank
Brennan said. "Forman gave
her three sets at the indoor and
is one of the best players in the
country. That's not to say she
should beat Alycia, but Alycia
could have dropped a set or
lost her concentration — she
didn't."
Elise Burgin and Linda Gates
won handily. Burgin trounced
Jennifer Hirsh 6-2, 6-2 at No. 2
singles and Gates warmed up
slowly but blasted Maria
Echarte 6-4, 6-1.
Michelle Weiss blew a huge
second-set lead, but held on to
win 6-4, 6-3 at No. 5 and Kate
Gompert came from behind in
the second-set to edge Melissa

Seigler 6-3,6-4.
Brennan was pleased with the
easy win calling it "an excellent
first-round match. It gets the
butterfly's out," but looked
cautiously at the string of nag
ging injuries that plagued the
Cards.
Gompert, who sprained her
ankle a month ago, slightly ag
gravated it in a Saturday prac
tice.
Stanford trainer Dake Walden
said the ankle should be all
right, but Brennan was still
hesitant.
"I'm just worried about our in
juries," Brennan said. "Itseems
everyone has a little nagging
problem. Kate's ankle flared up
again. It should not bother her,
but she is so active. She had
good foot work and moves
around well so it might slow
her up."
Stanford also dominated the
doubles. Moulton and
Copeland beat Forman in Hirsh
6-3, 6-4. Bergin and Gates
whipped Miller and Melinda
Hancock 6-3, 6-1 and Gompert
and Weiss beat Neville and
Seigler 7-5,6-3.
"I think it was a perfect open
ing match considering the
altitude," Brennan said.
Stanford players said the
altitude makes the ball sail a lit
tle more and the courts a little
faster, which is one reason
Brennan would rather play
Rollins and eliminate ABYU
home-court advantage tomor
row.
South Carolina will now face
No. 3 seeded USC who
whipped Pepperdine 9-0 and
Miami will face No. 2 UCLA
who blanked Arizona 9-0.
Trinity ripped Oklahoma State
9-0 and San Diego State beat
Northwestern.
