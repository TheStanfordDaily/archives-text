# Card takes three from Cal
## 
### Adam Berns 
Berkeley — The Stanford
baseball team proved that it
can win a game even when it
does not have to. Entering the
weekend with a playoff berth
already assured, Stanford
swept UC-Berkeley 7-5, 8-5,
9-3.
The Cardinal took five-of-six
games from the Bears this year
and is currently riding the crest
of an eight game winning
streak.
"That's the best we've done
in a long time against them
(Cal)," Stanford coach Mark
Marquess said following yes
terday's game.
Stanford ends its regular sea
son with a 43-16-1 overall rec
ord, 20-10 in Pac-10 Southern
Division play.
One of the most impressive
things about yesterday's vic
tory was that it came while
Marquess was resting several of
his key players with minor ail
ments. Left fielder Mike Dot
terer sat out with a sore shoul
der while second baseman
Steve Buechelle rested a pulled
groin. Unfortunately out
fielder Mike Toothman was
added to the injury list — hurt
ing his finger while batting in
the seventh inning yesterday.
Marquess hopes that all of
them will be able to play
against Oregon State on Tues
day. "I don't think the injuries
are serious enough to keep
them out," he said.
Marquess also did not use his
full pitching potential over the
weekend. Choosing to rest his
starters for Oregon State, he
only let starters Brian Mignano,
Brian Myers, and David Harris
pitch a few innings each.
"I think our pitchings been
real good," Marquess said yes
terday. "Harris pitched real
well today and although
(Steve) Stark had some control

problems, he still did a good
job."
Stanford did not play like a
team that was looking ahead to
the playoffs.
"I wanted to make sure we
didn't let down at all," Mar
quess said. "You can't just let
down and then say now its time
to turn it back on because
sometimes when you want to
turn it on you can't.
The Cardinal will play the
Pac-10 Nothern Division win
ner, Oregon State, in a best-of
three series at Sunken
Diamond tommorrow,
Wednesday, and if need be
Thursday. Tommorrow's con
test starts at 2:30 p.m.
Although the Northern
schools have not been particu
larly strong in recent years,
Marquess says that Oregon
State will provide tough com
petition.
Yesterday's game at
Berkeley's Clint Evans
Diamond started slowly with
neither team able to get a rally
going. Finally in the fourth in
ning, Bear shortstop Brian
Guinn hit a solo home run off
Card reliever Steve Stark.
Stanford freshman David
Harris started the game but was
pulled after three scoreless in
nings in order to keep him
fresh for the Oregon State
Series.
In the fifth inning, Stanford
evened the score when center
fielder Darryl Stephens hit a
solo home run off Cal starter
Nick Esposito. From then on,
the Cardinal never looked
back.
Marquess, who had been
telling his players to get things
going for the last several in
nings, finally got his wish. With
one out in the seventh inning,
catcher Lyle Smith walked.
Third baseman John Verducci
followed with an infield single

and then Loring Davies singled
to load the bases. First baseman
Mike Aldrete then hit into
what looked like a routine
double play, but the Bears only
got Davies out at second as
Aldrete beat the throw to first.
Pete Stanicek, who was run
ning for Smith, was able to
score on the hit. Designated
hitter Bob Hausladen walked
to put runners on first and sec
ond. Right fielder Greg
Lorenzetti then lashed a two
run double to right-center
field to give Stanford a 5-1 lead.
The Bears narrowed the gap
in the seventh inning to 5-2,
but it could have been more if
it was not for an excellent field
ing play by Stephens. Stanford
reliever Mike Sullivan walked
the first two batters he faced
and with a 2-0 count on the
third batter, Marquess called in
freshman Eric Pierce. After
walking Bear outfielder Ken
Freer to load the bases, Pierce
gave up a single to pinch hitter
Greg McClain. Cal infielder
Bruce Johnson easily scored
from third base but Stephens
made a perfect throw from
center field and gunned down
Darrel Varrelmann who tried
to score from second.
In the top of the eighth inn
ning, Stanford turned the game
into a route by scoring three
more times.
In Friday's game at Berkeley,
Stanford pinch hitter Eric Hard
grave had an excellent day
going four-for-five to lead
Stanford to a 7-5 victory.
Pitcher Brian Mignano, who
started the game, was credited
with his 11th victory against five
defeats. Doug Gwaltney was
the winning pitcher in Satur
day's game at Sunken Diamond
while Pierce was credited with
yesterday's victory.

and played flawlessly in center field.
