jionships at Redwood Shores,
lal and Washington domi
lated both the women's and
men's divisions, breaking sev
eral course records over ex
cellent conditions for the race.
Qualifying heats were held
Saturday, with the winners
going on to compete in Sun
day's finals and the losers in
Sunday's consolation bracket.
I
; Stanford's varsity women
took a roundabout course in
their quest for an invitation to
the nationals. After beating
USC by 17 seconds in Satuday
morning's heat, the women
had a rematch with rival Cal.
Stanford substantially defeated
the Bears last weekend over a
1500 meter course; however,
this race only covered 1000
meters.
Cal rowed the flawless race
required to beat an outstand
ing Stanford crew, winning by
about half a boat-length.
Sunday morning they de
feated UCLA for the bronze
and set a new course record of

3:09.3.
Although Washington broke
this record 20 minutes later in
the Women's finals, Stanford's
time was better than second
place Cal's. This time, plus
Stanford's victory last weekend
assures Stanford an invitation
to the national championships.
Men's coach Bob Whitford
expected his Varsity men to fin
ish fourth this weekend behind
Cal, Washington and UCLA
and he was correct. "The men
have had some good races this
season, racing some of the best
teams and ducking no one. I'm
happy for them," he said.
The Varsity eight rowed a
fine race against a closely
matched Oregon State crew
Saturday morning, but had the
unfortunate luck to face the
nation's top-ranked crew, Cal,
Saturday evening. Cal won this
race and eventually the finals in
a new course record Sunday.
"They have three oarsmen with
international experience and it
really shows," Whitford said.
Stanford turned in its best time
of the weekend agaisnt UCLA
Sunday morning, garnering
fourth place.
