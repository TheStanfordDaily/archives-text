Once again, members of the
women's golf team proved that
they are in top form heading
into the NCAA championships,
to be held at Stanford in nine
days. Card linksters took two of
the first four places at the
Blossom Festival, an amateur
tournament at los Gatos' La
Rinconada Golf Course Satur
day and Sunday.
The individual tournament
featured both men's and wom
en's competition with 18 holes
being played Saturday and 36
yesterday."I entered the girls
in the tournament so that they
will be tournament hardened,"
coach Tim Baldwin said.
"It was a real top-notch
amateur tournament."
San Jose State's Julie Inkster
placed first with a 223
(71-73-79). Baldwin sees
Inkster, Oaklahoma State's Val
Skinner and SMU's Amy Benz
as being favorites for the NCAA
individual crown.
Six strokes behind the
Spartan golfer was Stanford's
Lori Castillo. Joanne Pacillo
fired a 235, good enough for
fourth place. Freshman Diane
Nixon also placed in the top
ten.
