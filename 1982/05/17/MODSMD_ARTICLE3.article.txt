British prepare islands for invasion
London â€” British forces continued "softening up" Argentine de
fenses for a counterinvasion of the Falkland Islands yesterday as the
government prepared its strategy for a climactic week of negotiations at
the United Nations viewed here as the last opportunity for a diplomatic
resolution of the crisis.
Sea Harrier jets from the British naval task force off the Falklands yes
terday attacked two Argentine ships in harbors on the Falkland Sound
between East and West Falkland islands, the Defense Ministry here an
nounced. British correspondents with the task force said other Harriers
attacked Argentine military installations around the Stanley airfield ear
ly yesterday for the third time in three days.
The Argentine ships were bombed and strafed, a Defense Ministry
spokesman said. "We have no firm indication of the extent of the dam
age caused, although the crew of one of the vessels was subsequently
seen to be abandoning ship."
Two Harriers also attacked an Argentine merchant ship, the Rio
Carcarania, off East Falkland island near the port of Darwin, British cor
respondents reported, and pilots in two Harriers following behind saw
survivors on their way to shore in lifeboats.
Two more Harriers attacked another merchant ship moored in Fox
Bay on West Falkland island, according to British Broadcasting Corp.
correspondent Brian Hanarahan on the British aircraft carrier Hermes.
Hanarahan said the ship fired back, hitting one of the Harriers in the tail,
but the damage was repairable and the pilot was unhurt.
The Argentine military command reported that British Sea Harrier
war planes attacked "without consequence" Port Darwin located on a
sound in the center of East Falkland and Zorro Bay, just south of Port
Darwin. A military communique gave no further details.
The attacks on the ships in tnr Falkland Sound appeared aimed at cut
ting all communications between Argentine forces on the two main
Falkland islands
