British prepare islands for invasion
London — British forces continued "softening up" Argentine de
fenses for a counterinvasion of the Falkland Islands yesterday as the
government prepared its strategy for a climactic week of negotiations at
the United Nations viewed here as the last opportunity for a diplomatic
resolution of the crisis.
Sea Harrier jets from the British naval task force off the Falklands yes
terday attacked two Argentine ships in harbors on the Falkland Sound
between East and West Falkland islands, the Defense Ministry here an
nounced. British correspondents with the task force said other Harriers
attacked Argentine military installations around the Stanley airfield ear
ly yesterday for the third time in three days.
The Argentine ships were bombed and strafed, a Defense Ministry
spokesman said. "We have no firm indication of the extent of the dam
age caused, although the crew of one of the vessels was subsequently
seen to be abandoning ship."
Two Harriers also attacked an Argentine merchant ship, the Rio
Carcarania, off East Falkland island near the port of Darwin, British cor
respondents reported, and pilots in two Harriers following behind saw
survivors on their way to shore in lifeboats.
Two more Harriers attacked another merchant ship moored in Fox
Bay on West Falkland island, according to British Broadcasting Corp.
correspondent Brian Hanarahan on the British aircraft carrier Hermes.
Hanarahan said the ship fired back, hitting one of the Harriers in the tail,
but the damage was repairable and the pilot was unhurt.
The Argentine military command reported that British Sea Harrier
war planes attacked "without consequence" Port Darwin located on a
sound in the center of East Falkland and Zorro Bay, just south of Port
Darwin. A military communique gave no further details.
The attacks on the ships in tnr Falkland Sound appeared aimed at cut
ting all communications between Argentine forces on the two main
Falkland islands
The repeated attacks on the Stanley airfield
are aimed at preventing its use by even light
planes for supply of an estimated 5000 or more
Argentine troops in the vicinity, at destroying
military installations including mobile radar be
lieved to be used to direct Argentine air strikes
against the British fleet and harassing the Ar
gentine forces to reduce their readiness to de
fend against a British assault on the islands.
A senior British government source said yes
terday that such attacks and hit-and-run com
mando raids like the one on Pebble Island Fri
day night and Saturday morning will continue
"over the next few days" along with the nego
tiations at the United Nations. "There will be in
creasing harassment of the Argentine forces
one way or another," the source said.
Declaring that the U.N. negotiations must
"come to a head one way or another" this
week, British Defense Secretary John Nott yes
terday warned, "If we fail to achieve a peaceful
settlement, then we have no other choice but to
pursue the military options much more vigor
ously than we have up to now."
Haig denies Greece security
pledge in possible conflict
Athens, Greece — Secretary of State Alex
ander Haig, seeking to calm Greek fears of Turk
ish military strength, said yesterday that the
United States would oppose any "first use of
force" in the Aegean Sea region just as it has in
the Falkland Islands.
Completing a three-day swing through the
Aegean area, Haig again refused to give an ex
plicit U.S. security guarantee to Greece as its
government had requested. He also refused
again to endorse specifically a past U.S. promise
to "make a major effort" to prevent military
hostilities between the two Aegean nations
who are North Atlantic Treaty Organization al
lies.
But he then volunteered, in response to a
question at a press conference, that "the U.S.
view (of any Aegean conflict) is no different
than it is in the Falkland question" where Wash
ington has sided wit Britain against Argentina.
"We reject the first use of force to resolve any
dispute" Haig added.
Greek-Turkish tensions have increased after
the election seven months ago of socialist Prime
Minister Andreas Papandreou here. He has
broken off talks with Turkey on Aegean territo
rial water disputes and interrupted some
progress that had been under way regarding
Cyprus over which the two nations went to the
brink of war in 1974.
Greece has more than 2300 islands in the Ae
gean Sea, many of which are far closer to the
Turkish coast than to the Greek mainland.
Papandreou has strongly supported Britain's
stand against Argentina in the Falklands clash
because, in a clear parallel to the situation in the
South Atlantic, Greece fears Turkish claims on
its island possessions
"The task ahead is to resolve issues which
cause understandable concern" in both Greece
and Turkey, Haig said. While the United States
will not be a mediator, "we will try to be a
catalyst in this effort," he added.
Americans fear nuclear bomb
use, favor parity with Soviets
New York — Three of four Americans say any
use of nuclear weapons would lead to a full
scale world war, according to the latest As
sociated Press-NBC News poll.
A majority also said they think falling behind

the Soviet Union in arms production increases
the chances of war.
The nationwide telephone poll was a scien
tific random sampling of 1599 adults on May
10-11.
Seventy-five percent said they think any use
of nuclear weapons would lead to a full-scale
world war, while 17 percent said they think a
limited nuclear war is possible and 8 percent
were not sure.
Fifty percent said the United States should
move toward nuclear disarmament only if the
Soviets agree to disarm as well, while 28 percent
said the U.S. should not disarm at all. Fourteen
percent said the United States should disarm on
its own; 8 percent were not sure.
And 83 percent said the favor a freeze on the
production of nuclear weapons in both the
United States and the Soviet Union.
At his news conference last week, President
Ronald Reagan reiterated his position that the
U.S. nuclear arsenal lags behind the Soviets' and
must be built up to bring the Soviets into an
arms agreement.
In the poll, 69 percent said they think the
chances of war would increase if the United
States stopped producing nuclear weapons but
the Soviet Union continued to produce them.
Ten percent said a unilateral U.S. halt would de
crease the chances of war, 11 percent said it
would make no difference and 10 percent were
not sure.
Seventy-six percent said it is either very im
portant or somewhat important to national de
fense for the United States to produce as many
nuclear weapons as the Soviet Union does.
At the same time, 84 percent said they think
children should be taught in school about the
bad effects of nuclear war. More than half of
those people said teaching about the bad ef
fects of nuclear war should begin in grade
school.
However, a 51 percent majority said they
would not like to see the federal government
spend more money on civil defense programs
in the event of a nuclear war.
Argentines follow rumors
Buenos Aires, Argentina — A mysterious item
appeared on the front page of La Razon, an af
ternoon newspaper here, May 5. Headlined,
"The Hermes Sunk?" the story said that, accord
ing to the Soviet News agency Tass, the British
aircraft carrier had been bombed and sunk by
Argentine airplanes.
No official comment came from the Argen
tine junta. But in the press room of the Sheraton
Hotel, an Air Force official confided, "We did it
with a little Pucara plane that dropped six
bombs and 32 rockets. We think the Hermes is
severely damaged."
In the last two weeks, not a day has passed
without speculation in the news media over the
fate of the Hermes, the pride of the British navy
and flagship of its task force, with 1350 men
aboard. One paper indicated that Rear Adm.
Sandy Woodward, the task force commander,
may be dead. Reports from Venezuela had the
Hermes limping toward Curacao in the Carib
bean for repairs.
U.S. used Nazis as spies
Washington — State Department officials
smuggled more than 300 Russian-born Nazi col
laborators into the United States after World
War II and helped them become U.S. citizens
and obtain jobs in return for their participation
in Soviet spying operations during the Cold
War, the CBS television program "60 Minutes"
reported yesterday.

The smuggling proceeded despite orders by
Presidents Franklin Roosevelt and Harry
Truman barring immigration of Nazi war crimi
nals, and intelligence agencies continued to
cover it up as recently as 1978 during a con
gressional investigation, according to a former
Justice Department prosecutor interviewed on
the program.
"We had one unit of the government out
trying to prosecute the Nazis and other units of
the government trying to secret the informa
tion," said John Loftus, a Boston attorney who
left the Justice Department's Office of Special
Investigations last year. President Jimmy Carter
created the office in 1980 to root out Nazi war
criminals hiding in the United States.
"We later established that the files pertaining
to the Nazi immigration had been withheld
from Congress, from the courts, from the CIA
and from the local agents of the Immigration
Service," Loftus said.
One dies in Bay to Breakers
San Francisco — Rod Dixon of New Zealand
set what could be a new course record yester
day to win the 71st annual Bay to Breakers run.
One runner collapsed and died during the race,
officials said.
Coroner's officials confirmed that William
Schell, 63, of Woodside, died after he collapsed
of an apparent heart attack at 8:40 a.m. PST, 40
minutes after the race began.
A coroner's spokesman, who asked not to be
identified, said Schell had a history of heart
trouble.
"He knew he had a bad heart, and he was
trying to make it stronger. But he was stupid to
run in a race like this," the spokesman said, add
ing that Schell was stricken as he ran through
Golden Gate Park, the final leg of the competi
tion.
Today's Weather
Sunny today with after morning low clouds.
Low clouds persisting along the coast. Highs in
the upper 50s and 60s. Westerly winds 15 to 30
mph mainly in the afternoon. Low clouds to
night and tomorrow along the coast extending
locally inland during night and morning, clear
ing tomorrow.

The Argentine military command reported that British Sea Harrier
war planes attacked "without consequence" Port Darwin located on a
sound in the center of East Falkland and Zorro Bay, just south of Port
Darwin. A military communique gave no further details.
The attacks on the ships in tnr Falkland Sound appeared aimed at cut
ting all communications between Argentine forces on the two main
Falkland islands
The repeated attacks on the Stanley airfield
are aimed at preventing its use by even light
planes for supply of an estimated 5000 or more
Argentine troops in the vicinity, at destroying
military installations including mobile radar be
lieved to be used to direct Argentine air strikes
against the British fleet and harassing the Ar
gentine forces to reduce their readiness to de
fend against a British assault on the islands.
A senior British government source said yes
terday that such attacks and hit-and-run com
mando raids like the one on Pebble Island Fri
day night and Saturday morning will continue
"over the next few days" along with the nego
tiations at the United Nations. "There will be in
creasing harassment of the Argentine forces
one way or another," the source said.
Declaring that the U.N. negotiations must
"come to a head one way or another" this
week, British Defense Secretary John Nott yes
terday warned, "If we fail to achieve a peaceful
settlement, then we have no other choice but to
pursue the military options much more vigor
ously than we have up to now."
Haig denies Greece security
pledge in possible conflict
Athens, Greece — Secretary of State Alex
ander Haig, seeking to calm Greek fears of Turk
ish military strength, said yesterday that the
United States would oppose any "first use of
force" in the Aegean Sea region just as it has in
the Falkland Islands.
Completing a three-day swing through the
Aegean area, Haig again refused to give an ex
plicit U.S. security guarantee to Greece as its
government had requested. He also refused
again to endorse specifically a past U.S. promise
to "make a major effort" to prevent military
hostilities between the two Aegean nations
who are North Atlantic Treaty Organization al
lies.
But he then volunteered, in response to a
question at a press conference, that "the U.S.
view (of any Aegean conflict) is no different
than it is in the Falkland question" where Wash
ington has sided wit Britain against Argentina.
"We reject the first use of force to resolve any
dispute" Haig added.
Greek-Turkish tensions have increased after
the election seven months ago of socialist Prime
Minister Andreas Papandreou here. He has
broken off talks with Turkey on Aegean territo
rial water disputes and interrupted some
progress that had been under way regarding
Cyprus over which the two nations went to the
brink of war in 1974.
Greece has more than 2300 islands in the Ae
gean Sea, many of which are far closer to the
Turkish coast than to the Greek mainland.
Papandreou has strongly supported Britain's
stand against Argentina in the Falklands clash
because, in a clear parallel to the situation in the
South Atlantic, Greece fears Turkish claims on
its island possessions
"The task ahead is to resolve issues which
cause understandable concern" in both Greece
and Turkey, Haig said. While the United States
will not be a mediator, "we will try to be a
catalyst in this effort," he added.
Americans fear nuclear bomb
use, favor parity with Soviets
New York — Three of four Americans say any
use of nuclear weapons would lead to a full
scale world war, according to the latest As
sociated Press-NBC News poll.
A majority also said they think falling behind

the Soviet Union in arms production increases
the chances of war.
The nationwide telephone poll was a scien
tific random sampling of 1599 adults on May
10-11.
Seventy-five percent said they think any use
of nuclear weapons would lead to a full-scale
world war, while 17 percent said they think a
limited nuclear war is possible and 8 percent
were not sure.
Fifty percent said the United States should
move toward nuclear disarmament only if the
Soviets agree to disarm as well, while 28 percent
said the U.S. should not disarm at all. Fourteen
percent said the United States should disarm on
its own; 8 percent were not sure.
And 83 percent said the favor a freeze on the
production of nuclear weapons in both the
United States and the Soviet Union.
At his news conference last week, President
Ronald Reagan reiterated his position that the
U.S. nuclear arsenal lags behind the Soviets' and
must be built up to bring the Soviets into an
arms agreement.
In the poll, 69 percent said they think the
chances of war would increase if the United
States stopped producing nuclear weapons but
the Soviet Union continued to produce them.
Ten percent said a unilateral U.S. halt would de
crease the chances of war, 11 percent said it
would make no difference and 10 percent were
not sure.
Seventy-six percent said it is either very im
portant or somewhat important to national de
fense for the United States to produce as many
nuclear weapons as the Soviet Union does.
At the same time, 84 percent said they think
children should be taught in school about the
bad effects of nuclear war. More than half of
those people said teaching about the bad ef
fects of nuclear war should begin in grade
school.
However, a 51 percent majority said they
would not like to see the federal government
spend more money on civil defense programs
in the event of a nuclear war.
Argentines follow rumors
Buenos Aires, Argentina — A mysterious item
appeared on the front page of La Razon, an af
ternoon newspaper here, May 5. Headlined,
"The Hermes Sunk?" the story said that, accord
ing to the Soviet News agency Tass, the British
aircraft carrier had been bombed and sunk by
Argentine airplanes.
No official comment came from the Argen
tine junta. But in the press room of the Sheraton
Hotel, an Air Force official confided, "We did it
with a little Pucara plane that dropped six
bombs and 32 rockets. We think the Hermes is
severely damaged."
In the last two weeks, not a day has passed
without speculation in the news media over the
fate of the Hermes, the pride of the British navy
and flagship of its task force, with 1350 men
aboard. One paper indicated that Rear Adm.
Sandy Woodward, the task force commander,
may be dead. Reports from Venezuela had the
Hermes limping toward Curacao in the Carib
bean for repairs.
U.S. used Nazis as spies
Washington — State Department officials
smuggled more than 300 Russian-born Nazi col
laborators into the United States after World
War II and helped them become U.S. citizens
and obtain jobs in return for their participation
in Soviet spying operations during the Cold
War, the CBS television program "60 Minutes"
reported yesterday.

The smuggling proceeded despite orders by
Presidents Franklin Roosevelt and Harry
Truman barring immigration of Nazi war crimi
nals, and intelligence agencies continued to
cover it up as recently as 1978 during a con
gressional investigation, according to a former
Justice Department prosecutor interviewed on
the program.
"We had one unit of the government out
trying to prosecute the Nazis and other units of
the government trying to secret the informa
tion," said John Loftus, a Boston attorney who
left the Justice Department's Office of Special
Investigations last year. President Jimmy Carter
created the office in 1980 to root out Nazi war
criminals hiding in the United States.
"We later established that the files pertaining
to the Nazi immigration had been withheld
from Congress, from the courts, from the CIA
and from the local agents of the Immigration
Service," Loftus said.
One dies in Bay to Breakers
San Francisco — Rod Dixon of New Zealand
set what could be a new course record yester
day to win the 71st annual Bay to Breakers run.
One runner collapsed and died during the race,
officials said.
Coroner's officials confirmed that William
Schell, 63, of Woodside, died after he collapsed
of an apparent heart attack at 8:40 a.m. PST, 40
minutes after the race began.
A coroner's spokesman, who asked not to be
identified, said Schell had a history of heart
trouble.
"He knew he had a bad heart, and he was
trying to make it stronger. But he was stupid to
run in a race like this," the spokesman said, add
ing that Schell was stricken as he ran through
Golden Gate Park, the final leg of the competi
tion.
Today's Weather
Sunny today with after morning low clouds.
Low clouds persisting along the coast. Highs in
the upper 50s and 60s. Westerly winds 15 to 30
mph mainly in the afternoon. Low clouds to

British prepare islands for invasion
London — British forces continued "softening up" Argentine de
fenses for a counterinvasion of the Falkland Islands yesterday as the
government prepared its strategy for a climactic week of negotiations at
the United Nations viewed here as the last opportunity for a diplomatic
resolution of the crisis.
Sea Harrier jets from the British naval task force off the Falklands yes
terday attacked two Argentine ships in harbors on the Falkland Sound
between East and West Falkland islands, the Defense Ministry here an
nounced. British correspondents with the task force said other Harriers
attacked Argentine military installations around the Stanley airfield ear
ly yesterday for the third time in three days.
The Argentine ships were bombed and strafed, a Defense Ministry
spokesman said. "We have no firm indication of the extent of the dam
age caused, although the crew of one of the vessels was subsequently
seen to be abandoning ship."
Two Harriers also attacked an Argentine merchant ship, the Rio
Carcarania, off East Falkland island near the port of Darwin, British cor
respondents reported, and pilots in two Harriers following behind saw
survivors on their way to shore in lifeboats.
Two more Harriers attacked another merchant ship moored in Fox
Bay on West Falkland island, according to British Broadcasting Corp.
correspondent Brian Hanarahan on the British aircraft carrier Hermes.
Hanarahan said the ship fired back, hitting one of the Harriers in the tail,
but the damage was repairable and the pilot was unhurt.

Haig denies Greece security
pledge in possible conflict
Athens, Greece — Secretary of State Alex
ander Haig, seeking to calm Greek fears of Turk
ish military strength, said yesterday that the
United States would oppose any "first use of
force" in the Aegean Sea region just as it has in
the Falkland Islands.
Completing a three-day swing through the
Aegean area, Haig again refused to give an ex
plicit U.S. security guarantee to Greece as its
government had requested. He also refused
again to endorse specifically a past U.S. promise
to "make a major effort" to prevent military
hostilities between the two Aegean nations
who are North Atlantic Treaty Organization al
lies.
But he then volunteered, in response to a
question at a press conference, that "the U.S.
view (of any Aegean conflict) is no different
than it is in the Falkland question" where Wash
ington has sided wit Britain against Argentina.
"We reject the first use of force to resolve any
dispute" Haig added.
Greek-Turkish tensions have increased after
the election seven months ago of socialist Prime
Minister Andreas Papandreou here. He has
broken off talks with Turkey on Aegean territo
rial water disputes and interrupted some
progress that had been under way regarding
Cyprus over which the two nations went to the
brink of war in 1974.
Greece has more than 2300 islands in the Ae
gean Sea, many of which are far closer to the
Turkish coast than to the Greek mainland.
Papandreou has strongly supported Britain's
stand against Argentina in the Falklands clash
because, in a clear parallel to the situation in the
South Atlantic, Greece fears Turkish claims on
its island possessions
"The task ahead is to resolve issues which
cause understandable concern" in both Greece
and Turkey, Haig said. While the United States
will not be a mediator, "we will try to be a
catalyst in this effort," he added.
Americans fear nuclear bomb
use, favor parity with Soviets
New York — Three of four Americans say any
use of nuclear weapons would lead to a full
scale world war, according to the latest As
sociated Press-NBC News poll.
A majority also said they think falling behind

the Soviet Union in arms production increases
the chances of war.
The nationwide telephone poll was a scien
tific random sampling of 1599 adults on May
10-11.
Seventy-five percent said they think any use
of nuclear weapons would lead to a full-scale
world war, while 17 percent said they think a
limited nuclear war is possible and 8 percent
were not sure.
Fifty percent said the United States should
move toward nuclear disarmament only if the
Soviets agree to disarm as well, while 28 percent
said the U.S. should not disarm at all. Fourteen
percent said the United States should disarm on
its own; 8 percent were not sure.
And 83 percent said the favor a freeze on the
production of nuclear weapons in both the
United States and the Soviet Union.
At his news conference last week, President
Ronald Reagan reiterated his position that the
U.S. nuclear arsenal lags behind the Soviets' and
must be built up to bring the Soviets into an
arms agreement.
In the poll, 69 percent said they think the
chances of war would increase if the United
States stopped producing nuclear weapons but
the Soviet Union continued to produce them.
Ten percent said a unilateral U.S. halt would de
crease the chances of war, 11 percent said it
would make no difference and 10 percent were
not sure.
Seventy-six percent said it is either very im
portant or somewhat important to national de
fense for the United States to produce as many
nuclear weapons as the Soviet Union does.
At the same time, 84 percent said they think
children should be taught in school about the
bad effects of nuclear war. More than half of
those people said teaching about the bad ef
fects of nuclear war should begin in grade
school.
However, a 51 percent majority said they
would not like to see the federal government
spend more money on civil defense programs
in the event of a nuclear war.
Argentines follow rumors
Buenos Aires, Argentina — A mysterious item
appeared on the front page of La Razon, an af
ternoon newspaper here, May 5. Headlined,
"The Hermes Sunk?" the story said that, accord
ing to the Soviet News agency Tass, the British
aircraft carrier had been bombed and sunk by
Argentine airplanes.
No official comment came from the Argen
tine junta. But in the press room of the Sheraton
Hotel, an Air Force official confided, "We did it
with a little Pucara plane that dropped six
bombs and 32 rockets. We think the Hermes is
severely damaged."
In the last two weeks, not a day has passed
without speculation in the news media over the
fate of the Hermes, the pride of the British navy
and flagship of its task force, with 1350 men
aboard. One paper indicated that Rear Adm.
Sandy Woodward, the task force commander,
may be dead. Reports from Venezuela had the
Hermes limping toward Curacao in the Carib
bean for repairs.
U.S. used Nazis as spies
Washington — State Department officials
smuggled more than 300 Russian-born Nazi col
laborators into the United States after World
War II and helped them become U.S. citizens
and obtain jobs in return for their participation
in Soviet spying operations during the Cold
War, the CBS television program "60 Minutes"
reported yesterday.

The smuggling proceeded despite orders by
Presidents Franklin Roosevelt and Harry
Truman barring immigration of Nazi war crimi
nals, and intelligence agencies continued to
cover it up as recently as 1978 during a con
gressional investigation, according to a former
Justice Department prosecutor interviewed on
the program.
"We had one unit of the government out
trying to prosecute the Nazis and other units of
the government trying to secret the informa
tion," said John Loftus, a Boston attorney who
left the Justice Department's Office of Special
Investigations last year. President Jimmy Carter
created the office in 1980 to root out Nazi war
criminals hiding in the United States.
"We later established that the files pertaining
to the Nazi immigration had been withheld
from Congress, from the courts, from the CIA
and from the local agents of the Immigration
Service," Loftus said.
One dies in Bay to Breakers
San Francisco — Rod Dixon of New Zealand
set what could be a new course record yester
day to win the 71st annual Bay to Breakers run.
One runner collapsed and died during the race,
officials said.
Coroner's officials confirmed that William
Schell, 63, of Woodside, died after he collapsed
of an apparent heart attack at 8:40 a.m. PST, 40
minutes after the race began.
A coroner's spokesman, who asked not to be
identified, said Schell had a history of heart
trouble.
"He knew he had a bad heart, and he was
trying to make it stronger. But he was stupid to
run in a race like this," the spokesman said, add
ing that Schell was stricken as he ran through
Golden Gate Park, the final leg of the competi
tion.
Today's Weather

British prepare islands for invasion
London — British forces continued "softening up" Argentine de
fenses for a counterinvasion of the Falkland Islands yesterday as the
government prepared its strategy for a climactic week of negotiations at
the United Nations viewed here as the last opportunity for a diplomatic
resolution of the crisis.
Sea Harrier jets from the British naval task force off the Falklands yes
terday attacked two Argentine ships in harbors on the Falkland Sound
between East and West Falkland islands, the Defense Ministry here an
nounced. British correspondents with the task force said other Harriers
attacked Argentine military installations around the Stanley airfield ear
ly yesterday for the third time in three days.
The Argentine ships were bombed and strafed, a Defense Ministry
spokesman said. "We have no firm indication of the extent of the dam
age caused, although the crew of one of the vessels was subsequently
seen to be abandoning ship."
Two Harriers also attacked an Argentine merchant ship, the Rio
Carcarania, off East Falkland island near the port of Darwin, British cor
respondents reported, and pilots in two Harriers following behind saw
survivors on their way to shore in lifeboats.
Two more Harriers attacked another merchant ship moored in Fox
Bay on West Falkland island, according to British Broadcasting Corp.
correspondent Brian Hanarahan on the British aircraft carrier Hermes.
Hanarahan said the ship fired back, hitting one of the Harriers in the tail,
but the damage was repairable and the pilot was unhurt.
The Argentine military command reported that British Sea Harrier
war planes attacked "without consequence" Port Darwin located on a
sound in the center of East Falkland and Zorro Bay, just south of Port
Darwin. A military communique gave no further details.
The attacks on the ships in tnr Falkland Sound appeared aimed at cut
ting all communications between Argentine forces on the two main
Falkland islands
The repeated attacks on the Stanley airfield
are aimed at preventing its use by even light
planes for supply of an estimated 5000 or more
Argentine troops in the vicinity, at destroying
military installations including mobile radar be
lieved to be used to direct Argentine air strikes
against the British fleet and harassing the Ar
gentine forces to reduce their readiness to de
fend against a British assault on the islands.
A senior British government source said yes
terday that such attacks and hit-and-run com
mando raids like the one on Pebble Island Fri
day night and Saturday morning will continue
"over the next few days" along with the nego
tiations at the United Nations. "There will be in
creasing harassment of the Argentine forces
one way or another," the source said.
Declaring that the U.N. negotiations must
"come to a head one way or another" this
week, British Defense Secretary John Nott yes
terday warned, "If we fail to achieve a peaceful
settlement, then we have no other choice but to
pursue the military options much more vigor
ously than we have up to now."
