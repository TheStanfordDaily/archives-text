# ODUS split leaves few sure of effects
## 
### Heather Millar Senior staff writer 
Although the decision has been
made to dissolve the Office of the
Dean of Undergraduate Studies
(ODUS) and split that dean's duties
between two new administrators be
ginning next fall, no one claims to
know exactly how this division will af
fect undergraduate students and the
ODUS programs — such as SWOPSI,
Undergraduate Specials and the Aca
demic Information Center — they
utilize.
"We have a blueprint but not the
house," Herant Katchadourian, vice
provost and dean of undergraduate
studies said of his office's division be
tween a new Associate Dean for Un
dergraduate Programs in the School
of Humanities and Sciences (H & S)
and a new Vice-Provost for Under
graduate Education. The mechanics
of the administrative change have
been deliberately kept tentative until
the new officers can be appointed
and the transition begun, according
to the report of the ad-hoc commit
tee which last week advised Provost
Albert Hastorf to disband ODUS.
"It looks good on paper now," said
Linda Gonzalez, SCIRE co-director.
"But nobody knows what's going to
happen next year when they start
switching things around."
People working in ODUS-adminis
tered programs have told the Daily
they are breathing easier since it
seems that the change will not affect
their programs as drastically as rumor
had predicted. But until the appoint
ment of the associate dean, expected
by the end of spring quarter or early

summer quarter, they are adopting a
wait-and-see attitude.
"It's really hard to say what's going
to happen until the associate dean is
appointed," said Laura Selznick, di
rector of Undergraduate Specials.
"There are always differences when
you have new people super
vising ... no one issurewhatthe ef
fect on the staff will be."
Undergraduates will likely feel the
influence of the associate dean more
directly than that of the vice-provost
when the University begins trans
ferring the purview of academic ser
vices from ODUS to H & S. While the
vice-provost will take a more active
part in determining University-wide
policy, the associate dean will man
age the programs undergraduates
patronize on a day-to-day basis. But
the exact line along which the labor
will be divided will not be drawn un
til the officers are appointed.
Staff members say they feel as if
their programs are in limbo, but they
aren't sure whether or not this will af
fect undergraduates directly. "I care
about what the students think," said
Carolyn Walker, director of the
Learning Assistance Center. "I don't
think students know now that I re
port to a dean of undergraduate stud
ies. I wonder if they will notice when
I am reporting to an associate dean of
undergraduate programs in H & S."
"If nothing else, we have a lot of
questions, " said Andre Burnett, co
director of SWOPSI. "Everything is
basically up in the air."
As budget constraints squeeze
tighter around the University, fi
nance may emerge as a major
challenge to the new system. Aca
demic services are now funded out of
a separate ODUS budget. Some di
rectors have told the Daily they worry
that once their programs are inte
grated into the H & S administration,
the programs will be outdistanced in
the race for funds by large H & S aca
demic departments such as English
and Chemistry. But Katchadourian
said the ODUS programs will be
transferred, budget and all, to H & S.
Any revenue resulting from cuts in
program budgets, or even discon
tinued programs, will be "radio
actively tagged" to a Provostial
Educational Innovation Fund and not
go into H & S funds, according to
Hastorf. Hastorf said this closed loop
will eliminate any motivation for the
departments to raid program
budgets. However, if the provost
judges departments the best en
vironment for educational innova
tion, departments may raid extra-de
partmental funds indirectly, perhaps
decreasing the number of educa
tional opportunities offered the un
dergraduate.
Extra-departmental programs hay
also have to compete with depart
ments for credibility. Katchadourian
has said that ultimately the Univer
sity's credibility rests with the faculty
and so the University has decided to
lodge the administration of the un
dergraduate program in H & S which
represents a majority of the under
graduates. Many SWOPSI and Un
dergraduate Specials courses draw
teachers from outside the ranks of
the faculty.
Not only may extra-departmental
programs have to compete with es
tablished H& S departments, but
questions have been raised regard
ing departments outside that school.
H & S enrolls 80 percent of the un
dergraduate student body, but what
will be the fate of interdisciplinary
majors, such as Urban Studies, which
span departments, and the Schools of
Earth Sciences and Engineering, all of
which enroll substantial numbers of
undergraduates?
According to the ad-hoc commit
tee's report, people have suggested
that because the associate dean will

work out of H & S, other schools
which enroll undergraduates will get
short shrift.
The backers of the program deny
this. Katchadourian said basing the
associate dean in H & S "in no way
implies that other programs are less
important."
Civil Engineering Prof. Leonard
Ortolano, who directs the Urban
Studies program, said, "Having the
director of the Urban Studies pro
gram in the School of Engineering
and the associate dean in H & S main
tains the balance of the program in
general."
Others have said that dividing the
dean of undergraduate studies' re
sponsibilities between two people
might upset the balance between un
dergraduate and graduate study as
well as the balance between the dif
ferent schools. Will the coalition of
an associate dean and a vice-provost
be able to stand up to a Dean of
Graduate Studies and Research?
Gerald Lieherman, dean of gradu
ate studies and research, said the ad
ministrative needs of graduate and
undergraduate education are com
pletely different, because the pro
grams are so different. "Graduate
student education is narrow. Stu
dents by and large don't get out of
their departments. The students
don't get the broad education you
get at the undergrad level,"
Leiberman said. "If you try to draw a
comparison between the
two ... the model breaks down."
The relationship between under
graduate and graduate education
should not be viewed in adversarial
terms, according to Hastorf. "We are
all advocates of undergraduate
education," said Hastorf.
Katchadourian said he has no wor
ries that undergraduate education
will suffer from loss of clout in the
next two or three years because the
"cast of characters" now involved in
determining University policy is, he
feels, very concerned about the un
dergraduate program.
The dean admits, however, that
this may not always be the case. "In
four or five years ... the cast of
characters and their concerns may
change," said Katchadourian. "I
don't think there's any way of saying
that we've found the final solution
and we can all go to sleep now."

the race for funds by large H & S aca
demic departments such as English
and Chemistry. But Katchadourian
said the ODUS programs will be
transferred, budget and all, to H & S.
Any revenue resulting from cuts in
program budgets, or even discon
tinued programs, will be "radio
actively tagged" to a Provostial
Educational Innovation Fund and not
go into H & S funds, according to
Hastorf. Hastorf said this closed loop
will eliminate any motivation for the
departments to raid program
budgets. However, if the provost
judges departments the best en
vironment for educational innova
tion, departments may raid extra-de
partmental funds indirectly, perhaps
decreasing the number of educa
tional opportunities offered the un
dergraduate.
Extra-departmental programs hay
also have to compete with depart
ments for credibility. Katchadourian
has said that ultimately the Univer
sity's credibility rests with the faculty
and so the University has decided to
lodge the administration of the un
dergraduate program in H & S which
represents a majority of the under
graduates. Many SWOPSI and Un
dergraduate Specials courses draw
teachers from outside the ranks of
the faculty.
Not only may extra-departmental
programs have to compete with es
tablished H& S departments, but
questions have been raised regard
ing departments outside that school.
H & S enrolls 80 percent of the un
dergraduate student body, but what
will be the fate of interdisciplinary
majors, such as Urban Studies, which
span departments, and the Schools of
Earth Sciences and Engineering, all of
which enroll substantial numbers of
undergraduates?
According to the ad-hoc commit
tee's report, people have suggested
that because the associate dean will

work out of H & S, other schools
which enroll undergraduates will get
short shrift.
The backers of the program deny
this. Katchadourian said basing the
associate dean in H & S "in no way
implies that other programs are less
important."
Civil Engineering Prof. Leonard
Ortolano, who directs the Urban
Studies program, said, "Having the
director of the Urban Studies pro
gram in the School of Engineering
and the associate dean in H & S main
tains the balance of the program in
general."
Others have said that dividing the
dean of undergraduate studies' re
sponsibilities between two people
might upset the balance between un
dergraduate and graduate study as
well as the balance between the dif
ferent schools. Will the coalition of
an associate dean and a vice-provost
be able to stand up to a Dean of
Graduate Studies and Research?
Gerald Lieherman, dean of gradu
ate studies and research, said the ad
ministrative needs of graduate and
undergraduate education are com
pletely different, because the pro
grams are so different. "Graduate
student education is narrow. Stu
dents by and large don't get out of
their departments. The students
don't get the broad education you
get at the undergrad level,"
Leiberman said. "If you try to draw a
comparison between the
two ... the model breaks down."
The relationship between under
graduate and graduate education
should not be viewed in adversarial
terms, according to Hastorf. "We are
all advocates of undergraduate
education," said Hastorf.
Katchadourian said he has no wor
ries that undergraduate education
will suffer from loss of clout in the
next two or three years because the
"cast of characters" now involved in
determining University policy is, he
feels, very concerned about the un
dergraduate program.
The dean admits, however, that
this may not always be the case. "In
four or five years ... the cast of
characters and their concerns may
change," said Katchadourian. "I
don't think there's any way of saying
that we've found the final solution
and we can all go to sleep now."
Although the decision has been
made to dissolve the Office of the
Dean of Undergraduate Studies
(ODUS) and split that dean's duties
between two new administrators be
ginning next fall, no one claims to
know exactly how this division will af
fect undergraduate students and the
ODUS programs — such as SWOPSI,
Undergraduate Specials and the Aca
demic Information Center — they
utilize.
"We have a blueprint but not the
house," Herant Katchadourian, vice
provost and dean of undergraduate
studies said of his office's division be
tween a new Associate Dean for Un
dergraduate Programs in the School
of Humanities and Sciences (H & S)
and a new Vice-Provost for Under
graduate Education. The mechanics
of the administrative change have
been deliberately kept tentative until
the new officers can be appointed
and the transition begun, according
to the report of the ad-hoc commit
tee which last week advised Provost
Albert Hastorf to disband ODUS.
"It looks good on paper now," said
Linda Gonzalez, SCIRE co-director.
"But nobody knows what's going to
happen next year when they start
switching things around."
People working in ODUS-adminis
tered programs have told the Daily
they are breathing easier since it
seems that the change will not affect
their programs as drastically as rumor
had predicted. But until the appoint
ment of the associate dean, expected
by the end of spring quarter or early

summer quarter, they are adopting a
wait-and-see attitude.
"It's really hard to say what's going
to happen until the associate dean is
appointed," said Laura Selznick, di
rector of Undergraduate Specials.
"There are always differences when
you have new people super
vising ... no one issurewhatthe ef
fect on the staff will be."
Undergraduates will likely feel the
influence of the associate dean more
directly than that of the vice-provost
when the University begins trans
ferring the purview of academic ser
vices from ODUS to H & S. While the
vice-provost will take a more active
part in determining University-wide
policy, the associate dean will man
age the programs undergraduates
patronize on a day-to-day basis. But
the exact line along which the labor
will be divided will not be drawn un
til the officers are appointed.
Staff members say they feel as if
their programs are in limbo, but they
aren't sure whether or not this will af
fect undergraduates directly. "I care
about what the students think," said
Carolyn Walker, director of the
Learning Assistance Center. "I don't
think students know now that I re
port to a dean of undergraduate stud
ies. I wonder if they will notice when
I am reporting to an associate dean of
undergraduate programs in H & S."
"If nothing else, we have a lot of
questions, " said Andre Burnett, co
director of SWOPSI. "Everything is
basically up in the air."
As budget constraints squeeze
tighter around the University, fi
nance may emerge as a major
challenge to the new system. Aca
demic services are now funded out of
a separate ODUS budget. Some di
rectors have told the Daily they worry
that once their programs are inte
grated into the H & S administration,
the programs will be outdistanced in
the race for funds by large H & S aca
demic departments such as English
and Chemistry. But Katchadourian
