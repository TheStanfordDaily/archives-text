# ODUS split leaves few sure of effects

### Heather Millar Senior staff writer 
Although the decision has been
made to dissolve the Office of the
Dean of Undergraduate Studies
(ODUS) and split that dean's duties
between two new administrators be
ginning next fall, no one claims to
know exactly how this division will af
fect undergraduate students and the
ODUS programs — such as SWOPSI,
Undergraduate Specials and the Aca
demic Information Center — they
utilize.
"We have a blueprint but not the
house," Herant Katchadourian, vice
provost and dean of undergraduate
studies said of his office's division be
tween a new Associate Dean for Un
dergraduate Programs in the School
of Humanities and Sciences (H & S)
and a new Vice-Provost for Under
graduate Education. The mechanics
of the administrative change have
been deliberately kept tentative until
the new officers can be appointed
and the transition begun, according
to the report of the ad-hoc commit
tee which last week advised Provost
Albert Hastorf to disband ODUS.
"It looks good on paper now," said
Linda Gonzalez, SCIRE co-director.
"But nobody knows what's going to
happen next year when they start
switching things around."
People working in ODUS-adminis
tered programs have told the Daily
they are breathing easier since it
seems that the change will not affect
their programs as drastically as rumor
had predicted. But until the appoint
ment of the associate dean, expected
by the end of spring quarter or early

summer quarter, they are adopting a
wait-and-see attitude.
"It's really hard to say what's going
to happen until the associate dean is
appointed," said Laura Selznick, di
rector of Undergraduate Specials.
"There are always differences when
you have new people super
vising ... no one issurewhatthe ef
fect on the staff will be."
Undergraduates will likely feel the
influence of the associate dean more
directly than that of the vice-provost
when the University begins trans
ferring the purview of academic ser
vices from ODUS to H & S. While the
vice-provost will take a more active
part in determining University-wide
policy, the associate dean will man
age the programs undergraduates
patronize on a day-to-day basis. But
the exact line along which the labor
will be divided will not be drawn un
til the officers are appointed.
Staff members say they feel as if
their programs are in limbo, but they
aren't sure whether or not this will af
fect undergraduates directly. "I care
about what the students think," said
Carolyn Walker, director of the
Learning Assistance Center. "I don't
think students know now that I re
port to a dean of undergraduate stud
ies. I wonder if they will notice when
I am reporting to an associate dean of
undergraduate programs in H & S."
"If nothing else, we have a lot of
questions, " said Andre Burnett, co
director of SWOPSI. "Everything is
basically up in the air."
As budget constraints squeeze
tighter around the University, fi
