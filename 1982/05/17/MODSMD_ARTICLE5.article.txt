# Friedman: deficits caused by politics
## 
### Ray Newman 
Miiton Friedman, disagreeing with
fellow Nobel laureate Kenneth Ar
row, said Friday at Bishop
Auditorium that the political institu
tions of the United States are biased
in favor of an ever-increasing federal
budget.
Friedman, prize-winning econo
mist and senior research fellow at the
Hoover Institute, said that he was a
"strong proponent" of a constitu
tional amendment that would bal
ance the budget and tie federal ex
penditures to a fixed percentage of
the gross national product.
Friedman said that the bias toward
higher budgets stems from the na
ture of the groups that are affected
by government spending and taxa
tion. "(Goverment) spending pro
grams .. . tend to have very concen
trated constituencies; taxes imposed
by the government tend to have very
diffuse constituencies. And there
fore ... the constituencies under the
spending programs ate heard much
more loudly in Washington than the
constituencies under taxes are
heard," he said.
Arrow, professor of operations re
search and economics here, found
no such bias in the budgetary proc
ess. He said that the ratio of federal
outlays to GNP was 20 percent during
the period 1971-1974and0n1y22 per
cent in 1981. "I find it somewhat hard

to think of this as a vast irresistible
trend leading to great changes," he
said.
Arrow said that the two percent
rise was due to increases in social se
curity and health program payments.
Those programs are costing more, he
said, because "a relatively larger
number of people are being re
warded."
Arrow said that he did not support
a constitutional amendment to bal
ance the budget, but rather pre
ferred to leave the budget in "the
hands of the electorate and its repre
sentatives." He called such an
amendment a "complicated set of
rigid constraints" that would "create
additional incentives for inefficien
cy."
Arrow said that there is an "implicit
restriction" on the size of the federal
deficit. He said that since 1971, the
deficit has been less than two percent
of GNP every year but one. "Increas
ing the deficit is thought of as costly,
politically costly," he said.
Friedman said that the two percent
figure imposed no restriction on
Congress. "Congress ... will spend
whatever the tax system will raise
plus enough more to give you a two
percent national income deficit," he
said.
One of the "concentrated consti
tuencies" that Friedman singled out
was students. Saying "it's no use talk
ing to students unless you get them
mad," Friedman claimed that by any
standard of equity the student loan
program is "disgraceful."
Friedman said that the student loan
program provided subsidized loans
to mostly middle- and upper-class
students by using revenues that are
paid in part by people from lower in
come classes. "If there is any pro
gram that transfers income from low
er to higher income classses, it is gov
ernment assistance in favor of higher
education, whatever form it takes,"
he said.
Senate Majority Leader Howard

Baker (R-Tenn.) was originally sched
uled to appear at the debate, but had
to cancel due to budget negotiations
in Washington. Baker sent a speech
that was read to the capacity crowd,
in which he said that the Senate is
aiming to pass its budget by Wednes
day and to pass the first concurrent
budget resolution by May 27.
Baker said that the deficit for the
next three years will total approx
imately $400 billion less than is cur
rently planned.
"There will be no budget adopted
until after the election," responded
Friedman. "It is not in the self-in
terest of either the Democrats or the
Republicans at the moment to pass
an intelligent, sensible, reasonable
budget before the elections, which is
why you're not going to have it,"he
said.
