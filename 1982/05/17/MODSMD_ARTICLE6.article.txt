### Jiri Weiss 
81-year-old Rep. Claude Pepper
(D-Fla.) assured an elderly audience
in San Carlos yesterday that "there
will be no social security cuts," add
ing, "I am seeing a new expression of
unity and power by the senior
citizens of this country."
Pepper, the oldest member of the
House and chairman of the House
Select Committee on Aging, spoke
together with Rep. Tom Lantos (D-
Calif.) on the lawn outside San
Carlos' new Senior Citizens Center. It
was the latest appearance in his cam
paign to mobilize elderly Americans,
following a stop in Lansing, Michi
gan, where he spoke to 6000 senior
citizens commemorating Senior
Power Day.
Pepper explained that while Presi
dent Ronald Reagan's budget plan
calls for a $25 billion cut from social
security over the next five years, even
the Republican leadership in the
Senate has refused to introduce the
budget.
Pepper charged that the adminis
tration is spreading misinformation
ah'i!it social security. "Social security
is not bankrupt," Pepper argued,
"(that) is no more true than saying
when you come to the end of a fiscal
year, the government of the United

States is bankrupt. All that is wrong is
that Congress has not appropriated
the necessary funds."
Pepper explained that the social
security system is currently in trouble
because it is overburdened with the
more than 10 million unemployed
and those who have had to retire ear
ly "who would otherwise be paying
into social security.
If it weren't for those demands we
would have no problem at all," Pep
per said, claiming that the real prob
lem is how to meet the emergency
when revenues sink so low because
of the economic situation.
Pepper said that to meet the cur
rent needs of the elderly, many of
whom depend on social security,
"what we (in the House) proposed to
do and the Senate has already author
ized it, is to borrow some money
from the Medicare fund, which has a
surplus, to help out the Old Age and
Survivors Insurance." Old Age and
Survivors Insurance and Medicare
are both paid for out of social secur
ity taxes, Pepper said.
Pepper said that according to Rob
ert Bald, former director of thr Soc lal
Security Administration, "there
would be a great surplus" by 1990 in
the Old Age and Survivors fund be
cause of demographic reasons. "We

can pay back with interest any loans
that we make in the interim," Pepper
said.
In addition, Pepper claims, House
Democrats have sought to helpsocial
security out of general funds but
have been prevented from doing so

by the Republicans. "The trick of the
Republicans," Pepper said, "is that
they want to come in and get the so
cial security disassociated (from) the
overall budget" to stop the Demo
crats from helping Social Security out
of general funds.
