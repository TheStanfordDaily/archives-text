## Japan marks return of Okinawa 
### Los Angeles Times 
Tokyo — Ten years ago, the United
States became one of the few nations in
history to return in peace territory won in
war and on Saturday the beneficiary of that
act, Japan, took special note of the an
niversary.
That the territory, now the Japanese pre
fecture (state) of Okinawa, "lost in war was
returned in peace is an extraordinary
event of world history," Prime Minister
Zenko Suzuki declared in a com
memorative ceremony in Tokyo.
"It is a manifestation of the friendship
that marks the relationship between Japan
and the United States" — a friendship that
should help the two nations solve prob
lems of trade friction which they now face,
Suzuki said.
Ambassador Mike Mansfield called the
return of Okinawa, where 945,111
Japanese lived in 1972, the end of the post-
World War II era and the beginning of an
era of partnership and shared responsi

bility beween the United States and Japan.
Lessons learned in the process of working
out arrangements to return Okinawa to
Japan's control should be remembered to
day in seeking solutions to trade frictions,
he said.
Okinawa Gov. Junji Nishime, speaking
in a separate ceremony in Naha, said that
remarkable economic development had
occurred in the last 10 years, but added
that discrepancies between the island
chain prefecture and the mainland still
have not been eliminated in the aftermath
of 27 years of postwar U.S. rule.
Despite some $5.6 billion worth of na
tional government investment in Okinawa
since reversion, average incomes in the
prefecture now inhabited by 1.1 million
persons amount to only 70 percent of the
national level. Unemployment of around 6
percent is nearly triple Japan's average.
Suzuki, in Tokyo, pledged that the na
tional government would continue to up
grade living standards in Okinawa, but said

nothing about the U.S. military bases that
occupy more than one-fifth of the territory
of Okinawa Island.
It was the U.S. bases, which the United
States since 1945 has used to support mili
tary activities throughout Asia, and more
recently in the Middle East as well, that in
duced the United States to retain control
of Okinawa after ending a postwar oc
cupation of Japan in 1952.
Prodded by the late Prime Minister
Eisako Sato, then President Nixon agreed
to return the islands to Japan in a treaty
signed in June 1971. The actual turnover of
Okinawa — where 12,283 Americans and
110,071 Japanese military men and an esti
mated 150,000 Japanese civilians were
killed in the last major ground battle of
World War II in 1945 — came on May 15,
1972.
Until Israel returned the Sinai Peninsula
to Egypt last month, no other example of
territory won in wa} - being returned in
peace existed in modern history.
