# US-Argentine relations at a Soviet-tempting crossroad
## 
### Los Angeles Times 
Buenos Aires, Argentina — "The United States
has committed the greatest error in its history,"
Gonzalo Garcia, a Venezuelan envoy here said
of the U.S. decision to side with Britain in the
Falkland Islands crisis.
There is no doubt that Washington has lost
some friends by its stand. Argentina, of course, is
angriest. Secretary of State Alexander Haig, who
announced the U.S. decision two weeks ago,
was depicted on a magazine cover here this
week with fangs, and a Buenos Aires newspaper
printed a letter calling President Ronald Reagan
"Ronald the Rodent."
Asked about the U.S.-Argentine relationship,
Foreign Minister Nicanor Costa Mendez re
plied, "It is very bad."
Reagan said at his news conference Thursday
that although siding with Britain has hurt rela
tions with some countries,"! don't think there's
irreparable damage done." However, former
Secretary of State Henry Kissinger was more
dubious. "It cannot be denied," he told a news
conference in the Netherlands on Thursday,
"that the United States has paid a heavy price in
South America."
There is little Argentina can do to the United
States, which has never had much influence
here anyway, according to diplomats here.
A worsening of the Falklands conflict, how
ever, could shake up delicate balances in South
America and change the strategic picture in the
South Atlantic to the long-range disadvantage of
the United States. Diplomatic observers here
foresee these "worst case" developments:
—Prohibited from getting arms from the Unit
ed States and Britain's allies in Europe, Argentina
might turn to the Soviet Union for weapons, es
pecially if Britain regains the Falkland Islands by
force.
—If however, Argentina wins in the Falklands,
other Latin nations with territorial claims may be
encouraged to attempt similar armed adven
tures. Peru wants part of Chile, Ecuador wants
part of Peru, Venezuela claims part of Guyana
and Guatemala says all of Belize is Guatemalan
territory.
Taking sides on the Falklands issue, South
America might break up into blocs: Peru and
Venezuela siding with Argentina and Chile, for

instance, and Brazil and Colombia liningupwith
the United States. What Latin solidarity there is
could crumble, and if the Soviet Union gains in
fluence in Argentina, East-West relations could
enter South American politics.
Argentina could slip out of its present U.S. and
European trade orbit into one aligned with Sovi
et Bloc countries, and, for high-technology
goods, Japan. Argentina already sells 87 percent
of its grain to the Soviets.
The inter-American security system, based on
the Inter-American Reciprocal Assistance Treaty
— the Rio treaty of 1947 — could fall into disuse.
Even now a foreign diplomat here said, "It is
seen as an American invention to help the Unit
ed States."
Or, as the Buenos Aires daily Clarin put it:
"The treaty has a history of being effective
only when it was invoked by the United States ~
in the case of Korea, with our military assistance,
and in the Cuban missile crisis, by legitimizing
Washington's acts — but it is not effective when
one of the states of Latin America seeks its pro
tection."
Right now, it seems unlikely that the United
States could get the support of the Rio Treaty na
tions even if it wanted to endorse motherhood.
"For me there is no doubt that the history of
Latin America will divide into a history that is
pre-Malvinas and post-Malvinas, because rela
tions with the United States will have to be
looked at," Garcia, the Venezuelan diplomat
said.
Argentina insists, of course, that the Falkland?
(called the Malvinas here) were wrongfully
taken from it by Britain in 1833 and that Britain,
seeking to regain them, isthe aggressor —mean-
ing, under the Rio Treaty, the United States
should help Argentina, not Britain.
But although Argentina has received moral
support from the other Latin members of the
treaty group, it has gotten no military aid. Nor, is
it likely to get any, diplomats here say.
Although the United States came down on~tfre
side of Britain, Argentina has so frr taken no of
ficial action against U.S. businesses hereortfa3e
with the United States. Most of the biggest CCS.
multinational companies have subsidiaries In
Argentina. So far, It has been only American
journalists who have been harassed by the po
lice.
