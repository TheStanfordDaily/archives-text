## U.S. extradition treaty with Philippines criticized 
### Lauren Saunders 
The recently concluded United States-
Philippines (RP) Extradition Treaty, now
awaiting Senate ratification, has alarmed
many members of the Filipino communi
ty, congressmen and others who feel that
it may have far reaching implication for
civil liberties in the United States.
Many fearthatthe treaty would be used
to extradite political dissidents who op
pose the Marcos regime and martial law,
which was declared in the Philippines in
1972 and ostensibly lifted in early 1981.
"It (the treaty) is an extension of martial
law in the United States... If it is not pro
tested by U.S. citizens who value demo
cratic freedoms in their country ... then
the Filipinos see the American people as
inconsistent," said a Filipino member of
the Stanford community who asked not
to be identified.
Sen. James Jeffords (R-VT) agrees. In a
letter to the Senate Foreign Relations
Committee signed by 16 other con
gressmen, Jeffords wrote that "we would
create a repressive environment in our
country for those people who want to ex-

News analysis

press openly a dissatisfaction with their
country of origin."
Consistent with U.S. policy in extradi
tion cases, the proposed treaty stipulates
that "extradition shall not be granted if
the offense for which it is requested is a
political offense or is connected with a
political offense." However, the most
controversial provision of the treaty
would, in cases involving Filipinos, shift
from the Judiciary to the Executive
Branch the power to define what con

stitutes a "political" as opposed to a
"criminal" offense. Thus the Secretary of
State and not the courts would be respon
sible for making this distinction.
"We are disturbed by this transfer of
power. The Secretary of State is subject to
weighty political pressures, both from
home and abroad. He is not bound by the
rules of evidence and procedure," wrote
Jeffords. The political question is a "seri
ous problem ... (and) it is important that
habeus corpus is preserved," said Political
Science Prof. Jan Triska. He added, how
ever, that "even the courts can be in
fluenced."
There is some concern that the Secre
tary of State would use his discretion in
order to promote U.S. interests abroad.
The United States has large air and naval
bases in the Philippines and Marcos is
considered one of the strongest allies of
the United States in Asia. The treaty with
the Philippines is in line with the Reagan
administration strategy of supporting
anti-Communist governments in politi
cally sensitive regions.
Law Prof. John Barton said that "a treaty
like this is a somewhat arbitrary method
of reaching foreign policy objectives."
Jeffords wrote: "It is conceivable that
individuals of foreign origins living in our
country would become innocent instru
ments — and incidents — of American
foreign policy."
Pending ratification of the treaty, the
Philippine government has prepared a list
of 40 persons for extradition who have
been charged with violation of the "Anti-
Subversion Law." The Philippine Court
has defined a subversive organization as
"one organized for the purpose of over
throwing the government of the Republic
of the Philippines with the open or covert

assistance of a power by force, violence,
deceit or other illegal means. A person
becomes liable for subversion when he
knowingly, willfully, or by overt acts be
comes or remains a member of such sub
versive organization." Included in the top
priority section of those charged with vio
lation of this law is Rene Cruz, coordi
nator of the Coalition Against the Marcos
Dictatorship, who spoke here in Febru
ary.

-VT)

Under the treaty, the Secretary of State
could only extradite persons who have
been charged with crimes which are pun
ishable in the United States by at least a
one-year prison sentence. However, the
Secretary's decision "effectively ends the
extradition proceedings," said Barton
and would not be subject to review as
would be a court decision. Secretary of
State Alexander Haig has given no indica
tion of whether he would approve ex
tradition of Cruz and others if given the
power to do so under the treaty.
Many, however, feel that the courts
have become increasingly lenient in re
fusing to extradite criminal terrorists un

der the pretext of protecting political dis
sidents. In particular, they cite a case in
which U.S. district courts recently refused
a British request to extradite two alleged
Irish Republican Army sympathizers who
had been charged with a bombing and an
attempted murder, on the grounds that
the offenses were political rather than
criminal in nature.
The United States has been among na
tions advocating a tougher stance against
terrorism and proponents of the treaty
feel that the Secretary of State is more
capable of judging the political motives of
the states requesting extradition than are
the courts. Opponents, on the other
hand, claim that the Secretary of State is
much more susceptible to pressure from
foreign governments. Furthermore, this
transfer of power "shows an unwarranted
lack of faith in our judicial system," wrote
Jeffords.
In addition, Dr. Guston Ortigas, ex
ecutive director of the Movement for a
Free Philippines, said that he believes
"the word 'terrorist' has been used quite
loosely . .. against anyone involved in an
armed struggle."
"One man's terrorist is another man's
freedom fighter," Barton agreed. He
added that although a bombing in Cali
fornia would be immediately classified as
a crime, "our willingness to accept politi
cal violence in the U.S. may be less" than
in countries like the Philippines where
there are fewer democratic options in
voicing opposition to the government.
Another consideration is the ap
propriateness of any extradition treaty
with a country where human rights and
the integrity of the court system are ques
tionable.
"It is imperative to be completely con

fident that justice is consistently served by
a government with which we have an ex
traordinary treaty," wrote Jeffords. Or
tigas claimed that in the Philippines, some
prisoners are "tortured ... subjected to
sub-standard prison conditions ... and
their rights are severely curtailed."
In addition to Marcos' importance as an
ally, the Philippines may also have been
chosen as a trial balloon for this type of
treaty, since it is a country which is not in
the political limelight and which receives
relatively little press coverage. A similar
treaty with El Salvador, for example,
would be hotly debated, even though the
situations of the two countries do not dif
fer greatly.
"Once the Extradition Treaty is
passed ... it is a testing ground to see
how the Senate would react to this sub
ject ... It would be easy for the State De
partment to pass similar treaties with oth
er governments," said the Stanford stu
dent from the Phillipines.
In fact, the U.S.-R P Treaty is not the
only piece of legislation now before Con
gress dealing with extradition. One Sen
ate bill sponsored by Sen. Strom
Thurmond (R-NC) contains a similar but
even more explicit provision giving the
Secretary of State the power to define
criminal versus political offenses. This bill
would apply to extradition cases from all
nations with which the United States has
treaties.
Barton said he doubts that the Senate
will ratify the U.S.-R P Extradition Treaty
or that the Congress will pass the new leg
islation. Furthermore, this shift in power
"raises real constitutional problems" and
it is not at all clear whether or not the Su
preme Court would accept such a
change, he said.

The United States has large air and naval

Law Prof. John Barton said that "a treaty

Jeffords wrote: "It is conceivable that

Pending ratification of the treaty, the
Philippine government has prepared a list
of 40 persons for extradition who have
been charged with violation of the "Anti-
Subversion Law." The Philippine Court
has defined a subversive organization as
"one organized for the purpose of over
throwing the government of the Republic
of the Philippines with the open or covert

assistance of a power by force, violence,
deceit or other illegal means. A person
becomes liable for subversion when he
knowingly, willfully, or by overt acts be
comes or remains a member of such sub
versive organization." Included in the top
priority section of those charged with vio

nator of the Coalition Against the Marcos
Dictatorship, who spoke here in Febru

— Senator James Jeffords (R
-VT)

Under the treaty, the Secretary of State
could only extradite persons who have
been charged with crimes which are pun
ishable in the United States by at least a
one-year prison sentence. However, the
Secretary's decision "effectively ends the
extradition proceedings," said Barton
and would not be subject to review as
would be a court decision. Secretary of
State Alexander Haig has given no indica
tion of whether he would approve ex
tradition of Cruz and others if given the
power to do so under the treaty.
Many, however, feel that the courts
have become increasingly lenient in re
fusing to extradite criminal terrorists un

der the pretext of protecting political dis
sidents. In particular, they cite a case in
which U.S. district courts recently refused
a British request to extradite two alleged
Irish Republican Army sympathizers who
had been charged with a bombing and an
attempted murder, on the grounds that
the offenses were political rather than
criminal in nature.
The United States has been among na
tions advocating a tougher stance against
terrorism and proponents of the treaty
feel that the Secretary of State is more
capable of judging the political motives of
the states requesting extradition than are
the courts. Opponents, on the other
hand, claim that the Secretary of State is
much more susceptible to pressure from
foreign governments. Furthermore, this
transfer of power "shows an unwarranted
lack of faith in our judicial system," wrote
Jeffords.
In addition, Dr. Guston Ortigas, ex
ecutive director of the Movement for a
Free Philippines, said that he believes
"the word 'terrorist' has been used quite
loosely . .. against anyone involved in an
armed struggle."
"One man's terrorist is another man's
freedom fighter," Barton agreed. He
added that although a bombing in Cali
fornia would be immediately classified as
a crime, "our willingness to accept politi
cal violence in the U.S. may be less" than
in countries like the Philippines where
there are fewer democratic options in
voicing opposition to the government.
Another consideration is the ap
propriateness of any extradition treaty
with a country where human rights and
the integrity of the court system are ques
tionable.
"It is imperative to be completely con

fident that justice is consistently served by
a government with which we have an ex
traordinary treaty," wrote Jeffords. Or
tigas claimed that in the Philippines, some
prisoners are "tortured ... subjected to
sub-standard prison conditions ... and
their rights are severely curtailed."
In addition to Marcos' importance as an
ally, the Philippines may also have been
chosen as a trial balloon for this type of
treaty, since it is a country which is not in
the political limelight and which receives
relatively little press coverage. A similar
treaty with El Salvador, for example,
would be hotly debated, even though the
situations of the two countries do not dif
fer greatly.
"Once the Extradition Treaty is
passed ... it is a testing ground to see
how the Senate would react to this sub
ject ... It would be easy for the State De
partment to pass similar treaties with oth
er governments," said the Stanford stu
dent from the Phillipines.
In fact, the U.S.-R P Treaty is not the
only piece of legislation now before Con
gress dealing with extradition. One Sen
ate bill sponsored by Sen. Strom
Thurmond (R-NC) contains a similar but
even more explicit provision giving the
Secretary of State the power to define
criminal versus political offenses. This bill
would apply to extradition cases from all
nations with which the United States has
treaties.
Barton said he doubts that the Senate
will ratify the U.S.-R P Extradition Treaty
or that the Congress will pass the new leg
islation. Furthermore, this shift in power
"raises real constitutional problems" and
it is not at all clear whether or not the Su
preme Court would accept such a
change, he said.
The recently concluded United States-
Philippines (RP) Extradition Treaty, now
awaiting Senate ratification, has alarmed
many members of the Filipino communi
ty, congressmen and others who feel that
it may have far reaching implication for
civil liberties in the United States.
Many fearthatthe treaty would be used
to extradite political dissidents who op
pose the Marcos regime and martial law,
which was declared in the Philippines in
1972 and ostensibly lifted in early 1981.
"It (the treaty) is an extension of martial
law in the United States... If it is not pro
tested by U.S. citizens who value demo
cratic freedoms in their country ... then
the Filipinos see the American people as
inconsistent," said a Filipino member of
the Stanford community who asked not
to be identified.
Sen. James Jeffords (R-VT) agrees. In a
letter to the Senate Foreign Relations
Committee signed by 16 other con
gressmen, Jeffords wrote that "we would
create a repressive environment in our
country for those people who want to ex-

News analysis

press openly a dissatisfaction with their
country of origin."
Consistent with U.S. policy in extradi
tion cases, the proposed treaty stipulates
that "extradition shall not be granted if
the offense for which it is requested is a
political offense or is connected with a
political offense." However, the most
controversial provision of the treaty
would, in cases involving Filipinos, shift
from the Judiciary to the Executive
Branch the power to define what con

stitutes a "political" as opposed to a
"criminal" offense. Thus the Secretary of
State and not the courts would be respon
sible for making this distinction.
"We are disturbed by this transfer of
power. The Secretary of State is subject to
weighty political pressures, both from
home and abroad. He is not bound by the
