# Bay Area cities planning gun control measures

### Mike Oneal 
Following the lead set by a small
Chicago suburb, several Bay Area
communities have discovered the
handgun control movement and
taken steps toward placing ban or
dinances on the November ballot.
Morton Grove, 111., which in Janu
ary passed the first handgun ban to
be deemed constitutional by a state
supreme court, opened the
floodgates for a previously stagnating

national movement by giving it a
fresh, local orientation. Though
direct enaction of local gun control
legislation has been scarce, grass
roots ordinance proposals like those
recently introduced in San Francisco
and Sunnyvale have popped up from
coast to coast, signaling to both the
proponents and opponents of gun
control that the movement has taken
a significant new turn toward local
solutions.
Though hampered by a state pre
emption law which governs the
licensing and registration of hand
guns, a number of Bay Area com
munities have decided to explore the
constitutionality of an outright ban
on the possession of handguns.
Though cities have found they can
not halt registration or licensing on a
local level since the state has taken
that authority upon itself, they feel
they can legally ban the possession of
a handgun within a city's limits.
San Francisco, Sunnyvale and Palo
Alto have taken the most serious
steps toward enacting handgun con
trol legislation in the Bay Area. Ac
cording to Jim Buick of the San Fran-

Cisco Mayor's Council on Criminal
Justice, Berkeley, Oakland and Mill
Valley have also shown considerable
interest in the issue.
Buick said San Francisco Mayor
Diane Feinstein went to the Califor
nia State Attorney's office earlier this
year and asked for an opinion regard
ing whether a handgun ban in the
city would be legally feasible. The re
port generated said that such a ban
would indeed be feasible, and the
mayor drafted an ordinance which is
now being considered by the San
Francisco Board of Supervisors' Pub
lic Protection Committee.
Buick said the ordinance calls for
an outright ban on the possession of
handguns within the city limits, ex
cept those used for professional
purposes and those carried by

citizens who are licensed by the po
lice to carry a concealed handgun.
Such licensing is extremely limited,
Buick said.
The ordinance will be considered
by the Public Protection Committee
at two public hearings to be held May
27 and June 10 — the first for propo
nents and the second for opponents.
The committee will then give its rec

ommendation to the full board,
which will decide whether to put the
ordinance on the November ballot.
In Sunnyvale, a draft ordinance
almost identical to San Francisco's is
under consideration by the city's
Charter Review Committee. The is
sue was originally proposed by com
mittee member Lou Cava and, ac
cording to City Council member
Dolowries Wulfhorst, it is somewhat
of a departure from usual committee
considerations.
"The issue came up in a bizarre
way," Wulfhorst said. "The Charter
Review Committee is usually given
direction by the City Council but this
year we gave them more freedom to
discuss what they want. It came up as
an item of discussion. It is not being
proposed as a charter amendment. It
would be a city ordinance."
The ordinance was put to public
hearing three weeks ago and despite
the efforts of a large crowd of
raucous, anti-gun control advocates,
the committee agreed by a 10-4 vote
to recommend the measure to the
City Council. The council is expected
to favor placing the ordinance on the
November ballot, Wulfhorst said.
Palo Alto, though seriously con
sidering the issue of handgun con
trol, is not as far along in its efforts as
either San Francisco or Sunnyvale.
City Council member Lee Levy, one
of the primary council members in
favor of an ordinance, said that City
Attorney Diane Lee is reviewing the
legal options available concerning a
ban. The council expects a report
from the attorney's office sometime
in June and the city's Policy and Pro
cedures Committee will then study it
for three weeks before scheduling
hearings on the issue, Levy said.
