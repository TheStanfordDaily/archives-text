## Campus fashions feature a mixture of styles, personalities 
### Derick Lopez 
From France come the crea
tions of Yves St. Laurent and
Pierre Cardin. In the United
States, Saks, I.and J. Magnin,
Brooks Brothers and the likes
set the standards for the fash
ion conscious with dollars to
spare.
Fashion shows itself in an ar
ray of colors, fabrics of varying
textures and styles that range
from New Wave punk to classic
conservative. But, fashion is
more than just a style of dress
ing.
And at Stanford, fashion is as
varied as the students...
At the lowest and most basic
level, fashion is a means of
keeping from being arrested
for indecent exposure. Some
really could care less about
what they wear as long it covers

enough to protect them from
the elements. For these peo
ple, dressing in the morning in
volves no more than going to
the closet or drawer, or some
times the floor, and taking out
whatever is clean and at hand.
For others, fashion is more
important. It is representative
of an attitude. Their dress re
flects their mood. When the
mood is relaxed, the clothing
follows suit. Old comfortable
jeans or cut-offs with a favorite
t-shirt are common on campus.
When the mood or occasion
swings toward the less casual
and more formal, skirts and
blouses or trousers and shirts,
paired with a sweater, jacket,
or blazer appear. More fashion
conscious students often have
wardrobes which run the full
range of clothes from casual to

formal, clothes that "match the
mood," and seem to overflow
closet and drawer space.
Fashion, for many, is a means
of self-expression. Self-ex
pression is evidenced by
streaks of brightly colored hair
in shades of red, green, or pur
ple or in the New Wave fashion
trends. Others remain loyal to
the long, freely flowing hair
and the loose, airy, and gauzy
styles of the 70s. And seeming
ly here to stay, is the classic ox
ford look, or "I'm a preppie."
Whatever the outfit, the choice
emits a message about the
wearer, however subtle.
There are those for whom
fashion is a means of showing
status. Status may be owning
the latest fashions pictured in
Vogue or Gentleman's Quar
terly. In some instances the
quest for status may be worth
any effort regardless of the
cost. Label recongnition can be
earned with a polo player, an
alligator, a penguin, a fox, a
tiger, or a dragon (no kid
ding!) sewn on the front.
Fashion affects Stanford stu
dents in varying degrees. One
can see the whole gamut of
fashions everywhere on cam
pus, but four basic types are
predominant: the relaxed/
casual look, the classic fashion
look, the trendy fashion look,
and the extreme look.
The casual look is probably
the most common, especially
during spring and summer. Af
ter the cold and grey days of
winter, most people are eager
to take advantage of the sun
shine and the warmth, and
what better way to be dressed
than to be in a polo or t-shirt
with jeans or shorts. If not a t
shirt, then a light shirt or blouse
is enough. The Stanford idea
seems to be one of comfort.
This way of dressing also re
flects a more relaxed state of
mind. Outdoor living brings on
an outdoor frame of mind and
with it come clothes for work
ing out, running, or playing.
Running a close second to

the relaxed style of dress is the
slightly more dressy, classic
look. Button-down oxford
shirts, light trousers, and
Docksiders on men comple
ment comfortable blouses and
straight cut pants on women.
The warmer weather brings out
varying lengths of walking
shorts.
This style of dress is still very
comfortable, if a touch more
dressy. The classic, dressy but
comfortable look is also some
times punctuated by a designer
label or two peeking out from a
pocket or a shirt front.
The trendy look of the most
current styles in fashion can be
seen on campus, but it is not as
visible as the last two. These
people spend a great deal of
time and money to ensure their
recognizability. Trendy types
are easy to spot because peo
ple in their wakes are all en
gaged in double takes.
A handsome or beautiful
face is not necessarily the rea
son for the doubletake, but
rather, it is the bearing and
style of dress. These are the
fashion elite who look like they
have just come off of the front
of a fashion magazine.
Those in the last group, who
go for avant garde fashions are,
the smallest group, but are the
easiest to recognize. They sport
the unconventional fashion in
New Wave with Mohawk hair
cuts for the men and short,
brightly colored hair for the
women. Almost any bright col
or appears in the clothing, as
long as it clashes with the rest
of the outfit. Some of the New
Wave fashions recall clothing
styles from the '60s with white
shirts and skinny ties, and tight
knee length pants.
Most people buy their
clothes, some recycle them,
and still others maketheirown.
Buying clothes, whether one
makes a rack puchase or visits
the tailor, is the most conven
tional way of enlarging one's
wardrobe. Recycling old
clothes is another way to a

more extensive wardrobe, and
that can be done perhaps by
digging through older clothes
at local resell shops to recap
ture a style that has come back
into fashion.
Making one's own clothes
probably offers the greatest
degree of freedom in picking
new clothes to wear. One can
sew a new outfit, or crochet or
knit a sweater in a preferred
color thereby insuring that it
will fit well. All that is required
is time and effort.
However, most students do
buy their clothes. The frequen
cy of purchases and money
spent vary. Philip Manela, a
graduate student in electrical
engineering, said, "I buy my
clothes when I'm home, mostly
from men's clothing stores,
and casual wear. I go out to
make a major clothing
purchase maybe once a year."
Judy Brady, an under
graduate in international rela
tions, said she buys herclothes,
"little by little, every six weeks,
or when I get bored. I buy
clothes by how they'll look on
me, and I don't follow trends
very much."
For the most part it seems
that Stanford students are a
fairly conservative group when
it comes to fashion. Most avoid
fashion extremes, while man
aging to look in style without
spending too much money.
But undegraduates Shawna
Perry, Tony Seavorks, and
Michael Bender, typify the
smaller group who are quite
meticulous in their selection of
clothing. According to Perry, "I
buy what I like, even if it is a bit
unusual."
Seavorks agreed, adding,
"I'll buy on impulse, at clothing
specialty shops, and not at de
partment stores."
"I don't usually follow fash
ion trends, but if it looks nice
on me, I'll buy it. I go shopping
for clothes every two or three
weeks, or whenever I want new
clothes," Bender said.
According to these three stu

dents, $400 is not too large an
amount to spend every time
they shop for clothes.
While some students will
wait and buy clothes when they
are home, many still shop in
the area.
"Twenty five to 30 percent of
the customers here are Stan
ford students," said Scott
Evans, assistant manager of
Grodins in the Stanford Shop
ping Center. "They buy mostly
casual wear, but at graduation
or interview time, suits and

more formal wear sells a lot.
Stanford students are not too
trendy as dressers, choosing
natural fabrics over polyesters.
Money is usually no problem."
Rayna Stender, manager and
buyer for the Clothes Barn at
Stanford Shopping Center,
gave similar information.
"Stanford students make up
about 25 percent of our cus
tomers. They buy mostly shorts
and causual wear, not trendy
fashions, but basic clothing and
classic fashions, like button
down oxford shirts."

For the most part it seems

clothes," Bender said.
According to these three stu

amount to spend every time
they shop for clothes.

CASUAL KHAKI — A popular Stanford "uniform," khaki
pants topped by a favorite polo or T-shirt are deemed
comfortable as well as practical for student living.
From France come the crea
tions of Yves St. Laurent and
Pierre Cardin. In the United
States, Saks, I.and J. Magnin,
Brooks Brothers and the likes
set the standards for the fash
ion conscious with dollars to
spare.
Fashion shows itself in an ar
ray of colors, fabrics of varying
textures and styles that range
from New Wave punk to classic
conservative. But, fashion is
more than just a style of dress
ing.
And at Stanford, fashion is as
varied as the students...
At the lowest and most basic
level, fashion is a means of
keeping from being arrested
for indecent exposure. Some
really could care less about
what they wear as long it covers

enough to protect them from
the elements. For these peo
ple, dressing in the morning in
volves no more than going to
the closet or drawer, or some
times the floor, and taking out
whatever is clean and at hand.
For others, fashion is more
important. It is representative
of an attitude. Their dress re
flects their mood. When the
mood is relaxed, the clothing
follows suit. Old comfortable
jeans or cut-offs with a favorite
t-shirt are common on campus.
When the mood or occasion
swings toward the less casual
and more formal, skirts and
blouses or trousers and shirts,
paired with a sweater, jacket,
or blazer appear. More fashion
conscious students often have
wardrobes which run the full
range of clothes from casual to

formal, clothes that "match the
mood," and seem to overflow
closet and drawer space.
Fashion, for many, is a means
of self-expression. Self-ex
pression is evidenced by
streaks of brightly colored hair
in shades of red, green, or pur
ple or in the New Wave fashion
trends. Others remain loyal to
the long, freely flowing hair
and the loose, airy, and gauzy
styles of the 70s. And seeming
ly here to stay, is the classic ox
ford look, or "I'm a preppie."
Whatever the outfit, the choice
emits a message about the
wearer, however subtle.
There are those for whom
fashion is a means of showing
status. Status may be owning
the latest fashions pictured in
Vogue or Gentleman's Quar
terly. In some instances the
quest for status may be worth
any effort regardless of the
cost. Label recongnition can be
earned with a polo player, an
alligator, a penguin, a fox, a
tiger, or a dragon (no kid
ding!) sewn on the front.
Fashion affects Stanford stu
dents in varying degrees. One
can see the whole gamut of
fashions everywhere on cam
pus, but four basic types are
predominant: the relaxed/
casual look, the classic fashion
look, the trendy fashion look,
and the extreme look.
The casual look is probably
the most common, especially
during spring and summer. Af
ter the cold and grey days of
winter, most people are eager
to take advantage of the sun
shine and the warmth, and
what better way to be dressed
than to be in a polo or t-shirt
with jeans or shorts. If not a t
shirt, then a light shirt or blouse
is enough. The Stanford idea
seems to be one of comfort.
This way of dressing also re
flects a more relaxed state of
mind. Outdoor living brings on
an outdoor frame of mind and
with it come clothes for work
ing out, running, or playing.
Running a close second to

the relaxed style of dress is the
slightly more dressy, classic
look. Button-down oxford
shirts, light trousers, and
Docksiders on men comple
ment comfortable blouses and
straight cut pants on women.
The warmer weather brings out
varying lengths of walking
shorts.
This style of dress is still very
comfortable, if a touch more
dressy. The classic, dressy but
comfortable look is also some
times punctuated by a designer
label or two peeking out from a
pocket or a shirt front.
The trendy look of the most
current styles in fashion can be
seen on campus, but it is not as
visible as the last two. These
people spend a great deal of
time and money to ensure their
recognizability. Trendy types
are easy to spot because peo
ple in their wakes are all en
gaged in double takes.
A handsome or beautiful
face is not necessarily the rea
son for the doubletake, but
rather, it is the bearing and
style of dress. These are the
fashion elite who look like they
have just come off of the front
of a fashion magazine.
Those in the last group, who
go for avant garde fashions are,
the smallest group, but are the
easiest to recognize. They sport
the unconventional fashion in
New Wave with Mohawk hair
cuts for the men and short,
brightly colored hair for the
women. Almost any bright col
or appears in the clothing, as
long as it clashes with the rest
of the outfit. Some of the New
Wave fashions recall clothing
styles from the '60s with white
shirts and skinny ties, and tight
knee length pants.
Most people buy their
clothes, some recycle them,
and still others maketheirown.
Buying clothes, whether one
makes a rack puchase or visits
the tailor, is the most conven
tional way of enlarging one's
wardrobe. Recycling old
clothes is another way to a

more extensive wardrobe, and
that can be done perhaps by
digging through older clothes
at local resell shops to recap
ture a style that has come back
into fashion.
Making one's own clothes
probably offers the greatest
degree of freedom in picking
new clothes to wear. One can
sew a new outfit, or crochet or
knit a sweater in a preferred
color thereby insuring that it
will fit well. All that is required
is time and effort.
However, most students do
buy their clothes. The frequen
cy of purchases and money
spent vary. Philip Manela, a
graduate student in electrical
engineering, said, "I buy my
clothes when I'm home, mostly
from men's clothing stores,
and casual wear. I go out to
make a major clothing
purchase maybe once a year."
Judy Brady, an under

shirts, light trousers, and
Docksiders on men comple
ment comfortable blouses and
straight cut pants on women.
The warmer weather brings out
varying lengths of walking
shorts.
This style of dress is still very
comfortable, if a touch more
dressy. The classic, dressy but
comfortable look is also some
times punctuated by a designer
label or two peeking out from a
pocket or a shirt front.
The trendy look of the most
current styles in fashion can be
seen on campus, but it is not as
visible as the last two. These
people spend a great deal of
time and money to ensure their
recognizability. Trendy types
are easy to spot because peo
ple in their wakes are all en
gaged in double takes.
A handsome or beautiful
face is not necessarily the rea
son for the doubletake, but
rather, it is the bearing and
style of dress. These are the
fashion elite who look like they
have just come off of the front
of a fashion magazine.
Those in the last group, who
go for avant garde fashions are,
the smallest group, but are the
easiest to recognize. They sport
the unconventional fashion in
New Wave with Mohawk hair
cuts for the men and short,
brightly colored hair for the
women. Almost any bright col
or appears in the clothing, as
long as it clashes with the rest
of the outfit. Some of the New
Wave fashions recall clothing
styles from the '60s with white
shirts and skinny ties, and tight
knee length pants.
Most people buy their
clothes, some recycle them,
and still others maketheirown.
Buying clothes, whether one
makes a rack puchase or visits
the tailor, is the most conven
tional way of enlarging one's
wardrobe. Recycling old
clothes is another way to a

more extensive wardrobe, and
that can be done perhaps by
digging through older clothes
at local resell shops to recap
ture a style that has come back
into fashion.
Making one's own clothes
probably offers the greatest
degree of freedom in picking
new clothes to wear. One can
sew a new outfit, or crochet or
knit a sweater in a preferred
color thereby insuring that it
will fit well. All that is required
is time and effort.
However, most students do
buy their clothes. The frequen
cy of purchases and money
spent vary. Philip Manela, a
graduate student in electrical
engineering, said, "I buy my
clothes when I'm home, mostly
from men's clothing stores,
and casual wear. I go out to
make a major clothing
purchase maybe once a year."
Judy Brady, an under
graduate in international rela
tions, said she buys herclothes,
"little by little, every six weeks,
or when I get bored. I buy
clothes by how they'll look on
me, and I don't follow trends
very much."
For the most part it seems
that Stanford students are a
fairly conservative group when
it comes to fashion. Most avoid
fashion extremes, while man
aging to look in style without
spending too much money.
But undegraduates Shawna
Perry, Tony Seavorks, and
Michael Bender, typify the
smaller group who are quite
meticulous in their selection of
clothing. According to Perry, "I
buy what I like, even if it is a bit
unusual."
Seavorks agreed, adding,
"I'll buy on impulse, at clothing
specialty shops, and not at de
partment stores."
"I don't usually follow fash
ion trends, but if it looks nice
on me, I'll buy it. I go shopping
for clothes every two or three
weeks, or whenever I want new
clothes," Bender said.
According to these three stu

dents, $400 is not too large an
amount to spend every time
they shop for clothes.
While some students will
wait and buy clothes when they
are home, many still shop in
the area.
"Twenty five to 30 percent of
the customers here are Stan
ford students," said Scott
Evans, assistant manager of
Grodins in the Stanford Shop
ping Center. "They buy mostly
casual wear, but at graduation
or interview time, suits and

more formal wear sells a lot.
Stanford students are not too
trendy as dressers, choosing
natural fabrics over polyesters.
Money is usually no problem."
Rayna Stender, manager and
buyer for the Clothes Barn at
Stanford Shopping Center,
gave similar information.
"Stanford students make up
about 25 percent of our cus
tomers. They buy mostly shorts
and causual wear, not trendy
fashions, but basic clothing and
classic fashions, like button
down oxford shirts."
