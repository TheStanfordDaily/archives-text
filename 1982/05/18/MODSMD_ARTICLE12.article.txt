## Nuclear optimism misplaced 
### 
In his recent Viewpoint (Daily, May 11) Rudolph Sher
makes a number of claims about nuclear power. He con
cludes that it is "cheap, safe, reliable and environmental
ly benign." I will examine each of these arguments in
turn:
"Nuclear power is cheap": The direct, present costs of
nuclear power are so great that they are driving some of
the utilities that invested in them into bankruptcy, and
forcing others to cancel and drastically cut back on
planned projects. The soaring costs of nuclear plants, a
sharp drop in the growth of electrical demand, and more
expensive safety requirements in the wake of Three Mile
Island (TMI) are some of the factors behind this rising
cost spiral (Wall Street Journal, March 11).
At TMI more than 300,000 gallons of water con
taminated with fission products overflowed into the aux
iliary and fuel handling buildings from the primary
coolant system, and another 700,000 gallons flowed into
the containment dump. Days after this near meltdown,
radiation levels in the dome of the containment building
measured near 30,000 rems, enough to cause instant
death to humans (Science News, April 7,1979). Two re
ports from the Nuclear Safety Analysis Council recom
mended a total of 203 charges to be made immediately in
all nuclear plants to prevent another such episode. The
estimated cost: $33 billion.
Two partially completed nuclear plants in Washing
ton, years behind schedule, were recently terminated
without ever having produced a single watt of electricity
(estimated cost: $343 million, not including the $2.25
billion in construction bonds that must be repaid). The
Tennesee Valley Authority, having already invested $4
billion in 8 nuclear plants, is considering scrapping
them; just to maintain each site in the meantime costs
$20 million a year.
The Diablo Canyon fiasco is costing is costing $560,000
a day in interest due on loans, the "clean-up" operation
at TMI will cost in excess of $1.3 billion. Even considering
only these direct, present costs, and not the hidden med

ical and environmental costs which the future will have
to pay (the "externalities"), nuclear power is hardly
cheap.
"Nuclear power is safe": The nation's nuclear reactors
reported 3804 incidents in 1980 in which mechanical
equipment of human operators failed to work as re
quired. One plant, Sequoyah in Tennessee, had 238 such
"incidents" even though it was in operation only 11 per
cent of the year. No nuclear "incident" can ever be
termed insignificant, since even minor problems, if un
detected, can lead to serious accidents such as occurred
at TMI.
One must consider, however, not only reactors but
the entire nuclear fuel cycle, from uranium mining with
its release of radon and thorium-230 (dangerous for
800,000 years) to the unsolvable problem of storing gar
gantuan amounts of nuclear trash with absolutely
perfect containment for periods more than 50 times all of
recorded human history.
One must consider all the transportation links in
volved, as well as the problem of storage. If, as currently
planned, the highly toxic spent reactor fuel is to be fun
neled to one central "permanent" repository in the West
(probably in Nevada), interstate highways 40, 80, 90, 76
and 70 will be converted into heavily used waste cor
ridors, with trucks carrying high level waste arriving at
the rate of one an hour by the year 2004 (San Francisco
Chronicle, Nov. 6,1981). There will be a constant possi
bility of catastrophic accidents, not to speak of de
liberate sabotage or theft. Not only is nuclear energy not
safe, but a more dangerous way of providing a small
amount of electricity would be difficult to manage.
"Nuclear energy is reliable": Shortly before multiple
errors were discovered in the design of its Diablo Ca
nyon reactor, PG&E testified to the licensing commission
of the Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) that "the
staff review of the seismic design of Diablo Canyon has
been the most extensive we have ever undertaken. This
review has extended from the basic input critera em
ployed through the details of myriad analysis."
Sounded great, but it turned out to be a lot of horse
dukey. John Horn, a Stanford graduate who discovered
the initial more than 100 design errors in the plant, said:
"For the first containment building, the diagram they
used was flipped upside down. Then, for the second re
actor's building, they used a mirror image, making it
doubly wrong" (Daily, Nov. 23, 1981).
Nuncio Palladino, chairman of the NRC and hardly an
anti-nuclear spokesman, charged in a recent speech
made to the Atomic Industrial Forum that "lapses of

many kinds" have been all too frequent in the building
of nuclear power plants. He mentioned built-in design
errors, poor construction practices, falsified documents,
harrassment of quality control personnel, and inade
quate training of reactor operators.
The utility at TMI was cited by the NRC for its "clear
failure" to report the malfunctioning reactor to the NRC
and the state of Pennsylvania on the first day of the acci
dent; it was fined $155,000 for other accident-related vio
lations. If this is a reliable industry, cows will soon be
seen jumping over the moon.
"Nuclear power is environmentally benign": High
level nuclear wastes already include more than 3.2 mil
lion cubic feet at the Savannah River plant in Aiken, S.C.;
388,000 cubic feet at Idaho Falls, Idaho; 490,000 cubic
feet at West Valley, N.Y. 260,000 cubic feet at Oak Ridge,
Tenn., 531,000 cubic feet at Los Alamos, N.M. and 16.4
million cubic feet on the Hanford Reservation in Wash
ington (San Francisco Chronicle, Feb. 27,1981).
At Hanford concentrated wastes so hot they boil from
their own radioactivity are kept in gigantic steel tanks
holding up to a million gallons of liquid. These tanks
have a usable life of 20 to 30 years. Leaks have been found
not only in the tanks but in the transmission lines carry-

ing the wastes from plant to tank. Just one 115,000-gallon
leak of high-level waste at Hanford spilled an estimated
14,000 curies of strontium-90, 40,000 curies of
cesium-137, and four curies of plutonium into the soil.
This leak of dangerous, radioactive substances, one of
many, went unnoticed for nearly two months (Robert
Gillettee in Science, Aug. 24,1973).
Some among us are already paying the price of nuclear
power. When Dr. Rosalie Bertell visited workers at the
plutonium processing plant in Erwin, Tenn., she found
that 100 out 100 workers had gross blood in their urine,
that is blood visible to the naked eye (Nuclear Witnesses
L.J. Freeman, Norton 1981).
These and the other facts I have cited are all culled
from major newspapers, journals or books: they are a
matter of public record. Although I respect Sher's sincer
ity, I do not believe the facts warrant his optimism about
nuclear power. The only viable energy path for our soci
ety is a non-nuclear future, based on alternate technolo
gies. We must learn to think not only of our own gener
atin, but of all those who will come after us. Their genes
and their environment are in our custody.

billion in construction bonds that must be repaid). The
Tennesee Valley Authority, having already invested $4
billion in 8 nuclear plants, is considering scrapping
them; just to maintain each site in the meantime costs
$20 million a year.
The Diablo Canyon fiasco is costing is costing $560,000
a day in interest due on loans, the "clean-up" operation
at TMI will cost in excess of $1.3 billion. Even considering
only these direct, present costs, and not the hidden med

ical and environmental costs which the future will have
to pay (the "externalities"), nuclear power is hardly
cheap.
"Nuclear power is safe": The nation's nuclear reactors
reported 3804 incidents in 1980 in which mechanical
equipment of human operators failed to work as re
quired. One plant, Sequoyah in Tennessee, had 238 such
"incidents" even though it was in operation only 11 per
cent of the year. No nuclear "incident" can ever be
termed insignificant, since even minor problems, if un
detected, can lead to serious accidents such as occurred
at TMI.
One must consider, however, not only reactors but
the entire nuclear fuel cycle, from uranium mining with
its release of radon and thorium-230 (dangerous for
800,000 years) to the unsolvable problem of storing gar
gantuan amounts of nuclear trash with absolutely
perfect containment for periods more than 50 times all of
recorded human history.
One must consider all the transportation links in
volved, as well as the problem of storage. If, as currently
planned, the highly toxic spent reactor fuel is to be fun
neled to one central "permanent" repository in the West
(probably in Nevada), interstate highways 40, 80, 90, 76
and 70 will be converted into heavily used waste cor
ridors, with trucks carrying high level waste arriving at
the rate of one an hour by the year 2004 (San Francisco
Chronicle, Nov. 6,1981). There will be a constant possi
bility of catastrophic accidents, not to speak of de
liberate sabotage or theft. Not only is nuclear energy not
safe, but a more dangerous way of providing a small
amount of electricity would be difficult to manage.
"Nuclear energy is reliable": Shortly before multiple
errors were discovered in the design of its Diablo Ca
nyon reactor, PG&E testified to the licensing commission
of the Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) that "the
staff review of the seismic design of Diablo Canyon has
been the most extensive we have ever undertaken. This
review has extended from the basic input critera em
ployed through the details of myriad analysis."
Sounded great, but it turned out to be a lot of horse
dukey. John Horn, a Stanford graduate who discovered
the initial more than 100 design errors in the plant, said:
"For the first containment building, the diagram they
used was flipped upside down. Then, for the second re
actor's building, they used a mirror image, making it
doubly wrong" (Daily, Nov. 23, 1981).
Nuncio Palladino, chairman of the NRC and hardly an
anti-nuclear spokesman, charged in a recent speech
made to the Atomic Industrial Forum that "lapses of

many kinds" have been all too frequent in the building
of nuclear power plants. He mentioned built-in design
errors, poor construction practices, falsified documents,
harrassment of quality control personnel, and inade
quate training of reactor operators.
The utility at TMI was cited by the NRC for its "clear
failure" to report the malfunctioning reactor to the NRC
and the state of Pennsylvania on the first day of the acci
dent; it was fined $155,000 for other accident-related vio
lations. If this is a reliable industry, cows will soon be
seen jumping over the moon.
"Nuclear power is environmentally benign": High
level nuclear wastes already include more than 3.2 mil
lion cubic feet at the Savannah River plant in Aiken, S.C.;
388,000 cubic feet at Idaho Falls, Idaho; 490,000 cubic
feet at West Valley, N.Y. 260,000 cubic feet at Oak Ridge,
Tenn., 531,000 cubic feet at Los Alamos, N.M. and 16.4
million cubic feet on the Hanford Reservation in Wash
ington (San Francisco Chronicle, Feb. 27,1981).
At Hanford concentrated wastes so hot they boil from
their own radioactivity are kept in gigantic steel tanks
holding up to a million gallons of liquid. These tanks
have a usable life of 20 to 30 years. Leaks have been found
not only in the tanks but in the transmission lines carry-

ing the wastes from plant to tank. Just one 115,000-gallon
leak of high-level waste at Hanford spilled an estimated
14,000 curies of strontium-90, 40,000 curies of
cesium-137, and four curies of plutonium into the soil.
This leak of dangerous, radioactive substances, one of
many, went unnoticed for nearly two months (Robert
Gillettee in Science, Aug. 24,1973).
Some among us are already paying the price of nuclear
power. When Dr. Rosalie Bertell visited workers at the
plutonium processing plant in Erwin, Tenn., she found
that 100 out 100 workers had gross blood in their urine,
that is blood visible to the naked eye (Nuclear Witnesses
L.J. Freeman, Norton 1981).
These and the other facts I have cited are all culled
from major newspapers, journals or books: they are a
matter of public record. Although I respect Sher's sincer
ity, I do not believe the facts warrant his optimism about
nuclear power. The only viable energy path for our soci
ety is a non-nuclear future, based on alternate technolo
gies. We must learn to think not only of our own gener
atin, but of all those who will come after us. Their genes
and their environment are in our custody.

In his recent Viewpoint (Daily, May 11) Rudolph Sher
makes a number of claims about nuclear power. He con
cludes that it is "cheap, safe, reliable and environmental
ly benign." I will examine each of these arguments in
turn:
"Nuclear power is cheap": The direct, present costs of
nuclear power are so great that they are driving some of
the utilities that invested in them into bankruptcy, and
forcing others to cancel and drastically cut back on
planned projects. The soaring costs of nuclear plants, a
sharp drop in the growth of electrical demand, and more
expensive safety requirements in the wake of Three Mile
Island (TMI) are some of the factors behind this rising
cost spiral (Wall Street Journal, March 11).
At TMI more than 300,000 gallons of water con
taminated with fission products overflowed into the aux
iliary and fuel handling buildings from the primary
coolant system, and another 700,000 gallons flowed into
the containment dump. Days after this near meltdown,
radiation levels in the dome of the containment building
measured near 30,000 rems, enough to cause instant
death to humans (Science News, April 7,1979). Two re
ports from the Nuclear Safety Analysis Council recom
mended a total of 203 charges to be made immediately in
all nuclear plants to prevent another such episode. The
estimated cost: $33 billion.
Two partially completed nuclear plants in Washing
ton, years behind schedule, were recently terminated
without ever having produced a single watt of electricity
(estimated cost: $343 million, not including the $2.25
billion in construction bonds that must be repaid). The
Tennesee Valley Authority, having already invested $4
