## Fairness turned myth in war-torn El Salvador 
### 
Renard Strautman's recent Daily Viewpoint (May 11), expressing support
for the elections in El Salvador as well as the continuing flow of U.S. aid reflects
an incredible degree of naivete and ignorance. Strautman apparently saw the
elections as a neutral mechanism which, by tapping the people's will, could
instantly confer a halo of legitimacy on the new government.
Strautman's liberal faith in the absolute power and legitimacy of "free"
elections is quaint but ultimately misplaced. As the case of El Salvador demon
strates, it is virtually impossible to carry out fair and neutral elections in the
midst of a raging civil war.
Strautman feels that the high voter turnout was a legitimate demonstration
of popular support for the government and a rejection of the rebels. He also
claims that voters risked their lives in the face of violent rebel intimidation.
But the bulk of the intimidation was carried out by the government, not the
rebels. The rebels actually renounced violent attempts to disuade people
from voting. The rebel leadership recognized that shooting up polling places
would neither further their cause nor win them sympathy abroad.
True, scattered violence was carried out by undisciplined local rebel
groups. Yet the effects of these incidents were negligible and they obviously
did not amount to a coordinate rebel attempt to disrupt the elections. Many
observers were surprised by the high degree of rebel restraint.
The government, however, was no' so restrained. All eligible Salvadorans
were required to vote and ID cards were stamped at each polling place. Non
voters carrying unstamped ID cards were subject to arrest. Fear, not voluntary
choice, produced high voter turnouts. Given rebel restraint and government
intimidation the high turnout was neither a surprise nor a valid measure of
popular sympathies.
Strautman asserts that the rebels boycotted the elections simply because
they knew they couldn't win. Two very different reasons explain the rebels
refusal to participate. First, the government demanded that the rebels disarm.
Plus, each electoral candidate had to turn in a nominating petition with 3000
names and addresses.
The idea that the rebels should first disarm and then turn in lists of their
supporters to a government which has failed, willingly or not, to control the
indiscriminate violence of right wing death squads or its own troops, is ludi
crous. Second, the rebels rightly recognize that the powerful conservative
army leadership certainly would not have cooperative with an electoral vic
tory by the left.

Strautman viewed the rural votes given to right wing Roberto D'Aubuisson
as a sign of rebel weakness among the peasantry. This is misleading.
D'Aubuisson's share of the national vote was 20 percent; hardly a stunning
figure. Moreover, one must look at D'Aubuisson's campaign tactics. Govern
ment control in the countryside is weak and campaigning there was danger
ous, especially for Duarte who was a target of both the left and the right. Thus,
Duarte rarely strayed from well protected urban areas.
D'Aubuisson, however, used a personal para-military entrourage to forge
his way into rural areas, then surround villages forcing peasants to gather for
one of D'Aubuisson's blood curdling tirades. Villagers, noting D'Aubuisson's
firepower, his violent rhetoric, and his well known association with right wing
death squads got the messaeg. Even if individual votes remained secret, vil
lage level returns could be scrutinized. A village failing to throw its support to
D'Aubuisson was risking its collective life.
Strautman failed to note that the post-election negotiations among top po
litical and military leaders went on at the home of the United States Am
bassador. Where is the will of the people in all this? Strautman claims that the
rebels are just as violent and dangerous as D'Aubuisson. Yet the Catholic
Church and Amnesty International have affirmed that the large majority of
civilian deaths are attributable to the government or right wing death squads.
Deaths of this type have escalated 20 percent since the election. While rebel
violence is mainly directed at representatives of an unjust government, the
right wing employ indiscriminate violence designed to terrorize the popu
lation into submission.
Strautman claims that the army will have a moderating effect on
D'Aubuisson since it favored the Christian Democrats. Yet, the army's prefer
ence for Christian Democratic participation was purely tactical and its com
mitment to reforms is highly questionable. The army's initial support for
Christian Democratic participation in the new government stemmed from
their fear that an undiluted right wing coalition would result in a cutoff of U.S
military aid as President Reagan initially suggested.
Reagan feared that exclusion of the "moderates" would lead to incite Con
gressional disfavor. D'Aubuisson's lust for power wrecked these plans. His
right wing coalition in the Assembly now relegates the Christian Democrats to
an excluded minority. A weak moderate, Alvaro Magana, has been installed as
president, yet it is clear that the far right is in control.
Given this outcome, Reagan shifted ground. Now D'Aubuisson's leader
ship of an unadulterated right wing coalition government is acceptable as
long as reforms are still carried out. Yet the heavily flawed land reform plan is
already moribund. The "moderate" Christian Democrats only partially im
plemented the first of the law's three parts. The law's gaping loopholes, the
military's reluctance to implement reforms, and right wing terrorism against
peasants have made the land reform a farce.
Neither Reagan nor D'Aubuisson believe in reforms, though Congressional
pressure may force D'Aubuisson to make verbal commitments. If
D'Aubuisson rejects even paper reforms, it is highly likely that Reagan will dis
cover some other redeeming virtue in the government which merits U.S.
support.
While rebel strength is not yet decisive, popular alienation is likely to rise
even further if D'Aubuisson carries out the reign of terror which many ob
servers fear. The myth that these elections represented a true test of popular
will is a dangerous one. The U.S. Congress must end this charade by cutting off
aid to the bloody and unjust regime in El Salvador.

bassador. Where is the will of the people in all this? Strautman claims that the
rebels are just as violent and dangerous as D'Aubuisson. Yet the Catholic
Church and Amnesty International have affirmed that the large majority of
civilian deaths are attributable to the government or right wing death squads.
Deaths of this type have escalated 20 percent since the election. While rebel
violence is mainly directed at representatives of an unjust government, the
right wing employ indiscriminate violence designed to terrorize the popu
lation into submission.
Strautman claims that the army will have a moderating effect on
D'Aubuisson since it favored the Christian Democrats. Yet, the army's prefer
ence for Christian Democratic participation was purely tactical and its com
mitment to reforms is highly questionable. The army's initial support for
Christian Democratic participation in the new government stemmed from
their fear that an undiluted right wing coalition would result in a cutoff of U.S
military aid as President Reagan initially suggested.
Reagan feared that exclusion of the "moderates" would lead to incite Con
gressional disfavor. D'Aubuisson's lust for power wrecked these plans. His
right wing coalition in the Assembly now relegates the Christian Democrats to
an excluded minority. A weak moderate, Alvaro Magana, has been installed as
president, yet it is clear that the far right is in control.
Given this outcome, Reagan shifted ground. Now D'Aubuisson's leader
ship of an unadulterated right wing coalition government is acceptable as
long as reforms are still carried out. Yet the heavily flawed land reform plan is
already moribund. The "moderate" Christian Democrats only partially im
plemented the first of the law's three parts. The law's gaping loopholes, the
military's reluctance to implement reforms, and right wing terrorism against
peasants have made the land reform a farce.
Neither Reagan nor D'Aubuisson believe in reforms, though Congressional
pressure may force D'Aubuisson to make verbal commitments. If
D'Aubuisson rejects even paper reforms, it is highly likely that Reagan will dis
cover some other redeeming virtue in the government which merits U.S.
support.
While rebel strength is not yet decisive, popular alienation is likely to rise
even further if D'Aubuisson carries out the reign of terror which many ob
servers fear. The myth that these elections represented a true test of popular
will is a dangerous one. The U.S. Congress must end this charade by cutting off
aid to the bloody and unjust regime in El Salvador.

Renard Strautman's recent Daily Viewpoint (May 11), expressing support
for the elections in El Salvador as well as the continuing flow of U.S. aid reflects
an incredible degree of naivete and ignorance. Strautman apparently saw the
elections as a neutral mechanism which, by tapping the people's will, could
instantly confer a halo of legitimacy on the new government.
Strautman's liberal faith in the absolute power and legitimacy of "free"
elections is quaint but ultimately misplaced. As the case of El Salvador demon
strates, it is virtually impossible to carry out fair and neutral elections in the
midst of a raging civil war.
Strautman feels that the high voter turnout was a legitimate demonstration
of popular support for the government and a rejection of the rebels. He also
claims that voters risked their lives in the face of violent rebel intimidation.
But the bulk of the intimidation was carried out by the government, not the
rebels. The rebels actually renounced violent attempts to disuade people
from voting. The rebel leadership recognized that shooting up polling places
would neither further their cause nor win them sympathy abroad.
True, scattered violence was carried out by undisciplined local rebel
groups. Yet the effects of these incidents were negligible and they obviously
did not amount to a coordinate rebel attempt to disrupt the elections. Many
observers were surprised by the high degree of rebel restraint.
The government, however, was no' so restrained. All eligible Salvadorans
were required to vote and ID cards were stamped at each polling place. Non
voters carrying unstamped ID cards were subject to arrest. Fear, not voluntary
choice, produced high voter turnouts. Given rebel restraint and government
intimidation the high turnout was neither a surprise nor a valid measure of
popular sympathies.
Strautman asserts that the rebels boycotted the elections simply because
they knew they couldn't win. Two very different reasons explain the rebels
refusal to participate. First, the government demanded that the rebels disarm.
Plus, each electoral candidate had to turn in a nominating petition with 3000
names and addresses.
The idea that the rebels should first disarm and then turn in lists of their
supporters to a government which has failed, willingly or not, to control the
indiscriminate violence of right wing death squads or its own troops, is ludi
crous. Second, the rebels rightly recognize that the powerful conservative
army leadership certainly would not have cooperative with an electoral vic
tory by the left.

Strautman viewed the rural votes given to right wing Roberto D'Aubuisson
as a sign of rebel weakness among the peasantry. This is misleading.
D'Aubuisson's share of the national vote was 20 percent; hardly a stunning
figure. Moreover, one must look at D'Aubuisson's campaign tactics. Govern
ment control in the countryside is weak and campaigning there was danger
ous, especially for Duarte who was a target of both the left and the right. Thus,
Duarte rarely strayed from well protected urban areas.
D'Aubuisson, however, used a personal para-military entrourage to forge
his way into rural areas, then surround villages forcing peasants to gather for
one of D'Aubuisson's blood curdling tirades. Villagers, noting D'Aubuisson's
firepower, his violent rhetoric, and his well known association with right wing
death squads got the messaeg. Even if individual votes remained secret, vil
lage level returns could be scrutinized. A village failing to throw its support to
D'Aubuisson was risking its collective life.
