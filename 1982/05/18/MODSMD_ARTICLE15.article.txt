## Democracy affirmed 
### 
The Daily editorial on the recent
elections in El Salvador ("Terrorism
Distorts Elections," May 5) contains a
number of inaccurate, misleading
and unfounded statements.
The Daily wrote that "the whole
election process was illegitimate"
and you refer scathingly to "the trav
esty of democracy being played out
in El Salvador." These statements are
inaccurate and profoundly unfair to
the Salvadoran people. The
Salvadoran election of March 28 was
probably the most honest and most
popular national election in that
county's history. Moreover, the turn
out of almost 1.5 million voters com
pares favorably in percentage terms
with turnout in national elections in
the United States, where conditions
are incomparably more comfortable.
It was also a massive popular repudia
tion of the claims of the guerrilla and
exile left that these elections were
merely a sham.
The Salvadoran election was wit
nessed by 200 official observers from
the United States and many other
countries and by some 700 cor
respondents from all over the world.
They agreed that the balloting was
carried out with little or no evidence
of corruption. The efforts of guer
rillas to intimidate voters from cast
ing their ballots failed miserably. So
did appeals for protest votes.
In previous elections as many as 50
percent of the ballots cast were blank
or spoiled; in the March 1982 elec
tions, by dramatic contrast, no more
than 11 percent of the ballots were
cast in this fashion.
The editorial said that the parties
on the left that did not participate in
the election "have the support of a
large percentage of the population."
What evidence do you have of this?
Since these parties refused to partici
pate in the elections, how can you
know how much support they have?
How can anyone know? All one can
say is that the Salvadoran people re
jected overwhelmingly the appeals

from these leftist parties that voters
either not vote or spoil their ballots.
Beyond this any estimate of the
amount of popular support these
parties have is mere conjecture.
The Daily stated flatly that Major
Roberto D'Aubuisson "ordered the
1979 murder of Archbishop
Romero." In the first place,
Archbishop Romero was murdered
in 1980. In the second place, the role,
if any, of D'Aubuisson in the Romero
murder has not been established. In
deed, your own news story on May 5
(front page) quotes Col. Adolfo Ma
jano, who implicates D'Aubuisson in
the Romero murder, as saying, "My
impression is that he is involved ..."
By repeatedly asserting that the
United States government favored
D'Aubuisson and the right in general
the Daily implies that the United
States supports a policy of political
murder in El Salvador. In making
these claims the Daily ignores the fact
that the United States gave firm sup
port to former President Jose
Napoleon Duarte of the Christian
Democratic Party, despite bitter
criticism from both the right and the
left.
The Daily also ignores the fact that
the Reagan administration denied a
tourist visa to D'Aubuisson until the
election and after the election
sought to move the rightist parties in
general and D'Aubuisson in particu
lar toward the political and soci
oeconomic center in El Salvador.
The Salvadoran elections in March
of this year were neither "il
legitimate" nor a "travesty of de
mocracy," as the Daily claims. They
were an affirmation of democracy
and a rejection of those forces on
both the right and the left that op
pose democracy. For an accurate,
thoughtful discussion of the situation
in El Salvadoran, I refer readers to an
article by Paul Sigmund in the April 5
issue of The New Leader.
