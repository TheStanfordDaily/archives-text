## Res Ed's formalities dichotomize grads and undergrads 
### 
Upon reading the May 12 issue
of the Daily I was somewhat surprised
to note that the on-campus co-oper
ative houses remain unfilled at the
end of the first draw. "The difficulty
in filling spots in the co-op houses on
campus will result in a serious study
bv Red Ed into their popularity and
value as living arrangements." Well,
this sort of living arrangement is in
deed quite popular with me, and I
was disappointed when informed by
the housing office that on-campus
co-ops are limited to under
graduates, thus rendering me in
capable of perhaps voicing my opin
ion in more definitive fashion — by
moving into one of them.
I lived in a house as an under
graduate that was truly co-educa
tional in the sense that in addition to
a balance of gender the cooperative

encompassed a mixture of students
over the entire undergraduate-grad
uate spectrum.
The cooperatives there, which
were popular, attempted to house
those who really wanted to live in
such an interesting situation, who
preferred to take advantage of an un
usual opportunity for dialogue be
tween graduate and undergaduate,
an opportunity as constricted at Stan
ford as at any university.
Thus, I would be pleased if, before
the awful "consolidation" takes
place and these two age groups are
further tied back from each other for
whatever reason of formality, the of
fice of Residential Education would
listen to ideas like this one, and to
other students at Stanford who might
hold the same kind of opinion.

As a recent convert to radical
feminism, I was shocked and of
fended by the front of last Wednes
day's Daily where Assistant Dean of
Residential Education Roger
Whitney referred to "a good-sized
reservoir of women to fill the open
spots" at the French House.
While this may seem like an inno
cent choice of words, I feel it, in fact,
serves to perpetuate some un
fortunate stereotypes.
Young Stanford ladies should not
be referred to as "good-sized." In
stead of constantly focusing on their
physiques, men ought to make the

effort to view them totally as persons,
taking into account their intellect,
charm, tastefulness in clothing, and
good sense of humor.
Likewise, co-eds should not be
considered as a "reservoir." The im
plication is that these women are
merely a fungible commodity like oil,
gas, or water, whose sole purpose in
life is to be bought, sold, used up,
and left behind by a male-dominated
society.
I hope that in the future the Daily
exercises stricter controlonthe words
they print. Such words only serve to
perpetuate the stereotypes that all
men are misogynists and all radical
feminists are paranoid.
