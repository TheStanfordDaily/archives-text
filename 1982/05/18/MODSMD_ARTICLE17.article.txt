Salt Lake City — Little
known Rollins College of Win
ter Park, Florida tested un
beaten Stanford at every
match, but the top-seeded
Cardinal escaped with a 7-2 win
moving them into today's
semi-final match of the NCAA
Women's Tennis Cham
pionships against fourth
seeded Trinity at 2 p.m.
UCLA and USC will meet in
the other semi-final at 10 a.m.
Stanford dropped only one
match in the singles and
clinched the win before the
doubles for the 19th time this
season.
Rollin's Vicki Nelson braved
off a strong Alycia Moulton
comeback to win the No. 1 sin
gles 6-2, 3-6, 7-5, but Stanford's
Elise Burgin sewed up her 6-4,
6-0 win over Chris Cunniff only
moments later to clinch the
Stanford win.
Moulton found herself
playing catch-up to Nelson all
afternoon dropping the first
set, coasting through the sec
ond and falling behind 3-0 in
the third.
"Moulton got started very
slowly," Stanford coach Frank
Brennan said. "Every time she
caught up, the other girl
(Nelson) ran away. She just

didn't have the extra concen
tration to put her away.
"She lost the first set, but I
wasn't worried because I think
Alycia is a better player," Bren
nan continued. "We need a lot
of concentration against this
type of player (baseliner) be
cause they don't do anything.
You have to keep attacking.
Alycia has matches like this a
lot, but she usually pulls
through. When you live on the
brink, sometimes you fall off."
Nelson said she just tried to
play a point at a time and not let
Moulton's second set charge
bother her.
"I tried not to let her get
ahead," Nelson said. "She's
done that to me a couple of
times and when she gets her
confidence going she just
keeps rolling on."
Moulton had no comment.
Rollins started the day with a
5-4 upset of Brigham Young
University in a first-round
match that was not played yes
terday because of a BYU re
ligious conflict.
"I think playing this morning
helped me out," Nelson said.
"It got me loose so I was into
my match more."
Burgin ripped Cunniff with
surprising ease at No. 2, playing
what Brennan called "one of
her best matches of the sea

son," and then teamed with
Linda Gates at No. 1 doubles to
beat Nelson and Jenni Goodl
ing at 6-1,6-2.
Kate Gompert got off to a
slow start against Goodling at
No. 3 singles, but raced
through the second set to pick
up a 7-5, 6-1 win.
Gates beat Joni Holzschuh
6-4,6-3 at No. 4, Michelle Weiss
whipped Anna Maria Kleis 6-3,
6-2 at No. 5 and Karyn
Copeland beat Lisa Dunner
6-2, 6-3 at No. 6 singles.
Sue Rasmussen and Alison
Hardey stepped into the line
up at No. 3 doubles and beat
Kleis and Dunner 6-3,6-2.
Cunniff and Holzschuh
closed out the marathon match
under lights and in blustering
winds with a 6-4, 3-6, 6-4 win
over Weiss and Gompert at No.
2 doubles.
Today, Stanford plays a Trini
ty team anchored by Louise Al
len and Felicia Raschiatore at
