Library layoff protest
About 30-35 members of the Stanford and surrounding communities picketed outside President
Donald Kennedy's office yesterday afternoon, demanding reinstatement for Ming-sheng Pai, for
merly an associate librarian at the Hoover Institution East Asian Collection. According to Richard
Katsuda, a former Stanford student and organizer of the protest, Pai was laid off at the end of 1981 in
a library "reorganization" that he feels was predicated on Pai's work against allegedly unfair Univer
sity labor policies. Though Katsuda conceded that "it's been kind of difficult to get the word out"
and draw more attention to Pai's efforts, the protesters did submit a petition with 450 signatures to
Kennedy, demanding reinstatement for Pai, punitive damages, ana a reversal of the original re
organization.
