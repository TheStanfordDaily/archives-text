## Mephisto’: a musty chronicle from an unholy age 
### Steve Vineberg 
Klaus Mann's MeptmtQ,. written in 1936, was the
earliest expose of the distingegration of intellectual life
under Hitler. Mann's protagonist, Hendrik Hofgen, was
a thinly disguised representation of Gustav Crundgens,
who achieved renown in the early '30s on the stages
and soundstages of Berlin (you can spot him as
Schranker, the head of the underworld, in Fritz Lang's M.
When the Nazis rose to power, Crundgens abandoned
his leftist loyalties and, a favorite of Goering, managed to
attain the directorship of the State Theater.
Mann (the son of Thomas Mann) saw
Crundgens/Hofgen as an embodiment of his most fa
mous role, the Mephistopheles of Goethe's Faust, whom
he played as a consummate actor who exercises the
greatest strength by acting weak and commits the basest
evil while pretending to be virtuous and faithful to his
friends. Certainly Mann could have picked no more ster
ling model of the triumph of insidious power play:
Grundgens even survived the destruction of the Third
Reich — he produced witnesses who defended his be
havior during the war — and continued to exert so much
political influence that Mann could not get his./novel
published a dozen years after he had written it and con
sequently committed suicide. (Publication was actually
held up until 1981, though Grundgens had died in 1963.)
The publicity surrounding Istvan Szabo's film of
Mephisto, which captured this year's Academy Award
for Best Foreign Film, makes it sound like a political event
— a protest against the suppression of the novel over
four and a half decades. That sort of hype always makes
m'e wary, because it's such a handy defense against
criticism: if you don't like the movie, somehow you are
allied with the bad guys who didn't want the book to
reach its public. But it isn't a very good movie, though
Szabo's reputation as a director of considerable in
telligence precedes him, and there are moments that
confirm his stature — notably one alarming aerial shot of
a band of Hitler youth pinioned against the sidewalk in a
formation that suggests the lunacy of a Busby Berkeley
number.
As a whole, however, Mephisto is disjointed and a lit
tie stolid; it lacks rhythm and shape. The first 15 minutes
are so abrupt and so much in them goes unexplained
people and places and circumstances — that I don I
think it likely that anyone who hasn't read the book will
be able to get his bearings tor a while And the editing is
otten dismaying - gripping moments dissipate when
small, slow scenes tollow them. We are never allowed to
be swept away
Mann's novel isn't terribly well written — at least, it
seems mediocre in translation — but the fascinating sub
iect matter keeps you reading. Furthermore, you know
that he is cataloguing the follies and tragedies of the cul
tural elite in Germany in the with the authenticity

of one who has been among them, even if you don't
make the connections between the characters and their
real-life counterparts. (Theater history buffs may recog
nize actress Elisabeth Bergner and director Max Rein
hardt.) The movie fails to convince us as strongly, be
cause even though the period has been rendered with
care, it doesn't have the seductiveness that other movies
have given it — Cabaret, for example, or The Conformist
— except in the performance of Klaus Maria Brandauer,
who plavs Hofgen. Brandauer's acting has a strange mix
ture of commitment and self-consciousness; when you
see him as Mephisfb in a couple of scenes from Faust (the
film's highlights, I thought), vou may think of Mick Jag
ger.
Brandauer's isn't the only commendable acting in
Vfep/wsfo, but none of the other players reach beyond
the confines of the film. Krystyna janda, a Hofgen's first
wife, Barbara, conveys the discomfort of a woman who
feels she must uproot herself in order to appease her po
litical conscience. (This situation was not as uncommon
in pre-war Germany as we might think: Fritz Lang, for ex
ample, fled Germany to avoid being made Hitler's per
sonal filmmaker — a privilge he bestowed instead upon
Leni Riefenstahl — while his wife, screenwriter Thea von
Harbou, stayed behind to work for the Third Reich.)
As Caesar von Muck, whom Hofgen succeeds as direc
tor of the Prussian State Theater, Christian Grasshof
dresses up a conventional snake-in-the-grass role with
some imaginative flourishes. Unfortunately, Karin Boyd,
in the pivotal part of Hofgen's black mistress Juliette
(whose relationship with Hendrik has been laundered
for the movie), makes no sense out of her character. She
is all angst and affectation, and she drifts through the pic
ture — she appears to have discovered no motivation for
any of Juliette's actions. She might be a refugee from a
Fassbinder movie.
