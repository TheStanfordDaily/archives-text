# Looking for a gap in the divide in 'Continental Drift'

Continental Drift
Berkeley Stage Company
Continental Drift is a series
of glimpses into a year in the
lives of Casey (a woman) and
David, recent graduates of Co
lumbia who are traveling the
country courtesy of a poetry
writing grant given David. We
see them, not on the road, but
in their friends' and relatives'
living rooms, and at their final
destination, their own San
Francisco apartment, where
the play begins and ends. After
glimpses of their own into the

lives of quiet desperation
being led by those who have
settled down, they are forced
by circumstance and dramatic
logic to think about and
choose their own future(s) —
settled or nomadic, together or
apart.
The play's world premiere at
Berkeley Stage is being spon
sored by a Rockefeller Founda
tion Grant of $3500, eight of
which arc given yearly to
selected American theater
companies to support residen
cies by local playwrights. The
playwright in this case is San
Franciscan Elizabeth Wray.

Wray's background may be
of interest to aspiring play
wrights: she was an under
graduate at Mills College in
Oakland, did an MFA in poetry
at Columbia, published in
small East Coast journals and
produced radio poetry shows,
returned to the Bay Area in
1980, and has had four plays
produced locally since (at the
Playwright's Festival, the
Eureka Theatre and the Julian
Theatre prior to this). Con
tinental Drift seems to indicate
that you can be produced at an
important smaller company
without having learned much

in the way of structure; what
is the ability to write
good dialogue, create sharp
characters, and pick up on the
oddities of intellec
tual/neuroticspeech. Wray ex
cels at all of these.
She has created a patois for
her characters made up of
slang, college catch-phrases,
and remembered bits from
books read for courses. The
characters are at their best
when chantingthisateach oth
er; when Casey, in a series of
blackouts set in that terminal
apartment, soliloquizes about
herself and David in more

direct terms, the pseudo-pro
found banality of her speech is
almost physically discomfort
ing. Luckily, most of the play is
made up of the badinage de
scribed above; the characters'
uncertainties show up better
beneath this membrane of
thoughtless talk than they do in
Casey's direct addresses.
The play is, at heart, a rite of
passage for Casey. While it's
highly "formal" — the shifts of
scene keep us constantly aware
of the playwright's heavy form
ing hand — it's strangely form
less. We see what happens last
first; there's nothing wrong
with this in principle, but when
the point of the play is Casey's
journey to knowledge, all

chance of suspense disappears
when we're given the final rev
elation in the first scene. The
scenes in between (Casey and
David visit an artsy married
couple in Massachusetts, an
artsy lesbian couple in New
York, and Casey's artsy parents
in Oklahoma) are repetitive —
the hosts all have variations of
the same problem (angst,
you'd call it) — and the only
real movement in the play is
Casey's movement toward self
awareness.
This places a heavy burden
on Beth Sweeney, who plays
Casey. Sweeney is more than
capable of bearing it — her
straightforward, unaffected
performance holds together

the play. She succeeds at one
the hardest jobs in acting:;
learning on stage. Perhaps the
best measure of her success is
that we believe her before,
during, and after her learning
process.
After Sweeney, the cast is less
than sterling. There are several 1
truly bad performances, which
is surprising given Berkeley
Stage Company's reputation.
Jerry Landis, playing Casey's
father, and Barbara Bloom, as a
frustrated lesbian friend, stand
out simply for their pro
fessionalism.
The set was designed by Wil
liam Eddelman, a member of;
the Stanford drama faculty? •
