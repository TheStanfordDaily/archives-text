Kennedy staff lunch
Remember the staff lunch with
University President Donald Ken
nedy today at noon. The lunch for
mat will be something like a press
conference so come prepared with
your questions for the president.
Daily shirts
We don't use ink around here
much anymore (VDTs have been the
rage for nearly two years), but anti
quated cartoonist Mark Wilson
doesn't know that yet. We won't hold

it against him: we were so awed by
his barefoot, post-kegger jog to Zot's
that we won't worry about the little
stuff. Anyway, Wilson has designed
an awesome Daily t-shirt. The dead
line for ordering the shirts (to ensure
that we get them before the end of
the year) is after the staff lunch today.
ASSU meeting
"It will be short," promised new
Senate Chair Raga Elim, "but it's im
portant." Meeting of the 13th Senate
tonight, 7 p.m., in the ASSU offices.
