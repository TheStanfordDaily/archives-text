# 'No Values' Klingler slams into the editor's chair
## 
### 
The Punts. The Dead Kennedys.
The Klinglers.
The punk music world was rocked
last night when The News hit The
Beat. Yes, one of its own — The Kl
ingler — has ridden a bullet to the
top of the Daily non-political hier
archy and will edit Volume 102 next
fall.
The Music may never be The Same.
Rolling Stone has announced that
Richard Klingler, the man who made
razor-sharp sarcasm and glass break
ing the sound o' the spring, was
elected editor-in-chief last night fol
lowing the release of his latest album,
Flexibility.
In his characteristic L.L. Scream red
patent leather boots and turquoise
tie, The Klingler accepted the honor
with a foul gesture and a curt nod,
hissing, "The Word will return. In fact
a lot of words will return which have
been absent from this Polly
Purebread scene."
"Words like happiness and
peace?," murmured one obvious '60s
reject currently kept around for con
sulting purposes. The Klingler dis

posed of the deadbeat with dispatch
and disgust, sneering "Think you're
gonna be around next fall, huh?"
Dark Genius Klingler's experience
includes a short stint as a
speechwriter for University President
Donald Kennedy's brief Senate bid,
ar unfruitful struggle last summer to
find a "Common Cause" to pursue
and a few months as official ASSU
beat reporter.
Few on the staff will forget the
night he wrote his first song, a coun
try ditty entitled "Oh, Lord, I'm Too
Drunk to Drive but not Drunk
Enough to Last through the ASSU
Meeting."
After the results were announced,
Klingler immediately began slam
dancing and managed to bash into
the women's bathroom. Before exit
ing to go purge Tab from the soft
drink machine, Klingler, singing
"Love Stinks," spray-painted "his
torical context" over one particularly
poignant graffitto from the previous
administration which questioned
whether Klingler was really a "regu
lar" guy.

Consistent with the title cut from
his album, Klingler said last night the
Daily will likely only appear three
times a week and will alternate be
tween a morning and afternoon pa
per because "getting it out right is
more important than getting it out at
all."
Several staffers were worried
about one of Klingler's tunes called
"No more Inverted Pyramid." He ex-
Elained with permanently furrowed
row that from now on all stories will
be written in a style "setting the
stage, clarifying the ambiguities and
acknowledging that nothing in this
paper will ever be as magnificent as a
sunset in Big Sur when you're cold
and hungry."
Meanwhile, Klingler's back-up,
managing editor-elect Douglas
"Vuarnet" Jehl had already set to
work cleaning out the managing edi
tor's desk, even before the victory
song was over, and had placed his Bo
Derek-autographed beercan andsto
len street sign collection in the edi
tor's office.
Current M.E. Julie Kaufmann, in a

rare show of mild annoyance, threat
ened to comment out loud about "a
little teensy memory of something I
thought I saw once." Jehl exited, tail
between his legs.
Earlier in the evening, a mild feud
had erupted between Jehl and Klash
Klingler following Klingler's an
nouncement that he would be re
placing the Daily Ink Bowl next fall
with a squash tournament.
"Oh, man, you never told me that.
Shoot," said Jehl (Jehl later admitted
that his first reaction — similar to the
one he had when he learned that tui
tion would be increased next year —
was an obscenity).
Alleged ex-editor and current Dai
ly clone Sam Howe, when asked for
his reaction to the election results,
exclaimed, "My God The bottom
has dropped out (112 the editor's
chair!"
Residents of Hurlburt, where Kl
ingler allegedly lives, reacted to the
news of their favorite son's election
with mild surprise: "Richard who?"
asked one perplexed resident. "Pat
told us he had a single."
