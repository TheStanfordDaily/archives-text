# Office expands to meet spring demand
## Clearinghouse opens early 
### Kathy Christie 
The Clearinghouse, formerly held once a year in the
iate summer, will be open next week to help students get
an early start in the search for off-campus housing.
The Clearinghouse, sponsored by the Office of Resi
dential Education, provides listings of available off-cam
pus rentals. Clearinghouse Director Dan said
he anticipates that 5000 students will seek off-campus
housing in the 1982-83 school year, and hopes that an ad
ditional Clearinghouse in the spring will help more stu
dents because this is one of the peak times when places
are turning over.
As Rodger Whitney, assistant dean for residential
education and director of housing, said, "We're trying to
give them two shots at it."
"It's a sort of expanded Rental Housing Office," said
Whitney, noting that during the Clearinghouse there
will be a "beefed-up extra staff" to answer questions and
make suggestions.
In order to elicit more listings for both the summer and
the fall, Kerrigan sent out letters to community members
that had either provided housing in the past or who
might not know about the Rental Housing Office.
Of the 600 letters, Kerrigan has so far received approx
imately 20 responses from people asking for further in
formation. He said he considers this to be a good re
sponse, although he does not know exactly how many of
those people have actually provided the office with new
listings.
Besides landlords, Whitney said that the office is
"trying to get listings of 'good deals' by getting refer
ences from students." He hopes that students currently
looking for housing can benefit from those who now

have good housing or know where it can be found.
Student involvement will also be necessary for what
Whitney called a "roommate locater service." The ser
vice will operate on a self-serve basis: students will come
in to fill out cards with such information as their personal
interests, what they are looking for in a roommate, and
what they are looking for or have found in a place to live.
Kerrigan said that such a service previously operated
during the Clearinghouse, but this one will run year
round.
Maps and publications describing the area will also be
available at the Clearinghouse. Life Off The Farm, a
guidebook to the communities surrounding the Univer
sity published by Res Ed, has been expanded from a set of
brochures into a book this year. Whitney said that it was
"designed for off-campus students, but on-campus stu
dents could benefit from it as well," as it provides gener
al information about the community, shopping, housing
and entertainment.
Kerrigan said that there is a sample copy of the book in
the Rental Housing office which people are free to refer
to; copies sell for $2.50.
Whitney said that most of the funding for the Spring
Clearinghouse will come from fees charged to pros
pective landlords who list with the Rontal Housing Of
fice, and that this will help to pay for the extra staff. Ker
rigan said that any other expenses, such as mailing and
advertising, are funded by the Dean of Student Affairs
Office.
The Spring Clearinghouse will be open 8 a.m.-5 p.m.,
including lunch hour, and will be located on the third
floor of Old Union outside the Rental Housing Office.
