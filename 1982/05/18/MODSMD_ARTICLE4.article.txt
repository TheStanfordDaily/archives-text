Thatcher threatens attack on Argentina
London — Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher said yesterday that Brit
ain will give U.N. talks one more chance to settle the Falkland Islands
conflict, but reportedly warned Argentina it has 48 hours to make
peace. Eight of the 10 Common Market nations extended trade bans
against Argentina, but for only a week.
"We have gone as far as we can," Thatcher told Independent Radio
News, clearly exasperated by what she called Argentine intransigence.
"They are the invader. They are the aggressor. We are the aggrieved."
Asked how long she would wait before abandoning the efforts by
U.N. Secretary-General Javier Perez de Cuellar, Thatcher said, "My
guess is that we shall know this week whether we are going to get a
peaceful settlement or not."
Earlier, Britain's domestic news agency Press Association quoted mili
tary sources as saying Thatcher told U.N. Ambassador Anthony Parsons
to warn Argentine negotiators they must settle in 48 hours or she would
order troops aboard the Royal Navy war fleet to
storm the South Atlantic islands.
Perez de Cuellar, saying his peace effort was
"in the last days," met with Parsons and Argen
tine Deputy Foreign Minister Enrique Ros.
Parsons flew back to New York following week
end consultations in England and said he would
lay down Britain's final conditions for a diplo
matic solution.
British and Argentine sources said there were
objections from both sides to details of a pro
posed U.N. interim administration of the
falklands and of suggestions for withdrawing
military forces from the area.
Falklands talks stalled
Buenos Aires, Argentina — A United Nations
effort to arrange peace between Britain and Ar
gentina has stalled and only new concessions by
Britain can prevent a major new round of fight
ing in the South Atlantic, Argentine govern
ment sources said yesterday.
After a meeting over the weekend to con
sider the results of eight days of talks conducted
by U.N. Secretary General javier Perez de
Cuellar in New York, Argentine government of
ficials were pessimistic about reaching an early
agreement, the well-informed sources said.
Argentina has not significantly changed its
position on the crucial issue of sovereignty over
the disputed Falkland Islands in the last several
days, and the government has decided to make
no more concessions for now, the sources said.
Government officials yesterrday cited the
continued British attacks on the Falklands as ev
idence that London has yet to seriously concen
trate on a diplomatic solution to the long con
frontation over the Falklands, which Argentine
has occupied since April 2.
In contrast, they said, Argentina has made
concessions in the talks with Perez de Cuellar,
softening the nature of the conditions it has de
manded for future, director negotiations be
tween Britain and Argentina over the territo
ries.
Argentina is still insisting that conditions be
attached to the agreement that would direct the
talks toward an inevitable recognition of Argen
tine sovereignty over the Falklands and their
dependencies, the South Georgia and South
Sandwich Islands, government officials said.
Among these conditions are a fixed time period
for the negotiations and a mechanism for reach
ing an agreement when the time expires.
Reagan backs prayer proposal
Washington — President Ronald Reagan de
livered yesterday on his promise to submit a
school prayer proposal, sending Congress a 37-
word constitutional amendment that would

nullify the Supreme Court's 20-year ban on or
ganized prayer in public schools.
Following a formula the president laid down
during a National Prayer Day observance May 6,
the proposed amendment would forbid in
terpretation of the Constitution to bar prayer in
schools and other public institutions. It also
would outlaw compulsory participation in
prayer services.
In a message submitted with the amendment
Reagan voiced confidence that it"will be quick
ly adopted," but there was some doubt that
Congress will complete action on the proposal
this year.
To become law, a proposed constitutional
amendment must pass both houses of Congress
by a two-thirds vote and then be ratified by the
legislatures of three-fourths of the states. The
resolution embodying Reagan's proposal
would put a seven-year time limit on the ratifi
cation process.
Polls indicating public support for prayer in
schools, plus the president's all-out backing for
the amendment, will give impetus to the amed
ment's passage. However, vigorous opposition
is expected from civil libertarians and some oth
er groups. However, extended hearings could
forestall floor action as the election-year Con
gress clears its decks for adjournment.
The text of the proposed amendment reads:
"Nothing in this Constitution shall be con
strued to prohibit individual or group prayer in
public schools or other public institutions. No
person shall be required by the United States or
any state to participate in prayer."
Reagan noted in his message that the amend
ment not only would leave communities free to
determine whether prayer should be permitted
in their public schools, but would allow individ
uals "to decide for themselves whether they
wish to participate in prayer."
Reagan noted that President George Wash
ington said in his farewell address that it was un
likely that "national morality can prevail in ex
clusion of religious principle." Reagan also re
called that Benjamin Franklin had argued for
daily prayer at the Constitutional Convention of
1787.
"Just as Benjamin Franklin believed it was
beneficial for the Constitutional Convention to
begin each day's work with a prayer, I believe it
would be beneficial for our children to have an
opportunity to begin each school day in the
same manner," Reagan said. "Since the law has
been construed to prohibit this, I believe that
the law should be changed."
Trudeau urges arms talks
South Bend, Indiana — Canadian Prime Min
ister Pierre Elliott Trudeau plans to press the
Reagan administration during NATO and eco

nomic summit meetings next month to aban
don the strategy of linking East-West trade and
arms control negotiations to Soviet behavior on
political questions.
Trudeau said he had greeted President
Ronald Reagan's call this month for new
strategic arms reductions talks with Moscow
with "congratulations and relief." But the Ca
nadian leader emphasized in an interview here
that he and Reagan's major European economic
and military partners will be "pushing on him"
for a more explicit rejection of the controversial
"linkage" strategy that has helped stall serious
arms negotiations during the past two years.
This course could put Trudeau, who pre
viously has worked hard to keep the United
States from being isolated at international con
ferences, at odds with the Reagan adminis
tration at the seven-nation economic summit in
Versailles beginning June 4. Washington has in
dicated that it will make further restrictions on
credits that finance East-West trade, and the
dangers of Western European economic de
pendence on Soviet exports, central themes of
the meeting.
Interviewed late Sunday after he had de
livered the commencement address at Notre
Dame University, the Canadian leader said, "If
we're going to reach the day when we're going
to be able to verify each other's military
arsenals, we may be better equipped to do that
if we have created some trade and other rela
tions (before)."
