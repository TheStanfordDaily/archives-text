# University polling non-union personnel

The University's Task Force on Personnel Poli
cies and Administration sent a survey to 1300 non
union Stanford employees last week as part of a
process that will culminate with recommendations
concerning employee pay and classification levels,
merit pay increases, and increased employee de
cision-making being sent to University President
Donald Kennedy and the administrative council.
Task force co-chairperson Robert Parker, direc
tor of personnel, said it is "really premature" to
speculate on what the task force recommenda
tions will be. The task force is due to report to Ken
nedy "sometime in the fall," Parker said.
The purpose of the survey is "to elicit some sort
of response on what University employees are
thinking on a variety of issues," said Santiago
Rodriguez, a task force member and an affirmative

action officer for the University.
The survey questions dealt with issues of pay, su
pervision, working conditions and benefits.
The $40,000 cost of the survey was justified,
Parker said, because for the last 10 years, "there
hasn't been any kind of complete or systematic
look at Stanford's relationship with its employees
and personnel."
Task force members expressed some dissatisfac
tion with present University personnel policy. "I, a
number of us, think that things can work better
than they are now," Parker said.
Two things that need to be done, Parker said, are
to clarify the University's position on "itself as an
employer," and to increase communication be
tween University employees.
Electrical Engineering Prof. Robert White, a task
force member, said that the group had "a number
of recommendations that we have to make de

cisions on." The issues include whether the pay
classifications should be fewer and broader than
they are now, whether individual departments of
the University should have more autonomy in ad
ministrating salaries within the department, and
how important merit, longevity, and cost-of-living
adjustments should be in determining pay raises,
he said.
No United Stanford Employees members were
included in the survey because of possible legal
problems, Parker said. The survey dealt with ques
tions that "are all subjects of collective bargain
ing." The union is the exclusive representative of
its members, Parker said. "It's illegal for us to go
directly to the employees."
The task force was appointed in September 1901
by Kennedy. It will disband in the fall after its re
port is made.
