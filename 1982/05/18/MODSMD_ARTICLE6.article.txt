Accusations of unfair management
policies being made by Tresidder
Union's maintenance and custodial
crew have kept alive a controversy
which began nearly nine months ago
with the lay-off of maintenance em
ployee Rick Hernandez.
Workers claimed that as a result of
Hernandez's lay-off, the crew has
been understaffed and unable to
complete its duties in the allotted
time, and that work that was being
done by Hernandez is now being giv
en to outside contractors at prices
much higher than Hernandez's
salary.

Tresidder management claimed
that there has been no change in the
level of crew staffing and that the
work load has actually decreased
since the crew is no longer respon
sible for maintaining Encina Station
and the offices of the Daily. Man
agement also said that the outside
contracting is cost-effective.
Ah Kau Lee, lead workman for the
Tresidder crew, said "they (Tresidder
management) are paying pro
fessionals three to four times Rick's
hourly salary to do work he was
capable of doing himself." Lee cited
jobs such as unclogging rain gutters,
light electrical work, and minor door
adjustment as examples of work

Hernandez could have done.
Tresidder Union Director Ellie Op
penheim said she feels that the con
tracting out of work has proven cost
effective for the Union. "We are run
ning ahead of budget this year. Our
maintenance costs rise as a function
of increased labor costs. Since Rick's
layoff, however, there has been no
sharp increase in such costs." She ad
ded that "this is the first year we've
seen a dip in our maintenance
budget in a longtime."
Hernandez, a maintenance em
ployee, was laid off in August of 1981
after being promoted from a
custodial position. In addition, a tem
porary employee from a private per

sonnel firm was not re-hired at the
time of Hernandez's lay-off. This,
claimed Lee, has left the crew short
handed.
"I don't know where these allega
tions are founded," said Larry
Davidson, assistant director of Tres
idder. "Since I've been here, Encina
Station and the Daily building have
been removed from their workload,
though no staff reductions have
taken place." He added that a new
part-time custodial position was re
cently created, and that the staff size
is meeting the needs of the building.
He also said he feels that there is no

connection between allegations of
increased custodial work and the
Hernandez lay-off. "Hernandez was
a maintenance employee at the time
he was let go," he said. "He was
doing maintenance work and (had)
nothing to do with custodial work."
The crew, however, feels different
ly. "Hernandez was doing both main
tenance and custodial work," said
Linda Crouse, shop steward for the
crew. Crouse claimed that Davidson
issued a memo authorizing
Hernandez to do custodial work if
and when needed.
"We used him a lot in this way,"
continued Crouse, "and we were
getting a lot of jobs done. Now, since
his lay-off, it's been very difficult to
accomplish our tasks."
Workers are also claiming that an
increase in workload has led to un
due stress among the crew. "We are
being given less time to do our work
in," said Clyde Cookson, a custodian
with the crew for 19 years. He
pointed to a list recently compiled by
Davidson stating exactly what work
was to be done each day. "We've
been given less time to accomplish
these jobs and its making it very dif
ficult to work."
Also supporting this was Henry
Battle, a custodian on the night crew.
"Since the Hernandez layoff, we
ofen have to finish work the day crew
couldn't complete. We have been
working very hard."
Davidson, however, said he feels
that the work is getting ac
complished. "I have watched this
building steadily improve in quality,"
he said. "The work is getting done

very well, and many people have
commented to me on the improve
ment of Tresidder's appearance." He
cited editorials and reports in both
the Daily and the Campus Report, all
of which spoke favorably of Tres
idder improvements.
"The crew has also noticed this and
they feel proud of their work/'
added Davidson. He also expressed
confusion at the current increase of
allegations concerning management
insensitivity, stating that there has
been no increase in formal griev
ances filed against the management
staff. "The crew has expressed their
problems to me, but have never giv
en me any facts," he said. "We even
tried at one point to follow the crew's
suggestions by hiring more people
last year, but the work productivity
level stayed the same."
Despite Davidson's claim that the
crew has not been reduced, Crouse
said that the number of workers has
diminished. "Our crew has dwindled
down from 28 to only eight mem
bers," she said. "This leaves us with
severe problems of back-ups in case
of sickness, not being able to finish
work, and ultimately, morale prob
lems."
"We are definitely short-handed,"
added Gene Alvarado, a member of
the night crew. "It's frustrating know
ing what your duties are, and not
being able to finish them." He cited
examples of yardwork and various
custodial duties which he and the
crew had difficulty accomplishing.
"It's a difficult problem," ex
plained Crouse. "We feel that we are
definitely understaffed, yet man
gement feels that our crew size and
work amount are fine. However,
there is undeniably a morale prob
lem, and it must come from some
where."

and when needed.
"We used him a lot in this way,"
continued Crouse, "and we were
getting a lot of jobs done. Now, since
his lay-off, it's been very difficult to
accomplish our tasks."
Workers are also claiming that an
increase in workload has led to un
due stress among the crew. "We are
being given less time to do our work
in," said Clyde Cookson, a custodian
with the crew for 19 years. He
pointed to a list recently compiled by
Davidson stating exactly what work
was to be done each day. "We've
been given less time to accomplish
these jobs and its making it very dif
ficult to work."
Also supporting this was Henry
Battle, a custodian on the night crew.
"Since the Hernandez layoff, we
ofen have to finish work the day crew
couldn't complete. We have been
working very hard."
Davidson, however, said he feels
that the work is getting ac
complished. "I have watched this
building steadily improve in quality,"
he said. "The work is getting done

very well, and many people have
commented to me on the improve
ment of Tresidder's appearance." He
cited editorials and reports in both
the Daily and the Campus Report, all
of which spoke favorably of Tres
idder improvements.
"The crew has also noticed this and
they feel proud of their work/'
added Davidson. He also expressed
confusion at the current increase of
allegations concerning management
insensitivity, stating that there has
been no increase in formal griev
ances filed against the management
staff. "The crew has expressed their
problems to me, but have never giv
en me any facts," he said. "We even
tried at one point to follow the crew's
suggestions by hiring more people
last year, but the work productivity
level stayed the same."
Despite Davidson's claim that the
crew has not been reduced, Crouse
said that the number of workers has
diminished. "Our crew has dwindled
down from 28 to only eight mem
bers," she said. "This leaves us with
severe problems of back-ups in case
of sickness, not being able to finish
work, and ultimately, morale prob
lems."
"We are definitely short-handed,"
added Gene Alvarado, a member of
the night crew. "It's frustrating know
ing what your duties are, and not
being able to finish them." He cited
examples of yardwork and various
custodial duties which he and the
crew had difficulty accomplishing.
"It's a difficult problem," ex
plained Crouse. "We feel that we are
definitely understaffed, yet man
gement feels that our crew size and
work amount are fine. However,
there is undeniably a morale prob
lem, and it must come from some
where."

Accusations of unfair management
policies being made by Tresidder
Union's maintenance and custodial
crew have kept alive a controversy
which began nearly nine months ago
with the lay-off of maintenance em
ployee Rick Hernandez.
Workers claimed that as a result of
Hernandez's lay-off, the crew has
been understaffed and unable to
complete its duties in the allotted
time, and that work that was being
done by Hernandez is now being giv
en to outside contractors at prices
much higher than Hernandez's
salary.

Tresidder management claimed
that there has been no change in the
level of crew staffing and that the
work load has actually decreased
since the crew is no longer respon
sible for maintaining Encina Station
and the offices of the Daily. Man
agement also said that the outside
contracting is cost-effective.
Ah Kau Lee, lead workman for the
Tresidder crew, said "they (Tresidder
management) are paying pro
fessionals three to four times Rick's
hourly salary to do work he was
capable of doing himself." Lee cited
jobs such as unclogging rain gutters,
light electrical work, and minor door
adjustment as examples of work

Hernandez could have done.
Tresidder Union Director Ellie Op
penheim said she feels that the con
tracting out of work has proven cost
effective for the Union. "We are run
ning ahead of budget this year. Our
maintenance costs rise as a function
of increased labor costs. Since Rick's
layoff, however, there has been no
sharp increase in such costs." She ad
ded that "this is the first year we've
seen a dip in our maintenance
budget in a longtime."
Hernandez, a maintenance em
ployee, was laid off in August of 1981
after being promoted from a
custodial position. In addition, a tem
porary employee from a private per

sonnel firm was not re-hired at the
time of Hernandez's lay-off. This,
claimed Lee, has left the crew short
handed.
"I don't know where these allega
tions are founded," said Larry
Davidson, assistant director of Tres
idder. "Since I've been here, Encina
Station and the Daily building have
been removed from their workload,
though no staff reductions have
taken place." He added that a new
part-time custodial position was re
cently created, and that the staff size
is meeting the needs of the building.
He also said he feels that there is no

connection between allegations of
increased custodial work and the
Hernandez lay-off. "Hernandez was
a maintenance employee at the time
he was let go," he said. "He was
doing maintenance work and (had)
nothing to do with custodial work."
The crew, however, feels different
ly. "Hernandez was doing both main
tenance and custodial work," said
Linda Crouse, shop steward for the
crew. Crouse claimed that Davidson
issued a memo authorizing
Hernandez to do custodial work if
and when needed.
"We used him a lot in this way,"
continued Crouse, "and we were
getting a lot of jobs done. Now, since
