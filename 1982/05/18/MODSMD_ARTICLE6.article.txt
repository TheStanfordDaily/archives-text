Accusations of unfair management
policies being made by Tresidder
Union's maintenance and custodial
crew have kept alive a controversy
which began nearly nine months ago
with the lay-off of maintenance em
ployee Rick Hernandez.
Workers claimed that as a result of
Hernandez's lay-off, the crew has
been understaffed and unable to
complete its duties in the allotted
time, and that work that was being
done by Hernandez is now being giv
en to outside contractors at prices
much higher than Hernandez's
salary.

Tresidder management claimed
that there has been no change in the
level of crew staffing and that the
work load has actually decreased
since the crew is no longer respon
sible for maintaining Encina Station
and the offices of the Daily. Man
agement also said that the outside
contracting is cost-effective.
Ah Kau Lee, lead workman for the
Tresidder crew, said "they (Tresidder
management) are paying pro
fessionals three to four times Rick's
hourly salary to do work he was
capable of doing himself." Lee cited
jobs such as unclogging rain gutters,
light electrical work, and minor door
adjustment as examples of work

Hernandez could have done.
Tresidder Union Director Ellie Op
penheim said she feels that the con
tracting out of work has proven cost
effective for the Union. "We are run
ning ahead of budget this year. Our
maintenance costs rise as a function
of increased labor costs. Since Rick's
layoff, however, there has been no
sharp increase in such costs." She ad
ded that "this is the first year we've
seen a dip in our maintenance
budget in a longtime."
Hernandez, a maintenance em
ployee, was laid off in August of 1981
after being promoted from a
custodial position. In addition, a tem
porary employee from a private per

sonnel firm was not re-hired at the
time of Hernandez's lay-off. This,
claimed Lee, has left the crew short
handed.
"I don't know where these allega
tions are founded," said Larry
Davidson, assistant director of Tres
idder. "Since I've been here, Encina
Station and the Daily building have
been removed from their workload,
though no staff reductions have
taken place." He added that a new
part-time custodial position was re
cently created, and that the staff size
is meeting the needs of the building.
He also said he feels that there is no
