## Engineering education generates concern 
### Laurence Band Kristen Christopher 
A variety of statistics has generated
concern about the training of engineers
in this country, and it is evident that
government, education, and industry
are joining together to attack the prob
lem.
Today, about 10 percent of all engi
neering faculty positions are vacant and
approximately half of these have been
vacant for more than a year. In recogni
tion of this situation, more than 50 of
ficials from higher education, industry,
engineering professional societies, and
government attended the National En
gineering Action Conference (NEAC)
in New York on April 7 to endorse a
"Call to Action" which urges con
cerned parties to work together to meet
the shortage of engineering faculty.
While this shortage reduces the
number of engineers this country can
produce, the National Science Founda
tion (NSF) believes this quantity is also
affected by insufficient precoilege
training in mathematics and physical
sciences. Therefore, on April 15, the
policymaking body of the NSF an
nounced the formation of the Com
mission on Precoilege Education in
Mathematics, Science and Technology.
This commission plans to develop a na
tional agenda which, similar to the
NEAC's "Call to Action," will include
roles for federal, state and local govern

merits, professional and scientific socie
ties, and the private sector in confront
ing the deficiencies in education.
Problems at both primary and secon
dary levels of education were also ad
dressed at a meeting of the California
Commission on Industrial Innovation
last Wednesday.
It seems that this sudden concern
about math and science training has
been sparked by the fear that the Unit
ed States' strength in science and tech
nology is in jeopardy. Members of both
the NEAC and NSF commission have ex
pressed this worry.
In a Daily telephone interview, Wil
liam Coleman, Jr., former secretary of
transportation and co-chairman of the
NSF commission, said, "The U.S. pro
duces as many outstanding scientists
and engineers as other countries, but
not enough people are trained."
According to NSF statistics, on a per
capita basis for each engineering grad
uate produced in this country per year,
West Germany, Japan, and the Soviet
Union produce 1.4, 2.6, and 4.1 engi
neers respectively.
Since the causes of the present situ
ation are numerous and cannot be at
tributed to one group, members of vari
ous sectors of society are working to
gether to insure that our position in sci
ence and technology relative to other
countries is not worsened.

The main causes of the faculty short
age problem seem clear — adequate in
centives do not exist. Engineering facul
ty salaries lag badly behind their engi
neering counterparts in industry, and
the quality of the environment for fac
ulty has declined markedly. While
much of the equipment and instrumen
tation in the engineering laboratories
of higher education institutions date
from the 19505, industry offers the op
portunity to do research using state-of
the-art technology.
Similar incentive problems are
viewed as the primary cause of the de
cline in precollege student achieve
ment in math and science. The NSF re
ported that one-half of U.S. high school
students take no math or science
courses past grade 10, and from 1971 to
1980, the number of teachers decreased
threefold in science and fourfold in
math. Therefore, increased pay and
other types of incentives for both
teachers and students are considered
essential to reverse present trends.
It is clear that defining and producing
these incentives is viewed as a task re
quiring novel coordination among in
dustry, education and government, so
that no sector is left stranded with a
shortage of engineers. Financing these
changes will also be a coordinated ef
fort, as the burden is too large for one
group to bear, and benefits will be
widespread.
