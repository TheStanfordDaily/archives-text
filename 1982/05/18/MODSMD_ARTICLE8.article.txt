# "Sleep camp" to return

As the 70-year-old man sti s in his bed, the
spider's web network of wires and electrodes at
tached to his body instantly transmits to a com
puter every electrical impulse from his sleeping
brain, every twitch and flicker of his eyeballs, ev
ery beat of his heart. In the quiet darkness an air
conditioning unit hums softly, maintaining a
constant, moderate temperature in the small
room.
Although this may sound like a scene from a
Stanley Kubrick film or a science fiction novel, it
actually takes place right here in Lambda Nu.
Dr. William Dement of the Stanford Medical
Center Department of Psychiatry and a team of
15 trained student technicians operate the Stan
ford Sleep Camp, a program that has been run
here every summer since 1976.
There will be three main studies this year, ac
cording to Dr. Mary Carskadon, head of the
Lambda Nu team. The first, a longitudinal study
of sleep and adolescents, now in its sixth year,
will monitor the and daytime behavior of
young teenager 1 -.
A second, new study will begin on children of
ages seven to nine to collect data on the normal

sleeping habits of this previously untested
group. Lastly, a study of the elderly will examine
the effects of sleep deprivation and restriction
on the 60-to-75 year old group. These volunteers
will either be kept awake for 36 hours at a time
over a five-day period, or restricted to six hours
of sleep per night for 10 days.
Carskadon described the changes that would
transform Lambda Nu from a college dormitory
into an "unrecognizable" sleep laboratory after
June 21. Air conditioners, as well as screens to
combat mosquitoes, are installed in each room,
windows are totally blocked out, and the tele
vision lounge becomes the lab "control room,"
where testing equipment and polygraph ma
chines are set up to record sleepers' activity at
night and to monitor their daytime behavior.
Subjects, who are paid for the time they spend
at Sleep Camp, have electrodes attached to their
head, chest and legs, and are monitored
throughout the night for brain activity, eyeball
movement, muscle contractions, leg movement,
respiration and heart rate.
The 15 students who live and work at the Sleep
Camp come from a variety of majors, said
Carskadon.
