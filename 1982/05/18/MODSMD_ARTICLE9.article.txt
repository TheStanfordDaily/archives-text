# Do you know ... why the sky looks either blue or smoggy?
## 
### 
The blue sky that we ob
serve during the day results
from the interaction of sun
light with the earth's at
mosphere.
Sunlight strikes the
molecules of oxygen and ni
trogen, the main gaseous
components of the at
mosphere. These molecules
preferentially absorb and
re-emit the shorter
wavelengths of the sun's
white light. Thus, the violet
and blue wavelengths of
light are scattered in all
directions, while the longer

(green, yellow and red)
wavelenths of light pass
through down to the earth.
This scattering or filtering
out of the violet and blue
colors from the direct beam
of sunlight produces the yel
lowish color of the sun as
viewed from the earth's sur
face. Some of the scattered
light also finds its way to our
eyes. Since the human eye is
more sensitive to blue light
than to violet light, the sky
appears blue.
Dust and smoke particles,
which are much larger than
the oxygen and nitrogen

molecules, correspondingly
scatter the longer
wavelengths of light. The
presence of many of these
particles together with the
air molecules results in a
more even scattering of sun
light, giving the sky a whitish
or "smoggy" look. After a
rainstorm washes these
heavy particles out of at
mosphere, the sky returns
to its deep blue hue.
