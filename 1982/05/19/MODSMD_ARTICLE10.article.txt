## Music department hopes to grow along with new facilities 
### Karen Springen 
While the music depart
ment, long hidden away in the
Knoll, is expanding its facilities
next year to the music annex
near Dinkelspiel, it remains to
be seen whether the effects of
the enlarged and improved fa
cilities will carry over to the
music program itself.
During the past decade, the
number of music majors has
been cut in half and the ques
tion remains whether the mu
sic program will enlarge and
improve along with its facil
ities.
"Everyone's looking at the
new building as the savior,"
said senior Julie Gubrud, who
double majors in psychology
and music.
According to Albert Cohen,
chairman of the music depart
ment, about 130 to 150 under
graduate and graduate stu
dents are music majors. Be
tween 55 and 75 of these are in
the graduate program, and 60
to 80 in the undergraduate pro
gram. Cohen said nearly one
third of the undergraduates are
double majors.
"They tend to be among the
best students we have," he
added.
According to Gubrud, the
recruiting difficulty also arises
from the University's lack of a
national reputation in music.
"They can't attract the really
serious music students," she

said. "A lot of music majors are
double majors (because) they
want to have a career." She
added, "They have music as a
hobby."
Gubrud, for example, plans
to pursue a career in clinical
psychology while maintaining
music as an avocation.
"It's hard to have a dynamic
program with people who are
only halfway committed," she
said. "Stanford students are

'The new building
will make us visible
... (students) will
be interested in the
new facilities and
consequently in the
department/

students first and musicians
second."
Cohen cited general
diminishing support for the
arts. "The interest in the per
forming arts has been lessening
throughout the nation," he
said.
The problem of attracting
music majors also stems from
what Cohen called "the dif
ficult position for placement."
Senior Ruth Bonaparte, a music
major who is moving to Wash
ington, D.C. to be a freelance
harpist, said, "It's not very mar

ketable at all."
Cohen estimated that only
one-third of those students ad
mitted for their music ability —
and intelligence — actually be
come music majors.
Applicants can submit tapes
and schedule auditions. The
music department, like other
departments, then has the op
tion of sendinga recommenda
tion to admissions.
"People coming to Stanford
who have specific talent are
looked at differently by the
University," said Cohen. "That
(the recommendation) is the
only way we have of partici
pating in the admissions proc
ess."
According to Cohen, the sit
uation should improve. "The
new building will make us vis
ible," he said. "It will be good
to be centrally located," he
added. "I suspect that they
(students) will be interested in
the new facilities and conse
quently in the department."
Old facilities
The new annex represents
the first time a building has
been constructed here espe
cially for music. "We've always
had problems with facilities,"
said Cohen. "We haven't even
had adequate classrooms."
Bonaparte said, "If they are
going to have a music depart
ment, they deserve decent fa
cilities." She said most of her
classes were held in the far

from soundproof trailers be
hind the Knoll.
The Knoll, built in 1919 for
Wilbur, the third president of
the University, was taken over
by the University as the head
quarters for several wartime
groups. It previously housed
the Food Research Institute
and Statistics. But Cohen said,
" They left for new facilities."
After moving to the new fa
cilities, the music department
will retain the Knoll but leave
behind the trailers presently

used for additional classroom
space and practice rooms.
Department's program
The music department here
gives a B.A. rather than a pro
fessional degree, said Cohen.
He stressed that, unlike most
schools that award the B.A.
degree, the University requires
a minimum number of lessons
and a minimum number of
credits from ensemble work.
Bonaparte commended the
department's support of per
formers. "They have really

good performing arts teach
ers," she said. "And anyone
who wants to give a recital
can."
But she gave less praise to the
"analytic aspects" of the pro
gram. She added, "The atten
dance rate is abominable." She
also called the 10 mandatory
classes "very restricting."
Future of department
What does the future hold
for the music department? The
new facilities give hope for
both program expansion and

greater student interest. But it
remains to be seen whether
this will be enough to com
pensate for the general na
tional lack of support for the
arts.
Perhaps an emphasis on the
double major option, allowing
students the security of a
"practical" major in addition to
music, represents the best
hope for increased student in
volvement in the music pro
gram here

cilities, the music department
will retain the Knoll but leave
behind the trailers presently

used for additional classroom
space and practice rooms.
Department's program
The music department here
gives a B.A. rather than a pro
fessional degree, said Cohen.
He stressed that, unlike most
schools that award the B.A.
degree, the University requires
a minimum number of lessons
and a minimum number of
credits from ensemble work.
Bonaparte commended the
department's support of per
formers. "They have really

good performing arts teach
ers," she said. "And anyone
who wants to give a recital
can."
But she gave less praise to the
"analytic aspects" of the pro
gram. She added, "The atten
dance rate is abominable." She
also called the 10 mandatory
classes "very restricting."
Future of department
What does the future hold
for the music department? The
new facilities give hope for
both program expansion and

greater student interest. But it
remains to be seen whether
this will be enough to com
pensate for the general na
tional lack of support for the
arts.
Perhaps an emphasis on the
double major option, allowing
students the security of a
"practical" major in addition to
music, represents the best
hope for increased student in
volvement in the music pro
gram here

While the music depart
ment, long hidden away in the
Knoll, is expanding its facilities
next year to the music annex
near Dinkelspiel, it remains to
be seen whether the effects of
the enlarged and improved fa
cilities will carry over to the
music program itself.
During the past decade, the
number of music majors has
been cut in half and the ques
tion remains whether the mu
sic program will enlarge and
improve along with its facil
ities.
"Everyone's looking at the
new building as the savior,"
said senior Julie Gubrud, who
double majors in psychology
and music.
According to Albert Cohen,
chairman of the music depart
ment, about 130 to 150 under
graduate and graduate stu
dents are music majors. Be
tween 55 and 75 of these are in
the graduate program, and 60
to 80 in the undergraduate pro
gram. Cohen said nearly one
third of the undergraduates are
double majors.
"They tend to be among the
best students we have," he
added.
According to Gubrud, the
recruiting difficulty also arises
from the University's lack of a
national reputation in music.
"They can't attract the really
serious music students," she

said. "A lot of music majors are
double majors (because) they
want to have a career." She
added, "They have music as a
hobby."
Gubrud, for example, plans
to pursue a career in clinical
psychology while maintaining
music as an avocation.
"It's hard to have a dynamic
program with people who are
only halfway committed," she
said. "Stanford students are

'The new building
will make us visible
... (students) will
be interested in the
new facilities and
consequently in the
department/

students first and musicians
second."
Cohen cited general
diminishing support for the
arts. "The interest in the per
forming arts has been lessening
throughout the nation," he
said.
The problem of attracting
music majors also stems from
what Cohen called "the dif
ficult position for placement."
Senior Ruth Bonaparte, a music
major who is moving to Wash
ington, D.C. to be a freelance
harpist, said, "It's not very mar

ketable at all."
Cohen estimated that only
one-third of those students ad
mitted for their music ability —
and intelligence — actually be
come music majors.
Applicants can submit tapes
and schedule auditions. The
music department, like other
departments, then has the op
tion of sendinga recommenda
tion to admissions.
"People coming to Stanford
who have specific talent are
looked at differently by the
University," said Cohen. "That
(the recommendation) is the
only way we have of partici
pating in the admissions proc
ess."
According to Cohen, the sit
uation should improve. "The
new building will make us vis
ible," he said. "It will be good
to be centrally located," he
added. "I suspect that they
(students) will be interested in
the new facilities and conse
quently in the department."
Old facilities
The new annex represents
the first time a building has
been constructed here espe
cially for music. "We've always
had problems with facilities,"
said Cohen. "We haven't even
had adequate classrooms."
Bonaparte said, "If they are
going to have a music depart
ment, they deserve decent fa
cilities." She said most of her
classes were held in the far

from soundproof trailers be
hind the Knoll.
The Knoll, built in 1919 for
Wilbur, the third president of
the University, was taken over
by the University as the head
quarters for several wartime
groups. It previously housed
the Food Research Institute
and Statistics. But Cohen said,
" They left for new facilities."
After moving to the new fa
cilities, the music department
will retain the Knoll but leave
behind the trailers presently

used for additional classroom
space and practice rooms.
