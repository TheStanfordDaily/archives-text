# International program details Marco Polo's adventures

The Stanford Program on International
and Cross-cultural Education (SPICE) is add
ing a new dimension to NBC's epic produc
tion of Marco Polo, which runs through to
night.
SPICE is putting together a booklet that
covers a wide spectrum of historical per
spectives on Marco Polo. Discovering Marco
Polo: A Resource Guide for Teachers, a cur
riculum booklet designed for both the pri
mary and secondary school levels, is the
product of six months of work under the
China project. Beata Grant, a doctor&l stu
dent in Asian languages, is responsible for
most of the research. Professor Albert Dien

acted as faculty consultant.
"Our aim is the improvement of interna
tional and cross-cultural education, aimed at
elementary, middle, junior and senior highs
... and aimed at the teachers," explained
Dr. David Grossman, SPICE's director.
"Our focus is on northern California ...
about 80 percent of our work. But we (have
participated in some) national programs and
international programs and conferences...
we did a joint study of social studies text
books with Japan."
The roots of the program go back to the
Bay Area China Education Project of 1974. In
terest in the Orient grew upon former Presi
dent Richard Nixon's return from China.

SPICE, one of the oldest programs of its kind,
was born in 1977, in response to pressures on
the University to spread its international
knowledge to the community. SPICE is now
an umbrella for four different projects, cov
ering China, Japan, Africa and Latin America.
It is an official project of the University's
Center for Research and International Stud
ies, and the School of Education. As part of
the Bay Area Global Education Program,
SPICE provides direct services to 13 school
districts.
"We take scholarly research," said
Grossman, "and put it in a form that's useful
to schools. We draw on faculty here at Stan
ford and at Berkeley."

SPICE's research is carried out by seven
full-time professionals and seven to eight
graduate students, usually appointed as re
search assistants.
Each of the projects produces one or two
curriculum books a year. The Latin project
produced a booklet on El Salvador. The
Japan project just produced Castle Town, a
follow-up to their booklet on Shogun.
"We realize the media has more impact on
the international issues than the schools,"
commented Grossman. "We take advantage
of (shows offering an international educa
tion) whenever we can, and look at it as an
opportunity."
The research of each of the booklets may

take up to three months; the production
may last another three months. The booklets
are mailed to teachers and to other programs
like SPICE, for their use (e.g., the University
of Hawaii, Yale).
"We've noticed a shift over the years,"
Grossman said. "There's more interest at the
primary and middle school levels. But recent
programs tend to be a 50-50 split between
high schools and elementary schools."
SPICE tries to keep the price of the
booklets as close to cost as possible. "The
idea is to get them in as wide a circulation as
possible."
The projects are funded by a combination
of Federal and private foundation grants.
