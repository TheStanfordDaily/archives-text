## Editorial ASSU budget increases 
### 
The ASSU has some changes planned for next
year. To start with, Sunday flicks will cost $1.50 —
up from $1. If you are not a student, the t-sh;rt
service will cost you $7. Lecture notes, now $7.50
per quarter per class, will rise in cost to $8.
While some of this money will be reinvested in
the projects to provide better services, the bulk
of it will go toward expanding the salaries, social
activities and publicity of the ASSU. You will be
paying for a greatly enlarged ASSU: the planned
increase is a roughly $20,000 jump over the
current $81,380 budget.
Much of the expansion may be beneficial.
Salaries provide opportunities for students
receiving financial aid and reward tremendous
commitment. Publicity can alert students to
services and opportunitiesthey might not
otherwise take advantage of. Social activities can
reinvigorate the ASSU and draw more people

into student government.
But this growth comes at a time of severe
financial constraints for the University, and it
will be students who pay for this expansion. We
are not sure that the following changes will be
the best use of resources and depend on
students to tell the ASSU how effective they are.
The new budget will:
•add to the number of salaried positions,
•increase the funding for publicity from $3675 to
$8565, boost the Office of Public Affairs budget
from $1500 to $5335 and allot $1045 to reprint
and distribute the ASSU constitution and by
laws.
•designate $1500 for happy hours and parties.
The ASSU budget is growing by nearly one
fourth in one year. Now is the time to let your
senator know how you want the money that you
pay for a movie or for lecture notes spent.
