# Sowing seeds of discontent
## 
### 
The National Institute of Mental
Health recently released a report that
claims to present "overwhelming"
evidence that violence on TV can and
does cause aggressive behavior in
children. The logic involved is clear:
children frequently fed images of vi
olence will come to view it as a more
viable response.
Within this logic there lies a princi
ple that history has recurrently
proven and that man has continually
forgotten. It is, simply stated by Paul
of Tarsus, "whatever a man sows, this
he will also reap."
It is the principle that has felled
tyrants with the tools of their own
tyranny. By this principle, the Roman
Republic crumbled — destroyed by
the violence its politicians had found
so effective in employing for their
own gain. The great tragic characters
of literature have sown the seeds of
their own fate. Unfortunately, Jlhe.
lessons of history and lityamte j?<{e
in ihe fullness of the pre«ent.n
To a society so well edbcatfrd ih the
principles of cause and effect, the
wisdom of the quip should be ob
vious. Nevertheless while we express
dismay at the ignoble aspects of our
society, we seldom realize that col
lectively we are sowing the seeds that
can either reverse the bad fruit sown
before us, or nurture its growth. The
possibility of curbing possible harm
ful aggressive tendencies in children
is but one example.
Advertising has instructed our
generation that most problems can
be solved through buying the right
product. TV commercials and
billboards preach that decaffeinated
coffee can save marriages and that
cigarette smoking is the mark of the
liberated woman. We are told to re
linquish all hopes of a meaningful
lifestyle unless we go for all the gusto
we can, which involves drinking the
right liquor and wearing the right
clothes.
While material possessions are
often a blessing, dependence upon
them for fulfillment has become a
curse. Sowing a society grounded in
possessions, Americans have come to
chase after the golden carrot, setting
themselves on a cyclical path of con
sumption that must achieve greater
and greater thrills to survive. Many

people would probably agree that
such an attitude is and could be
harmful; nevertheless the seeds con
tinue to be sown.
Daniel Bell highlights the con
tradiction when he argues that cor
porations, while desiring to employ
the man of the Protestant work ethic
— the hard working, responsible
family man — instead through its
products and advertising encourage
an irresponsible pursuit of
"hedonism."

.. whatever a man
sows, this he will also
reap...'

In a related sphere, the relaxing of
morals has paved the way for a sexual
"openness" to pervade society in
areas such as advertising and
cinematography. While some would
call this a societal advancement, one
cannot ignore the increase in sexual
crimes and deleterious forms of sex
ual behavior that have arisen concur
rently. With greater encouragement
promiscuity, the accompany
mg problems are destined
more menacing for the next gener
ation.
The fragmentation of the family
has sown seeds that might produce
the most harmful harvest. Children
who lack secure and accepting fami
lies often turn toward delinquency.

The high rate of divorce and the tran
sitory nature of many marriage rela
tionships will no doubt have an ad
verse influence on the next gener
ation that will view it increasingly as
the norm.
Laws and organizations have multi
plied in an attempt to harness socie
ty's dilemmas. But in spite of re
habilitation centers that seek to re
habilitate criminals and juvenile de
linquents, crime increases. Although
there exists an abundance of mar
riage counselors, the rate of divorce
has not slackened. While organiza
tions expand to treat those depen
dent upon alcohol and narcotics, al
cohol and drug abuse continue to
rise.
Courts, laws and organizations in
most cases can only act as band-aids
to alleviate the pain; they cannot
treat the disease. As author C.S. Lewis
has said, no matter how you mix bad
eggs, you won't get a good omelet.
Instead, the ability and responsi
bility to ameliorate our present state
lies with us to exercise a shrewd dis
cernment of the seeds being sown in
our lives, homes and occupations. In
deed, this is where the planting is
done. We cannot pass the buck. As
Carl Jung has said, "It is becoming x
more and more obvious that it is not
starvation, not microbes, not cancer,
but man himself who is mankind's
greatest danger."

The National Institute of Mental
Health recently released a report that
claims to present "overwhelming"
evidence that violence on TV can and
does cause aggressive behavior in
children. The logic involved is clear:
children frequently fed images of vi
olence will come to view it as a more
viable response.
Within this logic there lies a princi
ple that history has recurrently
proven and that man has continually
forgotten. It is, simply stated by Paul
of Tarsus, "whatever a man sows, this
he will also reap."
It is the principle that has felled
tyrants with the tools of their own
tyranny. By this principle, the Roman
Republic crumbled — destroyed by
the violence its politicians had found
so effective in employing for their
own gain. The great tragic characters
of literature have sown the seeds of
their own fate. Unfortunately, Jlhe.

in ihe fullness of the pre«ent.n
To a society so well edbcatfrd ih the
principles of cause and effect, the
wisdom of the quip should be ob
vious. Nevertheless while we express
dismay at the ignoble aspects of our
society, we seldom realize that col
lectively we are sowing the seeds that
can either reverse the bad fruit sown
before us, or nurture its growth. The
possibility of curbing possible harm
ful aggressive tendencies in children
is but one example.
Advertising has instructed our
generation that most problems can
be solved through buying the right
product. TV commercials and
billboards preach that decaffeinated
coffee can save marriages and that
cigarette smoking is the mark of the
liberated woman. We are told to re
linquish all hopes of a meaningful
lifestyle unless we go for all the gusto
we can, which involves drinking the
right liquor and wearing the right
clothes.
While material possessions are
often a blessing, dependence upon
them for fulfillment has become a
curse. Sowing a society grounded in
possessions, Americans have come to
chase after the golden carrot, setting
themselves on a cyclical path of con
sumption that must achieve greater
and greater thrills to survive. Many

people would probably agree that
such an attitude is and could be
harmful; nevertheless the seeds con
tinue to be sown.
Daniel Bell highlights the con
tradiction when he argues that cor
porations, while desiring to employ
the man of the Protestant work ethic
— the hard working, responsible
family man — instead through its
products and advertising encourage
an irresponsible pursuit of
"hedonism."

sows, this he will also

In a related sphere, the relaxing of
morals has paved the way for a sexual
"openness" to pervade society in
areas such as advertising and
cinematography. While some would
call this a societal advancement, one
cannot ignore the increase in sexual
crimes and deleterious forms of sex
ual behavior that have arisen concur
rently. With greater encouragement
promiscuity, the accompany
mg problems are destined
more menacing for the next gener
ation.
The fragmentation of the family
has sown seeds that might produce
the most harmful harvest. Children
who lack secure and accepting fami
lies often turn toward delinquency.

The high rate of divorce and the tran
sitory nature of many marriage rela
tionships will no doubt have an ad
verse influence on the next gener
ation that will view it increasingly as
the norm.
Laws and organizations have multi
plied in an attempt to harness socie
ty's dilemmas. But in spite of re
habilitation centers that seek to re
habilitate criminals and juvenile de
linquents, crime increases. Although
there exists an abundance of mar
riage counselors, the rate of divorce
has not slackened. While organiza
tions expand to treat those depen
dent upon alcohol and narcotics, al
cohol and drug abuse continue to
rise.
Courts, laws and organizations in
most cases can only act as band-aids
to alleviate the pain; they cannot
treat the disease. As author C.S. Lewis
has said, no matter how you mix bad
eggs, you won't get a good omelet.
Instead, the ability and responsi
bility to ameliorate our present state
lies with us to exercise a shrewd dis
cernment of the seeds being sown in
our lives, homes and occupations. In
deed, this is where the planting is
done. We cannot pass the buck. As
Carl Jung has said, "It is becoming x
more and more obvious that it is not
starvation, not microbes, not cancer,
but man himself who is mankind's
greatest danger."
