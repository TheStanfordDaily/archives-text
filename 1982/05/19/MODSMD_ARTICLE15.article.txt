## 'Straight' acceptance of gays 
### 
I'd like to congratulate Stuart Re
ges for writing the article that ap
peared in the May 12 issue of the Dai
ly. It takes genuine courage for any
one anywhere to be open about
being gay and especially to do so
where he lives and works. But I per
ceive Reges' apparent openness to
be sharply at odds with the content of
his piece, which is a sustained argu
ment against openness for gays.
My chief objection focuses on the
ultimate stage of Reges' odyssey: "I
very soon realized that tolerance
meant very little to me. I missed
being part of the whole the way I was
in high school. So I tried something
even more radical. I stopped telling
people I was gay." The progress
which led to this conclusion, as Reges
describes it, is infected from the be
ginning with fear of rejection and
sorrow at the loss of heterosexual
privilege, not with joy and pride in
being gay. As Reges himself de
scribes it, he was a virgin in high
school, a neuter man who passed for
straight. So the wholeness he ex
perienced then had a pretty big hole
in it: sexuality. Butf-at least in those
days he was accepted asione of the
boys: "I had always been the favorite
son and the teacher's pet. I was even
popular among my friends. Sex was
unimportant." It seems it isn't pos
sible to be both openly gay and pop
ular (at least with non-gay people).

Hmmm.
Reges' view of what it means to be
gay is thus very clearly linked to his
fall from his sexual adolescent para
dise where he was O.K. with the
straight world. When he came out he
didn't gain his gayness; he lost his
straightness. And this hurt. The
progress which Reges then describes
consists in trying out different
strategies to regain acceptance and
approval from straight society.
In fact, his article is not about being
gay at Stanford at all. It is about not
being gay. All Reges' images of gay
ness are negative ones. Even when he
imagines coming out to his students
he can envisage only their shock and
disapproval. He hears himself telling
them: "My lecture isn't completely
prepared today because the man I
went out with last night kept me out
till four." If a heterosexual teacher
made a similar admission to his stu
dents they might not be shocked but
they would have every right to be in
sulted at his lack of professionalism.
He now justifies silence because his
reality might be too offensive. The
belief which underlies this apparent
contradiction is "Gay it not as good as
straight but I sure can try."
Though he doesn't come out and
say it, Reges has swallowed entire the

straight definition of what it means to
be gay: he seems himself as a partial
human being forever denied the
beatific state of heterosexual
wholeness. His self-concept is low
because he enslaves himself to the
very thing he once professed to op
posed: straight prejudice. He is like a
battered child who is hooked on the
cycle of abuse.
If the dominant culture can't deal
with gays or blacks or deaf people
there is something profoundly
wrong, morally wrong, with it, not
with me. Specifically at Stanford, gay
and lesbian couples don't have ac
cess to subsidized housing for mar
ried students, though they may be as
"married" to each other as many
straight couples who benefit from
the privileges of a heterosexist legal
system. Instead they must go into the
overpriced Palo Alto market, where
the November 3, 1981 defeat of
Measure B denied them the protec
tion of a non-discrimination law.
Because of the double perspective
I haye,a§ a member of minority group
and as one who lives and com
municates in the majority culture, I
can do the straight people a favor by
bringing my self and my insights into
the open. But, on a much simpler
level, every time I'm openly gay in my
daily life I am exposing non-gay peo
ple to the positive reality of who I am,
which includes (among other things)
being gay. Since I don't fit their stere
otypes (or not all of them), I auto
matically challenge their cherished
false assumptions about the way the
world is, I make them think twice,
which doesn't seem like a bad thing
for a teacher — or anyone else — to
do. I don't do this in order to please
or appease straight people but be
cause I have to be myself.
I don't pretend that such openness
is always easy or pleasant. It has taken
me a long time to see its importance.
But anything less protects the non
gay world from its own ignorance, an
ignorance that oppresses me daily.

being gay. Since I don't fit their stere

I'd like to congratulate Stuart Re
ges for writing the article that ap
peared in the May 12 issue of the Dai
ly. It takes genuine courage for any
one anywhere to be open about
being gay and especially to do so
where he lives and works. But I per
ceive Reges' apparent openness to
be sharply at odds with the content of
his piece, which is a sustained argu
ment against openness for gays.
My chief objection focuses on the
ultimate stage of Reges' odyssey: "I
very soon realized that tolerance
meant very little to me. I missed
being part of the whole the way I was
in high school. So I tried something
even more radical. I stopped telling
people I was gay." The progress
which led to this conclusion, as Reges
describes it, is infected from the be
ginning with fear of rejection and
sorrow at the loss of heterosexual
privilege, not with joy and pride in
being gay. As Reges himself de
scribes it, he was a virgin in high
school, a neuter man who passed for
straight. So the wholeness he ex
perienced then had a pretty big hole
in it: sexuality. Butf-at least in those
days he was accepted asione of the
boys: "I had always been the favorite
son and the teacher's pet. I was even
popular among my friends. Sex was
unimportant." It seems it isn't pos
sible to be both openly gay and pop
ular (at least with non-gay people).

Hmmm.
Reges' view of what it means to be
gay is thus very clearly linked to his
fall from his sexual adolescent para
dise where he was O.K. with the
straight world. When he came out he
didn't gain his gayness; he lost his
straightness. And this hurt. The
progress which Reges then describes
consists in trying out different
strategies to regain acceptance and
approval from straight society.
In fact, his article is not about being
gay at Stanford at all. It is about not
being gay. All Reges' images of gay
ness are negative ones. Even when he
imagines coming out to his students
he can envisage only their shock and
disapproval. He hears himself telling
them: "My lecture isn't completely
prepared today because the man I
went out with last night kept me out
till four." If a heterosexual teacher
made a similar admission to his stu
dents they might not be shocked but
they would have every right to be in
sulted at his lack of professionalism.
He now justifies silence because his
reality might be too offensive. The
belief which underlies this apparent
contradiction is "Gay it not as good as
straight but I sure can try."
Though he doesn't come out and
say it, Reges has swallowed entire the

straight definition of what it means to
be gay: he seems himself as a partial
human being forever denied the
beatific state of heterosexual
wholeness. His self-concept is low
because he enslaves himself to the
very thing he once professed to op
posed: straight prejudice. He is like a
battered child who is hooked on the
cycle of abuse.
