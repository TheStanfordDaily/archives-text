## Prospects for Argentina's economic recovery 
### 
For many years the failure of Ar
gentina to prosper, either politically
or economically, has been lamented
by both Argentine and foreign ob
servers. The war over the Malvinas,
or Falkland Islands, has finally suc
ceeded in uniting the nation; hopes
that this state of affairs will have any
lasting beneficial effect on the coun
try are, however, likely to be dashed.
The political instability of the last
50 years has fostered economic de
cline, preventing the country from
taking the proper advantage of its
plentiful resources. After World War
11, General Juan Peron, who was
elected in the most democratic elec
tion yet held in Argentina, sought to
confirm the country as one with pres
tige and standing. With large foreign
exchange balances available in both

the United States and Britain, a level
of industrial development unusually
high for a South American country
and a heavy demand for its exports,
Argentina — and Peron — apparent
ly had everything in their favor.
Within a few years, however, Ar
gentina was well on the road to eco
nomic decline. Spain, Italy and
France recovered from the ravages of
war and quickly made Peron aware of
the faint contempt with which Ar
gentina was regarded. His attempts at
forming liaisons with other South
American countries failed, and with
his fall the country was drawn into
political turmoil. As military coup
succeeded coup, the neglect of the
economy began to be felt in ev
eryday life.
Although a high level of inflation is

usually expected in agrarian-based
economies in which the tax structure
is weak and unenforced, there can be
little doubt that in Argentina's case
such inflation is doing much damage.
Other, more industrialized countries
are daunted by the prospect of infla
tion levels in excess of 140 percent
per annum, with the result that capi
tal investment is weakened and in
dustrial development hindered. To
enter the modern world, Argentina
stands in need of a diversified econo
my, but the weakness of her govern
ment and the belief's of her people
block the way.
Largely because of the association
in the minds of the people of drives
to promote industry in Argentina
with the evils of virtual dictatorship
under Peron, succeeding govern
ments have vacillated over the de
velopment of a diversified economy.
The population clings to the idea that
Argentina is "naturally" a grazing
agricultural nation, and no political
leader has yet emerged who is
capable of rallying both the middle
and lower classes behind programs
of reform, dependable taxation and
rapid economic development.
The result is that the potential for
fishing along the coast of Patagonia,
which Japanese fishermen claim is
enormous, is neglected. Mean
while, attempts at democratic gov
ernment have grown fewer and
farther between, the last elections
having been held in 1975, and mili
tary rule having been imposed a year
later.
There is little sign that the stability
of government which is needed for
economic recovery will come into
existence in the near future. The re
peated intervention of the military in
political affairs gave rise during the
'60s to two parties within the army:
the blues, who favor an eventual re
turn to constitutional and democrat
ic government and the reds, who
support military rule for an indefinite
period. The death of Peron did little
to foster the party system, as many
observers had hoped, and at least
one political commentator believes
that military incursion will become
more and more acceptable.
The war has created some unity,
but even if this feeling is successfully

rallied behind a political party or mil
itary government it is unlikely that
the measures needed for Argentina's
economic recovery will be put into
operation. Such measures — a work
ing tax system, industrial develop
ment and perhaps even the sur
render of the Malvinas — would not
be popular, and even if an Argentine
government had the foresight to in
troduce them, it is unlikely that it
would be powerful enough to see
them carried out.
