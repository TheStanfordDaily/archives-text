## Behemoth tower: academic improvement? 
### 
My emotional state approached
ecstasy when I read that the Trustees
have seen it fit to approve the erec
tion of a 45-foot bell/clock tower for
our campus. The presence of such an
edifice will surely highlight the sense
of spaciousness already appreciated
by students converging daily in
White Plaza (soon to be named
"White Simple-Closed-Curve" upon
completion of the new music build
ing). This structure is destined to be
grouped with such fine University in
stitutions as the bollard, the oval and
Mem. Jungle-Gym.
What better way could there be to
divert bicyclists from the dangers of
bottle-necked two-way traffic in the
Quad than Stanford's very own
quartz-locked gothic behemoth? We
should honor the anonymous donor
of $250,000 (who cleverly avoided
such ostentatious displays as dona
tions for partial subsidies of faculty
housing and salaries, improvement
of campus lighting, improvement of
food service quality/efficiency, or
dorm renovation) with a few mo
ments of silence — before the clock
is afforded its opportunity to chime
in.
Seriously, Stanford, how many
more external memorials to our
greatness do we need before funds

will be channeled into perfecting ac
ademics? I realize that the Trustees
have long-term projections for the
campus, but one should remember
that the Trustees are not the Stanford
community. Perhaps the University
should request that a student voice
such as the ASSU collect student
opinions to be used as recommenda
tions for or against the imposition of
such donations on our campus. As
Pericles noted, the city is best for
tified that has a wall of men — not
bricks. I am interested in hearing
how other students feel about the
approval of "Son of Hoover Tower."
(Let's see. How many red tiles will it
take to cover the roof?)

"Mozart" is art
One can overlook the specifics of
Mitchel's ignorance (Daily, May 13)
and be content that the smug, know
nothing posturing of a sophomoric
wit will serve as its own rebuttal
when, a few years hence, he looks
back on his words with painful em
barrassment. What is considerably
more distressing is the extent to
which such drivel is symptomatic of a

wider unwillingness at Stanford to
deal with art as a living, lived pres
ence. Each new piece of public art
here, met with derision, fitted with its
inevitable moniker, sinks quietly into
a contrived, uneasy invisibility,
deprived of its dignity in the eyes —
or eyelessness — of the community.
There are, indeed, legitimate and
pressing issues concerning public art
that warrant discussion (and such dis
cussion has appeared in journals as
divergent as The Public Interest and
The Village Voice), but super
ciliousness contributes nothing to
the discourse.
True, artworks at Stanford have
been generally free from the physical
abuse that might obtain elsewhere,
but we're Stanford kids and we don't
need to sink to vandalism; we use
words (rarely ideas) and snide
laughter to militate against the ne
cessity, the possibility even, of facing
and seeing art as something that
might, just, matter. If Mitchel can't
hear Mozart, perhaps he will con
sider Gary Numan:
"You have defaced my face
when you laughed at me,
you bright young things."
