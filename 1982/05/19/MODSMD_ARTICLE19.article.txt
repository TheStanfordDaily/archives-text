Love with a crash
from the Indiana Daily Student:
Here come the kamikazi birds again,
sighed William and Mary Elliot in Indiana,
as several robins flew into the window
panes in a mild recreation of Alfred
Hitchcock's "Birds." These two bird-lov
ers have been plagued by dive-bombing
robins who have an unnatural fondness
for the den and living room windows on
the other side of their home.

Although Mrs. Elliot is convinced that
the birds are drunk from dipping into
neighborhood berry trees, the local
Audubon Society president claims that
the call of nature is the problem. Said
Donna McCarty, "This is bird mating sea
son. They see their reflections in the win
dow and assume it's another male they
must fend off to protect their territory/'
She suggested that the Elliots try put
ting tape over the windows. Peace and
quiet around the Elliot household, how
ever, remain difficult to coordinate. Said
both of them, "They come in full force at
the window — bang! It's the craziest thing
I've ever seen. '

Talk about the "real" world ... science
students from the western United States
gathered at Santa Clara University to pres
ent and hear 34 papers in the areas of ge
netics, immunology, plant and microbial
physiology, animal and cell physiology
and ecology. Modelled on a scientific
conference, the meeting purposed to
"provide a means of recognizing original
undergraduate research," reports The
Santa Clara.
Giving the keynote address on "Cells,
Molecules and Immunity" was Dr. Patri
cia Jones, from Stanford's Department of
Biological Sciences. Students also had the
chance to submit the full text of their pa
pers for consideration for one of the jeff
Rogers Memorial Awards or for publica
tion in the Wasman Journal of Biology.
Tenure alternatives
After being denied tenure by North
western University, Speech Assistant Pro
fessor Lou Castelli turned his hand from
writing up exams to writing risque scenes
for an R-rated soap opera to be aired on
cable television. The Daily Northwestern
reported that Castelli still teaches, but has
delved into several entertainment
projects, one of which is a soap opera
called "33 Bromptom Place," set on the
Gold Coast of North Chicago, It details
the exploits of three women living in a
penthouse.
Castelli said that there is tremendous
power in being able to decide, with the
stroke of his pen, the entire fate of a char
acter; he added, however, that he "takes
a real life situation arid twisis it, enlarges
it, exaggerates it, edits it to make it dra
matic and hopefully entertaining." But he
does not go overboard — the series is

geared toward a slightly more mature au
dience than network soaps.
Said Castelli, "I have no desire to sub
ject myself to seven years of work at an
other institution and then find out some
one doesn't like the color of my hair," re
ferring to the fact that his talents are more
in demand off campus than on.
Follow up on Polo
As you follow the progress of Marco
Polo from Italy to China, you may want to
supplement that view with a visit to the
California Academy of Sciences in
Golden Gate Park. According to The San
ta Clara, a multimedia exhibit entitled "It
aly: a Country Shaped by Man" presentsa
more complete, less stereotypical picture
of Italy than that held by most Americans,
even by Americans of Italian descent.
The 40-minute show ties together past
. and present without attention to the mag
nificence of ancient Rome or the Renais
sance Florence. Instead, Italy's progress
from a country of hard workers and tribal
beginnings to its sophisticated, high-tech
present is traced.
Other parts of the exhibit feature little
known Italian creations, a collection of
photographs showing 19th-century emi
grations and an explanation of Italian
energy explorations in hydroelectric
power.
The exhibit will be in San Francisco un
til June 6, and promises to extend one's
view beyond the Leaning Tower of Pisa,
the pope and pasta.

Judging beauty, beasts
From opposite parts of the United
States, one joke turns serious and another

straight-faced proposition promises to be
ridiculous.
When Rene Shimada, a freshman engi
neering student at San Jose State Univer
sity, was persuaded to enter the Cherry
Blossom Festival pageant, she consented
as a joke. Well, she was crowned queen,
and won a cash prize of $350, two
kimonos worth $15,000 each and two
round-trip tickets to Japan. Now, reports
the Spartan Daily, Shimada plans to take a
leave of absence from school for two se
mesters, due to a busy social schedule
which interferes with classes.
Her duties as Cherry Btossom Queen
include frequent trips to San Francisco
and one to Japan. As a fourth-generation
Japanese-American, Shimada deems her
new title exciting because she will learn
more about her culture. Remarked
Shimada, "I'm in my glory now ... it's a
fantastic experience."
The contestants were judged in five cat
egories: wearing a kimono, wearing an
evening gown, talent, personality and
ability to answer questions.
And with similar categories, the Uni
versity of South Carolina Kitten Klub will
host a feline beauty contest entitled
"Monsieur Cat." The Klub is a service or
ganization of about 30 students who
sponsor lecture series and raise funds for
charities. The proceeds from this en
deavor, for instance, will go to the Ronald
McDonald House Building fund.
Contestants were chosen from univer
sity fraternities and the community by in
vitation, reports Gamecock, the school
paper.

Graduated detention
In high school they kept you after
school; in college you can be heW
hostage — or so reports the Daily Kent
Stater from Kent State University. The en
tire second floor of Verder Hall was penal
ized for five days with no visitors and 24-
hour quiet hours. The isolation was im
posed because of vandalism on the sec
ond floor which resulted in a broken
clock, damages from fireworks and un
wary students being unpleasantly sur
prised when bathroom doors fell from
loose hinges.

Only a few were responsible, claimed
one freshman in the dorm, but resident
authorities have yet to name suspects. In
the meantime, the whole floor is pun
ished. The resident advisor had left for the
weekend and the resident director re
fused to comment. If the students "be
have," however/their freedoms will soon
be returned.
