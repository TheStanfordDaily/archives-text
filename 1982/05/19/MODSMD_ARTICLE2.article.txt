# Ex-NSC member critic of Caribbean policies

### David Azrin 
Robert Pastor, a Carter adminis
tration senior staff member on Latin
America and the Caribbean for the
National Security Council, criticized
the Reagan administration's Carib
bean Basin Initiative (CBI) yesterday
for the effects it may have on illegal
immigration and Caribbean agricul
ture and industrial integration.
The recently-proposed CBI, which
President Ronald Reagan announced
in a speech to the Organization of
American States last February, asks
for a 12-year tariff exemption on
most Carribean Basin exports into
the United States, a tax credit to en
courage American companies to in
vest in the region and $350 million in
additional economic aid.
The proposal has run into con
siderable opposition in the House
Ways and Means Trade Committee.
Pastor, presently a guest scholar at
the Brookings Institution, said that he
doubted the proposal will get out of

the committee this year.
Speaking to about 25 people in the
History corner, Pastor said his main
objection to the proposal was that
"the industrial development strategy
may significantly increase illegal imi
gration into the United States."
According to Pastor, more than
one-third of all illegal immigrants
come from the 20 Caribbean basin
countries.
"The fact is that this development
strategy, more often than not, has in
creased the migratory pressures in
rural areas to urban areas as well to
international migration," he said. "If
the Caribbean Basin Initiative were
passed we would actually be promot
ing illegal immigration."
"Some modifications in the CBI are
absolutely essential. We must slowly
phase in provisions outlawing illegal
immigration," he said.

BIFOCAL LENSES â€” Robert Pastor, currently a guest scholar at the
Brookings Institution and a senior staff member on the National Se
curity Council in the Carter administration criticized President
Ronald Reagan's Caribbean Basin Initiative last night.
Caribbean nations may increase un
employment there and shift scarce
resources away from public services
into the hands of private American
firms.
"Economically, it is not a panacea.
But it can contribute to the develop
ment of the region if there is more of
a balance for promoting a colonial
private sector with the necessity of
developing a public sector, if there
was a greater cooperative, regional
approach," he said.
Pastor compared the CBI to the ec
onomic policies that have been
pursued with Puerto Rico, policies
which he claimed emphasize in
dustrial development at the expense
of agricultural development.
"The policy to Puerto Rico en
couraged the development of
enclave industries that came in, im
ported their raw materials, as
sembled their products and exported
them with few linkages to the coun
try in input or output," he said.
"There was such a decline in agri
culture that more jobs were lost in
agriculture than were gained in in
dustry." he said. "And there is no

emphasis on agriculture in the Carri
bean Basin Initiative."
"There ought to be steps taken to
encourage investors to increase their
purchasing of raw materials in those
countries. Development must focus
much more on creating jobs and en
couraging research intitutes in the
area to develop labor intensive tech
nology," he said.
Pastor also criticized what he
termed the militaristic emphasis of
the CBI.
"The United States has always been
drawn to this region for strategic in
terests," he said.
"The Reagan administration's defi
nition of the problems in the region
offers two alternatives, a bright dem
ocratic future or a dark totalitarian
one, providing little room for the po
litical grayness that exists in the re
gion.
"By defining it in such polarizing
terms, it makes it more difficult to de
velop a political-military strategy that
makes sense in the region," he said.
"It is imperative politically to shift
away from the exclusive preoccupa
tion of a militaristic approach to polit
ical problems which puts them in a
position where they either must en
gage in military involvement or just
break loose altogether," he said.
