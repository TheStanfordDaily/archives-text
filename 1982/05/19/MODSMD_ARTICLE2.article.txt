Robert Pastor, a Carter adminis
tration senior staff member on Latin
America and the Caribbean for the
National Security Council, criticized
the Reagan administration's Carib

immigration and Caribbean agricul

the United States, a tax credit to en

additional economic aid.
The proposal has run into con

Ways and Means Trade Committee.
Pastor, presently a guest scholar at
the Brookings Institution, said that he

History corner, Pastor said his main
objection to the proposal was that
"the industrial development strategy
may significantly increase illegal imi

countries.

strategy, more often than not, has in
creased the migratory pressures in
rural areas to urban areas as well to
international migration," he said. "If
the Caribbean Basin Initiative were
passed we would actually be promot
ing illegal immigration."
"Some modifications in the CBI are
absolutely essential. We must slowly
phase in provisions outlawing illegal
immigration," he said.
