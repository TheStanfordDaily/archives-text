## Card 9 take first game 
### Adam Berns 
Nobody can accuse the Stan
ford baseball team of stealing
yesterday's playoff game from
Oregon State, although the
temptation is certainly there.
The Cardinal thoroughly
dominated the Beavers, poun
ding out 21 hits and stealing
nine bases en route to a 15-6
playoff victory.
Senior Brian Mignano
started the game and went the
distance for Stanford. Al
though he was not in top form
— giving up 10 hits and six runs
— he seems to progress as the
game went on and hung in un
til the end.
"He is our main guy," Mar
quess said about Mignano,
"and he definitely improved by
the end of the game. He hung
in there."
Beaver pitcher Mike
Gorman was tagged with the
loss.
The victory gives Stanford a
1-0 playoff lead in a best of
three series and Marquess
would like nothing better than
to finish this series as quickly as
possible.
"I would like to get it done as
quickly as I can," he said. "(Jim)
Wilson really scares us."
Entering the series with a .333

batting average and 58 RBIs
(one less than the school rec
ord), OSU's Wilson has been a
terror to opposing pitchers. Al
though Wilson broke his
team's RBI record with a base
hit in the sixth inning, he was
shut out most of the afternoon,
going just one-for-five.
Although the Cardinal won
handily, Marquess was im
pressed with OSU.
"They did a good job," he
said after the game. "They
batted well and came back
from that 9-3 deficit. They are a
good team and if we don't
swing the bat well, we won't
win."
For Stanford, yesterday's
game was like an extended bat
ting practice. Third baseman
Loring Davies went four-for
six, scored three runs and
reaching the bases all six times
he batted. Second baseman
Steve Buechele also played
well going four-for-six.
Although the score does not
reveal it, the game was any
thing hut decided until Stan
ford's six-run seventh inning.
The Beavers immediately
jumped on Mignano in the
bottom of the first inning to
take a 2-0 lead.

Stanford quickly closed the
gap to 2-1 in the top of the sec
ond when OSU catcher Bob
Bishop made a wild throw to
third base while Buechelle was
trying to steal. As the ball rolled
wildly out into left field, Bue
chelle scored easily.
Cardinal left fielder Mike
Dotterer led off the third in
ning with a two strike bunt.
This type of fearless play and
calculated risk taking was to be
Stanford's style the entire after
noon. Dotterer stole second
base and eventually scored on
a base hit by Davies. Hausladen
was then hit by Beaver pitcher
Gorman, putting runners on
first and second. After a
Gorman balk moved the
runners to second and third,
Buechele followed with a two
run single.
OSU got a run back in the
bottom of the inning, but this
seemed to only spark the
Cardinal hitters even more.
Stanford came back to score
four runs in the fourth, high
lighted by catcher Bob
Hausladen's three-run homer
to left center field.
With the Cardinal ahead 9-3
going into the bottom of the
sixth, the Beavers showed that
they were not about to play

dead, despite the Stanford
lead.
Beaver third baseman Dain
Severson started the rally with a
single to left field. After short
stop Todd Thomas drew a walk,
right fielder Bill Gassaway hit
into what looked like a double
play but turned into a run-scor
ing error. Wilson then hit a
two-run single which not only
closed the gap to 9-5, but also
set an OSU single season rec
ord for RBIs.
In the seventh inning, Stan
ford finally put the game away
with a six-run barrage.
Right fielder Mike Tooth
man — playing with a hurt fin
ger — started the rally with a
double to center field. Short

stop Bob Decosta then moved
Toothman to third with a sacra
fice bunt. After Dotterer was
intentionally walked (a ques- ■
tionable move by OSU con- J
sidering Dotterer's speed), he
immediately stole second —
his third stolen base of the af- 1
ternoon. Davies then drove 1
thym both in with a single to :
left field. A Hausladen walk
spelled the end for Beaver re- )
liever Mark Allen who was re- .
placed by Scott Anderson.
This was an afternoon that .
Anderson would probably like j
to forget. Buechele hit a ;
run-scoring double, followed ;
by a two-run double by desig- ;
nated hitter Eric Hardgrave. *
Center fielder Darryl Stephens •
followed with a single to left,
scoring Hardgrave and giving ;
Stanford a 15-6 lead.

Nobody can accuse the Stan
ford baseball team of stealing
yesterday's playoff game from
Oregon State, although the
temptation is certainly there.
The Cardinal thoroughly
dominated the Beavers, poun
ding out 21 hits and stealing
nine bases en route to a 15-6
playoff victory.
Senior Brian Mignano
started the game and went the
distance for Stanford. Al
though he was not in top form
— giving up 10 hits and six runs
— he seems to progress as the
game went on and hung in un
til the end.
"He is our main guy," Mar
quess said about Mignano,
"and he definitely improved by
the end of the game. He hung
in there."
Beaver pitcher Mike
Gorman was tagged with the
loss.
The victory gives Stanford a
1-0 playoff lead in a best of
three series and Marquess
would like nothing better than
to finish this series as quickly as
possible.
"I would like to get it done as
quickly as I can," he said. "(Jim)
Wilson really scares us."
Entering the series with a .333

batting average and 58 RBIs
(one less than the school rec
ord), OSU's Wilson has been a
terror to opposing pitchers. Al
though Wilson broke his
team's RBI record with a base
hit in the sixth inning, he was
shut out most of the afternoon,
going just one-for-five.
Although the Cardinal won
handily, Marquess was im
pressed with OSU.
"They did a good job," he
said after the game. "They
batted well and came back
from that 9-3 deficit. They are a
good team and if we don't
swing the bat well, we won't
win."
For Stanford, yesterday's
game was like an extended bat
ting practice. Third baseman
Loring Davies went four-for
six, scored three runs and
reaching the bases all six times
he batted. Second baseman
Steve Buechele also played
well going four-for-six.
Although the score does not
reveal it, the game was any
thing hut decided until Stan
ford's six-run seventh inning.
The Beavers immediately
jumped on Mignano in the
bottom of the first inning to
take a 2-0 lead.

Stanford quickly closed the
gap to 2-1 in the top of the sec
ond when OSU catcher Bob
Bishop made a wild throw to
third base while Buechelle was
trying to steal. As the ball rolled
wildly out into left field, Bue
chelle scored easily.
Cardinal left fielder Mike
Dotterer led off the third in
ning with a two strike bunt.
This type of fearless play and
calculated risk taking was to be
Stanford's style the entire after
noon. Dotterer stole second
base and eventually scored on
a base hit by Davies. Hausladen
was then hit by Beaver pitcher
Gorman, putting runners on
first and second. After a
Gorman balk moved the
runners to second and third,
Buechele followed with a two
run single.
OSU got a run back in the
bottom of the inning, but this
seemed to only spark the
Cardinal hitters even more.
Stanford came back to score
four runs in the fourth, high
lighted by catcher Bob
Hausladen's three-run homer
to left center field.
With the Cardinal ahead 9-3
going into the bottom of the
sixth, the Beavers showed that
they were not about to play

dead, despite the Stanford
lead.
Beaver third baseman Dain
Severson started the rally with a
single to left field. After short
stop Todd Thomas drew a walk,
right fielder Bill Gassaway hit
into what looked like a double
play but turned into a run-scor
ing error. Wilson then hit a
two-run single which not only
closed the gap to 9-5, but also
set an OSU single season rec
ord for RBIs.
In the seventh inning, Stan
ford finally put the game away
with a six-run barrage.
Right fielder Mike Tooth
man — playing with a hurt fin
ger — started the rally with a
double to center field. Short

stop Bob Decosta then moved
Toothman to third with a sacra
fice bunt. After Dotterer was
intentionally walked (a ques- ■
tionable move by OSU con- J
sidering Dotterer's speed), he
immediately stole second —
his third stolen base of the af- 1
ternoon. Davies then drove 1
thym both in with a single to :
left field. A Hausladen walk
spelled the end for Beaver re- )
liever Mark Allen who was re- .
placed by Scott Anderson.
This was an afternoon that .
Anderson would probably like j
to forget. Buechele hit a ;
run-scoring double, followed ;
by a two-run double by desig- ;
nated hitter Eric Hardgrave. *
