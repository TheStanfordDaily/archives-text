# Women squeak by Trinity; play UCLA in NCAA finals
## 
### Sid Spaeth 
Salt Lake City — Stanford,
having to play pressure
doubles for only the third time
this season, broke a 3-3 dead
lock with two doubles victories
and advanced into today's final
of the NCAA Women's Tennis
Championships here with a 5-4
win over fourth-seeded Trinity.
Rain and heavy winds forced
play indoors midway through
UCLA's 5-4 semi-final win over
USC and for all of the Stanford-
Trinity match.
Stanford will play UCLA to
day at 2 p.m.
Defending national cham
pions, Alycia Moulton and
Raryn Copeland, invincible at
No. 1 doubles since mid-April,
roared past Louise Allan and
Selicia Raschiatore 6-2, 6-2 to
break the tie and Stanford
needed only one more win to
advance to today's finals.
Elise Burgin and Linda Gates
clinched the win with a 7-5, 6-2
win over Lee Elliot and Karen
Denman.
Burgin and Gates got the
match's first service break,

beating Denman to win the
first set 7-5 and then broke El
liot's serve the second game of
the second set and coasted to a
7-5, 6-2 win.
"We just concentrated on
holding serve," Burgin said. "I
thought our returns were a lit
tle better than theirs and I
knew we could break serve
first."
Jane Arosz and Lisa Sassano
won two close tie-breakers to
pick up a 7-6, 7-6 win over Kate
Gompert and Michelle Weiss
in the third doubles.
Moulton and Copeland led
from start to finish in over
whelming Allen and
Raschiatore. The win avenges
two earlier losses to the Trinity
pair and gives them only their
second loss of the season.
"We were out for blood,"
Copeland said. "We didn't
want to lose a point."
Two of Stanford's singles
wins came early and fast.
Copeland continued to domi
nate the No. 6 singles spot with
a 6-1, 6-0 thrashing of Kim
Wilsnn Gompert rebounded

from a shaky start against Roll
ins College yesterday, to whip
Denman 6-1, 6-2 at No. 3.
But Trinity.was giving the un
beaten Cardinal fits ev
erywhere else. Sassano
avenged an earlierlosstoGates
with a 6-4, 6-2 win at No. 4 and
Elliot came from behind in
both sets to hand Weiss only
her second loss of the year 7-6
(7-3), 7-5 at No. 5.
When Moulton lost her sec
ond straight match of the tour
nament to Allen 6-3, 7-5 at No.
1, the unbeaten and virtually
untried Cardinal was in trou
ble.
Burgin won a close first set
against Raschiatore 6-4 in the
all-important No. 2 singles, but
was upended 6-1 in the second.
With every eye in the Canyon
Racquet Club looking on,
Burgin blitzed Raschiatore 6-2
in the third to tie the match and
set the stage for the doubles
wins.
"I knew we were behind 2-3
when I went into my third set,"
Burgin said. "It does something
to you. I knew I had to win and I

went out thinking every point.
I didn't win them all, but I won
the big ones. I played of
fensively — I forced her and
she made some mistakes.
"It just happened that this
was my turn," Burgin con
tinued. "Against USC when we
were behind, Tex (Moulton)
came through. C.C.
(Copeland) came through to
day, Kate always comes
through and Gater came
through yesterday. Michelle
lost today, but she has come
through so many times. I think
that's the mark of a good team
— we have different people
who can come through. We
don't have to depend on one
person."
Asked about the clinching
doubles match, Burgin repliea,
"We knew we had to win. It
always helps to know Tex and
C.C. are ripping them apart
across the way."
Today, the Cardinal plays the
UCLA team they have beaten
twice this year including a sea
son-ending 8-1 romp May 8.

untried Cardinal was in trou
ble.
Burgin won a close first set
against Raschiatore 6-4 in the
all-important No. 2 singles, but
was upended 6-1 in the second.
With every eye in the Canyon
Racquet Club looking on,
Burgin blitzed Raschiatore 6-2
in the third to tie the match and
set the stage for the doubles
wins.
"I knew we were behind 2-3
when I went into my third set,"
Burgin said. "It does something
to you. I knew I had to win and I

went out thinking every point.
I didn't win them all, but I won
the big ones. I played of
fensively — I forced her and
she made some mistakes.
"It just happened that this
was my turn," Burgin con
tinued. "Against USC when we
were behind, Tex (Moulton)
came through. C.C.
(Copeland) came through to
day, Kate always comes
through and Gater came
through yesterday. Michelle
lost today, but she has come
through so many times. I think
that's the mark of a good team
— we have different people
who can come through. We
don't have to depend on one
person."
Asked about the clinching
doubles match, Burgin repliea,
"We knew we had to win. It
always helps to know Tex and
C.C. are ripping them apart
across the way."
Today, the Cardinal plays the
UCLA team they have beaten
twice this year including a sea
son-ending 8-1 romp May 8.

Salt Lake City — Stanford,
having to play pressure
doubles for only the third time
this season, broke a 3-3 dead
lock with two doubles victories
and advanced into today's final
of the NCAA Women's Tennis
Championships here with a 5-4
win over fourth-seeded Trinity.
Rain and heavy winds forced
play indoors midway through
UCLA's 5-4 semi-final win over
USC and for all of the Stanford-
Trinity match.
Stanford will play UCLA to
day at 2 p.m.
Defending national cham
pions, Alycia Moulton and
Raryn Copeland, invincible at
No. 1 doubles since mid-April,
roared past Louise Allan and
Selicia Raschiatore 6-2, 6-2 to
break the tie and Stanford
needed only one more win to
advance to today's finals.
Elise Burgin and Linda Gates
clinched the win with a 7-5, 6-2
win over Lee Elliot and Karen
Denman.
Burgin and Gates got the
match's first service break,

beating Denman to win the
first set 7-5 and then broke El
liot's serve the second game of
the second set and coasted to a
7-5, 6-2 win.
"We just concentrated on
holding serve," Burgin said. "I
thought our returns were a lit
tle better than theirs and I
knew we could break serve
first."
Jane Arosz and Lisa Sassano
won two close tie-breakers to
pick up a 7-6, 7-6 win over Kate
Gompert and Michelle Weiss
in the third doubles.
Moulton and Copeland led
from start to finish in over
whelming Allen and
Raschiatore. The win avenges
two earlier losses to the Trinity
pair and gives them only their
second loss of the season.
"We were out for blood,"
Copeland said. "We didn't
want to lose a point."
Two of Stanford's singles
wins came early and fast.
Copeland continued to domi
nate the No. 6 singles spot with
a 6-1, 6-0 thrashing of Kim
Wilsnn Gompert rebounded

from a shaky start against Roll
ins College yesterday, to whip
Denman 6-1, 6-2 at No. 3.
But Trinity.was giving the un
beaten Cardinal fits ev
erywhere else. Sassano
avenged an earlierlosstoGates
with a 6-4, 6-2 win at No. 4 and
Elliot came from behind in
both sets to hand Weiss only
her second loss of the year 7-6
