# Overseas in Haifa
## Israel program adjusted to meet student needs 
### Lauren Saunders 
Unbeknownst to most students here, Overseas
Studies has recently opened yet another door for
those who wish to enrich their Stanford education by
experiencing another culture, but who do not want to
go the traditional European route: the Stanford Pro
gram in Haifa, Israel.
The program in Haifa began last July and was ori
ginally designed for an entire year abroad. However,
starting this summer, students will be able to partici
pate even if they can only afford to spend six months
overseas. There are now two sessions, from July to De
cember and from January to June.
They are open to both undergraduate and graduate
students of all majors, and according to Mark Man
call, the director of Overseas Studies, the prere
quisites are a two quarter intensive Hebrew class
here, and that the student be an "adventurous type."
The idea for a program in Israel came up in the mid
'7os. "Haifa was chosen for a variety of reasons," said
Mancall. "Our goals were, first of all, a university
where students could be integrated into the univer
sity — not becoming a foreign enclave ... a place

where they could live with Israelis ... (and where)
broad access to Middle Eastern studies was available
... We felt we could maximize all of these op
portunities by going to Haifa."
The 300-acre campus of the University of Haifa sits
atop Mount Carmel, overlooking the Bay of Haifa and
the city below. It is about a one and a half hour drive
from Jerusalem. The city of Haifa "doesn't have the
'sex appeal' that Jerusalem has," said Mancall, but its
attraction is its "access to Israel society and not tour
ism."
Eight students participated in the program last year,
and most are still in Israel. David Gottfried, a senior
who spent five months in Haifa before returning to
California, left the program early because of prob
lems getting courses he needed for his Industrial En
gineering major.
"I really regret coming back ... I'm jealous" of the
students who are still in Haifa, he said.
Upon arrival in Israel, students enroll in a 10-week
Hebrew language program known as ulpan at the
University of Haifa. Ulpan programs exist all over Is
rael and were originally established in the '50s as a
crash course in Hebrew and Israeli society for new im
migrants to Israel.
Once this intensive language program is over, stu
dents begin taking classes at the university in areas in
cluding the social sciences, humanities and politics.
These are mostly taught in English, although ad
vanced students are welcome to take classes taught in
Hebrew with the Israelis. Although Gottfried was the
only student who did not take classes at the university,
he thought that the other students enjoyed their
classes. Although they were "not high powered ... It
was a good environment... The educational system
is a lot different from here ... We're a lot more
spoon-fed. There students are older... and are much
more serious," he said.
Gottfried took classes at the Israel Institute of Tech
nology (Technion) in Haifa, one of the world's most
important institutions of teaching and research in sci
ence and technology, which is available to qualified
Stanford students. Gottfried's classes were taught ex
clusively in Hebrew, and he found the language bar
rier too great. Mancall said that English classes will be
available for engineering majors who participate next
year.
Students at Haifa come from several countries
throughout the world, and 10 percent of the student

body is Arab — the largest percentage of any univer
sity in Israel. Is there tension as a result? "Sure, of
course, but the world is a tense place ... (At Haifa
you) experience tension in a constructive and
analytical fashion," said Mancall.
The city of Haifa is south of Lebanon, but "the bom
bing didn't affect us ... They focus on the border
areas," Gottfried said. In comparison to Stanford, he
felt "There is much more trust. It's a healthier en
vironment ... In Israel, crime is much less, focused in
the Arab areas... Women are not afraid to go out at
night."
The students are housed in dormitories in suites
with Israeli roommates. "The dorm thing was the best
part of the program for me... It was an ideal environ
ment," Gottfried said. "I made some really close
friends right off ... people inviting me to their
homes." He felt that the Israeli attitude toward Amer
icans and the United States was very positive, al
though they were also extremely critical of many U.S.
policies.
"If I have to stereotype them (the Israelis)," he said..

"they seem more curt and gruff on the surface...
I find them more open and honest ... In the I
there is a layer of veneer put over people's faces..
Israel you know where you stand."
The value system was also very different. "Mos
raelis are not very religious/' Gottfried said. V
was important to them was "living in Israel... par
pating in the army ... strengthening the Israeli i
. .. There is a very nationalistic spirit. People wa
believe in something. People spend most of thei
looking for a cause ... If you believe in Israel i
move there, you've solved that."
In addition to classes at the university, there ar<
opportunities to live and work on a kibbutz bet\
semesters, to travel independently or on orgai
trips throughout Israel and the Middle East and t<
ticipate in a number of community involvemei
tivities in Haifa.
All in all, Haifa "is an excellent program," Got'
said. "It is better than most Stanford campuse
cause it forces you to get to know the country."
