Brezhnev proposes nuclear weapon freeze
Moscow — President Leonid Brezhnev yesterday proposed a freeze
on modernization and deployment of strategic nuclear arms as soon as
talks begin with the United States, but he rejected U.S. calls for im
mediate cuts.
He said President Ronald Reagan's proposal for a one-third reduction
in arsenals was "unrealistic" and designed to "insure American superi
ority."
Brezhnev, however, called Reagan's offer to resume strategic arms
talks a "step in the right direction" and said the Soviet Union was pre
pared to begin negotiations "without delay and without any strings at
tached."
As a basis for the negotiations, he proposed a freeze on the mod
ernization and deployment of strategic weapons "as soon as the talks
begin."
He also said that no additional Soviet medium-range missiles will be
deployed in areas from which they could hit West Germany or other
Western European countries.
In Washington, Reagan said Brezhnev's remarks appeared to show a
willingness to hold talks.
"I think we'll be meeting/' the president said. Asked if he saw hopeful
signs in Brezhnev's speech, he said, "Yes, I think he agreed that we'd
meet; we will."
Secretary of State Alexander Haig, at a NATO meeting in Luxem
bourg, said some Soviet arms control proposals have "compatibility"
with the U.S. approach. But he rejected Brezhnev's proposal for a nu
clear freeze.
"Nuclear freezes do not promote effective arms
control," Haig said. However, he said of Brezhnev's
speech, "to the extent they (the Soviets) are willing to
get into negotiations as early as possible, it is
positive."
Vice President George Bush, interviewed on ABC
TV's "Good Morning America," said Soviet willing
ness to talk was "encouraging." But U.S. arms control
director Eugene Rostow dismissed the call for a nucle
ar weapons freeze as "a grandstand play."
The United States has previously rejected a
Brezhnev call for freezing nuclear arms, claiming it
would permit the Soviet Union to maintain its per
ceived lead in intercontinental ballistics missiles.
Labor Sec. hires investigators
Washington — Secretary of Labor Raymond
Donovan's New Jersey construction company has
hired private detectives to investigate the Senate
committee that has been investigating him.
The step evidently was taken with Donovan's
knowledge and approval. The chairman of the Senate
Labor Committee, Orrin Hatch (R-Utah) said yester
day that Donovan told him about two months ago
'that he was going to hire investigators and check on
the people up here."
"I thought he was just popping off," Hatch said. "I
didn't take him seriously at the time."
The reported aim of the private investigators is to
determine who has been leaking allegations of ties
between Donovan and his firm, Schiavone Construc
tion Co. of Secaucus, N.J., and organized crime.
Actually, many of the allegations have been an
nounced publicly by Hatch's committee rather than
leaked. But Donovan, by all accounts, has grown in
creasingly bitter over the committee's role in pursu
ing and occasionally publicizing aspects of the
Donovan investigation, which is now being con
ducted primarily by special prosecutor Leon Silver
man in New York.
The first clear sign that Donovan was serious seems
to have come last week at the White House, where,
The Washington Post reported Sunday, Donovan an
grily told Hatch: "We'll see who's immoral on Capitol
Hill and who isn't."
A Newark lawyer for Schiavone Construction, in
which Donovan still owns a substantial portion of
stock through a trustee, confirmed that the company
had hired private detectives.
Rev. Moon guilty of tax evasion
New York — A federal jury yesterday found the Rev.
Sun Myung Moon, the spiritual leader of the Unifi
cation Church, guilty of tax evasion for not reporting
the interest on his bank accounts.
In a courtroom crowded with his followers, the 62-
year-old Korean evangelist, sat impassively while the
jury of 10 women and two men delivered its verdict
after four days of deliberations.
Moon, who remained free of $250,000 bond, could
receive up to 14 years in prison when he is sentenced
on July 14.
Takeru Kamiyama, a chief aide to Moon, also was
found guilty of helping to file 'alse tax returns and ob
structing the government's investigation.
Later, through a spokesman, Moon issued the fol
lowing statement: "Don't worry. No problem. The
way of the public life is that we serve God and we
serve humanity. We are people of principle, not per
sonality." The spokesman did not explain the mean
ing of the statement.
The verdict completed a complicated trial during
which hundreds of documents were presented to the
jury. Government prosecutors called 30 witnesses to
the stand in trying to prove that Moon should have
reported the money as personal income on his re
turns.
The government said the documents showed that
Moon, whose church claims a following of 3 million

persons, had personal control of the funds, and that
an attempt was made on his behalf to sidetrack the
government's tax investigation.
Falklands invasion imminent
London — With a British invasion of the Falkland Is
lands appearing imminent, Britain has now mobilized
about 22,000 men in a task force of more than 70 ships
strung out over the Atlantic Ocean at an estimated
cost of more than half a billion dollars.
That means Britain so far is using 12 men and spend
ing at least $275,000 for each of the 1800 islanders in its
undeclared war with Argentina to regain the islands
seized more than six weeks ago.
All the indications yesterday were that Britain was
preparing to assault the islands soon unless a diplo
matic settlement can be reached this week through
the mediation of U.N. Secretary General Javier Perez
de Cuellar.
A British invasion of the islands would change the
nature of the war, testing the morale of the estimated
9000 Argentine troops and at the same time making
British forces more vulnerable to air attacks since they
would be less mobile than they are on the ships.
Little publicity for draft trials
Washington — Reagan administration executives
meeting privately at the Pentagon last month warned
that prosecuting young men who refuse to register
for the draft might fire up anti-nuclear groups and
suggested that any such trials be held in remote areas
of the country, not Washington, D.C., according to a
transcript of the meeting obtained by The Washing
ton Post.
The transcript also shows Edwin Meese, President
Ronald Reagan's counselor, taking considerable in
terest in prodding registrations by denying such fed
eral benefits as college loans and unemployment
payments to men who refused to register.
The rare inside look provided by the transcript,
which was not meant foi» public release, portrays an
administration trying to find a way to wipe out the
embarrassing backlog of 527,000 non-registrants
without at the same time kicking up new political
storms for itself by holding highly visible trials.
"My feeling is that felony prosecutions at this time
may have an awful lot to do with the anti-nuclear
movement," said John Herrington, assistant secretary
of the Navy for manpower.
