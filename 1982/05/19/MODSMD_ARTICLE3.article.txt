Brezhnev proposes nuclear weapon freeze
Moscow â€” President Leonid Brezhnev yesterday proposed a freeze
on modernization and deployment of strategic nuclear arms as soon as
talks begin with the United States, but he rejected U.S. calls for im
mediate cuts.
He said President Ronald Reagan's proposal for a one-third reduction
in arsenals was "unrealistic" and designed to "insure American superi
ority."
Brezhnev, however, called Reagan's offer to resume strategic arms
talks a "step in the right direction" and said the Soviet Union was pre
pared to begin negotiations "without delay and without any strings at
tached."
As a basis for the negotiations, he proposed a freeze on the mod
ernization and deployment of strategic weapons "as soon as the talks
begin."
He also said that no additional Soviet medium-range missiles will be
deployed in areas from which they could hit West Germany or other
Western European countries.
In Washington, Reagan said Brezhnev's remarks appeared to show a
willingness to hold talks.
"I think we'll be meeting/' the president said. Asked if he saw hopeful
signs in Brezhnev's speech, he said, "Yes, I think he agreed that we'd
meet; we will."
Secretary of State Alexander Haig, at a NATO meeting in Luxem
bourg, said some Soviet arms control proposals have "compatibility"
with the U.S. approach. But he rejected Brezhnev's proposal for a nu
clear freeze.
