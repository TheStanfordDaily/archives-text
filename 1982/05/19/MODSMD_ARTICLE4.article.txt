# Handgun initiative garners enough signatures to qualify
## 
### Mike Oneal Second in a series 
As the spring petition drive sup
porting a state handgun control in
itiative winds to a close, it appears
certain that organizers have as
sembled at least the minimum
number of signatures required to
qualify the initiative for the Novem
ber ballot.
According to Press Secretary How
ard Gingold of Californians Against
Street Crime, the organization which
has been circulating petitions, the ef
fort has secured approximately
550,000 signatures. The initiative
needs 346,000 signatures to qualify
and, barring an unprecedented in
validation rate, will be placed on the
ballot.
"There is usually about a 70 per
cent validation rate of the petition
signatures and at this point we are vir
tually assured of a ballot position,"
Ron Dawson, another representative
of Californians Against Street Crime,
said. "We'll keep working for signa
tures through this month though,
just to make absolutely sure."
California's handgun control in
itiative, which is the only statewide
measure of its kind to appear na
tionally this year, was mainly de
signed to put a ceiling on the total
number of handguns legally avail
able in the state, Dawson said. That
number is currently estimated at four
to six million.
The major features of the initiative
are:
• All handguns would have to be reg
istered with the state Attorney Gen
eral by Nov. 2, 1983. Handguns not
registered by that date would be for
ever illegal in California.
• After Nov. 2, no handguns could be
brought into California from out-of
state.
• After April 30, 1983, only those
handguns registered with the state
could be bought and sold and then
only through a licensed dealer or the

police department. (Law enforce
ment groups would be excepted.)
This would effectively put a lid on the
number of legal handguns available
in California.
• A mandatory jail sentence of six
months would be imposed for any
one carying a concealed, un
registered handgun.
• Sale of handguns through the mail
would be prohibited.
Dawson and representatives of
Californians Against Street Crime
were careful to point out that the in-

itiative does not provide for an out
right ban on handguns. Though it
would halt the growth in total
number of handguns statewide, the
initiative also restricts state legislators
from banning ownership or sale of
pistols registered prior to the enac
tion of the law. Such a ban would
have to be approved by voters on an
other ballot.
If the satisfaction of imminent
ballot qualification has cheered Cali
fornians Against Street Crime and
other supporters of the initiative, op
position they face from the huge
anti-gun control lobby looms as a sig
nificant hurdle. A multi-million
dollar campaign being waged by Gun
Owners of California and the Na
ttotial RtfieAsssociation (NRA) is pro
viding stiff and well-organized pres
sure against the initiative.
Considering the grass roots quality

of the anti-gun control movement, a
movement supported not only by
large lobbying groups but also gun
holding citizens, Gringold estimated
the opposition would be "very
tough."
"Guns become a very emotional is
sue with them (gun owners)," Gr
ingold said. "This is not something
you can turn on and off. They can get
very vocal and give a lot of money
and they are very well organized
even though they are a minority in
the state."
NRA spokesman Andrew Kendzie
expressed his movement's optimism
by saying that handgun control
movements are a passing
phenomenon sparked in January by
the successful enaction of a ban in
Morton Grove, 111.
"We are aware of 46 or 47 munici
pal governments that have seriously
considered Morton Grove type legis
lation," Kendzie said. "Forty-five
have been beaten and the reason
they have been beaten is citizen op
position. In Morton Grove, at the
public hearings they had, most of the
people there opposed the or
dinance. The legislators voted against
them.
"We have 2.4 million members
right now nationwide and have got
ten 600,000 new members in the last
six months. Handgun Control Inc.
(one of two national handgun con
trol lobbying groups which are aid
ing the California initiative) has a to
tal of 600,000 members."
Californians Against Street Crime
is confident in its ability to swing vot
ers, however, and Dawson pointed to
a statewide survey of California
adults as the reason why.
That poll, conducted by The Field
Institute in late March and released
April 30, states that Californians
would support the initiative by a
margin greater than 2 to 1 (64 percent
to 30 percent). It was based on tele
phone interviews with a cross section

of 1217 adults, 37 percent
said they possess a gun (;
own a pistol, 32 percent ow
shotgun.)

• A mandatory jail sentence of six
months would be imposed for any
one carying a concealed, un
registered handgun.
• Sale of handguns through the mail
would be prohibited.
Dawson and representatives of
Californians Against Street Crime
were careful to point out that the in-

itiative does not provide for an out
right ban on handguns. Though it
would halt the growth in total
number of handguns statewide, the
initiative also restricts state legislators
from banning ownership or sale of
pistols registered prior to the enac
tion of the law. Such a ban would
have to be approved by voters on an
other ballot.
If the satisfaction of imminent
ballot qualification has cheered Cali
fornians Against Street Crime and
other supporters of the initiative, op
position they face from the huge
anti-gun control lobby looms as a sig
nificant hurdle. A multi-million
dollar campaign being waged by Gun
Owners of California and the Na
ttotial RtfieAsssociation (NRA) is pro
viding stiff and well-organized pres
sure against the initiative.
Considering the grass roots quality

of the anti-gun control movement, a
movement supported not only by
large lobbying groups but also gun
holding citizens, Gringold estimated
the opposition would be "very
tough."
"Guns become a very emotional is
sue with them (gun owners)," Gr
ingold said. "This is not something
you can turn on and off. They can get
very vocal and give a lot of money
and they are very well organized
even though they are a minority in
the state."
NRA spokesman Andrew Kendzie
expressed his movement's optimism
by saying that handgun control
movements are a passing
phenomenon sparked in January by
the successful enaction of a ban in
Morton Grove, 111.
"We are aware of 46 or 47 munici
pal governments that have seriously
considered Morton Grove type legis
lation," Kendzie said. "Forty-five
have been beaten and the reason
they have been beaten is citizen op
position. In Morton Grove, at the
public hearings they had, most of the
people there opposed the or
dinance. The legislators voted against
them.
"We have 2.4 million members
right now nationwide and have got

six months. Handgun Control Inc.
(one of two national handgun con
trol lobbying groups which are aid

Californians Against Street Crime
is confident in its ability to swing vot
ers, however, and Dawson pointed to
a statewide survey of California
adults as the reason why.
That poll, conducted by The Field
Institute in late March and released
April 30, states that Californians
would support the initiative by a
margin greater than 2 to 1 (64 percent
to 30 percent). It was based on tele
phone interviews with a cross section

of 1217 adults, 37 percent

As the spring petition drive sup
porting a state handgun control in
itiative winds to a close, it appears
certain that organizers have as
sembled at least the minimum
number of signatures required to
qualify the initiative for the Novem
ber ballot.
According to Press Secretary How
ard Gingold of Californians Against
Street Crime, the organization which
has been circulating petitions, the ef
fort has secured approximately
550,000 signatures. The initiative
needs 346,000 signatures to qualify
and, barring an unprecedented in
validation rate, will be placed on the
ballot.
"There is usually about a 70 per
cent validation rate of the petition
signatures and at this point we are vir
tually assured of a ballot position,"
Ron Dawson, another representative
of Californians Against Street Crime,
said. "We'll keep working for signa
tures through this month though,
just to make absolutely sure."
California's handgun control in
itiative, which is the only statewide
measure of its kind to appear na
tionally this year, was mainly de
signed to put a ceiling on the total
number of handguns legally avail
able in the state, Dawson said. That
number is currently estimated at four
to six million.
The major features of the initiative
are:
• All handguns would have to be reg
istered with the state Attorney Gen
eral by Nov. 2, 1983. Handguns not
registered by that date would be for
ever illegal in California.
• After Nov. 2, no handguns could be
brought into California from out-of
state.
• After April 30, 1983, only those
handguns registered with the state
could be bought and sold and then
only through a licensed dealer or the

police department. (Law enforce
ment groups would be excepted.)
This would effectively put a lid on the
number of legal handguns available
in California.
• A mandatory jail sentence of six
months would be imposed for any
one carying a concealed, un
registered handgun.
• Sale of handguns through the mail
would be prohibited.
