# Tresidder employees continue protest

Though former Tresidder maintenance worker
Rick Hernandez was laid off nearly nine months
ago, controversy still surrounds his lay-off and un
derlies some of the labor-management tensions at
Tresidder.
His arbitration hearing will be soon. Its outcome
will determine whether he will regain his job.
Though no contract violations have been found
in the preliminary procedures and no procedural
violations have been cited in the process, workers
continue to claim the decision was unfair and man
agement contends the action was necessary and
justified.
Hernandez, a maintenance employee, was laid
off in August 1981 after being promoted from a
custodial position. In addition, a temporary em
ployee from a private personnel firm was not re
hired at the time of Hernandez's lay-off.
"We feel the way the situation was handled was
unfair, and we want this to be known,"said Ah Kau
Lee, lead workman for the crew. "The lay-off was
unjustified and we feel that the decision should be
reversed."
Worker dissatisfaction began growing after Rick
Hernandez, a maintenance worker for the crew,
was let go. Hernandez was filling a special position
conceived by Lee.
"Lee felt there were a number of projects which

could be accomplished if we had a Maintenance-ll
person to help," said Larry Davidson, assistant di
rector of Tresidder Union. Maintenance-ll work
includes fixing doors, light plumbing, replacing
tiles and tasks of a similar nature.
"After careful review, we went ahead with the
idea," said Davidson. The job was created in fall
1980, and former custodian Paul Ortega assumed
the position. In March 1981, the crew requested
that Ortega be allowed to switch with Rick
Hernandez, then a custodial worker for the crew.
After discussions and approval by the Employee
Relations Board at Stanford, the switch was ap
proved.
Problems with the position arose late in the sum
mer, when according to Davidson "we saw that the
projects that were to be accomplished by hiring
Rick were not getting done. The position, we
found, was a sort of crash-maintenance program,
needing journeyman-level (specialist) skills in
many different trades. Rick's classification as Main
tenance-ll simply didn't meet those required skill
levels." Feeling that operational needs could be
better met by contracting from Plant Services and
other outside firms, managers terminated the posi
tion and Hernandez was laid off.
A large portion of the dispute concerns the skill
level required for the job itself. "We found that
one person simply couldn't get all of the work
done," said Ellie Oppenheim, director of Tres

idder Union. "We needed a journeyman with
more specialized skills. What we found was that we
couldn't find that in one person." She added that
the lay-off was no reflection on Hernandez, rather
that the skills needed were beyond what he was
capable of doing.
Hernandez did not agree. "When I was to take
over for Paul," he explained, "I informed
Davidson that I wasn't fully qualified for the job
and that Lee was to teach me a lot of what I was to
do." He said that Davidson agreed with this, and
