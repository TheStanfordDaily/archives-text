## La. bunkhouses provide board, work for destitute 
### Associated Press 
Harvey, La. — Don Murphy's debt to the com
pany grows a little with each cigarette he
smokes, each beer he drinks, each sandwich he
eats. He knows he'll pay it back in sweat but says
things could be worse.
"It's better than sleeping out in the street and
robbing people," said Murphy, 24, of Boston. He
shrugged as he sat in the restaurant-bar that
gives him ample meals of soft-shell crabs and red
beans — and keeps the chits for his bosses to
claim against his pay.
He's among the droves of jobless, sometimes
rootless men, attracted from points north to Lou
isiana by stories of ready work and good pay.
He's among the many who end up in the labor
pool bunkhouses that flourished with the oil
boom. They're referred there by word of mouth,
charity groups and even state employment of
fices.
A legal version of the "company store" sys
tem, bunkhouses are unregulated in Louisiana
where officials place them in the same category
as boarding houses. No license is needed.
The trade-off is simple but loosely defined.
The men usually arrive broke, and are given the
shelter, food, hardhats and steel-toed work
boots they need right away — each at a charge
deducted from the paycheck they get later.
Some companies, including B & H Applicators
and Labor Services Inc. here, will even advance
their workers money for a little beer, cigarettes,
toothpaste and shampoo.
The busiest and most frugal worker can clear
$100 or $200 a week after deductions when work
is plentiful.
But deductions can sometimes wipe out every
penny when work is scarce. Right now it is.
"This is a sad situation," said Don Schnepp,
manager of B & H. Its office consists of two desks
behind a corner partition in Bob and Louis' Res
taurant in this New Orleans suburb.
"We've got guys begging us to give them 60
hours a week. We're lucky if we can get them

30," said Schnepp who calls it a casual labor busi
ness.
Most of the jobs contracted by the
bunkhouses are linked to oil and gas drilling.
Usually it's dirty and backbreaking work — chip
ping stubborn paint from a tanker in the nearby
Mississippi River or loading thick drill pipe onto
a grimy barge.
Schnepp said he noted in mid-April a sudden
and severe cutback in oil-related business. He
pointed only yards away to the Harvey Canal,
where scores of barges sat idle along the
pipeyards and loading docks.
"Everything stopped dead, practically over
night," he said. "We did $3900 worth of labor last
week. We need $10,000 just to break even."
Schnepp says he goes out and solicits work for
the men he takes on as full-time employees.
Now the company is turning would-be workers
away, leaving about half the 50 bunkhouse beds
empty.
"We try to rotate it so that in these hard, hard
times everybody gets a few days a week so they
can make their expenses and have a few bucks in
their pockets," he said.
No one keeps track of how many bunkhouses
there are in Louisiana, or how many people they
employ. State officials say that drilling boom
towns such as Morgan City, Houma, Venice and
Harvey probably each have about a half-dozen.
Some bunkhouses attract the shiftless or vi
olent. Deep into the Oil Patch that spreads west
from here to Texas, bunkhouse killings occur
sporadically.
They are often critized as havens for men run
ning from the law. Jailhouse author Jack Henry
Abbott was captured at a Morgan City
bunkhouse after he stabbed a waiter to death in
New York City.
Some labor pool operators are accused of bilk
ing the workers, charging high fees for rent,
food and workclothes to create a condition of
permanent debt.
