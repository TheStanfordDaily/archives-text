# Lacoste files suit against dead alligators
## 
### Washington Post 
Washington â€” Only a month ago Barry
Gottlieb was living in obscurity in Rich
mond, Va., scrambling to sell his golf shirts
bearing a dead, upside-down alligator on
the left breast to anyone willing to take a
chance on his newspaper ads and mail him
$14.45.
Then, quite unsought, success was thrust
upon Gottlieb, and overnight sales
doubled, dozens of radio, television and
newspaper people were begging for in
terviews and a national movement was
venerating him as something akin to a cult
figure.
His secret?
"I got sued," Gottlieb said last week
from a Richmond telephone booth after
managing to persuade a TV reporter that
he needed a break so he could squeeze in

his 45th media interview of the month. His
courtroom opponent: Lacoste Alligator
S.A., manufacturer of Izod casual wear,
bearer of the familiar (and right-side-up)
alligator.
Gottlieb describes the battle lines as if he
were another "Rocky" and Lacoste a cocky
and disdainful "Apollo Creed." In one
corner is Gottlieb the challenger, a 31-
year-old entrepreneurial eccentric and
erstwhile rock musician, fondly called
"Mad Dog" by friends (he says it has some
thing to do with his foaming at the mouth
when excited), whose couple-of
thousand-dollar investment a year and a
half ago only managed to "keep food on
the table." Until he was sued.
And in the other corner, the heavy
weight preppie cham-peen of the woild,
Lacoste Alligator, a multinational clothing

concern based in Switzerland, with gross
sales in the multimillions of dollars here
' and abroad, which is intent on protecting
its rights to all logos of "lizard-like" ap
pearance.
Lacoste weighed in on April 16, when its
attorneys filed a suit in Richmond's federal
district court against Gottlieb's Mad Dog
Productions Inc., alleging infringement of
Lacoste's alligator-trademark rights.
Mad Dog has been trying to figure out
what hit it ever since.
"We've had more publicity on this than
anything else we've filed" against individ
uals and companies for trademark infr
ingement, said one source close to the
Lacoste effort. "Gottlieb must have one
hell of a PR guy working for him."
