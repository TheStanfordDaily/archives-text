OFF-CAMPUS
HOUSING
If you need off-campus housing for this summer or
nextfall, the Rental Housing Information Office in Old
Union (Room 315) can help you. We have listings of
houses and apartments to rent or share, as well as of
rooms in houses.
A Spring Clearinghouse will be held
from MAY 24 to 28 (from 8-5)
from that office especially geared toward those who
did not draw well, or who are unguaranteed. The
clearinghouse will feature listings, free telephone
service, and useful information about living
off-campus.
Phone 497-3906 for more information,
or to post a listing.
