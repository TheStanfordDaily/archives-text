# Baseball triumphs in Pac-10 playoff
## Women's tennis team wins NCAA championship Nine tops OSU 15-4 
### Adam Berns 
Oregon State entered Sunken
Diamond yesterday hoping to
avenge Tuesday's 15-6 loss, but the
Card nine gave a repeat per
formance, defeating the Beavers 15-4
and winning the best-of-three Pac-10
playoff series.
By beating the Beavers, the Pac-10
Northern Division winner, Stanford
achieved a second place finish in the
Pac-10 which virtually guarantees the
Cardinal a berth in the NCAA Re
gional. Arizona State automatically
enters the tournament as the Pac-10
champion.
In yesterday's game, Stanford
blasted OSU pitchers for 16 hits but
did not gain a secure lead until the
seventh inning when the Cardinal
erupted for seven runs. Cardinal
starter Brian Myers received credit
for the victory while Beaver Bill
Gassaway was tagged with the loss.
Coming back from a 6-2 deficit, the
Beavers closed the gap to 6-4 in the
top of the sixth inning. With runners
on first and second, starting pitcher
Myers was replaced by freshman Jeff
Ballard.
Ballard walked the next batter and
with the bases loaded faced OSU
pinch- hitter Pat Shaw. Reliever John
Radtke was called in to pitch to Shaw
who, on a 3-1 count, grounded out to
second to end the Beaver's biggest
rally of the day. Radtke pitched the
rest of the game without giving up a
hit.
"I didn't think we pitched very

well," Stanford Coach Mark Mar
quess said following yesterday's
game. "Ballard was out of rhythm to
day. Fortunately we really hit the ball
well. I was very concerned when they
had the bases loaded with the score
6-4."
"Radtke is kind of taking over the
short relief spot," Marquess said.
"He had a sore arm earlier in the
year, but he is fine now."
Stanford put the game out of reach
in the eighth inning with an eight
run, seven-hit barrage that was aided
by some good base running. Cardinal
second baseman Steve Buechele led
off the inning with a double down
the third base line. After pinch-hitter
Eric Hardgrave struck out, Aldrete
singled Buechele home with a single
to left.
Darryl Stephens then hit a triple to
right-center field to drive in Aldrete.
When shortstop Bob Decosta hit a
sharp grounder to the second
baseman, Stephens was caught in a
rundown. Buying time for Decosta to
get to second, Stephens eventually
dove beneath the tag of OSU catcher
Bob Bishop.
Beaver coach Jack Riley was
furious with the call, insisting that
Bishop had tagged Stephens. When
asked after the game, Stephens said
that he never felt any tag.
With 30 runs and 37 hits in the last
two games, the Cardinal enters the
playoffs with confidence and high
hopes. Looking ahead to the re

gionals, Marquess said he feels that
his team's experience should be an
advantage.
"Last year we were happy just to
finish second (at the regionals). This
year we want to take it one more step

and carry it to Omaha."
There are 36 teams selected to play
in eight regionals across the country.
The two Western regionals are at
Fresno State and ASU; it is likely that
the Card will play in Fresno. The re
gionals run from May 26-31, with the
eight regional survivors advancing to
the College World Series in Omaha,
Neb., June 4-13.
