## East Germany quells protesters 
### Washington Post 
Dresden, East Germany
After gloating for months over
the rise of nuclear-disarma
ment campaigns in the West,
East Germany is now con
fronted with one of its own,
representing the strongest
grass-roots challenge to a Sovi
et-backed defense policy any
where in Eastern Europe.
Those involved in the cam
paign are attacking, at some
personal risk, what they call the
excessive militarization of life
in East Germany and the one
sided slant of official propa
ganda that blames only the
United States for the arms race.
Limited to small youth
groups, Protestant churches
and some intellectual circles,
the protest drive here has only
a fraction of the scope and
force of Western peace move
ments. But its development in
side the Soviet Union's most
powerful military and econom
ic ally was apparently viewed as
dangerous enough this spring
to warrant a stern police re
sponse.
Claimingthat military service

among East German youth was
being undermined, security of
ficials stripped emblems of the
protest felt patches reading
"swords into plowshares"
off jackets of hundreds of
youths who had joined the
cause. Students are being
threatened with expulsion
from universities for their in
volvement. Others have been
question-ed by police.
A new military-service law,
decreeing for the first time that
women can be drafted in an
emergency, was passed in
March. Meanwhile, com
munist authorities have sought
to co-opt the protest slogans,
claiming a sort of official
monopoly on the peace issue.
The crackdown poses a mor
al and tactical dilemma for the
East German Protestant
church, which had tried to
channel concern about na
tional defense policies along
less confrontational lines.
A real blowup with the gov
ernment would jeopardize the
improvement in church-state
ties that began four years ago.
On the other hand, for the

church to react passively wpuld
suggest a loss of conviction and
risk a loss of credibility, particu
larly among young people
church officials are hoping to
attract as members.
So far the church, which rep
resents about 8 million of the
17 million East Germans, ap
pears intent on speaking up.
"The church wantstospeak po
litically but doesn't want to
make politics," one informed
clergyman in East Berlin said.
In the past two months
church leaders have issued sev
eral sharp statements accusing
state officials of confusing
gestures for disarmament with
actions against the state.
A letter last month signed by
Bishop Werner Krusche of
Magdeburg, leader of the East
German Protestant Church
Conference, said, "We fear
that the actions of the state
bodies are leading to difficult
problems in the relationship of
basically well intentioned
youth to the state, and for the
inner peace of our society and
the personal development of

young people."
On the surface there would
seem to be parallels between
the East German church's arbi
trating efforts and the role
played by the Roman Catholic
Church in Poland. But a senior
clergyman here argued that
the situations are not similar,
since the Catholic Church trad
itionally has had a more domi
nant position in Polish history
and society than has the Protes
tant Church in modern Germa
ny.
The social forces at work also
are different. East Germany's
peace protest hardly can be
termed a movement. It is more
a loose amalgam of groups and
individuals, spurred by a mix of
impulses part youth fashion,
part religious principle and
part political opposition.
Western diplomats in Berlin
said a Polish-style uprising
would be unlikely here, in part"
because East Germany has too
efficient an internal security
system and in part because the
East German Communist Party
is too strong.
