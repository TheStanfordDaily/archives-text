# Britain wages economic war in Malaysia
## 
### Los Angeles Times 
Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia The raid was
perfectly planned and deftly executed,
and before anyone realized it the British
had fallen victim to a swift sneak attack.
The Falkland Islands dispute with Argen
tina is not the only colonial battle occupy
ing the United Kingdom these days. It may
not be a shooting war, but the British have
found themselves in a bitter economic
struggle with Malaysia, still a key member
of the Commonwealth.
It began last September when Malaysian
government interests launched a surprise
raid on the London Stock Exchange, gobbl
ing up the huge Guthrie Plantation Co.
before its dazed British directors knew
what had happened.
The British press cried "foul," the Ex
change changed its rules to bar future such
takeovers and Malaysian leaders, in reac
tion, ordered what amounts to a virtual
ban on government purchases of British
goods and services.
What had been a seemingly warm rela
tionship between Britain and her former
Southeast Asian colony has turned to ice,

with British businessmen being frozen out
of a market for government contracts on
which they held a lock not too long ago.
In just six months, the loss to British busi
nesses has run into the tens of millions of
pounds, Western and Malaysian diplomats
agree. The British have made a few over
tures to cool the tensions, but so far the
Malaysians have shown no sign that they
are ready to call off their undeclared
boycott.
"All things being equal," Malaysian
Prime Minister Mahathir Mohammed said
recenlty, "we will not buy British."
The Guthrie Plantation incident may
have triggered the break, but the rela
tionship had been deteriorting for a long
time.
The first sign of strain came in 1972,
when the British ended the military pres
ence they had maintained here since
Malaysia, then known as Malaya, was
granted independence in 1957.
Some Malaysians believed that they
were being abandoned militarily and oth
ers felt that they were being taken for
granted economically.

As a legacy of the colonial days, British
corporations owned tens of thousands of
acres of land, most of it in huge rubber
plantations. At one point, British invest
ment in Malaysia totaled 2 billion pounds*
(the pound is currently worth about $1.78).
But British investors preferred to stand
pat with their landholdings, while U.S. and
Japanese interests poured millions of
dollars into the country to develop the
burgeoning oil, electronics and other in
dustries.
As a result, the $4OO million in
goods bought by Malaysia in 1980 repre
sented less than 4 percent of a market in
which the British used to command a 30
percent share.
Still, many Malaysians say they have kept
a warm spot in their hearts for Britain, with
whom they have enjoyed a special rela
tionship. Britain, though cold and wet, re
mained a favorite vacation spot for wealthy
Malaysians. In the late 1970s more than
20,000 Malaysian students were enrolled in
British schools, the largest contingent of
foreign students in Britain.
