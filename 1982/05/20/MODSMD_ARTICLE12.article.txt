## Special Olympics Students run meet for the disabled 
### Erin Craig 
The efforts of a group of
Stanford students and months
of planning, fundraising, or
ganizing and anticipating will
culminate in a festive celebra
tion of life at this Saturday's
Special Olympics swim meet at
DeGuerre Pool.
Jim Bouquin, the student
who spearheaded the or
ganizational effort here, said
more than 250 athletes from all
over the Bay area are expected,
making this meet the largest in
Santa Clara County history and
probably one of the largest
anywhere. He said he hopes
the success of this event will
ensure its becoming an annual
event here. "We don't want
this to be a one-shot deal," he
said.
What makes these Olympics
"special" is both the people
who organized the meet and
the swimmers; the swimmers
are children and adults who
have developmental dis
abilities, such as Down's Syn
drome and other cognitive dif
ficulties.
Special Olympics are struc
tured, competitive, athletic
events. They happen through
out the year all over the coun
try and are organized on a state
and county level. In addition to
swimming, there are track and
field, soccer, bowling, floor
hockey, basketball and gym
nastics events. This meet is the
fist Special Olympics event
ever to be held at Stanford.
Bouquin, a senior human
biology major, said he felt a
meet would be beneficial to
Stanford because "Stanford
students never see anything
but Stanford students." He
stressed a need for people to
be in contact with develop
mentally disabled in order to
break down the barriers which
arise from the misconceptions
about people who are different
in any way. And the Olympics,
he said, are the "best contact
possible^between the two
groups of people."

The organization of the
event has taken a monu
mentous effort from the group
of coordinators, according to
Bouquin. The vast majority of
the students had no Special
Olympics experience and no
experience dealing with de
velopmentally disabled peo
ple. Despite their inex
perience, Bouquin thinks the
meet will be "the best" the
county has ever seen. "We're
doing a damn good job!" he
said.
Most Special Olympics
events are run by county or
ganizers people who work
with disabled people on a regu
lar basis. This event is unique in
that it will bring a large number
of people who do not normally
deal with disabled people into
close contact with them.
Bouquin arranged the or
ganizing committee so that
each student was in some way
totally responsible for a specif
ic part of the event, such as de
signing the t-shirts or acquiring
food donations to provide
swimmers with free lunches.
He said that this type of or
ganization was preferred be
cause on the day of the event,
each organizer could see a fin
ished product for which he had
been completely responsible.
Fundraising was also stu
dent-coordinated. Because
there are no entry fees or costs
to the athletes, the event must
be self-supported. According
to Bouquin, more than $l5OO is
needed for Saturday's event.
Money has been solicited from
dorms and community or
ganizations. But Bouquin
stressed that involvement in
the event is more important
than the money, saying "We
would rather someone have a
bake sale for us and earn $5O
than give us $100."
One of the most important
aspects of the organizational
effort was the acquiring of day
of-the-event volunteers. Op
timally, a chaperone a vol
unteer responsible for making

sure the athlete reaches the
race on time and entertaining
them throughout the day
will be assigned to every one or
two athletes. This function
alone requires the presence of
more than 100 volunteers. In
addition, every swimmer will
have a water-certified volun
teer swimming alongside him
in the race. In all, more than
200 volunteers are needed for
the event.
More than 460 people had
signed volunteer lists at one
place or another around cam
pus as of this week, according
to Bouquin, but he said the at
tendance at volunteer orien
tation meetings totaled about
200.
The experience of working
with the swimmers has already
affected volunteers who at
tended athlete training ses
sions the past two Sundays at
Rinconada Park pool. The ses
sions were provided for ath
letes who had either never
been in the water, or who
wanted to improve their
strokes.
" It made me feel really good
to see the athletes coming out
and interacting with the volun
teers. It was inspiring to see the
athletes trying to hurdle a bar
rier and it made me think of
hurdling barriers in my own
life," said Carol Jennings, or
ganizer of the training sessions.
She added that she "made
quite a few friends."
Some of the coordinators are
receiving credit for their efforts
from various University depart
ments.
The event itself should be a
very festive occasion. Opening
ceremonies begin at 9 a.m.,
with the races starting about
9:30 and continuing until 4
p.m. To entertain the athletes
between races, various bands,
mime troupes and jugglers will
perform on the soccer field just
outside the pool area. New
games are also being planned.
The athletes are divided into
ability levels for the races

themselves. The swimmers can
enter events ranging from the
50-yard butterfly to innertube
and kickboard races.
The races are competitive,
but there is a de-emphasis on
losing. The Special Olympics
motto is "Let me win, but if I
cannot win, let me be brave in
the attempt." Every swimmer
will receive a specially de
signed Stanford Special Olym
pics medal, as opposed to a
participant ribbon another
unique feature of this event.
Overall, Bouquin said he was
"very proud" of the or
ganizers. The success of this
event is necessary to ensure the
County's approving future
Stanford Special Olympics.
"We're trying to establish
credibility," he said. "Because
of our inexperience, we've had
to guess a lot." But next year's
organizers will have had some
experience with this year's
event, allowing for streamlin
ing and improving the or
ganizational process.

receiving credit for their efforts
from various University depart
ments.
The event itself should be a
very festive occasion. Opening
ceremonies begin at 9 a.m.,
with the races starting about
9:30 and continuing until 4
p.m. To entertain the athletes
between races, various bands,
mime troupes and jugglers will
perform on the soccer field just
outside the pool area. New
games are also being planned.
The athletes are divided into
ability levels for the races

themselves. The swimmers can
enter events ranging from the
50-yard butterfly to innertube
and kickboard races.
The races are competitive,
but there is a de-emphasis on
losing. The Special Olympics
motto is "Let me win, but if I
cannot win, let me be brave in
the attempt." Every swimmer
will receive a specially de
signed Stanford Special Olym
pics medal, as opposed to a
participant ribbon another
unique feature of this event.
Overall, Bouquin said he was
"very proud" of the or
ganizers. The success of this
event is necessary to ensure the
County's approving future
Stanford Special Olympics.
"We're trying to establish
credibility," he said. "Because
of our inexperience, we've had
to guess a lot." But next year's
organizers will have had some
experience with this year's
event, allowing for streamlin
ing and improving the or
ganizational process.

The efforts of a group of
Stanford students and months
of planning, fundraising, or
ganizing and anticipating will
culminate in a festive celebra
tion of life at this Saturday's
Special Olympics swim meet at
DeGuerre Pool.
Jim Bouquin, the student
who spearheaded the or
ganizational effort here, said
more than 250 athletes from all
over the Bay area are expected,
making this meet the largest in
Santa Clara County history and
probably one of the largest
anywhere. He said he hopes
the success of this event will
ensure its becoming an annual
event here. "We don't want
this to be a one-shot deal," he
said.
What makes these Olympics
"special" is both the people
who organized the meet and
the swimmers; the swimmers
are children and adults who
have developmental dis
abilities, such as Down's Syn
drome and other cognitive dif
ficulties.
Special Olympics are struc
tured, competitive, athletic
events. They happen through
out the year all over the coun
try and are organized on a state
and county level. In addition to
swimming, there are track and
field, soccer, bowling, floor
hockey, basketball and gym
nastics events. This meet is the
fist Special Olympics event
ever to be held at Stanford.
Bouquin, a senior human
biology major, said he felt a
meet would be beneficial to
Stanford because "Stanford
students never see anything
but Stanford students." He
stressed a need for people to
be in contact with develop
mentally disabled in order to
break down the barriers which
arise from the misconceptions
about people who are different
in any way. And the Olympics,
he said, are the "best contact
possible^between the two
groups of people."

The organization of the
event has taken a monu
mentous effort from the group
of coordinators, according to
Bouquin. The vast majority of
the students had no Special
Olympics experience and no
experience dealing with de
velopmentally disabled peo
ple. Despite their inex
perience, Bouquin thinks the
meet will be "the best" the
county has ever seen. "We're
doing a damn good job!" he
said.
Most Special Olympics
events are run by county or
ganizers people who work
with disabled people on a regu
lar basis. This event is unique in
that it will bring a large number
of people who do not normally
deal with disabled people into
close contact with them.
Bouquin arranged the or
ganizing committee so that
each student was in some way
totally responsible for a specif
ic part of the event, such as de
signing the t-shirts or acquiring
food donations to provide
swimmers with free lunches.
He said that this type of or
ganization was preferred be
cause on the day of the event,
each organizer could see a fin
ished product for which he had
been completely responsible.
Fundraising was also stu
dent-coordinated. Because
there are no entry fees or costs
to the athletes, the event must
be self-supported. According
to Bouquin, more than $l5OO is
needed for Saturday's event.
Money has been solicited from
dorms and community or
ganizations. But Bouquin
stressed that involvement in
the event is more important
than the money, saying "We
would rather someone have a
bake sale for us and earn $5O
than give us $100."
One of the most important
aspects of the organizational
effort was the acquiring of day
of-the-event volunteers. Op
timally, a chaperone a vol
unteer responsible for making

sure the athlete reaches the
race on time and entertaining
them throughout the day
will be assigned to every one or
two athletes. This function
alone requires the presence of
more than 100 volunteers. In
addition, every swimmer will
have a water-certified volun
teer swimming alongside him
in the race. In all, more than
200 volunteers are needed for
the event.
More than 460 people had
signed volunteer lists at one
place or another around cam
pus as of this week, according
to Bouquin, but he said the at
tendance at volunteer orien
tation meetings totaled about
200.
The experience of working
with the swimmers has already
affected volunteers who at
tended athlete training ses
sions the past two Sundays at
Rinconada Park pool. The ses
sions were provided for ath
letes who had either never
been in the water, or who
wanted to improve their
strokes.
" It made me feel really good
to see the athletes coming out
and interacting with the volun
teers. It was inspiring to see the
athletes trying to hurdle a bar
rier and it made me think of
hurdling barriers in my own
life," said Carol Jennings, or
ganizer of the training sessions.
She added that she "made
quite a few friends."
Some of the coordinators are
receiving credit for their efforts
from various University depart
ments.
