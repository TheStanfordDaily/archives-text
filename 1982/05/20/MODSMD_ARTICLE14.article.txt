## Only freeze can thaw mistrust 
### 
This letter is a response to Mark
Kramer's article (Daily, May 17)
which attempts to sway us away from
supporting a nuclear freeze. Kramer
starts off his argument by noting the
growing public awareness of the nu
clear nightmare. He goes on to ap
plaud the American people for wak
ing up, but in the same sentence he
shows us that he is one of those still
asleep. He writes: "it is long overdue
that the American people give
greater attention to the possibility of
controlling nuclear weapons/' How
weak a statement and what injustice
it does to the popular movement to
take direct action to freeze, reduce
and ideally eliminate nuclear weap
ons. We are only now working on the
first of these tasks, but should be
quick to realize that vague thoughts
of "possibly controlling" nuclear
weapons just serve to set us back.
How does one control a nuclear
weapon anyway? This type of
rhetoric leads us back to the current
administration's dead-end foreign
policy that reduces all of modern so
ciety to a strategic struggle between
the United States and the Soviet
Union.
The emergence of the nuclear
threat is precisely what has shown us,
in terms we cannot refute, how tradi
tional conceptions of the "national
interest" are the foundation for our
own destruction. Don't we now see
that the threat is in our own backyard
as much as it is in the Soviet Union? A
malfunctioning Pentagon computer
took us closer to a nuclear exchange
than any Soviet plot ever has. It is
plain to see that the problem is not
the Soviet Union, but simply the ex
istence of wordwide nuclear
capabilities. The fact that these weap
ons exist and are "controlled" by
fallible humans and computers
makes all nations more vulnerable to
devastation than ever before. Exactly
so, because nuclear weapons cannot
be controlled (despite the fact that
Kramer thinks about the possibility of
doing such). No, President Ronald
Reagan and President Leonid
Brezhnev can only think they are
controlling nuclear weapons, to the
pleasure of their subordinates who
do not realize that nuclear weapons

have no parallel in their game of Risk
Kramer plays Risk alongside Rea
gan and Weinberger, as he describes
to us in the 7th and Bth paragraphs of
his article all the little star spangled
pieces we would lose over to the reds
if we were to agree to a nuclear
freeze. What he fails to recognize is
that any "strength" we gain in the im
aginary quest for an equilibrium of
nuclear weapons is completely out
weighed by the worldwide weakness
that increases frighteningly as nucle
ar weapons proliferate, or just con
tinue to exist.
I have not yet remarked on
Kramer's central point that a nu
clear freeze would be unverifiable.
He warps the issue in a couple of
ways. First, on the one hand he says
that a nuclear freeze would be un
verifiable, but on the other hand he
asserts that we can attain "effective
and verifiable arms control agree
ments that truly benefit society." Ad
mittedly, a freeze would be more dif
ficult to monitor, but he gives us no
clue as to how arms control agree
ments can be absolutely verifiable.
Do we need to enter a discussion
concerning degrees of verifiability?
Second, he discounts the possibility
of extensive on-site inspection
(blaming the Soviet Union for this). I
agree that we cannot achieve 100
percent confidence, but Kramer
shows no reason why a United Na
tions force, for example, could not
establish a level of verification that
makes a freeze more valuable than
any other current alternative.
Unfortunately, Kramer has missed
the entire logic behind a nuclear
freeze. The need for a nuclear freeze
is based on the realization that equal
ity of redundant destructive
capabilities is a completely unaccep
table method of ensuring peace and
safety. Resting our faith on nuclear
deterrence will eventually bring us
the same fate that is reserved for
those who conceive of a limited nu
clear war.
Harnessing our "national interest"
illusions and working to break down
our mutual distrust with the Soviet
Union is the best way we can prevent

a nuclear war. The symbolic and
practical implications of a nuclear
freeze make it the logical starting
point for this process. Furthermore,
as more nations develop nuclear
weapons, the web of .nuclear de
terrence becomes morfe entangled
and preposterous. Unless we begin
by declaring a nuclear freeze, U.S.-
Soviet calls to other nations for a nu
clear slowdown will fall to deaf ears.
In conclusion I emphasize the fol
lowing:
• nuclear weapons cannot be con
trolled.
• current attempts to balance nuclear
capabilities only decieve us into over
looking our extreme vulnerability.
• our uncertainty in verifying a nucle
ar freeze is minor compared to the
uncertainty in relying on nuclear de
terrence, especially as more nations
develop nuclear weapons.
