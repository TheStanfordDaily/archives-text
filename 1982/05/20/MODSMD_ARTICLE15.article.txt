Western Europe: " Well, Ronald
and Leonid, we can't tell you how we
happy we are that you're speaking to
each other again. It's been so long
and we really do miss playing with
you. Won't you come in and sit
down? I really must say you're look
ing well, Leo; for a while there we
weren't sure if you would be able to
make it."
Leonid: "Thank you. Is good to be
here."
U.S. Public:"Here, Ron, I'll take
your cowboy hat and coat for you.
Have a seat."
Ron:"Thanks, partner."
W. Europe: "Shall we get started?"
Ron: "Now hold on there, we
haven't even had a chance to chew
the fat a little, maybe talk about old
times."
U.S. Public: "We can certainly talk
while we play. Besides, we really are
off to a late start remember how
we never finished last time?"
Leo: "Yes, we start. Don't want to
hold up the game, do you Ron?"
Ron:(grudgingly) "Yes, I suppose
you're right. Why don't you deal,
Leo?"
Leo: "Is not my deal. Your deal."
Ron: "I'm afraid you're wrong on
that. If you remember last time..."
W. Europe: "Last time we had the
same argument. I'll deal."
W. Europe deals the cards
U.S. Public: "Your bid, Ron."
Ron: "Pass."
U.S. Public: "I bid general disarma
ment."
Leo: "Pass."
W. Europe: "I bid nuclear and con
ventional disarmament of the Eu
ropean zone."
Ron: "All right, then, I bid zero.
Leo can take back all of his missiles
from Europe and I won't deploy any
more there."
U.S. Public: "Pass."

Leo: "Pass."
W. Europe: "Double."
Ron: "Pass."
U.S. Public: "Pass."
Leo: "OK, then, here is fair deal.
We count all NATO missiles U.S.,
France, Britain, air-launched, sea
launched Ron takes back these
missiles, I take back my missiles, ev
erybody is happy, yes?"
W. Europe: "Pass."
Ron: "I'm afraid that won't do at
all, Leo. I just can't accept any possi
bility of leaving you with nuclear su
periority in Europe."
The sound of a shoe kicking a shin
under the table is heard. Leo grunts
and glares at Ron.
U.S. Public: "Pass."
Leo: "Am sorry to see Ron has for
gotten finer points of playing the
game. If Ron is serious player, he will
accept my offer of a no-first-strike
treaty. Is fair on all sides."
Again the sound of a kick is heard.
This time Ron sits up with a start and
looks menacingly at Leo.

W. Europe: "Pass. Can I get anyone
anything to drink, maybe calm their
nerves a little?"
Ron and Leo answer simultane
ously.
Ron: "We'll have whiskey."
Leo: "We'll have vodka."
U.S. Public: "Let's all have brandy,
shall we?"
W. Europe gets brandy, and play
resumes.
Ron: "I'm afraid a no-first-strike

treaty is unacceptable to me, given
the imbalance of forces that exists in"
Europe. I'm sure anyone who knows.;
how the game is played is aware of
that, right Leo?"
U.S. Public: "I propose that wejusj;
freeze all the missiles right now and
then sit down and seriously talk
about reducing them. You and Leo
have been holding up the game, a
Ron, and I want to see it played seri
ously like it should be played."
Leo: "Pass."
W. Europe: "Pass.'
Ron: "Now you know that no one'
is more worried about the
of nuclear holocaust than I am, but I
just don't think it's a good time to
freeze since the U.S. is behind in ther,
game right now. I'll tell you what, let
me build all the missiles I want, then,
we'll freeze. Or I have an even better .
idea, why don't we just cut back our
land based missiles by one-third?"'
U.S. Public: "Pass."
Leo: "Is totally unfair proposaj. I
think is time for me and Ron to talk oT
game strategy."
Ron: "High time, I'd say."
Ron and Leo retreat to the kitchen,
where they can be heard shouting
loudly and vehemently arguing. The ~
U.S. Public and W. Europe glance at
each other, somewhat embarrassed.
As time goes on, embarrassmdhU
gives way to boredom and both fall
asleep. Finally, Ron and Leo emerge',
flustered and dishevelled.
Ron: "I'm afraid we really must be
going . .Oh, they're asleep again. It
always seems to happen this way.
Let's just leave a note and get
er to play again this summer."
Leo: "Is not good time for mesl'
Fall."
Ron: "I don't want to wait until
then. Summer."
Leo: "Is not possible. Fall."
They exit, still arguing. The U.S.
Public and W. Europe wake up as the
door slams and thenm look at eatH
other knowingly.
W. Europe: "They did it again. T
wonder if we'll ever get past the bid
ding stage?" (Andy Bennett is a job-'j
