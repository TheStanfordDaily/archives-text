## Peripheral Canal will encourage wastefulness 
### 
There is so much water on the
earth that there is far more than one
needs. Unfortunately, most of it is
unsuitably salty, or difficult to get at.
The oceans and polar ice-caps con
tain 97.2 percent and 2.15 percent of
the world's water supply respective
ly, whereas all the water in freshwater
lakes, rivers and streams totals only
about 0.01 percent.
Even so, there would be enough
fresh water to supply all our needs
if only it would fall in the right places.
Perhaps it is some form of resent
ment at this mismanagement by Prov
idence that prompts the apparent
unwillingness of so many Californi
ans to accept the absolute need for
water conservation.
In 1970 a bulletin issued by the Cal
ifornia Department of Water Re
sources stated that "Fortunately, the
projected slower growth of statewide
population, together with the addi
tional water supplied being made
available by projects under construc
tion or authorized, will provide a

"breathing spell" in the develop
ment of California's water re
sources."
Unfortunately, the breathing spell
appears also to have lulled many Cali
fornians into a sense of false security.
The proposal for the peripheral canal
represents a reversion to outmoded
concepts, a giving-in unreasonable
demands.
Capital investments for supplying
water are seldom made to maximize
profits. The criteria for public invest
ment in a water supply usually speci
fy:
• that the supply be available at all
times after the announced date of in
itial delivery
• that the supply be of high quality
• that the supply be adequate for an
ticipated long-run needs
• that provision be made for peak
seasonal or daily periods
• that the system minimize the cost of
water delivered to a corqmon point
The fulfillment of each of these de

mands serves to perpetuate the
wasteful attitude of the majority of
water users. In the long term, con
tinued profligate water use creates
an apparent need for new supplies
when what is actually needed is a
more economical use of existing sup
plies.
Each of the above demands has an
alternative worth consideration:
• In times of acute shortage, many
cities have experimented with one or
another form of water rationing. It
should be possible to devise a per
manent system of rationing, achiev
ing a saving of 10 percent or so. As the
basic need for water is 2-3 gallons a
day per person, and as the average
inhabitant of Los Angeles uses ap
proximately 160 gallons a day, the sys
tem would involve little hardship.
• Water quality for agricultural
purposes need not be as high as for
human consumption. Moreover, ex
periments at the University of Cali
fornia have shown that a number of
crops celery, sugar beet, swiss

chard, asparagus, spinach, barley and
other grains will grow when ir
rigated by sea-water. The develop
ment of a water-system bearing part
ly treated sea-water for agricultural
purposes might prove a viable
osition for agricultural lands. .b
• It is almost certain that desaliniza
tion will prove a major source of wa
ter in the long term. Eastern couli>
tries are already experimenting with
different methods; Kuwait has irfc".
vested large sume both in desaliniza
tion and in the towing of icebergs
from the Antarticto the Arabian pen
insula. As a result of such activity,
short-term supplies of fresh water
may become attractive as interirir
solutions. b
• Individual awareness and self-con
trol would go far to solving the prob
lem of peak demand. A system of
higher water fates at peak demajid
times, similar to the higher charges
made by the telephone company
during peak dialing periods, might
help to jog peoples memories;
higher water rates, particularly for
heavy users of water, would help tp
reduce overall demand. _
• The idea that farmers and agricul
turists should recieve preferential
treatment needs review. It is not cleafr
that agricultural output should be ex
panded; there is no prospect of £
food shortage in California or the
United States. It would appear rather
that the more pressing problem in
California in the next decade or two
is the oversupply of particular spe
cialty crops.
The acceptance of the current plan
for the peripheral canal will be a vic
tory for thoughtfulness. We cannot
continue to regard water as a "free
good"; the implications of that belief
come too expensive.
