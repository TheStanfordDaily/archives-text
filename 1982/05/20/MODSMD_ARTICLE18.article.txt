Equal Rights Amendment's future is NOW

Contrary to Tom Campbell's asser
tion in the (Daily, May 14, the Equal
Rights Amendment (ERA) is not a
dead issue. As a matter of fact,
Eleanor Smeal, president of the Na
tional Organization for Women
(NOW) is predicting a "down-to-the
wire" fight, especially in certain key,
unratified states.
That is why the local Mid-Peninsu
la chapter of NOW is still working
hard for passage of ERA by June 30.
We continue to send piles of letters
to state legislators and governors in
Illinois, Florida, Oklahoma, North
Carolina and South Carolina, to send
money for media campaigns in those
states, and to urge our members and
friends to attend special rallies at the
state capitols in June.
Moreover, we feel that no matter
what happens or doesn't happen
June 30, our efforts will not have
been in vain. Just keeping the issue
alive in the minds of the public and
our public officials sets the
groundwork for future success, if we
should fail this time.
The fact is that a group of Con
gresspeople have already planned,
should ERA not pass by June 30,1982,
to reintroduce the amendment on
July 1, 1082. So, the ERA is not dead.
And, it will not just go away. Indeed,
it needs our commitment now more
than ever before.

More co-ops needed
I was bothered by the May 12th
cover story on the Draw and specifi
cally, Co-ops. The tone of the article
put the Co-ops in a rather negative
light that I am not sure is deserved.
There are a few problems in the
article that need to be dealt with.
First, the number of open speaces in
the Co-ops is a rather meaningless
number. For instance, I drew 4789
and my first two choices were Co
ops. If the draw is random and there
are 1434 people who are still not as
signed, how many people like me
might we find in the unnassigned
group. Moreover, there need be
only 43 people like me in order to al
leviate the problem altogether. Sec
ondly, Whitney, the Residential
Education spokesperson, stated that
they did not think that they would
have any problem in filling the
spaces. If there will no problem in fill
ing the Co-ops and the number of
empty spaces does not really shed
any light on the popularity of the Co
ops, how is there forecasted "a dim
future for Co-op housing on cam
pus?" All in all, I think that the con
clusions of the article were un
founded and irresponsible.
There was one statement in the

article that bothered me particularly.
"We're beginning to wonder if we're
over co-opted." This statement is
more of a political statement than
anything else and, in that regard, it is
particularly reactionary in nature. No
campus can be "over-opted." It is the
inability of students to actually at
tempt to celebrate diversity or alter
native lifestyles that breeds
statements like this. The Co-ops are
the best opportunity for students to
live on campus and take core of their
own living needs. How long are peo
ple here going to live in places where
they hire others to clean up after
them and cook for them? It would be
a good idea for all students to be re
quired to live in a Co-op for at least
one year. The experience would be
beneficial for many students here
who have always had cleaning ladies,
maids and cooks taking care of them
while they ran around acting frivo
lous and trivial. A generalization, yes,
but this university seems to per
petuate a living mode based on hir
ing minorities and women to pick up
after people. Over co-opted? If any
thing, Stanford is under co-opted
and it is time that all students began
to think of Stanford as some place
that will shape them as responsible
human beings, not simply as a breed
ing ground for the corporate elite of
the future.
