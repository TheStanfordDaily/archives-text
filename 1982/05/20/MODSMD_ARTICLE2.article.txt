# Women defeat UCLA
## 
### Sid Spaeth 
Salt Lake City Stanford capped
an undefeated season and captured
the first-ever NCAA Women's Tennis
Championship with a 6-3 win over
second-ranked UCLA here yester
day.
After splitting the singles 3-3, the
Cardinal swept the doubles to bring
home their first national cham
pionship since 1978.
"It's a dream," a teary-eyed Stan
ford Coach Frank Brennan said. "It
was a storybook day. It's nice to win it
this way. Two great teams go at it and
it comes down to the doubles."
After losing badly to Stanford in
two earlier matches, the Bruins
charged back and gave Stanford a
scare until the last forehand by Kate
Gompert fell in and clinched the
match.
One fan commented, "This is max
imum tension."
Senior co-captain Alycia Moulton
rebounded from two straight losses
to beat Kathrin Keil 6-3, 6-7 (6-8), 6-0
and then teamed with co-captain
Caren Copeland to win the first
doubles match 7-5, 6-3 over Lynn
Lewis and Heather Ludloff.
"It feels damn good," Moulton
and Copeland chorused after the vic
tory.
"That's what I've been dreaming of
since I came here," four-time All-
American Moulton said.
Michelle Weiss and Gompert dealt
the final blow to UCLA winning two

tense tiebreakers by identical 7-5
margins.
Elise Burgin joined Copeland and
Moulton by picking up wins in both
the singles and doubles.
There were three Stanford singles
losses, but Brennan said, "Everyone
got a piece of the pie," when Stan
ford swept the doubles.
Brennan said he had three wishes
during the tournament. He wanted
Trinity to beat San Diego State in the
quarter finals; he wanted UCLA to
beat USC in the semis; and he
wanted Stanford to beat UCLA in the
finals.
He was not disappointed.
Burgin and Linda Gates had to fin
ish their match after the celebration
had begun, but continued on to a
6-3, 3-6, 6-2 win over Helena Manset
and Kathy O'Brien.
After that, it was all bubbly, tears
and celebration.
Five players Moulton, Burgin,
Gompert, Gates and Copeland
were named to the All-America team
yesterday.
