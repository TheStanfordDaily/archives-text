# Attics for addicts: booster shots of culture in museums
## 
### Mike Hale 
One of my earliest memories of London is of being
dragged by my parents through room after dirty room
filled with mummies and Greek vases, when I had specif
ically requested a trip to the Tower to see where all the
heads got chopped off. That one dose of culture cured
me of museums for the next 12 years.
Too many people reach their 20s with the same idea I
had, that museums are just larger versions of attics, worth
poking around in, but too dusty and quiet and creepy to
be much fun. It's especially hard for students, who spend
too much time just looking and listening as it is, to get
excited about museums it's easier to stay awake at the
beach, or 42nd Street.
So, in the belief that ignorance is half the problem if
you don't know what's there, you're not likely to find out
on your own and with the implicit assumption that
museums are worth visiting, here is a highly subjective
account of places to look at art in the Bay area. It won't
encompass even the major venues, let alone every place
where you might see something interesting, because
there just isn't room; but take it as a start, and the more
places you get to, the more you'll find out about.
On campus
lt*S hard to pass a day at Stanford without confronting
public art in some form, but it's quite easy to spend four
years here without ever stumbling across the museum.
Not that the Stanford Museum of Art is small when it
was built, during Jane Stanford's "Great Stone Age," it
was the largest private museum in the world. Most of the
building collapsed in 1906, along with the plaster copies
of Greek and Cypriot sculpture and pottery that were its
early pride, but what remains is substantial enough. Its
obscurity is probably due to location its nearest neigh
bors are the chemistry building and the animal medicine
labs and a curious lack of publicity. While the museum
association's annual auction gets advertised in Time
magazine, the museum's existence would be hard to
prove from e\ .dence in the local media.
The museum's collection is largely didactic, "illustrat
ing the history of Western art from earliest times to the
present," and many sections (particularly the contem
porary gallery) merit one quick stroll at the most.But
some the 19th and 20th-century paintings, the Buck
jade collection, the Stanford family memorabilia de
serve closer attention and the Rodin collection will draw
you back to the museum long after you've forgotten
where the libraries are.
Both the museum and the T.W. Stanford Art Gallery
(on Serra Street, between the Business School and An
nenberg Auditorium) host regular series of temporary
exhibits. These often bring the work of major artists to
campus; the exhibit of Harry Callahan's photography at
the gallery last month will rank as one of the most impor
tant photography shows in the Bay Area this year. Cur
rently up in the gallery (through June 20) are works by
three of the art department's MFA students; the
museum is showing prints and drawings by Gwen John
through June 27.
Other places on campus where art is shown on a regu
lar basis include the International Center, the Cof
feehouse, the Faculty Club and the second floor lobby of
Tresidder Union. Green Library's Special Collections de
partment puts on exhibits of the book arts in the Lurie
Rotunda on the second floorof the old section of the li
brary; they're currently showing items from the
Schofield collection of children's literature.
Some of the most impressive works of art on campus
are those most taken for granted: the outdoor
sculptures. Everyone has an opinion about Albers' Wall
and Kenneth Snelson's Mozart I is still fresh enough in
the freshman mind to be toilet-papered; but not many
people know that Stanford boasts a Calder (at the Law
School), a Bufano (at Tresidder) and a Henry Moore (in

front of the art building).
San Francisco
San Francisco's official "museum of art" sits in pseudo-
Egyptian splendor alongside the Music Concourse in
Golden Gate Park. New York, Cleveland, Chicago, Los
Angeles, Washington, D.C., Detroit, Philadelphia, Bos
ton, Houston and Pasadena all have museums better
than the M.H. de Young Memorial Museum, but like
most San Francisco institutions, the de Young has its own
special charm. Its dark, tiled interior gives it a vaguely
Mediterranean feel (another San Francisco character
istic) and the smallish collection allows you to re
capitulate the history of Western art by early afternoon,
leaving lots of time to see the fish at the Academy of Sci
ences. Most of the masters are represented; fans of El
Greco will be particularly rewarded. The Egyp
tian/Greek/Roman and Africa/Oceania/Americas gal
leries are hidden at opposite ends of the building; in be
tween is the excellent collection of American painting,
one of the best on the West coast. To fulfill its role as of
ficial museum, the de Young also boasts six period
rooms, including an Elizabethan English, a rococo
French and an 1805 Newburyport, Massachusetts parlor.
The de Young also splits the "blockbuster" exhibits
that pass through San Francisco with the Museum of
Modern Art and the Legion of Honor. "The Search for
Alexander" (which closes Sunday) is only the latest in a
series that stretches back through "The Art of Tiffany" to
Tut.
Adjoining the de Young (actually sharing the same en
trance) is the Asian Art Museum. It was built in 1966 to
house Avery Brundage's world-famous collection of
Asian art, which he had donated to the city. Brundage's
10,000 pieces, half of them Chinese, still make up 95 per
cent of the museum's collection. The museum's first
floor contains Chinese art; the second is divided be
tween Japanese, Korean, Indian, Afghani, Iranian, Syr
ian, South-East Asian, Turkish and Pakistani. The austere
carpet-and-glass decor makes the Asian Art Museum's
atmosphere the antithesis of the de Young's rather grub
by Spanish magnificence.
The museum's collection makes it, in theory, the best
place in this country to see Asian art. Unfortunately,
there is only room in the museum to exhibit about one
tenth of the holdings at any time.
In the far north-western corner of the city, on a dra
matic hilltop in Lincoln Park overlooking the Golden
Gate, sits the California Palace of the Legion of Honor.
This museum, the only one in the country that exhibits
strictly French art, gives an impression vastly different
from both the de Young and the Asian Art Museum. The
severe neo-classical building is a smaller copy of the Pal
ace of the Legion of Honor in Paris, and is entered via a
grassy court running between blank arcades, whose cen
terpiece is a large casting of Rodin's The Thinker. The
collection runs the gamut from Medieval tapestries to a
room of Impressionist and post-Impressionist paintings,
with furniture, porcelain, Fragonard and Poussin in be
tween. Coming to the Legion this summer will be a spe
cial exhibit of 34 works by Cezanne from the Pearlman
collection.
The basement of the Legion of Honor holds the
Achenbach Foundation for Graphic Arts, the print and
drawing collections of the Fine Arts Museums of San
Francisco. While there is no permanent exhibit space for
these collections, the foundation mounts constant tem
porary exhibits; currently showing is a selection of turn
of-the-century American posters.
The last of the major San Francisco museums isn't in a
park, but it does have a connection to greener visions of
the city. After the 1906 earthquake, a city plan was drawn
up which aimed at making San Francisco a second
Athens; it did not meet the favor of businessmen and the
only fragment of it that was built was what we now call

the Civic Center. The Museum of Modern Art occupies
the third and fourth floors of the Veteran's Building, at
Van Ness and MacAllister, sharing the building with
Herbst Hall and the block with the opera house.
SFMOMA has several major drawbacks. First, it isn't a
very pleasant place to look at art when it isn't freezing,
it's stifling and the endless third-floor corridors could
give an anteater vertigo. Second, the museum's per
manent collection can be hard to track down. At the mo
ment, there are two paintings both by Clyfford Still
from the permanent collection on view, as well as one
short hall of European photography. This means that
works by every great modern European and American
painter things like Matisse's The Girl with Green Eyes,
Picasso's Street Scene, Paris, paintings by DeKooning,
Pollack and Rothko, 12 Stills are in storage or on loan.
And even when the permanent collection is up, only a
fraction of the photography holdings can be hung.
This situation arises because the museum's curators
desperately pack the halls with contemporary shows and
big-name traveling exhibits (like the immense Hopper
show of this past winter). Currently sharing quarters in
SFMOMAare: a retrospective of 40-year-old Los Angeles
artist Ed Ruscha, who, among other things, paints
phrases like "I don't want no retro-spective" on canvas
in media such as blood and maple syrup; "Ceramic
Six Artists," which includes Robert Arneson's
infamous bust of George Moscone; "Kandinsky in
Munich," paintings and drawings seen and done by the
young Kandinsky; a huge retrospective of Cartier-
Bresson's photographs; and a recreation of a 1936 Ansel
Adams exhibit held at Stieglitz's An American Place gal
lery. All this in a space hardly large enough to be called a
museum. Still, there is a certain exhilaration to all this;
the situation is more frustrating than anything else.

East Bay
Two museums on the far side of the Bay Bridge should
be mentioned. Both are notable partly for their own
architecture. The Oakland Museum (1000 Oak Street
near the Lake Merritt BART station) is the centerpiece of
an urban park designed by Roche, Dinkeloo & As
sociates in 1969. In the museum complex itself, the main
galleries are located beneath terraced roof gardens. The
museum isn't strictly an art museum, but collects items
concerning the art, history and environment of Califor
nia; its art holdings include works by more than 1000 Cal
ifornia artists. It also hosts major traveling exhibits of
American art; currently on display is "Contemporary
American Realism Since 1960."
Coming full circle, the last museum I can cram in is an
other campus affair the University Art Museum at UC-
Berkeley. Its spirit couldn't be more different than that of
the noble pile we have here. Berkeley's collection is
housed in a fan-shaped, exposed reinforced-concrete
building that looks from the air like a poker hand. Inside,
the galleries are laid out along a continuous ascending
ramp you start at the bottom and at the end take an
elevator back down to the ground floor. The centerpiece
of the collection is a group of Hans Hofmann paintings,
which occupy their own gallery; Hofmann, who taught
at Berkeley after the war, began the museum's building
fund with a donation of $250,000 and 45 paintings.
And yet...
Long as this has rambled on, it gives only the barest be
ginning of a guide to Bay Area exhibit spaces. I've left out
everything south and north of San Francisco and Oak
land, as well as the many private galleries in the city that
regularly mount exhibits as interesting as any shown in
the museums. Once you start looking for art, you'll never
run out of places to look at it and hardly any of them
have mummies.

ART DWELLING Next to the history corner, just beyond the trees across from the Business school,
and to the right of Hoover tower stands the Stanford Art Gallery. The Gallery features, on a rotating
basis, such exhibits as contemporary photographs and sketches from centuries past.
