## Take a tour to meet Bay Area endangered species 
### Stuart Weiss 
At the mention of "endangered species"
most people immediately picture scenes like
giant pandas merrily munching on bamboo
shoots, or spectacular birds like the bald
eagle or vanishing California condor soaring
effortlessly over remote wilderness areas. Or
they may think of a three- inch fish or an ob
scure snapdragon stopping $lOO million
dams in a David and Goliath battle.
But where do the more than 600 officially
listed endangered species of mammals,
birds, reptiles, amphibians, fish, insects,
molluscs, plants, plus the numerous other

unlisted species equally in peril, actually re
side? A surprising number are in our own
backyard.
One species of the Bay Area is no longer
with us. The Xerces blue butterfly went ex
tinct in 1943 after a long decline as the City of
San Francisco spread across the butterfly's
sand dune habitat. It is commemorated by
the name of the Xerces Society, an organiza
tion dedicated to the preservation of our
more obscure fellow travelers on the Earth.
The case of the Xerces Blue points out the
major cause of species being endangered;
loss of habitat as humans convert wild areas
into subdivisions, freeways, golf courses and
so forth. The end result is that we have
crowded out many of the longtime residents
of the Bay Area. Time for a quick tour.
San Bruno Mountain
Driving north past the airport, it is hard to
miss San Bruno Mountain, that apparently
barren massif proudly emblazoned with the
immortal words, "South San Francisco: The
I ndustrial City." For those who take the trou
ble to hike its steep slopes, San Bruno Moun
tain offers a glimpse of the formerly wild
state of the northern peninsula. As the last

substantial piece of undeveloped land in the
area, San Bruno is the last refuge for five en
dangered butterflies (mission blue, San Fran
cisco silverspot, San Bruno elfin, bay check
erspot and San Francisco tree lupine moth),
the San Francisco garter snake and 12 types
of rare and endangered plants.
Hawks, owls and turkey vultures soar over
its windy flanks and the mountain provides
one of the better views of the whole Bay
Area on clear days, along with a fine display
of spring wildflowers. Altogether, it is well
worth spending an afternoon checking out
San Bruno Mountain.
Many people have eyed San Bruno for de
velopment. One plan called for scraping off
the top 500 feet of the mountain and creating
an island in the Bay. Nothing ever came of
this plan, except a lot of outrage.
Current plans call for the placement of
â– several thousand housing units on various
parts of San Bruno, guided by a land mark $1
million study of the species of concern in an
effort to limit the overall impact of develop
ment on the ecological integrity of the
mountain. About 10 percent of the habitat
will disappear, with the rest of the mountain
to be protected "in perpetuity," as a county
park.
Serpentine grasslands and butterfliess
Biology Professor Paul Ehrlich has been
studying the bay checkerspot butterfly since
1960, making it perhaps the best known in
vertebrate species in the world. He has also
watched its numbers decline precipitously as
the checkerspofs special habitat disap
peared under Interstate 280, housing de
velopments and golf courses.

The mid-'7os drought killed off several co
lonies near San Jose that were under grazing
pressure from cattle, leaving only three
viable sites, at Jasper Ridge, Edgewood
County Park and San Bruno Mountain. The
Bay Checkerspot was proposed for federal
protection in 1981; so far no action has been
taken.
This butterfly is largely restricted to out
crops of serpentine rock which forms a
very poor soil that supports a diverse native
grassland flora and fauna. The vast majority
of grasslands in California today, like those
around the Dish, are dominated by a few
weedy species of annual grasses from the
Mediterranean region that stand up well to
intensive grazing. The serpentine areas have
provided a refuge for an entire ecological
community and give an incomprable spring
wildflower display.
Salt marshes
The Bay has taken a large amount of abuse
from humans, losing over one-third of its to
tal area of "reclamation." The hardest hit
habitat type has been salt marsh, those seem
ingly monontous stands of cordgrass which
are among the most productive ecosystems
on Earth. With more than three-fourths of
the original marsh gone, it is not surprising to
find three salt marsh species on the en
dangered species List.
The most elusive of the three is the salt
marsh harvest mouse, found nowhere else in
the world except the salt marshes around
San Francisco Bay. This little rodent is among
the few mammals that can drink salt water.
Two bird species, the clapper rail and least
tern, depend upon undisturbed marsh habi

tat for nesting sites and food. Numerous oth
er species of migratory birds use these areas
as stopovers on the Pacific flyway. Most of
the remaining saltmarsh in the South Bay is
administered as part of the San Francisco Bay
National Wildlife Refuge.
Antioch Dunes
Near the town of Antioch on the south
shore of the San Joaquin River lies one of the
most biologically unique areas in the United
States, the Antioch Dunes. Fifty-five acres
out of an original 500 are now protected
through their purchase by the U.S. Fish and
Wildlife Service under the Endangered Spec
ies Act. The species in question are the
Langes metalmark butterfly and three en
dangered plants.
Two of the plants, the Antioch Dunes eve
ning primrose and Contra Costa wallflower,
were commemorated on a set of U.S. post
age stamps. Numerous other unique though
unlisted insect species are known from the
area, which was slated for industrial de
velopment, a waterfront park and marina
prior to its purchase.
These are a few local examples of what
biologists and other concerned individuals
consider an alarming worldwide trend of ex
tinctions. The battles to stop this trend are
fought over little pieces of land that are es
sential to the survival of often obscure spec
ies that few people know or explicitly care
about.
The 1973 Endangered Species Act, current
ly up for reauthorization, is the most impor
tant tool available to conservationists in
fighting such battles. Species are proposed
for listing and the critical habitat require
ments recommended on the best scientific
information available.

Since the Reagan Administration came
into office, only one new species has been
officially listed and funding for habitat
aquisition and recovery plans have been cut
drastically.

While provisions for protection of err*
dangered species can lead to delays and
even curtailment of multi-million dollar
projects, biologists advise it is best to pro
ceed slowly and cautiously when con
templating the extinction of another form of
life. As ecologist Aldo Leopold said, "The
first rule of intelligent tinkering is to save all
the parts." And they suggest we ask
ourselves whether a world unfit for other
species is really fit for human beings.
