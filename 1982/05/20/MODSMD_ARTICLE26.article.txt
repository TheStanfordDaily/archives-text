## 'Ghosts' makes spirited world premiere at Magic Theatre Poetic, humorous images 
### Jiri Weiss 
"There is a ghost in each of
us," writes playwright John
O'Keefe in the program for his
new play, Ghosts. He is half jok
ing.
The play, produced by the
Magic Theatre in San Francisco
and directed by O'Keefe
himself, is a witty excursion
into the world of the beyond.
O'Keefe is a masterful director
who has also orchestrated and
choreographed the collection
of dramatic vignettes, poetic
monologues that make up the
performance.
Ghosts is no usual kind of
play there is no plot, only
images. Some scary, others
poetic or humorous. There are
the traditional images, the
cliches, of ghosts we re
member from childhood: the
limping ghost in a white sheet
dragging himself across the
stage like Bela Lugosi, and the
ghost playing a violin.
But the play also includes
wonderfully poetic passages. A
man, played by Paul Connell,
talks about the infinite possi
bilities of the life beyond. Just
scratching the invisible wall
that separates him from our
world gives birth to a thousand
worlds in order or chaos ac
cording to his choosing. In
some dinosaurs eat skyscrapers
and clouds stick out of the
ground.
We meet a housewife from
Marin who imagines herself to
have lived a much more flam
boyant lifestyle. Another wom
an was abandoned by her hus
band as she lay dying her
body rotting away. There is a
lonely old woman who talks as
she sits by her windowsill wait
ing for death turning the lamp
beside her on and off. A janitor
mops the floor lit by a circle of
neon light while in another
place, he urges us to talk to
him. The biggest problem for
O'Keefe's ghosts, it seems, is
loneliness.
The play's effectiveness is in
its quick pacing combined with
the richness and cleverness of
the images. The atmosphere is
provided not by an elaborate
set there is only a dark cor
ridor into the depths of the
stage or music but by human
voices and innovative lighting
techniques designed by
Margaret Dunn.
The human voices weave to
gether into musical coun
terpoint and abstract sounds.
Lighting brings out selected
features on the faces of actors.
In one segment when a woman
talks about her illness the shad
ows on her face seem to grow
making her look more and
more sickly.
What O'Keefe needs to

make him a truly great play
wright is discipline. In spite of
all of the wonderful inventive
ness it contains, Ghosts lacks an
overall structure and purpose.

All of the images are piled up,
one on top of another. Just
when the audience thinks it has
understood one image another
is presented. This can lead to
fatigue or boredom. Luckily
the shortness of Ghosts saves it.

The whole cast has put on an
excellent and professional per
formance. Especially outstand
ing is Jenny Shapiro, who plays
a young, innocent and all-

American ghost.
Ghosts can be seen at 8:30
p.m. Wednesdays through
Sundays, until June 6 at the
Magic Theatre, Building D, at
Fort Mason in San Francisco.
