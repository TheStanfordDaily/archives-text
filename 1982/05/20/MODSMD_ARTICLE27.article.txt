# New play shows racial, familial conflict
## 
### Karl Knapper Kevin Reidy 
Elm Grove, Louisiana, May 7969. One
a half weeks before the senior class
of the all-black high school graduates
and moves into the seemingly charmed,
adult world of larger horizons and
greater freedoms.
This is the setting of A Star Ain't
Nothin' But a Hole In Heaven , the Com
mittee on Black Performing Arts and
the Drama Department's premiere pro
duction of a play by Judi Mason-Wil
liams.
The plot centers around Pokena Faye
Cotten ("Pokie") as she struggles with
individual identity and independ
ence frpm her family. Issues such as
Rekie.'s responsibility to her aging rela
tives who have raised her, the North as a
land of opportunity or place of rioting
and jail for young Blacks, and the ability
of young people to succeed in the face
of familial and community difference
are dramatized in this new play.
Mason-Williams' work evokes emo
tion. As director Sandra Richards says in
her program notes, one is first struck
"with a feeling of sadness disap
pointment that Joretta and Pokie's en
thusiastic embrace of the notion of
equality of opportunity seems terribly
naive today, that having learned little
from the Sonny's who marched off to
war in 1969, the nation continues to
consign many of its youth to the refuse
heap."
Mason-Williams treats the problems
of her characters in a warm, humorous
tone, sensitive to the people and issues
involved. Her compassion is such that
though we may not have lived in the
we all have known and been in
volved with similar characters.
f| directing this play, Richards suc
cessfully dramatizes the socio-political
issues of the play as well as presenting
an Entertaining evening of theater.

The set by William Eddelman and the
costuming by Fumiko Bielefeldt both
manage to create and sustain the il
lusion of being in the rural South in the
late '6os.
For the most part the acting through
out the play is strong and the person
alities and the relationships developed
between the characters are quite re
alistic.
Heading the cast, in the lead role of
Pokie, is Judy Moreland. Moreland,
one of Stanford's finer actresses, turns
in a sterling performance. Her portrayal
of the complex character of Pokie Cot
ten is professionally handled with care
and depth. She creates a character who
can move the audience to teats at times
and laughter at others.
The only criticism that one may find
with her performance is that she some
times comes off as a little more
educated than her rural South charac
ter would be in actuality.
Equally dazzling in her performance
is Jeanette Pitts as Joretta Washington,
Pokie's best friend. Pitts brings to life all
the conflicting facets of Joretta's char
acter fastiness, compassion, insecuri
ty, and ultimately despair and hope.
The scenes between Moreland and
Pitts are by far the show's most engag
ing moments due to their talent and
stage presence combined with Rich
ard's superb direction. However, the
other characters seem to be less well
developed by playwright and actor
alike.
Viera Whye and Timothy Roddie as
Pokie's aging aunt and uncle both have
their touching moments in the play. Al
though, many of the scenes involving
the elderly people have a tendency to
drag. This in part is due to Mason-Wil
liams leaving the majority of the exposi
tion to the dying Aunt Mamie (Whye).
The necessary slow pacing of her role
make for a sometime tedious exposi

tion.
Lamott Atkins, as Pokie's boyfriend
Sonny, seems to have problems defin
ing his character. This is mainly due to
the underwritten nature of the role.
Mason-Williams has required Sonny to
show too many changes in personality
without supplying the requisite depth
to make these quirks and shifts of char
acter believable.
Kudos shuld go to 13-year-old Ziddi
Msangi as Joretta's younger brother
Bernard and Yolanda Snowball as
neighbor Pearl Delahoussay. Both man
age to bring the necessary comic relief
from the play's heavier moments,
though this is definitely not the only
reason for having their characters in the
play.
A Star Ain't Nothin' But A Hole In
Heaven is being produced in part by a
Shubert Foundation grant which is de
signed to help develop playwriting tal
ent for the American theater. In this
light, one must be patient with and sym
pathetic to the play's shortcomings:
lack of subtlety at times (i.e., the ex
cessive allusions to stars throughout the
show), the slow exposition, and the at
tempt to handle too many important is
sues in just one evening of theater.
As Mason-Williams said after viewing
the play in production for the first time
last Friday night, "I've been writing the
play for 10 years, but in essence, it's only
two and a half hours old." Hopefully
many of the play's problems will be re
solved after rewriting.
It is an honor for the Stanford Univer
sity Drama Department and the Com
mittee on Black Performing Arts to have
this Shubert Foundation grant.

A Star Ain't Nothin' But A Hole In
Heaven plays Wednesday through Sat
urday, May 19-22, in the Little Theater
of Memorial Auditorium. Curtain call is
at 8 p.m.
Elm Grove, Louisiana, May 7969. One
a half weeks before the senior class
of the all-black high school graduates
and moves into the seemingly charmed,
adult world of larger horizons and
greater freedoms.
This is the setting of A Star Ain't
Nothin' But a Hole In Heaven , the Com
mittee on Black Performing Arts and
the Drama Department's premiere pro
duction of a play by Judi Mason-Wil
liams.
The plot centers around Pokena Faye
Cotten ("Pokie") as she struggles with
individual identity and independ
ence frpm her family. Issues such as
Rekie.'s responsibility to her aging rela
tives who have raised her, the North as a
land of opportunity or place of rioting
and jail for young Blacks, and the ability
of young people to succeed in the face
of familial and community difference
are dramatized in this new play.
Mason-Williams' work evokes emo
tion. As director Sandra Richards says in
her program notes, one is first struck
"with a feeling of sadness disap
pointment that Joretta and Pokie's en
thusiastic embrace of the notion of
equality of opportunity seems terribly
naive today, that having learned little
from the Sonny's who marched off to
war in 1969, the nation continues to
consign many of its youth to the refuse
heap."
Mason-Williams treats the problems
of her characters in a warm, humorous
tone, sensitive to the people and issues
involved. Her compassion is such that
though we may not have lived in the
we all have known and been in
volved with similar characters.
f| directing this play, Richards suc
cessfully dramatizes the socio-political
issues of the play as well as presenting
an Entertaining evening of theater.

The set by William Eddelman and the
costuming by Fumiko Bielefeldt both
manage to create and sustain the il
lusion of being in the rural South in the
late '6os.
For the most part the acting through
out the play is strong and the person
alities and the relationships developed
between the characters are quite re
alistic.
Heading the cast, in the lead role of
Pokie, is Judy Moreland. Moreland,
one of Stanford's finer actresses, turns
in a sterling performance. Her portrayal
of the complex character of Pokie Cot
ten is professionally handled with care
and depth. She creates a character who
can move the audience to teats at times
and laughter at others.
The only criticism that one may find
with her performance is that she some
times comes off as a little more
educated than her rural South charac
ter would be in actuality.
Equally dazzling in her performance
is Jeanette Pitts as Joretta Washington,
Pokie's best friend. Pitts brings to life all
the conflicting facets of Joretta's char
acter fastiness, compassion, insecuri
ty, and ultimately despair and hope.
The scenes between Moreland and
Pitts are by far the show's most engag
ing moments due to their talent and
stage presence combined with Rich
ard's superb direction. However, the
other characters seem to be less well
developed by playwright and actor
alike.
Viera Whye and Timothy Roddie as
Pokie's aging aunt and uncle both have
their touching moments in the play. Al
though, many of the scenes involving
the elderly people have a tendency to
drag. This in part is due to Mason-Wil
liams leaving the majority of the exposi
tion to the dying Aunt Mamie (Whye).
The necessary slow pacing of her role
make for a sometime tedious exposi

tion.
Lamott Atkins, as Pokie's boyfriend
Sonny, seems to have problems defin
ing his character. This is mainly due to
the underwritten nature of the role.
Mason-Williams has required Sonny to
show too many changes in personality
without supplying the requisite depth
to make these quirks and shifts of char
acter believable.
Kudos shuld go to 13-year-old Ziddi
Msangi as Joretta's younger brother
Bernard and Yolanda Snowball as
neighbor Pearl Delahoussay. Both man
age to bring the necessary comic relief
from the play's heavier moments,
though this is definitely not the only
reason for having their characters in the
play.
A Star Ain't Nothin' But A Hole In
Heaven is being produced in part by a
Shubert Foundation grant which is de
signed to help develop playwriting tal
ent for the American theater. In this
light, one must be patient with and sym
pathetic to the play's shortcomings:
lack of subtlety at times (i.e., the ex
cessive allusions to stars throughout the
show), the slow exposition, and the at
tempt to handle too many important is
sues in just one evening of theater.
As Mason-Williams said after viewing
the play in production for the first time
last Friday night, "I've been writing the
play for 10 years, but in essence, it's only
two and a half hours old." Hopefully
many of the play's problems will be re
solved after rewriting.
