# Local handgun bans sought

Morton Grove, 111. is a small, Mid
western community near Chicago
which until recently was as ordinary
as most suburbs which surround
most cities.

In January, however, Morton
Grove became the center of a na
tional movement. By enacting the
first handgun ban to be ruled con
stitutional by a state supreme court,
Morton Grove's Board of Governors
gave new direction to the flounder
ing national handgun control cam
paign.
It was not so much the impact of
the law itself which gained national
attention that impact has yet to be
seen. Rather, the profound aspect of
Morton Grove's initiative has been its
message.
Throughout the country, com
munities like this one have recog
nized that despite the progress of the
national handgun control move
ment, it is still possible to outlaw
pistols locally.
Chicago jumped on the
bandwagon immediately with a city
wide handgun freeze; and in the Bay
Area, it appears certain that San Fran
cisco and Sunnyvale will place hand
gun control ordinances on the No
vember ballot. One organization
called Californians Against Street
Crime has almost assuredly secured
enough petition signatures to qualify
their handgun control initiative for
the ballot.
According to Don Hess, a long
time member of the now moribund
Northern California Coalition to Ban
Handguns, Morton Grove was just

what the movement needed to get
back on its feet. Hess explained that
although two national lobbying
groups have been active in Washing
ton D.C. for eight years, they have
had little impact toward new legisla
tion. It was not until two years ago
that Handgun Control Inc. and the
National Coalition to Ban Handguns
decided they would work toward lo
cal solutions instead of seeking top
level success through lobbying.
Then came Morton Grove. The rip
ple effect from this one movement
has revealed that although the na
tion's citizens are showing less than

eager support for handgun control,
city legislators throughout the coun
try are expressing more interest. City
officials at Morton Grove reported
that in a two month period following
enaction of the ordinance, they re
ceived more than 500 requests for
copies of the ordinance from city leg
islators who wanted to study the is
sue.
Sunnyvale's Lou Cava was one such
legislator.
Cava, a member of the city's Chart
er Review Committee, brought the
issue up for committee discussion
several months ago. Since since then,
his suggestion has not only been

drafted into an ordinance, but has
survived a public hearing attended
mostly by anti-gun control ad
vocates. At that heating, the commit
tee voted 10-4 to recommend the
measure to Sunnyvale's City Council.
According to council member
Dolowries Wulfhorst, it is probable
that the council will put the or
dinance on the November ballot.
"I came to the decision to raise the
issue of handgun control in Sun
nyvale on the fact the Morton Grove
was able to do it," Cava said. "At the
current rate of growth, over 50 mil
lion handguns will be available in
America by the year 2000. When
they're available and loaded, they're
goingto be used. I'mforstoppingthe
killing. The bottom line is this: What
good ever came out of the end of a
handgun?"
The situation in Sunnyvale, how
ever, points to an issue many hand
gun control observers see as a signifi
cant problem of a single city move
ment.
"It would be very difficult to en
force such a law when neighboring
communities have no ordinance and
guns could be brought in,"
Wulfhorst said. "I think it should be
brought up on the ballot so the com
munity can see if it wants to make
(enforcement) a priority for the po
lice force. They (the police) have a lot
of other things to worry about."
For these reasons, most observers
agree that local movements can have
little to no effect on crime in a com
munity. Some, like Bill Thomas,
Cava's opponent on the Charter Re
view Committee, said he thinks a ban
is simply not worth it because it treats
a symptom of handgun use in crime,
but not crime itself. Ron Dawson, a

News analysis

representative for Californians
Against Street Crime, said, "Local at
tempts at gun control would be vir
tually unenforceable."
But the National Coalition to Ban
Handguns sticks by its position that
localization is central to the move
ment and the movement is central to
curbing crime. According to Don
Laackman, a spokesman for the or
ganization, local handgun control
movements must provide the base
for the whole movement because, as
symbols, they are very effective in re
vealing citizen interest.
"The only way to pass effective
handgun legislation is on the local
level," Laackman said. "We need to
show state legislatures what people
want. Local initiatives show them
people want handgun control and
they will take that to the states and
vote for it on that level. My only an
swer (to opposition) is 'Look at
Morton Grove. Look at what has hap
pened since then.'"
A number of the supporters of lo
cal movements in the Bay Area say
that any initiative is a good initiative.
Jim Buick, a member of the San Fran
cisco Mayor's Council for Criminal
Justice, said of the city's proposal,
"This is not perfect legislation and
the mayor acknowledges that. But
this is the only legislation we are
faced with and out of frustration
we'd like to see it implemented."
Don Hess agrees. "There's no
question that the ideal would be na
tional legislation, then state legisla
tion," Hess said. "Local legislation is

the least ideal. We don't know pre
cisely what effect (local
will have but we do know what the
results are on the other side*'We
know what happens if we do noth
ing."
