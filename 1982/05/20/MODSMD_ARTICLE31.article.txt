# Slick, bold new magazine hits campus this quarter
## 
### Karen Springen 
A slick new magazine, Up
Front, provides a thought-pro
voking, in-depth look at many
pertinent local issues and per
sonalities.
The spring volume ($1) fea
tures a diverse collection of
articles ranging from cocaine
to football to the economics
department. At times the sub
ject matter seems too "beau
tiful people" oriented. But in
gerveral, editors Jordan
Bender, Tina Essey and Andrew
Kaiser sensitively treat delicate
and often neglected subjects.
Cocaine theme
Cocaine seemed the domi
nant theme oLthe first Upfront
volume. A short history of co
caine, a look at dealing at Stan
ford, an examination of the
clinical effects of coke and an
interview with Psychology
Prof. Phil Zimbardo on cocaine
provided a thorough examina
tion of "the most popular il
legal drug in America today."
IJft£ej£ocaine theme easily
and logically led into Peter
Spivack's article, "Are Students
Ptbove the Law?" Here we
learn that one can receive a
maximum penalty of a $500 fine
and or 30 days in jail for using a
fake ID since it is falsifying a le
gal document. Spivak also
speaks to Stanford Police Dept.
Chief Marvin Harrington, who
explained that "80 percent of
what we do is not law enforce
ment."
Bill Walsh interview
Senior Peter Finch obtained

yet another of Up Front's ex
clusive interviews with a top
notch newsmaker, San Francis
co 49ers coach Bill Walsh. The
former Stanford coach, who
led the Cards to back-to-back
bowl victories in 1977 and 1978,
candidly answered questions.
In assessing quarterback John
Elway, for example, he said, "I
think John is a brilliant athlete
with great instincts. He's had a
very good career, but not as
great as I had hoped."
Economics
The review of the economics
department is also extremely
pertinent, since economics is
now the most popular major
here. The approach an ex
amination of the department
and a letter from department
chairman Paul David pro
vided an unbiased look at the
phenomenon.
Humor
The magazine achieves an
admirable balance of humor
and "serious" topics. In the hu
mor category, cartoonist Phil
Chalk and sophomore Diane
Johnson vividly portray four
Stanford stereotypes: The Os
tentate, The Geek, The Utili
tarian, and The Earthy Vege
tarian, El Salvador-Protestor,
Coffee-Houser. The Coffee-
Houser's political convictions
are described as "left of Lenin"
while The Ostentate's hobby is
"filling out order forms from
Talbott's". In sum, the social
commentary manages to of
fend just about everyone.
Bender's piece, "Where to

Dodge the Draft," is also funny
but somewhat farfetched
and contrived. Best places to
RO. Bender writes, include

Stanford in Kenya, USC, The
Bridge, Colombia, Mazatlan
College Tours and Antartica
while the worst places feature
Green Library, Columbae
House, UC Berkeley and
Hiroshima.
Entertainment
The entertainment slant, too,
is University-related. Up
Front's local emphasis is con
tinued with a profile of The
Druids, a Stanford rock band
which was formerly called

Rooftop Magic.
(The Druids review contains
the only large typographical

error in the magazine: An ad
mittedly extremely good para
graph, explaining the origin of

the name "Druid", is repeated.
In general, Up Front has few
editing mistakes.)
Photo Contest
The photo contest, which
produced superb results, rep
resents a definite highlight of
Up Front. Matt Herron, winner
of two honorable mentions,
captures the beauty of the hu
man body in his photographs.
And Barry Munger's shot of an
obese women with a hip
potamus to her rear aptly re
ceived the "social commen

tarv" award.
The '6os
Chris Cale's examination of
"'6os Activism in the '80s"
seemed slightly out of place.
Unlike other issues treated in
the magazine, this one seemed
slightly obscure. In a question
and answer format, Cale "in
terviewed" an alleged '6os rad
ical, "Bill Rebelski." Un
fortunately, the reader had
trouble distinguishing whether
Rebelski was a fictitious or real
person. And in a magazine fea
turing first-rate interviews with
newsworthy persons such as
Walsh and Zimbardo, the de
cision to question a mythical
person appeared strange.
Effort
It is obvious that editors
Bender, Kaiser, and Essey
who have been active on the
ASSU, Dial Tone and the Daily
respectively put tremen
dous effort into creating Up
Front. Because they recruited
top-notch writers, such as
Monika Guttman, Peter Finch
and Kevin Kennedy, to in
terview well-known person
alities, they received quality re
sults.
The magazine received cam
pus support: the Publications
Board and SCIRE aided the
project, awarding $6OO and
$450 respectively. Up Front also
collected about $lOOO in ad
revenue.
The magazineshould appear
either biannually or trrannually
next year.
