# Frankie, Johnnie, and Luigi: where life is more than a chease Pizza

Frankie, Johnnie and
Luigi's Restaurant has been
around since 1968, and
though much has already
been said in its praise, one
can never say enough good
things about this place.
As most Stanford students
know, FJ & L's is synoymous
with pizza. With topping
choices including onion,
ham, bell peppers, pep
peroni, salami, Linuicia Ital
ian Sauaage, mushrooms,
black olives, anchovies,
shrimp and beef, the pizza
permutations are endless.
Quantity, of course, does
not indicate quality, but one
needn't worry about that
here.
On a recent visit, my din
ing partner and I began our
gastronomic excursion with
one of FJ & L's most popular
appetizers, the Fresh
Sauteed Vegetables ($2.75).
The vegetables which in
cluded zuchinni, carrots
and mushrooms were de
lightfully fresh and the
creamy sauce of cream, se
cret spices and wine was su
perb.
The dinner salad at $2 was
similarly fresh and flavorful

and we both gave high
marks to the house Italian
dressing.
Since pizza is the specialty
here we decided it would be
the most suitable entree
choice. In an effort to find
out whether it was the top
pings that made the pizza so
great or the pizza that made

the toppings so great we or
dered a half and half com
bination: on one half the
'Stromboli' combination of
sausage, mushrooms, per
pperoni and salami, as well
as onions; on the other half
... zilch. That's right just
cheese and tomato. The
toppings were truly divine,
but I am happy to report
that a naked Fj & L pizza was
every bit as savory. In fact,
absent the toppings, you
can better appreciate the
crispy, crunchy crust, the
tangy fresh tomato sauce
and the chewy Mozzarella
cheese that make the essen

tial FJ & L's pizza what it is.
But we didn't stop here.
We couldn't leave without
sampling at least one of the
12 House Favorites. We de
cided on the Fettucini Van
Houtini ($5.75). The recipe is
described on the menu as
follows: "Brown garlic,
fresh parsely onions and
mushrooms olive oil and
butter! Reduce with
Marsala, Add fresh cream
and spices (secret) and
simmer. Surround with
fresh tomatoes, garnish and
serve. Suggested for
purposes of Aphrodesia!"
Whether it is the recipe or
the skillful chefs who are re
sponsible doesn't really
matter the net result was
fabulous. Even if FJ & L's
didn't serve pizza, the res
taurant could pack people
in with its fettucini alone.
And that brings me to a
final word about packing
people in. F, J & L's doesn't
take reservations and even
with space for more than
200, there's almost always a
long line for dinner by 6:00
p.m. any day of the week. So
either get there early, or be
prepared for a wait. On a
warm night, you may want
to ask for an outdoor table,
where you can enjoy your
pizza under the stars.

Quantity, of
course, does
not indicate
quality, but
one needn't
worry about
that here.
