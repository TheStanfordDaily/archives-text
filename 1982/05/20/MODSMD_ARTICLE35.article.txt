Acapulco enjoys a popular
reputation here for its
margarita-filled happy hours.
After all, the nearby Mexican
restaurant offers 21 flavors
ranging from strawberry
banana to lemon-lime.
But in addition to a margarita
selection "bar" none, Acapul
co offers a wide array of food in
a somewhat "touristic" Mexi
can atmosphere.
While surveying the 22-page
menu, we devoured the warm
chips served with two (not
too) spicy salsas which were
brought immediately to our
table.
We decided on two ap
petizers traditional Nachos
($3.25) and the enticing-sound
ing Cheese Crisp ($3.00).
The nachos, chips covered
with beans, melted cheese, ol
ives, onions, tomatoes and

more beans, were good but
ask for extra cheese and fewer
beans!
The cheese crisp, a flour
tortilla topped with two
cheeses, jalapenos, tomatoes
and olives, was small but in
teresting. Although covered
with an ample serving of
cheese, it could have been
melted a bit more. (Order it
well done!)
We were full already from a
combination of the appetizers
and chain-eating chips from
the bottomless basket. But we
decided on the Flour
Quesadilla ($3.65) and the

Chimichanga ($4.95).
The chicken chimichanga,
chicken rolled in a flour tortilla
and lightly fried, was served
with rice and beans. It was
stuffed with chicken.
The Mexican specialty in
cluded a choice of soup or
salad. The decision was
gazpacho, a cold, fresh, thick
soup generously packed with
onions, tomatoes, celery and
olives (apparently a favorite
here Acapulco is an olive
lovers paradise).
The quesadilla, also accom
panied by beans and rice, was a
soft taco filled with cheese,
green chile and onions. It was
quite good and not greasy as
quesadillas often tend to be.
The rice and beans were stan
dard beans are beans!
Other entrees included
seafood dishes such as
swordfish ($6.95) and red snap
per ($8.25). A wide selection of
burritos, eggs, taco salads and a
la carte choices (tacos,
enchiladas, tamales and chile
relleno) complicated the final
decision. Side orders include
tortillas ($.65) and guacamole
($1.95).
Desserts which we did not
order, setting a precedent!
included flan with kahlua ($2)
and deep-fried ice cream
($1.95).
According to Keith Drake,
the general manager, the
house specialty is steak picado
($6.95), strips of sauteed steak
with bell peppers, fresh
tomatoes and onions, served
with the customary rice and
beans. Drake also noted the
popularity of combination
plates.
Surroundings
The spacious restaurant seats
286. And the majority of those
are students, perhaps a re
flection of the happy hours.
The casual atmosphere
created by the young crowd,
large bar, Mexican back
ground music and hanging
plants make it virtually im
possible to feel uncomfortable
here.
Our hostess, cheerful and
dressed in a flower-print dress,
seated us in a large booth close
to the kitchen. Although a
kitchen-front location is not
usually a favorite, it did allow us
to enjoy quick service and food

brought piping-hot directly
from the oven.
Quick, efficient and friendly
service is obviously a source of
pride at Acapulco. Empty
nacho chip baskets and water

glasses were refilled magically.
