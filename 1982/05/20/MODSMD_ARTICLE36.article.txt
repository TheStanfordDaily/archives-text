# Flea Street Cafe â€“ It's the next best thing to home

Instead of heading to The
Dutch Goose for burgers and
beer, we decided to have lunch
at the Flea Street Cafe, a quaint
little restaurant next door. The
cafe might not look special
from the outside, but its homey
atmosphere delighted us.
As we entered, the maitre d'
greeted us and seated us in the
third of three small rooms; the
first was filled with business
people enjoying drinks and
dessert at the bar, while the
other two were humming with
luncheon conversations.
African violets fHled the win
dow box and a bouquet of
fresh flowers adorned our
table. The walls and tablecloths
were a subtle rose and pale
blue. Just as in grandmother's
parlor, knick-ckacks covered
the walls and a lamp burned at
every table. Ready for lunch,

we turned our attention to the
hand-printed menus in front of
us. A wide array of salads,
luncheon plates, omelettes
and hot and cold sandwiches
enticed our appetites. (Prices
ranged from $4 for an open
faced egg salad sandwich to $7
for a seafood salad most
lunch items were around
$5.5 Q.)
When the waiter came for
our drink order, we had a hard
time choosing from a varied
selection including teas, natu
ral sodas, champagne, beer
and espresso drinks. After or
dering tea, we looked over all
the delicious sounding dishes
and decided on a garden salad
full of fresh vegetables and a
grilled sandwich with
muenster cheese, avacado and
tomatoes.
But when the waitress came
and told us the specials of the
day, all three sounded so good
that we both changed our
minds. This time we chose the

vegetable platter of fresh vege
tables, mushroom tart, half a
steamed artichoke and the
open-faced shrimp salad sand

wich with fresh spinach and Di
jon mustard on whole-wheat
bread.
Soft classical music played
while we waited for our meal.
Whenever our iced tea
glasses bordered on empty,
they were promptly refilled
by the manager, as we later dis

cohered. Our meal satisfied
our appetites, but we had seen
some tempting desserts on
nearby tables and couldn't re
sist. From the daily homemade
selections, we chose custard
apple pie and double choco
late cake with whipping cream.
The cake was good, but it defi

nitely placed second to the pie
which was absolutely delicious.
By 2 o'clock, as we were on
our way out, the restaurant had
begun to empty of its luncheon
crowd. We took one last look
around to make sure we hadn't
missed any of grandma's knick
knacks. Driving home, we both

gave this restaurant a top grade
and we highly recommend it
for lunch.
The Flea Street Cafe is also
open for dinner, offering en
trees which range from $5.95 to
$B.
