## from the wires of the Associated Press and Los Angeles Times/Washington Post News U.N. talks on Falklands stall 
### 
United Nations Secretary-General Javier Perez de Cuellar reported
to the Security Council yesterday that he had failed in 11 days of
strenuous negotiations to bring Britain and Argentina into agreement
in the Falklands crisis.
But he told the 15-nation group in a closed meeting that he had talked
by telephone with British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher and Argen
tine President Leopoldo Galtieri yesterday afternoon to express his
"great concern" and proposed that he continue to seek an accord.
"We are at a very dangerous point in the efforts for an agreement/'
the secretary said after the session. "The time left for negotiations must
now be measured in hours/' he said.
"I have suggested certain ideas which I believe might be of assistance
in overcoming the remaining points of difference/' he added. "The cost
of failure in terms of human life and suffering is too high to permit us to
give up our efforts."
Members of the council said Perez de Cuellar reported in detail on
his marathon talks with Argentine Deputy Foreign Minister Enrique
Jorge Ros and the British ambassador to the United Nations, Sir Anthony
Parsons. As one of the five permanent members of the council, Parsons
was at the meeting. Because Argentina is not a member, Ros was not.
Parsons described himself as "pessimistic." Earlier
in the day, he had delivered his government's re
sponse to Argentina's "final" offer, made late Tues
day night. That response still left the two sides divided
on several issues.
Earlier, Japanese, West European and Latin
diplomats disclosed that Argentine Ambassador to
the U.N. Jorge Roca had informed them that, from his
government's viewpoint, the Perez de Cuellar peace
effort was dead. A West European ambassador
quoted Roca as saying that the talks broke down be
cause "there was no possibility to sell a compromise
to our mutual populations there has been too
much emotionalization of public opinion."
Roca was also reported to have detailed these final
areas of disagreement:
—The extent of territory involved. Argentina main
tains that the Falklands together with South Georgia
Island and the South Sandwich Island should be re
garded as an entity. Britain asserts that only the
Falklands are subject to negotiation.
—The role of the inhabitants of the islands in an in
terim regime. Britain insists on recognition of the
Falklanders' local government, while Argentina main
tains that this would be a disguised continuation of
British rule.
—A time limitation on direct negotiations between
Britain and Argentina over the permanent future of
the islands. Britain seeks an open-ended arrange
ment; Argentina has insisted on a fixed term for the
talks.
Although there had been predictions that the Se
curity Council might step in to assert Jurisdiction over
the conflict if Perez de Cuellar failed to reach a settle
ment, there was no move to do so in the meeting yes
terday.
The lack of an agreement brought irriration to the
surface here, some from Western Europeans who
found fault with their Common Market and North At
lantic Treaty Organization ally.
"We have had to settle more legacies of bungled
British decolonization here, starting with Israel and

going into Cyprus," one European said. "And after
the bombing of Coventry and London during World
War 11, it is amazing that the British seem so anxious to
bomb Argentina."
A U.S. diplomat also registered his frustrations at
the seeming dead end of a negotiations. "I am going
to feel bitter about every dead body Argentine or
British if this results in war," he said. "They will
have been betrayed by their own governments."
Two nations prepare for invasion
Buenos Aires, Argentina, and London The pros
pects for a peace settlement to prevent renewed
fighting between Argentina and Britain in the South
Atlantic appeared to be slipping away yesterday as Ar
gentine officials charged that, Britain had turned
down a series of diplomatic proposals.
Meanwhile, in London, British Prime Minister
Margaret Thatcher indicated that the long weeks of
diplomacy are over and that an assault is imminent.
The British task force has been reinforced and is
poised for an invasion of the Argentine-held Falkland
Islands.
Barring an unexpected breakthrough in peace
talks, only the timing of an invasion seemed in ques
tion.
Thatcher met twice with her Cabinet during the day
to study Argentine peace proposals forwarded from
the United Nations. However, after a meeting on a
preliminary report on the proposals, she told re
porters: "I'm afraid it doesn't look very encouraging.
The gap (between British and Argentine positions)
looks big."
Officials in Buenos Aires said that they remain will
ing to negotiate an end to the 48-day-old confronta
tion. But Foreign Ministry cabinet chief Gustavo
Figueroa said "there's not a willingness to negotiate"
in Britain.
Military officials here privately predicted a major
British attack on the Falklands within hours, and
Figueroa declared that"the defender of Argentine in
terests is going to be Gen. Menendez," the com
mander of the 7000 to 10,000 Argentine troops re

ported to be positioned on the territory.
Adopting a position similar to that taken by Argen
tine officials when the diplomatic efforts of U.S. Sec
retary of State Alexander Haig unraveled last month,
Foreign Ministry officials yesterday maintained that
Argentina was continuing to present"new ideas" and
hoped negotiations at the United Nations would con
tinue.
But behind the emphasis on British intransigence
and Argentina's new ideas lay an implicit rejection of
the diplomatic formulas proposed by Britain on Mon
day after a weekend of consultations in London, gov
ernment officials here conceded.
In a radio interview yesterday morning, Figueroa
emphasized what he said was the reasonableness of
Argentina's own written proposal for a settlement
submitted to U.N. Secretary General Javier Perez de
Cuellar.
Cecil Parkinson, Conservative Party chairman and a
member of Thatcher's "war cabinet," said the prime
minister would present the FJouse of Commons today
drafts of seven different diplomatic proposals con
sidered by London and Buenos Aires since the Argen
tines invaded the Falklands on April 2.
"The documents will show that Britain acted in
good faith but Argentina caused the breakdown,"
Parkinson said.
An account from the key coastal town of Com
odoro Rivadavia by the news service Noticias Argen
tinas said the "air bridge" of Argentine planes carry
ing supplies to the Falklands had been stopped. The
interruption of this air route, the only means Argen
tina has to resupply its troops on the islands, has been
a principal objective of the British task force in re
peatedly bombing Argentine airfields on the island.
"The Royal Navy task force is now making the final
preparations for an invasion," John Witherow, a Lon
don Times reporter, radioed from the Invincible, one
of two carriers with the task force.
Most observers in London believe that some kind
of ground assault will take place in the next few days,
although it will probably be something less than a full
scale invasion.

Profits, GNP suffer drop
Washington Corporate profits suffered their sec
ond-largest drop since 1953 during the first quarter of
1982 as the economy continued to stagger under the
impact of the recession, the Commerce Department
reported yesterday.
During the quarter ended March 31, before-tax
profits fell from an annual rate of $212.8 billion to a
rate of $169.8 billion, while after-tax profits declined
from a rate of $144 billion to $llB.B billion, the report
said.
Along with the latest corporate profit figures, the
Commerce Department also released its update of
the gross national product for the first quarter of 1982.
That report showed that the GNP, the broadest meas
ure of the nation's economic activity, fell by an infla
tion-adjusted 4.3 percent from January through
March instead of the originally estimated 3.9 percent.,
That compared with a decline of 4.5 percent also
computed on an annual rate in the previous quar
ter.

Profits, GNP suffer drop
Washington Corporate profits suffered their sec
ond-largest drop since 1953 during the first quarter of
1982 as the economy continued to stagger under the
impact of the recession, the Commerce Department
reported yesterday.
During the quarter ended March 31, before-tax
profits fell from an annual rate of $212.8 billion to a
rate of $169.8 billion, while after-tax profits declined
from a rate of $144 billion to $llB.B billion, the report
said.
Along with the latest corporate profit figures, the
Commerce Department also released its update of
the gross national product for the first quarter of 1982.
That report showed that the GNP, the broadest meas
ure of the nation's economic activity, fell by an infla
tion-adjusted 4.3 percent from January through
March instead of the originally estimated 3.9 percent.,
That compared with a decline of 4.5 percent also
computed on an annual rate in the previous quar

United Nations Secretary-General Javier Perez de Cuellar reported
to the Security Council yesterday that he had failed in 11 days of
strenuous negotiations to bring Britain and Argentina into agreement
in the Falklands crisis.
But he told the 15-nation group in a closed meeting that he had talked
by telephone with British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher and Argen
tine President Leopoldo Galtieri yesterday afternoon to express his
"great concern" and proposed that he continue to seek an accord.
"We are at a very dangerous point in the efforts for an agreement/'
the secretary said after the session. "The time left for negotiations must
now be measured in hours/' he said.
"I have suggested certain ideas which I believe might be of assistance
in overcoming the remaining points of difference/' he added. "The cost
of failure in terms of human life and suffering is too high to permit us to
give up our efforts."
Members of the council said Perez de Cuellar reported in detail on
his marathon talks with Argentine Deputy Foreign Minister Enrique
Jorge Ros and the British ambassador to the United Nations, Sir Anthony
Parsons. As one of the five permanent members of the council, Parsons
was at the meeting. Because Argentina is not a member, Ros was not.
Parsons described himself as "pessimistic." Earlier
in the day, he had delivered his government's re
sponse to Argentina's "final" offer, made late Tues
day night. That response still left the two sides divided
on several issues.
Earlier, Japanese, West European and Latin
diplomats disclosed that Argentine Ambassador to
the U.N. Jorge Roca had informed them that, from his
government's viewpoint, the Perez de Cuellar peace
effort was dead. A West European ambassador
quoted Roca as saying that the talks broke down be
cause "there was no possibility to sell a compromise
to our mutual populations there has been too
much emotionalization of public opinion."
Roca was also reported to have detailed these final
areas of disagreement:
—The extent of territory involved. Argentina main
tains that the Falklands together with South Georgia
Island and the South Sandwich Island should be re
garded as an entity. Britain asserts that only the
Falklands are subject to negotiation.
—The role of the inhabitants of the islands in an in
terim regime. Britain insists on recognition of the
Falklanders' local government, while Argentina main
tains that this would be a disguised continuation of
British rule.
—A time limitation on direct negotiations between
Britain and Argentina over the permanent future of
the islands. Britain seeks an open-ended arrange
ment; Argentina has insisted on a fixed term for the
talks.
Although there had been predictions that the Se
curity Council might step in to assert Jurisdiction over
the conflict if Perez de Cuellar failed to reach a settle
ment, there was no move to do so in the meeting yes
terday.
The lack of an agreement brought irriration to the
surface here, some from Western Europeans who
found fault with their Common Market and North At
lantic Treaty Organization ally.
"We have had to settle more legacies of bungled
British decolonization here, starting with Israel and

going into Cyprus," one European said. "And after
the bombing of Coventry and London during World
War 11, it is amazing that the British seem so anxious to
bomb Argentina."
A U.S. diplomat also registered his frustrations at
the seeming dead end of a negotiations. "I am going
to feel bitter about every dead body Argentine or
British if this results in war," he said. "They will
have been betrayed by their own governments."
Two nations prepare for invasion
Buenos Aires, Argentina, and London The pros
pects for a peace settlement to prevent renewed
fighting between Argentina and Britain in the South
Atlantic appeared to be slipping away yesterday as Ar
gentine officials charged that, Britain had turned
down a series of diplomatic proposals.
Meanwhile, in London, British Prime Minister
Margaret Thatcher indicated that the long weeks of
diplomacy are over and that an assault is imminent.
The British task force has been reinforced and is
poised for an invasion of the Argentine-held Falkland
Islands.
Barring an unexpected breakthrough in peace
talks, only the timing of an invasion seemed in ques
tion.
Thatcher met twice with her Cabinet during the day
to study Argentine peace proposals forwarded from
the United Nations. However, after a meeting on a
preliminary report on the proposals, she told re
porters: "I'm afraid it doesn't look very encouraging.
The gap (between British and Argentine positions)
looks big."
Officials in Buenos Aires said that they remain will
ing to negotiate an end to the 48-day-old confronta
tion. But Foreign Ministry cabinet chief Gustavo
Figueroa said "there's not a willingness to negotiate"
in Britain.
Military officials here privately predicted a major
British attack on the Falklands within hours, and
Figueroa declared that"the defender of Argentine in
terests is going to be Gen. Menendez," the com
mander of the 7000 to 10,000 Argentine troops re

ported to be positioned on the territory.
Adopting a position similar to that taken by Argen
tine officials when the diplomatic efforts of U.S. Sec
retary of State Alexander Haig unraveled last month,
Foreign Ministry officials yesterday maintained that
Argentina was continuing to present"new ideas" and
hoped negotiations at the United Nations would con
tinue.
But behind the emphasis on British intransigence
and Argentina's new ideas lay an implicit rejection of
the diplomatic formulas proposed by Britain on Mon
day after a weekend of consultations in London, gov
ernment officials here conceded.
In a radio interview yesterday morning, Figueroa
emphasized what he said was the reasonableness of
Argentina's own written proposal for a settlement
submitted to U.N. Secretary General Javier Perez de
Cuellar.
Cecil Parkinson, Conservative Party chairman and a
member of Thatcher's "war cabinet," said the prime
minister would present the FJouse of Commons today
drafts of seven different diplomatic proposals con
sidered by London and Buenos Aires since the Argen
tines invaded the Falklands on April 2.
"The documents will show that Britain acted in
good faith but Argentina caused the breakdown,"
Parkinson said.
An account from the key coastal town of Com
odoro Rivadavia by the news service Noticias Argen
tinas said the "air bridge" of Argentine planes carry
ing supplies to the Falklands had been stopped. The
interruption of this air route, the only means Argen
tina has to resupply its troops on the islands, has been
a principal objective of the British task force in re
peatedly bombing Argentine airfields on the island.
"The Royal Navy task force is now making the final
preparations for an invasion," John Witherow, a Lon
don Times reporter, radioed from the Invincible, one
of two carriers with the task force.
Most observers in London believe that some kind
of ground assault will take place in the next few days,
although it will probably be something less than a full

mander of the 7000 to 10,000 Argentine troops re

ported to be positioned on the territory.
Adopting a position similar to that taken by Argen
tine officials when the diplomatic efforts of U.S. Sec
retary of State Alexander Haig unraveled last month,
Foreign Ministry officials yesterday maintained that
Argentina was continuing to present"new ideas" and
hoped negotiations at the United Nations would con
tinue.
But behind the emphasis on British intransigence
and Argentina's new ideas lay an implicit rejection of
the diplomatic formulas proposed by Britain on Mon
day after a weekend of consultations in London, gov
ernment officials here conceded.
In a radio interview yesterday morning, Figueroa
emphasized what he said was the reasonableness of
Argentina's own written proposal for a settlement
submitted to U.N. Secretary General Javier Perez de
Cuellar.
Cecil Parkinson, Conservative Party chairman and a
member of Thatcher's "war cabinet," said the prime
minister would present the FJouse of Commons today
drafts of seven different diplomatic proposals con
sidered by London and Buenos Aires since the Argen
tines invaded the Falklands on April 2.
"The documents will show that Britain acted in
good faith but Argentina caused the breakdown,"
Parkinson said.
An account from the key coastal town of Com
odoro Rivadavia by the news service Noticias Argen
tinas said the "air bridge" of Argentine planes carry
ing supplies to the Falklands had been stopped. The
interruption of this air route, the only means Argen
tina has to resupply its troops on the islands, has been
a principal objective of the British task force in re
peatedly bombing Argentine airfields on the island.
"The Royal Navy task force is now making the final
preparations for an invasion," John Witherow, a Lon
don Times reporter, radioed from the Invincible, one
of two carriers with the task force.
Most observers in London believe that some kind
of ground assault will take place in the next few days,
although it will probably be something less than a full
scale invasion.

Profits, GNP suffer drop
Washington Corporate profits suffered their sec
ond-largest drop since 1953 during the first quarter of
1982 as the economy continued to stagger under the
impact of the recession, the Commerce Department
reported yesterday.
During the quarter ended March 31, before-tax
profits fell from an annual rate of $212.8 billion to a
rate of $169.8 billion, while after-tax profits declined
from a rate of $144 billion to $llB.B billion, the report
said.
Along with the latest corporate profit figures, the
Commerce Department also released its update of
the gross national product for the first quarter of 1982.
That report showed that the GNP, the broadest meas
ure of the nation's economic activity, fell by an infla
tion-adjusted 4.3 percent from January through
March instead of the originally estimated 3.9 percent.,
That compared with a decline of 4.5 percent also
computed on an annual rate in the previous quar
ter.
