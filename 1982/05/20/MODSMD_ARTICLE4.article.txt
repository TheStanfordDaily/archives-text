## from the wires of the Associated Press and Los Angeles Times/Washington Post News U.N. talks on Falklands stall 
### 
United Nations Secretary-General Javier Perez de Cuellar reported
to the Security Council yesterday that he had failed in 11 days of
strenuous negotiations to bring Britain and Argentina into agreement
in the Falklands crisis.
But he told the 15-nation group in a closed meeting that he had talked
by telephone with British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher and Argen
tine President Leopoldo Galtieri yesterday afternoon to express his
"great concern" and proposed that he continue to seek an accord.
"We are at a very dangerous point in the efforts for an agreement/'
the secretary said after the session. "The time left for negotiations must
now be measured in hours/' he said.
"I have suggested certain ideas which I believe might be of assistance
in overcoming the remaining points of difference/' he added. "The cost
of failure in terms of human life and suffering is too high to permit us to
give up our efforts."
Members of the council said Perez de Cuellar reported in detail on
his marathon talks with Argentine Deputy Foreign Minister Enrique
Jorge Ros and the British ambassador to the United Nations, Sir Anthony
Parsons. As one of the five permanent members of the council, Parsons
was at the meeting. Because Argentina is not a member, Ros was not.
