The Nicaraguan government will not prohibit El
Salvadoran rebels from entering and moving through
their country and it will continue to supply the rebels
with arms, said Dr. Francisco Fiallos, the Nicaraguan am
bassador to the United States. Fiallos spoke to about 60
people in Bolivar House yesterday.
"We think that their struggle is fair and just," said
Fiallos, who has been ambassador to the United State for
three months.
Fiallos said that on all other points the Nicaraguan gov
ernment is willing to negotiate with the United States,
with whom it has been having "serious problems." It
would like to again have the good relations with the U.S.
that it had during former President Jimmy Carter's ad
ministration, he said.
The Nicaraguan government's refusal to be manipu
lated, as it was during regime of President Anastasio

Somoza, may be the reason for poor relations with the
United States, he said. "Our main objective is non-align
ment. We want to have control over our foreign policy,"
he added.
Fiallos said that U.S. fears of a military buildup are un
warranted. He claimed that Nicaragua's 15,000 man army
was a very small one, and that Nicaragua and Costa Rica
were the only two countries in South America that did
not have air forces. Fiallos admitted that two Soviet heli
copters seen in a Nicaraguan airport were gifts from the
Soviet Union. "But that was the extent of the present,"
he said.
There is, according to Fiallos, a large militia force. "Ev
eryone students, professors, workers is organized
into the militia. If there is an emergency, everyone
knows where to go." Fiallos said all members of the
militia train one day a week and two Saturdays of each
