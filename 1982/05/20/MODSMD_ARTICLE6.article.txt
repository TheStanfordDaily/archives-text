The Nicaraguan government will not prohibit El
Salvadoran rebels from entering and moving through
their country and it will continue to supply the rebels
with arms, said Dr. Francisco Fiallos, the Nicaraguan am
bassador to the United States. Fiallos spoke to about 60
people in Bolivar House yesterday.
"We think that their struggle is fair and just," said
Fiallos, who has been ambassador to the United State for
three months.
Fiallos said that on all other points the Nicaraguan gov
ernment is willing to negotiate with the United States,
with whom it has been having "serious problems." It
would like to again have the good relations with the U.S.
that it had during former President Jimmy Carter's ad
ministration, he said.
The Nicaraguan government's refusal to be manipu
lated, as it was during regime of President Anastasio

Somoza, may be the reason for poor relations with the
United States, he said. "Our main objective is non-align
ment. We want to have control over our foreign policy,"
he added.
Fiallos said that U.S. fears of a military buildup are un
warranted. He claimed that Nicaragua's 15,000 man army
was a very small one, and that Nicaragua and Costa Rica
were the only two countries in South America that did
not have air forces. Fiallos admitted that two Soviet heli
copters seen in a Nicaraguan airport were gifts from the
Soviet Union. "But that was the extent of the present,"
he said.
There is, according to Fiallos, a large militia force. "Ev
eryone students, professors, workers is organized
into the militia. If there is an emergency, everyone
knows where to go." Fiallos said all members of the
militia train one day a week and two Saturdays of each
An incident in 1980 in which the
U.S. State Department requested that
the Nicaraguan government shut
down a radio station being used by El

Salvadorian rebels proved that his
country wanted friendly relations
with the United States, Fiallos said.
"We did not have the equipment
to prove that the radio station ex
isted. When the U.S. gave us the
proof, we stopped it," he said.
He said a similar situation now ex
ists with U.S. accusation of arms

being smuggled from the United
States, through Nicaragua and Hon
duras and into El Salvador.
"We know that there is arms smug
gling from the U.S.. It is easier to find
weapons in the U.S. than it is to find
chicklets. We say to the U.S., 'lf you
know there is a traffic of arms
through Nicaragua, give us proof,' "

Fiallos said.
Fiallos said that a patrol force be
tween Nicaragua and Honduras
would be an effective measure to
check smuggling. Honduras lies be
tween Nicaragua and El Salvador.
While political alliances are not de
sired, economic agreements are wel
come, he said. Nicaragua recently

signed an agreement with the Soviet
Union which will enable Nicaragua
to receive loans to buy Russian ma
chines. Nicaragua will also receive 20
Soviet doctors who will teach as both
doctors and instructors, he said. Doc
tors from Cubas are also working in
Nicaragua, he added.
" We don't deny that we have rela

tions with the Soviet Union and
Cuba," he said.
According to Fiallos, most of the
recent economic aid has been com
ing from Mexico, Venezuela, the Eu
ropean Economic Community; and
Canada. "When Carter was presi
dent, we received the largest amount
of aid from the U. 5.," he said.
