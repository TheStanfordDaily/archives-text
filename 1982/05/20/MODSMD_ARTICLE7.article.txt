# TMU: Management and labor cannot agree

Allegations of short-staffing and an
insensitivity to workers' needs on the
part of Tresidder Union management
have led to an increase in labor-man
agement tensions, according to some
of Tresidder's maintenance and
custodial crew.
The crew, responsible for day and
night cleaning of the Union, as well
as maintenance, called increases in
the management's criticism of the
crew's work both unwarranted and
unfair.
"We feel harassed," said Linda
Crouse, shop steward for the crew.
"The workers are feeling very uneasy
about current attitudes of man
agement towards their work and it's
causing a definite morale problem."
Workers feel that this attitude has
been prevailing since the change in
Tresidder management two years

ago, but has worsened since the con
troversial laying off of Rick
Hernandez, a maintenance employ
ee for the crew. Hernandez was laid
off nine months ago.
"It's never been like this before,"
commented Clyde Cookson, a custo
dian who has been with the crew for
19 years. "Before the change in ad
ministration it was more pleasant to
work here. I feel that since the
switch, the supervisors at Tresidder
aren't aware of what workers' needs
are."
The management, however, says it
does not recognize any outstanding
labor-management problems be
tween itself and the crew. "There is
always a natural tension between la
bor and management" said Ellie Op
penheimer, director of Tresidder.
"However, I feel that things are less
tense now than they have been in
past periods."

"I don't see a problem with the
crew that isn't manageable," added
Larry Davidson, assistant director of
Tresidder. "I talk with the crew about
their complaints and as far as I'm con
cerned, there are no major dif
ficulties in our relations." He said

that there has been no increase in
worker grievances or charges against
the management for unfair labor
practices.
Workers have also complained of a
change in attitude of management
towards labor, claiming it is unfeeling
and harsh. "We have seen a tremen
dous increase in memos from man
agement complaining of our work,"
said Ah Kau Lee, lead workman for
the crew. "We feel they are un
justified, yet when we present these
concerns to management, it's as if
they don't listen to us."
"It's really hard for the day shift,"
added Henry Battle, a member of the
night crew. "We hear stories from
other workers about Davidson's ac
tions and sometimes we have prob
lems as well." He added that because
of time shifts, the crew ordinarily
does not see Davidson, but the night
