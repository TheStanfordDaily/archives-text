# TMU: Management and labor cannot agree

Last in a series
Allegations of short-staffing and an
insensitivity to workers' needs on the
part of Tresidder Union management
have led to an increase in labor-man
agement tensions, according to some
of Tresidder's maintenance and
custodial crew.
The crew, responsible for day and
night cleaning of the Union, as well
as maintenance, called increases in
the management's criticism of the
crew's work both unwarranted and
unfair.
"We feel harassed," said Linda
Crouse, shop steward for the crew.
"The workers are feeling very uneasy
about current attitudes of man
agement towards their work and it's
causing a definite morale problem."
Workers feel that this attitude has
been prevailing since the change in
Tresidder management two years

ago, but has worsened since the con
troversial laying off of Rick
Hernandez, a maintenance employ
ee for the crew. Hernandez was laid
off nine months ago.
"It's never been like this before,"
commented Clyde Cookson, a custo
dian who has been with the crew for
19 years. "Before the change in ad
ministration it was more pleasant to
work here. I feel that since the
switch, the supervisors at Tresidder
aren't aware of what workers' needs
are."
The management, however, says it
does not recognize any outstanding
labor-management problems be
tween itself and the crew. "There is
always a natural tension between la
bor and management" said Ellie Op
penheimer, director of Tresidder.
"However, I feel that things are less
tense now than they have been in
past periods."

"I don't see a problem with the
crew that isn't manageable," added
Larry Davidson, assistant director of
Tresidder. "I talk with the crew about
their complaints and as far as I'm con
cerned, there are no major dif
ficulties in our relations." He said

that there has been no increase in
worker grievances or charges against
the management for unfair labor
practices.
Workers have also complained of a
change in attitude of management
towards labor, claiming it is unfeeling
and harsh. "We have seen a tremen
dous increase in memos from man
agement complaining of our work,"
said Ah Kau Lee, lead workman for
the crew. "We feel they are un
justified, yet when we present these
concerns to management, it's as if
they don't listen to us."
"It's really hard for the day shift,"
added Henry Battle, a member of the
night crew. "We hear stories from
other workers about Davidson's ac
tions and sometimes we have prob
lems as well." He added that because
of time shifts, the crew ordinarily
does not see Davidson, but the night

crew nevertheless feels tension be
tween itself and the management.
Davidson said he feels this tension
to be out of the ordinary and that the
crew gives no indication of unhappi
ness or unrest. The feeling I'vealways
gotten from the night crew is that
things are fine," he said. "It's always
been a 'tell me what to do and I'll do
it' type of relationship and they've
never expressed any undue pressure
or dissatisfaction in the way we deal
with each other."
Davidson also said the problems
with the worker morale have im
proved in the period that the new ad
ministration has been at Tresidder.
"I knew that worker morale has
been low here and it was one of man
agement's top priorities when taking
over two years age," Davidson said.
"The current administration is look
ing up and looking forward, and we
feel that the worker morale is also
looking up with us. I don't really see
that there is a problem."
One possible explanation for the
crew's uneasiness is the upcoming
contract re-negotiations in August.
"All over the University, not just
here, workers and management are
more sensitive to issues," Davidson
said. "The personnel department
told us of this and we recognize its
importance. It's not one hundred
percent of the crew's claimed dis
satisfaction, but perhaps that's part of
it."
"We feel that the issues which we

are raising go beyond contract re
negotiations," Crouse said. "We feel
there is a basic management attitude
non-reception to our concerns
and that they expect much more
from us without giving us the neces
sary manpower." She said that some
times the crew has been unable to
finish their assigned duties and this
leads to increased frustration.
"Instead of encouraging us to dis
cuss these frustrations with them, the
management constantly criticizes
us," she said. "This is leading to de
creased worker morale, something
which is not beneficial to anyone."
"A lot of problem lies in staffing,"
added Robert Rodrigez, a member of
the night crew. "We need workers
and without them, we can't get all of
our jobs done. Management then
gets mad at us for not finishing and
we get upset. It's hard to be happy in
a situation like that."
Management, however, feels oth
erwise. "From what I've been able to
work out with the crew, we've more
than enough staff," Davidson said. "I
don't ever think you'll stop worker
dissatisfaction, but we're doing all we
can to address any problems or com
plaints the crew has. Things, how
ever, seem relatively stable as far as
I'm concerned."
Oppenheimer said there are dif
ferent opinions among the crew con
cerning current labor-management
relations. "We are trying to meet the
needs of our patrons while not sacri
ficing our crew at the same time," she
said. "We feel that we're doing well
at this." She added, "no matter how
well you're doing, there's always
room for improvement."

tions and sometimes we have prob
lems as well." He added that because
of time shifts, the crew ordinarily
does not see Davidson, but the night

crew nevertheless feels tension be
tween itself and the management.
Davidson said he feels this tension
to be out of the ordinary and that the
crew gives no indication of unhappi
ness or unrest. The feeling I'vealways
gotten from the night crew is that
things are fine," he said. "It's always
been a 'tell me what to do and I'll do
it' type of relationship and they've
never expressed any undue pressure
or dissatisfaction in the way we deal
with each other."
Davidson also said the problems
with the worker morale have im
proved in the period that the new ad
ministration has been at Tresidder.
"I knew that worker morale has
been low here and it was one of man
agement's top priorities when taking
over two years age," Davidson said.
"The current administration is look
ing up and looking forward, and we
feel that the worker morale is also
looking up with us. I don't really see
that there is a problem."
One possible explanation for the
crew's uneasiness is the upcoming
contract re-negotiations in August.
"All over the University, not just
here, workers and management are
more sensitive to issues," Davidson
said. "The personnel department
told us of this and we recognize its
importance. It's not one hundred
percent of the crew's claimed dis
satisfaction, but perhaps that's part of
it."
"We feel that the issues which we

are raising go beyond contract re
negotiations," Crouse said. "We feel
there is a basic management attitude
non-reception to our concerns
and that they expect much more
from us without giving us the neces
sary manpower." She said that some
times the crew has been unable to
finish their assigned duties and this
leads to increased frustration.
"Instead of encouraging us to dis
cuss these frustrations with them, the
management constantly criticizes
us," she said. "This is leading to de
creased worker morale, something
which is not beneficial to anyone."
"A lot of problem lies in staffing,"
added Robert Rodrigez, a member of
the night crew. "We need workers
and without them, we can't get all of
our jobs done. Management then
gets mad at us for not finishing and
we get upset. It's hard to be happy in
a situation like that."
Management, however, feels oth
erwise. "From what I've been able to
work out with the crew, we've more
than enough staff," Davidson said. "I
don't ever think you'll stop worker
dissatisfaction, but we're doing all we
can to address any problems or com
plaints the crew has. Things, how
ever, seem relatively stable as far as
I'm concerned."
Oppenheimer said there are dif
ferent opinions among the crew con
cerning current labor-management
relations. "We are trying to meet the
needs of our patrons while not sacri
ficing our crew at the same time," she
said. "We feel that we're doing well
at this." She added, "no matter how
well you're doing, there's always
room for improvement."
Last in a series
Allegations of short-staffing and an
insensitivity to workers' needs on the
part of Tresidder Union management
have led to an increase in labor-man
agement tensions, according to some
of Tresidder's maintenance and
custodial crew.
The crew, responsible for day and
night cleaning of the Union, as well
as maintenance, called increases in
the management's criticism of the
crew's work both unwarranted and
unfair.
"We feel harassed," said Linda
Crouse, shop steward for the crew.
"The workers are feeling very uneasy
about current attitudes of man
agement towards their work and it's
causing a definite morale problem."
Workers feel that this attitude has
been prevailing since the change in
Tresidder management two years

ago, but has worsened since the con
troversial laying off of Rick
Hernandez, a maintenance employ
ee for the crew. Hernandez was laid
off nine months ago.
"It's never been like this before,"
commented Clyde Cookson, a custo
dian who has been with the crew for
19 years. "Before the change in ad
ministration it was more pleasant to
work here. I feel that since the
switch, the supervisors at Tresidder
aren't aware of what workers' needs
are."
The management, however, says it
does not recognize any outstanding
labor-management problems be
tween itself and the crew. "There is
always a natural tension between la
bor and management" said Ellie Op
penheimer, director of Tresidder.
"However, I feel that things are less
tense now than they have been in
past periods."

"I don't see a problem with the
crew that isn't manageable," added
Larry Davidson, assistant director of
Tresidder. "I talk with the crew about
their complaints and as far as I'm con
cerned, there are no major dif
ficulties in our relations." He said

that there has been no increase in
worker grievances or charges against
the management for unfair labor
practices.
Workers have also complained of a
change in attitude of management
towards labor, claiming it is unfeeling
and harsh. "We have seen a tremen
dous increase in memos from man
agement complaining of our work,"
said Ah Kau Lee, lead workman for
the crew. "We feel they are un
justified, yet when we present these
concerns to management, it's as if
they don't listen to us."
"It's really hard for the day shift,"
added Henry Battle, a member of the
night crew. "We hear stories from
other workers about Davidson's ac
tions and sometimes we have prob
lems as well." He added that because
of time shifts, the crew ordinarily
does not see Davidson, but the night

crew nevertheless feels tension be
