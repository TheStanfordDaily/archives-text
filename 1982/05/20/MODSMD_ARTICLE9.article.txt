# Duarte: godfather to the poor
## 
### Los Angeles Times 
San Salvador, El Salvador He is not their
president any more, and maybe that makes it
easier for them. Poor people don't get to talk to
presidents very often.
They have come to see Jose Napoleon Duarte,
and they have come early and are prepared to
stay late. They wait near his office, on the stairs,
in the hallway. They rehearse what they are
there to say. Senior Duarte, por favor. A job. A
handout.
Finally, he arrives, and the poor people step
aside. He is shorter than some thought, a
paunchy man in a blue guayabera shirt. He ac
knowledges a few of them with a quick "buenas
tardes" and disappears into his office. A man
with a rifle blocks the door.
In time, Duarte will see 30 of them. Every day
he tries to see 30. He is not powerful enough to
be the Godfather, but, three weeks after leaving
the presidency, he seems eager to be El
Salvador's Uncle Jose.
He is scanning the mail when the phone
buzzes. "What problem does she have?" he asks
his secretary. "Her son is i 11?... What's he got?..
. How old is he?... 15?"
He takes the call. "Has a doctor seen him?...
He says to hospitalize him? ... He has psy
chological problems? . . . Give me your name
and the doctor's . . . I'll check with the doctor
and see how I can help ... I don't promise any
thing."
He hangs up and swivels his chair back behind
his metal desk. It is a modest office, not like the
one he had as president.
Duarte, 55, remains head of the Christian
Democrats, a time-consuming job as his party
jostles for power in a fragmented government.

Duarte, too, is an engineer, once one of El
Salvador's most successful. He says he would
eventually like to resume the profession.
When Duarte left the presidency, there was
speculation that he would also leave the coun
try. He owns a home and a beach house in Vene
zuela, where he once lived in exile. To blunt the
rumors, he placed newspaper ads saying that
Duarte would be in his office here and that his
door would be open to the people.
"They come with private problems, problems
in marriage, problems with children," Duarte
says.
"The most difficult is when people ask for
money. Someone wanted 8,000 colones ($3,200).
She had a debt and she didn't want to lose her
property. In that case, I said no.
More than 90 percent, Duarte estimates, come
in hope of getting a job. They believe that a
former president still carries some wand of
power. Duarte, after all, is Duarte.
Ana Matilde Mejia Rauno is widowed at 21,
and she holds an infant in her lap. A second
child, just 18 days old, is at home. She has waited
all day.
"I will take any job as long as I can see my chil
dren at night," she says.
Duarte could not provide jobs for the poor
even when he was president. Typically, the job
less leave his office with a letter to the employer
of their choice.
Ana Matilde Mejia Rauno has gotten a letter
to a soap factory. "Maybe Duarte has a friend
there," she says hopefully.
But it is more than just the hope of a job she
leaves with; it is a sense that someone important
has recognized her plight. She has waited in the
long line and actually seen the former president.
