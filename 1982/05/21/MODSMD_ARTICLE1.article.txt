## 
### Michael Weiss John Sawoski 
Amid tight security, Crown Prince
of Jordan Hassan bin Talal made an
unannounced two-hour visit to the
Hoover Institution yesterday to give a
15-minute speech to about 20 Hoo
ver Fellows and other unnamed in
vitees, although no direct press cov
erage was allowed.
Hoover Senior Fellow and Director
of Domestic Studies Thomas Moore
said Prince Hassan spoke about how
Jordan views the trouble spots in the
Middle East, such as Israel, the West
Bank, Syria, Iraq and Iran.
"He was particularly concerned
with the Iraqui-lranian war and the
lack of coverage of the war in the
American press. He said that a little
while ago 26,000 soldiers died in bat
tle, but that this information was ig
nored in American media, as op
posed to the kind of coverage that
the Falkland crisis has received,"
Moore said.
According to Moore, Prince
Hassan also said he finds the war
troublesome because both Isreal and
Syria are providing military aid to the
Iranians. Jordan is currently supply
ing soldiers to Iraq. However, he did
not make any appeal for any Ameri
can aid.
A luncheon followed the speech,
Moore added.
Hoover Assoc. Fellow John Moore,
who organized the event, said that

Prince Hassan was attracted to the
Hoover Institution by the large col
lection of Middle East archives as well
as by Hoover's many international af
fairs specialists. "He told us he
wanted to talk privately about in
ternational affairs. We set it up ac
cording to his specifications," Moore
said.
Hoover Asst. Director Dennis
Spellmire stated that Prince Hassan
had requested to the State Depart
ment that the speech remain unan
nounced, even to most University
faculty and members of Hoover.
President Donald Kennedy denied
knowledge of the event, although
Assistant to the President Bob
Hamrdla said last night, "He may well
have known about it but might not
have wanted to tell people."
Shortly after the prince's arrival,
however, the Jordan Desk at the State
Department in Washington con
firmed that he was on a private visit to
this country and was in fact speaking
at Hoover.
Jim Coplan, the assistant executive
director at the Commonwealth Club
of California in San Francisco, which
often hosts political speakers, said
that Prince Hassan spoke there
Wednesday night and that he re
ceived no request from the State De
partment about keeping the talk
there quiet. In fact, he said that it was
publicized throughout the Bay Area.

News of the event at Hoover was
kept low-key, but the prince's arrival
at 11 a.m. certainly was not. A motor
cade of California Highway Pa
trolmen, Stanford police and other
security guards escorted the Crown
Prince and his entourage to the back
of Herbert Hoover Memorial Build
ing. Prince Hassan's entourage in
cluded three black limosines and
three sedans.
While most of his 20 Jordanian as
sociates rode in limosines, the prince
himself preferred to ride in a sedan,
said chauffeur Davey Jones. He said
the prince had arrived in San Francis
co Wednesday by private plane.
When the prince, who was wearing
a brown suit, walked out of Hoover at
1 p.m., he waved briefly to the crowd
of about 30 students gathered there.
He then left to fly to Chicago.
John Moore said Prince Hassan
had made certain specific requests
about security measures at the Uni
versity. According to Moore, the se
curity, which consisted of security
men standing guard around Hoover
and police cars circling the area, was
provided by Hassan, the State De
partment and Stanford.
According to the Jordanian Em
bassy in Washington, Hassan is on a
10-day private visit to the United
States. He has been invited to several
cities and universities to give talks.
