# Farm life to reality
## 
### 
Unreality permeates our lives. As
Stanford students, we live a life that
bears little resemblance to the real
world which a fourth of us are pre
paring to enter. We spend a few
hours in class each morning, intellec
tually browsing through subjects of
interest. Outside of classtime, our
time is largely our own. Sure, we have
to spend some extra hours studying
our chosen subjects, but, honestly,
few of us put in a 40-hour week study
ing. There is space in our lives â€”
space for doing whatever we care to
do. This freedom distinguishes us
from the eight to five working world.
We are adults, but we don't lead
adult lives.

Our undergraduate paradise is
particularly isolated from reality.
Stanford is full of "comfortable"
people, and few of them bring burn
ing social problems with them to
school. You can sit a long time in
White Plaza without catching even a
glimpse of the downtrodden or op
pressed.
Is it right that we should enjoy such
a relatively idyllic existence in a trou
bled world? I don't know. Maybe you
have the intellectual objectivity to
distance yourself from experiences
of happiness and growth and to eval
uate their social propriety, but I
don't. Can an environment free of
the serious problems of the real
world prepare an individual to take a
constructive role in society? Possibly.
Does four years of rubbing shoulders
with society's "winners" make you
less prone to worry about the
"losers"? I hope not. Stanford has
been a positive experience for me,
and I doubt that I could ever regret it.

No, this attempt to reflect on what
makes life here special is nothing
more than an attempt to soften the
shock of reentry into the real world
by anticipating the most dramatic dif
ferences. I want to take stock of what
I've got before it's gone.
I believe the most striking dif
ference will be in our social lives. I'm
not saying that the people "here" are
any better than the people "out
there," but the context of our in
teraction will be different.
At Stanford, we enjoy an endless
diversity of people from which to
pick our friends. You can sift through
all the people you live with, study
with and meet through extracur
ricular activities to find those few
with whom you can share a special
closeness.
Once you find these people, you
have all that leisure time to throw at
the friendship. Your time for friends
isn't squeezed in between eight-to
five shifts and five day work weeks.
You also have proximity on your side.
You can walk to any dorm on campus
in 10 minutes. That's pretty close.
I don't mean to depict life after
Stanford as grim and unhappy. I hope
those eight to five shifts will be spent
doing something fulfilling. Likewise,
the outside world is not a social
desert. But the scope of your social
contact and the time you give it will
be far more limited. Talking with a
friend into the long hours of the
night will be harder to justify when
you have to be up at 7 the next morn
ing and at your desk until 5 p.m. Per
haps, the greatest shock will be dis
covering that most of the people in
the world aren't our own age.
Given that Stanford is a relative so
cial paradise, does the quality of our
relationships here have any lasting
value beyond creating a lot of good
memories and long-distance friend
ships? I think so. Any good social ex
perience teaches the importance of
people. If you take advantage of
Stanford's social opportunities, you
learn that other people can be
sources of great joy and growth in
your life. In a society that sees itself as
becoming increasingly materialistic
and self-centered, that's not a bad
lesson to learn.
