## Did Reagan lose Falklands? 
### 
Washington — In one respect, at
least, national politicians are much
like other Americans: they often un
sheathe their true feelings on week
ends.
That was the case last Saturday
(May 8) for Sen. Charles Percy of Illi
nois. The chairman of the Senate For
eign Relations Committee made
some notable off-the-cuff remarks at
a homestate GOP affair in Spring
field. In short, he indirectly accused
the Reagan administration of pre
cipitating the Falkland Islands crisis
by wooing Argentina's ruling gener
als.
Of course, the diplomatic Percy
employed more discreet language.
"We should have given a clear signal
to (the Argentines that) there was no
way we could remain neutral in a sit

uation against as strong an ally as
Great Britain," he said.
Unfortunately, as everyone knows,
the Reagan administration did the
opposite. Instead of keeping one ear
to the ground and one eye trained on
the generals, the United States was
intent on nothing more than recruit
ing allies in its Central American anti
communism shell game.
The seeds of the Falklands crisis
were sown early last year when Presi
dent Ronald Reagan let it be known
that he would not take military dic
tators to task for their dismal human
rights records. In return for such si
lence the White House expected
support for its policies in Central
America. Reagan's infatuation with
the Argentine generals hinged
directly on his campaign against
Cuban and Soviet involvement in
Nicaragua and El Salvador. So hell
bent was the administration to gain
"inter-American" support, it over
looked the powder keg in the South
Atlantic, or at least did little to pre
vent it.
To some extent, the policy worked.
Diplomatic sources in Buenos Aires
confirm that 100 Argentine military
instructors are in El Salvador, almost
twice the number of U.S. advisers
there. Gen. Antonio Vaquero, the
Argentine army chief of staff, has said
repeatedly that his nation "under
stands and values the struggle of the
Salvadoran armed forces and will
provide assistance as far as feasible."
(Under secret agreement, an un
specified number of Argentines may
be working to destabilize
Nicaragua's Sandinist government.)
Yet, two weeks before the Argen
tines invaded the British-held
Falklands, Thomas Enders, U.S. assis
tant secretary of state for inter-Amer
ican affairs, arrived in Buenos Aires to
"verify" the generals' progress on
the human rights front (a prere
quisite for any arms sales in the
future) and to reconfirm Argentine
support of the Salvadoran junta. Ob
sessed with his own projects, Enders
apparently mistook the immediacy of
the Falklands issue and, by his si
lence, gave a green light to the gen
erals.
Other State Department sensors
didn't pick up on the unfolding
South Atlantic scenario. Fully (two
months before invasion) the Argen
tine game plan was outlined in the
Buenos Aires newspaper, La Prensa.
"The Argentine government will

submitin the near future a number of
conditions to the British government
in order to proceed with the nego
tiations on the Malvinas (the
Falklands)," read the Jan. 24 com
mentary. "If London does not accept
them, Argentina will immediately in
terrupt the talks. According to re
liable diplomatic sources, such con
ditions will firm and clear and will
ever, set very precise time periods for
the solution of the different aspects
of the problem ... Buenos Aires will
take over the island by force this
year."
These and other indicators, includ
ing the notorious satellite photos of
an Argentine naval buildup, have un
doubtedly haunted the State Depart-

support, it

least did little to
prevent it.

ment as the body counts have
mounted. Indeed, one wonders what
the U.S. Embassy in Buenos Aires has
been working on lately — and
whether anyone here has been lis
tening.
In spite of the evidence, the Rea
gan administration did little — or
nothing — to modify its newfound
friend's probable behavior. It neither
backed off on arms deals nor delayed
Argentina's human rights veri
fication. Instead, on the night of the
invasion several of our chief diplo
matic figures — Enders, U.N. Am
bassador Jeane Kirkpatrick, Deputy
Secretary of State Walter Stoessel and
Army Secretary John Marsh — at
tended a dinner at the home of the
Argentine ambassador in Washing
ton. If the Argentines believed they
were acting with impunity, then per
haps they were.
It's no wonder Percy and others
prefer to blame the Falkland Islands
crisis on poor intelligence.
