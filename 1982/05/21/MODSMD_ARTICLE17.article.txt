## Local reinforcement of film pornography 
### 
The fact that pornographic movies continue to
be box-office successes on this campus is a source
of amazement for feminists and feminist sympa
thizers alike. How is it that Stanford students, a
supposedly enlightened group which overwhelm
ingly supports the Equal Rights Amendment or at
least the concept of sexual equality, turn out in
such great numbers to see women objectified, de
graded and humiliated? If you have seen one of
these films since coming to Stanford, and particu
larly if you are thinking of attending this Saturday
night's showing of Ultra Flesh (sponsored by the
Chaparral), this question is directed to you.
Pornography is not something which should be
taken lightly or laughingly indulged. Inequality be
tween the sexes is socially created and changeable.
Pornography is not only a reflection but a rein
forcement of the male concept of woman as an ob
ject which invites and appreciates male domi
nance.
The most important objection to pornography is
not drawn from some vague sense of puritanical or
Victorian morality. Films like Ultra Flesh are essen
tially concerned with the depiction of male power
and superiority. Sex in and of itself is by no means
repugnant. The perpetuation of male dominanc*

through the institution of pornography, however,
is.
Recent debate over pornography has split along
apparently non-partisan lines. The right opposes
pornography on traditional moral grounds.
Feminists, on the other hand, view pornography as
"terrorist propaganda" against women which
should be halted by any means available. Still oth
ers, while identifying with the feminist point of
view, cite first amendment rights and claim that
nothing can done against pornography which
would not jeopardize these rights.
Regardless of the positions of these three fac
tions, though, it is a striking observation that none
looks favorably upon pornography. Why, then, are
pornographic films economically successful here?
Do the students who attend these films lack politi
cal identity? Probably not.
While the predominantly male audience that
attends Ultra Flesh this Saturday may agree in
tellectually with the concept of equality, one won
ders what it is that they will "enjoy" in such a film.
Social analysts suggest that many of them will feel a
sense of power and superiority which they will jok
ingly deny at the end of the film. Some may **ven

claim that Ultra Flesh, with its "26 centerfold beau
ties," is boring and offensive. Still, the simple truth
is that most men know what to expect when they
attend such a movie and yet, they go anyway.
It should be stressed that students who attend X
rated films are not simply engaging in a minor in
dulgence of their emotional desires. They are ac
tively and concretely choosing to support an in
stitution whose sole purpose is to make money by
perpetuating male dominance and the subordina
tion of women. Every dollar spent on pornography
encourages its continued existence. How it is that
Stanford students can even hope to justify their
support of this institution is beyond me.
No legislation should be necessary to eliminate
pornography. In a capitalist economy, only those
things which are demanded are produced. If stu
dents honestly oppose pornography — the ideol
ogy of forced sex — they should refuse to attend
pornographic films and actively encourage their
peers to do likewise. If we cannot eliminate porno
graphy, we can at least free our community of its
presence.
