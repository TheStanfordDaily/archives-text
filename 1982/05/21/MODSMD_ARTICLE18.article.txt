## Pornography distorts women's image, eroticizes power 
### 
It takes a lot of thinking to under
stand why pronography is harmful to
everyone. Please begin thinking.
We are not the Moral Majority,
and it is not profligate sex or graphic
depiction of bodily parts that we ob
ject to.
Pornography degrades women. It
says we like fo be forced into sub
mission and manipulated as objects
or property. It says we exist for the
use and pleasure of men. It also
censors us because no one listens
when we assert the contrary. (Re
member? "No" means "maybe," and
"maybe" means "yes.")
Pornography IS violence. It is not
fantasy, not a script. The women you
view are forced psychologically, eco
nomically, and often at gunpoint to
do things they do not choose. Porno
graphy also promotes violence
against all women; i.e., rape is covert
ly legitimized.
Pornography eroticizes power and
dominance for men as it eroticizes
submission for women. These forced

role definitions are equally stifling
for both sexes. And, we question the
connection between a definition of
masculinity as powerful and threat
ening, and violence in society at large
. .. or even the arms race mentality.
Make these connections. Porno
graphy hurts everybody.

Parking woes at Encina
The Special Olympics is Saturday at
the Stanford Swim Center. I drove to
Stanford from San Jose Tuesday eve
ning and found Encina Station so I
could attend the orientation session
for volunteers. I and nine other vol
unteers paid $5 each to the Santa
Clara County Sheriff's Department
for parking on the road outside the
building.
Deputy K. Bryan should be com
mended for his initiative and industry
in ticketing all the volunteers' cars in
front of the meeting place during the
one-and-one-half hour orientation.
To step inside and ask volunteers to
move their cars would not only have

interrupted the orientation, but also
lost the Sherriff's Department $50.
This incident has soured my volun
teer effort for the Special Olympics
and I will certainly think twice before
driving to Stanford and searching the
campus for meeting places and park
ing.

Sexism or feminism?
Mike Sternick's letter to the Daily
which appeared on May 10 left me
quite confused. He claimed to be "a
recent convert to radical feminism"
and attacked Roger Whitney's com
ment about "a good-sized reservoir
of women to fill open spots" at the
French House.
After a bit of contemplation, I was
to arrive at only two explanations for
this letter. The first is that Sternick re
ally does think he is a radical feminist.
If this is the case, he has jumped in
over his head. Anyone who refers to
the women on this campus as "young
Stanford ladies" and "co-eds" has a
long way to go before he can call
himself a radical feminist. The term
"co-ed" itself is an outmoded term

which even most traditionalists have
realized is inherently sexist in its im
plication that education is the norm
for men while it is a departure from
role for women.
The only other possible explana
tion for Sternick's letter is that it was
an attempt to parody the radical
feminist position. The fact that Stern
ick is presumably an intelligent law
student makes me suspicious of the
cliche, "shocked and offended,"
opening to the letter. His ludicrous
misinterpretation of "good-sized" as
referring to women's physiques rath
er than the size of the reservoir put
more doubt in my mind. Finally, his
conclusion that "such words only
serve to perpetuate the stereotypes
that all men are misogynists and all
radical feminists are paranoid" seems
to more accurately describe his
words rather than Whitney's words.
In a world where examples of sexism
orders of magnitude more blatant
are available continually, it is hard to
believe that he is not trying to make
readers think that radical feminists
are paranoid.
