## Laxmen ready for UCLA 
### Gray Maxwell 
The men's lacrosse team de
feated UC-Berkeley last week
end to win the Northern
Division of the Western Col
legiate Lacrosse Association.
Stanford will host UCLA for the
California Collegiate Cham
pionship tomorrow.
Stanford won the title in 1979
and was runner-up in 1980, los
ing a doS&'fcohteSt to UC-Santa
Barbara. This is the first time in
several years that any school
other than UCSB has won the
Southern Division and is the
first time that UCLA has made it
to post-season play.
Freshman middie Adam
Tracy scored Stanford's first
goal against Berkeley last Satur
day, beating Cal goalie Mike
Chang. Aaron Persky regis
tered the assist. Cal's Jackson
Ricker scored four minutes lat
er to tie the score.
The Stanford attack was slug
gish in the early parts of the

game, but received a lift when
freshman John Patrick took the
ball behind the net, circled
around the right and then
scored on a solo drive across
the crease.
Stanford controlled the sec
ond and third quarters, out
scoring Cal 9-2. Chris Romer
and Kelly Williams
spearheaded the scoring with
each player tallying two goals
and two assists.
Down 12-4 at the beginning
of the final period, Cal tried to
catch up quickly by using a fast
break offense. UCB middie
Karl Baldauf managed to slip
past the Cardinal defense early
in the quarter and fired a a
point-blank shot on goalie
Bruce Aylward. Aylward made
a great save which seemed to
take the life out of the Cal
team.
Berkeley scored later in the
game when one of Baldauf's
shots — which hit the post but

came into play — was ruled a
goal. Cal scored again taking
advantage of a man-up situ
ation. The offense then came
alive and scored twice more,
but it was not enough to over
come Stanford's large lead.
Stanford concluded the reg
ular season a 13-3-0 record. The
squad was undefeated against
WCLA foes, winning all nine of
its matches. The only disap
pointments in an otherwise
perfect season were losses to
Tucson and UCLA in the
Western States Tournament.
Two of those losses were in
sudden death overtime — all
three by one-goal margins.
Stanford has a chance to
avenge the Bruin loss tomor
row when it battles UCLA for
the Championship. The game
is slated to begin at 2 p.m. and
will be played on the field
directly in front of DeGuerre
Pool.
