Ittee in reviewing the tenure candidates,
partment also has a committee that obtains
tletters and inside evidence on teaching
search. That committee presents its evi
tothe department and its recommendation
fitted, along with a vote, to the dean, who

reviews it with the assistance of the committee.
The recommendation of the department was
positive in Freedman's case and "There is, I think,
lots of evidence that Estelle is a superior teacher,
she has been very active in the development of a
number of important programs for Stanford ..
but I think that H & S did not find the evidence
fully persuasive," Kennedy said,-
He added that the department is reviewing the
case again to see whether it may be able to make it
stronger and more persuasive.
In discussing this year's housing draw and the
low number of requests for co-op houses, Ken
nedy said, "I'm at a loss to explain why co-op
houses are in particular difficulty because that
strikes me as a nice arrangement in many ways, and
the co-op houses have been very successful. I real
ly don't know why they didn't attract more favor
able attention this time around."
Addressing the issue of ethnic theme houses,
Kennedy said there has been an ongoing debate as
to what their purpose is. The view, held by some,
that ethnic theme houses should be an enclave
where members of a particular group can feel
comfortable and not have to deal with the rest of
the culture here is not "one we can afford to agree
with institutionally. I think that the importance of
achieving cross-cultural understanding is too
great," he said.
Kennedy said that with the completion of the
new housing complex near Lake Lagunita, the Uni
versity expects to eliminate the need for an "un

guaranteed year" of housing for undergraduates.
The new complex will also make room for about
370 single graduate students who will be moved
into Manzanita Park (the trailers), he said.
"As to whether there will be a specific graduate
student housing initiative beyond that I'm uncer
tain but doubtful," Kennedy said. "It is frankly not
quite such a high priority with us to do graduate
student housing as to do undergraduate housing."
He noted that in most of the country's universities
graduate housing is not a particularly high priority
and that Stanford "houses more of its graduate stu
dents than any of the institutions with which it
competes."
Asked about the selection of the new outdoor
art on campus, Kennedy said the University con
sults "splendidly knowledgeable" members of the
Art Department about selection and the University
Committee on Land and Buildings on placement.
The clock tower recently approved for White
Plaza is somewhat different, he said, because it was
approved for its historical and nostalgic value, as a
restful oasis and fixed point of orientation to meet,
and because there is not a visible clock on that side
of campus.
"If all our dollars came in unrestricted I don't
think the provost and I could ever find reasons not
to allocate them to the University's very most cen
tral purposes. And if that happened we would cer
tainly build those purposes, but I think we might
find ourselves a very sterile environment in time,"
he added.
