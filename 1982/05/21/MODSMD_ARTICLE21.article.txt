# Jogathon success

The Stanford University Athletic Department hosted its
second ever jogathon yesterday afternoon at Stanford Sta
dium.
Athletes from both varsity and club sports participated in
the event in an effort to raise money for the Department of
Athletics and their own particular sports.
"Its a great opportunity for groups to raise money
without worrying about planning a fundraiser themselves,"
explained Anne Sattler the coordinator of the event. "Fifty
percent of the money that a team generates goes to that
club or sport while the remaining 50 percent goes to the De
partment of Athletics for a recruiting film."
One of the big surprises of the day was the amazing
stamina shown by Stanford football coach Paul Wiggin who
ran the event earlier in the day. Wiggin logged 28 laps which
was more than many of his players. One football player —
embarrassed that his coach had run more laps than him —
explained the disparity. "I wasn't really trying that hard," he
said.
Other coaches running in the event included baseball
coach Mark Marquess fresh from his recent playoff vic
tories, swimming coach Skip Kennedy, wrestling coach
Chris Horpel and many others. Associate Athletic Director
Alan Cummings also ran in the event.
Wiggin shot the starting gun and was on the sidelines
rooting his players on throughtout. He explained that the
football money would be used to refurbish the locker
rooms. "I've counted over 40 of our guys out there today,"
he said.
The jog lasted for one hour. Each of the members run
nning got people to sponsor them for each lap run.
The event ended with a big barbecue with plenty of
burgers, beer, soda and even Mrs. Field's cookies.
