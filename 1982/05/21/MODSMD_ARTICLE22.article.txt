# Doubles teams advance
## Davis in round of 16 
### Sally Jenkins 
As far as Athens, Ga. can tell,
the Stanford men's tennis team
is present at the NCAA Cham
pionships in fuii force.
Card ace Scott Davis, seeded
No. 4 in the singles tour
nament, advanced to the
round of 16 yesterday with two
solid wins and easily made the
second round in doubles with
teammate Jeff Arons. Stan
ford's No. 2 doubles team of
Scott Bondurant and John Cor
se also reached the second
round of play yesterday after a
narrow three set victory in
Wednesday's qualifying round.
All of which is okay by Stan
ford head coach Dick Gould,
since the Cardinal failed to
make the tournament as a
team. UCLA fufilled all proph
esies in gliding to the national
championship Wednesday
with a 5-1 victory over No. 3
seeded Pe^erdine.
Stanford, 15-10 for the sea
son and last year's NCAA
champion, was not chosen for
the tournament in spite of a 5-4
upset of Pepperdine at home.
Still, having four members of
the squad competing in the
tournament takes away some
of the sting for Gould, particu
larly since three of them are
departing seniors.
"It's still too early to really
get hot about it, but we're look
ing pretty good," said Gould.
"Today's matches are the
crucial ones. If both doubles
teams win then they advance to
the round of 16, which means
they make All-America. That
would be particularly nice for
the seniors, and I think they de
serve it."

Sophomore Davis defeated
Michigan's Mark Meese,
ranked No. 2 in the Big-10,6-4,
6-1 in the first round yesterday.
He overcame Brad Cox of
Auburn in much the same way
6-4, 6-2 to advance to the third
round, where he will meet
Pepperdine's Brad Gilbert to
day. Gilbert plays at No. 2 sin
gles for this year's NCAA run
nerup team behind teammate
Glenn Mitchibata, seeded sixth
in the singles tournament.
"Gilbert is a good player, the
type who is capable of winning
the whole tournament," said
Gould. "But Scott is playing
very well. He had two solid
wins over good players without
being on the court too long."
Other seeded players are
No. 1 Rodney Haromn of SMU,
No. 2 Marcel Freeman of
UCLA, No. 3 David Pate of Tex
as Christian, No. 5 Robbie
Venter of UCLA, No. 7 Mike
DePalmer of Tennessee, and
No. 8 Randy Nixon of UC-
Berkeley.
Bondurant and Corse de
feated Craig Kardon and, Ted
Erok of Texas 1-6, 7-5, 7-6
Wednesday to qualify for first
round play. They defeated
Clemson's Jean Desdunes and
Greg Cooper 6-3, 3-6, 6-2 in
doors when suffocating Geor
gia humidity turned to rain.
They face face Howard Sands
and Adam Beren of Harvard to
day.
Davis and Arons, also playing
indoors, wasted no time on
Brian Joelson and Tom Judson
of Texas A & M 6-2, 6-1. They
will meet hometown boys John
Mangan and Peter LLoyd of
Georgia today.
