# The
						Company tackles difficult drama
## 'Children's Hour': Campus production treats lesbianism 
### Jiri Weiss 
Rarely does a completely
amateur cast at Stanford tackle
such a difficult drama as Lillian
Hellman's The Children's Hour
with as much success as the
Company production at the
Women's Center of the Old
Union last week.
One of the play's difficulties
i lies in the subject. In the play,
! the lives and careers of two
! young women, Martha Dobie
and Karen Wright, are ruined
after a bratty pupil of theirs,
Mary, spreads the rumor that
their close relationship is "un

natural."
The story takes place in a
small New England town where
the two former college room
mates have opened a school
for girls. The scheming Mary
makes up a story that forces her
self-righteous grandmother to
call all of the other parents to
withdraw their daughters from
the school.
But the story does not end
there. Today, it is harder to im
agine anyone driven to ruin
and suicide by such an accusa
tion of lesbianism. And this is
one aspect that makes it hard to

make the play believable to a
Stanford audience.
People no longer feel as
trapped as Martha and Karen.
They live at a time when there
was no escape from such an ac
cusation. The combination of
social ostracism and the taboo
against lesbian relations is so
powerful, in fact, that it ruins
not only the trust between
Karen and her fiancee but also
the relationship between the
two women themselves.
Martha actually starts believing
that there was something
carnal in their close friendship.

After all, she did not look for
ward to Karen's upcoming
marriage. This horrible realiza
tion is something Martha can
not live with.
Although the play is not so
much about lesbianism as re
jection and prejudice in a soci
ety that does not care where
the truth really lies, it was so
controversial when it first
opened in 1934 that Hellman
had difficulty convincing the
leading women of the day that
it would not be closed by the
police.
The other difficulty in per

forming the play is getting the
cast. Managing and what is
even more difficult directing
little girls requires more ex
perience or innovation than
most student directors have.
On both counts the Company
production was, with a few ex
ceptions, successful.
Sophomore Janet Heimlich
has done an extraordinary job
as director. Heimlich, who had
acted irt a high school produc
tion of the play, made up what
she lacked in experience with
enthusiasm. She held auditions
at several Palo Alto junior high

schools: all of the girls' parts
were played by 14-year-olds in
this production. The rest of the
cast was composed of Stanford
students, both graduates and
undergraduates and the presi
dent of Children's Theatre in
Palo Alto, Beverly Flippen.
The highlights of the play
must have been the fight be
tween Mary and her friend
Evelyn and the final conversa
tion between .Martha and
Karen. Both Lisa Grabemann as
Karen and Jennifer Green as
Martha gave their roles just the
right amount of nervous

energy appropriate for high
strung school teachers. Shaun
Pankoski made perhaps a little
too harmless Aunt Lilly Mortar.
The weakest portions of this
production were the first and
last act. The play got off to a
rather rusty start and Martha's
suicide was not as believable as
it could have been â€” the sense
of tragic doom not large
enough.
There were a few other more
minor problems: a few even
minor scenery changes would
have done wonders between
acts to distinguish the setting.
