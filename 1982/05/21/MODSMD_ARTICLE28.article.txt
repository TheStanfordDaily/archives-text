## Oakland Ballet leaps from Tchaikovsky to electronic sound 
### Marc Vincent 
is it worthwhile to drive all
the way across the Bay to see
the Oakland Ballet? judging
from the first program of their
spring season, the answer is a
definite yes. They offered four
works of great variety, from
Tchaikovsky to electronic
sound, from classical ballet to
modern dance — and the dan
cers showed commitment and
skill.
The rare privilege afforded
on Saturday night was the
chance to see "Les Noces," as
performed with the original
choreography, re-created for
• the Oakland Ballet by Irina Ni
jinska. "Les Noces" was ori
ginally created in 1923 by Irina
Nijinska's mother, Bronislava,
who was sister to the famous
dancer Vaslav Nijinsky.
Bronislava was also a dancer,
but she carved her niche in
ballet history by choreo
graphing innovative works (in
cluding "Les Noces") for
Diaghilev's Ballets Russes. Her
daughter, Irina, was truly
"present at the creation": Irina
was a girl of nine when she
watched her mother create
"Les Noces,""and Irina danced
in the Paris premiere.
In later years, she many times
assisted her mother in reviving
her work. Oakland's rendition
of "Les Noces," supervised by
Irina, sews one more stitch with
this tiry thread of history, and
was made poignant by the
presence in the audience of
Irina Nijinska herself.
Stravinsky's music for "Les
Noces" calls for vocal soloists,
chorus, four pianos, and a bat
tery of percussion, and the
piece depicts a typical peasant
wedding in early 19th-century
Russia.
The text has no strict nar
rative, but is a collection of
words and sayings that might
be heard at such a wedding —
bits of prayer and folklore,
scraps of conversation, toasts
to the bride and groom, re
marks of the parents. These are
set to music that is in
Stravinsky's staccato, pro
pulsive, rhythmically-accented
vein, with glinting sparks and

spray from the percussion.
The most striking feature of
Nijinska's choreography —
from the scenes of the parents'
blessing of the bride and
groom through the wedding
feast — is its harsh severity. The
feeling of constriction is over
whelming; hardly a moment
exists when the dancers' hands
are not clenched into fists.
Their heads are repeatedly
pressed to one side or bowed
far forward — even as the dan
cers jump. t

The most striking feature of Nijinska's
choreography — from the scenes of the

severity. The feeling of constriction is
overwhelming; hardly a moment exists
when the dancers' hands are not clenched

From curtain-rise, the op
pressive tone is unmistakable.
The bride's home is evoked by
a vast, stark backdrop — the
wall of a room. Its blue paint
has faded, and its immensity is
broken only by one tiny win
dow.
As a phalanx of the bride's
friends, dressed in plain brown
and white, join in plaiting the
bride's long hair, the dancing is
militant and ritualistic. Elbows
jut, two-dimensional tableaux
are struck and held. Their small
jumps have a clipped quality —
as short and brisk as in jump
rope.
The groom's friends, also in
brown and white, dance with
the same sharp incisiveness as
the women. They stamp, bow,
cross their fisted arms on their
chests — or interlock their
arms and move side-to-side in
strict, crouched unison.
In the feast section,
when the singers mention the
folk-tale "swan" and "goose"
(in Russia these are terms of en
dearment, like "my little
mouse" or "my dove") the
dancing is momentarily more
sprightly, but the ending soon

finds all the dancers bent far
forward, fists pressed over their
ears as if in protest.
"Les Noces," though absorb
ing and exciting, left me feeling
joyless. In preparing the ori
ginal production, Stravinsky
and Diaghilev favored a more
festive, colorful approach. But
Nijinska found drama "in the
fate of-the bride and groom,
since the choice is made by the
parents to whom they owe
complete obedience." In. Ni
jinska's view, the bride and

groom are trapped.
Stravinsky's musjc may be
sharp and emphatic, but it
need not be biting and caustic.
In Oakland's approach, the
syncopated, accented chords
at the end — ringing out into
ever-increasing silence —
sounded hard and flinty.
The first two ballets — "In
Autumn," danced to
Tchaikovsky's "Variations on a
Rococo Theme," and a pas de
deux from "Daphnis and
Chloe," to Ravel's music — cast
a bright spotlight on ballerina
Erin Leedom. Blond-haired
and slimly-built, she is a
graceful dancer with an ex
cellent extension and fine bal
ance. Her body is amazingly
limber, and she looks especial
ly alive in the shoulders and
head. Her glance is alert, smil
ing, and constantly re
directed. She has a lovely neck
which she uses for expressive
inclinations of the head.
Tchaikovsky's free treatment
of the theme, and the cello
candenzas, lend the work an
improvisatory air that choreo
grapher Ronn Guidi captures
nicely. The nine dancers come

and go, merging smoothly into
different groupings and pat
terns. The rich colors of*
autumn fill a woodsy back
drop; the brownish costumes
have hints of a delicate, leafy
print.
Leedom re-appeared, part
nered by Michael Lower, for
the lovely pas de deux from
"Daphnis and Chloe." The
choreography by jean Paul
Comeline of the Stuttgart
Ballet conveys the innocence
and devotion of this
mythological pair. Ravel's lush
orchestration is all that's
needed to paint a picture of
their idyllic island.
The boy and girl are dis
covered on stage, far apart
from each other and curled in
tranquil sleep. They awaken at
the same time, espy one anoth
er -i- and their stretching, ex
panding movements blend
their awakening from slumber
with the feelings of their awak
ening love.
They take turns dancing for
one another. She gently
caresses his face, he playfully
grabs for her feet, they sway in
an embrace or walk together
matching step to step. The
dancing has a fluid, gently-re
spiring quality, like the way a
flower opens and closes. Both
dancers were excellent, the
lifts impressive.
The evening's third work —
"The Brood," choreographed
by Richard Kuch — traffics
heavily in modern dance. The
choreographer focuses on the
relationship between Mother
Courage and her three chil
dren. In the play, the children
all lose their lives during the
Thirty Years War; the mother
alone survives and must go on
living. "The Brood" seems to
represent a dream that Mother
George might have dreamt af
ter her children had all died, or
a vision of a hellish afterlife that
entraps them all. This dream, or
vision, reveals tremendous
feelings of guilt in the mother,
and bitter recrimination in the
children.

"The Brood" is thoroughly
gripping, in spite of the fact
that its ''story" is confusing and
its angry mood is unvarying.
The dancers' conviction was so
deep and their expression of
anger so true that I was drawn
to them and believed in them.
A child who is angry at his pa

rents is likely to find catharsis in
this work. But a parent who
feels that she has betrayed her
child would probably come
away from this work feeling
awful.
The Oakland Ballet's spring
season corrtinues through the
next two weekends. The corn

pany doesn't boast the sheer
quantity of top-flight dancers
that yoi' find at the S.F. Ballet,
and their music is usually rec
orded (except for "Les
Noces"). But last weekend's
program was emotionally rich,
handsomely presented, and
engrossing from start to finish.

is it worthwhile to drive all
the way across the Bay to see
the Oakland Ballet? judging
from the first program of their
spring season, the answer is a
definite yes. They offered four
works of great variety, from
Tchaikovsky to electronic
sound, from classical ballet to
modern dance — and the dan
cers showed commitment and
skill.
The rare privilege afforded
on Saturday night was the
chance to see "Les Noces," as
performed with the original

her work. Oakland's rendition
of "Les Noces," supervised by

was made poignant by the
presence in the audience of
Irina Nijinska herself.
Stravinsky's music for "Les

chorus, four pianos, and a bat

piece depicts a typical peasant
wedding in early 19th-century
Russia.
The text has no strict nar

words and sayings that might
be heard at such a wedding —
bits of prayer and folklore,
scraps of conversation, toasts
to the bride and groom, re

set to music that is in
Stravinsky's staccato, pro
pulsive, rhythmically-accented
vein, with glinting sparks and

spray from the percussion.
The most striking feature of
Nijinska's choreography —
from the scenes of the parents'

feast — is its harsh severity. The
feeling of constriction is over

From curtain-rise, the op

The bride's home is evoked by
a vast, stark backdrop — the
wall of a room. Its blue paint
has faded, and its immensity is
broken only by one tiny win

As a phalanx of the bride's
friends, dressed in plain brown
and white, join in plaiting the
bride's long hair, the dancing is
militant and ritualistic. Elbows
jut, two-dimensional tableaux
are struck and held. Their small
jumps have a clipped quality —
as short and brisk as in jump

The groom's friends, also in
brown and white, dance with
the same sharp incisiveness as
the women. They stamp, bow,
cross their fisted arms on their
chests — or interlock their
arms and move side-to-side in
strict, crouched unison.
In the feast section,
when the singers mention the
folk-tale "swan" and "goose"
(in Russia these are terms of en
dearment, like "my little
mouse" or "my dove") the
dancing is momentarily more
sprightly, but the ending soon

finds all the dancers bent far
forward, fists pressed over their
ears as if in protest.
"Les Noces," though absorb
ing and exciting, left me feeling
joyless. In preparing the ori
ginal production, Stravinsky
and Diaghilev favored a more
festive, colorful approach. But
Nijinska found drama "in the
fate of-the bride and groom,
since the choice is made by the
parents to whom they owe
complete obedience." In. Ni
jinska's view, the bride and

groom are trapped.
Stravinsky's musjc may be
sharp and emphatic, but it
need not be biting and caustic.
In Oakland's approach, the
syncopated, accented chords
at the end — ringing out into
ever-increasing silence —
sounded hard and flinty.
The first two ballets — "In
Autumn," danced to
Tchaikovsky's "Variations on a
Rococo Theme," and a pas de
deux from "Daphnis and
Chloe," to Ravel's music — cast
a bright spotlight on ballerina
Erin Leedom. Blond-haired
and slimly-built, she is a
graceful dancer with an ex
cellent extension and fine bal
ance. Her body is amazingly
limber, and she looks especial
ly alive in the shoulders and
head. Her glance is alert, smil
ing, and constantly re
directed. She has a lovely neck
which she uses for expressive
inclinations of the head.
Tchaikovsky's free treatment
of the theme, and the cello
candenzas, lend the work an
improvisatory air that choreo
grapher Ronn Guidi captures
nicely. The nine dancers come

and go, merging smoothly into
different groupings and pat
terns. The rich colors of*
autumn fill a woodsy back
drop; the brownish costumes
have hints of a delicate, leafy
print.
Leedom re-appeared, part
nered by Michael Lower, for
the lovely pas de deux from
"Daphnis and Chloe." The
choreography by jean Paul
Comeline of the Stuttgart
Ballet conveys the innocence
and devotion of this
mythological pair. Ravel's lush
orchestration is all that's
needed to paint a picture of
their idyllic island.
The boy and girl are dis
covered on stage, far apart
from each other and curled in
tranquil sleep. They awaken at
the same time, espy one anoth
er -i- and their stretching, ex
panding movements blend
their awakening from slumber

Nijinska found drama "in the
fate of-the bride and groom,
since the choice is made by the
parents to whom they owe
complete obedience." In. Ni
jinska's view, the bride and

groom are trapped.
Stravinsky's musjc may be
sharp and emphatic, but it
need not be biting and caustic.
In Oakland's approach, the
syncopated, accented chords
at the end — ringing out into
ever-increasing silence —
sounded hard and flinty.
The first two ballets — "In
Autumn," danced to
Tchaikovsky's "Variations on a
Rococo Theme," and a pas de
deux from "Daphnis and
Chloe," to Ravel's music — cast
a bright spotlight on ballerina
Erin Leedom. Blond-haired
and slimly-built, she is a
graceful dancer with an ex
cellent extension and fine bal
ance. Her body is amazingly
limber, and she looks especial
ly alive in the shoulders and
head. Her glance is alert, smil
ing, and constantly re
directed. She has a lovely neck
which she uses for expressive
inclinations of the head.
Tchaikovsky's free treatment
of the theme, and the cello
candenzas, lend the work an
improvisatory air that choreo
grapher Ronn Guidi captures
nicely. The nine dancers come

and go, merging smoothly into
different groupings and pat
terns. The rich colors of*
autumn fill a woodsy back
drop; the brownish costumes
have hints of a delicate, leafy
print.
Leedom re-appeared, part
nered by Michael Lower, for
the lovely pas de deux from
"Daphnis and Chloe." The
choreography by jean Paul
Comeline of the Stuttgart
Ballet conveys the innocence
and devotion of this
mythological pair. Ravel's lush
orchestration is all that's
needed to paint a picture of
their idyllic island.
The boy and girl are dis
covered on stage, far apart
from each other and curled in
tranquil sleep. They awaken at
the same time, espy one anoth
er -i- and their stretching, ex
panding movements blend
their awakening from slumber
with the feelings of their awak
ening love.
They take turns dancing for
one another. She gently
caresses his face, he playfully
grabs for her feet, they sway in
an embrace or walk together
matching step to step. The
dancing has a fluid, gently-re
spiring quality, like the way a
flower opens and closes. Both
dancers were excellent, the
lifts impressive.
The evening's third work —
"The Brood," choreographed
by Richard Kuch — traffics
heavily in modern dance. The
choreographer focuses on the
relationship between Mother
Courage and her three chil
dren. In the play, the children
all lose their lives during the
Thirty Years War; the mother
alone survives and must go on
living. "The Brood" seems to
represent a dream that Mother
George might have dreamt af
ter her children had all died, or
a vision of a hellish afterlife that
entraps them all. This dream, or
vision, reveals tremendous
feelings of guilt in the mother,
and bitter recrimination in the
children.

"The Brood" is thoroughly
gripping, in spite of the fact
that its ''story" is confusing and
its angry mood is unvarying.
The dancers' conviction was so
deep and their expression of
anger so true that I was drawn
to them and believed in them.
A child who is angry at his pa

rents is likely to find catharsis in
this work. But a parent who
feels that she has betrayed her
child would probably come
away from this work feeling
awful.
The Oakland Ballet's spring
season corrtinues through the
next two weekends. The corn

pany doesn't boast the sheer
quantity of top-flight dancers
that yoi' find at the S.F. Ballet,
and their music is usually rec
orded (except for "Les
Noces"). But last weekend's
program was emotionally rich,
handsomely presented, and
engrossing from start to finish.
