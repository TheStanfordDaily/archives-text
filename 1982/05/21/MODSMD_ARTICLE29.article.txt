# Jazz Notes
## 
### Ted Gioia 
The Full Faith in Credit Big Band, which
performs in a free jazz concert on the Cowell
Cluster green this Sunday, has already shown
the potential to be the finest big band on the
West Coast in two decades.
The band possesses a clean, smooth sound,
and plays its ensemble passages with a tight
ness that belies the group's young age. Much
of the credit for the band's success must go to
conductor Ray Brown. Brown's arrangements
are extremely engaging and avoid the ten
dency to be overly busy. Brown uses space
wisely and is able to convey a relaxed at
mosphere even on the uptempo numbers.
Full Faith in Credit proves, if proof were
needed, that section work can be well played

without denigrating into a facile demonstra
tion of technique.
