Yesterday the Daily incorrectly re
ported that the Nicaraguan Am
bassador to the United States, Dr.
Francisco Fiallos, said that the
Nicaraguan government has sup
plied arms to the rebels in El Salvador
and will continue to do so. In fact,
Fiallos made a strong statement that
the Nicaraguan government has nev
er supplied arms to the rebels and
does not intend to do so in the
future.
Fiallos did acknowledge, however,
that weapons for the rebels in El
Salvador have probably passed
through Nicaragua's border into
Honduras without the knowledge of
the Nicaraguan government.
The Daily regrets the error.
