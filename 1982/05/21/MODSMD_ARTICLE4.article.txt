Each nation published detailed defenses of the positions it
had taken during the three-week-long U.N. negotiating
process, seeking to avoid blame for the diplomatic
stalemate.
The peace effort by Perez de Cuellar that collapsed yester
day began on April 30 — four weeks after the Argentine in
vasion and on the day that Secretary of State Alexander Haig
announced abandonment of his own mediation shuttle.
The secretary general met the British and Argentine for
eign ministers to offer his framework for a settlement — a
cease-fire, mutual withdrawals, and temporary U.N. admin
istration of the islands while talks under a U.N. represent
ative resolve the sovereignty issue.
The British reacted coolly until, on May 7, Argentina
closed down the last alternative channel, involving the Unit
ed States and Peru, and the U.N. talks began in earnest.
Perez de Cuellar met daily — sometimes twice a day —
with Parsons and then with Argentina's Deputy Foreign Min
ister Enrique Ros, asking each side to suggest ways of over
coming differences, and sometimes offering his own ideas.
That first weekend, both sides accepted the link between a
cease-fire and the staged withdrawal of forces. But then
came the first stalemate, over Argentine insistence that the
"context" of the agreement must make clear that Argentina
will "inexorably" attain sovereignty over the islands.
The British rejected this, insisting that the outcome of the
final talks must not be "prejudged." But British sources told
reporters they believed all other issues could be resolved
easily.
Argentina agreed on May 11 that sovereignty was its "ob
jective," and not a precondition, which appeared to defuse
this issue. But on May 13, after members of British Prime Min
ister Margaret Thatcher's party raised fears of a "diplomatic
sellout," the British position toughened on at least two key
issues — withdrawal arrangements and the islanders' role
during the interim administration.
Thatcher orders landings
London — Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher said last
night that it has become impossible to negotiate a settlement
of the Falkland Islands dispute and government sources said
British forces have been ordered to begin landings and hit
and-run raids.
With no hope left for a negotiated settlement, military ac
tion will be escalated "quite steeply and quite quickly," ac
cording to Defense Ministry sources. They said timing and
tactics have been left to the task force commander, rear
Adm. Sandy Woodward, and may be dictated in part by
weather in the South Atlantic.
Senior government sources said they expected wide
spread British landings and hit-and-run attacks to begin by
the weekend at the latest. Rather than a concentrated "D
-day type" landing or frontal assault on Argentine forces
around the islands' capital of Stanley, government sources
said there would be coordinated, escalating attacks to cut off
and disable concentrations of Argentine troops and force
them into surrender with a minimum of casualties.
Thatcher said Argentina Wednesday rejected Britain's
final peace proposals, which represented "the limit to which

the government believed it was right to go" in making "rea
sonable practical changes" in the British negotiating position
without compromising principle. Because "these proposals
have been rejected," she told Parliament, "they are no long
er on the table."
At the same time, Thatcher said, "it was manifestly im
possible" for Britain to accept Argentina's final coun
terproposal. She said that "it retracted virtually all the move
ment their representative had shown" during the nego
tiations conducted by U.N. Secretary General Javier Perez de
Cuellar.
Thatcher argued that Argentina "plainly calculated to put
us at an enormous disadvantage" by demanding that British
forces return to their bases rather than withdrawing 150
miles from the Falklands, as the British proposed for both
sides. She strongly objected to an Argentine demand that
Britain also withdraw from the island of South Georgia,
which Thatcher said is a legally separate British territory 800
miles from the Falklands.
Thatcher said Argentina's proposal for administration of
the islands after mutual withdrawal would "change the na
ture of Falklands society and so prejudge their future" by re
jecting any role for the executive and legislative councils of
the islancV 1,800 British-heritage inhabitants and then
"flooding" the Falklands with Argentine nationals.
Senate upholds budget
Washington — The Republican-controlled Senate last
night rejected a Democratic-led assault on President Rea
gan's plan for a third year of individual income tax cuts as it
beat back other Democratic efforts to restore funds for social
welfare programs in its budget for next year.
In the first test of Reagan's tax program this year in either
house of Congress, the Senate voted, 68-32, against a pro
posal by Sen. Ernest Hollings (D-S.C.) ranking Democrat on
the Senate Budget Committee, to repeal the 1983 tax cut atop
$107.2 billion in tax increases that the Senate Budget Com
mittee has proposed for the next three years.
On Hollings' proposal, 17 Democrats joined all but five Re
publicans in voting against what would amount to a tax in
crease of more than $180 billion by 1985.
Immediately after that, the Senate voted, 63-35, against a
bid by Minority Leader Robert Byrd (D-W. Va) to put the Sen
ate on record as favoring deferral of next year's tax cut as part
of the $107.2 billion in tax increases over the three-year peri
od.
The assault on the tax cut came after Democrats failed to
restore money that the committee had proposed to cut from
education, health, environmental and other programs. Also
defeated was a proposal to cut foreign aid.
Hollings' tax proposal would have added $76.3 billion to
the $107.2 billion, including $6 billion in additional user fees,
in tax increases by 1985 that the Budget Committee had pro
posed and that Republicans argued was too much for an
economy struggling out of a recession.
"I just don't believe the economy can stand that much.... I
just don't believe the American people can stand that
much," Senate Budget Committee Chairman Pete Domenici
(R-N.M.) said, noting that the total amount of the three-year
tax increase would be $183.5 billion, including the user fees.

But Hollings contended that, if it were adopted, "the
message would go out to the markets and everyone else, in
cluding (Chairman) Paul Volcker of the Federal Reserve, that
the Conggess has finally become serious about the problem"
of reducing deficits, thereby easing pressure for high interest
rates.
Hollings chided Republicans for picking up the old Demo
cratic theme that deficits do not matter. "We got run out of
office in 1980 with that kind of talk ... " Hollings said. "These
deficits do count."
But Sen. William Roth (R-Del.) one of the principal
architects of the tax cut, contended that any tampering with
the cut would "only prolong the recession." The president,
he added, "is keeping a steady course, and he is not going to
permit his program to be gutted." '
Meanwhile, the House braced for opening of debate to
day on several budget alternatives, with everyone hedging
bets and Reagan taking a low-key, backstage role, at least for
now.
OPEC debates quotas
Quito, Ecuador — OPEC's president opened the cartel's
regular spring session yesterday with a call for ending oil pro
duction quotas within "the next few weeks," despite a spe
cial committee's endorsement of the quota system earlier
this week.
Mana Saeed Oteiba, who also is the oil minister of the
United Arab Emirates, said that while oil prices have risen in
recent weeks after tumbling early this year, a complete re
covery requires more time.
Oteiba's apparent eagerness to drop the quota system
adopted at OPEC's emergency session two months ago con
flicted with the desires of some other cartel members.
Sources said Humberto Calderon Berti, the Venezuelan oil
minister, is urging that OPEC make the quotas permanent.
Earlier this week in Caracas, Venezuela, Calderon Berti
and three other ministers who form a market-monitoring
panel said they would recommend continuation of the pro
duction ceiling. They did not agree on how long itshould re
main or how output should be divided.
Sheik Ahmed Zaki Yamani, the oil ministerof Saudi Arabia,
told reporters yesterday that his country does not favor
OPEC production controls if oil prices remain stable.
Market drops again
The stock market recorded its seventh straight loss in a
drifting session yesterday.
The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials dropped 3.42 to
832.48, bringing its decline over the past seven sessions to
33.39 points.
