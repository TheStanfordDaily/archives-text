### Clay Moltz 
The hunger strike of Stanford grad
uate student Lois Becker Frolov en
ters its 12th day today following a
new turn of events, as Becker filed
suit yesterday in U.S. District Court in
Chicago against the Soviet govern
ment for damages involved in the re
fusal of the Soviets to grant her hus
band Andrei Frolov an exit visa.
Becker married Frolov, a Soviet
citizen, last May while researching
her history dissertation in Moscow.
Becker's case has the backing of
several Northwestern University law
professors who helped prepare her
case, basing their argument on nu
merous violations of international
codes on human rights. Becker told
the Daily in a telephone interview

yesterday, "People are interested in
establishing a precedent for the liti
gation of human rights cases."
The issue at stake, Becker said, is
her persecution as an American
citizen at the hands of a foreign gov
ernment. The papers filed by her per
sonal lawyer yesterday cite the Unit
ed States as a co-plaintiff and refer to
Soviet violations of specific articles in
internationally-signed agreements,
including the Declaration of Human
Rights (1948) and the Helsinki Ac
cords (1975).
The Soviet constitution, which
purports to protect families of Soviet
citizens as well as guarantee them
compensation for damages done by
state officials to families, was also
cited in the legal papers filed in Chi

cago.
In addition to personal damages,
which have been set at $1 million for
each day Frolov is detained in the So
viet Union, Becker's lawyers are seek
ing an injunction on legal grounds to
bar the Soviets from commercial
trade in the northern Illinois district,
where many of the Soviet Union's
wheat purchases are made.
The reason for naming the United
States as a co-plaintiff, Becker said, is
that according to her lawyers the U.S.
government is bound to protect its
citizens against any tort or crime
committed by a foreign state. Her
own human rights have been vio
lated, she said, by the Soviet's refusal
to grant her husband an exit visa.
Becker said that telephone com

munication with her husband ha
been cut off, but that she was able ti
speak with him yesterday morninj
the first time in a week, through
special arrangement with friend
"He says he's weak, but he'
healthy," Becker told the Daily.
On Monday night the ABC teli
vision show "Night Line" feature
the case of Frolov and three oth
hunger strikers in Moscow al
petitioning for exit visas to join th<
spouses in the West. Becker and ot
er Western spouses were i
terviewed in separate filmings.
The Moscow fasters said Mond >
that they plan to petition the Sov«
state for permission to conduct
peaceful march to the Central Co
mittee offices on june 1.
