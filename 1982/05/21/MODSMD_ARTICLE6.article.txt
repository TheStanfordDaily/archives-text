# Speakers debate disarmament option?

Whether the anti-nuclear movement should be
directed toward a freeze and reduction of nuclear
weapons, or toward total elimination of them, was
one of the issues raised in a talk titled "A Leap into
the Unknown" here Wednesday night.
The session featured a taped speech by Paul
Warnke, chief negotiator of the SALT II talks under
former President Jimmy Carter, and a speech by
Douglas Mattern, a local anti-nuclear activist.
Warnke said he felt a freeze on nuclear weap
ons, and eventual reduction, were all we could re
alistically hope to see in our lifetimes. He also said
it might never be practical to negotiate limits on
conventional weaponry.
"A Leap into the Unknown," the title of
Warnke's speech, was taken from Secretary of
State Alexander Haig's statement that to establish a
nuclear freeze would be to "exchange deterrence

for a leap into the unkrown."
But, Warnke said, it is time to take that leap. "It's
time to take the chance we still have to bring an
end to the nuclear arms race."
Warnke also took issue with Haig on the
statement that a freeze "would reward a decade of
unilateral Soviet buildup and penalize the U.S. for
a decade of unilateral restraint." He flatly con
tradicted the notion of U.S. restraint with figures
on American weapons increases including
Minuteman and MIRV missiles, as well as Polaris
submarines. It is true that the Soviets have also vast
ly increasd their arsenal, he said.
But Warnke assailed the idea that the Soviet
Union has .in edge in nuclear weaponry and the
idea that it would do either side any good to in
crease its weaponry further. "Neither side could
ever hope to gain an advantage by striking first."
He ridiculed the notion of a first strike by the So

viets. "They may be mean and tough but the
not crazy." If the Soviets decided to strike our 1
ICBM silos, Warnke said, they would need at I
two warheads to destroy each one. Keepini
mind that no missile has ever been fired with a
clear warhead and that no missile has ever b
fired in the appropriate trajectory, Warnke a<
how the Soviets could count on all of their r
than 2000 missiles to hit. Any remaining mis
would be launched at them, and those on our
marines, which cannot be targeted by Soviet
siles.
"They may not respect the territory of any <
country, but they have a deep and abiding lo\
their homeland."
All nuclear weapons are good for, Warnke
is to deter the use of nuclear weapons. "The
Ed Kingdom i< a nuclear power, but
what good does that do tnem in the
Falklands?"
Warnke's own recommendations
for a nuclear freeze include the
maintenance of present agreements,
the ratification of SALT 11, an agree
ment by both countries not to take
actions undermining the negotiatons
while they are in progress, limits on
testing and provisions for annual re
ductions of nuclear stockpiles.
In remarks following the taped
speech, Douglas Mattern, chairman
of the World Citizen's Assembly and
editor of the newspaper World
Citizen, stressed the possible role of
the United Nations in nuclear dis
armament and the role of people and
non-governmental organizations.
He also criticized Warnke's accep
tance of the concept of deterrence.
"Deterrence itself is a hopeless poli
cy. If deterrence worked, the arms
race would have ended 20 years
ago." The only possible goal, he said,
is the total elimination of nuclear
weapons.
"The only possible security is a col
lective security," Mattern said, point
ing to the growing anti-nuclear
movement in this country and in Eu
rope. "People working together can
literally force a change in their coun
try's policy."
