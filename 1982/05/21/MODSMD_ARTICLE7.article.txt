- World enter of the Baha'i Faith is in
, >To. aI (tlie site of Stanford's newest

overseas program), but Allen emphasized
that the faith is by no means limited to the
Middle East. He claimed that it is the
world's most widespread religion: "there
are Baha'is in every country, territory and
island in the world." There are approx
imately 100,000 Baha'is in the United
States, he said.
Allen noted that Baha'is feel a special re
spect for Stanford, since in 1912 Abdu'l-
Baha, the son of Baha'u'llah, visited the
United States and received an especially
warm welcome from the University and
then-President David Starr Jordan.
In contrast to many other religions,
there is no church or clergy in the Baha'i
Faith. According to Allen, this is because
today "we can all read for ourselves... We
should all investigate for ourselves ...
whether the teachings are true or not
true." Instead, Allen said Baha'is get to
gether in each others homes to read and
discuss the writings of Baha'u'llah.
In line with the goals of Baha'i Week, Al
len emphasized that for Baha'is "our phi
losophy of spreading religions is that we
provide a means of teaching people what
our teachings are about. We don't want to
pressure people, but want to share our
teachings ... We feel that they are best
lived instead of spoken about... We try to
acquire spiritual attributes here to prepare
ourselves for the next life ... We develop
the qualities of the soul through service to
one another."
Baha'is stress that all the major religions
of the world share one thing — the belief
or faith in God. They believe that roughly
every 1000 years a prophet from God
comes to the earth, and that all come from
the same God.
He admitted, however, that apparent
contradictions among religions pose a dif
ficult question for Baha'is. But as he sees it,
"mankind has been given different
teachings for different times."

Allen's wife, Angie, added that in dif
ferent times and cultures, the religion
"spiritually stays the same but socially does
not ... That's why contradictions come
up." The two agree that for Baha'is, a di
versity of cultures and of people is impor
tant and need not interfere with the spiri
tual unity of the world.
"We don't advocate the abolition of
states or governments or nations... There
will come a point where the world will be
organized on the basis of one world,"
Andy said. Though this will happen natu
rally and eventually, he qualified himself
by saying that "a lot of things will have to
happen first ... Peace in the world is
basic."
In discussing the Baha'i faith, the one
thing that especially troubled the Aliens
was the present persecution of Baha'is in
Iran, including the murders of some rela
tives of members of the Stanford com
munity.
Saba Mahanian, an Iranian graduate stu
dent who spoke on Tuesday as part of
Baha'i Week, said that to the Iranian gov
ernment, "The Baha'i faith is thought of as
a greater threat (than other religions) be
cause of its type of liberal teachings ...
equality of women, universal education,
lack of any need for a priesthood."
When asked if the Baha'is were resisting,
Mahanian said that "we are totally non
militaristic. We would never take arms
against the government."
Allen agreed that "we are peaceful peo
ple ... We believe in obeying our govern
ment ... We don't condone, but we obey.
Our only real means to end this thing in
Iran is to apply public pressure."
However, he noted that the Baha'is in
Iran could escape persecution by renounc
ing their beliefs, but this is the one order
Baha'is cannot obey: "when it comes to re
canting our faith, we put everything else
after that."

comes to the earth, and that all come from
the same God.
He admitted, however, that apparent
contradictions among religions pose a dif
ficult question for Baha'is. But as he sees it,
"mankind has been given different
teachings for different times."

Allen's wife, Angie, added that in dif
ferent times and cultures, the religion
"spiritually stays the same but socially does
not ... That's why contradictions come
up." The two agree that for Baha'is, a di
versity of cultures and of people is impor
tant and need not interfere with the spiri
tual unity of the world.
"We don't advocate the abolition of
states or governments or nations... There
will come a point where the world will be
organized on the basis of one world,"
Andy said. Though this will happen natu
rally and eventually, he qualified himself
by saying that "a lot of things will have to
happen first ... Peace in the world is
basic."
In discussing the Baha'i faith, the one
thing that especially troubled the Aliens
was the present persecution of Baha'is in
Iran, including the murders of some rela
tives of members of the Stanford com
munity.
Saba Mahanian, an Iranian graduate stu
dent who spoke on Tuesday as part of
Baha'i Week, said that to the Iranian gov
ernment, "The Baha'i faith is thought of as
a greater threat (than other religions) be
cause of its type of liberal teachings ...
equality of women, universal education,
lack of any need for a priesthood."
When asked if the Baha'is were resisting,
Mahanian said that "we are totally non
militaristic. We would never take arms
against the government."
Allen agreed that "we are peaceful peo
ple ... We believe in obeying our govern
ment ... We don't condone, but we obey.
Our only real means to end this thing in
Iran is to apply public pressure."
However, he noted that the Baha'is in
Iran could escape persecution by renounc
ing their beliefs, but this is the one order
Baha'is cannot obey: "when it comes to re
canting our faith, we put everything else
after that."

that the faith is by no means limited to the
Middle East. He claimed that it is the
world's most widespread religion: "there
are Baha'is in every country, territory and
island in the world." There are approx
imately 100,000 Baha'is in the United
States, he said.
Allen noted that Baha'is feel a special re
spect for Stanford, since in 1912 Abdu'l-
Baha, the son of Baha'u'llah, visited the
United States and received an especially
warm welcome from the University and
then-President David Starr Jordan.
In contrast to many other religions,
there is no church or clergy in the Baha'i
Faith. According to Allen, this is because
today "we can all read for ourselves... We
should all investigate for ourselves ...
whether the teachings are true or not
true." Instead, Allen said Baha'is get to
gether in each others homes to read and
discuss the writings of Baha'u'llah.
In line with the goals of Baha'i Week, Al
len emphasized that for Baha'is "our phi
losophy of spreading religions is that we
provide a means of teaching people what
our teachings are about. We don't want to
pressure people, but want to share our
teachings ... We feel that they are best
lived instead of spoken about... We try to
acquire spiritual attributes here to prepare
ourselves for the next life ... We develop
the qualities of the soul through service to
one another."
Baha'is stress that all the major religions
of the world share one thing — the belief
or faith in God. They believe that roughly
every 1000 years a prophet from God
comes to the earth, and that all come from
the same God.
