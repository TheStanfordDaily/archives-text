# THE 						STANFORD DAILY
## A 						Day at the Races 
### 
Last Sunday dawned a ster
ling crimson. Birds
cartwheeled lazily overhead. It
was a perfect day for the big
gest costume party west of New
Orleans, the 7.63 mile Bay to
Breakers run. The Bay to
Breakers has been called a cel
ebration of spring, the Woods
tock of running and a good ex
cuse to drink beer in the morn
ing. The 71st annual running
was no exception.
All sorts came out of the
woodwork on Sunday. There

was a hamburger, 10 killer feet,
an 80-foot-long Golden Gate
Bridge, Coit Tower, the
goddess Athena, her consort
the angel Gabriel, men in
top hats and tails, a woman in a
long evening gown and
thousands of other assorted
people, all obviously out to
have a blast.
The party began prompty at 8
a.m. at the corner of Howard
and Spear Streets. It was all
over just 35 minutes later for
Rod Dixon, the winner of the

men's division and 42 minutes
later for Laurie Bender, the
women's division winner. But
most didn't seem to pay much
attention to the clock. The last
entrant didn't cross the starting
line until 20 minutes into the
race. The Golden Gate Bridge
finished in two hours and 15
minutes. And by noon they had
deflated the giant beer can at
the finish.
As has been said, at the Bay
to Breakers the race may go to
the swift but the day goes to the
strays.
