## 
### Sid Spaeth 
; SaH- Lake City — Four-time All-
America Alycia Moulton of Stanford
vyrapped up a brilliant collegiate ten
nis career by winning the first NCAA
ihdivttJual women's singles title here
vyith a 4-6,6-1,6-4 win over San Diego
State's Micki Schillig yesterday.
• It was Moulton's third trip to the
Championship match and her first
win.
. "It's a tremendous relief," she said
after the match. "It's something I
wanted for myself."
Earlier in the week, Moulton led
the Stanford team to its first team
title since 1978. About 25 Stanford
students greeted the national cham
pions at San Francisco International

Airport last night.
"The team title is what I really
wanted to win," Moulton said.
"That's what college tennis is all
about. The individual thing is only ic
ing on the cake."
Moulton led 5-3 in the third set and
was serving for the match, but No. 7
seed Schillig had broken Moulton's
intimidating serve seven times. After
falling behind 1-3 (no-add scoring)
on three Schillig winners, Moulton
battled back to a 3-all match point.
Schillig put Moulton on the run and
when a lunging Moulton hit a fore
hand only a fraction of an inch long,
she threw down her racket in disgust.
"I was frustrated," Moulton ex
plained. "I thought I had let my only

chance go by."
Schillig then had the serve to tie,
but had held her serve only once
since the first set. The game went to
3-all for the tenth time and when
Schillig hit a forehand wide, Moulton
had completed the cycle of col
legiate tennis championships — sin
gles, doubles and team.
"I wanted to win it for myself,"
Moulton said. "But when she missed
it, it counted the same."
Moulton won seven of ten 3-all
games in the sloppily-served match
played at the Canyon Racquet Club
in front of 500 spectators and a na
tional cable television audience.
