## Energy values clarification 
### 
When it comes to energy my basic philosophy is there
has never been, is not now and never will be an energy
source that is cheap, safe and environmentally benign,
yet all forms of energy produce many benefits along with
their undesirable by-products. The decisions we have to
make are thus not which forms of energy are safe, or are
ecologically sound, for none are, but which forms of
energy best fit their users' priorities on safety, economy,
ecology and lifestyle.
While these decisions should not be left to engineers
and scientists, these people should continue making
each source of energy more acceptable to more mem
bers of the public. I» is up to each person to decide
whether a certain energy process is or is not compatible
with his or her values. These types of research and de
cision-making require unbiased funding and informa
tion; this should be the Department of Energy's (DOE)
most important role in our society.
Let me now defend my statement of basic philosophy.
You name the type of energy, and I'll tell you its draw
backs.
Nuclear. I like to think I am beyond the my-mind's
made-up-don't-confuse-me-with-the-facts attitude that
typifies both sides of the nuclear power debate, but I
think it's safe to say nuclear power produces radioactive
wastes that are not environmentally benign. Permanent
storage facilities for these wastes do not exist today.
Coal. If nuclear power is unhealthy, coal is murderous
ly dangerous. Last year 153 coal miners died in accidents.
Another 150 or so people were killed in coal train acci
dents. Last year taxpayers forked out $1 billion to miners
suffering from Black Lung disease. And then you can talk
about what happens after the coal is burned. Not ev
eryone agrees on how bad coal-produced air pollution
is, but no one claims pollution is good for you.
Oil. It is not cheap, and our lack of domestic resources
put a big strain on the economy. Additionally, you only
have to run to the Dish to see what burning large
amounts of hydrocarbons does to the atmosphere. On a
clear day you can see Hayward.
Solar. I may be barred from the Sierra Club for saying
this, but solar energy is not environmentally benign. The
sun's energy is not very intense, andooru r ability to con
vert its energy into usable forms isn't very good. Thus
you need a lot of collectors to do a job. These collectors
do not grow on trees. They are made of materials that
must be mined and milled. The mines scar the earth, and
the mills pollute the air. Also, solar is not cheap. If it were
we wouldn't need 40 percent tax credits to create a mar
ket. Solar energy is a rich man's energy.
Wood. Wood is a solar energy collector that does grow
on trees. Unfortunately, you have to cut down the tree to
use it. Also, any camper knows wood fires pollute the air;
especially ones built by average Joes who know nothing
about pollution-controlling combustion techniques.
Hydro. Dams create lakes that disrupt the existing en
vironment. Dams can also be dangerous. In 1971 we
almost lost Los Angela An earthquake cracked a dam

above the San Fernando Valley. Luckily, demand for
electricity had lowered the water level to a point that the
dam held. Had the quake come along a few months
before, Al Davis might not have any reason to move his
Raiders to Lotus Land.
Conservation. I really had to think hard on this one be
cause true conservation, as I define it, means getting the
same job accomplished while using less energy. This
doesn't mean "doing without," which can definitely be
dangerous — you can freeze to death. Still, true con
servation requires materials, though usually not as much
as solar to accomplish the same job, and these materials
(e.g., fiberglass or a leather jacket) don't grow on trees.
Also, if you've priced storm windows lately you know
these materials are not cheap. They require a substantial
initial investment which many can't afford.
This brings up my second point. If you search hard
enough you can find something bad about conversation,
but I doubt you could find anyone who would argue that
the negative aspects are unacceptable. For one thing,
look at all the negative impacts you displace if you re
duce the need to mine and burn coal. All forms of energy
must be judged along this line. Even though every per
son will have different standards depending on their
priorities, it is important that each use consistent stan
dards in judging the acceptability of different energy
forms.
For example, it seems inconsistent to me to demand
death-free nuclear energy while not even blinking an
eye at 150 coal mining deaths a year. It is understandable
that people will be less likely to accept new risks such as
low level radiation from the nuclear fuel cycle than to ac
cept old ones such as coal mine exposions, but if we insist
on using different standards in our decisions the energy
mix we end up with will not be optimal.
Government sponsored energy research should be
aimed at reducing the negative aspects of each energy
form. Using this as a guidepoint I would direct the major
effort in nuclear research toward developing a long
term storage technique for the wastes that have already
been created. We must not forge ahead on new schemes
such as the breeder reactor until the waste problem is re
solved. This will not be an easy task — because the oppo
nents of nuclear power will find fault with any storage
proposal — for it will be seen as an attempt to promote
an immoral form of energy. I feel it is far more immoral to
allow the already existing wastes (much of which is de
rived from military weapons programs) to sit around in
temporary containers which have been known to leak.
Even if we shut down nuclear power tomorrow this must
be done.
We must work toward understanding and reducing
the health risks of low level radiation and combustion
derived pollutants.
We must support work aimed at reducing the cost of
solar energy and conservation or at least include in their
price tags the cost of subsidizing those who can't afford
capital intensive schemes.
The DOE should also make information on the
negative impacts of different energy forms available to
the public rather than relying on Ralph Nader and Mobil
to provide us with unbiased facts.
If DOE is used in this matter, I have confidence both
the marketplace of ideas and of dollars will then provide
us with a mix of energy sources that gives an optimal fit to
our values and priorities.
