## Passing judgment: defining the art of good sculpture taste 
### 
In recent years, a number of works
of outdoor art have sprung up on the
campus that have achieved less than
popular acclaim. A recurring ele
ment in the ensuing debate has been
to label those that did not appreciate
them "sophomoric," "anti-intellec
tual" or "sure to regret their dumb
opposition later." Implicit in this is
the assumption that the taste of some
is better than that of others, that
those with presumed better tastes
have the right to impose it on others
and that there are certain professions
or skills, such as professor of arts or li
brary specialist, that entitle the
holder to be more correct in their

views on art than are those who do
not share them. If one does not like
the wall in front of the Physics Tank,
or the metal tubes recently appeared
on the lawn near Meyer Library, one
is by fiat uncultured, ignorant or just
generally a nuisance. I do not like
either and find myself offended ev
ery time I pass them. My pleasure in
the campus landscape has been defi
nitely diminished by their ap
pearance.
Yet I do not accept that this dem
bnstrates that my judgment of art and
my tastes are inferior. With equal
right I could state that those that like
what seems to me visual pollution

have inferior judgment, no matter
who they may be. That sort of thing
does not promote a reasonable de
bate nor better understanding of
modern art. The real issue is whether
a group, small or large, has the right
to impose their taste on the rest of us,
whether we be a large or a small
group. I do not like the taste of what
ever committee decides these things.
Do they have the unique right to dec
orate the campus with whatever
pleases them?
It seems they do, but that is, I sub
mit, unacceptable â€” even though
the difficulty of deciding on public
art by any other means is admittedly
great. Perhaps we oughta work for a
more balanced selection committee.

Mephisto misjudged
After having suffered through two
years' worth of inadequate movie re
views in which Steve Vineberg plays
God, I must protest his latest critique
of Mephisto. In addition to his un
even style and slack organization,
Vineberg vacillates between blanket
comments and esoteric drivel. For
example, the comment"... it isn't a
very good movie," forces me to say
that any critic of substance knows
that criteria such as good and bad are
so general as to be almost useless.
With so complex a medium as film,
one must specify particular elements
when critiquing.
Vineberg later complains that "We
are never allowed to be swept away."
Could it be that the director does not
wish us to be swept away but desires
instead that we assume a critical dis
tance? The Faust myth, long a staple
European conception, is too com
plex and subtle to be dealt with in the
same manner as Breaking Away or
Rocky.
His last paragraph focuses on de
tails of the film without summarizing
general themes, leaving me with little
feel for the movie. It ends with the
statement "She might be a refugee
from a Fassbinder movie." While I
appreciate Vineberg's attempt to
stimulate intellectually the Stanford
community, esoteric comments such
as these are inaccessible and thus
almost meaningless to most readers.
If, in the future, Vineberg feels less
need to flex his mental muscle, be
gins to appreciate the aesthetic back

ground of particular works, and,
most importantly, understands the
needs of his readers, then he might
well be able to write effective film
criticism.

Monstrous effort
The sculpture recently erected be
tween the bookstore and Meyer Li
brary is, in my opinion, a monstrosity.
I am sure that much effort was ex
tended in creating this structure, and
I am sympathetic. In fact, I rather
think it could be effective in an urban
setting. However, I find this
haphazard bundle of metal offensive
in the living green landscape in
which it has been placed.
Perhaps few share my opinion. But
I question the fairness of the adminis
trative procedure allowing, without
warning, permanent installation of a
useless structure so disharmonious
with the general character of Stan
ford's landscape.
