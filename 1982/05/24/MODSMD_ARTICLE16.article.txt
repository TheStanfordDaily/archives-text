## 'Loan trap' set for non-registrants? 
### 
Washington — Congress is one
step away from turning an embattled
student loan program into little more
than a latter-day corollary of the Gl
Bill.
Last week, late one day, the Senate
rushed through an amendment to
the Pentagon budget bill requiring
student aid applicants, as of Oct. 1, to
prove that they've registered with
the Selective Service System. Within
the next 10 days, Rep. Gerald
Solomon (R.-N.Y.) is expected to of
fer a similar amendment to the De
fense Department Authorization bill
in the House.
Oddly enough, there had never
been any congressional hearings or
debate on the student aid-regis
tration link before Sen. S.I. "Sleepy
Sam" Hayakawa (R-Calif.) in
troduced Amendment 1441 on the

Senate floor. Nonetheless, it passed
unanimously.
For the record, the Selective Ser
vice System, which admits to falling
550,000 names short in its two-year
roundup of registration-age men,
called the Hayakawa amendment a
surprise. Indeed, judging from the
10-minute floor debate, senators
seem to have been swept away by the
simple principle of the 17th-century
political theorist John Locke: with
every right in society comes an ac
companying responsibility.
Of course, the notion of a social
contract between citizen and state is
as sacred and relevant in 1982 as in
Locke's heyday. But by invoking
Locke in approving the Hayakawa
amendment, the Senate has badly
abused a great principle.
To begin with, the new "eligibility
requirements" would, if enacted,
place the burden of proof on the stu
dent, not the government. If, accord
ing to Hayakawa, "any applicant for
educational assistance must provide
certification of his registration to the
Secretary of Education," the rule pre
sumes guilt before innocence.
Napoleonic in letter and spirit, the
measure runs counter to the tradi
tions of our nation's criminal justice
system.
But that's not all. Equally unfair is
the disproportionate effect the
amendment would have on middle
cl«3s draft-age men. Those who can
pay their way through college would
slip through the dragnet; similarly,
those who don't go to college would
be unaffected. Observed Sen. David
Durenberger (R-Minn.), the lone
senator to speak against the amend
ment (in absentia), "The effect ...
would be to draw artificial distinc
tions among a common class of law
breakers when no distinctions
should be drawn."
The Senate seems to have for
gotten that the Military Selective Ser
vice Act already stipulates harsh pen
alties for young men who fail to reg
ister within 30 days of their 18th birth
day. If Congress believes, as the Rea
gan administration apparently does,
that it is too expensive — if not im
possible — to fine or imprison half a
million non-registrants, lawmakers

should consider revising the law.
Rep. Les Aspin (D-Wis.) has offered
legislation (HR 5940) which would
make non-registration a misde
meanor, punishable by a $200 fine
levied administratively (the current
$10,000 fine is levied through the
courts). Whether or not Aspin's
decriminalization is viable, his bill
has bearing on last week's shanigans:
if the law's bad, rewrite it. Two
wrongs don't make a right.
Other House Democrats, led by
New York's Ted Weiss and Peter
Peyser, are honing arguments in an
ticipation of Solorpon's likely
amendment. Unlike their coujy, v
terparts in the Senate, opponents in
the House seem aware that there is
no necessary link between the "right
to an education" and the "responsi
bility to serve one's country." Re
gardless what one thinks of military
obligation today, student aid has
nothing to do with it.
There are two ironies at work here.
First, the White House and the Selec
tive Service System (SSS) have been
stumped on how to quietly dispose
of the non-registrant problem in an
election year. Though Congress au
thorized the possibility last summer,
the SSS has been wary of asking Presi
dent Ronald Reagan for permission
to flush out non-registrants through
Social Security computer files. Un
doubtedly, the administration would
rather avoid the inevitable criticism
that such an invasion of privacy might
engendei. Ironically, it may now be
more difficult for the administration
to play safe should the student loan
cross-check meet with congressional
approval.
The second irony is merely symbol
ic. Within the last year, the Selective
Service and "Sallie Mae," the Stu
dent Loan Marketing Association,
have moved into back-to-back office
buildings along the restored
Chesapeake and Ohio Canal in fash
ionable Georgetown. As new neigh
bors set in bricks and mortar, will one
federal agency become the enforce
ment arm of another?

surprise. Indeed, judging from the
10-minute floor debate, senators
seem to have been swept away by the
simple principle of the 17th-century
political theorist John Locke: with
every right in society comes an ac
companying responsibility.
Of course, the notion of a social
contract between citizen and state is
as sacred and relevant in 1982 as in
Locke's heyday. But by invoking
Locke in approving the Hayakawa
amendment, the Senate has badly
abused a great principle.
To begin with, the new "eligibility
requirements" would, if enacted,
place the burden of proof on the stu
dent, not the government. If, accord
ing to Hayakawa, "any applicant for
educational assistance must provide
certification of his registration to the
Secretary of Education," the rule pre
sumes guilt before innocence.
Napoleonic in letter and spirit, the
measure runs counter to the tradi
tions of our nation's criminal justice
system.
But that's not all. Equally unfair is
the disproportionate effect the
amendment would have on middle
cl«3s draft-age men. Those who can
pay their way through college would
slip through the dragnet; similarly,
those who don't go to college would
be unaffected. Observed Sen. David
Durenberger (R-Minn.), the lone
senator to speak against the amend
ment (in absentia), "The effect ...
would be to draw artificial distinc
tions among a common class of law
breakers when no distinctions
should be drawn."
The Senate seems to have for
gotten that the Military Selective Ser
vice Act already stipulates harsh pen
alties for young men who fail to reg
ister within 30 days of their 18th birth
day. If Congress believes, as the Rea
gan administration apparently does,
that it is too expensive — if not im
possible — to fine or imprison half a
million non-registrants, lawmakers

should consider revising the law.
Rep. Les Aspin (D-Wis.) has offered
legislation (HR 5940) which would
make non-registration a misde
meanor, punishable by a $200 fine
levied administratively (the current
$10,000 fine is levied through the
courts). Whether or not Aspin's
decriminalization is viable, his bill
has bearing on last week's shanigans:
if the law's bad, rewrite it. Two
wrongs don't make a right.
Other House Democrats, led by
New York's Ted Weiss and Peter
Peyser, are honing arguments in an
ticipation of Solorpon's likely
amendment. Unlike their coujy, v
terparts in the Senate, opponents in
the House seem aware that there is
no necessary link between the "right
to an education" and the "responsi
bility to serve one's country." Re
gardless what one thinks of military
obligation today, student aid has
nothing to do with it.
There are two ironies at work here.
First, the White House and the Selec
tive Service System (SSS) have been
stumped on how to quietly dispose
of the non-registrant problem in an
election year. Though Congress au
thorized the possibility last summer,
the SSS has been wary of asking Presi
dent Ronald Reagan for permission
to flush out non-registrants through
Social Security computer files. Un
doubtedly, the administration would
rather avoid the inevitable criticism
that such an invasion of privacy might
engendei. Ironically, it may now be
more difficult for the administration
to play safe should the student loan
cross-check meet with congressional
approval.
The second irony is merely symbol
ic. Within the last year, the Selective
Service and "Sallie Mae," the Stu
dent Loan Marketing Association,
have moved into back-to-back office
buildings along the restored
Chesapeake and Ohio Canal in fash
ionable Georgetown. As new neigh
bors set in bricks and mortar, will one
federal agency become the enforce
ment arm of another?

Washington — Congress is one
step away from turning an embattled
student loan program into little more
than a latter-day corollary of the Gl
Bill.
Last week, late one day, the Senate
rushed through an amendment to
the Pentagon budget bill requiring
student aid applicants, as of Oct. 1, to
prove that they've registered with
the Selective Service System. Within
the next 10 days, Rep. Gerald
Solomon (R.-N.Y.) is expected to of
fer a similar amendment to the De
fense Department Authorization bill
in the House.
Oddly enough, there had never
been any congressional hearings or
debate on the student aid-regis
tration link before Sen. S.I. "Sleepy
Sam" Hayakawa (R-Calif.) in
troduced Amendment 1441 on the

Senate floor. Nonetheless, it passed
unanimously.
For the record, the Selective Ser
vice System, which admits to falling
550,000 names short in its two-year
roundup of registration-age men,
called the Hayakawa amendment a
surprise. Indeed, judging from the
10-minute floor debate, senators
seem to have been swept away by the
simple principle of the 17th-century
political theorist John Locke: with
