# Friendship — taking, making, time to be a friend
## 
### Tom Brennan 
New students at Stanford are met with a
myriad of opportunities when they arrive.
However, each opportunity may also bring a
set of problems as well: such is the case when
meeting, making and maintaining friends
during four years here.
The freshman dormitories provide an un
usual opportunity to meet and observe peo
ple on an informal and continuous basis.
"You are immersed in day to day life with
your good friends. You can see them
throughout the day, and you can live with
them. Never again will we have that ex
perience when we leave here, so you can de
velop lasting friendships/' said Mariann
Byerwalter, an RA at Branner for the last two
years.
Additionally, the freshman dorms are
composed of a cross section of students from
the class, as a result, from several dif
ferent racial, ethnic and cultural back
ground. Consequently, many students may
be exposed to groups they never before
have encountered. "Branner has 10 percent
of the entire freshman class, and so you are
going to get a sampling of every single back
ground that is represented by the class —
pitting a cross section of the student popu
lation together in a dorm is probably the

most important interaction they have with
other people," Byerwalter commented.
However, after the freshman year, when
many close friendships are made, the
dormitories may no longer provide the op
portunity to meet people as easily because
students become more autonomous and
comfortable with other social activities.
Some students may be presented with so
many parties and other events that it be
comes difficult to choose which and how
many activities to participate in. "I find that
school is a very unordinary place in that
planning is totally out of the window — you
just don't plan things; so your social life has
kind of an organized aspect to it," said senior
John Schulberg. "I think in the outside world
you see your need for friendship much more
easily and, therefore, you seek remedies for
it. While here ... the fact that there are peo
ple around makes you not seek out real close
friends."
Parties on campus may not provide a com
fortable chance to meet new people. "You
don't meet new friends at parties. You go to
parties here to see people you already
know," said one senior.
For women, sororities are a popular way to
meet other women and get together on a
regular basis. "I find it hard to meet women
on campus," said junior Lori Alborn. "You
only meet a limited number in the dorms, so
I found it to be helpful to join a sorority and
have a group of girls to get to know."
The most obvious place to meet people —
the classroom — is often not utilized due to
the large size of most classes. It is often the
third or fourth year here before students are
able to get to know one another on a person-
Si basis as class sizes decrease. "Only in my
later years when I'm in smaller classes am I
finally getting to know people next to me
personally because there are nine of us in an
English class. The classrooms which probably
most generally are the easiest place to meet
people and feel comfortable are so big that
you don't talk to people after class,"
Schulberg said.
Once students have accumulated a group
of friends at Stanford, many of the rela
tionships are strained by the pressures of ac
ademic life and extracurricular activities also
demanding time. Under these circum
stances, time for friends may be limited. "It's
hard to reach a balance. It's one of the prob
lems that you have when you first get here
when you're a freshman, trying to balance all
those things — you can either swing one way
or the other. It comes down to priorities —
which activities you really want to do. A

problem with being at a place like Stanford is
that, unless you're really interested in doing
something, you won't just go do something
for the heck of it," Alborn said.
As a result of time pressures, people here
face a dilemma with respect to getting ev
erything done and still maintaining friend
ships. Limiting the number of new friends by
spending time only with a small group of
people is a possibility, but that alternative
was viewed by many as unpopular. Students
interviewed generally prefer and see advan
tages to having a large mixture of friends
each with different interests as a more satis
fying alternative — taking advantage of the
variety of people attending Stanford.

However, with a large number of friends
and limited free time, the opportunity for a
large number of close friendships seems im
possible. "People feel they have just so much
to worry about with classes that they don't
want to get too close to people and find out
they have problems — they don't want to
have anything mroe to worry about," said
junior Jane Padwick.
Frustrated by having so many acquain
tances in the dorm and in classes, some peo
ple feel lonely because they are unable to
have very close friends. "I think it's that
question of actively choosing to see your
friends, which somehow at Stanford is
played down," Schulberg said. "It is a casual
setting, and you don't say, 'Let's definitely
get together next Tuesday. I really want to
see you.' Instead, you see each other, and

you say, 'Well, great we've got to do some
thing sometime.' Then you come home, and
you see another friend, and he says, 'Do you
want to go somewhere?' Then you see an
other person, and she says, 'I'm ordering a
pizza' or something. The laxity prevents peo
ple from realizing the importance of friend
ship. You feel more lonely in a big city than
in a small town. I wouldn't call Stanford a big
city, but I would call it a suburb where peo
ple lead separate lives."
Another barrier to close friendships noted
is the instability of campus life: people go
overseas, change residences, stop out and
graduate each quarter, and the physical sep
aration can fade friendships. "It's a transient

environment, and it's just unfortunate be
cause people will establish these gieat
friendships and then move on, but I think
that happens with any friendship,"
Byerwalter commented.
Solutions to the problems of maintaining
friendships are as varied as the personalities
of the people attending Stanford. When
confronting the problem of balancing
schoolwork and friendships, one senior said,
"I blow things off mainly, to tell you the
honest truth." Sometimes, however,
classwork can be especially heavy during a
quarter, and so studying can't be put off.
"When you don't have time for a quarter or
two, my friends understand .. . you don't
lose people for not spending time with
them," she added.
Other students choose to schedule

carefully their activities and they may have to
limit time spent with friends. "You really
don't make an effort to go over and visit
some people, whereas, others you do. You
have to limit something in order to get it all
done," Alborn said.
Time pressures on people here that cause
their meetings with other students to be in
frequent and hurried can often be remedied
by additional non-student friends who are
both on and off campus. "I have friends that
are off campus, on campus, professors and
people in the City. I have a network of
friends that are different, and I go to those
people for different things," Schulberg said.
Friends who are not students can be reassur
ing because they are not confronting the
same pressures and demands and, therefore,
they give a student a better perspective on
college life.
Student organizations on campus also of
fer people the opportunity to meet and
maintain friendships on a regular basis.
Working together on a project or for a com
mon cause can create meaningful friend
ships. "There are over 300 student organiza
tions, and that puts you in with a whole dif
ferent group of people (than those in the
dorm)," Byerwalter said.
The Bridge, the student peer counseling
center on campus, is always available to deal
with problems concerning friendships. For
example, a counselor can be helpful as a me
diator in a dispute between two friends who
are unable to resolve a problem and who
would like to have a neutral party to listen to
and advise them.
Counselors also mention alternatives that
the student may not have considered. For
example, when confronting the problem of
balancing schoolwork and friends, senior
Mukti Khanna said, "one way of doing it is
just to go to the library — there's no reason
why you have to go alone — go to the bot
tom-most stack of Green, and lock yourself
away."
The Bridge also sponsors workshops so
that people can meet other students and get
involved in an activity like yoga or hypnosis 4
Also, a list of places to go on and off campus
is posted at the Bridge so that students have
an opportunity to meet and interact with
new people and have a change of pace from
their regular routines.
Friendships at Stanford share some com
mon problems as well as opportunities with
friendships elsewhere. Though there are dis
advantages, Stanford relationships also offer
unique advantages known only to college
life.

face a dilemma with respect to getting ev
erything done and still maintaining friend
ships. Limiting the number of new friends by
spending time only with a small group of
people is a possibility, but that alternative
was viewed by many as unpopular. Students
interviewed generally prefer and see advan
tages to having a large mixture of friends
each with different interests as a more satis
fying alternative — taking advantage of the
variety of people attending Stanford.

However, with a large number of friends
and limited free time, the opportunity for a
large number of close friendships seems im
possible. "People feel they have just so much
to worry about with classes that they don't
want to get too close to people and find out
they have problems — they don't want to
have anything mroe to worry about," said
junior Jane Padwick.
Frustrated by having so many acquain
tances in the dorm and in classes, some peo
ple feel lonely because they are unable to
have very close friends. "I think it's that
question of actively choosing to see your
friends, which somehow at Stanford is
played down," Schulberg said. "It is a casual
setting, and you don't say, 'Let's definitely
get together next Tuesday. I really want to
see you.' Instead, you see each other, and

you say, 'Well, great we've got to do some
thing sometime.' Then you come home, and
you see another friend, and he says, 'Do you
want to go somewhere?' Then you see an
other person, and she says, 'I'm ordering a
pizza' or something. The laxity prevents peo
ple from realizing the importance of friend
ship. You feel more lonely in a big city than
in a small town. I wouldn't call Stanford a big
city, but I would call it a suburb where peo
ple lead separate lives."
Another barrier to close friendships noted
is the instability of campus life: people go
overseas, change residences, stop out and
graduate each quarter, and the physical sep
aration can fade friendships. "It's a transient

environment, and it's just unfortunate be
cause people will establish these gieat
friendships and then move on, but I think
that happens with any friendship,"
Byerwalter commented.
Solutions to the problems of maintaining
friendships are as varied as the personalities
of the people attending Stanford. When
confronting the problem of balancing
schoolwork and friendships, one senior said,
"I blow things off mainly, to tell you the
honest truth." Sometimes, however,
classwork can be especially heavy during a
quarter, and so studying can't be put off.
"When you don't have time for a quarter or
two, my friends understand .. . you don't
lose people for not spending time with
them," she added.
Other students choose to schedule

carefully their activities and they may have to
limit time spent with friends. "You really
don't make an effort to go over and visit
some people, whereas, others you do. You
have to limit something in order to get it all
done," Alborn said.
Time pressures on people here that cause
their meetings with other students to be in
frequent and hurried can often be remedied
by additional non-student friends who are
both on and off campus. "I have friends that
are off campus, on campus, professors and
people in the City. I have a network of
friends that are different, and I go to those
people for different things," Schulberg said.
Friends who are not students can be reassur
ing because they are not confronting the
same pressures and demands and, therefore,
they give a student a better perspective on
college life.
Student organizations on campus also of
fer people the opportunity to meet and
maintain friendships on a regular basis.
Working together on a project or for a com
mon cause can create meaningful friend
ships. "There are over 300 student organiza
tions, and that puts you in with a whole dif
ferent group of people (than those in the
dorm)," Byerwalter said.
The Bridge, the student peer counseling
center on campus, is always available to deal
with problems concerning friendships. For
example, a counselor can be helpful as a me
diator in a dispute between two friends who
are unable to resolve a problem and who
would like to have a neutral party to listen to
and advise them.
Counselors also mention alternatives that
the student may not have considered. For
example, when confronting the problem of
balancing schoolwork and friends, senior
Mukti Khanna said, "one way of doing it is
just to go to the library — there's no reason
why you have to go alone — go to the bot
tom-most stack of Green, and lock yourself
away."
The Bridge also sponsors workshops so
that people can meet other students and get
involved in an activity like yoga or hypnosis 4
Also, a list of places to go on and off campus
is posted at the Bridge so that students have
an opportunity to meet and interact with
new people and have a change of pace from
their regular routines.
Friendships at Stanford share some com
mon problems as well as opportunities with
friendships elsewhere. Though there are dis
advantages, Stanford relationships also offer
unique advantages known only to college
life.

CAMPUS STROLL — (From left to right) Juniors Dave Luth, Chris Mesa and Bob
Buika find time to exchange the latest on their way across campus.
New students at Stanford are met with a
myriad of opportunities when they arrive.
However, each opportunity may also bring a
set of problems as well: such is the case when
meeting, making and maintaining friends
during four years here.
The freshman dormitories provide an un
usual opportunity to meet and observe peo
ple on an informal and continuous basis.
"You are immersed in day to day life with
your good friends. You can see them
throughout the day, and you can live with
them. Never again will we have that ex
perience when we leave here, so you can de
velop lasting friendships/' said Mariann
Byerwalter, an RA at Branner for the last two
years.
Additionally, the freshman dorms are
composed of a cross section of students from
the class, as a result, from several dif
ferent racial, ethnic and cultural back
ground. Consequently, many students may
be exposed to groups they never before
have encountered. "Branner has 10 percent
of the entire freshman class, and so you are
going to get a sampling of every single back
ground that is represented by the class —
pitting a cross section of the student popu
lation together in a dorm is probably the

most important interaction they have with
other people," Byerwalter commented.
However, after the freshman year, when
many close friendships are made, the
dormitories may no longer provide the op
portunity to meet people as easily because
students become more autonomous and
comfortable with other social activities.
Some students may be presented with so
many parties and other events that it be
comes difficult to choose which and how
many activities to participate in. "I find that
school is a very unordinary place in that
planning is totally out of the window — you
just don't plan things; so your social life has
kind of an organized aspect to it," said senior
John Schulberg. "I think in the outside world
you see your need for friendship much more
easily and, therefore, you seek remedies for
it. While here ... the fact that there are peo
ple around makes you not seek out real close
friends."
Parties on campus may not provide a com
fortable chance to meet new people. "You
don't meet new friends at parties. You go to
parties here to see people you already
know," said one senior.
For women, sororities are a popular way to
meet other women and get together on a
regular basis. "I find it hard to meet women
on campus," said junior Lori Alborn. "You
only meet a limited number in the dorms, so
I found it to be helpful to join a sorority and
have a group of girls to get to know."
The most obvious place to meet people —
the classroom — is often not utilized due to
the large size of most classes. It is often the
third or fourth year here before students are
able to get to know one another on a person-
Si basis as class sizes decrease. "Only in my
later years when I'm in smaller classes am I
finally getting to know people next to me
personally because there are nine of us in an
English class. The classrooms which probably
most generally are the easiest place to meet
people and feel comfortable are so big that
you don't talk to people after class,"
Schulberg said.
Once students have accumulated a group
of friends at Stanford, many of the rela
tionships are strained by the pressures of ac
ademic life and extracurricular activities also
demanding time. Under these circum
stances, time for friends may be limited. "It's
hard to reach a balance. It's one of the prob
lems that you have when you first get here
when you're a freshman, trying to balance all
those things — you can either swing one way
or the other. It comes down to priorities —
which activities you really want to do. A

problem with being at a place like Stanford is
that, unless you're really interested in doing
something, you won't just go do something
for the heck of it," Alborn said.
As a result of time pressures, people here
face a dilemma with respect to getting ev

center on campus, is always available to deal
with problems concerning friendships. For
example, a counselor can be helpful as a me
diator in a dispute between two friends who
are unable to resolve a problem and who
would like to have a neutral party to listen to
and advise them.
Counselors also mention alternatives that
the student may not have considered. For
example, when confronting the problem of
balancing schoolwork and friends, senior
Mukti Khanna said, "one way of doing it is
just to go to the library — there's no reason
why you have to go alone — go to the bot
tom-most stack of Green, and lock yourself
away."
The Bridge also sponsors workshops so
that people can meet other students and get
involved in an activity like yoga or hypnosis 4
Also, a list of places to go on and off campus
is posted at the Bridge so that students have
an opportunity to meet and interact with
new people and have a change of pace from
their regular routines.
Friendships at Stanford share some com
mon problems as well as opportunities with
friendships elsewhere. Though there are dis
advantages, Stanford relationships also offer
unique advantages known only to college
life.

CAMPUS STROLL — (From left to right) Juniors Dave Luth, Chris Mesa and Bob
Buika find time to exchange the latest on their way across campus.
New students at Stanford are met with a
myriad of opportunities when they arrive.
However, each opportunity may also bring a
set of problems as well: such is the case when
meeting, making and maintaining friends
during four years here.
The freshman dormitories provide an un
usual opportunity to meet and observe peo
ple on an informal and continuous basis.
"You are immersed in day to day life with
your good friends. You can see them
throughout the day, and you can live with
them. Never again will we have that ex
perience when we leave here, so you can de
velop lasting friendships/' said Mariann
Byerwalter, an RA at Branner for the last two
years.
Additionally, the freshman dorms are
composed of a cross section of students from
the class, as a result, from several dif
ferent racial, ethnic and cultural back
ground. Consequently, many students may
be exposed to groups they never before
have encountered. "Branner has 10 percent
of the entire freshman class, and so you are
going to get a sampling of every single back
ground that is represented by the class —
pitting a cross section of the student popu
lation together in a dorm is probably the

most important interaction they have with
other people," Byerwalter commented.
However, after the freshman year, when
many close friendships are made, the
dormitories may no longer provide the op
portunity to meet people as easily because
students become more autonomous and
comfortable with other social activities.
Some students may be presented with so
many parties and other events that it be
comes difficult to choose which and how
many activities to participate in. "I find that
school is a very unordinary place in that
planning is totally out of the window — you
just don't plan things; so your social life has
kind of an organized aspect to it," said senior
John Schulberg. "I think in the outside world
you see your need for friendship much more
easily and, therefore, you seek remedies for
it. While here ... the fact that there are peo
ple around makes you not seek out real close
friends."
Parties on campus may not provide a com
fortable chance to meet new people. "You
don't meet new friends at parties. You go to
parties here to see people you already
know," said one senior.
For women, sororities are a popular way to
meet other women and get together on a
regular basis. "I find it hard to meet women
on campus," said junior Lori Alborn. "You
only meet a limited number in the dorms, so
I found it to be helpful to join a sorority and
have a group of girls to get to know."
The most obvious place to meet people —
the classroom — is often not utilized due to
the large size of most classes. It is often the
third or fourth year here before students are
able to get to know one another on a person-
Si basis as class sizes decrease. "Only in my
later years when I'm in smaller classes am I
finally getting to know people next to me
personally because there are nine of us in an
English class. The classrooms which probably
most generally are the easiest place to meet
people and feel comfortable are so big that
you don't talk to people after class,"
Schulberg said.
Once students have accumulated a group
of friends at Stanford, many of the rela
tionships are strained by the pressures of ac
ademic life and extracurricular activities also
demanding time. Under these circum
stances, time for friends may be limited. "It's
hard to reach a balance. It's one of the prob
lems that you have when you first get here
when you're a freshman, trying to balance all
those things — you can either swing one way
or the other. It comes down to priorities —
which activities you really want to do. A

problem with being at a place like Stanford is
that, unless you're really interested in doing
something, you won't just go do something
for the heck of it," Alborn said.
As a result of time pressures, people here
face a dilemma with respect to getting ev
erything done and still maintaining friend
ships. Limiting the number of new friends by
spending time only with a small group of
people is a possibility, but that alternative
was viewed by many as unpopular. Students
interviewed generally prefer and see advan
tages to having a large mixture of friends
each with different interests as a more satis
fying alternative — taking advantage of the
variety of people attending Stanford.

However, with a large number of friends
and limited free time, the opportunity for a
large number of close friendships seems im
possible. "People feel they have just so much
to worry about with classes that they don't
want to get too close to people and find out
they have problems — they don't want to
have anything mroe to worry about," said
junior Jane Padwick.
Frustrated by having so many acquain
tances in the dorm and in classes, some peo
ple feel lonely because they are unable to
have very close friends. "I think it's that
question of actively choosing to see your
friends, which somehow at Stanford is
played down," Schulberg said. "It is a casual
setting, and you don't say, 'Let's definitely
get together next Tuesday. I really want to
see you.' Instead, you see each other, and

you say, 'Well, great we've got to do some
thing sometime.' Then you come home, and
you see another friend, and he says, 'Do you
want to go somewhere?' Then you see an
other person, and she says, 'I'm ordering a
pizza' or something. The laxity prevents peo
ple from realizing the importance of friend
ship. You feel more lonely in a big city than
in a small town. I wouldn't call Stanford a big
city, but I would call it a suburb where peo
ple lead separate lives."
Another barrier to close friendships noted
is the instability of campus life: people go
overseas, change residences, stop out and
graduate each quarter, and the physical sep
aration can fade friendships. "It's a transient

environment, and it's just unfortunate be
cause people will establish these gieat
friendships and then move on, but I think
that happens with any friendship,"
Byerwalter commented.
Solutions to the problems of maintaining
friendships are as varied as the personalities
of the people attending Stanford. When
confronting the problem of balancing
schoolwork and friendships, one senior said,
"I blow things off mainly, to tell you the
honest truth." Sometimes, however,
classwork can be especially heavy during a
quarter, and so studying can't be put off.
"When you don't have time for a quarter or
two, my friends understand .. . you don't
lose people for not spending time with
them," she added.
Other students choose to schedule

carefully their activities and they may have to
limit time spent with friends. "You really
don't make an effort to go over and visit
some people, whereas, others you do. You
have to limit something in order to get it all
done," Alborn said.
Time pressures on people here that cause
their meetings with other students to be in
frequent and hurried can often be remedied
by additional non-student friends who are
both on and off campus. "I have friends that
are off campus, on campus, professors and
people in the City. I have a network of
friends that are different, and I go to those
people for different things," Schulberg said.
Friends who are not students can be reassur
ing because they are not confronting the
same pressures and demands and, therefore,
they give a student a better perspective on
college life.
Student organizations on campus also of
fer people the opportunity to meet and
maintain friendships on a regular basis.
Working together on a project or for a com
mon cause can create meaningful friend
ships. "There are over 300 student organiza
tions, and that puts you in with a whole dif
ferent group of people (than those in the
dorm)," Byerwalter said.
The Bridge, the student peer counseling
center on campus, is always available to deal
with problems concerning friendships. For
example, a counselor can be helpful as a me
diator in a dispute between two friends who
are unable to resolve a problem and who
would like to have a neutral party to listen to
and advise them.
Counselors also mention alternatives that
the student may not have considered. For
example, when confronting the problem of
balancing schoolwork and friends, senior
Mukti Khanna said, "one way of doing it is
just to go to the library — there's no reason
why you have to go alone — go to the bot
tom-most stack of Green, and lock yourself
away."
The Bridge also sponsors workshops so
that people can meet other students and get
involved in an activity like yoga or hypnosis 4
