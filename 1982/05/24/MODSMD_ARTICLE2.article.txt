# Physics background a plus tor female astronaut Ride

### Brad Crystal 
Ever since the announcement last month that
astronaut Sally Ride would be the first American
woman to fly in space, the phones at Johnson
Space Center's public information office have
been ringing off the hook. Nearly three weeks
and more than 500 interview requests later,
Ride took time out of her hectic training sched
ule to speak to Stanford Daily reporter Brad
Crystal, who was sent to Houston to cover the
story.
It seems fitting that Sally Ride's first one-on
one interview since the announcement of her
upcoming Space Shuttle mission (scheduled for
April 1983) should be granted to the Daily. After
all, it was almost exactly four years ago that
astrophysics Ph.D. candidate Ride read a notice
in the Daily that NASA was accepting astronaut
applications.
Long a fan of the space program, the notice
caught Ride's eye and she decided to apply. Af
ter reviewing more than 8000 applications,
NASA selected 29 men and six women, includ
~Tng Ride.
It's no small accomplishment, conquering an
acceptance rate for women of less than one half
of one percent. But then Ride was not unac
customed to competitive admissions processes.
Besides being the first American woman
selected to circle the earth, Ride, who will turn
31 next Friday, has another distinction: she is
perhaps the only student Admissions Dean Fred
Hargadon has admitted to two different
schools. Hargadon admitted Ride to
'Swarthmore when he was admissions dean
there in 1969 and then admitted her here as a
transfer when he took up residence in Old
Union a year later.
Ride is unmistakably fond of the University:
; "I still have my Stanford book bag," she admits,
pointing towards a well preserved red nylon
sack lying on the desk. But her appreciation for
Stanford is best evidenced by her acknowl
edgment that the four degrees (two bachelors
— one in English, one in physics — a masters in
physics and a Ph.D. in astrophysics) she re

ceived here prepared her well for the
challenges of astronaut training.
"Although being in physics is not critical to
being an astronaut, I think the training that you
get and the way you learn to approach prob
lems and the way that you learn to learn is really
important, because there is an infinite amount
to learn about the space shuttle. We started
training officially about two weeks ago, right af
ter we were named for the flight and I'm spend
ing all my time in class and in simulators. It's re
ally nearly as intensive learning as it was my first
year of graduate school."
Though Ride says she is not a feminist in the
activist sense, she is deeply grateful to the wom
en's movement for smoothing the way for her.
Ride feels fortunate that she did not have the
onus of being a pioneer in the physics depart
ment.
"Probably the most important thing is that
before I came along into the physics depart
ment at Stanford, there had been enough peo
ple making enough noise before I got there that
it was easy for me. ' " 9 "
"I mean it was no big deal for me to be in the
physics department and that's not true of peo
ple who are two or three or four years older
than I am."
But why was the achievement Ride repre
sents so long in coming? By next April it will
have been 22 years since the first man rocketed
to space and nearly 20 years since the first wom
an, Soviet cosmonaut Valentina Tereshkova,
went up.
The answer, says Ride, lies in the nature of the
Space Shuttle program, which, unlike past pro
grams, does not require that astronauts have
test pilot experience.
"In the '60s all the astronauts were test pilots
and they were taken from the military — guys
that had been to test pilot school and had
thousands of hours in high performance jets.
There were no women who had those quali
fications ... there still aren't. I don't believe
there are any women right now who have com
pleted test pilot school yet and until they started
taking scientists as astronauts, there weren't any

women they considered qualified for the pro
gram."
And while Ride will spend hundreds of hours
in space shuttle simulators during the next ten
months before her flight, her assignment as
mission specialist will be to conduct interstellar
physics experiments, not to fly the shuttle. On
board, Ride and fellow mission specialist John
Fabian will spend much of their time studying x
ray st;ars and how the rays given off by them are
aborbed by clouds in space.
