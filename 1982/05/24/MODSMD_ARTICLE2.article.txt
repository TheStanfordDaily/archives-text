# Physics background a plus tor female astronaut Ride

### Brad Crystal 
Ever since the announcement last month that
astronaut Sally Ride would be the first American
woman to fly in space, the phones at Johnson
Space Center's public information office have
been ringing off the hook. Nearly three weeks
and more than 500 interview requests later,
Ride took time out of her hectic training sched
ule to speak to Stanford Daily reporter Brad
Crystal, who was sent to Houston to cover the
story.
It seems fitting that Sally Ride's first one-on
one interview since the announcement of her
upcoming Space Shuttle mission (scheduled for
April 1983) should be granted to the Daily. After
all, it was almost exactly four years ago that
astrophysics Ph.D. candidate Ride read a notice
in the Daily that NASA was accepting astronaut
applications.
Long a fan of the space program, the notice
caught Ride's eye and she decided to apply. Af
ter reviewing more than 8000 applications,
NASA selected 29 men and six women, includ
~Tng Ride.
It's no small accomplishment, conquering an
acceptance rate for women of less than one half
of one percent. But then Ride was not unac
customed to competitive admissions processes.
Besides being the first American woman
selected to circle the earth, Ride, who will turn
31 next Friday, has another distinction: she is
perhaps the only student Admissions Dean Fred
Hargadon has admitted to two different
schools. Hargadon admitted Ride to
'Swarthmore when he was admissions dean
there in 1969 and then admitted her here as a
transfer when he took up residence in Old
Union a year later.
Ride is unmistakably fond of the University:
; "I still have my Stanford book bag," she admits,
pointing towards a well preserved red nylon
sack lying on the desk. But her appreciation for
Stanford is best evidenced by her acknowl
edgment that the four degrees (two bachelors
— one in English, one in physics — a masters in
physics and a Ph.D. in astrophysics) she re

ceived here prepared her well for the
challenges of astronaut training.
"Although being in physics is not critical to
being an astronaut, I think the training that you
get and the way you learn to approach prob
lems and the way that you learn to learn is really
important, because there is an infinite amount
to learn about the space shuttle. We started
training officially about two weeks ago, right af
ter we were named for the flight and I'm spend
ing all my time in class and in simulators. It's re
ally nearly as intensive learning as it was my first
year of graduate school."
Though Ride says she is not a feminist in the
activist sense, she is deeply grateful to the wom
en's movement for smoothing the way for her.
Ride feels fortunate that she did not have the
onus of being a pioneer in the physics depart
ment.
"Probably the most important thing is that
before I came along into the physics depart
ment at Stanford, there had been enough peo
ple making enough noise before I got there that
it was easy for me. ' " 9 "
"I mean it was no big deal for me to be in the
physics department and that's not true of peo
ple who are two or three or four years older
than I am."
But why was the achievement Ride repre
sents so long in coming? By next April it will
have been 22 years since the first man rocketed
to space and nearly 20 years since the first wom
an, Soviet cosmonaut Valentina Tereshkova,
went up.
The answer, says Ride, lies in the nature of the
Space Shuttle program, which, unlike past pro
grams, does not require that astronauts have
test pilot experience.
"In the '60s all the astronauts were test pilots
and they were taken from the military — guys
that had been to test pilot school and had
thousands of hours in high performance jets.
There were no women who had those quali
fications ... there still aren't. I don't believe
there are any women right now who have com
pleted test pilot school yet and until they started
taking scientists as astronauts, there weren't any

women they considered qualified for the pro
gram."
And while Ride will spend hundreds of hours
in space shuttle simulators during the next ten
months before her flight, her assignment as
mission specialist will be to conduct interstellar
physics experiments, not to fly the shuttle. On
board, Ride and fellow mission specialist John
Fabian will spend much of their time studying x
ray st;ars and how the rays given off by them are
aborbed by clouds in space.

RIDING TO THE TOP - Former Stanford
student Sally Ride/ who found aiob with
NASA after reading an ad in the Daily, will
be one of the first female astronauts in the
United States.
—- -w...
Even so, will she have enough sim
ulator training to take over the com
mands if something should happen
to Commander Robert Crippen or Pi
lot Frederick Hauck?
"Probably not," says Ride. "I won't
be trained to land the shuttle. The
shuttle is operated by computers and
the commander takes over on entry
and actually does the approach and
the landing, but the computer could.
I'm trained to operate the computers
and all the system, but not to actually
fly the shuttle and to land it."
Ride is confident that the other
U.S. women astronauts will have a
chance to go up in the near future,
explaining "(NASA's) intention is to
fly all the women in the program and
all the men in the program. It's going
to be hard to keep track of all the
astronauts after a while. It already is.
There are 30 of us."
Ride believes NASA has made a
sincere commitment to making the
Space Shuttle program completely
accessible to both men and women.
"They designed the Space Shuttle
to be habitable by either men or
women. They designed the space
suits with women in mind. There are
no modifications that need to be
made because I was announced to a

crew."
The multi-billion dollar space
budget, while it may represent a frac
tion of the expenditures that went
into NASA during the '60s, has none
theless raised eyebrows among
budget cutters. When asked what
justifies continued NASA funding at
current levels, Ride queried in
tongue-in-cheek fashion, "You
mean besides the fact that its going to
be a lot of fun for me?"
But she has a pragmatic response,
too, and argues that the space pro
gram puts more into the economy
than it takes out: "It provides jobs for
aerospace workers, government em
ployees and it also puts an awful lot of
money into technological develop
ment ... I'm not the person who
ought to be justifying the existence
of the space program. I think that
that's up to people like NASA admin
istrators and the people that have to
sell the space program to Congress."
And, in Ride's view, more to the
space program exists than can be
measured in a matter of a dollars and
cents cost/benefit analysis.
"Aside from putting tangible
things back into the country, I think
that the space program provides
something that people need. I think
it provides something that you can
look to with fascination and it's kind
of corny to say that it's inspirational,

but it really is. People like to watch
space launches and people are proufl
when they see big clouds of fire and
smoke going up into space."
