feated yesterday in the finals by
Mike Leach of Michigan in
only two sets, 7-5,6-3.

defeated Saturday by John Van
Nostrand and Rill Baxter, also
of Pepperdine, 3-6, 6-2, 6-7
(7-3). Stanford's No. 2 doubles
team of John Corse and Scott
Bondurant were defeated in
Friday's second round by How
ard Sands and Adam Beren of
Harvard 6-4, 6-7 (7-5), 2-6.
In doubles, Davis and Arons
secured All-America status for
themselves when they ad
vanced to the round of 16 Fri

time in senior Aron's career
that he has made All-America.
Davis, seeded No. 4 in the
tournament, was the second in
a string of top-ranked players
defeated by Gilbert, a junior

caught Davis in one of the
many slumps he has suffered
from this year and defeated the

Gilbert went on to defeat
UCLA's Marcel Freeman, the
No. 1 seed in the tournament,
in just two tiebreaker sets Sat
urday 7-6 (7-3), 7-6 (8-6), prov
ing that his earlier victories
were not flukes.
Stanford head coach Dick
Gould accurately predicted last
Thursday that Gilbert could be
a legitimate threat.
"He is the type of player who
is capable of winnning the
whole tournament," Gould
said, commenting on Gilbert's
chances.
Gilbert faced Mike Leach of
Michigan in the finals. Leach
was winner of his match Satur
day over Christo Steyn of Mi

match with Gilbert marked the

of the top eight seeds made the
finals of the single-elimination
tournament.
