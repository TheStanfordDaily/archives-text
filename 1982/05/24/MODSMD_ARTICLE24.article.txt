Stanford coach Tim Baldwin
sees his women's golf team as a
dark horse pick in the first-ever
NCAA women's golf cham
pionships here Wednesday
through Saturday.
"Our team is really prepar
ing themselves positively,"
Baldwin said. "They are all
looking good and feeling
well."
And since the national title is
being held at Stanford Golf
Course, the Cardinal will have
an advantage over the 19 team
field, especially where short
games are concerned. "It's
close to a five shot a day advan
tage," Baldwin said. "We feel
that will put us into contention.
"Anything can happen. And
we're looking for something to
happen."
But for the 13th seeded
Cardinal to pull off an upset
win on its par-73, 5,903 yard
home course, it will have to
contend with the likes of New
Mexico, Tulsa, USC, Florida
and Arizona State — all teams
with more than enough talent
to take home the NCAA title —
according to Baldwin.
"I think its going to be
close," he commented. "To me

Tulsa has to be the favorite.
They have five extremely
strong golfers."
The Golden Hurricanes are
lead by freshman Jody Rosen
thal, medalist at the Lady Sun
Devil last month and possessor
of a 75.9 stroke average this
spring. Barb Thomas, Dee Dee
Lasker and Kathy Baker round
out probably the best lineup in
the nation.
Second seed Tulsa has
without a doubt been the
hottest team on the college
tour this spring, capturing five
tournament titles. Among
those is the Southern In
tercollegiate, perhaps the most
prestigous event of the season
besides, of course, the NCAAs.
In fact, the Intercollegiate is
termed by many as a NCAA
preview.
However, the Hurricane will
not run away with the crown
like they have so often this sea
son. The New Mexico Lobos, if
their No. 1 seeding is any in
dication, should prevent such
activity. The Lobos compiled
the nation's lowest stroke aver
age, 280.4 per round.
