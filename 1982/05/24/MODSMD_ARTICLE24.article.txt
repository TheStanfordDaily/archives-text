### Mark Zeigler 
Stanford coach Tim Baldwin
sees his women's golf team as a
dark horse pick in the first-ever
NCAA women's golf cham
pionships here Wednesday
through Saturday.
"Our team is really prepar
ing themselves positively,"
Baldwin said. "They are all
looking good and feeling
well."
And since the national title is
being held at Stanford Golf
Course, the Cardinal will have
an advantage over the 19 team
field, especially where short
games are concerned. "It's
close to a five shot a day advan
tage," Baldwin said. "We feel
that will put us into contention.
"Anything can happen. And
we're looking for something to
happen."
But for the 13th seeded
Cardinal to pull off an upset
win on its par-73, 5,903 yard
home course, it will have to
contend with the likes of New
Mexico, Tulsa, USC, Florida
and Arizona State — all teams
with more than enough talent
to take home the NCAA title —
according to Baldwin.
"I think its going to be
close," he commented. "To me

Tulsa has to be the favorite.
They have five extremely
strong golfers."
The Golden Hurricanes are
lead by freshman Jody Rosen
thal, medalist at the Lady Sun
Devil last month and possessor
of a 75.9 stroke average this
spring. Barb Thomas, Dee Dee
Lasker and Kathy Baker round
out probably the best lineup in
the nation.
Second seed Tulsa has
without a doubt been the
hottest team on the college
tour this spring, capturing five
tournament titles. Among
those is the Southern In
tercollegiate, perhaps the most
prestigous event of the season
besides, of course, the NCAAs.
In fact, the Intercollegiate is
termed by many as a NCAA
preview.
However, the Hurricane will
not run away with the crown
like they have so often this sea
son. The New Mexico Lobos, if
their No. 1 seeding is any in
dication, should prevent such
activity. The Lobos compiled
the nation's lowest stroke aver
age, 280.4 per round.

OOPS — Stanford sophomore Scott Davis just could not
Rut it together in the NCAA men's tennis individuals los
*£ to unseeded Brad Gilbert of Pepperdine 3-6,6-4,6-3 in
the third round of the tournament. Gilbert went on to ad
vance to the finals before losing to Michigan's Mike
Leach.
UNM won the Stanford
Fall Intercollegiate last No
vember by a commanding
nine stroke margin. But this
time the Lobos will be
without Ail-American Kris
Monagan, who injured a leg
in an intramural basketball
game, jeopardizing their
chances.
Both Florida and Arizona
State are lead by a pair of
Lauri's, the Gators by All-
American Lauri Rinker and
the Sun Devils by Ail-Ameri
can candidate Lauri Peter
son. Both also have games
suited to the Stanford
course and pressure tour
nament play, according to
Baldwin.
Another team the Card
coach looks for to be in the
thick of things come Satur
day afternoon is USC. "They
have got four really strong
players that have a lot of in
ternational experience,"
Baldwin noted.
One of those players is
junior Marta Figueras-Dotti
from Madrid, Spain, wf\p
won the Italian, French and
Spanish Amateur Cham
pionships in 1979. She fin
ished second in both the
Canadian and British open
in 1980 and 1981, respective
ly-
Sixth seed San Jose State is
the other dark horse team
according to Baldwin, since
"they play on our course a
lot." Top player Juli Inkster
is one of the premier wom
en iinksters in the United
States with amateur stand
ing. The Spartan senior is
the defending two-time
U.S. Women's Amateur
champion. She fired a ca
reer low 67 in a three-way
competition with the Card
and Sacramento State a
month ago in Sacramento.
Inkster and co. placed
first in the Arizona, Husky,
and USIU Invitationals and
will have nearly as much a

home course advantage as
the Cardinal.
Inkster, along with
Figueras-Dotti, Peterson,
Rosenthal, Amy Benz
(Southern Methodist), Mary
Enright (UCLA), Val Skinner
(Oklahoma .State) and
Cardinal Lori Castillo, are fa
vorites to win the individual
crown.
"That group has always
done well in big tour
naments," Baldwin com
mented.
Stanford will field the
five-woman squad that has
yielded so much recent suc
cess for it — Castillo, Joanne
Pacillo, Kathy Nino, Diane
Nixon and Debbie Barberio.
Baldwin noted the third,
fourth and 14th holes as
being the key ones in the
four-day affair. The par-3
14th has been out of play in
recent months due to a
landslide caused by heavy
winter rain.
However, the hole will be
used for the NCAAs, with
the washed away area in
front of the slick green
deemed a hazard. Players
hitting into the dirt will not
be allowed to retrieve their
balls, but will be issued a
penalty stroke and forced to
drop next to the green.
Baldwin calls the hole no.
3 "as tough a par-3 as any- w
one will play all year."Birdie
holes will be one, six, 12 and
18 according to the Card
coach.
The weeks festivities in
clude a long driving contest
today at 5 p.m. off the first
tee. "Val Skinner is the
odds-on favorite to win fol
lowed by Debbie Hall from
SMU," Baldwin said. He
predicted that the winner
would drive the ball be
tween 260 and 275 yards.
Tomorrow at 1 p.m. the
top 12 linksters form the East
and West meet in a East-
West competitions.
Practice rounds are today

competition beginning
Wednesday morning.

close to a five shot a day advan
tage," Baldwin said. "We feel
that will put us into contention.
"Anything can happen. And
we're looking for something to
happen."
But for the 13th seeded
Cardinal to pull off an upset
win on its par-73, 5,903 yard
home course, it will have to
contend with the likes of New
Mexico, Tulsa, USC, Florida
and Arizona State — all teams
with more than enough talent
to take home the NCAA title —
according to Baldwin.
"I think its going to be
close," he commented. "To me

Tulsa has to be the favorite.
They have five extremely
strong golfers."
The Golden Hurricanes are
lead by freshman Jody Rosen
thal, medalist at the Lady Sun
Devil last month and possessor
of a 75.9 stroke average this
spring. Barb Thomas, Dee Dee
Lasker and Kathy Baker round
out probably the best lineup in
the nation.
Second seed Tulsa has
without a doubt been the
hottest team on the college
tour this spring, capturing five
tournament titles. Among
those is the Southern In
tercollegiate, perhaps the most
prestigous event of the season
besides, of course, the NCAAs.
In fact, the Intercollegiate is
termed by many as a NCAA
preview.
However, the Hurricane will
not run away with the crown
like they have so often this sea
son. The New Mexico Lobos, if
their No. 1 seeding is any in
dication, should prevent such
activity. The Lobos compiled
the nation's lowest stroke aver
age, 280.4 per round.

OOPS — Stanford sophomore Scott Davis just could not
Rut it together in the NCAA men's tennis individuals los
*£ to unseeded Brad Gilbert of Pepperdine 3-6,6-4,6-3 in
the third round of the tournament. Gilbert went on to ad
vance to the finals before losing to Michigan's Mike
Leach.
UNM won the Stanford
Fall Intercollegiate last No
vember by a commanding
nine stroke margin. But this
time the Lobos will be
without Ail-American Kris
Monagan, who injured a leg
in an intramural basketball
game, jeopardizing their
chances.
Both Florida and Arizona
State are lead by a pair of
Lauri's, the Gators by All-
American Lauri Rinker and
the Sun Devils by Ail-Ameri
can candidate Lauri Peter
son. Both also have games
suited to the Stanford
course and pressure tour
nament play, according to
Baldwin.
Another team the Card
coach looks for to be in the
thick of things come Satur
day afternoon is USC. "They
have got four really strong
players that have a lot of in
ternational experience,"
Baldwin noted.
One of those players is
junior Marta Figueras-Dotti
from Madrid, Spain, wf\p
won the Italian, French and
Spanish Amateur Cham
pionships in 1979. She fin
ished second in both the
Canadian and British open
in 1980 and 1981, respective
ly-
Sixth seed San Jose State is
the other dark horse team
according to Baldwin, since
"they play on our course a
lot." Top player Juli Inkster
is one of the premier wom
en iinksters in the United
States with amateur stand
ing. The Spartan senior is
the defending two-time
U.S. Women's Amateur
champion. She fired a ca
reer low 67 in a three-way
competition with the Card
and Sacramento State a
month ago in Sacramento.
Inkster and co. placed
first in the Arizona, Husky,
and USIU Invitationals and
will have nearly as much a

home course advantage as
the Cardinal.
Inkster, along with
Figueras-Dotti, Peterson,
Rosenthal, Amy Benz
(Southern Methodist), Mary
Enright (UCLA), Val Skinner
(Oklahoma .State) and
Cardinal Lori Castillo, are fa
vorites to win the individual
crown.
"That group has always
done well in big tour
naments," Baldwin com
mented.
Stanford will field the
five-woman squad that has
yielded so much recent suc
cess for it — Castillo, Joanne
Pacillo, Kathy Nino, Diane
Nixon and Debbie Barberio.
Baldwin noted the third,
fourth and 14th holes as
being the key ones in the
four-day affair. The par-3
14th has been out of play in
recent months due to a
landslide caused by heavy
winter rain.
However, the hole will be
used for the NCAAs, with
the washed away area in
front of the slick green
deemed a hazard. Players
hitting into the dirt will not
be allowed to retrieve their
balls, but will be issued a
penalty stroke and forced to
drop next to the green.
Baldwin calls the hole no.
3 "as tough a par-3 as any- w
one will play all year."Birdie
holes will be one, six, 12 and
18 according to the Card
coach.
The weeks festivities in
clude a long driving contest
today at 5 p.m. off the first
tee. "Val Skinner is the
odds-on favorite to win fol
lowed by Debbie Hall from
SMU," Baldwin said. He
predicted that the winner
would drive the ball be
tween 260 and 275 yards.
Tomorrow at 1 p.m. the
top 12 linksters form the East
and West meet in a East-
West competitions.
Practice rounds are today
and Tuesday with official
competition beginning
Wednesday morning.
Stanford coach Tim Baldwin
sees his women's golf team as a
dark horse pick in the first-ever
NCAA women's golf cham
pionships here Wednesday
through Saturday.
"Our team is really prepar
ing themselves positively,"
Baldwin said. "They are all
looking good and feeling
well."
And since the national title is
being held at Stanford Golf
Course, the Cardinal will have
an advantage over the 19 team
field, especially where short
games are concerned. "It's
close to a five shot a day advan
tage," Baldwin said. "We feel
