# Erving leads 76ers past Celtics; Philadelphia prepares for L.A.

Boston â€” In one of the most
remarkable reversals of form in
NBA history, the Philadelphia
76ers Sunday emphatically
ended Boston's hopes of re
peating as champion with a
brilliant all-around per
formance.
After stumbling through one
of their worst games in recent
years Friday night, the 76ers
came back and overwhelmed
the Celtics in every phase of
the game, winning, 120-106, in
the seventh game of the
Eastern Conference finals and
advancing to the cham
pionship series against Los An
geles.
That best-of-seven series
starts Thursday night in Phila
delihia.
Had they been defeated
Sunday, the 76ers would have
lost the conference finals to the
Celtics two years in a row after
leading the series, three games
to one. They lost Game 5 by 29
points and scored only 75
points in losing Game 6 Friday
night.
Coach Billy Cunningham,
obviously upset by the stories
in the newspapers here and in
Philadelphia after Game 6, in
cluding a Sunday morning
headline that took up most of
the front page of a tabloid pa
per saying: "Will Sixers
Choke?", had little to say to the
media afterward.
"I'm ecstatic for the 12 guys
in there," he said, referring to
his players in a nearby dressing
room. "They stuck together
when everybody else had
buried us."
Andrew Toney scored 34
points for the Sixers and Julius

Erving, averaging only 17
points per game in the series,
had 29. Robert Parish scored 23
to lead the Celtics.
Despite the enthusastic en
couragement of a sellout
crowd of 15,320, the Celtics
never showed the intensity, the
quickness or the aggressive
ness they displayed in winning
the previous two games. They
were tentative and passed as if
they had never seen each other
before. They had 22 turnovers.
"We've been in a lot of big
games and I don't believe that
we passed the ball as fun
damentally poorly as we did to
day," Coach Bill Fitch said.
"Our passing was just atro
cious."
The 76ers took advantage of
almost every mistake, turning
them into 29 points.
"Our defense carried us,"
said forward Bobby Jones "And
Andrew (Toney) did the rest."
Toney, a 6-foot-3 guard who
had made only one of 11 shots
in Friday night's humiliating
88-75 defeat, scored 14 points
in the first quarter and finished
only five points under his
playoff high.
"I was determined to have a
good game after Friday night,"
Toney said. "A couple of guys
called me at home and offered
some encouragement. That
meant a lot and I sure didn't
want to let them down."
Several 76ers said it was very
important not to let the Celtics
get off to a big lead, because if
they did it would inspire the
fans. Although Larry Bird (20
points) made Boston's first four
points and the Celtics led, 7-4,

Philadelphia rallied and built a
21-14 advantage after 7 1-2
minutes.
"A lot of people counted us
out, but we knew we could
win," said Maurice Cheeks,
who had 19 points and 11 as
sists. "Sure, there was some
doubt after Game 6, but we've
come back before. When we
rebound, block out, do ev
erything we have to win, this is
what happens."
Erving, who scored 20 points
in the second half Sunday,
called a meeting Saturday af
ternoon after a workout in the
Palestra and stressed several
things that he thought had an
effect on the 76ers' stunning
performance.
"I think it had a jelling in
fluence," Erving said. "We
ironed out some things we
were doing offensively and en
couraged a 12-man effort. We
tried to put Friday's game out
of our minds."
Erving, an all-star forward,
started very slowly. He was
scoreless when taken out with
44 seconds left in the first quar
ter and didn't make his first
shot until 7:12 remained in the
half.
Once he started making his
outside shots, it opened up the
court and gave the 76ers the of
fensive balance they had been
lacking. He had nine points in a
3:15 stretch when his team
took a 46-40 lead. After falling
behind, 50-42, Boston scored
seven of the last nine points of
the period to reduce its deficit
to 52-49 at intermission.

"All year long we've talked
about short-range goals," Erv
ing said. "So at halftime, we
said that if we could just play
the game as well for the next 24
as we did in the first half, we'd
win. Then we wound up
playing better."
Philadelphia scored the first
six points of the second half on
two shots by Cheeks and a fast
break dunk by Erving that
forced Boston to use a time
out. The Celtics came back
with four quick points, but the
76ers refused to fold.
Erving scored four more
points, Cheeks broke away for
a layup and the 76ers had their
first double-figure lead, 64-54,
with 7:43 left in the quarter.
Once again, the Celtics made a
move, scoring eight straight
points, but again the 76ers

came back, with six straight.
Erving made a baseline
jumper and an 18-footer with a
second remaining and Phila
delphia took an 83-71 lead into
the fourth quarter. Never
theless, the crowd, obviously
aware of the Philadelphia
foldups in the past, was on its
feet cheering.
A three-point play by Toney,
a fast-break dunk by Darryl
Dawkins, a 14-footer by Toney
and a jumper by Erving in
creased the 76ers' lead to 96-80
when time was called with 7:19
to play.
"That's when I felt we had
the game," Erving said. "I knew
they'd make another run at us,
but I figured if we scored just 10
more points, they'd have to
score 26 and they didn't have
time to do that.''
