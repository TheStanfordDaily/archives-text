San Jose — Dr. Edward Teller, a
senior research fellow at the Hoover
Institution, endorsed San Diego
/Mayor Pete Wilson's bid for the Re
publican nomination for the U.S.
ienate at a small press conference
Friday at the Hyatt Hotel.
Teller, an associate at Livermore
Laboratories and often called the
father of the hydrogen bomb, said he
backs Wilson because "I am in com
plete agreement with Pete Wilson's
approach to the questions of nuclear

power and nuclear energy" and that
" 'Senator' Wilson will play a very im
portant role" in the development of
nuclear energy.
Wilson told seven reporters that
Teller's endorsement did not hinge
on mutual agreement of nuclear
energy and nuclear power issues.
Nevertheless, both men concurred
on most aspects of the issues. Both
men oppose California's nuclear
freeze iniative which will be on the
November ballot.
"I agree with Pete Wilson that Cali

fornia's nuclear freeze iniative must
be defeated," Teller said. "The Unit
ed States' main purpose is to avoid
war, any war. I am for the defensive

use of nuclear weapons, not the de
structive. But I am also the de
termined opponent of mutual de
struction policies."
Teller said he believes a freeze
would put the United States at a dis
advantage in nuclear power while
the Soviet Union would further de
velop their nuclear weapons.
Teller's endorsement joins a grow
ing list Wilson has been compiling as
the campaign heads for the final two
weeks. Proposition 13 co-author Paul

Gann recently endorsed Wilson
based on Wilson's support of Gannls
Proposition 8, the "Victim's Bill <}112
Rights."
Wilson has placed neck and neck
with Rep. Barry Goldwater Jr. (R-
Woodland Hills) in the most recent
Field poll which assessed the Juji£uB
race for the U.S. Senate. Wilson WW
reporters he considers the primary a
two-man race, between he attfcl
Goldwater, although there are ftyte
other major contenders in the race:
Reps. Paul "Pete" McCloskey (?-
Menlo Park) and Robert Dornan (IJ-
Santa Monica), Maureen Reagan,
Ted Bruinsma and State Sen. Josi
Schmitz (R-Corona del Mar).
Goldwater garnered 29 percent«in
the May 14 Field poll, followed Uy
Wilson with 28 percent and Mt-
Closkey with 21 percent. The other
candidates had significantly smaller
poll tallies. -
Following the press conference,
Wilson attended a fundraising event
held in his honor in Saratoga.
