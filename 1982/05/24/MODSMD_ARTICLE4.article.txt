Argentina loses six planes in second large raid
' London — Argentina lost six warpianes yesteray in a large-scale air
attack on the British beachhead on East Falkland Island, a defense
spokesman said here.
Five Argentine Mirages and a Skyhawk fighter-bomber were shot
down, the spokesman said, and one Mirage and two Skyhawks were
listed as probable kills.
There was no confirmation of the losses from the Argentine military
command in Buenos Aires, which said Argentine forces on the island
were trying to dislodge the British from their landing zone around San
Carlos Bay on the channel separating the two main Falkland islands.
Yesterday's air attack was the second large raid since the British force
jwent ashore Friday, when the invasion fleet came under wave after
of Argentine planes.
The Argentines sank the frigate Ardent in Friday's attack and dam
aged four other ships, the British Defense Ministry announced, but lost
'14 jet fighters. Yesterday's raid damaged a British frigate, the ministry
spokesman said. The extent of damage or casualties were not reported,
nor was the ship identified.
According to British figures, the Argentine air force and navy have
,now lost 56 planes and helicopters since the Falklands conflict began
with the Argentine seizure of the islands on April 2. British intelligence
sources said that figure amounted to more than a quarter of the Argen
tine air strength, a heavy loss if the figures are correct.
The Defense Ministry announced the Argentine
planes had come under fire from ship-to-air missiles,
Rapier ground-to-air missiles and Harrier jets from
the two British carriers in the war zone.
The British reported no air losses during the day.
The British ships attacked yesterday were providing
fire support and air defense for the 5000 marine com
mandos and paratroops ashore, who are preparing to
move against Stanley, the Falklands capital 50 miles to
the east, in coming days, military spokesmen said.
Meanwhile, ministers in Prime Minister Margaret
Thatcher's government indicated that diplomacy
would have to take "a back seat," as one put it, to the
military developments on the island. A source close to
Thatcher said that the government would not accept
any cease-fire resolution by the U.N. Security Coun
cil.
Several senior officials suggested, as one said, "It is
a new ballgame" as far as compromises being made to
Argentina. Basically, the British are now calling for a
total surrender of Argentine troops on the Falklands.
Argentina ready to accept ceasfire
Buenos Aires — Argentine President Leopoldo
Galtieri said yesterday that he is prepared to accept a
cease-fire in the Falkland Islands war, and his govern
ment appeared to be putting a damper on unofficial
claims of great Argentine success against the British
invasion.
Galtieri's willingness to accept a cease-fire came in
a message, responding to Pope John Paul ll's week
end plea for an immediate end to the fighting.
However, there was nothing in Galtieri's message,
couched in vague, general terms, to indicate any Ar
gentine concessions that might persuade Britain to
end the hostilities.
In sharp contrast to itsalmost gleeful communiques
during the hours immediately after the British landed
on the Falklands beginning early Friday, the govern
ment yesterday made almost no comment on the war.
And it pointedly warned journalists against accept
ing assessments from unnamed military sources
claiming that Argentina has scored great gains in the
battle.
Haig: stalemate prevents peace
Washington — Secretary of State Alexander Haig
said yesterday that a diplomatic solution to the
Falkland Islands crisis is not likely until one side gains
a distinct military advantage over the other.
"We of course would hope that there would be a
renewed round of negotiations at any point," the sec
retary said. "But it's clear that until some evidence of
change in the military situation is available, there may
be continued stalemate."
Haig, interviewed on CBS-TV's face the Nation,
said the establishment of a beachhead on the
Falklands by British landing forces constituted a
"rather remarkable change" in the picture that could
prompt a new round of negotiations beween Britain
and Argentina.
"I would hope that efforts would continue on the
part of all parties to continue to arrive at an early solu
tion," he said.
Meanwhile, British Foreign Secretary Francis Pym

held out little hope for a peaceful solution to the dis
pute, saying that there was no indication the Argen
tines were willing to back down.
"It looks as though the Falkland Islands are going to
be repossessed by Britain by force, unless there's a last
minute change in mind by Argentina," Pym said in an
interview on ABC's This Week with David Brinkley.
Asked what action Britain would take if it suc
ceeded in regaining the islands, Pym said that he en
visioned allowing a "period for rehabilitation" of
from six months to a year during which the inhabi
tants would be given time to reorder their lives and
consider their political future.
Salvadoran president will not
veto land reform suspension
San Salvador — President Alvaro Magana said Sat
urday that he will not use his veto power to block the
Constituent Assembly's action suspending one of El
Salvador's controversial land reforms.
"I don't think the assembly has anything bad in
mind, so I don't think it is important to use the veto,"
he said.
On Tuesday, the rightist-dominated Constituent
Assembly voted to suspend the so-called land-to-the
tiller portion of the nation's land reform program.
That portion permitted sharecroppers and tenant
farmers to claim title to up to 17 acres of land they
were renting.
Suspension of land-to-the-tiller was seen by many
as the first step in a reversal of U.S.-backed reforms
initiated after a coup d'etat deposed a military regime
in 1979. It also raised the possibility of a first confron
tation between Magana, a moderate, and Roberto
D'Aubuisson, the ultra-rightist president of the as
sembly.
Magana said Saturday that he is satisfied that the as
sembly's intent is strictly to encourage higher agricul
tural production. Previously, some landowners were
afraid to rent acreage for fear that the tenant would
then claim it.
