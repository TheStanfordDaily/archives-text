# Quake could topple old Chem building

The 82-year-old chemistry build
ing that survived the 1906 earthquake
and has recently undergone repara
tions to strengthen it still may not be
safe should an earthquake rock the
area, according to Dave Haskin, ad
ministrative officer for the Chemistry
Department.
"It would not be my choice of a
place to be in an earthquake/' he
said. .
The top floor of the Old Chemistry
Building has been closed while con
tractors have strengthened the build
ing, repaired a cracked and twisted
structural beam and added some ver
tical supports in order to be able to
store safely library books on the sec
ond floor.
Dwight Gowin, the contractor
doing the repair work, said the build
ing fs basically safe and the Only struc
tural problem is the beam that is
being repaired.
Haskin said it was a "misconcep
tion running around" that the floor is
closed off because of structural de
fects. The floor had to be emptied
and the doors kept closed in order to
meet the fire code which prohibits
open staircases running for more

than two stories, he said.
According to a 1978 report, the
cracked structural beam had 264 per
cent of the load on it that it is able to
bear safely, Haskin said. He added,
however, that the report used "a
couple of awfully cautious assump
tions," including the estimate of the
strength of the beam.
The repair work will ensure that
the building is structurally safe,
Haskin said. "The structural question
is now being solved, and the famous
]2 (the cracked beam) is being
strengthened," he said.
"The building is probably quite rig
id under vertical load, but of course
lateral load is what you worry about
in an earthquake." The building
would probably "shift and not re
turn," Haskin said.
Margaret Green, the head librarian
of the Swain Chemistry Library, said
the Old Chemistry Building "is not
earthquake-proof. It does not meet
modern-day standards of being
earthquake-proof."
Tom Shih, a Santa Clara County
building inspector, said the building
does not have to meet modern build
ing codes, since it was built before
