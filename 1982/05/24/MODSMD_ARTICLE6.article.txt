# Schools join Paly In anti-nuclear rally
## 
### Kathy Christie 
Seventeen Bay Area high schools
met at Palo Alto High school yester
day in an anti-nuclear arms prolifera
tion rally which included a booth
promoting Soviet-American picture
exchanges and featured a talk from a
survivor of the Hiroshima nuclear
blast.
The "Rally for Life" was sponsored
by the Palo Alto High School Ecology
Club and organized by a core group
of students from six local high
schools. Bill McGlashan, a senior at
Woodside Prior High School and an
organizer, cited the Vietnam War
crisis as an example of the public's in
volvement having an influence on
governmental policy.
Because of the immediate threat of
nuclear warfare, McGlashan said,
"We no longer have the luxury to re
main irresponsible." v

Booths at the rally, each managed
by a different high school, provided
displays and literature on the effects
of a nuclear holocaust. Blank post
cards to send to Soviet Premier
Leonid Brezhnev and President
Ronald Reagan were also provided.
At the booth sponsored by Willow
Glen High School, a student with a
Polaroid camera took pictures of
people; the pictures would be sent to
citizens in the Soviet Union.
The picture program, sponsored
by the Association for Humanistic
Psychology in San Francisco, allows
American citizens to have a photo
exchange with Soviet citizens, a
process which hopes to "person
alize" the world and help Americans
and Soviets come "closer to each
other and world peace," according
to an informational sheet.
