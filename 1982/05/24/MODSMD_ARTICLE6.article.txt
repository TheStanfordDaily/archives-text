Seventeen Bay Area high schools
met at Palo Alto High school yester
day in an anti-nuclear arms prolifera
tion rally which included a booth
promoting Soviet-American picture
exchanges and featured a talk from a
survivor of the Hiroshima nuclear
blast.
The "Rally for Life" was sponsored
by the Palo Alto High School Ecology
Club and organized by a core group
of students from six local high
schools. Bill McGlashan, a senior at
Woodside Prior High School and an
organizer, cited the Vietnam War
crisis as an example of the public's in
volvement having an influence on
governmental policy.
Because of the immediate threat of
nuclear warfare, McGlashan said,
"We no longer have the luxury to re
main irresponsible." v

Booths at the rally, each managed
by a different high school, provided
displays and literature on the effects
of a nuclear holocaust. Blank post
cards to send to Soviet Premier
Leonid Brezhnev and President
Ronald Reagan were also provided.
At the booth sponsored by Willow
Glen High School, a student with a
Polaroid camera took pictures of
people; the pictures would be sent to
citizens in the Soviet Union.
The picture program, sponsored
by the Association for Humanistic
Psychology in San Francisco, allows
American citizens to have a photo
exchange with Soviet citizens, a
process which hopes to "person
alize" the world and help Americans
and Soviets come "closer to each
other and world peace," according
to an informational sheet.
At the beginning of the rally a rep
resentative from Congressman Tom
Lantos' (D-San Mateo) office came to
pick up petitions which over 2500
students signed to urge Reagan to
cease further nuclear development
and meet with Brezhnev to achieve
world peace. Kelly Rich, an organizer
at Palo Alto High School, estimated
that 90 percent of all Palo Alto High
School students signed the petition.
The first speaker on the panel of
three was Dr. Robert Jones, a senior
scientist at the Ames Research Cen
ter and a member of the National
Academy of Sciences.
"It's ridiculous to talk of nuclear
superiority. It doesn't matter," Jones
said, noting that France has nuclear
superiority over the United States be
cause it can destroy it within one half
hour. "If you had a gun pointed at
your head, you wouldn't care if it
were a 6-shooter or a 5-shooter;"
Jones said, "the nation's leaders
can't grasp this idea."
Dr. Mytsuo Tomosawa, an op
tometrist from Watsonville and a

Hiroshima survivor, also spoke on
the panel. Tomosawa, who was 15-
years-old at the time of the nuclear
blast, spoke of having heard two
B-29s going over the city, but since
this was not unusual, "we didn't take
it seriously." The B-29s disappeared,
but on the return flight Tomasawa
saw the bomb — "something black
was reflecting the sun," he said.
Within seconds there were flashes
of light, and then a tremendous ex
plosion; "When the blast wave hit us
I fell unconscious," Tomosawa said.
After regaining consciousness, he
said he realized "I was blown off my
feet 25 to 30 feet from where I was."
He said he remembered seeing
"hundreds of people evacuating the
city ... It looked like many ghosts
coming out of a graveyard." At night
he was unable to sleep because of the
cries of the hospitalized people
nearby which sounded "as if the
voices were coming from Hell." Yet
these were only the immediate casu
alties of the blast; Tomosawa cited
figures that confirmed the total
number of dead from the
catastrophes at Hiroshima and
Nagasaki to be 200,000.
Speaking to the high school au

dience, Tomosawa stressed, "The)
future belongs to you ... If we don't ■

"It's ridiculous to talk of nuclear
superiority. It doesn't matter," Jones
said, noting that France has nuclear
superiority over the United States be
cause it can destroy it within one half
hour. "If you had a gun pointed at
your head, you wouldn't care if it
were a 6-shooter or a 5-shooter;"
Jones said, "the nation's leaders
can't grasp this idea."
Dr. Mytsuo Tomosawa, an op
tometrist from Watsonville and a

Hiroshima survivor, also spoke on
the panel. Tomosawa, who was 15-
years-old at the time of the nuclear
blast, spoke of having heard two
B-29s going over the city, but since
this was not unusual, "we didn't take
it seriously." The B-29s disappeared,
but on the return flight Tomasawa
saw the bomb — "something black
was reflecting the sun," he said.
Within seconds there were flashes
of light, and then a tremendous ex
plosion; "When the blast wave hit us
I fell unconscious," Tomosawa said.
After regaining consciousness, he
said he realized "I was blown off my
feet 25 to 30 feet from where I was."
He said he remembered seeing
"hundreds of people evacuating the
city ... It looked like many ghosts
coming out of a graveyard." At night
he was unable to sleep because of the
cries of the hospitalized people
nearby which sounded "as if the
voices were coming from Hell." Yet
these were only the immediate casu
alties of the blast; Tomosawa cited
figures that confirmed the total
number of dead from the
catastrophes at Hiroshima and
Nagasaki to be 200,000.
Speaking to the high school au

dience, Tomosawa stressed, "The)
future belongs to you ... If we don't ■

Richard Rathbun, an executive)
from People for Social Responsi
bility, agreed, saying that a hopeful
attitude will help the nuclear
crisis be successfully resolved. "The;
outcome is how we make it," he'said..
