# Student temporarily committed to hospital
## 
### Steve Trousdale 
During the weekend of May 8 and 9 a Stanford
student who refused voluntary hospitalization was
committed to Belmont Hills Psychiatric Hospital
for 72 hours of observation because it was decided
that she was a danger to herself.
Two police officers were dispatched to the stu
dent's residence when the student's boyfriend at
tempted to call Sgt. Chris Simpson, an officer they
knew on the University's Dept. of Public Safety, for
help in dealing with the situation. Simpson was not
there, but the dispatcher decided that the ap
parent urgency of the situation warranted sending
officers to check on the student. According to a
friend of the student, she was distraught over re
cent events, including the recent suicide of Chris
Johnson, a friend of hers.
It was decided that the student would be com
mitted to a psychiatric hospital, although there is
disagreement about who made that decision. The
student claims that the police told her boyfriend
that they felt it was not necessary for her to be
committed to a hospital.
In contrast to this however, the Counseling and
Psychological Services (CAPS) staff psychiatrist Dr.
Karen Johnson said the decision to place her under

observation for 72 hours was made by the police.
Approximately a day and a half after the student
was released from Belmont Hills, she received a
$700 bill from both the hospital and the ambulance
service which took her there.
Johnson said the decision to put the student on
72 hour hold had already been made and claims
that she did the student "a favor" in sending her to
Belmont Hills because the police would have sent
her to Santa Clara Valley Medical Center, a public
hospital she termed "unpleasant." However, there
would have been no charge to the student if she
had been placed in a public hospital.
Johnson said she sent the student to a private
hospital because the student told her that she had
insurance. However, the student now does not
wish to put a claim in to her insurance company for
the bill because she does not want her parents to
find out about the incident, the student said.
Johnson said that it was "a requirement, not an
option of the law" to place the student on 72-hour
hold because of the provisions of the Lanterman-
Petris-Short Act, which she described as a "law
governing the use of involuntary psychiatric hospi
talization" when a person is considered a danger
to himself or others.

She based her conclusion that the student fit the
criterion of this law on statements made by people
in the student's dorm who said that the student was
very depressed and had talked of suicide. Also, the
student had recently put her hand through a pane
of glass. According to Johnson, this resembled the
way in which the student had earlier tried to com
mit suicide by cutting her wrists. The student said
she had been feeling suicidal, Johnson added.
Johnson said that hfer conversation with the stu
dent lasted for approximately 15 minutes, and that
she spent a total of two hours on the case. This in
cluded a discussion with the two police officers,
who had talked with the student for an additional
45 minutes.
The student, however, said that her conversa
tion with Johnson could not have lasted for "more
than ten minutes."
The student also claimed that she was told by the
police officers who talked with her that it was stan
dard procedure for someone in her situation to see
a therapist for counseling. Based on this she agreed
to the counseling though she felt that she had
been forced into going to CAPS.
