## Meat, grain shortages plague Moscow 
### Washington Post 
Moscow — A confidential study pre
pared for the top Soviet leadership has out
lined a near-disastrous decline in the Sovi
et Union's ability to feed itself, demon
strating a compelling need for agricultural
and other economic reforms.
The study, made available here, pro
vided figures that showed a tenfold in
crease in Soviet food imports over the past
decade, staggering levels of mishandling
of agricultural equipment and "direct
losses" of harvested crops due to negli
gence and lack of storage or drying facil
ities.
The document, prepared by a special
government commission during the past
year, said one-fifth of the grain harvest is
Ipst because it is harvested late or left to
rot.
; The figures given for losses for other
<;rops are even higher, including the fact
that one-third of the country's potato crop
is left to rot. According to experts who
took part in drafting the document, about
half of potato production — or the
equivalent of the entire annual American

production — is lost each year because of a
chaotic distribution system and lack of
storage facilities.
As a result, the study said, an average So
viet citizen is poorly fed, consuming 54
pounds of meat per year less than required
by medical standards.
The commission, which prepared the
study in cooperation with the state plan
ning commission and 38 ministries and sci
entific institutes, concluded that "the ex
isting economic mechanism does not pro
vide necessary economic incentives for
production increases and fuller use of the
potentially available land."
The study provided the basis for an in
ternal debate leading to a special Central
Committee meeting on agriculture, to be
held today.
The gloomy assessments and devastating
statistics suggest that the crisis in agricul
ture may become a touchy political prob
lem. Just what course of action Kremlin
leaders intend to take is not clear, al
though experts involved in the prepara
tion of the study talked about financial in

centives and about the need to adopt parts
of the "Hungarian model." In Hungary
most land is run by cooperatives that have
become very profitable because of finan
cial incentives for productivity. Hungary
not only produces enough food for its own
needs but also exports about $2 billion
worth of food products.
A similar Central Committee meeting
devoted exclusively to agriculture was
held in March 1965, shortly after Leonid
Brezhnev replaced former leader Nikita
Khrushchev. At that time, most of the fail
ures of previous years were blamed on
Khrushchev.
As it stands, the study prepared for the
Brezhnev Politburo appears to be an in
dictment of the present leadership.
Well-informed observers here said that
recognition of the need for radical
changes may suggest that the leadership is
prepared for decisive action. In this view,
President jimmy Carter's grain embargo
two years ago forced Kremlin leaders to
move toward reforms and reduce Soviet
dependence on foreign sources of food.
