# OPEC's power slipping

Quito, Equador — The worst crisis in the 21-
year history of the Organization of Petroleum
Exporting Countries, although apparently over,
has seriously weakened the oil cartel and
isolated its most hard-line members.
OPEC's production ceilings are helping finally
to bring under control a major oil glut that had
been depressing prices, but the cartel has been
forced to cut its total production by about one
third since 1979 to prevent a price collapse. Pro
duction by OPEC's 13 members earlier this year
dipped below production by other non-com
munist countries for the first time, signaling a
major decline in OPEC's clout in world oil mar
kets.
As a result, OPEC's prices are likely to remain
frozen until the end of this year and possibly
beyond, despite forecasts of rising oil demand in
coming months, OPEC ministers and U.S. in
dustry and government oil specialists say. The
current period of price stability, which began in
January 1981, will almost certainly last longer
than the 18-month, OPEC price freeze in
1977-1978.
Industry analysts say OPEC's two most out
spoken supporters of higher prices in the past —
Libya and Iran — will have to wait for a major po
litical upheaval in the Middle East before prices
can rise again as dramatically as they did when
they more than doubled in the wake of the 1973
Arab-Israeli war and of the 1979 Iranian revolu
tion.
Meanwhile, these countries are having to sell
their oil at embarrassing discounts to keep
buyers who would prefer to deal with oil pro
ducers less likely to raise the price at the first sign
of a tighter market, according to OPEC and in
dustry sources.
OPEC oil ministers — here for a regular, semi
annual conference that ended here Friday —
publicly expressed confidence that the cartel's
production ceiling of 17.5 million barrels a day
had put OPEC back in control of world oil mar
kets. Some ministers, however, said their private
views were more guarded.
"Although the victory is in sight, OPEC has to
watch its action very carefully or let the victory
slip," Indonesian Oil Minister Subroto said.
The meeting extended the life of OPEC's first
formal production limits, which were adopted in
March to cope with the glut.
The ceilings have been credited with halting a
year-long slide in prices on spot oil markets,
which was undercutting OPEC's official prices
grouped around $34 a barrel. Spot oil prices are

for individual cargoes sold on the open market
and are regarded as a more accurate measure of
supply and demand than official OPEC prices,
which are used for long-term contracts.
The ceilings forced production cutbacks that
took some oil off the markets and encouraged a
bullish psychology among traders by giving the
impression that OPEC was acting assertively to
protect its interest.
The glut, which took hold firmly at the start of
last year, resulted from a combination of slack
demand caused by slow economic growth and
conservation measures and increased supplies
from non-OPEC members such as Mexico and
Britain. As spot prices fell, oil companies added
to the supply by draining inventories to avoid
being stuck with high-priced crude and to trim
financing charges.
To prop up prices, OPEC was forced to reduce
its production from an average of 30.5 million
barrels a day in 1979 to an expected 19.3 million
this year, according to Department of Energy fig
ures.
Demand for OPEC oil is expected to start ris
ing again in the second half of the year as com
panies replenish inventories and the U.S. econo
my revives. New demand would not push up
prices, however, but cause OPEC to start raising
its production again. With unused production
capacity of up to 10 million barrels a day left from
three years ago, demand would have to recover
considerably before prices could start spiraling,
U.S. oil executives say.
"You'll have to see a revolution before you get
a sharp jump in the price," one industry source
said.
Saudi Arabia, OPEC's largest producer and
traditionally its leading moderate, has 3.5 million
barrels a day of spare capacity and says it will use
it if necessary to prevent a sudden rise in the
price. Saudi Oil Minister Sheik Ahmed Zaki
Yamani has said he would like to see the current
$34 price stay unchanged through 1983.
In acting to keep prices unchanged, the Saudis
would undoubtedly draw criticism from hard
line OPEC members who are also the Saudis' po
litical rivals in the Arab world. But the Saudis
have shored up their image within the cartel this
year by threatening to cut their own production
as much as necessary to defend the prices and by
tolerating the current production ceilings. The-
Saudis have historically opposed formal OPEC "
ceilings, partly out of fear that the militants
might use them to push up prices artificially.
