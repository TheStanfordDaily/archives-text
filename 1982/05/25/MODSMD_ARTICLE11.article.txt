# Do you know... how a 'foot' was originally defined?
## 
### 
Wonder how a foot came to be 12 inches,
or how an inch was defined in the first place?
Our measurement system began in ancient
Egypt, and came to us via the British. Here are
some examples of the historical definitions of
our measuring units:
•Inch-the width of King Edgar's thumb
knuckle or three barleycorns laid end to end;
•Foot-the length of Charlemagne's foot, or 36
barleycorns;
•Yard-the distance from King Henry I's nose
to his fingertips;
•Cubit-half a yard, or the distance from
elbow to fingertip;
•Furlong-the length of a furrow a team of
oxen could plow before tiring;

•Acre-the total amount of land the oxen
could plow in one day;
•Mile-originally, 1000 double steps of a Ro
man legionary, later modified to equal eight
furlongs;
•Fathom-the span of a seaman's outstretched
arms.
These measurements are in use almost sole
ly in the United States — the rest of the world
uses the metric system. The meter was ori
ginally defined as one-ten-millionth the
length of the longitude from the North Pole
to the equator, but today is defined as
1,650,763.73 wavelengths of orange-red light
emitted by the krypton-86 atom. The meter
equals 39.37 inches or 118 barleycorns.
