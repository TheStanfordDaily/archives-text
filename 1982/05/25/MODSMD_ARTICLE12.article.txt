## Tips for summer travelers Getting around Europe inexpensively 
### Jennifer King 
You thought you couldn't afford to
go to Europe thissummer?
Think again.
At least that's what Rick Steves says
He first went to Europe on his own in
1973 on $3 per day. Today, the author of
the budget-travel guidebook Europe
Through the Back Door, says it is
possible to go on $20 per day plus
airfare.
Whether you are still undecided
about your summer plans or have
already decided on a trip, Steves has the
following advice for you:
The first thing to do is decide why you
want to go, and what you want to get
out of your trip. Then, you should buy
some books on Europe. (Of course
Steves would prefer that you buy his,
but there are many available books on
the market.)
Next, you should commit yourself to
a date by buying your plane ticket.
Prices can only go up during the
summer, so the sooner you get your
ticket, the better.
Going independently or with a friend
is the best way. "Europe is geared to the
independent traveler," Steves said.
"Travelling alone makes you more
approachable."
The most important aspect in
planning a trip is"attitude." Steves
stressed, "You should go with the right
attitude that you will accept people's
hospitality. Go determined to go local,
to learn about each culture."
In addition, a tourist should be sure
nottoact likean"ugly American."
Steves said that this is a common
problem. According to Steves, ugly
Americans are ethnocentric, judge
things by American standards, and
demand that American things be in
Europe. When going to Europe,
American visitors must go with the
attitude that they will try to fit in.
"People are creative worriers," said
Steves. "They worry about the language
barrier, money, theft, and anything else
they can think of." You should be on
the defensive, but don't let worrying
about what may happen hamperthe
enjoyment of your trip.
"Go with the idea that you will be
self-sufficient, not vulnerable," Steves
said.
When preparing for your trip, be sure
to pack light for safety and
convenience. A medium-sized
rucksack witha minimalamountof

casual clothing would suffice. Just a few
extras you may want to bring include a
hostel sheet (bedding), a money belt,
picnic supplies, a large poncho, a first
aid kit, and a journal so that you can
record your trip.
Other preparations include having a
check-up before you go, and changing
your currency in the United States.
Steves recommended planning a fast
paced itinerary. He said he believes in
"the curve of diminishing returns"
meaning that the longer you stay, the
less you may enjoy that certain place.
He advised seeing as many places as
possible, particularly if you have a very
limited time schedule.
He also recommended going without
reservations, even during the busy
summer seasons. This way you need not
be tied to a schedule, and you will most
likely find an out-of-the-way place
which will be more comfortable than a
well-known hotel.
However, Steves added that you
should be sure to check out events and
attractions once you arrive to make sure
vou don't miss anything. Healso
suggested to checking out the going
rate on merchandise and transportation
so you can be assured of being charged
the local price as opposed to the tourist
rate.
Once you arrive, your first tasks will
be to investigate the various modes of
lodging, travelling and dining.
For lodging, Steves suggested four
different places: youth hostels, bed and
breakfasts, trains and friends' homes.
Youth hostels are usually convenient
for a place to stay at the last minute, or if
you will bestayingforonlyashorttime.
Bed and breakfasts are more cozy.
They are usually run by a family who
takes in a minimum number of guests
each night. Forsstosl4pernight,you
can havea placetostayanda
homemade breakfast.
Friends, or even distant friends of
friends, are an invaluable resource for
getting a place to stay or for receiving
information about the area. Steves was
once able to stay with the father of his
sister's ski teacher. (How distant can
you get?)
If you really want to economize,
Steves suggested sleeping on the train.
He said that the Europeans have
conveniently placed their major cities
about 10 or 12 hours away from each
other, the perfect distance for travelling
at night.

Instead of getting a Eurailpass, Steves
suggested rentinga car. If a groupof
four or five are travelling together, this
is a more economical way to go. If you
will be travelling independently, you
might want tostick to a Eurailpass,
which allows unlimited train travel.
"Dining economically is easy," said
Steves. He had one word for
inexpensive eating: picnic. He usually
has a large picnic lunch and then a small
dinner at a local restaurant.
Do not look for restaurants which
cater to Americans. Look for restaurants
frequented by locals, he suggested.
Once inside, do not hesitate to ask the
waiter or other customers what to
order. This is not only a way to get good
food, but also a great way to make
friends.
For women travelling alone, Steves
had a few words of caution.
Unfortunately in the Southern
European countries, American women
have the "Hollywood image," he said.
Women may recieve verbal
harrassment because of this. But,
women shouldn't get shaken up and
should ignore any comments. There is
usually no danger of physical abuse,
according to Steves. Just be sure to
avoid any actionsor clothing which
could even be remotely perceived as
provoking.
In the Northern countries, women
are not perceived as they are in the
south, so harrassment is not a problem,
Steves said.
Steves stressed that the main thing a
traveler must do is havean open mind.
"You must be the catalyst and make
an effort to meet people. They want to
meet you, but you must break the ice,"
said Steves.
The tourist must be the first one to
establish communication. Language is
usually not a problem since English has
become somewhat of a universal
language. And if you can't
communicate through words, you can
trade dances or songs with others,
Steves said.
"Go with the determination to give as
much as takeculturally/'Stevesadded.
He still travels in Europe four months
out of every year to keep up on current
rates and conditions. In the Bay Area
this spring, Steves is teaching one-day
seminars on inexpensive European
travel.

have the "Hollywood image," he said.
Women may recieve verbal
harrassment because of this. But,
women shouldn't get shaken up and
should ignore any comments. There is
usually no danger of physical abuse,
according to Steves. Just be sure to
avoid any actionsor clothing which
could even be remotely perceived as
provoking.
In the Northern countries, women
are not perceived as they are in the
south, so harrassment is not a problem,
Steves said.
Steves stressed that the main thing a
traveler must do is havean open mind.
"You must be the catalyst and make
an effort to meet people. They want to
meet you, but you must break the ice,"
said Steves.
The tourist must be the first one to
establish communication. Language is
usually not a problem since English has
become somewhat of a universal
language. And if you can't
communicate through words, you can
trade dances or songs with others,
Steves said.
"Go with the determination to give as
much as takeculturally/'Stevesadded.
He still travels in Europe four months
out of every year to keep up on current
rates and conditions. In the Bay Area
this spring, Steves is teaching one-day
seminars on inexpensive European
travel.
You thought you couldn't afford to
go to Europe thissummer?
Think again.
At least that's what Rick Steves says
He first went to Europe on his own in
1973 on $3 per day. Today, the author of
the budget-travel guidebook Europe
Through the Back Door, says it is
possible to go on $20 per day plus
airfare.
Whether you are still undecided
about your summer plans or have
already decided on a trip, Steves has the
following advice for you:
The first thing to do is decide why you
want to go, and what you want to get
out of your trip. Then, you should buy
some books on Europe. (Of course
Steves would prefer that you buy his,
but there are many available books on
the market.)
Next, you should commit yourself to
a date by buying your plane ticket.
Prices can only go up during the
summer, so the sooner you get your
ticket, the better.
Going independently or with a friend
is the best way. "Europe is geared to the
independent traveler," Steves said.
"Travelling alone makes you more
approachable."
The most important aspect in
planning a trip is"attitude." Steves
stressed, "You should go with the right
attitude that you will accept people's
hospitality. Go determined to go local,
to learn about each culture."
In addition, a tourist should be sure
nottoact likean"ugly American."
Steves said that this is a common
problem. According to Steves, ugly
Americans are ethnocentric, judge
things by American standards, and
demand that American things be in
Europe. When going to Europe,
American visitors must go with the
attitude that they will try to fit in.
"People are creative worriers," said
Steves. "They worry about the language
barrier, money, theft, and anything else
they can think of." You should be on
the defensive, but don't let worrying
about what may happen hamperthe
enjoyment of your trip.
"Go with the idea that you will be
self-sufficient, not vulnerable," Steves
said.
When preparing for your trip, be sure
to pack light for safety and
convenience. A medium-sized
rucksack witha minimalamountof

casual clothing would suffice. Just a few
extras you may want to bring include a
hostel sheet (bedding), a money belt,
picnic supplies, a large poncho, a first
aid kit, and a journal so that you can
record your trip.
Other preparations include having a
check-up before you go, and changing
your currency in the United States.
Steves recommended planning a fast
paced itinerary. He said he believes in
"the curve of diminishing returns"
meaning that the longer you stay, the
less you may enjoy that certain place.
He advised seeing as many places as
possible, particularly if you have a very
limited time schedule.
He also recommended going without
reservations, even during the busy
summer seasons. This way you need not
be tied to a schedule, and you will most
likely find an out-of-the-way place
which will be more comfortable than a
well-known hotel.
However, Steves added that you
should be sure to check out events and
attractions once you arrive to make sure
vou don't miss anything. Healso
suggested to checking out the going
rate on merchandise and transportation
so you can be assured of being charged
the local price as opposed to the tourist
rate.
Once you arrive, your first tasks will
be to investigate the various modes of
lodging, travelling and dining.
For lodging, Steves suggested four
different places: youth hostels, bed and
breakfasts, trains and friends' homes.
Youth hostels are usually convenient
for a place to stay at the last minute, or if
you will bestayingforonlyashorttime.
Bed and breakfasts are more cozy.
They are usually run by a family who
takes in a minimum number of guests
each night. Forsstosl4pernight,you
can havea placetostayanda
homemade breakfast.
Friends, or even distant friends of
friends, are an invaluable resource for
getting a place to stay or for receiving
information about the area. Steves was
once able to stay with the father of his
sister's ski teacher. (How distant can
you get?)
If you really want to economize,
Steves suggested sleeping on the train.
He said that the Europeans have
conveniently placed their major cities
about 10 or 12 hours away from each
other, the perfect distance for travelling
at night.

Instead of getting a Eurailpass, Steves
suggested rentinga car. If a groupof
four or five are travelling together, this
is a more economical way to go. If you
will be travelling independently, you
might want tostick to a Eurailpass,
which allows unlimited train travel.
"Dining economically is easy," said
Steves. He had one word for
inexpensive eating: picnic. He usually
has a large picnic lunch and then a small
dinner at a local restaurant.
Do not look for restaurants which
cater to Americans. Look for restaurants
frequented by locals, he suggested.
Once inside, do not hesitate to ask the
waiter or other customers what to
order. This is not only a way to get good
food, but also a great way to make
friends.
For women travelling alone, Steves
had a few words of caution.
