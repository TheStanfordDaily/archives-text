# Life of a candidate's wife
## 
### Kathy Olmsted

The life of a politician's wife can be terribly
monotonous and unrewarding, filled with end
less luncheons, interviews and small talk with
hordes of unknown people.
Or it can be a chance to grow, to learn, and to
meet new people. At least that's how Patti Gar
amendi, wife of gubernatorial candidate and
State Senate Majority Leader John Garamendi,
regards her role as chief campaigner for her am
bitious young husband.
Garamendi said she welcomes the op
portunities to travel around the state to promote
her husband's candidacy for the democratic
gubernatorial nomination.

"You can fight it — there are a lot of can
didate's wives who fight it and complain a lot
about it," she said. "I'm just the opposite. I've
chosen to make it a growing part of my life, too."
Patti said she welcomes the frequent cam
paign stops and interviews which provide an op
portunity for her to discuss issues of concern to
her.
"I never feel like I'm in John's shadow," she
said. "I'm talking about issues that I care about
also."
Some of those issues are her husband's most
important campaign planks — opposition to the
Peripheral Canal and support of the bilateral nu
clear freeze initiative.
The Garamendis are also very concerned with
world hunger — an interest that dates to their
years as Peace Corp/ volunteers. Just after they
were married, they spent two years in a mud hut
in Ethiopia teaching English and community de
velopment to the natives.
Upon returning from Ethiopia, John attended
the Harvard Business School while Patti taught

music and African culture to ghetto childen in
Roxbury, Mass.
She said the environment of U.C. Berkeley in
the early 19605, where they both did their under
graduate work, was essential in fostering the
couple's motivation to follow these idealistic
pursuits.
"Our time at Berkeley was so crucial to setting
the tone of our whole lives," she said.
The example of former President John Ken
nedy inspired the Garamendis to join the Peace
Corps and later inspired John to enter politics,
she said. That fateful decision has led him on a
steadily upward path from state assemblyman, to
state senator, to senate majority leader, and now
to the leading challenger of Los Angeles mayor
Tom Bradley for the Democratic gubernatorial
nomination.
Garamendi said she is worried that the present
younger generation is so much less idealistic and
concerned about international problems than
her contemporaries at Berkeley 20 years ago
were. Saying that too often students are more
concerned about getting jobs than taking active
roles in politics, Garamendi said that her hus
band could have followed a more lucrative
course than the one he has chosen.
"John is a Harvard MBA. He could be doing
anything," she said.
The Garamendis want to ensure that their own
five children do not grow up apathetic about
world problems, she said. "Their first memories
are hunger marches."
But the Garamendi children are content with
their politically active lives, according to their
mother, even considering the pressures and me
dia attention involved in being the children of a
candidate for governor.
"They are the happiest, most squared-away
kids," she said.
Garamendi has still managed to maintain her
energy and optimism, in spite of the rigors of the
campaign trail.
"I have not been tired, I have not been dis
illusioned," she said.
A recent law school graduate, she said she will
begin to pursue her law career part-time after
the election is over. At the present time, Gar
amendi is not only a full-time campaign worker
and mother of five but also the president of the
Legislative Wives Club and active in many other
community groups.
John Garamendi's low standing in the polls
doesn't worry his strongest supporter, either.
"All the polls have managed to do is to make it
hard to raise money," she said. "They have not
dampened the enthusiasm of our supporters."
She categorically refuted charges that her hus
band entered the governor's race just to acquire
name recognition for a more important bid in
the future.
"It's just too much work to even consider
doing something like that," she said. "We're in it
to win, and we feel we have a very good chance
of winning."

couple's motivation to follow these idealistic
pursuits.
"Our time at Berkeley was so crucial to setting
the tone of our whole lives," she said.
The example of former President John Ken
nedy inspired the Garamendis to join the Peace
Corps and later inspired John to enter politics,
she said. That fateful decision has led him on a
steadily upward path from state assemblyman, to
state senator, to senate majority leader, and now
to the leading challenger of Los Angeles mayor
Tom Bradley for the Democratic gubernatorial
nomination.
Garamendi said she is worried that the present
younger generation is so much less idealistic and
concerned about international problems than
her contemporaries at Berkeley 20 years ago
were. Saying that too often students are more
concerned about getting jobs than taking active
roles in politics, Garamendi said that her hus
band could have followed a more lucrative
course than the one he has chosen.
"John is a Harvard MBA. He could be doing
anything," she said.
The Garamendis want to ensure that their own
five children do not grow up apathetic about
world problems, she said. "Their first memories
are hunger marches."
But the Garamendi children are content with
their politically active lives, according to their
mother, even considering the pressures and me
dia attention involved in being the children of a
candidate for governor.
"They are the happiest, most squared-away
kids," she said.
Garamendi has still managed to maintain her
energy and optimism, in spite of the rigors of the
campaign trail.
"I have not been tired, I have not been dis
illusioned," she said.
A recent law school graduate, she said she will
begin to pursue her law career part-time after
the election is over. At the present time, Gar
amendi is not only a full-time campaign worker
and mother of five but also the president of the
Legislative Wives Club and active in many other
community groups.
John Garamendi's low standing in the polls
doesn't worry his strongest supporter, either.
"All the polls have managed to do is to make it
hard to raise money," she said. "They have not
dampened the enthusiasm of our supporters."
She categorically refuted charges that her hus
band entered the governor's race just to acquire
name recognition for a more important bid in
the future.
"It's just too much work to even consider
doing something like that," she said. "We're in it
to win, and we feel we have a very good chance
of winning."
