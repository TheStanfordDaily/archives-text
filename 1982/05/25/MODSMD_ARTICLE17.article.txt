## Students lack experience 
### 
Now that summer is only a few short weeks away, it is a
good time to look back on the academic year. One ad
vantage to being a transfer student is having the op
portunity to compare two different academic worlds.
One really striking difference I have noticed is Stanford's
total lack of emphasis on experiential education, that is,
learning in a non-academic environment. This repre
sents a gaping hole in Stanford's curriculum. Of all the
programs which enrich the educational process, there is
perhaps not one as challenging and rewarding as work
ing and learning in an outside institution.
Stanford should move to establish a central program
which puts students in schools, businesses and trades, as
an exercise which not only furthers career goals but
which also encourages experimentation.We will per
haps never again in our lives get the opportunity to teach
in a high school, work with psychiatric patients, or follow
a doctor around a hospital. These may sound like bizarre
ways to spend a couple of days a week, but they do ac
tually appeal to some people.
There are programs here which do all of these things
and more. The Student Center for Innovation in Re
search and Education (SCIRE), Stanford Workshops on
Political and Social Issues (SWOPSI), Undergraduate Pro
grams at the School of Education (UPSE) and the pre-pro
fessional advising office are just some of th® campus or
ganizations which provide experiences that are worth
while. Unfortunately they are grossly underadvertised.
This seems to indicate a lack of university support, so
critical to any program's success. At some schools, these
programs always have a waiting list.
As it stands now, an individual student could probably
obtain credit for any one of the things listed above. But
there are many reasons for establishing a permanent
central program which places students in experiential
learning opportunities. First, a program would alert a
much greater proportion of the student body to these
kinds of opportunities. Secondly, those who only have a
casual interest or are pressed for time can find out about
other people's experiences and be placed in their own
position with a minimum amount of time and effort. A
program also attracts students who may not have enough
self-confidence to establish their own positions. It also
allows people to arrange car pools so that students

without cars can get off campus more quickly arid easily
From the point of view of the on-site coordinators, the
program screens applicants and takes care of adminis
trative details so they don't have to. Furthermore, stu
dents have a way of working themelves into helpful and
interesting spots that can only be found through trial and
error.
This list of advantages is fine once we assume ex
periential education is good; if that's not the case, I may
be saddling a dead horse. However, once I think about it,
experiential education is not good, it's great. It breaks up
the week and is a regular opprtunity to get off campus, it
forces one to deal with new people and new situ
ations,(excellent preparation for the job market, I might
add). And, a valuable recommendation is always a possi
bility.
How many people graduate from Stanford without
any idea of how to get comfortable in a work situation,
define their objectives, and make the experience work
for them? I would argue that it's one of the most impor
tant and yet overlooked skills that one can possess.
To some degree, this problem is really not our fault as
students. For some reason, Stanford has a definite aca
demic or technical rather than vocational bias. For in
stance, there is no undergraduate business school here.
The Nursing and Architectural schools were also cut out
a few years back. Far fewer engineering students here
seem to go on "Coops" (working for a company under
the aegis of an academic program) than at other schools.
There is definitely a consistent theme to be found among
these examples. Who knows why; maybe programs
which teach you skills (rather than knowledge) are too
pedestrian for Stanford. Or, maybe we are assumed to be
so academically prepared when we leave Stanford that
we can skip all the experimentation that is routine to fin
ding a job, and instead move right into the perfect ca
reer.
Whatever the reason, there is definitely a contradic
tion to be found in Stanford's policy toward hands-on
experience. One can obtain credit for almost any job
which is self-arranged. But, there is no official en
couragement nor are any special arrangements made to
systematize or generalize the availability of the op
portunity. It doesn't make sense. Experiential education
is an important part of the learning process and should
be incorporated into the curriculum. In fact, it should be
one of the distribution requirements. It is too valuable an
experience to miss, especially when we are in an area
which is absolutely rich with potential.

Now that summer is only a few short weeks away, it is a
good time to look back on the academic year. One ad
vantage to being a transfer student is having the op
portunity to compare two different academic worlds.
One really striking difference I have noticed is Stanford's
total lack of emphasis on experiential education, that is,
learning in a non-academic environment. This repre
sents a gaping hole in Stanford's curriculum. Of all the
programs which enrich the educational process, there is
perhaps not one as challenging and rewarding as work
ing and learning in an outside institution.
Stanford should move to establish a central program
which puts students in schools, businesses and trades, as
an exercise which not only furthers career goals but
which also encourages experimentation.We will per
haps never again in our lives get the opportunity to teach
in a high school, work with psychiatric patients, or follow
a doctor around a hospital. These may sound like bizarre
ways to spend a couple of days a week, but they do ac
tually appeal to some people.
There are programs here which do all of these things
and more. The Student Center for Innovation in Re
search and Education (SCIRE), Stanford Workshops on
Political and Social Issues (SWOPSI), Undergraduate Pro
grams at the School of Education (UPSE) and the pre-pro
fessional advising office are just some of th® campus or
ganizations which provide experiences that are worth
while. Unfortunately they are grossly underadvertised.
This seems to indicate a lack of university support, so
critical to any program's success. At some schools, these
programs always have a waiting list.
As it stands now, an individual student could probably
obtain credit for any one of the things listed above. But
there are many reasons for establishing a permanent
central program which places students in experiential
learning opportunities. First, a program would alert a
much greater proportion of the student body to these
kinds of opportunities. Secondly, those who only have a
casual interest or are pressed for time can find out about
other people's experiences and be placed in their own
position with a minimum amount of time and effort. A
program also attracts students who may not have enough
self-confidence to establish their own positions. It also
allows people to arrange car pools so that students

without cars can get off campus more quickly arid easily
From the point of view of the on-site coordinators, the
program screens applicants and takes care of adminis
trative details so they don't have to. Furthermore, stu
dents have a way of working themelves into helpful and
interesting spots that can only be found through trial and
error.
This list of advantages is fine once we assume ex
periential education is good; if that's not the case, I may
be saddling a dead horse. However, once I think about it,
experiential education is not good, it's great. It breaks up
the week and is a regular opprtunity to get off campus, it
forces one to deal with new people and new situ
ations,(excellent preparation for the job market, I might
add). And, a valuable recommendation is always a possi
bility.
How many people graduate from Stanford without
any idea of how to get comfortable in a work situation,
define their objectives, and make the experience work
for them? I would argue that it's one of the most impor
tant and yet overlooked skills that one can possess.
To some degree, this problem is really not our fault as
students. For some reason, Stanford has a definite aca
demic or technical rather than vocational bias. For in
stance, there is no undergraduate business school here.
The Nursing and Architectural schools were also cut out
a few years back. Far fewer engineering students here
seem to go on "Coops" (working for a company under
the aegis of an academic program) than at other schools.
There is definitely a consistent theme to be found among
these examples. Who knows why; maybe programs
which teach you skills (rather than knowledge) are too
pedestrian for Stanford. Or, maybe we are assumed to be
so academically prepared when we leave Stanford that
we can skip all the experimentation that is routine to fin
ding a job, and instead move right into the perfect ca
reer.
Whatever the reason, there is definitely a contradic
tion to be found in Stanford's policy toward hands-on
experience. One can obtain credit for almost any job
which is self-arranged. But, there is no official en
couragement nor are any special arrangements made to
systematize or generalize the availability of the op
portunity. It doesn't make sense. Experiential education
is an important part of the learning process and should
be incorporated into the curriculum. In fact, it should be
