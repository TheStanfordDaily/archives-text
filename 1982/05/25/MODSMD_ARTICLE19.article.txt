## Making summer count: invest meaning in daylight savings 
### 
Washington — For some reason, perhaps
in honor of their youth, many Americans still
look forward to summer. Pools open.
Friends return. Everything seems to hold
promise.
Then, as quickly as the pavement soaks in
the sun, the season loses its luster. Summer
jobs fail to materialize or meet expectations.
Idleness sets in; nearly everything seems a
chore.
Fewer Americans are harboring the false
hopes of summer this year. In reminding us
of the intertia we always experience, the
economy has already ruined the summer of
1982. It's now only a question of how we'll
pass the time.
For one, we'll make the most of small vic
tories. Satisfaction for some will come from
keeping the lawn mowed, growing tomatoes
and finding shade. For others, rising before

10 a.m. will be a major accomplishment.
Yet, for the most part, we'll pass the sum
mer sharing these and other mundane mat
ters in conversation with friends. Summers
mean long hours of idle chatter. If, as a rule,
we're a "nation of big talkers," we do our
best when it's hot and sticky.
In a lull, talk takes on interesting patterns:
we indulge in our past and our futures, but
our sense of the here-and-now is often a
matter of trivial observations.
That this never changes is evident in the
sleeper film "Diner." Set in Baltimore during
the Christmas season of 1959, the story of six
men in their early 20s — some in school,
some not; some married, some not — could
have been shot in Phoenix or Jacksonville
(with modifications, of course) last week.
Like the anxious young men who hash out
their lives each night at the Fells Point Diner,

we're also obsessed with ambition, pop stars,
sports and the opposite sex. While Johnny
Mathis and the Baltimore Colts have faded,
other names have risen to take a place in our
lives.
How we talk with our friends seems no less
contradictory today than it does in the film.
We laugh to hear the guys pow-wow on
back-seat tactics, but our mood quickly
changes when one fellow admits that he
"can't hold a five-minute conversation" with
his wife. This incomplete sense of intimacy
isn't alleviated when another of the Fells
Point gang advises, "If you want to talk, you
don't need a girl. You always got the guys at
the diner."
We can see plain enough, however, that
the guys suffer from a worn-out dependency
on each other. They languish in an all-too fa
miliar boat of confusion about the present

and uncertainty about the future. There's a
flash of deja vu when, in chancing upon a
wealthy woman on horseback, the most re
bellious fellow asks, "Did you ever get the
feeling that there's something going on that
we don't know about?"
While our friends seem to agree on how to
entertain themselves, they're unable to
articulate — let alone make sense of — any
larger purpose in life. Like so many of us,
they wallow instead in old habits, deriving
sustenance from their fantasies. As one ex
plains, "If you don't have dreams, you can
get nightmares."
We felt lucky, upon leaving the theater, to
find that December 1959 had given way to
May 1982. A bit too much taboo and mystery
clouded the interaction between men and

women in those days. Who wouldn't have
felt suffocated under the circumstances?
But one can't say that we're vastly im
proved in our ability to sort our life beyond
baseball, dope and — dare we say it — mov
ies. If there's politics, art and love to be dis
cussed, leave it to the Europeans.
Perhaps widespread anticipation of free
time this summer — and then the countless
hours themselves — will tranform us from
idle chatterboxes into clearer thinkers.
Though it won't be easy to reach higher than
matters of sweet corn and gas prices, we may
owe ourselves every effort. It will make the
summer of 1982 worth remembering.
