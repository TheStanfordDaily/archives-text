# Students stay cool
## Air conditioning shutdown delayed 
### Michael Weiss 
A renovation of the University's chilled water system
that would have caused a 48-hour shutdown of all Uni
versity air conditioning for two days this week has been
postponed to the week of June 14, after commence
ment.
According to Kurt Williams, manager of engineering
in the Facilities Department, the postponement came
because of the inconvenience it would have caused to
students preparing for finals. The shutdown was ori
ginally scheduled from midnight today to midnight
Thursday.
Jerry Ostander, the director of utilities systems here,
said, "The major conflict was with several of the com
puter systems. We could not guarantee that they would
stay open."
Only two University buildings, the Forsythe Building,
which houses computers, and the Medical Center,
would have continued to receive air conditioning if the
shutdown had occurred. They would have been sup
plied with chilled water, which is what cools the air, from
a 4 million-gallon underground storage tank that would
have continued to operate despite the shutdown of the
main chilled water tank.
"It's a matter of losing lives at the Medical Center, and
losing billions of dollars at the Forsythe Building," said
Fritz Beyer, manager of the Steam and Chilled Water Dis
tribution System.

Forsythe would have received air conditioning for the
entire two-day period, while the Medical School would
have felt the shutdown only from midnight tonight to 8
a.m. tomorrow, during which no problems would have
been caused, said Beyer.
Beyer explained that computers generally raise the
temperature of their surrounding by 15 degrees. If the
computer centers had been allowed to stay open
without air conditioning, the increased temperature
would be extremely harmful to the systems.
Beyer explained that the reason for the shutdown was
so that the pipes that carried chilled water to the various
air-conditioned sites around campus could be replaced.
The old pipes averaged two breakdowns per summer,
and three per year, he said.
The material of which the old pipes were made up had
been designed for use in outer space, Beyer said. "They
work in outer space, but not with gravity pushing on
them." The pipes run approximately 1250 feet and vary
from 24 to 30 inches in diameter.
Beyer said that planning for the project, which has a
$600,000 budget, began a year ago, and that construction
of new pipes running parallel to the old ones and made
of more durable material began in March. According to
Ostander, they had anticipated that the new pipes would
be completed and tied into the chilled water system by
April. "Unfortunately we were held up because of the
bad weather," Ostrander said.
Last week, when the project was
still scheduled to start tonight, Beyer
had said that this week was the last
feasible time to do the renovation
because it would be too hot during
the summer. He said the
meteorology company that serves
Stanford had predicted a cooling
trend for this week.
Ostrander said they would just
have to hope for a cooling trend in
June. He said that there was an ad
vantage to doing the job the week af
ter commencement in that "the cam
pus is fairly empty" that week.
Along with the air conditioning
shut-down, the job also entails the
closing off of Serra Street near Via
Crespi, which is where the new pipes
will be tied into the system. He said
the police and fire departments
would handle the road blockage, and
that the Marguerite buses would be
rerouted.

Kurt Williams said there would bea
small increase in cost due to the delay
because much equipment would
have to be removed and then
brought back again in June. Other
than that, he said, administrators in
the Facilities Department were a little
disappointed because they wanted
to get the project finished as early
before summer as possible.
