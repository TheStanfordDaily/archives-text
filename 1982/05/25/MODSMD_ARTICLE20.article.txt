## Error damages Daily's credibility 
### 
The Daily's coverage of
Nicaraguan Ambassador Francisco
Fiallo's May 19 talk was shockingly in
accurate and potentially dangerous.
In a front page article Fiallo was at

tributed with stating that Nicaragua
would "continue to supply the rebels
(in El Salvador) with arms." In fact,
however, Fiallo made clear
statements to the contrary, and in

deed outlined the reasons why the
Nicaraguan government had de
cided not to extend military aid to the
Salvadoran rebel forces.
Whatever the reasons for this gross
misrepresentation of the am
bassador's remarks, the conse
quences — both potential and actual
— are severe. At worst, the Daily
story may be picked up by other
newspapers or the wire services, add
ing confusion and tension to an al
ready strained international situ
ation. In addition such coverage may
dicourage other speakers from ap
pearing at Stanford. Justifiably, they
might fear that their comments
would be inaccurately reported to
the non-attending university com
munity.
At the very least, the article severe
ly damages the Daily's credibility.
One is left wondering what other
events have suffered the same treat
ment.
What is even more disturbing,
however, is the Daily's reluctance to
print a serious retraction. True, a
short paragraph "correcting" the er
ror appeared on the last page of Fri
day's edition under the appropriate
heading of "Briefly." But while a
back page errata may be suitable for
rectifying minor mistakes in spelling,
dates, etc., it is hardly sufficient for
such a serious blunder. Instead, the
Daily should have printed a full refac
tion in the same space where the arti
cle originally appeared.
The Daily seems unaware of either
the power it wields as Stanford's mos:
widely-read daily publication or the
responsibility this status entails. Pity.
One would hope that it would take
itself more seriously.
