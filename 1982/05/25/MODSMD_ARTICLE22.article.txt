## Grad housing issue is rent, not location 
### 
I would like to respond briefly to
President Donald Kennedy's remark
(in the May 21 Daily) that Stanford
"houses more of its graduate stu
dents than any of the institutions with
which it competes." This is mislead
ing. While it may be strictly true, it ig
nores the rental housing markets in
which various universities are lo
cated.
During part of my stay at the Mas
sachusetts Institute of Technology, I
lived in a splendid apartment only 10
walking minutes from campus, for
$120 per month. Off-campus rents
here are roughtly twice that figure.
The real issue of graduate student
housing at Stanford is not location,
but price. I do not mind living off
campus. But with on-campus rents
running $100/ month below off-cam
pus rents, I would rather pay the low
er price.
Kennedy's statement is a half
truth; it ignores the severe price dif
ferentials present in off-campus
housing among "the institutions with
which (Stanford) competes."

Support for Frolov
We would like to thank the Daily
for publicizing the effort of Stanford
student Lois Becker Frolov to obtain
the release of her husband Andrei
from the Soviet Union after nearly a
year of involuntary separation.
In recent years, it has become in
creasingly difficult for Soviet citizens
who are married to foreigners to
leave the Soviet Union to live with
their spouses. In cases where per
mission to emigrate has been
granted, it is often after months or
even years of frustration, harassment,
and uncertainty. This is the situation
that has led the Frolovs to take such
drastic action.

As their hunger strike enters it sec
ond week, it is even more urgent that
the Stanford community demon
strate support for their action by writ
ing American and Soviet officials.
We would like to point out that the
Frolovs are only one of several
couples who are in this situation.
Your letters support not only their ef
forts at this time, but will also protest
the Soviet government's practice of
preventing the reunification of fami
lies.

Nicaragua speech
The (Daily May 19) report of the
talk by the Nicaraguan ambassador to
the United States, Dr. Francisco
Fiallos, began with a most un
fortunate and damaging inaccuracy.
Fiallos did not say that the
Nicaraguan government has sup
plied arms to El Salvadoran rebels
and will continue to do so. He made a
very clear and very strong statement
to the contrary. The Nicaraguan gov
ernment, he said, has never supplied
arms to the rebels and does not in
tend to do so in the future. Fiallos ac
knowledged that weapons for El
Salvadoran guerillas have probably
crossed through the country.
Nicaragua's border with Honduras is
long and virtually impossible to con
trol.
Those not present at the talk will be
left with the impression that the Rea
gan administration is justified in its
claim that Nicaragua officially sanc
tions such support of El Salvadoran
rebels. This has been its central, al
though never documented, argu
ment for our relentless hostility
toward Nicaragua. Fiallos clearly re
pudiated that claim.

8 to 5 is paradise
Joe Kennedy's column "Farm life
to reality" (Daily, May 21) described
undergraduate life at Stanford as a
paradise. Kennedy stated that out
side of classtime, our time is largely
our own and that few of us put in a
40-hour week studying. Unreality
permeates our lives, according to
Kennedy.
Well unreality almost certainly
permeates Kennedy; I don't share his
view that Stanford is a paradise, and I
don't think I'm alone. Kennedy's
argument that Stanford students
have "all that leisure time" intrigues
me.
He should go to LOTS in the
middle of the night anytime this
week and ask the students there how
they feel about his theory. I don't
think he would get many polite re
sponses. Indeed all the dreaded
eight-to-five working experiences
I've had have been very reasonably
pleasant. Work stopped at 5 p.m. and
you could forget about work until
the next morning. Here at Stanford,
people just don't seem to do that.
I agree that Stanford life is in gen
eral a very sheltered one. But right
now that eight-to-five work day is
looking awfully nice.
