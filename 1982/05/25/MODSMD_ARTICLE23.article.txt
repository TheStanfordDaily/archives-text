## 'Spring Migration' 
### Katie Smith 
Spring Migration. The name may conjure up images of geese
heading north but the reality was a flock of the Dance Division's
wing-footed performers and top-flight choreographers. From the
balcony of Robie Studio, the audience got a bird's-eye view.
This year's forum for student dance prowess reinforced the fact
that the Dance Department is one of the University's most
creatively productive and under-credited programs. The com
positions proved themselves essays graphic in style and indelible
in theme — "movement as communication" being far more com
plex than its current "athletics" categorization assumes.
From the opening piece which featured 14 students to the clos
ing number danced by four departmental instructors, the show
oozed talent and treated the audience to a variety of pace and ex
pression. Some pieces were sustained by mood alone while oth
ers turned on plot tension.
The first two compositions capitalized on atmosphere. "Eddy
ing," was choreographed by instructor Jancy Limpert who turned
dancers' bodies into continuous swirling waves and set the
rhythm of the flow to a watery suite by Roger Kellaway. In "Echoes
of Accord," the next number, choreographer Elizabeth Gustafson
changed the tempo, letting J. S. Bach accompany what seemed a
madrigal dance of courtly spirits.
"Mika," the evening's only pure solo was of a much more dra
matic school. Choreographed and performed by Nina Farana, the
piece was a powerful portrayal of any beings' fear of
metamorphosis. Dancing to a Vaughn Williams exerpt from Fan
tasia, Farana set near-crippling limits on her use of horizontal and
vertical space, most of her movement taking place within a 10-
foot radius on hands and knees. Nevertheless, her performance
emerged the evening's most suspenseful and fluid.
Another successful drama was Martha Carter's "Scintillations."
Accompanied by harpist Ruth Bonaparte, the number opened
with an introspective solo by Carter who was later joined by her
conscience in the form of Iris Lepnis and Amy McDonald. Three
of Spring Migration's strongest dancers, Carter, Lepnis and
McDonald synchronized and syncopated beautifully.
Besides providing atmosphere and drama, the evening's enter
tainment displayed a wonderful sense of humor. "Love Suite," "
... And in Books" and "Cabal," all brought smiles to the faces of
audience members. "Cabal," the second part of a dance trilogy
choreographed by Inga Weiss, let the imagination roam free with
visions of bats and hobgoblins. Clad in spooky black tights and
turbans, Leslee Lewis, Limpert and Julienne Weston, made the
most of special lighting effects and creaturish movements.
"Love Suite," the most elaborate piece in terms of cast size, was
choreographed by Diane Freccero and featured Tracey Minkin in
an athleticly amusing depiction of adolescent love games. Finally,
"... And in Books" proved that the artistic director, Weiss, had
truly saved the best until last. Clothed in New Wave's best and
brightest, Freccero, Limpert, Lewis and Weston, pranced in
novative steps to the music of Talking Heads. Choreographer
Weston effectively captured both the sense of conformity within
a trend and the larger scale social isolation such group mentality
dictates.
The performers were chosen at campus-wide auditions earlier
this spring.
