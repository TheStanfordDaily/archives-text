# 'Hansel and Gretel' in Oakland
## Fairy tales, ballet don't mix

"Hansel and Gretel" at the Oakland Ballet
was a pleasing diversion but not much more.
Weaknesses in the story line, costumes, and
music overrode the moments of graceful
dancing. Inany case, this ballet is for children,
not for us crotchety Critics with our High
Standards.
Is it necessary for ballets based on fairy
tales to water down their source material?
Such was the case with "Beauty and the
Beast" at the San Francisco Ballet two weeks
ago. Beast's patient, long-suffering nature
was discarded in favor of a more aggressive,
demanding quality; there appeared to be no
reason for love to gradually plant itself in
Beauty's heart.
In Oakland's "Hansel and Gretel," the
threatening forest found in the original fairy
tale did not appear; instead, there was an
enchanted forest full of friendly animals and
cute gnomes. The brutal, rejecting mother of
the original tale became a basically loving
woman who happened to scold her kids. The
witch was wacky and melodramatic, not truly
evil.
It's unfortunate when all the punch is
drained out of these stories because children
are bound to find them far less entrancing. In
his wonderful book on fairy-tales Bruno Bet
telheim shows how these stories heip chil
dren to work through their fears and anx

ieties. Choreographers should retain this
potency.
Children probably would not remark on
the undigestible, patchwork music for this
"Hansel and Gretel," but even they might
have sensed its lack of satisfying ebb and flow.
The score was culled from various works by
various composers — Glazunov, Hum
perdinch, Handel. Unfortunately, being
without a live orchestra prevented Oakland
from cutting, transposing, and re-arranging;
nevertheless, the end product might have
been more homogeneous (a virtue found in
Christensen's "Beauty and the Beast").
The choreography for this production was
run-of-the-mill, though frequently well
danced. The classical steps were strung to
gether in familiar ways — nothing startling or
unusually eye-catching. As Hansel and
Gretel, Daniel Ray and Julie Lowe were well
matched; their bodies go well together and
they look like brother and sister. Both of
them dance with a rounded spaciousness,
and their distressful pas de deux in Act II was
affecting.
All in all, this production made me ques
tion the appropriateness of ballet for in
terpretating fairy tales. I can imagine choreo
grapher Taylor — with his multiplicity of
styles, his humor, and his sense of the
ominous — devising a very effective "Beauty
and the Beast" or "Hansel and Gretel." But
would it appeal to children?"
