# Power pop of 'Asia': blatantly commercial

Asia drummer Carl Palmer
flexed his biceps and raised his
fists numerous times during
the band's Friday night concert
at the Warfield in San Francis
co, He should ... he's making
mtjney for the first time in
about 10 years.
Coming off of five dis
astrous albums with the now
defunct Emerson, Lake and
Palmer, Palmer has joined this
well-journeyed bunch of
progressive rock all-stars to
form one of the most blatantly
commercial bands in recent
mintory. Asia is power pop at
its overblown finest, calculated
to sell millions of records and

bring thousands of 12 to 18-
year-olds to their feet at con
certs. The result? It is and they
are.
The band as a whole retains
very few of the progressive/art
rock elements that made each
member a popular player in
the first place. The band's vo
calist and bass player John Wet
ton is coming off a three-year
stint with U.K., another all-star
band, but one that stayed with
its progressive roots to pro
duce two very fine studio
albums. Guitarist Steve Howe's
cosmic doodlings gave Yes its
trademark sound for over 10
years, and keyboard player
Geoffrey Downes played on
Yes's album after being a driv
ing force in Buggies, a mildly
popular British band.
Despite sticking very close to

the album's arrangements,
practically every tune from the
band brought the sold out
crowd to its feet. Grand key
board crescendos wrapped
around Wetton's throaty vocals
and Howe's twisted, fleeting
riffs kept them coming back for
more.
The show's opening was fit
ting for this brand of bombastic
pop. The band appeared from
behind a black curtain in casu
al, 21st Century space garb and
launched into some deluxe
power chords that evolved into
"Sole Survivor," a song about a
nasty journey to Hades or
something like that. Nobody
really cares about these words,
its the hook they like. Try it:
"Soooooooooooole Survivorr
rrr." Catch huh?
The band was barely rolling

when they broke for the eve
ning's highlight, a Steve Howe
15-minute, three song acoustic
solo, demonstrating his
brilliance and sensitivity. Howe
can be incredibly fluid one mo
ment, then amaze with raw
speech; he rarely misses a note.
Whoops of recognition came
from all over the theatre when
he launched into "Mood for a
Day," note for note off of solo
on Yes's live "Yessongs."
Not to be outdone, Palmer
did his own loud and fast drum
solo, Wetton a soppy ballad
and Downes twiddled alone on
the keyboards for awhile.
Aside from the solo efforts
and a few jams, Asia played
only one new piece not found
on th e debut album. Gathered
around Downe's impressive
battery of keyboards, all four

band members, with the help
of a tape machine, stretched
out and expanded a short
progression into a full blown
progressive piece, reminiscent
of old Yes and ELP material.
But the tunes are catchy and
therein lies Asia's success. Yes,
ELP and Genesis (in the Peter
Gabriel days) never made pre
tense at accessibility and never
really sold a whole lot of
albums. Asia's music is ac
cessible, tightly played, well
produced and after about five
times on the turntable and
once in concert.. . boring.
That hasn't yet kept Journey
and Foreigner from living at
the top of the charts â€” and I
don't suppose it will keep Asia
away either.
