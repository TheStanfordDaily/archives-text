# 'The Godfather'as comedy of menace
## 
### Steve Vineberg 
John Mackenzie, the direc
tor of The Long Good Friday,
has a quiet style that seems off
hand at first; then the small,
jagged bits of Barrie Keeffe's
script slide swiftfy Into place,
and you realize how carefully
the film has been crafted. The
Long Good Friday Is a modest
picture, but it's offbeat and
consistently intelligent. Harold
Shand (Bob Hoskins, star of the
BBC Pennies frohn Heaven
series) has thrust tjimself up
from his slum roots to captain
the biggest gahgster-run
network in London. He has
eliminated or cowed all rivals,
has politicians and policemen
in his employ, and is about to
clinch the most ambitious deal
of his career: a transatlantic
corporation that allies him with
the American Mafia. The film
begins with the arrival of the
American connection, Charlie
(Eddie Constantihe) and his
lawyer Tony (Stephen Davies),
and charts the descent of one
of the most powerful men in
England as Shand's associates
are killed off and his property
destroyed by an unknown ene
my. It's The Godfather in re
verse.
Mackenzie and Keeffe have
found new approaches to an
old genre. The Long Good Fri

day may not be novel in pres
enting a vision of big business
as gansterism, or in showing
the modern e)cpansion of the
underworld i#o the interna
tional scene ■§■ The Godfather,
Part II did all that — but no one
has ever dealt with these issues
comically before. The fim
makers get laughs out of
Shand's blustery dominance of
the London scene, and as his
power begins to s'ip away from
him and'his bulldog bellig
erence is inadequate to coping
with the enormity of the crisis,
Shand becomes funnier. The
thin ice of diplomacy cracks in
the final clash between Shand
and his would-be partners: the
Englishman and the Americans
tell each other what they really
think — Charlie and Tony say
that England is a banana re
public, and Shand responds
with an attack on big-talking,
sloppy Yankees. It must be the
most hilarious face-off in the
history of gangster movies.
It takes a while to get used to
Bob Hoskins' aggressive acting,
and to see that he's not simply
trying to make a virtue out of
gruffness: he's actually creat
ing a very specific character.
Shand's ghetto background
sticks out; he eats at the finest
restaurants (he owns most of

them, it seems) and lives in a
penthouse, but he doesn't
seem comfortable in the high
life. (There's a neat sequence in
which Harold returns to the
slums in search of information
and admires the ingenuity of
hard-boiled 12-year-olds who
charge him protection money
for parking his fancy car on the
street.) His girl friend, Victoria,
began a few rungs further up
the social ladder — perhaps
that accounts in part for his at
traction to her — and she's sub
tler, more patient, and a lot
smarter. (She also seems to be
genuinely in love with him.) As
Victoria, Helen Mirren — she
was Morgan Le Fey in last year's
Excalibur and Rosalind in the
BBC As You Like It — gives a
solid performance, and, vJth
her Julie Christie hairstyle, she
looks absolutely smashing.
The movie is by no means
perfect. Every now and then,
Mackenzie can't resist an artsy
shot (Phil Meheux did the
handsome photography), and
one or two violent sequences
are excessively gaudy. There
are flaws in the acting, too,
though for the most part it is
nicely modulated and convinc
ing. Mackenzie must have
wanted Eddie Constantine for
the associations European au

diences might have with him:
he played Peter Cheyney's de
tective hero Lemmy Caution in
a series of French thrillers be
ginning in 1953. (He is now 65.)
But despite his hefty presence
and that great granite face, he
isn't much of an actor, and his
scenes are a little painful.
In depicting Shand as a sort
of hoodlum Winston
Churchill, Mackenzie, Keeffe
and Hoskins send up British
stick-to-itiveness, and the
film's most unusual twist turns
out to be a political one: the
real threat in this story is the
IRA, They terrify even the cops
and the city councillors;
"Those boyos don't know the
rules," Parky, Shand's top con
tact on the force, tells Harold.
(Dave King is terrific in this
role.) The England of The Long
Good Friday, for which Harold
i Shand is a clever metaphor, is
falling apart despite every ef
' fort of tough-sounding
jingoists to hold it together. In
the end, all of Shand's guns and
paid flunkies are as useless as
the slogans and nostalgia in
john Osborne's The Enter
tainer, a portrait of Britain in an
earlier epoch: the decay con
tinues. The Long Good Friday
provides a cruel insider's view
of a country on the wane.
