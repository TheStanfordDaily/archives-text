# Police Investigating rape suspect
## 
### 
Stanford police are investigating
whether an East Palo Alto Navy man
who was arrested after a campus as
sault at UC-Berkeley nearly two
weeks ago and who has been
charged with attempted rape in con
nection with a Palo Alto attack might
have been involved in the series of
rapes here this year.
According to Stanford Police Chief
Marvin Herrington, police are trying
to assemble a personal or photo line
up for victims of campus assaults.
"That will tell us if we have any
thing to go on," Herrington said.
Herrington said the description of
the Berkeley suspect, Petty Officer
Second Class Kenneth Dwayne
Bailey, was similar to the descriptions
given by assault victims here.
At the time of the Berkeley attack,

Bailey was tree on $10,UUU bail on two
other rape charges.
Herrington said that police "cer
tainly have no way of knowing specif
ically whether he's the person or not.
"The only thing that will tell the
tale is whether or not one of the vic
tims can identify him," Herrington
said.
"But the fact that he meets the
general description that we're look
ing at and does have the tie with this
area makes it possible" that he was
connected with the Stanford rapes.
"He's worth looking at," Herrington
said.
He said that the line-up would be
conducted in the near future to pre
vent any possibility that the victims
might see Bailey in another situation.
Bailey, 25, is being held in Alameda

County Jail.
Berkeley campus police allege that
Bailey attacked a Berkeley student
early in the evtring of May 11. Dur
ing the attack, the victim allegdly bit

pensary with part of his tongue miss
ing.
