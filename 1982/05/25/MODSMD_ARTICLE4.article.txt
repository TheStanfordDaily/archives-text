Third air battle fought over landing zone
London — The third major air battle in four days broke out yesterday
over the British landing zone on the Falkland Islands. Seven more Ar
gentine planes were shot down and several British ships were damaged,
the Defense Ministry announced.
Ministry spokesman lan McDonald announced meanwhile that the
frigate Antelope, one of the most modern ships in the British fleet, sank
yesterday after its crew had abandoned efforts to put out fires caused by
Argentine bombs in Sunday's raids. It was the third British warship lost
in the war and the second since Friday.
One British crewman was known dead and seven wounded on the
Antelope, which will be sorely missed by the screening force trying to
hold off the persistent Argentine aerial attacks on the 5000-man British
landing force and its support ships.
Yesterday's claimed air losses brought the Argentine toll to at least 27
planes since the British went ashore Friday at San Carlos Bay, exactly sev
en weeks after the Argentines had seized the islands.
The Argentine military command in Buenos Aires claimed its Sky
hawk and Mirage jets had damaged three British ships. McDonald said
no report on the damage was immediately available here.
Meanwhile, Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher rejected the appeal of
Pope John Paul II for a cease-fire, which Argentine President Leopoldo
Galtieri had accepted Sunday. Thatcher said Britain will not accept a
cease-fire until the Argentine troops are off the islands, the Argentine
defenders.
Several British newspapers with reporters as
signed to the task force reported British forces
had taken the Goose Green-Darwin airstrip 20
miles southeast of the landing zone. There was
n6 confirmation by the Defense Ministry. The
Goose Green airstrip is regarded as a key target
because the Argentines have been operating
counterinsurgency Pucara aircraft from there.
The Pucara is a plane that could hamper any
British overland drive.
Argentina may seek Soviet aid
Buenos Aires — High Argentine officials said
yesterday that they will have no choice but to
turn to the Soviet Union for arms aid if the
Falkland Islands war continues.
However, diplomatic sources said this actual
ly was more of a plea for help than a threat to
lead Argentina into the Soviet camp."It doesn't
make any sense any other way," a European
diplomat said. "The Argentines are asking for
help in surviving."
However, as another source said, "The British
won once they got all their troops on the is
lands. It will be all over before the Soviets could
reach Argentina with any important equip
ment."
This assessment was echoed by some Argen
tine government sources, one of whom said,
"in many ways, we're warning the United
States" not to force Argentina to abandon the
West.
The threat of a Soviet-Argentine relationship
appeared in the newspaper La Nacion, a large
morning daily that usually reflects government
thinking.
The front page story said that an unnamed
member of the junta said recently that "if we re
main without equipment ... Argentina will
have to depend on Soviet military supplies."
However, a diplomatic source said "it is a lot
of noise. These people who say it don't want it
and the Soviets don't want to give it to them.
The real problem is not with this government,
but what may follow."
House begins budget search
Washington — The House, picking its way
through a budget bazaar, yesterday rejected tax
and spending proposals from Democratic liber
als as President Ronald Reagan and House
SpeakerThomas"Tip" O'Neill (D-Mass.) traded
angry charges over the prospects of cuts in
Medicare.
Escalating an argument that began over the
weekend, O'Neill accused Reagan of a "breach
of faith with America's elderly" in supporting a
Repubican-drafted budget plan that would
save $23.3 billion from Medicare over three
years.
In no less acerbic tones, Reagan said it was
"sheer political demogoguery" on the part of
O'Neill and others to suggest that Social Secur
ity or Medicare benefits will be cut.
As Reagan and O'Neill were sparring over

Medicare the House made only scant progress
in sorting through seven separate budget alter
natives and nearly 70 amendments under a
complex voting schedule that is expected to last
through most of the week.
The last votes will come on the three major al
ternatives, including the Reagan-blessed plan
as well as one drafted by the Democratic-con
trolled House Budget Committee and another
prepared by a group of moderates from both
parties.
Of the three, the proposal endorsed by Rea
gan makes the deepest cuts in domestic spend
ing, deeper even than the budget adopted last
Friday by the Republican-controlled Senate.
The House committee's proposal, endorsed by
O'Neill, calls for the smallest domestic cuts,
largest tax increases and deepest cuts in Rea
gan's defense buildup. The moderates' pro
posal falls in between, but closer to the commit
tee's budget than to the one that Reagan wants.
Reagan to request
higher debt ceiling
Washington — The Reagan administration
will ask Congress today for a $195 billion in
crease in the national debt ceiling to a record
high $1,275 trillion so the government can keep
paying its bills through Sept. 30, 1983, the Los
Angeles Times learned yesterday.
The Department of the Treasury will notify
the House Ways and Means Committee that the
present $1,079 trillion ceiling will be pierced un
less Congress raises it by the third week in June,
administration sources said.
As of May 19, the latest date for which figures
were available, the outstanding debt was $1,067
trillion, or less than $12 billion below the legal
debt limit of $1.0798 trillion.
Without an increase in the debt limit, the
Treasury would be unable to borrow additional
new funds that would be required by late June
to keep writing government checks.
The government would not grind to a halt be
cause the existing debt limit does not expire un
til next Sept. 30. But administration officials said
they would be unable to pay some bills coming
due without congressional action.
Congress raised the debt ceiling above the
trillion-dollar mark for the first time last Sept.
30, setting the limit at $1,079 trillion. On Feb. 7,
1981, Congress lifted the ceiling from $935.1
billion to $985 billion in responding to one of
the first legislative requests of the Reagan ad
ministrstion.
Under the Senate budget resolution adopted
last week, the debt is expected to rise to $1.5
trillion by the end of 1985.
Court to rule on abortion
Washington — The Supreme Court agreed
yesterday to decide a series of new cases raising
questions about how far state and local govern
ments may go in seeking to limit abortions.
The cases, which will be heard next fall and

decided in early 1983, give the court its first op
portunity to pass judgment on the subject of
abortion since Justice Sandra Day O'Connor
took her seat last September.
O'Connor's appointment was opposed by
anti-abortion groups. She testified at her con
firmation hearings that she is generally opposed
to abortion, but refused to say how she would
vote on the court.
The cases the justices will hearinvolve restric
tions on abortion that were adopted in Mis
souri, Virginia and Akron, Ohio. One question
raised in all the cases is whether authorities may
require that abortionsmust be performed in a
hospital whenever women are more than three
months pregnant.
The justices will also be asked to decide
whether girls under 15 may be required to get
the consent of a parent before having an abor
tion, and whether doctors performing abor
tions may be required to tell their patients "that
the unborn child is a human life."
There is no indication so far that the court is
planning to reconsider its landmark 1973 ruling,
Roe vs. Wade, which effectively legalized abor
tion throughout the United States.
The most far-reaching case the court will re
view is the one from Akron. In 1978, the city
enacted an ordinance imposing a series of limits
on abortions.
KGB head joins Secretariat
Moscow — Yuri Andropov, 67, chairman of
the KGB Security and Intelligence Agency for
the last 15 years, became a member of the Soviet
Communist Party's powerful Secretariat yester
day. The move strengthens his hand in the
selection of President Leonid Brezhnev's suc
cessor and may pave the way for Andropov's
own rise to the top.
At the same time, Vladimir Dolgikh, the 57-
year-old party secretary in charge of heavy in
dustry and a man reputed to be a brilliant in
dustrial manager, was promoted to alternate or
non-voting membership in the Party's ruling
Politburo. Dolgikh's elevation suggests a lim
ited effort to infuse new blood into the aging
leadership.
Stocks mixed in quiet trading
The stock market was mixed yesterday in the
quietest trading in eight weeks.
The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials,
which had fallen 33.30 points over the last two
weeks, rose .48 to 836.38. But most other in
dicators showed small losses.
Today's weather
Much cooler today. Sunny inland. Fog and
low clouds along the coast and San Francisco
city spreading inland late in the day. Highs in
the upper 50s and 60s near the coast to the mid
80s inland. Westerly winds increasing to 15 to 30
mph.

In no less acerbic tones, Reagan said it was
"sheer political demogoguery" on the part of
O'Neill and others to suggest that Social Secur
ity or Medicare benefits will be cut.
As Reagan and O'Neill were sparring over

Medicare the House made only scant progress
in sorting through seven separate budget alter
natives and nearly 70 amendments under a
complex voting schedule that is expected to last
through most of the week.
The last votes will come on the three major al
ternatives, including the Reagan-blessed plan
as well as one drafted by the Democratic-con
trolled House Budget Committee and another
prepared by a group of moderates from both
parties.
Of the three, the proposal endorsed by Rea
gan makes the deepest cuts in domestic spend
ing, deeper even than the budget adopted last
Friday by the Republican-controlled Senate.
The House committee's proposal, endorsed by
O'Neill, calls for the smallest domestic cuts,
largest tax increases and deepest cuts in Rea
gan's defense buildup. The moderates' pro
posal falls in between, but closer to the commit
tee's budget than to the one that Reagan wants.
Reagan to request
higher debt ceiling
Washington — The Reagan administration
will ask Congress today for a $195 billion in
crease in the national debt ceiling to a record
high $1,275 trillion so the government can keep
paying its bills through Sept. 30, 1983, the Los
Angeles Times learned yesterday.
The Department of the Treasury will notify
the House Ways and Means Committee that the
present $1,079 trillion ceiling will be pierced un
less Congress raises it by the third week in June,
administration sources said.
As of May 19, the latest date for which figures
were available, the outstanding debt was $1,067
trillion, or less than $12 billion below the legal
debt limit of $1.0798 trillion.
Without an increase in the debt limit, the
Treasury would be unable to borrow additional
new funds that would be required by late June
to keep writing government checks.
The government would not grind to a halt be
cause the existing debt limit does not expire un
til next Sept. 30. But administration officials said
they would be unable to pay some bills coming
due without congressional action.
Congress raised the debt ceiling above the
trillion-dollar mark for the first time last Sept.
30, setting the limit at $1,079 trillion. On Feb. 7,
1981, Congress lifted the ceiling from $935.1
billion to $985 billion in responding to one of
the first legislative requests of the Reagan ad
ministrstion.
Under the Senate budget resolution adopted
last week, the debt is expected to rise to $1.5
trillion by the end of 1985.
Court to rule on abortion
Washington — The Supreme Court agreed
yesterday to decide a series of new cases raising
questions about how far state and local govern
ments may go in seeking to limit abortions.
The cases, which will be heard next fall and

decided in early 1983, give the court its first op
portunity to pass judgment on the subject of
abortion since Justice Sandra Day O'Connor
took her seat last September.
O'Connor's appointment was opposed by
anti-abortion groups. She testified at her con
firmation hearings that she is generally opposed
to abortion, but refused to say how she would
vote on the court.
The cases the justices will hearinvolve restric
tions on abortion that were adopted in Mis
souri, Virginia and Akron, Ohio. One question
raised in all the cases is whether authorities may
require that abortionsmust be performed in a
hospital whenever women are more than three
months pregnant.
The justices will also be asked to decide
whether girls under 15 may be required to get
the consent of a parent before having an abor
tion, and whether doctors performing abor
tions may be required to tell their patients "that
the unborn child is a human life."
There is no indication so far that the court is
planning to reconsider its landmark 1973 ruling,
Roe vs. Wade, which effectively legalized abor
tion throughout the United States.
The most far-reaching case the court will re
view is the one from Akron. In 1978, the city
enacted an ordinance imposing a series of limits
on abortions.
KGB head joins Secretariat
Moscow — Yuri Andropov, 67, chairman of
the KGB Security and Intelligence Agency for
the last 15 years, became a member of the Soviet
Communist Party's powerful Secretariat yester
day. The move strengthens his hand in the
selection of President Leonid Brezhnev's suc
cessor and may pave the way for Andropov's
own rise to the top.
At the same time, Vladimir Dolgikh, the 57-
year-old party secretary in charge of heavy in
dustry and a man reputed to be a brilliant in
dustrial manager, was promoted to alternate or
non-voting membership in the Party's ruling
Politburo. Dolgikh's elevation suggests a lim
ited effort to infuse new blood into the aging
leadership.

Third air battle fought over landing zone
London — The third major air battle in four days broke out yesterday
over the British landing zone on the Falkland Islands. Seven more Ar
gentine planes were shot down and several British ships were damaged,
the Defense Ministry announced.
Ministry spokesman lan McDonald announced meanwhile that the
frigate Antelope, one of the most modern ships in the British fleet, sank
yesterday after its crew had abandoned efforts to put out fires caused by
Argentine bombs in Sunday's raids. It was the third British warship lost
in the war and the second since Friday.
One British crewman was known dead and seven wounded on the
Antelope, which will be sorely missed by the screening force trying to
hold off the persistent Argentine aerial attacks on the 5000-man British
landing force and its support ships.
Yesterday's claimed air losses brought the Argentine toll to at least 27
planes since the British went ashore Friday at San Carlos Bay, exactly sev
en weeks after the Argentines had seized the islands.
The Argentine military command in Buenos Aires claimed its Sky
hawk and Mirage jets had damaged three British ships. McDonald said
no report on the damage was immediately available here.
Meanwhile, Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher rejected the appeal of
Pope John Paul II for a cease-fire, which Argentine President Leopoldo
Galtieri had accepted Sunday. Thatcher said Britain will not accept a
cease-fire until the Argentine troops are off the islands, the Argentine
defenders.
Several British newspapers with reporters as
signed to the task force reported British forces
had taken the Goose Green-Darwin airstrip 20
miles southeast of the landing zone. There was
n6 confirmation by the Defense Ministry. The
Goose Green airstrip is regarded as a key target
because the Argentines have been operating
counterinsurgency Pucara aircraft from there.
The Pucara is a plane that could hamper any
British overland drive.
Argentina may seek Soviet aid
Buenos Aires — High Argentine officials said
yesterday that they will have no choice but to
turn to the Soviet Union for arms aid if the
Falkland Islands war continues.
However, diplomatic sources said this actual
ly was more of a plea for help than a threat to
lead Argentina into the Soviet camp."It doesn't
make any sense any other way," a European
diplomat said. "The Argentines are asking for
help in surviving."
However, as another source said, "The British
won once they got all their troops on the is
lands. It will be all over before the Soviets could
reach Argentina with any important equip
ment."
This assessment was echoed by some Argen
tine government sources, one of whom said,
"in many ways, we're warning the United
States" not to force Argentina to abandon the
West.
The threat of a Soviet-Argentine relationship
appeared in the newspaper La Nacion, a large
morning daily that usually reflects government
thinking.
The front page story said that an unnamed
member of the junta said recently that "if we re
main without equipment ... Argentina will
have to depend on Soviet military supplies."
However, a diplomatic source said "it is a lot
of noise. These people who say it don't want it
and the Soviets don't want to give it to them.
The real problem is not with this government,
but what may follow."
House begins budget search
Washington — The House, picking its way
through a budget bazaar, yesterday rejected tax
and spending proposals from Democratic liber
als as President Ronald Reagan and House
SpeakerThomas"Tip" O'Neill (D-Mass.) traded
angry charges over the prospects of cuts in
Medicare.
Escalating an argument that began over the
weekend, O'Neill accused Reagan of a "breach
of faith with America's elderly" in supporting a
Repubican-drafted budget plan that would
save $23.3 billion from Medicare over three
years.

the consent of a parent before having an abor
tion, and whether doctors performing abor
tions may be required to tell their patients "that
the unborn child is a human life."
There is no indication so far that the court is
planning to reconsider its landmark 1973 ruling,
Roe vs. Wade, which effectively legalized abor
tion throughout the United States.
The most far-reaching case the court will re
view is the one from Akron. In 1978, the city
enacted an ordinance imposing a series of limits
on abortions.
KGB head joins Secretariat
Moscow — Yuri Andropov, 67, chairman of
the KGB Security and Intelligence Agency for
the last 15 years, became a member of the Soviet
Communist Party's powerful Secretariat yester
day. The move strengthens his hand in the
selection of President Leonid Brezhnev's suc
cessor and may pave the way for Andropov's
own rise to the top.
At the same time, Vladimir Dolgikh, the 57-
year-old party secretary in charge of heavy in
dustry and a man reputed to be a brilliant in
dustrial manager, was promoted to alternate or
non-voting membership in the Party's ruling
Politburo. Dolgikh's elevation suggests a lim
ited effort to infuse new blood into the aging
leadership.

Third air battle fought over landing zone
London — The third major air battle in four days broke out yesterday
over the British landing zone on the Falkland Islands. Seven more Ar
gentine planes were shot down and several British ships were damaged,
the Defense Ministry announced.
Ministry spokesman lan McDonald announced meanwhile that the
frigate Antelope, one of the most modern ships in the British fleet, sank
yesterday after its crew had abandoned efforts to put out fires caused by
Argentine bombs in Sunday's raids. It was the third British warship lost
in the war and the second since Friday.
One British crewman was known dead and seven wounded on the
Antelope, which will be sorely missed by the screening force trying to
hold off the persistent Argentine aerial attacks on the 5000-man British
landing force and its support ships.
Yesterday's claimed air losses brought the Argentine toll to at least 27
planes since the British went ashore Friday at San Carlos Bay, exactly sev
en weeks after the Argentines had seized the islands.
The Argentine military command in Buenos Aires claimed its Sky
hawk and Mirage jets had damaged three British ships. McDonald said
no report on the damage was immediately available here.
Meanwhile, Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher rejected the appeal of
Pope John Paul II for a cease-fire, which Argentine President Leopoldo
Galtieri had accepted Sunday. Thatcher said Britain will not accept a
cease-fire until the Argentine troops are off the islands, the Argentine
defenders.
Several British newspapers with reporters as
signed to the task force reported British forces
had taken the Goose Green-Darwin airstrip 20
miles southeast of the landing zone. There was
n6 confirmation by the Defense Ministry. The
Goose Green airstrip is regarded as a key target
because the Argentines have been operating
counterinsurgency Pucara aircraft from there.
The Pucara is a plane that could hamper any
British overland drive.
Argentina may seek Soviet aid
Buenos Aires — High Argentine officials said
yesterday that they will have no choice but to
turn to the Soviet Union for arms aid if the
Falkland Islands war continues.
However, diplomatic sources said this actual
ly was more of a plea for help than a threat to
lead Argentina into the Soviet camp."It doesn't
make any sense any other way," a European
diplomat said. "The Argentines are asking for
help in surviving."
However, as another source said, "The British
won once they got all their troops on the is
lands. It will be all over before the Soviets could
reach Argentina with any important equip
ment."
This assessment was echoed by some Argen
tine government sources, one of whom said,
"in many ways, we're warning the United
States" not to force Argentina to abandon the
West.
The threat of a Soviet-Argentine relationship
appeared in the newspaper La Nacion, a large
morning daily that usually reflects government
thinking.
The front page story said that an unnamed
member of the junta said recently that "if we re
main without equipment ... Argentina will
have to depend on Soviet military supplies."
However, a diplomatic source said "it is a lot
of noise. These people who say it don't want it
and the Soviets don't want to give it to them.
The real problem is not with this government,
but what may follow."
House begins budget search
Washington — The House, picking its way
through a budget bazaar, yesterday rejected tax
and spending proposals from Democratic liber
als as President Ronald Reagan and House
SpeakerThomas"Tip" O'Neill (D-Mass.) traded
angry charges over the prospects of cuts in
Medicare.
Escalating an argument that began over the
weekend, O'Neill accused Reagan of a "breach
of faith with America's elderly" in supporting a
Repubican-drafted budget plan that would
save $23.3 billion from Medicare over three
years.
In no less acerbic tones, Reagan said it was
"sheer political demogoguery" on the part of
O'Neill and others to suggest that Social Secur
ity or Medicare benefits will be cut.
As Reagan and O'Neill were sparring over

Medicare the House made only scant progress
in sorting through seven separate budget alter
natives and nearly 70 amendments under a
complex voting schedule that is expected to last
through most of the week.
The last votes will come on the three major al
ternatives, including the Reagan-blessed plan
as well as one drafted by the Democratic-con
trolled House Budget Committee and another
prepared by a group of moderates from both
parties.
Of the three, the proposal endorsed by Rea
gan makes the deepest cuts in domestic spend
ing, deeper even than the budget adopted last
Friday by the Republican-controlled Senate.
The House committee's proposal, endorsed by
O'Neill, calls for the smallest domestic cuts,
largest tax increases and deepest cuts in Rea
gan's defense buildup. The moderates' pro
posal falls in between, but closer to the commit
tee's budget than to the one that Reagan wants.
Reagan to request
higher debt ceiling
Washington — The Reagan administration
will ask Congress today for a $195 billion in
crease in the national debt ceiling to a record
high $1,275 trillion so the government can keep
paying its bills through Sept. 30, 1983, the Los
Angeles Times learned yesterday.
The Department of the Treasury will notify
the House Ways and Means Committee that the
present $1,079 trillion ceiling will be pierced un
less Congress raises it by the third week in June,
administration sources said.
As of May 19, the latest date for which figures
were available, the outstanding debt was $1,067
trillion, or less than $12 billion below the legal
debt limit of $1.0798 trillion.
Without an increase in the debt limit, the
Treasury would be unable to borrow additional
new funds that would be required by late June
to keep writing government checks.
The government would not grind to a halt be
cause the existing debt limit does not expire un
til next Sept. 30. But administration officials said
they would be unable to pay some bills coming
due without congressional action.
Congress raised the debt ceiling above the
trillion-dollar mark for the first time last Sept.
30, setting the limit at $1,079 trillion. On Feb. 7,
1981, Congress lifted the ceiling from $935.1
billion to $985 billion in responding to one of
the first legislative requests of the Reagan ad
ministrstion.
Under the Senate budget resolution adopted
last week, the debt is expected to rise to $1.5
trillion by the end of 1985.
Court to rule on abortion
Washington — The Supreme Court agreed
yesterday to decide a series of new cases raising
questions about how far state and local govern
ments may go in seeking to limit abortions.
The cases, which will be heard next fall and

decided in early 1983, give the court its first op
portunity to pass judgment on the subject of
abortion since Justice Sandra Day O'Connor
took her seat last September.
O'Connor's appointment was opposed by
anti-abortion groups. She testified at her con
firmation hearings that she is generally opposed
to abortion, but refused to say how she would
vote on the court.
The cases the justices will hearinvolve restric
tions on abortion that were adopted in Mis
souri, Virginia and Akron, Ohio. One question
raised in all the cases is whether authorities may
require that abortionsmust be performed in a
hospital whenever women are more than three
months pregnant.
The justices will also be asked to decide
whether girls under 15 may be required to get
the consent of a parent before having an abor
tion, and whether doctors performing abor
tions may be required to tell their patients "that
the unborn child is a human life."
There is no indication so far that the court is
planning to reconsider its landmark 1973 ruling,
Roe vs. Wade, which effectively legalized abor
tion throughout the United States.
The most far-reaching case the court will re
view is the one from Akron. In 1978, the city
enacted an ordinance imposing a series of limits
on abortions.
