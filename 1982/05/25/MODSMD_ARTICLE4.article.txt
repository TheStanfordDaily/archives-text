Third air battle fought over landing zone
London — The third major air battle in four days broke out yesterday
over the British landing zone on the Falkland Islands. Seven more Ar
gentine planes were shot down and several British ships were damaged,
the Defense Ministry announced.
Ministry spokesman lan McDonald announced meanwhile that the
frigate Antelope, one of the most modern ships in the British fleet, sank
yesterday after its crew had abandoned efforts to put out fires caused by
Argentine bombs in Sunday's raids. It was the third British warship lost
in the war and the second since Friday.
One British crewman was known dead and seven wounded on the
Antelope, which will be sorely missed by the screening force trying to
hold off the persistent Argentine aerial attacks on the 5000-man British
landing force and its support ships.
Yesterday's claimed air losses brought the Argentine toll to at least 27
planes since the British went ashore Friday at San Carlos Bay, exactly sev
en weeks after the Argentines had seized the islands.
The Argentine military command in Buenos Aires claimed its Sky
hawk and Mirage jets had damaged three British ships. McDonald said
no report on the damage was immediately available here.
Meanwhile, Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher rejected the appeal of
Pope John Paul II for a cease-fire, which Argentine President Leopoldo
Galtieri had accepted Sunday. Thatcher said Britain will not accept a
cease-fire until the Argentine troops are off the islands, the Argentine
defenders.
