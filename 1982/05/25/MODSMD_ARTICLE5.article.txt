# Pauling opposes defense budget, supports unilateral disarmament

The United States has always been
a leader in taking unilateral actions
concerning nuclear weapons — but
those actions have been in the wrong
direction, said Linus Pauling, Nobel
laureate in Chemistry and Peace, last
night.
"I would hope that the United
States would reverse its policy and in
stead of taking unilateral actions in
the direction of increasing militarism
, would move instead in the direc
tion of rational disarmament and
world cooperation," Pauling said.
The more than 500 people in Me
morial Auditorium who came to hear
Pauling speak on "the path to world
peace" gave his message of unilateral
disarmament a prolonged standing
ovation.
Pauling suggested several actions
that the United States could take to
avert a "final world war," including
decreasing the military budget, pull
ing American troops out of Europe,
slashing the B-1 bomber and MX mis
sile programs, halting the develop
ment of cruise missiles and nerve gas,
stopping the spread of nuclear weap
ons to other nations, and supporting
the principles of internationalism in
the United Nations.
"The United States should now
take unilateral actions that would
greatly decrease the amount of mili
tary spending and at the same time
incease the safety of the United
States and the rest of the world," he

said.
Pauling discussed the dangers of
nuclear war at length, emphasizing
the catastrophic possibilities of even
a limited nuclear exchange.
"What would be the effects of such
a war? It's pretty clear, they would be
serious," Pauling said with heavy
sarcasm after proposing that the hu
man race could not survive even a

limited nuclear exchange.
The only rational way to preserve
civilzation is to abolish war, Pauling
concluded. Because attempts to
achieve disarmament through nego
tiated agreements have proved so
difficult to achieve, Pauling said, the
United States should take immediate
unilateral action.
Pauling criticized the American
"military-industrial" complex and

suggested that the huge U.S. military
budgets robbed the American peo
ple in order to protect capitalism and
"make the world free for exploita
tion."
Pauling urged concerned citizens
to elect sensitive officals, write to
their representatives, and join the
upcoming peace march in San Fran
cisco — in short, to "do anything, do
something, don't just sit there," in
order to help avert the possibility of
nuclear war.
Pauling said that he hoped that the
Reagan administration's current mili
taristic policies would arouse the
public's indigation and provide addi
tional incentive to the disarmament
movement.
"I would hope that President Rea
gan, who's responsible for the re
birth of the anti-nuclear movement,
will go down in history as the great
peacemaker," he said.
Pauling autographed chemistry
books before his speech, and joked
with his audience frequently during
his presentation.
"I'm called a biochemist. I don't
know much biochemistry, and I
don't like it very much," he said.
Pauling received the Nobel Peace
Prize in 1962 for his efforts on behalf
of a nuclear test ban treaty, and he
also won the Chemistry prize in 1954.
The scholar, also celebrated for his
theory that massive doses of vitamin
C can cure the common cold, was a
professor of chemistry here from
1969 to 1974.
