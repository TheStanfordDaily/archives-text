Although he focused on the roles
of Cuba and the Soviet Union as in
stigators of Central American crises,
John Gavin, Stanford alumnus and
U.S. ambassador to Mexico, said yes
terday that world relations should be
viewed from a north-south rather
that east-west perspective in the
future.
Rounding off a day of visits with
University President Donald Ken
nedy, some of his former professors,
and his daughter, junior Cristina
Gavin, the ambassador told a modest
gathering in Okada lounge that Latin
American nations will become in
creasingly important to the United
States.
Asked how much autonomy the
United States will allow these coun
tries in view of their strategic and ec
onomic importance, Gavin replied,
"If we are going to survive as a na
tion, we will have to consider our in
terests over perhaps other things...
Russia is intruding in this hemisphere
to make mischief."
Gavin, who starred in the movies
Thoroughly Modern Millie and Psy
cho, said the Soviet Union has "aided
and abetted" the guerilla aggression
effort in El Salvador and for that rea
son his embassy urged Mexico not to
assume the role of mediator in the El
Salvadoran conflict. "They (Mexican
officials) wanted to be 'com
municators.' We opposed that be
cause we thought those people (the
El Salvadoran guerrillas) would be
trying to leverage their very small

group into a position of power."
The statesman later voiced his sup
port for "communication between
individuals" and said the United
States would like to start a dialogue
with Nicaragua "if one thing above
all: they would stop the flow of arms
to El Salvador."
The ambassador also said that revo
lution should occur spontaneously
within the individual nation, "grow
ing out of and carried out by the peo
ple of that nation." According to
Gavin, the revolutionary efforts in El
Salvador and Nicaragua do not fit this
description but are instigated by the
Soviet Union and supplied by Cuba,
"a vassal of the Russian Communist
Empire" which exports revolution to
repay $8 million a day in Soviet aid.
"If these were authentic revolu
tions they should be allowed to run
their course," Gavin said. "We have
been at pains to point out to Mexican
officials that this has not been the
case in Central America."
The ambassador said "whatever
the official Mexican position, of
ficials have been forthcoming" since
the free elections in El Salvador and
have accepted the current El
Salvadoran government as the legit
imate choice of the people since free
elections were held in El Salvador.
More that 70 percent of the El
Salvadoran population voted in that
country's election, according to
Gavin, who discounted reports that
citizens' ballots were marked and
monitored, saying "I think we can say
that those rumors and inventions are
no more than that."

Gavin later expanded this com
ment to apply to stories of inhumane
working and living conditions forced
upon illegal aliens from Latin Ameri
ca working in the United States, cit
ing a recent investigation which
found that the average wage of a
sample group of 5600 was $4.81 per
hour, well above the minimum wage.
Though he did not advocate rais
ing the Mexican immigration quota,
Gavin suggested that illegal aliens be
"legitimized" by giving them an
identification card to present to their
employer which would verify the
worker's identity.
This would give alien workers pro
tection against exploitation, accord
ing to Gavin and "do both Mexico
and America a favor" since Mexican

workers need jobs and, if current de
mographic patterns continue, Amer
ican employers need workers.
"Mexico is America's third largest
trading partner," Gavin said. "We
need to recognize the symbiotic rela
tionship between the two."
Gavin told the audience that when

he was considered for appointment
to his present post, one offical in
Washington had called the White
House to object to him on the
grounds that he was an "actor." The
offical made the mistake, Gavin said,
of taking his complaint directly to
President Ronald Reagan, himself a
former actor.
Gavin recounted that Reagan re
plied,"Do you know who you're tell
ing this to" and said that shortly
thereafter he was offered the job.
