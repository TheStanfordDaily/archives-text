# Union fights decision to drop objection
## 
### Karen Springen 
Clerical employees here voted against
unionization last spring, but that election has yet to
be certified due to an appeal of a National Labor
Relations Board (NLRB) decision which dismissed
objections to the electoral process.
Following the election, the United Stanford
Workers (USW) Local 715 filed 16 objections
against the University.
According to Priscilla Wheeler of the University
Legal Office, USW withdrew 12 of its charges and
the NLRB overruled the union on three of the four
remaining objections. The remaining objection
concerned the University's change from a six- to
four-step wage structure two months before the
election, which USW claims swayed the election.
The NLRB dismissed its objection last month af
ter hearing University evidence. According to
Dean Francis, acting regional director of the NLRB,
the contested timing of the announcement of
changes in the step system "simply moved along
with its highly structured, formalized salary review
system exactly as it had in the past, without regard
to the union's presence. There is no evidence of
any irregularity or deviation from past practice."
But USW, formerly known as United Stanford
Employees (USE), appealed the NLRB decision to
dismiss its charge against the University because it
still feels the University prejudiced the election by

announcing large salary increases along with the
step structure changes in March 1981.
Kathy McKennan, field representative for USW
Local 715, said, "We do believe that the charge is a
legitimate charge, that Stanford raised the salaries
to avoid the union." She also called the Univer
sity's practice in giving evidence to the NLRB un
fair. "They (the NLRB) heard more testimony from
Stanford but not from us," she said.
McKennan said she suspects the NLRB, respon
sible for deciding if enough evidence exists to jus
tify a charge, would not have dismissed its charge if
it had heard USW Local 715 evidence as well. She
added that USW was not told that the NLRB was
hearing University evidence.
The decision is now moved to the Washington
office of the NLRB.
Although clerical workers decisively turned
back unionization (930 in favor vs. 554 against) on
May 7, 1981, USW Local 715 appeals have con
tinued to delay finalization of the election.
According to Gloria Parks, temporary chair
person of the Office Staff Organizing Committee
* (OSOC), which met regularly last year but now ex
ists on an ad hoc basis, her organization is con
cerned primarily with wages. In July, the University
will notify workers of their September 1982 wage
increases. Departments have suggested per
centage increases, but the University is not ob

ligated to follow the recommendations, said Parks.
She is particularly concerned with older women
in the merit zone, since the University is not ob
ligated to give them the across the zone 10 percent
increase.
She cited OSOC's present role as a "sounding
board" and "moving spirit" to "raise conscious
ness."
According to a representative of USW Local 715,
an appeal sometimes defeats its purpose because it
may actually be easiest to begin organizing again.
All sides claim that another election in the near
future is unlikely. It is also legally impossible. Be
cause last year's election is not finalized, another
election is blocked, said Wheeler. She did not pre
dict when the election will be certified. "It does
appear that they're going to take every appeal they
can," she said.
"There can always be an election if the union
files a petition," she added.
Parks said, "There will eventually be another
one. I don't know what it will take. I would not pre
dict it this year or next... I hope that someday the
time will be right."
According to Joyce Tipps-Coates of SLAC, who
led the union fight last year, "There is still some
dissatisfaction with the University." But she said, "I
don't think it's likely that there'll be another elec
tion soon."
