## Stanford doctor studios anesthosia mystery

Why do elderly surgery pa
tients need less anesthetic than
younger patients?
In an effort to understand
this phenomenon, a group of
medical researchers which in
cludes a Stanford doctor has
just received a $2.6 million
grant to study the effects of sur
gical anesthesia on elderly pa
tients for the next five years.
Dr. Donald Stanski, assistant
professor of anesthesiology
and medicine (clinical pharma
cology) here, together with
five researchers at the UC San
Francisco Medical Center, will
perform the study in order to
establish guidelines enabling
doctors to administer
anesthesia more precisely and
safely to elderly patients.
Anesthesia is used in an op
eration to make the surgery
painless to the patient, and to
relax the patient's muscles,
enabling the surgeon to per
form the operation more easi
ly-
General anesthesia is usually

given in two phases. First, a
rapid-acting drug is given to
the patient to induce un
consciousness. Then, doctors
administer a longer-acting in
haled anesthetic to keep the
patient unconscious. If neces
sary, doctors inject a drug that
causes temporary paralysis,
thereby relaxing the patient's
muscles.
Stanski said his research will
focus on the first of the proc
esses. Frequently, barbituates
such as thiopental (Pentothal)
and methohexital are given in
travenously to induce un
consciousness. He will study
the pharmacodynamics and
the pharmacokinetics of these
drugs.
Pharmacodynamics is con
cerned with how a drug affects
the body, how it changes the
biological functions of living
tissue. Stanski will measure the
effects of the barbiturates on
the body by monitering the
brain waves of patients, usir%
an electroencephalogram
(EEG), a recording of the

minute electrical currents of
the brain. He will try to de
termine how an older person's
brain is more affected by a giv
en amount of a drug than the
brain of someone younger.
Pharmacokinetics involves
what the body does to a drug.
This includes the drug's
absorption into and distribu
tion within the body, any
chemical transformations the
drug undergoes within the
body, and the excretion of the
drug from the body.
Stanski said he will study the
kinetics of a barbiturate by
sampling various body fluids
(such as blood and urine)
before, during, and after the
application of anesthesia. To
determine the drug levels in
the fluids, he will employ high
pressure liquid chromato
graphy, a very rapid chemical
analysis technique.
The EEG and chromato
graphy data will then be fed
into a computer, Stanski said.
Using mathematical and
statistical analysis tools, he

hopes to develop a correlation
between the fluid levels of a
drug and brain wave activity.
Thus, the combination of two
different investigative tech
niques should make it possible
to measure an individual's
brain sensitivity to barbiturates
and to determine the effects of
aging on this process.
Stanski said that while he is
conducting his research at the
Stanford Medical Center and
the Veteran's Administration
Hospital in Palo Alto, his col
leagues will pursue other areas
of anesthesia research at UCSF.
They will study the pharma
cokinetics of inhaled
anesthetics, the effects of pain
and physical stress on older
people, pain killers and muscle
relaxants, and computer sim
ulations and models of the ex
periments.
Stanski said he attributes to
day's larger elderly population
to improved medical tech
niques which have enabled
people to live longer.
