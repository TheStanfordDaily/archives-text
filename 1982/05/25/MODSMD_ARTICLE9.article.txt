# Safe 'ranch' built on quake fault
## 
### George Fujii 
The San Andreas fault, which runs west
of the campus, has been the cause of the
majority of earthquakes in California, most
notably the devastating 1906 San Francisco
quake. It is this same fault that runs directly
through the Portola Valley Ranch complex
located a few miles southwest of the Uni
versity.
Many communities are built on or near
the fault, but Portola Valley Ranch differs
in the approach they take toward the en
vironment. According to their information
sheet, the goal of the development is "to
harmonize with the natural environment
and function as a private residential park
and nature preserve."
Out of the 454 acres of the complex, only
50 acres have been set aside for develop
ment. Some of the remaining land will be
used for recreation (jogging, hiking and
biking trails and tennis courts), bui for the
most part, it will be left virtually un
touched. The idea is to develop only the

land that is geologically sound.
This is a far cry from the Woodside area
located west of campus which has ex
perienced extensive housing damage from
landslides triggered by heavy rains this
winter. Fault traces run throughout the
Woodside area, causing the soil under the
houses to destabilize. Thus, when heavy
rains drench the area, residents see their
property slide down the hillside. In the
past, Woodside has appealed to the state
for declaration as a state disaster area.
According to Joseph Whelan, owner
and developer of Portola Valley Ranch, the
community survived the wet winter with
no problems from slides. Whelan
purchased the land in 1974, and said that
before starting any construction, he hired
a geologist, a soil engineer, a structural en
gineer, an architect and a civil engineer in
order to assure a geologically sound com
munity. He said he also talked to people in
the geology department here and the Geo
logic Survey before beginning construc

tion.
Whelan explained the process pros
pective buyers go through in purchasing a
house in Portola Valley Ranch: "We show
them a map in the sales office which de
picts the location of the fault on the prop
erty, and explain the fact that we are living
in earthquake country. We then give them
geologic reports of soil conditions.. . and
a Department of Real Estate Report."
"We tell them what they are getting
into," he said," we don't hide anything."
Whelan also said that while most clients
"buy with their eyes," there are those with
some background in geology or related
disciplines who are very interested in what
the Portola Valley Ranch is doing. One of
these informed customers is Sheldon
Breiner, an associate of the geology de
partment here and a resident of Portola
Valley Ranch.
Whelan received an award from the Na
tional Association of Homebuilders for his
work on Portola Valley Ranch.
