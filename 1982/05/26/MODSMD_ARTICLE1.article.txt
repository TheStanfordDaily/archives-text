# ASSU food service task force suggests private firm management
## 
### Kathy Olmsted Senior staff writer 
The University should consider hir
ing a private contractor to manage
the food service program here ac
cording to ASSU Task Force on Uni
versity Food Service recommenda
tions released yesterday.
The task force's research has
shown that a Stanford meal plan
"costs 30 to 80 percent more than
identical plans offered by private
contractors at other universities in
the area and nationwide/' the report
stated. The couched recommenda
tion did not specifically suggest that
the University acquire the services of
a private contractor, but it did urge
the University to "consider the ad
vantages and disadvantages" of en
gaging a private firm.
The private contractor suggestion
was one of five major recommenda
tions that the task force released yes
terday. The task force also recom
mended that the University experi
ment with a "fee-for-service" meal
program in one dormitory next fall;
replace meal cards with magnetic
identification cards that could also be
used for voting and for library check
out; encourage Row Houses oper
ated by University Food Service to
hire their own cooks; and allow stu
dents to take a more active role in
their food service by performing
such chores as stacking their own
dishes.
The task force's conclusions are
not binding on the University, but
task force Chairman Rod Beckstrom
said he was confident that the recom
mendations will influence the long
range decisions of the adminis
tration. The University has a "definite
interest" in cutting food costs,

Beckstrom said, because lower costs
result in a lower financial aid burden.
According to Beckstrom, the task
force released its five major recom
mendations yesterday so that stu
dents would have time to discuss the
recommendations. Beckstrom said
the task force's final report, which
will include several minor recom
mendations along with selections
from the task force's research, will
not be ready for release until next
week.
In order to ascertain how students
and administrators feel about the
task force's conclusions, the task
force members have scheduled a
panel discussion on the recommen
dations this Friday that will be open
toall studentsand will feature several
University employees involved in res
idential education.
The task force has already at
tempted to discover how students
feel about stacking their own dishes
by conducting a self-bussing experi
ment this week in Roble. Beckstrom,
who is also a newly inaugurated
member of the Council of Presidents,
said the task force has been "pleas
antly surprised" at the overall re
sponse of the students to the experi
ment.
The task force will continue to
function as "an important research
and student advocacy group" for an
other three or four years, according
to the report released yesterday. The
report said that the group has already
spent more than 3000 hours re
searching various food service op
tions, has made field trips to six other
universities, and has consulted more
than 50 administators and University
Food Service employees.
