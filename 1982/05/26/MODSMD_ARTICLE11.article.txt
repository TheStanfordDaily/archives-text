## Editorial Vote: control handguns 
### 
In November California voters will have the
opportunity to register their discontent with the
number of needless deaths in the state and
throughout the country caused by handguns
every year. By supporting the California
handgun initiative, they will vote to hold the
number of legal handguns in the state to the
present fourtosix million.
In addition, many Californians will be asked
on June 8 for an advisory vote either in favor or
against individual county and city handgun
registration measures.
We support both the local and statewide
efforts because of the humane necessity to stop
many of the crimes of passion that are facilitated
by the easily obtained handgun in the
nightstand drawer. Handguns are different from
other guns because they are bought primarily
for the purpose of killing human beings. They
are bought as insurance — a means of self
defense just in case someone threatens the
owner or his property. It is probably fair to say
that most of those people who purchase
handguns hope never to have to use them. And
often it is not the purchaser who actually does
use them, but an incensed child, relative, or
friend in a moment of rage who happens to
know where the gun is, or a burglar who breaks
in and steals it.
The state initiative is an attempt to make

handguns less accessible and thus begin to
reduce the more than 10,000 deaths nationwide
each year, including accidents, homicides and
domestic altercations, caused by handguns. The
measure will not effect the owners of shotguns,
rifles, or any other guns, but will simply put a
ceiling on the number of handguns in the state.
And with about one handgun per family right
now, there will likely still be more than enough.
The mandatory six month jail sentence for
anyone carrying a concealed, unregistered
handgun raises the concern that someone
acting in self defense could receive a stiffer
penalty than the burglar against whom he is
defending himself. We recognize the
philosophical unfairness of this scenario, but if
we truly wish to decrease the number of
fatalities and crimes by handguns, we will have
to sacrifice element of fairness and make the
penalties strict.
Although the ideal situation would be to have
required every handgun to be registered at the
time of purchase — thus guaranteeing, as the
ballot initiative cannot, that every handgun will
be registered — that is impossible, yet
something must be done.
We hope you will join the 64 percent of
Californians who, in an April Field Poll, voiced
support for handgun control and help set an
example for other states to follow.
