## Mere platitudes no solution 
### 
Luis Murguia's article (Daily, May
5) contains lies and distortions of fact,
errors of principle, gratuitous insults,
the usual pious platitudes about
peace and what looks very much like
an admission that Argentina is guilty
of all the crimes of which it accuses
Britain, plus a few more.
To start with, Spain's claim on the
Falkland Islands was purely colonial,
along with its attempts to rule most of
the rest of Latin America, wherefore
the original legitimacy of Argentine
ownership of the islands rests on co
lonialism. Now quoting Murguia, "In
1823 Argentina designated Pablo
Arequati governor of the islands ...
Argentinian families moved there to
do sheep farming." (Note that this
happened some time after Argentina
had declared itself independent).
Behold, Argentina sets up a colony!
The British, who incidentally had en
dorsed the Monroe Doctrine as it re
lated to the South American conti
nent, in 1833 threw this colony off the
islands and replaced it with one of
our own, but did not seek to subject

the Argentinians living there to for
eign rule; we sent them home.
"Rivero did not obey, and he was
put in jail for 15 years." Well, no
doubt any Falklanders who did not
obey the new Argentine military gov
ernor would spend the rest of their
lives in jail, but it would not last any
15 years. Try 15 days?
"Argentinians wanted to move to
the islands... none was allowed." Of
course not; that would have set up
the pretext for an invasion "to pro
tect our brothers" as was practiced
by Turkey on Cyprus and Germany
on the Sudentenland. And yet, some
were allowed: at the time of the Ar
gentine invasion, there were Argen
tine civilians on the islands, one of
whom helped arrange the surrender
of our Marines. "The British had de
cided to keep the islands..." What
nonsense. Our government was pre
pared to give them away, but only if
the inhabitants could be persuaded
to agree. Unsurprisingly, they could
not; we do not use the same means of
persuasion as the Argentine govern

ment. "The British government, feel
ing that only Great Britain is allowed
to use force ... Under the U.N.
charter, no nation is allowed to use
force. But the charter was signed af
ter 1833, and was not retroactive. Ar
gentina's recent use of force pro
vides ample justification for our own.
"(The Argentinians) want to live in
peace" after a hot border dispute
with Chile and one of the most im
pressive military buildups in the
Southern Hemisphere. They "expect
that the other countries of the world
will respect their rights" to deny the
self-determination of 1800 free peo
ple and impose on them a govern
ment to which they never consented.
It may be that "American leaders are
unable to understand ... the Argen
tinian people," but it is equally clear
that Argentina does not understand
anything except armed force. Not
surprising, of course, from a military
junta, but they may find out that they
have even misjudged that.
