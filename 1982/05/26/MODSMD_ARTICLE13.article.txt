## 'Freeze' the morbid, destructive imagination 
### 
This article will offer an answer to
those who propose to sell out Ameri
can values by imposing an immediate
freeze on nuclear weaponry. The an
swer runs something like this: You
got to keep an eye out on those com
munists or the next thing you know
they'll be down your chimney and
into your goldfish.
Let us examine both sides in
greater detail.
For the freeze: There are no sur
vivors of a nuclear exchange â€” if
there remain those whose eyes have
not closed, they will envy the dead
and will soon be satisfied. The com
petition between the superpowers
has produced a spiral of increasing
firepower and decreasing margin of
error. The people must find the will
their governments lack to halt this
madness.

Consider how
difficult it is for
proponents of the
freeze to listen
sympathetically to the
perceived needs of
their opponents

A nuclear freeze is a small part of
the larger ideal of total disarmament.
The freeze rests on the notion that
adopting the part is a step towards
the whole. This is an appealing idea,
but its validity is not immediately
clear. Not many proponents call also
for unilateral disarmament, so pre
sumably they would have the United
States retain for now the ability to va
porize the human race at least a few
times. At best, a freeze is the begin
ning of recovery. At best, it buys us
time.
Against the freeze: There has been
only one war involving nuclear
weapons, between the nuclear Unit
ed Nations and a non-nuclear Japan.
Japan lost. So much for going belly
up and asking the Russians to join us.
The prudent course is to maintain a
credible deterrent, keeping enough
bargaining chips in reserve to force
concessions from the Soviets. We will
forego land-based cruise missiles,

but only if they remove their SS-20's
Unfortunately, a long thin sheild
with a point on the end looks to the
other guy remarkably like an honest
to-goodness spear. Our Soviet coun
terparts may be less impressed with
the cruise missile's ability to deter
than with its ability to strike their
homeland with only minutes warn
ing. Still, the equipoised seesaw
hasn't broken yet, and if negotiation
can keep the terrible weights from
slipping off, we may buy some time.
Now that we have examined sepa
rately the two opposing views, let's
set them one against the other. The
employed military strategist does
well to make the best of the worst
case, noting that obliteration means
he's out of a job. We have found a
match for our morbid imaginations,
however, and the pitiful result is that
planning for the worst case makes
the worst case worse. Enter the newly
aroused public, terrified by the abyss
ahead, who declared with quivering
lip that he will go not ne step
further. Different tunes, but they
harmonize rather well. Both derive
from fear, both recoil inward.
And both share a common void.
Where is the rest of the world? The
strategists need even the Soviets only
as mannequins on which to hang the
hideous caricatures demanded by
their game theory. Meanwhile, what
must the Soviets make of us? Perhaps
it runs something like this: "Is neces
sary putting the eye over the capital
ists or there is chimney down
climbing and insideness of the stur
geon."
Can a freeze really work in such an
atmosphere? A freeze on the de
structive imagination?
Do I mean the world's going to hell
in a bucket? Nol It may yet explode,
but first the world is contracting.
With increased proximity, its dis
parate parts may find new ways of fit
ting together before the criticial mass
is reached. Buying time, by freeze or
SALT's 111 through X, is a necessary
and noble activity, but disaster can be
held off only so long, then so long.
We need to pay attention also to the
integrative process. Scientists in par
ticular can make a valuable contribu
tion towards stability for by tradition
there already exists some sense of
connection between research com
munities of the East and West; and so

they may serve if individual scientists
can repel the growing politicization
that would undermine this rela
tionship. A useful strategy, for exam
ple, is to answer requests for reprints
by letters. Any contact we make
bears on the race between integra
tion and disintegration.
Before we achieve an integrated
coexistence we must first accept it.
No easy. Suppose that we find a way
of making missile silos absolutely un
breakable, beyond the reach of any
conceivable technology. So we say to
the Soviets, "Here's how you do it. Be

suspicious and examine it, but then
put it in place so that neither of us
need to worry about the threat of a
counterforce first strike. We will gain
in stability at no loss of security."
If you think this kind of attitude
should be easy for our leaders to
adopt, consider how difficult it is for
proponents of the freeze to listen
sympathetically to the perceived
needs of their opponents, or for
those committed to deterrence to ac
cept the fears of others as their own.
