# The
						selfishness of protest

### 
Dear Jo(e),
You've been on my mind every
time I've written a column this year
and I didn't want to leave this page
without telling you so. I don't sup
pose you've read many of those col
umns; I know how busy things can
get around he r e. jQst the same, I'm
hoping this note will find you. Maybe
you'll pick it up off the seat next to
you just as you're wondering how to
burn five minutes before class starts.
It may seem a little strange to get a
letter from me, since we've probably
never met. I sure heard enough
about you before I came, from Time
and Newsweek and a few friends
with recent university ties. They said
you're on the complete and utter
make, that instead of a moral and so
cial conscience you have a homing
device tuned in to a corporate
boardrooms. With only that descrip
tion to go on, I haven't been able to
pick you out around campus.
In fact, I'm not sure you really exist.
But I wanted to write anyway. I wrote
Santa Claus once or twice after I'd
started to wonder, too.
A few people I've run into this year

sounded as if they could be you. But
each time they turned out to be a lit
tle more thoughtful and complex
than you're supposed to be. The only
thing that keeps me thinking you're
around here is the turnout at this
spring's few political occasions. It
would take someone like you to miss
a set of events that tackled the critical
issues as well as Disorientation Week
did. You might have made it to one or
two of the headliner events, curious
to see Angela Davis or Linda Lovelace
or Ralph Nader up close. But no issue
brought you out. You weren't about
to be disoriented.
Hooverville, too, was a fine way to
hear and think about the issues. It
was even fun. And I know you missed
that. There might have been 2500
people there and half of them might
have been Stanford students. And it
was your loss.
I honestly don't buy a lot of the
conventional line about you. It
makes no sense to me that you'd be a
completely different creature than
the New Left students of yesteryear,
pragmatic where they were idealistic,
greedy where they were giving. Time
might change that quickly, but peo
ple don't. I doubt that you're more
self-centered than I was when I oc
cupied administration buildings 12
years ago: we just pay ourselves in
different currencies, that's all.
So I don't feel at all comfortable
preaching to you. Which is fine, be
cause I wouldn't get very far if I tried.
I'm writing only to make a sugges
tion: as you pursue your own in
terests, just as everyone does, slow
down now and then and think about
what your interests are.
You already know all this in the
context cf one issue, the nuclear
arms race. You're thinking and talk
ing about it, you've gone to a film or
two, you've signed a petition. I think
that might even be your window that
had the anti-nuke banner hanging
out of it a while back. You're clear on
what you'll get out of disarmament,
how it ups the survival odds for you
and your family and the world you'd
like to run. I'd like to march next to
you sometime soon on this one.
You care about the arms issue be
cause you know you can't hide from
the likely consequences of current
nuclear policy. What I want you to
consider, as carefully as you can, is
whether you can hide from the con
sequences of any of this adminis
tration's major policies.
I don't think you can. Let's assume
for a minute that everything goes
right for you at Stanford, that you're
one of the few that win this game.
You're bright and you're ready to
work hard. Let's say you also stay
lucky. You pick up every merit badge
in sight and sweep through law, med
ical, engineering, or business school
like Sherman through Georgia. You
knock the socks off half a dozen re
cruiters, leave them waiting by their
telephone as you sift through the job
offers.
You pick the fattest one and it is fat
indeed. Within a few years you have
your own walnut-lined office, your
German car, your husband or wife,
and your 2.3 kids. Let's go for broke
and say you can put enough away to
start buying a Sunset Magazine
home. Everything comes to you on
time and in its place, just as it did for
winners in the '50s and '60s.
But we're not living in the '50s or
'60s. The young stars of that era could
buy a measure of safety, security and
assured product quality that isn't for
sale anymore. No really efficient in
sulation from human suffering and
injustice has been manufactured for
years. The Cleavers kept busy figur
ing out what mischief Wally and the
Beaver were getting into upstairs.
Your worry list is going to be a little
tougher than that.
Your environment, first of all, will
be the same as everyone else's. You'll
live with the consequences of the
current drive to bring undeveloped
areas into mineral and timber pro

duction and to repeal standard regu
lations on air and water pollution. In
much the same way today's retreat
from standards on food, drugs and
truth-in-packaging will shape the in
ternal environment of your gracious
spacious home. What will this coun
try be like after a decade of environ
mental deregulation? I have a few
images, and none of them include an !
escape hatch for the wealthy.
How about your professional life? ■
We've already assumed that you'll
move very far, very fast, all according
to plan. Never mind that our assump
tion ignores the ongoing contraction
of the economy, the daily folding of
businesses and firms that tradi
tionally offer launching pads to
young graduates. Forget all that.
Somehow, someway you won.
The problem is all those losers out
there. The ones thrown out of work
who can't even think about buying
the product your company makes, or
finances, or transports, or insures, or
packages, or defends against law
suits. They had jobs, these former
consumers, before supply-side eco
nomics gave corporations the profits
and license to buy each other up and
squeeze out .smaller competitor?. Or
before incalculable defense spend
ing forced the government to com
pete for every loan dollar in sight,
pushing home and business mort
gages beyond almost everyone's
reach.
So as you're flying up the corpo
rate ladder two rungs at a time, how's
your corporation doing? We're al
ready discovering how hard it is to
confine the damage in a tightly in
terwoven economy. The only Sector
that should sit still for Reaganomics is
the armaments industry. And that
one has a certain unique potential for
putting itself out of business, if you
know what I mean.
Maybe this sounds like pure
rhetoric to you. Maybe it's reminding
you why your avoid this page when
ever you can. All this fortune-telling
is obviously speculative; any one of
the current policies could turn out to
be less devastating than I expect. But
I'm sure of one thing: unchecked, to
day's trends will make the rich richer
and fewer and the poor poorer and
more plentiful.
And angrier. And that, finally, is
what you'll have to worry about. I
might have some of the details
wrong, your particular enterprise
might find some miraculous oasis of
prosperity in the economic desert.
But it's a sure thing that you'll be de
fending your winnings against the
growing masses of losers. In the Third
World, the old losers have already
decided to be winners; their varied
exits from our empire is another rea
son why the good old days are gone
for American corporations.
And in this country, you're not
going to find the losers very good
sports, either. The game they lost to
you was rigged; many of this page's
best pieces have explained how
that's so. The losers know that it's
rigged, so they feel no obligation to
accept the results.
So it's not your conscience that will
keep you up nights. There's no tell
ing what millions of angry people
who think they have nothing to lose
will do. But even with our assump
tion that everything goes your way, I
believe the best you can hope for is a
comfortable bunk in a fortress that is
under constant seige.
Please understand what I'm trvinß
to suggest: not to think less, but to
think more about your own interests,
to think hard about what your
choices really are. Newsweek says
you're choosing a plush life of social
isolation, safe, sedate and secure. I
say that choice doesn't exist. What do
you say?
Thanks for sharing your campus
with me this year. Best of luck to bblh \
of us. I bet we need It.
