Horror stories
The problem with the Student Health
Center at the University of Texas, accord
ing to an article in The Daily Texan, is un
realistic expectations and "horror
stories." One student, who asked not to
be identified, said she was told by the SHC
staff that she might have fractured a ver
tebra in her neck as a result of a car acci
dent. The next day, another doctor told
her a hair on the lensofthe X-ray machine
was what made the X-ray show the pos
sible fracture.
Another student had an appendectomy
at the SHC and a few days later had to un
dergo further surgery in Houston to clean
infectious material from his abdominal
cavity.
Dr. Jack Crosby, associate diredtor of
the center, defended the SHC by saying
that in the first case it is not uncommon
for foreign material to get into an X-ray
film holder, casting shadows on the de
veloping film that would resemble a frac
ture. An experienced radiologist would
have detected the error, he said, as the
SHC radiologist later did.
Crosby said the physician who per
formed the appendectomy performed
the surgery "perfectly" and that com
plications such as those the student had

are unavoidable in a small percentage of
operations. Crosby said, "A lot of what
gets us into trouble is an unrealistic ex
pectation of what medicine can do.
Judgment calls may turn out to be wrong
and that's why we encourage getting a
second opinion."
Although university Ombudsman
Debra Stanton siad that she received 36
complaints against the SHC between Jan
uary 1978 and January 1982, only one
third of them were complaints against
services. However, Stanton said she had a
"gut-level feeling" that students hae
more problems with the SHC than they
bring to her office, because some of her
students friends have said they will not
use the SHC. Ah Student health centers!
Popular past
At Princeton, according to the Daily
Princetonian, history professors are
pleased that their field is the most popular
major. For the second year in a row, more
sophomores chose history as their major.
The politics department was second, with
economics, English, biology and psy
chology following behind. One history
prof commented, "Every American uni
versity has lost half or three-quarters of its
history majors in recent years. Princeton

is a unique place in this way."
just for the record, at Stanford as of Oc
tober 1981, history ws behind engineer
ing, economics, human biology, biology,
English, political science and psychology.
Plagiarism or not?
A senior at Princeton has filed stuit
against the university askingforan injunc
tion to block the Discipline Committee's
decision to withhold her degree for one
year on charges of plagiarism. According
to the Daily Princetonian, Gabrielle
Napolitano, an English major, was found
guilty of directly copying at least two
pages of a 12-page Spanish paper from a
book without indicating it was a quota
tion. She did, however, cite the text in five
footnotes throughout the paper.
Napolitano contends that she did not
plagiarize because she did not try to hide
the source.
Napolitano is also asking the Chancery
Division of the New Jersey Superior Court
to prohibit the university from notifying
law schools to which she applied.
In a preliminary hearing Judge William
Dreier sharply scolded the university for
the severity of its disciplinary action. "I
just question whether the university has
thought sufficiently about the human

problem before it has exacted a particular
penalty," he said.
Napolitano has the support of her
thesis adviser, who said that in his classes,
her paper would not constitute
plagiarism.
However, Sylvia Molloy, teacher of
"The Spanish-American Novel," the
course involved, wrote that she was cer
tain that the paper was largely
plagiarized. Napolitano maintains an A
minus grade point average and was nomi
nated by the university for a Rhodes
Scholarship this year.
Breathe deeply
If you take your running seriously,
there's a new device on the market which
can create an atmosphere equal to train
ing at 7500 feet. According to the Univer
sity Daily of Texas Tech, the PO2 Aerobic
Exerciser resembles an oxygen tank and
recycles the air the athlete breathes.
Coming off each side of the mask are
tubes for inspired and expired air. The
tubes are connected to a pair of reservior
tanks mounted on a simple backpack.
One student said although you have to
run twice as hard, the exerciser makes
things easier in the long run. Cross-coun
try running coach James Morris said that
everyone who has used the PO2 has had
"a remarkable improvement" on his run
ning time.

One runner siad the only disadvantages
are frightened onlookers who express
amazement and curiousity. Some people,
he said, thik the device combats pollu
tion.
Class anyone?
Students at the University of South Car
olina can no longer skip class during
prime sun hours without paying a price.
According to the Gamecock, the Faculty
Senate voted to set the number of accep
table class absences at 10 percent of the
total class meetings. Students are now
permitted to miss 25 percent of the total
class meetings without penalty. Prof,.
Trevor Howard-Hill said, "The object of
the attendance policy is not to penalize
anyone .... it's an attempt to influence
behavior." Under the present policy,
many studetns skip classes because
they're entitled to, according to Howard-
Hill.
The 10-percent proposal may create
problems for studnts since it calls for only
an average of four to six acceptable
absences from classes meeting three
times a week, and only two to fur abences
from bi-weekly classes. Howard-Hill said,
however, that many professors are willing
to make exceptions if students show in
terest and concern before they run into

trouble with absences.
