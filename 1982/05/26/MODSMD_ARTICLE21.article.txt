## Card opens series bid against Hawaii tomorrow 
### Adam Berns 
Stanford received confirma
tion of its wild-card spot in the
NCAA Western Regional I
Baseball Tournament and will
travel to Fresno tomorrow to
participate in the four-team
double-elimination tour
nament.
The Cardinal (45-16-1) will
face Hawaii (59-15) tomorrow
at 4 p.m. while Fresno State
plays Pepperdine at 7 p.m. in
the other opening round con
test.
Last week the Cardinal bom
barded Oregon State for 30
runs and has won its last ten
games.
Ranked No. 18 nationally,
Stanford has scored 109 runs in
the last ten games and has
boosted its team batting aver
age to .316. Showing few signs
of its midseason slump, the
Cardinal is led by left fielder
Mike Dotterer (.376, 7 HR, 36
RBIs, 21 SBs), first baseman
Mike Aldrete (.365, 54 RBIs),
and second baseman Steve
Buechele (.322, 34 RBIs). Seven
starters are currently batting
over.3oo.
Stanford senior Brian
Mignano will pitch tomorrow
against Hawaii. Mignano, who
has a 12-5 record and 3.55 ERA,

needs just one more victory to
tie the Stanford mark for most
career wins (27) and wins in a
single season (13). The other
probable starters are Brian
Myers (7-2, 3.74 ERA) and
freshman David Harris (7-0,
2.37).
Relief pitching seems to be
the Card's biggest weakness
entering the series. Plagued by
injuries, Stanford will rely
mainly on southpaw Jeff
Ballard and righthander Steve
Cottrell for its short and long
relief.
Fresno State, ranked No. 5
nationally, figures to be the
tournament favorite but rhost
of the Cardinal players are not
worried. Stanford, which took
second in the Central Regional
to Texas last year, is entering
this series a more experienced
team.
Indicative of Stanford's at
titude are center fielder Darryl
Stephens' remarks about
Fresno State.
"They are a good team," Ste
phens said about the Bulldogs,
"but I do feel that we are bet
ter. We just set a school record
for most victories in a season."
Although Stanford coach
Mark Marquess is confident
that his team can do well, he
recognizes that Fresno State

will be tough to beat.
"We're playing very well at
this juncture of the season, al
though we recognize that we'll
be facing some of the NCAA's
premier teams here in Fresno.
Considering their home field
advantage, Fresno State is
probably the pre-tournament
favorite."
The Cardinal, however,
won't be able to look past any
of the teams in the tour
nament. Hawaii, who it plays
tomorrow, is ranked No. 8 na
tionally and won the Western
Conference last weekend with
a 12-5 win over San Diego State.
Hawaii, which is batting .314
as a team, is led by infielder
Howard Dashefsky (.372, 52
RBI) and left fielder Greg
Oniate (.356, 54 RBI).
Pepperdine also fields a
strong team this year. Runner
up in the Southern California
Baseball Association with a
44-19-1 record, Pepperdine
leads the nation in stolen bases
with 261 in 330 attempts. Four
players have stolen 32 bases or
more, led by center fielder
Ralph Sheffield with 52 in 66
trys.
Earlier in the year, Stanford
swept Pepperdine 4-2 and 3-2
at Sunken Diamond.
