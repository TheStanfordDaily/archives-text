With the NCAA women's
golf championships beginning
this morning, Stanford coach
Tim Baldwin is "reinforced"
about his team's chances of
winning the title.
The Card coach hopes his
squad will be in the top five af
ter today's round. "We're
going to try to play good, solid,
aggressive golf," he said.
Baldwin thinks a 72-hole
score of 1210 will win the team
title and a four under par 288
the individual crown. The four
day event begins today and fin
ishes Saturday. Nineteen teams
and 17 individuals are entered.
"I think anybody that plays
four consistent rounds will win
it," said San Jose State's Juli
Inkster â€” one of the favorites
to capture the individual title.
