## Monetary policies debated in panel talk 
### Steve Kaufman 
Restrictive monetary policies
pursued by the Federal Reserve Bank
since October of 1979 have led to
high interest rates and a deepening
of the current recession, said three
out of the four panelists in a dis
cussion of monetary policy held last
night at Annenberg Auditorium.
The fourth panelist, Brian Motley,
a senior economist at the Federal Re
serve's branch in San Francisco, vig
orously defended the monetary poli
cies of the Fed, which he said were
formulated in response to the pub
lic's demand for control over infla
tion.
"The money growth rate is a key
determinant of inflation," Motley
said. "The Fed has been controlling
the money supply very tightly, and
the result has been a decrease in in
flation. As far as we're concerned,

our policies have been fairly suc
cessful."
Criticizing Motley's remarks was
Economics Prof. Paul Evans. He
agreed with the Fed's policy of fight
ing inflation, but was dissatisfied with
the accelerated pace by which it was
reducing the money supply. "I'm a
advocate of gradualism," explained
Evans. "This is where one pursues dis
inflation procedures, but at a pace so
slow that one never creates forces in
society which allows the policy to be
reversed."
Evans cited the current goal of two
years set by the Fed for bringing infla
tion under control as unrealistic and
proposed a 10-year period as a more
reasonable amount of time.
Also speaking against current Fed
policies was Stanley Fischer, visiting
professor of economics from MIT.
He cited the increasing demand for

dollars in the economy and called on
the Fed toadjust itssupply according
ly-
"We have no business being in a
recession," Fischer said, "and much
is caused by the Fed's obsession with
wringing inflation out of the econo
my." He said that the Fed should ad
just its supply of dollars to meet the
demand and that high money growth
should take place in times of eco
nomic recession.
Offering a different opinion on the
issue of Federal reserve policies was
Ronald McKinnon, a professor of ec
onomics. He criticized what he called
"closed-market economics," point
ing to the recent economic prosper
ity in Japan as well as the continued
hardening of the West German mark
as signs of economic competition
with the United States.
"It is abundantly clear that the

United States, Japan and West Ger
many can no longer formulate their
monetary policies independently,"
he explained. Instability in the mon
ey supply of West Germany and
Japan will negate efforts by the Fed to
cut inflation even if the Fed meets a
targeted growth rate, McKinnon
said. "It is clear that Germany, Japan
and the United States have to harmo
nize their monetary policies in order
for the U.S. to return to the economic
prosperity of the 1950's and 1960'5.,"
he added.
All panelists cited high interest
rates as a problem symptomatic of
the Fed's strict monetary supply poli
cies. Motley cited the need to bring
the current Federal deficit under
control, as well as convince investors
that the defecit will not be
monetized.
