British ship damaged in large Argentine raid
London — Argentine planes "badly damaged" a British warship off
the Falkland islands Monday in another mass raid on the fleet, the
fourth in five days.
Defense Secretary John Nott said the ship was "in difficulty" but said
he had no information on casualties. The vessel was not identified.
However, defense sources said the vessel is a destroyer of the Sheffield
class.
In Buenos Aires, a military source told The Los Angeles Times that Ar
gentine planes sank a British frigate and a transport ship in attacks
"north of the Malvinas (Falklands)" yesterday. It was not known wheth
er both reports concerned the same warship, and British reports made
no mention of any sinkings or further damage to British ships.
"In the last hour there has been quite a significant, a major attack, on
our ships," Nott told an interviewer for Independent Television News
on Monday night. "And I'm afraid the bad news is that one of our ships
has been badly damaged and she's in difficulty."
Defense ministry spokesman lan McDonald later told reporters that
rescue operations were under way.
Nott said, "We were anticipating a mass raid of the kind that has mate
rialized in the last few hours," pointing out that yesterday was Argen
tina's independence day.
The Royal Navy has lost two frigates — the Ardent and the Antelope
— to Argentine air attacks since last Friday, when the British invasion
force sent ashore at San Carlos Bay on East Falkland Island, exactly seven
weeks after the Argentines seized the islands.
The warships were defending the landing force and have taken a
heavy toll of Argentine Mirage and Skyhawk jets in the attacks. The De
fense Ministry claims 16 Argentine planes were downed Friday, six on
Sunday and eight on Monday, one more than originally reported.
