British ship damaged in large Argentine raid
London — Argentine planes "badly damaged" a British warship off
the Falkland islands Monday in another mass raid on the fleet, the
fourth in five days.
Defense Secretary John Nott said the ship was "in difficulty" but said
he had no information on casualties. The vessel was not identified.
However, defense sources said the vessel is a destroyer of the Sheffield
class.
In Buenos Aires, a military source told The Los Angeles Times that Ar
gentine planes sank a British frigate and a transport ship in attacks
"north of the Malvinas (Falklands)" yesterday. It was not known wheth
er both reports concerned the same warship, and British reports made
no mention of any sinkings or further damage to British ships.
"In the last hour there has been quite a significant, a major attack, on
our ships," Nott told an interviewer for Independent Television News
on Monday night. "And I'm afraid the bad news is that one of our ships
has been badly damaged and she's in difficulty."
Defense ministry spokesman lan McDonald later told reporters that
rescue operations were under way.
Nott said, "We were anticipating a mass raid of the kind that has mate
rialized in the last few hours," pointing out that yesterday was Argen
tina's independence day.
The Royal Navy has lost two frigates — the Ardent and the Antelope
— to Argentine air attacks since last Friday, when the British invasion
force sent ashore at San Carlos Bay on East Falkland Island, exactly seven
weeks after the Argentines seized the islands.
The warships were defending the landing force and have taken a
heavy toll of Argentine Mirage and Skyhawk jets in the attacks. The De
fense Ministry claims 16 Argentine planes were downed Friday, six on
Sunday and eight on Monday, one more than originally reported.
And earlier yesterday, before Nott's
disclosure that another ship had been se
verely damaged, the ministry said three
more Argentine fighters were shot down
by ship-to-air missiles off San Carlos Bay.
The Argentine military source in turn
claimed that two British Harrier jets and
three helicopters were shot down yester
day in an attack on Stanley, the islands'
capital.
The British Defense Ministry said Ar
gentine positions around the Stanley air
field were sheljed by both planes and
ships yesterday, but that all planes re
turned safely to their carriers with the task
force.
Detailing the air-sea battle off San
Carlos, a ministry spokesman said one Ar
gentine Mirage was shot down by a ship
to-air missile after narrowly missing a Brit
ish warship with a bomb. The pilot sur
vived and was taken aboard the ship, then
transferred to a field hospital ashore with
a leg injury.
Pope to go to Argentina
Buenos Aires, Argentina — Pope John
Paul 11, in a dramatic gesture to try to end
the Anglo-Argentine war over the
Falkland Islands, has offered to travel
directly to Argentina from his British visit,
the Vatican's ambassador disclosed yes
terday.
Monsignor Übaldo Calabresi, the Vat
ican's ambassador to Argentina, released
to news agencies the text of a letter from
John Paul to Argentine President
Leopoldo Galtiere.
The papal letter, "written in my own

hand," states, "I would be willing to go,
directly if necessary, from England to Ar
gentina and there, among you and with
you, my dear brothers and sisters, raise
the same prayer for the victory of peace
over war."
John Paul is to leave Friday for a six-day
visit to Britain, and was scheduled to re
turn to Rome on June 2.
"Such a visit could bring tranquility and
contribute to the easing of the bellicose
atmosphere," said an Argentine diplomat
who asked not to be identified. "The visit
would surely be well received."
John Paul said Saturday he was hoping
to go "soon" to Argentina, where 95 per
cent of the people are Roman Catholic.
The pope has pleaded unsuccessfully
for a cease-fire between the warring na
tions. It was earlier feared that John Paul
would give up his tour — the first trip to
Britain by a pope — because the Argen
tines and other Latin Americans might in
terpret the visit as a pro-British gesture.
The pope's visit to mainly Protestant
Britain was planned long before April 2,
when Argentina seized the British colony
in the South Atlantic and fighting broke
out between the two countries.
Ijtouse nears budget con-
Washington — The House rejected an
invitation to sign up for a mass
"kamikaze" mission yesterday, spurning
a plan to balance the budget with $114
billion in spending cuts in a single year.
The 242-182 vote was prelude to the
showdown still to come involving rival
plans endorsed by President Ronald Rea

gan and the House Democratic leader
ship. Both envision deficits of over $100
billion for the next fiscal year.
A third blueprint, drawn by moderates
of both political parties, also wascontend
ing for votes.
Final votes on the plans are not ex
pected until today or tomorrow, although
House Republican Leader Bob Michel (R
-lll.) seemed confident he could assemble
a majority behind the Reagan-backed
plan.
Arguing for his balanced budget plan,
Rep. John Rousselot (R-Calif.) declared:
"We have talked about it, discussed it, re
hashed it. Now we can vote for it. The
American people are asking why not
now."
House Democratic Leader Jim Wright
of Texas assailed it as a blueprint for
"enormously Draconian hurt" through its
across-the-board spending freeze for one
year.
But Rep. Larry Hopkins (R-Ky.) said,
"Maybe that's what the country needs, is
a few kamikaze pilots here in Washing
ton."
Michel's assertion that he would not be
surprised to see a majority for the GOP
budget was in contrast to an assessment
by Rep. James Jones (D-Okla.). Jones,
chairman of the House Budget Commit
tee, said neither the GOP nor Democratic
plan was yet assured of a majority.
But Michel also left open the possibility
that he would vote for the moderates'
plan if both his and the Democratic pro
posals failed.
In addition, leaders of both parties said
the final outcome depended on the fate

of proposals to increase spending for
Medicare, a subject of increasingly bitter
controversy between Republicans and
Democrats.
Under the rules established for the de
bate, all three budgets will be voted on.
The last one that receives a majority will
prevail, subject to a final, ratifying vote on
the House floor.
Reagan, who met with GOP leaders
yesterday before departing for California,
is backing a proposal calling for a $102.6
billion deficit, declining to $52.2 billion in
1985. It calls for $95 billion in tax increases
over three years and a reduction of $28
billion in the administration's earlier
plans for a military buildup.
Also included are nearly $76 billion in
reductions in a variety of domestic and
benefit programs.
Iraq retreats from port city
Beirut, Lebanon — Iraq yesterday con
ceded its forces had retreated from the
Iranian oil port of Khorramshahr after a
25-day battle.
Iranian leaders rejoiced at regaining
the last Iraqi stronghold on the southern
front and said they would not rest until
they brought down Iraq's President Sad
dam Hussein.
Iran also warned other Arab nations not
to side with Iraq, or "take orders from the
United States," and indicated that might
prompt military retaliation.
Other Persian Gulf nations, the United
States and the European Common Mar
ket issued new calls for a peaceful settle
ment of the 20-month-old war.
Iraq's retreat from Khorramshahr

capped a 40-day offensive in which Iran
said its forces recaptured half of the 7720
square miles of land lost to Iraq in the first
weeks of the war.
Iran claims to have recaptured the oil
rich Khuzistan province at the northern
tip of the Persian Gulf, but Iranian com
muniques have not mentioned Iraqi-oc
cupied areas to the north.
It is presumed Iraqi forces still are dug
in west of the Iranian mountain city of
Sanandaj, 240 miles west of Tehran, and
strategic areas farther south, and Iraq in
sisted in its communique that the retreat
from Khorramshahr is not the "final out
come."
Stocks drop slightly
New York — The stock market staged a
late retreat yesterday, wiping out earlier
gains that followed the first reduction of
the prime lending rate by a major bank
since March.'
The Dow Jones average of 30 in
dustrials, which rose 3.90 points over the
past two sessions, slid 1.81 to 834.57. The
blue-chip average had been up 5.23
points in the first half hour of trading, but
gave ground throughout the day.
