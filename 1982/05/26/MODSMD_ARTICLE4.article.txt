# Stanford-in-Britain may move to Oxford

Although approval by the Board of Trustees is
still needed, the Overseas Studies office is "active
ly developing plans" to move the Stanford Pro
gram in Britain from Cliveden to Oxford in the
near future, according to Mark Mancall, director
of Overseas Studies. He said the target date for the
opening of the Oxford program is September,
1984.
According to Ray Bacchetti, vice provost for
management and budgets, the Academic Affairs
and Development Committee and the Finance and
Administration Committee of the Board will de
cide at their June 11 meeting whether to grant
"concept approval" for the move.
Bacchetti said there were no specific criteria
which the trustees follow, but rather they will be
"looking for validation of the academic judgement
— would it be a better program from an academic
point of view?" This concept approval would allow
Overseas Studies to prepare a more refined
analysis over the summer, which it would then
present to the trustees in September for budgetary
approval, Bacchetti said.
According to Mancall, Overseas Studies has
been exploring for years the idea of moving the

program out of Cliveden. He said that the major
motivation was a "desire to raise the academic
level... Cliveden is isolated. It is a country estate
that would have been nice for students in the 19th
century, but not in the 21st. It is important for stu
dents to get deeply involved in the culture in
which they are studying."
Cliveden is classified as a British national his
torical monument and Mancall did not know ex
actly what would happen to it if Stanford leaves.
This would be decided by the National Trust, a Brit
ish organization which administers such mon
uments and from which Stanford rents the estate,
he said.
Although Overseas Studies has spent a lot of
time looking in London, Mancall said that "for a
combination of academic possibilities and finan
cial considerations, we decided on Oxford." He
claimed that London was simply too expensive to
be considered as a viable option.
Oxford is approximately 45 minutes northwest
of London by train — about the same travel time as
from Cliveden, he said.
Mancall emphasized that Oxford itself, "is one
of the largest cities in England and an industrial
center." As far as culture, there is "lots. It is a major

University center — music, theatre, you just name
it ... You walk out of the door and a theatre is
three minutes away. One of the best bookstores in
the English-speaking world is two minutes away,"
he said.
Although Mancall stress that everything regard
ing the program is still very tentative, he said that
Stanford has a "verbal non-binding agreement"
with Magdalen College, one of the colleges which
compose Oxford. This agreement deals primarily
with the refurbishment of a set of houses with
apartments owned by Magdalen, which would be
rented to Stanford in order to house about 50 stu
dents and one or two Stanford professors. There is
currently space for 80 students each quarter at
Cliveden.
"We will not provide dining facilities" as at
Cliveden, Mancall noted. "We are exploring vari
ous options ... It will probably be like Tours," he
said, where students are given a bi-weekly food al
lowance and may go out to eat, picnic, or cook at a
small kitchen in the villa.
Regarding academics at Oxford, Mancall re
peated that none of the details have as yet been
finalized. Up to this point the primary concern of

THE STANFORD PROGRAM
IN BRITAIN— which has
been located in this isolated
old mansion in Cliveden
since 1965, may be moved to
Oxford in 1984 if the plan for
mulated by Overseas Studies
is approved by the Board of
Trustees. If the plan is
enacted Stanford would rent
a set of houses from Oxford
University which could ac
comodate about 50 students.
