# ASSU Senate meets for last time
## 
### Kathy Bodovitz Senior staff writer 
In a long final meeting of the year, the ASSU Senate last
night established a Program Board to allocate the Pro
gram Fee money for next year.
The board will take over Program Fee allocations from
the finance committee and will be comprised of six at
large members of the association, one member of the
senate Finance Committee, and the senate deputy chair
and a Council of Presidents member — the latter two ex
officio without a vote.
The senate bill states that "Student organizations ap
plying for funding shall be granted an interview by the
Board .. . The full board shall then recommend to the
senate an allocation from the appropriate fund(s) for this
organization."
The senate also passed a resolution recommeding that
the Office of Residential Education and the Office of the
Dean of Student Affairs "establish a process whereby res
idences may request the integration of graduate and un
dergraduate students.... "
Explaining his resolution, graduate Senator Jim
McGrath noted that some undergraduate houses, specif
ically the co-ops that did not fill up in the first round of
the housing draw, have expressed interest in housing
graduate students, but that no administrative system
presently exists in the University to accommodate the re
quests.
McGrath added that when the Sterling Quadrangle

opens all undergraduate housing demands should be
met, with about 370 spaces to spare. For next year,
1982-83, McGrath said that from 10 to 100 undergraduate
spaces could be filled by graduate students.
In an effort to revitalize and improve the under
graduate districting system for next year, the senate
voted to reduce the number of districts from the present
35 to 20.
With only 20 districts every senator and alternate will
be assigned to one district and the interns and graduate
students who this year had their own districts and still
wish to participate will be assigned as additional distric
trepresentatives in the larger districts.
The evening's guest, Ellen Oppenheim, director of
Tresidder Memorial Union (TMU), spoke to the senate
on the goals and present concerns of the Union. She said
TMU was chartered as a community center and provides
services needed by and responsive to the Stanford com
munity (the food services, the bank), social, recreational,
educational, and cultural programs, and learning op
portunities for students.
TMU's three top priorities, Oppenheim said, are in
creasing student involvement in the organization — in
student supervising and entrepreneurial projects, in
creasing space use planning, and improving the physical
appearance and functioning of the building.
In the area of food service, Oppenheim said that one
main focus next year will be changing and improving En
cina Station.
