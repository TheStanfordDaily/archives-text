# Co-ops not filled after second round of 'Draw'
## 
### J. Raymond Mills 
The co-operative houses garnered
only five new residents in the second
round of the Spring Housing Draw,
and co-ops account for 39 of the 51
unfilled housing spaces, according to
results released by Residential Educa
tion on Monday.
The other 12 unassigned spacesare
vacancies for men in the French
House, which has had trouble attract
ing males to that residence in the past
few years.
Of the spaces in the co-ops that re
main unfilled after Round Two, 19
are in Synergy (eight for women, 11
for men), 11 in Terra (all men), eight
in Columbae (five men, three wom
en), and one men's space in Phi Psi.
Despite the apparent difficulty in
filling the co-operative residences,
Rodger Whitney, assistant dean of
student affairs and director of the
Housing Center said that there is no
immediate plan to restructure or
consolidate any of the co-op houses
currently operating on campus. Pres
ently, co-op occupants share in the
cooking and cleaning duties of the
house and pay considerably less for
room and board than most campus
residences.
"We'll probably review the situ

ations of all the houses that had trou
ble filling this year, we may have to
look at some reductions, however, it
doesn't mean a discontinuation of
programs at all," Whitney said.
University administrators are un
sure of the reason co-ops are not
higher priority residence choices for
students. University President
Donald Kennedy, in a recent in
terview for KZSU's Campus Con
ference said, "I'm at a loss to explain
why co-op houses are in particular
difficulty because that strikes me as a
nice arrangement in many ways, and
the co-op houses have been very
successful. I really don't know why
they didn't attract more favorable at
tention this time around."
Whitney acknowledged thata pub
licity problem coupled with other
factors may have led to the current
state of the residences and said that
the co-ops are taking steps to al
leviate the apparent communication
g<ip. Representatives of the co-op
theme houses set up a table in White
Plaza today that offered information
on the six residences here and on
how to get on a waiting list.
Residence Associates (RAs) at the
co-ops in question attribute the de
cline in interested students to several

factors. "I suppose there would be a
tendency to attribute it (draw results)
to a conservative trend in the student
body, but we filled up last year and I
don't think there would be that big a
difference in just one year," Synergy
RA Cynthia Vitt-Jarvis said.
"Our invisibility fosters out
rageous stereotypes and rumors" she
added. "We've heard everything
from stories that we have chickens
running through the house to
rumors that the way we pick rooms is
to have the men and women pick
names from a hat and the person of
the opposite sex they choose would
sleep together in a heart-shaped bed
until the end of the year."

However, Jim Morrison, RA at Phi
Psi, believes that it is the co-ops
themselves that should become
more accommodating. "I think the
co-ops should make themselves a
more desirable place to live for more
people," he said. "There is an image
of co-ops being dirty places to live
and this is sometimes true; most peo
ple just don't want to live at a place
like that."
The difficulty in assigning men to
the French House, according to
Whitney, is that there is simply a

much higher ratio of women to men
in the French department, which
prompted Res Ed to change the male
to female ratio there to 15-19 this year
from 17-17 last year. Despite this ad
justment, 12 male vacancies remain
unfilled.
Joan Kitterman, RA at the French
House, explained another problem
with which the house must cope.
"Many people think that to live here
one 112 as to be fluent in French, and
that isn't the case.
Results of Round Two of the draw
also reveal that 44 students in the as
signable group are currently un
assigned, an increase over the 17
guaranteed students not assigned at
this time last year. The reason for this,
Whitney said, was that some students
were too selective in their prefer
ences in relation to their draw num
bers. These people will be assigned
to on-campus housing sometime
before September, he said.
Kennedy has already confirmed
that the new dormitory currently un
der construction will eliminate the
need for an "unguaranteed year" in
the University housing system, how
ever, Whitney said that such a change
was not likely to occur next year.

more desirable place to live for more
people," he said. "There is an image
of co-ops being dirty places to live
and this is sometimes true; most peo
ple just don't want to live at a place
like that."
The difficulty in assigning men to
the French House, according to
Whitney, is that there is simply a

much higher ratio of women to men
in the French department, which
prompted Res Ed to change the male
to female ratio there to 15-19 this year
from 17-17 last year. Despite this ad
justment, 12 male vacancies remain
unfilled.
Joan Kitterman, RA at the French
House, explained another problem
with which the house must cope.
"Many people think that to live here
one 112 as to be fluent in French, and
that isn't the case.
Results of Round Two of the draw
also reveal that 44 students in the as
signable group are currently un
assigned, an increase over the 17
guaranteed students not assigned at
this time last year. The reason for this,
Whitney said, was that some students
were too selective in their prefer
ences in relation to their draw num
bers. These people will be assigned
to on-campus housing sometime
before September, he said.
Kennedy has already confirmed
that the new dormitory currently un
der construction will eliminate the
need for an "unguaranteed year" in
the University housing system, how
ever, Whitney said that such a change
was not likely to occur next year.
The co-operative houses garnered
only five new residents in the second
round of the Spring Housing Draw,
and co-ops account for 39 of the 51
unfilled housing spaces, according to
results released by Residential Educa
tion on Monday.
The other 12 unassigned spacesare
vacancies for men in the French
House, which has had trouble attract
ing males to that residence in the past
few years.
Of the spaces in the co-ops that re
main unfilled after Round Two, 19
are in Synergy (eight for women, 11
for men), 11 in Terra (all men), eight
in Columbae (five men, three wom
en), and one men's space in Phi Psi.
Despite the apparent difficulty in
filling the co-operative residences,
Rodger Whitney, assistant dean of
student affairs and director of the
Housing Center said that there is no
immediate plan to restructure or
consolidate any of the co-op houses
currently operating on campus. Pres
ently, co-op occupants share in the
cooking and cleaning duties of the
house and pay considerably less for
room and board than most campus
residences.
"We'll probably review the situ

ations of all the houses that had trou
ble filling this year, we may have to
look at some reductions, however, it
doesn't mean a discontinuation of
programs at all," Whitney said.
University administrators are un
sure of the reason co-ops are not
higher priority residence choices for
students. University President
Donald Kennedy, in a recent in
terview for KZSU's Campus Con
ference said, "I'm at a loss to explain
why co-op houses are in particular
difficulty because that strikes me as a
nice arrangement in many ways, and
the co-op houses have been very
successful. I really don't know why
they didn't attract more favorable at
tention this time around."
Whitney acknowledged thata pub
licity problem coupled with other
factors may have led to the current
state of the residences and said that
the co-ops are taking steps to al
leviate the apparent communication
g<ip. Representatives of the co-op
theme houses set up a table in White
Plaza today that offered information
on the six residences here and on
how to get on a waiting list.
Residence Associates (RAs) at the
co-ops in question attribute the de
cline in interested students to several

factors. "I suppose there would be a
tendency to attribute it (draw results)
to a conservative trend in the student
body, but we filled up last year and I
don't think there would be that big a
difference in just one year," Synergy
RA Cynthia Vitt-Jarvis said.
"Our invisibility fosters out
rageous stereotypes and rumors" she
added. "We've heard everything
from stories that we have chickens
running through the house to
rumors that the way we pick rooms is
to have the men and women pick
names from a hat and the person of
the opposite sex they choose would
sleep together in a heart-shaped bed
until the end of the year."

However, Jim Morrison, RA at Phi
Psi, believes that it is the co-ops
themselves that should become
more accommodating. "I think the
co-ops should make themselves a
more desirable place to live for more
people," he said. "There is an image
of co-ops being dirty places to live
and this is sometimes true; most peo
ple just don't want to live at a place
like that."
