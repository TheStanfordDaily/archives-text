## Sierra Nevada volcano may erupt 
### Los Angeles Times 
A series of small earthquakes near Mam
moth Lakes in California's eastern Sierra
Nevada range has raised the possibility of
some sort of volcanic activity there, Cali
fornia and federal officials said Monday.
Accordingly, the U.S. Geological Survey
and the state Division of Mines and Geolo
gy plan to issue a statement Tuesday put
ting the area on volcanic notice or watch
status.
The Geological Survey has three catego
ries to inform the public of seismic, vol
canic or other developments such as land
slides and avalanches — "notice" having
the lowest level of urgency, "watch" the
second highest and "warning" the most
urgent.
"A 'notice' says in effect that we've rec
ognized certain features in an area that
may give rise to a hazardous situation,"
said Roy Bailey, the survey's chief coordi
nator for the volcanic hazards program. "It
has no specific ti.e connotation.
"A 'watch' implies that we've recog
nized an actice process (at work) instead of
a static situation, that could lead to a haz

ardous situation. A 'warning' implies that
we have some information about the tim
ing of (hat hazardous situation."
Bailey said the Mammoth Lakes region
— rocked by earthquakes for the last two
years — has been in a seismic watch condi
tion for more than a year. Now, he said,
survey scientists are debating whether to
expand that seismic watch to include a vol
canic hazard, or to issue a separate vol
canic notice.
Bailey said in a telephone interview from
his office in Reston, Va., that the debate
ought to be resolved by yesterday and a
formal statement issued.
"There is no reason for undue alarm,"
Bailey cautioned, "but we do feel there is a
necessity to update the public on what is
happening there (in the Mammoth Lakes
region)."
What is happening is that a small area
about two miles east of Mammoth Lakes
Village and one mile north of Sherwin
Lakes — near the intersection California
203 and 395 — has been hit by a sequence
of eight clusters of small earthquakes and
indistinct seismic shudders since June 6

and 7,1980.
The area, explained Robert Cockerham,
a geophysicist in the survey's Office Earth
quake Studies at Menlo Park, Calif., is on
the southern rim of the Long Valley
caldera. The caldera is a large basin formed
about 700,000 years ago by a violent vol
canic eruption. There are indications in
the rock layers of that region of other
arge volcanic eruptions around 1.2 mil
lion and 1.9 million years ago as well.
The eight clusters of recent seismic ac
tivity have shown an upward progression
from a depth of about six miles to about 2
miles below the surface.
"It hasn't been a straight upward line,"
Cockerham said of the plots of the epicen
ters of these small tremors, "but more of a
zigzag line. Still, the trend is upward."
This pattern is suggestive of moving
magma — molten matter — down below.
The same condition was witnessed before
the volcanic eruptions of Mt. St. Helens in
1980. Earth scientists are reasonably certain
that a magma chamber lies beneath the
Long Valley caldera at a depth of about five
miles.
