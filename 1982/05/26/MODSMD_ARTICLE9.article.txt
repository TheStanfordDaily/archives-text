## Conditioning facilities in question Encina, Roble carrying too much weight 
### Bob Cohn 
Considering that any member of the Stanford
community — undergraduate students, graduate
students, faculty and staff — may use them, many
think the Encina Weight Room and Roble Gym's
two Universal weight training machines do not
adequately cater to a campus overflowing with
healthy and athletic-minded people.
Presently, the Encina Gym weight training cen
ter and Roble's two weight machines, one in each
locker room, are the only strength and condition
ing areas open to non-varsity athletes. According
to student Dan Labov, who trains regularly, "The
facilities really are not adequate. They've got es
sentially one decent weight room and during peak
hours, the waits and crowds are often outrageous.
Stanford desperately needs another, or at least a
more complete, training facility."
Tom Richardson, assistant strength coach at
Stanford, said the facilities are "not necessarily
lacking; let's say overused and undermanaged."
Richardson came to The Farm last January from
Southwest State University to relieve some of the
pressure from strength coach Steve Schulz, who
was "just bombarded with work." "What was re
quired was a management for the student sector,"
said Richardson.
One of the biggest complaints heard on campus
about the weight rooms is that they are "simply too
crowded," freshman Cyndie Benjamin said. A Palo
Alto Fire Marshall deemed Encina's capacity at 49
people, yet, according to Richardson, as many as
100 have been in there at one time. Considering
that Roble's facilities are really not adequate for a
complete workout or for crowds of more than 10,
and the best weight facility is for varsity athletes
only, the Encina Weight Room is under tremen
dous pressure to serve the bulk of the interested
Stanford community.
Richardson noted that, "When I got here, it (En
cina) was just harem-scarem and there was no one
to organize that particular facility." Since his ar
rival, Richardson has overseen a refurbishing and
reorganization at Encina designed to produce
maximum efficiency. Essentially what he did was
"reorganize the room and take out the machinery
that was dangerous and organize the room so it
would be most efficient for the free weight and
Universal users."
President of the Stanford Weightlifting Club
Don Leopold, a graduate student in the
Aero & Astro Dept. concurred that Encina's facil
ities are a lot more efficient. Although the restruc
turing has forced many athletes to change their
conditionir.g routines, Leopold sees this as a
positive effect. "I think the majority of the people
like it the way it is now," he said.
Richardson added that "with the new equip
ment and reorganization of the facility, we have all
the elements that are seen in the varsity weight
room, except rehabilitative machinery."
One of Richardson's roles is faculty adviser to
Leopold's weightlifting club. Leopold stressed that
the deterioration of the old facilities and the need

for new ones prompted the club's inception. "The
weight room at Encina was just one of the most
used facilities on campus and it was being neg
lected by the University. So a lot of us students got
together and with the help of Tom, we founded
the club." He added that the University has given
the Club full charge of the room.
Richardson said he volunteered his services as a
faculty representative because he thought it was
important to get some student input in the de
cisions concerning the weight facilities. He said he
hopes to see "student input really maximized as far
as purchase (of new equiment) and organization"
and that this can be accomplished "through the
Weightlifting Club."
Both Richardson and Leopold stressed that the
Club is not merely an organization where a bunch
of guys get together and lift. It's for "anyone who is
concerned with the condition of the room and
wants to have a say about what's going on," said
Leopold. Richardson said that it would be "more
like a service organization." Indeed it was the
members of the Club who instigated the eventual
changes at Encina earlier this month.
One of the goals of the Club is to improve the
safety m the weight rooms. Presently there are
people who are using machines incorrectly and
even working out barefoot. One thing that
Leopold said is being emphasized is educating the
supervisors and "making sure the machines and
weights are being used properly." Richardson
added that "the supervisors are now exclusively
members of the new Stanford Weightlifting Club,"
and thus should be informed about safety and
proper training techniques.
Yet the modified Encina facility does little to re
lieve the problem of overcrowdedness. Rich

ardson, however, is working to solve this situation.
"I have a plan for an expansion of the Roble Gym
facility and that will be for students only. My plan,"
he said, "is to make Roble a co-ed facility and add
some new equipment." The ultimate result would
be a "scaled-down version of Encina."
But the proposal is still in the planning stages. It's
"definitely on the back burner," said Richardson.
"It's a red tape thing and a planning-within-our
own-means type of project." Leopold, who strong
ly supports the plan, insistd, "We have to try to
keep the numbers down in Encina."
Robert Northcutt, a freshman, agreed with the
proposed plan. "They ought to consider fixing up
Roble. They've got some machines, but it's poorly
organized. And going to Encina is like a zoo."
The ultimate goal, according to Leopold, would
be to have "a couple of different weight rooms
around campus, to make it more convenient for
people to use and a whole lot safer." As club presi
dent, Leopold will be around campus this summer
and next year to follow through on the group's
plans. Richardson will also be back next year.
There are some criticisms to the recent mod
ifications. Some Encina-frequenters think that the
changes benefit the users of free weights. Yet both
Richardson and Leopold explained that all of the
Universal equipment is still in the room and peo
ple will soon find a comfortable routine. Leopold
admitted that, "It's hard to come up with a weight
room that's going to satisfy everyone."
"We're gonna do everything in our means to
add and organize," pledged Richardson. "As far as
the 'new look' is concerned, it's not just a coat of
paint and a few shiny bars. There's a sincere effort
to bring the facilities to an acceptable level."

ROOM FOR CHANCE — Even though the Encina Gym weight room has recently been rear
ranged to make the room more efficient, it and Roble Gym's facilities are still under tremen
dous pressure to serve the needs of the Stanford community.
Considering that any member of the Stanford
community — undergraduate students, graduate
students, faculty and staff — may use them, many
think the Encina Weight Room and Roble Gym's
two Universal weight training machines do not
adequately cater to a campus overflowing with
healthy and athletic-minded people.
Presently, the Encina Gym weight training cen
ter and Roble's two weight machines, one in each
locker room, are the only strength and condition
ing areas open to non-varsity athletes. According
to student Dan Labov, who trains regularly, "The
facilities really are not adequate. They've got es
sentially one decent weight room and during peak
hours, the waits and crowds are often outrageous.
Stanford desperately needs another, or at least a
more complete, training facility."
Tom Richardson, assistant strength coach at
Stanford, said the facilities are "not necessarily
lacking; let's say overused and undermanaged."
Richardson came to The Farm last January from
Southwest State University to relieve some of the
pressure from strength coach Steve Schulz, who
was "just bombarded with work." "What was re
quired was a management for the student sector,"
said Richardson.
One of the biggest complaints heard on campus
about the weight rooms is that they are "simply too
crowded," freshman Cyndie Benjamin said. A Palo
Alto Fire Marshall deemed Encina's capacity at 49
people, yet, according to Richardson, as many as
100 have been in there at one time. Considering
that Roble's facilities are really not adequate for a
complete workout or for crowds of more than 10,
and the best weight facility is for varsity athletes
only, the Encina Weight Room is under tremen
dous pressure to serve the bulk of the interested
Stanford community.
Richardson noted that, "When I got here, it (En
cina) was just harem-scarem and there was no one
to organize that particular facility." Since his ar
rival, Richardson has overseen a refurbishing and
reorganization at Encina designed to produce
maximum efficiency. Essentially what he did was
"reorganize the room and take out the machinery
that was dangerous and organize the room so it
would be most efficient for the free weight and
Universal users."
President of the Stanford Weightlifting Club
Don Leopold, a graduate student in the
Aero & Astro Dept. concurred that Encina's facil
ities are a lot more efficient. Although the restruc
turing has forced many athletes to change their
conditionir.g routines, Leopold sees this as a
positive effect. "I think the majority of the people
like it the way it is now," he said.
Richardson added that "with the new equip
ment and reorganization of the facility, we have all
the elements that are seen in the varsity weight
room, except rehabilitative machinery."
One of Richardson's roles is faculty adviser to
Leopold's weightlifting club. Leopold stressed that
the deterioration of the old facilities and the need

for new ones prompted the club's inception. "The
weight room at Encina was just one of the most
used facilities on campus and it was being neg
lected by the University. So a lot of us students got
together and with the help of Tom, we founded
the club." He added that the University has given
the Club full charge of the room.
Richardson said he volunteered his services as a
faculty representative because he thought it was
important to get some student input in the de
cisions concerning the weight facilities. He said he
hopes to see "student input really maximized as far
as purchase (of new equiment) and organization"
and that this can be accomplished "through the
Weightlifting Club."
Both Richardson and Leopold stressed that the
Club is not merely an organization where a bunch
of guys get together and lift. It's for "anyone who is
concerned with the condition of the room and
wants to have a say about what's going on," said
Leopold. Richardson said that it would be "more
like a service organization." Indeed it was the
members of the Club who instigated the eventual
changes at Encina earlier this month.
One of the goals of the Club is to improve the
safety m the weight rooms. Presently there are
people who are using machines incorrectly and
even working out barefoot. One thing that
Leopold said is being emphasized is educating the
supervisors and "making sure the machines and
weights are being used properly." Richardson
added that "the supervisors are now exclusively
members of the new Stanford Weightlifting Club,"
and thus should be informed about safety and
proper training techniques.
Yet the modified Encina facility does little to re
lieve the problem of overcrowdedness. Rich

ardson, however, is working to solve this situation.
"I have a plan for an expansion of the Roble Gym
facility and that will be for students only. My plan,"
he said, "is to make Roble a co-ed facility and add
some new equipment." The ultimate result would
be a "scaled-down version of Encina."
But the proposal is still in the planning stages. It's
"definitely on the back burner," said Richardson.
"It's a red tape thing and a planning-within-our
own-means type of project." Leopold, who strong
ly supports the plan, insistd, "We have to try to
keep the numbers down in Encina."
Robert Northcutt, a freshman, agreed with the
proposed plan. "They ought to consider fixing up
Roble. They've got some machines, but it's poorly
organized. And going to Encina is like a zoo."
The ultimate goal, according to Leopold, would
be to have "a couple of different weight rooms
around campus, to make it more convenient for
people to use and a whole lot safer." As club presi
dent, Leopold will be around campus this summer
and next year to follow through on the group's
plans. Richardson will also be back next year.
There are some criticisms to the recent mod
ifications. Some Encina-frequenters think that the
changes benefit the users of free weights. Yet both
Richardson and Leopold explained that all of the
Universal equipment is still in the room and peo
ple will soon find a comfortable routine. Leopold
admitted that, "It's hard to come up with a weight
room that's going to satisfy everyone."
"We're gonna do everything in our means to
add and organize," pledged Richardson. "As far as
