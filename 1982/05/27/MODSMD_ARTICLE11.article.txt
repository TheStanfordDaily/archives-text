## Viewpoint/John Merryman Mozart I chosen with care 
### 
I understand and sympathize with
the chagrin expressed by Prof. Tjeerd
van Andel and David Welsh (Daily,
May 24) concerning Kenneth
Snelson's Mozart I and other recently
installed works of outdoor sculpture.
Here are all these peculiar objects
mysteriously appearing on the cam
pus and changing the visual environ
ment. It is upsetting when familiar
things change. These sculptures
don't even look the way real
sculptures should look, and they
don't fade gracefully into the back
ground. Who chose them? By what
right did they impose their choices
on the rest of us? I will try to respond.
One reason the process may seem
mysterious is that the Daily, despite
well-meaning efforts to arouse in
terest, has not found the selection of
sculptors and sites or the process of
installation of sculptures (particularly
fascinating in the case of the Snelson)
worthy of its coverage. That lacuna
was partially filled for those who at
tended Snelson's public lecture fol
lowing the installation of Mozart I,
and there is a story and a photograph
in the current Campus Report.
These, however, came after the fact.
What went on before? A number of
things.

Van Andel dislikes
the Albers sculpture
and both he and
Welsh dislike the
Snelson.. .It is old
learning that the best
art is often the most
controversial.

First, two Stanford graduates,
JoAnne and Julian Ganz, made a sub
stantial gift to the University to com
mission and install a major work of
outdoor sculpture. Matching funds
were obtained from the National En
dowment for the Arts (NEA).

The choice of Snelson as the artist,
from among a group of leading
sculptors with records of producing
memorable outdoor works, was in
itially made by the University Panel
on Outdoor Art (composed of
Chemistry Prof. Carl Djerassi, Art
Profs. Albert Elsen, Kurt Forster and
Paul Turner, Vice-President for De
velopment Joel Smith, Director of
Planning Phil Williams and me, sup
plemented for the occasion by Henry
Hopkins, director of the San Francis
co Museum of Modern Art and
George Neubert, at that time curator
of art at the Oakland Museum, and
was approved by the donors and the
NEA. The choice of site was made by
the panel after consultation with the
artist (who visited Stanford to help
select the site and to become familiar
with it) and approved by the Univer
sity Committee on Land and Building
Development (UCLBD).
Snelson developed the concept of
Mozart I and prepared a model
which was reviewed and approved
by the panel and by UCLBD. The
sculptor had the parts fabricated and
shipped to Stanford and came here
to supervise its installation. That
process, which took place on May
9-12, was accomplished with the help
of a group of engineering students
and faculty (and, when the time came
for precise location of the assembled
sculpture, 30 or so spectators).
Cliff Morse of the University Facil
ities Office coordinated the entire
project, including the installation.
Roughly similar procedures pre
ceded the installation of the Hadzi
bronze at the Graduate School of
Business, the Albers sculpture to
which Van Andel refers, and the
Calder at the Law School, to mention
three other recent projects.
Van Andel dislikes the Albers
sculpture and both he and Welsh dis
like the Snelson. They are probably
not alone. It is old learning that the
best art is often the most con
troversial. Were there no negative
reaction one might, indeed, wonder
about these sculptures. Anything so

bland as to excite no negative reac
tion could not have much permanent
value. Perhaps, if they had attended
Snelson's lecture or talked with him
on the site during the installation of
Mozart I, they might have disliked it
less, perhaps not. I am certain'v

neither qualified nor inclined to try
to make them love Mozart I, al
though I think it is wonderful. So do
many of the people to whom I have
talked about it.
The more important point is this:
the procedures that led to selection
and approval of the sculptor, the
model and the site are serious, de
liberate procedures. The people who
served on the panel and on the
UCLBD and who work in the Univer
sity offices involved are serious peo
ple who care about excellence in the
visual environment at Stanford and
try hard to achieve it. Some of the
most eminent of them have spent
their professional lives looking at and
making judgments about works of
visual art; they are superbly qualified
professionals.
These people and these pro
cedures increase the probability (al
though nothing can guarantee the
certainty) that the outdoor sculpture
at Stanford will be comparable in ex
cellence to the teaching and scholar
ship of its faculty and the potential of
its students.

stantial gift to the University to com
mission and install a major work of
outdoor sculpture. Matching funds
were obtained from the National En
dowment for the Arts (NEA).

The choice of Snelson as the artist,
from among a group of leading
sculptors with records of producing
memorable outdoor works, was in
itially made by the University Panel
on Outdoor Art (composed of
Chemistry Prof. Carl Djerassi, Art
Profs. Albert Elsen, Kurt Forster and
Paul Turner, Vice-President for De
velopment Joel Smith, Director of
Planning Phil Williams and me, sup
plemented for the occasion by Henry
Hopkins, director of the San Francis
co Museum of Modern Art and
George Neubert, at that time curator
of art at the Oakland Museum, and
was approved by the donors and the
NEA. The choice of site was made by
the panel after consultation with the
artist (who visited Stanford to help
select the site and to become familiar
with it) and approved by the Univer
sity Committee on Land and Building
Development (UCLBD).
Snelson developed the concept of
Mozart I and prepared a model
which was reviewed and approved
by the panel and by UCLBD. The
sculptor had the parts fabricated and
shipped to Stanford and came here
to supervise its installation. That
process, which took place on May
9-12, was accomplished with the help
of a group of engineering students
and faculty (and, when the time came
for precise location of the assembled
sculpture, 30 or so spectators).
Cliff Morse of the University Facil
ities Office coordinated the entire
project, including the installation.
Roughly similar procedures pre
ceded the installation of the Hadzi
bronze at the Graduate School of
Business, the Albers sculpture to
which Van Andel refers, and the
Calder at the Law School, to mention
three other recent projects.
Van Andel dislikes the Albers
sculpture and both he and Welsh dis
like the Snelson. They are probably
not alone. It is old learning that the
best art is often the most con
troversial. Were there no negative
reaction one might, indeed, wonder
about these sculptures. Anything so

bland as to excite no negative reac
tion could not have much permanent
value. Perhaps, if they had attended
Snelson's lecture or talked with him
on the site during the installation of
Mozart I, they might have disliked it
less, perhaps not. I am certain'v

neither qualified nor inclined to try
to make them love Mozart I, al
though I think it is wonderful. So do
many of the people to whom I have
talked about it.
The more important point is this:
the procedures that led to selection
and approval of the sculptor, the
model and the site are serious, de
liberate procedures. The people who
served on the panel and on the
UCLBD and who work in the Univer
sity offices involved are serious peo
ple who care about excellence in the
visual environment at Stanford and
try hard to achieve it. Some of the
most eminent of them have spent
their professional lives looking at and
making judgments about works of
visual art; they are superbly qualified
professionals.
These people and these pro
cedures increase the probability (al
though nothing can guarantee the
certainty) that the outdoor sculpture
at Stanford will be comparable in ex
cellence to the teaching and scholar
ship of its faculty and the potential of
its students.

I understand and sympathize with
the chagrin expressed by Prof. Tjeerd
van Andel and David Welsh (Daily,
May 24) concerning Kenneth
Snelson's Mozart I and other recently
installed works of outdoor sculpture.
Here are all these peculiar objects
mysteriously appearing on the cam
pus and changing the visual environ
ment. It is upsetting when familiar
things change. These sculptures
don't even look the way real
sculptures should look, and they
don't fade gracefully into the back
ground. Who chose them? By what
right did they impose their choices
on the rest of us? I will try to respond.
One reason the process may seem
mysterious is that the Daily, despite
well-meaning efforts to arouse in
terest, has not found the selection of
sculptors and sites or the process of
installation of sculptures (particularly
fascinating in the case of the Snelson)
worthy of its coverage. That lacuna
was partially filled for those who at
tended Snelson's public lecture fol
lowing the installation of Mozart I,
and there is a story and a photograph
in the current Campus Report.
These, however, came after the fact.
What went on before? A number of
things.

Van Andel dislikes
the Albers sculpture
and both he and
Welsh dislike the

learning that the best
art is often the most
controversial.
