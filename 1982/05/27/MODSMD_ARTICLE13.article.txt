# The
						joke's on who, Mitchel?
## 
### 
Let me be blunt: I didn't write my column this week.
Perhaps it would be more correct to say that I couldn't
write my column this week. I guess it doesn't matter. The
net result is the same.
I really tried to write it. I did everything that I usually
do to get me in the proper frame of mind. I put on my
wet suit, sprinkled garlic on the typewriter, turned out all
the lights and hummed the theme song from Leave it to
Beaver. Still, nothing happened. 1 just couldn't do it.
I attribute my failure to three main factors. First, of
course, was the heat. On the night before my deadline,
the temperature was approximately 512 degrees fahren
heit in my room. I hate hot weather. I loathe and despise
it.
When it gets really hot, simple things like brushing my
teeth make me perspire profusely. I get really irritable
when it's hot. I usually go to a local grammar school and
pick fights with the third graders. I can't run when it's
hot. I can't sleep, and I can't write.

The second factor was your friend and mine, academic
pressure. I worked really hard last quarter, so I spent the
first eight weeks of this quarter giving myself a well
earned vacation. Unfortunately, this week, the pooh
pooh really hit the fan! I'm behind, gang. It's the fourth
quarter, I'm losing 48 to zip, and the other team has the
ball on my one-yard line.
Law school, a successful career, fame, fortune, a big
house and plenty of strawberry Pop-Tarts are all sudden
ly drifting out of reach. Do you expect me to let all of that
slip away just so I can write some stupid column? Get se
rious!
Finally, the clincher. The third, and probably the most
important reason why I didn't write a column this week:
I didn't want that ridiculous caricature of me to ever ap
pear in the Daily again. You see, every two weeks I've
had to spend the day putting up with the following:
"Hey, Mitchel. I read the Daily. Really funny!"
"My column?"
"No, your picture!"
Well, I guess I'll have the last laugh this time. I didn't
write a column, so they can't put the picture in. The
joke's on you, Stanford Daily. You won't have Steve
Mitchel to kick around anymore.
