## Identifying nuclear war means adopting a new and radical perspective, 
### 
In general, I am relentlessly optimistic about the long
range future of the human race. If given enough time,
there is no adaptibility problem that can't be solved by
patient, insightful people collaborating together. The
key factor here is, of course, having "enough time."
Time to learn through the process of trial and error; time
to recover from grave mistakes.
Having plenty of time is a luxury that is gradually being
diminished by today's pressing global crises, such as
over-population, food shortages and pollution.
Most of us would agree that none of these global crises
are more threatening to our individual and national se
curity than the nuclear arms race. In fact, it might even
be the most urgently important problem that has ever
been faced by any civilization. Even for terminal op
timists like myself, the arms race offers little hope. If left
unchecked it will inescapably evolve either by accident
or intention into a nuclear exchange between the super
powers — subsequently leading to the collapse of
Western civilization as we know it.
In addition, the production of each additional nuclear
warhead makes the problem that much more difficult to
fix. But as long as both sides continue to approach the
idea of disarmament in the conventional manner (that of
comparing strengths and weaknesses), the senseless
competition and insane escalation of surplus bombs will
persist indefinitely. "Mutually assured destruction" will
be the unintended result of what was originally a good

intention (bombs for peace and security).
The solution is probably too radically unconventional
to be effectively implemented by the current adminis
trations of either nation. In a nutshell, it involves a totally
unique way of thinking about international affairs. (For
ordinarily, the more extreme the nature of the problem,
equally extreme the nature of the corresponding solu
tion will be.) I will briefly outline some of the key ingre
dients of this urgently needed viewpoint.
First, and most easily accomplished, non-military
threats to each side's security must be recognized and
clearly defined as being more significant and critical than
military threats — which are usually self-contradictory
anyway.
Second, there must be a universal recognition of the
fact that a freeze, selective reductions, or even disarma
ment can no longer be "negotiated from strength," for
the nuclear arms build-up has surpassed the limits in
which such a strategy for negotiation applies. Each side is
capable of retaliatory strikes that could destroy the en
tire planet, let alone just one of its countries.
Thirdly, and foremost in this scheme, the way we cus
tomarily think of time, or, more specifically, the way we
think about the chronological sequence of events, must
undergo a dramatic transformation if nuclear armaged
don is to be avoided.
There exists a natural tendency for people to delay
their reactions to potential threats until something

drastic happens. The threat of nuclear war doesn't even
remotely apply to this way of thinking, for it is an all-or
none type of threat. Governments and selfish special in
terest groups are unable to adequately meet the
challenge precisely because it cannot be experienced;
and until it is directly "experienced" (in the same way in
flation or unemployment is experienced), nuclear war
will remain abstract, invisible, and extremely intangible.
There are no precedents from which to draw a com
parison. Hiroshima and Nagasaki come the closest, but
the scale was not large enough to be fully representative.
Nuclear war, then, cannot be conceptualized, and,
due to its intangibility, any claims about the intrinsic haz
ards of an uninterrupted nuclear arms race are essential
ly unverifiable and fall easy prey to refutation. According
to this logic, an ultimate paradox is created: nuclear war
will occur unless prevented, but it cannot be prevented
until it occurs. If the superpowers can ever come to un
derstand and accept this predicament for what it truly is,
recognizing that it is completely unique and requires a
completely unique means for settlement, they will then
be able to start making headway toward a long-term
solution.
Here is where the new way of thinking comes in. The
solution will necessarily involve a universal adoption of a
new perspective, a perspective that treats a future event
the same ay as all those "real" and impressionable his
toric events that guide our ideas and judgements. In oth

er words, nuclear war must not happen, but must be
treated as though it already has.
This is a special case where humankind is forced to
react to the unexperienced as though it were already ex
perienced in the most wholehearted and profoundly un
forgettable way. Furthermore, not only must.imagina
tion become as powerful as memory, but there also must
be an awareness of and compensation for the natural in
clination to underestimate the degree of damage that a
future event will actually inflict. For example, the secon
dary effects, such as radioactive water supplies, should
be taken into account when hypothesizing about the de
structive capacity of a single nuclear "device."
The prospect of my unconventional proposal being
executed is made even more dismal by the ultra-conser
vative (inflexible) majority which currently dominates
both the Soviet and U.S. governments.
The solution to the nuclear arms race requires as a pre
requisite a radically unique method of thinking, a meth
od that runs in diametrical opposition to that which is
used by those people who are concerned more with
maintaining the status quo than with imaginative
progress toward a genuinely safe international environ
ment.
History is littered with extinct civilizations that put a
higher premium on adaptation than on adaptibility. I
suppose ours is no different.

Time to learn through the process of trial and error; time
to recover from grave mistakes.
Having plenty of time is a luxury that is gradually being
diminished by today's pressing global crises, such as
over-population, food shortages and pollution.
Most of us would agree that none of these global crises
are more threatening to our individual and national se
curity than the nuclear arms race. In fact, it might even
be the most urgently important problem that has ever
been faced by any civilization. Even for terminal op
timists like myself, the arms race offers little hope. If left
unchecked it will inescapably evolve either by accident
or intention into a nuclear exchange between the super
powers — subsequently leading to the collapse of
Western civilization as we know it.
In addition, the production of each additional nuclear
warhead makes the problem that much more difficult to
fix. But as long as both sides continue to approach the
idea of disarmament in the conventional manner (that of
comparing strengths and weaknesses), the senseless
competition and insane escalation of surplus bombs will
persist indefinitely. "Mutually assured destruction" will
be the unintended result of what was originally a good

intention (bombs for peace and security).
The solution is probably too radically unconventional
to be effectively implemented by the current adminis
trations of either nation. In a nutshell, it involves a totally
unique way of thinking about international affairs. (For
ordinarily, the more extreme the nature of the problem,
equally extreme the nature of the corresponding solu
tion will be.) I will briefly outline some of the key ingre
dients of this urgently needed viewpoint.
First, and most easily accomplished, non-military
threats to each side's security must be recognized and
clearly defined as being more significant and critical than
military threats — which are usually self-contradictory
anyway.
Second, there must be a universal recognition of the
fact that a freeze, selective reductions, or even disarma
ment can no longer be "negotiated from strength," for
the nuclear arms build-up has surpassed the limits in
which such a strategy for negotiation applies. Each side is
capable of retaliatory strikes that could destroy the en
tire planet, let alone just one of its countries.
Thirdly, and foremost in this scheme, the way we cus
tomarily think of time, or, more specifically, the way we
think about the chronological sequence of events, must
undergo a dramatic transformation if nuclear armaged
don is to be avoided.
There exists a natural tendency for people to delay
their reactions to potential threats until something

drastic happens. The threat of nuclear war doesn't even
remotely apply to this way of thinking, for it is an all-or
none type of threat. Governments and selfish special in
terest groups are unable to adequately meet the
challenge precisely because it cannot be experienced;
and until it is directly "experienced" (in the same way in
flation or unemployment is experienced), nuclear war
will remain abstract, invisible, and extremely intangible.
There are no precedents from which to draw a com
parison. Hiroshima and Nagasaki come the closest, but
the scale was not large enough to be fully representative.
Nuclear war, then, cannot be conceptualized, and,
due to its intangibility, any claims about the intrinsic haz
ards of an uninterrupted nuclear arms race are essential
ly unverifiable and fall easy prey to refutation. According
to this logic, an ultimate paradox is created: nuclear war
will occur unless prevented, but it cannot be prevented
until it occurs. If the superpowers can ever come to un
derstand and accept this predicament for what it truly is,
recognizing that it is completely unique and requires a
completely unique means for settlement, they will then
be able to start making headway toward a long-term
solution.
Here is where the new way of thinking comes in. The
solution will necessarily involve a universal adoption of a
new perspective, a perspective that treats a future event
the same ay as all those "real" and impressionable his
toric events that guide our ideas and judgements. In oth

er words, nuclear war must not happen, but must be
treated as though it already has.
This is a special case where humankind is forced to
react to the unexperienced as though it were already ex
perienced in the most wholehearted and profoundly un
forgettable way. Furthermore, not only must.imagina
tion become as powerful as memory, but there also must
be an awareness of and compensation for the natural in
clination to underestimate the degree of damage that a
future event will actually inflict. For example, the secon
dary effects, such as radioactive water supplies, should
be taken into account when hypothesizing about the de
structive capacity of a single nuclear "device."
The prospect of my unconventional proposal being
executed is made even more dismal by the ultra-conser
vative (inflexible) majority which currently dominates
both the Soviet and U.S. governments.
The solution to the nuclear arms race requires as a pre
requisite a radically unique method of thinking, a meth
od that runs in diametrical opposition to that which is
used by those people who are concerned more with
maintaining the status quo than with imaginative
progress toward a genuinely safe international environ
ment.
History is littered with extinct civilizations that put a
higher premium on adaptation than on adaptibility. I
suppose ours is no different.

In general, I am relentlessly optimistic about the long
range future of the human race. If given enough time,
there is no adaptibility problem that can't be solved by
patient, insightful people collaborating together. The
