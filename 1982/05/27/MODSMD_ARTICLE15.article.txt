## Panic and simplistic reasoning distort nuclear power issue 
### 
Steve Borish in his column (Daily,
May 18) argues against my statements
(Daily, May 11) that nuclear power is
cheap, safe, reliable and environ
mentally benign. In doing so, he
raises specters based on precisely the
sorts of grossly exaggerated or im
aginary dangers that I commented
on.
Example: His claim that transporta
tion of spent reactor fuel will convert
interstate highways into "waste cor
ridors (with) a constant possibility of
catastrophic accidents (or) sabotage
or theft." In fact, such transportation

will do nothing more than contribute
to occasional traffic jams.
Possibly there will be more acci
dents. These will be considerably less
catastrophic than accidents involving
trucks carrying chemicals or gaso
line. The casks used for spent fuel
shipment are made of lead and steel
and weigh about 25 tons each. In tests
at Sandia National Laboratories, a
cask of this type containing spent fuel
was deliberately blown up by a high
explosive charge. There was so little
radioactive debris or aerosol re
leased that the investigators calcu
lated that even if such an event were

to occur on a street corner in Man
hattan, no early fatalaties or illnesses
due to radiation would result and
there would be at most one delayed
cancer fatality (Report SAND
81-2147, "A Safety Assessment of
Spent Fuel Transportation through
Urban Regions").
Example: "When Dr. Rosalie
Bertell visited workers at *he
plutonium-processing plant in Erwin,
Tenn., she found that 100 out (of) 100
workers had (visible) blood in their
urine" (Borish, Daily, May 18). It is
not mentioned that Bertell, an anti
nuclear activist, is not a physician,
that she did not come to this finding
by examination of the workers' urine
or of medical records, but was told by
them that they had it, and that at the
time of her visit the workers were in
the middle of a bitter labor dispute
and were on strike. These facts are all
in his source, "Nuclear Witnesses."
No independent investigator has
confirmed Bertell's allegations, and
they are not supported by the em
ployees' medical histories or known
intakes of radioactive materials. The
story is nonsense, to put it mildly, and
I am dismayed that it was so un
critically accepted by Borish and
passed on to his readers without even
the qualifications noted above.
Nuclear power is cheap, despite
the high capital (construction) costs
noted by Borish, since what counts is
the ultimate cost per kilowatt-hour
to the consumer, and here nuclear is
usually cheaper than any other large

scale source except hydro-electrici
ty-
Nuclear power is reliable, since
nuclear plants, once on line, gener
ate electricity as dependably as other
comparable types of plants, and are
not nearly as vulnerable to fuel supp
ly interruptions such as protracted
coal strikes or oil embargoes.
Nuclear power is safe, since in
more than 20 years of commercial
operation all over the world no in
juries and no deaths in the general
public attributable to it have yet oc
curred, and few or none are likely to
occur in the future. All competent
risk analyses confirm this prediction.
Nuclear power is environmentally
benign, since there are no emissions
of noxious pollutants, fewer
emissions even of radioactive sub
stances than from coal burning
plants, and no contribution to the
carbon-dioxide "greenhouse" effect
or to acid rain. Whatever other dele
terious environmental effects may
exist in the nuclear cycle are easy to
avoid or correct, with no significant
penalty to the cost of t.." electricity.
We should think carefully before
rejecting nuclear power because of
panic based on doomsday predic
tions. There may be good reasons for
not building nuclear plants, but the
simplistic ones advanced by many
anti-nuclear militants are not among
them.
