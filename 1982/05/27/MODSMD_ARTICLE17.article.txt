## Plowing through life on the Farm Commentary/Don Caughey Transcend comfort for worthy harvest 
### 
In the beginning, Stanford was to
provide education for those who
would be excluded from other uni
versities by economic and geograph
ic factors. As time passed, Stanford
has evolved into an elite institution,
taking its cue from the Ivy League,
and measuring its excellence in those
terms. A celebrity-studded faculty,
departments ranked number one on
the basis of salaries paid to graduates
and an uncanny ability to attract gov
ernment money have made Stanford
successful in hard institutional terms
as well as in the more diffuse images
of academic excellence. A Stanford
degree has great market power; how
much quality it reflects is another

matter.
I am a Stanford graduate C 64) who
returned to work here after 15 years.
There were new buildings and a his
tory of protest and reaction between
these periods of residence. But what
strikes me is how constant the culture
of the Farm has been. What is amaz
ing is not that the student-based pro
tests of the '60s were deflected and
tamed, but that they took root at all.
Nor should I ignore the gains made in
student representation on the Board
of Trustees and some other areas.
Progress comes in small steps. But my
point is that it is easy for Stanford to
be above and apart from the messy
"real world."

The image of a country club is all
too immediate. Let's even suppose
that it is a liberal and caring club
which has moved away from dis
criminatory practices and attempts to
have a socially responsible communi
ty service program. The club still
lacks a fundamental connection to
the communities of need and does
not take responsibility for its connec
tions to the communities of wealth
and power. It's a long way to El
Camino and longer still to cross the
Bayshore. East San Jose, Oakland and
San Francisco are remote. We can
take them on our own terms or ig
nore them with apparent impunity.
As with the self-selection process
by which a club gains a sense of "us,"
there is a certain self-congratulatory
payoff in being part of Stanford.
What racial, ethnic and cultural di
versity exists here is often like that
seen in Up With People and other
nostalgic images of the Melting Pot.
Isn't it nice to know that non-WASP s
can be smart, hip and at ease with
power, tool The reason we have to
work hard at celebrating diversity
and questioning the way money and
the inertia of institutional interest
shapes our lives is that it is so easy at
Stanford to live in the myth of our
reputation.
There is nothing moral in avoiding
power or seeking martyrdom; and
Stanford graduates need not be
ashamed that there are advantages to
having gone here in the real world.
Contra Edwin Meese: from those to
whom much has been given will
much be required. There are op
portunities for Stanford grads which
are unavailable to the graduates of
East Overshoe State. We needn't per
petuate that discrimination, but we
needn't ignore the opportunities
either.
What I find lacking here is any
sense of fundamental purpose in the
institution or in human images of
success which form our campus cul

ture. Instead, we let the Department
of Defense budget determine our ac
ademic priorities and are satisfied
with undergraduate education and
living programs which basically
flatter rather than disturb students.
Lacking that self-critical and ethical
ly-sensitive drive, we let ourselves
believe what is convenient rather
than what is true. We don't feel im
pelled to deal with the tough ques
tions or to go against the stream.
These are generalizations to which
there are many exceptions and which
apply to many other institutions

which are like Stanford. I would not
be here if I felt there was insufficient
value in this campus to make my
work worth my time. There are good
reasons for others to be here too, but
there is no good reason to let institu
tional inertia and insularity dictate
"life on the Farm." The world needs
and deserves more than that from us,
and we need it too. It is time to re
think what excellence would require
of us if we were to take responsibility
for our power and wealth and recog
nize the truth in the claims of justice
and the demands of love.

as well as in the more diffuse images
of academic excellence. A Stanford
degree has great market power; how
much quality it reflects is another

matter.
I am a Stanford graduate C 64) who
returned to work here after 15 years.
There were new buildings and a his
tory of protest and reaction between
these periods of residence. But what
strikes me is how constant the culture
of the Farm has been. What is amaz
ing is not that the student-based pro
tests of the '60s were deflected and
tamed, but that they took root at all.
Nor should I ignore the gains made in
student representation on the Board
of Trustees and some other areas.
Progress comes in small steps. But my
point is that it is easy for Stanford to
be above and apart from the messy
"real world."

The image of a country club is all
too immediate. Let's even suppose
that it is a liberal and caring club
which has moved away from dis
criminatory practices and attempts to
have a socially responsible communi
ty service program. The club still
lacks a fundamental connection to
the communities of need and does
not take responsibility for its connec
tions to the communities of wealth
and power. It's a long way to El
Camino and longer still to cross the
Bayshore. East San Jose, Oakland and
San Francisco are remote. We can
take them on our own terms or ig
nore them with apparent impunity.
As with the self-selection process
by which a club gains a sense of "us,"
there is a certain self-congratulatory
payoff in being part of Stanford.
What racial, ethnic and cultural di
versity exists here is often like that
seen in Up With People and other
nostalgic images of the Melting Pot.
Isn't it nice to know that non-WASP s
can be smart, hip and at ease with
power, tool The reason we have to
work hard at celebrating diversity
and questioning the way money and
the inertia of institutional interest
shapes our lives is that it is so easy at
Stanford to live in the myth of our
reputation.
There is nothing moral in avoiding
power or seeking martyrdom; and
Stanford graduates need not be
ashamed that there are advantages to
having gone here in the real world.
Contra Edwin Meese: from those to
whom much has been given will
much be required. There are op
portunities for Stanford grads which
are unavailable to the graduates of
East Overshoe State. We needn't per
petuate that discrimination, but we
needn't ignore the opportunities
either.
What I find lacking here is any
sense of fundamental purpose in the
institution or in human images of
success which form our campus cul

ture. Instead, we let the Department
of Defense budget determine our ac
ademic priorities and are satisfied
with undergraduate education and
living programs which basically
flatter rather than disturb students.
Lacking that self-critical and ethical
ly-sensitive drive, we let ourselves
believe what is convenient rather
than what is true. We don't feel im
pelled to deal with the tough ques
tions or to go against the stream.
These are generalizations to which
there are many exceptions and which
apply to many other institutions

I find lacking... any
sense of fundamental
purpose in the
institution or in
human images of
success which form
our campus culture.
Instead, we let the

determine our
academic priorities.

which are like Stanford. I would not
be here if I felt there was insufficient
value in this campus to make my
work worth my time. There are good
reasons for others to be here too, but
there is no good reason to let institu
tional inertia and insularity dictate
"life on the Farm." The world needs
and deserves more than that from us,
and we need it too. It is time to re
think what excellence would require
of us if we were to take responsibility
for our power and wealth and recog
nize the truth in the claims of justice
and the demands of love.
