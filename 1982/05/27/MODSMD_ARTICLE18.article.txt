# Commentary/Kevin Jones
## In search of a niche in the 'real world' 
### 
"Mr. Jones," the man at the Career
Evaluation and Guidance Center said
to my father, "we'd be more than
willing to give you your money
back."
"You mean that — "
"Yes, despite retesting, your son
Kevin just does not fit anywhere in
our most recent Occupation Avail
ability Matrix." He handed my father
a folder of test scores, charts and
graphs.
"But it says here that he is highly in
telligent, well educated, and in
terviews well," my father pleaded.

"No need to be so
glum, Mr. tones.
Becoming an
expatriate is just what
(your son) Kevin
needs, it's what he's
cut out tor."
My oldest boy, the
doctor, makes
$300J)00 a year and
the only time I see
him working is when
his accountant is sick.

"Look a bit further, if you would,
Mr. Jones. Under the heading of De
mostrated Aptitudes/Natl. Age
Group Ranking, you may clearly see
that, both in terms of absolute score
and percentile rank, your son is most
qualified to be "An Adventurer." His
raw score is four times that of a nor
mal 22-year-old, and twice as great
and even the most Han Solo-like 10-
year-old."
"That wasn't exactly what I had in
mind."
"A major problem is that his physi
ology is such that he needs 10 to 12
hours of sleep a day. Also, he has a
strong psychological antipathy for a
regular, day to day position. To be
quite frank, sir, there just aren't many
jobs available with 20-hour, flexible

work weeks."
"But my oldest boy, the doctor,
makes $300,000 a year and the only
time I see him working is when his ac
countant is sick." My father beganr to
get angry. "And what about my son,
the banker. God knows that he hates
to do anything but play tennis, and
you got him a job — "
"It's not that Kevin hates to work,
Mr. jones. We have placed many tal
ented people in jobs which allow
them to pursue absolutely nothing.
And they've been very successful."
"Well, what's the trouble then?"
"I think you had better sit down,
first. This will probably come as quite
a shock to you. Let me say that our
top analysts have been working on
Kevin's case, and that this report is
the most comprehensive we've ever
compiled."
He handed my father another
folder.
"We doubted our information at
first," he continued, taking a
cigarette and lighting it with a trem
bling hand. "So we tested and re
tested. But, despite what seemed in
surmountable inconsistencies, we
have come up with a single, thor
ough, comprehensive study."
He began to pace as my father
flipped through the report.
"This can't be!" my father
screamed in outrage.
"It's true, Mr. Jones. Believe me,
we rechecked." He poured two
whiskeys and handed both of them
to my father. "Your son shows un
deniable signs of latent artistic ten
dencies."
"It even sounds worse than it looks
on paper." My father was a broken
man. "But the only painting he ever
did was a magic-marker mural. On
the dining room wall. When he was
three."
"And you reprimanded him se
verely, I'll wager."
"You better believe it."
"Don't you see, his real talent was
literally forced into submission, and
at such an early age."
"Baloney! His mother, er, rather, I
made him take piano lessons when

he was eight. And he was genuinely
awful,)f I do say so myself."
"His records show that he only
took lessons for two weeks. That's
hardly long enough — "
"He had to quit because he broke
his hands."
"His hands, Mr. Jones?"
"Well, yes. You see I bought him
this punching bag. I guess that it was a
little too hard."
"Mr. Jones, I am shocked. How do
you expect a child to develop proper
ly with you ambushing his creativity
at every turn?"
"I was just trying to help."
"Well, Mr. Jones, I believe you.
Otherwise you wouldn't be here. I'm
afraid that your devotion shall be se
verely tested, however."
My father sat up, attentive. "What
do you mean?"
"If you'll look at the last page of
our report, under 'Recommended
Field.'"
My father paled, the folder drop
ping from his.hand. "Is that it? Noth

ingelse?"
"No need to be so glum, Mr. Jones.
Becoming an Expatriate is just what
Kevin needs, it's what he's cut out
for."
My father sunk deeper into the
chair.
"Come now," the counselor con
tinued, "this way he can travel to ex
citing lands, fight for Good Causes,
meet interesting people, and ex
ercise his creativity by writing
fascinating stories. That's not so ter
rible, is it?"
"No, I guess not," my father said,
preparing to leave. " 'Expatriate.' It
does have a perversely romantic ring
to it."
"I'd be proud to have a son like
Kevin, Mr. Jones."
"Oh, I am," my father mumbled on
his way out, "it's just that I don't think
I can be of much help to him. None
of my old college buddies went on to
become expatriates, I'm afraid."
