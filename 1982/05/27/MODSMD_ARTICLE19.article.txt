## Broader lens brings fuzzy studies into focus 
### 
As the dawn lights up the sky outside this Term
an window, I realize I've just crunched numbers all
night with real engineers. Is this how the employ
able elite actually get there?
At 7:30 I cried, "You wimp" softly to myself and
watched the display panel fade on my unprogram
mable antique Casio calculator.
As a veteran fuzzy-to-fading-out senior liberal
arts major, (communications, alas, alack), I'm
besieged by the nasty (are they jealous?) remarks
of my more practically oriented friends who mis
take my lack of problem sets and exams for some
sort of Disneyland "E" ride here on the Farm.
In fact, it takes me four to eight hours to prepare
and write a thorough news story (I knew you
wouldn't believe it.) It has taken several years for
me to get a clue on the labyrinth of amazing ser
vices (granted, data banks are the state of the art in
research,) and relevant tomes in Green, Hoover,
and Food Research (even in Terman and Mitchell)
libraries that legitimate the fuzzier work I do.
Actually, having non-fuzzy friends has been the
best part about Stanford — not that they can

articulate well or be amusing or be integral to re
search in revelry; that's a myth I have too much fun
with to dispel. I've found my journalistic comrades
get as much of a kick out of knowing nerds with
flair as I do.
Having surfaced from the trenches between
Storke and Terman unscathed, I've even enrolled
in one of their classes — okay, I'll admit I'm a
rookie at cash flow and a ringer for marketing re
search and interviewing. But it's fun. It's worth the
social castration just to be able to meet some of the
professbr? and graduate students in another de
partment.
Because many of these non-fuzzy people are
foreign, meeting them can equal the overseas ex
perience as the ultimate answer to broadening ac
ademic horizons. There's opportunity to meet and
cope with another culture right here on the Farm.
Stanford draws some of the brightest, most in
teresting (and most hilarious) international folk in
the world.
Part of getting to know them is understanding
why they came here and how they feel about the

country — the home — they may or may not return
to. Talking with people about politics and life, (or
the lack thereof) in France, Brazil, South Africa, Is
rael or Lebanon can be more edifying and some
times sobering than any formal lecture or news
paper article.
So why do I bust up at foreign humor? I think it
has something to do with the laughter and smiles
— they don't change much from face to face. Take
for example, the non-translatable joke about the
man who sits "on" a cafe and burps chairsl In Ara
bic, the idiom for ... well, unless you heard the
one about "Go and tile the sea" instead of "Take a
long walk off of a short pier," I'll call it quits.
The point is that the extra time it takes to pursue
courses in other departments, to get to know for
eign students and to explore Stanford's resources
comes back to you in ways that you don't antici
pate. You might be able to increase your cash flow,
pick up an accent and some new expletivesl Life
on the farm can be telescopic. The people make
the difference.
