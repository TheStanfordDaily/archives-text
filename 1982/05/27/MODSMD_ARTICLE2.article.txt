# Professors comment on Falklands war

### Ray Newman 
The Reagan administration may have sent signals
to Argentina that were interpreted by the Argen
tines as an OK to invade the Falkland Islands, his
tory and political science professors here
hypothesized this week.
Robert Packenham, a professor of political sci
ence, said that the Reagan administration's policy
toward Argentina before the crisis broke out
"might have given the signal that they (the Argen
tines) might get by with it (the seizure of the
Falklands)."
However, some, like History Prof. Richard
Morse, stressed that they thought the "real rea
son" for the Argentine attack on the Falklands was
that "the junta was facing such severe problems at
home that they needed an issue." Morse shared
the belief that these internal factors and not the
suggested Reagan administration signals, were the
major factors in the Argentines' decision to seize
the islands.
It remains speculation whether the Argentines
perceived the United States as willing to allow
Falklands attack, several professors said.
Packenham said that the biggest criticism he
would make in evaluating the administration's role
in precipitating the crisis "was the original prob
lem" of possibly giving the Argentines "the signal
that they could go ahead and do it."
John Wirth, professor of history and director of
the Center for Latin American Studies, pointed to
"the events leading up to the crisis" as examples of
where the Reagan administration performed poor
ly-
Wirth said that the United States encouraged Ar
gentina to play a larger military role in Central
America, and that, together with the warmer U.S.-
Argentina relations since Ronald Reagan became

president, the encouragement may have "stirred
up" the Argentines' ability to act aggressively.
Wirth said that the Reagan administration "sort
of encouraged them (the Argentines) to play a big
role in Central America, sort of built them up."
Likewise, Morse noted that the encouragement
Argentina received from the United States to be
more active in Central America was a possible fac
tor in the Argentine decision to seize the islands.
"It's a hypothesis," he said, that the two are con-
The Falkland Islands

nected.
"Apparently it seems fairly well agreed that they
(the Argentines) were going to .. . train troops or
use their own forces to go up and act as our
mercenaries in Salvador," Morse said.
Morse said that it "may have been a surprise to
the Argentines that we came down so hard on the
side of England" when negotiations ceased.
The future of Argentina's government is uncer
tain, the professors agreed.
Wirth, noting that "the British clearly have the
upper hand" and that the battle may be decided

within a matter of days, said that how Britain acts in
victory may determine whether the present Ar
gentine government survives.
"The question is, I guess, how far they want to
push it, if they want to humiliate the Argentines."
He added that public opinion might force British
Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher to push for such
a defeat.
Packenham, saying that it was orobable but "by
no means clear" that the British will win the fight
ing, called the collapse of the Argentine govern
ment "probable" in the case of a defeat.
Like the fate of the Argentine government, how
the United States will fare in terms of Latin Ameri
can relations is in doubt.
Wirth said that what he called the "marked in
capacity" of the United States to contain the crisis
would hurt America more that the alliance with
Britain. He said that while the United States enjoys
"tremendous respect" in much of Latin America,
the United States will suffer from the "perceived
lack of ability to control the crisis."
Morse said that the United States would suffer in
terms of "general popular opinion." He related
the story of a Stanford graduate who left Argentina
because of the Falklands crisis. At the border, the
guard saw the graduate's passport and told the
graduate "we should kill you all."
Packenham said that the crisis "may well come
to be viewed as a watershed" in relations between
the United States and Latin America and between
richer, industrialized countries and poorer coun
tries.
Packenham said that the Latin American coun
tries "are all lining up together, even though
they're all different ideologies." The reason for
that new alignment, he said, was that "they are all
South and all Latin."
