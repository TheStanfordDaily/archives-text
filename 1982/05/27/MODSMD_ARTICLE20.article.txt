## Dual-purpose classrooms could solve housing problems 
### 
In reference to the housing situ
ation here, President Donald Ken
nedy was recently quoted in Campus
Report as saying "a good deal more
discussion and study is needed
before we can be confident that all of
the feasible alternatives have been
considered," and that "to get the
number ultimately required in prox
imity to services suggests a more per
ipheral location."
Well, the solution is just outside his
door — the Quad. Yes, the Quad —
use the classrooms and offices of the
Quad and the surrounding academic
buildings for student housing, espe
cially for graduate students.
Most classrooms and offices are va
cant between 5 p.m. and 8 a.m. Rath
er than remaining idle, these facilities
could serve a dual function and
double as rooms for students at
night. During the day, of course, stu
dents would have to find other places
to be. Just allow each student a living
space in the classroom that could be
used by the student at night and then
closed up in the morning.
Since most of the buildings in the
Quad have restrooms, the only addi
tional facilities needed are shower
units in a few of the bathrooms. Even
this would not be necessary if stu
dents used the showers in Roble gym
or other living units. Surely some stu
dents could design a functional living
arrangement that could be easily
opened at night and then closed off
in the morning for classes.
For very little Investment, the uni
versity could realize a sizable in
crease in rental income, and the
rooms couldn't be any worse than

the concrete boxes of Wilbur and
Stern. The number of vacant
classrooms should be enough to han
dle all students who want to live on
campus.
Having lived in such diverse places
on campus as the Wilbur basement,
the bathtubs of Roble, and the hills
next to the Dish, I feel the Quad com
pares favorably with these. By using
existing structures, there would be
no need for new construction, and
atrocities such as the decimation of
the eucalyptus trees on Governor's
Lane for the new campus housing
near the lake would not be neces
sary.

As one who runs several days per
week I would like to comment on a
readily observable sign of environ
mental impact made by jog
gers/runners on the Stanford cam
pus. I think runners can learn from
Native American ideas of respect for
Mother Earth and the fellow sentient
beings who share it with us.
At this time of year the young Cali
fornia toads have finished the water
based stage of their life-cycles and
are hopping about by the hundreds
along the edges of Lake Lagunita.
Also there is the garter snake and the
occasional (but rare) rattlesnake. It is
distressing to see hundreds of
squashed toadlet bodies, and at least
one smashed garter snake, so mind
lessly crushed beneath joggers' feet.

There are ways of maintaining
one's health not at the expense of
other sentient beings. This can be ac
complished by shifting one's running
route elsewhere, away from ponds
and such at this time of year, or at
least running with more care and
awareness.
I nearly stepped on a rattler several
weeks ago near the Dish so aware
ness is not only kind but possibly pre
ventive of more serious problems.
One should also keep in mind that
the Giant Jogging Toad remembers
those who crush his kin, so beware
the shadow of giant webbed feet!

Ban bike riding
After being smashed into by a bi
cycle for the third time this quarter, I
have decided it is time the University
seriously consider banning bike rid
ing on central campus between class
periods. First of all, if students can't
make it to a class in 10 minutes, then
we need the exercise anyway.
Bike accidents also frequently in
jure pedestrians. Now that ain't fair.
It wouldn't be so bad if you only saw
bikers riding when they should be
walking (like between class periods),
but half the time they ride like idiots
at that.
The famous "Let's not let a few bad
apples ruin everyone's fun" attitude
is not a good defense. There needs to
be a serious initiative of some sort re
garding this problem so that ev
eryone will wake up and ride more

responsibly. We all give lip-service to
bike safety, but, like drunk driving,
blame it on the other guy.
Bike lanes and better manners are
a good start toward improving the sit
uation, but ultimately it depends on
individual attitude. It is a serious
problem. Just ask the last bike acci
dent victim — he'll tell you all about
it.

Using water resources
1 I deeply resent the way the lake is
losing water. I've been here for three
years and every year, come the end
of May, the lake turns into a big bowl
of slime. It's really sick.
We should do something about
this. Let's have some pride. This is our
watering hole. It's where we go for
walks at 11 p.m. It's where
we catch rays on a hot Saturday after
noon.
The solution is quite simple. In fact,
all you have to do is open your mouth
wide and look in a mirror to find it.
It's our saliva.
I suggest that we all expectorate
into the lake to keep it full of water.
They could make Lake-spitting a 3
unit class that fulfils the humanities
requirement. So there it is. We've
solved the problem.
More importantly we have given
students a cause other than getting
grades to send us on our way to the
road to success. I think we could all
use a cause.

Also there is the garter snake and the

distressing to see hundreds of
squashed toadlet bodies, and at least
one smashed garter snake, so mind

There are ways of maintaining
one's health not at the expense of
other sentient beings. This can be ac

route elsewhere, away from ponds
and such at this time of year, or at

awareness.
I nearly stepped on a rattler several
weeks ago near the Dish so aware

One should also keep in mind that
the Giant Jogging Toad remembers
those who crush his kin, so beware
the shadow of giant webbed feet!

Ban bike riding
After being smashed into by a bi
cycle for the third time this quarter, I
have decided it is time the University
seriously consider banning bike rid
ing on central campus between class
periods. First of all, if students can't
make it to a class in 10 minutes, then
we need the exercise anyway.
Bike accidents also frequently in
jure pedestrians. Now that ain't fair.
It wouldn't be so bad if you only saw
bikers riding when they should be
walking (like between class periods),
but half the time they ride like idiots
at that.
The famous "Let's not let a few bad
apples ruin everyone's fun" attitude
is not a good defense. There needs to
be a serious initiative of some sort re
garding this problem so that ev
eryone will wake up and ride more

responsibly. We all give lip-service to
bike safety, but, like drunk driving,
blame it on the other guy.
Bike lanes and better manners are
a good start toward improving the sit
uation, but ultimately it depends on
individual attitude. It is a serious
problem. Just ask the last bike acci
dent victim — he'll tell you all about
it.

Using water resources
1 I deeply resent the way the lake is
losing water. I've been here for three
years and every year, come the end
of May, the lake turns into a big bowl
of slime. It's really sick.
We should do something about
this. Let's have some pride. This is our
watering hole. It's where we go for
walks at 11 p.m. It's where
we catch rays on a hot Saturday after
noon.
The solution is quite simple. In fact,
all you have to do is open your mouth
wide and look in a mirror to find it.
It's our saliva.
I suggest that we all expectorate
into the lake to keep it full of water.
They could make Lake-spitting a 3
unit class that fulfils the humanities
requirement. So there it is. We've
solved the problem.
More importantly we have given
students a cause other than getting
grades to send us on our way to the
road to success. I think we could all
use a cause.

In reference to the housing situ
ation here, President Donald Ken
nedy was recently quoted in Campus
Report as saying "a good deal more
discussion and study is needed
before we can be confident that all of
the feasible alternatives have been
considered," and that "to get the
number ultimately required in prox
imity to services suggests a more per
ipheral location."
Well, the solution is just outside his
door — the Quad. Yes, the Quad —
use the classrooms and offices of the
Quad and the surrounding academic
buildings for student housing, espe
cially for graduate students.
Most classrooms and offices are va
cant between 5 p.m. and 8 a.m. Rath
er than remaining idle, these facilities
could serve a dual function and
double as rooms for students at
night. During the day, of course, stu
dents would have to find other places
to be. Just allow each student a living
space in the classroom that could be
used by the student at night and then
closed up in the morning.
Since most of the buildings in the
Quad have restrooms, the only addi
tional facilities needed are shower
units in a few of the bathrooms. Even
this would not be necessary if stu
dents used the showers in Roble gym
or other living units. Surely some stu
dents could design a functional living
arrangement that could be easily
opened at night and then closed off
in the morning for classes.
For very little Investment, the uni
versity could realize a sizable in
crease in rental income, and the
rooms couldn't be any worse than

the concrete boxes of Wilbur and
Stern. The number of vacant
classrooms should be enough to han
dle all students who want to live on
campus.
Having lived in such diverse places
on campus as the Wilbur basement,
the bathtubs of Roble, and the hills
next to the Dish, I feel the Quad com
pares favorably with these. By using
existing structures, there would be
no need for new construction, and
atrocities such as the decimation of
the eucalyptus trees on Governor's
Lane for the new campus housing
near the lake would not be neces
sary.

Watch for toads!
As one who runs several days per
week I would like to comment on a
readily observable sign of environ
mental impact made by jog
gers/runners on the Stanford cam
pus. I think runners can learn from
Native American ideas of respect for
Mother Earth and the fellow sentient
beings who share it with us.
At this time of year the young Cali

are hopping about by the hundreds
