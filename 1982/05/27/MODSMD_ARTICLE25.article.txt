A two-under par 71, morning
playing conditions and a hole in
one helped Stanford's women's
golf team gain second place yes
terday in the first round of the
NCAA women's golf cham
pionships here.
The Cardinal totaled 297 as a
team, three strokes behind first
place Tulsa. The four-day tour
nament featuring 19 teams and 17
individual players continues to

day, with the Stanford linksters
starting at the 10th tee at noon.
"We are really proud," said
Stanford coach Tim Baldwin. "The
girls have worked very hard all
year to be in the hunt."
"I don't look for them to falter,"
Baldwin said.
Lori Castillo's 71 tied her for the
individual lead with Kelly Skalicky
from Louisiana State. The Card
senior shot birdies on the fourth,
eighth, 12th and 16th hole.

Skalicky, who was heavily re
cruited by Stanford women's
basketball coach Dottie McCrea,
had five birds against three bogies
while playing in the same three
some as Castillo.
Diane Nixon's hole in one on
the par three, 160-yard third hole
gave her a two-under score of 34
on the front nine. The Card
freshman added a back nine 41 to
give her a 75 first round tally.
"I hit a pretty solid (four-iron)

shot and it bounced a little left and
started rolling towards the hole,"
Nixon explained. "It hung on the
lip and just dropped in."

Teammate Joanne Pacillo fired a
pair of 37s for a 74, .vhile Debbie
Barberio checked in at 77. Kathy
Nino had an 80.
Afternoon winds dried out and
hardened the Stanford course,
wreaking havoc on afternoon
players' short games. In fact, the
11th green became so hard and

slick that it was a small miracle to
keep the ball from rolling off it.
"The teams that played in the
morning definitely had an advan
tage. In the afternoon, the Stan
ford course just gets wicked,"
Baldwin commented.
Baldwin was anything but sur
prised with Tulsa's first day per
formance. "They've got a cham
pion at every position. They'll
scare 290 a couple of times in this
tournament," he said.
