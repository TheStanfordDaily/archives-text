# Women swing into finals as men bogie
## 
### Mark Zeigler 
The men's golf team is al
ready looking ahead to next
year, while the women's team
still has the NCAAs to think
about this season.
The two teams have ex
perienced virtually opposite
seasons, as the men started off
well and then tailed off, while
the women peaked at the end
of the campaign.
"I think that we finished
strong and what we were doing

was pointing and peaking for
the nationals," women's coach
Tim Baldwin said.
"It started slow and peaked
at the point where we are a
very good golf team," he con
tinued.
The Lady Card reached its
lowpoint last November at the
Stanford Fall Intercollegiate
when, as the odds-on favorite
to win the tournament, it
placed fourth. Just a year
earlier Stanford had won its

own tourney by a whopping 18
strokes with virtually the same
squad last season.
Rumors started circulating
that the women's team would
not even be invited to the
NCAAs, to be played on their
home course — a great em
harassment. "Our backs were
really against the wall as far as
getting into the NCAAs,"
Baldwin noted.
But behind the firepower of
senior Lori Castillo, a favorite
to win the NCAA individual
crown, the Cardinal bounced
back in dramatic fashion.
The Stanford linksters began
moving up in tournament
standings. A string of victories,
including an eighth place finish
in the Lady Sun Devil, climaxed
with the Card's placing in the
Southen Intercollegiate —
fourth in a field of the nation's
best.
But Castillo did not propel
the Card's comeback by
herself. She had a little help
from her friends, namely team
mates Debbie Barberio, Kathy
Nino, Joanne Pacillo, Roxy
Gumlia and freshman Diane
Nixon.
"The surprise of the season is
how well Diane Nixon has
played this spring," Baldwin
said. The Card frosh made her
presence known by firing a
three round 234 at the In
tercollegiate, good enough for
10th place in the individual
competition.
Both Castillo and Barberio
are seniors, leaving the Card
with two big holes to fill for
next year's team. But Baldwin
has signed two of the top jun
iors in America to fill the void.
Kathy Kostas, from Palmdale,
Ca., is ranked the No. 1 junior
in the country by Golf Maga
zine. Juli Carmichael, from
Martinsville, Ind., is not far be
hind her, according to

Baldwin.
"We're losing a couple of
fine players and we're gaining
two.So it's a standoff," the Card
coach commented. "They
(Kostas and Carmichael) have a
vast amount of experience."
The men's team will have
their work cut out for them
next year, with the loss of sen
iors Tad Buchannan, David
Games and Neil Robinson,
whose graduation removes
much depth from the Cardinal
roster. Coach Tim Shaaf has
landed two recruits for next
season in an effort to add some.
Carl Wagner from Napa, Ca.,
and Don Walsworth from
Marceline, Mo., will attend
Stanford in the fall.
However, the foundation of
next year's team will be found
in freshman Josh Mondry, who
is the only Card representative
in the NCAA individual com
petition.Mondry led Stanford
with a 74.8 stroke average this
spring.
Another freshman, Scott
Erickson, and sophomores Lew
Dickey, Tim Robinson, Lanny
Sawchuck and Doug Thomp
son, as well as junior John
Scanlon will round out the
Cardinal's lineup.
Mondry and Company had
high hopes heading into spring
play. But a disappionting 12th
place finish in the Western In
tercollegiate dealt the Card a
severe blow.
Schaaf's squad rebounded
two weeks later with a sixth in
the Aztec Intercollegiate. But
the Card faded the following
week, finishing 13th in the Sun
Devil Tournament.
Still with a chance to gain an
invitation to the NCAAs May
24-29 in North Carolina, Stan
ford just missed the necessary
third place finish at the Pac-10
championships, ultimately
placing fifth.
