# Hopes rest with recruits
## Gould's scenario falls far short of baseline 
### Sally Jenkins 
It was a curious non-season,
not a bad one, good one, or re
building one. The men's tennis
team, impossible to call ex
perienced or inexperienced,
just a curious mixture of young,
old, and journeymen players,
finished the 1982 season as an
infamous also-ran.
UCLA, all-knowing, all
seeing, all-powerful, was desti
ny's child from the start. But
Stanford was unable to even at
tempt to defend its 1981 NCAA
title against the Bruins because,
with an overall record of 15-10,
it failed to make the NCAA
tournament.
Instead the omniscient
Bruins took on Pepperdine in
the finals at Athens, Ga. May
21, a team the Cardinal had up
set at home only three weeks
earlier, and which fell with a
whimper 5-1. Yet it is hare to
say the Cardinal deserved a
tournament berth, for it ended
the season with three straight
losses, to USC, UCLA and UC-
Berkeley.
Here is what should have
happened. Sophomore Mike
Falberg and senior Jim Gurfein
return to Stanford for this sea
son instead of turning pro after
winning the 1981 national title.
Falberg and Gurfein combine
with seniors Scott Bondurant,
John Corse, Jeff Arons and
sophomore Scott Davis to pov
ide head coach Dick Gould
with a little omniscience of his
own. Cut to —
Perennial powerhouses
Stanford and UCLA as they
meet in the finals of the
NCAAs. Both teams are loaded
with depth and versatility. It's a
grudge match, and blood is
sure to be shed. After locking
in mortal combat, the Cardinal
prevails. It's a keeper.
But so much for useless con
jecture, the kind Gould tried to
stay away from all season. Here
is the dark horse that played
out the 1982 season.
Scott Davis at No. 1, boy gen
ius and heir apparent to the
throne, by all rights should
have won the 1982 NCAA sin

gles crown this year, were it not
for a peculiar habit he de
veloped of dropping into co
mas at inoportune moments.
Senior Jeff Arons at No. 2,
who started the season at No. 3,
dropped to No. 4, and worked
his way back up. He played
sometimes brilliantly, some
times not at all, and was most
consistent at the No. 4 spot.
Senior Scott Bondurant at
No. 3, who played at No. 5 dur
ing mid-season after starting at
No. 2. Trouble with his serve
and game in general added up
to a streaky season.
Senior John Corse at No. 4,
who found his way into the
starting lineup for the first time
this season. A baseline player,

the most consistent winner on
the squad besides Davis.
Sophomore Mark McKeen
at No. 5, who played at No. 2
throughout mid-season. A fair
ly consisent winner at No. 5, in
experienced at No. 2.
Freshman Paul Robinson and
grad student Jim Miller at No.
6. Robinson started the season,
Miller took over in mid-season,
and Robinson finished it. Both
tenacious players but no match
for Bruins.
The end result was a series of
lineup shuffles in an attempt to
fill obvious holes in the squad.
The squad was left without a
solid winner at the No. 2 spot,
where Bondurant, McKeen,
and Arons all tried their respec

tive hands. The same was true
at the No. 6 position, where
Robinson and Miller were
good for occasional surprsies
but not consistent. The same
was true at No. 3 doubles,
where McKeen and Robinson
couldn't click, and later where
McKeen and Miller were good
for a some upsets but even
tually out-finessed by more ex
perienced teams.
And here is what actually
happened. Under-manned,
out-manned, over-powered
and eventually tired to the
bone, the Cardinal went 3-7 in
Pacific-10 play. The squad lost
two matches in Arizona to the
Wildcats and the Sun Devils at
midseason, then returned

home to win three straight
against Cal, UCSB and Wash
ington. They won three more
in taking revenge against the
Arizona teams and defeating
Trinity at home, to start the
most the crucial part of the
schedule on a good note.
The Cardinal went to Los An
geles April 16with hopesof up
setting USC, UCLA or both.
They ended up praying for rain
and returned with two identi
cal 7-2 losses. The high point of
the season came on April 28
when the Card upset No. 3
ranked Pepperdine at home
5-4. But USC and UCLA visited
the varsity courts the weekend
of April 30, and the end result
was two more losses as the
Bruins won 7-2 again, and USC
slipped by 5-4. Dead week
began early for the Card when
Cal put the nail in the coffin
May 5 at Berkeley with a 5-4
win.
But as it turns out, Stanford
may have won the biggest vic
tory of the season — the re
cruiting battle. In fact, Gould
may very well be snickering be
hind his hand right now, secure
in the knowledge that an
NCAA trophy only lasts one
year, but blue chip recruits can
last as long as four.
Gould knows all about
NCAA trophies because he's
had more of them — six in the
last nine years to be exact —
and the same is true when it
comes to his recruits. He won a
total of four this spring.
Danny Goldie of McLean,
Va. starts off the list of prizes.
The No. 1 ranked boys 18 sin
gles player in the Mid-Atlantic
Section, he was rated No. 10 in
the National 18's this year.
John Letts of Rolling Hills,
Cal. was the fourth ranked U.S.
player among high school sen
iors, and was ranked No. 13 ov
erall in National 18's.
Eric Rosenfeld of Media, Pa.
was ranked No. 47 in boys 18
singles nationally, and a highly
regarded prospect.
Jim Grabb of Tuscon, Ariz.
wa< ranked No. 48 in boys 18
singles this year.

the season came on April 28

5-4. But USC and UCLA visited
the varsity courts the weekend
of April 30, and the end result
was two more losses as the
Bruins won 7-2 again, and USC

SrRATEGY — Head coach Dick Gould confers with his number one sfhgles player Scott
Davis early in the season. The men's team faltered and failed to reach the NCAA cham
pionships.
It was a curious non-season,
not a bad one, good one, or re
building one. The men's tennis
team, impossible to call ex
perienced or inexperienced,
just a curious mixture of young,
old, and journeymen players,
finished the 1982 season as an
infamous also-ran.
UCLA, all-knowing, all
seeing, all-powerful, was desti
ny's child from the start. But
Stanford was unable to even at
tempt to defend its 1981 NCAA
title against the Bruins because,
with an overall record of 15-10,
it failed to make the NCAA
tournament.
Instead the omniscient
Bruins took on Pepperdine in
the finals at Athens, Ga. May
21, a team the Cardinal had up
set at home only three weeks
earlier, and which fell with a
whimper 5-1. Yet it is hare to
say the Cardinal deserved a
tournament berth, for it ended
the season with three straight
losses, to USC, UCLA and UC-
Berkeley.
Here is what should have
happened. Sophomore Mike
Falberg and senior Jim Gurfein
return to Stanford for this sea
son instead of turning pro after
winning the 1981 national title.
Falberg and Gurfein combine
with seniors Scott Bondurant,
John Corse, Jeff Arons and
sophomore Scott Davis to pov
ide head coach Dick Gould
with a little omniscience of his
own. Cut to —
Perennial powerhouses
Stanford and UCLA as they
meet in the finals of the
NCAAs. Both teams are loaded
with depth and versatility. It's a
grudge match, and blood is
sure to be shed. After locking
in mortal combat, the Cardinal
prevails. It's a keeper.
But so much for useless con
jecture, the kind Gould tried to
stay away from all season. Here
is the dark horse that played
out the 1982 season.
Scott Davis at No. 1, boy gen
ius and heir apparent to the
throne, by all rights should
have won the 1982 NCAA sin

gles crown this year, were it not
for a peculiar habit he de
veloped of dropping into co
mas at inoportune moments.
Senior Jeff Arons at No. 2,
who started the season at No. 3,
dropped to No. 4, and worked
his way back up. He played
sometimes brilliantly, some
times not at all, and was most
consistent at the No. 4 spot.
Senior Scott Bondurant at
No. 3, who played at No. 5 dur
ing mid-season after starting at
No. 2. Trouble with his serve
and game in general added up
to a streaky season.
Senior John Corse at No. 4,
who found his way into the
starting lineup for the first time
this season. A baseline player,

the most consistent winner on
the squad besides Davis.
Sophomore Mark McKeen
at No. 5, who played at No. 2
throughout mid-season. A fair
ly consisent winner at No. 5, in
experienced at No. 2.
Freshman Paul Robinson and
grad student Jim Miller at No.
6. Robinson started the season,
Miller took over in mid-season,
and Robinson finished it. Both
tenacious players but no match
for Bruins.
The end result was a series of
lineup shuffles in an attempt to
fill obvious holes in the squad.
The squad was left without a
solid winner at the No. 2 spot,
where Bondurant, McKeen,
and Arons all tried their respec

tive hands. The same was true
at the No. 6 position, where
Robinson and Miller were
good for occasional surprsies
but not consistent. The same
was true at No. 3 doubles,
where McKeen and Robinson
couldn't click, and later where
McKeen and Miller were good
for a some upsets but even
tually out-finessed by more ex
perienced teams.
And here is what actually
happened. Under-manned,
out-manned, over-powered
and eventually tired to the
bone, the Cardinal went 3-7 in
Pacific-10 play. The squad lost
two matches in Arizona to the
Wildcats and the Sun Devils at
midseason, then returned

home to win three straight
against Cal, UCSB and Wash
ington. They won three more
in taking revenge against the
Arizona teams and defeating
Trinity at home, to start the
most the crucial part of the
schedule on a good note.
