British troops ready to attack capital
Britain declared yesterday that despite the loss of two more ships and
24 men — its heaviest toll in a single day — ground forces were poised to
break out of the beachhead on the Falklands and attack the capital of
Stanley. ,
Argentina said it pounded the beachhead near San Carlos and
downed a British jet that rocketed an Argentine ship. It also said an un
determined number of Harrier jets sank along with one of the British
ships two days ago, a claim denied by Britain.
British commandos and paratroops landed lasf Friday 50 miles from
Stanley to establish the beachhead in the first major assault to recapture
the Falklands. ,
The Argentine Joint Chiefs of Staff said army units and the army air
corps were attacking British forces near San Carlos in an effort to con
trol the enemy and limit his deployment." Intermittent rain was re
ported in the area, where winter has already set in.
The Joint Chiefs also said the coast guard vessel Rio Iguazu had been
attacked by two Sea Harriers in the Falklands area and one Harrier had
been downed by anti-aircraft fire. Argentine forces suffered one dead
and two wounded, the Joint Chiefs said.
There was no immediate reaction from Britain, but Defense Secretary
John Nott told Parliament that the British destroyer Coventry was sunk
with 20 men dead and the requisitioned container ship Atlantic Con
veyor was abandoned with four dead after a mass Argentine air attack
off the Falklands two days ago.
British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher said "despite these grievous
losses, neither our resolve nor our confidence is weakened," and Nott
declared that British forces who landed Friday in San Carlos "are poised
to begin their thrust" on Stanley, 50 miles to the east.
He told the House of Commons 20 sailors were killed and about 20
wounded when the Coventry was hit by several bombs as the warship
stood off the northern tip of the Falklands on radar picket duty. The re
maining 240 officers and crew were rescued, he said.
Meanwhile, the U.N. Security Council passed a resolution giving Sec
retary General Javier Perez de Cuellar seven days to work out a truce.
Perez de Cuellar said it was a "very difficult mission."
Argentine Foreign Minister Nicanor Costa Mendez said in New York
befor6 the vote that although his government did not endorse the reso
lution outright "the war is beginning to be so cruel and the numbers of
lives, lost so high that I think public opinion will push governments and
will push the United Nations to peace."
Pope willing to visit Britain, Argentina
London — The biggest security operation in British history is being
mounted to protect Pope John Paul 11, who faces demonstrations by
Protestant extremists vowing to disrupt the first papal visit to Britain.
The Rev lan Paisley, Northern Ireland's firebrand Protestant, and
Pastor Jack tilass, his militant Scottish ally, are planning demonstrations
against the pope in most of the nine cities on the pope s planned sched
ule.
"We're not sending out anybody to protest violently," Glass said
Tuesday in a telephone interview from his home in Glasgow. People
like myself and Paisley will be demonstrating on a banner-type basis."
Scotland Yard Commander Douglas Cree explained that extra secur
ity is needed for the pope because he is attending ceremonies in so
many different places.
