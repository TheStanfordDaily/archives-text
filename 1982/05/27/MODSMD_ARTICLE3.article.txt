British troops ready to attack capital
Britain declared yesterday that despite the loss of two more ships and
24 men — its heaviest toll in a single day — ground forces were poised to
break out of the beachhead on the Falklands and attack the capital of
Stanley. ,
Argentina said it pounded the beachhead near San Carlos and
downed a British jet that rocketed an Argentine ship. It also said an un
determined number of Harrier jets sank along with one of the British
ships two days ago, a claim denied by Britain.
British commandos and paratroops landed lasf Friday 50 miles from
Stanley to establish the beachhead in the first major assault to recapture
the Falklands. ,
The Argentine Joint Chiefs of Staff said army units and the army air
corps were attacking British forces near San Carlos in an effort to con
trol the enemy and limit his deployment." Intermittent rain was re
ported in the area, where winter has already set in.
The Joint Chiefs also said the coast guard vessel Rio Iguazu had been
attacked by two Sea Harriers in the Falklands area and one Harrier had
been downed by anti-aircraft fire. Argentine forces suffered one dead
and two wounded, the Joint Chiefs said.
There was no immediate reaction from Britain, but Defense Secretary
John Nott told Parliament that the British destroyer Coventry was sunk
with 20 men dead and the requisitioned container ship Atlantic Con
veyor was abandoned with four dead after a mass Argentine air attack
off the Falklands two days ago.
British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher said "despite these grievous
losses, neither our resolve nor our confidence is weakened," and Nott
declared that British forces who landed Friday in San Carlos "are poised
to begin their thrust" on Stanley, 50 miles to the east.
He told the House of Commons 20 sailors were killed and about 20
wounded when the Coventry was hit by several bombs as the warship
stood off the northern tip of the Falklands on radar picket duty. The re
maining 240 officers and crew were rescued, he said.
Meanwhile, the U.N. Security Council passed a resolution giving Sec
retary General Javier Perez de Cuellar seven days to work out a truce.
Perez de Cuellar said it was a "very difficult mission."
Argentine Foreign Minister Nicanor Costa Mendez said in New York
befor6 the vote that although his government did not endorse the reso
lution outright "the war is beginning to be so cruel and the numbers of
lives, lost so high that I think public opinion will push governments and
will push the United Nations to peace."
Pope willing to visit Britain, Argentina
London — The biggest security operation in British history is being
mounted to protect Pope John Paul 11, who faces demonstrations by
Protestant extremists vowing to disrupt the first papal visit to Britain.
The Rev lan Paisley, Northern Ireland's firebrand Protestant, and
Pastor Jack tilass, his militant Scottish ally, are planning demonstrations
against the pope in most of the nine cities on the pope s planned sched
ule.
"We're not sending out anybody to protest violently," Glass said
Tuesday in a telephone interview from his home in Glasgow. People
like myself and Paisley will be demonstrating on a banner-type basis."
Scotland Yard Commander Douglas Cree explained that extra secur
ity is needed for the pope because he is attending ceremonies in so
many different places.
John Paul, who arrives tomorrow for a six-day visit, has sur
vived two assassination attempts in just over a year. Scotland
Yard is planning to have more than 7000 police officers on
duty in London alone.
Authorities in Glasgow announced details yesterday of
what they said would be Scotland's biggest police operation
when the pope visits there next Tuesday. They said all leaves
for the 7000-man Strathclyde police force has been canceled
for that day. The Vatican, ending weeks of uncertainty
caused by the Falklands conflict, announced Tuesday that
Pope John Paul II will go ahead with his historic six-day trip to
Britain.
In Buenos Aires, the papal ambassador released a letter
late Tuesday in which the pope said he would be willing to go
to Argentina.
The letter was delivered to the office of Argentine Presi
dent Gen. Leopoldo Galtierei.
The letter said the 62-year-old pontiff felt it was necessary
to "clear up" the reasons for his trip to Britain, which many
people in heavily Roman Catholic Argentina viewed as a sug
gestion of moral support of the British in the Falklands con
flict.
It said the pope's visit to predominantly Protestant Britain
had been planned for two years and if it weren't for the war
"it wouldn't require any justification whatsoever."
Republicans claim budget victory
Washington — The House plunged into a series of impor
tant test votes on Medicare and defense spending yesterday
as Republicans notched one early victory and expressed
growing confidence they can hand President Ronald Reagan
a repeat of last year's budget victory.
"I feel good about it," GOP Leader Bob Michel (R-lll.) said
of chances for assembling a majority for the Reagan-backed

1983 budget with a deficit of $102.6 billion.
Michel said a rival plan supported by the House Democrat
ic leadership was losing strength, but he seemed less certain
of enough support to derail yet a third plan drafted by mod
erates of both parties.
Republicans suggested that some mainstream Democrats
prefer a Reagan victory so they can more easily blame him
for the current recession in their re-election campaigns.
House Speaker Thomas O'Neill (D-Mass.) remained pub
licly upbeat. "That doesn't necessarily square with what
we've seen at all," he said of Michel's assertion.
But the president's allies won the first test of the day when
the House rejected, 339-83, a move by Democrats to sweeten
their plan by scaling down a proposed $47.4 billion cutback
in Reagan's defense budget over three years. The rejected
amendment would have restored $7.6 billion for the Pen
tagon.
Only 12 Republicans supported the move, even though
GOP members overwhelmingly favor higher defense spend
ing than the Democrats are offering. It was an apparent in
dication that Republicans can successfully prevent the Dem
ocratic leadership from making its own spending plan more
attractive — a strategy that ultimately could doom the Dem
ocratic blueprint to defeat.
Hinckley avoids his trial again
Washington — After weeks of cringing under testimony
designed to portray him as insane, suicidal and childishly in
love, John Hinckley boycotted his own trial yesterday as a
psychiatrist testified teen-age actress Jodie Foster repre
sented a "mother figure" to the 26-year-old defendant.
If Hinckley was watching on television, he heard the psy
chiatrist say he perceived Foster as a figure who would pro
tect and love him and that President Ronald Reagan was an
obstacle "denying him access" to her.

The psychiatrist, Dr Thomas Goldman, also agreed with a
statement that on the day Hinckley shot Reagan and three
others he was "like a freight train on a track with no brakes."
"I'm saying he had some feeling that getting rid of Presi
dent Reagan would help him get to Jodie Foster," Goldman
said during cross examination by prosecutor Roger
Adelman.
The reason for Hinckley's absence from the courtroom
was not stated officially, but two sources said Hinckley was
not ill and simply didn't want to be in court.
The sources, who asked that their names not be used, said
Hinckley was so upset yesterday morning that he did not
even want to get dressed. There was no indication whether
Hinckley had advance knowledge of what Goldman, a de
fense witness, would say on the witness stand.
