# Tracksters pull the distance

### Sarah Carrel 
The Stanford men's and
women's track teams wrap up
their 1981-82 year with what
should be considered a suc
cessful season.
The Pacific-10 conference, in
which the men compete, is
probably the toughest in the
country. At the beginning of
the season, six of the Pac-10
squads (Washington St., UCLA,
Arizona St., UC-Berkeley, USC,
and Oregon) were ranked as
the top 10 of this country's dual
meet teams. Although Stanford
finished at the bottom of their
conference in the cham
pionships last week, their dual
meet record improved from
4-6 last year to 6-6 this spring.
Moreover, head coach Brooks
Johnson said that he is seeing
some steady growth in his Card
team.
The men's team, all in all, is a
fairly young squad. Johnson,
now completing his third sea
son at Stanford, has succeeded
in recruiting some top high
school athelctes to join his
group next year, and he ex
pects to build on that base in
the future.
The prize recruits include
J.P. Holland, a triple and long
jumper with the ability to be a
top NCAA competitor. The
Eugene, Ore. native is also ver
satile enough to serve well on
the 4XIOO and 4X400 meter re
lays.
Brian Pettingill, from Cum
berland, Maine is another
freshman who should prove to
be the greatest middle distance
runner Stanford has ever had.
In the weight events,
freshman Shaun Pickering has
moved in to take the place of
the legendary Dave Thomson

in the hammer throw. Pick
ering finished second in the
Pac-10 conference, and is ex
pected to make a good show
ing at the NCAA's. Another
freshman weight man, Garin
Veris, also a member of the
Card football team, is a shotput
threat to any of his peers in the
nation. A strong core of
freshman and sophomores, es
pecially strong in the distance
events, also make the future of
the team look bright.
Yet, even with this broad
base of young talent, gradu
ation will take a heavy toll on
the team. Rod Berry, a great
team leader as well as an out
standing athlete, leaves the top
spot in distance runningto jun
ior Bill Graham. Gary Bruner,
one of the best javelin throwers
ever to attend Stanford, leaves
his records to be challenged by
the recruits Johnson has
rounded up.
The experience of middle
distance runner John Schaer is
something that only Pettingill
can fill for the squad. Schaer is
an NCAA qualifier and strong
role model for the team. Final
ly, Garry Shumway, the top
Cardinal hurdler for three
years, will say farewell to the
team in June. Shumway's
steady improvement over his
college career has put him in
the national limelight in his
event, and this accomplish
ment will make his absence
sorely felt.
The combination of these
veterans and the younger
squad made the 1981-82 season
quite strong overall. The team
has seen significant improve
ment since Johnson took over
the head coaching reins in
1980.

The women's team is even
younger than their male coun
terparts. They will not lose a
single athlete to graduation,
and their 8-5 record speaks
very well for the future.
The women's strength this
year was in the distance events.
Freshmen Sloan Burton and
Ceci Hopp are both ranked na
tionally in long distance. Un
fortunately, Burton suffered
from a foot injury most of the
season and was not able to
compete.
Sophomores Ellen Lyons and
Pattisue Plumer as well as jun
ior sensation Kim Schurpfeil
complete this amazing dis
tance squad which proved un
beatable most of the season.
In the weight events,
sophomore Carol Cady and
junior Mary Osborne are both
nationally qualified com
petitors. Osborne was not able
to add to the Stanford
scoreboard this season be
cause of a fractured foot.
Freshman middle distancer
Regina Jacobs leads the team
— and most of the nation —
with her times this year. She has
shattered school records twice
in the 800 meters, and Johnson
said that he believes that she
can only improve with ex
perience. In the women's
sprints, as in the men's, Stan
ford is quite weak. Junior
sprinter and jumper Pam
Donald provided most of the
Card strength in these events.
Judging by this season, John
son's performers will comprise
the teams to watch in the
future. With good recruiting,
especially in the weak areas
such as sprinting, and con
tinued growth and improve
ment in the veteran team

members, the Cardinal should
fly high in upcoming seasons.
The team was plagued by in
juries this season and still man
aged to sustain respectable
records. Johnson said that this
showing says a lot for the

young team which demon
strated so much spirit and tal
ent.
Both teams look forward to
the NCAA Championships
which will be held on June 3-6
in Provo, Utah.
