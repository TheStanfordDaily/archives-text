# Mignano strikes with sliders
## 
### Adam Berns 
At this time last year, Stan
ford senior Brian Mignano did
not know whether he would
ever pitch again. Last season,
he developed a sore arm and
only pitched 42 innings all sea
son. After the second game of
the Pac-10 season, he failed to
pitch again.
Mignano came back strong
this year with a vigor that even
surprises him.
Like the team which is cur
rently playing in the NCAA
Western Regionals, Mignano
has been in top form this year.
He currently has a 12-5 record
and leads the team in the wins
department. He was chosen to
the All-Pac-10 Southern
Division squad and led the 6-
Pac with 121.2 innings pitched
during the regular season.
Mignano also had a 3.55 ERA.
"Am I surprised by how I've
done this year? Very much so,"
he said. "I didn't think that I'd
have anywhere near this good
a season.
"After my sophomore sea
son when I traveled to Japan,
things have been kind of
downhill. I developed a sore
arm in the middle of my junior
year and didn't even know if I'd
be able to pitch this year at all."

The question of whether
Mignano could pitch was an
swered quickly. He jumped out
to eight quick wins and was vir
tually unbeatable throughout
the early part of the season.
In the middle of the year he
hita partial slump —along with
the rest of the team. He
thought that part of the reason
stemmed from an extended
outing in the UCLA series.
"My eighth win came against
UCLA and I pitched a complete
game that Saturday," he said.
"After some of our pitchers
were having problems on Sun
day, I told Marquess that I
could go in and against the
coaches' advice I pitched the
last two innings. After that I had
some problems with my slider.
"I entered my slump the
same time as the team did. I
thought that most of the games
were close and I think all of us
on the team had a hard time
figuring out what was wrong."
Mignano has started to pitch
well lately and he feels that
much of his success is due to his
slider.
"I feel that I've been starting
to pitch better lately,"
Mignano said. "My slider has
been more consistent.
"My motion was starting to

get a little bit off but I think I've
been getting back on track.
When you pitch 130 innings
you have to think a little more
about what you're doing be
cause you start getting tired.
"(Last week) the Daily ran a
picture of me pitching which
had me in perfect form. I wish I
could have that motion all of
the time."
Although Mignano has been
pitching well, he was a little bit
surprised at his success in the
Oregon State series consider
ing the number of pitches he
threw.
"I think I set the record for
the least number of pitches —
91 — against Fullerton State,"
Mignano said, "and the most
number of pitches against Ore
gon State. I've never thrown
more than 120 pitches in a
complete game, but I threw 175
against Oregon State. You
would expect in a game like
that to lose, but our hitting is
really coming through."
As for the playoffs, Mignano
said he feels that his team
stands a good chance of mak
ing it to the World Series in
Omaha.
"I think right now we are
starting to peak," Mignano said
last week. "I think we are a

good bet to get to Omaha."
This is Mignano's last year on
the team and will probably be
his last in baseball.
"I have already accepted a
job with Arthur Anderson Cor
poration," Mignano ex
plainded. "I'm still leaving pro
baseball open, but I've told
scouts I won't sign unless I get a

large amount of money. As an
industrial engineering major I
can earn a lot of money in the
business world and I don't
think it is worth it to play
baseball for $6000 a year."
"I think athletics have
helped me grow a lot, but its
not what I want to do for the
rest of my life/'he concluded.
