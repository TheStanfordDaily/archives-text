## BOOK REVIEW Nuclear deterrence rejected 
### The Fate of the Earth by Jonathan Schell Knopf: 1982 244 pp., $11. 95 
The originality of Jonathan Schell's The Fate of
The Earth is in his rejection of nuclear de
terrence. Deterrence is morally indefensible
and logically inconsistent, he argues, because
nobody can predict what the outcome of a nu
clear war will be once it starts, no matter at what
level.
Yet paradoxically, it is precisely this uncertain
ty — this fear of what former Secretary of De
fense Robert McNamara termed the "vast un
known" — that is credited with keeping the
peace for the past 37 years.
Winston Churchill's dictum, "Safety will be
the sturdy child of terror, and survival the twin
brother of annihilation," has taken on almost
biblical implications.
To achieve this "balance of terror," with
arsenals of thousands of nuclear weapons, most
many times more powerful than the bombs that
destroyed Hiroshima and Nagasaki, nuclear i
strategists have had to set themselves apart from
their own humanity to plan actions that "from
any recognizable moral point of view are in
defensible," Schell writes.
And though he believes that the chains of M
command would break long before a nuclear
exchange would bring about the extinction of
the species, Schell devotes a great deal of space
to a discussion of the immorality of bringing
about our extinction. His argument is that the
mere possibility of bringing about extinctionov-«||
errides any other moral value, however noble.
But Schell also sees deterrence theory as
logically inconsistent. Deterrence strategists are'
doomed to incessantly plan for future attacks;
and counterattacks whose prevention is the
strategy's very purpose. They must design everf j
more complex weapons and plan strategies that? |
can never be put into action by any rational '
being. Yet the strategies have to be designed to
be used because the success of deterrence relies;
on the credibility of the threat.
Deterrence against a nuclear attack depends
on the ability to respond in kind, inflicting "un-pj
acceptable" damage to the enemy in a second
strike But the threat of a second strike cannot be ;
made credible, Schell argues, because there is
no credible motive left after the first strike ar- j
rives. There is no society, no democracy or so
cialism left to protect.
Schell writes that deterrence doctrine, "is
based on a logical mistake: one cannot credibly
deter a first strike with a second strike whose
raison d'etre dissolves the moment the first,
strike arrives." Because there is no real motive
for launching a second strike, we have to rely on
stand in motives such as the desire for revenge
or an inflexible chain of command and esca
lation, none of which Schell finds atceptable.
Deterrence fares no better with threats to a
nation's vital interests. There are two choices
faced by a leader of a nuclear nation when con
fronted with such a threat: do nothing in the
face of the agression or theaten to retaliate with
nuclear weapons. Former President Jimmy
Carter faced just such a choice when the Soviet
Union invaded Afghanistan. Carter chose to
threaten the Soviet Union to deter any moves on
the Persian Gulf. Yet, however rational the use of
such a threat to prevent aggression may be, car
rying out the threat is not.

Nuclear weapons have not just made war be
tween the superpowers obsolete, the choices
facing the leaders "don't include war any long
er." Nuclear weapons have created an interna
tional system that has made the nation state ob
solete.
Deterrence has created a world that is haivway
between the nuclear-scientific world of today
and the political-military world of yesterday.
Schell draws an analogy from civil society argu
ing that we are somewhere between a Hob
besian state of nature and civil state.
In Schell's "state of nature" each individual
state stands alone and posesses sovereignty —
the ability to settle disputes with violence if nec
essary. In a civil state, each individual surrenders
the capacity for violence to the central authority
which employs the available resources through
a system of laws into the service of a common
good.
The deterrence system works as if individual
states have combined their forces into a single
force — a doomsday machine that can annihilate
anyone that breaks the rules — but have failed to
establish any central authority to preside over it.
It rs tne nation state, and not just deterrence,
that is the deepest source of our difficulty, ac
cording to Schell. It is this belief that leads Schell
to attack the axiom of arms controllers: that nu
clear weapons can be dealt with as a separate is
sue all of their own. Negotiations such as the
SALT talks are mere aspirin to a dying patient.
•In contrast to those who see a replacement of
nuclear with conventional weapons, Schell
argues that nuclear disarmament — which he
says is "the minimum technical requirement for
real safety from extinction" — cannot occur if
conventional arms are left in place.
As long as nations "defend themselves with
arms of any kind," he argues, they remain fully
sovereign and as long as they are sovereign
"they will be able to build nuclear weapons if
they so choose."
Schell rewrites the Churchill dictum to read:
"National sovereignty will be the sturdy child of
terror and twin brother of annihilation."
Both the effectiveness and the failure of
Schell's writing style is in his Concern with the
"profound" statement and the constant repeti
tion of his main points. Both of these qualities
make The Fate of the Earth an easy target for
critics.
Schell's style has been called^'pornographic"
for his ufe of gory detail from the survivors of the
gfiiHiroshirna and Nagasaki bombings and his
meticulously detailed descriptions of the effects
of a one megaton weapon exploded over the
Empire State Building. He has been called pre
tentious for his reliance on the "greats" to give
weight to his argument. Jg|&
Schell resurrects a whole gallery of the great
men and women of history: Socrates, Rainer
Rilke, Fyodor Dostoyevski, Aristotle, Emmanuel
Kant and hundreds more, to show just how well
read he is.
Almost any line pulled out of context from the
book sounds pretentious: "Like the thought 'I
do not exist/ the thought 'Humanity is now ex
tinct' is an impossible one for a rational person,
because as soon as it is, we are not," is one exam
ple.
Yet the book works as a whole — it wears
down the reader's defenses against reading such
books. It forces the reader to rethink the prob-
lem in other than abstract terms. And most of all,
it is hard to put down.
Yet, however convincing and passionate
Schv II s argument may be, he fails to present any
concrete alternative to deterrence — choosing
to leave that task to others. Perhaps he hopes
that educating everyone to the urgency of the
situation will transform not only our perceptions
but our political realities as well.
It is interesting that even the nuclear freeze
movement and what are considered by many to
be "radical" proposals — such as the 50 percent
accross the board cut in nuclear stockpiles pro
posed by former U.S. Ambassador to the Soviet
Union George Kennan — shy away from any talk
of reductions below "sufficiency."

In the years ahead, as deterrence strategy
grows more complex and convoluted through a
combination of technology growth and nuclear
proliferation, we will see the disarmament
movement grow.
Nuclear weapons are likely to become the
great leveling factor in world politics as small
countries and political groups who have little to
loose and much to gain from nuclear blackmail
acquire them.
Already the situation exists where increased
cooperation between the superpowers, both in
the management of crises and a tighter policing
of the world's nuclear materials, is in the interest
of all countries. This more immediate brand of
self interest is much more comprehensible to
the world's leaders than any moral arguments
against extinction.

more complex weapons and plan strategies that? |
can never be put into action by any rational '
being. Yet the strategies have to be designed to
be used because the success of deterrence relies;
on the credibility of the threat.
Deterrence against a nuclear attack depends
on the ability to respond in kind, inflicting "un-pj
acceptable" damage to the enemy in a second
strike But the threat of a second strike cannot be ;
made credible, Schell argues, because there is
no credible motive left after the first strike ar- j
rives. There is no society, no democracy or so
cialism left to protect.
Schell writes that deterrence doctrine, "is
based on a logical mistake: one cannot credibly
deter a first strike with a second strike whose
raison d'etre dissolves the moment the first,
strike arrives." Because there is no real motive
for launching a second strike, we have to rely on
stand in motives such as the desire for revenge
or an inflexible chain of command and esca
lation, none of which Schell finds atceptable.
Deterrence fares no better with threats to a
nation's vital interests. There are two choices
faced by a leader of a nuclear nation when con
fronted with such a threat: do nothing in the
face of the agression or theaten to retaliate with
nuclear weapons. Former President Jimmy
Carter faced just such a choice when the Soviet
Union invaded Afghanistan. Carter chose to
threaten the Soviet Union to deter any moves on
the Persian Gulf. Yet, however rational the use of
such a threat to prevent aggression may be, car
rying out the threat is not.

Nuclear weapons have not just made war be
tween the superpowers obsolete, the choices
facing the leaders "don't include war any long
er." Nuclear weapons have created an interna
tional system that has made the nation state ob
solete.
Deterrence has created a world that is haivway
between the nuclear-scientific world of today
and the political-military world of yesterday.
Schell draws an analogy from civil society argu
ing that we are somewhere between a Hob
besian state of nature and civil state.
In Schell's "state of nature" each individual
state stands alone and posesses sovereignty —
the ability to settle disputes with violence if nec
essary. In a civil state, each individual surrenders
the capacity for violence to the central authority
which employs the available resources through
a system of laws into the service of a common
good.
The deterrence system works as if individual
states have combined their forces into a single
force — a doomsday machine that can annihilate
anyone that breaks the rules — but have failed to
establish any central authority to preside over it.
It rs tne nation state, and not just deterrence,
that is the deepest source of our difficulty, ac
cording to Schell. It is this belief that leads Schell
to attack the axiom of arms controllers: that nu
clear weapons can be dealt with as a separate is
sue all of their own. Negotiations such as the
SALT talks are mere aspirin to a dying patient.
•In contrast to those who see a replacement of
nuclear with conventional weapons, Schell
argues that nuclear disarmament — which he
says is "the minimum technical requirement for
real safety from extinction" — cannot occur if
conventional arms are left in place.
As long as nations "defend themselves with
arms of any kind," he argues, they remain fully
sovereign and as long as they are sovereign
"they will be able to build nuclear weapons if
they so choose."
Schell rewrites the Churchill dictum to read:
"National sovereignty will be the sturdy child of
terror and twin brother of annihilation."
Both the effectiveness and the failure of
Schell's writing style is in his Concern with the
"profound" statement and the constant repeti
tion of his main points. Both of these qualities
make The Fate of the Earth an easy target for
critics.
Schell's style has been called^'pornographic"
for his ufe of gory detail from the survivors of the
gfiiHiroshirna and Nagasaki bombings and his
meticulously detailed descriptions of the effects
of a one megaton weapon exploded over the
Empire State Building. He has been called pre
tentious for his reliance on the "greats" to give
weight to his argument. Jg|&
Schell resurrects a whole gallery of the great
men and women of history: Socrates, Rainer
Rilke, Fyodor Dostoyevski, Aristotle, Emmanuel
Kant and hundreds more, to show just how well
read he is.
Almost any line pulled out of context from the
book sounds pretentious: "Like the thought 'I
do not exist/ the thought 'Humanity is now ex
tinct' is an impossible one for a rational person,
because as soon as it is, we are not," is one exam
ple.
Yet the book works as a whole — it wears
down the reader's defenses against reading such
books. It forces the reader to rethink the prob-
lem in other than abstract terms. And most of all,
it is hard to put down.
Yet, however convincing and passionate
Schv II s argument may be, he fails to present any
concrete alternative to deterrence — choosing
to leave that task to others. Perhaps he hopes
that educating everyone to the urgency of the
situation will transform not only our perceptions
but our political realities as well.
It is interesting that even the nuclear freeze
movement and what are considered by many to
be "radical" proposals — such as the 50 percent
accross the board cut in nuclear stockpiles pro
posed by former U.S. Ambassador to the Soviet
Union George Kennan — shy away from any talk
of reductions below "sufficiency."

In the years ahead, as deterrence strategy
grows more complex and convoluted through a
combination of technology growth and nuclear
proliferation, we will see the disarmament
movement grow.
Nuclear weapons are likely to become the
great leveling factor in world politics as small
countries and political groups who have little to
loose and much to gain from nuclear blackmail
acquire them.
Already the situation exists where increased
cooperation between the superpowers, both in
the management of crises and a tighter policing
of the world's nuclear materials, is in the interest
of all countries. This more immediate brand of
self interest is much more comprehensible to
the world's leaders than any moral arguments
against extinction.

The originality of Jonathan Schell's The Fate of
The Earth is in his rejection of nuclear de
terrence. Deterrence is morally indefensible
and logically inconsistent, he argues, because
nobody can predict what the outcome of a nu
clear war will be once it starts, no matter at what
level.
Yet paradoxically, it is precisely this uncertain
ty — this fear of what former Secretary of De
fense Robert McNamara termed the "vast un
known" — that is credited with keeping the
peace for the past 37 years.
Winston Churchill's dictum, "Safety will be
the sturdy child of terror, and survival the twin
brother of annihilation," has taken on almost
biblical implications.
To achieve this "balance of terror," with
arsenals of thousands of nuclear weapons, most
many times more powerful than the bombs that
destroyed Hiroshima and Nagasaki, nuclear i
strategists have had to set themselves apart from
their own humanity to plan actions that "from
any recognizable moral point of view are in
defensible," Schell writes.
And though he believes that the chains of M
command would break long before a nuclear
exchange would bring about the extinction of
the species, Schell devotes a great deal of space
to a discussion of the immorality of bringing
about our extinction. His argument is that the
mere possibility of bringing about extinctionov-«||
errides any other moral value, however noble.
But Schell also sees deterrence theory as
logically inconsistent. Deterrence strategists are'
doomed to incessantly plan for future attacks;
and counterattacks whose prevention is the
strategy's very purpose. They must design everf j
more complex weapons and plan strategies that? |
can never be put into action by any rational '
being. Yet the strategies have to be designed to
be used because the success of deterrence relies;
