# An interview with Bernard Malamud
## 
### Todd Pickett 
With seven novels, three col
lections of short stories and a
Pulitzer Prize garnered along
the way, Bernard Malamud has
emerged as one of America's
greatest storytellers. At 68, he
shows no signs of letting up.
The galleys of his eighth nov
el God's Grace lay rolled up
like an old newspaper on the
sofa of his office at Stanford's
Center for Advanced Study in
the Behavioral Sciences, where
he has spent the last nine
months completing it. Having
received the final strokes from
the artist, the work was ready
for the publishers.
"It's taking an enormous
chance," he said, "and it
works. It's easy to fall on your
face with something that has
the quality of a fable."
Malamud spoke slowly,
sometimes stopping until the
right word came to his mind.
"When i finish a book, I have a
hard time with words," he
apologized.
Goo's Grace follows the ad
ventures of Calvin Cohen, one
of the few survivors of a nucle
ar holocaust. Cohen, who
might have been a rabbi but is a
paleontologist, is doing a sur
vey near the ocean floor in his
submersible craft when the at
tack occurs. Afterwards, he is
told by God that "through a
miniscule error you have es
caped destruction."
Cohen later discovers that a
chimpanzee, a pet of one of his
colleagues, has stowed away
on the craft. Together, like
father and son, the two eke out
an existence while Cohen at
tempts to bring God to the bar
of justice for His deeds.
The mythical nature of the
novel is reminiscent of
Malamud's earlier works, many
of which mix the actual with
the supernatural, and the com
mon with the fantastic.
That the story begins on the
first day of thermonuclear war

reflects the author's concern
for the fate of mankind in this
nuclear age. "I used to not
have fears," he said. "Now I
fear for humanity and the
threat of extinction by the
atom bomb."
Another concern, the erod
ing of man's right of freedom
of expression, has brought
Malamud out from behind his
typewriter to awaken writers to
the growing threat of
censorship.
"A decade ago, I realized
there was more to life than
writing books," he said. "At a
time of peril, I felt the need to
use my reputation for some
thing more than selling
books."
From 1979-1981, Malamud
served as president of PEN, an
organization that exists to pro
tect authors from censorship.
Much of the organization's
time and money goes to aid
.writers imprisoned in the Sovi
et-controlled countries.
But according to Malamud,
the threat of censorship has
grown alarmingly within the
United States. In a speech at
the annual PEN conference in
June, 1981, Malamud — whose
Pultitzer Prize winning novel
The Fixer has been banned
from some Long Island
classrooms — stressed the
need for writers to campaign
actively against censorship.
"I think we all know that
many writers shy away from
this kind of effort or action be
cause they say it interferes with
the pure act of writing and per
haps with the life of the writer. I
think they are wrong. I think
they will have to commit them
selves to active defense of their
right to express themselves as
free minds, or they may soon
have to contend with a much
diminished freedom of ex
pression."
Concerning the banning of
The Fixer for its "anti-Semitic
language," Malamud said, "I
contend that no one in his right
mind can read The Fixer and

characterize it as anti-Semitic."
The Fixer, set in Czarist
Russia, traces the arrest and im
prisonment of a handyman ac
cused of murdering a gentile
child and using his blood to
make Passover matzos. The fix
er, Yakov Bok, is maligned by
the introduction of false evi
dence by Russian officials.
Throughout the book,
Malamud reveals the blatant
absurdity of prejudice, first
through the fantastic tale of the
Jewish ritual killing and then
through the harrassment of
Bok by the officials.
The interpretation by the
Long Island school board that
banned the book "stands the
meaning of the story on its
head," Malamud said. The
book is still banned, along with
nine other books by prominent
authors, from the school sys
tem.
Malamud's involvement
with PEN has reduced his lei
sure but not histimespent writ
ing, a necesssity for the author.
In his novels and short
stories, he has written primarily
about Jewish people. They are,
to Malamud, a symbol of strug
gle and injustice. Although the
suffering of the Jews in World
War II spurred Malamud to
write, he refuses to be defined
as a "Jewish writer," — a desig
nation that was thrust upon
him and other post-war writers
such as Saul Bellow and Philip
Roth. Rather than cultural or
religious, Malamud calls his
link with the Jews "spiritual."
"Jewishness is a part of my
life," he said, but "my strongest
infuencesarethe literatureand
history of America and Eu
rope."
The gloom and travail that
many of Malamud's characters
experience has caused some
critics to call the author
pessimistic in his attitudes
toward humanity and life. But
this judgment falls short. The

struggles the characters under
go are the necessary paths to
self-knowledge and moral re
finement — the paths to the
creation of a new life that the
author believes is attainable.
"People say I write so much
about misery," he once said,
"but you write about what you
write best. As you are grooved
so you are graved. One is con
ditioned early in family life to
an interpretation of the world
and the grievingis that no mat
ter how much happiness or
success you collect, you cannot
obliterate your early ex
perience — diminshed per
haps — it stays with you."
