ganomics

Pantheon: 1982

In his new book Greed Is Not
Enough: Reaganomics Robert
Lekachman, an ultra-liberal
economist from Lehman City
College in New York, surveys
the economic wasteland at the
beginning of 1982. He asks
himself how a downturn in the
economy could produce the
policies which contradict, in ef
fect and in intent, the previous
50 years of new deal
pr o g r e s si vi s m which
Lekachman sees as the mark of
advanced society.
But Reaganomics attacks
more than the president's as
sault on our social programs.

In an era of scarce resources,
especially the coming scarcity
in governmental resources, the
author argues that the fiscal
and regulatory benefits that are
available should go to those
who need and deserve them:
the poor, the elderly, and the
sick, among others.
Judging from the structure of
the book, it seems almost as if
there is so much to attack that
Lekachman didn't know where
to begin.
The introduction contains
references to all of the regu
latory programs about to fall by
the wayside under the Reagan
administration. Secretary of
the Interior James Watt,
Lekachman writes, "has openly
enunciated plans to open up as
much of the public domain as

he can possibly arrange to
private exploitation."
Furthermore, "Reagan's de
regulators busily dismantle Oc
cupational Safety and Health
Administration efforts to pro
tect factory employees against
noxious chemicals, dangerous
equipment, and noise levels
destructive of hearing."
Finally, "Washington's De
fense plans and Energy policies
add to the problems of the
troubled Northeast and in
dustrial Midwest, and impart
unneeded stimulus to the
booming Southwest and Rocky
Mountain States."
In hiscritiqueof Reagan's tax
policy, Lekachman slowly,
carefully, and adeptly lays out
the effects of the tax cuts. Lo
and behold, he finds the tax

cuts which were being called a
triumph for the "little guy" are
actually a blatantly regressive
boost to the middle-upper and
upper income tax brackets.
Similarly, Reagan adminis
tration budget priorities reveal
a strong distaste for social pro
grams which benefit the poor.
For instance, Lekachman
points out that the 1984 military
will account for just less than a
third of the total budget, up
from 25 percent of the total at
present. By contrast, he notes,
"safety net programs" will be
losing ground to defense.
The "Voodoo Economics" of
supply-side theory, Reagan
style, does not escape un
scathed either. Reagan's poli
cies are known to those in the
business, like Prof. Michael
Boskin of the economics de
partment here, as "punk supp
ly-side." Real supply-side eco
nomics entails increased con
sumer saving and business in
vestment through tax cuts and
investment incentives.
Lekachman points out the
problem with this plan, which
assumes greater saving on the
part of "consumers (who) have
been in the habit of disbursing
95 cents out of any additional
dollar that flows their way."

The faith on the part of the
administration that businesses
would react favorably to Rea
gan's policies also underwrote
impending disaster. Businesses
reacted with a resolute lack of
faith. The consequences have
been disastrous. The auto and
home building industries,
down before Reagan took of
fice, are now even worse off.
Interest rates soared and in
vestment plummeted.
Lekachman has swung his
pen a little too wildly. For while
the subjects of his quite potent
verbal assault are frequently
deserving, he also manages to
hit upon some arguably less
culpable groups. For instance,
he contends that "we have
been coddling veterans since
the end of the 18th century."
Foes of regulation are another
target in a passage which links
deregulatory sentiment with
provincial and regressive legis
lative action.
Another problem with the
book is organization. The vigor
with which Lekachman has
pursued his prey may have
caused him to overlook the
equally necessary focus that
cements a good critique.
