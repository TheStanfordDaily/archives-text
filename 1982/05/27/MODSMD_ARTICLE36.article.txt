Hitchcock — the
Murderous Gaze
by William Rothman
Harvard University Press: 1982
372 pp; $27.50
The "real" Alfred Hitchcock
is a figure as mysterious as any
that appeared in his 53 films.
Was he a clever technician who
managed to stumble upon
themes which disturbed and
delighted audiences or was he
a film essayist who worked to
conceal his means and machin
ations in order to intensify the
power of his effects?
The problem with studying
Hitchcock's work is com
plicated in that no other direc
tor has had such a familiar pub
lic persona. Hitchcock became
the "master of suspense," the
jovial creator of "therapeutic
shocks." He lent his figure to a
television series (for which he
provided a distinctive profile
and gleefully irreverent open
ing and closing remarks, while
directing only a few of the
dozens of episodes) and gave
his face and name (and nothing
else) to a mystery magazine.
We all know Hitchcock
through the image he chose to
present to us. But that image is
of little help — rather, it's more
apt to be a hindrance — when
one attempts to evaluate how
his films work and what they
contain. We're forced to return
to the solution offered by D.H.
Lawrence: don't trust the
teller, trust the tale.
Unlike the television series
or the magazines, Hitchcock's
movies were his tales alone
(often to the disgruntlement of
the screenwriters, the ranks of
whom included Raymond
Chandler and Thornton Wil
der, who saw their written
work transformed by the vision
and fixations of the director).
And Hitchcock created a genre
all his own — "the Hitchcock
thriller" — which explored an

obsession with the irresistable
link between romanticism and
violence.
The director's fixations and
obsessions were expressed
with a dreamlike clarity, where
even narrative plausibility
could be overturned in favor of
conjuring up a lightning-flash
of feeling.
In Hitchcock — the
Murderous Gaze, William
Rothman makes a close — vir
tually shot-by-shot — analysis
of the style and meaning of five
great Hitchcock thrillers: The
Lodger, a '20s silent film;
Murder!, one of Hitchcock's
(and Britain's) first sound films;
The Thirty-nine Steps, usually
regarded as the best movie he
made in England; Shadow of a
Doubt, his first American mas
terpiece; and Psycho, which
gave the director his greatest
popular and critical success.
The films Rothman has
selected to study span nearly all
of Hitchcock's long career.
They all reveal the same wit and
the same fears, but, through
the decades, the wit becomes
more biting and the fear more
deeply ingrained. Rothman
maintains that "Psycho's
achievement is to bring
Hitchcock's filmmaking
project to a successful con
clusion. Yet, if Psycho confirms
the immortality of Hitchcock's
authorship, it also confirms
Hitchcock's own mortality as
no earlier Hitchcock film had
done."
Rothman asks the films to
speak for themselves by look
ing at their narrative structures,
at their editing techniques, at
their styles of cinematography
— at everything that makes
them films. His analyses are
backed up by frame enlarge
ments, which, unlike conven
tional publicity stills, are taken
directly from the film as it is
shown in theaters and reveal

exactly what composition and
lighting strategies have been
used. If one of the purposes of
criticism is to make one see
what might otherwise have
been missed, then Rothman
has done an admirable job.
Rothman's conclusion is a
provocative one. He writes,
"film, in Hitchcock's work, is
the medium by which he made
himself known, or at least
knowable — the bridge be
tween himself and us. But it is
also a barrier that stands be
tween Hitchcock and us. It
stands for everything that sepa
rates Hitchcock from his au
dience, and indeed for ev
erything that separates any one

human being from all others.
By dedicating his life to the
making of films that are calls for
acknowledgement, while
doing everything in his power
to assure that such acknowl
edgement would be deferred

until after his death, Hitchcock
remained true to his art, and
true to the medium of film."
The idea of film, ostensibly a
means of communication be
tween one mind and another,

acting instead as a barrier
against communication is a
compelling one. This idea of
barriers between minds is mir
rored in the structures of
Hitchcock's films, where char
acters are defined and driven
by what they know or don't
know.
Rothman suggests that, to
the very end, ii was Hitchcock,
as the teller of the tale, who
mediated the relationship be
tween himself and his au
dience. The director's
"murderous gaze," which pro
duced one of the most dis
tinctive bodies of work in the
cinema, lingers on to amuse,
delight, terrify, and provoke
us.

the "master of suspense," the
jovial creator of "therapeutic
shocks." He lent his figure to a
television series (for which he
provided a distinctive profile
and gleefully irreverent open
ing and closing remarks, while
directing only a few of the
dozens of episodes) and gave
his face and name (and nothing
else) to a mystery magazine.
We all know Hitchcock
through the image he chose to
present to us. But that image is
of little help — rather, it's more
apt to be a hindrance — when
one attempts to evaluate how
his films work and what they
contain. We're forced to return
to the solution offered by D.H.
Lawrence: don't trust the
teller, trust the tale.
Unlike the television series
or the magazines, Hitchcock's
movies were his tales alone
(often to the disgruntlement of
the screenwriters, the ranks of
whom included Raymond
Chandler and Thornton Wil
der, who saw their written
work transformed by the vision
and fixations of the director).
And Hitchcock created a genre
all his own — "the Hitchcock
thriller" — which explored an

obsession with the irresistable
link between romanticism and
violence.
The director's fixations and
obsessions were expressed
with a dreamlike clarity, where
even narrative plausibility
could be overturned in favor of
conjuring up a lightning-flash
of feeling.
In Hitchcock — the
Murderous Gaze, William
Rothman makes a close — vir
tually shot-by-shot — analysis
of the style and meaning of five
great Hitchcock thrillers: The
Lodger, a '20s silent film;
Murder!, one of Hitchcock's
(and Britain's) first sound films;
The Thirty-nine Steps, usually
regarded as the best movie he
made in England; Shadow of a
Doubt, his first American mas
terpiece; and Psycho, which
gave the director his greatest
popular and critical success.
The films Rothman has
selected to study span nearly all
of Hitchcock's long career.
They all reveal the same wit and
the same fears, but, through
the decades, the wit becomes
more biting and the fear more
deeply ingrained. Rothman
maintains that "Psycho's
achievement is to bring
Hitchcock's filmmaking
project to a successful con
clusion. Yet, if Psycho confirms
the immortality of Hitchcock's
authorship, it also confirms
Hitchcock's own mortality as
no earlier Hitchcock film had
done."
Rothman asks the films to
speak for themselves by look
ing at their narrative structures,
at their editing techniques, at
their styles of cinematography
— at everything that makes
them films. His analyses are
backed up by frame enlarge
ments, which, unlike conven
tional publicity stills, are taken
directly from the film as it is
shown in theaters and reveal

exactly what composition and
lighting strategies have been
used. If one of the purposes of
criticism is to make one see
what might otherwise have
been missed, then Rothman
has done an admirable job.
Rothman's conclusion is a
provocative one. He writes,
"film, in Hitchcock's work, is
the medium by which he made
himself known, or at least
knowable — the bridge be
tween himself and us. But it is
also a barrier that stands be
tween Hitchcock and us. It
stands for everything that sepa
rates Hitchcock from his au
dience, and indeed for ev
erything that separates any one

human being from all others.
By dedicating his life to the
making of films that are calls for
acknowledgement, while
doing everything in his power
to assure that such acknowl
edgement would be deferred

until after his death, Hitchcock
remained true to his art, and
true to the medium of film."
The idea of film, ostensibly a
means of communication be
tween one mind and another,

acting instead as a barrier
against communication is a
compelling one. This idea of
barriers between minds is mir
rored in the structures of
Hitchcock's films, where char
acters are defined and driven
by what they know or don't
know.
Rothman suggests that, to
the very end, ii was Hitchcock,
as the teller of the tale, who
mediated the relationship be
tween himself and his au
dience. The director's
"murderous gaze," which pro
duced one of the most dis
tinctive bodies of work in the
cinema, lingers on to amuse,
delight, terrify, and provoke
us.
