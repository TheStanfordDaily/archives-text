# Garamendi out to disprove pollsters
## 
### Peggy Hernandez 
John Garamendi, the state Senate
majority leader from Walnut Grove,
wants to be California's next gov
ernor. In spite of public opinion polls
which indicate Los Angeles Mayor
Tom Bradley will take the Democrat
ic gubernatorial nomination on June
8, Garamendi is convinced Californi
ans have not decided who they will
vote for.

News Analysis

"The perception in the press and
among political writers is that Bradley
will win," Garamendi said at an Athe
rton fundraiser on Sunday. "But Cali
fornians are searching, looking for
the right candidate."
Garamendi believes that within the
next two weeks Californians will de
cide he is that candidate, even
though television advertising buys
are difficult with low campaign
funds. "We're not in debt, but we're
not doing anything extravagent
either," said his sister-in-law Nancy.
The Garamendi bid for California's
gubernatorial race, to replace Ed
mund "Jerry" Brown, is anything but
extravagant. In a small, private air
plane, Garamendi flys around the
state for public appearances. On

Sunday, he was met at the small air
port in Palo Alto by a staff member
and was driven to Atherton in a small
four-door car which also accom
modated his sister-in-law Nancy and
the plane's pilot.
"I can see we're entering the pov
erty belt," Garamendi said as the car
neared the site of the $25 per person
fundraiser. He was then ushered into
the study of the home for an in
terview, but first asked for a napkin to
clean his dust-covered shoes.
Appearance is part of the Gar
amendi charisma. An imposing man
with a football player's build (he let
tered in football and wrestling at UC
Berkeley), Garamendi elicited "he's
so cute" remarks from some women
in the 70-person crowd at the Athe
rton event.
And Garamendi is not without a
strong political background. At 37,
he has had a meteoric rise in politics:
he was elected to the Assembly in
1974, elected to the state Senate in
1976, re-elected in 1980 and elected
state Senate majority leader in 1981.
He holds an MBA from Harvard and
served two years in the Peace Corps
with his wife, Patti, in Ethiopia.
Garamendi bristles when asked
about fellow Democratic contender
Bradley. "After nine months of cam

paigning, I don't know the man,"
Garamendi said. "His campaign is de
signed to hide him from the public. I
don't know how he thinks or how he
approaches problems."
Last March, Garamendi personally
invited Bradley to an open debate,
but Bradley refused. Bradley's refusal
to debate frustrates Garamendi and
his campaign members. "Does the
man have something to hide?" one
member said. "Why won't he talk
about the issues?"
Garamendi's tactics, then, are to
discuss the issues, particularly three:
transportation, education and the
environment.
"(California's Transportation Di
rector) Adrianna Gianturco is a dis
aster," Garamendi said. "She has al
ienated an entire state.
"She tried to shut down freeways
and force people into mass transpor
tation causing mass transportation to
be retarded for five or six years."
As governor, Garamendi said he
would budget $500 million from tax
es on oil companies for building free
ways and highways. But his first
priority would be to build up mass
urban transportation.
In education, Garamendi wants to
reform state programs, like Medi-
Cal, to free up dollars which would

help revitalize the state's education
system. He hopes the state can main
tain student loans, but said this de
pends on whether Congress ap
proves President Ronald Reagan's
1983 budget proposals.
The environment is Garamendi's
stronghold. He has been a long-time
enemy of Proposition 9, which sup
ports the Peripheral Canal. Gar
amendi, who considers the project
too expensive and environmentally


John Garamendi
unsafe, said Sunday he was en
couraged by recent public opinion
surveys which indicate statewide
support for the proposition is fading.
Garamendi is also a leading ad
vocate for controls on toxic
chemicals and agricultural land pres
ervation. He was also instrumental in
saving Lake Tahoe from exploitation
through a Bi-State Compact between
California and Nevada.
Garamendi opposed offshore oil
drilling, but called Secretary of the
Interior James Watt "the best thing
that ever happened because he
made Californians aware of their en
vironment."

be retarded for five or six years."
As governor, Garamendi said he
would budget $500 million from tax
es on oil companies for building free
ways and highways. But his first
priority would be to build up mass
urban transportation.
In education, Garamendi wants to
reform state programs, like Medi-
Cal, to free up dollars which would

help revitalize the state's education
system. He hopes the state can main
tain student loans, but said this de
pends on whether Congress ap
proves President Ronald Reagan's
1983 budget proposals.
The environment is Garamendi's
stronghold. He has been a long-time
enemy of Proposition 9, which sup
ports the Peripheral Canal. Gar
amendi, who considers the project
too expensive and environmentally


John Garamendi
unsafe, said Sunday he was en
couraged by recent public opinion
surveys which indicate statewide
support for the proposition is fading.
Garamendi is also a leading ad
vocate for controls on toxic
chemicals and agricultural land pres
ervation. He was also instrumental in
saving Lake Tahoe from exploitation
through a Bi-State Compact between
California and Nevada.
Garamendi opposed offshore oil
drilling, but called Secretary of the
Interior James Watt "the best thing
that ever happened because he
made Californians aware of their en
vironment."
John Garamendi, the state Senate
majority leader from Walnut Grove,
wants to be California's next gov
ernor. In spite of public opinion polls
which indicate Los Angeles Mayor
Tom Bradley will take the Democrat
ic gubernatorial nomination on June
8, Garamendi is convinced Californi
ans have not decided who they will
vote for.

News Analysis

"The perception in the press and
among political writers is that Bradley
will win," Garamendi said at an Athe
rton fundraiser on Sunday. "But Cali
fornians are searching, looking for
the right candidate."
Garamendi believes that within the
next two weeks Californians will de
cide he is that candidate, even
though television advertising buys
are difficult with low campaign
funds. "We're not in debt, but we're
not doing anything extravagent
either," said his sister-in-law Nancy.
The Garamendi bid for California's
gubernatorial race, to replace Ed
mund "Jerry" Brown, is anything but
extravagant. In a small, private air
plane, Garamendi flys around the
state for public appearances. On

Sunday, he was met at the small air
port in Palo Alto by a staff member
and was driven to Atherton in a small
four-door car which also accom
modated his sister-in-law Nancy and
the plane's pilot.
"I can see we're entering the pov
erty belt," Garamendi said as the car
neared the site of the $25 per person
fundraiser. He was then ushered into
the study of the home for an in
terview, but first asked for a napkin to
clean his dust-covered shoes.
Appearance is part of the Gar
amendi charisma. An imposing man
with a football player's build (he let
tered in football and wrestling at UC
Berkeley), Garamendi elicited "he's
so cute" remarks from some women
in the 70-person crowd at the Athe
rton event.
And Garamendi is not without a
strong political background. At 37,
he has had a meteoric rise in politics:
he was elected to the Assembly in
1974, elected to the state Senate in
1976, re-elected in 1980 and elected
state Senate majority leader in 1981.
He holds an MBA from Harvard and
served two years in the Peace Corps
with his wife, Patti, in Ethiopia.
Garamendi bristles when asked
about fellow Democratic contender
Bradley. "After nine months of cam

paigning, I don't know the man,"
Garamendi said. "His campaign is de
signed to hide him from the public. I
don't know how he thinks or how he
approaches problems."
Last March, Garamendi personally
invited Bradley to an open debate,
but Bradley refused. Bradley's refusal
to debate frustrates Garamendi and
his campaign members. "Does the
man have something to hide?" one
member said. "Why won't he talk
about the issues?"
Garamendi's tactics, then, are to
discuss the issues, particularly three:
transportation, education and the
environment.
"(California's Transportation Di
rector) Adrianna Gianturco is a dis
aster," Garamendi said. "She has al
ienated an entire state.
"She tried to shut down freeways
and force people into mass transpor
tation causing mass transportation to
be retarded for five or six years."
