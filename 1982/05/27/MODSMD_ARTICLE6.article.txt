# Baez here in documentary on Latin America
## 
### Todd Pickett 
Human rights activist and singer
Joan Baez returned to Stanford last
night — this time in a recently re
leased documentary film of her
South American concert tour that
also sought to investigate the repres
sion of human rights in Brazil, Argen
tina and Chile.
There But For Fortune, shown to a
small crowd at Kresge Auditorium,
combined footage of Baez's concerts
with conversations and pictures of
relatives of missing persons pre
sumed kidnapped by the military
governments of those countries.
Thirty thousand Latin Americans
have been reported missing this dec
ade, according to Amnesty Interna
tional, the film said.
The film also included discussions

with human rights leaders in those
countries and politicians in Washing
ton, D.C., as well as historical footage
of the military takeovers in each of
the three countries.
"We hope the film gives a glimpse
of the reality of those living in Latin
American countries under military
rule," said Julio Moline, production
assistant at KTEH television in San
Jose and co-editor of the film. "We
hope the film will fall intothe context
of a widespread awakening." Both
Moline and the film's producer John
Chapman were present at Kresge to
introduce the film and answer ques
tions.
According to Moline, filming
Baez's tour was an afterthought. The
vision for the film came from Chap
man, who thought Baez could be the

link needed to direct American at
tention to the situation in the Latin
American countries.
"I was looking for a hook," Chap
man said. "Joan was a good vehicle
for getting at the issues."
According to Moline, much of the
film was taken with super-8 cameras,
small enough that they might not at
tract attention and bring on
censorship from thf authorities in
those countries. Indeed the tour
itself was not meant as a human rights
campaign, according to Baez.
"All I really wanted to do was sing,
and then drop in one thing (about
human rights) — maybe a song dedi
cation," she said in the film.
Nevertheless, the small entourage
met with resistance as five previously

scheduled concerts were cancelled,
a human rights meeting was bom
barded with tear gas and Baez was es
corted by two cars of officials "claim
ing to be our security," Moline said.
"The trip which had started out to
be a regular concert tour, turned into
something a thousand times more in
teresting ... and spiritually enliven
ing than I could possibly have
dreamed," Baez said in a recent in
terview.
The film included a brief interview
with Stanford Political Science Prof.
Richard Fagen, who spoke of the
methods of the military regimes.
"Anyone suspected of being with the
left would very often be brought in
for interrogation and tortured," he
said. Some, he added, were so badly
maimed they were eventually killed.
The film showed Baez returning to
Washington, D.C. after the tour and
speaking with officials, including
Rep. Robert Dornan (R-Calif.),
former ambassador to Paraguay and
El Salvador Robert White, and Rep.
Paul "Pete" McCloskey (R-Menlo
Park).
Asked in the film by KCBS radio in
San Francisco what she would do
with the information she had col
lected from her tour, Baez replied,
"Let the word out that something is
amiss in Latin America."
