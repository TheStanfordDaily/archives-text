## Polish officials burned by cross 
### Washington Post 
Warsaw, Poland — A 45-foot-long cross
of flowers in Warsaw's central Victory
Square has become a symbol of struggle
between Poland's martial-law authorities
and supporters of the suspended Solidarity
trade union.
The cross was first built unofficially a
year ago in honor of the late primate of Po
land, Cardinal Stefan Wyszynski, who died
on May 28, 1981. Laid out on the stone
pavement, midway between the Tomb of
the Unknown Soldier and the political di
rectorate of the Ministry of Defense, it is an
object of pilgrimage for thousands of Poles
every day and a source of considerable ir
ritation for the government.
Over the past month, the cross has been
destroyed on three separate occasions by
police who came in the middle of the night
to sweep away the branches, flowers and
candles. Each time, however, it has been
rebuilt within hours by groups of Warsaw
residents. With each reincarnation, the
cross seems to get more elaborate and
magnificent and draws ever larger crowds.

The self-appointed chief custodian of
the cross is a slender 54-year-old woman,
Eva Pilsudska, a distant relative of Poland's
prewar leader, Marshal Jozef Pilsudski.
The monument has become something of
an obsession for her: she spends up to 12
or 14 hours a day looking after it.
"For me it is a symbol of hope," said
Pilsudska, trying to explain why the cross
has assumed even greater significance
since the imposition of martial law last De
cember. "It is one of the few places in Po
land where you can still feel like a Pole."
A young music student, who helps
Pilsudska tend the cross, agreed that it has
become more than simply a gesture of re
spect for Wyszynski, Poland's spiritual
leader for more than three decades.
"This monument represents both the
struggle of the nation and its present
divisions," the student said as she puttered
about the cross, clipping away branches
and sticking fresh tulips and roses onto its
sides. She asked not to be named for fear
of police harassment.
Young people from nearby parishes

who have collected money for flowers to
lay on the cross frequently have their iden
tity cards checked by police.
Earlier this month, the cross was more
than once the scene of tense confronta
tion between Solidarity supporters and the
police. Groups of several hundred people
would begin singing religious hymns and
patriotic songs interspersed with slogans
like "democracy" and "freedom."
Truckloads of police, supported by water
cannon and armored personnel carriers,
circled the site.
On one occasion, a police officer told
the crowd through a bullhorn that only
those praying would be allowed to stay.
Whereupon, Pilsudska recalled, the entire
crowd knelt down by the cross and prayed.
The authorities do not seem to know
quite what to do about the cross. Techni
cally it is an illegal object. But if they were
determined to dismantle it permanently,
authorities would have to mount a 24-hour
guard and control everybody entering and
leaving the square.
