California voters will decide whether to build what
is reputed to be the largest public works project ever
in the upcoming election when they vote on
Proposition 9, which authorizes the construction of
the Peripheral Canal and a number of related water
projects.
The 43-mile Peripheral Canal would transport
water to the South around the Sacramento sSan
Joaquin Delta and it would increase the capacity for
transferring water by 1.78 million acre sfeet. Water is
presently being transported through the Delta where
it is pumped at several locations into canals that carry
it South.
Costs estimates for the entire package range from a
low of $4.3 billion projected by the legislative analyst
to a high of $19.3 billion projected by Lt. Gov. Mike
Curb's Task Force on California's Water Future.
Even if the high priced canal was going to benefit
the majority of the residents of Southern California it
would be difficult to justify this great expense given
that a fraction of the money spent on water
conservation would eliminate the need for the canal.
But the canal will not benefit the huge majority of
the residents of Southern California. The main
beneficiaries of the canal will be a handful of huge,
corporate farms in Kern County that will receive a
tremendous subsidy on additional water at the
expense of Southern Californian and California
taxpayers, who will share the exorbitant cost of the
canal.
The actual effect of the canal will be to increase the
water rates of all Southern Californian's who live in
the six-county area served by the huge Metropolitan
Water District (MWD) for extra water that they will
rarely need to use.
Already farmers in Kern County buy water leftover
from the MWD's allotment —which annually runs
substantially over its needs — at prices that are a
fraction of what the MWD pays for the water and a
fraction of what the state pays to deliver the water.
It is estimated that only in drought years, which
occur in California on the average of one out of seven
years, will the MWD actually use all the water that it
has title to.
Though the canal would be the major addition and
expense to the California Water Project in this
century, it will do nothing to alleviate what the
Director of the State Water Resources Agency,
Ronald Rohip has called the most nrpmins; water

problem facing the state: depletion of groundwater
tables. The groundwater overdraft problem is most
urgent in the San Joaquin Valley where agricultural
users have been steadily taking more water from
groundwater supplies than is annually replenished.
This trend — if it continues — could lead to the
Valley's transformation into a desert.
The extra water from the canal could be used for
this purpose but there is nothing that mandates this in
the legislation authorizing the canal. Without such a
mandate, the additional water from the canal, instead
of solving a serious water problem, will be used to
open up more land for irrigation.
The environmental impact of the canal is less clear
than other aspects of the canal. The State Department
of Fish and Wildlife argues that the canal will actually
enhance the environment of the delta by eliminating
reverse flows which result in the present water
transport system and have a detrimental effect on the
spawning of fish in the delta.
However, many environmental groups such as the
Sierra Club claim that the diversion of so much fresh
water from the delta will disrupt a fragile
environment that exists because of a precise
combination of fresh and salt water.
Futhermore, they say that the decrease in the
amount of fresh water that passes through the delta
would reduce the flushing action that it provides,
which is vital in dispersing pollutants from thebay into
the ocean.
It seems that even if the department of fish and
wildlife is correct, an easier and cheaper method for
reversing the flows could be found that does not
endanger the existence of the entire delta region as
the Peripheral Canal does.
Less expensive alternatives than the multi-billion
dollar canal, which will benefit a few corporate
farmers at the expense of the vast majority of
Southern Californias are available to meet the
increased water demand projected for Southern
California.
Beyond its high price, the canal ignores the most
important water problem facing the state and has the
potential to damage one of the most fragile
environments of the state.
For these reasons we feel it would be foolish to
build the canal and we urge you to vote against
Proposition 9 to stop its construction.
