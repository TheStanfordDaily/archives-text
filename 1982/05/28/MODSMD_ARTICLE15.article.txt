## Christian perspective on gayness 
### 
Gay Awareness Week produced
many good things. People need to
come "out of the closet" and learn to
deal with guilt and loneliness. How
ever, it saddened me to see only one
viewpoint presented: that homosex
uality is genetic and that the prob
lems and guilt that accompany it stem
solely from an intolerant society.

Although I have not
experienced a
homosexual
experience, I can
relate deeply to the
longing for
acceptance and love
that leads a person to
seek a romantic
relationship.

Before I proceed, I would like to
say that the purpose of this letter is
not to condemn people or display a
"holier than thou" attitude, but to
present a different viewpoint.
Although I have not experienced a

homosexual relationship, I can relate
deeply to the longing for acceptance
and love that leads a person to seek a
romantic relationship. All of us desire
to be cared for and needed by some
one else.
I can also empathize with feelings
of guilt that gays (especially closet
gays) experience. However, I do not
believe that feelings of guilt felt by
gays result simply from society's non
acceptance.
God created masculinity and
femininity to complement each oth
er. The marriage relationship, as God
designed it, requires both sexes. Cer
tainly, it may be easier to identify
with the sexuality of a person of like
gender; but when a man and woman
work to relate with the other's com
pletely different sexual attitudes and
feelings, a oneness results — a one
ness that is impossible without both
sexes. The beauty of this partnership
is worth the effort.
A homosexual struggles with guilt
because he goes against the design of
his Creator. Yet every person has de
parted from his Maker's design
through pride, selfishness, unloving
attitudes and the list continues. We
are all imperfect. The exciting thing
to me is that no matter whether we
struggle with homosexuality, anger,

or an inability to love someone, God
reaches out to help us.
When we come to God, He imparts
the power to live a changed life and
realigns our imperfections with His
design for a fulfilling, giving and ex
citing life. We are powerless to
change without Him.
Homosexuality is not genetic;
neither is an inability to love some
one who irritates you. God desires
for us to be free from guilt and free to
enjoy life to its fullest.
