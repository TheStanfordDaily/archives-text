# Handgun control unjust
## 
### 
The recent editorial (Daily, May 26)
on handgun control reeks of the
platitudes and disregard for justice
with which this whole issue is
fraught. Will they next put on the
ballot an initiative to ban automo
biles because of the needless deaths
they cause when people have acci
dents or drive them while drunk or
enraged? Will we have a black market
of cars with stiffer penalties for own
ing one than for robbery, rape, or
murder?
But, of course, there's a difference
between cars and guns. As the Daily
points out, guns are bought by law
abiding citizens as "insurance — just
in case someone threatens the owner
or his property." True enough, and
what does the Daily offer as a sub
stitute for this insurance? The po
lice?, the courts?
Luckily, I have always lived in an
area of relatively little crime, but at
least once, I was robbed.
Furthermore, I found my property
locked in a car that I had seen leaving
the scene of the crime. Like a good
citizen, I called the police, repeated
ly. They said they were shorthanded.
My friends and I wound up detaining
the thief while the police took an
hour to arrive. When they did get
there, the thief spun a tale about how
he had found the goods, probably
stolen by someone else, and had in

tended to return them to the owner.
The police advised me to settle for
getting my property back and hope
that the thief did not sue me for il
legal detainment. This is justice?
Now I wouldn'tbuyagunoverthat
incident, nor would I have used one.
I bring it up to point out the ineffi
ciency of law enforcement which

I bring it up to point
out the inefficiency of
law enforcement
which sometimes
forces one to act in
self-defense, and to
bring up the injustice
under the law.

under the law which made me more
in danger of prosecution than the
thief! When would I use a gun? If
someone were being raped, I would
not hesitate. If someone dear to me
were being physically at
tacked ... And, would I wait an
hour for the police to get there?
Hardly. I would do something, even
if I didn't have a gun.
A few years ago, in the Bay area, a
prisoner was released who had
threatened to molest and kill a child
in his neighborhood if he were freed.

He carried out his threat on a five
year-old boy, whose parents then
unsuccessfully, futilely sued the par
ole board. Charles Manson is up for
parole again soon. Juan Corona will
be given a second trial. Is there any
finality to the law, even where the of
fense is unspeakably horrible? Is this
the insurance against attack that the
courts offer? Any wonder that those
who live in high-crime areas feel
threatened and seek self-protection?
But the Daily wants to jail these inno
cent citizens in spite of the
"philosophical unfairness of this
scenario." That's the Daily's under
statement of the year.
If you want to stop the needless ac
cidental deaths by handguns, you
must eliminate the need for a peace
ful and law-abiding citizen to have
one. You can legalize drugs and oth
er victimless crimes in order to
eliminate the black markets that
foster organized crime, that keeps
the police force undermanned and
overworked. This would, hopefully,
free up police, courts and jails for the
punishment of real crime. Then, you
can put some finality in the law, some
teeth in it so that justice is at least pos
sible. Most people would then not
purchase handguns since the dan
gers of owning one would outweigh
the possible insurance benefits.
The 64 percent of Californians who
purportedly favor hand-gun controls
have not thought about how they will
feel when they go to jail while their
attacker goes free.
