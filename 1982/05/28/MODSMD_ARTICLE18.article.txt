## Coalitions work better for today's activists 
### 
Jeffrey Golden, apparently miffed
that his earlier columns — well writ
ten, tightly reasoned ones — hadn't
evoked a campus-wide reaction, de
cided to attack as insincere the anti
nuclear movement with his May 26
column. His choice of victim seems
to be based on envy; the peace
movement has gotten more press
coverage than, say, Disorientation
Week or Hooverville/Reaganville,
Golden's favored activities.
According to Golden's stere
otyping, anti-nuclear activists care

only about what they can "get out of
disarmament," are totally unin
formed about other political issues,
and are greedy to boot. This con
trasts, of course, with Golden and his
fellow "New Left students of yester
year," who were "idealistic" and
"giving."
The peace movement certainly
needs to incorporate some serious
political analysis — and there are
people within the movement work
ing on this — but this criticism was no
less true for the student protestors of

the '60s. (See, for example, Michael
Albert's What Is To Be Undone.)
Reading Golden's diatribe, however,
we would infer that all '60s activists
were brilliant political scholars who,
embittered, exist now on the margins
of American society ... as opposed
to today's "radical chic" peace ac
tivists, who spend most of their time
"flying up the corporate ladder."
It is certainly discouraging to see
Golden let pique get in the way of
reason. He recognizes fundamental
structural problems with the U.S. po

litical economy — uncontrolled re
source exploitation; militarization of
the economy and society; reliance
upon docile Third World countries to
provide markets and cheap labor —
but missed an essential truth:
changes in the political economy re
quire popular movements by coali
tions and coalitions mean com
promises. No vanguard — not his,
not mine — is going to rise up and
sweep away the ancien regime.
