## History professor Freedman deserves tenure 
### 
There are many students, teachers,
scholars and otherwise concerned
individuals who are acquainted and
familiar with the scholarly reputa
tion, the academic competence and
professional capabilities of Assistant
Professor Estelle Freedman, and are
intimately concerned with the con
tinued excellence and rigor of the
faculty of Stanford University.
We feel that Estelle Freedman is as
demanding and instructive a pro
fessor as the majority of tenured fac
ulty members within the Department
of History. She has been officially
recognized by this University on two
separate occasions for her outstand
ing commitment to undergraduate
education and her first book-length
publication has been recognized as
the probable standard-bearer in its
field for many years to come. Her
current research is supported by the
National Endowment forthe Human
ities.
In spite of the aforementioned
achievements, the Stanford Univer
sity Appointments and Promotions
Committee has unaccountably de
nied Professor Freedman the
tenured position she has so clearly
presumed, not only to disregard the
measured supportive opinion of the
History Graduate Student Associa
tion, but also to overturn the favor
able decision of the History Depart
ment Faculty.

By the aforementioned denial the
Appointments and Promotions Com
mittee has neglected its responsi
bility to provide for the furtherance
of outstanding scholarship and in
struction at Stanford University.
An immediate reversal of the Com
mittee's decision to extend to Pro
fessor Freedman the rights and ob
ligations accruing to a tenured mem
ber of the University faculty is neces
sary. This will restore a measure of
confidence in this University's com
mitment to liberal education.

Special Olympics thanks
On behalf of the Stanford Special
Olympics Committee I would like to
thank the Stanford community for
their support and involvement in the
May 22 swim meet at DeGuerre. With
some 240 disabled

athletes, this was the largest swim
meet in Santa Clara County history
(and probably the largest Special
Olympics swim meet in California).
Many folks who have been involved
with Special Olympics for years
claimed that this was also one of the
best events ever — the atmosphere
provided by entertainment, T-shirts,
medals, etc. was noted as particularly
festive and enjoyable. Of course,
none of that would have been pos
sible without your contributions of
funds and services.
I would also like to give special
thanks to those community members
who were involved on the day of the
event as athletes and volunteers. We
received numerous compliments on
the resourceful, caring attitudes of
chaperones and volunteer helpers
(deflating the image of self-centered
Stanford students). No amount of or
ganizing would make the meet suc
cessful without your time and energy
there at DeGuerre. As for athletes —
your joy and appreciation make it all
worthwhile.
Finally, I want to express my
warmest gratitude to the organizing
committee. As a member of the Stan
ford community, I thank you for your
incredible efforts — regardless of
such nagging demands as midterms,
MCATs and social obligations — in
giving me the chance to be involved
with Special Olympics here on cam
pus. As an organizer myself, I could

always count on your support, no
matter how frustrating or time
pressed the task. I thank you for mak
ing this event happen and for making
is so festive that the Special Olympics
Swim Meet will be a permanent, an
nual part of the Stanford community.

Coming out in Osh Kosh
The May 12,1982 issue of The Stan
ford Daily included an article by
Stuart Reges, entitled "On Being
Gay: heelings and Perceptions." In
his article Reges wrote, "Every year
we import a new batch of fresh mis
conceptions and stereotypes from
Grand Rapids, Michigan, and Osh
Kosh (sic), Wisconsin, and God
knows where else."
It is ironic that one ostensibly so
concerned with the evils of stere
otyping so easily generalizes about
the populace of Grand Rapids and
Oshkosh. At least he should have had
enough consistency to espouse his
bigotry in a sentence separate from
that containing his condemnation of
stereotypes.

zen.
