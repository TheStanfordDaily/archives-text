# Faculty senate accepts proposal to split ODUS
## 
### Jeff Biddulph 
The Faculty Senate last night ac
cepted virtually without complaint a
committee proposal to split the
duties of the Dean of Undergraduate
Studies between two new adminis
trators, despite English Prof. Ron
Rebholz's description of the pro
posal as "shocking."
In a related move, Provost Albert
Hastorf announced that present
Dean of Undergraduate Studies
Herant Katchadourian has decided
to remain as Vice Provost, thereby
keeping some of his old duties. An
Assistant Dean of Humanities and
Sciences (H & S), yet unnamed, will
take on the rest of Katchadourian's
tasks.
The senate, though it had no au
thority to take action on the pro
posal, had the opportunity to express
opinions of the report during a short

question-and-answerperiod with
Hastorf. Rebholz was the only sena
tor to question the report, which will
disperse the duties of the Office of
the Dean of Undergraduate Studies
(ODUS) when it takes effect next
year.
"I think that the proposal is a
shocking document and I question
its constitutionality," he said.
Rebholz said that the senate
should have decided on the changes,
not the provost's office, which coor
dinated the proposal. Hastorf replied
that the provost is responsible for an
effective administrative structure
and that the split will improve the ef
fectiveness of the University.
Rebholz also listed complaints in
four major areas:
•whether the post of the newly
created Assistant Dean of H & S will
be truly a half-time job, as the report

mandates. Rebholz suggested that
the Vice Provost will "have virtually
nothing to do" in comparison to the
Assistant Dean of H & S.
•whether the incoming assistant
dean who will appoint people to the
policy boards of extra-departmental
programs, such as SWOPSI and
SCIRE, might be unsympathetic to
the programs. The policy boards de
termine whether classes taught are
appropriate. Katchadourian present
ly appoints these members and
Rebholz is afraid that the new assis
tant dean will consider SWOPSI and
SCIRE competitiors with departmen
tal programs.
•whether the present advising sys
tem would be improved by the
changes in ODUS, as has been sug
gested.
•whether the change will save
money as Hastorf asserts. Hastorf has

said that the split will eliminate the
jobs of two assistant deans, but
Rebholz countered that the new As
sistant Dean of H & S will have a full
secretarial staff.
Hastorf answered Rebholz's ques
tion about the workload of the Assis
tant Dean of H & S by sayingthat oth
er people in the department will help
the dean if needed.
Katchadourian responded to
Rebholz's fears regarding extra-de
partmental programs by asserting
that the faculty will expect these pro
grams to compete with departmental
programs just as departments com
pete with each other.
"We don't expect these programs
to be absorbed by the (H & S) depart
ment, " Katchadourian said.
Rf>)holz said that his real fear is

that fewer programs will be ap
proved by the policy boards because
H & S fears decreasing enrollments
in its classes. The shift of responsi
bilities from ODUS to H & S which
will result from the split of duties is
"like letting the cat guard the canary
cage," according to Rebholz.
Dean of H & S Norman Wessells
agreed with Rebholz that the alter
ation of ODUS would not improve
the advising system.
"I look to all of these changes with
enthusiasm except for the advising
system," Wessells said. "I don't see
any improvement in advising."
Despite Rebholz's reservations
about the program, Anthropology
Prof. James Gibbs said that the pro
posal was "not a precipitous act, and
not badly thought through."
