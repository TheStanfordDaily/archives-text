## Tulsa running away in NCAA golf; Stanford still in second place 
### Mark Zeigler 
Barring a nuclear disaster,
Tulsa will win the first ever
NCAA Women's Golf Cham
pionships held here at Stanford
Golf Course.
After the second round, the
Golden Hurricane has taken a
commanding 20 stroke lead.
Now the race is on for second.
Stanford is knotted with Flor
ida and Texas Christian at 612 in
the battle for second place
honors. On their heals is Okla
homa State at 613.
Tulsa's Jody Rosenthal has a
one-shot advantage over
Southern Methodist's Amy
Benz in the individual com
petiton. Rosenthal fired an
even-par 73 yesterday and a 72
Wednesday to give her 145,
while Benz has been a model of
consistency through the first
half of the tournament with a
pair on 735.
Joanne Pacillo paced the
Cardinal with a 76 yesterday, a
score that could have been
lower had a few birdie putts hit
home. Lori Castillo, who
shared the individual lead after
the first round, dropped to
tenth place after a 79. Both
"illo's" have 150s, five shots be
hind leader Rosenthal.
"It's going to be difficult
making up 20 shots," Pacillo
said. "For all practical purposes

it's over. But you never know."
The Card junior, however,
pointed out that Stanford
made a 13 stroke comeback last
season at the USIA Invitational
in one day.
Debbie Barberio finished
yesterday's round with a 78,
while Kathy Nino covered the
18 holes in 82 strokes.
Freshman Diane Nixon, who
had a hole-in-one a day earlier,
checked in at 86.
The highlight of the day was
when Val Skinner and Lauri
Rinker tied the course record
with four under par 695. Okla
homa State's Skinner had five
birdies and an eagle. After
missing a bird putt on the 17th,
she canned a 30-footer on 18
for an eagle three.
"I finally got a knack for it,"
Skinner said, remembering her
near disasterous first round 79.
"The first day was a matter of
nerves. Yesterday (Wednes
day) really made me mad.
"I should have shot a 67 to
day," she continued. Skinner is
not alone when she says that
the course record will fall dur
ing the tourney.
Winds were not as much a
factor yesterday as they were
Wednesday. Although the
wind kicked up in the morning,
it subsided in the afternoon,
with just a few gusts bothering

players teeing off after 12.
All told, four Tulsa golfers
were in the top 13 individuals
after round two. Number four
player Kathy Baker was tied for
fourth at 148 (73-75) with
Skinner, Texas A & M's Shirley
Furlong and New Mexico's
Theresa Schreck.
Hurricane linkster Barb
Thomas shared the eighth posi
tion with first round co-leader
Kelly Skalicky of LSU. Tied for
tenth with Cards Castillo and
Pacillo was Dee Dee Lasker, yet
another Tulsa golfer.
Lauri Merten-Peterson was
alone in third place behind a
three under round of 70. The
Arizona State golfer fired a 77
Wednesday.

In eighth place, was Texas A
& M, followed by Arizona State
(619), USC (620) and SMU (621).
Number one seed New Mexico
fell well off the pace after a
calamitous 322 team score yes
terday. Only one Lobo golfer,
Schreck, was able to break 80.
San Jose State has been vic
timized by the Stanford course
as well. Besides Julie Inkster's
77, the Spartans were forced to
count an 80, 82 and 83, giving
them a second round 322 and a
637 total at the half way mark.
Texas A & M was the only
team to have all five of its
golfers score in the 70s yester
day. Texas Christian achieved
that feat Wednesday.
