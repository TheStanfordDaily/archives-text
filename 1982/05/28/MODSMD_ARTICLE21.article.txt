## 
### Associated Press 
Philadelphia — The Los An
geles Lakers turned on their of
fensive power in a 40-9 second
half explosion Thursday night,
just as they did in their eight
previous playoff victories, to
win the opener of the NBA
championship series over the
Philadelphia 76ers.
The 124-117 triumph, with
Jamaal Wilkes getting 16 of his
24 points in the third quarter,
was the ninth straight National
Basketball Association playoff
victory for the Lakers, a record
for one season.
"We're a team of spurts,"
said Lakers Coach Pat Riley.
"We've proven that in the sea
son and the playoffs. Some
where, we'll have runs. Skir
mishes win games, and we won
the third-period skirmish"
The second game of the

best-of-seven final series will
be Sunday afternoon in Phila
delphia.
"Riley told us at halftime,
'You've got to be more ag
gressive,"' said Wilkes. "I think
after that we went out and
were able to make a better ef
fort.
"It looked for a while like
they were going to blow us out.
What keyed the comeback was
pride and character."
Referring to the Lakers' road
victory, Wilkes said, "If this
were tennis, you could say we
broke their service."
The Lakers, who have shot
better than 50 percent in each
of their nine postseason vic
tories, hit only 35 percent in the
second quarter and were still
behind by 15 points midway
through the third period. But

that's when they started the
40-9 streak that lasted until
there were only 7Vj minutes
left in the game.
"We played well for 2Vi
quarters," said 76ers Coach Bil
ly Cunningham. "They limited
us to one shot and were able to
run and get the transition game
going. But I'm confident we'll
be back."
Norm Nixon also scored 24
points for the Lakers, while
Kareem Abdul-Jabbar added
23 to give him 100 20-plus
point games in 105 playoff
games during his 13-year ca
reer. Michael Cooper scored
17 points for Los Angeles.
Julius Erving led all scorers
with 27 points for the 76ers,
most of them on dunks or
layups. Andrew Toney scored
20 points, Bobby Jones 19 and

Darryl Dawkinsl6forthe76ers.
The Lakers, who averaged
118 points per game in two
tour-game sweeps over Phoe
nix and San Antonio, fell be
hind 83-68 in the third period
when Jones scored for Phila
delphia at the 5:58 mark.
Then the Lakers scored 11
points in a row to start a 23-6
run for the rest of the period,
which ended with the Lakers
ahead 91-89.
Philadelphia's miseries did
not end there, however, as the
Lakers poured in 14 of the first
15 points of the fourth quarter
for a 105-90 lead with 8:45 re
maining in the game.
The 40-9 spurt was com
pleted when Cooper hit a free
throw with 7:35 left to give the
Lakers their largest lead,
108-92.
