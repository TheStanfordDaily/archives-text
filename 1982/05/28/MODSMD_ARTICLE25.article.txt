What differentiates Flo Mo from all the other
University food services? It's more than the
croutons, the carpeted dining area and the
calorie chart posted for the conscientous con
sumer. It's the eternal ice cream, guaranteed
twice daily by the famous specification in Flor
ence Moores' will.
Flo Mo dining is a bit more elegant than
Wilbur, but still doesn't require formal attire. A
flower display enhances the service line and dim
lighting serves the dual purpose of energy con
servation and romance. A deluxe germ-free
salad table (see picture) included other added
touches such as a finely wallpapered box of
spices and special sauces, various salad trim
mings and a butter conoisseur's delight: a dish of
whipped butter (almost too good to cut into)

along with a hefty supply of butter pats.
We chose as our entrees the breaded veal (a
little tough), eggplant casserole (very tasty with
tomatoes, mushrooms and cheese — an exam
ple of food service's considerations for the vege
tarian diner) and seafood crepes (not our favor
ites). Rice (a bit limp and soggy) and dinner rolls
provided the traditional food service starch.
Circular tables offered an intimate dining ar
rangement with a picturesque view of the sur
rounding Florence Moore residences. We
found the ambiance clean, but not sterile, effi
cient, but not institutional. We even spotted
ashtrays on each table center doiley but won
dered about their purpose (were we in the
smoking section?).
Our one suggestion for capital improvements
— invest in larger ice cream bowls.
