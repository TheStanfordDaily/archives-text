Columbae
549 Lasuen
Price: $200 per quarter
321-8868
Homemade yogurt, tofu and
granola. . .no, it's not a descrip
tion of the football training
table. Rather, all are daily fare
at Columbae, the social change
through non-violence theme
house. More than 40 live-ins,
15 eating associatesand various
strays (put your money in the
kitty) participate in communal
baking and dining.
Vegetarian meals are pre
pared every night but Saturday
by collective groups of eight.
These groups must work within
the confines of no refined sug
ar or white flour, but they do
have an elaborate array of
fruits, cheeses and assorted
grains from which to choose.
On our night, we received a
meal concocted by senior Lisa
Jacobson, an avowed carnivor,
and Company. Jacobson's
group, well-known for ad
vanced menu planning —
many groups are notorious for
the Five-Minute Plan — pre
pared an exotic five or six
course dinner (depending if
you count sugarless cake as
bread or dessert).
We began our journey down
the long buffet table. On dis
play were stuffed tomatoes,

broccoli apple noodle kugel (a
Jewish specialty), salad bar with
spinach ("leaf" it alone), a
guacamole dressing,
mushrooms, onions, cheese,
tofu (slightly dry for our tastes),
and a vegetable soup. We took
our overflowing plates and
joined the rest of the Colum
bae diners on the front porch
with a fine view of the Sigma
Chi House. Columbae opts for
no tables or chairs to create a
relaxed, open atmosphere
conducive to either small or
large group conversation. In
deed, Columbae residents
warmly welcomed us and
made us feel at home.
In sum, Columbae's dist
inguising features are its warm
company, informal at
mosphere, and convenient lo

cation. (And girls, no need to
exert willpower avoiding ice
cream and sweets — you won't
find them here!)
