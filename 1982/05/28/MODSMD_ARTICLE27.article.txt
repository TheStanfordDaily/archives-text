La Casa Italiana
562 Mayfield Ave.

The Italian House is well-known for offering
some of the best — and most fattening — food
on campus. But it's worth every calorie.
Native Italian cook Maria Catena has served
pasta twice daily since the Italian House opened
six years ago. Although the dishes vary, the
house offers a constant supply of fresh
sourdough bread, wine and lettuce salad with oil
and vinegar dressing. And, like at Flo Mo, ice
cream tempts daily.
A unique feature, food brought to your table,
gives a more homey, less institutional at
mosphere. White walls, carpet, oak tables and

chairs and large open windows lend a simple,
clean touch to the dining area.
We were surprised when told that our meal —
spaghetti and fish — was less exotic than Maria's
usual culinary delights. But upon hearing of
Maria's spaghetti alia carbonara, we are looking
forward to further exploring the world of pasta.
Unfortunately, because of our lack of Italian
know-how, we can't do it regularly — both the
12 eating associates and 46 residents must have
some Italian background.
Residents transform the dining area into the
popular La Pizzeria every Saturday night. Al
though Maria has the night off, the house mem
bers welcome anyone to sample a taste of Italy
for less than $5.
