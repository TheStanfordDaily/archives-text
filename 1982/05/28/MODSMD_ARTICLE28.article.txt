Wilbur Sunday Brunch — the
Holiday Inn of Stanford minus
the champagne and $7.50.
Conveniently located in the
heart of the University's largest
living complex, Wilbur dining
hall offers over five different
brunch entrees, a salad bar and
a wide variety of fruits and
juices to all possessing A or B
meal plans.
No need to make reserva
tions here — we were admitted
immediately to the left serving
aisle, and were promptly
greeted by a friendly hasher.
After careful deliberation,
we selected an Egg Puff portion
and a half-wedge of French
Toast. We complemented our
entrees ("you're tasty!") with a
warmed bagel and a sausage.
The sausage was slightly fatty,
but the bagel ranked with the
best back east.
Before approaching the
salad bar, we eyed the extra
serving line touches — a "Meet
the Cooks" board, hanging
plants and other art work
adorning the walls offered ten
sion release from the difficult
selection process.
Entering the inside dining

area, we discovered an ex
tensive salad bar featuring two
heated syrups (maple and
blueberry), crisp raw vegeta
bles, cream and cottage
cheeses, a bowl of fruit salad
and whipped butter (a food
service specialty).
We were especially im
pressed by a silver decanter of
piping hot chocolate accom
panied by fresh miniature
marshmallows — a Girl Scout's
dream!
After choosing our side dish
es, we decided to take advan
tage of the outdoor seating
(Not even the Holiday Inn of
fers this option). But beware
those of you wearing white —
the picnic tables are slightly
soiled.
So, what makes Wilbur
unique besides the fact that it is
named after the University's il
lustrious third president? Why,
its tropical outdoor at
mosphere (no plastic plants!),
young crowd, casual ambiance
(no dress code), and all-you
can-eat policy.
All patrons are required to
bus their dishes ... but it's a
small price to pay. Meal card
bearers should journey over to
Wilbur between 9 a.m. and
11:30 next Sunday.
