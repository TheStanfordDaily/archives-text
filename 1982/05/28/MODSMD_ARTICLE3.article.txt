# Bike safety project to be installed in summer
## 
### Bill Ainsworth 
The sometimes hazardous ordeal
students go through when traveling
to class may be made safer by an ex
perimental project that will desig
nate bicycle lanes in certain areas of
campus.
The project, scheduled for con
struction over the summer, will con
sist of striped bicycle lanes and signs
to alert bicyclists to particularly dan
gerous intersections, according to
campus planner Max Mazenko.
The idea behind the striped bicycle
lanes, Mazenko said, is to separate
bicycle traffic from pedestrian traffic
and thus reduce the amount of bi
cycle accidents.
Mazenko compared the current
situation bicyclists face when riding a
bike down White Plaza oraround the
Quad during peak hours, tothat of "a
slalomist going through crowds of
people."
The project was developed as a re
sult of recommendations made in a
study compiled by the Bicycle Safey
Committee. Based on a survey com
pleted during the first week of winter
quarter, the study listed traffic vol
umes, bicycle accidents and peak
traffic periods and it identified high
conflict areas.

According to the survey, the
busiest intersection on campus is be
tween the Career Planning and
Placement Center and Engineering
Corner in the Quad.
The bicycle lanes will be con
structed along Lasuen Mall (adjacent
to the Quad) from Serra Street past
Engineering Corner to White Plaza
and around Tresidder Parking Lot,
Mazenko said. The route of the bike
lanes purposely skirts the area be
tween Tresidder and the White Plaza
crafts booths because of the dangers
of having bicyclists ride through that
area, Mazenko said, adding that a no
bike-riding restriction has been des
ignated for the area.
The bicycle lanes, which will range
in size from five to eight feet wide,
will be accompanied by "Yield" and
"Caution" signs that will be placed in
busy intersections along the mall.
Other information regarding basic
safety rules will be painted in the bike
lanes.
Construction costs for the project
are less than $5000, Mazenko said.
But the total costs, including time
spent on the project by University
employees, should range from $7000
to $8000, he added.
The effectiveness of the project
will be evaluated this fall and it will
then be decided whether to expand
the project to include the entire cam
pus, Mazenko said.
