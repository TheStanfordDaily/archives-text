How many cooks on campus
prepare delicacies such as
shrimp-stuffed trout and
spinach-mushroom quiche
while listening to Bruce Spring
steen and wearing Levi 501's?
Norwegian born, bred and
trained Alpha Sigma Phi cook,
Helge Ternsten, is the only one
we know of (but we're open to
rebuttal letters).
In addition to being one of
the original cooks when the
Gatehouse opened in July,
1975, Helge attended two years
of chef and restaurant school in
Norway and served four-and
one-half years as a chef in the
Norwegian Merchant Marine.
His travels took him all the way
to Stanford where he spent
one- and-a-half years cooking
with Tresidder Union before
coming to Alpha Sig in 1979.
House consensus confirms
that the kitchen is the social
center of Alpha Sig, and the
credit goes to Helge. But even
with the heavy congregation,
the kitchen must always pass
Helge's white glove test. Bring
your moms here.
Helge hasestablished several
long-standing traditions at
Alpha Sig such as multi-layered
fruit and pudding-filled birth
day cakes for each house mem
ber's birthday dinner (house
members are known to give
out false information regarding
date of birth). Another favorite
of both the house and Helge is
the annual luau tomorrow fea
turing roast pig and tropical
fruits.
Except when Springsteen is
on the west coast, Helge arrives
at 6:30 a.m. Monday through
Friday to cook short-order
breakfast for the house. Helge
described breakfast as his fa
vorite time because he's closest
to house members. "I get an
immediate response to what
I'm doing," he said.
Bruce Springsteen's theme
song may be "Born to
Run"...but Helge's is "Born to
Cook."
