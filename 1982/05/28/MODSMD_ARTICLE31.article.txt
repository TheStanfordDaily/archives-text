# EDNA Her secrets revealed

"A day without Edna is like a
day without sunshine." No, it's
not Anita Bryant but the resi
dents of Delta Upsilon fraterni
ty giving a singing description
of their beloved cook Edna.
After only one quarter in a
new kitchen location, Edna — a
12-year veteran of the Zeta Psi
fraternity kitchen — has won
the hearts and vocal cords of
her 45 new surrogate sons. (As
we sipped Edna's cold
raspberry drink, we listened to
a rousing DU-produced chorus
of "Edna, Edna, she's the
greatest cook around!")
Edna described her secret
special seasoning — beer. But
she emphasized that the beer is
not in the food but in her
"tummy."
Although Edna is casual
about trying new dishes ("you
win some you lose some"), her
track record is virtually un
tarnished (except for last
week's pineapple cake which

Edna modestly described as a
disaster).
Edna follows a seasonally ad
justed menu which she plans
out a year in advance. She fre
quently includesall-time favor
ites such as roast beef and
french dip and occasionally
throws in specialty items in
cluding barbecue spare ribs
(last night's extravaganza).
"We dine here, we don't
eat," Edna said.
Edna's gastronomic tome,
Have Book Will Cook, remains
unpublished despite popular
demand. But she does divulge
her secrets upon request. And
here it is, the recipe for Edna's
Chocolate Chip Cookies. (Edna
usually doubles the recipe.)
Note: Edna specifies that
cookies be differentiated by
sex (boy cookies have nuts).
