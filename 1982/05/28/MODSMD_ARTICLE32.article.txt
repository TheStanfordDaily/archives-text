## Anticlimax fails to bring out the beast of the ballet 
### Katie Smith 
Beauty and the Beast
San Francisco Ballet

"Everything is beautiful at the ballet..ac
cording to Chorus Line sources. Sometimes ev
erything is well-danced and well-acted at the
ballet too. Sometimes. Unfortunately the San
Francisco Ballet's revival of Beauty and the Beast
succeeded only half-way in the latter two cate
gories.
The sad truth is that the Beast (Jim Sohm) was
far more appealing than Prince Charming. After
the animal's fur-tearing transformation at the
beginning of Act II courtly life got pretty dull.
Granted it is hard to top the excitement of
metamorphosis, but either a believable ro
mance between Beauty (Diana Weber) and her
prince, or choreography befitting the vibrant
costumes of the courtiers might have sustained
the energy level to the end. Neither denoue
ment was effected. Instead, the lovers united in a
rather aloof pas-de-deux and choreo
grapher/director Lew Christensen marked off
the remaining count primarily with bows,
curtsies and other soporific movements.
No doubt, the lethargy of Act II to was indexed
by the stimulation of the opening scenes. The
story, adapted from the 18th century tale by
Madame le Prince de Beaumont and set to selec
tions by Tchaikovsky, has great potential for an
exciting mixture of dance mood and technique.
It tells of a young girl, Beauty, who wanders into
the domain of the Beast, is captured, then
courted royally. Terrified by the creature's atten
tions, Beauty f lees to the home of her father and
two jealous sisters, leaving her lovesick admirer
to die of a 'broken heart.' Then, receiving news
of the Beast's death from forest Stags, Beauty
goes to his funeral bier and kneeling, realizes
her love for him. A farewell kiss restores him to
life and his true princely nature. The whole
Kingdom celebrates and the court rejoices at the
lovers' wedding.
Act I, where Beauty first meets and rejects the
Beast, was dynamic on all three counts of dance,
drama, and costuming. The fur-clad Stags and
Simians each performed athletic dances which

departed excitingly from the norm of pliees and
pirouettes. The dance of the Simians featuring
the show's most notable dancer, Andres Reyes,
smacked of gymnastics with high leaps, splits
and pouncing movements, while the Stags
moved with truly "deer-like" extensions.
The slower paced dances of the first act were
equally arresting in their innovation and execu
tion. The movement in the dance of the Magic
Flowers, (featuring Gina Ness) succeeded in giv
ing both the illusion of height and of reed-like
flexibily as the dancers grew and blossomed in
floral waves. Above all, in terms of excellence,
was the tension between Beauty and the Beast
which neared tangibility. Their dramatic pas de
deux at the close of the act convincingly con
veyed the emotional interfacing of the Beast's
despairing love and Beauty's fear and revulsion.
Act II also began with promise. Beauty's return
to her home provided a refreshing variation in
mood and scenery. The charm of the forest
nestled cottage and the humorous antics of
Beauty's jealous sisters combined for a light
hearted resumption of the plot. The next scene,
equally effective, contrasted sharply as Beauty
arrived at a sombre funeral procession which
was transporting the Beast's body through
murky woods.

Then, with Beauty's sorrowful kiss, amid swell
ing orchestral strains, the Beast rose up and the
show truly climaxed. To the rumbling of
Tchaikovsky's "The Storm," with slow dramatic
movements the animal began to tear away
clumps of his hairy exterior, gradually revealing
a muscular white-tighted and, yes, shining
prince. Perhaps, the intensity of the trans
formation dictated an anti-climax. At any rate,
the excitement caused by the resurrection was
matched only by my disappointment in the
prince's ensuing rapport with Beauty and the
"Kingdom's" apathetic rejoicing via half an hour
of unimaginative court dances.
The only saving graces of the show's latter por
tion were the costuming and scenery designed
by jose Varon, elements of the production
which remained exceptional throughout its en
tire duration.
