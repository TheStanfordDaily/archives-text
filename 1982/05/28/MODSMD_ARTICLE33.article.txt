# 'Moonchildren' lights up Nitery
## 
### Mike Hale 
Too many directors force
student actors to spend their
time stretching for effects
they're incapable of and trying
to bring to life characters
whose lives they can't possibly
imagine. Steve Vineberg, di
rector of the drama depart
ment's production of Michael
Welter's Moonchildren, has
chosen and staged his play with
his actors in mind; the result is
a warm, engrossing show with
few of the lapses campus pro
ductions are so prone to.
Moonchildren is an ideal
choice for college actors be
cause all of the main characters
are college students; there are
eight of them, ail of whom live
together off the campus of an
unnamed Eastern school. The
play takes place entirely inside
their apartment, and follows
them from just before Christ
mas of their senior years to just
before graduation.
The years in question are
1965 and 1966; the topics of
conversation in the apartment

are the Vietnam War, the draft,
protest marches, "pigs."
(Vineberg had his audience in
mind, too.) Lydia Romero's set
in The Nitery is covered with
period memorabilia: posters of
The Beatles, Chaplin and
Bogart, Martin Luther King; a
Yahtzee game; Dylan albums.
I'm sure the books in the book
case were all carefully selected
(Civilization and Its Discon
tents is the only identifiable
volume). But the play isn't real
ly about the '60s — it's about
young people who happen to
be coming of age at that time,
and the various ways in which
they manage to avoid thinking
about the future.
Mike and Cootie (Andre
Braugher and Orlando Ward)
have evolved the most
elaborate method, and they
provide many of this produc
tion's best moments. They're a
pair of consummate put-on ar
tists, never at a loss for a fan
tastic comeback, and Braugher
and Ward construct their wild
tales with perfect timing.

Weller makes them go into
their act a few too many times,
perhaps, but they're so funny
each time it doesn't really mat
ter.
Christine Roum plays Shelly,
a flower child who shows up
halfway through the play, and
steals every scene she's in. I im
agine looking dippy is harder
than it looks, and Shelly is
probably the hardest part in
the play to pull off; Roum suf
fers not a single false moment.
There's a curious consistency
to the characters in Moon
children — some a«-e always
funny, some are always serious,
some are always pathetic.
When Mike and Cootie in
dulge in one of their rare seri
ous moments, it jars us. On the
other hand, there are Bob and
Kathy. The play is largely the
story of their relationship, and
Bob emerges as the major char
acter at the end; unfortunately,
neither is allowed a single
light-hearted moment. Weller
can't really believe that college
students are ever this glum for

this long; the play goes under a
cloud whenever Boband Kathy
are on stage. Sean Laughlin
does a perfectly competent job
as Bob, and Parthenia Rath is
technically excellent as Kathy,
but neither manages to
brighten the pall that seems to
hang over these characters; I
don't know if anyone could.
There are no soft spots in the
cast — Lisa Jacobson, Marc
Gimbrere and Richard But
terfield are less memorable
only because their parts aren't
as vividly written as Mike and
Mel and Shelly's. Perhaps the
most amazing thing about this
production is that Vineberg
gathered such an ac
complished cast in a quarter lit
tered with campus shows, in
cluding a major drama depart
ment production of King Lear
which drew most of the depart
ment's experienced actors.
Moonchildren plays through
Sunday in The Nitery; people
have been turned away both
nights so far.
