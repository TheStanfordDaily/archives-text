'We made funny pictures
as fast as we coula for
money/
— Mack Sennett

M*A*S*H
Tonight, Cubbertey
Robert Altman (Nashville)
directed this terrifilanti-war war
comedy. Biood — from casualties
of the Korean war, mostly —
splatters the walls of the opera*
tion rooms like juice squirts from
ripe oranges, while doctors
Donald Sutherland and Elliot
Gould cover just about ev
erything else with wisecracks.
This is a silly, beautifully ir
reverent view of warfare: it pres
ents all generals as fools and all
objectives as petty ones. As the
spate of "serious" war/anti-war
movies we've had lately in
dicates, irreverence can do more
to demythologize warfare than
can any message pictures
("thou shait not play Russian
roulette," ar .'all that).

Das Boot ***v 2 ®
Bijou, Palo Alto r .
A solidly crafted movie by Ger
man director Wolfgang Peterson,
distinguished by other World
War II U-boat pictures by its per
spective: almost the entire film is
shot Within the submarine, so we
experience the attacks of the the
British vessels as the ctew of the
boat does. The picture is also a
small, funny essay on the horrors
of intimate communal living, but
when it veers off into character
detail or observations of conflict
between humanitarian and polit
ical ideals, it becomes a little pre
tentious. The downer of an end
ing is a cheat.

Bananas
Aquarius, Palo Alto
One of Woody Allen's first
movies, Bananas deals'
haphazardly (as one should) with
W a Latin American revolution. This
movie is very sloppily • con
structed, very unevenly paced,
and funny. Anarchy never looked
so good.
Tonight only with Sleeper.

Annie Hall ****
Aquarius, Palo Alto
Woody Allen's great psycho
sexual comedy has no weak mo
ments; it's his most consistently
appealing film. Allen and his co
star, Diane Keaton, are wonder
ful together. When Keaton's
around, Allen loses some of his
freakishness and is transformed
into a person who, if still not en
tirely normal, is a very special hu
man being. Keaton, too, is lent a
special radiance: she sings
"Seems Like Old Times" in a thin,
quavery, pretty voice, and, as the
camera caresses her face, we
sense how much Allen adores
her. A lovely movie.
Plays Saturday and Sunday
with Everything You Always
Wanted to Know about Sex But
Were Afraid to Ask.

Get Out Your Handkerchiefs
★★★★ •
New Varsity, Palo Alto
Bertrand Blier directed this co
medic mutation — it's so dif
ferent it's bound to take any au
dience by surprise. Get Out Your
Handkerchiefs is the story of a
woman who, having failed with

her husband and lover, finds
solace in the arms of a 13-year
old boy who happens to have an
IQ of 158. The story is told from
an unabashedly male viewpoint;
though the plot may belong to
the woman, Solange, the the
movie's meaning .»nd viewpoint
belong almost e< tireiv to the
movie's men. Gerard Depardieu,
Patrick Dewaere and Carol Laure
star.

The Four Seasons ★
Mountain View Theater
A tiresome movie about seven
tiresome people who become
more tiresome as the movie
progresses. Alan Alda wrote and
directed this gimmicky com
edy/drama about middle-aged
angst; his performance is nice,
but the movie just doesn't hold
together. The "revelations" he
gives us about his characters —
played, for the most part nicely,
by a cast that includes Carol
Burnett, Rita Moreno, and Sandy
Dennis — have seen better days.
You'd seem tired too if you'd
been around as long as some of
the bargain-basement insights
Alda offers.
Double-billed with On
Golden Pond.

Goldfinger
Sunday, Memorial Auditorium
Perhaps the most entertaining
of the James Bond series. This is
the one in which Shirley Eaton
gets gold-painted to death and
Bond (Sean Connery, in fine
form) encounters Oddjob, the
man with the guillotine-edged
hat — Bond's wittiest adversary
before Jaws The main love in
terest is supplied by Honore
Black man, the original star of the
TV series The Avengers. Terrific
fun — and it has a memorable
credits sequence with Shirley
Bassey singing a preposterously
sinuous song.
— S.V.
Victor Victoria ★★
Park, Menlo Park
The idea is tantalizing: in mid
'3os Paris, a gay nightclub singer
out of a job teams up with a starv
ing soprano and turns her into a
star by passing her off as a female
impersonator. But Julie Andrews,
in the title role, has neither of the
requisite qualities for playing it —
crack comic timing and an an
drogynous sexiness. Blake Ed
wards wrote the convoluted, il
logical script and directed; even
his fabled slapstick gifts desert
him here. Robert Preston, who*
makes second-rate lines sound
first rate, gives a wonderful per
formance as the homosexual.
With a passive James Garner and,
ludicrously miscast, Lesley Ann
Warren as Garner's dumb sexpot
mistress.
Double-billed with Evil Under
the Sun.

The Thin Man ****
Festival Cinema, Palo Alto
This stylish '30s detective story
is based on the book by Dashiell
Hammett. William Powell and
Myrna loy play Nick and Nora
Charles, a couple who try not to
let Nick's duties as a detective get
in the way of their entertaining.
The plot has enough twists and
false leads to keep everyone
guessing, and the denouement,
with all the suspects gathered to
gether, is a classic. W.S. Van Dyke
directed. The glossy studio pho
tography is by James Wong
Howe.

Quest for Fire
Old Mill, Mountain View
A lovely surprise. Jean-Jacques
Annaud's movie is an un-cynical
account of the struggle of early
homo sapiens to find fire; it is
huge and impressive but Annaud
has concentrated on a very strong
narrative line. Annaud not only
captures his hero Naoh's sense of
wonder at the discovery of new
marvels; in the best tradition of
literature and film, he shares it.
Annaud has used his actors won
derfully (Everett McGill and Rae
Dawn Chong are especially
good), though perhaps the movie
needs a little more humor.

Woody Allen's great psycho
sexual comedy has no weak mo
ments; it's his most consistently
appealing film. Allen and his co
star, Diane Keaton, are wonder
ful together. When Keaton's
around, Allen loses some of his
freakishness and is transformed
into a person who, if still not en
tirely normal, is a very special hu
man being. Keaton, too, is lent a
special radiance: she sings
"Seems Like Old Times" in a thin,
quavery, pretty voice, and, as the
camera caresses her face, we
sense how much Allen adores
her. A lovely movie.
Plays Saturday and Sunday
with Everything You Always
Wanted to Know about Sex But
Were Afraid to Ask.

Get Out Your Handkerchiefs
★★★★ •
New Varsity, Palo Alto
Bertrand Blier directed this co
medic mutation — it's so dif
ferent it's bound to take any au
dience by surprise. Get Out Your
Handkerchiefs is the story of a
woman who, having failed with

her husband and lover, finds
solace in the arms of a 13-year
old boy who happens to have an
IQ of 158. The story is told from
an unabashedly male viewpoint;
though the plot may belong to
the woman, Solange, the the
movie's meaning .»nd viewpoint
belong almost e< tireiv to the
movie's men. Gerard Depardieu,
Patrick Dewaere and Carol Laure
star.

Mountain View Theater
A tiresome movie about seven
tiresome people who become
more tiresome as the movie
progresses. Alan Alda wrote and
directed this gimmicky com
edy/drama about middle-aged
angst; his performance is nice,
but the movie just doesn't hold
together. The "revelations" he
gives us about his characters —
played, for the most part nicely,
by a cast that includes Carol
Burnett, Rita Moreno, and Sandy
Dennis — have seen better days.
You'd seem tired too if you'd
been around as long as some of
the bargain-basement insights
Alda offers.
Double-billed with On
Golden Pond.

Goldfinger
Sunday, Memorial Auditorium
Perhaps the most entertaining
of the James Bond series. This is
the one in which Shirley Eaton
gets gold-painted to death and
Bond (Sean Connery, in fine
form) encounters Oddjob, the
man with the guillotine-edged
hat — Bond's wittiest adversary
before Jaws The main love in
terest is supplied by Honore
Black man, the original star of the
TV series The Avengers. Terrific
fun — and it has a memorable
credits sequence with Shirley
Bassey singing a preposterously
sinuous song.
— S.V.
Victor Victoria ★★
Park, Menlo Park
The idea is tantalizing: in mid
'3os Paris, a gay nightclub singer
out of a job teams up with a starv
ing soprano and turns her into a
star by passing her off as a female
impersonator. But Julie Andrews,
in the title role, has neither of the
requisite qualities for playing it —
crack comic timing and an an
drogynous sexiness. Blake Ed
wards wrote the convoluted, il
logical script and directed; even
his fabled slapstick gifts desert
him here. Robert Preston, who*
makes second-rate lines sound
first rate, gives a wonderful per
formance as the homosexual.
With a passive James Garner and,
ludicrously miscast, Lesley Ann
Warren as Garner's dumb sexpot
mistress.
Double-billed with Evil Under
the Sun.

The Thin Man ****
Festival Cinema, Palo Alto
This stylish '30s detective story
is based on the book by Dashiell
Hammett. William Powell and
Myrna loy play Nick and Nora
Charles, a couple who try not to
let Nick's duties as a detective get
in the way of their entertaining.
The plot has enough twists and
false leads to keep everyone
guessing, and the denouement,
with all the suspects gathered to
gether, is a classic. W.S. Van Dyke
directed. The glossy studio pho
tography is by James Wong
Howe.

Quest for Fire
Old Mill, Mountain View
A lovely surprise. Jean-Jacques
Annaud's movie is an un-cynical
account of the struggle of early
homo sapiens to find fire; it is
huge and impressive but Annaud
has concentrated on a very strong
narrative line. Annaud not only
captures his hero Naoh's sense of
wonder at the discovery of new
marvels; in the best tradition of
literature and film, he shares it.
Annaud has used his actors won
derfully (Everett McGill and Rae
Dawn Chong are especially
good), though perhaps the movie
needs a little more humor.

A solidly crafted movie by Ger

distinguished by other World

spective: almost the entire film is
shot Within the submarine, so we
experience the attacks of the the
British vessels as the ctew of the

small, funny essay on the horrors
of intimate communal living, but
when it veers off into character
detail or observations of conflict
between humanitarian and polit
