Thatcher says British victory imminent

London — British troops are moving out of their beachhead on the
Falkland Islands to begin their drive to oust Argentine occupation
forces, Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher told Parliament yesterday.
A senior Defense Ministry source said the British Marines and para
troopers were advancing south, east and north from their bridgehead at
San Carlos Bay on East Falkland. But he provided no details, because the
Royal Marine commander of the British ground forces, Brig. Julian
Thompson, is maintaining radio silence while the operation is under
way.
The first targets are believed to be the settlements of Darwin and
Goose Green, 17 miles south of the British beachhead. Troops were fer
ried by helicopter before dawn yesterday to launch their assaults on
hundreds of Argentine troops, according to British correspondents
with confidential access to Defense Ministry officials.
There have been a series of apparently false reports in the British me
dia that the Goose Green airstrip was recaptured earlier this week.
Thatcher's statment to Parliament plus remarks late Wednesday night
by Defense Secretary John Nott to Conservative Party members of Par
liament that a land battle was expected "quite soon" lent credence to
reports that some British troops have encountered Argentine troops
near Darwin. But there have been no official reports here of contact be
tween British and Argentine forces.
"The house would not expect me to go into details about the opera
tions in progress," Thatcher said. Harking back to a World War II slogan
she added, "Careless talk costs lives. Too much discussion about timing
and tactics could only help the enemy."
Thatcher's remarks in the House of Commons provided
the first official news that the 5000 men on the British
beachhead now were taking the offensive a week after they
landed at San Carlos Bay. Defense Ministry officials, speaking
privately, increasingly had been questioning in recent days
why little movement was being reported to London from the
British forces since last Saturday, when Nott said they would
move fast toward the primary target, the capital of Stanley.
The senior Defense Ministry source said that there was no
single push in any one direction, but rather that the opera
tion was one of expanding the beachhead in all directions.
Some patrols already have moved forward "a long way," he
added.
Thatcher also told Parliament that there were more casual
ties from Tuesday's destruction of two British ships in the
country's worst day in the eight-week-old war. She said 33
persons are now either confirmed dead or missing and pre
sumed dead in the sinking of the destroyer HMS Coventry
and the rocketing of the merchant ship Atlantic Conveyer by
one of two Exocet sea-skimming missiles fired at it.
Another 28 were injured, but the rest of the crew of the
two ships, 440 sailors and civilians, were rescued. Among the
eight missing from the Cunard Line's container ship Atlantic
Conveyer was the captain.
Argentina claims attacks on Brits
Buenos Aires, Argentina — Argentina's military command
said yesterday its forces were still on the attack against Brit
ain's land base on the Falkland Islands and had blocked naval
operations against Argentina's own garrisons.
The military's joint chiefs of staff reported that twin-en
gine Canberra bombers operating from mainland air bases
had attacked the British beachhead near San Carlos on the
northwest end of East Falkland Island early yesterday morn
ing. The results of the raid "are being evaluated," the report
said.
Later, Argentine forces at Fox Bay on West Falkland Island
and at the capital of Stanley drove off attacking British war
ships, the military command said. It said frigates had attacked
Fox Bay, and the frigate that closed on Stanley, "abandoned
the area at maximum velocity after receiving ground fire."
The Argentine state news agency, Telam, reported that Ar
gentine and British ground forces continued to fight around
San Carlos, without either side advancing. The agency said
the Argentine army was seeking to prevent British troops
from taking the initiative and the situation was "stabilized"
as of midafternoon.
The government continued its show of hostility toward the
United States as President Leopoldo Galtieri released his re
sponse to President Ronald Reagan's message on Argen
tina's national holiday Tuesday. Reagan referred to the
"common interests and values that unite Argentina and the
United States," and Galtieri said the message "is not
coherent with the position of your government and is made
incomprehensible by the present circumstances."
"If our government and people were surprised by the un
expected move of the United States to take sides with Great
Britain in its conflict with Argentina, today on receiving your
greeting ... I could not be more shocked," Galtieri's note
said.
The content of the two messages contrasted sharply with
those published here earlier this week between Galtieri and
Cuban President Fidel Castro. Galtieri said that Argentina
was "deeply appreciative" of the "solidarity" of Cuba and
other non-aligned nations with Argentina, and described
the South Atlantic conflict as a struggle between the de

veloping world and the West's superpowers.
Yesterday's military report marked the first time that Ar
gentina has reported using its aging, British-made Canberra
bombers in the conflict since the first air attack on the British
fleet May 1. Since then, Argentina has relied heavily on its
American-built A-4 Skyhawks and more sophisticated
French-made Mirages, but has sustained substantial losses of
these planes in a week of raids on the British task force.
The air force commander and junta member, Gen. Basilio
Lami Dozo, maintained yesterday that "our capacity remains
intact in the south and we will continue answering whatever
eventual action" by the British.
House rejects cuts in medicare
Washington — With Republicans splitting left and right, a re
bellious House of Representatives yesterday rejected any
cuts in Medicare, shattering budget strategies of both parties
and setting off a frantic effort to salvage passage of any
budget resolution on the first try.
Triggered by a conservative Republican revolt that set off a
chain reaction of defections across the floor, the House
voted, 227 to 196, to modify a Republican-drafted budget al
ternative by shifting $4.8 billion from defense outlays to
Medicare next year.
For most of a dramatic roll call, conservative Republicans
voted "present" as votes piled up for the defense-to-Medi
care transfer, proposed by Mary Rose Oakar (D-Ohio) in a
move not encouraged by Democratic Party leaders.
Most of the conservatives eventually voted against the
transfer. But by then, enough other Republicans, principally
moderates upset by deep Medicare cuts in the GOP budget,
had bolted to support the transfer, giving it enough votes to
pass.
Democratic leaders, who had decided just the night
before to abandon efforts to "sweeten" the Republicans'
budget with more money for Medicare, dutifully fell in line
behind the Medicare spending restoration.
The vote in the Democratic-controlled House to keep the
budget ax away from Medicare followed a similar vote in the
Republican Senate to avoid any cuts in Sociai Security, dem
onstrating again the political clout accompanying the two
programs, especially in an election year.
"There's so much anger and frustration out there now you
couldn't even offer the Lord's Prayer," Rep. Les Aspin (D-
Wis.) said after the House vote on Medicare, although lead
ers of both parties were claiming toward the day's end that
the situation was getting back in hand.
Committee approves more aid to Israel
Washington — The Senate Foreign Relations Committee
yesterday approved a foreign aid bill that sharply increases
assistance for Israel, gives less to El Salvador than the adminis
tration wanted and trims the aid request for Zaire.
It brings authorizations of economic and military aid for
fiscal 1983 to $10.7 billion, about $300 million less than the
administration requested.
It will face a battery of controversial amendments on the
Senate floor, probably including ones to restore money for El
Salvador and to trim spending for other countries as senators
seek economies in an election year.
Sen. Nancy Landon Kassebaum (R-Kan.) was the only com
mittee member to vote against the measure, serving notice
that she will seek cuts from the full Senate because, she said,
"I am so worried about our own economy."
A House version is expected to come to the floor soon. Al
though its spending totals are approximately the same as the

Senate's, it contains the administration's full request of
$166.3 million for El Salvador. Efforts will be made to cut it
back because the Salvadoran government has suspended
part of its land reform program.
Always unpopular in an election year when the U.S. econ
omy is in poor shape, foreign aid this year will be particularly
hard to pass.
The Senate committee yesterday cut in half the adminis
tration's $20 million request for military aid to Zaire because
of members' disapproval of the regime of President Mobutu
Sese Seko, Sen. Paul E. Tsongas (D-Mass.) called Zaire "a clas
sic example of corruption."
The committee passed an amendment requiring improved
notification of Congress when the executive branch changes
export licensing regulations. It was unhappy with the admin
istration's sudden change of rules that permitted sales of air
craft to Iraq by removing that country from the list of nations
abetting terrorism.
The committee's authorization includes an increase of
$300 million in military assistance outlays for Israel over the
$550 million the administration wanted.
Israel: U.S. knew of Iranian support
Washington — Israeli Defense Minister Ariel Sharon said
yesterday that the United States was informed in detail and in
advance about his country's undercover supply of military
equipment to Iran during the Persian Gulf war with Iraq.
Sharon said that despite the neutral U.S. stance, no objec
tion was made by ranking American officials. A senior State
Department official, informed of Sharon's comments, said
Washington had sought unsuccessfully to discourage the Is
raeli shipments, estimated to be worth about $27 million.
The controversial and outspoken Sharon also said in an in
terview that plans have been drawn up to settle 70,000 more
Jews in the occupied West Bank in the next three or four
years. He said about 30,000 settlers are in place now, a higher
figure than is generally used. The new plans, which he en
dorses, would bring the total of settlers to about 100,000.
The settlements in the disputed land are "the most impor
tant contribution" to Israeli security, Sharon declared, and
also may be "the strongest guarantee" against future estab
lishment of a Palestinian state in that area.
In any case, he went on to say, "Israel will never withdraw
from Samaria, Judea (the biblical names for the West Bank
area) and the Gaza district, and Israel will never withdraw
from the Golan Heights." Sharon made clear that he rejects
any withdrawal from any part of those areas.
Sharon insisted that plans for greatly expanded settle
ments, as well as refusal to withdraw, should not interfere
with the success of Israeli-Egyptian negotiations on auton
omy for Palestinians on the West Bank and Gaza.
Palestinian residents of the area, he added, will be willing
to join the negotiations once they are assured of protection
against the Palestine Liberation Organization.
