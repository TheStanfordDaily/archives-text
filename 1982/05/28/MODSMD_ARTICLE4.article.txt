Thatcher says British victory imminent

London â€” British troops are moving out of their beachhead on the
Falkland Islands to begin their drive to oust Argentine occupation
forces, Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher told Parliament yesterday.
A senior Defense Ministry source said the British Marines and para
troopers were advancing south, east and north from their bridgehead at
San Carlos Bay on East Falkland. But he provided no details, because the
Royal Marine commander of the British ground forces, Brig. Julian
Thompson, is maintaining radio silence while the operation is under
way.
The first targets are believed to be the settlements of Darwin and
Goose Green, 17 miles south of the British beachhead. Troops were fer
ried by helicopter before dawn yesterday to launch their assaults on
hundreds of Argentine troops, according to British correspondents
with confidential access to Defense Ministry officials.
There have been a series of apparently false reports in the British me
dia that the Goose Green airstrip was recaptured earlier this week.
Thatcher's statment to Parliament plus remarks late Wednesday night
by Defense Secretary John Nott to Conservative Party members of Par
liament that a land battle was expected "quite soon" lent credence to
reports that some British troops have encountered Argentine troops
near Darwin. But there have been no official reports here of contact be
tween British and Argentine forces.
"The house would not expect me to go into details about the opera
tions in progress," Thatcher said. Harking back to a World War II slogan
she added, "Careless talk costs lives. Too much discussion about timing
and tactics could only help the enemy."
