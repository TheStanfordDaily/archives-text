# Housing rental rates to be studied
## 
### Sid Atkins 
The relative fairness of rents in
campus housing will be studied by a
University committee this summer in
the light of changing living con
figurations on campus.
The committee, which will include
six student members, will be headed
by Norm Robinson, associate dean
for Residential Education, and Ed
Scoles, director of Housing Man
agement.
According to Robinson, changes
such as the addition of 800 new un
dergraduate spaces next year and the
placement of graduate students in
Manzanita have raised equity ques
tions concerning room rates.

Scoles gave an example of the type
of comparison that will be made:
"Right now four students pay $600 a
month for a three-bedroom trailer in
Manzanita. At the same time, a per
manent three-bedroom apartment
costs $480 per month in Escondido
Village. We'll be looking into these
discrepancies to see if they're fair,"
Scoles said.
The overall purpose of the com
mittee will be to make recommenda
tions for price changes, which would
have to be approved by the Univer
sity Board of Trustees before they
took effect.
Room rates are checked period
ically for their fairness and this same

committee was set up six years ago,
according to Robinson. "It's just our
sense that it's time to do it again," he
said.
Robinson said that rates are de
termined currently in accordance
with services, such as housekeeping,
rendered in the house. He added
that age, location, size of the house
and similar factors have no bearing
on the cost of a room.
Though the members of the com
mittee have not yet been appointed,
they should finish their work by next
October. Any changes recom
mended could be made as early as
the 1983-84 school year.
