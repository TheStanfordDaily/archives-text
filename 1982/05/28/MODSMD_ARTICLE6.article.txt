# Survey investigates Tressider usage patterns
## 
### Karen Springen 
Eighty-three percent of University students,
faculty and staff utilize the services of Tresidder
Union, according to a recently-completed Tres
idder survey.
The Space Committee, an 11-member ad
visory subcommittee of the Tresidder Union
Board, developed the survey to assess com
munity usage patterns and satisfaction with in
dividual services and to obtain suggestions for
new or expanded facilities and the elimination
of current services. The committee will use the
results in formulating a long-range space plan.
Eighty-three percent of the 1050 people who
responded to the survey described themselves
as users of Tresidder Union. Student usage was
93 percent, faculty usage 73 percent and staff
usage 92 percent.
The facilities most used by faculty, staff and
students are The Store (77 percent) and the Cof
fee House (75 percent). This reflects the fact that
75 percent of those surveyed visit Tresidder to
eat or run errands. Other reasons for frequent
ing Tresidder include attending eventsor meet
ings, obtaining information and meeting
friends.
Following The Store and the Coffee House in
usage were Wells Fargo Bank, Union
Crossroads, the Ticket Office and Marcel's.

Heaviest users of each service were: students at
Wells Fargo and Marcel's; faculty at the Ticket
Office; and staff at Marcel's and Union
Crossroads.
Other services are infrequently used. Hair
styling, for example, attracted only 16 percent
of those surveyed, and the browsing room drew
only nine percent. About a third of those sur
veyed were unaware of the existence of the
browsing room and more than half the re
spondents described the hair salon as the ser
vice they could most live without.
Services people would like to see added in
cluded food and beverage options, topped by
ice cream and followed by a pizza parlor and a
campus pub.
Tresidder Marketing Director Nanci Howe
said the committee sent the survey to 2050 ran
domly selected community members (1227 stu
dents, 129 faculty and 687 staff). More than 50
percent of the questionnaires were returned
before the two-week deadline. The survey was
conducted from late February through mid-
March, and the results were released May 19.
According to Howe, some of the results have
changed already. For example, business at the
Corner Pocket has increased considerably since
the addition of pizza and frozen yogurt. At the
time of the survey, the Corner Pocket had only a

12 percent usage rate. Howe said, "The reason
why it was not used very heavily was that people
did not know about it."
The survey included an incentive: Tresidder
Union Director Ellie Oppenheim placed the
names of all the people who completed it in a
drawing for a free Sunday brunch party for six at
the Palo Alto restaurant of the winner's choice.
Graduate student Patricia Bradshaw won, said
Howe.
Howe said each area in Tresidder conducted
an internal survey a year ago, but that this repre
sents the first major external sample.
The Space Committee will meet in July to de
velop long-range space planning goals. Howe
expects the draft to be submitted to the Union
Board by early fall.
Howe said the union's primary function is as a
community center. In keeping with this philos
ophy, the Union Board does not necessarily
give profitable uses of space top priority. "The
financial decisions should not affect our overall
goals," she said; for example, the Board may
opt for increased lounging space rather than
another retail service. This ensures "unity and
cohesiveness," Howe said, adding that students
represent Tresidder's most important user
group.
