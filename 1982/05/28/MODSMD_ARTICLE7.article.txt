# Unstable federal aid policy detrimental to grad programs
## 
### 
The results of a major study con
ducted in large part by Vice President
for Public Affairs Robert Rosenzweig
conclude that stable, long-term sup
port of the nation's ablest students
should be the primary objective of
federal policy in graduate education.
In a stern warning to government
budget slashers, the report says that
distorted institutional purposes, un
balanced programs and com
promised high standards of quality
can result from public demands for
rapid solutions in areas like defense,
space exploration, disease, health
care "and now industry productivity

and innovation."
"The key to returning stability to
graduate education lies in avoiding
sudden, sharp shifts in enrollment.
Changes occur naturally enough
over time as individual career
choices respond to changing in
tellectual currents and economic re
alities," the report states.
While universities can respond to
"such healthy signs of flexibility,"
sharp fluctuations in federal financial
aid are far more disruptive to these
institutions, it continues.
Prepared under the auspices of the
Association of American Univer

sities, the study was written by Ro
senzweig and Barbara Turlington,
former dean of Hampshire College
and AAU staff member. The findings
appear in the newly-released Re
search Universities and Their Patrons
, published by the University of Cali
fornia Press.
In a sweeping declaration, the re
port asserts that "the most important
long-term goal of government policy
should be to assure that an adequate
fraction of the most able college
graduates is able to pursue graduate
study."
The report claims that the pro

grams which can achieve the goal of
educating these students are already
in place, with one key program being
competitive graduate fellowships
provided by the National Science
Foundation (NSF).
The report also observes that "in
dustrial support for graduate engi
neering students and subsidized pro
grams of advanced training for engi
neers employed in industry may help
to solve the problems more econom
ically and with less later disruption
than would crash government pro
grams."
