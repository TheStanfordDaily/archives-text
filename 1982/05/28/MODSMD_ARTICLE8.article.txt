## Study links heart disease to use of oral contraceptives 
### Laurie Lacob 
A regular exercise pro
gram may reduce the risk of
heart disease for women
who use oral contracep
tives, a University study in
dicates.
Medical researchers have
long been aware that inges
tion of estrogen and pro
gestin, the hormones used
in birth control pills, has the
detrimental effect of raising
the levels of cholesterol and
triglycerides in the blood
stream. Elevated levels of
these fatty substances can
lead to atherosclerosis,
heart attacks or strokes. But
a current study under the
auspices of the Stanford
Heart Disease Prevention
Program (SHDPP) indicates
that these unwelcomed side
effects may be effectively
counterbalanced through
regular exercise.
Dan Merians, research as
sistant with the SHDPP, has
been directing this study for
the past year. Merian claims
that the data collected so far
demonostrates a definite
correlation between regular
exercise and lower levels of
cholesterol and
triglycerides.
Cholesterol and
triglycerides are both lipids
â€” fats and related com
pounds which cirulate in
the blood. These lipids com
bine with proteins, forming

molecules called lipopor
teins, of various sizes and
weights. Very low density
lipoproteins, or VLDL, trans
port triglycerides from the
liver to the fatty deposits
throughout the body. Once
they shed their
triglycerides, they are con
verted to a second type of
lipoprotein, low density
lipoproteins, or LDL. LDLs
carry cholesterol in their
core and, in man, represent
the major mode .of trans
porting cholesterol from
the liver to the cells of the
various tissues.
High density lipoproteins,
or HDL, with the highest
proportion of protein, are
believed .to help clear away
unneeded cholesterol from
the tissues and return it to
the liver to be excreted. Al
though it has not yet been
proved, it also appears that
HDLs remove cholesterol
from the artery walls, thus
preventing atherosclerosis.
In other words, there are
both "bad" and "good"
lipoproteins. Of the "bad"
ones, the worst are the LDLs,
which, if there is more
cholesterol than is needed,
deposit their fatty cargoes
on the interior linings of the
coronary arteries. Even
tually, this buildup of fatty
plaques sets the stage for a
heart attack. On the other
hand, the HDLs floating in

the bloodstream pick up ex
cess cholesterol and, ac
cording to the current un
derstanding, carry it back to
the liver to be passed from
the body.
Middle-aged men, who
have a higher-than-average
risk of heart attack and
stroke, tend to have higher
than-average levels of LDL.
Women on the Pill have
been noted to have higher
levels of LDL as well. Gener
ally, however, women tend
to have higher levels of HDL
and a lower risk of develop
ing atherosclerosis, heart at
tacks and strokes.
Dr. Peter Wood, deputy
director of the SHDPP, dis
covered several years ago
that runners, both male and
female, have relatively high
levels of HDL. Currently he
and Dr. William Haskell,
also of the SHDPP, are ex
amining the effects of ex
ercise on lipoprotein levels.
They have found evidence
that sedentary middle-aged
men can lower their risks of
developing heart disease
through graduated exercise
programs.
Extrapolating from these
findings, Merians hoped to
find that women who ex
ercise regularly would ex
hibit higher HDL levels,
whether or not they used
oral contraceptives. His
