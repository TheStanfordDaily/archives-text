# Scholar discusses Palestine

### Chitra Subramanian 
Misconceptions about the Palestine
problem are so varied and deep-rooted
that until recently, it was almost impossible
to speak about the issue in a way that made
any sense, according to Muhammad
Hallaj, visiting scholar from the Harvard
University Center for International Affairs
and Vice-President of Bir Zeit University in
the occupied West Bank.
Speaking on "Palestine: the suppression
of an idea," Hallaj told a modest gathering
Tuesday night at the school of education
that "the Palestinian issue was never ade
quately understood and correctly per
ceived — hence the body of misinforma
tion is fairly large."
Hallaj, a professor of political science
who has taught in various American and
Arab universities, attributed this misin-

formation to what he called two fairly basic
methodological errors. "One is to think
that the Middle-East conflict, the Arab-Is
raeli dispute, and the Palestinian question
are synonymous," Hallaj said. "While the
issues to overlap, it is a misnomer to think
of the three different questions as one
homogenous whole."
Later in an interview with The Daily,
Hallaj said that the Arab-Israeli conflict re
sulted from the introduction of a "foreign
body" into the area in 1948 — "a body that
called itself Israel and a body that was
nurtured by external forces and process.
They did not represent the indigenous
population and this led to dislocations and
destabil'zing events in the Middle East,"
Hallaj said.
"From the beginning, the Zionists
adopted the slogan: a land without people
for a people without land (referring to
Palestine), totally disregarding the fact that
Palestine was a country with people, 90
percent of whom were Arabs owning 97.5
percent of the land," he said.
Hallaj said the question of Palestine is
portrayed as one that is extremely complex
to understand, let alone be resolved.
"Agreed that it is a difficult issue and one
that will take some effort to resolve, but
the basic problem is a very simple one,"
Hallaj said. "Our society has been de-.
stroyed and reconstituting it is the prob
lem and the solution."
The other methodological error, Hallaj
said, was to start telling the story of
Palestine from the middle, from the time in
1948 when the state of Israel was estab
lished, ignoring what had gone on earlier.

"When Zionism first emerged as an or
ganized political movement in 1897 to
solve the Jewish problem by ingathering
the Jews of the world in a Jewish state in
Palestine, it inevitably put itself in collision
with an already existing society," Hallaj
said. "This fact is indispensable to in
terpreting Palestinian attitudes toward Is
rael or Israeli behavior toward the Palesti
nian people."
Hallaj said that to the Palestinians, the Zi
onists were European settlers who,
through a process of invasion by migra
tion, disposed them of their country and
turned them into a nation of refugees. "So,
for us, 1948 is not the beginning of the
problem — it represents the consumma
tion of the most crucial stage in the ques
tion of Palestine," Hallaj said.
As a result Hallaj said, Palestinians are
now scattered all over the world, having
assumed the citizenship of the country
that gave them shelter." Despite the fact
that our identity has been so severely ques
tioned, Palestinians have not given up
their struggle of getting a homeland and a
right to self-government," Hallaj said, and
added that it was ironical that Palestine was
dismantled at a time in history when coun
tries all over the world were achieving in
dependence. "It was particularly disturb
ing when viewed against the fact that way
back in 1922, the Covenant of the League
of Nations put Palestine in a Class A Man
date according to which it was a country
'whose existence as an independent na
tion can be provisionally recognized' "
while it received "administrative as
sistance and advice" on its way to inde
pendence, Hallaj said.
Undeterred by events that questioned
their basic identity, Hallaj said that the
Palestinians, through popular, armed
struggle, political leadership and various
institutions — the Palestine Workers
Union, the General Union of Palestine
Women, the Palestine National Fund, the
Palestine Red Crescent, etc. — finally
crystallized into a National Liberation
Movement, comprising all the Palestinian
factions, organizations and capabilities,
finally materializing into the Palestinian
Liberation Organization (PLO) in 1964.
"Despite the fact that the PLO represents
the Palestinian people legitimately and
uniquely, it has been continually
portrayed as a bunch of terrorists who
have no claim to legitimacy as those that
speak for the Palestinian people," Hallaj
said.
According to Hallaj, all the peace efforts
— "the Camp David concoction, the Jor
danian option, and many others" — can

never succeed for the simple reason that
they all have tried to come up with alter
natives and substitutes to the Palestinian
question rather than accept the fact that
the Palestinians had a right to self-govern
ment.
"The Palestinians did not disappear or
perish as they were supposed to," Hallaj
said, and added that even now they are
being continually harassed in the oc
cupied West Bank and Gaza Strip. "My
own university (Bir Zeit University) was
closed for four months during the last aca
demic year due to escalation of violence
that manifested itself in the form of harass
ment of staff and students, censorship of
books, disruption of cultural events, etc.,"
Hallaj said.
"In the West Bank and Gaza, com
prehensive control of the school system is
exercised by an Israeli military officer who
controls budgets, appointments, cur
riculum, textbooks and every aspect of the
educational process."
Hallaj said that a concerted effort was
being made to undermine the culture and
history of the Palestinians. "A UNESCO
(United Nations Educational and Scientific
Organization) team that visited the area
said in its report that in books dealing with
history and geography one finds an almost
systematic replacement of the term
"Palestine" by "Israel," Hallaj said.
During the interview, Hallaj said that he
believed the Palestinians were willing to
discuss the idea of sharing the land with
the Jews. "In fact, sharing the land where
both groups enjoy equal status is one of
the solutions we offered — the other is to
consider the concept of a two-state solu
tion whereby both states could exist as
democratic secular states," said Hallaj.
Commenting on the position of Israel and
its sponsors which revolves around the fact
that the Palestinians recognize Israel's
pre-1967 status before any negotiations
can begin, Hallaj said: "It is like saying I ac
cept the fact that you have taken 80 per
cent of my land and I am willing to nego
tiate the fate of the other 20 percent —
when I was growing up in Jerusalem, there
was no Israel, so how can I concede to that
demand?"
On the role of the other Arab states in
solving the stalemate, Hallaj said that by
and-large, they were supporting the cause
of the Palestinians though the degrees of
enthusiasm varied. "Peace is certainly not
impossible, especially when there are
groups within Israel now seeking to work
with the Palestinians to achieve the same
goal," Hallaj said.

rael or Israeli behavior toward the Palesti
nian people."
Hallaj said that to the Palestinians, the Zi
onists were European settlers who,
through a process of invasion by migra
tion, disposed them of their country and
turned them into a nation of refugees. "So,
for us, 1948 is not the beginning of the
problem — it represents the consumma
tion of the most crucial stage in the ques
tion of Palestine," Hallaj said.
As a result Hallaj said, Palestinians are
now scattered all over the world, having
assumed the citizenship of the country
that gave them shelter." Despite the fact
that our identity has been so severely ques
tioned, Palestinians have not given up
their struggle of getting a homeland and a
right to self-government," Hallaj said, and
added that it was ironical that Palestine was
dismantled at a time in history when coun
tries all over the world were achieving in
dependence. "It was particularly disturb
ing when viewed against the fact that way
back in 1922, the Covenant of the League
of Nations put Palestine in a Class A Man
date according to which it was a country
'whose existence as an independent na
tion can be provisionally recognized' "
while it received "administrative as
sistance and advice" on its way to inde
pendence, Hallaj said.
Undeterred by events that questioned
their basic identity, Hallaj said that the
Palestinians, through popular, armed
struggle, political leadership and various
institutions — the Palestine Workers
Union, the General Union of Palestine
Women, the Palestine National Fund, the
Palestine Red Crescent, etc. — finally
crystallized into a National Liberation
Movement, comprising all the Palestinian
factions, organizations and capabilities,
finally materializing into the Palestinian
Liberation Organization (PLO) in 1964.
"Despite the fact that the PLO represents
the Palestinian people legitimately and
uniquely, it has been continually
portrayed as a bunch of terrorists who
have no claim to legitimacy as those that
speak for the Palestinian people," Hallaj
said.
According to Hallaj, all the peace efforts
— "the Camp David concoction, the Jor
danian option, and many others" — can

never succeed for the simple reason that
they all have tried to come up with alter
natives and substitutes to the Palestinian
question rather than accept the fact that
the Palestinians had a right to self-govern
ment.
"The Palestinians did not disappear or
perish as they were supposed to," Hallaj
said, and added that even now they are
being continually harassed in the oc
cupied West Bank and Gaza Strip. "My
own university (Bir Zeit University) was
closed for four months during the last aca
demic year due to escalation of violence
that manifested itself in the form of harass
ment of staff and students, censorship of
books, disruption of cultural events, etc.,"
Hallaj said.
"In the West Bank and Gaza, com
prehensive control of the school system is
exercised by an Israeli military officer who
controls budgets, appointments, cur
riculum, textbooks and every aspect of the
educational process."
Hallaj said that a concerted effort was
being made to undermine the culture and
history of the Palestinians. "A UNESCO
(United Nations Educational and Scientific
Organization) team that visited the area
said in its report that in books dealing with
history and geography one finds an almost
systematic replacement of the term
"Palestine" by "Israel," Hallaj said.
During the interview, Hallaj said that he
believed the Palestinians were willing to
discuss the idea of sharing the land with
the Jews. "In fact, sharing the land where
both groups enjoy equal status is one of
the solutions we offered — the other is to
consider the concept of a two-state solu
tion whereby both states could exist as
democratic secular states," said Hallaj.
Commenting on the position of Israel and
its sponsors which revolves around the fact
that the Palestinians recognize Israel's
pre-1967 status before any negotiations
can begin, Hallaj said: "It is like saying I ac
cept the fact that you have taken 80 per
cent of my land and I am willing to nego
tiate the fate of the other 20 percent —
when I was growing up in Jerusalem, there
was no Israel, so how can I concede to that
demand?"
On the role of the other Arab states in
solving the stalemate, Hallaj said that by
and-large, they were supporting the cause
of the Palestinians though the degrees of
enthusiasm varied. "Peace is certainly not
impossible, especially when there are
groups within Israel now seeking to work
with the Palestinians to achieve the same
goal," Hallaj said.
Misconceptions about the Palestine
problem are so varied and deep-rooted
that until recently, it was almost impossible
to speak about the issue in a way that made
any sense, according to Muhammad
Hallaj, visiting scholar from the Harvard
University Center for International Affairs
and Vice-President of Bir Zeit University in
the occupied West Bank.
Speaking on "Palestine: the suppression
of an idea," Hallaj told a modest gathering
Tuesday night at the school of education
that "the Palestinian issue was never ade
quately understood and correctly per
ceived — hence the body of misinforma
tion is fairly large."
Hallaj, a professor of political science
who has taught in various American and
Arab universities, attributed this misin-

■News analysis*

formation to what he called two fairly basic
methodological errors. "One is to think
that the Middle-East conflict, the Arab-Is
raeli dispute, and the Palestinian question
are synonymous," Hallaj said. "While the
issues to overlap, it is a misnomer to think
of the three different questions as one
homogenous whole."
Later in an interview with The Daily,
Hallaj said that the Arab-Israeli conflict re
sulted from the introduction of a "foreign
body" into the area in 1948 — "a body that
called itself Israel and a body that was
nurtured by external forces and process.
They did not represent the indigenous
population and this led to dislocations and
destabil'zing events in the Middle East,"
Hallaj said.
"From the beginning, the Zionists
adopted the slogan: a land without people
for a people without land (referring to
Palestine), totally disregarding the fact that
Palestine was a country with people, 90
percent of whom were Arabs owning 97.5
percent of the land," he said.
Hallaj said the question of Palestine is
portrayed as one that is extremely complex
to understand, let alone be resolved.
"Agreed that it is a difficult issue and one
that will take some effort to resolve, but
the basic problem is a very simple one,"
Hallaj said. "Our society has been de-.
stroyed and reconstituting it is the prob
lem and the solution."
The other methodological error, Hallaj
said, was to start telling the story of
Palestine from the middle, from the time in
1948 when the state of Israel was estab
lished, ignoring what had gone on earlier.

"When Zionism first emerged as an or
ganized political movement in 1897 to
solve the Jewish problem by ingathering
the Jews of the world in a Jewish state in
Palestine, it inevitably put itself in collision
with an already existing society," Hallaj
said. "This fact is indispensable to in
terpreting Palestinian attitudes toward Is
rael or Israeli behavior toward the Palesti
nian people."
Hallaj said that to the Palestinians, the Zi
onists were European settlers who,
