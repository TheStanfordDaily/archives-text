368 CASTRO ST., MOUNTAIN VIEW
PIZZA OF THE STARS
Bob Anderson, Mt. View, Calif.: 'During the spring when our
team is practicing tor the Corporate Cup Relays we practice
together twice a week and always hit a pizza parlor afterwards.
Right in Runners World s home town there are two exceptional
pizza places. One is Boswell's and the other is Frankie, Johnny
and Luigi 100. BoswelK is a quiet sedate place with excellent
pizza. Each one is a work ot art. The sides >.ic built up like the
walls of a tortress and the middle does not droop so that all the
toppings slide to the middle. The crust (the part people usually
leave lying on the plate) tastes like those sott pretzels they sell on
Manhatten s streets. Frankie lohnny and Luigi Too is a madhouse.
You have to get into line to get in and vou have to wait for
mavbe a half hour. It's sort of macho p.zza, because it take a
veiy, very hungry person to do damage to it.' Reprinted
