The historic formula for the entrepreneur has been to start
something, build it up, sell out, get out, and start the cycle again.
Now there's a new phase dawning — the "technology rush" breed
of entrepreneur that sticks with the venture and keeps on
innovating. The result is a new breed of companies like Tandem
Computer. I riad Systems, and Genetech.
ENTREPRENEURING is the first book aimed at building a
company for rapid growth. Author Steven Brandt presents ten
main operating principles or ideas essential for starting and
managing a growth company. He begins with the start up issues
— who should be involved? What is to be accomplished? Who is
going to buy the product? And continues through knowing when
to change 01 grow with a company. There's even a chapter on
maintaining personal well-being during critical stress periods in
the early development of a company. For anyone who has chosen
entrepreneuring as a lifestyle, here's the business plan to map a
winning course.
Steven Hrandt is a faculty memltrr at Stanford Business Schoitl.
