A UNIVERSAL BROTHERHOOD DECLARATION:
To my dear fellowmen and leaders of the world:
As we are all born to be brothers on this earth there are no fundamental
conflict between individuals or should there be any animosities among
nations. Yet there is no denying that we are living in a world full of hatred and
mistrust which threatens its very existence. We as human beings are not bom
with the concept of "isms" or political divisions or any sense of hostility
toward each other. It is important that we recognize such divisive concepts
are today threatening our lives and resolve to do away with them so as to treat
everybody else as our fellowman with universal love.
From this day on we shall resolve to promote friendship between peoples
in a spirit of cooperation. With compassion we must overlook once and for all
any animosity and misunderstanding that might exist amongst us. Together
we shall begin a new beginning and thus opening up a new great highway
toward a world of paradise in which everyone shall enjoy a life of abundance.
To this end I'm proposing that the population of the world be reduced in
half so that three will be no shortage of material means of livelihood for all.
This will be carried out according to a definet schedule to be set by experts.
With the root of conflict having thus been eliminated there will be no
justification for nations to attack each other for territorial gains.
At the same time I'm proposing that there be a universal disarmament by
all nations cutting all conventional weapons by 90%. The United States will
ake the lead to set an example. There is no reason we couldn't accomplish
this in 3-5 years.
All nations shall be allowed temporarily their heavy armament for sell
defense, and when mutual confidence has been accomplished. The remain
ing weapons can be simultaneously destroyed creating a world without arms
or armies.
It may be a little too optimistic to expect the achievement of such a goal in
our jifetime, but surely within the coming generation. In my capacity as
President of the United States I wish to solemnly declare at this time that if
any nation should from this day on initiate any reckless action against others
before total peace is achieved it will mean the end for us all!
Sincerely yours,
Exerpt from "An open letter to the XP.Â°!y OW
