ESTRELLITA
RESTAURANT
The Stanford Daily says:
"La Estrellita features a classic Mexican
menu which includes everything from
exquisite tacos to exotic dishes like chalupas.
The restaurant specializes in five different
kinds of hurritos. Tnesc are not, however, the
average Taco Bell variety which can be eaten
in four bites. These hurritos are well over a
foot long and a meal by themselves. In
addition to their famous hurritos, the owner
recommends suizas, enchiladas made with
chile sauce and covered with guacamole and
sour cream; chimichangas, a flour tortilla,
filled with shredded beef and topped with
guacamole and sour cream; and for
vegetarians, one of their mam tostadas, all
served on large platters in verv generous
portions guaranteed to satisf\ even big
appetites.
I bis restaurant has an informal, relaxed
atmosphere. The white-walled interior,
candlelit tables and handmade Mexican decor
create the unpretentious ambience found
south of the border. We highh reconuned
Estrellita."
