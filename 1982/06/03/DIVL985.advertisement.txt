Gringo's
TRAVEL GUIDES
A Gringo's Guide to Paris contains more than enough around which to
structure a complete and dynamic life-style for either two months or two
years. Whether it's art, business opportunities, legal advice, language tips,
meeting people of the opposite sex or good wine that you're seeking,
A Gringo's Guide to Paris has it all.
Caracus is not the Paris of South America, not even the Cleveland of South
America. It is far too complex and heterogeneous to make any expletives
stick. The "caraqueno" thinks he is someone special for just being able to
live and thrive in this city. He likes to challenge others to do the same, yet
deep down has no sympathy for those who can't seem to adapt. A Gringo's
Guide to Caracas is the unapologetic guide book for the person who wants
to or must make a serious effort to adapt to Caracas. There is no other
guide book that can help him do this as well as this one.
