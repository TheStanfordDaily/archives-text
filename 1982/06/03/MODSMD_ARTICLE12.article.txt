# Brown expected to win handily in Demo field
## Goldwater, McCloskey, Wilson vie for GOP nod 
### 
Barry Goldwater Jr.
The son of U.S. Sen. Barry Gold
water (R-Ariz.), Rep. Goldwater, 43,
(R-Woodland Hills) has represented
his district since 1969 when he won
the seat in a special election.
Goldwater is a self-avowed conser
vative who is particularly proud of
two things: his family name and his
country, which he has been touting
throughout his campaign. He gradu
ated from Arizona State University in
1962 as a marketing major and
worked a stockbroker before enter
ing politics.
As a congressman, Goldwater cos
ponsored the 1974 Right to Privacy
Act, which became law and gives
private citizens access to government
files. He is generally loyal to the Rea
gan administration, but his most re
cent difference was over the sale of
electronic surveillance planes
(AWACS) to Saudi Arabia, which he
opposed.
Goldwater consistently held a
strong lead in various public opinion
polls throughout the campaign, but
he is now running neck and neck
with San Diego Mayor Pete Wilson.
He has been criticized for his relative
ly low — 58 percent — Congressional
voting record during the past year,
but he has said this is because of his
campaign and that he has not missed
the significant votes.
On the issues:
•Goldwater strongly supports Presi
dent Ronald Reagan's "New Federal
ism" proposals. But he would also
support a 10 percent federal income
tax cut.
•Although Goldwater voted for the
ERA, he no longer supports it.
•He is opposed to federal funding for
abortions and supports constitu
tional ammendments to ban abor
tions.
•Goldwater opposes California's Nu
clear Freeze Initiative and supports a
massive buildup of American military
strength.
•Goldwater, who sides with environ
mentalists on many issues and often
criticizes U.S. Secretary of the In
terior James Watt, supports building

the Peripheral Canal.
Pete Wilson
San Diego Mayor Wilson served
five years as an assemblyman before
being elected mayor in 1971. Born in
Illinois, Wilson, 46, is a graduate of
Yale University and holds a law
degree from Boalt Hall at UC-
Berkeley.
Prior to his Senate bid announce
ment last August, Wilson intended to
run in the gubernatorial race. But
early polls indicated Wilson would
not win the Republican nomination.
He has run for governor twice before
and lost.
Throughout the campaign Wilson
has steadily strengthened his cam
paign bid and he is now considered
the potential winner of the Re
publican nomination. His campaign
has vigorously attacked Goldwater
for failing to debate with the other
candidates and he has attacked Mc-
Closkey for his view of the Israeli lob
by, which McCloskey said he be
lieves is too strong.
Wilson opposed the AWACS sale
and is endorsed by many Jewish com
munity groups, as well as being en
dorsed by Proposition 13 coauthor
Paul Gann and by many agricultural
businessmen.
Wilson is credited with making San
Diego one of the major cities in the
country today. Under his tenure, the
city built an effective mass transit
project and has -lured major busi
nesses to open up offices. He is a
leading critic of rent control and
sponsored a city ammendment
which requires that striking city em
ployees be fired.
On the issues:
•Wilson supports Reaganomics and
opposes tax increases to cut the fed
eral deficit. In addition, he would re
duce federal housing subsidies and
strongly supports cutting food-stamp
benefits.
•He supports the ERA.
•Wilson has said he believes abortion
is a woman's choice, but he opposes
federal funding for abortions.
•He is opposed to California's Nucle

ar Freeze Iniative and is opposed to a
nuclear arms freeze until the United
States reaches arms parity with the
Soviet Union. (He was recently en
dorsed by Hoover Senior Fellow Ed
ward Teller.)
•He supports the Peripheral Canal.
Paul "Pete" McCloskey
Rep. McCloskey, 54, is a graduate
of Stanford University and the Uni
versity Law School. He has repre
sented Menlo Park since 1967 when
he won the Republican nomination
from Shirley Temple Black in a much
publicized primary.
Prior to running for Congress, Mc-
Closkey served in Korea as a marine
lieutenant, served as deputy district
attorney in Alameda County and
worked as a private attorney. In 1972,
McCloskey angered many Re
publicans when he sought the New
Hampshire Republican nomination
for president against Richard Nixon.
McCloskey was one of the first
congressmen to oppose U.S. involve
ment in Viet Nam and was the first to
call for Nixon's impeachment. He
raised the ire of many students when
he announced, at the University, his
"National Youth Service" proposal
which asks that all 18-year-olds give
one or two years to military or volun
tary service.
Throughout his campaign, he has
made headlines for his call for the es
tablishment of a Palestinian home
land and his warning that politicians
should stand up to the Jewish lobby's
position on matters concerning Israel
when they go against current U.S.
policy in the Middle East — for exam
ple, the lobby's opposition to the sale
of AWACS, which McCloskey sup
ported.
On the issues:
•McCloskey generally supports Rea
gan's budget proposals, but has said
he believes the federal deficit should
be cut.
•Although McCloskey once voted
against the ERA in 1970 because of
his frustration with the legislative
process, he now supports it.

•Supports abortion as a woman's
choice, which the government
should not interfere with.
•He wants to cut the proposed mili
tary budget by $14 billion and sup
ports the Nuclear Freeze Initiative as
well as other measures to freeze nu
clear arms buildups.
•He is opposed to the Peripheral
Canal.
Edmund "Jerry" Brown
Gov. Brown has been governor
since 1974 following a term as secre
tary of state. He is distinguished as
only the second Democratic gov
ernor in the state's history. His father,
Edmund "Pat" Brown, was the first
Democratic governor elected.
Brown, 43, received his under
graduate degree in Latin and Greek
at UC-Berkeley and obtained his law
degree from Yale University.
Politically, he has come under fire
for his "flip-flop" stance on Proposi
tion 13 and his handling of the Medf
ly spraying — which he opposed.
Brown even went so far as to tell Bay
Area residents to consider filing suits
if they developed side-affects follow
ing the spraying.
Brown has also come under fire for
his appointment of Rose Bird as the
chief justice of California's Supreme
Court. Bird, whom critics say is too
liberal, faces a recall initiative.
Nonetheless, Brown has received
much praise for his strong stance on
environmental issues 'and has long
opposed the building of nuclear
power plants. He is confident of win
ning the Democratic nomination for
the Senate, so much so that he has
virtually conducted no campaign for
the June 8 primary, saving his money
for the November 2 election.
On the issues:
•Brown wants to defer the 1983 fed
eral income tax cut and supports tax
es on oil imports rather than nuclear
energy subsidies.
•He supports the ERA.
•Brown believes abortion is a wom
an's choice.
•He is a staunch supporter a nuclear

arms freeze and the California Nu
clear Freeze Iniatiative.
•He supports the Peripheral Canal.
Also seeking the nomination for
the U.S. Senate are:
•Republicans:
Ted Bruinsma: former dean of Loy
ala Law School and former president
of Learjet Industries. He stresses his
lack of political experience and ex
tensive business experience as
plusses.
Maureen Reagan: the daughter of
President Ronald Reagan, Maureen

has had extensive business ex
perience and was president of an im
port-export firm. She has held no po
litical office.
•Democrats:
Core Vidal: considered politically
liberal, the novelist supports a nucle
ar arms freeze, opposes abortion and
supports the Peripheral Canal.
Paul Carpenter: has represented
Cypress as a state senator since 1976.
He supports nuclear power, a nucle
ar arms freeze, the Peripheral Canal
and the ERA.
