# Demo Bradley a shoo-in; Curb and 'Duke' in tight GOP race
## 
### 
Tom Bradley
Los Angeles Mayor Bradley's tele
vision ads stress his service for 21
years as a policeman for the Los An
geles Police Department. Bradley, 64,
received his bachelor's degree from
UCLA and went to nightschool while
a policeman before earning his law
degree from Southwestern Univer
sity in Los Angeles.
Bradley was elected a Los Angeles
city councilman in 1963, holding the
position for 10 years. In 1973, he was
elected mayor of Los Angeles and has
been reelected twice.
Bradley is a charismatic politician,
although he is politically moderate
and quiet. His gubernatorial cam
paign has been low-key; Bradley has
made few public appearancesand re
fused Garamendi's challenges to de
bate.

If Bradley wins the November elec
tion, he will be the first black elected
governor in the nation's history — a
possiblity which public opinion polls
indicate may very well happen.
On the issues: "Bradley supports
the Peripheral Canal, saying it is nec
essary for the state's economy. *He
opposes the "Victim's Bill of Rights"
because, he said, it will hamper law
enforcement rather than enhance it.
•He has taken no position on the
Rose Bird recall, but has said judges
should be turned out of office for
malfeasance only. *He opposes off
shore oil drilling on sensitive coastal
areas, such as Monterey, but has no
opposition to drilling otherwise. *He
supports nuclear power.
John Garamendi
State Senate Majority Leader Gar

amendi (D-Walnut Grove) is a
fourth-generation Californian, living
in the Mother Lode country. He re
ceived his bachelor's degree from
UC-Berkeley, served in the Peace
Corps in Africa for two years with his
wife, Patti, then received an MBA
degree from Harvard University.
Garamendi, 37, has had a meteoric
rise in politics. He was elected to the
state Assembly in 1974, was elected to
the state Senate in 1976 and was reel
ected in 1980.
His campaign has been plagued by
lack of name identification and fi
nancial support; hence he has been
unable to launch extensive cam
paigning efforts.
Garamendi is particularly noted for
his stauch stand on environmental is
sues. He was instrumental in nego
tiating restrictions on development

at Lake Tahoe. He also supports wel
fare reform and wants to restructure
the MediCal program.
On the issues:
•Garamendi was one of the first op
posing the Peripheral Canal, saying it
is unsafe environmentally and that it
will destroy the Sacramento Delta.
•He told the Daily he supports the
"Victim's Bill of Rights," but he does
so "reluctantly" because it has many
legislative problems. The problems
can be remedied after it passes, he
said.
•Garamendi opposes the Rose Bird
recall.
•He opposes off-shore oil drilling.
•He strongly opposes the develop
ment of nuclear power.
George Deukmejian
Attorney General Deukmejian re

ceived his bachelor's degree from
Siena College and a law degree from
St. John's College, both in New York.
He served in the U.S. Army for 16
months with a legal team in Paris and
moved to Los Angeles in the 19505.
Deukmejian, 53, had a private law
practice in Long Beach before enter
ing politics. In 1962 he won an state
Assembly seat and in 1966 he was
elected to the state Senate. He was
the state Senate leader in 1969 and
1970 and the Senate Republican lead
er from 1974 through 1978. In 1978 he
was elected attorney general.
Deukmejian is an unexciting
speaker and lacks charisma, so he
stresses his work in office: he was the
author of the current death-penalty
statute as well as the "use-a-gun, go
to-jail" law. He is using his image as a
crime fighter as a major issue in this
campaign. He is considered political
ly conservative.
He is critical of the California
Energy Commission and wants it to
speed up the approval for new power
plants. He has said he would increase
freeway construction, if elected gov
ernor.
On the issues:
•Deukmejian supports the Per
ipheral Canal, which he said he be
lieves will protect the environment.
•He supports the "Victim's Bill of
Rights."
•Deukmejian said he would not re
call Rose Bird except for
malfeasance.
•Supports off-shore oil drilling only if
its environmentally safe and if it
would yield large amounts of oil.
•He supports nuclear power.

Mike Curb
An entrepeneur who was a mil
lionaire and president of MGM rec
ords at 24, Lt. Gov. Curb has a strong
business background as well as hav
ing been lieutenant governor since
1978.
Curb, 37, has frequently capital
ized on Gov. Brown's absences, sign
ing legislation as acting governor
which Brown would probably not
have signed. He is a conservative,
right-wing politician who is backed
by President Ronald Reagan's Cali
fornia supporters.
During the campaign, Curb has
frequently attacked his opponent's
failure to reduce the state's crime
rate. He was the only candidate to re
ceive Paul Gann's endorsement in
1978, whose Proposition 13 was then
up for vote. Curb also promises to
dismantle present welfare programs.
The Republican gubernatorial race
has been neck-and-neck and could
go to either Curb or Deukmejian.
On the issues: "Curb initially sup
ported the Peripheral Canal, which
was expected because he is a faithful
Southern Californian. But, in Octo
ber, Curb announced he had
changed his position because, he
said, the canal project is too ex
pensive. *He hds long favored the
"Victim's Bill of Rights," making it a
key campaign issue. *Curb has been
one of Rose Bird's harshest critics,
decrying what he views are her too
liberal decisions. He wants her re
called. Curb has made this a major is
sue in his campaign because Deu
kmejian does not support a recall.
•He has not taking a position on off
shore oil drilling. *Curb favors nucle
ar power.
