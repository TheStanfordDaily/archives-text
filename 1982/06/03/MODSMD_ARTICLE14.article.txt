## Editor's note Lines written in late spring 
### 
The "Insiders" were out; theSpo Bros not about
Smith & Brown courted in other locales
The Newzeds were done; the ENTs chronicling fun
And staff writers studying for finals
On assignment was I, to look back (at least try)
On a volume of good times and fine work
To come up with a column, in a style oh so, solemn
In which numerous thanks would there lurk
All alone in the newsroom, with computerized plume;
I went digging in search of this story
But the state of the place — which was left in great haste
Warned an essay would not impress 'Cory'
My desk and my wall, told a story to all
'Bout Ireland,'nice girls,'stange requests
Pictures of the Emerald Isle, and Mom's note made me smile;
To: 'Mr. The Stanford Daily' read one address
There on the wall, the mark-ups show all
Joys and sorrows, down to the last letter
Both complaints and praise, some of styles I did raze
As good work persevered, lesser work got much better
All in all things went fine, no one got out of line
(Until Raster slipped out of his strip)
So we lost the softball game, we don't put stock in fame —
Our strengths reside in the pen tip
I was sure the VDT winked and smiled at me
As I thought of the nights when it crashed
When in mid-story, amid pain and glory
Those poor graphs were electronically slashed
I typed 'Thanks to you all' and 'good luck in the fall'
To Richard, Doug and the new team
It's a privilege you know, to be running this show
Before long you will see what I mean
Oh, the newsroom was quiet, except for the try at
Outputting the old AP machine made
How lucky I am, to have warmed chair of Sam
As Daily editor, I sighed and surveyed
To all of our readersand University leaders
Seeking informed and objective views
You won't be disappointed, with the new staff appointed;
I hope your summers bring only good news
