## On contraception controls 
### 
It is my thesis that privacy is not just one
possible means among others to insure some
other values, but that it is necessarily related to
ends and relations of the most fundamental
sort: respect, love, friendship and trust.
â€” Charles Fried, "Privacy" Yale Law Review
(1968)
The right to privacy, as Fried correctly argues,
is fundamental. Ironically, a group of citizens
frequently referred to as "fundamentalists" is
doing all it can to see that this right is infringed.
The Health and Human Services Department
(HHS) rule would require Planned Parenthood
clinics to notify within 10 days the parents of
teenagers who seek IUDs, birth control pills or
diaphragms.
Appropriately nicknamed the "squeal rule,"
the proposed edict would undoubtedly have a
chilling effect on teenagers' privacy rights well
as on the epidemic levels of teenage pregnancy.
Adolescent pregnancies are reportedly
runnning at morethanone million a year. It
seems obvious that still more teenagers would
rather run the risk of pregnancy than have their

parents find out about their sexual activity.
While the need to bridge the parent
adolescent generation gap may indeed be real,
the regulation's means of achieving this end
repudiates an even more important democratic
principle: doctor-patient confidentiality.
Furthermore, the statistical dangers of
pregnancy (both wanted and unwanted) far
outweigh the alleged dangers of birth control.
What can be expected is a
dramatic increase in abortions and unwanted
pregnancies among teenagers whose lives will
have been needlessly scarred.
Planned Parenthood, at the risk of losing $320
million in federal funding, has courageously
vowed not to comply with the rule. From its
inception, Planned Parenthood has committed
itself to providing a confidential service.
The chances of defeating the rule may be
small, but the time to speak up is now.
Otherwise, teenagers (that was us just a few
years back) will lose a dimension of freedom
that may never be recovered.
