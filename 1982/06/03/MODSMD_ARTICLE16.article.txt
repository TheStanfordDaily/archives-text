## Gun control column misfires 
### 
After reading Joyce Lucas Clark's
May 28 Viewpoint, purportedly deal
ing with handgun control, I found
myself hoping that she never has an
opportunity to sit on the bench. I
wouldn't want to be in her kangaroo
court.
In order to outrage us, Clark de
scribed an incident in which some
property of hers was stolen. She
claims to have seen a car (not, please
note, any occupants of the car) "leav
ing the scene of the crime." Later,
she and some friends "wound up de
taining the thief while the police
took an hour to arrive." Interesting
... she never mentioned having
identified the "thief" earlier, nor any
reason why the detained individual
was suspected.
Clark never commented upon
whether he was driving the car, only
her indignation that the police said
she should hope that the alleged
thief "did not sue Clark for illegal de
tainment." She solemnly intones,
"This is justice?" Of course not; in
this country, we havp a rather quaint
system known as trial by jury. Sum
mary courts-martial on the street is
not the usual way of handling crime
in the United States.
Clark also commented upon a few
particularly notorious criminal cases.
In expressing her dismay at the fact
that Juan Corona, charged with mass
murder of farm workers, was granted
a retrial (after several years behind
bars, one might add), she exclaims,
"Is there any finality to the law, even
when the offense is unspeakably hor
rible?"

She conveniently failed to mention
why Corona was granted a retrial: the
appellate court ruled that his at
torney in the original trial had grossly
misrepresented him. The attorney
was apparently more interested in
writing a sensational book about this
murder trial than in defending Coro
na. Perhaps Clark would like to
abolish the appellate courts, for this
would certainly "put some finality in
the law," an undoubted goal of hers.
Clark is also upset that "Charles
Manson is up for parole again soon."
So what?! Lots of others are going to
be considered for parole, too. One
might note that we have in the Unit
ed States, at least nominally, a Con
stitutional requirement for "equal
protection under the laws." Man
son's case is being handled under the
same laws that apply to thousands of
other felons. The fundamental issue
is not Manson perse; it is whether we
prefer a system with "equal protec
tion" to a system such as found in, for
example, the Republic (sic) of South
Africa.
Clark's longing for "finality in the
law" seems to be a disguised call for
gutting the appellate courts, impos
ing lengthy sentences without possi
bility of parole, and perhaps broad
application of the death penalty.
Whether or not we agree with these
goals, it would seem reasonable to
expect Clark to be explicit, rather
than couching her appeal in inflam
matory rhetoric.
