In the series of columns I have writ
ten for the Daily this spring, I have
concentrated almost exclusively on
nuclear power. I have raised certain
issues, such as the safety of the reac
tors, the deadly nature of radioactive
carcinogens and the problem of
long-term waste storage. I would like
in this final column to expand the
theme somewhat to address what I
see as being the broader issue of the
ecological crisis facing us.
"In just spring, the balloon man
whistles," wrote e.e. cummings, and I
would much rather compose a lyric
hymn to the beauty of the season
than point to the ' portents of
ecological catastrophe. Yet the signs
of danger are many, and they are not

even that hard to see unless you keep
your eyes tightly closed. We need to
be reminded of them occasionally.
Item: Observations from two
space agency satellites have provided
the first concrete evidence from the
field that chlorofluorocarbons —
once used as propellants in aerosol
sprays and still in widespread use in
U.S. industry — may be eating away
at the ozone layer that protects the
planet from dangerous ultraviolet ra
diation (S.F. Chronicle, Aug. 13,
1981). These findings appear to con
tradict the assertions of the chemical
industry that ozone depletion from
chlorofluorocarbons is just a theory
that has never been supported by ac
tual study of the ozone layer.
Item: In 1941 the American
petrochemical industry produced a
total of one billion pounds of syn
thetic chemical compounds. By 1977
this figure had risen to 350 billion
pounds. The industry currently pro
duces some 50,000 new chemicals,
and new compounds are added at
the rate of more than a thousand a
year. According to Environmental
Protection Agency estimates, of the
more than 77 billion pounds of sol
vents, residues and toxic by-products
generated annually by this industry,
only 10 percent are being disposed of
in an environmentally safe manner
(Sierra Club Bulletin, March/April
1981). All around the country it is
possible to find waste buried in land
fills like the ironically named Love
Canal, an abandoned waterway in
which the Hooker Chemical Com
pany dumped an estimated 20 mil

lion pounds of wastes over a 30 to 40
year period. "Back in the Old West,"
said Dr. Irving Selikoff, "they used to
hang people for poisoning wells.
Now we're doing it to ourselves."
(Selikoff is head of the Environmental
Sciences Laboratory at New York's
Mount Sinai Medical School.)
Item: The program of world wide
deforestation being carried out by
business concerns of the in
dustrialized nations threatens the ex
istence of the tropical rain forests.
These vast belts of rain forest, a
source of atmospheric oxygen as well
as plant and animal diversity, contain
an estimated three million species.
Only about 500,000 of them have
been recognized and catalogued. If
the present rate of destruction con
tinues, one million of these species
will become extinct during the next
30 years, and most of the remaining
ones in the early years of the 21st cen
tury.
Approximately 45 percent of the
medical prescriptions currently writ
ten in the United States contain at
least one product of natural plant ori
gin. Some of these threatened rain
forest plants may contain chemicals
that would help us to treat serious
diseases that are now incurable. The
loss of biological diversity in the
biosphere as a result of these extinc
tions may have incalculable conse
quences for the human species.
There is one form of scientific
knowledge which does not seem to
have permeated into the conscious
ness of most Americans or of their
government leaders. That knowl

edge, and the form of consciousness
it represents, is summed up in the fol
lowing remark by the Yale
biophysicist Hal Morowitz: "Sus
tained life under present day condi
tions is a property of an ecological
system rather than a single organism
or species."
Not only is that planetary life the
result of an ecological system, but it
is, in truth, a web whose parts are
structured into patterns of incredibly
complex interdependence. This in
sight is well summed up by the an
thropologist Gregory Bateson, who
wrote in his last book, Mind and Na
ture, "Under tension, a chain will
break at its weakest link. That much is
predictable. What is difficult is to
identify the weakest link before it
breaks."
The weakest link is not somewhere
out there in the environment. The
weakest link is in our own limitless
optimism about what our technology
is capable of. In order to survive we
will have to give up our old faith in
"more, bigger, faster." We will have
to learn to practice serious energy
conservation at the level of the large
corporation, a practice presently
almost unknown.
The approaching ecological col
lapse, perhaps a decade or two away
if we are lucky, has been posting us
clear warnings. We must learn to
change our habits of perception if we
are going to wake up in time to pre
vent it. It may already be too late.

whistles," wrote e.e. cummings, and I
would much rather compose a lyric
hymn to the beauty of the season
than point to the ' portents of
ecological catastrophe. Yet the signs
of danger are many, and they are not

even that hard to see unless you keep
your eyes tightly closed. We need to
be reminded of them occasionally.
Item: Observations from two
space agency satellites have provided
the first concrete evidence from the
field that chlorofluorocarbons —
once used as propellants in aerosol
sprays and still in widespread use in
U.S. industry — may be eating away
at the ozone layer that protects the
planet from dangerous ultraviolet ra
diation (S.F. Chronicle, Aug. 13,
1981). These findings appear to con
tradict the assertions of the chemical
industry that ozone depletion from
chlorofluorocarbons is just a theory
that has never been supported by ac
tual study of the ozone layer.
Item: In 1941 the American
petrochemical industry produced a
total of one billion pounds of syn
thetic chemical compounds. By 1977
this figure had risen to 350 billion
pounds. The industry currently pro
duces some 50,000 new chemicals,
and new compounds are added at
the rate of more than a thousand a
year. According to Environmental
Protection Agency estimates, of the
more than 77 billion pounds of sol
vents, residues and toxic by-products
generated annually by this industry,
only 10 percent are being disposed of
in an environmentally safe manner
(Sierra Club Bulletin, March/April
1981). All around the country it is
possible to find waste buried in land
fills like the ironically named Love
Canal, an abandoned waterway in
which the Hooker Chemical Com
pany dumped an estimated 20 mil

lion pounds of wastes over a 30 to 40
year period. "Back in the Old West,"
said Dr. Irving Selikoff, "they used to
hang people for poisoning wells.
Now we're doing it to ourselves."

Sciences Laboratory at New York's
Mount Sinai Medical School.)
Item: The program of world wide
deforestation being carried out by
business concerns of the in
dustrialized nations threatens the ex
istence of the tropical rain forests.
These vast belts of rain forest, a
source of atmospheric oxygen as well
as plant and animal diversity, contain
an estimated three million species.
Only about 500,000 of them have
been recognized and catalogued. If
the present rate of destruction con
tinues, one million of these species
will become extinct during the next
30 years, and most of the remaining
ones in the early years of the 21st cen
tury.
Approximately 45 percent of the
medical prescriptions currently writ
ten in the United States contain at
least one product of natural plant ori
gin. Some of these threatened rain
forest plants may contain chemicals
that would help us to treat serious
diseases that are now incurable. The
loss of biological diversity in the
biosphere as a result of these extinc
tions may have incalculable conse
quences for the human species.
There is one form of scientific
knowledge which does not seem to
have permeated into the conscious
ness of most Americans or of their
government leaders. That knowl

edge, and the form of consciousness
it represents, is summed up in the fol
lowing remark by the Yale
biophysicist Hal Morowitz: "Sus
tained life under present day condi
tions is a property of an ecological
system rather than a single organism
or species."
Not only is that planetary life the
result of an ecological system, but it
is, in truth, a web whose parts are
structured into patterns of incredibly
complex interdependence. This in
sight is well summed up by the an
thropologist Gregory Bateson, who
wrote in his last book, Mind and Na
ture, "Under tension, a chain will
break at its weakest link. That much is
predictable. What is difficult is to
identify the weakest link before it
breaks."
The weakest link is not somewhere
out there in the environment. The
weakest link is in our own limitless
optimism about what our technology
is capable of. In order to survive we
will have to give up our old faith in
"more, bigger, faster." We will have
to learn to practice serious energy
conservation at the level of the large
corporation, a practice presently
almost unknown.
The approaching ecological col
lapse, perhaps a decade or two away
if we are lucky, has been posting us
clear warnings. We must learn to
change our habits of perception if we
are going to wake up in time to pre
vent it. It may already be too late.
