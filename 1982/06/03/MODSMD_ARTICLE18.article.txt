Washington — There is no way to
verify whether the invitations are lost
in the mail or were never written in
the first place. But it looks as though,
once again, we won't deliver a com
mencement address to a single Class
of 1982.
Happily, no one loses under this
recurring arrangement. While grad
uates won't have to pretend to listen
to us, we won't have to disguise
ourselves as wise elders. We were, of
course, sad to hear that Illinois'

Eureka College opted for alumnus
Ronald Reagan instead of us (al
though hearing the president speak
on arms control is a little like listening
to Arnold Schwarzenegger talk on
sensitivity training).
Since so many seniors, however,
will be lectured on "how to change
the world" by those very folks who
are messing it up, we decided to take
steps of our own. After four years of
repetitive academic fare, seniors de
serve a break. Herewith, then, we're
introducing the "Here and Now
Speakers' Agency," an ad hoc firm
offering an alternative to the tradi
tionally oxymoronic nonsense ev
eryone dreads. Pending approval of
our clients, here are some excerpts
from our newly-published
catalogue:
Howard Putnam — Chairman and
chief executive of Braniff Interna
tional Airlines. In a speech entitled
"Free To Lose," the CEO offers words
of wisdom to interested students
about the virtues of a deregulated,
unfettered market economy. Fee:
1000 packets of smoked almonds.
Ralph Lauren — Mr. Roughwear
has an important pointer for the so
cial-conscious seniors bound for the
Big Apple: "Say, 'see you later, al
ligator' if you want to be noticed on
Madison Avenue next year." Lauren
is particularly suitable for Western
colleges in dusty settings. Note:
Client insists on caps and gowns.
Robert Young — Known to many
as Marcus Welby, M.D., this popular
father figure examines the neuroses
of an unemployable class. Excerpt:
"Hey now, why are my favorite kids
so jittery all the time?" Guaranteed to
calm nerves, especially parents'.
Mariel Hemingway — The flexible
actress, in a speech entitled "A
Farewell To Dorms," suggests that
college athletes and drama students
hold the key to getting America back
on the fast track. "A rivetting per
formance" — The New Yorker.
Lenny Skutnik — Casting aside his
noted disdain of the media, the Air
Florida crash hero advises striving ce
lebrities that a little fame means a lot
of misery. Agent's note: Skutnik re
quires time-and-a-half should he un
expectedly find himself in a double

bill with First Lady Nancy Reagan.
Orlando Jose Tardencillas
Espinoza — Recounting his own ex
periences as a double-crossing infor
mant for the U.S. State Department,
the Nicaraguan has some timely tips
for students contemplating careers in
the Foreign Service. Hold all ques
tions about communist subversion in
El Salvador, please.
Squadron Charlie, Rapid Deploy
ment Force — In full battle dress,
these aerial acrobats offer encourag
ing words to aspiring doctors in
terested in serving their country. Ti
tle: "Medical Careers in the Army:
More Bones To Pick Than Ever." No
fee (they'll jump at anything). Al
ready slated for the University of Col
orado at Parachute, when it opens.
The Go Go's — Currently topping
the rock 'n' roll charts with their
album, "Beauty and the Beat," the
queens of college she-sheness ex

musical genius to set trends and
make a mint before graduate school.
Title: "We're Pretty Neat." Fee: $0.99
list; $5.99 discount.
The NBC Peacock — In an address
entitled "Birds Like Us," this colorful
animal predicts that network coun
terparts will, having cancelled Amer
ica's favorite sitcoms, cook their own
geese. Fee: better seeds for the
Nielsens.
Jodie Foster — The undergraduate
actress rises to the occasion in a
speech refuting recent reports that
television breeds violence in young
Americans. Note: Foster's remarks
are available on videotape only.
American Telephone and Tele
graph — The mammoth multi
national Ma denounces the promis
cuous and indiscriminate behavior of
today's young in a diatribe entitled:
"The Social Costs of Reaching Out
and Touching Someone." Fee: $25
for the first three minutes.
John McEnroe — The once-and
future tennis ace, hobbled by a de
bilitating ankle injury, unmasks the
