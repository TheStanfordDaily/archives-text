San Jose - Candidates for the Republican nomination
for the U.S. Senate met fora verbal showdown Tuesday
in an attempt to garner support for the June 8 primary.
The candidates fielded questions from members of the
Santa Clara County Republican Party, which sponsored
the event, and Bay Area media representatives in a two
hour forum before 450 persons at Le Baron Hotel.
Rep. Barry Goldwater Jr. (R-Woodland Hills), con
sidered to be a frontrunner in the race, did not attend
the forum. The candidates attending were: Reps. Robert
Dornan (R-Santa Monica) and Paul "Pete" McCloskey Jr.
(R-Menlo Park), San Diego Mayor Pete Wilson, State
Sen. John Schmitz (R-Corona del Mar), Maureen Reagan
and Ted Bruinsma.
Schmitz amused the audience with witty one-liners
which played on his self-avowed right-wing con

servatism which, he said, "makes the president look like
a moderate." Schmitz's wit contrasted sharply, however,
with Wilson's harsh criticism of McCloskey.
Wilson appeared to want to cut into McCloskey's
Northern California support where McCloskey is the fa
vorite Senate candidate. A large sepment of the au
dience who were McCloskey supporters frequently
hissed at Wilson's remarks.
Wilson, McCloskey and Goldwater are considered to
be the three major contenders in the Republican Senate
race. Various public opinion polls indicate Republicans
may elect any one of the three to represent the party.
"Pete McCloskey is my favorite sparring partner,"
Wilson said. "He is a good man of decent impulses who is
too liberal to win the Republican primary."

SUPPORT FROM A COLLEAGUE — Assoc. History Prof. Clayborne Carson spoke at a rally protesting
the denial of tenure for Estelle Freedman (inset), a popular assistant professor of history and a pioneer
in the Feminist Studies Program here.

Wilson said McCloskey has fre
quently "flip-flopped" on issues, vot
ing one way then supporting issues
the other way. He particularly cited
McCloskey's vote against the Equal
Rights Ammendment in Congress in
1970. McCloskey now supports the
ERA, which Wilson also supports.
Wilson was particularly critical of
McCloskey's decision to oppose the
Peripheral Canal, a decision Mc-
Closkey announced Tuesday morn
ing in Sacramento. Wilson accused
McCloskey of joining the political
bandwagon as public opinion polls
show the measure will be defeated.
"I did not take the position less
than one week before the election,
after looking at the polls," said
Wilson, who supports the canal. "I
don't think that's leadership."
McCloskey criticized Wilson's use
of an ad by Neil Reagan, President
Ronald Reagan's brother, which
states "we Reagans" support Wilson.
McCloskey called the ads "sleazy."
Dornan and Bruinsma also
criticized Wilson on various issues -
an indication that the candidates
consider Wilson the frontrunner.
