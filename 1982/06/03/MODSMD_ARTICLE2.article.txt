San Jose - Candidates for the Republican nomination
for the U.S. Senate met fora verbal showdown Tuesday
in an attempt to garner support for the June 8 primary.
The candidates fielded questions from members of the
Santa Clara County Republican Party, which sponsored
the event, and Bay Area media representatives in a two
hour forum before 450 persons at Le Baron Hotel.
Rep. Barry Goldwater Jr. (R-Woodland Hills), con
sidered to be a frontrunner in the race, did not attend
the forum. The candidates attending were: Reps. Robert
Dornan (R-Santa Monica) and Paul "Pete" McCloskey Jr.
(R-Menlo Park), San Diego Mayor Pete Wilson, State
Sen. John Schmitz (R-Corona del Mar), Maureen Reagan
and Ted Bruinsma.
Schmitz amused the audience with witty one-liners
which played on his self-avowed right-wing con

servatism which, he said, "makes the president look like
a moderate." Schmitz's wit contrasted sharply, however,
with Wilson's harsh criticism of McCloskey.
Wilson appeared to want to cut into McCloskey's
Northern California support where McCloskey is the fa
vorite Senate candidate. A large sepment of the au
dience who were McCloskey supporters frequently
hissed at Wilson's remarks.
Wilson, McCloskey and Goldwater are considered to
be the three major contenders in the Republican Senate
race. Various public opinion polls indicate Republicans
may elect any one of the three to represent the party.
"Pete McCloskey is my favorite sparring partner,"
Wilson said. "He is a good man of decent impulses who is
too liberal to win the Republican primary."
