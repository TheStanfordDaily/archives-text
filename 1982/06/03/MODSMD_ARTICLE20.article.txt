## Viewpoint/Marc Gimbrere Nuclear energy scare: fact not fission 
### 
Jeff Phillips' ommission of
fusion energy from his list of
"types of energy" in his May 24
column "Energy values clari
fication" pin-pointed for me a
common pattern of public
opinion: the failure to break
down "nuclear" energy into its
diametrically opposed parts,
fusion and fission. Ninety per
cent of my discussions with in
telligent Stanford non-engi
neers have brought me to the
conclusion that most people
do not differentiate between
these two technologies.
Even when someone does
know the difference, I keep
hearing them uttering the
same generic phrases such as
"no nukes" and"I am anti (or
pro) nuclear power." These
two forms of nuclear energy
must not be confused, yet they
are frequently referred to as

the same technologies.
The extremely unfortunate
thing about this lack of dif
ferentiation is that, even when
criticism of fission energy is
warranted, the blanket head
ing of "nuclear" energy de
stroys fusion research just as ef
fectively as its intended target,
fission.
The best example of this is
the Three Mile Island incident.
The morass of anti-nuclear
public opinion which was gen
erated by inaccurate press cov
erage of a well-controlled situ
ation (the press failed to point
out that the shutdown fol
lowed by the design-basis.
"Loss of Coolant Accident"
procedures perfectly) has hurt
the nuclear industry — fusion
as well as fission — greatly.
Even if this criticism had
been valid, fusion energy

should not have been a victim
of the propaganda. The press
never emphasized the dif
ference between fission and
fusion; and I seriously doubt
that much of the general public
knows what kind of reactors
Three Mile Island has.
It is true that fission reactors
pose serious safety problems
(although the public has no
idea how well-designed and
tested they are). Fission-prod
uct waste disposal is an even
more serious threat. I am not a
proponent of breeder reactor
production, mainly for the lat
ter reason. Yet I do recognize,
and so should others, that a
blanket policy of nuclear
criticism inadvertently covers
fusion as well as fission.
If fusion were not such a
viable energy source for the
future, this blanket policy,
though inherently inaccurate,
would be less of a problem.
However, fusion has been the
oretically proven and is well
along the road towards realiza
tion at Princeton, Berkeley,
Lawrence Livermore, and in
the Soviet Union.
It is a technology which is
widely known in Congress:
only two years ago the Mc-
Cormack Fusion Bill of 1980
was passed, carrying a resolu
tion to accelerate fusion re
search to a pace analagous to
that of the Apollo program of
the '60s. The bill's final goal was
to have a production plant op
erating by the year 2000. Would
Congress have passed this reso
lution if they hadn't found
fusion to be a realistic energy
source? The bill was an ex
tremely big deal, yet of course
the press has done its best to
underplay it.
So because of an informed

public, this clean energy
source which will become
more and more necessary in
the years to come is being
stifled at the very point where
research should be at its peak.
This lack of limelight (not to
mention the negative anti-nu
clear propaganda) is hurting
research and, in turn, the
world.
I am convinced that even
tually fusion will be the earth's
energy source. It is clean, safe,
and unlimited. The fuel is

fusion will be the
earth's energy
source.

simple heavy hydrogen, which
can be obtained from the J
ocean or mined from the
moon. There are comparative
ly few reactive wastes. It
doesn't require strip-mining or
any negative environmental
practices. This can be said for
none of the other "potential"
energy sources.
Why should an un-informed
public, which cannot for the ■;
most part tell the difference
between an atom split and an
atom joined, be able to slow to
a snail's pace the development
of an energy which is, in my
opinion, inevitable? It is up to
the media to inform the public
of the different types of nucle
ar energy. Without public sup
port, we'll be wasting a lot of
time in the search fora new,
long term energy source.
