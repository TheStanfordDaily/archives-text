Unneeded phonebook distribution causes unrecyclable waste

During the second week of
May, 28001982-83 phonebooks
were distributed to ail student
residences. Six months ago Pa
cific Telephone promised
ASSU Recycling that no new
phonebooks would be de
livered until September of
1982.
These phonebooks are an
unacceptable waste of re
sources. Not only are they not
recyclable, but students will
use them for only four weeks
before throwing them away.
Next September, an identical
phonebook will be distributed
to every student who rents a
phone on campus. Despite
considerable protest by ASSU
Recycling, the University and
the City of Palo Alto which is
concerned about dwindling
landfill capacity, the phone
company broke their promise,
choosing to ignore this large
waste problem. Pacific Tele
phone distributes phonebooks

in this wasteful manner to ev
ery college campus in their ser
vice area, including USF, SF
State, and San Jose State.
At the present time officials
have tentatively agreed that in
the future this distribution of
phonebooks in May will not
occur. We hope to receive a
written statement of their in
tentions to prevent this unnec
essary waste problem in the
future.

Meeting of minds?
There's either some sloppy
reading or some sloppy writing
going on around this page.
Joe Walder's Viewpoint May
28 on coalition politics made
three or four basic points, and I
agree with all of them. What is
unnerving is that he wrote it as
an attack on my column of two

days before.
Walder says I stereotyped
Stanford students as greedy
and politically ignorant, wholly
different from the "idealistic"
and "giving" students of my
college days. I read my column
as a direct argument against
that image.
He has me scorning the anti
nuke movement for focusing
on what they can get out of dis
armament. I thought I was
arguing that all of our political
stands are based on what we
can get out of them. I hoped to
show how the best answers to
"What's in it for me?" lie in
progressive political action.
Was all this clear? I thought
so when I wrote the column.

Walder's response made me
read it again. I still think it's
clear. I'm resisting the urge to
bolster my case with a few sen
tences from the column, be
cause there's nothing more
boring than people who quote
themselves.
Walder's central point —
that major change in this coun
try will be the work of a broad
based coalition, not an elite,
self-styled vanguard — is
absolutely right. Coalitions
form when people realize how
much their interests nave in
common; my column was an
attempt to nudge a few people
towards that realization.
There's a discouraging irony
to this little exchange; the

prospects for popular coalition
seem especially dim when peo
ple who already agree with
each other think that they
don't.
