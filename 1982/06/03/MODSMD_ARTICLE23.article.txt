## Counselor becomes house cook 
### Sally Newman 
At mid-career, many people begin to
take stock of themselves, questioning their
achievements, perhaps rearranging their
priorities, measuring their professional
and personal fulfillment.
Juthica Stangl recognized the signs and
made about as drastic a switch as possible.
At the beginning of the year, she left a suc
cessful pscyhotherapy practice to become
the cook at American Studies House.
Though "I was so nervous the first day that
I called my husband up at work," Stangl
said she is now loving every minute of it.
A native of India, Stangl was born in Cal
cutta and lived there until she was 26. Dur
ing stays at the University of Toronto and
Yale University, she completed the
coursework necessary fora Ph.D. in psy
chotherapy. At no point, though, was she
required to cook meals fora family, let
alone a "family" with more than 50 "off
spring." "I went to British boarding
schools, where I never cooked," she said.
"As a matter of fact, before I left India I
never even boiled water."
For the next 20 years, Stangl worked as a
clinical psychotherapist. Even now, in "re
tirement," she sees four patients per week.
Fromghe warmth and caring she lavishes
on "her kids," it is evident that her skills
were readily transferable. Several weeks

ago, about a third of the house came down
with the flu at once. "So I've been making
a big pot of soup for them," she said mat
ter-of-factly.
During the 30 minutes before lunch,
about a dozen house residents dropped
into the kitchen to say hello. Some stayed
to chat, several joked about the stool
Stangl was standing on to reach the back
burners. (At four feet, 11 inches, "I some
times can't see into some of those tall
pots," she smiled.)
"I kind of cook and counsel," she said.
"Psychotherapy is a very slow process:
sometimes you see results in a few years,
sometimes not. I was tired of that after 20
years — I wanted some 'instant grat
ification' fora while, and this is it."
Kitchen counseling at the house as
sumes countless forms. "I've become kind
of an encyclopedia — kids ask me what
they should show their parents when
they're in town, or where is a good place to
buy clothes." One student, torn between
two tempting courses, asked Stangl's ad
vice. He wound up following her sugges
tion and sacrificed Linear Algebra for San
Francisco History. "So then, the next time
we went to San Francisco," Stangl recalled,
"we took him along."
By no means does the cooking suffer

during these counseling sessions, how
ever. For someone who had never cooked
in her life, Stangl became a confident cook
who now scorns canned and frozen foods
— "I make things like spaghetti sauce and
soups from scratch."
"She uses more spices than last year's
cook," observed a second-year house resi
dent, "and sometimes she tends towards
the exotic. You can bet that none of the
food is ever bland."
Stangl also owns and runs her own cater
ing business (which she operates on week
ends), and even considered opening a res
taurant of her own.
"I do too many things, that's my prob
lem," Stangl said. "But life is too short to
do only one thing." As if all of her cooking
duties aren't enough, she is currently
working on a book as well.
"There's this image of a Hindu goddess
with 10 arms; sometimes I feel like that,"
Stangl said. "I'm doing a million things at
once, at the same time trying to strike a
balance between Western and non-
Western culture."
By every indication, Stangl thrives on all
of it. So much so, in fact, that she recently
signed a contract with American Studies to
do it all again next year.
