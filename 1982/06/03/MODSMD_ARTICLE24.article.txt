# Ku Klux Klan growth tied to economic decline

• In Catonsville, Md., two Klansmen are
sentenced for conspiring to bomb a
synagogue.
• In Martinez, Calif., Klan leader
Michael Mendonsa is charged with riddl
ing a mostly black housing project with
automatic gun fire.
• Alabama Klansman Charles Mc-
Cullough is found guilty of knifing three
elderly black men.
• I n Kenner, Calif., two members of the
"Death Knights" of the Ku Klux Klan are
arrested on charges of firebombing the
home of a civil rights leader.
The Ku Klux Klan, created in 1865 in
Pulaski, Tenn. as a social fraternity for
bored Civil War veterans, has over the
years grown into a multi-faceted business
of racism and hate. While many people
still view Klansmen as Southern red necks
pre-occupied with burning crosses in
cow pastures, acts of Klan violence are
not restricted to the Deep South. In 1981
California closely followed Southern
states in the number of Klan-related inci
dents.
Membership in the Klan, which has
traditionally risen in times of economic
hardship, is today experiencing what
former U.S. Attorney General Ramsey
Clark termed a "definite resurgence."
Irwin Suall, director of the fact-finding
arm of B'nai B'rith's Anti-Defamation
League, estimated current Klan member
ship at 11,000 — up 40 percent from two
years ago and 100 percent from five years
ago. Moreover, Small estimated that the
number of Klan sympathizers has
doubled to 100,000 since 1980.
With the increase in membership has
come a noticeable increase in activity.
The Community Relations Service of the
Justice Department reported in 1980 that
it was investigating an average of 70 Klan
related cases per month — a 55 percent
increase over the previous year.
But Suall and others in watchdog posi
tions feel that the mere growth in mem
bership is not the real problem. "More
important and more dangerous is the rise
of para-military training facilities — the
main problem is not the number; the
threat is violence and terrorism," Suall
said.
Bill Wilkinson, imperial wizard of the
Invisible Empire — the most prominent of
the four nationally known factions — has
said he believes that a race war is coming
and has made elaborate preparations to
make his followers combat-ready. De
scribed as the "most militant and violence
prone" by the Justice Department,
Wilkinson has established a number of
guerilla warfare camps to prepare his
troops for the impending Armageddon.
Representative John Coyers (D-Mich.),
chairman of a House sub-committee on
crime, reported that the Klan has para-mil
itary and psychological warfare training
camps in seven different states and youth
training centers in five others. One of
these camps, named Mai Lai for the Viet
namese village where scores of civilians
were killed by U.S. troops, provides
silhouetted targets of blacks and Jews for

members to hone their marksmanship
skills.
Another para-military arm of the Klan
recently came into the national spotlight
when it was learned that war maneuvers
and kill tactics were being taught to Boy
Scouts under the pretext of "summer
camp."
The Ku Klux Klan, once aligned chiefly
against blacks and Jews, has widened the
scope of its attack to include foreign im
migrants, homosexuals, pro-abortionists
and others who do not meet the criteria
of the "super race."
Many experts have grappled with the
question of what is behind this "born
again" Klan movement — what is driving
scores to join or support a group whose
cardinal tenet is racial hatred.
Dr. Robert Ingalls, a University of South
Florida Klan expert, feels the answer is
simple. "High unemployment and spiral
ing inflation have led to the recent
growth in the Ku Klux Klan," Ingalls said.
Author Larry Gerlach, who has made
extensive studies of the KKK, said he be
lieves that the Klan effectively "capital
izes on the growing feelings of resent
ment and powerlessness by offering disaf
fected whites power, prestige and
purpose.
The answer to the question "Why the
KKK?" is perhaps explained more clearly
by those who actually belong. At a rally in
Georgia, a young Klansman said, "We
don't want the government on our backs
telling us where to live, where to work
and what to spend our money on."
In Alabama, a disgruntled steel mill
worker said, "I joined because the af
firmative action program cost me a pro
motion."
A laborer in Florida bitterly responded,
"I'm tired of working and sweating to pay
the taxes that will keep those drunken de
generates and homos in food stamps, pot
and pool halls."
Jerry Thompson, a journalist who spent
16 months undercover with the KKK said
he feels that "the average member is wor
ried about his job, his family and his
future."
Thousands of Klan sympathizers have
lent their moral, and more importantly,
their financial support to the organiza
tion. Similarly opposed to programs such
as affirmative action, de-segregation, and
open housing, these sympathizers pro
vide the Klan with the tacit support it
needs to flourish.
Feeding upon the concerns of today's
blue collar worker and exploiting tradi
tional symbols like the burning cross and
white robe, the Ku Klux Klan is currently
experiencing a renaissance.
Leaders have sought to boost the
group's public image by playing down
their racism.
"We don't hate black people. We don't
consider ourselves superior to anyone —
we just believe in racial segregation," said
Wilkinson who then quoted a Klan
slogan, "Racial purity is America's secur
ity."
"We want to get this country back to
basics, Christ, race and nation." said a

Georgia state chaplain for the Klan at a ral
ly held recently in LaGrange, Ga. We are a
legally recognized non-subversive or
ganization with no criminal accusations
against us," he said.
Despite attempts to downplay accusa
tions of racism many people still believe
as Rhonda Abrams, the San Francisco Re
gional director of the Anti-Defamation
League who recently remarked "they're
still the same old violent hate group
they've always been." It is the growing
threat of violence that has citizens and
government officials extremely worried.
Wilbert Poma, an executive with the
Justice Department in Washington, D.C.,
said that there has been"a clear trend, an
increse in serious incidents involving the
Klan" and said he "fears there will be
more violence."
Ozell Sutton, Southern regional direc
tor for the service said he believes that
"there is a greater potential for violence
because the Klan is bolder than it has
been in recent years."
While acts of violence and terrorism at
tributed to the KKK number fewer than in
the '60s — when the Klan fought against
civil rights legislation — the current up
surge is cause for alarm for many.
Minorities of previous generations
generally buckled under the pressure of
the Klan. Today, however, those who are
harassed by the KKK are more often un
willing to tolerate the abuses, insults and
intimidation without fighting back. The
tensions created by this situation have
sparked a number of violent incidents:
• In Decatur, Ala., two blacks and two
whites were gunned down in a daylight
street battle.
• In Greensboro, N.C., Klan and Nazi
members squared off with anti-racist pro
testers in a shoot-out that left five demon
strators dead.
Said one Klansman after the Green
sboro rally, "we don't believe Com
munists have a right to be on the streets of
Greensboro or anywhere else — I don't
see any difference between killing Com
munists in Vietnam or killing them over
here."
With leaders preaching of the coming
race war and avowing that his Klansmen's
personal arsenals are "not for hunting
rabbits, but for wasting people," many
members have been stirred into a fit of
blood lust. In the frightened atmosphere
of hate and impending confrontation,

many Klansmen are eagerly anticipating
the "war."
George Neil, a leader in the Alabama
chapter of Wilkinson's Invisible Empire
said "My family and I have had it! We're
going to start to fight back — we're an
empire of redblooded Americans armed
to the teeth who would rather fight than
switch!"
An anonymous member discussed last
year's murders in Atlanta and the race war
he is sure is coming: "Atlanta?" Well, lit
tle niggers grow up to be big niggers to
that's 20 less we'll have to kill someday.
The rest will either go back to Africa or be
fertilizer for our farms..."
His compatriot, who also refused to be
identified, added hisfeelings on the"Jew
ish problem": "What we need is a final
solution — I'm not going to lay up my
robe until the last Jew is deported to
Palestine or executed."

T/ie real answer to racist
groups is to organize
enough people with
a good hatred of them and
smash the group — just
beat the fire out
of them/

As Klan organizers continue to exploit
the issues of segregation, reverse dis
crimination and affirmative action, they
are likely to attract a number of new
members.
There are a number of anti-racist
groups, however, which work to contain
the violence and harassment directed
against minorities by the KKK.
The Anti-Defamation League is the
oldest of the watchdog organizations and
has been monitoring extremist groups
since 1913. The staff observes and records
Klan activity while charting trends in
membership growth.
Klan Alert, a branch of the National As
sociation for the Advancement of Col
ored People, uses a three-pronged attack
in its fight against the Klan. They are now
lobbying to get President Ronald Reagan
to establish a presidential committee to

investigate "domestic terrorism in the
United States" and promoting legislation
that would prohibit para-military opera
tions. The groups also coordinate voter
registration and opposition whenever a
Klan member or Nazi seeks public office.
International Committee Against Ra
cism (InCAR) takes a more confronta
tional approach in its fight against the
Klan. Its leader, who prefers to remain
anonymous, believes strongly that "the
real answer to racist groups is to organize
enough people with a good hatred of
them and smash the group — just beat the
fire out of them." InCAR activists have
been involved with several confronta
tions with Klan members and are re
garded as a source of trouble by most law
enforcement agencies.
KLANWATCH, a project of the South
ern Poverty Law Center in Montgomery,
Ala., keeps extensive files on Klan mem
bers and Nazis and monitors more than
13,000 publications for racist activities.
Staff members work with photographs
and videotapes to assist police in the iden
tification of KKK leaders.
The main thrust of the project, how
ever, is legal intervention. Center at
torneys have filed a number of lawsuits
against the Klan hoping to weaken the
group by exposing their activities in court
and keeping them embroiled in costly le
gal battles. "Make no mistake," said cen
ter director Randall Williams. "We intend
to put the Klan out of business."
Can the Klan be "put out of business?"
Probably not for good, believe most ex
perts. But individuals can play a signifi
cant part in undermining the power of ra
cist groups according to the board of
Evangelicals for Social Action. "One rea
son the Klan is thriving is because of the
apathy and silence of the community at
large."
An in-depth report conducted by staff
members of the Nashville Tennessean
daily newspaper concluded that "the
Klan is most dangerous when it is left
alone and its leaders can spew their racist
venom unchallenged — that is when the
Klan can poison a community and the
country."

the Klan. Today, however, those who are
harassed by the KKK are more often un
willing to tolerate the abuses, insults and
intimidation without fighting back. The
tensions created by this situation have
sparked a number of violent incidents:
• In Decatur, Ala., two blacks and two
whites were gunned down in a daylight
street battle.
• In Greensboro, N.C., Klan and Nazi
members squared off with anti-racist pro
testers in a shoot-out that left five demon
strators dead.
Said one Klansman after the Green
sboro rally, "we don't believe Com
munists have a right to be on the streets of
Greensboro or anywhere else — I don't
see any difference between killing Com
munists in Vietnam or killing them over
here."
With leaders preaching of the coming
race war and avowing that his Klansmen's
personal arsenals are "not for hunting
rabbits, but for wasting people," many
members have been stirred into a fit of
blood lust. In the frightened atmosphere
of hate and impending confrontation,

many Klansmen are eagerly anticipating
the "war."
George Neil, a leader in the Alabama
chapter of Wilkinson's Invisible Empire
said "My family and I have had it! We're
going to start to fight back — we're an
empire of redblooded Americans armed
to the teeth who would rather fight than
switch!"
An anonymous member discussed last
year's murders in Atlanta and the race war
he is sure is coming: "Atlanta?" Well, lit
tle niggers grow up to be big niggers to
that's 20 less we'll have to kill someday.
The rest will either go back to Africa or be
fertilizer for our farms..."
His compatriot, who also refused to be
identified, added hisfeelings on the"Jew
ish problem": "What we need is a final
solution — I'm not going to lay up my
robe until the last Jew is deported to
Palestine or executed."

As Klan organizers continue to exploit
the issues of segregation, reverse dis
crimination and affirmative action, they
are likely to attract a number of new
members.
There are a number of anti-racist
groups, however, which work to contain
the violence and harassment directed
against minorities by the KKK.
The Anti-Defamation League is the
oldest of the watchdog organizations and
has been monitoring extremist groups
since 1913. The staff observes and records
Klan activity while charting trends in
membership growth.
Klan Alert, a branch of the National As
sociation for the Advancement of Col
ored People, uses a three-pronged attack
in its fight against the Klan. They are now
lobbying to get President Ronald Reagan
to establish a presidential committee to

investigate "domestic terrorism in the
United States" and promoting legislation
that would prohibit para-military opera
tions. The groups also coordinate voter
registration and opposition whenever a
Klan member or Nazi seeks public office.
International Committee Against Ra
cism (InCAR) takes a more confronta
tional approach in its fight against the
Klan. Its leader, who prefers to remain
anonymous, believes strongly that "the
real answer to racist groups is to organize
enough people with a good hatred of
them and smash the group — just beat the
fire out of them." InCAR activists have
been involved with several confronta
tions with Klan members and are re
garded as a source of trouble by most law
enforcement agencies.
KLANWATCH, a project of the South
ern Poverty Law Center in Montgomery,
Ala., keeps extensive files on Klan mem
bers and Nazis and monitors more than
13,000 publications for racist activities.
Staff members work with photographs
and videotapes to assist police in the iden
tification of KKK leaders.
The main thrust of the project, how
ever, is legal intervention. Center at
torneys have filed a number of lawsuits
against the Klan hoping to weaken the
group by exposing their activities in court
and keeping them embroiled in costly le
gal battles. "Make no mistake," said cen
ter director Randall Williams. "We intend
to put the Klan out of business."
Can the Klan be "put out of business?"
Probably not for good, believe most ex
perts. But individuals can play a signifi
cant part in undermining the power of ra
cist groups according to the board of
Evangelicals for Social Action. "One rea
son the Klan is thriving is because of the
apathy and silence of the community at
large."
An in-depth report conducted by staff
members of the Nashville Tennessean
daily newspaper concluded that "the
Klan is most dangerous when it is left
alone and its leaders can spew their racist
venom unchallenged — that is when the
Klan can poison a community and the
country."

KLAN GUARD — Members of the Ku Klux Klan guard Bill Wilkinson, imperial wizard of the Invisible Empire,
following a Klan function. Wilkinson is said to command a number of guerrilla warfare camps which await a Klan
predicted race war.
• In Catonsville, Md., two Klansmen are
sentenced for conspiring to bomb a
synagogue.
• In Martinez, Calif., Klan leader
Michael Mendonsa is charged with riddl
ing a mostly black housing project with
automatic gun fire.
• Alabama Klansman Charles Mc-
Cullough is found guilty of knifing three
elderly black men.
• I n Kenner, Calif., two members of the
"Death Knights" of the Ku Klux Klan are
arrested on charges of firebombing the
home of a civil rights leader.
The Ku Klux Klan, created in 1865 in
Pulaski, Tenn. as a social fraternity for
bored Civil War veterans, has over the
years grown into a multi-faceted business
of racism and hate. While many people
still view Klansmen as Southern red necks
pre-occupied with burning crosses in
cow pastures, acts of Klan violence are
not restricted to the Deep South. In 1981
California closely followed Southern
states in the number of Klan-related inci
dents.
Membership in the Klan, which has
traditionally risen in times of economic
hardship, is today experiencing what
former U.S. Attorney General Ramsey
Clark termed a "definite resurgence."
Irwin Suall, director of the fact-finding
arm of B'nai B'rith's Anti-Defamation
League, estimated current Klan member
ship at 11,000 — up 40 percent from two
years ago and 100 percent from five years
ago. Moreover, Small estimated that the
number of Klan sympathizers has
doubled to 100,000 since 1980.
With the increase in membership has
come a noticeable increase in activity.
The Community Relations Service of the
Justice Department reported in 1980 that
it was investigating an average of 70 Klan
related cases per month — a 55 percent
increase over the previous year.
But Suall and others in watchdog posi
tions feel that the mere growth in mem
bership is not the real problem. "More
important and more dangerous is the rise
of para-military training facilities — the
main problem is not the number; the
threat is violence and terrorism," Suall
said.
Bill Wilkinson, imperial wizard of the
Invisible Empire — the most prominent of
the four nationally known factions — has
said he believes that a race war is coming
and has made elaborate preparations to
make his followers combat-ready. De
scribed as the "most militant and violence
prone" by the Justice Department,
Wilkinson has established a number of
guerilla warfare camps to prepare his
troops for the impending Armageddon.
Representative John Coyers (D-Mich.),
chairman of a House sub-committee on
crime, reported that the Klan has para-mil
itary and psychological warfare training
camps in seven different states and youth
training centers in five others. One of
these camps, named Mai Lai for the Viet
namese village where scores of civilians
were killed by U.S. troops, provides
silhouetted targets of blacks and Jews for

members to hone their marksmanship
skills.
Another para-military arm of the Klan
recently came into the national spotlight
when it was learned that war maneuvers
and kill tactics were being taught to Boy
Scouts under the pretext of "summer
camp."
The Ku Klux Klan, once aligned chiefly
against blacks and Jews, has widened the
scope of its attack to include foreign im
migrants, homosexuals, pro-abortionists
and others who do not meet the criteria
of the "super race."
Many experts have grappled with the
question of what is behind this "born
again" Klan movement — what is driving
scores to join or support a group whose
cardinal tenet is racial hatred.
Dr. Robert Ingalls, a University of South
Florida Klan expert, feels the answer is
simple. "High unemployment and spiral
ing inflation have led to the recent
growth in the Ku Klux Klan," Ingalls said.
Author Larry Gerlach, who has made
extensive studies of the KKK, said he be
lieves that the Klan effectively "capital
izes on the growing feelings of resent
ment and powerlessness by offering disaf
fected whites power, prestige and
purpose.
The answer to the question "Why the
KKK?" is perhaps explained more clearly
by those who actually belong. At a rally in
Georgia, a young Klansman said, "We
don't want the government on our backs
telling us where to live, where to work
and what to spend our money on."
In Alabama, a disgruntled steel mill
worker said, "I joined because the af
firmative action program cost me a pro
motion."
A laborer in Florida bitterly responded,
"I'm tired of working and sweating to pay
the taxes that will keep those drunken de
generates and homos in food stamps, pot
and pool halls."
Jerry Thompson, a journalist who spent
16 months undercover with the KKK said
he feels that "the average member is wor
ried about his job, his family and his
future."
Thousands of Klan sympathizers have
lent their moral, and more importantly,
their financial support to the organiza
tion. Similarly opposed to programs such
as affirmative action, de-segregation, and
open housing, these sympathizers pro
vide the Klan with the tacit support it
needs to flourish.
Feeding upon the concerns of today's
blue collar worker and exploiting tradi
tional symbols like the burning cross and
white robe, the Ku Klux Klan is currently
experiencing a renaissance.
Leaders have sought to boost the
group's public image by playing down
their racism.
"We don't hate black people. We don't
consider ourselves superior to anyone —
we just believe in racial segregation," said
Wilkinson who then quoted a Klan
slogan, "Racial purity is America's secur
ity."
"We want to get this country back to
basics, Christ, race and nation." said a

Georgia state chaplain for the Klan at a ral
ly held recently in LaGrange, Ga. We are a
legally recognized non-subversive or
ganization with no criminal accusations
against us," he said.
Despite attempts to downplay accusa
tions of racism many people still believe
as Rhonda Abrams, the San Francisco Re
gional director of the Anti-Defamation
League who recently remarked "they're
still the same old violent hate group
they've always been." It is the growing
threat of violence that has citizens and
government officials extremely worried.
Wilbert Poma, an executive with the
Justice Department in Washington, D.C.,
said that there has been"a clear trend, an
increse in serious incidents involving the
Klan" and said he "fears there will be
more violence."
Ozell Sutton, Southern regional direc
tor for the service said he believes that
"there is a greater potential for violence
because the Klan is bolder than it has
been in recent years."
While acts of violence and terrorism at
tributed to the KKK number fewer than in
the '60s — when the Klan fought against
civil rights legislation — the current up
surge is cause for alarm for many.
Minorities of previous generations
generally buckled under the pressure of
the Klan. Today, however, those who are
harassed by the KKK are more often un
willing to tolerate the abuses, insults and
intimidation without fighting back. The
tensions created by this situation have
sparked a number of violent incidents:
• In Decatur, Ala., two blacks and two
whites were gunned down in a daylight
street battle.
• In Greensboro, N.C., Klan and Nazi
members squared off with anti-racist pro
testers in a shoot-out that left five demon
strators dead.

sboro rally, "we don't believe Com

see any difference between killing Com
munists in Vietnam or killing them over

doubled to 100,000 since 1980.
With the increase in membership has
come a noticeable increase in activity.
The Community Relations Service of the
Justice Department reported in 1980 that
it was investigating an average of 70 Klan
related cases per month — a 55 percent
increase over the previous year.
But Suall and others in watchdog posi
tions feel that the mere growth in mem
bership is not the real problem. "More
important and more dangerous is the rise
of para-military training facilities — the
main problem is not the number; the
threat is violence and terrorism," Suall
said.
Bill Wilkinson, imperial wizard of the
Invisible Empire — the most prominent of
the four nationally known factions — has
said he believes that a race war is coming
and has made elaborate preparations to
make his followers combat-ready. De
scribed as the "most militant and violence
prone" by the Justice Department,
Wilkinson has established a number of
guerilla warfare camps to prepare his
troops for the impending Armageddon.
Representative John Coyers (D-Mich.),
chairman of a House sub-committee on
crime, reported that the Klan has para-mil
itary and psychological warfare training
camps in seven different states and youth
training centers in five others. One of
these camps, named Mai Lai for the Viet
namese village where scores of civilians
were killed by U.S. troops, provides
silhouetted targets of blacks and Jews for

members to hone their marksmanship
skills.
Another para-military arm of the Klan
recently came into the national spotlight
when it was learned that war maneuvers
and kill tactics were being taught to Boy
Scouts under the pretext of "summer
camp."
The Ku Klux Klan, once aligned chiefly
against blacks and Jews, has widened the
scope of its attack to include foreign im
migrants, homosexuals, pro-abortionists
and others who do not meet the criteria
of the "super race."
Many experts have grappled with the
question of what is behind this "born
again" Klan movement — what is driving
scores to join or support a group whose
cardinal tenet is racial hatred.
Dr. Robert Ingalls, a University of South
Florida Klan expert, feels the answer is
simple. "High unemployment and spiral
ing inflation have led to the recent
growth in the Ku Klux Klan," Ingalls said.
Author Larry Gerlach, who has made
extensive studies of the KKK, said he be
lieves that the Klan effectively "capital
izes on the growing feelings of resent
ment and powerlessness by offering disaf
fected whites power, prestige and
purpose.
The answer to the question "Why the
KKK?" is perhaps explained more clearly
by those who actually belong. At a rally in
Georgia, a young Klansman said, "We
don't want the government on our backs
telling us where to live, where to work
and what to spend our money on."
In Alabama, a disgruntled steel mill
worker said, "I joined because the af
firmative action program cost me a pro
motion."
A laborer in Florida bitterly responded,
"I'm tired of working and sweating to pay
the taxes that will keep those drunken de
generates and homos in food stamps, pot
and pool halls."
Jerry Thompson, a journalist who spent
16 months undercover with the KKK said
he feels that "the average member is wor
ried about his job, his family and his
future."
Thousands of Klan sympathizers have
lent their moral, and more importantly,
their financial support to the organiza
tion. Similarly opposed to programs such
as affirmative action, de-segregation, and
open housing, these sympathizers pro
vide the Klan with the tacit support it
needs to flourish.
Feeding upon the concerns of today's
blue collar worker and exploiting tradi
tional symbols like the burning cross and
white robe, the Ku Klux Klan is currently
experiencing a renaissance.
Leaders have sought to boost the
group's public image by playing down
their racism.
"We don't hate black people. We don't
consider ourselves superior to anyone —
we just believe in racial segregation," said
Wilkinson who then quoted a Klan
slogan, "Racial purity is America's secur
ity."
"We want to get this country back to
basics, Christ, race and nation." said a

Georgia state chaplain for the Klan at a ral
ly held recently in LaGrange, Ga. We are a
legally recognized non-subversive or
ganization with no criminal accusations
against us," he said.
Despite attempts to downplay accusa
tions of racism many people still believe
as Rhonda Abrams, the San Francisco Re
gional director of the Anti-Defamation
League who recently remarked "they're
still the same old violent hate group
they've always been." It is the growing
threat of violence that has citizens and
government officials extremely worried.
Wilbert Poma, an executive with the
Justice Department in Washington, D.C.,
said that there has been"a clear trend, an
increse in serious incidents involving the
Klan" and said he "fears there will be
more violence."
Ozell Sutton, Southern regional direc
tor for the service said he believes that
"there is a greater potential for violence
because the Klan is bolder than it has
been in recent years."
While acts of violence and terrorism at
tributed to the KKK number fewer than in
the '60s — when the Klan fought against
civil rights legislation — the current up
surge is cause for alarm for many.
Minorities of previous generations
generally buckled under the pressure of
the Klan. Today, however, those who are
harassed by the KKK are more often un
willing to tolerate the abuses, insults and
intimidation without fighting back. The
tensions created by this situation have
sparked a number of violent incidents:
• In Decatur, Ala., two blacks and two
whites were gunned down in a daylight
street battle.
• In Greensboro, N.C., Klan and Nazi
members squared off with anti-racist pro
testers in a shoot-out that left five demon
strators dead.
Said one Klansman after the Green
sboro rally, "we don't believe Com
munists have a right to be on the streets of
Greensboro or anywhere else — I don't
see any difference between killing Com
munists in Vietnam or killing them over
here."
With leaders preaching of the coming
race war and avowing that his Klansmen's
personal arsenals are "not for hunting
rabbits, but for wasting people," many
members have been stirred into a fit of
blood lust. In the frightened atmosphere
of hate and impending confrontation,

many Klansmen are eagerly anticipating
the "war."
George Neil, a leader in the Alabama
chapter of Wilkinson's Invisible Empire
said "My family and I have had it! We're
going to start to fight back — we're an
empire of redblooded Americans armed
to the teeth who would rather fight than
switch!"
An anonymous member discussed last
year's murders in Atlanta and the race war
he is sure is coming: "Atlanta?" Well, lit
tle niggers grow up to be big niggers to
that's 20 less we'll have to kill someday.
The rest will either go back to Africa or be
fertilizer for our farms..."
His compatriot, who also refused to be
identified, added hisfeelings on the"Jew
ish problem": "What we need is a final
solution — I'm not going to lay up my
robe until the last Jew is deported to
Palestine or executed."

T/ie real answer to racist
groups is to organize
enough people with
a good hatred of them and
smash the group — just
beat the fire out
of them/

As Klan organizers continue to exploit
the issues of segregation, reverse dis
crimination and affirmative action, they
are likely to attract a number of new
members.
There are a number of anti-racist
groups, however, which work to contain
the violence and harassment directed
against minorities by the KKK.
The Anti-Defamation League is the
oldest of the watchdog organizations and
has been monitoring extremist groups
since 1913. The staff observes and records
Klan activity while charting trends in
membership growth.
Klan Alert, a branch of the National As
sociation for the Advancement of Col
ored People, uses a three-pronged attack
in its fight against the Klan. They are now
lobbying to get President Ronald Reagan
to establish a presidential committee to

investigate "domestic terrorism in the
United States" and promoting legislation
that would prohibit para-military opera
tions. The groups also coordinate voter
registration and opposition whenever a
Klan member or Nazi seeks public office.
International Committee Against Ra
cism (InCAR) takes a more confronta
tional approach in its fight against the
Klan. Its leader, who prefers to remain
anonymous, believes strongly that "the
real answer to racist groups is to organize
enough people with a good hatred of
them and smash the group — just beat the
fire out of them." InCAR activists have
been involved with several confronta
tions with Klan members and are re
garded as a source of trouble by most law
enforcement agencies.
KLANWATCH, a project of the South
ern Poverty Law Center in Montgomery,
Ala., keeps extensive files on Klan mem
bers and Nazis and monitors more than
13,000 publications for racist activities.
Staff members work with photographs
and videotapes to assist police in the iden
tification of KKK leaders.
The main thrust of the project, how
ever, is legal intervention. Center at
torneys have filed a number of lawsuits
against the Klan hoping to weaken the
group by exposing their activities in court
and keeping them embroiled in costly le
gal battles. "Make no mistake," said cen
ter director Randall Williams. "We intend
to put the Klan out of business."
Can the Klan be "put out of business?"
Probably not for good, believe most ex
perts. But individuals can play a signifi
cant part in undermining the power of ra
cist groups according to the board of
Evangelicals for Social Action. "One rea
son the Klan is thriving is because of the
apathy and silence of the community at
large."
An in-depth report conducted by staff
members of the Nashville Tennessean
daily newspaper concluded that "the
Klan is most dangerous when it is left
alone and its leaders can spew their racist
venom unchallenged — that is when the
Klan can poison a community and the
country."

KLAN GUARD — Members of the Ku Klux Klan guard Bill Wilkinson, imperial wizard of the Invisible Empire,
following a Klan function. Wilkinson is said to command a number of guerrilla warfare camps which await a Klan
predicted race war.
• In Catonsville, Md., two Klansmen are
sentenced for conspiring to bomb a
synagogue.
• In Martinez, Calif., Klan leader
Michael Mendonsa is charged with riddl
ing a mostly black housing project with
automatic gun fire.
• Alabama Klansman Charles Mc-
Cullough is found guilty of knifing three
elderly black men.
• I n Kenner, Calif., two members of the
"Death Knights" of the Ku Klux Klan are
arrested on charges of firebombing the
home of a civil rights leader.
The Ku Klux Klan, created in 1865 in
Pulaski, Tenn. as a social fraternity for
bored Civil War veterans, has over the
years grown into a multi-faceted business
of racism and hate. While many people
still view Klansmen as Southern red necks
pre-occupied with burning crosses in
cow pastures, acts of Klan violence are
not restricted to the Deep South. In 1981
California closely followed Southern
states in the number of Klan-related inci
dents.
Membership in the Klan, which has
traditionally risen in times of economic
hardship, is today experiencing what
former U.S. Attorney General Ramsey
Clark termed a "definite resurgence."
Irwin Suall, director of the fact-finding
arm of B'nai B'rith's Anti-Defamation
League, estimated current Klan member
ship at 11,000 — up 40 percent from two
years ago and 100 percent from five years
ago. Moreover, Small estimated that the
number of Klan sympathizers has
doubled to 100,000 since 1980.
With the increase in membership has
