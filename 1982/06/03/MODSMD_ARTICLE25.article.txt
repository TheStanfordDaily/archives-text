# Stanford author's new book revisits the tumultuous sixties
## 
### Jiri Weiss 
In 1964 David Harris made national
headlines by becoming Stanford's
first radical student body president in
a surprise landslide election on a
campus dominated by fraternity poli
tics. His hair was long by early '60s
standards and he spoke about the
Vietnam war and civil rights and
called for more liberal policies by the
University administration. At the be
ginning of his term, members of the
Delta Tau Delta house lured him into
a trap and shaved his head clean.
In the same year Dennis Sweeney
emerged as a civil rights hero on the
Stanford campus. Together with a
student group from Yale, Sweeney,
then a sophomore, and 12 others
from Stanford and had gone to or
ganize the black electorate in Missis
sippi in October of the previous year.
Six of the "Yalies" were arrested
within 36 hours of reaching the state.
Several were beaten up by local red
necks while police looked on.
The Stanford students met a similar
fate. One white police officer in Jack
son told a Stanford student: "You can
live with niggers if you want to, but

not in Mississippi."
The mentor of both young men
was Allard Lowenstein, who at 36 was
sometimes referred to as "the
world's oldest student leader." He
had been a dean at the University
only a few years earlier. Hired to "liv
en up" Stern Hall where nobody
wanted to live, Lowenstein was
forced to resign after siding with stu
dents against the administration. He
was now campaigning for civil rights
full-time through his network of pro
tegees. Sweeney was his most prom
ising one.
In the morning, March 14,1980, —
with the '60s far behind them — Den
nis Sweeney took a seat in Rep. Low
enstein's Manhattan office. He was
later described as "expressionless"
and "calm."
Lowenstein eventually came out,
greeted Dennis with a smile and a
handshake, led him into his private
office and closed the door behind
them. When Sweeney left just as
calmly as he had entered, Lowenstein
was lying on the floor bleeding pro
fusely — he had been shot seven
times. His heart had two huge holes

in it, one lung was irreparably
mangled, his left arm broken.
"He's been controlling my mind
for years," Sweeney told his inter
rogators after his arrest, "Now I've
put an end to it."
In his new book Dreams Die Hard
author Harris has tried to piece to
gether the clues that lead Sweeney
from his brilliant career as activist in
the '60s to his madness — diagnosed
as paranoid schizophrenia — and
Lowenstein's tragic death.
But the book is also a personal his
tory by someone who knew both
men intimately and shared their vi
sion of "a better world," a world of
racial equality and peace.
In the backdrop are the '60s — a
time when a female student could
get expelled for leaving herself "de
fenseless in the presence of a man,"
and the student body president
could get reprimanded for support
ing the license renewal for the
Berkeley radio station KPFA, accord
ing to Harris. But it was also a time of
heated debate between those like
Harris who supported defiance of the
government through draft resistance

— Harris spent 20 months in jail —
and those who believed, like Low
enstein, in working "within the sys
tem."
Harris told the Daily in a recent in
terview that there were no signs of
madness in Sweeney in his activist
years. "Dennis was the reality factor,
the guy that kept everybody's feet on
the ground," Harris said reclining on
his chair, hands clasping a coffee cup.
Sweeney was "an extraordinary
person," Harris continued, because
of his personal courage. He was the
first person to go to Mississippi and
the principal organizer of the 1964
Mississippi Summer Project. Two
days after Sweeney got to the town of
McComb where "the hottest action"
was happening, the house where he
was working was blown up, Harris re
called. A similar voter education
project had been ruthlessly dis
persed only years earlier.
"Two thirds of the firebombing
that happened in the state in 1964
happened around that city, " Harris
said.

But there were "loose ends" in
Sweeney's personality even then, he
continued. Sweeney had been raised
by his mother and was without a
father till his teens. Sweeney also felt
"out of place"at Stanford because of
his working-class background.
"One of Dennis's dilemmas as a
human being was finding avenues of
expression. He was the kind of per
son who kept a great deal inside
himself, and it was not hard for me to
picture him as suicidal but not
homicidal — he was not a violent
person," Harris said.
Later, "Dennis became obsessed
with images of manipulation and
control. When he went mad the
voices in his head began consolidat
ing into Lowenstein's voice."
Harris argues that a major con
tributing factor to Sweeney's de
terioration was his disillusionment
with his mentor, primarily because of
sexual advances Lowenstein made
toward him in 1964.
