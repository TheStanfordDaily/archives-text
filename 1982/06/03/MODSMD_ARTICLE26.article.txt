# Herpes
## Sex-linked disease reaches epidemic levels nationwide 
### Gwen Richards 
Such nasty words as syphilis and gonor
rhea are more likely to evoke the image of
a cheap and squalid bar in Tijuana or a dir
ty alley in eighteenth century Soho than
of the Roble Casino Party or Splendor on
the Grass. These diseases seem to be non
existent at Stanford, according to Ellen
Pilling, nurse practitioner at Cowell. "We
have a clean campus," joked Pilling.
Yet herpes simplex virus 2, a con
tagious, painful and potentially harmful
venereal disease, is not unknown at Stan
ford, and on the national scale has
reached epidemic proportions. Na
tionwide estimates of new cases range be
tween 100,000 and 500,000 annually. Dr.
Marcus Conant at the University of Cali
fornia-San Francisco has surmised that as
much as 30 percent of today's young, sex
ually-active population may have genital
herpes, and others have described the
disease as more rampant than the com
mon cold. And unlike syphilis or gonor
rhea, no cure has yet been found for
herpes.
The above description sounds fright
ening, but although the gravity of the dis
ease should be recognized, herpes is
something which can be coped with and
even prevented. How does one contract
herpes? What are its symptoms? How
dangerous is it? How can one avoid catch
ing it? Knowing the answers to these
questions may help lessen one's risk of
contracting herpes, and may also erase
part of the social stigma commonly at
tached to VD.
First, herpes 2 is usually, but not always,
contracted through sexual intercourse. It
may also be transmitted from one partner
to the other through oral sex, and even
through manual stimulation. However, in
the last two cases, the disease will only be
transmitted from the genital area to the

mouth or hands, or vice versa. Although
herpes 2 is generally associated with the
genitals, and herpes 1 with the mouth (the
latter characterized by "cold sores"), they
are interchangeable. The difference be
tween 1 and 2 is more important to wom
en: only herpes 2 in the genital area may
cause cervical cancer; herpes 2 on the
mouth or herpes 1 in either area will not.
Surprisingly, herpes may develop from
causes other than sexual activity. Dr. John
Dorman at Cowell explained that some
people actually have the virus lying dor
mant in their nervous systems. He cited
the case of a woman whose previously
dormant herpes was reactivated by the
sun, and he mentioned emotional stress
as another trigger factor. Dorman claims
that some people may become self-in
fected; thus, one person's contraction of
herpes is not necessarily proof of infideli
ty to his or her partner.

What are the symptoms of herpes? Af
ter the initial exposure to the disease,
from four to 12 days should pass before
the first symptoms appear. There is an in
itial tingling or itching sensation, fol
lowed by the formation of a pimple. This
then turns into a blister, which upon
bursting causes a painful sore that may
last from several days to two or three
weeks. During this time, the person is
contagious.
The physical dangers of the disease are
more apparent in women, although
blindness is a possible complication in
both sexes. Dorman said that the lesions
are especially painful in women, and that
the risks of cervical cancer are increased
by the presence of the herpes virus type 2.
A serious risk is also involved during
childbirth. A latent infection will not en
danger the baby's health, yet an active in
fection during labor may kill or per
manently damage the newborn child.
According to A. Waller Hastings writing
in Sexual Medicine Today, "the only risk
is that the baby may acquire an infection
as it passes through the birth canal during
active infection. Half of the babies whose
mothers have an outbreak will contract
the disease. Half of the babies who con
tract it will die. Two-thirds of those who
live will have serious brain and nerve
damage."
Dorman suggested a Caesarian as a pos
sible solution in the face of an active in
fection during labor. Fortunately, an out
break of herpes is physically manifested
in both men and women in the form of
lesions on the genital area.
As for the psychological damage result
ing from herpes, this varies widely with
the individual. According to Dr. Vincent
D'Andrea of Cowell's Psychological Ser
vices, most people handle the disease on
their own rather than seeking counseling.

He has talked with several herpes-in
flicted students, two of whom expressed
feelings of depression and sexual/social
inferiority. One male student said that
even during periods of latent infection,
when he knew he was not contagious, his
fear of spreading the disease was so great
that it occasionally made him impotent.

'Yef herpes simplex virus 2,
a contagious, painful and
potentially harmful
disease, is not unknown at
Stanford, and on the
national scale has reached
epidemic proportions.
Nationwide estimates of
new cases range between
100,000 andsoo,ooo
annually.. /

However, D'Andrea stressed the fact
that none of these students had originally
sought his help because of herpes. Each
patient had been seeing him for other
reasons, and the fact that they had herpes
eventually came up. "It was by no means
their major problem," said D'Andrea.
Apparently, most students do cope
with the emotional aspects of herpes on
their own. D'Andrea has only counseled
three herpes-inflicted students, yet 32
cases of the disease have been diagnosed
at Cowell since the beginning of January
(four in January, five in February, seven in
March, 12 in April and four in the first
three weeks of May). These 32 students
were positively diagnosed as having

herpes out of a total of 64 persons who
had herpes cultures taken.
How can one prevent the spread of this
disease, other than through complete
abstinence on the part of herpes patients?
First, the patient is only contagious during
an outbreak; this is the period of active in
fection, which is physically apparent in
the form of sores on the genital areas.
Second, warning a current or potential
partner that one has herpes can prevent
the disease from spreading without nec
essarily scaring off the other person. One
student here said that his former girl
friend once told him she had herpes.
"Rather than ending the relationship," he
said, "we were just very, very careful." He
claimed that the disease was not a factor
in their eventual break-up, and that he
would not let his fear of contracting
herpes get in the way of future rela
tionships.
There are differing viewson whetheror
not it is safe for herpes patients to engage
in sexual activity during periods of active
infection. The consensus at Berkeley's
Student Health Center is that one should
practice abstinence during these periods.
At Stanford, however, D'Andrea and
Dorman believe that the use of two con
doms and spermicidal foam can prevent
the disease from spreading to the non-in
fected partner. Apparently, the foam acts
as a shield â€” it prevents the virus from en
tering the cell, but does not kill it.
Dorman mentioned that a new medica
tion, Acyclovir, has been used during the
past two months in treating herpes pa
tients. It has been effective in diminishing
both the length and discomfort of an out
break. However, it is not yet known if this
is a possible cure for herpes, as it has only
been tested on people who have just re
cently contracted the disease.
