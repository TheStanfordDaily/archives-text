# Campus presses move right, may indicate national trend
## 
### Jeff Biddulph 
Ronald Reagan completed a landslide vic
tory in the 1980 presidential campaign, start
ing what many predict will be a national trend
of conservatism.
Six months later three right-wing publica
tions began operation: the Stanford Conser
vative Review, The Williams College Re
publican, and The (Columbia University)
Morningside Review. Similar conservative
periodicals already existed at Dartmouth,
Harvard, Yale, Princeton and the Claremont
Colleges.
Six months later the Harbinger, a
Dartmouth paper which declares its main ob
jective is to provide a liberal alternative to
The Dartmouth Review, the largest of the
conservative campus publications, began op
eration.
In March this year, the daily newspapers at
seven of the eight Ivy League schools issued a
resolution calling for the end of all military
support for then-President of El Salvador Jose
Napoleon Duarte's regime and called fora
commitment that the United States will not
send troops to the Central American country.
In mid-May, The Dartmouth Review was
condemned as racist and sexist by the Under
graduate Council and censured by an over
whelming vote by the faculty.
Are college campuses, once the bastion of
radicalism, beginning to reflect this national
conservative trend, or are they riding a roll
ercoaster in reaction to this conservatism?
There seems to be no definitive answer, but
it is clear that campus publications are be
coming an interesting, if not accurate, gauge
of public reaction.
Peter Maillet, one of the founders of the
Stanford Conservative Review, sees a definite
national conservative trend, but does not see
it reflected in campus periodicals here.
"I saw a shocking bias towards the left
here," said Maillet. "Stanford is more liberal
than the average school and that is reflected
in the papers."

News analysis

Despite this liberalism, Maillet saw a "mar
ket fora conservative viewpoint" here.
It was this perceived need which inspired
Maillet and four of his friends to start the Re
view, which has since published two issues
with circulations of about 1200. It has re
ceived most of its funding from alumni or fac
ulty, who can purchase a subscription for $25.
It has also applied for grants from national
conservative organizations and has received
srpa'l support from some large businesses.
The Review is published by the Stanford
Conservative Political Alliance and com
ments in sometimes-fiery, sometimes-objec
tive essays on a variety of international poli
cies. Its May, 1981 issue defended the Reagan
administration's economic policies and
decried the liberal denouncement of these
policies. The Fall 1981 issue called fora return
to the gold standard and an end to affirmative
action programs.
An attack on affirmative action was partly
responsible for the censorship of The
Dartmouth Review, a much larger and more
powerful paper than Stanford's Review.
The Dartmouth Review has been in con
frontation with the college ever since its in
ception two years ago following a snafu be
tween then-editor of the campus' daily paper
Greg Fossedal and his staff. Fossedal left the
paper and started the Review because of ide
ological differences between himself and the
rest of the staff.
The Review soon received support from
alumni who began buying $25 subscriptions.
Editor William Cattan claims that the paper
now has about 2000 alumni subscribers and

an annual budget of $70,000.
Cattan said the censorship was an example
of the "left-leaning" faculty attempting to
"stifle the freedom of speech" of the Review.
The faculty called the Review racist and sex
ist and pointed to a column by Keeney Jones,
one of the paper's founders, as an example.
Jones' column, entitled "Dis Sho' Ain't No
Jive, Bro," attacked affirmative action as low
ering admissions standards and causing peo
ple to graduate from the school without basic
knowledge of English.
The column said in part: "We be bucco
riled, bro. Dem whites... be sayin' 'firmative
action ain't no good fo' us cause it be puttin'
down ac'demic standards. Dey be spoutin'
'bout how 'firmative action be no hep to
black folk 'cross da nation, on account we be
notdoin'too well."
Cattan said the column was "typical
Keeney Jones style," and that "Richard Pryor
and (humor magazine) National Lampoon
could get away with something like that."
"The university thinks that anyone who at
tacks affirmative action is a racist," Cattan
said.

Are college campuses, once
the bastion of radicalism,
beginning to reflect
this national conservative
trend, or are they riding a
rollercoaster in reaction to
this conservatism?

The Review also opposes the funding of the
campus gay student group and opposes any
nuclear weapons freeze. Cattan claimed 40
percent of the student body of Dartmouth
agrees with the Review on these issues.
Phil Gerson, editor of the Dartmouth,
doesn't agree.
He said the column by Jones was "not fun
ny" and that the founding of the Harbinger, a
bi-weekly paper, is an example of the
Dartmouth students' disagreement with the
Review.
The Harbinger features interviews with
Dartmouth aiumni Sen. Paul Tsongas (D-
Mass.), a vociferous liberal, and is run by what
Gerson calls "New Deal Democrats."
Cattan said "not many people take it (the
Harbinger) seriously."
The Ivy League editorial calling fora halt to
U. S. involvement in El Salvador was taken se
riously enough to receive coverage by the
New York Times and many national news
magazines.
The editorial called for the United States to
bring about a negotiated settlement of the
civil war, as well as denouncing military in
volvement.
Dartmouth was the only Ivy League school
which did not sign the resolution. The eight
Ivy League schools are: Brown, Columbia,
Cornell, Dartmouth, Harvard, Princeton, the
University of Pennsylvania and Yale.
Gerson said that Dartmouth did not sign
the resolution because many members of its
staff were on vacation during the signing,
which happened between quarters.
Dartmouth is the only Ivy League school on
the quarter system, and the Dartmouth
printed a similar editorial a few days later.
Despite the ideology which these editorials

In March this year, the daily newspapers at

support for then-President of El Salvador Jose
Napoleon Duarte's regime and called fora
commitment that the United States will not
send troops to the Central American country.

Are college campuses, once the bastion of
radicalism, beginning to reflect this national
conservative trend, or are they riding a roll
ercoaster in reaction to this conservatism?
There seems to be no definitive answer, but
it is clear that campus publications are be
coming an interesting, if not accurate, gauge
of public reaction.
Peter Maillet, one of the founders of the
Stanford Conservative Review, sees a definite
national conservative trend, but does not see
it reflected in campus periodicals here.
"I saw a shocking bias towards the left
here," said Maillet. "Stanford is more liberal
than the average school and that is reflected
in the papers."

Despite this liberalism, Maillet saw a "mar
ket fora conservative viewpoint" here.
It was this perceived need which inspired
Maillet and four of his friends to start the Re
view, which has since published two issues
with circulations of about 1200. It has re
ceived most of its funding from alumni or fac
ulty, who can purchase a subscription for $25.
It has also applied for grants from national
conservative organizations and has received
srpa'l support from some large businesses.
The Review is published by the Stanford
Conservative Political Alliance and com
ments in sometimes-fiery, sometimes-objec
tive essays on a variety of international poli
cies. Its May, 1981 issue defended the Reagan
administration's economic policies and
decried the liberal denouncement of these
policies. The Fall 1981 issue called fora return
to the gold standard and an end to affirmative
action programs.
An attack on affirmative action was partly
responsible for the censorship of The
Dartmouth Review, a much larger and more
powerful paper than Stanford's Review.
The Dartmouth Review has been in con
frontation with the college ever since its in
ception two years ago following a snafu be
tween then-editor of the campus' daily paper
Greg Fossedal and his staff. Fossedal left the
paper and started the Review because of ide
ological differences between himself and the
rest of the staff.
The Review soon received support from
alumni who began buying $25 subscriptions.
Editor William Cattan claims that the paper
now has about 2000 alumni subscribers and

an annual budget of $70,000.
Cattan said the censorship was an example
of the "left-leaning" faculty attempting to
"stifle the freedom of speech" of the Review.
The faculty called the Review racist and sex
ist and pointed to a column by Keeney Jones,
one of the paper's founders, as an example.
Jones' column, entitled "Dis Sho' Ain't No
Jive, Bro," attacked affirmative action as low
ering admissions standards and causing peo
ple to graduate from the school without basic
knowledge of English.
The column said in part: "We be bucco
riled, bro. Dem whites... be sayin' 'firmative
action ain't no good fo' us cause it be puttin'
down ac'demic standards. Dey be spoutin'
'bout how 'firmative action be no hep to
black folk 'cross da nation, on account we be
notdoin'too well."
Cattan said the column was "typical
Keeney Jones style," and that "Richard Pryor
and (humor magazine) National Lampoon
could get away with something like that."
"The university thinks that anyone who at
tacks affirmative action is a racist," Cattan
said.

Are college campuses, once
the bastion of radicalism,
beginning to reflect
this national conservative
trend, or are they riding a
rollercoaster in reaction to
this conservatism?

The Review also opposes the funding of the
campus gay student group and opposes any
nuclear weapons freeze. Cattan claimed 40
percent of the student body of Dartmouth
agrees with the Review on these issues.
Phil Gerson, editor of the Dartmouth,
doesn't agree.
He said the column by Jones was "not fun
ny" and that the founding of the Harbinger, a
bi-weekly paper, is an example of the
Dartmouth students' disagreement with the
Review.
The Harbinger features interviews with
Dartmouth aiumni Sen. Paul Tsongas (D-
Mass.), a vociferous liberal, and is run by what
Gerson calls "New Deal Democrats."
Cattan said "not many people take it (the
Harbinger) seriously."
The Ivy League editorial calling fora halt to
U. S. involvement in El Salvador was taken se
riously enough to receive coverage by the
New York Times and many national news
magazines.
The editorial called for the United States to
bring about a negotiated settlement of the
civil war, as well as denouncing military in
volvement.
Dartmouth was the only Ivy League school
which did not sign the resolution. The eight
Ivy League schools are: Brown, Columbia,
Cornell, Dartmouth, Harvard, Princeton, the
University of Pennsylvania and Yale.
Gerson said that Dartmouth did not sign
the resolution because many members of its
staff were on vacation during the signing,
which happened between quarters.
Dartmouth is the only Ivy League school on
the quarter system, and the Dartmouth
printed a similar editorial a few days later.
Despite the ideology which these editorials
represent the question remains: does this
opinion reflect student, or even national,
feeling? Many editors of daily papers at Ivy
League schools would say yes, but a number
of editors of conservative periodicals would
disagree.
