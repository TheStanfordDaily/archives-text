# Students 'adopt' young siblings

"It's very rewarding at times,
it's very frustrating at times. It's
almost like being a parent,"
said R. Keith Allaun of his in
volvement with Partners, one
of the many big brother/big
sister type programs in the Bay
Area in which people from
Stanford participate.
The two most widespread or
ganizations on campus are
Partners and Big Brothers/Big
Sisters of the Peninsula
(88/BS). Ann Hurley, com
munity activities coordinator in
charge of Partners, said 35 to 40
people from Stanford are with
their program. Jim Gorman, so
cial worker at 88/BS, estimated
30 people from the Stanford

community are involved with
their organization.
The local 88/BS has been in
existence for 15 years; Partners
has been active in the Bay Area
for three years.
The main difference be
tween the respective programs
is that Partners provides for all
children with problems, re
gardless of their family status,
while 88/BS concentrates on
children from single-parent
families.
"When the mother or father
remarries, the family is no
longer eligible for the pro
gram, and the match must be
ended, officially that is. That
doesn't mean that they (the big
brother/sister and the little

brother/sister) won't see each
other still," Gorman of 88/BS
said.
Allaun, a partner with a 13-
year-old boy from a single-pa
rent family, has been active in
the program for nine months.
Allaun and his junior partner
meet two to three times a
week, and talk on the phone
on other days. Allaun also has
his junior partner stay over
night every other weekend.
"There needs to be a lot of
contact. The physical presence
is very important. You can't say,
'I care ... see you in three
weeks,' " Allaun said.
Allaun, who grew up without
a father, explained his reasons
for joining Partners, "There

were several people in my life
who were instrumental as male
role models. If I didn't have
them as role models, things
would have changed drastical
ly in my life."
Allaun commented on his
reaction to the program, "It's
great! Sometimes it can be frus
trating though, because the
kids recommended to the pro
gram have parents who don't
care, or are in a very rough situ
ation (working 12 hours a day),
so it's important to build up the
parent's image when talking
about him or her. But it feels so
good to give and get so much
satisfaction in return."
