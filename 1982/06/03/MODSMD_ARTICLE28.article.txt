# Students 'adopt' young siblings

### George Fujii 
"It's very rewarding at times,
it's very frustrating at times. It's
almost like being a parent,"
said R. Keith Allaun of his in
volvement with Partners, one
of the many big brother/big
sister type programs in the Bay
Area in which people from
Stanford participate.
The two most widespread or
ganizations on campus are
Partners and Big Brothers/Big
Sisters of the Peninsula
(88/BS). Ann Hurley, com
munity activities coordinator in
charge of Partners, said 35 to 40
people from Stanford are with
their program. Jim Gorman, so
cial worker at 88/BS, estimated
30 people from the Stanford

community are involved with
their organization.
The local 88/BS has been in
existence for 15 years; Partners
has been active in the Bay Area
for three years.
The main difference be
tween the respective programs
is that Partners provides for all
children with problems, re
gardless of their family status,
while 88/BS concentrates on
children from single-parent
families.
"When the mother or father
remarries, the family is no
longer eligible for the pro
gram, and the match must be
ended, officially that is. That
doesn't mean that they (the big
brother/sister and the little

brother/sister) won't see each
other still," Gorman of 88/BS
said.
Allaun, a partner with a 13-
year-old boy from a single-pa
rent family, has been active in
the program for nine months.
Allaun and his junior partner
meet two to three times a
week, and talk on the phone
on other days. Allaun also has
his junior partner stay over
night every other weekend.
"There needs to be a lot of
contact. The physical presence
is very important. You can't say,
'I care ... see you in three
weeks,' " Allaun said.
Allaun, who grew up without
a father, explained his reasons
for joining Partners, "There

were several people in my life
who were instrumental as male
role models. If I didn't have
them as role models, things
would have changed drastical
ly in my life."
Allaun commented on his
reaction to the program, "It's
great! Sometimes it can be frus
trating though, because the
kids recommended to the pro
gram have parents who don't
care, or are in a very rough situ
ation (working 12 hours a day),
so it's important to build up the
parent's image when talking
about him or her. But it feels so
good to give and get so much
satisfaction in return."

matches work out. Sophomore
Lorraine Stevens, a member of
Partners, was matched with a
15-year-old girl on probation
who had previously gone
through four Partners.
"I wanted a junior partner
referred by probation because
it was in my field of interest and
the challenge it posed," said
Stevens. "She immediately
made it clear though, that she
was only doing it for her proba
tion officer."
Stevens described her
former junior partner: "She
liked to party, and thought that
I would take her to the bars.
She also enjoyed starting fights,
saying how her uncle, the po
liceman, would throw down
his badge and beat up anyone
who tried to hurt her. She was
15 going on 35, she never made
any effort in the slightest to
make it work."
"I really liked the challenge
at first," said Stevens, who
stayed with her junior partner
for two quarters, "but it be
came obvious that I wasn't
going to change her because
she was too set in her ways, and
only seeing her a few hours a
week wouldn't have much ef
fect on her."
Stevens said that the girl's
mother was always out late par

tying, and encouraged her
daughter to do the same.
Stevens said what she learned
most from the experience was
that the parents have the most
impact on their children.
Stevens curently has a new
junior partner who she said is
working out very well. "I had
her over for the second time
the other night. Her family is
really nice — her only problem
was that she was doing poorly
in school."
Though most are students,
big brothers or big sisters here
on campus do not necessarily
have to be. According to
Gorman 88/BS members of the
program include a nurse at the
Medical Center, a computer
programmer at the Medical
Center, secretaries who are
also mothers and an associate
professor.
The associate professor is
Richard Schupbach of the
slavic department, who is mar
ried and has two children of his
own — ages five and three
months.
Schupbach, who has been
with 88/BS for six or seven
years, said that he got involved
with the program at a time
when he and his wife had no
children.
"We wanted to figure out if
we wanted to have children,

and 88/BS was one way to find
out."
Schupbach's "little brother"
is now a senior at Palo Alto
High School. "I don't see him
nearly as much as I used to,"
Schupbach said. "We've
drifted apart, but the rela
tionship between the families
is still strong."
Schupbach said he currently
is not planning to take on an
other "little brother" but men
tioned that he might re
consider once his children
have grown older.
Not all children in need of a
big brother or sister are for
tunateenoughtohaveone. For
these children on the waiting
list there are groups like the
campus fraternities. Gorman of
the 88/BS said that the SAEs,
the Dekes, and the Sigma Chi's
had put on separate events
sponsored by the 88/BS of the
Peninsula in the past.
Explained Eric Lanaverk,
community service chairman
last quarter for the SAEs, "We
take the backlog of the 88/BS
kids, because the wait for girls
is six months, and nine months
for guys."
"There is a backlog of kids,"
said Hurley of Partners. "It's a
constant struggle to get volun
teers, but getting into Stanford
was a big break."

working out very well. "I had
her over for the second time
the other night. Her family is
really nice — her only problem
was that she was doing poorly
in school."
Though most are students,
big brothers or big sisters here
on campus do not necessarily
have to be. According to
Gorman 88/BS members of the
program include a nurse at the
Medical Center, a computer
programmer at the Medical
Center, secretaries who are
also mothers and an associate
professor.
The associate professor is
Richard Schupbach of the
slavic department, who is mar
ried and has two children of his
own — ages five and three
months.
Schupbach, who has been
with 88/BS for six or seven
years, said that he got involved
with the program at a time
when he and his wife had no
children.
"We wanted to figure out if
we wanted to have children,

and 88/BS was one way to find
out."
Schupbach's "little brother"
is now a senior at Palo Alto
High School. "I don't see him
nearly as much as I used to,"
Schupbach said. "We've
drifted apart, but the rela
tionship between the families
is still strong."
Schupbach said he currently
is not planning to take on an
other "little brother" but men
tioned that he might re
consider once his children
have grown older.
Not all children in need of a
big brother or sister are for
tunateenoughtohaveone. For
these children on the waiting
list there are groups like the
campus fraternities. Gorman of
the 88/BS said that the SAEs,
the Dekes, and the Sigma Chi's
had put on separate events
sponsored by the 88/BS of the
Peninsula in the past.
Explained Eric Lanaverk,
community service chairman
last quarter for the SAEs, "We
take the backlog of the 88/BS
kids, because the wait for girls
is six months, and nine months
for guys."
"There is a backlog of kids,"
said Hurley of Partners. "It's a
constant struggle to get volun
teers, but getting into Stanford
was a big break."
"It's very rewarding at times,
it's very frustrating at times. It's
almost like being a parent,"
said R. Keith Allaun of his in
volvement with Partners, one
of the many big brother/big
sister type programs in the Bay
Area in which people from
Stanford participate.
The two most widespread or
ganizations on campus are
Partners and Big Brothers/Big
Sisters of the Peninsula
(88/BS). Ann Hurley, com
munity activities coordinator in
charge of Partners, said 35 to 40
people from Stanford are with
their program. Jim Gorman, so
cial worker at 88/BS, estimated
30 people from the Stanford

community are involved with
their organization.
The local 88/BS has been in
existence for 15 years; Partners
has been active in the Bay Area
for three years.
The main difference be
tween the respective programs
is that Partners provides for all
children with problems, re
gardless of their family status,
while 88/BS concentrates on
children from single-parent
families.
"When the mother or father
remarries, the family is no
longer eligible for the pro
gram, and the match must be
ended, officially that is. That
doesn't mean that they (the big
brother/sister and the little

brother/sister) won't see each
other still," Gorman of 88/BS
said.
Allaun, a partner with a 13-
year-old boy from a single-pa
rent family, has been active in
the program for nine months.
Allaun and his junior partner
meet two to three times a
week, and talk on the phone
on other days. Allaun also has
his junior partner stay over
night every other weekend.
"There needs to be a lot of
contact. The physical presence
is very important. You can't say,
'I care ... see you in three
weeks,' " Allaun said.
Allaun, who grew up without
a father, explained his reasons
for joining Partners, "There

were several people in my life
who were instrumental as male
role models. If I didn't have
them as role models, things
would have changed drastical
ly in my life."
Allaun commented on his
reaction to the program, "It's
great! Sometimes it can be frus
trating though, because the
kids recommended to the pro
gram have parents who don't
care, or are in a very rough situ
ation (working 12 hours a day),
so it's important to build up the
parent's image when talking
about him or her. But it feels so
good to give and get so much
satisfaction in return."

matches work out. Sophomore
Lorraine Stevens, a member of
Partners, was matched with a
15-year-old girl on probation
who had previously gone
through four Partners.
"I wanted a junior partner
referred by probation because
it was in my field of interest and
the challenge it posed," said
Stevens. "She immediately
made it clear though, that she
was only doing it for her proba
tion officer."
Stevens described her
former junior partner: "She
liked to party, and thought that
I would take her to the bars.
She also enjoyed starting fights,
saying how her uncle, the po
liceman, would throw down
his badge and beat up anyone
who tried to hurt her. She was
15 going on 35, she never made
any effort in the slightest to
make it work."
"I really liked the challenge
at first," said Stevens, who
stayed with her junior partner
for two quarters, "but it be
came obvious that I wasn't
going to change her because
she was too set in her ways, and
only seeing her a few hours a
week wouldn't have much ef
fect on her."
Stevens said that the girl's
mother was always out late par

tying, and encouraged her
daughter to do the same.
Stevens said what she learned
most from the experience was
that the parents have the most
impact on their children.
