# Co-op popularity waning...
## 
### Heather Millar Senior staff writer 
Co-ops have failed to attract
enough residents before. But the
second-round results of the housing
draw, which came in two weeks ago,
have raised fears that the existence of
some co-ops may be in jeopardy be
cause they failed to attract enough
prospective residents.
Synergy, Columbae, Terra, and Phi
Psi houses failed to fill all available
resident spaces, collectively leaving
39 vacancies. The French House, not
a co-op, has 12 vacancies for next
year.
The Row Office will probably sub
mit the co-op problem to the Com
mittee on Services to Students which
will review their programs in order to
determine whether the co-op pro

grams should be altered. This is rou
tinely done when residences do not
fill up.
While the fate of co-ops remains
undecided, the large number of
vacancies has inspired rumors that
one of the co-ops might be discon
tinued or that Synergy and Colum
bae might be combined. Synergy res
idents say they are not sure if the
house will operate next year. Wheth
er or not these rumours hold true,
University administrators have
begun to ask whether or not the Uni
versity is "over co-opped."
Co-op residents maintain it is not.
"Co-ops are the paradigm of what
residential education is trying to ac
complish," Columbae RA Shelley
Antonio said. "You learn in your liv
ing environment, you face the issues,

you learn from people."
"We may be over co-opped," Row
Manager Diana Conklin said. "If you
looked just at numbers and ignore all
the other indices, it looks as if this
year we are over co-opped."
One co-op resident, however, said
collective living next year could fall
back into favor as the popularity
curve of certain residences follows a
cycle similiar to a sine wave. Conklin
said the number of vacancies this
year is "unprecedented."

absence of an outreach program, to
"growing conservatism" and a "bad
image."
"I think that the University has ev
ery right to discontinue a house that
has 19 empty spaces, especially when
there's a housing shortage," said sen

ior Cynthia Vitt-Jarvis, who has lived
in or been involved with Synergy
many times during the the last six
years. "On the other hand, I don't
think people have an accurate image
of what co-ops are like. The
'Synergist' is a myth," she said.
Conklin attributes the resident
shortage primarily to the opening of
new housing and the lack of a co-op
outreach program. "The co-ops can
not afi'ord to be insular," Conklin
said.
