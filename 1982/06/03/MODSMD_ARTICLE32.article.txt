## Bridging the gap between science and society 
### Jan Mireles Scientist 
For many this term conjures up images of
the scientists portrayed in grade B movies
shown at 2 a.m. In these films, late night in
somniacs are treated to maniacal experimen
ters clad in soiled lab coats and typically less
than aware of the social scene. These make
believe experimenters work on mysterious
projects in laboratories far from the public
eye. Insofar as the world can be used to
further their objectives, contact is accep
table. Otherwise, solitude is preferred. And
as is usual, by the movie's end the average
citizen is found fleeing the"evil"scientist's
hide-away for the safe ground of the non
scientific community. Both parties are glad
to be done with one another.
While the above is extreme, scientific ster
eotypes, if ever apolicable, do lirtip to right
the misperceptions that cloud the fields of
science and serve as obstacles to com
munication between its members and socie
ty.
At Stanford it is jokingly referred to as the
face off between the humanities "fuzzies"
and the science "hardcores". The disparity
of understanding between science and soci
ety — between scientist and layperson — is,
however, one that exists at a national and in
ternational level as well. Bridging the gap is a
task that some see as essential and some as
troublesom, but few as insignificant.
Several members of Stanford's scientific
community talked about their views on sci
ence and research, their role and motiva
tions, the problems they see within the sys
tem and their moves to adapt or provide
solutions.
Jim Collman holds the title of George and
Hilda Danbert Professor of Chemistry. At age
52, he concedes that "science in some ways is
a young person's game." And Coilman is
very much a participant in the "game."
Possessing an admittedly aggressive manner,
Collman serves on nine University commit
tees, consults for science firms, writes and
manages science manuscripts, handles fund
ing proposals and conducts lectures as well.
Soft spoken, German-born Walter
Meyerhof is a professor of physics. One time
chairman of the physics department (he

served from 1970-77), Meyerhof now divides
his time between the laboratory and the
classroom. Calm and self-assured,
Meyerhof, who recently turned 60, views sci
ence as a "vessel that contains our knowl
edge. The contents of this vessel is being
drawn upon by society constantly. My role as
a scientist is to replenish the vessel."
A man who laughed easily at his own
absent-mindedness when he forgot his son's
upcoming wedding date, Prof. of Engi
neering William Spicer becomes serious
when he considers what he terms the "bar
riers" between science and-society. Accord
ing to Spicer, "the breakdown of barriers
should be the main thrust."
Though he considers himself a "pure sci
entist,'" 48-year-old Sebastian Doniach
stressed that he too is concerned about com
munication barriers. A British citizen,
Doniach joined the faculty in 1969. While he
began strictly in physics Doniach has been
working for the past seven years concurrent
ly in biophysics. Doniach noted his desire to
break down barriers, real or imagined. "I felt
a need to communicate what I was doing to
the non-specialist. In a way it justifies your
existence."
The development of science
Whether science ar.c current research are
justified the fact remains that science and its
discoveries have played a vital role in the de
velopment of modern society. Few will dis
pute the impact of nuclear energy or of the
work of men like Isaac Newton or Albert
Einstein.
Much of scientific development is said to
lie in human curiosity and the desire to know
what relation the individual has to the uni
verse. In the time of Newton, religious be
liefs, to a large extent, influenced scientific
research and its stated objectives. However,
according to Collman, "Religious overtones
are not important in this day and age."
As science and its fields of research de
veloped, religion and its pressures seemed
to fade into the background. Scientists
veered away from metaphysics and sought to
present and conduct research on a secular
level. Though Doniach agreed with Collman
that today, "we wouldn't use religious
terms," he stressed that, "You still have the

beliefs — the idea of truth being absolutely
dominant."
"In the old days, that (truth) would have
been spoken of in terms of religion," said
Doniach. "Now we separate ethical truth
from religious truth."
Though possessing what he termed "not a
conventional view," Spicer said he sees a
need for science to continually adapt. Ac
cording to the history major turned physi
cist, "Science will tend to thrive when it can
develop new models and tend to be frus
trated where it tries to hold to old models."
If such a view is accurate it would then
seem that science is at a perpetual crossroad.
It must constantly adapt to new discovery
and to a barrage of societal expectations. Ex
pectations which some scientists resent and
others accept as part of their responsibility to
society.
In fact, the question of "science and social
responsibility" is much debated. The phrase
itself often evokes only a conditioned re
sponse. Not all scientists accept the moral re
sponsibility often sought by the general pub
lic. Others personally feel the request is
quite valid.
Responsibility, when accepted, tends to
follow two tracks. The first involves the genu
ine desire noted by Doniach to share and in
volve the layperson in the scientific search
fortruth. The second relates to financial mat
ters.
In Spicer's opinion a major reason for
keeping the public informed is the fact that
much of scientific research is directly funded
through taxes. "The demands of science on
the public funding system have reached a
point where society has a right to examine
and try to understand what the long range
benefits are," Spicer said.
Not ail scientists however, are as firm in
the conviction of explaining their motives to
the public.
"I do what I do not out of a sense of social
responsibility but because it interests me, "
Meyerhof said. "I do have some feelings of
social conscience. Scientists should make it
known to people what they are doing. (After
all), it is certainly true that society pays for
the research in science."
Though he acknowledged a commitment

to informing the public, Meyerhof ex
pressed less patience with society's call for
'applied' science over 'pure' science. "Ap
plications of science reduce the available
knowledge, " he said, "where are you when
it's done?"
Though concensus points toward expand
ing communication between scientists and
the general public, generating exchange has
proved an arduous and often unsatisfying
task.
For this reason it is often easier to justify
the gap rather than to work to bridge it. Ter
ming the public "largely ignorant" in respect
to science matters, Collman noted the effort
needed to overcome communication bar
riers. "The public has a very limited view of
scientists. Scientists don't take much time to
express themselves. It's difficult to do, dis
tracting from one's work — also the lay pub
lic is not that interested," he maintained.
It is this lack of interest in improving com
munication which most concerns Spicer.
While Collman described a mutual lack of
curiosity Spicer placed the blame in scien
tists not "taking an overview and trying to
put the world into perspective." According
to Spicer, too many scientists are "ill
equipped" to handle the interaction needed
with society.
Spicer said he believes science plays an es
sential part in world development. "The
whole populace should know and under
stand how things work. It's important to the
survival of society and democracy." Ac
complishing the goal of increased interac
tion can, according to Spicer, be done only
through education. Spicer urged that sci
ence be emphasized at the elementary level
and that the emphasis continue throughout
the school years. "It can't be done in a short
period of time, (but) we have to break down
the two societies."
At the university level he expressed con
cern about the discomfort non-scientists ex
perience when enrolled in science courses.
"The average history major is terrorized by
the science courses they take. They don't get
a real sense of the subject (because) scien
tists develop theirown vocabulary. .. it's dif
ficult to speak to a layman." •
Meyerhof and Doniach agreed that "bar

riers in understanding" do exist. "The
further the activity you're involved in is, the
more removed it is from every day life,"
Meyerhof said.
Removal from everyday life, Spicer
claimed, is sought by many scientists. The at
titude is one of "leave me alone." "They
tend to choose science for that reason," said
Spicer, "ultimately it's self-defeating."
Collman however, said he sees the process
as necessarily isolating. "Science is an elitist
proposition in respect to achievements and
rewards.. . the best scientists are vigorously
independent," he said.
Constraints of time and the perceived
need to compete for both funding and atten
tion hinder scientists' attempts to increase
public awareness. "It is a competitive busi
ness," Collman said, "It's just an accepted
thing. It's uncomfortable, but a lot of us are
intrinsically competitive."
The view of science as a business is rela
tively new. And such a view has serious im
plications for Spicer's claim rhat many scien
tists seek refuge from dai'v interaction.
Spicer admitted that the in-fighting and poli
tics that go on within science are "extremely
heavy." Though he asserted that scientists
can still work fairly well by themselves,
Meyerhof noted that out of necessity, "Sci
entists are being drawn more into discourse
with society. In order to get support I guess
you have to make known what you're
doing."
Ultimately science and society are en
gaged in a symbiotic relationship. Science
depends on society for the means by which it
can continue to develop. Society, it seems,
cannot realistically deny the demands it has
placed on science or the extent to which it
depends on science to improve the quality
of life.
Lack of communication, according to Col
lman, is the barrier between scientist and
layperson. Whether it be in Spicer's terms a
means of protecting society from destruc
tion, or in Meyerhof's and Doniach's, a
means of sharing their interests, or in Col-
Iman's a necessity in terms of procuring fun
ding,communication is vital. Without it, said
Collman, "the enterprise of science could be
threatened."
