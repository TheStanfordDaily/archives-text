## Reflections: a walk by Mono Lake 
### Gale Warner 
The lake never stays one color for long.
It has been changing moods continually
since my arrivahhe day before, from a pale
aqua to cerulean to a rather angry gray
green yesterday afternoon, when the wind
came up. This morning it is slate-gray, un
der high thin clouds and weak sun. I leave
my camp on a bluff above a stream and
head for the lakeshore, hoping to find the
Black Hole, a large, deep freshwater
spring. Though I have no maportrailtofol
low, I know it is somewhere nearby.
What looks like a green meadow be
tween the bluff and the lake turns out to be
marsh, and my shoes are soaked by the
time I near the shore. Abruptly the grass
stops, replaced by an expanse of white
alkali created by the receding of Mono
Lake's saline waters. The lake level has
been dropping steadily since about 1941,
when the city of Los Angeles first began to
divert water from streams that used to feed
the lake into an aqueduct fora long trip to
southern California.
A flock of phalaropes takes off when I
reach the lake, scolding me, but soon re
turn. The tiny crystals of alkali on wet
brown sand look for all the world like pow
dered sugar on brownies. I am completely
alone, and the silence is heavy, pressing on
eardrums, seeming not only audible but
loud. The occasional gulls' cries add to
rather than break the silence.
I find the Black Hole sooner than ex
pected, not black at all but indigo fading to
turquoise edges. A white stone I drop into
it out of some juvenile urge to test the
depth disappears in the first ten feet.
Gardens of algae in the fresh run-off are a
patch of vivid green in the whitewashed
landscape. A dozen dead grebes line the
shore, lobed feet flaccid, necks reflexed.
Like everything else about the lake, the
spring is a place of contrasts, of startling
juxtapositions of life and death, of harsh,
unconventional beauty.
A sudden vision of this place in a decade
appears. By then, with luck, this will be
Mono Lake National Monument, pre
served, protected and in every travel
agent's office. There will be neat cedar
boardwalks over the soggy alkali and re
assuring signs with arrows: Black Hole, .8
km., Gull Flat, 3.8 km., Negit Island,B.4 km.
There will be trails, rangers in uniform, en
graved metal displays encapsulating how

tufa towers form, how birds migrate, what
each mountain on the horizon is named,
when the volcanoes are likely to next
erupt, why one shouldn't drink from the
springs, why one should stay behind the
railings. There will be people.
I can't help feeling smugly superior to
those future tourists, who will dutifully fol
low the signs to Black Hole, stare remotely,
unmoved, into its indigo depths, snap a
picture of the mountains reflected in its
still water, and go on to another sight. I will
be one of those exasperating old-timers
who reminisce about the good old days,
and the marshes will grow more treach
erous, the terrain rougher, the solitude
more adventurous, by fiat of memory.
But this feeling doesn't last long. Some
good old days these are, when the lake,
even in this year of heavy rain and snow,
will drop another six inches this year;
when the brine shrimp, food for most of
the lake's birds, are again low in numbers
this spring; when the gull chicks are again
starving to death by the score in their nest
ing colonies. Crowds and trails may be
lacking, but so is any protection for the
lake from Los Angeles' diversions.
Out here, the arguments over acre-feet,
public trust, salinity concentrations, and
water-saving devices in toilets seem re
mote, but Mono Lake's fate will be de

cided in faraway cities. The Los Angeles
Department of Water and Power claims
that their diversions are not threatening
the biological integrity of the lake. The
Mono Lake Committee claims that they
are.
Currently, the California Supreme Court
is hearing a lawsuit brought by several en
vironmental groups that says the diver
sions are violating the public trust. What
began as a case that everyone said didn't
have a chance appears to have one. Some
of the main groves of tufa towers have
been designated a state preserve, giving
them some protection. A congressional
subcommittee is considering a bill to es
tablish a Mono Lake National Monument.
But despite all the protest, the diversions
continue, the lake keeps shrinking and
the vision of a popular, protected park is
only a dream. While something rare and
precious might be lost if this empty land
were turned into a national monument,
such a loss would be trivial compared to
the slow conversion of the lake into dry
wasteland.
Reflections. The sun is high now, and has
burned a hole in the clouds. The lake is
presently being a conformist, taking on no
color of its own but mirroring the moun
tains, snow, clouds in quietly muted tones.
