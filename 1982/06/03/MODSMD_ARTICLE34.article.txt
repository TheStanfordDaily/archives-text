# Catch a condor—if you can
## 
### Dave Kreger 
Efforts this spring to capture California
condors have failed, producing frustration in
some conservation organizations and jubila
tion in others.
Bitter conflicts between environmental
groups about whether attempts to save the
dwindling population of California condors
should include breeding them in captivity
were piqued by the death of a condor chick
in the hands of a researcher two years ago,
and by the capture team's setting fire to 100
acres of grassland while practicing with a can
non net last summer.
Centuries ago condors ranged from British
Columbia to Baja, but now about 30 remain in
the hills between Bakersfield and Los Angeles
and in the foothills of the southern Sierra. The
enormous vulture — up to 10 feet from
wingtip to wingtip, and as much as 23 pounds
— can glide 10 miles without flapping its
wings.
Though scientists disagree on the exact
causes of their decline, it seems linked with
increased population and hunting, suburban
sprawl over former ranchland, and the wide
spread use of poisons to kill ground squirrels,
which then become a poisoned food source
for the condors.
In 1906 one naturalist wrote that condors
would be extinct in a decade. Lately, how
ever, there is renewed optimism. "We have
found eight juveniles," said John Ogden, sen
ior staff scientist for the National Audubon
Society, which supports captive breeding.
"That's to surprisingly high number for such a
small population. The problem must be ex
cessive mortality."
Ogden is part of the Condor Research Cen
ter in Ventura, California, which is supported
by a five-year grant of $1.75 million from the
U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service and $500,000
from the National Audubon Society. Much of
this money has gone to the construction of fa
cilities to breed condors in captivity at the San
Diego Zoo.
Another sizable portion has been invested
in equipment fora radio telemetry program,
including radio transmitters to be placed on

condors' wings, permanent receiver towers
built on mountain tops to pinpoint the loca
tion of birds tagged with the transmitters and
computers to continually monitor their loca
tion. The first step in such a program is captur
ing condors.
But on Monday, the capture permit issued
to the Center by the California Department
of Fish and Game expired without any birds
being caught.
David Phillips, wildlife programs coordi
nator for Friends of the Earth, is critical of the
Condor Research Center's efforts to capture
birds. "They spend too much time worrying
about their sophisticated electronic gadgets
that harass birds and put them in cages, and
don't place a high enough priority on the
roots of the problem," he said, which he be
lieves is protection of condor habitat. Also,
the problem of developing a law enforce
ment strategy that adequately stops condor
shooting has not yet been confronted head
on, he said.
Phillips suspects that a deal has been struck
between the Center and the Tejon Ranch
Company, owners of a 200,000 acre giant
piece of real estate south of Bakersfield for
which a $2 billion housing development is
proposed. "We will let you trap condors on
the ranch if you don't publicize the true im
portance of the ranch to the condors' habi
tat," Phillips said. He also notes that the Tejon
Ranch is unable to develop without water
supplied by the Peripheral Canal, and the Te
jon Ranch Company is a major contributor to
the pro-canal campaign.
The Condor Research Center recently in
terviewed ranchers throughout the condor
habitat. When asked if the purpose of the in
terview was to determine which private lands
might be recommended to the state or feder
al government for the purchase of condor
easements, Ogden answered, "That is one
option. But it's a sticky situation. Some
ranchers suspect that we might want to in
terfere with their operations."
But the proponents of the captive breeding
and telemetry programs do not seem to ig
nore habitat to the extent Phillips claims.
