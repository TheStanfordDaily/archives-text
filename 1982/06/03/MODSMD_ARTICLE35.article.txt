# University an 'ethical investor'?
## 
### Lauren Saunders 
Last month marked the five-year anniversary of the
sit-in at Old Union in which 294 students were ar
rested in connection with the protest against Univer
sity's investments in companies doing business in
South Africa.
Although tension has waned and public protest has
faded since the sit-in, the University is still wrestling
with the question of its responsibility, if any, as an
"ethical investor."
Last June, the Board of Trustees, acting on a recom
mendation from the Commission on Investment Re
sponsibility (CIR), approved a "one-year moratorium
on the ClR's normal consideration of specific invest
ment responsibility-related resolutions and (sub
stituted) a comprehensive review by the CIR of the
goals, procedures, and mechanisms for ethical invest
ment by the University."
Next week the CIR will submit a report to the board
with its recommendations for future University policy
and for the ClR's role in implementing it.
According to Wayne Cooper, a student member of
the CIR, the commission has been asking "what re
sponsibility does the University have as an investor,
what responsibility does it have as an educational in
stitution, and do the two conflict?"
He saw a paradox, in that "as an educational institu
tion, it is constrained by neutrality, but the University
is here to foster dialogue to achieve knowledge... To
what extent should the University be neutral and to
what extent political?"
Rodney Adams, director of investment and ex-of

ficio (non-voting) member of the CIR, said the mem
bers at first examined whether in fact the University
should be "responsible." He the issue was difficult,
partly because if the University has a right to affect
corporate behavior, corporations may demand a right
to affect University policy.
However, Adams said, "In the final analysis, we are
not rewriting the basic policy statement... (the final
report will be) an implementation guideline, building
on the basic policy document â€” how to do better."
This basic policy document is a December 1977
Trustee Statement whose preamble states that the
University's primary responsibility in investing is "to
maximize the financial return on resources ... How
ever, when the trustees adjudge that corporate poli
cies or practices cause substantial social injury, they,
as responsible and ethical investors, shall give inde
pendent weight to this factor in their investment poli
cies and in voting proxies on corporate securities."
The statement also established the CIR to advise the
board in this regard.
Last year, Adams noted, the CIR spent all its time
debating how to vote the University stock on a flood
of shareholder resolutions, which at times were an
tagonistic and not constructive. "It was a bit of a
logical trap," he said. "If anyone raised an issue, you
weren't responsible if you didn't deal with it. .. How
do you be responsible and realistic at the same time?"
Adams questioned the effectiveness of voting Uni
versity stock at all, and said this year the CIR has dis
cussed how to provide more focus in order to use the
commission's time and energy more productively.
