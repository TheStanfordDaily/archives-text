# Bookstore rebates reach 15%
## 
### 
Students who turned in bookstore
receipts for purchases made this year
can look forward to a rebate amount
ing to 15 percent of their total book
store purchases.
The bookstore is now in the proc
ess of mailing out the checks and
Bookstore Controller Pat McDonald
said he hopes all the checks will be
out of the office by tomorrow.
This year's 15 percent rebate is
slightly larger than last year's 14 per
cent rebate, McDonald said.
McDonald said the average receipt
total turned in was around $200, mak
ing the average rebate around $30.
The total amount given out in
bookstore rebates this year was
$274,000 and the total of receipts
turned in amounted to $1,827,000.
The number of receipt envelopes
turned in this year (8150) was slightly
higher than last year's total of 7200.
McDonald said although this means
more students turned in envelopes
this year, the number of students

who requested rebates does not ex
actly correspond to the number of
envelopes because some students
turned in more than one envelope.
The amount available for refunds
in a given year is determined by the
bookstore's total revenue,
McDonald said. —
