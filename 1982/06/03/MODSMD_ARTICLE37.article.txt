So you don't want to go home.
Your little sister always steals your
carkeys, your dog doesn't recognize
you any more, and your mom always
wants to know who you're going out
with. You tell them you want to stay
at school and the question is always
the same: "Do you have a job?"
Do you want one? Ever thought
about writing for the Da//y? Or taking
pictures? Or night editing?
Poof. You've got a job. It doesn't
pay much. But you'll have a great
time working with great people.
Those interested in working for the
Daily this summer (we publisn twice a
week throughout the summer ses
sion) should stop by the office as
soon as possible. If no one is around
(remember, we have to study some
times), or everyone there is clueless

about the summer volume leave a
note on the message board for Sum
mer Editor Mike Hale. It'll be a good
time. —
See you next fall
That's right. This is the la«t regular
issue of Tne Stanford Daily or the
1981-1982 school year,There've been
seventy nights of work and seventy
mornings of reward (well, excepting
those mornings when the pnone
doesn't stop ringing because a head
line is spelled wrong). It's been fun.
But it's time first to remember why
we're here and to begin studying,
and then to take a break from the
Daily grind. But we'll be getting
ready for next year...
See you next fall. The first Daily will
be Monday, Sept. 27. (P.S. Cocktails
at 5:30 in the offices Saturday.)®^® s
