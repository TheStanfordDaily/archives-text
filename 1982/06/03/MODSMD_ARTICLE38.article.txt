# Buechele-led Card opens World Series Saturday
## 
### Adam Berns 
Fresno — While favored Arizona
State faltered, Stanford rampaged
and became the only Pacific-10
school to qualify for the College
World Series in Omaha, Neb. starting
Saturday. Stanford will meet South
Carolina Saturday.
It will be Stanford's first World
Series appearance since 1967 when
Cardinal coach Mark Marquess led
the team as a first baseman with a .404
batting average. The nations No. 1
team, Arizona State, failed to qualify
last weekend on their home field in
Tempe losing to Fullerton 8-7.
The cardinal red bat of Steve Bue
chele, a little determination and
some clutch relief pitching by John
Radtke and Jeff Ballard propelled the
Cardinal in regional action in Fresno.
Stanford defeated Fresno State Friday
night 17-10 in the second round of
the Western Regionals and then de
feated Pepperdine 15-8 in Saturday
night's final.
In a hitter's series, no one deserved

more credit than Stanford second
baseman Buechele. Chosen the
series MVP, Buechele was nothing
short of superman. He batted .769
(10-for-13) with three homers and 13
RBIs. Buechele now has a 13-game
hitting streak in which he has a .558
batting average (29-for-52) and 27
RBIs.
"He is in a good groove," Stanford
coach Mark Marquess said following
Saturday's game. "I really think he is
coming into his own as a player.
The large margins of victory betray
the true closeness of the contest. Hits
were about as common as mosquitos
in a swamp and no margin of runs was
enough comfort.
Reliever Jeff Ballard replaced
David Harris in the fifth inning of Sat
urday's final to get thfe win for Stan
ford. Giving up only one run in five
innings, Ballard was probably the
most effective pitcher in a hitter's
touranement.
The Cardinal jumped out to a
quick 3-0 lead, but it did not last long.

Pepperdine scored a run in the third
and three in the fourth to take a 4-3
advantage.
In the bottom of the inning, Stan
ford came back to score four runs.
Center fielder Darryl Stephens
started the inning with a solo home
run to left field. After shortstop Bob
DeCosta flied out to left, junior left
fielder Mike Dotterer reached first
on an error by the Wave second
baseman. Dotterer then moved to
second on a deep fly to center by
right fielder Mike Toothman.
Aldrete's double to left scored Dot
terer and was then followed by a two
run homer to left field by Buechele.
Pepperdine came right back in the
fifth inning. The first four batters
reached base in the inning cul
minating in a two-run single by first
baseman Jere Longenecker. That hit
spelled the end for Stanford starter
Harris. Although Ballard retired the
next three batters in order, the
Waves added another run when in
fielder Dana Saraceno tagged up on a
fly ball by infielder Larry Lee.
Stephens and Card third baseman
Loring Davies both scored in the bot
tom of the inning to give Stanford a
9-7 lead.
Stanford scored two more runs in
the sixth on RBI singles by Buechele
and Davies.
In the eighth inning, Stanford final
ly put the game away. The Cardinal
scored four runs, including Bue
chele's second homer of the game.
After the game, Marquess had
nothing but praise for Ballard. "You
could tell when Ballard went out
there that he had his rhythm," Mar
quess said. "We had to shut them
down because they kept coming
back and Baliard did the job."
"It's the first time in a long time
that I've felt real relaxed on jhe
mound," Ballard said. "I felt really
good tonight. It's a big confidence
builder."
Ballard's effectivenes also had im
plications for the World Series. "It al
lows me to go to the pen earlier than I
normally would," Marquess said.
As the only undefeated team after
the second round of the double
elimination tournament, Stanford re
ceieved a bye Saturday afternoon
while Fresno State and Pepperdine —
both 1-1 — played for the right to
meet Stanford. Because it was a
double elimination tournament, a
fourth game would have been played
on Sunday morning if the Cardinal
had lost on Saturday night.
Friday evening's game against
Fresno State was probably the most
crucial of the tournament. It not only

propelled Stanford into the finals,
but allowed the Cardinal to save its
pitching by giving them a bye.
The Bulldogs, or more ap
propriately, their fans, almost did the
Cardinal in Friday night.
After six innings it looked like it
would be a Cardinal cakewalk. Stan
ford built a 12-2 lead while bombard
ing five Fresno pitchers for 17 hits.
The Bulldogs, however, were not
about to give up. With the help of an
apparently shrinking strike zone, a
vocal crowd and solid hitting, Fresno
State came back to score three runs
in the seventh and then added five
more in the eighth. The Fresno
crowd had been on the umpire all
game and finally the umpire seemed
to be giving the crowd what it
wanted. He was not calling strikes.
Brian Myers, who barely escaped
the seventh inning after pitching
three-hit ball through the first six in
nings — only marred by Bulldog right
fielder Terry Pendleton's two homers
— seemed weak in the eighth.
Trying to get the ball in the extra
small strike zone and taunted by a
loud and rambunctious crowd,
Myers gave up three quick runs on
two homers in the eighth inning.
Marquess finally went to the
bullpen and brought in sophomore
John Radtke to protect the now
shrunken three-run lead. The Bull
dogs quickly loaded the bases follow
ing a hit, a walk and an error by third
baseman Davies. Fresno State nar
rowed the gap to two runs when
Terry Pendleton beat out an infield
hit that first baseman Aldrete just
knocked down. Radtke, however,
got Dalena to fly out to Dotterer, en
ding the inning.
Stanford entered the top of the
ninth with the momentum shifting
the other way. Marquess knew that if
his team did not score, Radtke would
have trouble in the bottom of the in
ning. Whatever inspiration he gave
his troops, it worked. The Cardinal
scored five runs in the top of the in
ning and effectively took the life
away from the Bulldogs and their vo
cal fans.
With one out, Fresno pitcher Rob
Emerson hit Stephens and shortstop
Bob DeCosta back to back. Dotterer
reached first on an error to load the
bases, but Toothman made the sec
ond out of the inning attempting a
two-strike bunt. Aldrete followed
with a two-run single and Buechele
hit a two-run double. Hausladen
then hit a double to drive in Bue
chele.
"This is by far the most intense
game I've ever played," Buechele

said following Friday's game. Bue
chele, who drove in eight runs
• against the Bulldogs added: "When
we came back in the ninth inning, it
was just something that we had todo.
That just broke their backs. This isthe
closest seven-run lead game that I've
even been in."
Marquess felt that during the
series, his team was relaxed. "I think
we were more nervous against Ore
gon State,"he said.
Davies, who drove in four runs on
three hits Saturday, said that he
thought the Cardinal's Pac-10 com
petition would help Stanford in the
series.
The Cardinal, which now owns a
48-16-1 record including 13 straight

victories, showed few signs of its ear
ly season hitting jitters. Eight of its
nine starters are hitting over .300 and
15 runs a game is becoming almost
routine.
"I think we can score eight or nine
runs a game, but we're really on a
tear right now," Marquess said.
"Some teams may have some more
impressive players in their lineup,
but we have one of the most consis
tent in the country. We don't have
one easy out."
Dotterer has a hitting streak of his
own going. He has hit safely in 28 of
his last 30 games and 52 of 57 this sea
son.
The Cardinal ha? now gone 149
games without being shut out.

"It's the first time in a long time
that I've felt real relaxed on jhe
mound," Ballard said. "I felt really
good tonight. It's a big confidence
builder."
Ballard's effectivenes also had im
plications for the World Series. "It al
lows me to go to the pen earlier than I
normally would," Marquess said.
As the only undefeated team after
the second round of the double
elimination tournament, Stanford re
ceieved a bye Saturday afternoon
while Fresno State and Pepperdine —
both 1-1 — played for the right to
meet Stanford. Because it was a
double elimination tournament, a
fourth game would have been played
on Sunday morning if the Cardinal
had lost on Saturday night.
Friday evening's game against
Fresno State was probably the most
crucial of the tournament. It not only

propelled Stanford into the finals,
but allowed the Cardinal to save its
pitching by giving them a bye.
The Bulldogs, or more ap
propriately, their fans, almost did the
Cardinal in Friday night.
After six innings it looked like it
would be a Cardinal cakewalk. Stan
ford built a 12-2 lead while bombard
ing five Fresno pitchers for 17 hits.
The Bulldogs, however, were not
about to give up. With the help of an
apparently shrinking strike zone, a
vocal crowd and solid hitting, Fresno
State came back to score three runs
in the seventh and then added five
more in the eighth. The Fresno
crowd had been on the umpire all
game and finally the umpire seemed
to be giving the crowd what it
wanted. He was not calling strikes.
Brian Myers, who barely escaped
the seventh inning after pitching
three-hit ball through the first six in
nings — only marred by Bulldog right
fielder Terry Pendleton's two homers
— seemed weak in the eighth.
Trying to get the ball in the extra
small strike zone and taunted by a
loud and rambunctious crowd,
Myers gave up three quick runs on
two homers in the eighth inning.
Marquess finally went to the
bullpen and brought in sophomore
John Radtke to protect the now
shrunken three-run lead. The Bull
dogs quickly loaded the bases follow
ing a hit, a walk and an error by third
baseman Davies. Fresno State nar
rowed the gap to two runs when
Terry Pendleton beat out an infield
hit that first baseman Aldrete just
knocked down. Radtke, however,
got Dalena to fly out to Dotterer, en
ding the inning.
Stanford entered the top of the
ninth with the momentum shifting
the other way. Marquess knew that if
his team did not score, Radtke would
have trouble in the bottom of the in
ning. Whatever inspiration he gave
his troops, it worked. The Cardinal
scored five runs in the top of the in
ning and effectively took the life
away from the Bulldogs and their vo
cal fans.
With one out, Fresno pitcher Rob
Emerson hit Stephens and shortstop
Bob DeCosta back to back. Dotterer
reached first on an error to load the
bases, but Toothman made the sec
ond out of the inning attempting a
two-strike bunt. Aldrete followed
with a two-run single and Buechele
hit a two-run double. Hausladen
then hit a double to drive in Bue
chele.
"This is by far the most intense
game I've ever played," Buechele

said following Friday's game. Bue
chele, who drove in eight runs
• against the Bulldogs added: "When
we came back in the ninth inning, it
was just something that we had todo.
That just broke their backs. This isthe
closest seven-run lead game that I've
even been in."
Marquess felt that during the
series, his team was relaxed. "I think
we were more nervous against Ore
gon State,"he said.
Davies, who drove in four runs on
three hits Saturday, said that he
thought the Cardinal's Pac-10 com
petition would help Stanford in the
series.
The Cardinal, which now owns a
48-16-1 record including 13 straight

victories, showed few signs of its ear
ly season hitting jitters. Eight of its
nine starters are hitting over .300 and
15 runs a game is becoming almost
routine.
"I think we can score eight or nine
runs a game, but we're really on a
tear right now," Marquess said.
"Some teams may have some more
impressive players in their lineup,
but we have one of the most consis
tent in the country. We don't have
one easy out."
Dotterer has a hitting streak of his
own going. He has hit safely in 28 of
his last 30 games and 52 of 57 this sea
son.
The Cardinal ha? now gone 149
games without being shut out.

THE COACH RETURNS — Stanford coach Mark Marquess who played
on the only other Stanford baseball team to make it to the World
Series will lead the Cardinal to Omaha, Neb.
Fresno — While favored Arizona
State faltered, Stanford rampaged
and became the only Pacific-10
school to qualify for the College
World Series in Omaha, Neb. starting
Saturday. Stanford will meet South
Carolina Saturday.
It will be Stanford's first World
Series appearance since 1967 when
Cardinal coach Mark Marquess led
the team as a first baseman with a .404
batting average. The nations No. 1
team, Arizona State, failed to qualify
last weekend on their home field in
Tempe losing to Fullerton 8-7.
The cardinal red bat of Steve Bue
chele, a little determination and
some clutch relief pitching by John
Radtke and Jeff Ballard propelled the
Cardinal in regional action in Fresno.
Stanford defeated Fresno State Friday
night 17-10 in the second round of
the Western Regionals and then de
feated Pepperdine 15-8 in Saturday
night's final.
In a hitter's series, no one deserved

more credit than Stanford second
baseman Buechele. Chosen the
series MVP, Buechele was nothing
short of superman. He batted .769
(10-for-13) with three homers and 13
RBIs. Buechele now has a 13-game
hitting streak in which he has a .558
batting average (29-for-52) and 27
RBIs.
"He is in a good groove," Stanford
coach Mark Marquess said following
Saturday's game. "I really think he is
coming into his own as a player.
The large margins of victory betray
the true closeness of the contest. Hits
were about as common as mosquitos
in a swamp and no margin of runs was
enough comfort.
Reliever Jeff Ballard replaced
David Harris in the fifth inning of Sat
urday's final to get thfe win for Stan
ford. Giving up only one run in five
innings, Ballard was probably the
most effective pitcher in a hitter's
touranement.
The Cardinal jumped out to a
quick 3-0 lead, but it did not last long.

Pepperdine scored a run in the third
and three in the fourth to take a 4-3
advantage.
In the bottom of the inning, Stan
ford came back to score four runs.
Center fielder Darryl Stephens
started the inning with a solo home
run to left field. After shortstop Bob
DeCosta flied out to left, junior left
fielder Mike Dotterer reached first
on an error by the Wave second
baseman. Dotterer then moved to
second on a deep fly to center by
right fielder Mike Toothman.
Aldrete's double to left scored Dot
terer and was then followed by a two
run homer to left field by Buechele.
Pepperdine came right back in the
fifth inning. The first four batters
reached base in the inning cul
minating in a two-run single by first
baseman Jere Longenecker. That hit
spelled the end for Stanford starter
Harris. Although Ballard retired the
next three batters in order, the
Waves added another run when in
fielder Dana Saraceno tagged up on a
fly ball by infielder Larry Lee.
Stephens and Card third baseman
Loring Davies both scored in the bot
tom of the inning to give Stanford a
9-7 lead.
Stanford scored two more runs in
the sixth on RBI singles by Buechele
and Davies.
In the eighth inning, Stanford final
ly put the game away. The Cardinal
scored four runs, including Bue
chele's second homer of the game.
After the game, Marquess had
nothing but praise for Ballard. "You
could tell when Ballard went out
there that he had his rhythm," Mar
quess said. "We had to shut them
down because they kept coming
back and Baliard did the job."
"It's the first time in a long time
that I've felt real relaxed on jhe
mound," Ballard said. "I felt really
good tonight. It's a big confidence

The cardinal red bat of Steve Bue

As the only undefeated team after

while Fresno State and Pepperdine —

Stanford entered the top of the

his troops, it worked. The Cardinal
scored five runs in the top of the in

With one out, Fresno pitcher Rob

Bob DeCosta back to back. Dotterer
reached first on an error to load the
