The Card pulled another ace
from its hat, but it wasn't
enough to stop the Golden
Hurricanes of Tulsa in the first
annual NCAA Women's Golf
Championships at Stanford
Golf Course over the weekend.
The Oklahomans never let
up though the four-round
tournament, winning by a 36
stroke margin. Stanford fin
ished sixth, 56 shots off the
pace. Hurricane Kathy Baker
captured the individual crown,
edging out teammate Jody Ro
senthal by two shots.
The Cardinal's near disasterous
final round was offset by Kathy
Nino's hole-in-one on the
eighth hole using a seven-iron.
"I knew I hit it really well and
really close," the Card
sophomore explained. "It
landed about eight feet from
the pin, bounced once and
rolled toward the hole."
Teammate Diane Nixon aced
hole number three Wednes
day. "I thought it was really
bizare," Nino continued. "It's
rare that you have even one
hole-in-one in a tourament."
Tulsa blew away the 19 team
field with an 72-hole total of

1191, firing 294, 298,297 and 302
Wednesday through Saturday,
repectively. Baker led the way
with a three over par 295
(73-75-71-76) while Rosenthal
had rounds of 72, 73, 75 and 76.
In fact, Tulsa was so consis
tent that it relied solely on four
of its five golfers for scores
throughout the tourney.
Number 5 Lulong Hartley shot
in the 80s each day, putting the
pressure on Baker, Rosenthal,
Barb Thomas and Dee Dee
Lasker. But the latter four came
through in style, with Baker
and Rosental placing 1-2,
Thomas tying for third and
Lasker tying for seventh. All
four also had scores in the 70s
all four rounds.
Texas Christian placed sec
ond, totaling 1227
(301-311-313-302). "I don't like
finishing second," said TCU
coach Fred Warren. "But in this
case it was like winning a sepa
rate tournament."
Oklahoma State collected
thethird placetrophy by finish
ing six strokes behind TCU,
while Florida, second after
three rounds, faltered on the
final day and ended in fourth
postition. A stroke in front of
the Card was Texas A & M.
