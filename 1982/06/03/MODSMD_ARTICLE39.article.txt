The Card pulled another ace
from its hat, but it wasn't
enough to stop the Golden
Hurricanes of Tulsa in the first
annual NCAA Women's Golf
Championships at Stanford
Golf Course over the weekend.
The Oklahomans never let
up though the four-round
tournament, winning by a 36
stroke margin. Stanford fin
ished sixth, 56 shots off the
pace. Hurricane Kathy Baker
captured the individual crown,
edging out teammate Jody Ro
senthal by two shots.
The Cardinal's near disasterous
final round was offset by Kathy
Nino's hole-in-one on the
eighth hole using a seven-iron.
"I knew I hit it really well and
really close," the Card
sophomore explained. "It
landed about eight feet from
the pin, bounced once and
rolled toward the hole."
Teammate Diane Nixon aced
hole number three Wednes
day. "I thought it was really
bizare," Nino continued. "It's
rare that you have even one
hole-in-one in a tourament."
Tulsa blew away the 19 team
field with an 72-hole total of

1191, firing 294, 298,297 and 302
Wednesday through Saturday,
repectively. Baker led the way
with a three over par 295
(73-75-71-76) while Rosenthal
had rounds of 72, 73, 75 and 76.
In fact, Tulsa was so consis
tent that it relied solely on four
of its five golfers for scores
throughout the tourney.
Number 5 Lulong Hartley shot
in the 80s each day, putting the
pressure on Baker, Rosenthal,
Barb Thomas and Dee Dee
Lasker. But the latter four came
through in style, with Baker
and Rosental placing 1-2,
Thomas tying for third and
Lasker tying for seventh. All
four also had scores in the 70s
all four rounds.
Texas Christian placed sec
ond, totaling 1227
(301-311-313-302). "I don't like
finishing second," said TCU
coach Fred Warren. "But in this
case it was like winning a sepa
rate tournament."
Oklahoma State collected
thethird placetrophy by finish
ing six strokes behind TCU,
while Florida, second after
three rounds, faltered on the
final day and ended in fourth
postition. A stroke in front of
the Card was Texas A & M.

HOLE IN ONE — Kathy Nino of Stanford aced the 139-yard, par-3 eighth hole Saturday in
final round action of the NCAA Women's Golf Tournament at the Stanford Golf Course.
Stanford began the four-day
event on a promising note with
a stunning 297, only three be
hind the Golden Hurricanes.
"The next days were kind of a
let down," Nino said.
Two scores in the 80s on day
two left the Card in a tie for sec
ond with Florida and TCU. The
third round saw Stanford du
plicating the 315 tally, drop
ping it into fourth postion. A
final round 320 lowered the
Cardinal two more notches in
the standings.
"I don't think that we
reached our potential what
soever," Nino said. "I thought
we were prepared for it (the
NCAAs), but I don't know what
went wrong."
Junior Joanne Pacillo was the
highest Stanford finisher, tying
for 22nd with a 309
(74-76-82-77). A stroke behind
was the other half of the "illo"
pair, senior Lori Castillo
(71-79-79-81).
Nino (80-82-80-78) tied with
Debbie Barberio (77-78-80-85)
for 57th in the individual stand
ings with a 320 score. Freshman
Nixon (75-86-76-84), the sec
ond Card ace, checked in at
321.
The only real excitement
during the final round besides
Nino's hole-in-one centered
around the duel for individual
honors. At the turn, Baker held
a one-stroke margin over Ro
senthal, after each fired 37s
over the front nine.
Rosenthal parred the 17th

while Baker had a bogey 6 on
the 16th, cutting the latter's
lead to just two shots. Baker
parred both the 17th and 18th
to maintain her lead and obtain
the title.
"I had no idea how I stood,"
Baker said. "I thought if any
thing Jody (Rosenthal) was
ahead of me."
It wasn't until TCU's Anne
Kelly told Baker, after sinking
her final putt, that she was the
first ever NCAA individual
champ. "I looked at her and
said 'What?'," Baker con
tinued. "I never feel com
fortable until the last putt
drops."
Over the four days, the
course record 69 was tied four
times, once each by Oklahoma
State's Val Skinner and Flori
da's Lauri Rinker on Thursday
and Florida International's
Mary Ann Hayward and San
Jose State's Juli Inkster on Fri

The Oklahomans never let
up though the four-round
tournament, winning by a 36
stroke margin. Stanford fin
ished sixth, 56 shots off the
pace. Hurricane Kathy Baker
captured the individual crown,
edging out teammate Jody Ro
senthal by two shots.
The Cardinal's near disasterous
final round was offset by Kathy
Nino's hole-in-one on the
eighth hole using a seven-iron.
"I knew I hit it really well and
really close," the Card
sophomore explained. "It
landed about eight feet from
the pin, bounced once and
rolled toward the hole."
Teammate Diane Nixon aced
hole number three Wednes
day. "I thought it was really
bizare," Nino continued. "It's
rare that you have even one
hole-in-one in a tourament."
Tulsa blew away the 19 team
field with an 72-hole total of

1191, firing 294, 298,297 and 302
Wednesday through Saturday,
repectively. Baker led the way
with a three over par 295
(73-75-71-76) while Rosenthal
had rounds of 72, 73, 75 and 76.
In fact, Tulsa was so consis
tent that it relied solely on four
of its five golfers for scores
throughout the tourney.
Number 5 Lulong Hartley shot
in the 80s each day, putting the
pressure on Baker, Rosenthal,
Barb Thomas and Dee Dee
Lasker. But the latter four came
through in style, with Baker
and Rosental placing 1-2,
Thomas tying for third and
Lasker tying for seventh. All
four also had scores in the 70s
all four rounds.
Texas Christian placed sec
ond, totaling 1227
(301-311-313-302). "I don't like
finishing second," said TCU
coach Fred Warren. "But in this
case it was like winning a sepa
rate tournament."
Oklahoma State collected
thethird placetrophy by finish
ing six strokes behind TCU,
while Florida, second after
three rounds, faltered on the
final day and ended in fourth
postition. A stroke in front of
the Card was Texas A & M.

HOLE IN ONE — Kathy Nino of Stanford aced the 139-yard, par-3 eighth hole Saturday in
final round action of the NCAA Women's Golf Tournament at the Stanford Golf Course.
Stanford began the four-day
event on a promising note with
a stunning 297, only three be
hind the Golden Hurricanes.
"The next days were kind of a
let down," Nino said.
Two scores in the 80s on day
two left the Card in a tie for sec
ond with Florida and TCU. The
third round saw Stanford du
plicating the 315 tally, drop
ping it into fourth postion. A
final round 320 lowered the
Cardinal two more notches in
the standings.
"I don't think that we
reached our potential what
soever," Nino said. "I thought
we were prepared for it (the
NCAAs), but I don't know what
went wrong."
Junior Joanne Pacillo was the
highest Stanford finisher, tying
for 22nd with a 309
(74-76-82-77). A stroke behind
was the other half of the "illo"
pair, senior Lori Castillo
(71-79-79-81).
Nino (80-82-80-78) tied with
Debbie Barberio (77-78-80-85)
for 57th in the individual stand
ings with a 320 score. Freshman
Nixon (75-86-76-84), the sec
ond Card ace, checked in at
321.
The only real excitement
during the final round besides
Nino's hole-in-one centered
around the duel for individual
honors. At the turn, Baker held
a one-stroke margin over Ro
senthal, after each fired 37s
over the front nine.
Rosenthal parred the 17th

while Baker had a bogey 6 on
the 16th, cutting the latter's
lead to just two shots. Baker
parred both the 17th and 18th
to maintain her lead and obtain
the title.
"I had no idea how I stood,"
Baker said. "I thought if any
thing Jody (Rosenthal) was
ahead of me."
It wasn't until TCU's Anne
Kelly told Baker, after sinking
her final putt, that she was the
first ever NCAA individual
champ. "I looked at her and
said 'What?'," Baker con
tinued. "I never feel com
fortable until the last putt
drops."
Over the four days, the
course record 69 was tied four
times, once each by Oklahoma
State's Val Skinner and Flori
da's Lauri Rinker on Thursday
and Florida International's
Mary Ann Hayward and San
Jose State's Juli Inkster on Fri
day. The quartet shares the rec
ord with New Mexico's Kris
Monaghan, Texas Tech's Mary
DeLong and Barberio, who first
set it in 1980.
Tied with Tulsa's Thomas for
third was Inkster and Hayward.
Arizona State's Lauri Merten-
Peterson was alone in sixth
place with an even 300. Shirley
Furlong of Texas A & M and
Cathy Hanlon of Southern
Methodist tied with Skinner
and Hurricane Lasker for sev
enth a shot behind Merten-Pe
terson.
