Thatcher calls for Argentine surrender
London â€” British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher called on Argen
tina yesterday to withdraw its troops from the Falkland Islands within
the next few days to avoid a bloody battle for the capital of Stanley.
Thatcher said she would not delay the British military advance toward
the capital. But during the short time it will take British forces to prepare
for the battle, she said, she hoped that the Argentine military govern
ment might agree to a guaranteed, supervised withdrawal, which would
amount to surrender.
"No one would be more pleased than I should be if either (Argentine)
President (Leopoldo) Galtieri or the commander of their local garrison
should say, 'This is absurd that we should sacrifice our young people in
this way and we will not fight further,' " said the prime minister in an
interview with The Washington Post.
(British forces continued to pound Stanley yesterday, according to
their Royal Marine commander, and British correspondents on the
scene said the Marines had closed to within seven miles of the capital.)
Submitting to an interview for the first time since British troops
landed on the Falklands 12 days ago and began ground operations,
Thatcher said of the Argentines, "They must have a lot of fine young
men there. I know we have." She added, "You know what happened at
Goose Green and Darwin. There was a battle in the early stages and then
they suggested there should be a surrender."
Thatcher indicated her hope that the Argentine troops at Stanley
might similarly decide to surrender without authorization from Buenos
Aires after the battle had begun. Leaflets were dropped by British planes
Tuesday urging the Argentines to surrender, a senior British official said
Wednesday niaht.
