Thatcher calls for Argentine surrender
London — British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher called on Argen
tina yesterday to withdraw its troops from the Falkland Islands within
the next few days to avoid a bloody battle for the capital of Stanley.
Thatcher said she would not delay the British military advance toward
the capital. But during the short time it will take British forces to prepare
for the battle, she said, she hoped that the Argentine military govern
ment might agree to a guaranteed, supervised withdrawal, which would
amount to surrender.
"No one would be more pleased than I should be if either (Argentine)
President (Leopoldo) Galtieri or the commander of their local garrison
should say, 'This is absurd that we should sacrifice our young people in
this way and we will not fight further,' " said the prime minister in an
interview with The Washington Post.
(British forces continued to pound Stanley yesterday, according to
their Royal Marine commander, and British correspondents on the
scene said the Marines had closed to within seven miles of the capital.)
Submitting to an interview for the first time since British troops
landed on the Falklands 12 days ago and began ground operations,
Thatcher said of the Argentines, "They must have a lot of fine young
men there. I know we have." She added, "You know what happened at
Goose Green and Darwin. There was a battle in the early stages and then
they suggested there should be a surrender."
Thatcher indicated her hope that the Argentine troops at Stanley
might similarly decide to surrender without authorization from Buenos
Aires after the battle had begun. Leaflets were dropped by British planes
Tuesday urging the Argentines to surrender, a senior British official said
Wednesday niaht.
But Thatcher said she continued to doubt that
Galtieri's government would agree to withdraw
without attaching strings unacceptable to her.
"I've always thought it would be unlikely that a
dictator would withdraw, although after both
sides have suffered it is just remotely possible,"
she said. "But so far, I've seen no sign of it."
Thatcher said she thought President Ronald
Reagan would contribute to a "multinational
force" to protect the Falklands from a new Ar
gentine invasion after British troops left be
cause Britain agreed to participate in the U.S.-
led peace-keeping force that supervised the
withdrawal of Israeli troops from the Sinai. She
said she also hoped that at least one South
American country, which she would not name,
would participate.
Reagan arrives in Paris
Paris — President Ronald Reagan began his
most ambitious foreign journey yesterday, ar
riving at midnight on a mission designed to
strengthen the Atlantic alliance, gain support
for his arms control proposals and stem Europe
an complaints about high U.S. interest rates.
It was a low-key beginning to a 10-day jour
ney; no speech, no ceremony, only an um
brella-shielded walk along a red carpet to the
VIP terminal at Orly Airport.
Reagan and his wife Nancy were welcomed
by French Foreign Minister Claude Cheysson.
They went from the airport to the residence of
U.S. Ambassador Evan Griffith Galbraith to
spend the night.
The president left Washington declaring that
the industrial democracies are being tested,
perhaps more than ever before, and that it is
therefore important "to meet and renew our
bond."
Wjth an economic summit conference
scheduled this weekend in Versailles, Secretary
of the Treasury Donald Regan said "the presi
dent is not making this trip just to shake hands.

We're going to see what we can do to better the
economic conditions of the world."
Regan said the president "is not going to try
to impose his philosophy" at the economic
summit. "These are elected leaders," the secre
tary said. "What he is going to try to do is con
vince them that his policies are the best for the
United States."
From Paris and Versailles, Reagan is to travel
to Rome, London and Bonn, the latter fora
summit meeting of leaders of North Atlantic
Treaty Organization nations.
Budget battles continue
Washington — Key House leaders, heading
fora new budget showdown next week in a
sharply partisan mood, agreed yesterday to use
President Ronald Reagan's now-abandoned
February budget proposal as a vehicle for de
bate.
Neither Democrats nor Republicans expect
Reagan's spending plan, with an estimated defi
cit of $122.2 billion, to have any chance of pas
sage in the coming battle.
Instead, the House Budget Committee in
formally agreed to stage a classic confrontation
next Wednesday between the two rival budget
bills to be offered by Democratic and Re
publican leaders.
Reagan, who protested Saturday that his pro
posed budget never came to a vote in the
House, was expected to support a Republican
plan that would have a deficit closer to the $100
billion mark.

Thatcher calls for Argentine surrender
London — British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher called on Argen
tina yesterday to withdraw its troops from the Falkland Islands within
the next few days to avoid a bloody battle for the capital of Stanley.
Thatcher said she would not delay the British military advance toward
the capital. But during the short time it will take British forces to prepare
for the battle, she said, she hoped that the Argentine military govern
ment might agree to a guaranteed, supervised withdrawal, which would
amount to surrender.
"No one would be more pleased than I should be if either (Argentine)
President (Leopoldo) Galtieri or the commander of their local garrison
should say, 'This is absurd that we should sacrifice our young people in
this way and we will not fight further,' " said the prime minister in an
interview with The Washington Post.
(British forces continued to pound Stanley yesterday, according to
their Royal Marine commander, and British correspondents on the
scene said the Marines had closed to within seven miles of the capital.)
Submitting to an interview for the first time since British troops
landed on the Falklands 12 days ago and began ground operations,
Thatcher said of the Argentines, "They must have a lot of fine young
men there. I know we have." She added, "You know what happened at
Goose Green and Darwin. There was a battle in the early stages and then
they suggested there should be a surrender."
Thatcher indicated her hope that the Argentine troops at Stanley
might similarly decide to surrender without authorization from Buenos
Aires after the battle had begun. Leaflets were dropped by British planes
Tuesday urging the Argentines to surrender, a senior British official said
Wednesday niaht.
But Thatcher said she continued to doubt that
Galtieri's government would agree to withdraw
without attaching strings unacceptable to her.
"I've always thought it would be unlikely that a
dictator would withdraw, although after both
sides have suffered it is just remotely possible,"
she said. "But so far, I've seen no sign of it."
Thatcher said she thought President Ronald
Reagan would contribute to a "multinational
force" to protect the Falklands from a new Ar
gentine invasion after British troops left be
cause Britain agreed to participate in the U.S.-
led peace-keeping force that supervised the
withdrawal of Israeli troops from the Sinai. She
said she also hoped that at least one South
American country, which she would not name,
would participate.
Reagan arrives in Paris
Paris — President Ronald Reagan began his
most ambitious foreign journey yesterday, ar
riving at midnight on a mission designed to
strengthen the Atlantic alliance, gain support
for his arms control proposals and stem Europe
an complaints about high U.S. interest rates.
It was a low-key beginning to a 10-day jour
ney; no speech, no ceremony, only an um
brella-shielded walk along a red carpet to the
VIP terminal at Orly Airport.
Reagan and his wife Nancy were welcomed
by French Foreign Minister Claude Cheysson.
They went from the airport to the residence of
U.S. Ambassador Evan Griffith Galbraith to
spend the night.
The president left Washington declaring that
the industrial democracies are being tested,
perhaps more than ever before, and that it is
therefore important "to meet and renew our
bond."
Wjth an economic summit conference
scheduled this weekend in Versailles, Secretary
of the Treasury Donald Regan said "the presi
dent is not making this trip just to shake hands.

We're going to see what we can do to better the
economic conditions of the world."
Regan said the president "is not going to try
to impose his philosophy" at the economic
summit. "These are elected leaders," the secre
tary said. "What he is going to try to do is con
vince them that his policies are the best for the
United States."
From Paris and Versailles, Reagan is to travel
to Rome, London and Bonn, the latter fora
summit meeting of leaders of North Atlantic
Treaty Organization nations.
Budget battles continue
Washington — Key House leaders, heading
fora new budget showdown next week in a
