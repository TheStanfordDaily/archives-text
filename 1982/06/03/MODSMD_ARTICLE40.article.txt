## G. Parker proves to be more fun than a night in bed

Unfortunately, it seems that

Graham Parker
Warfield Theatre
25 May 1982
Being aware that proper
choice can make or break a
rock and roll concert ex
perience, I chose my drugs
very carefully before going to
the Graham Parker concert. I
finally decided on Prednisone
for that sore throat and fever,
with a Tylenol/codeine combo
for head and body aches. This, I
convinced myself, left the eve
ning clear fora night of solid
enjoyment.
Some people feel that a man
suffering from infectious
mononucleosis should not go
to concerts in the big city. I find
that I would most often agree
with them, except for the fact
that this was to be Graham
Parker's first and only Bay area
appearance of the past two
years. To me, an event like that
makes infecting the entire city
of San Francisco with a highly
debilitating viral infection pale
into insignificance.
The average reader may not
understand this devotion.
Graham Parker, from the days
when he first appeared on the

with unanimous praise and
hailed as a major talent. His first

Police have turned into reg

Parker has remained truest to
the fresh air music of the new
wave, and has the least to show
for it.
Don't think that things are
getting better for him. After
reaching No. 25 on the charts
with Squeezing Out Sparks, his
band, the Rumour, celebrated
his next album by breaking up
and leaving him. Obviously,
Parker is not a man who knows
how to coast on momentum.

Now he's touring behind his
new album, Another Grey
Area, and he's assembled a
new band. Given Parker's rep
utation as a very exciting per
former, there was no way I
would stay home.
After John Hyatt opened the
show with a very well-recieved
set — two encores — Parker
strode onstage and tore into his
show with "Discovering
Japan," a song from Sparks
about a Gl relationship. His
new band seemed a little weak

here, a little unsure about how
to go about playing the song.
Perhaps they aren't really a
rock band, I thought, as they
launched into a blocky, funky
version of "Jolie, Jolie." Here,
on a song that is not quite so
much of a rave as a writhe, the
band seemed much tighter and
more comfortable.
Parker has assembled an
odd-looking band. Rock's
number two short skinny Eng
lish guy with glasses has gotten
together an integrated band,
split down the middle: black
guitarist and bassist, white
drummer and lead guitarist.

Kevin Jenkins, on bass, stood
out in particular through the
show with his weird actions.
While Parker spent his time
straddling the mike and gestur
ing, and the two other
guitarists seemed fairly content
to bother their instruments,
Jenkins grappled his bass like a
man trying to subdue a large
bag of wolverines, popping his
neck far out and staggering
across the stage.
On "Fear Not" another band
member entered the stage,
Kirk McGettrick, on sax
aphone. On this song, like
"Thankless Task" and others,
McGettrick mostly played very
deep, growling notes- more for
atmosphere or texture than as a
lead. "Fear Not," in particular,
had a very densely textured
sound.
Parker then switched to his
older material, from the first
few albums. "White Honey,"
"Heat Treatment," and "Howl
ing Wind" he introduced as
dance numbers, inviting the
crowd to dance. This did not
please the theatre security.
From the vantage point of
the far right aisle seat I oc
cupied— a sort of penal colony
Bill Graham reserves for uppity
college papers — I watched as
obliging audience members
danced on the far sides and
were almost immediately

busted by ushers concerned
with the blockage of the view
of the amp stack.
By now the band was starting
to move along. Parker con
gratulated the band with
"Okay, now we're getting
somewhere!" and then spun
into a jerkily choreographed
version of the new single "You
Hit the Spot." After a psy
choticly entrancing version of
"Empty Lives" Parker closed
the show with "Nobody Hurts
You."
The song contained the im
age for the show — Parker,
isolated in the midst of his
band, reaching and pointing
with his long fingers, grabbing
at his temples, fury with a high
forehead. "Look!" he shouts,
"Nobody's going to illuminate
you/ All the odds are stacked
against you!"
After the close of the show
Parker returned for two en
cores, including "Stupe
faction" and "Big Fat Zero,"
two crowd pleasers that were
unfortunately too well de
signed to end the show on a
high note; neither one ended
as a final note, but rather set
the crowd up for more.
On the last song British rock
quasi-legend Brinsley Schwarz
finally took the stage to show
off his guitar playing, one ele

ment that had been somewhat
missing from the show. At the
end all three guitarists, Brown,
Schwarz, and Parker, gathered
at the center of the stage to
race the song to a finish. It
didn't look planned — Parker
looked slightly unwelcome —
but it made fora nice tableau to

close on.
Maybe Parker didn't win
over many new fans at the
show — who would go to a
Tuesday concert featuring an
unfamiliar act?— but it was def
initely a show to take the
monotony out of
mononucleosis.
