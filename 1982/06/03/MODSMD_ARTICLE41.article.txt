# Vocal crowd, instrumental band: versatile Dregs play Dixie and more

### Mark Zeigler 
The Dregs
Warfield Theatre/ San Francisco
14 May 1982
Hundreds of fans yell, scream and pound
the Warfield's stage. They want more. Final
ly, the band reenters the stage for its third
encore to louder yells, sharper screams and
harder pounds.
But the five men that walk on stage are not
the types one would expect to be the reci
pient of such a wild teen rage. One is balding
and has a beard. Another has hair to his
waist. Yet another wears his hair every which
way but loose. A fourth carries a violin.
No, they certainly don't appear to be the
bubble gum rock types — and they aren't.
They are the Dregs. Their name sounds like
one of a punk band — and it isn't. But, of
course, they must have a vocalist — and they
don^t.
Clearly and simply, the Dregs are the most
versatile band in America, if not in the world.
The Dregs, formerly the Dixie Dregs, can and
do play rock, jazz, fusion, country, classical,
and touch upon funk and punk at times.
Amazing, but true.
The Dregs also have somewhat of a cult fol
lowing — Dregs fans are dedicated. But
Dregs fans are also impatient, something
they proved rather rudely to the opening
band, Tommy. After Tommy, a heavily syn
thesized rock group (kind of a heavy metal
Styx), finished a song, the crowd started

chanting "Dregs, Dregs, Dregs" until Tom
my sort of shortened its already short show.
It was the fans' way of booing a "warm-up"
band off stage while still trying to abide by
proper concert etiquette.
Even before the quintet made its grand en
trance, one could feel the extra special elec
tricity characteristic of a Dregs concert. But
the electricity on May 14,1982, at San Fran
cicso's Warfield Theater, was extra, extra
special — the kind that predicts the show of a
lifetime. The forecast was correct, too.
The Dregs are known for their subtle sense
of humor, among other things. A few ex
amples: Their 1981 LP was entitled Unsung
Heros, riding on the fact that vocals in a
Dregs album are virtually non-existant. Car
rying the pun even further, the Dregs ap
peared on the album cover without mouths.
One of the groups' older albums is called
Night of the Living Dregs. On this 1982 con
cert tour, when the group played "Crank it
Up," one of only two Dregs' vocal tracks,
they brought out a mannikin and placed it in
front of a microphone while the words were
played from a recording.
Again demonstrating the ability to make
people laugh, the Dregs started the show
with a series of ads for useless items piped
over the loudspeakers; the title of their most
recent album is Industrial Standard. After
about five minutes of commercials for the
type of products you read about in Satur
day's mail, the Dregs opened with "As
sembly Line," the first song off Industrial

Standard.
Halfway through "Assembly Line," the
joke stopped. So did the song. The Dregs
broke into "Take it Off the Top," one of their
"hotter" rock tunes. From there on in they
were strictly serious and played music to
match.
At this point in time, a player introduction
is in order:
Steve Morse —guitarist, author of 95 per
cent of the songs. Plays fast, yet fluidly while
maintaining a distinctive style. Thought of to
be the next Santana or Beck by many in the
music world. Plays acoustic with equal
brilliance.
Andy West — balding and bearded bassist.
Although not as talented as other Dregs, is an
adequate performer and excellent vocalist
on "Disco Dregs," a tune only heard in con
cert.
Rod Morgenstein — drummer, left
handed with high hat to his right. Like
Morse, thought to have unlimited potential.
Plays fast and hard — Morgenstein is not a
quiet drummer.
T. Lavitz — keyboards, looks like he
belongs to Styx with his long, styled hair. Ex
cellent soloist, especially in country and rock
songs. Plays a straight jazz introduction well,
though, on a song from the 1980 LP, Dregs of
the Earth.
Mark O'Conner — violinist, the most re
cent addition to the band. National fiddling
champion for last few years. Used to play
with David Grisman. Because he is so fast, he

can play along side Morse's lightening quick
guitar riffs with ease.
Now, back to the show. After "Take it Off
the Top," the quintet jumped into the slower
"Divided We Stand," from Unsung Heros.
Next they played "Where's Dixie," a In
dustrial Standard tune. Later in the show, the
Dregs performed what is a close as they ever
come to heavy metal, "Bloodsucking
Leeches."
The Dregs versatility, however, does not
stop with their song selection. Lavitz can play
a clavinet, a skill he demonstrated during
"Rock and Roll Park." In the same tune,
O'Conner showed he has the ability to play
guitar nearly as fast as he does violin.
Yet another trademark of the Dregs is the
manner in which they solo. Instead of simply
devoting a few minutes to just one instru
ment, the quintet will feature two, three or
even all five band members in a single song,
all "dueling" against one another in a
circular fashion. As the song progresses, the
solos become shorter and shorter until the
circular soloing consists of just one note
from each person.
As the Dregs got farther into the show and
the yells, screams and pounds increased, the
quintet began to realize just what they had
accomplished — a superb superformance
completely captivating the sold out Warfield
crowd.
Before ending the concert with "The
Bash," the Dregs had a chance to do a first —
have an non-Dregs vocalist in concert. Alex

Lingerwood of Santana sang "Crank it Up" as
he did on Industrial Standard, sparing the
audience of a date with a manakin.
In fact, such a hit was Lingerwood that he
made a second appearance for an encore to
sing an old blues song with the band. Speak
ing of encores, the Dregs had no choice but
to come out fora second and a third given
the crowd responce — most people from the
balcony came down into the orchestra, fill
ing the aisles and area in front of the stage.
The Warfield was a rockin'.
The Dregs played a fair amount of In
dustrial Standard in concert, proving once
again that they can put out fine album after
album. Although the 1982 LP is not quite as
good as Unsung Heros, an album nobody
should be without, it is well above the in
dustry standard in both the rock and fusion
departments.
The LP is a bit more varied than past
albums, especially since it contains two vocal
tracks, "Ridin' High," sung by Doobie
Brother Patrick Simmons, and "Crank it Up."
With the latter, the Dregs obviously tried to
make a teen rock hit, and true to Dregs stan
dards, it is receiving airplay on KOME, KSJO,
KMEL and the like.
Though the Dregs only played their rock,
country and fusion songs in concert, the
show was still unbelievable and undoubted
ly a once-in-a-lifetime experience.
As the satiated fans filed out of the War
field, one in particular yelled "Thank you."
You see, Dregs fans can be polite after all.

It was the fans' way of booing a "warm-up"
band off stage while still trying to abide by
proper concert etiquette.
Even before the quintet made its grand en
trance, one could feel the extra special elec
tricity characteristic of a Dregs concert. But
the electricity on May 14,1982, at San Fran
cicso's Warfield Theater, was extra, extra
special — the kind that predicts the show of a
lifetime. The forecast was correct, too.
The Dregs are known for their subtle sense
of humor, among other things. A few ex
amples: Their 1981 LP was entitled Unsung
Heros, riding on the fact that vocals in a
Dregs album are virtually non-existant. Car
rying the pun even further, the Dregs ap
peared on the album cover without mouths.
One of the groups' older albums is called
Night of the Living Dregs. On this 1982 con
cert tour, when the group played "Crank it
Up," one of only two Dregs' vocal tracks,
they brought out a mannikin and placed it in
front of a microphone while the words were
played from a recording.
Again demonstrating the ability to make
people laugh, the Dregs started the show
with a series of ads for useless items piped
over the loudspeakers; the title of their most
recent album is Industrial Standard. After
about five minutes of commercials for the
type of products you read about in Satur
day's mail, the Dregs opened with "As
sembly Line," the first song off Industrial

Standard.
Halfway through "Assembly Line," the
joke stopped. So did the song. The Dregs
broke into "Take it Off the Top," one of their
"hotter" rock tunes. From there on in they
were strictly serious and played music to
match.
At this point in time, a player introduction
is in order:
Steve Morse —guitarist, author of 95 per
cent of the songs. Plays fast, yet fluidly while
maintaining a distinctive style. Thought of to
be the next Santana or Beck by many in the
music world. Plays acoustic with equal
brilliance.
Andy West — balding and bearded bassist.
Although not as talented as other Dregs, is an
adequate performer and excellent vocalist
on "Disco Dregs," a tune only heard in con
cert.
Rod Morgenstein — drummer, left
handed with high hat to his right. Like
Morse, thought to have unlimited potential.
Plays fast and hard — Morgenstein is not a
quiet drummer.
T. Lavitz — keyboards, looks like he
belongs to Styx with his long, styled hair. Ex
cellent soloist, especially in country and rock
songs. Plays a straight jazz introduction well,
though, on a song from the 1980 LP, Dregs of
the Earth.
Mark O'Conner — violinist, the most re
cent addition to the band. National fiddling
champion for last few years. Used to play
with David Grisman. Because he is so fast, he

can play along side Morse's lightening quick
guitar riffs with ease.
Now, back to the show. After "Take it Off
the Top," the quintet jumped into the slower
"Divided We Stand," from Unsung Heros.
Next they played "Where's Dixie," a In
dustrial Standard tune. Later in the show, the
Dregs performed what is a close as they ever
come to heavy metal, "Bloodsucking
Leeches."
The Dregs versatility, however, does not
stop with their song selection. Lavitz can play
a clavinet, a skill he demonstrated during
"Rock and Roll Park." In the same tune,
O'Conner showed he has the ability to play
guitar nearly as fast as he does violin.
Yet another trademark of the Dregs is the
manner in which they solo. Instead of simply
devoting a few minutes to just one instru
ment, the quintet will feature two, three or
even all five band members in a single song,
all "dueling" against one another in a
circular fashion. As the song progresses, the
solos become shorter and shorter until the
circular soloing consists of just one note
from each person.
As the Dregs got farther into the show and
the yells, screams and pounds increased, the
quintet began to realize just what they had
accomplished — a superb superformance
completely captivating the sold out Warfield
crowd.
Before ending the concert with "The
Bash," the Dregs had a chance to do a first —
have an non-Dregs vocalist in concert. Alex

Lingerwood of Santana sang "Crank it Up" as
he did on Industrial Standard, sparing the
audience of a date with a manakin.
In fact, such a hit was Lingerwood that he
made a second appearance for an encore to
sing an old blues song with the band. Speak
ing of encores, the Dregs had no choice but
to come out fora second and a third given
the crowd responce — most people from the
balcony came down into the orchestra, fill
ing the aisles and area in front of the stage.
The Warfield was a rockin'.
The Dregs played a fair amount of In
dustrial Standard in concert, proving once
again that they can put out fine album after
album. Although the 1982 LP is not quite as
good as Unsung Heros, an album nobody
should be without, it is well above the in
dustry standard in both the rock and fusion
departments.
The LP is a bit more varied than past
albums, especially since it contains two vocal
tracks, "Ridin' High," sung by Doobie
Brother Patrick Simmons, and "Crank it Up."
With the latter, the Dregs obviously tried to
make a teen rock hit, and true to Dregs stan
dards, it is receiving airplay on KOME, KSJO,
KMEL and the like.
Though the Dregs only played their rock,
country and fusion songs in concert, the
show was still unbelievable and undoubted
ly a once-in-a-lifetime experience.
As the satiated fans filed out of the War
field, one in particular yelled "Thank you."
You see, Dregs fans can be polite after all.
The Dregs
Warfield Theatre/ San Francisco
14 May 1982
Hundreds of fans yell, scream and pound
the Warfield's stage. They want more. Final
ly, the band reenters the stage for its third
encore to louder yells, sharper screams and
harder pounds.
But the five men that walk on stage are not
the types one would expect to be the reci
pient of such a wild teen rage. One is balding
and has a beard. Another has hair to his
waist. Yet another wears his hair every which
way but loose. A fourth carries a violin.
No, they certainly don't appear to be the
bubble gum rock types — and they aren't.
They are the Dregs. Their name sounds like
one of a punk band — and it isn't. But, of
course, they must have a vocalist — and they
don^t.
Clearly and simply, the Dregs are the most
versatile band in America, if not in the world.
The Dregs, formerly the Dixie Dregs, can and
do play rock, jazz, fusion, country, classical,
and touch upon funk and punk at times.
Amazing, but true.
The Dregs also have somewhat of a cult fol
lowing — Dregs fans are dedicated. But
Dregs fans are also impatient, something
they proved rather rudely to the opening
band, Tommy. After Tommy, a heavily syn
thesized rock group (kind of a heavy metal
Styx), finished a song, the crowd started

chanting "Dregs, Dregs, Dregs" until Tom
my sort of shortened its already short show.
