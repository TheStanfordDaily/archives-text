# Pure entertainment, widespread appeal

Joseph was a washout from
Topeka, Kansas; Pharaoh had a
nasal New York accent and
Potiphar's wife was shy and re
tiring. But that was backstage.
Onstage the cast of Lloyd Web
ber and Rice's Joseph and his
Amazing Technicolor Dream
coat vibrated life in a most
bouyant fashion.
The performers made no at
tempt to hide the fact that they
were really enjoying them
selves just singing loud and
hoofing hard as they estab
lished a tongue-in-cheek rep
artee with the audience. The
result was a gleeful cartoon by
the writers of Jesus Christ Su
perstar and Evita, with enough
polish and camp to give its G
rating widespread appeal.
It was the tale of a dreamer,
taken from the biblical story of
Joseph, favorite son of Jacob
and interpreter of Pharaoh's
dreams. The story moves from
the Canaanite home of Joseph
and his 11 jealous brothers
down the River Nile to the pyr
amids and palaces of exotic an
cient Egypt. We see Joseph
(Michael Crouch) follow his
dream (of having the "sun and
moon and stars" all bow down
to him) through fraternal per
secution, slavery and imprison
ment right up to Pharaoh's
court and a position as the
ruler's right-hand man. As one
cast-member put it, the show's

message is that "anyone from
anywhere can make it if he gets
a lucky break ..
... And if he has some im
agination, for that is truly the
stuff from which Joseph is
made. Webber's music lilts and
swings in a unique style and
Rice's lyrics exude cleverness.
Starting with a sunglassed
show-stopper, "Jacob and
Sons," the ensuing numbers
include a country western
"One More Angel in Heaven,"
which is the brothers' gentle
way of telling their father that
Joe is "no longer with them
(he's ,been sold to the
Ishmaelites)." Then there's
Pharaoh's '50s narration of his
dream bop-shoo-wah-doo
wah, bop-bop-shoo-wah-doo
wah, ze pauvre famine-starved
brotheres who zing "Those Ca
naan Days" from zer gloomy
parisienne cafe, and the
brrrrrrr-cha-cha "Benjamin
Calypso," an effort to ex
ascerbate the youngest brother
from apparent guilt in a staged
theft.
Tony Tanner's direction and
choreography is equally in
novative, capitalizing on hu
mor and a simplicity which al
lows for perfect synchroniza
tion. The Canaan scenes make
use of staffs and farm-hand im
itations while the Nile scenes
are full of stylized Egyptian
movements. The dance of
Potiphar's wife (Lorena

Palacios) comes the closest of
any to warranting parental gui
dance. However, the lady's at
tempts to seduce Joseph
amount finally to all boa and no
bite.
The acting was pure ham
bone with just enough sincer
ity to bring it off digestibly, and
when lapses of over-ch?"-
cature did occur the ex
uberance and energy of the

performers made forgiving
easy. Most guilty of such lapses
was lead Crouch. His smug grin
and woe-be-gotten look were
at times too skit-like for high
priced pleasure. Wayne Brian
(Potiphar), Palacios and
Michael Speero (Pharoah)
were all convincing comedians
and the dynamic "II brothers"
were extremely successful at
audience captivation and

mood creation. Narrator
Sharon Brown, however, was
the real heart-stealer. Her rich
voice and compassionate
guardian-angel character com
bined to engage both cast and
theatre-goers alike.
What made Joseph such
pure entertainment? "Well,
there's a great amount of love
there," said Crouch.
