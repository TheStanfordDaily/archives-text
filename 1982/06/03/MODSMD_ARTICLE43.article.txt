# A 						'fleet' of new singers

The law of supply and demand applies to almost anything
â€” including male harmony groups here. The Mendicants
face many applicants and engagements each year, and The
Fleet Street Singers plan to help meet the demand.
The Fleet Street Singers will hold joint auditions with the
Mendicants next fall. Director Timothy "T-Bag" Biglow
said, "There are a lot of people on campus who would like
to sing. The Mendicants cannot provide all the spaces."
The Fleet Street Singers (named after the demon barber
of Fleet Street in the musical Sweeney Todd) officially began
winter quarter under the direction of Biglow. The 13-mem
ber all-male group, which originated as a barbershop
quartet four years ago, offers barbershop blend and close
harmony.
Unlike the Mendicants, the Fleet Street Singers sing
without instrumental accompaniment. They are also more
theatrical than the Mendicants. Humor abounds: one of the
groups' most popular numbers is Kyle Kashima's arrange
ment of Mister Rogers' "It's a Beautiful Day in the Neigh
borhood." Everyone in the group is a ham, said Biglow.
As a result of their more colorful selections, the Fleet
Street Singers have met with some unusual crowd reaction.
For example, when singing "Shine on Me," which actually
concerns a lighthouse, a male student who had recently re
turned from a rush party "shined" the group.
They accept engagements at parties, house meetings,
special dinners and other social gatherings, in addition to
performing at the Coffee House and giving a surprise con
cert at LOTS, they sang at more than one study break per
week. The Singers also respond to phone requests such as
birthday songs. They will call long distance to sing "Happy
Birthday" or "You swine, why haven't you written."
The group does not charge for on campus performances.
Group member junior Chris Scheck added, "Of course we
haven't done anything off campus."
