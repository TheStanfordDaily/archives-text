# McCartney's getting by-with help from his friends

Tug of War
Paul McCartney
Columbia Records
When the subject of ex-Beatles comes up,
especially Paul McCartney, one can only talk
about a songwriter's fall from grace. Paul
McCartney, once a classic composer and a
rocker with the intensity of a Little Richard,
now was seen as a sappy, meaningless pop
star, whose merit to current musical trends
was nil. Only his Band on the Run/Venus and
Mars (1974-1976) period was worthy of a Bea
tle, and with such dross as London Town or
McCartney II being released since then, it
seems as if that was the last gasp of life in him.
However, when one feels deeply about
McCartney (as I do), these shortcomings can
be forgotten. After all, the magic of the
Beatles is embedded somewhere in the past,
and the standards that McCartney (or any ex-
Beatle) would have had to achieve were just
too hard to maintain.

To add to this, John Lennon's tragic death
in 1980 placed the pressure to keep up the
musical integrity of the Beatles squarely on
McCartney's shoulders. Personally, I hoped
that his new album would just be able to
stand up on its own. The glory days of Abbey
Road are now just memories on vinyl, but if
McCartney is to be just a pop tunesmith,
then he might as well write meaningful lyrics
to exquisitely crafted pop rockers and
ballads. Thankfully, his new album Tug of
War is exactly this and more. Although not a
true rock and roll album, it is an amazing ar
ray of musical diversity that incorporates ev
ery aspect of popular music and makes it
credible.
The main reasons behind the success of
this album, in comparison to his other solo
releases, can be pinpointed to three factors:
(1) the influence of the collaborators and
quality musicians on the album; (2) the re
flective and conceptual theme of the album
lyrically; and (3) the willingness of Paul Mc-
Cartney to finally understand that life is no
longer a "Silly Love Song," and that he is no
longer required to "Carry That Weight." In
other words, McCartney is letting one see his

flaws and weaknesses. He has finally realized
that life is like the title of the album â€” a "Tug
of War."
To expand on the first and main reason for
the album's success, one must understand
the need for McCartney to have strong and
talented collaborators. With the Beatles, Mc-
Cartney's tendency toward triteness and

homeyness were kept in line by Lennon. This
is not generalizing that Lennon composed all
of the harsher material while McCartney
wrote the sweeter stuff. They both wrote ad
mirably in either style, but it was the col
laboration, and if not a direct collaboration,
then it was a strong positive competitive fac
tor, that resulted in each composer writing
more substantial material than they could as

individuals.
However, as a solo artist (or as a "Wing"),
McCartney has lacked a true powerful col
laborator to bounce ideas off or to be in
competition with. This, therefore, has led
McCartney to lose touch with "serious" rock
and roll songwriting in favor of simpler,
pleasant pop tunes.

However, for this album, McCartney is not
willing to take it easy. He has employed the
Beatles' producer, George Martin, who adds
a Beatlesque mystique and an underlying
foundation to the majority of songs on Tug
of War. This is most obvious on the album's
title track, where Martin's orchestration
enables the song'sphilosophy of life to tran
scend the boundaries of the record groove.

When McCartney imagines a mere peace
ful time, Martin's orchestration lends an up
lifting, emotional power, not unlike the clas
sical overtones of, iay, "Penny Lane" or "A
Day in the Life." The best part of this col
laboration, though, is that when McCartney
does lean towards his weaknesses of simple,
sappy writing (as in"The Pound Is Sinking"
or "Dress Me Up As a Rocker"), Martin adds
a background score that diminishes Mc-
Cartney's failings.
The other major collaborator is Stevie
Wonder. Although Wonder only partici
pates on two songs, his presence is felt
throughout the album. The first one is the
popular hit "Ebony and Ivory," which even
with its being simple in structure, is a mean
ingful statement on racial relationships. Both
Wonder and McCartney sing "in perfect
harmony," pleading with the world to do the
same.
On the other hand, their other collabora
tion, "What's That You're Doing?", is a po
tent funk dance number that is McCartney's

most overtly sexual number since "Why
Don't We Do It In the Road?" The song may
turn off many white rock listeners but the
song really pulls in the listener as McCartney
shows off his vocal abilities matching Won
der's funk singing. The song also brings back
the past as McCartney shouts a funk-style
"She loves you, yeah, yeah, yeah" as the
song fades out, bringing to mind the same
line he added at the end of "All You Need Is
Love." In doing this, he is accepting his past,
a problem that has haunted him for years.
Secondly, the album, although not specifi
cally a "concept" album, does have a re
flective theme. McCartney's own tug of war
involves a combining of opposite forces, and
instead of ending up at opposing ends of the
spectrum, he pulls the opposing ends closer
together. His songs run the gamut from
rockabilly ("Get It," incidentally sung with
Carl Perkins of "Blue Suede Shoes" fame) to
acoustic ballads to infectious pop rock. In
putting together all of these diverse styles,
he ends up fusing them together in a harmo
nious pattern. By contemplating the tug of
wars found in life and by setting up both pros
and cons, McCartney is striving to keep sane

while still realizing the harsh realities of the
world. As he expresses in the title track, "In
years to come, they may discover what the
air we breathe and the life we lead are all
about, but it won't be soon enough, soon
enough for me."
Logically, if McCartney was to relate to us
life's hardships, death would have to be
mentioned. And in one of McCartney's most
poignant acoustic numbers ever, he has writ
ten a tribute to John Lennon. Accompanied
by a gorgeous classical string quartet, as on
"Yesterday," McCartney looks back upon
his years with John affectionately and pas
sionately. As he expresses, "But as for me, I
still remember how it was before; and I am
holding back the tears no more. I love
you...
This overall acceptance of his past and his
overall understanding that life is always
coupled with death leads to the third reason
for the album's success: McCartney has con
cluded that although good and bad must go
together, life can still be joyous and hopeful.

He has finally accepted his tug of war
without the burden of "carrying that
weight." This new outlook on the meaning
of life allows McCartney, as a mortal ex-Bea
tle, to stop ignoring his past. He finally lets
his true feelings show
The only flaw of this album (if it is one at
all) is that although this may be McCartney's
most finely crafted album since Abbey Road
or Band On The Run, he doesn't really give
us a true, gutsy rock and roll number. He
hasn't written the powerful, moving rocker
that he is capable of (after all, this is the Bea
tle who wrote "Get Back," "Helter Skelter,"
and "Paperback Writer"). He never lets
loose with a Little Richard holler (although
he does tease us with a throaty yell near the
end of "Ballroom Dancing"), and therefore
some hardcore rock fans may be turned off
by the album.
Still, the scope of the album both lyrically
and musically easily makes up for this one
flaw. Hopefully, if McCartney continues to
relish in his tug of war, he'll be able to recap
ture his tumultuous rock 'n' roll youth and
bring forth more rock masterpieces, rather
than this pop par excellence.
