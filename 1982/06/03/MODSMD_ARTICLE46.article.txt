As we headed for dinner at
Palo Alto Joe's, we were
momentarily delayed by the
fact that it did not appear on
our map of Palo Alto. But a
quick phone call toa very help
ful hostess quickly clarified the
restaurant's location as being
just off San Antonio Road. For
tunately, it was well worth the
search.
Though the restaurant was
fairly busy, we were seated im
mediately and were promptly
brought a loaf of warm
sourdough bread. While
sampling the bread and study
ing the extensive menu, we
took time to look around the
restaurant. The atmosphere at
Joe's is casual and unhurried
and the clientele seems to be
mostly of the 20s and 30s age
group, either on a date or out
to dinner with a few friends
(though we did notice several
families with children). Palo
Alto Joe's has a complete wine
list and there is also a separate
bar for these who are not in
terested in dinner.
The selection at Joe's consists
of sandwiches, pasta, meat, fish
and poultry. Prices for entrees
range from $4.25 for Ravoli to
$11.50 for New York Steak, with
most prices falling in the $5 to
$8 range. Entrees are served
with pasta, french fries or vege
tables, and .or $3 extra, soup,
salad, coffee and ice cream will
be added to complete your
meal.
In addition to the main
menu, four different specials
are offered each day of the
week. These may be selected as
an entree, or as a complete din
ner for $2 extra. My guest and I
both chose selections from this
special menu — I chose the
Chicken Cacciatore for $8.95,

and my guest chose the
Scalone Provencale for $9.95

Almost as soon as
we had ordered,
our waitress
brought us the soup
— a robust
minestrone chock
full of vegetables
and beans, and the
more delicate
"pastina in broth"
— a chicken broth
with tiny beads of
pasta. Following the
soup we received
our salads — a
mixture of fresh
greens served with
a rather mediocre
house Italian
dressing.

When we received our entrees,
we were sorry we had so
meticulously finished off our
soupandsalad,forthe portions
were generous and included
either pasta (with the chicken)
or french fries (with the
scalone).
My Chicken Cacciatore in
cluded four pieces of chicken

in a tomato and vegetable
sauce that was very tasty but
slightly greasy. The scalone
cutlets were truly delightful —
lightly breaded and served in a
delicious lemon-wine sauce.
At this point we were so full
we had to refuse the rich des
serts that were listed on the
menu — cheesecake, Venetian
spumoni with sliced almonds
and the specialty — Zabaione,
a warm wine custard. Instead
we ordered the chocolate ice
cream which came with our
meal and were surprised to
find that it was very rich and
creamy — a rarity outside of
the classic ice cream shops
Palo Alto Joe's is certainly a
restaurant where one with a
hearty appetite should go. My
guest and I agreed that it is a
place we will be sure to return
to — whether fora date, an out
ing with a few friends, or to
bring our parents to on gradu
ation weekend.
