Neptune's Palace
Pier 39
San Francisco
Pier 39 has gained a reputa
tion among the City's natives as
being a "nice, clean tourist at
traction." The atmosphere is a
far cry from the Ripley's Be
lieve-lt-Or-Not section of the
Wharf which lines the street
only two blocks away. Pier 39
has no automated figures solic
iting viewers through speakers
or video tape teasers showing
the thrills and chills waiting in
side.
Rather, Pier 39 is a creatively
structured tangle of shops and
sights extending the length of a
wooden pier. The collection
includes clothing and gift
shops, galleries, an arcade,
jewellers, and ... ah yes, res
taurants. Pick a type of food;
hot dogs, pizza, Mexican food,
steak houses — you can have it
all. But if seafood is your
choice, don't loiter among the
buckle shops or tourist stops.

Walk straight to the end of the
pier (upper level) and prepare
to experience some of the best
seafood you've ever tasted at
Neptune's Palace.
Upon entering Neptune's
Palace, I was impressed by the
absence of crusty starfish
tossed in drooping canopies of
fish net — the status quo in so
many seafood restaurants. In
stead I found high, open ceil
ings with tastefully dim chan
deliers, live plants, candles on
the tables and a wall of glass of
fering an incredible view of the
bay. We were shown to the bar
while our table was being pre
pared.

Upon entering
Neptune's Palace, I
was impressed by
the absence of
crusty starfish
tossed in drooping
canopies offish net
— the status quo at
so many seafood
restaurants. Instead
I found high, open
ceilings with
tastefully dim
chandeliers, live
plants, candles on
the tables and a wall
of glass offering an
incredible view of
the bay.

The bar was a rather strange
conglomeration of decorative
ideas: floor tiles surrounding
the bar, floral carpet in the
lounge and a copper-tiled ceil
ing. The decor, along with the

whit- of the blender and the
roar of the crowd, gave the
lounge a nice-place-to-wait
f or-d inner- but-1- would n 't
want-to-drink-there at
mosphere.
We were soon shown to our
table, located in a prime spot
against the windows. From my
seat above the bay, I could see
Alcatraz, the Golden Gate, the
Ghiradelli tower and the lights
of Sausalito.
And what a menu! The selec
tion was extensive from its 11
appetizers to its two pages of
delectably described entrees.
For the sake of the review, we
decided to begin with an ap
petizer and work our way
through the menu to dessert.
We began our meal sharing the
sauteed mushrooms which
were served in a wonderful
buttery cream sauce.
Next we chose salads from
Neptune's creative listings. I
had the avocado and melon
salad which was served on a
chilled plate and sprinkled
with a creamy vinagerette
dressing — delicious. My part
ner had a green salad of butter
lettuce topped with the house
vinegarette.
The arrival of the entrees
confirmed all my optimistic
feelings about Neptune's Pal
ace. I ordered the grilled shark,
which was very good, although
slightly overgrilled. On the rec
ommendation of our waitress,
my partner chose the poached
salmon with Holandaise sauce.
I always hesitate to order fish
poached since it takes on a
hard boiled egg yolk texture if
not prepared correctly. My
fears were soon quieted when I
sampled the absolutely best
salmon I have ever tasted.
The meal was served with a
flourish as the cover was cere
moniously whisked from each
plate before it was placed in
front of us. Our waitress served

us with such a fanfare of or
namental gesturing that I had
the urge to applaud each time
she made a stiff-kneed bow to
signal the completion of a task.

Had it not been a review, I
don't believe I would have
found room for dessert. But for
the Daily — I managed. The
dessert cart was an impressive
grouping of delicacies includ
ing zabione with fruit (kiwi or
strawberries), strawberries and
cream, mousse and a collection
of tortes and cakes. We shared
the strawberries and cream
with after-dinner coffee.
The price for the entrees
starts at $8.95. They also have a
very appetizing brunch and
luncheon menu. They have
both imported and domestic
wines and are very helpful in
selecting the right wine to
complement your meal.
Neptune's Palace is a restau
rant that is attractive to any
seafood lover. It's a great place
to take a date, a group of
friends, or an out-of-town vis
itor. Better yet, wait for Mom
and Dad to visit and have them
take you. Neptune's Palace ap
peals to a wide variety of tastes
but especially to those with a
taste for delicious seafood.

friends, or an out-of-town vis

and Dad to visit and have them
take you. Neptune's Palace ap

Neptune's Palace
Pier 39
San Francisco
Pier 39 has gained a reputa
tion among the City's natives as
being a "nice, clean tourist at
traction." The atmosphere is a
far cry from the Ripley's Be
lieve-lt-Or-Not section of the
Wharf which lines the street
only two blocks away. Pier 39
has no automated figures solic
iting viewers through speakers
or video tape teasers showing
the thrills and chills waiting in
side.
Rather, Pier 39 is a creatively
structured tangle of shops and
sights extending the length of a
wooden pier. The collection
includes clothing and gift
shops, galleries, an arcade,
jewellers, and ... ah yes, res
taurants. Pick a type of food;
hot dogs, pizza, Mexican food,
steak houses — you can have it
all. But if seafood is your
choice, don't loiter among the
buckle shops or tourist stops.

Walk straight to the end of the
pier (upper level) and prepare
to experience some of the best
seafood you've ever tasted at
Neptune's Palace.
Upon entering Neptune's
Palace, I was impressed by the
absence of crusty starfish
tossed in drooping canopies of
fish net — the status quo in so
many seafood restaurants. In
stead I found high, open ceil
ings with tastefully dim chan
deliers, live plants, candles on
the tables and a wall of glass of
fering an incredible view of the
bay. We were shown to the bar
while our table was being pre
pared.

The bar was a rather strange
conglomeration of decorative
ideas: floor tiles surrounding
the bar, floral carpet in the
lounge and a copper-tiled ceil
ing. The decor, along with the

whit- of the blender and the
roar of the crowd, gave the
lounge a nice-place-to-wait
f or-d inner- but-1- would n 't
want-to-drink-there at
mosphere.
We were soon shown to our
table, located in a prime spot
against the windows. From my
seat above the bay, I could see
Alcatraz, the Golden Gate, the
Ghiradelli tower and the lights
of Sausalito.
And what a menu! The selec
tion was extensive from its 11
appetizers to its two pages of
delectably described entrees.
For the sake of the review, we
decided to begin with an ap
petizer and work our way
through the menu to dessert.
We began our meal sharing the
sauteed mushrooms which
were served in a wonderful
buttery cream sauce.
Next we chose salads from
Neptune's creative listings. I
had the avocado and melon
salad which was served on a
chilled plate and sprinkled
with a creamy vinagerette
dressing — delicious. My part
ner had a green salad of butter
lettuce topped with the house
vinegarette.
The arrival of the entrees
confirmed all my optimistic
feelings about Neptune's Pal
ace. I ordered the grilled shark,
which was very good, although
slightly overgrilled. On the rec
ommendation of our waitress,
my partner chose the poached
salmon with Holandaise sauce.
I always hesitate to order fish
poached since it takes on a
hard boiled egg yolk texture if
not prepared correctly. My
fears were soon quieted when I
sampled the absolutely best
salmon I have ever tasted.
The meal was served with a
flourish as the cover was cere
moniously whisked from each
plate before it was placed in
front of us. Our waitress served

us with such a fanfare of or
namental gesturing that I had
the urge to applaud each time
she made a stiff-kneed bow to
signal the completion of a task.

Had it not been a review, I
don't believe I would have
found room for dessert. But for
the Daily — I managed. The
dessert cart was an impressive
grouping of delicacies includ
ing zabione with fruit (kiwi or
strawberries), strawberries and
cream, mousse and a collection
of tortes and cakes. We shared
the strawberries and cream
