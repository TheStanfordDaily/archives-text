Tucked behind a quaint
brick facade on University Ave

Santa Maddelena, a gourmet,

sense that patrons slide plastic
trays down a stainless steel
counter, pointing and select

casual and quick place to stop

We chose an antipasto of
artichoke hearts vinaigrette
($3.75), passing up the
calamare marine (cuttlefish).
Appetizers ranged from Italian
meatballs to Lasagna (most are
in the $5 {p $6.50 range), and
half servings are available (for
$3.25). Portions are generous
and our "hasher" suggested
the canneloni, eggplant
parmesan and tortellini
Alfredo.
Each entree is served with
French bread and steamed
vegetables. We chose to com
plement the meal with a bottle
of the house wine, a Frascatti
Fontana Candida at $6.50 per
bottle; other wines ranging in
price to $13 are available as
well.
Patrons are escorted to their
tables by a green-aproned
waiter; ours, Gaston from
Montreal, whipped a clean
linen napkin to the lady's lap
with professional panache and
told us he just moved to Palo
Alto from Canada and has a vio
lin he'd like to sell. A person
able and friendly chap, he was
later to give valuable advice on
proper dessert selection.
The artichoke hearts were
marinated nicely, neither
soggy nor underdone, and
were complemented by the
wine Gaston poured for us. It
was a crisp whife wine, with a
rather fine presence in the
glass, dry but not to the point of

being pretentious, assertive yet
not cloying.
Our carrot and zucchini
strips were steamed to utter
perfection and the light butter
and garlic sauce brought out
their full flavor and fresh crispi
ness. The eggplant parmesan,

smothered in a thick red
marinara sauce with just
enough garlic and spices to
make it interesting, was quite
good indeed, although per
haps a bit pedestrian. Can
neloni, similar to a large

macaroni stuffed with meat
and mozzerella cheese, was
also good, but the best of the
three entrees we sampled was
unquestionably the tortellini
Alfredo. Like small round
ravioli filled with cheese, the
tortellini were just a bit on the
heavy side, but not overbear
ingly so, and the white creamy
Alfredo sauce (one of three of
fered) was light, not at all
lumpy, and generally made the
dish a must fora next visit.
By the time the last tortellino
had been savoured and the
amusing little wine three
fourths finished, Gaston in
formed us that we had neg
lected to choose anything for
dessert. Caffe Santa Mad
dalena offers a wide variety of
tempting treats; strawberry
tart, almond toite, Italian
sponge cake, cheese cake,
chocolate hazelnut cake and
others are displayed in a glass
case which we had missed on
our way in. Gaston recom
mended the first three on the
list, hinting that the strawberry
tart was his favorite, and in
deed it soon became ours.
The almond torte was an in
teresting affair of marbled
chocolate and amaretto cake,
topped by a thick, creamy
chocolate glaze. Though a bit
strong on the amaretto, the
cake is rich and typically Italian.
All desserts are $2.50 — not a
bad price fora good-sized serv
ing. The chocolate hazelnut
cake was also in the tradition of
Italian desserts: rich, sweet and
thoroughly enjoyable. As in
the case of the main courses,
one dessert reigned supreme
— the strawberry torte, which

consisted of glazed whole
strawberries and a sweet cream
over a flaky cake, instantly
pocketed three Stanford
sophomores into nirvana. The
light, thin wafer of pastry and
fresh white cream kissed the
plump glistening strawberries
into a symphony of
sweetness ... an excellent
finish to a very good meal.
In addition to the dishes de
scribed, Caffe Santa Mad
dalena offers a Continental
breakfast starting at 7 a.m.
which consists of a croissant,
coffee and fruit cup for $2.75.
Also offered are toast,
potatoes, crepes, eggs and a va

riety of fruits; espresso is $1 and
capuccino, $1.50.
A variety of sandwiches are
available for lunch, including
salami, pastrami, prosciutto
and other cheeses, in the $3 to
$4 range. The restaurant is
open all day every day except
Sundays and every item from
desserts to main dishes is avail
able for take-out, although no
deliveries are made. Friday and
Saturday nights get very busy,
Gaston told us, and even a
Monday night at 6:30 was
bringing in quite a few cus
tomers.
All in all, the Caffe Santa
Maddalena offers something

different in dining, an alter
native to the typical pizza or
Chinese food rut so many stu
dents fall into. A pleasant and
casual atmosphere and very
fast service make it a good
place to go before or after an
evening out on the town. As
Gaston said, "We try to make
everybody feel at home" - and
they do. Keep in mind that just
because you bring your food to
the table on a plastic tray does
not mean the food is cheap;
dinner for two could easily run
$25 or $30 with appetizer, main
course, dessert, wine and
espresso.

Maddalena ... along with de
licious Italian food and a hefty
bill.
