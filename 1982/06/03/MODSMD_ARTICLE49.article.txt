# 'Blue,' 'Grey': Costello fiddles while Parker burns

Almost Blue
Elvis Costello
Columbia Records
Perhaps enough time has gone by fora belated review
to take a calm and studied view of Almost Blue, known
far and wide as "Elvis Costello's country album." Is this
album really such a monstrosity — some sort of hideous
musical skeleton in the closet —or is it simply a bit of self
indulgence by a composer who should have known bet
ter?
The story behind the album is in itself very interesting.
On last year's Trust, Elvis made a definite move toward
the mass market. Now, with 'accessibility' seemingly the
watchword of his career, Elvis turns about and releases
an album divorced from his popularity that neglects his
greatest strength, songwriting.
One has to ask, "What gives?"
Actually, it isn't that hard to figure out. Elvis has long
admitted that he is a fan of country music, and has in
cluded country songs on his albums before. Perhaps it is
exactly because he is so close to commercial success that
he feels he can put out his country album. In the past he
has shown little desire to help market his own product,
and now that he can get away with a tribute to his musical
roots it is hardly surprising that he disregards market
ability.
As if to further distance himself, the album itself starts
off with what is basically a fake. Hank William's standby,
"Why Don't You Love Me Like You Used to Do," is here
treated as a rave-up. Double-tracked vocally with ring
ing, distorted guitars, the song gives lie to the album; the
listener wonders if this is going to be a rock send-up
album.
It doesn't take long before that impression is lost. The
very next song, "Sweet Dreams," is a lush, full Nashville
product. Elvis croons through the song, a sad lament of
lost love. Here is the problem the album presents for
Elvis: how seriously will his listeners take him?
As another of rock's angry young men, Elvis made his
mark with wit and sarcastic irony, and now he is in dif
ferent waters- the heartfelt sadness of country music.
Here, his creditability isn't merely questioned, it's as
sailed.
In a later song, "Too Far Gone," Elvis again runs up
against this barrier. These songs are simply too hokey to
stand on their own. It takes a tremendous singer to carry
the song, to persuade the listener not to question the
song but instead to be swept away by the atmosphere.
At the low points of the album, most notably the two
songs mentioned, Elvis fails to do this. He hits all the right
accents, but we are simply too aware that it is Costello
singing country. Perhaps the crossover is simply im
possible.
On the other hand, Elvis does do well with the other
face of country. On the barrelhouse rocking song "To
night the Bottle Let Me Down" Elvis delivers a lively,
jumping song well augmented by some neat piano
flourishes. Likewise, "Brown to Blue" comes off well as a
basically silly song. The song, a divorce song, is almost a
parody of country music, and Elvis sings it accordingly.
However, the smirk that would kill the other songs is
not present here. He is not mocking the song or the
genre, but including the listener in the joke the song is
telling.

It would be wrong to give the idea that this album is a
complete loss as far as sincerity goes. Although Elvis' per
sonality comes through too strongly for him to get away
with the straight country songs, on the songs where is he
not aping the country style works very well.
On "A Good Year for the Roses" he delivers on char
acterization. Here he sings of a broken marriage, and, al
though the song is almost humourously maudlin, the im
age is believeable and touching. Through the song, one
can picture Elvis sitting on the porch of his little Gl Bill
house, looking at the empty carport, feeling worthless
and alone and not able to think about anything but how
much the grass needs to be cut.
For an album where he did not write a single song, it
often comes surprisingly close to his styles and moods.
The resemblance is closest on the two Gram Parsons
songs. Elvis, from his earliest days, said that his musical
idol was no one in the range from Presley to Johnny Rot
ten, but rather this unreknown composer. "I'm Your Toy
(Hot Burrito No.1)," showing Elvis plangently devoting
himself to a girl who mistreats him, is not very excep
tional, but the song that closes the album, "How Much I
Lied," is tremendous.
A very fine arrangement of the song — in notes he says
it went in almost one take— is supported by a beautiful,
delicate piano line over which Elvis sadly confesses his
misdeeds. "To take a chance on losing you/ is such a silly
thing to do/ The chance I might wake up to find you
gone/ Blue, so blue/ My life is burning blue/ Any
brighter flame would be a lie/ Blue, so blue/My love still
burns for you/ But I know I'll only make you cry."
The song is rare for Elvis — rarely does he put himself of
the position of the heartbreaker — but he sings it very ef
fectively and here there can be no doubt of sincerity. The
song is so musically pretty that it calls out for the listener
just to go grab people to make them listen to it.
Overall, the album fails as 'country.' Where Elvis draws
himself into the boundaries of that genre he traps
himself, and does not come off very well. However, the
songs we can accept at face value, such as his arrange
ment of "How Much I Lied," often succeed tremen
dously.
As a musical eclectic, Elvis falls somewhat short. As a
pop/rock composer and stylist, however, he is far ahead
of many of his peeers. The next test will be where he goes
with his next album — and that's due out any day.

acterization. Here he sings of a broken marriage, and, al
though the song is almost humourously maudlin, the im
age is believeable and touching. Through the song, one
can picture Elvis sitting on the porch of his little Gl Bill
house, looking at the empty carport, feeling worthless
and alone and not able to think about anything but how
much the grass needs to be cut.
For an album where he did not write a single song, it
often comes surprisingly close to his styles and moods.
The resemblance is closest on the two Gram Parsons
songs. Elvis, from his earliest days, said that his musical
idol was no one in the range from Presley to Johnny Rot
ten, but rather this unreknown composer. "I'm Your Toy
(Hot Burrito No.1)," showing Elvis plangently devoting
himself to a girl who mistreats him, is not very excep
tional, but the song that closes the album, "How Much I
Lied," is tremendous.
A very fine arrangement of the song — in notes he says
it went in almost one take— is supported by a beautiful,
delicate piano line over which Elvis sadly confesses his
misdeeds. "To take a chance on losing you/ is such a silly
thing to do/ The chance I might wake up to find you
gone/ Blue, so blue/ My life is burning blue/ Any
brighter flame would be a lie/ Blue, so blue/My love still
burns for you/ But I know I'll only make you cry."
The song is rare for Elvis — rarely does he put himself of
the position of the heartbreaker — but he sings it very ef
fectively and here there can be no doubt of sincerity. The
song is so musically pretty that it calls out for the listener
just to go grab people to make them listen to it.
Overall, the album fails as 'country.' Where Elvis draws
himself into the boundaries of that genre he traps
himself, and does not come off very well. However, the
songs we can accept at face value, such as his arrange
ment of "How Much I Lied," often succeed tremen
dously.
As a musical eclectic, Elvis falls somewhat short. As a
pop/rock composer and stylist, however, he is far ahead
of many of his peeers. The next test will be where he goes
with his next album — and that's due out any day.

Almost Blue
Elvis Costello
Columbia Records
Perhaps enough time has gone by fora belated review
to take a calm and studied view of Almost Blue, known
far and wide as "Elvis Costello's country album." Is this
album really such a monstrosity — some sort of hideous
musical skeleton in the closet —or is it simply a bit of self
indulgence by a composer who should have known bet
ter?
The story behind the album is in itself very interesting.
On last year's Trust, Elvis made a definite move toward
the mass market. Now, with 'accessibility' seemingly the
watchword of his career, Elvis turns about and releases
an album divorced from his popularity that neglects his
greatest strength, songwriting.
One has to ask, "What gives?"
Actually, it isn't that hard to figure out. Elvis has long
admitted that he is a fan of country music, and has in
cluded country songs on his albums before. Perhaps it is
exactly because he is so close to commercial success that
he feels he can put out his country album. In the past he
has shown little desire to help market his own product,
and now that he can get away with a tribute to his musical
roots it is hardly surprising that he disregards market
ability.
As if to further distance himself, the album itself starts
off with what is basically a fake. Hank William's standby,
"Why Don't You Love Me Like You Used to Do," is here
treated as a rave-up. Double-tracked vocally with ring
ing, distorted guitars, the song gives lie to the album; the
listener wonders if this is going to be a rock send-up
album.
It doesn't take long before that impression is lost. The
very next song, "Sweet Dreams," is a lush, full Nashville
product. Elvis croons through the song, a sad lament of
lost love. Here is the problem the album presents for
Elvis: how seriously will his listeners take him?
As another of rock's angry young men, Elvis made his
mark with wit and sarcastic irony, and now he is in dif
ferent waters- the heartfelt sadness of country music.
Here, his creditability isn't merely questioned, it's as
sailed.
In a later song, "Too Far Gone," Elvis again runs up
against this barrier. These songs are simply too hokey to
stand on their own. It takes a tremendous singer to carry
the song, to persuade the listener not to question the
song but instead to be swept away by the atmosphere.
At the low points of the album, most notably the two
songs mentioned, Elvis fails to do this. He hits all the right
accents, but we are simply too aware that it is Costello
singing country. Perhaps the crossover is simply im
possible.
On the other hand, Elvis does do well with the other
face of country. On the barrelhouse rocking song "To
night the Bottle Let Me Down" Elvis delivers a lively,
jumping song well augmented by some neat piano
flourishes. Likewise, "Brown to Blue" comes off well as a
basically silly song. The song, a divorce song, is almost a
parody of country music, and Elvis sings it accordingly.
However, the smirk that would kill the other songs is
not present here. He is not mocking the song or the
genre, but including the listener in the joke the song is
telling.

It would be wrong to give the idea that this album is a
complete loss as far as sincerity goes. Although Elvis' per
sonality comes through too strongly for him to get away
with the straight country songs, on the songs where is he
not aping the country style works very well.
On "A Good Year for the Roses" he delivers on char
acterization. Here he sings of a broken marriage, and, al
though the song is almost humourously maudlin, the im
age is believeable and touching. Through the song, one
can picture Elvis sitting on the porch of his little Gl Bill
house, looking at the empty carport, feeling worthless
and alone and not able to think about anything but how
much the grass needs to be cut.
