# ...but not among 'stuffers'

### Heather Millar Senior staff writer 
Although co-op houses have re
cently failed to attract enough pros
pective residents for next year, co-op
members have secretly stuffed their
halls, roofs and rooms with un
authorized residents this year and in
past years.
Allowing unregistered or un
authorized students to live in Univer
sity housing facilities directly violates
University policy and principle, ac
cording to Row Manager Diana Con
klin. Because they are able to act only
on specific cases — short of iniating
police raids — Conklin said the Uni
versity had chosen to apply pressure
on individual resident assistants
(RAs) rather than resorting to a seri
ous crack down.
While students have cited uncon
firmed infractions in dorms, frats,
and University-operated row houses,
this pressure has been applied pre
dominantly on the co-ops, where the
violations have been the most nu
merous.
The Daily has found that students
classify illegal residents by their vary
ing backgrounds: "Stuffers," usual
ly students who are unguaranteed
and cannot get housing on campus,

are by far the most prevalent type of
illegal resident. Stuffers are so named
because they are "stuffed" into an
other student's room, usually sleep
ing on a mattress on the floor. They
pay full room and board to the
house, rather than to the University.
"Roofers," sleep on the roof, store
their stuff in a "roofers' room," and
pay nominal rent and full board to
the house. Roofers usually gravitate
to Synergy where more than 10 of
them now enjoy the co-op's open at
mosphere and gabled roof. The roof
ing option usually attracts drifters or
students that have stopped-out fora
quarter. "Ghosts," are almost im
possible to track down since they are
unassigned students who take the
place and, when dealing with Res Ed,
the name of an assigned student who
has moved out of the co-op. One
former co-op resident said Colum
bae is a common haunt for ghosts.
"Crashers" drop in on co-ops and
stay for several days, although some
stay for as long as a month. Students
often have to throw these drifters
out.
Co-op members acknowledge the
illegality of allowing these various
types of unauthorized people to use
campus housing; but they insist that

roofers, stuffers and ghosts add
needed initiative to the cooperative
community.
"Stuffers are beneficial to co-ops
because they're high-energy, high
commitment people," said one co
op member.
"One of the most important things
stuffers do is that they add people
that wouldn't be living here other
wise," said a graduate petroleum en
gineering student stuffing in Colum
bae. "It adds diversity and depth."
Other co-op members say there
are more than enough students to fill
the co-ops — which have recently
had trouble attracting residents —
but many cannot get in through the
housing draw. Freshman Matt Grant
drew 4789 and even though he is
guaranteed housing next year, he has
not been assigned to his first-choice
Columbae which has five unfilled
places for men.
Conklin refuted this claim, "I find
it impossible to believe that a regis
tered Stanford student that wants to
get into a co-op wouldn't get in at
some point, if not in the first or sec
ond round, then after waitlisting."
Still, supporters of roofers and stuf
fers contend these practices offer a
needed alternative to people
thwarted by the housing draw.
"I had to stuff or I wouldn't have
continued at Stanford. I didn't know
anybody," said senior Karen Halbo
who transfered here as a junior, was
not assigned to University housing,
and stuffed in Columbae.
"This is what catches the people
that fall between the cracks of the
housing system. Stanford housing
has some problems, and people get
screwed over. I don't know what
some people would do if it wasn't for
these practices," she said.

"They're not hurting anybody,"
said one co-op resident.
"Whether or not they're hurting
anybody is questionable," Conklin
said. "When co-ops take on extra res
idents, they take on a responsibility
for the University that the University
doesn't want, but that it gets any
way."
Because of bad experiences with
questionable drifters that latch on tc
the co-op and refuse to leave,
Synergy RA Cynthia Vitt-Jarvis said
the house is trying to crack down on
unwanted guests. ;
"The house is definitely shifting
gears between being naively gener
ous and being more realistic," she
said.
