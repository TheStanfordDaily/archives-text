### Chris Butchko 
Another Grey Area
Graham Parker
Arista Records
It would not be strictly correct to say Graham Parker is
sitting on top of the world.
After yet another critically acclaimed commercial fail
ure his band of almost a decade, one of the most tightly
knit units in rock, decides to split up. This split was dif
ferent from most, however, as the band split into only
two pieces: a lead singer and everyone else.
After the Rumour joined forces with reggae singer
Garland Jeffries Parker found himself with some glowing
— but rapidly dating — press clippings, five very good
albums, and what Another Grey Area shows to be one
very big case of bitterness.
Having become that pariah of pop music, a critic's darl
ing, Parker could very well feel justified in feeling rather
teed off that his albums have sank without a trace in the
marketplace, and thesongtitleson hisnewalbum reflect
this. From "Big Fat Zero" to "Thankless Task" to "It's All
Worth Nothing Alone" the impression is given that this
might be the first concept album whose theme is a cer
tain unprintable seven-letter phrase.
Actually, all the song titles for this album are a little for
midable, including such melodramatic stunners as"Fear
Not," "Crying For Attention," and "No More Excuses."
Looking over the album jacket one is a little surprised to
note that the record contains music, and not dramatic
readings from Conan Doyle.
Past the trappings, there is music worth considering in
side. The album leads off with the single, "Temporary
Beauty," a song written to both those who apply cos
metics and those who chase after the temporary beauties
thus created. The song takes off before the chorus, lifted
with an almost militaristic push and supported by nice
lingering harmonies.
Despite the nice touches on the song, however, the
fault of the whole album shinesthrough. After recording
with the Rumourforso long, Parkeriseitherdetermined
to produce an album with a no-stars ensemble or else he
has forgotten how to write for any other band. The
album sounds very much like what it is; music recorded
by a group of session musicians.
On this song, like others, the instrumental seem
hollow. Parker constructs riffs with care, but it seems that
once he hands them over to the guitarist he accepts them
as complete. It would be hard to blame him for being
lazy from the habit of handing half a riff to Martin Bel
mont to embellish, but now that he's on his own it falls
on him to polish his own work. Doug Stegmeyer is a very
slick bassist, but it's ridiculous to expect a refugee from
Billy Joel's band to produce great rock.
Likewise, the blame also lies on producer Jack
Douglas. These songs have some nice effects, perhaps
some very swift production tricks, but they still some
times sound as if one track in the recording is missing.
Graham Parker has not been well-produced since Jack
Nietzsche handled the controls for Squeezing Out
Sparks or Nick Lowe did Stick to Me. Douglas is simply
too lax on this album.
Like his other albums, Parker's strength is in his lyrics,
the saving grace of this album, considering that the mu
sic is so low-drawer. Parker huS a unique technique to
writing songs; it seems as if he finds a grabber phrase and
then tacks a song on after it.

On the title track, Parker races into the song w h
"You're always kidding me!" and then tears off into a
tirade against the pull of the mundane. For "Can't Wai !e
a Minute" he opens with a little capsule of his career: 'I
was playing with words/ No one could understand a
thing/They'd never get the ticket/ but waste my time < in
the absurd static that just seemed to cling." Here, Park
tells how "I woke up in the middle of the night/ and 11
alized I hadn't slept, I'd just been dreaming."
On "No More Excuses" he looks for comfort in t ie
cruel world: "Every street is a crowded place/ Eve y
crowd is too much to face/ Every shoulder is somethi' ig
hard/ Don't want to lean on."
Some songs frankly lack inspiration. "Crying for Atte >
tion" is kind of an insipid song and not inspired mu: i
cally. "You Hit the Spot" is anonymously funky, ar d
"Dark Side of the Bright Lights," despite some pretty ha
monies, doesn't offer much new.
Paradoxically, Parker is able to bring life into even th<-
oldest formula song, the straight-up rocker. "Big F
Zero," as in 'worthless,' is pretty basic musically and ly
ically depends on a very simple hook- words that sour
good when sung fast. Over a thrumming bass beat Parkt
howls a wake-up call: "Fumble with the money, fumb
with the keys/ Somebody hastoend upon his knees/ G <
to a funeral dressed in pink/ Start to look, now, start \
think!" Here, it sounds best to say nothing importai '
well.
"It's all Worth Nothing Alone" is musically bland bi
has an interesting plea to "give me a breakdown on wh. t
I am/ And try to fill up all the empty space in me/ Giv
me a shakedown and tie my hands/ And make me b
what I could never be." Another bland song is "Thank
less Task," which is musically almost a steal from "Terr
porary Beauty" but is saved by a lazy guitar figure and
nice sax solo. Here, too, Parker sings appealingly, trip
pingly through the lyric.
The album closes with "Fear Not," a rathe
melodramatic song reminiscent of Stick to Me. Her«
Parker is a protector, making a rather gruesome vow tha
"I won't let them touch you/ Not a hair that's on you
head/ They can rip out bits of me/ That should kee|
them fed."
In a way, it's that kind of dedication that Parker fea
tures in his work. Perhaps he has to be that way to keep
trying to get heard in the music world. It's too bad that
the production and musicianshiponthisalbum will keep
him from riding Another Grey Area into the black.

On this song, like others, the instrumental seem
hollow. Parker constructs riffs with care, but it seems that
once he hands them over to the guitarist he accepts them
as complete. It would be hard to blame him for being
lazy from the habit of handing half a riff to Martin Bel
mont to embellish, but now that he's on his own it falls
on him to polish his own work. Doug Stegmeyer is a very
slick bassist, but it's ridiculous to expect a refugee from
Billy Joel's band to produce great rock.
Likewise, the blame also lies on producer Jack
Douglas. These songs have some nice effects, perhaps
some very swift production tricks, but they still some
times sound as if one track in the recording is missing.
Graham Parker has not been well-produced since Jack
Nietzsche handled the controls for Squeezing Out
Sparks or Nick Lowe did Stick to Me. Douglas is simply
too lax on this album.
Like his other albums, Parker's strength is in his lyrics,
the saving grace of this album, considering that the mu
sic is so low-drawer. Parker huS a unique technique to
writing songs; it seems as if he finds a grabber phrase and
then tacks a song on after it.

On the title track, Parker races into the song w h
"You're always kidding me!" and then tears off into a
tirade against the pull of the mundane. For "Can't Wai !e
a Minute" he opens with a little capsule of his career: 'I
was playing with words/ No one could understand a
thing/They'd never get the ticket/ but waste my time < in
the absurd static that just seemed to cling." Here, Park
tells how "I woke up in the middle of the night/ and 11
alized I hadn't slept, I'd just been dreaming."
On "No More Excuses" he looks for comfort in t ie
cruel world: "Every street is a crowded place/ Eve y
crowd is too much to face/ Every shoulder is somethi' ig
hard/ Don't want to lean on."
Some songs frankly lack inspiration. "Crying for Atte >
tion" is kind of an insipid song and not inspired mu: i
cally. "You Hit the Spot" is anonymously funky, ar d
"Dark Side of the Bright Lights," despite some pretty ha
monies, doesn't offer much new.
Paradoxically, Parker is able to bring life into even th<-
oldest formula song, the straight-up rocker. "Big F
Zero," as in 'worthless,' is pretty basic musically and ly
ically depends on a very simple hook- words that sour
good when sung fast. Over a thrumming bass beat Parkt
howls a wake-up call: "Fumble with the money, fumb
with the keys/ Somebody hastoend upon his knees/ G <
to a funeral dressed in pink/ Start to look, now, start \
think!" Here, it sounds best to say nothing importai '
well.
"It's all Worth Nothing Alone" is musically bland bi
has an interesting plea to "give me a breakdown on wh. t
I am/ And try to fill up all the empty space in me/ Giv
me a shakedown and tie my hands/ And make me b
what I could never be." Another bland song is "Thank
less Task," which is musically almost a steal from "Terr
porary Beauty" but is saved by a lazy guitar figure and
nice sax solo. Here, too, Parker sings appealingly, trip
pingly through the lyric.
The album closes with "Fear Not," a rathe
melodramatic song reminiscent of Stick to Me. Her«
Parker is a protector, making a rather gruesome vow tha
"I won't let them touch you/ Not a hair that's on you
head/ They can rip out bits of me/ That should kee|
them fed."
In a way, it's that kind of dedication that Parker fea
tures in his work. Perhaps he has to be that way to keep
trying to get heard in the music world. It's too bad that
the production and musicianshiponthisalbum will keep
him from riding Another Grey Area into the black.

Another Grey Area
Graham Parker
Arista Records
It would not be strictly correct to say Graham Parker is
sitting on top of the world.
After yet another critically acclaimed commercial fail
ure his band of almost a decade, one of the most tightly
knit units in rock, decides to split up. This split was dif
ferent from most, however, as the band split into only
two pieces: a lead singer and everyone else.
After the Rumour joined forces with reggae singer
Garland Jeffries Parker found himself with some glowing
— but rapidly dating — press clippings, five very good
albums, and what Another Grey Area shows to be one
very big case of bitterness.
Having become that pariah of pop music, a critic's darl
ing, Parker could very well feel justified in feeling rather
teed off that his albums have sank without a trace in the
marketplace, and thesongtitleson hisnewalbum reflect
this. From "Big Fat Zero" to "Thankless Task" to "It's All
Worth Nothing Alone" the impression is given that this
might be the first concept album whose theme is a cer
tain unprintable seven-letter phrase.
Actually, all the song titles for this album are a little for
midable, including such melodramatic stunners as"Fear
Not," "Crying For Attention," and "No More Excuses."
Looking over the album jacket one is a little surprised to
note that the record contains music, and not dramatic
readings from Conan Doyle.
Past the trappings, there is music worth considering in
side. The album leads off with the single, "Temporary
Beauty," a song written to both those who apply cos
metics and those who chase after the temporary beauties
thus created. The song takes off before the chorus, lifted
with an almost militaristic push and supported by nice
lingering harmonies.
Despite the nice touches on the song, however, the
fault of the whole album shinesthrough. After recording
with the Rumourforso long, Parkeriseitherdetermined
to produce an album with a no-stars ensemble or else he
has forgotten how to write for any other band. The
album sounds very much like what it is; music recorded
by a group of session musicians.
