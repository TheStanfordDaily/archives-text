# DISCOVERING STANFORD
## A 						look backward: from Farm to University 
### 
When David Starr Jordan
arrived at Stanford in the
summer of 1891 to become
the University's first presi
dent, he found the coun
tryside enthralling. "The
Santa Clara Valley/' he
wrote in his autobiography,
"extends southward 50
miles and more from near
the head of San Francisco
Bay. Bounding it on the
southwest rises. . .the
Sierra de la Santa Cruz - 'a
misty camp of mountains
pitched tumultously'... .
"immediately behind the Univer
sity estate and forming its higher
background is the wooded Sierra

Morena, its cloak of redwood, oak
and madrono diversified by thickets
of chemisal....
"On the east, opposing the green
ridges of the Holy Cross, stretches
the long, relatively barren and tree
less Sierra del Monte Diablo."
In this sheltered area 30 miles
south of San Francisco, its favorable
climate assured by its situation be
tween bay and ocean, its meadows
patterned with ancient oaks, Senator
and Mrs. Leland Stanford estab
lished their university on the site of
their suburban home, Palo Alto.
The first parcel, bought in 1876,
consisted of 650 acres along San
Francisquito Creek, and subsequent
purchases ran the total to 8250 acres.
The whole of the Stanfords' land
was given to the University in the
1885 Grant of Endowment with the
stipulation that it should never be

sold.
To this land, Senator Stanford
brought Francis Walker, president of
the Massachusetts Institute of Tech
nology, and the prominent land
scape architect Frederick Law
Olmsted in the summer of 1886.
Grainfield site
They gave serious thought to lo
cating the campus in the foothills of
the ranch, so as to take advantage of
the magnificent view of the Bay, but
they finally decided to drive in a
stake in the grainfields below, at a
point that marks one corner of the
Inner Quadrangle. The senator felt
the flat site was more practical for
later expansion.
Olmsted worked out the general
concept for the grounds and the
buildings, but it remained for the
young Boston architect, Charles Al
lerton Coolidge, to develop this
concept in the style of his late men
tor, Henry Hobbs Richardson, con
sidered the most eminent architect
of his time.
The style is called Richardsonian
Romanesque, and it follows the Eu
ropean Romanesque, which is char
acterized by rectilinear stone build
ings joined by covered arcades
formed of successive half-circle
arches supported by short columns
with decorated capitals.
The inner quad of 12 classroom
buildings — with the central place
reserved for the future Memorial
Church — and three engineering
buildings, Encina Hall for men and
Roble Hall for women were ready
for the University's opening on Oc
tober 1,1981.
"These long corridors with their
stately pillars," Drrjordan said at the

dedication, "will have their part in
the students' training. Each stone in
the quadrangle shall teach its lesson
of grace and genuineness."
President Andrew White of Cor
nell pronounced the Stanford build
ings the most beautiful college
architecture in America.
The ground shook
But just before five on the morn
ing of April 18,1906, the ground be
neath Stanford's new buildings
shook for 45 seconds. The great
earthquake killed two men on cam
pus and caused millions of dollars of
damage.


The ponderous church tower,
with its clocks, chimes, and spire,
crashed into the chancel of Memori
al Church, and the concussion blew
out the front wail. The rose window
and the huge Venetian mosaic of
Christ welcoming the righteous into
the kingdom of God (based on Mat
thew 25:34 in the Bible) that had
graced the facade lay as rubble in the
Inner Quad.
Memorial Arch, the central struc

ture of the Outer Quad — 100 feet
high and decorated with a frieze de
picting the march of civilization —
was damaged beyond repair. So
were a library and gymnasium that
were just short of completion. None
of these was replaced.
Reconstruction cost more than $2
million. Classes were dismissed until
the fall. Seniors in what has come to
be known as "The Earthquake Class"
were voted their degrees in May.
It was a setback, but only a tem

porary one, for the young university
quickly rebuilt, pursuing a construc
tion project that was begun in 1886
and that has been intermittently
continued up to the present. The
construction has taken place on ap
proximately 5000 acres reserved by
the Board of Trustees for educa
tional uses. This is the heartland of
the Stanford land, comprised for the
most part of the central portion run
ning from El Camino Real to the back
boundary in the foothills.

The areas designated for light use
lie in open land, including the
arboretum, golf course and the foot
hill lands used for space-probing an
tennae and research in nuclear phys
ics and biological sciences.
The Inner and Outer Quads oc
cupy 17 acres at the heart of the aca
demic area. The Inner Quad's 12
classroom buildings, two of which
are now used by the president and
his staff, date from the time the Uni-
versity opened in 1891,
while the Outer Quad was
completed in 1903, the same
year Memorial Church was
dedicated.
Buildings in the Outer
Quad are being brought up
to earthquake-proof stan
dards by an "inside-out"
process of construction to
preserve the sandstone ex
terior.

The church represents
the Stanfords' deep re
ligious faith, though they
were followers of no partic
ular denomination. In the
Founding Grant, they
directed the trustees "to
have taught in the Univer
sity the immortality of the
soul, the existence of an all
wise and benevolent
Creator, and that obedience
to His laws is the highest
duty of man."
To serve the widest needs
of the campus community,
they decreed that the
church and the University
were to be nonsectarian and
at no time tied to any partic
ular denomination.

In the original plans, the
central site now occupied
by the church was reserved
for it, though construction
was deferred. When Sena
tor Stanford died in 1893, his
widow determined that the
church would be built as a
memorial to him.
Mrs. Stanford chose the
final designs for windows
and mosaics, traveling to Ita
ly to approve the mosaic

sketches, and obtaining
papal permission to copy
the Roselli fresco of the
"Last Supper" in the Sistine
Chapel.
The Venetian mosaics
which cover the interior

walls are largely Old Testa
ment, depicting the history
of redemption. The largest
mosaic, however, occupies
most of the facade of the
church and, with 47 figures,
depicts the welcoming of
the righteous into heaven as
described in the New Testa
ment text of Matthew 25:34.
It is frequently mistaken for
the Sermon on the Mount.
After the earthquake of
1906, the structure was com
pletely dismantled and re
built around a steel
framework. Another set of
mosaics was brought from
Venice, but the 80-foot
spire, housing clocks and
chimes, was never rebuilt.
The campus landmark,
285-foot Hoover Tower, was
dedicated at the University's
50th anniversary in 1941.
The tower and the adjoining
Lou Henry Hoover Building
(opened in 1967) house the
vast documentary collec
tions of the Hoover Institu
tion on War, Revolution and
Peace — millions of items
that include books, docu
ments, files, manuscripts,
diaries, pamphlets, posters,
maps and photos. The
Herbert Hoover Memorial
Building, completed in
1978, honors the former
president's humanitarian
works.
Herbert Hoover started
the library collection during
World War I when he
headed the Commission on
Relief in Belgium. Struck
with the thought that his re
lief work might put him in a
position to document the
war, Hoover shipped crates

of material to the library at
Stanford, his alma mater,
and laid the literary founda
tion of the Hoover Institu
tion.
At the 1941 ceremony,
Hoover said: "The purpose
of this institution is to pro
mote peace. Its records
stand as a challenge to those
who would promote war.
They should attract those
who search for peace."
The Institution has more
material on communism
than can be found any
where outside Russia. It has
more data on Benito
Mussolini than can be
found in Italy. It also has
probably the most complete
record on Adolf Hitler and
the Nazi movement extant.
Stone age crumbles
As the 70s ended, the
University drew to a close its
so-called "Second Great
Stone Age," a building
boom launched in the early
'60s in which the University
has attempted to meet the
needs engendered by its big
post-war expansion in stu
dents and faculty.
Now, however, as the
University stabilizes its pop

ulation, it plans fewer major
building projects for the
next 10 years.
But construction projects
such as the new music cen
ter and dormitory do de
pend largely on the benefi
cience of University donors
(including the federal gov
ernment), and in this infla
tionary age, the University
may have difficulty raising
the necessary funds.
But if Stanford does at
tract the required support, it
will continue to build right
through the 100 th an
niversary of that day in 1886
when Senator Stanford de
cided to locate his new uni
versity on the site of his
horse farm.
The Senator felt that any
land good enough for
breeding horses ought to be
good enough for teaching
students.
