# DISCOVERING STANFORD
## A
						look backward: from Farm to University 
### 
When David Starr Jordan
arrived at Stanford in the
summer of 1891 to become
the University's first presi
dent, he found the coun
tryside enthralling. "The
Santa Clara Valley/' he
wrote in his autobiography,
"extends southward 50
miles and more from near
the head of San Francisco
Bay. Bounding it on the
southwest rises. . .the
Sierra de la Santa Cruz - 'a
misty camp of mountains
pitched tumultously'... .
"immediately behind the Univer
sity estate and forming its higher
background is the wooded Sierra

Morena, its cloak of redwood, oak
and madrono diversified by thickets
of chemisal....
"On the east, opposing the green
ridges of the Holy Cross, stretches
the long, relatively barren and tree
less Sierra del Monte Diablo."
In this sheltered area 30 miles
south of San Francisco, its favorable
climate assured by its situation be
tween bay and ocean, its meadows
patterned with ancient oaks, Senator
and Mrs. Leland Stanford estab
lished their university on the site of
their suburban home, Palo Alto.
The first parcel, bought in 1876,
consisted of 650 acres along San
Francisquito Creek, and subsequent
purchases ran the total to 8250 acres.
The whole of the Stanfords' land
was given to the University in the
1885 Grant of Endowment with the
stipulation that it should never be

sold.
To this land, Senator Stanford
brought Francis Walker, president of
the Massachusetts Institute of Tech
nology, and the prominent land
scape architect Frederick Law
Olmsted in the summer of 1886.
Grainfield site
They gave serious thought to lo
cating the campus in the foothills of
the ranch, so as to take advantage of
the magnificent view of the Bay, but
they finally decided to drive in a
stake in the grainfields below, at a
point that marks one corner of the
Inner Quadrangle. The senator felt
the flat site was more practical for
later expansion.
Olmsted worked out the general
concept for the grounds and the
buildings, but it remained for the
young Boston architect, Charles Al
lerton Coolidge, to develop this
concept in the style of his late men
tor, Henry Hobbs Richardson, con
sidered the most eminent architect
of his time.
The style is called Richardsonian
Romanesque, and it follows the Eu
ropean Romanesque, which is char
acterized by rectilinear stone build
ings joined by covered arcades
formed of successive half-circle
arches supported by short columns
with decorated capitals.
The inner quad of 12 classroom
buildings — with the central place
reserved for the future Memorial
Church — and three engineering
buildings, Encina Hall for men and
Roble Hall for women were ready
for the University's opening on Oc
tober 1,1981.
"These long corridors with their
stately pillars," Drrjordan said at the

dedication, "will have their part in
the students' training. Each stone in
the quadrangle shall teach its lesson
of grace and genuineness."
President Andrew White of Cor
nell pronounced the Stanford build
ings the most beautiful college
architecture in America.
The ground shook
But just before five on the morn
ing of April 18,1906, the ground be
neath Stanford's new buildings
shook for 45 seconds. The great
earthquake killed two men on cam
pus and caused millions of dollars of
damage.
