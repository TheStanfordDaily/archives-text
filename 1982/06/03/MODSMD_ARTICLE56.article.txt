•Though both San Fran
cisco and San Jose can be
seen from the top of Hoover
Tower, the vista from the
ridge near the"The Dish"is
equally brethtaking and
makes a sunrise or sunset
picnic in the foothills a
must. "Cowtipping" —
pushing over cows that are
sleep standing up — is said
to be another favored foot
hill pastime, though many
say cowtipping stories tall
tales of the "grouse hunt"
genre.
•Should conference
meetings, tours, or classes
become too stressful, sun
bathing on the top of Term
an Engineering Building
provides a relaxing study
break. The stairs lead right
to the roof, and some
students have even set up
desks there.

tain-hopping" — dipping in
fountains such as the The
Claw in White Plaza or the
Hoop in front of Green Li
