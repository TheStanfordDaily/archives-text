# 'The City' creates an Eastern energy...

"I'm going to San
Francisco/' visitors
to this area often say,
yet since the mood
of San Francisco and
its environs have be
come intertwined
the meaning is usual
ly "I'm going to the
Bay Area."
San Francisco
Of course, "The City" —
unquestionably the most
eastern of Californian, and
probably of west coast.

cities — is the place to start.
San Francisco blends a fran
tic urban tempo set by the
pinstripe-suited busi
nessmen that zip back forth
between buildings on
Montgomery Street in the
heart of the financial district
with landmarks such as Chi
natown, Victorian houses,
Fisherman's Wharf, and Coit
Tower, that inspired Albert
Finney to remark in the
movie Shoot the Moon
"This town could die of
quaint."
No trip to San Francisco
would be complete without
visits to these temples of

tourism that have incited
some local newspaper col
umnists to charge that San
Francisco is opting for an
amusement park over a
healthy urban community.
Yet once the novelty of the
tourist shops and wax
museums and casual street
vendors (institutionalized
by city licensing laws) has
waned, the visitor would do
well to seek out the back al
lies of the standard tourist
districts.
All most visitors usually
see of Chinatown is Grant
Avenue, the crowded hon
ky-tonk strip. While some
genuinely good Chinese
restaurants and stores face
this thoroughfare, the real
Chinatown lies in the back
allies radiating from of
Grant Avenue where lives
the largest Chinese popu
lation outside of Asia.
There, the independent
tourist will encounter small
but excellent restaurants
and markets, even an herbal
pharmacy or two. Grand
mothers sit on front stoops,
sewing and keeping an eye

on children who play kick
ball in the allies and explode
caps with spoons. House
wives bargain for the
freshest spring beans and
bok choy and husbands
trade community gossip and
play checkers in the park
across from the Chinatown
Holiday Inn.
Though it seems hard to
believe now, what with the
tourist traps and flashing
neon, Fisherman's Wharf
once existed to support the
City's fishing industry. That
old flavor can be recaptured
by buying a loaf of Parisian
sourdough French bread
and a fresh crab, and walk
ing the piers of the small
marina behind Alioto's Res
taurant. Toward Ghirardelli
Square, a stroll out the pier
of Aquatic Park at sunset af
fords a breathtaking view of
the bay and graphically ex
plains the choice of the
name: Golden Gate. Old
men fish off the pier, and
members of the "Dolphin"
Athletic Club swim in the
freezing bay water.
While the Financial dis

trict may not normally make
the top of the "places not to
miss"- list, the area boasts'
some of the best restaurants?
in San Francisco. Both
Tadich's and Sam's grills'
perpetuate the old, Boston
like San Francisco of rude
linen-approned and bow
tied waiters, superlative
food, long lines, and "Old
Boys' Club" tete-a-tetes
The Carnelian Room at the
top of the Bank of America
building prepares excellent
meals with a view of the Bay
and, in summer, of the fog
drifting by.
Marin County
The Golden Gate Bridge!
links San Francisco with|
Marin, portrayed in the
book and movie The Serial
as the home of "mellowed-ji
out" Northern California™
who eat alfalfa sprouts and
tofu, drink Perrier water,i
drive Mercedes sedans and)
have orgies in their
redwood hot-tubs. To the
extent that these stere
otypes are accurate, Marin
is also one of the most beau
tiful areas in California
graced with mellowness,
good restaurants and
redwood forests.
At the turn of the century,
when Marin was truly in the
country, residents dubbed
what is now called Sausalito
"Hurricane Gulch." The
reason for the name choice
will become clear should
the tourist visit Sausalito on
one of the numerous foggy
summer days. On a clear day
in Sausalito, however, you
can see forever from
Bridgeway, the main-drag.
In the The Serial, Mill Val
ley and places like the Mill
Valley Book Depot are cen
ter-stage. On Miller Avenue
I in downtown Mill Valley,
the Book Depot offers a
reading selection from The
Wall Street Journal to £x
■ istential Yoga, herbal teas,
§ carrot cake, and endless
$ people-watching op -
i portunities. Down the
| street, a pop-art museum
| with a ceiling hung with ted
;• dy bears features a Volks
? wagen sedan filled to the
t roof with old dolls and a
§ carousel horse built out of
i junk.
Both Muir Woods, a
preserve, and
# beautiful Stinson Beach may
be reached by going
through Mill Valley.
Berkeley
Home of Stanford's arch
rival, UC-Berkeley and the
scene of violent student
protests against the Vietnam
; War, Berkeley-the-town is a
I much more of a college
| town than Palo Alto and is a
| great place to spend a Satur
day. But since the mood of
112 the Cal campus is stere

otypically more zany than
that in Berkeley, the same
goes for the town and vice
versa. Although University
and Shattuck Avenues are
also major arteries, most ac
tivity related to the univer
sity branches off Telegraph
Avenue. Students crowd the
shops, bars, and restaurants
which lined the avenue.
Street vendors set up shop

along Telegraph each week
end, and the Hare Krishnas
regularly stage chanting
processions there.
The Coast
During the summer, fog
pulled in by the heat of the
Sacramento Valley "socks
in" most of the coast. But
even with the gray-blue
foggy days on the California
coast, whether it be Mon

terey, Pebble Beach, Half-
Moon Bay, or Santa Cruz, a
day near the shore provides
an escape from the hustle
and bustle of the metropoli
tan Bay Area.
In the weeks before Hal
loween, excited jack-o-lan
tern-hunting kids and their
parents swarm the Half
Moon Bay pumpkin fields
just half an hour from the

Stanford campus. Summer is
a quieter time for eating in
the many seafood restau
rants and exploring the
rocky beaches around Half
Moon Bay.
If you're looking for an
exciting day on the Coast,
tortuous roller-coasters, a
carnival, and assorted rides
on the Santa Cruz Beach
Boardwalk front the beach.
