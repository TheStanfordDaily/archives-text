# Tenure denial still invoking opposition
## Freedman rally draws 300 
### Douglas Jehl 
Nearly 300 people joined Tuesday
in a noontime rally supporting efforts
to gain tenure for Asst. History Prof.
Estelle Freedman. The protest cul
minated in the presentation of peti
tions bearing about 324 signatures to
William Chace, associate dean of hu
manities and sciences (H & S).
Freedman, who has won awards
for teaching excellence, was denied
tenure by the deans of humanities
and sciences in an early March de
cision that has since been hotly pro
tested.
In mid-May, the History Depart
ment submitted new material in sup
port of Freedman to the deans. The
material has since been passed on to
the Committee on Appointments
and Promotions (CAP) which makes
tenure recommendations to the
deans. CAP, which has not met in
more than a month, is expected to
make a recommendation at its next
meeting which will take place next
week, according to Religious Studies
Prof. Van Harvey, a member of the
committee.
Harvey, Chace and others con
tacted by the Daily refused to dis
close the exact date of the meeting,
but Chace said, "I do think there's
every likelihood that we (the deans)
will make a decision before com
mencement."
About 150 students marched Tues
day from the White Plaza rally to the
H & S offices in the Quad. They
chanted "Freedman deserves

tenure," and "Stanford needs
Estelle," while waiting for Chace to
return from lunch. When he arrived
at 1:30, about 80 people who re
mained read the contents of the peti
tion in unison and and then present
ed a stack of signed petitions to
Chace.
Lisa Rofel, a graduate student in
anthropology who helped organize
the rally, said there were 324 signa
tures on the petitions.
In an interview later Tuesday,
Chace said the petitions would be
viewed as "one piece of evidence...
and there are lots of pieces of evi
dence" in the decision to grant
tenure.
"A lot of this case rests on scholarly
achievement," Chace said. "I'm not
convinced that the petitioners un
derstand this."
Reached at her home in San Fran
cisco and informed of the turnout at
the rally, Freedman said the support
was "quite inspiring." "I would wel
come it (a decision from the deans
regarding tenure) as soon as pos
sible," she said.
Freedman would not comment on
whether she would appeal the
tenure decision to Provost Albert
Hastorf if the deans again refuse to
grant it to her. "I'm hoping that it
won't be necessary (to appeal the de
cision)," she said.
However, Freedman said, "It
seems to me that I would have very
strong grounds for appeal."
Earlier, at the rally, Assoc. History

Prof. Clay Carson assailed the Uni
versityfor allowing bureaucracy to
get in the way of education and em
phasized that his support of Freed
man did not come only because of
personal support. "Estelle will proba
bly go on to bigger and better things
than Stanford University," he said.
"When we look at this case, we
find an example of the kind of proc
esses in this University that just tram
ple people," Carson said.
English Prof. Anne Mellor, who
chairs the Feminist Studies Program,
said, "Without Estelle, there simply
would not be a Feminist Studies Pro
gram at Stanford ... I don't know
whether the program can survive
without her."
Freedman, English Prof. Diane
Middlebrook, Political Science Prof.
Nan Keohane (now president of
Wellesley College) and the late An
thropology Prof. Michelle Rosaldo
were the original founders of the
feminist studies program here. If
Freedman is denied tenure and is
forced to leave the University, only
Middlebrook would remain.
Stephanie Poggi, a graduating sen
ior in feminist studies, read a
statement supporting Freedman and
attacking the University for its inabili
ty to recognize scholars and teachers
of intellectual integrity. "It is obvious
that the denial of tenure was a politi
cal move," Poggi said. She promised
continued support of Freedman:
"Our voices are loud and we will be
heard," she said.
