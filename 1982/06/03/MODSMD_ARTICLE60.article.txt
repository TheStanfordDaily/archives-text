in addition to the various
courts, gyms, fields, pools
and weight rooms dotting
the Stanford campus, sports
camps and a few collegiate
athletic events will highlight
the summer sports scene.

Heading the list of sport
ing competitions will be the
National Water Polo Cham
pionships held at Deguerre
Pool August 14-16. The
country's top men's and
women's club teams includ
ing U.S. Olympians will par

ticipate in the three-day
tournament.
Dante Dettamanti, Stan
ford water polo coach,
called this national tourney
and the NCAAs "the two
biggest championships of
the season." Teams consist

of undergraduate as well as
graduate players in college,
making the competition
much fiercer.
On September 19, the
tennis team will host
"Courtside with the Stars
II,"a exhibition featuring

former Stanford tennis j
greats, including John
McEnroe. Because of the ?
popularity of the event last I
September, Maples Pavilion i
will house the exhibition!
this year.
The campus' athletic facil-1
ities will also house 13 recre- ;
ational camps, including
both day and night camps, i
The summer's line-up
ranges from the Stanford ;
Football Camp to the Stan
ford Community Children's
Recreation Camp to the
Stanford Pole Vault Camp.
Tennis, basketball, soccer, \
golf, volleyball, and track
and field programs are also
scheduled during the sum
mer months.
The only Stanford team
with a full summer schedule
is the Cricket club, which
will play on the North In

Though many students
leave Stanford during the
summer, nearly all the ath
letic facilities continue to
operate. The campus' recre
ational facilities will hold to
a schedule similar to that of
the academic year from
June 21 to August 14 (see
