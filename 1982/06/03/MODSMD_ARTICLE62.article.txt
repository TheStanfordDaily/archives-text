Production nights at the
Daily — Monday and Thurs
day — are typically filled
with deadline pressure and
a lot of hard work. By the
time we put the paper to
bed around 1:30 or 2 a.m.,
the diehards who've had to
cope with the above-men
tioned problems all night
are pretty keyed up — and
hungry.
A few miles up the road
on El Camino, Luv's offers
the kind of selection which
seems to offer something
for nearly everyone who
gets hungry from midnight
on; it's open all night, and
up to 2 a.m. you can even
get a glass of wine or a beer.
Now if those alcoholic en
ticements weren't enough
incentive to get done with
the paper early, Luv's also
features a night crew with
the late night customer tem
perament. Our favorite is
Helen, a jovial waitress who
works the graveyard shift.
For some reason, none of
us ever seem to have
enough money to pay for
our own meal on any given
night, but for the more re
sponsible among you, a
burger and beverage or an
omelette and a cup of cof
fee or a similar combination
usually brings a charge
somewhere in the $4-5
range. Some of the break
fast specials are a little
cheaper. I doubt it's one of
the cheaper places for mid
night munchies, but we like
the people. Plus,

Frai\kie, Johnnie and
Luigi's Restaurant has been
around stlTce —1906," "and
though much has already
been said in its praise, one
can never say enough good
things about this place.
As most Stanford students
know, FJ&L's is synonomous
with pizza. With topping
choices including onion,

ham, bell peppers, pep
peroni, salami, LinguicaItal
ian Sausage, mushrooms,
black olives, anchovies,
snrimp, and beef, the pizza
permutations are endless.
Quantity, of course, does
not indicate quality, but one
needn't worry about that
here.
Wheher it is the recipe or
the skillful chefs who are re
sponsible doesn't really
matter — the net result
fabulous. Even if FJ & L's
didn't serve pizza, the res
taurant could pack people
in with its fettucini ($5.75)
alone. *
Speaking of packing peo
ple in, FJ & L's doesn't take
reservations and even with
space for more than 200,
there's almost always a long
line for dinner by 6:00 p.m.
any day of the week. So
either get there early or be
prepared for a wait. On a
warm night, you may want
to ask for an outdoor table
where you can enjoy your
pizza under the stars.

Located in Town and
Country Village, the King
Chuan Restaurant offers a
small, comfortable dining
area with a delicious assort
ment of Szechuan and Man
darin dishes. The decor isn't
at all gaudy, as in some small
Chinese restaurants and its
individuality make it a very
attractive spot for that casu-
With the Exception of the

Mui Kia A is not your typ
ical mom-Aj-pop-run Chi
nese establBhment where a
fifth-grade *on takes your
order. In faA Mui Kiang is a
fairly sopftsticated, im
pressively-rA place to eat.
After 23 yeaft of building a
fine reputalon in Hong
Kong, Mui Kftpg opened its
third Mountain
View four yeaft ago. All the
cooks have \ been trans

restaurants atM definitely
excel at their tj^e.
Mui Kiang offers a varied

menu, six pages long, with
prices ranging from $3 to
upwards of $6 for one selec

of tropical drinks and every
Chinese food you could im
agine from Shark Fin Soup

They even offer to accom
modate special requests off
the-menu.
The waiters are efficient
and attentive, ready to sug
gest tempting house spe
cialties. Decor is simple as it
is in most Chinese restau
rants. Mui Kiang is a won
derful place to have dinner.
The waiters are eager to
please, the food is really
Chinese and it is definitely
one of the better Chinese
restaurants near Stanford.

Delicious, mouth-water

lightful are just a few of the
words that accurately de
scribe the Sunday cham
pagne brunch at Chez Jus
tine.
For $9.95 per adult (7.95
per child) one can suc
cessfully melt their Saturday
night fiesta into a perfect
Sunday morning continua
tion of the weekend. The
sunny atmosphere created
by the skylight and the
greenery overwhelms the
guests. It is a perfect compli
ment to the Spanish style
decor.

Alouette
401 Lytton Ave.
Palo Alto
327-4187
With only 12 tables and a
homespun assortment of
decorative plates and
knicknacks lining the walls,
Alouette offers an at
mosphere of warmth

matched only by owner
Sophie Nicholas' personal
hospitality. She greets every
guest at the door and
throughout your meal she is
never far away.
The style of the food is
Country French, lighter and
more creative than the
more formal Classical
French style. Even so, the
menu includes only five en
tree selections — probably a
reason as to how Sophie
maintains such excellent
quality control.
The total bill for two
comes to about $40, with en
trees between $12.50 and
$14.75. You may want to
save Alouette fora splurge,
but don't wait too long —
you'll be sorry you didn't
sample Sophie's creations
sooner.
Au Chambertin
170 State Street
Los Altos
948-8721
Au Chambertin, tucked in
near the corner of Main and
State streets, is a restaurant
that offers not only a bill of
fare scarcely dodged by per
fection, but a cultural ex
perience that should not be
missed.
Inside, the owners have
gone to great lengths to
provide an atmosphere that
is both elegant and very
French, but at the same time
intimate and personal. To
accomplish this, the restau
rant is divided into four
rooms, each seating about
12 or so, which creates very
handily an impression of
one's own dining room.
Dotted sparsely amongst
the rooms are bookcases,
china cabinets, and other
items of furniture. At times
it was hartj to imagine we
were actually in a restau
rant.
The house pate is

marvelous; not so the other
hors d'oeuvres, which are
rather uninspiring. At the
risk of sounding overcome,
the main courses are noth
ing short of impeccable. The
desserts may be a little rich
to some, but others seem to
appreciate them.
Au Chambertin is not
cheap (especially with its ex
tensive wine list), but fora
place of this quality, it may
in fact be quite reasonble.
Decide for yourself. The
main dishes are all around
$14-15 per person (many are
made for two), and hors
d'ouevres range from $2.50
to $7.50. Wine is $15 and up
and dessert averages about
$6 per person.
Gatehouse
265 Lytton Ave.
Palo Alto
326-1330
If you have plenty of
money and don't know
where to spend it all, a Sun
day brunch at the
Gatehouse will probably do
the trick.
The Gatehouse is ex-pen
sive. In truth, this should
probably come as no sur
prise. The Gatehouse has a
long tradition of excellence.
Its decor is elegant, it has a
beautiful outside terrace in
the sun, the service is con
siderate, and the food is
generally of high quality.
Plus, there's complimentary
champagne or orange juice.
So why all the complain
ing about a lousy $11 per
person for that food? Well,
maybe it just seems that
there are many lower
priced and lesser-known
but equally-nice brunches
in Palo Alto.
As buffets go, though, the
Gatehouse has a pretty
spectacular one. It consists
of three very burdened
tables, one for salads, one
for themain dishes and one
for dessert. All told, the
Gatehouse is a fine place to
stuff yourself in style. On a
student's budget, however,
it's just not quite worth the
price.
