# Reviewing cinema houses, not the cinema
## 
### Jim Mattson 
There are enough movie theatres
within biking distance of campus to
enable you to see a different movie
every night of the week, week after
week. Our movie-going experience
is invariably affected by the condi
tions in which we view the movie:
how big is the screen? is the sound
system worth listening to? do the
people who work at the concession
stand have body odor? What follows
then is a review not of movies but of
the theatres that show them.
The ASSU Sunday Flicks which are
scheduled — surprise! — every Sun
day night in Memorial Auditorium
feature new or nearly new releases.

sound system and a fairly large
■ screen. One disadvantage to the
Flicks is that they sometines show,
without giving advance warning, 16
millimeter prints of widescreen films
— giving the movie a crop job that, at
best, is ugly. The Flicks concessions
stand offers the basic pop
| corn/candy/diet 7-Up stuff, so bring
your quarters.
Palo Alto has two repertory movie
houses which show good movies
from a range of eras, styles, and lan
guages. The New Varsity Theatre, on
University Avenue, might have been
what God was thinking about when
he invented movies. It has a huge
screen, a fine sound system, and
conscientious projectionists who
almost always manage to keep most
of the image in focus. The con
cessions stand boasts popcorn and

ice cream, and the New Varsity's
espresso bar can get you wired ail
night. Movies generally screen for
one or two evenings before being
replaced by another double bill.
The Festival Cinema, one block
over from the Varsity on Hamilton
Avenue, is, at first glance, a little os
tentatious. It is a tiny theatre with a
small screen. But every week the Fes
tival put together a double bill that
features the best older movies you
could hope to find. The concession
stand can supply popcorn, bagels,
and apple juice, and has the
cheapest prices around for your
standard non-nutritive foodstuffs.
The Aquarius Twin Theatres, on
Emerson, program first-run Holly-

wood and foriegn films. Both thea
ters are shaped like shoeboxes, the
shoebox on the left being a little
larger than the shoebox on the right
The theaters have a problem with
sound leaking through the wall they
share — it often happens that the
mood music from the Aquarius 1
mingles promiscuously with the
mood music from the Aquarius 2.
The specialty of the house is carrot
cake, and Tuesday night is a discount
night for students.
There are three first-run movie
houses in Menlo Park, about 20
minutes away by bike. The Park and
the Guild are both on El Camino
Real. The Park with its curved roof, is
like a reconditioned aircraft hanger,
which makes it a great place to see
high-tech cinema. The nice folks at
the Park have plced an illuminated

clock at the left of the auditorium,
which is great for people who sched
ule dental appiontments in the
middle of movies and not so great
for everyone else.
The Guild is much smaller than the
Park, but of late has tended to be
nicer (fora long time it was per
meated by a faintly urinous odor, but
I'm happy to report that the problem
has now been arrested). The man
ager of the Guild is very good about
scheduling a double bill when the at
traction of the main show begins to
wane, so it's often possible to catch
recent movies that you've missed
elsewhere as the lower half of a
Guild double bill.
The Menlo Cinema, on Santa Cruz
Avenue, often shows "big" releases.
When you go into the auditorium,
you will be impressed by the
enormous expanse of shimmering
gold curtain that stretches across the
front. When the movie starts, this
curtain pulls back to reveal a screen
that's about 12 feet wide and four
feet high. The Menlo manages to
chop even really big movies down to
size. The projectionist at the Menlo

has on occasion, been rather care
less about focusing — maybe it's not
in his contract.
Moving south down El Camino,
one eventually encounters Moun
tain View, the home of the Old Mill 6
multi-cinema entertainment fun
complex. The seats in each of the six
multi-cinema are covered in orange
plastic; they're as unpleasant to sit in
as the screen is to look at. If you're
tempted to put your feet upon the
seat in front of you, the Old Mill's
helpful staff of well-scrubbed teen
agers will come and politely ask you
to leave. The Old Mill also shows
some very good movies — but it
might be worth it to find a friend
with a car so you can see them at
more humane places elsewhere.
The San Francisco Chronicle pub
lishes a weekly datebook (known af
fectionately as "The Pink Section")
which gives rundowns on movies
playing around the Bay Area. The
Daily publishes the "CinemaScope"
movie listing every Friday which
gives highly opinionated reviews of
movies playing in the area.

within biking distance of campus to
enable you to see a different movie
every night of the week, week after
week. Our movie-going experience
is invariably affected by the condi
tions in which we view the movie:
how big is the screen? is the sound
system worth listening to? do the
people who work at the concession
stand have body odor? What follows
then is a review not of movies but of
the theatres that show them.
The ASSU Sunday Flicks which are
scheduled — surprise! — every Sun
day night in Memorial Auditorium
feature new or nearly new releases.
Memorial Auditorium has a good

sound system and a fairly large
■ screen. One disadvantage to the
Flicks is that they sometines show,
without giving advance warning, 16
millimeter prints of widescreen films
— giving the movie a crop job that, at
best, is ugly. The Flicks concessions
stand offers the basic pop
| corn/candy/diet 7-Up stuff, so bring
your quarters.
Palo Alto has two repertory movie
houses which show good movies
from a range of eras, styles, and lan
guages. The New Varsity Theatre, on
University Avenue, might have been
what God was thinking about when
he invented movies. It has a huge
screen, a fine sound system, and
conscientious projectionists who
almost always manage to keep most
of the image in focus. The con
cessions stand boasts popcorn and

ice cream, and the New Varsity's
espresso bar can get you wired ail
night. Movies generally screen for
one or two evenings before being
replaced by another double bill.
The Festival Cinema, one block
over from the Varsity on Hamilton
Avenue, is, at first glance, a little os
tentatious. It is a tiny theatre with a
small screen. But every week the Fes
tival put together a double bill that
features the best older movies you
could hope to find. The concession
stand can supply popcorn, bagels,
and apple juice, and has the
cheapest prices around for your
standard non-nutritive foodstuffs.
The Aquarius Twin Theatres, on
Emerson, program first-run Holly-

wood and foriegn films. Both thea
ters are shaped like shoeboxes, the
shoebox on the left being a little
larger than the shoebox on the right
The theaters have a problem with
sound leaking through the wall they
share — it often happens that the
mood music from the Aquarius 1
mingles promiscuously with the
mood music from the Aquarius 2.
The specialty of the house is carrot
cake, and Tuesday night is a discount
night for students.
There are three first-run movie
houses in Menlo Park, about 20
minutes away by bike. The Park and
the Guild are both on El Camino
Real. The Park with its curved roof, is
like a reconditioned aircraft hanger,
which makes it a great place to see
high-tech cinema. The nice folks at
the Park have plced an illuminated

clock at the left of the auditorium,
which is great for people who sched
ule dental appiontments in the
middle of movies and not so great
for everyone else.
The Guild is much smaller than the
Park, but of late has tended to be
nicer (fora long time it was per
meated by a faintly urinous odor, but
I'm happy to report that the problem
has now been arrested). The man
ager of the Guild is very good about
scheduling a double bill when the at
traction of the main show begins to
wane, so it's often possible to catch
recent movies that you've missed
elsewhere as the lower half of a
Guild double bill.
The Menlo Cinema, on Santa Cruz
Avenue, often shows "big" releases.
When you go into the auditorium,
you will be impressed by the
enormous expanse of shimmering
gold curtain that stretches across the
front. When the movie starts, this
curtain pulls back to reveal a screen
that's about 12 feet wide and four
feet high. The Menlo manages to
chop even really big movies down to
size. The projectionist at the Menlo

has on occasion, been rather care
less about focusing — maybe it's not
in his contract.
Moving south down El Camino,
one eventually encounters Moun
tain View, the home of the Old Mill 6
multi-cinema entertainment fun
complex. The seats in each of the six
multi-cinema are covered in orange
plastic; they're as unpleasant to sit in
as the screen is to look at. If you're
tempted to put your feet upon the
seat in front of you, the Old Mill's
helpful staff of well-scrubbed teen
agers will come and politely ask you
to leave. The Old Mill also shows
some very good movies — but it
might be worth it to find a friend
with a car so you can see them at
more humane places elsewhere.
The San Francisco Chronicle pub
lishes a weekly datebook (known af
fectionately as "The Pink Section")
which gives rundowns on movies
playing around the Bay Area. The
Daily publishes the "CinemaScope"
movie listing every Friday which
gives highly opinionated reviews of
movies playing in the area.
