# Campus crime scales the ivory tower
## 
### 
Stanford is more than the
tmory tower that most univer
sities are. It is an ivory — sand
stone — tower surrounded by
thousands of acres of rolling
Mils and open space which
create a rural atmosphere that
Cimoflages the University's lo
cation in a metropolitan area
vulnerable to crime.
|I Four rapes and several at
tempts were reported on "The
Farm" during the last academic
year, according to the Stanford
Police Department,
if "Everything appears so calm,
open, and tranquil. It is, but we
do have incidents of crime,"
said Police Chief Marvin Her

rington.
Summer poses unique safety
problems to Stanford residents
and visitors. "In summer the
population is down," said Her
rington. "There are areas of
campus that are usually heavily
populated most of the day —
White Plaza, the Quad, Palo
Alto — that become deserted
after seven in the evening dur
ing the summer."
Bike thefts, 300-000 of which
are reported to the University
Police each year, occur more
frequently during the summer,
the Chief said. He also said bike
accidents increase since many
visitors who have not ridden

for years try to navigate bi
cycles around crowded cam
pus thoroughfares.
In addition to observing
common sense safety precau
tions, Herrington suggested
visitors take extra steps which
suit the University environ
ment:
•If in a life endangering situ
ation, run to the nearest pay
phone and dial 911. University
pay phones do not require a
dime to dial 911. Should a
phone not be close, pull one of
the fire alarms that dot the
campus. All fire boxes are iden
tifiable by a red light.
•Treat the residence halls as

hotels. Do not hesitate to alert
the police if someone sus
picious is loitering around the
dorm. The public areas are
public. The security of yourself
and your belongings is at the
door of your room, which
should be locked.

•Register your bike if it's not
registered elsewhere. Observe
road rules, and ride with a light
at night.
•Try to jog with a partner. A
student was raped last year
while jogging alone near the
Stanford Stadium.
