# University accomodates many special programs
## 
### 
When the student popu
lation recedes each sum
mer, the University steps up
interaction with outside
groups and communities.
Many dorms change from
student residences to
pseudo-hotels catering to
summer visitors. Symposia,
special education programs,
and conferences flourish.
"The role of the con
ferences is to utilize the fa
cilities of the University that
would otherwise be emp
ty," said Lois Fariello, man
ager of the Conference Of
fice which oversees the pro
grams. "It enhances the aca
demic visibility of the Uni
versity."
Over 120 special pro
grams — with aims as varied
as engineering economy for
public utilities, learning
spirit leading, exploring
fluidized bed technology,
and educating the children
of migrant workers — will
be hosted by the University.
The entertainment fea
ture of the programs will be
two Jazz Workshops spon
sored by T residder Memori
al Union and organized by
Stanford graduate Jimmy
Nadel. The workshop will
include instruction by
prominent jazz musician
Stan Getz. Concerts will also
be given as a part of the
workshops which are
scheduled for the first two
weeks of August.
The University also spon

sors several special educa
tion programs such as Up
ward Bound which supple
ments the preparation of
college-bound teenagers
from ghetto high schools
which cannot supply ade
quate course offerings. A
education effort for chil

dren of migrant workers
base it operation at Stanford
this summer.
Many group annually
schedule meetings during
the summer quarter. Each
year, the Graduate School
of Business sponsors an ex
ecutive program which

draws executives from all
over the world to partici
pate in a continuing educa
tion curriculum on financial
management.
Stanford profits from this
shift of gears necessitated by
the influx of visitors such as
business executives. The

Conference Office has
scheduled campus stays for
over 12,000 conferees,
bringing a gross income of
$2.7 million to the Univer
sity. This income is rein
vested into the housing sys
tem, to help keep down
housing cost to students.
