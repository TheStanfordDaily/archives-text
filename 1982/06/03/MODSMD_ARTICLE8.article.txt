## San Francisco debates strict parking laws 
### Los Angeles Times 
San Francisco — During the day,
there are more than 500,000 motor ve
hicles crowded into this bustling city.
But there are only 68,000 regulated
curbside parking spaces, or about one
space for every seven cars.
Not surprisingly, many residents,
commuters and visitors elected to park
illegally, risking tickets. They reasoned
that even if they got caught, the result
ing fine of $5 or $10 was cheap enough
compared to what they would pay at a
downtown parking facility.
But that has been changing since the
adoption in 1980 of sharply higher park
ing fines — along with what one City
Hall aide delicately calls "more active
and consistent" parking law enforce

ment.
As a result, the city expects to collect
$25 million in traffic fines this year, near
ly double what it compiled in 1979, and
city officials are being besieged with
protests from outraged motorists.
The Police Department is busy defen
ding itself, pointing out that the 7200
traffic citations being issued each day
are down slightly from last year. Besides
that, officers note, traffic bureau sur
veys indicate that police still catch only
about a third of all parking violations.
"We don't tag legally parked cars; we
tag illegally parked cars," Sgt. Edward
Eimil explained last week.
"Everybody wants to park at home
plate — that's the American way — but
everybody can't do that," Eimil said.

"Everybody who parks illegally has
what they think is a justifiable reason,
like they had to go to the bank or some
thing. Well, we can't say it's justifiable,
so we write the ticket. And they cry and
moan."
The Board of Supervisors, perhaps
more sensitive to such cries and moans
when they come from voters, is re
considering the 1980 ordinance that
was aimed at cracking down on parking
violators and raising badly needed city
revenue.
Fines for parking-meter and street
cleaning violations went from $5 to $10,
and tickets for double-parking and
parking in tow-away, loading and other
restricted zones went from $10 to $40.
The supervisors have begun examin

ing several new proposals, the most in
novative of which would establish three
parking ticket rates based on the size
and value of the errant motorist's car.
"A fancy new Cadillac, for example,
would pay the highest rates; an old VW
would pay the least," Supervisor Carol
Ruth Silver, the measure's sponsor, told
the board. "Wealthy people toss off
tickets as a cost of living and the poor
are subjected to hardship. The need for
reform is immediate."
Mayor Dianne Feinstein has ordered
a study of the parking problem, particu
larly reports of inconsistent enforce
ment. "The mayor has been receiving
quite a lot of complaints from people
who say enforcement hasn't been fair
or consistent," a spokesman said.
