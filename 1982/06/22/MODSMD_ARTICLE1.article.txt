# Justice O'Connor speaks at commencement
## 
### Julie Kaufmann 
U.S. Supreme Court Justice
Sandra Day O'Connor, saying
that "other societies have not
had the same need of lawyers for
courts that we have," urged
graduates to "help us resolve
more of the disputes which arise
in this country someplace other
than the courtroom," June 13 at
University commencement cer
emonies.
An all-time high number of
degrees, about 1800 bachelors
and 2800 advanced, were con
ferred at the outdoor exercises.
"There is a wide-spread and
justified view in this country that
quantitatively the courts are car
rying too large a burden, the size
of which can't adequately be re
solved merely by increasing the
number of judges, and that qual
itatively the courts are being
asked to solve problems for
which they are not institutionally
or traditionally equipped,"
O'Connor said.
"Court delays are so severe in
some jurisdictions that an ag
grieved party might just as well
have no remedv at all. The costs
of litigation have often become
so high as to deprive many of our
citizens of true access to the
courts and to cause litigation to
become known as the newest
form of 'the sport of kings.'
"In some instances, the delay
has been avoided and the costs
of proceedings have been
diminished by legislation such as
mandatory arbitration of certain

claims and simplified, largelyun
administered, probate pro
grams," she said.
O'Connor provoked laughter
and applause from the record
breaking crowd of 15,000 when
she said: "A commencement
speech is a particularly difficult
assignment. You are given no
topic and are expected to be
able to inspire all the graduates
with a stirring speech about
nothing at all. I suppose that's
why so many lawyers are asked
to be commencement speakers;
they're in a habit of talking ex
tensively even when they have
nothing to say."
The former University trustee,
who received both under
graduate and law degrees from
the University, thanked the class
of 1982 for inviting her to speak.
"There are some offers that even
supreme court justices can't re
fuse and yours was one of
them," she said.
O'Connor's presence caused
the local media to take special
note of this year's commence
ment exercises. Representatives
from about 11 newspapers and
television stations covered the
ceremony, a significant increase
over past years, according to
Stanford Observer Editor Harry
Press.
This year's commencement
was more political than com
mencements in recent years.
Graduates carried about 2000
white balloons reading "knowl
edge for life" in support of the

United Nations disarmament
session, and several hundred
multi-colored balloons reading
"support women's scholarship
tenure Freedman." The tenure
case of Asst. History Prof. Estelle
Freedman is currently on appeal.
University President Donald
Kennedy assured his daughter
Julia, a graduating senior, and
"other friends of the class of
1982," that there is life after Stan
ford "and that it is good — better
in fact, than life before Stanford
was, and better still than life
without Stanford would have
been."
Kennedy promised that the
University would "continue a re
lentless pursuit of ... diversity
through admissions and finan
cial aid policy, no matter how
many others seem willing to
abandon it." Stanford continues
to admit students regardless of
their financial needs, although
many other schools, faced with
dwindling funds, have given up
the practice.
The president urged gradu
ates to be skeptical of "certified
truths." "Remember one of the
great Stanford lessons," he said,
"the textbook may be wrong,
even if the professor teaching
the course did write it."
Kennedy received prolonged
cheers when he described Stan
ford as "the place in which
laughter, whimsey, and flat out
whackiness are alive and we 11...
if the belief is too serious to joke
about, it's probably wrong," he

added.
The commencement ceremo
ny also included an awards cere
mony where outstanding stu
dents, faculty and staff were
honored. The Walter J. Gores
faculty achievement awards for
excellence in teaching were giv
en to Roy Maffly, M.D., pro
fessor of medicine; Edward
Spofford, adjunct professor of
classics; and John (Jack) Prostko,
teaching fellow in English.
The Lloyd W. Dinkelspiel
awards for outstanding service
to undergraduate education
were presented to Biology Prof.
Donald Abbott; Kathleen
Namphy, lecturer in English and
Western culture; and graduating
seniors Leo Cunningham and

Leah Halper. Halper accepted
her award wearing a white rib
bon sash bearing the message
"Tenure Freedman."
The University bestowed its
newest annual award — The
Kenneth M. Cuthbertson award
for exceptional service to the
university — on Raymond Bac
chetti, vice-provost for man
agement and director of univer
sity budgets.
Mariann Byerwalter, a mem
ber of the ASSU Council of Presi
dents, received the J.E. Wallace
Sterling award at the Class Day
Luncheon June 12. The award is
presented annually by the Alum
ni Association to a senior who
has demonstrated strong poten
tial for service to the University
