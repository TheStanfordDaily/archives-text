# Rollerskating dynamic duo shows four-wheel drive
## 
### Karen Springen 
Rollerskating is more than a
fad to Golden Gate pairs cham
pions Diane Haden and Dave
Wolter. The two have been skat
ing together for three years â€”
and plan to continue for at least
another 25.
They look as if they learned to
skate before taking their first
step. But Haden said, "When I
first started I couldn't even stand
up."
Haden and Wolters have a
style which is more classical and
artistic than that of most skaters
at Golden Gate Park. "We do
more lifts," said Wolters. "They
do more outdoor, disco-type
skating."

According to classical skater
Lupe Thomas, Haden and
Wolter have taught themselves
many moves of competition
skating.
The two execute classical lifts
and jumps which are uncom
mon outdoors. "We do a lot of
overhead lifts," said Haden.
Both their individual and joint
routines feature "coffins," in
which they lean sideways with
their heads grazing the pave
ment. But Wolters cited the
need to avoid having a "favor
ite" trick. "If you start to have a
favorite move, you start to do it
all the time," he said.
The duo generally performs to
dance music. At the Golden

Gate competition, the two
skated to Paul McCartney and
Stevie Wonder's, "Ebony and
Ivory."
Wolter does not find age a lim
iting factor. "I'll be able to skate
pairs until I'm about 50." Older
skaters can continue to develop
technique, he said.
Wolters said that he prefers
outdoor competitions, such as
that at Golden Gate Park, to in
door skating. This is fortunate:
because Haden and Wolters
have made money from skating,
they are ineligible for national
competitions.
Wolters described the
amateur, indoor competitions as

less fun than the more casual
outdoor ones. "It's just a tense
situation instead of a fun com
petition," he said. "Competition
in itself doesn't turn me on."
The partners cited the
camaraderie involved in roll
erskating. "It's not like people
are dog eat dog," said Haden.
Skaters teach each other tricks.
Haden cited the importance of
being shown a trick by someone.
She compared figuring out a ma
neuver single-handedly to
"trying to discover penicillin."
Wolters described his dream
of producing a rollershow simi
lar to the ice capades. But he also

emphasized rollerskating's ap
peal beyond a spectator sport.
"Anyone can learn and learn fast
if they just practice," he said.
"You just have to believe that
you can do it. Obviously you're
not going to get right up and be
an expert at skating."
Calling skating "a lifelong en
deavor," Wolter said he plans to
improve "all the time." He said,
"We want to make skating pretty
much our lives."
The two offer a rollercize class
at Skate Arena. The class offers
aerobic exercise through roll
erskating, Tuesday and Thursday
from 7 p.m. to 8 p.m. Call
