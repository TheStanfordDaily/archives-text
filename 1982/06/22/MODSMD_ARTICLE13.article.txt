# Skating: A reason to 'park' yourself at Golden Gate
## 
### Karen Springen 
People who choose to put on
16 pounds? Rollerskaters do!
The reasons why were evident
Sunday afternoon, June 6, dur
ing the Second Annual Golden
Gate Outdoor Rollerskating
Championship sponsored by the
Parks Department.
About 500 people, half of
them with cameras (rollerskating
"lens" itself to pictures!), at
tended the competition. Be
cause motor vehicles are pro
hibited from the park every Sun
day afternoon, skaters and spec
tators are always abundant but
there were many more there for
the competition. According to
David Miles, founder and presi
dent of the Northern California
Rollerskating Association and
coordinator of the Golden Gate
Skate Patrol, about 6000 fre
quent the park each Sunday. He
added that 20,000 went to the
park about two years ago.
Sunday's freestyle competi
tion consisted of three catego
ries: pairs, men's singles, and
women's singles. The women's
competition featured five en
trants, the men's 13, and the
pairs four.
Indoor vs. outdoor
Freestyle rollerskating com
petition is traditionally held in
doors. Like ice skating, it in
cludes figures, dance, and free
style. Skaters compete individ
ually and in pairs. Indoor com
petitions involve classical skat
ing.

Outdoor skating is less struc
tured than indoor skating. Ac
cording to indoor rollerskater
Lupe Thomas, the Golden Gate
competition "seemed all free
expression."
Outdoor skating is physically
more demanding than indoor
skating. "The concrete really
slows you down. It requires a lot
more effort," said Thomas. As a
result, outdoor skate wheels are
softer than indoor wheels to ab
sorb bumps.
Skater Dave Wolters said, "In
doors you have more of a struc
tured environment. You know
the floor is flat. Outdoors any
thing can happen because it's
not a perfect surface."
Because of its more classical
orientation, indoor skating
somewhat resembles ice skating.
This brings up a question:
besides the fact that iceskating is
included in the Olympics and
rollerskating is not, what dist
inguishes one from the other?
According to Thomas, the
weight of the skates is what
makes the difference. In addi
tion, rollerskating is physically
harder than ice skating, as roll
erskates have a much broader
base than iceskates.

According to Wolters, skating
can be either expensive or inex
pensive. Indoor skates run from
$20 to $200 for the boot only. On
the other hand, skates can be
rented near Golden Gate Park
for about $5. Skating indoors
generally runs about $3, skate
rental included, for a two-hour
session. Rinks often feature dis
count specials such as family
night, color night, and ladies'
night.

Being a good skater brings
more benefits than th° star status
one can achieve every Sunday at
Golden Gate Park. Skaters are
generally in excellent physical
condition. Thomas stressed,
"You really develop your leg
muscles." This underscores the
fact that skating is hard work. "It
gets you in shape really fast,"
said Thomas.
She cited the need for pa
tience on the part of new skaters.

"You can't just go and be good
the first time. You've got to ex
pect to fall." She added, "A lot of
people do get discouraged."
According to skater Diane
Haden, winner of the women's
freestyle competition, former
dance experience is a plus.
According to David Miles,
founder and president of the
Northern California Roll
erskating Assocation and coor
dinator of the Golden Gate SJ<ate
Patrol, the Skate Patrol began in
July 151979."
The present Golden Gate
Skate Patrol, consisting of about
20 volunteer skaters, is trained in
First Aid and CPR. They patrol
four basic areas.-
The park has had a troubled
past. According to Miles, the
commission wanted to change
the vehicle code in May of 1981
to ban skating. The skaters lob
bied against the change by skat
ing from San Francisco to Sacra
mento.
The rollerskaters organized a
protesting petition with 3500 sig
natures and skated to Sacra
mento in 10 hours. Miles said his
group changed the wording so
the different communities could
regulate — but not ban — skat
ing.

Patrol, the Skate Patrol began in
July 151979."
The present Golden Gate
Skate Patrol, consisting of about
20 volunteer skaters, is trained in
First Aid and CPR. They patrol
four basic areas.-
The park has had a troubled
past. According to Miles, the
commission wanted to change
the vehicle code in May of 1981
to ban skating. The skaters lob
bied against the change by skat
ing from San Francisco to Sacra
mento.
The rollerskaters organized a
protesting petition with 3500 sig
natures and skated to Sacra
mento in 10 hours. Miles said his
group changed the wording so
the different communities could
regulate — but not ban — skat
ing.
