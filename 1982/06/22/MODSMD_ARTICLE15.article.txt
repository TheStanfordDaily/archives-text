## The 						Jean-Luc Ponty Experience in Berkeley 
### Mark Zeigler lean-Luc Ponty The Greek Theatre/Berkeley 30 May 1982 
They call it the "Jean-Luc Ponty Experience."
It starts when the emcee takes the microphone, the
lights go out, and he says, "Ladies and Gentlemen,
Would You Please Welcome Jean-Luc Ponty and his
Band." Five men walk on stage and perch themselves
behind their various instruments. One man, wearing a
white visor and carrying a blue violin approaches the
lone mouth-level microphone and says, "Goooo De
eveneen."
The latest showing, or hearing for that matter, of Mr.
Ponty et al. was at UC-Berkeley's Greek theater as part
of their 16th annual jazz festival. And as usual, JLP did
not send the audience home unsatisfied.
But as I drove from the concert, I began to think
about the onstage magic known as the "Jean-Luc Ponty
Experience" â€” what makes a Ponty show so special?
Was it the eerieness of his music? Or maybe it was the
simultaneously serious/relaxed atmosphere JLP
created with this music? Or could it have been the way
he changed the studio versions of his songs for his con
certs? Or what about Ponty's candid, down-home
stage presence?

I chose answer e. All of the above.
This was the second year in a row that Ponty has had
the honor of closing the three-day Berkeley Jazz Festi
val, which features two days of mainstream jazz with
jazz/fusion on the final afternoon. However, 1982's
version of this setup-had both Free Flight and the Max
Roach Quartet, two straight jazz groups, playing
alongside JLP and Flora Purim and Airto with Joe Farrell
on Sunday. Free Flight was a good opening band and
Flora, Airto, and Joe did a fine job as number two per
formers. But Max Roach et al. created problems. Since
half the audience came to hear electric jazz and the
other half the mainstream variety, half enjoyed Max
and half Jean-Luc. In fact, by the time JLP had come to
his last song, the Max lovers had already beat the
homeward bound traffic. ,
Probably the most accepted band all day was Flora
and Airto with Joe Farrell. Their show was your basic
Latin percussion fest with a few Flora vocals and Farrell
sax solos tossed in here or there. In anticipation of bet
ter things to come, the crowd gave out standing O's
like they were candy to the 15-odd group members.
Perhaps the biggest cheers came during the BYOI
(Bring Your Own Instrument) percussion party that
ended their 90-minute performance. All things con
sidered, Flora etc. was a perfect choice for this type of
jazz festival, bridging the gap between electric and
acoustic enthusiasts.

One theme that ran through the entire afternoon
was the sheer brilliance of one member of each band at
playing one simple instrument or a small part of a more
complex one. Free Flight was highlighted by an ex
cellent flutist. Airto, a Latin percussionist, played a five
minute solo with just a tambourine, singing through it
while simultaneously hitting it to obtain a desired ef
fect. Max Roach brought out his high hat and played a
tribute to the world's greatest jazz drummers on it. And
finally, Ponty, with a little help from some electrical de
vices, used just his bow as part of his violin solo, called
"No Strings Attached."
Before going any further, a little background on Mr.
Ponty. The French violinist is like fine wine; he gets bet
ter with age. In the umpteen years that JLP has wined
and dined the jazz and fusion worlds, he has not
mellowed. In fact (to pursue the analogy), there isn't
even a sour grape to be found in either the man or his
music.
Year after year, album after album, Jean-Luc has cap
tivated listeners with his one-of-a-kind electric violin
sound, with a fusionist complexity equalled by few.
Once a classical and straight jazz musician, Ponty in
corporates elements of both in an electric format.
Many look upon him as the father of 1980's fusion.
A few criticize him for repeating the same thing over
and over, year after year, album after album. But when
you've got a good thing going, why stop?
Mystical Adventures, Ponty's 1982 release, is a case in
point. The violinist and company played the entire LP
in concert, demonstrating their confidence in it. Al
though side one, a five-part title track suite, can be
criticized for its similarity to other Ponty suites, side
two has perhaps JLP's best four songs yet. "Rhythms of
Hope" starts off the side on a up note, clearly display
ing the tightness and crispness that characterize a Pon
ty song. "As" is a redo of an old Stevie Wonder tune
featuring Rayford Griffin on the vocoder, a Ponty first.
The third song, "Final Truth," has one of the most de
lightfully complex bass lines and drum beats of any JLP
tune ever. And "Jig" ends Mystical Adventures c n not
quite as serious a note as the Ponty fan is accustomed
to, since the song is highlighted by Pahlino de Costa's
percussion and an almost country-Latin flavor.
And true to his high standards, none but the best
play in his band. Quite often some of the players will be
no-names; but they usually don't remain that way for
long. Take, for instance, drummer Griffin. Before the
show, he was known to the Greek Theater crowd about
as well as a member of the stage crew. After a riveting
drum solo (one of the few I've really enjoyed) and
demonstration of the ability to play Ponty's com
picated music flawlessly (it's like the entrance exam
into drummer superstardom), Rayfofd Griffin became

a household name.
Also appearing in the band was keyboardist regular
Alan Zavod, an Australian in charge of producing Pon
ty's eerie concert sound. Bassist Keith Jones from Ja
maica and American guitarist Jamie Glaser rounded
out the international band.
Furthermore, Ponty is a true band leader. At times he
directs "his Band" with his bow, while at others he will
give specific instructions to each band member until
the beat is just right for him to solo; in many respects he
is a perfectionist.
The charm with which JLP delivers a live per
formance puts the audience in a trance of mature ease.
It's truly an amazing sight to see teens who look like
AC/DC derelicts clapping politely after solos and be
tween movements in Ponty's various suites.
The key to Ponty's music is its tightness. And in con
cert, JLP is even tighter, thanks to the superb drum
ming of Griffin and the quick, complex bass lines of
Jones.
Oh, you're probably wondering when and how the
"Jean-Luc Ponty Experience" concludes. It ends when
the French violinist again approaches the lone mouth
level microphone and says, again with his noticeable
accent, "Zank for Listening to Our Music, Goood
Night!"
