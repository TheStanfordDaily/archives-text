Jury acquits Hinckley
Washington — A federal court jury decided yester
day night that John Hinckley was mentally ill when he
shot President Reagan last year and found him "not
guilty by reason of insanity."
The jury of seven women and five men, after de
liberating nearly 25 hours over four days, acquitted
Hinckley on 13 separate counts resulting from his
wounding of Reagan and three others outside the
Washington Hilton Hotel on March 30,1981.
As U.S. District Judge Ba.rington Parker read aloud
each acquittal from the jury's verdict sheet, Hinckley
twice brushed away a tear as he stood at the defense
table.
His parents, John and JoAnn Hinckley, who were sit
ting in the second row of the courtroom, wept openly
and embraced each other. Then they entered the well
of the court and embraced their son's two defense at
torneys, Vincent Fuller and Gregory Craig.
Neither the elder Hinckley, who owns a Denver oil
company, nor his wife had any immediate comment.
Fuller said only: "It's been a long trial and we're all
glad to have it over."
The 27-year-old Hinckley is expected to be com
mitted by Judge Parker to St. Elizabeth's Hospital here,
where he will be eligible for a status hearing on his cur
rent mental condition by late August.
Because he was found not guilty "by reason of in
sanity," Hinckley will remain in the ward for the crimi
nally insane at St. Elizabeth's unless and until he can
prove he is no longer a threat to himself or others. Al
though he may have additional hearings on his mental
status every six months, it is considered unlikely that
he will be freed in the foreseeable future.
Israelis break truce
Beirut — Israeli tanks, gunboats and artillery blasted
Beirut yesterday, shattering a nine-day-old truce that
had been generally ignored and raining death on a
wide arc through the capital.
It did not appear, though, that the long-awaited
final Israeli assault on the capital was under way. The
renewed shelling was believed to be part of an Israeli
attempt to pressure the beleaguered Palestine Lib

eration Organization leadership to surrender their
arms under a U.S. peace proposal.
"What can we do?" asked one guerrilla leader, as
the earth outside shook with exploding Israeli shells.
"We can sit here and receive the punch and we will do
exactly that. So they won the war. Big deal. The PLO is
not going to vanish. The Israelis are being short
sighted."
The PLO said that the casualties in the latest raids
were very heavy. There was no reason to doubt the re
port. Ambulances and fire engines wailed through the
city and hospitals reported receiving scores of casual
ties from the refugee camps at Sabra and Borj Bara
jneh.
keagan supports Israeli aims
Washington — President Reagan gave his approval
yesterday to many of Israel's war aims in Lebanon, in
cluding the withdrawal of Syrian and Palestinian
forces, the establishment of a stable government in
Beirut and a guarantee that Israel will never again be
attacked from Lebanese territory.
Declaring his support for those goals after a 2Vi hour
session with Israeli Prime Minister Menachem Begin,
Reagan in effect endorsed the approach advocated by
Secretary of State Alexander Haig and dismissed the
recent suggestion of Secretary of Defense Caspar
Weinberger that Israel's invasion was "unilateral mili
tary activity" of a kind "that we always have deplored."
"We agree that Israel must not be subjected to vio
lence from the north," Reagan said, "and the United
States will continue to work to achieve these goals and
to secure withdrawal of all foreign forces from Leba
non."
A senior administration official who later briefed re
porters made it clear that Palestine Liberation Or
ganization and Syrian military forces were specifically
included, along with Israel, in that formula.
Donovan refutes attacks
Washington — Labor Secretary Raymond Donovan
said yesterday that he has no intention of resigning
from President Reagan's Cabinet and denounced
what he called "the relentless and cowardly attacks"

From die wires ol the Associated PrcM and the Lot Angeles Times/Washington Post News Service

that have been made on him and his New Jersey con
struction company.
Breaking a six-month silence about a stream of al
legations linking him and his firm to organized-crime
figures, Donovan said he expected the investigation of
special prosecutor Leon Silverman to be completed
"in just a few days" and he seemed confident that Sil
verman's report would vindicate him.
But meanwhile, Donovan protested, he has been
victimized by a "presumption of guilt" that he said was
particularly disturbing.
"Quite obviously," he said in statement that he read
to reporters in the Labor Department auditorium,
"some of our elected officials are not content to allow
facts to be determined in an orderly manner. They
seem more interested in a wonderland school of jus
tice that stands for judgment now, trial later."
The secretary did not name the "elected officials"
he had in mind, but Senate Democrats last week pub
licly urged President Reagan to ask Donovan to "step
aside" until all the allegations against him have been
satisfactorily resolved.
Economic indicators encouraging
Washington — The U.S. economy inched its way out
of recession this quarter but high interest rates may
put a crimp in the recovery, the Commerce Depart
ment said yesterday.
In a preliminary report based on limited data, the
department estimated that the economy grew at an
annual rate of 0.6 percent in the April-june period fol
lowing two consecutive quarters of decline.
However, the encouraging news was shadowed by
an administration prediction of rising interest rates in
coming weeks and private forecasters' estimates that a
rebound may be sluggish and fragile.
At the same time, Treasury Secretary Donald Regan
said a wide-ranging review of economic policy options
has been started in the event of a feeble upturn or a
renewed business slump.
Regan said abnormally high interest rates and "ups
and downs" in the Federal Reserve Board's actions re
garding monetary policy threaten to derail the re
covery.

forces, the establishment of a stable government in
Beirut and a guarantee that Israel will never again be
attacked from Lebanese territory.
Declaring his support for those goals after a 2Vi hour
session with Israeli Prime Minister Menachem Begin,
Reagan in effect endorsed the approach advocated by
Secretary of State Alexander Haig and dismissed the
recent suggestion of Secretary of Defense Caspar
Weinberger that Israel's invasion was "unilateral mili
tary activity" of a kind "that we always have deplored."
"We agree that Israel must not be subjected to vio
lence from the north," Reagan said, "and the United
States will continue to work to achieve these goals and
to secure withdrawal of all foreign forces from Leba
non."
A senior administration official who later briefed re
porters made it clear that Palestine Liberation Or
ganization and Syrian military forces were specifically
included, along with Israel, in that formula.
Donovan refutes attacks
Washington — Labor Secretary Raymond Donovan
said yesterday that he has no intention of resigning
from President Reagan's Cabinet and denounced
what he called "the relentless and cowardly attacks"

From die wires ol the Associated PrcM and the Lot Angeles Times/Washington Post News Service

that have been made on him and his New Jersey con
struction company.
Breaking a six-month silence about a stream of al
legations linking him and his firm to organized-crime
figures, Donovan said he expected the investigation of
special prosecutor Leon Silverman to be completed
"in just a few days" and he seemed confident that Sil
verman's report would vindicate him.
But meanwhile, Donovan protested, he has been
victimized by a "presumption of guilt" that he said was
particularly disturbing.
"Quite obviously," he said in statement that he read
to reporters in the Labor Department auditorium,
"some of our elected officials are not content to allow
facts to be determined in an orderly manner. They
seem more interested in a wonderland school of jus
tice that stands for judgment now, trial later."
The secretary did not name the "elected officials"
he had in mind, but Senate Democrats last week pub
licly urged President Reagan to ask Donovan to "step
aside" until all the allegations against him have been
satisfactorily resolved.
Economic indicators encouraging
Washington — The U.S. economy inched its way out
of recession this quarter but high interest rates may
put a crimp in the recovery, the Commerce Depart
ment said yesterday.
In a preliminary report based on limited data, the
department estimated that the economy grew at an
annual rate of 0.6 percent in the April-june period fol
lowing two consecutive quarters of decline.
However, the encouraging news was shadowed by
an administration prediction of rising interest rates in
coming weeks and private forecasters' estimates that a
rebound may be sluggish and fragile.
At the same time, Treasury Secretary Donald Regan
said a wide-ranging review of economic policy options
has been started in the event of a feeble upturn or a
renewed business slump.
Regan said abnormally high interest rates and "ups
and downs" in the Federal Reserve Board's actions re
garding monetary policy threaten to derail the re
covery.
Jury acquits Hinckley
Washington — A federal court jury decided yester
day night that John Hinckley was mentally ill when he
shot President Reagan last year and found him "not
guilty by reason of insanity."
The jury of seven women and five men, after de
liberating nearly 25 hours over four days, acquitted
Hinckley on 13 separate counts resulting from his
wounding of Reagan and three others outside the
Washington Hilton Hotel on March 30,1981.
As U.S. District Judge Ba.rington Parker read aloud
each acquittal from the jury's verdict sheet, Hinckley
twice brushed away a tear as he stood at the defense
table.
His parents, John and JoAnn Hinckley, who were sit
ting in the second row of the courtroom, wept openly
and embraced each other. Then they entered the well
of the court and embraced their son's two defense at
torneys, Vincent Fuller and Gregory Craig.
Neither the elder Hinckley, who owns a Denver oil
company, nor his wife had any immediate comment.
Fuller said only: "It's been a long trial and we're all
glad to have it over."
The 27-year-old Hinckley is expected to be com
mitted by Judge Parker to St. Elizabeth's Hospital here,
where he will be eligible for a status hearing on his cur
rent mental condition by late August.
Because he was found not guilty "by reason of in
sanity," Hinckley will remain in the ward for the crimi
nally insane at St. Elizabeth's unless and until he can
prove he is no longer a threat to himself or others. Al
though he may have additional hearings on his mental
status every six months, it is considered unlikely that
he will be freed in the foreseeable future.
Israelis break truce
Beirut — Israeli tanks, gunboats and artillery blasted
Beirut yesterday, shattering a nine-day-old truce that
had been generally ignored and raining death on a
wide arc through the capital.
It did not appear, though, that the long-awaited
final Israeli assault on the capital was under way. The
renewed shelling was believed to be part of an Israeli
attempt to pressure the beleaguered Palestine Lib

eration Organization leadership to surrender their
arms under a U.S. peace proposal.
"What can we do?" asked one guerrilla leader, as
the earth outside shook with exploding Israeli shells.
"We can sit here and receive the punch and we will do
exactly that. So they won the war. Big deal. The PLO is
not going to vanish. The Israelis are being short
sighted."
The PLO said that the casualties in the latest raids
were very heavy. There was no reason to doubt the re
port. Ambulances and fire engines wailed through the
city and hospitals reported receiving scores of casual
ties from the refugee camps at Sabra and Borj Bara
jneh.
