in nuclear arms and to in
fluence world leaders who
were debating various pro

posals for arms limitations at
the United Nations Special Ses
sion on Disarmament June 12.
The rally, which may have
been the largest in U.S. history,
included people representing
all economic classes, lifestyles
and political views, who
gathered to express their com
mon concern for nuclear arms
proliferation.

Thousands of people
gathered in the morning be
tween 46th and 57th Streets
and First and Third Avenues
near the headquarters of the
United Nations to begin a
peaceful four mile march up
the major streets of Manhattan
— 42nd Street, Fifth and Sev
enth Avenues — to the center
of the rally, the great lawn in
Central Park.
"It's great to see thousands
of people in the streets of New
York protesting for what's
right," said a man from
Brooklyn who was waiting for
the start of the march.
"We flew in from Santa Cruz
County to be in the rally to

day," said a young couple,
"and we are taking our daugh
ter to the Children's rally in
Washington on June 19."
Large delegations from
Japan, Norway, Sweden and
Canada were present as well as
representatives from many
American organizations.
Placards and banners carried
diverse messages: "Business
Executives for Nuclear Dis
armament," " What to do in
case of nuclear accident, kiss
your children good-bye,"
"Take the Toys from the Boys"
(picturing President Ronald
Reagan and Soviet Presidents

"Machinists for Jobs not War,"

and "Venus de Milo did it —

dren's Walk for Life and the
giant puppets of the Vermont
based Bread and Puppet Thea
ter, left from the East-side
meeting place at 10 a.m., and
the last groups arrived at the
rally in the Central Park ap
proximately five hours later.
The rally started promptly at

thousands of silver balloons as
a symbolic renouncement of
nuclear weapons. Orson
Welles, Coretta Scott King and
Barry Commoner were among
the speakers, who represented
the broad-based support of the
United States peace move
ment.
Bella Abzug, the former
Democratic representative
from New York, referred to
Reagan's credibility gap and
added, "The gender gap didn't
make the arms race, but wom
en intend to lead in ending it."
Concerning the Equal Rights
Amendment, she said, "The
only equal right that women
have right now is the equal
right with men and children to
die in a nuclear war."
Other speakers noted the
large size of the crowd and
urged the audience to con
tinue working for peace after
the June 12 event. The rally's
organizers distributed 600,000
mailgrams, calling for bilateral
disarmament, that were to be
completed by the demonstrat
ors and sent to the president.
At 3:30 p.m. an organizer
from the June 12 Coalition
Committee announced,
"There are about 800,000 peo
ple here right now; 200,000 are
arriving. That brings the total to
one million'.'The official police
estimate of 750,000 demon

strators surpasses the numbers
of recent marches in Bonn,
Rome, London and Tokyo and
the 1969 protests against Viet
nam.
In between the speeches
there was entertainment from
Linda Ronstadt, James Taylor,
Jackson Browne and "his
friends" — Bruce Springsteen,
Gary U.S. Bonds and Joan Baez,
who prefaced her rendition of
John Lennon's "Imagine" by
saying, "We have a mountain
to move, and when I see you
here today, I believe that we
really can."
Demonstrators, organizers
and police, echoing Baez's sen
timent, concurred that the rally
was a success. A volunteer staf
fer forthe Junel2rally commit
tee said, " We couldn't have
expected any better."
"I'm most pleased with the
diversity in age, nationality,
and race of the group," said
Jackie Gelb, a national staff
member of Mobilization for
Survival, one of the groups in
the June 12 coalition. "The
turnout of the event reflects
the incredibly strong senti
ment in this country towards
disarmament."
Three young men from
Stowe, Vermont, were glad
thay pot up at 3 a.m. to drive to
the New York event."It was a
time of enlightenment," said
one of them. "I learned about

some amazing facts and fig
ures, for example, all the mon
ey spent on nuclear weapons in
one day could feed the world
population for one year. That
we can unite that many people
from different groups under
one cause, peace, is a powerful
message we are sending the
world."
Secretary of Defense Casper
Weinberger, on a television
talk show taped the day before
the rally, claimed the demon
stration would not have a ma
jor impact on weapons
strategy. "(It) is something
people notice, but I don't think
that anybody rushes back and
says, ' We have to change our
policy.' "
The non-violent tone of the
march and rally was their big
gest asset. Gordon Davis, New
York City Parks Commissioner
said, "This is the most spec
tacular thing I have seen. The
people here have been better
behaved than the people I had
for dinner last week."
A 5000-member police force,
the largest ever assigned to one
event in the city's history,
monitored the demonstration.
A few arrests for minor of
fenses were made. Seventy-six
people were aided by the po
lice and the Emergency Medi
cal Service for, in most cases,
exhaustion and blisters.
