# Rostow: nuke attack plausible
## 
### Associated Press 
New York â€” Eugene Rostow,
director of the U.S. Arms Con
trol and Disarmament Agency,
said Sunday that an American
nuclear attack on Moscow and
Leningrad would be "plausible"
if the Soviet Union invaded West
Germany with conventional
weapons.
Rostow, who was interviewed
on NBC News' Meet the Press,
said that despite pacifist and
anti-nuclear weapons move
ments in Western Europe, the
region's political leaders need
and support the American "nu
clear umbrella."
"All the NATO allies (are) ex
tremely firm" in their support of
attempts to bolster the American

nuclear arsenal, he said. "They
know that their entire security
for the last generation has de
fended upon our implicit
threat, our nuclear guarantee
that we would use nuclear weap
ons if necesary to prevent them
from being overrun, even by
tanks."
"The nuclear umbrella on
which Europe and Japan and
many other countries have de
pended. .. is strongly and warm
ly defended by" American allies,
he added.
Rostow also said the Soviets
had been testing anti-satellite
weapons, but declined to go into
detail, citing security considera
tions.

During the show, host Bill
Monroe asked Rostow,
. .whether it's plausible to
think that if Soviet troops, artil
lery, tanks, conventional weap
ons come into Germany, we will
attack the Soviet Union with nu
clear weapons."
Rostow replied, "The ques
tion of the uncertainty of that re
sponse has been the main ele
ment of deterrence now for a
generation..
Monroe then asked, "You're
saying yes, that it is plausible that
we could counter with nuclear
weapons against a conventional
attack?"
Replied Rostow: "It is
plausible."
