## Advisers control Reagan's arms 
### 
New York — There was a con
tagious sense of optimism
among those who protested
against U.S./U.S.S.R. nuclear
policies in Central Park. The
demonstrators could feel
strength in numbers. As they say,
three-quarters of a million peo
ple can't be wrong.
The marchers, in fact, had ev
ery right to believe they were
having an impact. After all, Presi
dent Ronald Reagan had already
softened his anti-Soviet rhetoric,
acknowledged the legitimate in
tentions of anti-nuclear activists
and, most importantly, agreed to
strategic arms reduction talks
(START).
Unfortunately, record-setting
turnouts for rallies invariably dis
tort one's sense of political
power. In their enthusiasm, anti
nuclear sympathizers have un
derestimated some serious ob
stacles to continued success:
Reagan's nuclear-policy ad
visers.
Caspar Weinberger, the de
fense secretary, may have re
vealed the administration's real
attitude toward arms control in a
WNET television interview
broadcast Saturday, June 12.
"The fact that a very large
number of people turn out for a
particular event is certainly
something people notice,"
Weinberger declared, "but I
don't think anybody rushes back
and says, 'We have to change our
policy.'"
Indeed, the administration's
true arms control doctrine has
been stipulated by men who are
less apt to bend with the political
winds: Paul Nitze, Richard Perle,
Eugene Rostow and Edward
Rowny Jr. Though relatively un
known to the crowd in Central
Park, these insiders are the key
U.S. players whenever both sides
get down to business. The fearful
foursome has never hidden its
skepticism about agreements
with the Russians, and is likely to
carry this attitude into any U.S.-
Soviet talks.
• Ambassador for long-range
theater nuclear force nego
tiations, Nitze, 75, has been a
prominent hard-liner for more
than 30 years. He's convinced
that the Soviets have geared
their nuclear weapons buildup
toward an "eventual socialist
triumph."

In 1980, Nitze wrote in a For
eign Affairs article that a full
agreement limiting theater nu
clear weapons was an "unlikely
prospect."
• Assistant secretary of de
fense for international security
policy, the 41-year-old Perle is
responsible for the Pentagon's
"little State Department," over
seeing relations with NATO and
the Soviet Union. As a former
aide to Sen. Henry Jackson (D-
Wash.), he was once considered
the Senate bureaucracy's most
formidable opponent to arms
control. He is credited with
throwing a deadly pox on the
SALT II treaty ratification. A pas
sionate foe of the Soviet Union,
Perle believes that the Russians
have the only advantage in arms
control.
• Rostow, director of the Arms
Control and Disarmament
Agency, is a former Yale law pro
fessor and, like Perle and Rea
gan, was a member of the anti-
SALT "Committee on the Pres
ent Danger" before joining the
administration.
"... an investigation of Pro
fessor Rostow's past," declared
Herbert Scoville Jr., a former CIA
deputy director, at Rostow's
Senate confirmation hearings,
"has produced no evidence that'
he has the experience or the phi
losophy to serve as the chief gov
ernment spokesman for promot
ing our national security
through arms control."
A perhaps more frightening
revelation came during the same
hearings in an exchange be
tween Rostow and Foreign Rela
tions Committee member Sen.
Claiborne Pell (D-RI).
Pell: "In the event of a full nu
clear exchange between the So

viet Union and the United States,
do you envision either country
surviving to any substantial
degree?"
Rostow: "It depends on how
extensive the nuclear exchange
is.. .Japan, after all, not only sur
vived but flourished after the
nuclear attack..."
Pell: "My question is, in a full
nuclear exchange, would a
country survive?"
Rostow: "The human race is
very resilient, Sen. Pell."
• Special representative for
arms control and disarmament
negotiations, the 65-year-old
Rowny will head up Reagan's
START team. Though fluent in
Russian and knowledgeable on
the issues, he views the Russians
with little trust.
"We took our lumps three
times in SALT I, the ABM and
SALT II; we should be wary of
risking too much on a fourth go
around," wrote Rowny, a former
U.S. SALT II delegation member,
in his book, "The Problems of
Negotiating SALT."
Though their boss has had to
soften his tune to appease fright
ened Americans, these men are
hardly out of favor with the pres
ident. They will help to de
termine how, and if, Reagan puts
his peace words into action.
A logical next step for the
Americans peace movement
may be recognition that the
backroom planners are still as in
different to arms control as
Ronald Reagan once seemed.
With the Gang of Four at large,
effigies of a gun-slinging presi
dent are not enough.
