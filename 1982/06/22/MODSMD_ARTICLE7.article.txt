# Have anything to say?

Say it to the Daily. Anyone, anyone can write a column for us.
Now is the perfect time to write that commentary which has been
sitting in the back of your mind for months. Or that opinion which
is so important that it absolutely must be known to people other
than your roommate. You can write a full-length piece or a letter
to the editor. Whatever you have to say, we want to hear it.
So get out your typewriter, set the margins for a 57-space line,
and go to It. Try to express yourself as succinctly as possible. All
letters must be signed, and include a phone number. Finished
pieces can either be dropped at our office or mailed to us. Don't
