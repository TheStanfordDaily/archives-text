## Disarmament: It has to start somewhere 
### 
There is only one way to break
the vicious circle of nuclear arms
development in which the Unit
ed States and the Soviet Union
are trapped: steadfast refusal to
participate. More than two dec
ades of negotiations between
the two great powers to limit
arms development have resulted
in only more numerous and de
structive weapons. It has be
come clear that only unilateral
disarmament by the United
States can end this country's par
ticipation in the arms race.
Curiously enough, this simple
and straightforward approach to
the problem appears to be even
more "unthinkable" than the
horrors of nuclear war. We are
all so committed to the ideology
of nationalism that we cannot al
low ourselves to accept anything
less than U.S. domination of the
world.
Unilateral disarmament would
certainly reduce U.S. power, po
litically and, perhaps, economi
cally, in the world system. The
question we dare not ask
ourselves — "What's wrong with
that?" — is perhaps worthy of a
thorough examination. Before
mentioning some of the more
important considerations to be
dealt with in thinking about that
question, let me sketch brief re
plies to some of the main objec
tions to unilateral disarmament
that will be raised.
• Objection 1: The Commies
will take us over. What does this
really mean? Do we realty sup
pose that the Soviet Union
(aided, perhaps, by its mighty
and fearsome ally just 90 miles
off our coast, Cuba) will send in
her tanks, troops, com
missioners, five-year planners,
and all the rest, to run the show
here? Good luck — they will
need it. Picture the scene they
would face, invading and trying
to control the territory of the
rugged American individualist
cowboy. In every saloon, behind
every cactus, a Gary Cooper with
two six-guns eager for action.
Lurking through every office
building or dark alley, a Charles
Bronson out to get the really big
time thugs. Raiding every supply
depot, ammunition dump, and
Russian troop barrack, a Green
Beret with plenty of "hands-on

experience" and military surplus
equipment to make big trouble.
No, occupation of the United
States is hardly an inviting pros
pect.
• Objection 2: The Commies
will nuke us into oblivion. If they
can't take us over and draw the
Iron Curtain over the last and
only bastion of freedom in the
world, they'll just get rid of us.
Well, well, well — here we get
into some pretty interesting as
sumptions about international
politics, human nature, the Rus
sian outlook on life, and other
little issues like these.
Let's reverse the situation:
suppose we had absolutely wa
tertight proof that the Soviet
Union had unilaterally dis
mantled its entire nuclear
arsenal. Would we impose a final
solution on the Communist
problem, once and for all? No, of
course not, but we're ... dif
ferent. Better. Democratic.
Something. Or are we not so dif
ferent after all?
Let's be clear: they need us as
much as we need them. Without
another great power around,
there's no fun in international
politics. Without another great
power, even an emasculated
one, too much attention might
be given to Soviet domestic
problems. Without another
great power, the state religion
loses most of its force. Hence the
likely response by the Soviet
Union to our unilateral disarma
ment would be a redefinition of
the world situation to amplify
both the perceived threat posed
by other Western powers and
the strength of the U.S. military
in other respects.
•Objection 3: It's not political
ly possible to bring about unilat
eral disarmament. You're right:
it's unthinkable. Let's keep
thinking about it anyway.
The really serious problem, for
those who embrace American
nationalism, is that unilateral dis
armament would reduce t'
prominence of the United Stai
in world politics. It would low
us to a position even below that
of Britain. It would mean that the
Middle East antagonists would
worry less about U.S. policy
