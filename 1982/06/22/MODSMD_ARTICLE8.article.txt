## Disarmament: It has to start somewhere 
### 
There is only one way to break
the vicious circle of nuclear arms
development in which the Unit
ed States and the Soviet Union
are trapped: steadfast refusal to
participate. More than two dec
ades of negotiations between
the two great powers to limit
arms development have resulted
in only more numerous and de
structive weapons. It has be
come clear that only unilateral
disarmament by the United
States can end this country's par
ticipation in the arms race.
Curiously enough, this simple
and straightforward approach to
the problem appears to be even
more "unthinkable" than the
horrors of nuclear war. We are
all so committed to the ideology
of nationalism that we cannot al
low ourselves to accept anything
less than U.S. domination of the
world.
Unilateral disarmament would
certainly reduce U.S. power, po
litically and, perhaps, economi
cally, in the world system. The
question we dare not ask
ourselves — "What's wrong with
that?" — is perhaps worthy of a
thorough examination. Before
mentioning some of the more
important considerations to be
dealt with in thinking about that
question, let me sketch brief re
plies to some of the main objec
tions to unilateral disarmament
that will be raised.
• Objection 1: The Commies
will take us over. What does this
really mean? Do we realty sup
pose that the Soviet Union
(aided, perhaps, by its mighty
and fearsome ally just 90 miles
off our coast, Cuba) will send in
her tanks, troops, com
missioners, five-year planners,
and all the rest, to run the show
here? Good luck — they will
need it. Picture the scene they
would face, invading and trying
to control the territory of the
rugged American individualist
cowboy. In every saloon, behind
every cactus, a Gary Cooper with
two six-guns eager for action.
Lurking through every office
building or dark alley, a Charles
Bronson out to get the really big
time thugs. Raiding every supply
depot, ammunition dump, and
Russian troop barrack, a Green
Beret with plenty of "hands-on

experience" and military surplus
equipment to make big trouble.
No, occupation of the United
States is hardly an inviting pros
pect.
• Objection 2: The Commies
will nuke us into oblivion. If they
can't take us over and draw the
Iron Curtain over the last and
only bastion of freedom in the
world, they'll just get rid of us.
Well, well, well — here we get
into some pretty interesting as
sumptions about international
politics, human nature, the Rus
sian outlook on life, and other
little issues like these.
Let's reverse the situation:
suppose we had absolutely wa
tertight proof that the Soviet
Union had unilaterally dis
mantled its entire nuclear
arsenal. Would we impose a final
solution on the Communist
problem, once and for all? No, of
course not, but we're ... dif
ferent. Better. Democratic.
Something. Or are we not so dif
ferent after all?
Let's be clear: they need us as
much as we need them. Without
another great power around,
there's no fun in international
politics. Without another great
power, even an emasculated
one, too much attention might
be given to Soviet domestic
problems. Without another
great power, the state religion
loses most of its force. Hence the
likely response by the Soviet
Union to our unilateral disarma
ment would be a redefinition of
the world situation to amplify
both the perceived threat posed
by other Western powers and
the strength of the U.S. military
in other respects.
•Objection 3: It's not political
ly possible to bring about unilat
eral disarmament. You're right:
it's unthinkable. Let's keep
thinking about it anyway.
The really serious problem, for
those who embrace American
nationalism, is that unilateral dis
armament would reduce t'
prominence of the United Stai
in world politics. It would low
us to a position even below that
of Britain. It would mean that the
Middle East antagonists would
worry less about U.S. policy
toward the countries in the area.
It could also mean that the door
to foreign investment, cheap
foreign labor, repatriation of
profits, and the like, would be
closed part way in a fair number
of countries. Above all it would
deal a serious blow to that all-im
portant divinity, the spirit of the
American people.
Let us ask the question again:
what's wrong with that? As an aid
in thinking about that question, I
offer the following observations.
First: the United States is clear
ly declining in importance as a
political and economic actor on
the world scene anyway. The de
cline set in definitively with the
debacle of the Vietnam War, but
it has its roots in the very process
that brought the United States to
prominence after World War II
and is a normal feature of the
world system.
Every dominant world power
— from Venice and Genoa in the
Age of Exploration to Britain in
the 19th century — gradually
loses its control of world trade,
its formal or de facto colonies, its
military superiority over other
powers. The United States came
to the fore in a very peculiar era,
by means of a quantum leap in
military technology and the total
exhaustion or destruction of all
competing world powers. It was
an era in which the world was
ripe for the enthronement of the
ideologies of national self-de
termination, anti-im-

perialism,and anti-colonialism.
Small wonder that U.S.
hegemony could last only two or
three decades.
Unilateral disarmament would
hasten this process; we could no
longer bully anyone. But we are
on our way down now; further
armament and attempts to re
construct U.S. power under Rea
gan-type cowboys can only de
lay the day of reckoning and
make the transition to second
rank status more difficult to bear
(here lessons can be learned
from the British experience over
the past 40 years). It is far more
preferable to have Carter-type
farmers who know that you have
to go about your business and
get the peanuts harvested even if
there's been a take-over at the
town bank and you'll face harder
terms on the next loan you take
out.
Second: would the United
States really be hurt economical
ly by a definitive reduction in its
global political power? Yes —
but only to the extent that adap
tation to the changed situation
was resisted. Most of the eco
nomically developed countries
do not, after all, possess nuclear
weapons. Changed circum
stances would certainly require
new methods of doing business,
better negotiating skills, and
more serious efforts to under
stand other peoples' languages
and cultures. But adaptations of
this sort would be all to the good
for us highly insular Americans

— we might even become a little
less ethnocentric and more ap
preciative of other peoples.
Third: what effects would our
disarmament have on other na
tions that are now so firmly de
voted to normal power politics
throughout the world? We can
suppose that there would be a
great deal oi struggle among ma
jor and secondary powers to fill
the gap left by the United States.
It is quite possible that fairly seri
ous warfare would break out in
some places, even if the disarma
ment program were carried out
very gradually. It is, however,
also possible that disarmament
accompanied by a serious effort
to encourage international co
operation rather than competi
tion could lower tensions in
some of the regions of persistent
conflict for a substantial period
of time. In effect, we might gain
a bit of breathing room, and per
haps, the possibility of finding
some relatively permament solu
tion to the threat of nuclear war.
There is no security in nuclear
weapons — not for anyone. The
only way out of the morass of the
20th century is disarmament,
and it has to start somewhere.
Let it start here, let it be unilat
eral; let us take the risk to make
some really serious initiative
toward arms reduction, so that
we can avoid the even greater
risk of not doing so. Think about
it: what's wrong with that?

nomically developed countries
do not, after all, possess nuclear
weapons. Changed circum
stances would certainly require
new methods of doing business,
better negotiating skills, and
more serious efforts to under
stand other peoples' languages
and cultures. But adaptations of
this sort would be all to the good
for us highly insular Americans

— we might even become a little
less ethnocentric and more ap
preciative of other peoples.
Third: what effects would our
disarmament have on other na
tions that are now so firmly de
voted to normal power politics
throughout the world? We can
suppose that there would be a
great deal oi struggle among ma
jor and secondary powers to fill
the gap left by the United States.
It is quite possible that fairly seri
ous warfare would break out in
some places, even if the disarma
ment program were carried out
very gradually. It is, however,
also possible that disarmament
accompanied by a serious effort
to encourage international co
operation rather than competi
tion could lower tensions in
some of the regions of persistent
conflict for a substantial period
of time. In effect, we might gain
a bit of breathing room, and per
haps, the possibility of finding
some relatively permament solu
tion to the threat of nuclear war.
There is no security in nuclear
weapons — not for anyone. The
only way out of the morass of the
20th century is disarmament,
and it has to start somewhere.
Let it start here, let it be unilat
eral; let us take the risk to make
some really serious initiative
toward arms reduction, so that
we can avoid the even greater
risk of not doing so. Think about
it: what's wrong with that?
(John Boli is a research coordi
nator in the undergraduate stud
ies office.)
There is only one way to break
the vicious circle of nuclear arms
development in which the Unit
ed States and the Soviet Union
are trapped: steadfast refusal to
participate. More than two dec
ades of negotiations between
the two great powers to limit
arms development have resulted
in only more numerous and de
structive weapons. It has be
come clear that only unilateral
disarmament by the United
States can end this country's par
ticipation in the arms race.
Curiously enough, this simple
and straightforward approach to
the problem appears to be even
more "unthinkable" than the
horrors of nuclear war. We are
all so committed to the ideology
of nationalism that we cannot al
low ourselves to accept anything
less than U.S. domination of the
world.
Unilateral disarmament would
certainly reduce U.S. power, po
litically and, perhaps, economi
cally, in the world system. The
question we dare not ask
ourselves — "What's wrong with
that?" — is perhaps worthy of a
thorough examination. Before
mentioning some of the more
important considerations to be
dealt with in thinking about that
question, let me sketch brief re
plies to some of the main objec
tions to unilateral disarmament
that will be raised.
• Objection 1: The Commies
will take us over. What does this
really mean? Do we realty sup
pose that the Soviet Union
(aided, perhaps, by its mighty
and fearsome ally just 90 miles
off our coast, Cuba) will send in
her tanks, troops, com
missioners, five-year planners,
and all the rest, to run the show
here? Good luck — they will
need it. Picture the scene they
would face, invading and trying
to control the territory of the
rugged American individualist
cowboy. In every saloon, behind
every cactus, a Gary Cooper with
two six-guns eager for action.
Lurking through every office
building or dark alley, a Charles
Bronson out to get the really big
time thugs. Raiding every supply
depot, ammunition dump, and
Russian troop barrack, a Green
Beret with plenty of "hands-on

experience" and military surplus
equipment to make big trouble.
No, occupation of the United
States is hardly an inviting pros
pect.
• Objection 2: The Commies
will nuke us into oblivion. If they
can't take us over and draw the
Iron Curtain over the last and
only bastion of freedom in the
world, they'll just get rid of us.
Well, well, well — here we get
into some pretty interesting as
sumptions about international
politics, human nature, the Rus
sian outlook on life, and other
little issues like these.
Let's reverse the situation:
suppose we had absolutely wa
tertight proof that the Soviet
Union had unilaterally dis
mantled its entire nuclear
arsenal. Would we impose a final
solution on the Communist
problem, once and for all? No, of
course not, but we're ... dif
ferent. Better. Democratic.
Something. Or are we not so dif
ferent after all?
Let's be clear: they need us as
much as we need them. Without
another great power around,
there's no fun in international
politics. Without another great
power, even an emasculated
one, too much attention might
be given to Soviet domestic
problems. Without another
great power, the state religion
loses most of its force. Hence the
likely response by the Soviet
Union to our unilateral disarma
ment would be a redefinition of
the world situation to amplify
both the perceived threat posed
by other Western powers and
the strength of the U.S. military
in other respects.
•Objection 3: It's not political
ly possible to bring about unilat
eral disarmament. You're right:
it's unthinkable. Let's keep
thinking about it anyway.
The really serious problem, for
those who embrace American
nationalism, is that unilateral dis
armament would reduce t'
prominence of the United Stai
in world politics. It would low
us to a position even below that
of Britain. It would mean that the
Middle East antagonists would
worry less about U.S. policy
toward the countries in the area.
It could also mean that the door
to foreign investment, cheap
foreign labor, repatriation of
profits, and the like, would be
closed part way in a fair number
of countries. Above all it would
deal a serious blow to that all-im
portant divinity, the spirit of the
American people.
Let us ask the question again:
what's wrong with that? As an aid
in thinking about that question, I
offer the following observations.
First: the United States is clear
ly declining in importance as a
political and economic actor on
the world scene anyway. The de
cline set in definitively with the
debacle of the Vietnam War, but
it has its roots in the very process
that brought the United States to
prominence after World War II
and is a normal feature of the
world system.
Every dominant world power
— from Venice and Genoa in the
Age of Exploration to Britain in
the 19th century — gradually
loses its control of world trade,
its formal or de facto colonies, its
military superiority over other
powers. The United States came
to the fore in a very peculiar era,
by means of a quantum leap in
military technology and the total
exhaustion or destruction of all
competing world powers. It was
an era in which the world was
ripe for the enthronement of the
ideologies of national self-de
termination, anti-im-

perialism,and anti-colonialism.
Small wonder that U.S.
hegemony could last only two or
three decades.
Unilateral disarmament would
hasten this process; we could no
longer bully anyone. But we are
on our way down now; further
armament and attempts to re
construct U.S. power under Rea
gan-type cowboys can only de
lay the day of reckoning and
make the transition to second
rank status more difficult to bear
(here lessons can be learned
from the British experience over
the past 40 years). It is far more
preferable to have Carter-type
farmers who know that you have
to go about your business and
get the peanuts harvested even if
there's been a take-over at the
town bank and you'll face harder
terms on the next loan you take
out.
Second: would the United
States really be hurt economical
ly by a definitive reduction in its
global political power? Yes —
but only to the extent that adap
tation to the changed situation
was resisted. Most of the eco
nomically developed countries
do not, after all, possess nuclear
weapons. Changed circum
stances would certainly require
new methods of doing business,
better negotiating skills, and
more serious efforts to under
stand other peoples' languages
and cultures. But adaptations of
this sort would be all to the good
for us highly insular Americans

— we might even become a little
less ethnocentric and more ap
preciative of other peoples.
