# Funding act OK'd despite University lobby
## 
### Neil MacFarquhar 
The Small Business Innovation
Development Act, vigorously
opposed by Stanford, passed in
Congress, 353-57, Wednesday.
Under the new law, one and
one-quarter percent of the total
Federal research budget of $44
million must be set aside for re
search projects conducted by
small business. Stanford fought
hard against the measure, argu
ing that it would undercut fund
ing for "the most innovative por
tions of existing research ef
forts."
According to University Direc
tor of Government Relations
Larry Horton, the University's

opposition centers around the
fear that the required one-and
one-quarter percent set-asides
will come mainly from long
term research projects. The Uni
versity frequently works in con
junction with small businesses in
research and development, and
thus could indirectly benefit
from the bill. However, it is con
cerned that the set-aside alloca
tion system will move resources
away from long-term technolog
ical breakthroughs to the de
velopment of short-term com
mercial products — from new
understanding in high energy
physics, for example, to better
computer software.

Due to the new law, any feder
al agency with a research budget
greater than $100 million must
set as:de one and one-quarter
percent of their allotment for re
search done by businesses em
ploying less than 500 people. Al
though they can take the money
from a variety of areas, the bill
exempts in-house, or federal, re
search from any cuts, it exempts
the intelligence agencies from
setting aside funds, and it limits
the amount which can be taken
from innovative research.
For example, the Defense De
partment alone receives about
$20 billion dollars for Research
and Development (R & D), ac

cording to Horton. Of those
funds, 80 percent is allocated to
the continued development of
weapons systems already in the
planning stages. Once in the
planning stages this develop
ment is likely to be continued
and this amount of money
would effectively be exempt
from cuts, Horton said.
Of the remaining $4 billion,
about $3.3 billion is allocated to
applied research and only about
$700 million goes towards basic,
innovative research.
In an attempt to protect a cer
tain level of innovative research,
one of the few amendments
tacked to the bill limits the
amount of funding which can be
set aside from basic research to
1.25 percent. Thus, for example,
the defense department could
not cut more than $8.75 million
from its $700 million allocation
for basic research.
The loophole in this limita
tion, opponents pointout, isthat
the distinction between basic
and applied research is not clear
ly defined. Thus by reclassifying
projects agencies could cut
more than the prescribed limit
from basic research.
In addition to opposition from
universities, the bill was op
posed by the medical lobby, ag
ricultural interests, defense and
intelligence groups. In the
House, it was opposed by most
of the committees who control
allocations for research and de
velopment, including the Com
mittees on Science and Technol
ogy, on Armed Services, on
Energy and Commerce, on For
eign Affairs, on Intelligence, and
on Veteran's Affairs.
All of these committees ex
cept Foreign Affairs attempted
to add amendments to the bill
which would exempt the R&D
funds under their jurisdiction
from making set-asides. These
amendments were defeated on
the floor of the House, due
mainly to the lobbying efforts of
the House Small Business Com
mitee, according to Horton.
McCloskey was one of the
leaders of the fight against the
bill in the House. Don Dußane,
a spokesman for McClosky's of
fice, said that the measure
proved difficult to defeat be
cause, "it is politically important,
especially in an election year, to

appear to support small busi
nesses."
There would never have been
a fight in Congress at all, accord
ing to Dußane, had it not been
for the leadership of Horton and
University President Donald
Kennedy. Kennedy lead the op
position to the bill, testifying
against it before the House
Committee on Science and
Technology January 27.
Many Stanford faculty mem
bers wrote letters to Congress
opposing the bill. Henry Riggs,
chairman of industrial engineer
ing and engineering man
agement, opposed the legisla
tion "because the community of
effective, entrepreneurial, tech
nical companies doesn't need
it."
Nobel laureate and Economics
Prof. Kenneth Arrow said cur
rent tax laws were sufficient in
"encouraging innovative and
growing small business and rem
edying their comparative disad
vantage in access to the captial
market." Ultimately, he said, the
legislation could damage the in
novative advantages now held
by small firms. They will respond
less to the market and more
towards the "forced demands of
the government."
Others opposed to the bill said
it will be a subsidy to those com
panies who cannot compete in
the open marketplace due to the
questionable value of their re
search projects.
A similar bill, setting aside one
percent of the Federal research
budget for small businesses,
passed in the Senate 90-0 in De
cember.
The current administration,
though initially vigorously op
posed to the bill as a perfect ex
ample of needless government
intervention, abruptly switched
to supporting the bill before it
went to the Senate floor. This ef
fectively muzzled opposition to
the bill from many government
agencies. Although it is not clear
why the administration
switched, speculation centers on
the idea that President Ronald
Reagan agreed to back the bill in
the Senate in return for the sup
port of the bill's sponsor, Sen.
Warren Rudman (R-N.H.), for
the sale of AWACs to Saudi Ara
bia.
