## Israelis prevent peace 
### 
Anyone who has followed the
war in Lebanon only by reading
front page news reports might
well believe that Israel's massive
invasion was simply an effort to
achieve peace through sani
tation. Israel called the assault by
20,000 troops and armadas of
bombing planes and warships
"Operation Peace in Galilee,"
whose object was to "clean out"
Palestinian terrorists. Israeli of
.dls referred to the war as a
"purification campaign." Ac
cording to the press, after "ter
rorist strongholds" were
bombed into rubble, Israeli
troops went in to "mop up."
When terrorists and guerrillas
are the only named targets, it is
difficult to believe that human
blood is being spilled. Perhaps
for this reason columnist Joseph
Kraft could note with satisfaction
that Israel's invasion had opened
"corridors of opportunity" for
enhanced U.S. — Israeli in
fluence in the Middle East.
While West Beirut burned un
der day-long Israeli bombing at
tacks, President Reagan held a
friendly meeting with Prime
Minister Begin and reaffirmed
U.S. support for Israel. Mean
while anonymous Pentagon of
ficials were reported as pleased
at how well American-made
weapons had performed in Is
rael's lightning attack.
Despite the lack of horror on
the part of U.S. officials, the fact
remains that so far 26,000 people
have been killed or wounded in
Lebanon, and 600,000 driven
once more into desperate flight
from their homes.
Even these statistics don't re
veal the agonies of pain and de
spair inflicted, not on nameless
"terrorists," but on human
beings caught in the waves of in
discriminate shelling, torn by ex
ploding cluster bombs as they
lay in hospital beds, or left
without food, water, or medi
cine in the wastelands that were
once towns and cities.
One of the tragedies of this
war is that its victims have been
made to appear as somehow less
than human; their elimination
(Begin has used the word "ex
termination") is put forth as sim
ply a necessary measure to in
sure Israel's survival.
But in fact, the current havoc
in Lebanon is a result of Israel's
long standing determination to
avoid a possible peace settle
ment that would provide a per
manent home for the Palestinian
people.

Begin claimed that the June 7
invasion was a means of protect
ing Israelis in the Galilee from
Palestinian shelling. Butfor near
ly a year the PLO had scrupulous
ly observed a cease-fire despite
Israeli bombing raids and other
provocations. It was only after
massive Israeli bombing raids in
early June (following an as
sassination attempt against the
Israeli ambassador by ant/'-PLO
elements) that the PLO re
sponded, and the long-prepared
invasion was given its excuse.
Any excuse would have done;
the invasion was a crucial ele
ment in the Begin government's
approach to the Arab-Israeli
conflict, an approach that re
gards anything but a show of
force as a sign of weakness.
Ever since the Camp David
agreements, and especially in
the past year, Israel has been
tightening its hold on the oc
cupied territories — annexing
the Golan Heights, ousting
elected municipal officials on
the West Bank, creating new
lewish settlements, and, most re
cently, putting down protest
demonstrations with gunfire
that left 18 Palestinians dead.
After the return of the Sinai to
Egypt on April 26, Israel was ex
pected under the terms of Camp
David to take part in serious ne
gotiations leading to Palestinian
autonomy. But the Begin gov
ernment has repeatediy made
clear that it had no intention of
reaching an agreement that
would in any way loosen its con
trol of the occupied territories.
Its alternative was to crush the
PLO, the only organization that
could effectively bargain for the
Palestinians.
The invasion of Lebanon, with
its widespread and prolonged
bombing, was designed to de
stroy Palestinian leadership and
with it the ability of the Palesti
nians to achieve self-de
termination through peaceful
negotiations. Tragically, Israel's
success in weakening current
PLO leadership will leave the
way open for radical Palestinians
to resume terrorism as the only
alternative to submission.
Last April an Israeli editor and
former Knesset member, Uri Av
neri, published an open letter
appealing for dialogue between
Israel and the PLO. Avneri has
been in touch with the PLO lead
ership for several years and was
the recipient of a widely-publi
cized letter from Yassir Arafat's
chief political adviser supporting

the concept of an independent
Palestinian state that would live
in peace with Israel.
In criticizing Israel in
transigence over the occupied
territories, Avneri wrote: "We
are reaching the point of no re
turn, the point where there will
be neither a choice nor the pos
sibility of compromise, and no
chance for peace. The Govern
ment of Israel, with the approval
of the Labor Alignment, is de
termined to block forever the
possibility of an Israeli
withdrawl. From there on fhe
road will lead to inevitable wars
and mutual calamity."
Two months later Avneri's
prophecy seemed on the way to
fulfillment. On June 21, News
week's correspondent in Leba
non observed: "Israel's advance
had ravaged cities, killing civil
ians along with armed guerillas,
creating new droves of refugees
and new hatreds that would not
burn out soon. Operation Peace
in Galilee may have ended one
period of bloodshed, but it may
also have set the stage for anoth
er one."

approach to the Arab-Israeli
conflict, an approach that re
gards anything but a show of
force as a sign of weakness.
Ever since the Camp David
agreements, and especially in
the past year, Israel has been
tightening its hold on the oc
cupied territories — annexing
the Golan Heights, ousting
elected municipal officials on
the West Bank, creating new
lewish settlements, and, most re
cently, putting down protest
demonstrations with gunfire
that left 18 Palestinians dead.
After the return of the Sinai to
Egypt on April 26, Israel was ex
pected under the terms of Camp
David to take part in serious ne
gotiations leading to Palestinian
autonomy. But the Begin gov
ernment has repeatediy made
clear that it had no intention of
reaching an agreement that
would in any way loosen its con
trol of the occupied territories.
Its alternative was to crush the
PLO, the only organization that
could effectively bargain for the
Palestinians.
The invasion of Lebanon, with
its widespread and prolonged
bombing, was designed to de
stroy Palestinian leadership and
with it the ability of the Palesti
nians to achieve self-de
termination through peaceful
negotiations. Tragically, Israel's
success in weakening current
PLO leadership will leave the
way open for radical Palestinians
to resume terrorism as the only
alternative to submission.
Last April an Israeli editor and
former Knesset member, Uri Av
neri, published an open letter
appealing for dialogue between
Israel and the PLO. Avneri has
been in touch with the PLO lead
ership for several years and was
the recipient of a widely-publi
cized letter from Yassir Arafat's
chief political adviser supporting

the concept of an independent
Palestinian state that would live
in peace with Israel.
In criticizing Israel in
transigence over the occupied
territories, Avneri wrote: "We
are reaching the point of no re
turn, the point where there will
be neither a choice nor the pos
sibility of compromise, and no
chance for peace. The Govern
ment of Israel, with the approval
of the Labor Alignment, is de
termined to block forever the
possibility of an Israeli
withdrawl. From there on fhe
road will lead to inevitable wars
and mutual calamity."
Two months later Avneri's
prophecy seemed on the way to
fulfillment. On June 21, News
week's correspondent in Leba
non observed: "Israel's advance
had ravaged cities, killing civil
ians along with armed guerillas,
creating new droves of refugees
and new hatreds that would not
burn out soon. Operation Peace
in Galilee may have ended one
period of bloodshed, but it may
also have set the stage for anoth
er one."

Anyone who has followed the
war in Lebanon only by reading
front page news reports might
well believe that Israel's massive
invasion was simply an effort to
achieve peace through sani
tation. Israel called the assault by
20,000 troops and armadas of
bombing planes and warships
"Operation Peace in Galilee,"
whose object was to "clean out"
Palestinian terrorists. Israeli of
.dls referred to the war as a
"purification campaign." Ac
cording to the press, after "ter
rorist strongholds" were
bombed into rubble, Israeli
troops went in to "mop up."
When terrorists and guerrillas
are the only named targets, it is
difficult to believe that human
blood is being spilled. Perhaps
for this reason columnist Joseph
Kraft could note with satisfaction
that Israel's invasion had opened
"corridors of opportunity" for
enhanced U.S. — Israeli in
fluence in the Middle East.
While West Beirut burned un
der day-long Israeli bombing at
tacks, President Reagan held a
friendly meeting with Prime
Minister Begin and reaffirmed
U.S. support for Israel. Mean
while anonymous Pentagon of
ficials were reported as pleased
at how well American-made
weapons had performed in Is
rael's lightning attack.
Despite the lack of horror on
the part of U.S. officials, the fact
remains that so far 26,000 people
have been killed or wounded in
Lebanon, and 600,000 driven
once more into desperate flight
from their homes.
Even these statistics don't re
veal the agonies of pain and de
spair inflicted, not on nameless
"terrorists," but on human
beings caught in the waves of in
discriminate shelling, torn by ex
ploding cluster bombs as they
lay in hospital beds, or left
without food, water, or medi
cine in the wastelands that were
once towns and cities.
One of the tragedies of this
war is that its victims have been
made to appear as somehow less
than human; their elimination
(Begin has used the word "ex
termination") is put forth as sim
ply a necessary measure to in
sure Israel's survival.
But in fact, the current havoc
in Lebanon is a result of Israel's
long standing determination to
avoid a possible peace settle
ment that would provide a per
manent home for the Palestinian
people.

Begin claimed that the June 7
invasion was a means of protect
ing Israelis in the Galilee from
Palestinian shelling. Butfor near
ly a year the PLO had scrupulous
ly observed a cease-fire despite
Israeli bombing raids and other
provocations. It was only after
massive Israeli bombing raids in
early June (following an as
sassination attempt against the
Israeli ambassador by ant/'-PLO
elements) that the PLO re
sponded, and the long-prepared
invasion was given its excuse.
Any excuse would have done;
the invasion was a crucial ele
ment in the Begin government's
approach to the Arab-Israeli
conflict, an approach that re
gards anything but a show of
force as a sign of weakness.
