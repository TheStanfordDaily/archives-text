## Elusive, hard to find: the job search saga 
### 
Spending the summer in a
classroom may not be ideal.
Working 40 hours a week may
not epitomize that relaxing
summer you've been waiting
for. But consider yourselves
lucky. Read on, and learn of
the worst scenario here.. . that
of the unemployed.
The day begins early in our
trailer, as the three of us lie in
our beds thinking that lying
there for five extra minutes
may cause us to miss the op
portunity for that elusive
"job." So we get up.
We are at the Student Emplo
ment Office before the doors
open at 9 a.m. to peer through
the windows to see if there are
any new listings. If there are
any at all, we wait, in semi-op
timistic anticipation.
Not that these listings will
necessarily do us any good.
Twelve students call in on ev
ery job before it is taken off the
board. With any luck, we be
come one of the eight or so
who get an interview.
And those interviews! They
are often an incredibly de
meaning experience. But we,
who want jobs very badly, will
go to great lengths to impress
our prospective employers.
Dress is very important. We
must look business-like, yet
not too formal; responsible,
yet personable. Timing is im
perative. We arrive at the ap
pointed building about ten
minutes early, allowing time to
get lost inside and still be able
to enter the office at exactly the
correct hour.
During the interview, we re
member to laugh politely at
dumb jokes, smile, and keep
bringing up all the experience
we've had at similar jobs. We
must be effervescent, but not
too bubbly. And then we hear
the übiquitous "We'll let you
know by the end of the week."
Don't they understand that a
week is eternity when you're
looking for a job?
We have been to more than
20 job interviews among us in
the past two weeks. And all
we've come up with is one 15

hours per week position,
paying $3.85 an hour at a retail
bakery.
What is the matter here?
We're not unskilled. We're not
stupid. We're not inex
perienced either. Maybe he
didn't hear me when I said, "I
worked on a machine just like
this last summer." Maybe she
didn't believe me when I said,
"I'm willing to work this fall."
Still we continue our search.
Leaving the SEO behind, we
lower our aims a step. We nev
er thought we'd find ourselves
cruising the streets of
donwtown Palo Alto, but we'd
heard that pavement pounding
works. So we tried it.
We tried City Hall. But the
city enacted a hiring freeze two
days before.
We tried our favorite eating
establishments, bookstores,
and the like. Over and over, we
heard "We're not hiring now,
but if you'd like to fill out an
application .. ." The least
negative thing we heard all day
was "I just hired three people
yesterday. If only you'd come a
few days earlier..."
Our hopes were so smashed,
we even considered applying
at the Stanford Shopping Cen
ter. But then we'd have to work
with high school people! High
school! No, we just couldn't do
that.
We're not impatient. We
know finding a job takes time.
But as certain deadlines draw
nearer, the pressure builds.
One of us had the un
fortunate experience of calling
home to ask for rent money.
The conversation went some
thing like this:
"Dad, I need a $200 advance
to pay my rent."
"Do you have a job?"
"Well, I had two interviews
today, and they both look
promising."
"But do you have a job?"
"Well, not yet, but I will,
soon. I'm looking really hard."
"I just can't justify loaning
you $200 when you don't have
a job, especially when we have
a nice, empty room waiting for
you here at home."
Our roommate hung up the
phone shortly thereafter. She
turned to us and said, "They
don't understand... I'm physi
cally unable to live in that en
vironment. I would just die!"
As the tension builds, the
three of us are slowly losing our
sanity. We sit around looking at
the telephone. Every time it
rings, we jump at it and yell in
unison "Somebody wants to
offer me a job!"
The one who was lucky
enough to land the 15 hour job
sat down and figured out that
at her present salary, she could
pay rent ana have $59 left over.
That translates into $1.05 per
day for food, entertainment,
essentials ... everything. The
situation does not look good.
Our fourth trailermate has a
full-time job. And she sits
around complaining about her
boss, how boring her job is,
and how she never has any
time to exercise. Somehow,
our sympathy is just not with
her.

Elizabeth Drye are un
employed students taking the
summer off).

Spending the summer in a
classroom may not be ideal.
Working 40 hours a week may
not epitomize that relaxing
summer you've been waiting
for. But consider yourselves
lucky. Read on, and learn of
the worst scenario here.. . that
of the unemployed.
The day begins early in our
trailer, as the three of us lie in
our beds thinking that lying
there for five extra minutes
may cause us to miss the op
portunity for that elusive
"job." So we get up.
We are at the Student Emplo
ment Office before the doors
open at 9 a.m. to peer through
the windows to see if there are
any new listings. If there are
any at all, we wait, in semi-op
timistic anticipation.
Not that these listings will
necessarily do us any good.
Twelve students call in on ev
ery job before it is taken off the
board. With any luck, we be
come one of the eight or so
who get an interview.
And those interviews! They
are often an incredibly de
meaning experience. But we,
who want jobs very badly, will
go to great lengths to impress
our prospective employers.
Dress is very important. We
must look business-like, yet
not too formal; responsible,
yet personable. Timing is im
perative. We arrive at the ap
pointed building about ten
minutes early, allowing time to
get lost inside and still be able
to enter the office at exactly the
correct hour.
During the interview, we re
member to laugh politely at
dumb jokes, smile, and keep
bringing up all the experience
we've had at similar jobs. We
must be effervescent, but not
too bubbly. And then we hear
the übiquitous "We'll let you
know by the end of the week."
Don't they understand that a
week is eternity when you're
looking for a job?
We have been to more than
20 job interviews among us in
the past two weeks. And all
we've come up with is one 15

hours per week position,
paying $3.85 an hour at a retail
bakery.
What is the matter here?
We're not unskilled. We're not
stupid. We're not inex
perienced either. Maybe he
didn't hear me when I said, "I
worked on a machine just like
this last summer." Maybe she
didn't believe me when I said,
"I'm willing to work this fall."
Still we continue our search.
Leaving the SEO behind, we
lower our aims a step. We nev
er thought we'd find ourselves
cruising the streets of
donwtown Palo Alto, but we'd
heard that pavement pounding
works. So we tried it.
We tried City Hall. But the
city enacted a hiring freeze two
days before.
We tried our favorite eating
establishments, bookstores,
and the like. Over and over, we
heard "We're not hiring now,
but if you'd like to fill out an
application .. ." The least
negative thing we heard all day
was "I just hired three people
yesterday. If only you'd come a
few days earlier..."
Our hopes were so smashed,
we even considered applying
at the Stanford Shopping Cen
ter. But then we'd have to work
with high school people! High
school! No, we just couldn't do
that.
We're not impatient. We
know finding a job takes time.
But as certain deadlines draw
nearer, the pressure builds.
One of us had the un
fortunate experience of calling
home to ask for rent money.
The conversation went some
thing like this:
"Dad, I need a $200 advance
to pay my rent."
"Do you have a job?"
"Well, I had two interviews
today, and they both look
promising."
"But do you have a job?"
"Well, not yet, but I will,
soon. I'm looking really hard."
"I just can't justify loaning
you $200 when you don't have
a job, especially when we have
a nice, empty room waiting for
you here at home."
Our roommate hung up the
phone shortly thereafter. She
turned to us and said, "They
don't understand... I'm physi
cally unable to live in that en
vironment. I would just die!"
As the tension builds, the
three of us are slowly losing our
sanity. We sit around looking at
the telephone. Every time it
rings, we jump at it and yell in
unison "Somebody wants to
offer me a job!"
The one who was lucky
enough to land the 15 hour job
sat down and figured out that
at her present salary, she could
pay rent ana have $59 left over.
That translates into $1.05 per
day for food, entertainment,
essentials ... everything. The
situation does not look good.
Our fourth trailermate has a
full-time job. And she sits
around complaining about her
boss, how boring her job is,
and how she never has any
time to exercise. Somehow,
our sympathy is just not with
her.
