# Art panel commissions controversial sculpture

Kenneth Snelson's Mozart 1,
the University's newest outdoor
sculpture, has been variously
labeled "a graceful structure of
heavy stainless steel pipe and
cable/' "(a) haphazard bundle
of metal," and "Mem jungle
Gym."
The sculpture, installed this
spring between the bookstore
and Meyer library, stirred up a
campus controversy over the
selection and placement of out
door sculpture aesthetic here.
Several letters published in the
Daily criticized the sculpture
and the committee process by
which it was selected. But ac
cording to Law Prof. John Mer
ryman, chairman of the Univer
sity Panel on Outdoor Art,
"feedback (on the sculpture)
from the beginning has been
quite heavily positive."
The decision to commission
the Snelson sculpture, and the
decision on where it would be
located, were made by the Uni
versity Panel on Outdoor Art. In
addition to Merryman, panel
members include Chemistry
Prof. Carl Djerassi, Art Profs. Al
bert Elsen, Kurt Forster and Paul
Turner, former Vice-President of
Development Joel Smith, and
Director of Planning Phil Wil
liams. Assisting the panel were
Director Henry Hopkins and As
sistant Director George Neubert
of the San Francisco Museum of

Modern Art.
The panel is an ongoing com
mittee which meets "when any
body gets a gleam in their eye,"
said Williams. Members of the
panel try to be aware of the avail
ability of new sculpture and in
terested donors.
Williams said, "Whoever
comes up with an opportunity
rounds up information, and
John (Merryman) gets the com
mittee together."
Williams praised Elsen for his
contributions to the panel. "(He)
is usually the radar (for the
panel), because he knows
donors." Williams called Elsen
"the le2ding guy in getting it (the
Snelson sculpture) launched."
The panel had "the idea from
the beginning" to purchase the
sculpture, and was aided by the
Office of Sponsored Projects in
obtaining the funding.
The panel was responsible for
getting a supporting grant of
$35,000 from the National En
dowment for the Arts (NEA).
And while the exact amount
donated for the purchase by
University alumni joAnne and
Julian Ganz was "not available,"
Daily sources indicate that the
total cost of the sculpture was
"within the range of" $110,000.
In Mozart 1, Snelson uses his
priciples of "tensegrity," de
scribed by Elsen in Campus Re
port as "a floating equilibrium
between compression and ten

sion using the analogy of the
human body, the tubes repre
sent the bones (compression)
and the cables the muscles (ten
sion)."
Because of this use of tensegri
ty, the sculpture should prove
highly earthquake-resistant. Ac
cording to Merryman, another
positive quality of the sculpture
is that "it's a see-through piece."
The stainless steel sculpture is
also weather resistant, and will
require minimal upkeep.
Merryman said he enjoys peo
ple's reactions to the sculpture.
"I go over there and stand
around and just listen to their
comments." Merryman cited in
itial responses: "There was an in
teresting comment ... people
were baffled, they were just
curious, and wanted to know if it
was permanent."
Snelson, assisted by a group of
engineering students and facul
ty, supervised the installation of
the sculpture during May 9-12.
He watched as the sculpture was
being put up, and he described
the festive mood as "like a par
ty." Those who helped, and
talked with Snelson, "went away
feeling positive" about Mozart
7, Merryman said.
On May 14, Soto residents
added their own touch to the
newly-dedicated sculpture by
hanging laundry on the lower
cables of the piece. Williams
called the Soto prank "a sort of

whimsical thing" but noted that
the students "could have waited
a while," as Snelson had been on
campus for the dedication only
two days earlier.
Snelson, a native Oregonian,
is an internationally-known ar
tist who has works in American,
European and Australian public

collections, and will soon be
honored with a retrospective ex
hibition at the Guggenheim
Museum in New York.
Both the Ganz's graduated
from the University in 1951, and
their collection of 19th-century
American art was exhibited last
year at the National Gallery in
Washington, D.C.
