# Bell Labs 'engineers' graduate scholarship program
## 
### Karen Springen 
One-quarter of the students
receiving masters degrees in
electrical engineering here each
year are sponsored by Bell Labo
ratories, which pays the Univer
sity full tuition for each student
and gives an additional sum
roughly equal to the cost of tui
tion to the student's depart
ment. This makes the total
payment per student around
twice the normal cost.
According to Madelyn Hunt,
assistant dean at the School of
Engineering, Bell gives a "gift" to
each student's department "to
aid their educational program."
Hunt added that the gift is not
required by the University and
that the money is placed in un
restricted department funds.
The Bell policy of giving the
University extra money for stu
dents it sponsors has no effect on

the admissions process, accord
ing to Hunt. However, Hunt said
that a student's employment
with Bell would be listed on a
normal application.
Many students, upon accep
tance into the graduate pro
gram, apply to Bell and other
corporations for sponsorship,
she said, adding that this pro
cedure was independent of the
University.
In addition to paying full tui
tion for each of the 100 students
they sponsor here each year, Bell
pays the students reduced
salaries. Because they do not
have to serve as teaching assis
tants or hold down a job, the stu
dents are able to receive their
degree in one year. Thus, they
receive the nickname "OYOCs"
(one year on campus). Normally,
graduate students work or serve
as teaching assistants to finance

their study.
The program's fringe benefits
also help increase its attractive
ness to students. For example,
Bell pays for its students' reloca
tion to California. (Bell Labs is
East coast-based, and Bell stu
dents are also generally from the
East.)
According to Jose Enciso, a
Bell-sponsored graduate stu
dent in electrical engineering,
Bell also foots the bill for two
trips home during the year.
Enciso added that upon com
pletion of their studies, students
are under no legal obligation to
work for Bell. But he said that
about 96 of 100 Bell students
here last year went to work for
Bell after receiving their
degrees.
To obtain Bell sponsorship,
student's must hold under
graduate degrees in technical

fields. Fifty of the 100 students
here are electrical engineers.
Other popular fields include op
erations research, statistics, and
mechanical engineering.
According to Enciso, Bell's re
cruitment procedures are similar
to those of other companies.
"They just show up on campus
with the rest of the companies,"
he said. Students have a brief in
terview on campus. But Enciso
said, "The real interview is the
plant trip."
After the plant trip, Bell re
cruits give the company an order
of department preference.
Selected students then work for
Bell the summer before gradu
ate school.
Bell does not "police" its stu
dents while they are at Stanford
but the company's "Education in
Training" program does oversee
student performance. Like other

graduate students, the Bell stu
dents must maintain a "B" aver
age to graduate. But in contrast
to other students, they are not
permitted to take non-technical
courses.
Enciso said Bell allows its re
cruits to choose from about a
dozen schools. He noted the ap
peal of the West coast to Bell's
Eastern recruits. Most Bell labo
ratories are in New Jersey (the
farthest west being in Denver).
Enciso added that Bell's fa
vored schools include Stevens,
Princeton, MIT, Purdue,
Carnegie and Cornell.
Enciso claimed that most pro
fessors are not particularly fond
of Bell students. "Professors like
to have people stay for drawn
out research." This eliminates
Bell students, who are required
to finish within one year.
