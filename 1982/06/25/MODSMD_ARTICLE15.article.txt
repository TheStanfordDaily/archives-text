### Lisa Tseng 
"Summer at Stanford is green
grass, beige buildings, red-tile
roofs, and blue sunny skies. Days
are warm, nights are cool, and
the humidity is comfortably
low." Sound appealing? Over
125 conference groups thought
so. And they responded to this
conference management ad
vertisement by scheduling their
conferences here so that
thousands of could
use University facilities to ac
complish their varied goals.
During the upcoming summer
months beginning in mid-June
and ending in mid-September,
approximately 125 conferences
and 12,500 conferees will visit
the University for anywhere
from two days to 13 weeks.
A variety of groups will utilize
campus facilities to fulfill the
needs of their specially fash
ioned curriculums. Participants
are of all ages, and many come
from as far away as China or Bra
zil while others are as local as
nearby Palo Alto.
Sports conferences such as
pole vaulting camps, tennis or
ganizations, karate associations,
and cheerleading groups em
ploy the University's extensive
athletic facilities throughout the
summer. Business trainees and
technical executives, on the oth
er hand, will hold daily lectures

The resort-like atmosphere is furthured with
linen services, maids, messengers, and porters.
Lounges and outdoor patio furniture are
removed from winter storage to liven up
courtyards and decks. Any conference desiring a
special banquet, barbeque, or cocktail party can
select from a complete range of catering services
and entertaining facilities.

and workshops in auditoriums
and meeting halls about campus.
Food service is provided pre
dominantly in Wilbur for those
residing on the East side of cam

privately as in Storey House or
decide not to include meal plans
at all, especially groups working
at a distance from their resi
dences such as law and medical

seminars.

The size and scope of summer
conferences has grown dramati
cally from the 317 peoplewhoat
tended conferences in 1947 to
the 5800 who attended in 1967 to
this year's total of 12,500. The
program has grown because of a
strong marketing effort and the
high quality of the services of
fered, according to Conference
Manager Lois Fariello, who has
witnessed much of that growth
in her 22 year tenure.
All profits, received from the
three months of conferences are
put back into the University's
general operating budget, she
said.
Nearly 50 students are also
provided with summer em
ployment by helping out the
constant flow and change of
conferences. Some work as part-

time porters and bartenders,
others act as resident assistants
and night watchmen.
The variety of conferences in
clude some organized around
political topics. This year the
Summer Alumni College brings
alumni back from July 30 to Au
gust 8 for a conference centering
on a New Conservatism theme.

Such a seminar is held annually,
and each year a different theme
is selected. China and Marxism
are two themes seen in past
years.

Upward Bound and Migrant
Education conferences are de
signed to let children explore ac
ademic and social opportunities
available to them. Special in
struction in math, reading, or
computer technology allows the
youngsters to broaden ex

One of the most popular cate
gories of conferences centers
around athletics. Four spirit as
sociations will train cheerleaders
in three 5-day camps while judo
delegations from Japan and Jor
danian tennis teams will both be
at Stanford some time in July.
National events like the

Runner's World corporate Cup
Track Meet and U.S. Water Polo

One of the larger and more
exclusive conferences, the Stan

ford Executive Program, brought
here by the Graduate School of
Business, will reside in Lagunita
for an eight-week stay from June
20 to August 12. This program
draws business executives from
firms and corporations across

the country to learn about up
dated developments and dis
coveries in the business world.
Typical of the many sciences
conferences is the Beijing Elec

engineers from the People's Re

there will be six independent in

ferences working under a grant
come here to share results and
discuss new findings with the

ferences with 2044 conferees on
campus.
