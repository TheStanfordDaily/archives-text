The General ★★★★
New Varsity, Palo Alto
Buster Keaton's silent films are
masterpieces of comic timing.
The General is a clockwork par
able of the civil war: Keaton, a
railroad engineer, saves his hon
or through a stunningly or
chestrated series of calamities.
Keaton's world balances be
tween the happy accident and to
tal disaster —and it's not unusual
for the two to turn out to be the
same thing.
Keaton's gift is for making the
fantastic seem ordinary. By com
parison, the ordinary seems
hilariously out of place.
Plays Monday with another
Keaton film, Steamboat Bill Jun
ior.
— Jim Mattson
Star Trek II
Palo Alto Square
An enjoyably dopey movie,
which strolls fearlessly down the
dark corridor that lies between
pretentiousness and utter
absurdity. Most of the cast of the
'60s television series is back. The
characters have been given pro
motions (except, rather upset
tingly, Uhura, who's still in her
old position of hyper-space sec
retary), but the dialogue they
speak is still as weirdly stilted as
ever. Nicholas Meyer, who
directed the often charming sci
ence fantasy Time After Time, is
at the helm, and does a good job
of keeping things moving fast
enough so the movie never really
grates on you.

Fox, Redwood City
Julie Andrews plays nursemaid
to seven singing lentils and their
crusty old father. She loses her
nunliness in the process, but ev
erything's okay in the end be
cause she gets to be a singing
mommy instead.
Plays Sunday with Fiddler on
the Roof.
— J.M.

Shoot the Moon ★★★★
Fox, Redwood City
Perhaps the most intense ex
pression of domestic pain ever
conceived for American movies.
Diane Keaton and Albert Finney,
as a couple whose marriage is
breaking up, and Dana Hill, as
their sensitive eldest daughter,
give superlative performances;
this is the kind of acting that is
authentic in every detail because
it seems to have been dug from
the bowels. Bo Goldman's
screenplay can lay claim to being
among the best film writing ever
done by an American. The direc
tion by Alan Parker is surprisingly
graceful, genuine and deeply
moving; it suggests a more
agonized domestic Renoir.
Plays Saturday only with Two
for the Road, a comedy which
stars Audrey Hepburn and Albert
Finney.
— Steve Vineberg
Reds
New Varsity, Palo Alto
An intelligent, unconven
tional, craftsmanlike movie, re
markably coherent and sus
tained. The first part, most of
which is given over to the
burgeoning relationship be
tween reporter-revolutionary
jack Reed (Warren Beatty) and
would-be writer Louise Bryant
(Diane Keaton), could stand
restructuring, but in part two, af
ter the experience of the Russian
Revolution, the two characters
are jerked into adulthood, and
they turn out to be fascinating
people whose interaction truly
holds the screen. Beatty and
Keaton's acting may never have
been better than it is in the last 90
minutes, and they are superbly
supported by Jack Nicholson as
Eugene O'Neill and Maureen
Stapleton as Emma Goldman.
Plays Saturday and Sunday
with the comedy short, The
Dove.
— S.V.

Atlantic City ★★★★
New Varsity, Palo Alto
One character in Atlantic City
tells another, "I never wear seat
belts — I don't believe in grav
ity." It's evident that director
Louis Malle and screenwriter
john Cuare don't believe in grav
ity, either — their movie, which
deals with love, chance, and co
caine-peddling, levitates effort
lessly between black comedy and
pathos without ever quite settling
in either condition. Susan Saran
don plays Sally, a waitress study
ing to be a blackjack dealer, and
Burt Lancaster plays Lou, a former
second-rate gangster now turned
second-rate numbers runner.
Both are better than they've ever
been.
Tonight only, with Pretty Baby.

Sunday, Memorial Auditorium
Colin Higgins' prefab comedy
tries very hard to update
Hitchcock's comedy thrillers; it!
ends up turning the droll
Hitchcock wit into the stuff of TV
sitcoms. The Goldie Hawn-Chevy
Chase pairing has its moments
(and Goldie is worth watching in
almost anything), but Chase's
two-bit Cary Grant send-up
wears thin before the end is
reached. Set in San Francisco; the
obligatory car chase may make
your head hurt.

New Varsity, Palo Alto
Costa-Gavras' political
melodrama take place in Chile
during the 1973 coup, but it
seems to be set in hell. The film,
made with an open leftist bias, is a
stunning demonstration of what
it is like to be in a country in a
state of seige, and as the wife of
the missing American, Sissy
Spacek does her best work in
years. However, there is a second
plot — the politicization of her
father-in-law, dreadfully played
by Jack Lemmon — that nearly
wrecks the movie.
Plays Tuesday and Wednesday
with The Amateur.

New Varsity, Palo Alto
Costa-Gavras' political
melodrama take place in Chile
during the 1973 coup, but it
seems to be set in hell. The film,
made with an open leftist bias, is a
stunning demonstration of what
it is like to be in a country in a
state of seige, and as the wife of
the missing American, Sissy
Spacek does her best work in
years. However, there is a second
plot — the politicization of her
father-in-law, dreadfully played
by Jack Lemmon — that nearly
wrecks the movie.
Plays Tuesday and Wednesday
with The Amateur.
— S.V.

The General ★★★★
New Varsity, Palo Alto
Buster Keaton's silent films are
masterpieces of comic timing.
The General is a clockwork par
able of the civil war: Keaton, a
railroad engineer, saves his hon
or through a stunningly or
chestrated series of calamities.
Keaton's world balances be
tween the happy accident and to
tal disaster —and it's not unusual
for the two to turn out to be the
same thing.
Keaton's gift is for making the
fantastic seem ordinary. By com
parison, the ordinary seems
hilariously out of place.
Plays Monday with another
Keaton film, Steamboat Bill Jun
ior.

Star Trek II
Palo Alto Square
An enjoyably dopey movie,
which strolls fearlessly down the
dark corridor that lies between
pretentiousness and utter
absurdity. Most of the cast of the
'60s television series is back. The
characters have been given pro
motions (except, rather upset
tingly, Uhura, who's still in her
old position of hyper-space sec
retary), but the dialogue they
speak is still as weirdly stilted as
ever. Nicholas Meyer, who
directed the often charming sci
ence fantasy Time After Time, is
at the helm, and does a good job
of keeping things moving fast
enough so the movie never really
grates on you.

The Sound of Music ★
Fox, Redwood City
Julie Andrews plays nursemaid
to seven singing lentils and their
crusty old father. She loses her
nunliness in the process, but ev
erything's okay in the end be
cause she gets to be a singing
mommy instead.
Plays Sunday with Fiddler on
the Roof.

Shoot the Moon ★★★★
Fox, Redwood City
Perhaps the most intense ex
pression of domestic pain ever
conceived for American movies.
Diane Keaton and Albert Finney,
as a couple whose marriage is
breaking up, and Dana Hill, as
their sensitive eldest daughter,
give superlative performances;
this is the kind of acting that is
authentic in every detail because
it seems to have been dug from
the bowels. Bo Goldman's
screenplay can lay claim to being
among the best film writing ever
done by an American. The direc
tion by Alan Parker is surprisingly
graceful, genuine and deeply
moving; it suggests a more
agonized domestic Renoir.
Plays Saturday only with Two
for the Road, a comedy which
stars Audrey Hepburn and Albert
Finney.
— Steve Vineberg
Reds
New Varsity, Palo Alto
An intelligent, unconven
tional, craftsmanlike movie, re
markably coherent and sus
tained. The first part, most of
which is given over to the
burgeoning relationship be
tween reporter-revolutionary
jack Reed (Warren Beatty) and
would-be writer Louise Bryant
(Diane Keaton), could stand
restructuring, but in part two, af
ter the experience of the Russian
Revolution, the two characters
are jerked into adulthood, and
they turn out to be fascinating
people whose interaction truly
holds the screen. Beatty and
Keaton's acting may never have
been better than it is in the last 90
minutes, and they are superbly
supported by Jack Nicholson as
Eugene O'Neill and Maureen
Stapleton as Emma Goldman.
Plays Saturday and Sunday
with the comedy short, The
Dove.
— S.V.

Atlantic City ★★★★
New Varsity, Palo Alto
One character in Atlantic City
tells another, "I never wear seat
belts — I don't believe in grav
ity." It's evident that director
Louis Malle and screenwriter
john Cuare don't believe in grav
ity, either — their movie, which
deals with love, chance, and co
caine-peddling, levitates effort
lessly between black comedy and
pathos without ever quite settling
in either condition. Susan Saran
don plays Sally, a waitress study
ing to be a blackjack dealer, and
Burt Lancaster plays Lou, a former
second-rate gangster now turned
second-rate numbers runner.
Both are better than they've ever
been.
Tonight only, with Pretty Baby.
— J.M.
Foul Play **
Sunday, Memorial Auditorium
Colin Higgins' prefab comedy
tries very hard to update
Hitchcock's comedy thrillers; it!
ends up turning the droll
Hitchcock wit into the stuff of TV
sitcoms. The Goldie Hawn-Chevy
Chase pairing has its moments
(and Goldie is worth watching in
almost anything), but Chase's
two-bit Cary Grant send-up
wears thin before the end is
reached. Set in San Francisco; the
obligatory car chase may make
your head hurt.
