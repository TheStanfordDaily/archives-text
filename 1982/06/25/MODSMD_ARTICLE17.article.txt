## Spielberg weaves magic 
### Steve Vineberg 
The setting for the opening
scene of Steven Spielberg's E.T.
the Extra-Terrestrial is a fairy
tale sky full of stars that closely
resembles the one in Close En
counters of the Third Kind: it's
the kind of sky that spaceships
glide through on their way to
earth. E.T. begins where Close
Encounters peaked — with the
descent of an alien craft — and
gets better and better from
there. It's an absolutely entran
cing movie — a miracle; when
you walk out of the theater af
ter it's over, your visual sense of
whatever surrounds you is mys
teriously heightened for a
while, and you may feel as if
you've just been granted some
special grace.
The plot of the film is simple,
but Melissa Mathison's
screenplay invests the narrative
with clarity and a consistent vi
sion. Mathison worked on the
script for Carroll Ballard's The
Black Stallion, a wonderful
movie that shared with E.T. an
understanding of how children
regard the world, and a vivid
sense of the magical. In both
movies, the children blessed
with a special relationship to
the title characters have lost
fathers; both films offer emo
tional compensation to their
young protagonists. In E.T., El
liott (Henry Thomas), who is
about ten, his kid sister Gertie
(Drew Barrymore, of the Bar
rymores), and his brother
•Michael (Robert M a c -
Naughton), who seems to have
just rounded the corner into
teenhood, live with their
mother Mary (Dee Wallace),
because their father has run off
to Mexico with another wom
an. Mary has a loose, friendly
rapport with her kids and with

Michael's bicycle demon pals
(K.C. Martel, Sean Frye, Tom
Howell); they're very fond of
her but they know she'll let
them get away with murder.
Wallace makes Mary both ex
tremely appealing and child
ish-spacey enough so that we
can see why a grown man
might leave her. She's the kind
of mother who, nestled up
against the pillows of her
daughter's bed to read Peter
Pan to her, is as transported by
the story as Gertie'is — the kind
of mother who loves the idea
of Halloween so much that she
dresses up for it, too, even
though she's stuck at home
while the children go trick-or
treating.
Elliott is the first of the trio to
become acquainted with the
extra-terrestrial ("E.T." is their
name for him) who, terrified by
the enormous humans who
track through the tall grass af
ter him when his spaceship ac
cidentally abandons him, has
been camping out in the fami
ly's toolshed. (This chase, much
of which is shot from E.T.'s
point of view, is ingeniously ed
ited by Carol Littleton and
almost unbearably exciting; it's
such a riveting grabber that
fear that the rest of the movie
will be a disappointment. Such
fears are groundless.)
Spielberg handles the initial
encounter between these two
with delicate wit; somehow he
lets us feel both Elliott's fear
and E.T.'s. He achieves the
same effect again when Gertie
sees E.T. for the first time,
though the results are much
more explosive and much fun
nier.
To Gertie, who dresses him
up like one of her dolls, E.T. is
another marvel in a world still

new enough to be full of them,
but Elliott and Michael are old
enough to have acquired a cer
tain amount of suburban blase
and therefore to be truly
enchanted by their visitor. E.T.
brings out the best in the boys
— their sweetness and sensi
tivity and loyalty. In this most
benevolent of fantasies,
Spielberg and Mathison have
provided a kind world to
sheltertheiralien in, a world —
a child's world, of course —
that is ready to receive him.
There isn't a moment of cruelty
in the film (though there is a
great deal of suspense), and
Spielberg's vision is so over
whelming that he makes it dif
ficult for us to conceive of
cruelty while we are watching
the picture. E.T. taps into El
liott's feelings, establishing so
strong a bond that when E.T.
feels pain or fear, Elliott has an
immediate sympathetic re
sponse. E.T. enriches Elliott's
life beyond measure by accept
ing his love and, in return, ex
panding his capacity for love.
Spielberg uses his filmmaker's
magic to tap into our feelings,
and the result is a movie of ex
traordinary emotional power
culminating in one of the most
strangely moving denoue
ments a director has ever
brought off.
Indeed, Spielberg's gifts
have never been so richly in ev
idence before. I found Raiders
of the Lost Ark dismaying be
cause, for all the boys' adven
ture serial spirit it was
purported to possess, I
couldn't see any spirit in it at
all; coldly efficient and re
markably unimaginative, it
gave off bad vibes — as if
Spielberg hadn't really enjoyed
