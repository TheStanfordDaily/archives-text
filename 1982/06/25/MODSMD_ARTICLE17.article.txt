## Spielberg weaves magic 
### Steve Vineberg 
The setting for the opening
scene of Steven Spielberg's E.T.
the Extra-Terrestrial is a fairy
tale sky full of stars that closely
resembles the one in Close En
counters of the Third Kind: it's
the kind of sky that spaceships
glide through on their way to
earth. E.T. begins where Close
Encounters peaked — with the
descent of an alien craft — and
gets better and better from
there. It's an absolutely entran
cing movie — a miracle; when
you walk out of the theater af
ter it's over, your visual sense of
whatever surrounds you is mys
teriously heightened for a
while, and you may feel as if
you've just been granted some
special grace.
The plot of the film is simple,
but Melissa Mathison's
screenplay invests the narrative
with clarity and a consistent vi
sion. Mathison worked on the
script for Carroll Ballard's The
Black Stallion, a wonderful
movie that shared with E.T. an
understanding of how children
regard the world, and a vivid
sense of the magical. In both
movies, the children blessed
with a special relationship to
the title characters have lost
fathers; both films offer emo
tional compensation to their
young protagonists. In E.T., El
liott (Henry Thomas), who is
about ten, his kid sister Gertie
(Drew Barrymore, of the Bar
rymores), and his brother
•Michael (Robert M a c -
Naughton), who seems to have
just rounded the corner into
teenhood, live with their
mother Mary (Dee Wallace),
because their father has run off
to Mexico with another wom
an. Mary has a loose, friendly
rapport with her kids and with

Michael's bicycle demon pals
(K.C. Martel, Sean Frye, Tom
Howell); they're very fond of
her but they know she'll let
them get away with murder.
Wallace makes Mary both ex
tremely appealing and child
ish-spacey enough so that we
can see why a grown man
might leave her. She's the kind
of mother who, nestled up
against the pillows of her
daughter's bed to read Peter
Pan to her, is as transported by
the story as Gertie'is — the kind
of mother who loves the idea
of Halloween so much that she
dresses up for it, too, even
though she's stuck at home
while the children go trick-or
treating.
Elliott is the first of the trio to
become acquainted with the
extra-terrestrial ("E.T." is their
name for him) who, terrified by
the enormous humans who
track through the tall grass af
ter him when his spaceship ac
cidentally abandons him, has
been camping out in the fami
ly's toolshed. (This chase, much
of which is shot from E.T.'s
point of view, is ingeniously ed
ited by Carol Littleton and
almost unbearably exciting; it's
such a riveting grabber that
fear that the rest of the movie
will be a disappointment. Such
fears are groundless.)
Spielberg handles the initial
encounter between these two
with delicate wit; somehow he
lets us feel both Elliott's fear
and E.T.'s. He achieves the
same effect again when Gertie
sees E.T. for the first time,
though the results are much
more explosive and much fun
nier.
To Gertie, who dresses him
up like one of her dolls, E.T. is
another marvel in a world still

new enough to be full of them,
but Elliott and Michael are old
enough to have acquired a cer
tain amount of suburban blase
and therefore to be truly
enchanted by their visitor. E.T.
brings out the best in the boys
— their sweetness and sensi
tivity and loyalty. In this most
benevolent of fantasies,
Spielberg and Mathison have
provided a kind world to
sheltertheiralien in, a world —
a child's world, of course —
that is ready to receive him.
There isn't a moment of cruelty
in the film (though there is a
great deal of suspense), and
Spielberg's vision is so over
whelming that he makes it dif
ficult for us to conceive of
cruelty while we are watching
the picture. E.T. taps into El
liott's feelings, establishing so
strong a bond that when E.T.
feels pain or fear, Elliott has an
immediate sympathetic re
sponse. E.T. enriches Elliott's
life beyond measure by accept
ing his love and, in return, ex
panding his capacity for love.
Spielberg uses his filmmaker's
magic to tap into our feelings,
and the result is a movie of ex
traordinary emotional power
culminating in one of the most
strangely moving denoue
ments a director has ever
brought off.
Indeed, Spielberg's gifts
have never been so richly in ev
idence before. I found Raiders
of the Lost Ark dismaying be
cause, for all the boys' adven
ture serial spirit it was
purported to possess, I
couldn't see any spirit in it at
all; coldly efficient and re
markably unimaginative, it
gave off bad vibes — as if
Spielberg hadn't really enjoyed

making it. E.T. has even more
warmth than Close Encounters
did, and it's even more lovingly
crafted. The direction and edit
ing and Allen Daviau's glorious
photography are so much of a
piece that you begin to wonder
if these three artists had the
same dreams. (The composer,
John Williams, whose high
pitched, string-heavy score is
imitation Bernard Herrmann,
clearly had different ones.) The
domestic scenes are easily the
best in any Spielberg movie;
the two boys are so wonderful
together that you can forgive
the cuteness of some of Drew
Barrymore's moments. There
are sequences — like the en
trance of the NASA team that
invades Mary's home in search
of E.T. — that are so cleverly as
sembled that it takes a while to
catch on to everything that's
happening, and Spielberg ap
pears to be discovering along
with us. Spielberg even re
deems his own worst ideas.
Wandering around the kitch
en, E.T. discovers beer and
takes some predictable low
comedy tumbles; the kicker is
that Elliott, in biology lab, gets a
sympathtic high and proceeds
to liberate every frog in the
room in the general spirit of
good will toward stranded
creatures.
E.T. himself is a beauty
Created by Carlo Rambaldi, he
has a kind of flattened frog
face, with huge, deep-eyes, and
when he becomes excited, he
stretches a long scaly neck and
emits a sound that is midway
between a gurgle and a purr.
He is diminutive but antique
looking, like Yoda in The Em
pire Strikes Back, and he has
the damnedest voice: he learns
how to speak English, and ev
ery time he repeats a word it
sounds more human without
losing its eerie alien quality.
Spielberg capitalizes on E.T.'s
resemblance to \oda in the
film's funniest scene. The boys
take him with them on Hallow
een — asa ploy to spirit him out
of the house under Mary's
watchful eyes (she is as yet un
aware of his existence) — and,
seeing a child in a Yoda cos
tume on the street, he tries to
follow him, crying, "Home!
Home!" What makes this mo
ment so delightful is

Spielberg's recognition that
E.T. is a fantastic filmmaker's
creation, like Yoda. In the same
vein, E.T. abounds with al
lusions to Star Wars and Star
Trek and The Twilight Zone, as
well as to The Wizard of Oz and
Peter Pan, which resonate
throughout the movie.
(Spielberg also refers to some
of his own pictures — Close En
counters, of course, and Jaws
and his first theatrical release,
The Sugarland Express.)UE.T. is
dedicated to one of Spielberg's
fellow fantasists more than any
other, it must be James Barrie:
this film is a rhapsody on the
themes of believing in fairies
and never growing up. The lat
ter is interpreted in the best
sense — the sense of retaining
the openness to experience,
the emotional intensity.and the
purity of heart of which, in the
view of directors like Steven
Spielberg and Carroll Ballard,
children are capable. There is a
great image late in the movie of
Michael asleep in a huge closet
full of toys and stuffed animals.
It perfectly expresses
Spielberg's unique brand of ro
manticism, and it explains the
sweetness of his best movies.

Poltergeist, on the other
hand, is not one of Spielberg's
best movies. Tobe Hooper is
credited with directing this
suburban haunted house pic
ture, but Spielberg — who co
produced, wrote the original
story, and worked on the script
with Michael Grais and Mark
Victor — apparently worked
out more of the storyboards
than Hooper did, closely su
pervised the production, and
may even have reshot some of
the scenes when he wasn't sat
isfied with Hooper's output. It
would be nice to be able to lay
the blame for the results on
Hooper, who directed The
Texas Chainsaw Massacre, and
perhaps the only offensive se
quence, involving a steak and
turkey leg infested with mag
gots, really does reflect
Hooper's style. But one certain
ly sees Spielberg's mark all over
the rest of the movie: In the set
ting, the domestic comedy
(which is wildly erratic: some
of it is quite inventive, some of
it worse than the worst parts of
Close Encounters and Jaws),

the focus on children, the un
failing optimism, the cracker
jack editing of the special ef
fects sequences (by Michael
Kahn, whose credits include
The Warriors and The Empire
Strikes Back). Some of the vis
ual gimmickry is pretty, and
there is one sequence
Spielberg can be pfoud of: the
first supernatural attack,
wherin a little boy is abducted
by a tree that crashes through
his bedroom window, has the
magical scariness of a first-rate
children's story. But on the
whole, Poltergeist leaves a
viewer feeling more zapped
than enchanted.
Perhaps something un
fortunate happens to Spielberg
when he makes a movie with
holograms; Poltergeist, like
Raiders, is not a warm ex
perience. The movie is terribly
efficient — it gets to you — but
I didn't have much fun at it. I
felt barraged by all the close
ups and the Dolby Sound from
the beginning, long before the
ghosts took over. This film is so
loud and so relentless through
out that it doesn't have any
where to go but straight to its
rather ludicrous bigfinish, with
skeletons popping up all over
the neighborhood and houses
flaming and folding.
Michael Kahn must have
dozed off during the non-fan
tasy portions of the picture, be
cause they are edited in
awkwardly, so that the movie
seems slightly off rhythm. The
dialogue doesn't help, and
neither does the uninspired
story. Like Close Encounters
and EJ„ Poltergeist revolves
around the relationship be
tween a child — in this case, a
beautiful blonde girl named
Carole Ann (Heather
O'Rourke) — and ultra-human
powers: she is kidnaped by
ghosts who also terrify her pa
rents, Diane and Steve (Jobeth
Williams and Craig T. Nelson)
and her brother Robbie (Oliver
Robins). Diane and Steve's ef
forts to reclaim their daughter
involve them with a para
psychologist (Beatrice
Straight), a tiny, squeaky
voiced spiritualist with a south
ern acent (Zelda Rubinstein),
and a great deal of technical
mystical mumbo-jumbo that is
far more complicated than the

narrative intended to support
it. When we aren't being over
powered by the effects, we are
being asked to carry a weighty
burden of credulity, once the
movie abandons the playful
tone of its early scenes and be
comes solemn. That may be
partly the effect of casting
Beatrice Straight, a long-time
graduate of the Geraldine Page
Twisted Mouth School of Act
ing, who carries a cloud over
her wherever she goes. But to
be perfectly fair, the ex
planatory cant the writers have
given the parapsychologist
seem tailor-made for an actress
of Straight's peculiarities.

The acting in Poltergeist is
not, however, without its
bright spots. Jobeth Williams,
who opened in New York in a
new play by John Guare a few
weeks before the film's pre
miere, is touchingly earnest as
the persistent loving mother,
and Zelda Rubinstein brings
such an unusual quicksilver
charm to her role that she near
ly redeems the most self-seri
ous scenes. She convinces us
that this strange little woman is
truly possessed of supernatural
knowledge and healing gifts;
for a few moments, she lifts a
mundane movie into the realm
of real magic.

imitation Bernard Herrmann,
clearly had different ones.) The
domestic scenes are easily the
best in any Spielberg movie;
the two boys are so wonderful
together that you can forgive
the cuteness of some of Drew
Barrymore's moments. There
are sequences — like the en
trance of the NASA team that
invades Mary's home in search
of E.T. — that are so cleverly as
sembled that it takes a while to
catch on to everything that's
happening, and Spielberg ap
pears to be discovering along
with us. Spielberg even re
deems his own worst ideas.
Wandering around the kitch
en, E.T. discovers beer and
takes some predictable low
comedy tumbles; the kicker is
that Elliott, in biology lab, gets a
sympathtic high and proceeds
to liberate every frog in the
room in the general spirit of
good will toward stranded
creatures.
E.T. himself is a beauty
Created by Carlo Rambaldi, he
has a kind of flattened frog
face, with huge, deep-eyes, and
when he becomes excited, he
stretches a long scaly neck and
emits a sound that is midway
between a gurgle and a purr.
He is diminutive but antique
looking, like Yoda in The Em
pire Strikes Back, and he has
the damnedest voice: he learns
how to speak English, and ev
ery time he repeats a word it
sounds more human without
losing its eerie alien quality.
Spielberg capitalizes on E.T.'s
resemblance to \oda in the
film's funniest scene. The boys
take him with them on Hallow
een — asa ploy to spirit him out
of the house under Mary's
watchful eyes (she is as yet un
aware of his existence) — and,
seeing a child in a Yoda cos
tume on the street, he tries to
follow him, crying, "Home!
Home!" What makes this mo
ment so delightful is

Spielberg's recognition that
E.T. is a fantastic filmmaker's
creation, like Yoda. In the same
vein, E.T. abounds with al
lusions to Star Wars and Star
Trek and The Twilight Zone, as
well as to The Wizard of Oz and
Peter Pan, which resonate
throughout the movie.
(Spielberg also refers to some
of his own pictures — Close En
counters, of course, and Jaws
and his first theatrical release,
The Sugarland Express.)UE.T. is
dedicated to one of Spielberg's
fellow fantasists more than any
other, it must be James Barrie:
this film is a rhapsody on the
themes of believing in fairies
and never growing up. The lat
ter is interpreted in the best
sense — the sense of retaining
the openness to experience,
the emotional intensity.and the
purity of heart of which, in the
view of directors like Steven
Spielberg and Carroll Ballard,
children are capable. There is a
great image late in the movie of
Michael asleep in a huge closet
full of toys and stuffed animals.
It perfectly expresses
Spielberg's unique brand of ro
manticism, and it explains the
sweetness of his best movies.

Poltergeist, on the other
hand, is not one of Spielberg's
best movies. Tobe Hooper is
credited with directing this
suburban haunted house pic
ture, but Spielberg — who co
produced, wrote the original
story, and worked on the script
with Michael Grais and Mark
Victor — apparently worked
out more of the storyboards
than Hooper did, closely su
pervised the production, and
may even have reshot some of
the scenes when he wasn't sat
isfied with Hooper's output. It
would be nice to be able to lay
the blame for the results on
Hooper, who directed The
Texas Chainsaw Massacre, and
perhaps the only offensive se
quence, involving a steak and
turkey leg infested with mag
gots, really does reflect
Hooper's style. But one certain
ly sees Spielberg's mark all over
the rest of the movie: In the set
ting, the domestic comedy
(which is wildly erratic: some
of it is quite inventive, some of
it worse than the worst parts of
Close Encounters and Jaws),

the focus on children, the un
failing optimism, the cracker
jack editing of the special ef
fects sequences (by Michael
Kahn, whose credits include
The Warriors and The Empire
Strikes Back). Some of the vis
ual gimmickry is pretty, and
there is one sequence
Spielberg can be pfoud of: the
first supernatural attack,
wherin a little boy is abducted
by a tree that crashes through
his bedroom window, has the
magical scariness of a first-rate
children's story. But on the
whole, Poltergeist leaves a
viewer feeling more zapped
than enchanted.
Perhaps something un
fortunate happens to Spielberg
when he makes a movie with
holograms; Poltergeist, like
Raiders, is not a warm ex
perience. The movie is terribly
efficient — it gets to you — but
I didn't have much fun at it. I
felt barraged by all the close
ups and the Dolby Sound from
the beginning, long before the
ghosts took over. This film is so
loud and so relentless through
out that it doesn't have any
where to go but straight to its
rather ludicrous bigfinish, with
skeletons popping up all over
the neighborhood and houses
flaming and folding.
Michael Kahn must have
dozed off during the non-fan
tasy portions of the picture, be
cause they are edited in
awkwardly, so that the movie
seems slightly off rhythm. The
dialogue doesn't help, and
neither does the uninspired
story. Like Close Encounters
and EJ„ Poltergeist revolves
around the relationship be
tween a child — in this case, a
beautiful blonde girl named
Carole Ann (Heather
O'Rourke) — and ultra-human
powers: she is kidnaped by
ghosts who also terrify her pa
rents, Diane and Steve (Jobeth
Williams and Craig T. Nelson)
and her brother Robbie (Oliver
Robins). Diane and Steve's ef
forts to reclaim their daughter
involve them with a para
psychologist (Beatrice
Straight), a tiny, squeaky
voiced spiritualist with a south
ern acent (Zelda Rubinstein),
and a great deal of technical
mystical mumbo-jumbo that is
far more complicated than the

narrative intended to support
it. When we aren't being over
powered by the effects, we are
being asked to carry a weighty
burden of credulity, once the
movie abandons the playful
tone of its early scenes and be
comes solemn. That may be
partly the effect of casting
Beatrice Straight, a long-time
graduate of the Geraldine Page
Twisted Mouth School of Act
ing, who carries a cloud over
her wherever she goes. But to
be perfectly fair, the ex
planatory cant the writers have
given the parapsychologist
seem tailor-made for an actress
of Straight's peculiarities.

The acting in Poltergeist is
not, however, without its
bright spots. Jobeth Williams,
who opened in New York in a
new play by John Guare a few
weeks before the film's pre
miere, is touchingly earnest as
the persistent loving mother,
and Zelda Rubinstein brings
such an unusual quicksilver
charm to her role that she near
ly redeems the most self-seri
ous scenes. She convinces us
that this strange little woman is
truly possessed of supernatural
knowledge and healing gifts;
for a few moments, she lifts a
mundane movie into the realm
of real magic.

The setting for the opening
scene of Steven Spielberg's E.T.
the Extra-Terrestrial is a fairy
tale sky full of stars that closely
resembles the one in Close En
counters of the Third Kind: it's
the kind of sky that spaceships
glide through on their way to
earth. E.T. begins where Close
Encounters peaked — with the
descent of an alien craft — and
gets better and better from
there. It's an absolutely entran
cing movie — a miracle; when
you walk out of the theater af
ter it's over, your visual sense of
whatever surrounds you is mys
teriously heightened for a
while, and you may feel as if
you've just been granted some
special grace.
The plot of the film is simple,
but Melissa Mathison's
screenplay invests the narrative
with clarity and a consistent vi
sion. Mathison worked on the
script for Carroll Ballard's The
Black Stallion, a wonderful
movie that shared with E.T. an
understanding of how children
regard the world, and a vivid
sense of the magical. In both
movies, the children blessed
with a special relationship to
the title characters have lost
fathers; both films offer emo
tional compensation to their
young protagonists. In E.T., El
liott (Henry Thomas), who is
about ten, his kid sister Gertie
(Drew Barrymore, of the Bar
rymores), and his brother
•Michael (Robert M a c -
Naughton), who seems to have
just rounded the corner into
teenhood, live with their
mother Mary (Dee Wallace),
because their father has run off
to Mexico with another wom
an. Mary has a loose, friendly
rapport with her kids and with

Michael's bicycle demon pals
(K.C. Martel, Sean Frye, Tom
Howell); they're very fond of
her but they know she'll let
them get away with murder.
Wallace makes Mary both ex
tremely appealing and child
ish-spacey enough so that we
can see why a grown man
might leave her. She's the kind
of mother who, nestled up
against the pillows of her
daughter's bed to read Peter
Pan to her, is as transported by
the story as Gertie'is — the kind
of mother who loves the idea
of Halloween so much that she
dresses up for it, too, even
though she's stuck at home
while the children go trick-or
treating.
Elliott is the first of the trio to
become acquainted with the
extra-terrestrial ("E.T." is their
name for him) who, terrified by
the enormous humans who
track through the tall grass af
ter him when his spaceship ac
cidentally abandons him, has
been camping out in the fami
ly's toolshed. (This chase, much
of which is shot from E.T.'s
point of view, is ingeniously ed
ited by Carol Littleton and
almost unbearably exciting; it's
such a riveting grabber that
fear that the rest of the movie
will be a disappointment. Such
fears are groundless.)
Spielberg handles the initial
encounter between these two
with delicate wit; somehow he
lets us feel both Elliott's fear
and E.T.'s. He achieves the
same effect again when Gertie
sees E.T. for the first time,
though the results are much
more explosive and much fun
nier.
To Gertie, who dresses him
up like one of her dolls, E.T. is
another marvel in a world still

new enough to be full of them,
but Elliott and Michael are old
enough to have acquired a cer
tain amount of suburban blase
and therefore to be truly
enchanted by their visitor. E.T.
brings out the best in the boys
— their sweetness and sensi
tivity and loyalty. In this most
benevolent of fantasies,
Spielberg and Mathison have
provided a kind world to
sheltertheiralien in, a world —
a child's world, of course —
that is ready to receive him.
There isn't a moment of cruelty
in the film (though there is a
great deal of suspense), and
Spielberg's vision is so over
whelming that he makes it dif
ficult for us to conceive of
cruelty while we are watching
the picture. E.T. taps into El
liott's feelings, establishing so
strong a bond that when E.T.
feels pain or fear, Elliott has an
immediate sympathetic re
sponse. E.T. enriches Elliott's
life beyond measure by accept
ing his love and, in return, ex
panding his capacity for love.
Spielberg uses his filmmaker's
magic to tap into our feelings,
and the result is a movie of ex
traordinary emotional power
culminating in one of the most
strangely moving denoue
ments a director has ever
brought off.
Indeed, Spielberg's gifts
have never been so richly in ev
idence before. I found Raiders
of the Lost Ark dismaying be
cause, for all the boys' adven
ture serial spirit it was
purported to possess, I
couldn't see any spirit in it at
all; coldly efficient and re
markably unimaginative, it
gave off bad vibes — as if
Spielberg hadn't really enjoyed

making it. E.T. has even more
warmth than Close Encounters
did, and it's even more lovingly
crafted. The direction and edit
ing and Allen Daviau's glorious
photography are so much of a
piece that you begin to wonder
if these three artists had the
same dreams. (The composer,
John Williams, whose high
pitched, string-heavy score is
imitation Bernard Herrmann,
clearly had different ones.) The
domestic scenes are easily the
best in any Spielberg movie;
the two boys are so wonderful
together that you can forgive
the cuteness of some of Drew
Barrymore's moments. There
are sequences — like the en
trance of the NASA team that
invades Mary's home in search
of E.T. — that are so cleverly as
sembled that it takes a while to
catch on to everything that's
happening, and Spielberg ap

Wandering around the kitch

takes some predictable low
comedy tumbles; the kicker is
that Elliott, in biology lab, gets a
sympathtic high and proceeds
to liberate every frog in the
room in the general spirit of
good will toward stranded
creatures.
E.T. himself is a beauty
Created by Carlo Rambaldi, he
has a kind of flattened frog
face, with huge, deep-eyes, and
when he becomes excited, he
stretches a long scaly neck and
emits a sound that is midway
between a gurgle and a purr.
He is diminutive but antique

story. Like Close Encounters
and EJ„ Poltergeist revolves
around the relationship be
tween a child — in this case, a
beautiful blonde girl named
Carole Ann (Heather
O'Rourke) — and ultra-human
powers: she is kidnaped by
ghosts who also terrify her pa
rents, Diane and Steve (Jobeth
Williams and Craig T. Nelson)
and her brother Robbie (Oliver
Robins). Diane and Steve's ef
forts to reclaim their daughter
involve them with a para
psychologist (Beatrice
Straight), a tiny, squeaky
voiced spiritualist with a south
ern acent (Zelda Rubinstein),
and a great deal of technical
mystical mumbo-jumbo that is
far more complicated than the

narrative intended to support
it. When we aren't being over
powered by the effects, we are
being asked to carry a weighty
burden of credulity, once the
movie abandons the playful
tone of its early scenes and be
comes solemn. That may be
partly the effect of casting
Beatrice Straight, a long-time
graduate of the Geraldine Page
Twisted Mouth School of Act
ing, who carries a cloud over
her wherever she goes. But to
be perfectly fair, the ex
planatory cant the writers have
given the parapsychologist
seem tailor-made for an actress
of Straight's peculiarities.

The acting in Poltergeist is
not, however, without its
bright spots. Jobeth Williams,
who opened in New York in a
new play by John Guare a few
weeks before the film's pre
miere, is touchingly earnest as
the persistent loving mother,
and Zelda Rubinstein brings
such an unusual quicksilver
charm to her role that she near
ly redeems the most self-seri
ous scenes. She convinces us
that this strange little woman is
truly possessed of supernatural
knowledge and healing gifts;
for a few moments, she lifts a
mundane movie into the realm
of real magic.

The setting for the opening
scene of Steven Spielberg's E.T.
the Extra-Terrestrial is a fairy
tale sky full of stars that closely
resembles the one in Close En
counters of the Third Kind: it's
the kind of sky that spaceships
glide through on their way to
earth. E.T. begins where Close
Encounters peaked — with the
descent of an alien craft — and
gets better and better from
there. It's an absolutely entran
cing movie — a miracle; when
you walk out of the theater af
ter it's over, your visual sense of
whatever surrounds you is mys
teriously heightened for a
while, and you may feel as if
you've just been granted some
special grace.
The plot of the film is simple,
but Melissa Mathison's
screenplay invests the narrative
with clarity and a consistent vi
sion. Mathison worked on the
script for Carroll Ballard's The
Black Stallion, a wonderful
movie that shared with E.T. an
understanding of how children
regard the world, and a vivid
sense of the magical. In both
movies, the children blessed
with a special relationship to
the title characters have lost
fathers; both films offer emo
tional compensation to their
young protagonists. In E.T., El
liott (Henry Thomas), who is
about ten, his kid sister Gertie
(Drew Barrymore, of the Bar
rymores), and his brother
•Michael (Robert M a c -
Naughton), who seems to have
just rounded the corner into
teenhood, live with their
mother Mary (Dee Wallace),
because their father has run off
to Mexico with another wom
an. Mary has a loose, friendly
rapport with her kids and with

Michael's bicycle demon pals
(K.C. Martel, Sean Frye, Tom
Howell); they're very fond of
her but they know she'll let
them get away with murder.
Wallace makes Mary both ex
tremely appealing and child
ish-spacey enough so that we
can see why a grown man
might leave her. She's the kind
of mother who, nestled up
against the pillows of her
daughter's bed to read Peter
Pan to her, is as transported by
the story as Gertie'is — the kind
of mother who loves the idea
of Halloween so much that she
dresses up for it, too, even
though she's stuck at home
while the children go trick-or
treating.
Elliott is the first of the trio to
become acquainted with the
extra-terrestrial ("E.T." is their
name for him) who, terrified by
the enormous humans who
track through the tall grass af
ter him when his spaceship ac
cidentally abandons him, has
been camping out in the fami
ly's toolshed. (This chase, much
of which is shot from E.T.'s
point of view, is ingeniously ed
ited by Carol Littleton and
almost unbearably exciting; it's
such a riveting grabber that
fear that the rest of the movie
will be a disappointment. Such
fears are groundless.)
Spielberg handles the initial
encounter between these two
with delicate wit; somehow he
lets us feel both Elliott's fear
and E.T.'s. He achieves the
same effect again when Gertie
sees E.T. for the first time,
though the results are much
more explosive and much fun
nier.
To Gertie, who dresses him
up like one of her dolls, E.T. is
another marvel in a world still

new enough to be full of them,
but Elliott and Michael are old
enough to have acquired a cer
tain amount of suburban blase
and therefore to be truly
enchanted by their visitor. E.T.
brings out the best in the boys
— their sweetness and sensi
tivity and loyalty. In this most
benevolent of fantasies,
Spielberg and Mathison have
provided a kind world to
sheltertheiralien in, a world —
a child's world, of course —
that is ready to receive him.
There isn't a moment of cruelty
in the film (though there is a
great deal of suspense), and
Spielberg's vision is so over
whelming that he makes it dif
ficult for us to conceive of
cruelty while we are watching
the picture. E.T. taps into El
liott's feelings, establishing so
strong a bond that when E.T.
feels pain or fear, Elliott has an
immediate sympathetic re
sponse. E.T. enriches Elliott's
life beyond measure by accept
ing his love and, in return, ex
panding his capacity for love.
Spielberg uses his filmmaker's
magic to tap into our feelings,
and the result is a movie of ex
traordinary emotional power
culminating in one of the most
strangely moving denoue
ments a director has ever
brought off.
Indeed, Spielberg's gifts
have never been so richly in ev
idence before. I found Raiders
of the Lost Ark dismaying be
cause, for all the boys' adven
ture serial spirit it was
purported to possess, I
couldn't see any spirit in it at
all; coldly efficient and re
markably unimaginative, it
gave off bad vibes — as if
Spielberg hadn't really enjoyed

making it. E.T. has even more
warmth than Close Encounters
did, and it's even more lovingly
crafted. The direction and edit
ing and Allen Daviau's glorious
photography are so much of a
piece that you begin to wonder
if these three artists had the
same dreams. (The composer,
John Williams, whose high
pitched, string-heavy score is
imitation Bernard Herrmann,
clearly had different ones.) The
domestic scenes are easily the
best in any Spielberg movie;
the two boys are so wonderful
together that you can forgive
the cuteness of some of Drew
Barrymore's moments. There
are sequences — like the en
trance of the NASA team that
invades Mary's home in search
of E.T. — that are so cleverly as
sembled that it takes a while to
catch on to everything that's
happening, and Spielberg ap
pears to be discovering along
with us. Spielberg even re
deems his own worst ideas.
Wandering around the kitch
en, E.T. discovers beer and
takes some predictable low
comedy tumbles; the kicker is
that Elliott, in biology lab, gets a
sympathtic high and proceeds
to liberate every frog in the
room in the general spirit of
good will toward stranded
creatures.
E.T. himself is a beauty
Created by Carlo Rambaldi, he
has a kind of flattened frog
face, with huge, deep-eyes, and
when he becomes excited, he
stretches a long scaly neck and
emits a sound that is midway
between a gurgle and a purr.
He is diminutive but antique
looking, like Yoda in The Em
pire Strikes Back, and he has
the damnedest voice: he learns
how to speak English, and ev
ery time he repeats a word it
sounds more human without
losing its eerie alien quality.
Spielberg capitalizes on E.T.'s
resemblance to \oda in the
film's funniest scene. The boys
take him with them on Hallow
een — asa ploy to spirit him out
of the house under Mary's
watchful eyes (she is as yet un
aware of his existence) — and,
seeing a child in a Yoda cos
tume on the street, he tries to
follow him, crying, "Home!
Home!" What makes this mo
ment so delightful is

Spielberg's recognition that
E.T. is a fantastic filmmaker's
creation, like Yoda. In the same
vein, E.T. abounds with al
lusions to Star Wars and Star
Trek and The Twilight Zone, as
well as to The Wizard of Oz and
Peter Pan, which resonate
throughout the movie.
(Spielberg also refers to some
of his own pictures — Close En
counters, of course, and Jaws
and his first theatrical release,
The Sugarland Express.)UE.T. is
dedicated to one of Spielberg's
fellow fantasists more than any
other, it must be James Barrie:
this film is a rhapsody on the
themes of believing in fairies
and never growing up. The lat
ter is interpreted in the best
sense — the sense of retaining
the openness to experience,
the emotional intensity.and the
purity of heart of which, in the
view of directors like Steven
Spielberg and Carroll Ballard,
children are capable. There is a
great image late in the movie of
Michael asleep in a huge closet
full of toys and stuffed animals.
It perfectly expresses
Spielberg's unique brand of ro
manticism, and it explains the
sweetness of his best movies.

Poltergeist, on the other
hand, is not one of Spielberg's
best movies. Tobe Hooper is
credited with directing this
suburban haunted house pic
ture, but Spielberg — who co
produced, wrote the original
story, and worked on the script
with Michael Grais and Mark
Victor — apparently worked
out more of the storyboards
than Hooper did, closely su
pervised the production, and
may even have reshot some of
the scenes when he wasn't sat
isfied with Hooper's output. It
would be nice to be able to lay
the blame for the results on
Hooper, who directed The
Texas Chainsaw Massacre, and
perhaps the only offensive se
quence, involving a steak and
turkey leg infested with mag
gots, really does reflect
Hooper's style. But one certain
ly sees Spielberg's mark all over
the rest of the movie: In the set
ting, the domestic comedy
(which is wildly erratic: some
of it is quite inventive, some of
it worse than the worst parts of
Close Encounters and Jaws),

the focus on children, the un
failing optimism, the cracker
jack editing of the special ef
fects sequences (by Michael
Kahn, whose credits include
The Warriors and The Empire
Strikes Back). Some of the vis
ual gimmickry is pretty, and
there is one sequence
Spielberg can be pfoud of: the
first supernatural attack,
wherin a little boy is abducted
by a tree that crashes through
his bedroom window, has the
magical scariness of a first-rate
children's story. But on the
whole, Poltergeist leaves a
viewer feeling more zapped
than enchanted.
Perhaps something un
fortunate happens to Spielberg
when he makes a movie with
holograms; Poltergeist, like
Raiders, is not a warm ex
perience. The movie is terribly
efficient — it gets to you — but
I didn't have much fun at it. I
felt barraged by all the close
ups and the Dolby Sound from
the beginning, long before the
ghosts took over. This film is so
loud and so relentless through
out that it doesn't have any
where to go but straight to its
rather ludicrous bigfinish, with
skeletons popping up all over
the neighborhood and houses
flaming and folding.
Michael Kahn must have
dozed off during the non-fan
tasy portions of the picture, be
cause they are edited in
awkwardly, so that the movie
seems slightly off rhythm. The
dialogue doesn't help, and
neither does the uninspired
story. Like Close Encounters
and EJ„ Poltergeist revolves
around the relationship be
tween a child — in this case, a
beautiful blonde girl named
Carole Ann (Heather

and her brother Robbie (Oliver

forts to reclaim their daughter
