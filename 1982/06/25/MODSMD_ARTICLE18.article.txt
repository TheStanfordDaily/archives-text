# Chic 'Diva' is self-consciously entertaining
## 
### Steve Vineberg 
The high-tech chic of Diva,
directed by Jean-Jacques Beinix
and shot by Philippe Rousselot,
is dazzling; all the surfaces glit
ter. I haven't seen such a Ver
sailles of a movie since Barocco,
by Beinix's fellow countryman
Andre Techine — and Diva, lack
ing Barocco's opacity and ex
istential angst about identity, is
much more fun. Beinix's chief
virtue, aside from his deftness, is
his determination not to take
himself seriously; the witty, free
wheeling way in which he has
put the picture together, making
his camera double back on itself
with tantalizing self-conscious
ness, seems to be based on the
careless assumption that this lit
tle thriller is inconsequential.
You can't complain that Diva
doesn't mean anything, because
Beinix's style and the weightless,
hollow shimmer of Hilton Mc-
Connico's interior designs de
clare it in every frame. Of
course, in Diva style is content.
Like Techine, 'Beinix works
through a memory bank of older
movies, and bits and pieces of
Children of Paradise, The Seven
Year Itch, Citizen Kane, The
Trial, The French Connection,
etc. show up in amusingly al
tered form in Diva. It's an
energized junkyard of a movie in
which all the pop scraps set each
other in motion in startling ways,
as in a Rube Goldberg contrap
tion — and the scraps represent
other worlds beside the movies.
An incidental character named
Lindbergh owns a cat named
Ayatollah; a pair of hoods, one
with hair slicked back like a
parody of a Hollywood bad guy,
and the other sporting a punk

haircut and patent leather boots,
stalk the streets of Paris armed
with ice picks. The hero, Jules
(Frederic Andrei), a young
mailman on a moped, has a soft,
feminine face and a slender,
flaccid body; naive and im
pressionable, he recalls the Jean-
Pierre Leaud of the middle and
late '60s, and when he plays a
scene with Alba (Thuy An Luu), a
gorgeous Vietnamese adoles
cent who slips stolen records
into her portfolio with the un
flappable cool of a Godard
gamine, you think of La
Chinoise. Though it's far from
experimental, Diva contains se
quences that suggest Godard at
his most playful, like a scene in
which Jules and Alba "share" the
experience of a piece of music
by listening to it on separate sets
of headphones. (The alienation
joke might beGodard's.)
Jules is enamored of a black
opera singer, Cynthia Hawkins
(Wilhelminia Wiggins
Fernandez); unbeknownst to
her, he owns a pirated tape of
one of her concerts — a singular
prize since she has never re
leased a record, believing that
music should be "an exceptional
moment for the singer and the
auditor — a unique ex
perience." But one night Jules'
home, a loft full of wrecked cars
and murals of cars, is ransacked
and the tape stolen. (The scene
he returns to — tape strung
about the room and a program
from a Cynthia Hawkins concert
spinning on his turntable — has
the extraordinary richness of a
Bertolucci image.) Beinix and
Jean Van Hamme, who together
adapted the script from a novel
by Delacorta, provide a second

tape, too: an expose by the mis
tress of a vice chief, which she
slips into the basket ot Jules'
moped before she is ice-picked
to death outside a cafe. The
doubling of tapes is not only in
genious in narrative terms; it
also sets up the film's funniest
moment. (Perhaps Beinix was
thinking of the hilarious mix-ups
in Bringing Up Baby, with its twin
leopards, when he structured
some of Diva.) In fact, doubling
seems to be the motif in this
movie: there is a black whore to
mirror Cynthia Hawkins, a pair
of Taiwanese underworld types
to mirror not only the punks but
also the coyly named Alba
("white" in a number of lan

guages), and two marvelous car
chases that, in a curious way,
mirror each other. (In the first,
Jules, on his moped, can be far
more flexible than his pursuers
and eludes them; in the second,
he is on foot and therefore at a
distinct disadvantage.) And the
tapes can be seen as a form of
mirror, as well. At the end of the
film, Jules presents Cynthia with
the illegal tape he made of her,
allowing her to listen to her own
voice for the first time in her life;
he brings her the gift of self-con
sciousness.
At first, Jules' loft reminded
me of the body shop where
Frederic Forrest worked in One
from the Heart, and in a sense

Diva and One from the Heart are
souvenirs from the same fan
tasyland. The difference is that
Diva doesn't come off looking
like self-indulgence; Beinix,
who has a cunning editorial
sense, works with his audience
in mind, as Coppola doesn't
seem to do these days. Beinix
doesn't stay locked up in the pop
playground from which he
draws inspiration; he brings out
the parts that he thinks will de
light us the most. There's a quali
ty of show and tell to this movie,
even though it moves fast (to a
terrific jazzy score by Vladimir
Cosma), and Beinix's eye for col
lage isn't quite like any other di-
