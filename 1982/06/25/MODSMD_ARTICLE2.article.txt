# Row Office impounds bicycles
## 
### Bill Ainsworth 
As part of a campus-wide ef
fort to remove bikes presumed
abandoned, last week Housing
Office employees removed bi
cycles around the Row Houses
that were not locked to a rack
or a tree, according to Heloisa
Edwards, manager of row facil
ities and services.
Edwards said bikes that were
chained to a tree or a rack were
tagged with a notice warning
owners that the bikes would be
impounded within 10 days if
not moved. Another check will
be made later in the summer to
remove any remaining tagged
bikes, she added.
According to Edwards, be
tween 200 and 300 bikes have
been impounded from the
Row and are being stored in an
undisclosed location on cam
pus.
Students residing in the Row
Houses were warned at the end
of spring quarter, through in
formation given out at house
meetings and through posted
signs, that any unclaimed bikes'
would be impounded after 10
days, Edwards said.
Because of a lack of man
power, last year the Housing
Office did not actively im
pound bikes, Edwards said, al
though some bikes were im
pounded by the University Po
lice Department. As a result of
the failure to remove bikes last
year "we lost tons of them,"
said Edwards. "This year I said
I'd better get my hands on
them and store them before

they disappear."
According to Capt. Raoul
Niemeyer of the University Po
lice, -the University has been
following a policy of impound
ing abandoned bikes since
before 1977. In the past the
bikes had been held until the
end of summer when they
were turned over to the Santa
Clara County Sheriff's Depart
ment.
If at any time during the sum
mer a bike owner claims his
bike by giving a description of
it and offering some proof of
ownership, the bike is given
back to the student, Niemeyer
said.
Before they turn the bikes
over to the Sheriff's Depart
ment, Niemeyer said that his
office makes an effort to locate
the bike's owner. He called
this " a very time-consuming
process."
Niemeyer advised students
who have had their bike re
moved from a location near
their residence to contact their
residence office and find out
where they can claim their
bike.
Since the program began,
Niemeyer said that no student
has left a bike out over the
summer that he has later tried
to claim in the fall from the po
lice. "Most of the bikes we end
up turning over are In real bad
shape," he said.
In addition to actively im
pounding bikes, Edwards has
some new ideas about dispos
ing .of hikei taken .from -the

Row. But she said she is unsure
which, if any, of these ideas will
be approved by the.University.
One of her ideas is to hold
the bikes until the fall, at which
time she proposes holding a
bike fair at which students
could claim their bikes and un
claimed bikes could be auc
tioned off.
She also hopes to be able to
charge students $10 for han
dling and storage costs for
bikes taken from the Row and
to use the funds collected from
this charge to refurbish Row
Houses.
