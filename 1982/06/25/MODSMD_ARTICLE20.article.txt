When my friend and I entered Monique, we had three
surprises: the hostess, Michelle, was a classmate of mine;
the sight of the dessert cart had me drooling before we
were seated; and the restaurant is not at all what one
would expect. Judging by the location, it appears to be
part of the curious Cardinal Hotel, which, fortunately, it
is not. Instead we walked out of the bustle of Hamilton
Avenue into the unpretentious calm of Monique.
We waited a few minutes before being led to our table
— a bit small, but in tone with the cozy atmosphere. The
hostess brought the menu and stayed to supplement it,

because it gives only a general idea of what is available.
She named and explained the main dish specials, the
types of soups, crepes, omelettes and quiches. At first, it
was a bit disconcerting to deal with such a sketchy menu,
but I eventually realized that the best way to assure fresh
ness and quality — without having to print new menus
daily — is Monique's way.
I'm a great fan of baguettes and of butter sculpture,
and enjoyed both while Jeff perused the wine list. The
selection of wines is uncommonly well done, with partic
ular attention given to the small California wineries that
Denis, Monique's son, visits regularly.
We decided on an excellent chardonnay ($l3), recom
mended by the waitress. She even suggested that we
keep it cold in a bucket, brought promptly with the wine
(a first in the restaurants that I have visited in this area).
Jeff, my lunch partner, ordered the pate Monique, wa

iercress soup, poached salmon, a raspberry genoise and
capuccino. I had salmon mousse, soup, chicken in wine
and the same raspberry cake with a cup of coffee.
Jeff thought the pate had an odd texture (too much
like meat loaf) but he seemed to enjoy it. And although
the waitress brought him smoked salmon instead of the
poached salmon he ordered, he liked it and we both
raved over the raspberry masterpiece. It so happened
that Denis had recently returned from a farm where he
had selected the raspberries. Incidentally, Denis pre
pared everything on the impressive dessert cart. My
mousse was sensational. A lady at the table next to us in
quired about the mousse and I replied by offering her a
taste. She liked it, too. My chicken dish was very good:
tender, attractively garnished, with well seasoned (but a
bit overcooked) white beans, carrots and zucchini.
