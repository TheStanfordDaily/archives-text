Navy stages American evacuation
Washington — As Israeli military leaders anguished
over whether to storm West Beirut as all attempts to hon
or cease-fires in Lebanon appear to collapse, the U.S.
Navy began evacuating Americans from Lebanon yester
day in an operation described by a Defense Department
spokesman as "going smoothly."
This was the first U.S. naval evacuation of Americans
from Lebanon since the 1976 civil war there.
Henry Catto, the Pentagon spokesman, told reporters
the evacuation began about 7:30 a.m. EDT and was ex
pected to be completed before the end of the day."The
last I heard, things were peaceful and going smoothly,"
he said.
Two Navy amphibious ships, the Nashville and the
Hermitage, were assigned to send landing craft ashore at
the port of Jounieh, north of Beirut, to pick up evacuees
and transport them to Cyprus, Catto said.
Asked how many Americans will be taken out from
Lebanon, Catto said the Pentagon did not know, al
though he said they might number as many as 4000.
Citizens of other nations carrying what Catto de
scribed as "proper documents" certified by their em
bassies also will be evacuated by the U.S. Navy.
Reagan vetoes housing subsidy bill
Washington — President Ronald Reagan yesterday
vetoed an emergency money bill containing housing
subsidies for low- and middle-income home buyers,
charging that Congress is not serious about controlling
federal spending.
Less than two hours later, Reagan's veto was sustained
by the House. The vote was 253-171 in favor of overrid
ing, but fell 17 short of the two-thirds margin required.
It takes a two-thirds majority of both the House and
the Senate to override a presidential veto.
The House then began considering a new bill that con
tained every element of the vetoed version except for
the housing subsidies. Like the failed measure, the new
one would repeal a $75-per-day tax deduction that Con
gress voted itself last year.
Although Reagan criticized several features of the $8.9
billion bill in casting the fifth veto of his administration,
he concentrated on the housing provision.
Reagan said he was concerned that the measure would
"add to the federal deficit and generate upward pres
sures on interest rates — aggravating the very situation it
seeks to help."
Anticipating the veto, Democratic leaders accused
Reagan at a news conference of turning his back on the
depressed housing industry.
Handgun intiative makes ballot
Sacramento — An initiative that would ban new hand
gun sales in May 1983 has qualified for the November
ballot, placing the gun control issue before California
voters for the first time, Secretary of State March Fong Eu
said vesterday.
She said the legally required random sample count of
petition signatures projected a total of 427,474 valid sig
natures of registered voters, more than 40,000 above the
total needed to avoid a full signature count.
The proponents of the initiative, John Phillips of Los
Angeles and Victor Palmieri of San Francisco, submitted
568,867 signatures last month.
The measure is sponsored by gun-control groups and
backed by Gov. Edmund Brown. Anti-gun-control forces
led by Sen. H.L. Richardson (R-Arcadia), have already
begun raising money to defeat it.
The initiative would limit the total number of con
cealable guns in California to those already in circulation

next April 30, so that handguns could not be brought
into the state after that.
It also would require registration of all handguns with
the state attorney general by Nov. 2,1983. Another pro
vision would prevent the legislature from passing any
laws to take handguns away from law-abiding citizens.
Eu said the only previous gun-control initiative
proposed in California failed to qualify for the ballot in
1976.
Frenchman orbits with cosmonauts
Moscow — French astronaut Jean-Loup Chretien be
came the first Western European to fly in space yesterday
when he rode into orbit with a Soviet crew aboard a
Soyuz T-6 spacecraft.
Chretien and cosmonauts Vladimir Dzhanebikov and
Alexander Ivanchenkov plan to rendezvous today with
the Salyut-7 orbiting space station, where two other So
viet cosmonauts have been living since May 13.
The international launch was the 10th in the "In
tercosmos" series, in which the Soviets have been joined
by foreign pilots on space voyages. All of the previous
missions have involved pilots from other communist na
tions.
The launch was the second that Soviet authorities have
televised live in the 20 years of manned space explora
tion from the Soviet Union. The first was the Apollo-
Soyuz mission in 1975, in which American and Soviet
space capsules docked in orbit.
The launch telecast, which occurred in prime-time
evening hours in both France and the Soviet Union, in
cluded a measure of political rhetoric in addition to the
sight of the fiery rocket blasting off into a dark evening
sky from the cosmodrome at Baikonur.
The telecast showed Chretien arriving at the launch
site, blowing a kiss at the assembled Soviet and French
technicians.
Just before the launch, viewers saw mission com
mander Dzhanibekov, inside the spacecraft, deliver a
brief speech in which he said he was certain the flight
"will serve the future development of the science and
technology of our two countries and strengthen the
friendship between the Soviet and the French peoples."
French and Soviet scientists have been cooperating on
space research since 1966. At a Kremlin meeting in 1979,
Soviet President Leonid Brezhnev invited former French
President Valery Giscard d'Estaing to arrange a joint
manned flight.
Franco-Soviet relations have cooled since Giscard lost
the French presidency, and the Socialist government of
Francois Mitterrand appears apprehensive over the pos
sible political fallout.
Budget approved, awaits passage
Sacramento — The Legislature's budget-writing com
mittee approved a nearly $26 billion state budget yester
day with no new money for schools, an omission that a
Republican leader said would block passage.
But Senate leaders said later that $100 million might be
found for schools in a companion bill, half of which
would depend on the economy improving.
The 5-1 vote by the budget conference committee
sent to the Assembly and Senate floors a compromise
spending proposal for the fiscal year that begins july 1.
The two houses were expected to vote today.
But Assemblyman Charles Imbrecht (R-Ventura), the
lone dissenter, said he thought there would be no As
sembly Republican votes for the proposal.
He called the school funding freeze "a very ir
responsible action in failing to provide for the future of
the state's children."
The budget, like any bill that spends money, needs a

two-thirds vote in both houses. Democrats havei
jorities in both houses, but not the 54 votes neededin
80-member Assembly nor the 27 votes in the 40-men
Senate.
The committee action came after days of meet
among Senate and Assembly Republicans and De
crats, along with Democratic Gov. Edmund Brown,(
cipally on the issue of school funding.
Assembly Republicans insisted on some extra mc
for the state's 1100 school districts, which will getai
of $8 billion in state money next year.
But Imbrecht blaimed Senate Democrats, aidec
Senate Republicans, for just as stubbornly insistingoi
funding increases for any programs.
