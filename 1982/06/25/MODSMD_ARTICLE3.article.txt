# Kennedy seeks new director for Office of Development
## 
### 
A committee is currently ac
tively searching for a new di
rector of the Office of De
velopment to replace Univer
sity vice-president Joel Smith,
who resigned from the posi
tion in early June.
The committee, chaired by
President Donald Kennedy,
will try to appoint a permanent
director before the end of
1982. In the interim the Office
of Development, which is re
sponsible for the University's
extensive fund-raising opera
tions, will be run by Bruce
Hinchliffe.
Hinchliffe, who was formerly

the director of corporate rela
tions, has been with the Office
of Development since 1963.
Previously he served for four
years as director of the Stan
ford Annual Fund, and was as
sociate director and chairman
of the executive committee of
the successful $300 million
Campaign for Stanford.
Kennedy said, "I am de
lighted that Bruce Hinchliffe
has agreed to serve as acting
vice-president. He has proven
his effectiveness in virtually all
areas of fundraising and he is
also an effective administrator
and a good leader/'
