## Vodka a problem in Poland 
### Los Angeles Times 
Warsaw— For the last year,
vodka has been rationed in Po
land. touching off a wave of or
ganized crime involving
bootlegging, moonshining and
other activities that are being
likened to Prohibition-era be
havior in the United States.
Concern over the problem
has prompted second thoughts
about the desirability of ration
ing as growing numbers of
Poles turn to illegal sources of
liquor to supplement their ra
tions.
Anyone 18 or older can buy
half a liter of vokda a month,
which is about half of what av
erage per-capita consumption
is thought to have been before
rationing took effect.
Rationing was introduced
last year in an effort to reduce
alcoholism — Poland reputed
ly has the highest per-capita
consumption of hard liquor in
the world — and to limit the
use of scarce grain and

potatoes in the manufacture of
vodka.
The newspaper S/owo Pow
szechne recently reported that
the police are concerned over
what it said is likely to be the
most dangerous result of vodka
rationing.
"There is the likelihood that
once the prohibition is lifted,
the criminal activities may con
tinue in other spheres," the
newpaper said.
The newspaper noted that
there was illegal traffic in vodka
long before rationing but that
this was generally for personal
consumption. Rationing, the
newspaper added, has led to
the emergence of "a complete
ly new form of crime — mass
selling of alcohol outside the
rationing system, by organized
gangs."
In assessing what it called the
"negative phenomena" of
vodka rationing S/owo Pow-
Szechne said that health author
ities have noted a rise in

poisonings resulting from the
drinking of cleaning fluid, au
tomobile antifreeze and cer
tain cosmetics as substitutes for
vodka.
, It said that the limited avail
ability of vodka under ration
ing has led some people to try
narcotics. According to health
authorities, the use of heroin
produced from home-grown
poppies is indeed on the rise.
The paper said that rationing
has also meant a "further im
poverishment" of the families
of alcoholics because the price
of black-market vodka has
been driven up.
A government bill proposed
in Parliament would restrict the
number of outlets selling
vodka and other alcoholic
beverages, impose prison
terms of up to two years on
managers who permit drinking
on the job, ban alcohol sales at
sports and certain other public
events and increase the legal
price of vodka.
