side" with government troops
battling guerrillas, CBS News
said Wednesday night.
The networkquoted uniden
tified Salvadoran soldiers as
saying that on Tuesday advisers
"were firing 81mm mortars
against a rebel base" near a
government camp along the
Lempa River, about 45 miles
southeast of San Salvador.
CBS added that it was told by
the Salvadoran troops that
"there are 10 Americans based
at the camp, and they are tak
ing part in combat operations"
and carrying M-16 rifles.

weapons larger than pistols

and restrict M-16s to quarters

mobiles outside San Salvador.
The guidelines prohibit the
stationing of advisers in areas
of heavy rebel concentration
or anyplace where combat is
likely. The guidelines state that
if a firefight develops between
rival Salvadoran forces, ad

An embassy spokesman who

night that Ambassador Deane
R. Hinton had ordered an in

Gary Shephard of CBS and
Ray Bonner of the New York
Times said they had seen the
