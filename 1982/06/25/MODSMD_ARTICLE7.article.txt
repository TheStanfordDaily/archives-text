# The 						war in Lebanon: can there be winners?

Beirut — With Israel poised to
attack West Beirut, the United
States seems close to achieving
major Middle East policy goals
but is on the verge of com
promising its long-term national
interests and those of its mod
erate Arab friends.

News Analysis

The seeming paradox stems
from an open American unwill
ingness to rein in the Israelis in
time to prevent their invasion
from dissipating their clear suc
cesses and sowing the seeds of
future regional turmoil.
So far the Israelis have served
American interests in humil
iating the Soviets, who not only
provided the Syrians with in
ferior weaponry but also failed
to play a superpower role in the
defense of either their Syrian or
Palestinian friends.
Equally, the invasion has cut
down to size the recently seem
ingly triumphant march of mili
tant Islam, symbolized by the
battlefield victories of Iran's Is
lamic revolution against Iraq.
Some enthusiasts even argue
that an overall Middle East peace
process could move ahead fol
lowing events of the past several
weeks and that Lebanon could
be put back together. That re

portedly was the message given
by President Ronald Reagan and
Secretary of State Alexander
Haig to Israeli Prime Minister
Menachem Begin in Washing
ton this week, when they ap
parently said that Washington
had no disagreement with what
Israel was doing in Lebanon but
wanted some movement now in
"the peace process."
But Western diplomats and
Arab analysts suggest that the
United States and its moderate
allies will end up paying the
heaviest part of the bill in the af
termath unless a way is found to
deal with Yasser Arafat and his
Palestine Liberation Organiza
tion, which seems increasingly
unlikely — and unless a way is
found to save West Beirut from
Israeli ground attack.
If Arafat feels obliged to die
fighting to keep the the Palesti
nian cause alive for the future,
the Arab world seems sure to
seize upon his martyrdom as a
perfidy specifically committed
by the Americans in arming and
encouraging the Israelis. Arafat
himself already has expressed
this idea.
Palestinian terrorism, whose
destruction the Israelis have in
voked as a goal to justify the in
vasion, is then likely to blossom
as never before, uncontrolled
and uncontrollable against

American as well as Israeli
targets. Palestinian moderates
say an indiscriminate assault on
West Beirut will result in ev
erybody but the terrorists being
killed.
Those who suggest that the Is
raelis would be satisfied with
capturing the Palestinian camps
— especially Sabra, which is the
nearest thing that the landless
Palestinians have to a capital —
assume that the Palestinian guer
rillas and their Lebanese allies in
side the city proper would sur
render. The probability, how
ever, is that the guerrillas would
keep on shooting, and the Israel
is would use planes, artillery and
tanks to dislodge them block by
block, street by street.
Responsible Lebanese politi
cians think that reconstructing
this tormented country, a major
aim proclaimed by Israel and the
United States in this war, would
be impossible for years to come
in the wake of bitterness left by
more Moslem dead and the
Christian Phalangist militia's de
facto alliance with Israel. And

the United States would be
tagged with responsibility for
that nation-rebuilding aspect of
the invasion.
Embarked on a muscular show
of strength toward its Arab
neighbors, Israel seems to be ac
cording little priority to such
considerations. American of
ficials in the region and in Wash
ington have at times suggested
that, on the contrary, Israel has
systematically sought to frustrate
U.S. relationships with moderate
Arab regimes such as Jordan and
Saudi Arabia and prefers to be
confronted in the region by
more radical regimes that can
not look to Washington for any
support.
Thus, radicalization of the re
gion does not appear at this
stage to be a major deterrent for
Israel. But potentially high casu
alties inherent in street fighting
have served as a brake in delay
ing the ground assault against
West Beirut.
Israeli statements have made it
clear that Jerusalem would pre
fer to use its overwhelming mili

tary presence to force the
Palestinians and their Lebanese
allies into unconditional sur
render without having to resort
to such a potentially costly at
tack.
But the complexities of Leba
nese politics appear so far to
have been more intractable than
military problems for the Israelis.
It is now 10 days since Israeli
Defense Minister Ariel Sharon
led his troops into Baabda, the
seat of the last remnant of Leba
nese sovereignty.
The Israelis have sought to in
corporate their Maronite Chris
tian militia ally, the Phalangists,
into the battle, and prod the
Christians into finishing off the
Palestinians for them. The
Phalangists have resisted that
temptation.
Paradoxically, many Lebanese
recognize that without the Is
raeli military pressure, there is
little chance of forcing change in
the Lebanese political scene,
with its hatreds and pettiness en
crusted after more than seven
years of violence.
