Tehran â€” Iran will send a large
portion of its forces to Lebanon
when the Iran-Iraq war is over,
to "resolve the question of the
war against Israel," President Ali
Khamenei said Wednesday.
Khamenei, quoted by Iranian
radio, was speaking after a meet
ing of the Higher Defense Coun
cil, called to consider Iraq's
statement that it had begun
withdrawing its troops from Iran.
When the question of the war
with Iraq was resolved, he said,
Iran would transfer "a large
part" of its forces to Lebanon.
"Our revolution will not see
complete victory without under
taking actions in occupied

Palestine," he added. Khamenei
is head of the Higher Defense
Council.
On the Iraqi statement,
Khamenei said Iraqi President
Saddam Hussein was "not sin
cere."
"Hypothetically, if they
withdraw, it would be to avoid
the losses that Iranian forces
would inflict upon them and to
prepare themselves for a new of
fensive," he said.
"Saddam wants at once to ac
quire a certain political prestige
and the time needed to prepare
himself for a new offensive."
Khamenei added: "We can re
main neither in a state of peace
nor war while our cities are
within enemy firing range."
