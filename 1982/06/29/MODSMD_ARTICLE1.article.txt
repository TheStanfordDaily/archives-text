# Part-time prof named Sec. of State

### Bill Ainsworth 
Former Treasury Secretary
George Shultz, a part-time pro
fessor of management and pub
lic policy in the Graduate School
of Business here since 1974, was
nominated for Secretary of State
by President Ronald Reagan last
Friday. If confirmed by the Sen
ate, Shultz will fill the vacancy
left by Alexander Haig's resigna
tion.
Shultz, president of the
Bechtel Group, served as secre
tary of labor, director of the Of
fice of Management and Budget,
and secretary of the treasury un
der President Richard Nixon. As
secretary of the treasury, he
blocked Nixon's efforts to use
Internal Revenue Service in
formation against political ene
mies. He resigned from the post
three months before Nixon left
office.
Shultz's home is located on
the Stanford campus. On Sunday
he and his wife, Helena, flew
from London to Camp David,
Maryland to meet with Reagan.
Shultz has no direct ex
perience in managingforeign af
fairs but has a strong back
ground in international eco
nomics. According to Robert
Flanagan, assistant business
school professor and director of
the public management pro
gram in which Shultz taught,
Shultz picked up much of his in
itial experience in international
economics as secretary of the
treasury.
"He has a much better feel for
economic issues with respect to

Europe and third world nations
than any other secretary of state
in the recent past," he said.
Flanagan said that economic
issues take up much of a secre
tary of state's time but are rela
tively unpublicized.
The Bechtel Group, a San
Francisco-based worldwide con
struction firm, is closely identi
fied with Arab states such as
Saudi Arabia. In 1976 the U.S.
Justice Department charged the
company with violating anti
trust laws by participating in an

Arab boycott of Israel. The fol
lowing year Bechtel negotiated a
consent decree with the justice
Department.
Democratic leaders said they
will watch to ensure that
Bechtel's business policies are
not carried over to the State De
partment.
Rep. Tom Lantos (D-San
Mateo), here last Friday with the
joint European Parliament-Con
gressional delegation, said that
he didn't think Shultz's previous
association with Bechtel will in
fluence his foreign policy de
cision-making.
"We all come from some
where," he said.
"When we get into high office
I hope our only criterion for for
eign policy decision-making is
U.S. national security interests."
In answer to concern that this
appointment will weaken ties

with Israel, Lantos said, he
thought Congress would ensure
that close relations with Israel
will continue.
Shultz becomes the second
cabinet member to be formerly
employed by Bechtel. Secretary
of Defense Caspar Weinberger
was general counsel for Bechtel
before joining the Reagan ad
ministration.
Shultz said he would cut off
ties to his private interests upon
accepting federal employment.
When Reagan first took office
Shultz was a leading contender
for the office of secretary of state
or some other cabinet post. Ana
lysts say that this earlier con
sideration was probably an im
portant reason why Shultz was
named as Haig's replacement so
quickly.
Shultz served on the Reagan
transition team as chairman of
the Economic Policy Coordi
nation Committee.
Shultz's association with Stan
ford began in 1968 when he be
came a fellow at the Center for
Advanced Study in the Behav
ioral Sciences. In 1974, after he
resigned from the Nixon admin
istration, Shultz was invited by
Business School Dean Arjay
Miller to join the GSB staff as a
part-time professor.
Since then he has taught one
seminar a year on public man
agement. According to
Flanagan, the seminar deals with
managerial issues such as the dif
ferences in running a public de
partment and a private corpo

ration. This year Shultz did not
teach the seminar.
Besides teaching his own sem
inar Shultz generally gave a
number of single lectures for
other GSB classes and seminars.
Flanagan expressed en
thusiasm for Shultz's appoint
ment. "He has a well-honed skill
at conflict resolution. He has a
low-key non-conflictual style
that works to his advantage."
Particularly helpful to Shultz
in his new job will be his ability

to recognize differing points of
legitimacy in arguments,
Flanagan said.
He expressed hope that Shultz
would continue his University
ties.
"I certainly hope he will con
tinue to be associated with us.
Cabinet posts don't last forev
er," he said.
While Shultz was here,
Flanagan said, the GSB bene
fitted substantially from his ex

News Analysis


Russell Jong/Daily
SECRETARY OF STATE'S HOME - In the wake of his recent
nomination for secretary of state, George Shultz, part-time
professor at the Graduate School of Business, probably will
not have much time to spend at his home on the Stanford
campus.
perience.
However, the benefits of
Shultz's assocation with the Uni
versity were not just the Univer
sity's. Shultz deliberately chose
to locate here because he
wanted to pick up new ideas. "I
think many of the things he
learned at Stanford will help him
(in his new position)," Flanagan
said.
Thomas Moore, a senior re
search fellow at the Hoover In
stitution and head of the
domestic studies department,
saiÂ£l he has supported Shultz's
candidacy for appointment to
the office since Reagan was
elected. Moore, who has known
Shultz for more than 14 years,
said he thinks Shultz will be an
"excellent man for the job.
"He will understand the eco
nomic issues of the job," he said,
"but George is broader than
most economists. He's shown
that he can effectively run large
bureaucracies."
Shultz's low-key, soft-spoken
approach wilf contrast with
Haig's more abrasive style,
which often led to disputes with
White House officials and other

cabinet officers.
Haig resigned abruptly, pro
testing that U.S. foreign policy
had shifted from the course de
signed by himself and the Rea
gan administration. White
House sources said disputes be
tween Haig and the staff had
peaked during the past two
weeks. Conflicts centered on the
crisis in Lebanon and Reagan's
recent decision to tighten eco
nomic sanctions against the So
viet Union.
In his various positions, Shultz
has developed personal contacts
with a number of world leaders
which will be valuable in his new
office. While Shultz served as
secretary of the treasury under
Nixon he developed close
friendships with West German
Chancellor Helmut Schmidt and
former French President Valery
Giscard d'Estaing. At the time,
the two European leaders were
finance ministers of their coun
tries.
On a California visit in 1980,
Schmidt stayed at Shultz's cam
pus home.
Haig was considered by many
to be a moderating force within
the Reagan administration, and
Shultz's past statements point to

many basic similarities with Haig
in hisoutlook. However,Shultz's
position favoring the U.S. em
bargo on technology for the
construction of the Soviet natu
ral gas pipeline and his less ap
proving stance on the Israeli in
vasion of Lebanon seem to put
him more in tune with the Rea
gan administration than Haig
was.
Shultz favors the current
massive American military
buildup, as evidenced by an ad
dress he made in a 1980 speech
called "A strategy based on reali
ty." In that speech, which cen
tered on economic policy, he
said, "the restoration of our de
fense capability must be a front
and-center priority, with other
budget and tax decisions in a fol
low-up position.
"We cannot recover from a
failure to commit adequate re
sources to this task," he con
cluded.
Shultz is expected to continue
the hard anti-Soviet line pursued
by the Reagan administration. In
a 1980 interview in which he
criticized the Carter adminis
tration for being inconsistent,
Shultz advocated dealing with
the Soviet Union through

"strength and bold, determined
action."
In Economic Policy Behind the
Headlines, a 1979 book which
Shultz co-authored, he claimed
that the Soviets had been quick
to recognize American loss of
will power from Angola to the
Horn of Africa, to South Yemen,
Afghanistan, Pakistan and Iran.
"Overseas our adversaries
grow bolder," he said. In that
book Shultz said that com
munism as a path for develop
ment was inferior to a market ap
proach and that recent examples

show it is also not "benign in hu
man terms."
Relations with developing na
tions should begin with U.S. rec
ognition of the national aspira
tions of the developing world.
"We must show that ways can be
found to serve the great goals of
equity and efficiency," Shultz
said.
Long an advocate of free
trade, Shultz has argued in favor
of liberalizing world trade and
abolishing protective tariffs and
quotas. In the 1979 book he
warns political leaders not to use
foreign trade as an instrument of
foreign policy, or what he calls
"light-switch diplomacy."
Shultz currently serves on the
board of directors of General
Motors, SRI International and
Dillon, Read and Company, an
investment company owned by
the Bechtel family.
Shultz received his B.A. from
Princeton in 1942 and his Ph.D.
from the Massachusetts Institute
of Technology in 1949. He began
teaching as an associate pro
fessor at M.I.T. in 1948 and left
there to join the faculty of the
University of Chicago in 1957. He
became a dean at Chicago in
1962.
He was named to the Presi
dent's Council of Economic Ad
visors in 1955.
Shultz entered the Nixon ad
ministration in 1968 and left in
1974 to work for Bechtel where
he became president in 1975.
