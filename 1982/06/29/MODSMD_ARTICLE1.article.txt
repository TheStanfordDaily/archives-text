# Part-time prof named Sec. of State

### Bill Ainsworth 
Former Treasury Secretary
George Shultz, a part-time pro
fessor of management and pub
lic policy in the Graduate School
of Business here since 1974, was
nominated for Secretary of State
by President Ronald Reagan last
Friday. If confirmed by the Sen
ate, Shultz will fill the vacancy
left by Alexander Haig's resigna
tion.
Shultz, president of the
Bechtel Group, served as secre
tary of labor, director of the Of
fice of Management and Budget,
and secretary of the treasury un
der President Richard Nixon. As
secretary of the treasury, he
blocked Nixon's efforts to use
Internal Revenue Service in
formation against political ene
mies. He resigned from the post
three months before Nixon left
office.
Shultz's home is located on
the Stanford campus. On Sunday
he and his wife, Helena, flew
from London to Camp David,
Maryland to meet with Reagan.
Shultz has no direct ex
perience in managingforeign af
fairs but has a strong back
ground in international eco
nomics. According to Robert
Flanagan, assistant business
school professor and director of
the public management pro
gram in which Shultz taught,
Shultz picked up much of his in
itial experience in international
economics as secretary of the
treasury.
"He has a much better feel for
economic issues with respect to

Europe and third world nations
than any other secretary of state
in the recent past," he said.
Flanagan said that economic
issues take up much of a secre
tary of state's time but are rela
tively unpublicized.
The Bechtel Group, a San
Francisco-based worldwide con
struction firm, is closely identi
fied with Arab states such as
Saudi Arabia. In 1976 the U.S.
Justice Department charged the
company with violating anti
trust laws by participating in an

Arab boycott of Israel. The fol
lowing year Bechtel negotiated a
consent decree with the justice
Department.
Democratic leaders said they
will watch to ensure that
Bechtel's business policies are
not carried over to the State De
partment.
Rep. Tom Lantos (D-San
Mateo), here last Friday with the
joint European Parliament-Con
gressional delegation, said that
he didn't think Shultz's previous
association with Bechtel will in
fluence his foreign policy de
cision-making.
"We all come from some
where," he said.
"When we get into high office
I hope our only criterion for for
eign policy decision-making is
U.S. national security interests."
In answer to concern that this
appointment will weaken ties

with Israel, Lantos said, he
thought Congress would ensure
that close relations with Israel
will continue.
Shultz becomes the second
cabinet member to be formerly
employed by Bechtel. Secretary
of Defense Caspar Weinberger
was general counsel for Bechtel
before joining the Reagan ad
ministration.
Shultz said he would cut off
ties to his private interests upon
accepting federal employment.
When Reagan first took office
Shultz was a leading contender
for the office of secretary of state
or some other cabinet post. Ana
lysts say that this earlier con
sideration was probably an im
portant reason why Shultz was
named as Haig's replacement so
quickly.
Shultz served on the Reagan
transition team as chairman of
the Economic Policy Coordi
nation Committee.
Shultz's association with Stan
ford began in 1968 when he be
came a fellow at the Center for
Advanced Study in the Behav
ioral Sciences. In 1974, after he
resigned from the Nixon admin
istration, Shultz was invited by
Business School Dean Arjay
Miller to join the GSB staff as a
part-time professor.
Since then he has taught one
seminar a year on public man
agement. According to
Flanagan, the seminar deals with
managerial issues such as the dif
ferences in running a public de
partment and a private corpo

ration. This year Shultz did not
teach the seminar.
Besides teaching his own sem
inar Shultz generally gave a
number of single lectures for
other GSB classes and seminars.
Flanagan expressed en
thusiasm for Shultz's appoint
ment. "He has a well-honed skill
at conflict resolution. He has a
low-key non-conflictual style
that works to his advantage."
Particularly helpful to Shultz
in his new job will be his ability

to recognize differing points of
legitimacy in arguments,
Flanagan said.
He expressed hope that Shultz
would continue his University
ties.
"I certainly hope he will con
tinue to be associated with us.
Cabinet posts don't last forev
er," he said.
While Shultz was here,
Flanagan said, the GSB bene
fitted substantially from his ex

SECRETARY OF STATE'S HOME - In the wake of his recent
nomination for secretary of state, George Shultz, part-time
professor at the Graduate School of Business, probably will
not have much time to spend at his home on the Stanford
campus.
