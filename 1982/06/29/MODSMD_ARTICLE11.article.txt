# Discounts 'core' of Apple computer sales
## 
### Neil MacFarquhar Senior staff writer 
Under a discount program in
itiated last month, anyone af
filiated with Stanford can now
purchase an Apple computer
and any related components at a
20 percent savings.
According to Contract Spe
cialist Charlie Hartman of the
University's procurement office,
the program is "unprecen
dented" in that individuals as
sociated with the University who
buy computers for their person
al needs can receive the dis
count. The discount is only avail
able through Mission Com
puter, which opened a Palo Alto
branch on University Avenue
yesterday.
About 40 Apple computers
have been purchased since the
contract for the deal was signed
May 24. According to Mark
Aschauer, president of Mission
Computer, the bulk of com
puters have gone to students
wanting to take advantage of the
discount; only about six have
been obtained for University de

partments. Overall, he said,
business from Stanford is "much
increased."
Of those departments con
tacted by the Daily, none said
the discount was the deciding
factor in making the purchase of
an Apple computer, but that
specific software packages
available programs were
more important.
At the Medical Center, Dr. Jay
Mason, who does research eval
uating abnormal heart rhythms,
decided to purchase an Apple 111
to help him with data analysis. "I
own an Apple at home, and I
wanted the 'Personal Filing Sys
tem' software package to help
analyze clinical data," he said.
Joy Koda, a post-doctoral fel
low in pediatrics, said her de
partment chose to purchase an
Apple II due to"itsflexibility and
the available software." Similar
discounts were available on oth
er systems, she said, but software
that would allow them to do
graphics, for example, led to
their order for an Apple system.
Overall, Apple and I*BM have

been the most popular micro
computers on campus, but de
partments purchase units from
many companies. The University
buys about 400 microcomputers
annually, said Hartman, because
they are good for word process
ing, records keeping, and
projecting financial reports. In

addition, they are convenient in
that they stand alone and can be
connected to a letter-quality
printer.
Hartman negotiated the con
tract under Apple Computer's
National Account Support Pro
gram. The program, according
to Apple spokesman Carter
Coleman, is designed to help
Apple dealers make large vol
ume sales.
Although Hartman negotiated
directly with Apple, she was
asked to choose a dealer in the

area through whom she would
purchase a minimum of 300 Ap
ple microcomputers. After dis
cussing the details with several
local dealers, she decided to
work with Mission Computer.
They added a number of in
centives to the basic Apple pro
gram. Hartman said Mission

Computer convinced an increas
ing number of departments to
purchase Apple systems. First,
they extended the discount to
any product which can be con
nected to the basic Apple sys
tem. Software and printers, for
example, are both available at
the discount price. Mission
Computer also offered to de
liver, install, and train people on
the computers for free. Finally,
they agreed to charge only $35
per hour for their technicians
and to repair the computers on

campus. "House calls are un
heard of, and the going rate for
technicians is about $5O per
hour," said Hartman.
While some recipients of the
Apples complained of con
tinued delays in the training and
said it is not very com
prehensive, departments that
received the Apples are happy
with them overall. In addition,
the servicing and deliveries
made by other computer stores
have "not been satisfactory,"
said Hartman.
Mission Computer and
Hartman are now working on a
program whereby anyone af
filiated with the University could
get the discount on Apple sys
tems anywhere in the country.

"...the bulk of computers have gone to students
wanting to take advantage of the discount; only
about six have been obtained for University
departments."
