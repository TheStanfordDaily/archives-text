Roble Hall residents suffered from a
flood last weekend which resulted in total
water damage of about $2500, according
to Robert Mibach, facilities manager for
residence halls.
Early Sunday morning residents heard a
fire alarm, which went off twice that
night, as scalding water erupted from
holes in the plumbing. Officials cited
Roble's aging structure and an apparent
lack of security.
The flood started at 12:45 a.m. in room
367 Wing C. Holly Peterson, a participant
in the Stanford Publishing Course, leaned
on her washroom sink, causing the
bracket that attaches the washbasin to the
wall to collapse onto the floor.
Frederick Michell, a Publishing Course

faculty member and a resident in Roble
Hall, first answered Peterson's call for
help. He found three inches of water on
the floor.
The flood forced eight residents to re
locate, and resulted in water damage to 15
rooms on three floors.
"This is the largest water accident in
Roble in my 12 years here," said campus
plumber Jim Self, who was called in to cut
off the main water supply.
In addition to the flooding problems,
Roble has also suffered from thievery.
Several residents of Roble Hall were
robbed last Friday. Equipment losses in
clude: three cameras, two calculators,
one watch, one clock, one pocket radio,
one tape recorder and some cookies.
Mibach said, "I think it is safe to assume

the rooms were locked." He said three
Roble Hall employees were reassigned
while an investigation into the thefts is
continuing.
According to Mib.'i h, the three em
ployees are temporary workers who were
hired to assist the housekeeping staff at
Roble Hall.
Some of the vicitims may sue the Uni
versity for negligence. Delia van Heyst,
director of the Stanford Publishing
Course which is housing students in
Roble Hall, told the group that the Uni
versity will look into its insurance policy
to see if the victims of the thefts could be
compensated. One victim is offering a $5O
reward for information leading to the ar
rest and conviction of the persons who
stole her calculator.
