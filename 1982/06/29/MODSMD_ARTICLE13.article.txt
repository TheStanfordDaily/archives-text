The University's summer Jazz Workshop, a pro
gram presented by the Student Arts at Stanford
(STARTS) office and Bay Area musician Jim Nadel
(class of 72), entered its tenth season yesterday.
In addition to the regular five-week program,
STARTS has scheduled two intensive one-week
"jazz camps" in August that will feature nationally
acclaimed musicians Stan Getz and Lanny Morgan
as special guest instructors.
According to Jean Martin, STARTS program di
rector, Jazz Weeks One (Aug 1-7) and Two (Aug.
8-14) are Stanford firsts, "patterned after the re
nowned (classical) music camps in Interlochen
(Michigan) and Tanglewood (Massachusetts)."
Students from all over the nation have paid $175
tuition plus $136 for housing and meals to "be
completely immersed in jazz," said Martin. The
group of close to 20 boarders (registration is still
available for "walk-ins") will stay in the Cowell
Cluster.
Jazz musicians will venture here from Montana,
Ohio, New Mexico, Texas and Massachusetts.
Nadel described the camp curriculum as "rigor
ous, but casual." It includes small combo playing,
development of improvisational skills, "ear" de
velopment, jazz theory and individual instruction.
Students will be able to "jam" with Getz or
Morgan. Performances will be weeknights from 10
to 12 p.m. in the Coffee House.
"Stan (Getz) is very enthusiastic about coming
here because it will be a new thing for him too,"
Nadel said.
According to Nadel, Getz, 55, has been involved

in jazz all of his life. He has played on over 100
albums and has won several Grammy awards. He
will come to Stanford July 31, directly after com
pleting a European tour.
Morgan earned his name playing with the May
nard Ferguson Band in the '6os.
The regular five-week jazz workshop, entitled
Jazz Summer Ten, is similar to the camps but less
intensive. Although it lacks famous instructors,.
Nadel has gathered noted Bay Area musicians for
his workshop faculty.
Besides listening to the "jam sessions" at the
Coffee House, the summer Stanford community
can benefit from the Jazz Workshop by attending
the jazz lecture series Thursday nights fn
Dinkelspiel Auditojlum. Getz will lecture on Au
gust 5.
