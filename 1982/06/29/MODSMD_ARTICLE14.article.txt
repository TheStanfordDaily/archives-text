# RLG offsets high research costs

### Sid Carter 
After an unexpectedly long, stormy introduction period, it
appears that the Research Libraries Group, Inc. (RLG),
formed to offset the high costs of research resources, can
finally look forward to a long-awaited period of calm.
RLG incorporated in 1978, and moved its physical plant
from New Haven to Stanford in 1979 to take advantage of the
Ballots computer system used here. Since then, RLG has ex
perienced problems that have prevented the performance
expected of it. These included the delivering of defective
equipment and a storm that caused the loss of some stored
computer data files.
According to Edward Shaw, president of RLG, Inc., RLG is
about seven months behind schedule. But he stressed that
RLG is an experiment whose effectiveness cannot be meas
ured in the short run.
The primary objective of RLG is to spread the cost of main
taining the resources necessary for quality academic re
search at the graduate and post-doctoral level. (After energy
costs, research resources represent the fastest growing ex
pense at many universities.) Consequently, RLG is a selective
group which limits admission to those institutions it feels
could contribute and benefit greatly from membership.
RLG's current members include 25 universities and two inde
pendent research libraries. Shaw expects that RLG will not
accept many more than 13 new members in the future, which
would-bring the total to 40.
By pooling resources, the libraries of member institutions
can avoid wasteful duplicated effort and focus on the quality,
and not the quantity, of their libraries. According to Jim
Myers, associate director of technical services for the Univer
sity Libraries, some day perhaps 80 percent of the books used
for research here will come from other institutions.
RLG recently acquired its own IBM 3081 computer. This
should mark the beginning of consistently good per
formance and a stable recovery, according to Shaw. Myers
said the situation here has improved, but the libraries are still
behind their status before all the problems set in.
