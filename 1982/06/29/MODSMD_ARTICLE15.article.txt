The Secret Policeman's Other Ball
Various Artists
Island Records

Approximately a year ago, there was an
import album entitled The Secret Police
man's Ball. It was an album of a benefit
sponsored by the English branch of Am
nesty International, a humanitarian or
ganization bent on donating funds to
help further worldwide human rights.
The "Ball" usually consisted of the top
British vaudeville show. However, last
year, a rock music portion was included in
the show and the results were fabulous.
The acoustic guitar contributions by Pete
Townshend of The Who gave the benefit
respectability. The album gained wide
spread appeal, resulting in its release in
America (to the advantage of Amnesty In
ternational).
This past fall has seen the continuation
of the "Ball," which has resulted in the re
cently released The Secret Policeman's
Other Ball. This album has many more
"star" performers donating their services
by contributing new versions of their clas
sic songs. The supporting cast is high
lighted by Jeff Beck, Eric Clapton, Sting
(of the Police), and others. The artists all
contribute excellent songs, and the over
all effect is one that is very warm, intimate
and moving. The views of Amnesty In
ternational are reflected in the per
formers' song choices, since the songs ex
press signs of humanity and hope. The
songs enhance the message behind the

music. The cause of worldwide human
rights is an important one, and the per
formers give that cause a stronger basis
from which to work.
Musically, the album is as honorable as
the cause, and it should result in calling
attention to the purpose of the ball. The

musical highlight is an historical reunion
of guitar virtuosos Eric Clapton and Jeff
Beck. It seems that benefit concerts
always have brought out the more
"friendly" aspects of performers (as in the
Bangladesh or No Nukes benefits). Clap
ton and Beck have always been rivals in

the guitar-playing field, but here for the
first time, their jealousies are forgotten.
Their set consists of a trio of uplifting and
beautiful guitar-dominated songs. Sur
prisingly, their first song is an instrumen
tal Stevie Wonder song, "Cause We've
Ended as Lovers." Stevie Wonder has con
tinually donated his services to many
charities and benefits, but for some rea
son he has never gained much favor with
the harder (white) rock audience. This isa
pity, because Clapton and Beck's version
is easily one of the most inspirational per
formances that either guitarist has done.
Following this song is Clapton's person
al favorite, "Farther Up The Road." This
song has been recorded by Clapton on
numerous albums, but it still comes across
as original. The pairing of Beck with Clap
ton gives both guitarists more room to
work in, in turn giving the song a new
feel. Finally, the closing song of their set is
the archetypal "Crossroads." Although
listeners may be expecting a powerhouse
rocker a la Cream's version, Clapton and
Beck restore more of the bluesy style of
the original song. Even though the light
ning runs of Cream's version are not
found here, this new version still
possesses amazing guitar interplay. Clap
ton and Beck's trade-offs of licks and riffs
create a musical momentum and power
not heard since Clapton and Duane Al-
Iman teamed up on the Lay/a album. This
version of "Crossroads" thoroughly
shows the beauty of the guitar without
the need of blazing guitar riffs. This is a

fact that too many new
guitarists forget. Clapton and
Beck could run circles around
any guitarist, but with their not
doing so and with their inten
tional emphasis on interplay,
the resultant sound is far more
worthwhile to the listener.
The most surprising per
formance, though, is given by
Sting, the vocalist and bassist of
The Police. Sting takes two of
the Police's most popular tunes
and transforms them into ex
tremely hauntingand beautiful
songs. The urgency implicit in
Sting's voice when performing
"Roxanne" ana "Message in a
Bottle" is very ciear, and it ex
presses the immediacy of the
causes that Amnesty Interna
tional supports. His singing is
both very beautiful and yet
very scary, which results in add
ing much meaning to the over
all benefit's purpose.
Finally, Sting is joined by all
of the benefit's musicians on a
raucous, reggae-inspired ver
sion of Dylan's "I Shall Be Re
leased." It is a very emotional
rendition a worthy finale of a
worthy album for a worthy
cause.
