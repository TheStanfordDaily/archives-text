# A 						symphony of inventions in 'Luna Park'
## 
### Jiri Weiss 
Fire at Luna Park, premier
ing at the Magic Theatre in
San Francisco, is an inspired
play by a young Jewish play
wright named Theodore Faro
Gross.
The theme is the American
dream from the point of view
of four Jewish immigrants
from Eastern Europe. The play
is set at the turn of the century
in the growing Coney Island
resort.
The four are the successful
enterpreneur, Zar (Richard
Rekow), who plans to turn
Coney Island into a huge fair
ground; and the middle-aged
sign painter Lev (Jack
Shearer), who, together with
his wife Bella (Kate Black) and
his shy daughter Mirele (Cyn
thia Wands) runs a postcard
parlor.
But the play is not a usual
story of four immigrants. It isa
tale of imagination and day
dream with an unusual struc
ture. It "is not a play for the
theatre of magic or the super
natural," Gross writes in his
notes, but of pragmatism.
"America was invented by its

immigrants," Gross con
tinues. "Its identity lies in
some symphony of their in
ventions."
Each scene contains a dif
ferent vantage point, a dif
ferent interpretation of
events from the point of view
of one of the four characters.
But it is not just the in
terpretation of events that
changes. Characters retain
their personality but their
roles interchange: the hus
band becomes the father, the
wife becomes the mother.
What holds the play to
gether is the central character
of Mirele. She plays a dif
ferent instrument in each
scene, suggesting that they
are only variations on the
same theme. The subtitle to
the play is "transcription for
four instruments in six
scenes."
This constant interchange
of roles is confusing and Mag
ic Theatre's production does
not make it easy for the au
dience. Each scene is pref
aced by a headline to under

score the change of vantage
point scene one is Czar,
scene two Bella, for example.
Butthis production neverrea
ly implements this Brechtian
touch. So it is easy to get lost.
Sometimes you are just not
sure who is who.
But, conceivably, the con
fusion in the play is the con
fusion of our memories. A
murder occurs in Luna Park,
or maybe one doesn't. One
moment you may be imagin
ing yourself making love to a
beautiful young wife only to
discover a moment iater that
in reality she is nothing but a
nagging aging woman with
cramps in her leg.
The cast does a truly pro
fessional job, and in spite of
the poor set and sound ef
fects this play has to be one of
the most interesting in town.
(Fire at Luna Park plays at
the Magic Theatre in the Fort
Mason Center, San Francisco,
each Wednesday through
Sunday until July 11. For
