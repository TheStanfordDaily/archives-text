PLO offers to leave Lebanon
Beirut, Lebanon The Palestine Liberation Organiza
tion and the Lebanese government submitted a proposal
to the United States yesterday in which PLO chairman
Yasser Arafat agreed to leave Lebanon with his top de
puties and guerrillas and West Beirut would become a
demilitarized zone.
"Arafat is gone it's just a matter of how," said one
Lebanese official involved with the night-long nego
tiations that led for the first time to a joint position by the
PLO and the government.
Lebanese officials were hopeful that the plan given to
U.S. special presidential envoy Philip Habib could lead to
a settlement in the 22-day-old war. As one diplomat put
it, the question now was whether Israel, having achieved
most of its military objectives, still wanted to go for the
"last pound of flesh."
Publicly, the PLO has denied that it is willing to leave
Beirut. But sources close to the negotiations said Arafat
has agreed to a face-saving move to another country
Syria and Egypt have been mentioned as possible sites
if he and his followers can depart with their weapons and
if the PLO can leave behind a symbolic military presence
under the command of the Lebanese army.
The PLO has rejected Israel's demand to surrender its
arms and move in a convoy under International Red
Cross supervision through Israeli-controlled territory to
Syria. Another exit route being discussed is a departure
by sea through the Christian-controlled port of Juniyah.
The Israeli Cabinet was expected to discuss the PLO
proposal today.
Hinckley shocked at verdict
Washington John Hinckley says he was shocked last
week when a jury found him not guilty by reason of in
sanity in the shooting of President Ronald Reagan, and
had prepared a four-page speech to read in court the day
he thought he would be sentenced.
"I thought for sure I would be convicted because of
the pressure the jury would be under to return a guilty
verdict," Hinckley said during three telephone in
terviews from St. Elizabeths Hospital for the mentally ill,
where he is now confined.
"I respect them now a lot for just saying, 'To hell with
what the public said, we think he's not guilty,' " he said.
He said during the conversations Saturday and Sunday
that he believed he was insane when he fired on Reagan
and three others, that he takes the blame for the shoot
ings and that he now feels "really sorry" for presidential
press secretary James Brady, who was wounded in the
head and permanently injured.
If doctors at St. Elizabeths decide he is well, Hinckley
said, he wants to leave the hospital. But that decision is
up to a federal judge.
The 27-year-old presidential assailant said he had seen
news reports about the public outcry over the jury's ver
dict, but he emphatically denied that he "beat the rap,"
as one newspaper headline had said.
Beirut peace plan endorsed
Washington The Reagan administration yesterday
endorsed a four-point plan to defuse the Israeli-Palesti
nian confrontation in Beirut, as official sources reported
the first substantial movement toward a negotiated set
tlement.
The U.S. stand, announced by State Department
spokesman Dean Fischer, would bring "an end to the
armed Palestinian presence in and around Beirut," thus
going a long way toward accomplishment of the Israeli
aim of neutralizing the Palestine Liberation Organiza
tion.
The U.S. statement did not spell out how this armed
presence would be ended, but officials said the United
States is seeking the disarming of the 5000 to 6000 Palesti
nian guerrillas trapped in Beirut and the relocation of at

least their leadership to another country.
This is reported to be the central point of the nego
tiations between the PLO and the Lebanese government
in Beirut, with special U.S. envoy Philip Habib standing in
the wings to supply U.S. backing and international coor
dination.
Washington sources said that for the first time the
Palestinian and Lebanese leaders have gotten down to
business and are making progress. There has been more
movement in the past 48 hours than at any previous time,
an official said. But he cautioned that problems remain,
and it is too early to breathe a sigh of relief.
School funding snags state budget
Sacramento A fragile Assembly accord seeking
more money for schools in the $25.2 billion state budget
hit a snag in the Senate yesterday, as leaders in the upper
house said the plan strained the state's too-skimpy fiscal
reserve.
Earlier in the day, both houses approved 581346, a
companion bill to the main budget legislation, which
was passed Friday by both houses. The Assembly vote on
the so-called "budget trailer" bill was 57-9. In the Senate,
the vote was 27-4.
The companion measure changes the laws necessary
to make the budget bill work.
It also suspends the so-called "deflator" that other
wise would cut aid to schools and local governments by
$2.3 billion, substituting a smaller $269 million cut in local
government aid. That bill also provides $5O million to
$lOO million extra for schools.
On Friday, the Senate passed the 1982-83 budget bill in
short order, but the spending plan emerged from the As
sembly only after an;eight-hour deadlock. Republicans
threatened to withhold votes for the measure unless
they got an additional $5O million for schools.
The Assembly approved the budget in a 54-12 vote, the
bare minimum needed for passage.
British rail strike called off
London Britain's railroad union leaders, their strike
call ignored by thousands of members, called off a day
old walkout yesterday after it had plunged London into
transportation chaos the worst traffic congestion the
city has ever seen.
The British capital was "locked in a grip of steel," a
Royal Automobile Club spokesman said, as 'ts 1 million
commuters tried to get to and from work in a metropolis
already hobbled by a week-old subway shutdown.
Scotland Yard called it "an all-day rush hour." There
were estimates that more than 80 miles of roads were af
fected by traffic jams.
The surprise reversal by the leadership of the National
Union of Railwaymen, a defeat for the union's left-wing
militants, seemed to undercut a threatened campaign of
labor disruption in state-owned industries against Prime
Minister Margaret Thatcher's Conservative Party gov
ernment.
Delegates at the NUR's annual conference in
Plymouth, a coastal resort in southwest England, voted
47-30 to suspend the strike, which began at midnight
Sunday in a pay and productivity dispute with the state
owned British Rail.
The rail workers are to return to the job at midnight
today, and trains are expected to be running again
tomorrow.
Donovan cleared of mob charges
Washington Flashing a smile and a thumbs-up
salute, Raymond Donovan, the embattled secretary of
labor, yesterday stepped briefly into public view to say
that he is "extremely pleased and certainly not sur
prised" that a special prosecutor's report had concluded
there was insufficient evidence to prosecute him on
charges of mob-linked corruption.

"The special prosecutor has confirmed what I told you
all along that none of these allegations would prove to
be true," Donovan told an audience of reporters and
cheering supporters at the Labor Department.
His intention now, he said, is "to devote all my time
and all of my energies to the task that President (Ronald)
Reagan asked me to do 18 months ago."
White House sources say Donovan still is likely to face
pressure to resign, but there was no indication of this
from Reagan, who, according to one aide was, "pleased
as hell" with the report.
When asked at the daily White House briefing wheth
er the president still has "full confidence" in Donovan,
press aide Larry Speakes responded, "I have not heard
him say otherwise."
