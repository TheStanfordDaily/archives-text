# Delegates regret Haig's resignation
## 
### Bill Ainsworth 
Twenty-one European Par
liament delegates and their con
gressional hosts visited Stanford
last Friday expecting to learn
about computers; their atten
tion was diverted, however, by
the sudden announcement of
Secretary of State Alexander
Haig's resignation.
Eva Gredal of Denmark, head
of the delegation, joined Rep.
Tom Lantos (D-San Mateo) in
publicly expressing regret over
the resignation. The two spoke
at an International Center
luncheon featuring the dele
gates and their 13 Congressional
hosts.
"We have lost a great Europe
an in the American government
a good friend of Europe. Haig
was a man who understood the
word consultation," she said.
Lantos, who chaired the U.S.
Congressional Delegation to the
European Parliament, said he
"deeply regretted" Haig's resig
nation and invited the delegates
to sign a cable he was sending to
Haig expressing his regret.
The cable addressed to Haig
said, "Your decision to resign isa
blow to all who cherish free and
democratic societies around the
globe."
Signers besides - Lantos in
cluded Sam Gibbons (D-Fla.),
Bill Frenzel (R-Minn.), Jerry
Huckaby (D-La.) Larry Winn (R-
Kan.) and Bill Clinger (R-Penn.),

all of whom were present at the
luncheon.
Haig was replaced by former
Secretary of the Treasury George
Shultz, who is on the faculty of
the Graduate School of Business
here and is chief officer of the
San Francisco-based Bechtel
Group.
Gredal said that Europe
looked forward to working with
Shultz.
However, European Delegate
Fritz Gautier of West Germany
feared that Haig's resignation
signaled a bureaucratic victory
for Secratary of Defense Caspar
Weinberger and other members
of the Reagan administration
who favor a high technology
trade embargo against the Soviet
Union. Germany has not joined
the U.S. embargo and is current
ly supplying the Soviets with
technology for use in their con
struction of a long natural gas
pipeline.
The administration has threat
ened sanctions against both
France and Germany if they use
U.S. technology to aid in the
completion of the pipeline,
which would bring natural gas
from Siberia to Western Europe.
"This may mean a stronger
policy against Germany,"
Gautier told the Daily. "We
don't think we should extend
the embargo. We think a policy
of cooperation with the Soviet
Union is best in the long run."

Gautier said he thought the
change in secretaries of state
would not improve U.S.-Europe
an relations.
Second Vice-Chairman of the
European Delegation Rene Pi
quet, a French Communist, was
cautious about the change. "I
hope the change will not make
matters worse," he told the Dai
ly-
"Franco-American relations
"were already difficult because of
U.S. decisions in trade and eco
nomics," he added.
The University was one stop
on the joint delegation's
whirlwind tour of the peninsula.
After lunch at the International
Center, the delegates heard two
speeches about the develop
ment and current state of the
nearby Silicon Valley high tech
nology area.
John Doyle, Hewlett-Packard
Corp. vice-president for de

velopment and research, told
the delegation that soon com
puters will be "a natural, ev
eryday part of our lives."
The transition that will add
computers to society's in
frastructure will be led by the
young, according to Doyle, be
cause they are growing up with
computers.
He said that computation will
increase people's capacity to re
call and improve their learning
capability.
"Before the decade is over
we'll be able to talk to com
puters in our everyday lan
guage," Doyle predicted, add
ing that advances in software will
make this possible.
The technological vitality of
this area, he said, comes from
the interaction between the
University, the industry and the
entrepreneur.
