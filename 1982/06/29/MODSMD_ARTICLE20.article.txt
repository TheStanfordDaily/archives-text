# Sequoia Travel worker missing

### Ray Newman 
A man who has worked at the Sequoia Travel Center
on campus for the last four years has been reported miss
ing since last Friday after making a phone call to his wife
in which he said he was being followed.
Captain Raoul Niemeyer of the University Police De
partment said, however, that "it's still a little premature
to conclude that he's been kidnapped."
Valerie Gray said that her husband, Steve Gray, called
her at 1:40 p.m. Friday. Mrs. Gray said her husband
seemed "completely out of breath, and scared, at the
same time," and that he said he was near Memorial
Church and thought he was being followed by "some
body tall."
Gray then said that he would call back after returning
to the office, according to his wife. When he had not
been heard from by 2 p.m., Mrs. Gray filed a missing per
sons report with the University Police.
Mrs. Gray and Gray's father have put up posters near
Tressider Union that ask, "Was Steve Gray Kidnapped?"
Niemeyer said yesterday that the department has no
leads. Asked about the possibility that Gray had been
kidnapped, he said, "we really don't have any informa
tion to substantiate that."
An employee of Sequoia Travel said that Gray was "ex
tremely quiet, very reserved, always smiling. Always
friendly, but never really showing his emotions."
Gray was wearing a striped brown sweater, jeans, and a
gold chain around his neck when last seen, his wife said.
