Freedman may find out later this
week whether or not she will be
granted tenure here after all.
History Prof. Carl Degler,
chairman of a history depart
ment committee that has sub
mitted materials in support of
Freedman to the Committee on
Appointments and Promotions
(CAP), said last Friday that a de
cision regarding Freedman's
tenure may be made soon,
"probably next week."
The CAP is advising the deans
of Humanities and Sciences
(H & S) on the issue. Dean of
H & S Norman Wessells, who
along with Associate Deans Wil
liam Chace and James Rosse will
decide Freedman's case, said Fri
day that the CAP had metand re
viewed the case.
Wessells would not indicate,
however, when a final decision
would be made by the deans.
Freedman said that she did not
know when she would be in
formed of the decision. "I
haven't heard anything from the
dean yet. I'm waiting," she said.
The University's original de
cision not to grant Freedman
tenure met with much opposi
tion and sparked charges of sex
ual discrimination. Freedman
was one of the founders of the
feminist studies program here.
