## Haig's resignation affects talks 
### Washington Post 
Geneva The abrupt resigna
tion of Secretary of State Alex
ander Haig has added some new
and unexpected elements to the
U.S.-Soviet strategic arms reduc
tion talks that open here Tues
day.
American officials say Haig's
departure will not mean any shift
in the opening U.S. proposals or
positions. Those were set in final
form Friday by President Ronald
Reagan, officials say, at a lunch
attended by Haig and the chief
U.S. negotiator, retired Lt. Gen.
Edward Rowny.

Rather, sources here and in
Washington say, the impact of
the resignation will befeltin per
ipheral yet potentially important
ways.
The immediate impact, one
official speculated, will probably
be to make the Reagan adminis
tration appear "a little off bal
ance" to the Soviet Union as the
talks begin.
One official said, "One of the
things the Reagan adminis
tration needs is for the Soviets to
perceive that we know what we
are doing and have a coherent
foreign policy." The Haig resig

nation and a vote in the House
Foreign Affairs Committee last
week supporting a nuclear
freeze "both could not have
come at a worse time," he said.
For now, therefore, Haig's res
ignation may make the Reagan
administration seem even more
of a puzzle to Moscow, in the
view of some specialists. It and
the nuclear freeze vote could
lead the Soviets to adopt a wait
and-see approach at these talks.
The Soviets favor a freeze, which
the White House contends
wouid formalize existing Soviet
advantages in long-range missile
power.
