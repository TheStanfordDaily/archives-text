Washington The Reagan
administration is encouraging a
"polarization on environmental
issues" among government,,
business, and environmental
groups, Russell Train, president
of the U.S. arm of the World
Wildlife Fund, said yesterday.
Despite "very impressive" in
ternational accomplishments in
environmental protection in the
last decade, said Train, who has
headed the Environmental Pro
tection Agency (EPA) and the
Council on Environmental Qual
ity, "there is room for a great
deal of improvement in the ad
ministration's environmental
policy across the board."
The single greatest environ
mental problem facing the Unit-

Ed States "does not involve a
specific policy, activity, or pro
gram, but a perception that has
arisen that the administration is
negative about environmental
problems," Train said in an in
terview.
Answering Train's claims,
Byron Nelson, chief spokesman
for the EPA, said that "the Rea
gan administration encourages
the working together of various
groups interested in environ
mental policy. Our agenda has
been open and clear."
Nelson said Train's use of the
term "polarization" in describ
ing current environmental poli
cy was "a mis-characterization of
the goals and aims of the Reagan
administration."
