## American ideal is at the movies 
### 
Washington An old friend
seems to be taking care of
Ronald Reagan's business this
summer.
Where the presidency and
other institutions are failing,
Hollywood, at least, is successful
ly reassuring Americans that
dreams still can come true,
fhreeof this season's most lucra
tive success stories Rocky 111,
E.T., the Extra-Terrestrial and
Star Trek II: The Wrath of Khan
are packing 'em in with a
simple, old formula: letthegood
guys win and keep the real world
to a minimum.
Though these flicks are hardly
classics, one needn't criticize the
film industry. With record-set
ting gates, movie producers
have little incentive to provide
us with alternatives. But when
the American dream thrives only
at local box offices, there may be
something to worry about.
Similarly, the prevalence of
overnight millionaires doesn't
disguise the fact that, for most of
us, the Good Life is more elusive
and obscure than ever. Old step
ping stones to economic success
college diplomas, hard work
and loyalty lack the magic
they once held. Even thoseatthe
top don't know where the U.S.
economy is going.
Of course. Rocky Balboa, hero
of Rocky 111, works hard to reaf
firm the health of the inspira
tional Horatio Alger myth. This
time, the pea-brained but big
hearted boxer risks accumulated
laurels to recapture the Big One.
But most of us wouldn't both
er to follow Rocky's lead today.
As a 1981 Gallup Poll illustrated,
even Rocky's natural constituen
cy the American teenager is
interested much less in notable
achievement than in salvaging
what's available in the real
world. We're resigned to limited
expectations of ourselves, leav
ing the glory of the chase to the
daring few.
We're also skeptical about the
value of prominence. Most peo
ple could probably name some
one who, like Rocky the boxer,
has become miserably successful
(glossy weeklies have turned the
woes of the rich into a popular
genre).
And we know how hollow
late-century, middle-class af
fluence can be: before 25, many
Americans have already burned
out on life's niceties. Only

dream-makers keep forgetting
that the old standard of outdo
ing one's parents broke down
or at least suffered a sharp
change in applicability during
the 19605.
Any graduate of suburbia can
see the implications of this
change in E.T., a Peter Pan-ish
story of a young Southern Cali
fornian who befriends a surpris
ingly charming creature from
space. The kid's peculiarly Amer
ican problem boredom is
swept away with E.T.'s arrival.
Oh, that we too could have
something unique emerge from
our tool sheds.
Barring that, we'll settle for
such space films any day. Star
Trek 11, for instance, is set com
fortably in the 24th century to as
sure us that the stigmata of to
day's often bloody world are at
least fewer in number. The old
themes ambition, good/evil,
heroism thrive with less effort
in this fanciful future than they
do in our world.
America's No. 1 moviegoer
Ronald Reagan may not like
this analysis. As president, he
hasn't let tuition hikes, plant
closings and a continuing re
cession spoil his anecdotal string
of American success stories. Per
haps only a Hollywood man
could so well manage the
nostalgic tendencies of Ameri
cans, who lack a better alter
native.
But, in a "dead" economy (to
use Treasury Secretary Donald
Regan's words), it's not only the
poor, elderly, young and minor
ities who are left holding the
ticket stubs. Soothsayer Kevin
Phillips, in his new book, Post-
Conservative America, suggests
that the upper fifth of American
society could be fighting for its
Reagan-era gains by the
mid-1980s.
"If Reaganomics in the end
proves to be a grab bag of un
workable policies," Phillips
writes, "then . . . the less affluent
four-fifths of the population, en
compassing the great middle
class, may ... demand a re-re
distribution (of the wealth)."
In the meantime, Reagan can
look at the situation this way: his
polities, at least, are sending
more Americans to the movies.
