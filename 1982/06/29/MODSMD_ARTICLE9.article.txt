## Summer group is unique

So you are asking yourself why
you are here? That is a good
question to be asking yourself. I
sure am asking it. But do you
think those students who come
to school in September and
leave in June (commonly known
as "normal students") are asking
themselves why they are not at
tending summer session? I
doubt it.
These "normal students"
probably have high-paying jobs
at high-tech companies. Or,
they may have lovy-paying jobs
at low-tech companies. Some of
these "normals" may even have
no job at a non-tech company.
These students are called "un
employed" and are most likely
on some beach in Santa Cruz. Or
if they live in a land-locked state
(heaven help them) these un
employed students are probably
roaming about in mountains,
wheatfields, or the nearest K-
Mart parking lot.
The bottom line is these "nor
mal students" probably do not
have reading assignments to get
done, most likely do not have
term papers to write, almost cer
tainly do not have problem sets
to finish, and definitely do not
have final exams to worry about.
Let's face it, these "normal stu
dents" are very wise; they are
not attending summer session at
Stanford or any other institution
of higher learning across this
great country of ours. For the
many foreign students at Stan

ford, like myself, this country is
not ours, it is theirs.
The summer student is a spe
cial breed of human. We con
tinually endure the painof learn
ing in a sado-masochistic-like
manner. We disguise these sado
masochistic tendencies with
some of the most brilliant ex
cuses known to mankind. Some
of us "abnormal students" say
we are here because we want to
attend a different university for a
short period of time. Summer is
one time when practically any
one and anything may attend
Stanford University.
Others of us are here because
the University offers a program
or class only available during
summer quarter. The expen
diture of $2OOO is justified with
this popular excuse.
Then there are those who are
in such a hurry to get out of this
University they will do almost
anything, including joining the
army, to graduate. Compared to
the army, however, Stanford in
the summer looks pretty good to
these desperate people.
The flip side to these am
bitious, desperate students are
the "God I can hardly wait to get

out of here, if I ever get out of
here," students. These people
typically took 10 credits one
quarter, accumulated a number
of incompletes, dropped a few
classes and, like magic, here they
are this summer with one quar
ter still to go before graduating.
But the truly sick students are
those people who have returned
to Stanford so they can emulate,
the student life again. For some it
may be part of their mid-life
crisis. This "returning student"
phenomenon is unusual, per
verted, and still unexplained by
modern science.
Whatever the reason, here we
are a conglomeration of am
bitious, unambitious, and plain
crazy people together at Stan
ford for the summer. But cheer
up. The Stanford University
Summer Bulletin informs us of
how beautiful it is here in the
summer. What the bulletin does*
not say, however, is whether the
quad is more beautiful that the
beaches in the summer.
Yes, the summer student is tru
ly a unique breed of human.
