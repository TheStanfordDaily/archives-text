# Draft protester indicted
## Gov't escalates registration enforcement 
### Neil MacFarquhar Senior staff writer 
The battle over draft regis
ration is escalating as a San Die
;o Federal grand jury handed
Jown the first indictment against
i non-registrant Wednesday and
egislation linking federal finan
:ial aid to registering is expected
0 pass in Congress this month.
In light of the indictment, lo
:al anti-conscription forces held
1 rally yesterday to vocalize sup
)ort for area non-registrants.
About 75 people gathered at
ioon at the Palo Alto post office
to support those who, as one
iign said, "join the people who
won't join the army."
Speakers included non-regis
trants Ben Davidson, Matt Nico
demus, and Russell Ford, as well
as peace activist Claire Smith and
lawyer Dan Mayfield.
Davidson, 19, said that it was a
"struggle not to give in to the
fear generated by smacking up
against the power of the state."
He continued to refuse to reg
ister, he said, because he did not
want to be "processed into a
trained killer."
He said he would not hand
over his decision to die for a
cause to the United States
Armed Forces which "massacres
civilians, helps topple 'unfriend
ly' governments and serves our
dying colonial empire."
Smith, who broke into tears
while she was talking, spoke of
the importance of. giving sup
port to the draft resisters, to not
expect them to be "bionic."
Now that they are being prose
cuted by the courts, she said, it is
important that they know that
they are "not alone in their suf
fering."
In total, it is estimated that
527,000, or about seven percent,
of those required to register
within 30 days of their 18th birth
day have not done so. According
to Nicodemus, the Justice De
partment has a total of 160 names
which it is sending out to local
United States attorneys' offices
t0 begin prosecution. The local
attorney is thought to be acting
°n eight names, he said.
Nicodemus, a member of
Stanford Against Conscription
(SAC), said that as a white
middle-class male, he didn't

have any friends who had done
time, and that he feared the
"permanent changes" prison
might cause in him. He said the
support of the community has
helped him confront the fears of
"doing time."
Ford, from Wesleyan Univer
sity in Connecticut, received
warning letters from the Selec
tive Service System (SSS) and
from his local U.S. attorney.
Also, according to Nicodemus,
the FBI visited his house in Con
necticut three days ago.
Ford said his eyes are too bad
for him to be drafted, but that he
was a public non-registrant be
cause of his "love, respect, and
responsibilty for humanity and
the living planet which is my
home." Facing the prospect of
going to jail is easier knowing
that "there are others out there
who care. I thank you for being
here," Ford said.
Not everyone was supportive.
A woman heckler, passing the
rally in a car, shouted, "Protect
our country, down with all com
mies."
Mayf ield, a member of the Na
tional Lawyers Guild, said "dem
onstrations would defeat the
draft," not legal manuevering.
All 8000 members of the Guild,
formed in the '30s as an alter
native to the American Bar As
sociation, are willing to help
anyone indicted. The national
Committee Against Registration
and the Draft (CARD) and the
Guild are working together to
raise funds to defend anyone
prosecuted, Mayfield said.
"Prosecution is going to be
made as expensive as possible,"
he said.
Partially due to this expense,
and due to the difficulty in track
ing down non-registrants, Sena
tor S.I. Hayakawa (R-Calif.) in
troduced an amendment to the
Defense Authorization Bill
which would deny federal stu
dent aid to men not registered.
The amendment passed the Sen
ate on a voice vote May 10, and a
similar amendment is expected
to be added to the House's de
fense bill this month.
If passed, the law would go
into effect October 1. Thus it
could not change next year's
loans, as they are currently being

processed and will go out in Sep
tember. It would effect all feder
al educational loan programs for
the following year, however, in
cluding Guaranteed Student
Loans (GSL), National Direct Stu
dent Loans (NDSL), Supplemen
tal Education Opportunity
Grants (SEOG), Pell Grants,
work-study, and a portion of Cal
Grants.
It is not clear how the law
would be translated onto federal
aid application forms, nor how it
would be enforced. Students
would probably have to indicate
on the forms if they had regis
tered and the forms would then
have to be sent to the SSS for ver
ication. If it cannot be verified,
or if the student answers "no,"
then he will be open to prose
cution, though there may be a
grace period in which he could
register.
"We forsee it as a problem in
terms of processing, it will un
doubtedly cause delays," said
Vince DeAnda, assistant director
of Financial Aids.
The University opposes the
amendment. Vice President for
Public Affairs Bob Rosenzweig
said, "It's not sound public poli
cy to mix conscription and
education." One of the impor
tant lessons which should have
been learned from Vietnam, he
said, is that linking the two pro
duces "maximum dissaffection
and increases antagonism
towards conscription."
But widespread support for
the amendment exists. There is
extensive Congressional back
ing for the measure due to a
"feeling of frustration that non
registrants are getting away with
something," according to Ruth
Flower of the Friends Commit
tee on National Legislation, a
Quaker lobbying group working
against the ammendment.
In a recent editorial support
ing the measure, the San Jose
Mercury said the ammendment
should be passed because "as
long as draft registration is law,
Washington has a responsibilty
to enforce it."
Opponents to the measure
call it an imperfect and dis
criminatory means of enforcing
the law. "It discriminates against
the poor, especially at expensive

colleges, and it discriminates
against men," said Michael
Lighty, a SAC member. It will de
lay processing the aid for 30 to 60
days, he said, and when aid is
given on a first-come, first-serve
basis, men may be denied aid
due to the delay.
Doris Jones, coordinator of
the mid-peninsula People
Against the Draft, called the
amendment "a frantic attempt
to intimidate people." Nico
demus said that it is an imperfect
means of intimidation or en
forcement because not all non
registrants go to college, and of
those who do, not all receive fi
nancial aid.
Nicodemus said SAC and Peo
ple against the Draft are concen
trating on fighting the indict

ments, but that some effort was
being made to lay the
groundwork for opposing the
amendment. This includes or
ganizing press conferences of
non-registrants on financial aid,
their parents, and school admin
istrators; soliciting letters from
school and financial aid adminis
trators; and working with Uni
versity administrators to develop
alternative sources of aid.
Although the University op
poses the measure, it has not said
whether it would replace the lost
aid. Also, local congressman
Tom Lantos (D-San Mateo) has
not yet taken a stand on the is
sue.
Opponents said that the
amendment, if passed into law,
will be challenged in the courts.

;o Federal grand jury handed
Jown the first indictment against
i non-registrant Wednesday and
egislation linking federal finan
:ial aid to registering is expected
0 pass in Congress this month.
In light of the indictment, lo
:al anti-conscription forces held
1 rally yesterday to vocalize sup
)ort for area non-registrants.
About 75 people gathered at
ioon at the Palo Alto post office
to support those who, as one
iign said, "join the people who
won't join the army."
Speakers included non-regis
trants Ben Davidson, Matt Nico
demus, and Russell Ford, as well
as peace activist Claire Smith and
lawyer Dan Mayfield.
Davidson, 19, said that it was a
"struggle not to give in to the
fear generated by smacking up
against the power of the state."
He continued to refuse to reg
ister, he said, because he did not
want to be "processed into a
trained killer."
He said he would not hand
over his decision to die for a
cause to the United States
Armed Forces which "massacres
civilians, helps topple 'unfriend
ly' governments and serves our
dying colonial empire."
Smith, who broke into tears
while she was talking, spoke of
the importance of. giving sup
port to the draft resisters, to not
expect them to be "bionic."
Now that they are being prose
cuted by the courts, she said, it is
important that they know that
they are "not alone in their suf
fering."
In total, it is estimated that
527,000, or about seven percent,
of those required to register
within 30 days of their 18th birth
day have not done so. According
to Nicodemus, the Justice De
partment has a total of 160 names
which it is sending out to local
United States attorneys' offices
t0 begin prosecution. The local
attorney is thought to be acting
°n eight names, he said.
Nicodemus, a member of
Stanford Against Conscription
(SAC), said that as a white
middle-class male, he didn't

have any friends who had done
time, and that he feared the
"permanent changes" prison
might cause in him. He said the
support of the community has
helped him confront the fears of
"doing time."
Ford, from Wesleyan Univer
sity in Connecticut, received
warning letters from the Selec
tive Service System (SSS) and
from his local U.S. attorney.
Also, according to Nicodemus,
the FBI visited his house in Con
necticut three days ago.
Ford said his eyes are too bad
for him to be drafted, but that he
was a public non-registrant be
cause of his "love, respect, and
responsibilty for humanity and
the living planet which is my
home." Facing the prospect of
going to jail is easier knowing
that "there are others out there
who care. I thank you for being
here," Ford said.
Not everyone was supportive.
A woman heckler, passing the
rally in a car, shouted, "Protect
our country, down with all com
mies."
Mayf ield, a member of the Na
tional Lawyers Guild, said "dem
onstrations would defeat the
draft," not legal manuevering.
All 8000 members of the Guild,
formed in the '30s as an alter
native to the American Bar As
sociation, are willing to help
anyone indicted. The national
Committee Against Registration
and the Draft (CARD) and the
Guild are working together to
raise funds to defend anyone
prosecuted, Mayfield said.
"Prosecution is going to be
made as expensive as possible,"
he said.
Partially due to this expense,
and due to the difficulty in track
ing down non-registrants, Sena
tor S.I. Hayakawa (R-Calif.) in
troduced an amendment to the
Defense Authorization Bill
which would deny federal stu
dent aid to men not registered.
The amendment passed the Sen
ate on a voice vote May 10, and a
similar amendment is expected
to be added to the House's de
fense bill this month.
If passed, the law would go
into effect October 1. Thus it
could not change next year's
loans, as they are currently being

processed and will go out in Sep
tember. It would effect all feder
al educational loan programs for
the following year, however, in
cluding Guaranteed Student
Loans (GSL), National Direct Stu
dent Loans (NDSL), Supplemen
tal Education Opportunity
Grants (SEOG), Pell Grants,
work-study, and a portion of Cal
Grants.
It is not clear how the law
would be translated onto federal
aid application forms, nor how it
would be enforced. Students
would probably have to indicate
on the forms if they had regis
tered and the forms would then
have to be sent to the SSS for ver
ication. If it cannot be verified,
or if the student answers "no,"
then he will be open to prose
cution, though there may be a
grace period in which he could
register.
"We forsee it as a problem in
terms of processing, it will un
doubtedly cause delays," said
Vince DeAnda, assistant director
of Financial Aids.
The University opposes the
amendment. Vice President for
Public Affairs Bob Rosenzweig
said, "It's not sound public poli
cy to mix conscription and
education." One of the impor
tant lessons which should have
been learned from Vietnam, he
said, is that linking the two pro
duces "maximum dissaffection
and increases antagonism
towards conscription."
But widespread support for
the amendment exists. There is
extensive Congressional back
ing for the measure due to a
"feeling of frustration that non
registrants are getting away with
something," according to Ruth
Flower of the Friends Commit
tee on National Legislation, a
Quaker lobbying group working
against the ammendment.
In a recent editorial support
ing the measure, the San Jose
Mercury said the ammendment
should be passed because "as
long as draft registration is law,
Washington has a responsibilty
to enforce it."
Opponents to the measure
call it an imperfect and dis
criminatory means of enforcing
the law. "It discriminates against
the poor, especially at expensive

colleges, and it discriminates
against men," said Michael
Lighty, a SAC member. It will de
lay processing the aid for 30 to 60
days, he said, and when aid is
given on a first-come, first-serve
basis, men may be denied aid
due to the delay.
Doris Jones, coordinator of
the mid-peninsula People
Against the Draft, called the
amendment "a frantic attempt
to intimidate people." Nico
demus said that it is an imperfect
means of intimidation or en
forcement because not all non
registrants go to college, and of
those who do, not all receive fi
nancial aid.
Nicodemus said SAC and Peo
ple against the Draft are concen
trating on fighting the indict

ments, but that some effort was
being made to lay the
groundwork for opposing the
amendment. This includes or
ganizing press conferences of
non-registrants on financial aid,
their parents, and school admin
istrators; soliciting letters from
school and financial aid adminis
trators; and working with Uni
versity administrators to develop
alternative sources of aid.
Although the University op
poses the measure, it has not said
whether it would replace the lost
aid. Also, local congressman
Tom Lantos (D-San Mateo) has
not yet taken a stand on the is
sue.
Opponents said that the
amendment, if passed into law,
will be challenged in the courts.
