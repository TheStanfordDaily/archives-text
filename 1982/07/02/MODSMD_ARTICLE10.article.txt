## Lebanese war unfortunate, but necessary 
### 
Those who feel that Israel is in
the way of peace are not reading
their newspapers.
The presence of Israel in the
Levant has been a major factor in
the non-occurrence of wars in
the area. Twice the Kingdom of
Jordan has been threatened with
invasion by Syria. The only rea
son Jordan is not now a Syrian
province is because Israel was
there to stop the advance.
Bordering on Saudi Arabia, Jor
dan is a key separator between a
Soviet satellite and a major oil
supplier. If Syria (or the PLO)
were to overrun Jordan, the im
plications for world oil security
would be serious.
It is far from correct to think
that Israel has been the cause of
most (if not all) of the violence in
the Middle East. Indeed a glance
at the recent history of Israel's
neighbors gives a stark view as to
the region's inherent instablity.
Since Israel's birth in 1948, two
rulers of Egypt have been as
sassinated (Farouk and Sadat);
rulers of Jordan and Saudi Arabia
were assassinated (Abdullah and
Faisal); the current Syrian gov
ernment came to power in a
bloody coup; and the PLO has
assassinated scores of Palestinian
leaders who were willing to ne

gotiate with Israel. All this in
ternal violence has taken place
independent of Israeli policy.
Anyone who believes that if Is
rael would vanish the Middle
East would become an oasis of
Arab brotherhood is completely
mistaken.
The violence Israel does per
petrate is indeed terrible. No Is
raeli is proud of what has been
done to the people in Lebanon.
Yet compared to the actions of
the PLO or the Syrians, only
bearers of the proverbial double
standard can condemn Israel for
the invasion.
The Lebanon invasion has re
sulted in 10,000 dead (by Arab es
timates). Over the past 12 years
the PLO-incited violence has
claimed 100,000 lives.
After the unfortunate destruc
tion of Tyre, Sidon, and other
cities, Israel is helping to rebuild
them. Israeli soldiers are con
structing housing and distribut
ing food to the civilians. Israeli
medics and doctors are giving
medical aid to the wounded.
PLO and Syrian POWs are receiv
ing food from Israeli forces. (All
this is mysteriously absent from
the network news.) After the
PLO leveled a Christian village,
how many victims received aid?

How many Christians have the
Israelis crucified as the PLO has?
Any population that has come
under Israeli control has been
better treated than under a pre
vious government. In 1967, the
Golan Druze Arabs were so
pleased to be rid of Syrian tyran
ny that they put up the first new
border fences. While King
Hussein was massacring the
Palestinians in Jordan, Israel was
busy teaching West Bank Arabs
to read, write, and grow food.
(That is why West Bankers have
the highest literacy rate in the
Middle East.)
Finally, and most importantly,
of all the complaints about Leba
nese suffering, the people who
are not complaining are the Leb
anese themselves. They are
thanking the Israelis for ridding
them of the PLO monsters who
have made their lives miserable.
There was a demonstration in
Los Angeles by Lebanese na
tionals in support of the in
vasion.
One cannot help but also
blame the PLO for the Lebanese
carnage. The PLO's method of
combat is far more animalistic

than it need be. Their soldiers
and artillery are stationed in
crowded refugee camps. Snipers
fire from overcrowded apart
ment buildings. Why are there
5000 PLO guerrillas in civilian
Beirut? The hilly countryside of
Lebanon is ideal for terrorists —
why does the PLO not take ad
vantage of it? Had the PLO
placed its military targets in rural
areas, Beirut would not be in the
condition it is in now.
Israel has always been willing
to negotiate with the Palesti
nians, but not with the PLO. An
independent or autonomous
Palestinian state on the West
Bank will pose a threat not only
to Israel, but to Jordan andSaudi
Arabia. This fact is supported by
the refusal of any Arab country
to host their PLO brothers. With
the PLO's record of silencing dis
senters on the West Bank, one
can be sure that the PLO will kill
more Palestinian civilians than
Israel ever has. Indeed the les
sons from Lebanon must be
clear: a state run by the PLO will
disintegrate into anarchy and vi
olence.
