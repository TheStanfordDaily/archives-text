## 'Daily' misgivings 
### 
Your reporter, Sid Carter,
quotes me as saying that "some
day perhaps 80 percent of the
books used for research here
will come from other institu
tions." Not only didn't I say this,
but it doesn't even make sense.
If Mr. Carter had taken notes
during his conversation with me,
he would have gotten the point
that as much as 80 to 90 percent
of the data with which we
catalog books at Stanford will be
produced at other libraries. This
would indeed be a major saving
for Stanford. We only get 60 to 70

percent now. Annually shipping
hundreds of thousands of books
across the country was not the
idea. The cost of that in postage,
lost time, and frustration would
be very high.
This sort of thing puts an in
terview appointment with a Dai
ly reporter right up there with
waiting for gallbladder surgery;
not the sort of thing one antici
pates without certain misgivings.
It is the third time this year that I
have been substantially mis
quoted.
