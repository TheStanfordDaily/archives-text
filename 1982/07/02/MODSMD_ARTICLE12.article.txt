Whatever it is, let it be known. Submit a column or write a letter to
the Daily. Tell us about anything that's been on your mind. You don't
have to be a professional writer (or even an English major) to get your
work published. And published pieces are great things to send to
your family and friends to prove that you're not wasting your sum
mer away.
Cartoons are welcome, too. Let the artist in you come out for a
while and draw something for the Daily.
Just keep your submissions as brief as possible, and be sure to type,
double spaced, on a 57-space line. Include your name and phone
number, and remember that all articles are subject to editing.
