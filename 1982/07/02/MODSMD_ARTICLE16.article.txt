## 'Barbarosa' is a fine film, if you can find it 'Barbarosa' 
### 
Fred Schepisi won the Austral
ian Film Award for his first fea
ture, The Devil's Playground,
and his second, The Chant of
jimmie Blacksmith, a trenchant
study of racism, was a master
piece. But you may not get to see
his third film, Barbarosa, which
he made in Hollywood a year
and a half ago with Willie Nelson
and Gary Busey, because Uni
versal, unsure about how to pro
mote it, has elected to release it
without advance publicity.
That's true to form for Universal
last year they were so
bewildered by Lamont John
son's affectionate, understated

western Cattle Annie and Little
Britches — one of the handful of
early summer pictures worth
going to — that they dropped it
in the same ignominious way.
Barbarosa, also a western, suffers
from major script problems, but
it has an unusual sly tone and it
grows in the mind after you've
seen it; directed with un
mistakable authority and very
well acted, it deserves to be
seen.
Schepisi experiments with un
conventionally compelling
rhythms in his movies —
Barbarosa may appear leisurely
at first, but it catches up when
you least expect it to. (The tal
ented composer Bruce Smeaton,
who also scored Jimmie Black

smith,, has written music that
helps considerably; he brings
new changes to western motifs.)
Schepisi also has a first-rate com
positional sense and an intuitive
eye for the relationship between
people and their environment.
Like the aborigines in Jimmie
Blacksmith, the characters in
Barbarosa live against huge,
magnificent landscapes that can
both dwarf and define them.
(Watching the chase for Jimmie
Blacksmith, the aborigine who
slaughtered a white family in re
volt against the race from which
he'd been excluded all his life,
you could see how good
Schepisi would be at making
westerns.)
Country like this invites the
building of legends, and
Barbarosa is about one.
Barbarosa (Willie Nelson) is a
white man believed by his
Spanish wife Josephina's family
to be possessed of supernatural
strength and cunning; he keeps
eluding the young men who
have been hunting him for two
decades in revenge for the
deaths of Josephina's brothers
on her wedding night. (The
name "Barbarosa" means "red
beard" in Spanish, and it alludes
to the image his father-in-law
has retained of his appearance
after murdering the youths: his
beard dripped blood.) We don't

discover the actual details of that
story until very late in the film,
and Willie Nelson's per
formance has so many surprises
in it that we're left in suspense
up to that point and even
beyond it. In McCabe and Mrs.
Miller, a bounty hunter (John
Millais) says of McCabe (Warren
Beatty), who has a dangerous
killer's reputation, "That man
never killed anybody," and he
arrives at that decision at almost
exactly the same moment as the
audience does. In Barbarosa,
Nelson tells his newly acquired
sidekick Carl (Gary Busey) the
wedding night tale and asks him
with a chuckle, "Do you believe
that?" The night I saw the film,
two voices from different parts
of the theater answered back,
"Yep."
Nelson approaches his lines
with a gentle modesty, but he
takes the camera with amazing
force, and he has such a sneaky
wit that we're not always sure
when Barbarosa is putting Carl
on. He's wily and crotchety and
soulful, sometimes all at once,
and he does seem unnaturally
strong and elusive. He's also a
master psychologist; there's a
wonderful scene in which he
disarms a pursuer (Danny de la
Paz) just by taunting him. And
Schepisi has a grand time playing
with the idea of Barbarosa as a

mythic figure: when we first see
him, the camera tracks up his
body, beginning at his boots,
and his face is flushed with sun
light; then a stranger shoots
straight at him, but the bullet
grazes him, as if some inner
force had deflected it.
As Carl, a farmer's son who is
also being hunted — by his sis
ter's father-in-law, for acciden
tally killing her husband — Gary
Busey gives a performance of
real depth as well as humor. He's
such a chameleon of an actor
that it's hard to recognize him
from one movie to the next; he
doesn't bear any resemblance
here to the savagely grinning,
frighteningly volatile barker he
played in Carny. And the sup
porting cast is full of pleasantly
familiar faces: George
Voskovec, Isela Vega (the
Spanish star who appeared in
Peckinpah's Bring Me the Head
of Alfredo Garcia), Howland
Chamberlain from High Noon,
and Gilbert Roland, who played
his first romantic leads 55 years
ago and today, at 77, is still a feast
for the camera.
It's a pity that William D.
Witliff's script is so thin, though.
He's seized on a great subject,
but he handles it so flatly that if
an average director had got hold
of it we probably would have

had another Jeremiah Johnson.
Schepisi, thank heaven, is far
from average; there are some
startling images in Barbarosa,
like one of three heads, two
belonging to corpses, sticking
up out of a mound of earth, and
some moving ones, like one of
Busey, his hair grown down to
his shoulders in the months fol
lowing his father's death, work
ing in his garden. Schepisi will
probably have an explosive ca
reer, unless he's continually sab
otaged by stupid distributor 1 ;.
'The Road
Warrior'
The Road Warrior is supposed
to be about a legend, too.
Schepisi's compatriot George
Miller has set his film in the not
too-distant future, when the fuel
shortage has triggered a war and

the survivors wander in bands
searching for gas to keep them
going. The road is more or less
owned by brutal marauders, and
in the course of the film one
"family" enlists the aid of the ti
tle character, Max (Mel Gibson,
of Callipoli), to defeat their
hoodlum adversaries. Max was
the hero of Miller's last picture,
Mad Max, which I didn't see; ap
parently it had a tongue-in
cheek, comic-strip approach to
violence and was reasonably en
tertaining. The Road Warrior is
intended to be funny, too, but
it's difficult to remember that
when you are offered such de
lights as a child throwing a
boomerang into the skull of one
of the attackers. Most of the pic
ture is a long destruction orgy
featuring bows and arrows and
cannon-sized flame throwers.
Miller is not without talent, and
there are moments of apocalyp
tic glory in Dean Semmler's pho
tography, but the movie's single
mindedness makes a viewer

want to throw something. The
picture has the nerve to turn
self-righteous in the last third;
there are few things more ludi
crous than listening to lectures
on survival and despair from
characters who are dressed like
medieval punkneanderthalsand
whose previous dialogue con
sisted largely of grunts and
screams. The Road Warriors was
advertised as a cult classic before
it had even been released in
most cities; a quick death at the
box office would be poetic jus
tice, I think.
