# Kihn sits back and relaxes with 'Kihntinued'
## 
### Stefan Malmoli The Greg Kihn Band Kihntinued Beserkley Records 
Remember Greg Kihn's last
LP? Remember it was the one
with the clever title, RocK
ihnßoll? Remember all those re
ally exciting rockers that it had,
including "The Break-up Song"
and "Sheila?" Remember how
after years of being a Bay Area fa
vorite, it looked like Kihn and his
band were on the verge of na
tionwide success? Remember
how he put on that excellent
free concert at Stanford in Frost
Amphitheatre one year ago?
Now that you've recalled all of
these things, try not to forget
them when you listen to his new
album, Kihntinued. As the title
suggests, this new album was in
tended to be a continuation of
thejype of songs that had domi
nated Kihn's last album. The cov
er of this record sports the same
New Wavey, collage-type cover
as RocKihnßoll did, and it
seemed as if a true continuation
of the music would also take
place. However, whereas the last
LP was exciting, fresh and vital,
this one is subdued, shallow and

simple. Greg Kihn should have
called this album Kihnservative
because he takes no chances at
all on the album. On the last
album, Kihn was adventurous
and fighting to break out na
tionally. Here, he seems to have
stopped fighting in favor of
playing it safe.
Of course, "playing it safe"
may result in success in terms of
sales, but it is a disappointment
to his longtime Bay Area fans
who have seen him become
more proficient with each LP.
This album sounds very for
mulaic, and it lacks the ori
ginality that his previous album
had displayed. Instead, by being
musically conservative, the new
album contains nothing as out
standing as, say, "The Break-up
Song" or even the older "Desire
Me." The songs do not get you
moving like the last one did, and
on this album, there are even a
few duds (like "Tell Me Lies.")
The basic problem is the or
dinary sound of most of the
songs. It seems as if Kihn and the
band spent too little time writing
and performing songs that they
are capable of. They seem to
have opted for the easiest and
simplest method to attain suc

cess. The "simple" structure of
these songs is reflected in the
relatively short and simple song
titles prevalent on this album.
Such titles as "Happy Man" or
"Family" lack any of the ironic or

provocative meaning of pre
vious songtitles like "The Girl
Most Likely," "Madison Avenue
Man" or "Can't Stop Hurtin'
Myself" had contained. In com
parison with his older songs,
these new titles are pretty in
sipid.
Musically, though, the for
mula sound is the album's main
weakness. On potentially inspir
ing rockers like "Happy Man"
and "Everyday/Saturday," Kihn
strives for a Bruce Springsteen
like sound. However, the songs
sound more like Rick Spring
field. These songs never really go
anywhere, and Kihn cannot
seem to make up his mind as to
what he wants to sound like.
Even when he tries to sound like
himself, the results are deficient
in quality. The song "Dedi
cation" is a poor remaking of his
own songs "Secret Meetings"
and "Womankind." Kihn sounds
confused (Kihnfused) on almost
all of side one and if not for "Ev
ery Love Song" side one would
be a total failure. This song is the
album's high point, as it in
corporates a slow rocking beat
with reggae overtones. Included
in the song is a surprisingly good


Greg Kihn
saxophone solo that shows that
the group is still capable of con
quering new musical territory, if
it so chooses.
Luckily, though, the overall
failure of side one is partially re
deemed by the more uptempo
second side. On this side, Kihn
comes up with some good Tom
Petty-type rockers like "Testify"
and "Seeing Is Believing." Both
of these tunes show off the
band's appeal, which is lacking
on side one. This side also con
tains a splendid remake of Jackie
Wilson's classic "Higher and
Higher" (which is incidentally by
the band's drummer, Larry
Lynch). With "Higher and
Higher," Kihn and the band
finally break out of the narrow
restraints that they have set upon
themselves for the majority of
this album. The infectious beat
and vocal of this song recalls the
fun and fresh aspects of rock and
roll that most of this album lacks.

Hopefully, this may be a harb
inger that the next album will be
more of a true continuation of
RocKihnßoll than Kihntinued is.
Finally, although this album
may be a setback musically for
Greg Kihn, he should not be for
gotten. His live show is con
tinually improving as he gains
more experience and con
fidence. Maybe the songs on this
album will gain the extra
strength and depth that they
need in live performance. Kihn's
just played his cards wrong on
this album in his attempt to gain
nationwide success, and there
fore, I think that a newer, more
intriguing album will be quick in
coming. As he sings in "Happy
Man," "I'm gonna be a happy
man " His outlook for the future
is optimistic. And if Greg Kihn
really is intent on becoming a
happy man musically, he'll re
turn to what he is truly capable
of — which is rock(Kihn)rolling.

himself, the results are deficient
in quality. The song "Dedi
cation" is a poor remaking of his
own songs "Secret Meetings"
and "Womankind." Kihn sounds
confused (Kihnfused) on almost
all of side one and if not for "Ev
ery Love Song" side one would
be a total failure. This song is the
album's high point, as it in
corporates a slow rocking beat
with reggae overtones. Included
in the song is a surprisingly good


Greg Kihn
saxophone solo that shows that
the group is still capable of con
quering new musical territory, if
it so chooses.
Luckily, though, the overall
failure of side one is partially re
deemed by the more uptempo
second side. On this side, Kihn
comes up with some good Tom
Petty-type rockers like "Testify"
and "Seeing Is Believing." Both
of these tunes show off the
band's appeal, which is lacking
on side one. This side also con
tains a splendid remake of Jackie
Wilson's classic "Higher and
Higher" (which is incidentally by
the band's drummer, Larry
Lynch). With "Higher and
Higher," Kihn and the band
finally break out of the narrow
restraints that they have set upon
themselves for the majority of
this album. The infectious beat
and vocal of this song recalls the
fun and fresh aspects of rock and
roll that most of this album lacks.

Hopefully, this may be a harb
inger that the next album will be
more of a true continuation of
RocKihnßoll than Kihntinued is.
Finally, although this album
may be a setback musically for
Greg Kihn, he should not be for
gotten. His live show is con
tinually improving as he gains
more experience and con
fidence. Maybe the songs on this
album will gain the extra
strength and depth that they
need in live performance. Kihn's
just played his cards wrong on
this album in his attempt to gain
nationwide success, and there
fore, I think that a newer, more
intriguing album will be quick in
coming. As he sings in "Happy
Man," "I'm gonna be a happy
man " His outlook for the future
is optimistic. And if Greg Kihn
really is intent on becoming a
happy man musically, he'll re
turn to what he is truly capable
of — which is rock(Kihn)rolling.
Remember Greg Kihn's last
LP? Remember it was the one
with the clever title, RocK
ihnßoll? Remember all those re
ally exciting rockers that it had,
including "The Break-up Song"
and "Sheila?" Remember how
after years of being a Bay Area fa
vorite, it looked like Kihn and his
band were on the verge of na
tionwide success? Remember
how he put on that excellent
free concert at Stanford in Frost
Amphitheatre one year ago?
Now that you've recalled all of
these things, try not to forget
them when you listen to his new
album, Kihntinued. As the title
suggests, this new album was in
tended to be a continuation of
thejype of songs that had domi
nated Kihn's last album. The cov
er of this record sports the same
New Wavey, collage-type cover
as RocKihnßoll did, and it
seemed as if a true continuation
of the music would also take
place. However, whereas the last
LP was exciting, fresh and vital,
this one is subdued, shallow and

simple. Greg Kihn should have
called this album Kihnservative
because he takes no chances at
all on the album. On the last
album, Kihn was adventurous
and fighting to break out na
tionally. Here, he seems to have
stopped fighting in favor of
playing it safe.
Of course, "playing it safe"
may result in success in terms of
sales, but it is a disappointment
to his longtime Bay Area fans
who have seen him become
more proficient with each LP.
This album sounds very for
mulaic, and it lacks the ori
ginality that his previous album
had displayed. Instead, by being
musically conservative, the new
album contains nothing as out
standing as, say, "The Break-up
Song" or even the older "Desire
Me." The songs do not get you
moving like the last one did, and
on this album, there are even a
few duds (like "Tell Me Lies.")
The basic problem is the or
dinary sound of most of the
songs. It seems as if Kihn and the
band spent too little time writing
and performing songs that they
are capable of. They seem to
have opted for the easiest and
simplest method to attain suc

cess. The "simple" structure of
these songs is reflected in the
relatively short and simple song
titles prevalent on this album.
Such titles as "Happy Man" or
"Family" lack any of the ironic or

provocative meaning of pre
vious songtitles like "The Girl
Most Likely," "Madison Avenue
Man" or "Can't Stop Hurtin'
Myself" had contained. In com
parison with his older songs,
these new titles are pretty in
sipid.
Musically, though, the for
mula sound is the album's main
weakness. On potentially inspir
ing rockers like "Happy Man"
and "Everyday/Saturday," Kihn
strives for a Bruce Springsteen
like sound. However, the songs
sound more like Rick Spring
field. These songs never really go
anywhere, and Kihn cannot
seem to make up his mind as to
what he wants to sound like.
Even when he tries to sound like
himself, the results are deficient
in quality. The song "Dedi
cation" is a poor remaking of his
own songs "Secret Meetings"
and "Womankind." Kihn sounds
confused (Kihnfused) on almost
all of side one and if not for "Ev
ery Love Song" side one would
be a total failure. This song is the
album's high point, as it in
corporates a slow rocking beat
with reggae overtones. Included
