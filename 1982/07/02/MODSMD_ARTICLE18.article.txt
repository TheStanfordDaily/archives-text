SAY, WELCOME.
Tracy Kidder's book The Soul
of a New Machine is about those
bad guys, the upstarts of the
computer industry, and one of
the machines they tried to build.
Winner of the 1981 Pulitzer Prize
for non-fiction and the 1981
American Book Award, the book
is a timely and well-written text
on computers and small, fast
moving companies like Data
General, whose machines are
used everyday in banks and su
permarkets, mostly by people
who don't even know they're us
ing them.
More importantly, however,
Kidder's book is a careful study
of the psychology of the group
of engineers who made the pa
per "Eagle," as it was called, into
a living being of wire and plastic.
The world of microcomputing,
we find, is unexpectedly rich in

imagery and those beautiful, ab
stract concepts engineers wake
up thinking about: perfectly
rounded numbers, minutes split
and stretched into nanoseconds,
regressions into infinity.
Kidder himself is swayed by
this prose of numbers. Writing
about the fast-paced jokes at the
end of a Friday afternoon meet
ing, he observes: "They did do
some business, using the beau
tiful and, to me, inscrutable lan
guage of the microelectronic
era: hexaddresses, default redix,
floating-point mantissas, swap
bites, sys log, sim dot, scratch
pad." To be sure, too much of
this would be a confusing mess
of syllables — but .this is more
than a book about the mysteries
of lingo. What drives these engi
neers? How do they define suc
cess? Why do they give up family
and friends to work without ov
ertime pay on a machine none of
them are sure will work? Kidder
takes up all of these questions, in
an ambitious and largely suc
cessful book that lies some
where between science and lit
erature.
Kidder descended into the
dimly-lit basement of Data Gen
eral in 1979 to observe a team of
engineers build what was later

called the Eclipse MV/8000, a 32-
bit computer which would oper
ate faster and with a larger mem
ory bank than the 16-bit com
puters then on the market. Data
General's old version of the
Eclipse was being quickly out
moded by the VAX 11/780, a
model put out by Data General's
arch-competitors, Digital Equip
ment Corporation (DEC).
Data General, for reasons of
pride and financial solvency,
needed a new machine. Their
push to put out a new computer
was in fact something of a
grudge match against DEC,
besides being economically im
perative.
De Castro and two other
young engineers had left DEC in
1968 under circumstances Kid
der never makes completely
clear, in order to form their own
company. They took with them
the design for a new computer
that was to secure their entry
into the field of micro
computers, the best-selling
NOVA.
In an industry that turns out
new computers as fast as GM
turns out cars, engineers are still
talking about the simplicity and
elegance of the NOVA, a ma
chine DEC hated to lose. So the

appearance in 1978 of DEC's new
32-bit machine was, to the en
terprising engineers at Data
General, an upset. Suddenly, the
whiz kids had fallen behind. The
job of Tom West, leader of the
Eclipse group, was to engineer a
comeback: "We're gonna get
schmeared," he tells Kidder, "if
we don't react to VAX."
Data General, Kidder notes,
ran lean and mean. It paid low
starting salaries, no dividends,
and gave rewards in the form of
more company stock. Offices
were usually windowless, door
less, and separated by five-and
a-half foot walls that didn't even
reach to the ceiling. De Castro
had in fact ordered the plant to
be designed by his own engi
neers, just to ensure a minimum
in design costs. Herb Richman,
one of the founders of the firm
and head of the sales force, ex
plained their outlook: "We con
sider ourselves the Robert Hall
of the computer industry." At
Data General there were no
frills, no fooling around, the
company was animated by a sin
gle-minded drive for perfection,
efficiency, and the lowest price,
not necessarily in that order.
Small wonder, then, that the
Data General plant, deceptively

tucked in the quiet woods of
central Massachusetts, nonethe
less hummed with a rough and
jocular energy, a look-out-for
the-little-guy machismo. Kid
der's prose accordingly reflects
the quick, charged atmosphere
in which the new machine is
built.
Analogies to the heroic
abound in The Soul of a New
Machine: "Some computer en
gineers harbor strong feelings
towards their new designs, like
Cossacks towards their horses,"
Kidder writes, describing the
dedication of a young computer
programmer. Even the chapter
titles — "The Wars," "Flying Up
side Down," "The Last Crunch"
— foster a feeling of troops mass
ing for combat.
Indeed, an aura of secrecy and
special knowledge sets the
Eclipse team apart. They are hid
den away in the poorly-ven
tilated basement of Data Gener
al. They are almost all men; they
are all white; and half of them,
including one woman, have
been hired fresh out of the finest
schools of computerscience and
electrical engineering in the
country just to work on "la ma
chine," as Ed Rasala, one of
West's lieutenants, calls it.
Locker room language occa
sionally surfaces among mem
bers of the team: "We're trying
to maximize the win, and make
Eagle go as fast as a raped ape,"
West grins in one peculiarly
crude moment.
All for relatively low pay, 60-
hour-plus work weeks, no
chance to make friends or even
to have a healthy amount of free
time until the project is over and
always, in the back of the mind,
the pressure to get the machine
done, to get it perfect. Not just
anybody's idea of fun. But if her
oism is properly defined as ardor
in the face of laughable odds,
then building the Eclipse is in
deed another chapter in the an
nals of that continuing story. At
least Ed Rasala thinks so. "Maybe
it's masochism," he tells Kidder.
"I was looking for.. .opportuni
ty, responsibility, visibility ... I
wanted to see what I was worth."
But what was so special about
this machine? What made the
Eclipse different than the usual
next-year, next-model product?
What Tom West and Data
General's engineers proposed to
do was to bring the Eclipse, in
record time, into "32-bithood"
— an expanded version of its
former 16-bit self, with greatly
increased speed and memory
capacities.
A 16-bit computer — the kind
most businesses bought, until
Eclipse and its counterparts ap
peared — could store 65,536
pieces of information, enough
for most business purposes. But
soon consumers were demand
ing more memory space, and a
quicker machine.
Enter Eclipse, a 32-bit machine
capable of some four billion
memory slots. But the machine
also had to be tamper-proof,
safe from computer thieves who
might try to gain access to valu
able records. So West's crew had
to devise a way of protecting the
memory bank from in
terference. And the machine
had to be relatively inexpensive
and easy to maintain.
Ail of this would have been
hard to produce in any amount
of time, but West wanted to do it

in a year, a nearly impossible
goal, according to Kidder. "The
win was the object of all this
sport and the big win was some
thing that could be achieved by
maximizing the smaller one,"
Kidder writes defining some of
the words West and his engi
neers grew fond of during this
period.
It takes West and his team 20
months to build the Eclipse. Dur
ing that time, Kidder writes, the
engineers grow more in
terdependent, more obsessed
with their work. Verbal ex
changes become quick, idi
omatic, quirky. "What goes on
here is not part of the real
world," says West. "The lan
guage is different." Kidder finds
himself in a world he must con
stantly interpret into more famil
iar terms. Many words are odd
but delightfully descriptive.
Kidder compiles a dictionary
of computer lingo: "ECO —
each letter pronounced —
meant 'engineering change or
der.' Hence this remark: 'A
friend of mine told his girl friend
they had to ECO their rela
tionship.' 'Give me a core dump'
meant 'tell me your thoughts/
for in the past, when computers
used 'core memories,'engineers
sometimes 'dumped' the con
tents of malfunctioning ma
chines' storage compartments to
see what was wrong."
Another favorite is "kludge,"
which is destined to become
part of the general vocabulary:
"the most disdainful term ... a
machine with wires hanging out
of it, (something) fastened to
gether with adhesive tape." All
of us botch things, occasionally.
Now we end up with a word.
Kidder is introduced to the
imaginative side of computer
programming by Alsing, who
shows him how to play the fan
tasy-game of Adventure one
night on his office terminal.
At first the game is tricky and
fun. Kidder travels through an
imaginary landscape of rusted
doors, pirate ships and vending
machines that contain batteries
for the flashlight he needs to find
his way out. The terminal flashes
a message: YOU ARE IN A MAZE
OF TWISTY LITTLE PASSAGES,

ALL DIFFERENT. Kidder grows
worried. He tries to puzzle a way
out, and then the machine
flashes again: YOU ARE IN A
MAZE OF TWISTY LITTLE PAS
SAGES, ALL ALIKE. Things look
worse. But Kidder keeps playing,
experiencing for the first time,
although he does not know it,
symptoms of one of the occupa
tional hazards of the computer
engineer: an addiction to mid
night programming.
In the face of such complexity,
it's no surprise that engineers
come to humanize their instru
ments. Alsing explains, "A lot of
people are really tired of an
thropomorphizing computers,
but it sure is an easy way to talk
about them ... It presents a face,
a person to me — a person in a
thousand different ways."
Eclipse, however, is not always
kind to its makers. As months of
sweat and worry go by and the
machine refuses, for inscrutable
reasons ot its own, to work prop
erly, tempers flare and fatigue
sets in. "I wanted to see how
complicated things happen,"
says West, explaining his drive to
build the machine. "There's
some notion of control, it seems
to me, that you can derive in a
world of confusion."
But the confusion proved to
be too much for some. Kidder
tells the story of Josh Rosen, one
of the team's smartest engineers,
who finally quit one day, leaving
a note on his terminal that read:
"I'm going to a commune in Ver
mont and will deal with no unit
of time shorter than a season."
Unlike Rosen, Kidder man
aged to last through the final,
fretful months of debugging the
machine.
Unfortunately, there are a few
flaws Kidder didn't clear up. Kid
der's great strength as a writer —
and ironically, his great
weakness — comes from his abil
ity to completely immerse
himself in the lives of the people
he observes, to g've himself over
to their hopes ai d fears. In this
way Kidder outwrites Tom
Wolfe, who in The Right Stuff
tried to do for NASA what Kid
der accomplishes for DEC and
Data General.
However, somewhere along

his descent into the labyrinthine
labs, Kidder loses his repertorial
instincts. Too many quotes are
casually ascribed, to "observers
of the industry" or an
amorphous "middle-level ex
ecutive" — if Kidder names all
the engineers sweating down in
the basement, why can't he be
more specific about the higher
ups? — Kidder also quotes, at
some length, a financial analyst
who wishes to remain anony
mous. Similar observations —
they aren't really all that sophis
ticated — might easily have been
corroborated by someone who
would have agreed to see his
name in print.
Nagging doubts about the
book's substantiation are not re
lieved by its lack of a biblio
graphy, ifidex, or even pictures
of the faces and machines at
Data General. And Kidder fails to
provide even first-quarter sales
figures fdr the Eclipse, which was
publicly introduced on April 29,
1980. Beyond a vague "rumor"
that the machine would account
for 10 percent of Data General's
early 1981 sales, we aren't told

about the machine's success or
failure. This is an important
omission, given that Data Gener
al, whose 1981 sales, according
to Forbes' annual survey, are
barely V« those of DEC, needed a
best-seller to remain a strong
contender in the market. The
lack of proper documentation is
surprising for a writer of Kidder's
caliber — and for the editors of
the Atlantic who published Kid
der's book and serialized por
tions of it in their magazine.
But those are small bugs —
"flakeys," as the engineers
would call them — in a book that
does so much to open a passage
into the culture of com
puterland, a country that for
most of us is still foreign and ex
clusive. If reading The Soul of a
New Machine doesn't inspire
you to run out and buy a maga
zine such as Byte or a Nybblevr
even a whole Apple for your
very own, at least you'll realize
they're there, part of a world of
computers quietly humming be
neath the more apparent world,
in which we live.
