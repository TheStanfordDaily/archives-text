SAY, WELCOME.
Tracy Kidder's book The Soul
of a New Machine is about those
bad guys, the upstarts of the
computer industry, and one of
the machines they tried to build.
Winner of the 1981 Pulitzer Prize
for non-fiction and the 1981
American Book Award, the book
is a timely and well-written text
on computers and small, fast
moving companies like Data
General, whose machines are
used everyday in banks and su
permarkets, mostly by people
who don't even know they're us
ing them.
More importantly, however,
Kidder's book is a careful study
of the psychology of the group
of engineers who made the pa
per "Eagle," as it was called, into
a living being of wire and plastic.
The world of microcomputing,
we find, is unexpectedly rich in

imagery and those beautiful, ab
stract concepts engineers wake
up thinking about: perfectly
rounded numbers, minutes split
and stretched into nanoseconds,
regressions into infinity.
Kidder himself is swayed by
this prose of numbers. Writing
about the fast-paced jokes at the
end of a Friday afternoon meet
ing, he observes: "They did do
some business, using the beau
tiful and, to me, inscrutable lan
guage of the microelectronic
era: hexaddresses, default redix,
floating-point mantissas, swap
bites, sys log, sim dot, scratch
pad." To be sure, too much of
this would be a confusing mess
of syllables — but .this is more
than a book about the mysteries
of lingo. What drives these engi
neers? How do they define suc
cess? Why do they give up family
and friends to work without ov
ertime pay on a machine none of
them are sure will work? Kidder
takes up all of these questions, in
an ambitious and largely suc
cessful book that lies some
where between science and lit
erature.
Kidder descended into the
dimly-lit basement of Data Gen
eral in 1979 to observe a team of
engineers build what was later

called the Eclipse MV/8000, a 32-
bit computer which would oper
ate faster and with a larger mem
ory bank than the 16-bit com
puters then on the market. Data
General's old version of the
Eclipse was being quickly out
moded by the VAX 11/780, a
model put out by Data General's
arch-competitors, Digital Equip
ment Corporation (DEC).
Data General, for reasons of
pride and financial solvency,
needed a new machine. Their
push to put out a new computer
was in fact something of a
grudge match against DEC,
besides being economically im
perative.
De Castro and two other
young engineers had left DEC in
1968 under circumstances Kid
der never makes completely
clear, in order to form their own
company. They took with them
the design for a new computer
that was to secure their entry
into the field of micro
computers, the best-selling
NOVA.
In an industry that turns out
new computers as fast as GM
turns out cars, engineers are still
talking about the simplicity and
elegance of the NOVA, a ma
chine DEC hated to lose. So the

appearance in 1978 of DEC's new
32-bit machine was, to the en
terprising engineers at Data
General, an upset. Suddenly, the
whiz kids had fallen behind. The
job of Tom West, leader of the
Eclipse group, was to engineer a
comeback: "We're gonna get
schmeared," he tells Kidder, "if
we don't react to VAX."
Data General, Kidder notes,
ran lean and mean. It paid low
starting salaries, no dividends,
and gave rewards in the form of
more company stock. Offices
were usually windowless, door
less, and separated by five-and
a-half foot walls that didn't even
reach to the ceiling. De Castro
had in fact ordered the plant to
be designed by his own engi
neers, just to ensure a minimum
in design costs. Herb Richman,
one of the founders of the firm
and head of the sales force, ex
plained their outlook: "We con
sider ourselves the Robert Hall
of the computer industry." At
Data General there were no
frills, no fooling around, the
company was animated by a sin
gle-minded drive for perfection,
efficiency, and the lowest price,
not necessarily in that order.
Small wonder, then, that the
Data General plant, deceptively

tucked in the quiet woods of
central Massachusetts, nonethe
less hummed with a rough and
jocular energy, a look-out-for
the-little-guy machismo. Kid
der's prose accordingly reflects
the quick, charged atmosphere
in which the new machine is
built.
Analogies to the heroic
abound in The Soul of a New
Machine: "Some computer en
gineers harbor strong feelings
towards their new designs, like
Cossacks towards their horses,"
Kidder writes, describing the
dedication of a young computer
programmer. Even the chapter
titles — "The Wars," "Flying Up
side Down," "The Last Crunch"
— foster a feeling of troops mass
ing for combat.
Indeed, an aura of secrecy and
special knowledge sets the
Eclipse team apart. They are hid
den away in the poorly-ven
tilated basement of Data Gener
al. They are almost all men; they
are all white; and half of them,
including one woman, have
been hired fresh out of the finest
schools of computerscience and
electrical engineering in the
country just to work on "la ma
chine," as Ed Rasala, one of
