Mr. Smith Goes to Washing
ton it-k-kV.2
Wednesday, 7 p.m., Geology
Corner Room 320
James Stewart stars as Jefferson
Smith, a mild-mannered scout
master who is appointed a sena
tor to fill an unexpired term.
When he arrives in Washington it
becomes apparent he was chosen
not for his talent but for his
naivete; he's the perfect man, it's
been decided, to act as a front for
corrupt schemes. What those
who got him appointed hadn't
accounted for was Smith's inte
grity.
Frank Capra directed this ail-
American comedy/melodrama.
Though the movie falls apart at
the very end — when Claude
Rains' corrupt senator has an in
explicable change of heart — for
the most part it's beautifully
tuned and very affecting. Stewart
is utterly convincing as Smith;
Jean Arthur co-stars.
— Jim Mattson
E.T. — The Extraterrestrial
★★★★
E.T. begins where Steven
(Spielberg's Close Encounters
peaked — with the descent of an
alien craft — and gets better and
better from there. It's an
absolutely entrancing movie — a
miracle. This tale of a benevolent,
childlike alien's adventure on
1 feelings, and the result is a movie
and shot by Philippe Rousselot, is
farfetched that it acquires its own

logic. It revolves around the fixa
tion of Jules, a young mailman
(Frederic Andrei) for a black op
era singer (Wilhelmenia Wiggins
Fernandez). The singer never
records, but Jules manages to
record one of her concerts.
When that tape becomes
switched with a recording of an
expose by the mistress of a vice
chief, the movie slips into its own
giddy self-consciousness.
— S.V.
Star Trek II
Palo Alto Square
An ertjoyably dopey movie,
which strolls fearlessly down the
dark corridor that lies between
pretentiousness and utter
absurdity. Most of the cast of the
'60s television series is back. The
characters have been given pro
motions (except, rather upset
tingly, Uhura, who's still in her
old position of hyper-space sec
retary), but the dialogue they
speak is still as weirdly stilted as
ever. Nicholas Meyer, who
directed the often charming sci
ence fantasy Time After Time, is
at the helm, and does a good job
of keeping things moving fast
enough so the movie never really
grates on you.

Fox, Redwood City
Alfred Hitchcock capped his
string of British masterpieces with
without a trace. As they search for
her, they stumble onto far greater
the film, which, on the'strictest

narrative level, are absurd, seem
perfectly reasonable when
viewed on the film's own terms.
Ballard has lived up to his prom
ise with a work of striking, and
strikingly beautiful, imagery.
A boy and a horse are both
shipwrecked on a desert island;
when the child is rescued, he re
fuses to leave without the animal.
Returned to civilization, both
must learn to live in what has be
come an alien landscape.
Children's matinee this Satur

Park Theater, Menlo Park
This movie is terribly efficient
— it gets to you — but I didn't
have much fun at it. I felt bar
raged by all the closeups and the
DOlby sound from the beginning,
long before the ghosts took over.
The film is so loud and relentless
throughout that it doesn't have
anywhere to go but straight to Its
rather ludicrous big finish, with
skeletons popping up all over the
neighborhood and houses flam
ing and folding. The film's main
bright spots come not through
the speciai effects but through
the actors. Jobeth Williams is
touchingly earnest as the per
sistent, loving mother, and Zelda
Rubenstein brings such an un
usual, quicksilver charm to her
role of medium-for-hire that she
nearly redeems the most self-se
rious scenes. /

Poltergeist ★*
Park Theater, Menlo Park
This movie is terribly efficient
— it gets to you — but I didn't
have much fun at it. I felt bar
raged by all the closeups and the
DOlby sound from the beginning,
long before the ghosts took over.
The film is so loud and relentless
throughout that it doesn't have
anywhere to go but straight to Its
rather ludicrous big finish, with
skeletons popping up all over the
neighborhood and houses flam
ing and folding. The film's main
bright spots come not through
the speciai effects but through
the actors. Jobeth Williams is
touchingly earnest as the per
sistent, loving mother, and Zelda
Rubenstein brings such an un
usual, quicksilver charm to her
role of medium-for-hire that she
nearly redeems the most self-se
rious scenes. /

American schlock cinema at its
artistic height. Rock'n'Roll High
School is a must-see film about
the glory and energy of high
school revolution. This sleazy lit
tle musical brims with vitality,
verb, and the punk-rock music of
the Ramones. The indomitable
P.J. Soles is featured.
Late show Saturday night.

Mr. Smith Goes to Washing
ton it-k-kV.2
Wednesday, 7 p.m., Geology
Corner Room 320
James Stewart stars as Jefferson
Smith, a mild-mannered scout
master who is appointed a sena
tor to fill an unexpired term.
When he arrives in Washington it
becomes apparent he was chosen
not for his talent but for his
naivete; he's the perfect man, it's
been decided, to act as a front for
corrupt schemes. What those
who got him appointed hadn't
accounted for was Smith's inte
grity.
Frank Capra directed this ail-
American comedy/melodrama.
Though the movie falls apart at
the very end — when Claude
Rains' corrupt senator has an in
explicable change of heart — for
the most part it's beautifully
tuned and very affecting. Stewart
is utterly convincing as Smith;
Jean Arthur co-stars.

E.T. — The Extraterrestrial
★★★★
E.T. begins where Steven
(Spielberg's Close Encounters
peaked — with the descent of an
alien craft — and gets better and
better from there. It's an
absolutely entrancing movie — a
miracle. This tale of a benevolent,
childlike alien's adventure on
1 feelings, and the result is a movie
and shot by Philippe Rousselot, is
farfetched that it acquires its own

logic. It revolves around the fixa
tion of Jules, a young mailman
(Frederic Andrei) for a black op
era singer (Wilhelmenia Wiggins
Fernandez). The singer never
records, but Jules manages to
record one of her concerts.
When that tape becomes
switched with a recording of an
expose by the mistress of a vice
chief, the movie slips into its own
giddy self-consciousness.

Star Trek II
Palo Alto Square
An ertjoyably dopey movie,
which strolls fearlessly down the
dark corridor that lies between
pretentiousness and utter
absurdity. Most of the cast of the
'60s television series is back. The
characters have been given pro
motions (except, rather upset
tingly, Uhura, who's still in her
old position of hyper-space sec
retary), but the dialogue they
speak is still as weirdly stilted as
ever. Nicholas Meyer, who
directed the often charming sci
ence fantasy Time After Time, is
at the helm, and does a good job
of keeping things moving fast
enough so the movie never really
grates on you.

The lady Vanishes
Fox, Redwood City
Alfred Hitchcock capped his
string of British masterpieces with
without a trace. As they search for
her, they stumble onto far greater
the film, which, on the'strictest

narrative level, are absurd, seem
perfectly reasonable when
viewed on the film's own terms.
Ballard has lived up to his prom
ise with a work of striking, and
strikingly beautiful, imagery.
A boy and a horse are both
shipwrecked on a desert island;
when the child is rescued, he re
fuses to leave without the animal.
Returned to civilization, both
must learn to live in what has be
come an alien landscape.
