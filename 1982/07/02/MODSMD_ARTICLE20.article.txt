the shots on foreign policy and "there is going to be no

But the president again declined to discuss the reasons

people had been told everything about it that they
needed to know.
Reagan disputed suggestions that the United States
knew in advance of Israel's invasion of Lebanon and ap
proved of it.

Botulism case prompts search
Sacramento — A case of human botulism in Stockton
set off a search yesterday for cans of tomatoes like the
one believed to be responsible, the state reported.
Department of Health Services information officer
Beverly Powell said a 41-year-old woman fell ill after tast
ing some of the product straight out of the can while
making a sauce. The sauce was cooked, so members of
her family who ate it were not affected. The woman was

recovering yesterday in a Stockton hospital.
Powell said state and county officials are trying to
locate the rest of a single lot of Progresso Italian-Style
Peeled Tomatoes With Basil, 28-ounce cans. The individ
ual cans from the lot bear embossed markings on the lids
or bottoms as follows: XPPJS over D 1928. The cans show
no swelling or other signs of abnormality.
The product was packed for Progresso by Tillie Lewis
Foods of Stockton, which is cooperating in the search,
Powell said.
