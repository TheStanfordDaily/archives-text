Tuesday's Daily incorrectly stated that STARTS jazz
workshops will be held in Dinkelspiel Auditorium Thurs
day nights. The lectures are in the Tresidder large
lounge.

"Wine" not go on the Daily trip to Napa Saturday July
10? The Photo Department, as always led by the infamous
James Higa, is sponsoring the winetasting trip. Mary
Rose's house is sponsoring a party afterward. Meet at the
Daily at 10:30 a.m. Friends are welcome too.
