# Heart-lung patient dies during surgery
## 
### 
The Medical Center's sev
enth heart-lung transplant at
tempt failed last Saturday. Joe
McDermott, 22, was the first
patient to die while under
going the operation.
Dr. Stuart Jamieson, assis
tant professor of
cardiovascular surgery and at
tending physician during the
eight-hour operation, said
the new lungs "failed for an as
yet unknown cause."
An autopsy was conducted
Sunday but "the results are
not through yet," said
Jamieson. "It's quite possible
they won't give us any de
finitive answer," he said. "It's
often very difficult to under
stand mechanisms," he said.
"We are of course some
what dismayed by it but it
won't stop us," Jamieson
added.
According to Jamieson,
who has taken over the heart
lung transplant program from
Dr. Bruce Reitz, now chief of
cardiac surgery at Johns
Hopkins, failure of donor or
gans poses a remote but ever
present possibility during
transplant surgery.
The first of Stanford's six
previous heart-lung trans

plants was performed March
9,1981, on a 45 year-old wom
an, Mary Gohlke.
Four of the first six trans
plant patients have returned
to active lives.
Two female recipients died
soon after their operations.
Karen Wilson, 27, died several
days after her July 28, 1981
surgery when scar tissue from
previous open heart surgery
resulted in excessive bleed
ing. Nancy Lassen, 27, the
most recent heart-lung trans
plant patient, died February
12 after slipping into a coma.
Her autopsy has been in
conclusive, said Jamieson.
The discovery of
Cyclosporin A, a fungal de
rivative, has made successful
heart lung transplants pos
sible by reducing the body's
tendency to fight off or reject
foreign tissue. Previously
used drugs had prevented the
windpipe from healing. Con
sequently, heart-lung trans
plant attempts between 1968
and 1971 resulted in a survival
rate of no longer than 23 days.
A memorial service for
McDermott was held Tuesday
at Memorial Church.
