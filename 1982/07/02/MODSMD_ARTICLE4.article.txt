## Partial withdrawal of troops possible in Cambodia 
### Agence France-Presse 
Hanoi — Vietnam and Cambodia might
announce a unilateral partial withdrawal
of Vietnamese troops from Cambodia
during the Indochinese foreign ministers'
confernce early next month, diplomatic
observers said here Wednesday.
Neither the place nor the date of the
conference, the sixth since January 1980,
has been officially announced. But well
informed sources said it would open July
5 in Ho Chi Minh City (Saigon).
Observers here feel a partial troop
withdrawal is the most likely "gesture" by
Hanoi to show its "good will" for a peace
ful settlement of the region's problems.
There is no way of knowing now how
many troops might be pulled out if and
when the withdrawal takes place. But the

observers think any withdrawal would
have to involve significant numbers to
have the necessary impact.
So far Vietnam has refrained from dis
closing the number of troops it has in
Cambodia to defend the Phnom Penh
government that took power in January
1979. But analysts generally estimate the
figure to be around 180,000 men.
No withdrawal however, would be big
enough to jeopardize the Vietnamese
presence in Cambodia, which Hanoi justi
fies as necessary to counter the "Chinese
threat."
The possibility of a partial withdrawal
first came up in May when Foreign Min
ister Nguyen Co Thach told Agence
France-Presse in an interview that a lim

ited pullout "could be envisaged if it
elicited a positive gesture from the other
side," namely Thailand, accused by Hanoi
of aiding the ousted Khmer Rouge re
gime.
Vice Foreign Minister Vo Dong Giang
said in early June that there were
"positive factors" for a partial withdrawal.
In Hanoi's eyes, the Association of South
east Asian Nations understood the situ
ation better, and tensions on the Sino-
Vietnamese border had "stabilized."
Giang also focused on Khmer Rouge
military losses in Cambodia and the in
creased strength of the Phnom Penh gov
ernment of Heng Samrin.
Then, on June 18, the official Vietnam
news agency published an interview with

Giang reaffirming that Hanoi and Phnom
Penh were ready to carry out a partial
withdrawal "provided there are positive
signs from the ASEAN countries."
Vietnam's reaction was also moderate
toward ASEAN, heaping the main respon
sibility for the Kuala Lumpur coalition ac
cord on China and the United States.
Observers said that Hanoi could count
among its "positive signs" the relatively
moderate language used about Vietnam
at the recent ASEAN foreign ministers
conference in Singapore.
Philippine Foreign Minister Carlos
Romulo called on Vietnam to demon
strate that it is ready to take the first step
toward peace in the region.
