# Bignone sworn in as president

### Washington Post 
Buenos Aires — Retired army
general Reynaldo Bignone,
sworn in as miltary president
here yesterday, promised to uni
fy Argentina's divided armed
forces behind a government he
said would not offer "great
changes" during a planned 18-
month transition to democracy.
Bignone was appointed by the
army as president last week. He
took office in a short ceremony
at the presidential palace
without the support of the Navy
and Air Force, which withdrew
from the government last week
amid bitter infighting among
military leaders.
Following the failure of last
minute negotiations to draw the
Navy and Air Force back into the
government, political analysts
said Bignone's administration
held the weakest base of support
in the history of military rule

here as it confronts a range of
grave economic and social prob
lems.
Moments after pronouncing a
simple "Yes, I swear," in answer
to an oath read by army Com
mander-in-Chief Cristino Nico
laides, Bignone told reporters
that healing the military
divisions would be his first
priority.
He also confirmed the lifting
of a 6-year-old ban on political
activities and said he intended to
work closely with civilian politi
cal and labor leaders in for
mulating his government's poli
cies.
Bignone also has pledged to
pursue Argentina's campaign to
claim the Falkland Islands from
Britain, but is expected to signal
London that Argentina does not
intend to continue military ac
tion, thus allowing the release of
1000 Argentine officers still held
on the Falklands.

Leaders of the populist Per
onist movement, which has
grown increasingly cool toward
the army government, ignored
the swearing-in ceremonies and
sponsored a series of events
commemorating the eighth an
niversary of the death of three
time President Juan Peron.
While thousands gathered at
Peron's gravesite, there ap
peared to be little public interest
in the inauguration of Bignone,
62, the seventh military man to
serve as president since the
March 1976 overthrow of the last
Peronist government.
Much of the opposition to
Bignone and the power backing
him — army Commander Nico
laides and the 10 ranking
division generals — is built
around the perception that
Bignone intends to continue
with such policies as cordial rela
tions with the United States and
a free-market, anti-inflationary
economic policy.
