## Commentary/Ed Cervantes Southern culture: up for the summer 
### 
Summer's here! Cowabunga!
It's time to get the shorts out of
mothballs, break in a new pair of
thongs, and stock up on suntan
oil. At least that's the way sum
mer is greeted back in San Diego
where I hail from. However, I
find that my past San Diegan
summer experience will be vast
ly different from a Stanford sum
mer.
You see, down south summer
is regarded with mystical rever
ence. People make daily pil
grimages during these months to
p at the local holy temple,
t. jch.
Beaches are quite different
there than here. For one thing,
you actually go in the ocean,
which I have never done volun
tarily at Northern California
beaches for fear of terminal
frostbite. I was unfortunate
enough once to be thrown into
the Pacific near here. I emerged
with goose pimples the size of
golfballs, and my teeth were
chattering like an AP wire ma
chine.
It's a different way of life on a
Southern California beach. For
those unfamiliar with a beach
summer, try to imagine all the
people in Maples Pavilion for
registration day, scantily clothed
and sweating profusely, paced
prone on a sandbox 25 feet
square. And don't think that the
people are there to catch UV
rays. There are a variety of
amusements you can concern
yourself with:
•People watch — Don't fool
yourself. You are there to see
and be seen. Invest in a good
pair of reflective sunglasses and
a thin gold chain to adorn your
neck. The reflective glasses are
used to stare and fantasize at the
local beach bunnies/surfer types
without letting them know that
your pupils are dilating.
•Bring a copper penny with
you and see how many local
people you can find whose skin
matches that color.
•Bring a cooked lobster with
you and see how many tourists
and out-of-staters you can find
whose skin matches that color.
•Estimate the number of jun
ior high people around by coun
ting the number of girls with
braces, adding the number of
guys carrying beer cans in in
sulated foam holders.
With all that to do down south,
what can I do during a summer
up here? Well, there's an hour
long drive to the beach where
you can find overcast skies, peo
ple in down jackets, and mildly
interesting pieces of driftwood.
Still, for those landlocked here,
there are many things to do:
•Get a nametag and pretend
you're a visiting professor from
Ithaca and crash the Differential
Equations summer conference.
You might be able to snag a few
free munchies and drinks this
way. If someone asks you some
thing technical, act like you've
been hitting the bar like the rest
of the conferees and put a
lampshade over you head.
•When summer conferees
drive in and ask you to direct
them to the dorm where they'll
be staying, give them directions
to the Stanford Mausoleum.

•Estimate the number of grad
uate students around doing doc
torate work by counting the
number of people wearing bi
cycle helmets indoors.
•Find out how many people
are trying to finish incompletes
and make up classes they failed
during the year by counting the
number of people at DeGuerre
pool during classtime.
Well, now that I think about it,
maybe a Stanford summer won't
be that different from one back
home.
Ed Cervantes is a recently
graduated senior with a degree
in electrical engineering.
