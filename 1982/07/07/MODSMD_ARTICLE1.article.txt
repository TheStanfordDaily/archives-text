The University and the United
Stanford Workers (USW) began
bargaining last Friday for a new
contract to replace the current
three-year contract, which ex
pires August 31.
Michael Baratz, the executive
secretary of USW, said the nego
tiations are going to be "hard."
According to a USW news
letter, the union has given the
University an initial wage pro
posal that calls for a 20 percent
increase in wages for each union
member, or an increase of $320
per year, whichever is larger.
USW's initial wage proposal
also includes provisions to adjust
all pay ranges, because existing
pay ranges are "too low" or are
"not in line with" other em
ployers in the area, according to
the newsletter.

The contract meetings are
being held every Friday after
noon through August.
Heading the University nego
tiating team is Staff Counsel
Priscilla Wheeler. The union has
12 negotiators headed by Baratz.
The USW newsletter cites sev
eral "major problem areas" that
"need to be resolved." Major is
sues include raising wages and
benefits, improving the griev
ance procedure, and "prevent
ing unit erosion," according to
the newsletter.
Layoffs are also likely to be an
issue during the negotiations. A
recent USW bulletin said that the
current contract language re
garding layoffs is "not strong
enough."
USW has a goal of making sen
iority "the sole determination"
when the University is consider-

ing whether a laid-off worker is
qualified to be rehired in a new
position, according to the bullet
in. Current contract language
contains phrases that require
that workers have "sufficient
skill and ability" to perform their
new jobs, and, according to the
union publication, such phrases
give the University "too much
room to manipulate the con
tract."
USW represents 1350 Univer
sity employees on campus, who
do service, technical and main
tenance work. No faculty mem
bers or clerical workers are rep
resented by the union.
The bargaining sessions be
tween the University and USW
are closed to the public, but joint
press releases regarding the ne
gotiations are to be made public.
