## Beer distributors seek monopolies 
### 
Washington — Dire warnings
seem a bit silly. But as many
Americans toasted the nation's
birthday last weekend, party
poopers here were working to
raise the price of — dare we say it
— beer. Details of this con
spiracy might be enough to
cause a second revolution.
Beer wholesalers, who deliver
the foamy beverage from
breweries to bars, grocers and
carry-outs, are asking Congress
to pass a bill which would ex
plicitly allow them to set up local
monopolies for the sale of beer
brands. So far, majorities in both
the Senate and House have
agreed to co-sponsor the meas

ure which could, over time, raise
the price of beer by as much as
20 percent.
As distribution works in most
states, brewers usually assign
one firm in a given area to dis
tribute and price their brands.
Generally, a wholesaler handles
several brands at once and is
content to work his or her own
territory, leaving neighboring
areas to other dealers.
But recently, hard times have
compelled some overstocked
distributors to make a little extra
through discount bulk sales in
markets outside their own. The
practice is called "dumping,"
and most wholesalers want pro
tection against it.
Yet, unlike the groups of pro
testing coal miners and farmers
who seem to visit Washington
regularly, beer wholesalers
haven't organized a caravan of
delivery trucks to attract na
tionwide sympathies. The reason
is obvious: publicity would kill
this drunken proposal.
Though Senate Bill 1215 is
shrewdly entitled "The Malt
Beverage Interbrand Competi
tion Act," it could effectively be
anti-competitive in nature. By
expressly allowing dealers the
exclusive rights to peddle a spe
cific brand in a certain area,
51215 would exempt the entire
industry from anti-trust laws that
seek to preserve free-market
competition. While the
Budweiser and Moosehead lov
ers among us would still have ac
cess to their poisons under the
bill, they would be in a take-it
or-leave-it price situation with
local beerlords.
As a result, beer prices could
rise to inflated levels, if Indiana's
experience with exclusive terri
tories is any guide. Two years af
ter that state outlawed territorial
arrangements, an Indiana legis
lative study committee detected
a 20 percent decrease in the
price of beer-by-the-case.
Even Ronald Reagan's Justice
Department "strongly opposes"
the"beer barrel" bill. As Abbott
Lipsky, assistant attorney general
in the anti-trust division, told the
Senate Judiciary Committee last
month, "The malt beverage in
dustry is a textbook example in
which the widespread use of ex
clusive territorial arrangements
might have anti-competitive ef
fects."
In reality, as the bill's propo
nents themselves know, whole
salers have little to fear from
"beer dumping." The practice is
neither lucrative nor widespread
to an extent that it warrants out
right territorial remedies. A suc
cessful "dumper" can only skim
a couple of hundred dollars off
the top of every truckload
which, in their business, is a nar
row profit margin.
But whatever is behind all this,
we have but one suggestion to
wholesalers who scream, "Give
me monopoly or give me death"
— sit down, relax and have a
beer on the rest of us. If Con
gress swallows your proposal,
you may find yourselves with a
consumer rebellion on your
hands.
