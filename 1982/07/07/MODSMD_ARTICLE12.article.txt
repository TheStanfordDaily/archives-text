# Program benefits management

### Lisa Stern 
A recent survey of participants
has indicated that the Univer
sity's unique Management De
velopment Program (MDP) has
been largely successful in its mis
sion to "develop a broad, institu
tional" perspective among Stan
ford's middle management per
sonnel.
After closing applications on
June 30, a committee is currently
developing the curriculum for
the 1982-83 class which will be
the fourth in the short history of
the program.
Survey respondents repeated
ly wrote that the most beneficial
result of their participation in
MDP was an expanded under
standing of the values of the Uni
versity and how they can best

work in the context of these
goals.
The program, which is limited
to 20 participants each year, is
composed of weekly seminars
from October through April.
The classes are typically led by
the University's senior adminis
trators, including Robert Parker,
director of personnel, William
Massy, vice-president for busi
ness and finance, and Andy
Geiger, director of athletics. In
March, the "students" attend
special sessions in which they
hear President Donald Kennedy
and Provost Albert Hastorf.
Participants from middle man
agement who have some in
fluence over University opera
tions, resources, or policy de
velopment are prime candidates
for the program.
Judy Moss, staff development
director and a member of the
steering committee for MDP,
also noted the importance of
choosing applicants who can
contribute something extra to

the program.
"Participants aren't graded or
evaluated, but they are still ex
pected to contribute a lot. In
fact, one question we ask on the
application form is, 'What can
you contribute to MDP?' " Moss
explained.
Based on the surveys collected
from last year's participants, the
curriculum committee will adapt
the content and structure of the
program to the needs of the
managers and the University.
Recently, the emphasis of the
program has been on human re
source management, a subject in
which Kennedy has expressed
interest.
Moss said this heightened in
terest could in part be attributed
to the economic problems many
institutions and individuals now
face. "People are suddenly ask
ing themselves, 'What does my
job mean to me?' and 'How can I
improve my performance to best
suit my employer?,' " she said.
However, Vice-Provost Ray

mond Bacchetti, a program or
ganizer and frequent lecturer,
said that he does not believe
University management should
be compared to other forms of
business management.
"The job of (University) man
agement and staff is to provide
the stabilizing conditions which
lead to the creation, conserva
tion, and advancement of
knowledge," Bacchetti ex

plained. Hie added, "One of the
principles of management is that
it is working best when noticed
least."
Participants usually expressed
a greater understanding of Uni
versity operations. They re
ported a broader view of their
roles in relation to the values of
Stanford as a whole. This per
spective is then typically shared
by the managers with their staffs.

"I don't like to call it a
network," Moss said, "but it is a
ripple out effect. The program
reaches more individuals than
the 20 who attend the lectures."
Bacchetti agreed. "At the
middle management level, the
program can have the greatest
impact on the most lives."
Steering committee members
stress that the program, while
secondarily encouraging im
proved management skills, is not
primarily concerned with im
proving the individual's man
agerial capability.
"It is not an MBA program in
either its content or its ap
proach," Moss explained, "be
cause it has an institutional base.
It is focused on the needs of the
University first."
MDP begins each fall with a
two-day retreat where steering
committee members and others
explain the program's scope and
discuss management in the Uni

versity.
In the following weeks, partic
ipants encounter blocks of lec
tures which focus on topics in
cluding planning, governance
and social influence, decision
making, and current University
isues in medical affairs, legal af
fairs, and information systems.
Participants are also encouraged
to attend meetings of the Board
of Trustees, Faculty Senate, and
Budget Group.
Stanford's program, the first of
its kind in any university, is fi
nanced through the University's
staff training funds.
Bacchetti said that he believes
that the hidden benefit of the
program is that it brings together
managers and administrators
who probably would not other
wise meet or share ideas. "The
managers develop a greater
sense of community, and the
size of the University becomes a
little less overwhelming," he
concluded.
