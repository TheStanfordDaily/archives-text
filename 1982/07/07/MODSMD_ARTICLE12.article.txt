# Program benefits management

### Lisa Stern 
A recent survey of participants
has indicated that the Univer
sity's unique Management De
velopment Program (MDP) has
been largely successful in its mis
sion to "develop a broad, institu
tional" perspective among Stan
ford's middle management per
sonnel.
After closing applications on
June 30, a committee is currently
developing the curriculum for
the 1982-83 class which will be
the fourth in the short history of
the program.
Survey respondents repeated
ly wrote that the most beneficial
result of their participation in
MDP was an expanded under
standing of the values of the Uni
versity and how they can best

work in the context of these
goals.
The program, which is limited
to 20 participants each year, is
composed of weekly seminars
from October through April.
The classes are typically led by
the University's senior adminis
trators, including Robert Parker,
director of personnel, William
Massy, vice-president for busi
ness and finance, and Andy
Geiger, director of athletics. In
March, the "students" attend
special sessions in which they
hear President Donald Kennedy
and Provost Albert Hastorf.
Participants from middle man
agement who have some in
fluence over University opera
tions, resources, or policy de
velopment are prime candidates
for the program.
Judy Moss, staff development
director and a member of the
steering committee for MDP,
also noted the importance of
choosing applicants who can
contribute something extra to

the program.
"Participants aren't graded or
evaluated, but they are still ex
pected to contribute a lot. In
fact, one question we ask on the
application form is, 'What can
you contribute to MDP?' " Moss
explained.
Based on the surveys collected
from last year's participants, the
curriculum committee will adapt
the content and structure of the
program to the needs of the
managers and the University.
Recently, the emphasis of the
program has been on human re
source management, a subject in
which Kennedy has expressed
interest.
Moss said this heightened in
terest could in part be attributed
to the economic problems many
institutions and individuals now
face. "People are suddenly ask
ing themselves, 'What does my
job mean to me?' and 'How can I
improve my performance to best
suit my employer?,' " she said.
However, Vice-Provost Ray

mond Bacchetti, a program or
ganizer and frequent lecturer,
said that he does not believe
University management should
be compared to other forms of
business management.
"The job of (University) man
agement and staff is to provide
the stabilizing conditions which
lead to the creation, conserva
tion, and advancement of
knowledge," Bacchetti ex

plained. Hie added, "One of the
principles of management is that
it is working best when noticed
least."
Participants usually expressed
a greater understanding of Uni
versity operations. They re
ported a broader view of their
roles in relation to the values of
Stanford as a whole. This per
spective is then typically shared
by the managers with their staffs.
