# 'Time' to restore old clock tower, chimes
## 
### Jane Bailie 
Plans have been initiated fo'
the restoration and resurrection
of the Seth-Thomas clock and
chimes which were housed in
the steeple of Memorial Church
prior to the 1906 earthquake, ac
cording to Planning Director
Phil Williams. Funds donated by
an anonymous Stanford alum
nus made the project possible.
The "Engineering Corner"
directly between the Career
Planning and Placement Center
and the School of Education has
been selected as the clock tow

er's future site. Project Planning
Director Shirley Chen said that
construction is scheduled for
August with completion ex
pected in November.
The original position of the
clock was upon the steeple of
Memorial Church, which was a
transcription of the spire of the
Trinity Church in Boston. Fol
lowing the collapse of the stee
ple during the April, 1906 earth
quake, the clock and chimes
were stored until an alternative
building could be constructed.
The result was a wooden

shingle-covered tower located
in the center of Duena Street
(the street which currently runs
from the back of Tresidder
Union to the Church).
The structure was completed
in 1915 and torn down in 1967
because of the "widening of the
street and improvement of the
mall," said Chen. After 1967 the
clockworks were stored and
subsequently displayed in the
Terman Engineering Library un
til the present project was pro
posed.
The clock tower's location was

selected because of the diversity
of the architecture surrounding
the area. This eliminated the ne
cessity to accomodate nearby
architecture. Extensive delibera
tion was involved in determining
the particular site. Chen said, "It
took almost a year to select a site
... A lot of groups were heavily
involved."
According to Williams, re

locating the clock in Duena
Street was financially impossible.
But a location close to the
church was favored by the Stan
ford Historical Society. "It was a
question of history versus
architecturally sound solutions,"
said Williams.
Because the majority of the
buildings around the church are

sandstone, a material which is in
herently massive and expensive,
relocation there would prove
costly in addition to requiring
more ground space than that
which is currently available.
"The designated location has
enough room and meets the
criteria well, as well as being
close to the church," said Wil
liams. "There's a lot of student
activity in that area."
Present architectural plans for
the tower involved a structure 45
feet high surmounted by a flat
red tile roof. The open area lo
cated directly below the roof will
contain four bells.
Four clock faces will be in
stalled below the bells, and the
clockworks will be displayed be
hind thickset glass in a rein
forced stucco frame. Trellises
and benches on each side of
Escondido Mall will surround
the immediate area "to create a
sense of a gateway," said Chen.
The clock will chime on the
quarter hour from 8 a.m. until 2
p.m. The bells will ring on the
hour from 8 a.m. to 8 p.m.
"We wanted something that
would show off the clockwork as
well as provide a supporting
base for the actual faces. Basical

ly the concept was really to build
a display case," said Williams.
"There were several studies con
ducted and an architectural firm
was hired.
"E.H.D.D. was chosen for the
project because they've had a lot
of experience with sandstone,
and the Stanford campus. They
had a familiarity with the Stan
ford architecture and were
therefore chosen for the design
development."
The fundamental design of the
tower was chosen through the
process of the donor selecting
one of a series of schematic
sketches, each incorporating
various architectural styles.
"The donor and his wife used
to meet under the tower when it
was on Duena Street, so it had a
special significance to them,"
said Williams.
"When they came to the Uni
versity and wanted to make a
contribution, (Mechanical Engi
neering) Prof. (Henry) Fuchs
came up with the idea of restor
ing the clock. The couple was re
ally taken with the idea," said
Williams. "However, they
wanted the tower to be in a place
where there would be a lot of
people, somewhere which

wasn't so isolated.
"The couple wanted some
thing not necessarily purposeful,
just something to make the en
vironment better," said Wil
liams. "By the time the project
was completed, the cost was
about two to three times what
we had planned to spend, but
the donor was very patient and
understanding," added Wil
liams. "In fact, in the beginning,
we didn't think it could be re
stored."
The clockwork itself was re
stored under the direction of
Fuchs, an emeritus professor,
with the aid of a number of stu
dent volunteers, using both
hand and machine restoration
techniques.
Fuchs, along with fellow facil
ity member David Beach, a
teaching specialist in mechanical
engineering, had been respon
sible for the installation of the
clockworks in the Terman Engi
neering Library. "I was one of
the people whose feelings were
deeply hurt when the tower was
torn down. I didn't want to see
the works thrown away, so I
made sure they were stored
away," said Fuchs.

"We wanted something that
would show off the clockwork as
well as provide a supporting
base for the actual faces. Basical

ly the concept was really to build
a display case," said Williams.
"There were several studies con
ducted and an architectural firm
was hired.
"E.H.D.D. was chosen for the
project because they've had a lot
of experience with sandstone,

had a familiarity with the Stan

therefore chosen for the design
development."
The fundamental design of the
tower was chosen through the
process of the donor selecting
one of a series of schematic
sketches, each incorporating
various architectural styles.
"The donor and his wife used
to meet under the tower when it
was on Duena Street, so it had a
special significance to them,"
said Williams.
"When they came to the Uni
versity and wanted to make a
contribution, (Mechanical Engi
neering) Prof. (Henry) Fuchs
came up with the idea of restor
ing the clock. The couple was re
ally taken with the idea," said
Williams. "However, they
wanted the tower to be in a place
where there would be a lot of
people, somewhere which

wasn't so isolated.
"The couple wanted some
thing not necessarily purposeful,
just something to make the en
vironment better," said Wil
liams. "By the time the project
was completed, the cost was
about two to three times what
we had planned to spend, but
the donor was very patient and
understanding," added Wil
liams. "In fact, in the beginning,
we didn't think it could be re
stored."
The clockwork itself was re
stored under the direction of
Fuchs, an emeritus professor,
with the aid of a number of stu
dent volunteers, using both
hand and machine restoration
techniques.
Fuchs, along with fellow facil
ity member David Beach, a
teaching specialist in mechanical
engineering, had been respon
sible for the installation of the
clockworks in the Terman Engi
neering Library. "I was one of
the people whose feelings were
deeply hurt when the tower was
torn down. I didn't want to see
the works thrown away, so I
made sure they were stored
away," said Fuchs.
Plans have been initiated fo'
the restoration and resurrection
of the Seth-Thomas clock and
chimes which were housed in
the steeple of Memorial Church
prior to the 1906 earthquake, ac
cording to Planning Director
Phil Williams. Funds donated by
an anonymous Stanford alum
nus made the project possible.
The "Engineering Corner"
directly between the Career
Planning and Placement Center
and the School of Education has
been selected as the clock tow

er's future site. Project Planning
Director Shirley Chen said that
construction is scheduled for
August with completion ex
pected in November.
The original position of the
clock was upon the steeple of
Memorial Church, which was a
transcription of the spire of the
Trinity Church in Boston. Fol
lowing the collapse of the stee
ple during the April, 1906 earth
quake, the clock and chimes
were stored until an alternative
building could be constructed.
The result was a wooden

shingle-covered tower located
in the center of Duena Street
(the street which currently runs
from the back of Tresidder
Union to the Church).
The structure was completed
in 1915 and torn down in 1967
because of the "widening of the
street and improvement of the
mall," said Chen. After 1967 the
clockworks were stored and
subsequently displayed in the
Terman Engineering Library un
til the present project was pro
posed.
The clock tower's location was

selected because of the diversity
of the architecture surrounding
the area. This eliminated the ne
cessity to accomodate nearby
architecture. Extensive delibera
tion was involved in determining
the particular site. Chen said, "It
took almost a year to select a site
... A lot of groups were heavily
involved."
According to Williams, re

locating the clock in Duena
Street was financially impossible.
But a location close to the
church was favored by the Stan
ford Historical Society. "It was a
question of history versus
architecturally sound solutions,"
said Williams.
Because the majority of the
buildings around the church are

sandstone, a material which is in
herently massive and expensive,
relocation there would prove
costly in addition to requiring
more ground space than that
which is currently available.
"The designated location has
enough room and meets the
criteria well, as well as being
close to the church," said Wil
liams. "There's a lot of student
activity in that area."
Present architectural plans for
the tower involved a structure 45
feet high surmounted by a flat
red tile roof. The open area lo
cated directly below the roof will
contain four bells.
Four clock faces will be in
stalled below the bells, and the
clockworks will be displayed be
hind thickset glass in a rein
forced stucco frame. Trellises
and benches on each side of
Escondido Mall will surround
the immediate area "to create a
sense of a gateway," said Chen.
The clock will chime on the
quarter hour from 8 a.m. until 2
p.m. The bells will ring on the
hour from 8 a.m. to 8 p.m.
