# 'Time' to restore old clock tower, chimes
## 
### Jane Bailie 
Plans have been initiated fo'
the restoration and resurrection
of the Seth-Thomas clock and
chimes which were housed in
the steeple of Memorial Church
prior to the 1906 earthquake, ac
cording to Planning Director
Phil Williams. Funds donated by
an anonymous Stanford alum
nus made the project possible.
The "Engineering Corner"
directly between the Career
Planning and Placement Center
and the School of Education has
been selected as the clock tow

er's future site. Project Planning
Director Shirley Chen said that
construction is scheduled for
August with completion ex
pected in November.
The original position of the
clock was upon the steeple of
Memorial Church, which was a
transcription of the spire of the
Trinity Church in Boston. Fol
lowing the collapse of the stee
ple during the April, 1906 earth
quake, the clock and chimes
were stored until an alternative
building could be constructed.
The result was a wooden

shingle-covered tower located
in the center of Duena Street
(the street which currently runs
from the back of Tresidder
Union to the Church).
The structure was completed
in 1915 and torn down in 1967
because of the "widening of the
street and improvement of the
mall," said Chen. After 1967 the
clockworks were stored and
subsequently displayed in the
Terman Engineering Library un
til the present project was pro
posed.
The clock tower's location was

selected because of the diversity
of the architecture surrounding
the area. This eliminated the ne
cessity to accomodate nearby
architecture. Extensive delibera
tion was involved in determining
the particular site. Chen said, "It
took almost a year to select a site
... A lot of groups were heavily
involved."
According to Williams, re

locating the clock in Duena
Street was financially impossible.
But a location close to the
church was favored by the Stan
ford Historical Society. "It was a
question of history versus
architecturally sound solutions,"
said Williams.
Because the majority of the
buildings around the church are


OUTDOOR SCULPTURE? â€” A model of the
clock tower, holding a clock which sat in the
steeple of Memorial Church prior to the 1906

earthquake, which will be constructed be
tween the Engineering Corner and the Ca
reer Planning and Placement Center.
