# Students enter Peace Corps

Not everyone who graduates from Stanford
enters investment banking or medical school.
Two members of the class of '82, looking for
something a little out of the ordinary, decided
to join the Peace Corps. Graduated seniors John
Selig and Matt Grady have both accepted as
signments in Africa.
Selig, who will be teaching high school math
in Ghana, decided to join the Peace Corps be
cause he wanted to learn about other people.
"Most of all, I want to help other people... and
see how other people in the world live near
poverty." Also, Selig added, he did not "want to
put on a tie yet."
Grady, who will be teaching math in
Swaziland, also opted for something other than
a business suit. After graduating with a degree
in electrical engineering, he decided that engi
neering is "not what I want to do all my life."
For Grady, the Peace Corps offers an op
portunity to teach, which he is considering as a
career. He is also dissatisified with the syle of life
here. "It is a good idea to see how other people
live. Life here is not a realistic experience," he
said.
Each volunteer is given intensive training ses
sions in learning the language and the culture

of their assigned country. An eight-day orien
tation in the United States is followed by a two
and-a-half- to three-month session in the for
eign country itself.
The Peace Corps expects a volunteer to fol
low certain policies while overseas. For exam
ple, Selig said that volunteers are "not allowed
to be involved politically at all ... any drugs,
dealing with the black market, you're out of the
country right away."
The life of a volunteer is lonely, said Selig.
"It'll be tough to make friends and to be a mi
nority in the country. There's a lot of disease,
and I'll have to be careful of that." The food in
Ghana — which is very spicy — is also wor
risome to Selig. "Either I'll get skinny or I'll have
to get a taste for the food," Selig said.
Parents and friends have been very sup
portive of his decision, Grady said, although he
has received a few "what a waste of an educa
tion" comments.
According to a Peace Corps recruiter in San
Francisco, the organization was established
with three objectives: to help increase the pool
of skilled manpower in developing countries;
to increase other peoples' understanding of
Americans; and to increase Americans' under
standing of other peoples.
