## Putting out cash worthwhile for the Clash 
### Tony Kelly The Clash San Francisco Civic 22 June 1982 
Talk about indignity. Due to
some inscrutable mixture of bad
luck and misplaced communica
tions (with a twist of fate) — oth
erwise known as "business as
usual" — I somehow didn't
make it onto the lettemthru list
for the Clash concert a short
while back. So what does that
mean, summer campers? That's
right — I had to pay to get in.
I know, you're not exactly
passing the hat for me. I can't

blame you — before I figured
out the Concert+Review- Pay
check equation a couple of years
ago and became an overrated
headphone attachment for a
semi-living, I had to pay all the
time for my lab work at the Col
lege of Musical Knowledge. In
fact, I remember hanging out at
the front door to the Santa
Monica Civic in Los Angeles
back in 1980, looking for all the
world like Norman Bates' kid
brother, trying to scalp a ticket to
the Clash show that evening. I
finally got in and saw the con
cert, worrying all the time about
whether I was getting my mon
ey's worth.
That's a concern most re
viewers tend to ignore. Traipsing
around to see Band X on the
drop of a press release may be
fine for someone who has noth
ing better to do, but for ev
eryone else who has to flip
burgers or pump unleaded for a
night on the town, the value of a
concert comes under far closer
scrutiny. It was with this re
minder fresh in my wallet that
the Clash came into town, fight
ing a number of demons of their
own past at the same time. So
how did they fare? Rather well.
Or rather badly, depending on
your expectations.
For my part, I've always har
bored a little bit of suspicion
about a band that would allow
itself to be marketed as "The
Only Band That Matters," and
the Clash did not do anything to
allay those fears in their set. They
still wear their Dagwood-Goes
to-Boot-Camp clothes,
camouflage netting drapes the
corners of the Civic stage (shield
ing the group from the sight of
the dangerous fans above them),
and slides of police beatings and
classified ads create a striking, if

pointless, backdrop to the songs.
Lead singer Joe Strummer, Travis
Bickled in a Mohawk and
fatigues these days, still tries to
make up for his lack of vocal
control with passionate slurring
and sweating (no one in the rock
world sweats better than Joe).
And as usual, the Clash have the
strangest tastes in ordering songs
that I've heard, alternating gut
wrenching rockers like "Tommy
Gun" and "Safe European
Home" with modified funk like
"The Magnificent Seven" and
oh-so-slow dub reggae riffs like
"Armagideon Time." Some folks
call this eclectic or diverse;
weird is probably a better term.
But at the same time, there's a
certain maturation at work in the
Clash. Most ot it is. apparent in
the new album, quaintly titled
Combat Rock. Suspicious fans
looking for the follow-up to the
three-record Sandinista! to be

packed in a cardboard box can
rest easy; Combat Rock is only
one record, and a pretty tight
one at that. Gone are the ex
cesses common to new bands on
their first explorations of studio
technology (cf. the Jam and just
about everyone in the Human
League genre of disco-synth
fluff), replaced by a careful use
of occasional, subtle effects
(such as on the terrific "Rock the
Casbah"). None of it is going to
make you forget the first album,
or even the best parts of London
Calling, but it will help you re
member.
The Clash have almost made a
killer of an album with Combat
Rock — the only weak points
come near the end of the second
side, where Sandinistal and Al
len Ginsberg comes back to
haunt the unwary listener — and
they seem to know it. In concert,
the new songs carry the same

energy that drew audiences to
the band a couple of years ago;
lead guitarist Mick Jones even
has another '60sisn tune with
"single" written all over it in
"Should I Stay or Should I Go?"
As a result, it doesn't seem as silly
now to think of the Clash as the
same band that did "Train in
Vain", or "Garageland" in 1977.
The latter song served as the
Clash's final encore, and it
seemed an appropriate re
minder of the value of the band.
The Clash are not going to be the
world's greatest rock band, as
they were once rumored to be
by overzealous record company
executives; nor do they have to
be. That realization, along with a
corresponding security in their
performance, makes it easier to
tolerate the übiquitous political
bent to their music, and to fork
out the money to see the Clash
without worrying about your
money's worth.


"No one gets in free — we need better clothes!" demand the fashion-conscious
Clash.
