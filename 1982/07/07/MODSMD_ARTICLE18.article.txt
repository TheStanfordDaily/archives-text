Marines ready to escort PLO
Washington — A combat force of 1800 U.S. Marines,
together with tanks, artillery and other equipment, is
poised off the coast of Lebanon awaiting word from the
Pentagon to become part of a multinational peace-keep
ing force in that war-torn nation, administration officials
said yesterday.
They said that if called on, the Marines would take up
positions in Beirut to help oversee the "orderly and safe"
departure of Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO)
guerillas from Beirut, and to secure the city and its outly
ing districts against further fighting until Lebanese army
units can be organized to take over.
The landing of U.S. Marines in Lebanon would be part
of a larger U.S. plan in which the PLO forces would be
evacuated from Beirut to unidentified third countries in
ships chartered by the United States and escorted by U.S.
Navy ships, the officials said.
President Ronald Reagan said in Los Angeles yesterday
that agreement to the plan had been reached "in princi
ple," in negotiations conducted by U.S. special envoy
Philip Habib with Israeli and Lebanese officials, and,
through them, the PLO.
A senior administration official said in Washington
that the plan had been advanced by Lebanese officials,
apparently on behalf of the PLO. But an Israeli official
said the plan was "still somewhat theoretical" because it
was unclear if the PLO would agree to participate.
The administration official conceded that the landing
of U.S. troops to supervise a PLO evacuation on Un
chartered ships could put the United States in the politi
cally embarrassing position of being in effect the guaran
tor of the PLO's continued existence. But he said the
need to get the PLO out of Beirut was an overriding con
cern.
Pentagon officials said yesterday that the Marines
would be landed, if ordered, with full combat gear in
cluding tanks, heavy artillery, antitank weapons and ar
mored personnel carriers, along with detachments of
combat engineers. The officials said the operation would
include air support from jet fighters and helicopters
flying sorties from the aircraft carrier Forrestal and other
ships.
Fighting breaks Lebanese truce
Beirut — Israeli tanks and artillery pounded Palesti
nian guerrillas firing mortars and rockets from
blockaded west Beirut yesterday, and the Reagan admin
istration offered to contribute up to 1000 combat troops
to an international force that would evacuate the PLO by
sea.
The U.S. offer to help defuse the crisis came as the fifth
cease-fire in the past month was Jown apart by gunfire.
The Tel Aviv command said that Lebanese guerrillas
opened fire on Israeli troops southeast of the Lebanese
capital about 6 p.m. (noon EDT), wounding three Israeli
soldiers. It said Israeli troops returned the fire, and a half
hour later the guerrillas opened fire on Israeli forces
north of the Lebanese presidential palace in the Beirut
suburb of Baabda.
.The fighting is taking place against the background of
the three-day-old Israeli food and water blockade of

west Beirut. "Hundreds of thousands of besieged inhabi
tants face the danger of certain death from hunger, from
thirst and from diseases," Lebanon's Red Cross said of
the blockade. An estimated 500,000 civilians and 8000
guerrillas are trapped in the city.
Reagan calls flat-rate tax "tempting"
Los Angeles — President Ronald Reagan said yester
day a flat-rate income tax is "very tempting" even
though charities fear such a system would dry up deduc
tible contributions.
But "I don't think people would quit giving ... simply
because we changed the system of taxation," the presi
dent aid, adding that a simplified tax system "is some
thing worth looking into."
Reagan said he believes taxpayers are "pretty fed up"
with the complexities of the current tax system, which,
he said, sometimes can't be explained even by Internal
Revenue Service agents.
But the president also said, "I know that many charities
and educational institutions are concerned that this may
dry up giving."
"The more I think of it, we are the most generous peo
ple on earth," Reagan added.
It was Reagan's strongest tilt to date in favor of an in
come tax which would set a percentage figure for Ameri
cans in all income brackets and eliminate the system of
reporting deductions.
Congressional cocaine ring probed
Oklahoma City — Rep. Robert Dornan (R-Calif.) said
today investigators have uncovered names of "a half
dozen" congressmen involved in a cocaine ring on
Capitol Hill.
"Some of the investigators have talked of as many as a
half-dozen or more," Dornan said. "I was hoping as a
member of Congress (that) there wouldn't be that
many."
Dornan said he knows who the congressmen are but
declined to identify them. He did say, however, that
those involved in the cocaine ring were "user-con
sumers."
The California Republican, meanwhile, confirmed
that he allowed an undercover narcotics agent to use his
office during the investigation.
The probe led to the April arrests of former con
gressional page Douglas Marshal and two others, Robert
Finkel and Troy Todd, CBS reported Monday night.
Dornan said he was approached by agents of the U.S.
Drug Enforcement Agency, who asked him to help the
investigation by allowing an agent to work in his office as
a congressional aide.
Syndicated columnist Jack Anderson had recom
mended to investigators that they approach Dornan for
help, the congressman said.
In the interview with CBS on Monday, Dornan said it
would have been the "height of hypocrisy" for him to
refuse use of his office for the investigation.
90 reported dead in Soviet air crash
Moscow — A Soviet jetliner bound for west Africa
crashed shortly after takeoff from Moscow early yester

day and a Sierre Leone Embassy spokesman said there
were no reported survivors among the estimated 90 peo
ple aboard.
Soviet authorities waited 17 hours before disclosing
the air disaster, and then reported only that Flight 411, an
llyushin-62 headed for Senegal and Sierre Leone,
crashed after it took off from Sheremetevo Airport, 18
miles northwest of Moscow.
Western airline representatives in Moscow said the
plane carried about 90 people and crashed about six
miles from Sheremetevo just after lifting off at 4:10 p.m.
EDT Monday.
A spokesman for the Sierre Leone Embassy said he un
derstood the plane "crashed a few minutes after
takeoff," and that there were "no survivors." Among the
dead were 22 passengers from Sierre Leone, including
two diplomats, one on his way home for reassignment
and the other returning to Dakar from his post in Buda
pest, Hungary, the spokesman said.
The official Soviet news agency Tass said there were an
undisclosed number of victims, but gave no figures.
One source said one of the four engines was ablaze.
A U.S. Embassy spokesman said Soviet authorities had
refused to say whether any Americans were aboard the
aircraft and deferred inquiries until today.
USDA withheld diet, group charges
Washington — An activist group yesterday released
eight pages of practical advice on how to maintain a low
fat, low-cholesterol, anti-heart disease diet that the Rea
gan administration had decided not to publish.
Entitled "Eating the Moderate Fat and Cholesterol
Way," the advice repeats what many doctors counsel:
eat less fatty meat and high-fat dairy products, fewer
eggs and fewer saturated, mainly solid, fats.
Most nutritional scientists consider this good advice to
help avoid heart and blood vessel disease, and a National
Academy of Sciences panel said three weeks ago that the
same kind of low-fat diet might help avoid cancer.
John Ochs, press aide to Agriculture Secretary John
Block, said yesterday, "We felt there was not the scien
tific evidence for the U.S. Agriculture Department or the
government to publish" the advice, which was written
during the Carter administration.
To spokesmen for the Center for Science in the Public
Interest, who distributed the material, the decision rep
resents not caution but "suppression."
They pointed out that Block announced last Septem
ber that he would issue a publication called "Food-2,"
containing the moderate-fat and cholesterol chapter.
"Less than a week later," they said, "he reversed that
decision after meat, egg and dairy interests complained
that the booklet would harm sales of their high-fat prod
ucts."
