# Fewer students choose summer housing
## 
### Jane Bailie 
Despite recent indications of a
larger than usual shortage of on
campus summer housing due to
an increase in student demand,
there are actually fewer students
choosing to live on campus dur
ing the summer quarter than in
past years, according to Doug
Mitchell, director of student
summer housing.
Mitchell said the decrease "is
probably due to the fact that
there is no system of priority
units for students who stay here
in the summer.
"I think a lot more people are
moving to off-campus houses
and apartments during the sum
mer " estimates Mitchell, "since
one-year leases are now all the
rage in Palo Alto."
For students who do choose to
remain on campus during the
summer, several options are
available. Crothers Memorial
Hall, the Manzanita Park trailers,
Mirrielees and Wilbur Hall are
usually allocated to house the
approximately 850 students who
ask to live on campus. To be
eligible for summer housing a
student must either be enrolled

for the summer term or be a
matriculated University student.
Mitchell has, however, noted
an increase in the number of
high school students enrolled in
the summer session over past
years, setting this year's total at
nearly 80 students. Former ses
sions have witnessed an average
of 30 to 40 high school students.
He attributes this increase in
high school residents to "their
wanting to get an edge on col
lege work. If they can show that
they can do well in actual college
courses, they will probably have
some leeway when they apply
for college."
Mitchell estimates that close
to half of the students presently
living in campus housing are en
rolled for summer quarter, with
two-thirds of those currently
registered working part-time.
The other 50 percent of campus
residents are matriculated Stan
ford students, the majority of
whom are working in the area.
Mitchell enjoys the diversity
of summer residents, a charac
teristic he says is particularly in
digenous to the summer session.
"There is a large influx of for

eign students and foreign lan
guage courses. There are also
two different courses in in
tensive English .. . The different
countries provide different in
sights, and it's neat to see the in
ternationality here."
Summer residence locations,
as well as the number of spaces
available for student housing,
are determined by what Mitchell
describes as a "barter system
with the convention office." Five
housing facilities (Branner, Cow
ell cluster, Roble, Stern and
Toyon) are usually reserved for
executive courses, ranging from
administrative assemblies to
summer camps. Mitchell recog
nizes the monetary advantages
of the executive program to the
University, since the prices for
executive housing are nominally
higher. He attributes the pro
gram's popularity to the "favor
able location and attractiveness
of the Stanford campus."
Prices for summer housing

vary according to residence,
meal and room plan chosen (14
or 19 meals a week, double or
single occupancy) and length of
stay (eight to 10 weeks). Prices
range from $314-$524 (Man
zanita Park), $349-$437 (Mirrie
less Apts.) and $697-$lOOO
(Wilbur Hall, mandatory meal
service included).
Other summer housing op
tions open to students are coop
eratives and fraternities which
house between 33 and 65 occu
pants. Residence in both Sigma
Chi and Theta Chi, like Man
zanita Park and Mirrielees, is de
termined on a priority system
with priority given to those who
lived in that residence during
the regular academic year.
Sigma Chi, a nationally estab
lished fraternity which houses
both female and male residents
during the summer, bases its
priority in room assignments
upon affiliation with the fraterni
ty, after which selection is done

on a first-come-first-served
basis. Sigma Chi does not pro
vide open kitchen facilities.
Theta Chi, the smallest (33 res
idents) and only independent
co-op on the campus, functions
on a system of student-operated
maintenance and food prepara
tion.
"It's a lot of work, but it feels
good to live here," summarizes
Theta Chi financial manager
Jerry Scurman. "There is a lot of
continuity."
"The food here is also among
the cheapest on campus," ex
plains Scurman.
The selection and adminis
trative process for summer hous
ing, however, is relatively simple
when compared with the ex
tensive system which exists for
the preparation and assignments
of scholastic year housing.
With a "large percentage" of
students, according to Housing
Director Norm Robinson,choos
ing to remain in University
sponsored residences during all
four years of undergraduate
study, new accomodations are
presently being constructed on
the campus to house 800 more
students.
The three types of housing to
be built on the site include two
independent houses and the
East Asian studies house that will
accomodate 60 students each, a
complex of four connected
houses accomodating a total of
360; and several buildings of
suites that will house 260 stu
dents.
The independent houses are
modeled after the Row Houses,
built in 1975, and the complex,
called Sterling Quad, will be
modeled after Lagunita Court.

These additional housing facil
ities will serve to alleviate the in
creasing demand for campus
housing, felt particularly in the
autumn quarter.
"When this project is com
pleted," states Robinson, "we
hope to be able to house all un
dergraduates (approximately
5100) throughout their time at
Stanford, unless they're very
selective. .. The degree of selec
tivity affects the relative
absolutivity of our ability to meet
their requests."
"It's a complicated system to
administer," explains Robinson,
"but it works, and it puts in a cer
tain degree of predictability.
Educationally it makes sense,
psychologically it relieves anxie
ty. We're hoping the need for
the (three-year) guarantee sys
tem will disappear."

Hall, the Manzanita Park trailers,
Mirrielees and Wilbur Hall are
usually allocated to house the
approximately 850 students who
ask to live on campus. To be
eligible for summer housing a
student must either be enrolled

for the summer term or be a
matriculated University student.
Mitchell has, however, noted
an increase in the number of
high school students enrolled in
the summer session over past
years, setting this year's total at
nearly 80 students. Former ses
sions have witnessed an average
of 30 to 40 high school students.
He attributes this increase in
high school residents to "their
wanting to get an edge on col
lege work. If they can show that
they can do well in actual college
courses, they will probably have
some leeway when they apply
for college."
Mitchell estimates that close
to half of the students presently
living in campus housing are en
rolled for summer quarter, with
two-thirds of those currently
registered working part-time.
The other 50 percent of campus
residents are matriculated Stan
ford students, the majority of
whom are working in the area.
Mitchell enjoys the diversity
of summer residents, a charac
teristic he says is particularly in
digenous to the summer session.
"There is a large influx of for

eign students and foreign lan
guage courses. There are also
two different courses in in
tensive English .. . The different
countries provide different in
sights, and it's neat to see the in
ternationality here."
Summer residence locations,
as well as the number of spaces
available for student housing,
are determined by what Mitchell
describes as a "barter system
with the convention office." Five
housing facilities (Branner, Cow
ell cluster, Roble, Stern and
Toyon) are usually reserved for
executive courses, ranging from
administrative assemblies to
summer camps. Mitchell recog
nizes the monetary advantages
of the executive program to the
University, since the prices for
executive housing are nominally
higher. He attributes the pro
gram's popularity to the "favor
able location and attractiveness
of the Stanford campus."
Prices for summer housing

vary according to residence,
meal and room plan chosen (14
or 19 meals a week, double or
single occupancy) and length of
stay (eight to 10 weeks). Prices
range from $314-$524 (Man
zanita Park), $349-$437 (Mirrie
less Apts.) and $697-$lOOO
(Wilbur Hall, mandatory meal
service included).
Other summer housing op
tions open to students are coop
eratives and fraternities which
house between 33 and 65 occu
pants. Residence in both Sigma
Chi and Theta Chi, like Man
zanita Park and Mirrielees, is de
termined on a priority system
with priority given to those who
lived in that residence during
the regular academic year.
Sigma Chi, a nationally estab
lished fraternity which houses
both female and male residents
during the summer, bases its
priority in room assignments
upon affiliation with the fraterni
ty, after which selection is done

on a first-come-first-served
basis. Sigma Chi does not pro
vide open kitchen facilities.
Theta Chi, the smallest (33 res
idents) and only independent
co-op on the campus, functions
on a system of student-operated
maintenance and food prepara
tion.
"It's a lot of work, but it feels
good to live here," summarizes
Theta Chi financial manager
Jerry Scurman. "There is a lot of
continuity."
"The food here is also among
the cheapest on campus," ex
plains Scurman.
The selection and adminis
trative process for summer hous
ing, however, is relatively simple
when compared with the ex
tensive system which exists for
the preparation and assignments
of scholastic year housing.
With a "large percentage" of
students, according to Housing
Director Norm Robinson,choos
ing to remain in University
sponsored residences during all
four years of undergraduate
study, new accomodations are
presently being constructed on
the campus to house 800 more
students.
The three types of housing to
be built on the site include two
independent houses and the
East Asian studies house that will
accomodate 60 students each, a
complex of four connected
houses accomodating a total of
360; and several buildings of
suites that will house 260 stu
dents.
The independent houses are
modeled after the Row Houses,
built in 1975, and the complex,
called Sterling Quad, will be
modeled after Lagunita Court.

These additional housing facil
ities will serve to alleviate the in
creasing demand for campus
housing, felt particularly in the
autumn quarter.
"When this project is com
pleted," states Robinson, "we
hope to be able to house all un
dergraduates (approximately
5100) throughout their time at
Stanford, unless they're very
selective. .. The degree of selec
tivity affects the relative
absolutivity of our ability to meet
their requests."
"It's a complicated system to
administer," explains Robinson,
"but it works, and it puts in a cer
tain degree of predictability.
Educationally it makes sense,
psychologically it relieves anxie
ty. We're hoping the need for
the (three-year) guarantee sys
tem will disappear."
Despite recent indications of a
larger than usual shortage of on
campus summer housing due to
an increase in student demand,
there are actually fewer students
choosing to live on campus dur
ing the summer quarter than in
past years, according to Doug
Mitchell, director of student
summer housing.
Mitchell said the decrease "is
probably due to the fact that
there is no system of priority
units for students who stay here
in the summer.
"I think a lot more people are
moving to off-campus houses
and apartments during the sum
mer " estimates Mitchell, "since
one-year leases are now all the
rage in Palo Alto."
For students who do choose to
remain on campus during the
summer, several options are
available. Crothers Memorial
Hall, the Manzanita Park trailers,
Mirrielees and Wilbur Hall are
usually allocated to house the
approximately 850 students who
ask to live on campus. To be
