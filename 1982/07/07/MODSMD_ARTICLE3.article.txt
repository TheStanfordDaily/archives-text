Sequoia Travel Center employee Steven Gray, missing since
June 25, was found Friday at the Kern County Medical Center in
Bakersfield, according to University Police Captain Raoul
Niemeyer.
Gray was wandering around downtown Bakersfield in a "to
tally disoriented state" at about noon, said Niemeyer. He was
taken by ambulance to the Medical Center, where he was un
able to provide any information about himself.
Niemeyer said, "He says he can't remember anything."
Medical Center personnel contacted Bakersfield police, who
identified Gray through a police computer network of missing
persons.
The Medical Center told Niemeyer that Gray had no visible
injuries but would be held for further examination. But citing
privacy laws, Kern County medical authorities refused to pro
vide any information on the case.
Niemeyer said, "It was a real deep mystery to them (Kern
County medical authorities), too."
Niemeyer said Gray apparently did tell authorities that he
awoke Friday morning to find himself in the mountains and then
hitchhiked into Bakersfield.
Gray phoned his wife the day he disappeared, saying he was
being pursued.
According to Niemeyer, Gray has not yet returned to work.
Niemeyer added that he has not called Gray's wife. "I'm giving it
a few days to settle down," he said.
