# Admissions 'open'in summer

For the summer quarter the
University follows essentially an
open admission policy with the
registrar's office serving also as
the admissions office, according
to Christina Harrison, assistant
summer session director.
"We could handle many more
people than apply," she said.
The criterion for non-Stanford
student's admission to the sum
mer session is a record of "good
standing" at the applicant's col
lege or high school, she said.
"Summer session is a real aca
demic quarter," she said, adding
that the admissions process is set
up to insure that only academ
ically minded students enroll at
the summer session.
Requirements for high school
students — besides a record of
good academic standing — in
clude for high school seniors a
record of acceptance at a college
in the fall and for high school
juniors a letter of recommenda
tion from the applicant's high
school principal.
Harrison said that high school
seniors who want to attend sum
mer session but are not planning

on attending college in the fall
can be admitted if they are even
tually planning to attend college
and have a good academic rec
ord.
During the summer session
anyone over 25 is considered a
graduate student and for those
students the admissions applica
tion is merely informational as
no verification of past academic
achievements is required, she
said.
As of the second week of June
applications for summer en
rollment were up 13 percent, ac
cording to Harrison, who added
that this figure was not necessar
ily a good indication of how
many students were going to en
roll during the session because
continuing University students
do not have to apply for ad
mission.
Around 2 /j of the students and
half the faculty in the summer
session come from the Univer
sity. "With the tight job market,
students may see little or no al
ternative to trying to complete
their degrees early," said Cecilia
Burciaga, summer session direc
tor.
"Normally 55 to 60 percent of

the people who apply actually
enroll," Harrison said.
Burciaga estimated that en
rollment for this year's session
will be up five percent from last
year. Last year 3576 students en
rolled in summer school.
Since 1976 the number of stu
dents attending summer quarter
has grown steadily. Last year's
enrollment represented a four
percent increase over the pre
vious year's enrollment.
Tuition for the summer ses
sion for a full time student is
equal to the cost of tuition for
the three previous quarters,
which this year was $2,380. How
ever, students are allowed to
take less than 15 units and pay
tuition on a per unit basis, said
Harrison.
Students are required to take a
minimum number of units, she
said, although this requirement
is waived for certain evening
classes.
Graduate students are re
quired to take 3 units and under
graduates must enroll in 8 units.
The cost for the first three units is
$556 and each unit after that
costs $152.
