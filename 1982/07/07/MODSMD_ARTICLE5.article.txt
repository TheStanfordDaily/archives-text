## Farmers may get subsidies 
### Washington Post 
Washington — The Reagan
administration is under growing
pressure to treat the ailing farm
economy with medicine that has
a philosophically unsavory taste
— paying farmers not to plant
crops.
Several prominent con
gressional Republicans, the con
servative American Farm Bureau
federation, the National Grange
and the National Association of
Wheat Growers are among those
leaning on the Department of
Agriculture to adopt a paid
acreage set-aside program.
They are urging Secretary
John Block to pay farmers not to
plant — a step viewed with dis
favor by most free-market ad
vocates — reasoning that it will
save the federal government
money in the long run.
The alternative, they argue, is
that federal budget exposure

through crop loans and direct
subsidy payments next year is
likely to surpass the $12 billion in
outlays now being calculated for
fiscal 1982.
Furthermore, they say, poten
tially huge crops this year will
further load the American gran
ary and push farmers' prices
down further on wheat, corn,
rice and cotton. Net farm in
come in 1982 is expected to be at
its lowest since 1933, partly be
cause of large stocks of basic
grains.
Although his department has
until Aug. 15 to make a decision,
Block is expected to announce
in the next two weeks his plans
for dealing with next year's
wheat crop. He has until Nov. 15
to rule on other major crops.
Options under USDA con
sideration include no acreage

control program, a continuation
of the current voluntary pro
gram, a paid acreage diversion
or a combination of the latter
two.
Wheat farmers have been
critical of Block for announcing
the voluntary program last fall af
ter most had planted their winter
wheat, which now looms as a
bumper crop that could push
the nation's stockpile to an all
time high.
