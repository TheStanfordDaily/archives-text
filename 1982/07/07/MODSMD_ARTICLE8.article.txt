# NEA: a political union
## 
### Los Angeles Times 
Los Angeles — In the last 10
years, the National Education
Association has transformed
itself from a placid teachers as
sociation into what many Demo
cratic Party pros say is the most
politically powerful union in the
nation. With 1.7 million mem
bers, the NEA ranks second in
size only to the Teamsters.
Yet, for all the political clout,
the average classroom teacher,
by the NEA's own estimate, is
worse off now than in 1972. Pay
scales have gone from bad to
worse, and the status of public
respect for school teachers is
sinking.
In a 1981 survey, the NEA
found that only 22 percent of
teachers said they would defi
nitely go into teaching if they
were starting college again, a de
crease from the more than 50
percent who were well satisfied
with their teaching career in a
similar 1961 survey.
Even politics had turned sour

for the teachers union as its 8000
delegates gathered for their na
tional convention over the
weekend here. When the group
last met here in 1980, then-Presi
dent Jimmy Carter flew out from
Washington to thank the teach
ers for their help.
In 1976, the union endorsed its
first presidential candidate —
Carter — and then greatly
helped the incumbent ward off
the challenge of Sen. Edward
Kennedy (D-Mass.), in the 1980
primaries.
In return, Carter lobbied hard
to create a U.S. Department of
Education — the NEA's top
priority — and the House even
tually passed the necessary legis
lation by four votes. Carter also
helped increase federal aid to
education.
But Carter also lost in 1980,
and the Reagan administration is
in the process of reversing what
the NEA gained through the
Carter years.
President Ronald Reagan also

flew out from Washington to
California this weekend, but he
turned down the NEA's request
to address the convention, citing
a "schedule conflict," which
turned out to be a vacation at his
Santa Barbara ranch.
" 'Shut out' is the best way to
describe our relationship" with
the Reagan White House, said
the NEA's 44-year-oid executive
director, Terry Herndon, the
architect of the NEA's switch
from a professional association
to a politically oriented union.
Earlier this year, Herndon un
expectedly announced that he
would resign from the post he
has held since 1973. He has said
only that he wants to pursue oth
er, unspecified lines of work.
Herndon and NEA President
Willard McGuire remain confi
dent that political organizing is
the key to success for teachers
and say that the 1980 defeat will
only cause the union to re
double its efforts for Democratic
candidates.
