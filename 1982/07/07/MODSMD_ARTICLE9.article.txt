## Viewpoint/Nawfal Umari Israeli attack consistent with past policies 
### 
The Israeli assault on Lebanon
has pricked the conscience of
some supporters of the Jewish
State. They wonder whether the
Catholic Relief Agency report
that there were 14,000 Lebanese
and Palistinian civilians killed,
20,000 wounded and 500,000
rendered homeless might in
dicate that Israel has "lost its
soul" or is on the way to losing it.
Can Israel sink to the level of
PLO terrorists who last summer
killed six Israeli civilians in a bar
rage of artillery fire?
Israel bombed and shelled
Lebanese towns and villages and
Palestinian refugees from land,
sea and air, and with the most so
phisticated weapons.
To strengthen its bargaining
position, Israel last week de
stroyed heavily populated areas
of Beirut in which there was no
armed Palestinian presence
whatsoever (network news). The
bombardment was so in
discriminate that a shell found its
way into the living room of a
dean on the American Univer
sity of Beirut campus, far from
such legitimate targets as the
ravaged slums of Beirut and
PLO-run hospitals (New York
Times, June 27).
To the Palestinians, it is not as
self-evident as it appears to be in
the United States that Israel is
burdened with a meticulous re
gard for human rights. The
Palestinians have, after all, been
dispossessed of their homeland
and can speak with the authority
of refugee camp dwellers. To
them it is abundantly clear that
the Jewish state has little place
for the non-Jewish indigenous
inhabitants of Palestine, and
they have been under no il
lusions as to the status of Israel's
soul. It is to them disingenuous
to suggest that Israel's attack on
Lebanon constitutes a break
with the past, for there is a great
deal of consistency in what Israel
does. This is its final solution.
Despite Golda Meir's 1969
declaration that "they donot ex
ist," the Palestinians have re
fused to disappear. In their in
sistence upon the reconstitution
of their society they remain the
most serious obstacle to Zionist
absolutism. Even as the PLO de
ferred its goal of a non-sectarian
state in all of Palestine to the in
definite future, and expressed a
willingness to accept a mini-state
on the West Bank and Gaza, Is
rael declared the West Bank to
be liberated Judea and Sumaria,

and hence non-negotiable. The
difficulty, of course, is that over
1,000,000 Palestinians now live
under Israeli occupation and not
only refuse to go away, but look
to the PLO as the embodiment of
their national aspirations and as
their political representative.
In light of this the Israeli objec
tive of destroying the terrorist
gangs translates into the objec
tive of eliminating the Palesti
nians as anything more than ref
ugees to be dealt with by relief
agencies, and preparing the way
for the annexation of the West
Bank and Gaza. The carnage in
Lebanon cannot be separated
from the removal of elected
mayors, the shooting of demon
strators, the repeated closure of
universities, the requisition of
Arab land, and intensified Israeli
settlement on the West Bank and
Gaza.
Israel pleads the safety of its
northern settlements as justifi
cation for the trail of death and
destruction its army has left in its
wake. Yet from the cease fire of
July 1981 to May 9,1982, not one
rocket was fired into Israel from
Lebanon. The PLO, mistakenly
thinking that restraint might
have some impact on U.S. policy,
did not retaliate when Israel
bombed targets in Lebanon on
April 21. Renewed bombing on
May 9 provoked PLO shelling of
open fields and no damage was
reported by Israel. After the at
tempted assassination of the Is
raeli ambassador to Britain by an
anti-PLO group, the Israeli air
force launched major raids on
Beirut and southern Lebanon,
leaving more than 100 civilians
dead. It is only then that the PLO
shelled Israeli settlements, kill
ing one soldier and inducing a
heart attack in a civilian (Village
Voice, June 22). The full-scale in
vasion that followed has been
cynically referred to by Reagan,
Haig, and Kirkpatrick as a reac
tion to the PLO shelling.
According to Menachem Be
gin the invasion is "one of the
noblest military endeavours in
history." This noble endeavor is
the culmination of a decade of
systematic attacks on civilian
targets aimed at turning the pop
ulation against the guerillas; it is
also a reenactment of that other
highpoint of human achieve
ment, the U.S. bombing of de
fenseless peasants in Vietnam.
The fruits of Israel's efforts
have yet to be fully tabulated,

but what is emerging is a picture
of widespread devastation. Vil
lages no longer exist and large
areas of cities are in ruins. Refu
gee camps under Israeli control
are being methodically de
stroyed by bulldozers and demo
lition teams. (" 'They are all ter
rorists,' an army officer said,
when asked why bulldozers
were knocking down houses in
which women and children
were living." (NYT, July 3).
The hallmark of the Israeli in
vasion has been the wholesale
slaughter of civilians. As early as
mid-June the International Red
Cross estimated that 10,000 had
been killed and 16,000
wounded. Doctors at the Ameri
can University Hospital in Beirut
report that 1100 limbs were am
putated on June 13 alone (VV,
June 29). The hideous affects of
the use of fragmentation,
cluster, and phosphorous
bombs on the civilian popu
lation have been described by
Norwegian doctors working in
Lebanon (Los Angeles Times,
June 13). The last day of the bom
bing of Beirut before the June 26
ceasefire resulted in 2000 casual
ties {network news). Meanwhile

the Israeli navy has turned back
Red Cross ships carrying medical
supplies into Lebanon (Guard
ian, June 21).
Israel refuses to recognize the
6000 Palestinians and Lebanese it
has captured as prisoners of war.
In a press conference in Oslo
two weeks ago, Norwegian doc
tors disclosed that they had wit
nessed the beating of prisoners
with clubs and the murdering of
10 Israeli soldiers. (BBC). Reports
tell of blindfolded prisoners
lined up to be marked with
crosses or stamped with the Star
of David to show that they have
been processed, and then taken
to Israel in nets carried under
helicopters (VV June 29).
That Israel seeks to live in
peace with its neighbors is now
as implausible as ever. The mass
murders perpetrated on the
Lebanese and Palestinian people
with American-supplied weap
ons and with American political
cover is unlikely to be forgotten
in the Arab world. Israel would
do well to consider the long-run
implications of its policy of ter
rorism and occupation.

have some impact on U.S. policy,
did not retaliate when Israel
bombed targets in Lebanon on
April 21. Renewed bombing on
May 9 provoked PLO shelling of
open fields and no damage was
reported by Israel. After the at
tempted assassination of the Is
raeli ambassador to Britain by an
anti-PLO group, the Israeli air
force launched major raids on
Beirut and southern Lebanon,
leaving more than 100 civilians
dead. It is only then that the PLO
shelled Israeli settlements, kill
ing one soldier and inducing a
heart attack in a civilian (Village
Voice, June 22). The full-scale in
vasion that followed has been
cynically referred to by Reagan,
Haig, and Kirkpatrick as a reac
tion to the PLO shelling.
According to Menachem Be
gin the invasion is "one of the
noblest military endeavours in
history." This noble endeavor is
the culmination of a decade of
systematic attacks on civilian
targets aimed at turning the pop
ulation against the guerillas; it is
also a reenactment of that other
highpoint of human achieve
ment, the U.S. bombing of de
fenseless peasants in Vietnam.
The fruits of Israel's efforts
have yet to be fully tabulated,

but what is emerging is a picture
of widespread devastation. Vil
lages no longer exist and large
areas of cities are in ruins. Refu
gee camps under Israeli control
are being methodically de
stroyed by bulldozers and demo
lition teams. (" 'They are all ter
rorists,' an army officer said,
when asked why bulldozers
were knocking down houses in
which women and children
were living." (NYT, July 3).
The hallmark of the Israeli in
vasion has been the wholesale
slaughter of civilians. As early as
mid-June the International Red
Cross estimated that 10,000 had
been killed and 16,000
wounded. Doctors at the Ameri
can University Hospital in Beirut
report that 1100 limbs were am
putated on June 13 alone (VV,
June 29). The hideous affects of
the use of fragmentation,
cluster, and phosphorous
bombs on the civilian popu
lation have been described by
Norwegian doctors working in
Lebanon (Los Angeles Times,
June 13). The last day of the bom
bing of Beirut before the June 26
ceasefire resulted in 2000 casual
ties {network news). Meanwhile

the Israeli navy has turned back
Red Cross ships carrying medical
supplies into Lebanon (Guard
ian, June 21).
Israel refuses to recognize the
6000 Palestinians and Lebanese it
has captured as prisoners of war.
In a press conference in Oslo
two weeks ago, Norwegian doc
tors disclosed that they had wit
nessed the beating of prisoners
with clubs and the murdering of
10 Israeli soldiers. (BBC). Reports
tell of blindfolded prisoners
lined up to be marked with
crosses or stamped with the Star
of David to show that they have
been processed, and then taken
to Israel in nets carried under
helicopters (VV June 29).
That Israel seeks to live in
peace with its neighbors is now
as implausible as ever. The mass
murders perpetrated on the
Lebanese and Palestinian people
with American-supplied weap
ons and with American political
cover is unlikely to be forgotten
in the Arab world. Israel would
do well to consider the long-run
implications of its policy of ter
rorism and occupation.

The Israeli assault on Lebanon
has pricked the conscience of
some supporters of the Jewish
State. They wonder whether the
Catholic Relief Agency report
that there were 14,000 Lebanese
and Palistinian civilians killed,
20,000 wounded and 500,000
rendered homeless might in
dicate that Israel has "lost its
soul" or is on the way to losing it.
Can Israel sink to the level of
PLO terrorists who last summer
killed six Israeli civilians in a bar
rage of artillery fire?
Israel bombed and shelled
Lebanese towns and villages and
Palestinian refugees from land,
sea and air, and with the most so
phisticated weapons.
To strengthen its bargaining
position, Israel last week de
stroyed heavily populated areas
of Beirut in which there was no
armed Palestinian presence
whatsoever (network news). The
bombardment was so in
discriminate that a shell found its
way into the living room of a
dean on the American Univer
sity of Beirut campus, far from
such legitimate targets as the
ravaged slums of Beirut and
PLO-run hospitals (New York
Times, June 27).
To the Palestinians, it is not as
self-evident as it appears to be in
the United States that Israel is
burdened with a meticulous re
gard for human rights. The
Palestinians have, after all, been
dispossessed of their homeland
and can speak with the authority
of refugee camp dwellers. To
them it is abundantly clear that
the Jewish state has little place
for the non-Jewish indigenous
inhabitants of Palestine, and
they have been under no il
lusions as to the status of Israel's
soul. It is to them disingenuous
to suggest that Israel's attack on
Lebanon constitutes a break
with the past, for there is a great
deal of consistency in what Israel
does. This is its final solution.
Despite Golda Meir's 1969
declaration that "they donot ex
ist," the Palestinians have re
fused to disappear. In their in
sistence upon the reconstitution
of their society they remain the
most serious obstacle to Zionist
absolutism. Even as the PLO de
ferred its goal of a non-sectarian
state in all of Palestine to the in
definite future, and expressed a
willingness to accept a mini-state
on the West Bank and Gaza, Is
rael declared the West Bank to
be liberated Judea and Sumaria,

and hence non-negotiable. The
difficulty, of course, is that over
1,000,000 Palestinians now live
under Israeli occupation and not
only refuse to go away, but look
to the PLO as the embodiment of
their national aspirations and as
their political representative.
In light of this the Israeli objec
tive of destroying the terrorist
gangs translates into the objec
tive of eliminating the Palesti
nians as anything more than ref
ugees to be dealt with by relief
agencies, and preparing the way
for the annexation of the West
Bank and Gaza. The carnage in
Lebanon cannot be separated
from the removal of elected
mayors, the shooting of demon
strators, the repeated closure of
universities, the requisition of
Arab land, and intensified Israeli
settlement on the West Bank and
Gaza.
Israel pleads the safety of its
northern settlements as justifi
cation for the trail of death and
destruction its army has left in its
wake. Yet from the cease fire of
July 1981 to May 9,1982, not one
rocket was fired into Israel from
Lebanon. The PLO, mistakenly
thinking that restraint might
have some impact on U.S. policy,
did not retaliate when Israel
bombed targets in Lebanon on
April 21. Renewed bombing on
May 9 provoked PLO shelling of
