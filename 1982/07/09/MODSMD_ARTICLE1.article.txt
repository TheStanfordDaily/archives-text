# 45 cent hike effective Sept. 1
## Student minimum wage to rise here 
### Karen Springen 
The University minimum
wage for student employees
will increase from $3.85 to
$4.30 effective Sept. 1, accord
ing to Mary Roberts, assistant
director of financial aids.
The 11.5 percent increase
will coincide with the salary
increase given to University
staff each fall. "These are
based on the (staff) salary in
creases that were given to
us," said Roberts.
Vince DeAnda, assistant di
rector of financial aids, said,
"(The student minimum
wage increase) generally
coincides with the salary in
crease of other staff."
DeAnda pointed to the dif
ference between the Univer
sity $3.85 minimum wage and
the U.S. $3.35 minimum
wage. "Minimum wage here
in this area is almost extinct,"

he said.
A personnel committee,
which included members of
the library, food service and
provost's staff, approved the
increase.
Hourly wages in the Uni
versity are dependent upon
the level of work and ap
plicable experience. The
wage scales are intended for
use in the undergraduate job
program during the academic
year.
The University currently
uses two student wage sched
ules. Schedule A includes
hourly wage rates for library,
food service and Faculty Club
work. Schedule B includes a
range of hourly wage rates for
broader job categories than
found in schedule A. Wage
rates are more flexible than in
schedule A.
