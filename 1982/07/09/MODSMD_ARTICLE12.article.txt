## Article distorts Lebanon crisis 
### 
Mark Lautman's apologia for
the Israeli invasion of Lebanon
(Daily, july 2) was a masterful ex
ample of the use of irrelevant
data, distortion, and innuendo.
For example, to convince us
that Israel had not been"the
cause of most (if not all) violence
in the Middle East," Lautman re
cites names of Arab leaders who
have been assassinated, and
Arab regimes toppled by coups
d'etats. Whatever relevance
these data have to an analysis of
the present war in Lebanon is
unspecified, for an obvious rea
son: there is no relevance. By
way of comparison, one might
conceive of Roberto
d'Aubuisson and other
Salvadoran fascists telling the
world that they are not respon
sible for all violence in the
Western Hemisphere, pointing
to the assassination of John Ken
nedy as a way of absolving them
selves from their own acts.
Lautman makes similar use of
alleged statistics. He writes that
the current war in Lebanon "has
resulted in 10,000 dead (by Arab
estimates)," insinuating that this
estimate is unreliable. In fact, the
source for this estimate is the

Lebanese Red Crescent, the In
ternational Red Cross affiliate in
Lebanon. Lautman conveniently
forgot to mention the source, as
suming that he was even aware
of it.
However, Lautman is quick to
compare the Red Crescent
death statistics to the alleged
"100,000 lives" lost in the past 12
years by "PLO-incited vio
lence." Again, no source is given
for the casualty figure; note,
though, Lautman's character
ization of these alleged deaths as
due to "PLO-incited violence."
In light of the amazing fac
tionalism which apparently ex
ists in Lebanon, it is difficult to
believe that the PLO is solely re
sponsible for violence amongst
Arabs. Lautman's ideology, how
ever, does not allow him to con
sider this possibility.
Lautman is also outraged that
television news reports have al
legedly not mentioned Israeli re
lief effort in those parts of Leba
non overrun by the Israeli De
fense (sic) Forces. Although I do
not watch television, the San
Francisco Chronicle and Chris
tian Science Monitor have both
described these relief efforts.
The Chronicle photo coverage
of the war, in fact, with the Ã¼bi
quitous exuberant Israeli sol
diers, exhausted Syrian POWs,
and Lebanese refugees grateful
for an Israeli handout, smacks
strongly of propaganda. Laut
man is strangely oblivious to this
"news" coverage, as he extols Is
raeli rebuilding of the cities of
Tyre and Sidon, "unfortunately"
destroyed in the war (just as
Hiroshima and Nagasaki were
"unfortunately" atom-bombed,
or Vietnamese peasants were
"unfortunately" driven from
their lar.d by U.S. bombing).
Lautman also makes the
astonishing statement that "of all
the complaints about Lebanese
suffering, the people who are
not complaining are the Leba
nese themselves," citing as proof
that "there was a demonstration
in Los Angeles by Lebanese na
tionals in support of the in
vasion." Who these demonstrat
ors were (perhaps Phalangists,
enemies of the PLO, yet only one
small faction in Lebanon) is ob
viously of no interest to Laut
man, as he is sure that they rep
resent all Lebanese. We can as
sume that Lautman has not
polled the estimated 600,000

people made refugees by the
war (the figure is from the Red
Crescent) for their opinions of
the invasion.
Lautman is certain that "one
cannot help but also blame the
PLO for the Lebanese carnage,"
as these sneaky devils do not
avail themselves of the "hilly
countryside of Lebanon," so
"ideal for terrorists," but rather
mingle with the Palestinian
brethren. The notion that large
PLO military camps might be sit
ting ducks for Israeli bombers
and the several paramilitary
groups opposed to the Palesti
nian presence in Lebanon has
escaped Lautman's considera
tion.
Note also his standard descrip
tion of the PLO as "terrorists," an
appellation he would never
dream of attaching to an army
that creates hundreds of
thousands of refugees and once
had a habit of blowing up the
family dwellings of alleged West
Bank "terrorists."
Lastly, Lautman assures us that
"Israel has always been willing to
negotiate with the Palestinians,
but not with the PLO." The PLO,
which is an umbrella organiza
tion with political and military
wings, is widely considered to
represent the majority of the
Palestinian people. Although
the current Israeli government
prefers to appoint puppets and
negotiate with them, this is hard
ly a rational way to deal with the
Palestinians, who believe their
interests to be represented by
the PLO. Negotiations, by their
very nature, take place between
adversaries. Were President
Reagan to announce his willing
ness to negotiate with the Rus
sian, Ukrainian, Georgian, and
Uzbek people, but not the Sovi
et government, he would be
considered a fool, yet, the
analogous position taken by the
Israeli government is applauded
by Lautman and many other
Americans.
After millenia of persecution, I
would have thought that my fel
low Jews in Israel would realize
that enforced second-class
citizenship is an unstable, cruel
situation. I seem to be mistaken
in this conclusion.
