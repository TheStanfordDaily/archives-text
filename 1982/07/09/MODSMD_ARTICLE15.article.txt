# Exercise your initiative
## Aerobic dance: exertion that's 'heartily'supported 
### Taleen Marashian 
If you want a new way to work
up a sweat without donning a
grubby sweatshirt and pounding
the ol' asphalt pavement in 90
degree summer heat, you might
try morning aerobic exercise.
Imagine being with 60 talkative
people stretching to the theme
of Magnum P.I. or the classic
"Flight of the Bumblebees."
It sounds like light and easy
fun. But before you run to your
closet and dig up the leotard you
used in fourth grade when you
took ballet for three weeks, be
prepared for the aerobics dance
program.
Numerous exercise classes set
to music exist in the Bay Area.
The aerobic fitness courses,
which began about eight years
ago, are more than a fad.
Exercise has changed since fit
ness-crazy Jack LaLanne first per
formed his daily routines on the
television screen. Ten short
years later, peppy Joannie Greg
gains followed suit with her
energetic "one twos" set to mu
sic each weekday at 6:30 a.m.
Exercising with the stars is not
limited to television only. The
health-conscious can exercise to
the beat on Jane Fonda's new
workout record, or even stretch
to Mickey Mouse's Mousercise
album — complete with an il

lustrated instructor's manual.
Mickey, Donald Duck, and
Goofy take turns demonstrating
various stretching techniques in
the colorful booklet.
Many colleges are using aero
bic dance to help train the mem
bers of their football and basket
ball teams.
Stanford's football secretary,
Susan Morton, teaches dance in
Menlo Park. Her class includes
several male students. She once
taught various dance classes at
Dartmouth College for its first
string basketball and football
players. With encouragement
from their coaches, the players
took Morton's aerobic dance
classes for flexibility, stamina,
strength and conditioning.
Morton said "there has been a
tremendous favorable response
by coaches and the department"
among footcall coaches here.
The nation-wide Jazzercise
program is offered at Terman
Middle School and at Gunn High
School. Participants jump, skip,
and twist to a wide variety of mu
sic.
I attended one Saturday morn
ing class in Terman Middle
School's cafeteria. Determined
that I would enthusiastically take
part in the whole hour of vigor
ous dancing, I clutched my of
ficial coupon for a free lesson

and headed for the Terman site.
To my amazement, I had a hard
time finding a place to park.
Upon entering the cafeteria, I
discovered more than 50 people
stretching and warming up
before class. The average partici
pant seemed to be female, 32
years of age, and dressed in a
light blue leotard with white
tightj. The class included a 12-
year-old and three males.
The instructor, Barbara Kain,
maintained the same energy
level throughout the one-hour
class.
Kain stressed weight-loss dur
ing the class. After class, she
pointed out one man who has
lost 25 pounds taking her class.
Kain said, "(During jazzer
cize) you let your mind go

on vacation while your body
works overtime." She added that
aerobic dance is more than a fad.
Nichole Rosenberg, an aero
bics teacher at Stanford, said her
class is oriented toward
cardiovascular improvement
rather than weight loss.
Rosenberg patterns her class
after Jane Fonda's record. She
said jazzercise leans toward
dance while her class is more ex
ercise-oriented.
Men tend to shy away from
such a program. "Guys think it
may be hard, but it's not. It really
is easy," she said.
The Palo Alto YMCA has two
aerobic programs. The YMCA
has offered aerobic dance since
it began in September, 1974. It
has since become a nation-wide

phenomenon.
YMCA aerobic programs offer
a good workout on a more per
sonal basis than the widely ad
vertised larger classes such as
jazzercise.
Unlike jazzercise, the YMCA
rhythm fitness program is one
12-week session. Each class in
cludes 12 minutes of warm-up
exercises and 35 to 40 minutes
learning and practicing various
dance routines.
The course emphasizes a vig
orous cardiovascular workout.
Instructor Lynn McGrath said
rhythm fitness, unlike
jazzercize, requires thinking. "If
you don't want to think, you
shouldn't take the class," she
said.
McGrath stressed that con
centration is needed to memo
rize steps for the dances.

on vacation while your body
works overtime." She added that
aerobic dance is more than a fad.
Nichole Rosenberg, an aero
bics teacher at Stanford, said her
class is oriented toward
cardiovascular improvement
rather than weight loss.
Rosenberg patterns her class
after Jane Fonda's record. She
said jazzercise leans toward
dance while her class is more ex
ercise-oriented.
Men tend to shy away from
such a program. "Guys think it
may be hard, but it's not. It really
is easy," she said.
The Palo Alto YMCA has two
aerobic programs. The YMCA
has offered aerobic dance since
it began in September, 1974. It
has since become a nation-wide

phenomenon.
YMCA aerobic programs offer
a good workout on a more per
sonal basis than the widely ad
vertised larger classes such as
jazzercise.
Unlike jazzercise, the YMCA
rhythm fitness program is one
12-week session. Each class in
cludes 12 minutes of warm-up
exercises and 35 to 40 minutes
learning and practicing various
dance routines.
The course emphasizes a vig
orous cardiovascular workout.
Instructor Lynn McGrath said
rhythm fitness, unlike
jazzercize, requires thinking. "If
you don't want to think, you
shouldn't take the class," she
said.
McGrath stressed that con
centration is needed to memo
rize steps for the dances.
