Young Frankenstein
Tonight, Cubberley Auditorium
Mel Brooks directed this
faithful sendup of Mary Shelley's
tale of a man who dares to play
Cod. Young Frankenstein is
probably the best Brooks movie
— there's a trace of real affection
here, something I've never
before or since detected in the
director's work. The Mel Brooks
Repertory Players are all in fine
form. Gene Wilder stars 4s the

Frankenstein heir who creates a
monster that looks alarmingly
like Peter Boyle. Cloris leachman
plays Frau Bllicher, a woman
whose very name causes panic in
rhe streets. And the ever-present
Madelaine Kahn portrays a nice
girl who learns to love life and
live love. The sets, some of them
restored from the original Uni
versal Studios version, and the
black-and-white photography
contribute much toward the
movie's success.
