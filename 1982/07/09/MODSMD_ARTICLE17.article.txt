## Beatles redux: 'Reel Music,' phony record

One of the most deplorable
aspects of the entertainment
business is its twisting of original
and innovative ideas for the
profit of others. If one just thinks
about the film industry, one is
amazed at the amount of ripoffs
that occur in order to capitalize
on the public's current interest.
Many sequels to originally ex
cellent films, such as American
Graffiti II and Death Wish 11, are
fine examples of this downright
greed on behalf of the film com
panies.
This same greed is prevalent in
the recording industry as well.
Any musical artist or group that
has exceeded the usual quota of
success and then died or dis
banded is usually subjected to
gross musical misrepresenta
tions and ripoffs. Just a quick
glance at any Elvis Presley or jimi
Hendrix album catalog will re
veal an exceptionally large
number of terrible "greatest
hits" packages. These records
are not fitting memorials or re
spectful repackages; rather, they
were released in order to make a
quick buck with total disregard
for the artist's musical reputa
tion.
Of course, not all record com
panies have been unkind to the
artists that have made them
prosperous. In the case of the

Beatles, Capitol Records ac
corded the group with excellent,
carefully thought-out album re
packages following the group's
demise. They released a well-ar
ranged greatest hits collection
along with the historic Live At
The Hollywood Bowl album.
Even the last Beatles' compila
tion, Beatles' Rarities, had
enough rare and obscure mate
rial to keep even the avid Beatles
fan happy. The reason for these
respectful repackages could be
that Capitol felt it owed the band
much, since it was the Beatles
who made the company suc
cessful. And since in the early
'60s, Capitol abused the group's
material (remember the 1964
Beatles release, Something New,
that had almost nothing new!), it
is possible that they thought that
by acting respectful to the de
funct band, they could repay the
Beatles.
However, since the last re
package, the world has grown
even more affectionate and
nostalgic about the Beatles. With
john Lennon's death and all the
phony tributes that have oc
cupied the charts (such as the
"Stars On 45" medley), it's only a
matter of time until Capitol
jumped on the bandwagon. I
kept up my hopes that they'd still
be respectful and release some
unreleased* outtakes or some
rare cuts at a discounted price.
However, these hopes were ru
ined upon the release of Reel
Beatles. I was too naive in my

hope that this album would con
tain unreleased and rare materi
al.
On closer examination of the
record, I found 14 songs that
were from the Beatles' films — A
Hard Day's Night, Help!, Magi-

cal Mystery Tour, Yellow Sub
marine, and Let It Be. However,
all of the songs had been re
leased at least a couple of times
before, and there was not an ob
scure cut in the lot. I mean, how
many duplications of "Can't Buy
Me Love" (fifth time on vinyl) or
"And I Love Her" (an amazing
sixth-time release) would any
person want? To add to the
ripoff, there is not one tune from
George Harrison. To completely
ignore his superb contributions
to the Beatles' soundtrack mate
rial is a slap in the face to the
group. Above all, though, the
biggest ripoff is that the album is

being price-listed at a dollar
higher ($9.98) than the usual
album price. Capitol seems in
tent on deceiving the public by
re-releasing older material and
charging a higher price for it.
Therefore, this album is not

only a disrespectful use of power
against the Beatles, but it is a
downright robbery of the pub
lic. Any Beatles' record is guar
anteed to sell well, so Capitol has
stooped to its lowest maneuver
yet. I would not recommend this
album at all to an unintroduced
record buyer. Any other Beatles'
record is far more informative
and excellent. The only person
to whom I would recommend
this album is the fanatic Beatles
collector who must own every
piece of Beatles' music in ex
istence. To this fan, the "borius"
(some bonus when you're
paying $9.98 for a record where

you know every song by heart
before even playing it!) 12-page
booklet is the only recompense
for the ripoff. This booklet con
tains some unreleased excellent
stills and photos from all of the
Beatles' films and some "behind
the scenes" shots as well.
The major fault with Capitol,
though, is the fact that this
album could have been pack
aged far better. If the company
was so intent on releasing a
"Reel Beatles" album, then it
could have presented some un
released material from the
soundtracks of both the popular
and rarer films of the Beatles.
The live rooftop concert during
the finale of the "Let It Be" film
would have been graciously wel
come (sorry folks, the Let It Be
album doesn't contain any
soundtrack material from the
film, no matter what anyone
says). Also, any film music from
their many English and European
video specials, such as a frenetic
version of "Shout" (from the
BBC Around the Beatles special
in 1964) or live versions of "Pa
perback Writer" or "Day Trip
per" (from the Live in Tokyo '66
TV special) would easily have
been more satisfying to all con
cerned. And I think that these
would even sell better than re
hashed older material. But until
the record companies change
their ways, I guess the Beatles
were fully aware of the state of
things — including their own
record company — when they
sang, "Christ, you know it ain't
easy; the way things are going,
they're gonna crucify me!"
