## SPYRO GYRA 'S MUSICAL STRATEGY 
### Mark Zeigler Spyro Gyra 
Great American Music Hall/San
Francisco
19 June 1982
It's easy to forget about things
when 300 people's screams echo
off the cozy Great American
Music Hall's walls, sounding like
a thousand. It's just as easy to
lose track of time when the stac
cato claps and foot stomps of the
crowd register 7.9 on the Richter
scale.
Spyro Gyra found out almost
too late just how easy it is. But
saxophonist and band leader Jay
Beckenstein stopped things
before they got to the critical
point.
Catching a moment's breath,
Beckenstein also caught a quick
glimpse of his watch and ex
perienced a short, but accurate
reminder from his memory. The
time: 10:45 p.m. What he re
membered: Spyro Gyra's next
show was at 11:00 p.m. — that
evening. Without a moment's
hesitation, it was goodnight for
good.
"Goodnight" was about all the
curly-haired saxophonist could
do after two encores that topped
an amazing show. Anything else
would have been anticlimactic.
Spyro Gyra, which got its start
in Buffalo, New York, is on the
verge of becoming a seriously
popular jazz/fusion band, a few
hit songs from reaching the level
of, say, a Grover Washington, Jr.
Judging from the reaction of the
Great American Music Hall sold
out crowd, though, they have al
ready left that goal in their wake.
To call the Music Hall small isa
gross understatement. But to call
the people that fill it lack
adaisical is just as much a faulty
verbalization. And these fans do
not "give" appreciation in re
sponse to a worthy per
formance, they "demonstrate"
it, and quite loudly at that. No
song was without a huge ovation
and Spyro Gyra's initial de
parture from the miniscule stage
was met "with clapping and foot
stomping in unison and hun
dreds of cries for more.
Nevertheless, it was all well
deserved. Besides playing a
selection of tunes from their five
LPs, Spyro Gyra unveiled three
new songs from an album to be
released in late September. If the
trio of new tunes is any indica
tion, their 1982 LP should be
their best. In the past two years,
the six-man group has been pro
lific to say the least, releasing
three albums. However, Spyro

Probably the most common
criticism of Spyro Gyra is that
their songs, besides sounding
similar, often contain a sort of
happy-go-lucky twist, which can
reduce or even eliminate the se
riousness and emotion from
their music. But once one has
seen Spyro Gyra live, such a
thought will never cross his mind
again. The sextet is all business
on stage, inserting whatever se
riousness and emotion is missing
on their albums.
One thing Spyro Gyra cannot
be faulted for is their utterly un
pretentious stage presence. To
begin the show, six men simply
walked on stage with their in
struments, and began to play. No
screams into the microphone,
no "It's great to be back in San
Francisco" bullshit lines. And
perfectly complementing Spyro
Gyra's entrance was the Great
American Music Hall, which
didn't waste time with a needless
introduction; everyone knew
who they paid $10 to see and
those who didn't must have
been under the influence of
some Far Eastern hallucinogenic.
Because the group has not re

cently released an album, it had
more time to experiment and to
showcase the extremely talented
band members. A usual Spyro
Gyra performance is a tightly
woven 10-song array of old and
new material, with slightly ad
justed concert versions of these
tunes. This show, however, was a
bit different. Each of the six had a
chance to solo without the band
as a backdrop. The solos were
not overly long and not jumbled
together in one song. Perhaps
the most refreshing one of all
was Will Lee's bass solo, con
spicuously absent from Spyro
Gyra's last SF appearance in Sep
tember 1981. Lee proved that he
can be both fluid and funky,
demonstrating his true sense of
rhythm.
And speaking of rhythm, per
cussionist Gerardo Velez is a
show in himself. The Brazilian,
who brings Spyro Gyra its Latin
influence, doesn't stop dancing
while simultaneously playing his
multiple percussion instruments
from the first note of the first
song. When his hands were oc
cupied, Velez would hit a cym
bal with his foot or bang a drum
with his head. Unless the GAMH
had shower facilities backstage,
the Brazilian would have to ap

pear in the second show
drenched with sweat.
Also adding international
flavor to the band is drummer Eli
Konikoff, who had the un
fortunate luck of having to play
while sitting in the Music Hall's
fireplace. To Konikoff's left, be
hind a fortress of keyboards, was
Tom Schuman, who might be re
lated to the great pianist. At least
he plays like he is.
Chet Catallo is perhaps the
most surprising of the sextet, as
his performance on the LPs is not

too impressive for a band of
Spyro Gyra's caliber. But
Catallo's concert performance
erases any misconceptions
about his ability. The guitarist's
live solos add a rock 'n roll
dimension to the group's songs;
they are packed with energy and
usually are at the climax of an
upbeat tune. Catallo is also a
capable rhythm guitarist and a
brilliant songwriter.
Band leader Beckenstein is
one of America's premier sax
ophonists. Since most of Sypro*
Gyra's music centers around a
sax, an extremely versatile player
is necessary; Beckenstein fits the
mold perfectly.
Spyro Gyra at last has adopted
a true "musical strategy" for the
future. Don't laugh. With the
downfall of the jazz/fusion mu
sic industry, experimentation
can leave a group in the streets
pawning their instruments in an
effort to survive. Some contem
porary fusion outfits like Jean-
Luc Ponty will keep doing the
same thing in the future that has
sold records in the past. Others
will radically change their music
(i.e. add vocals) to stay afloat.
Still others, like Spyro Gyra, will
slightly alter their "sound" to
gibe with changing times.
The 1982 Spyro Gyra will have
funkier basslines, with rockier
rhythms. Still, plenty of the old
Sypro Gyra will stick around. The
sextet has by no means peaked
yet, but the album in September
could be what they need to push
them to the top.
And by the way, if you're won
dering what a "Spyro Gyra" is, I
don't have the foggiest. I think
it's Portuguese for "Excellent
Band." Let's just leave it at that.


Gyra has exercised patience this
time around which should reap
sizeable dividends.

Probably the most common
criticism of Spyro Gyra is that
their songs, besides sounding
similar, often contain a sort of
happy-go-lucky twist, which can
reduce or even eliminate the se
riousness and emotion from
their music. But once one has
seen Spyro Gyra live, such a
thought will never cross his mind
again. The sextet is all business
on stage, inserting whatever se
riousness and emotion is missing
on their albums.
One thing Spyro Gyra cannot
be faulted for is their utterly un
pretentious stage presence. To
begin the show, six men simply
walked on stage with their in
struments, and began to play. No
screams into the microphone,
no "It's great to be back in San
Francisco" bullshit lines. And
perfectly complementing Spyro
Gyra's entrance was the Great
American Music Hall, which
didn't waste time with a needless
introduction; everyone knew
who they paid $10 to see and
those who didn't must have
been under the influence of
some Far Eastern hallucinogenic.
Because the group has not re

cently released an album, it had
more time to experiment and to
showcase the extremely talented
band members. A usual Spyro
Gyra performance is a tightly
woven 10-song array of old and
new material, with slightly ad
justed concert versions of these
tunes. This show, however, was a
bit different. Each of the six had a
chance to solo without the band
as a backdrop. The solos were
not overly long and not jumbled
together in one song. Perhaps
the most refreshing one of all
was Will Lee's bass solo, con
spicuously absent from Spyro
Gyra's last SF appearance in Sep
tember 1981. Lee proved that he
can be both fluid and funky,
demonstrating his true sense of
rhythm.
And speaking of rhythm, per
cussionist Gerardo Velez is a
show in himself. The Brazilian,
who brings Spyro Gyra its Latin
influence, doesn't stop dancing
while simultaneously playing his
multiple percussion instruments
from the first note of the first
song. When his hands were oc
cupied, Velez would hit a cym
bal with his foot or bang a drum
with his head. Unless the GAMH
had shower facilities backstage,
the Brazilian would have to ap

pear in the second show
drenched with sweat.
Also adding international
flavor to the band is drummer Eli
Konikoff, who had the un
fortunate luck of having to play
while sitting in the Music Hall's
fireplace. To Konikoff's left, be
hind a fortress of keyboards, was
Tom Schuman, who might be re
lated to the great pianist. At least
he plays like he is.
Chet Catallo is perhaps the
most surprising of the sextet, as
his performance on the LPs is not

too impressive for a band of
Spyro Gyra's caliber. But
Catallo's concert performance
erases any misconceptions
about his ability. The guitarist's
live solos add a rock 'n roll
dimension to the group's songs;
they are packed with energy and
usually are at the climax of an
upbeat tune. Catallo is also a
capable rhythm guitarist and a
brilliant songwriter.
Band leader Beckenstein is
one of America's premier sax
ophonists. Since most of Sypro*
Gyra's music centers around a
sax, an extremely versatile player
is necessary; Beckenstein fits the
mold perfectly.
Spyro Gyra at last has adopted
a true "musical strategy" for the
future. Don't laugh. With the
downfall of the jazz/fusion mu
sic industry, experimentation
can leave a group in the streets
pawning their instruments in an
effort to survive. Some contem
porary fusion outfits like Jean-
Luc Ponty will keep doing the
same thing in the future that has
sold records in the past. Others
will radically change their music
(i.e. add vocals) to stay afloat.
Still others, like Spyro Gyra, will
slightly alter their "sound" to
gibe with changing times.
The 1982 Spyro Gyra will have
funkier basslines, with rockier
rhythms. Still, plenty of the old
Sypro Gyra will stick around. The
sextet has by no means peaked
yet, but the album in September
could be what they need to push
them to the top.
And by the way, if you're won
dering what a "Spyro Gyra" is, I
don't have the foggiest. I think
it's Portuguese for "Excellent
Band." Let's just leave it at that.


Gyra has exercised patience this
time around which should reap
sizeable dividends.
Great American Music Hall/San
Francisco
19 June 1982
It's easy to forget about things
when 300 people's screams echo
off the cozy Great American
Music Hall's walls, sounding like
a thousand. It's just as easy to
lose track of time when the stac
cato claps and foot stomps of the
crowd register 7.9 on the Richter
scale.
Spyro Gyra found out almost
too late just how easy it is. But
saxophonist and band leader Jay
Beckenstein stopped things
before they got to the critical
point.
Catching a moment's breath,
Beckenstein also caught a quick
glimpse of his watch and ex
perienced a short, but accurate
reminder from his memory. The
time: 10:45 p.m. What he re
membered: Spyro Gyra's next
show was at 11:00 p.m. — that
evening. Without a moment's
hesitation, it was goodnight for
good.
"Goodnight" was about all the
curly-haired saxophonist could
do after two encores that topped
an amazing show. Anything else
would have been anticlimactic.
Spyro Gyra, which got its start
in Buffalo, New York, is on the
verge of becoming a seriously
popular jazz/fusion band, a few
hit songs from reaching the level
of, say, a Grover Washington, Jr.
Judging from the reaction of the
Great American Music Hall sold
out crowd, though, they have al
ready left that goal in their wake.
To call the Music Hall small isa
gross understatement. But to call
the people that fill it lack
adaisical is just as much a faulty
verbalization. And these fans do
not "give" appreciation in re
sponse to a worthy per
formance, they "demonstrate"
it, and quite loudly at that. No
song was without a huge ovation
and Spyro Gyra's initial de
parture from the miniscule stage
was met "with clapping and foot
stomping in unison and hun
dreds of cries for more.
Nevertheless, it was all well
deserved. Besides playing a
selection of tunes from their five
LPs, Spyro Gyra unveiled three
new songs from an album to be
released in late September. If the
trio of new tunes is any indica
tion, their 1982 LP should be
their best. In the past two years,
the six-man group has been pro
lific to say the least, releasing
three albums. However, Spyro
