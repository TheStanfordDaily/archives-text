The London House
630 Ramona Street
Palo Alto
321-0778
The London House caters to
two groups of diners: Californi
ans in search of the slightly ex
otic, and Britishers (native or
adopted) in search of the slightly
familiar. At first glance, this res
taurant/pub/gift shop looks like
any other nouveau californien
establishment, with its sidewalk
patio, its skylight, its racks of
jellies and crackers and teas
along the walls, and its list of cof
fee drinks on every table.
But, while the environment
may not be authentic, many of
the details — including the
menu — are. The most homesick
Londoner, or Cliveden ex
patriate, will feel a rush of
nostalgia among the crumpets
and scones at London House.
There's a good reason for
avoiding complete authenticity
in a British restaurant — England

isn't known for its food. In fact,
most Englishmen get by on a diet
that would horrify Californians
used to fresh salads and low
calorie options; English dinners
usually consist of starch, fatty
meats and salty, overcooked
vegetables. Perhaps the most im
pressive thing about the London
House is that it manages to pres
ent an authentic English menu in
a form entirely palatable to even
the most timid (or weight-con
scious) American.
This is accomplished through
a concentration on one aspect of
English cuisine, the tradition of
simple pub meals. The dishes
that define English cooking for
most Americans — beef Welling
ton, Yorkshire pudding — have
been avoided. The menu is in
two sections, "pub snacks"
($4.15-$5.95) and dinners (all at
$9.95, which includes soup or
salad, rice and vegetable). There
are nine dinner selections, none
of which (with the exception of
smoked beef tongue) would be
out of place on the menu of a

standard American restaurant.
The lighter side of the English
scale is emphasized — boned
trout, shrimp mornay, three
chicken dishes — and a sense of
the home country comes across
in the details: the fact that the
roast chicken comes with bacon,
and that one of the other
chicken dishes is a curry (a nod
to London's many Indian restau
rants).
The pub snacks are really the
heart of the menu for anyone in
the nostalgia market. The selec
tion is large, and each item
should take you back to that fa
vorite little pub where the
barman himself would bring you
rarebit, or a pastie, or sausage
rolls, or crumpets with ham and
cheese, or (a real classic) an on
ion, tomato and cheese sand
wich. The conception here is
perfect, even if the execution
isn't always all it could be — the
beef pastie we tried was of the
boring British (seemingly) pre
packaged variety. But the rarebit
is excellent, and the crumpets
with minced ham and melted
.cheddar cheese were the high
point of one visit. Most of these
dishes, with the exception of the
rarebit, come with a fresh salad,

Perhaps the most impressive thing
about the London House is that it

conscious) American.

a distinctly non-English touch.
(Another jarring note was the
use of sourdough biscuits, an
unnecessary concession to local
tastes.)
The only problem with the
pub snacks, really, is that they're

terribly overpriced. None of
them would cost over a pound
(approximately $1.70) in an Eng
lish pub; you'd have to be awful
ly homesick to pay $4.95 for a
grilled cheese, onion and
tomato sandwich.
At $9.95 for a full meal, the en
trees are a slightly better
bargain. Of course, three years

the London House was stuffed
trout for $4.95, but times change.
Having left room for only one
dinner, we decided to stay away
from the complex dishes and try
the cook's skill with a straight
forward standby, London beef
stew. It was a good choice — the
stew, consisting mainly of tender

chunks of beef and nicely
cooked carrots in a wine
flavored broth, was satisfying in
the best sense of the word. With
it came firm, tasty greenbeans
and mashed potatoes covered
with an excellent white sauce

(rather than the advertised rice).
For dessert, a fine pastry tray is
brought to the table (choose one
item for $1.95). The last tray we
saw held five different cakes,
several tarts (no custard, alas)
and scones. A full selection of
Twinings teas is available.
Service at the London House is
extraordinary, in our ex-

perience. Waiters, waitresses,

ficient and attentive without

though, that we have never seen
the restaurant more than half
full, even on a Friday night; ac

The best part may well be the
pub in the back, which is far and
away the closest thing to a real
English pub we've seen in this
area. The pub snacks can be
served there, and an impressive

available. For students, tossing
back some ale in the pub is prob

The London House
630 Ramona Street
Palo Alto
321-0778
The London House caters to
two groups of diners: Californi
ans in search of the slightly ex
otic, and Britishers (native or
adopted) in search of the slightly
familiar. At first glance, this res
taurant/pub/gift shop looks like
any other nouveau californien
establishment, with its sidewalk
patio, its skylight, its racks of
jellies and crackers and teas
along the walls, and its list of cof
fee drinks on every table.
But, while the environment
may not be authentic, many of
the details — including the
menu — are. The most homesick
Londoner, or Cliveden ex
patriate, will feel a rush of
nostalgia among the crumpets
and scones at London House.
There's a good reason for
avoiding complete authenticity
in a British restaurant — England

isn't known for its food. In fact,
most Englishmen get by on a diet
that would horrify Californians
used to fresh salads and low
calorie options; English dinners
usually consist of starch, fatty
meats and salty, overcooked
vegetables. Perhaps the most im
pressive thing about the London
House is that it manages to pres
ent an authentic English menu in
a form entirely palatable to even
the most timid (or weight-con
scious) American.
This is accomplished through
a concentration on one aspect of
English cuisine, the tradition of
simple pub meals. The dishes
that define English cooking for
most Americans — beef Welling
ton, Yorkshire pudding — have
been avoided. The menu is in
two sections, "pub snacks"
($4.15-$5.95) and dinners (all at
$9.95, which includes soup or
salad, rice and vegetable). There
are nine dinner selections, none
of which (with the exception of
smoked beef tongue) would be
out of place on the menu of a

standard American restaurant.
The lighter side of the English
scale is emphasized — boned
trout, shrimp mornay, three
chicken dishes — and a sense of
the home country comes across
in the details: the fact that the
roast chicken comes with bacon,
and that one of the other
chicken dishes is a curry (a nod
to London's many Indian restau
rants).
The pub snacks are really the
heart of the menu for anyone in
the nostalgia market. The selec
tion is large, and each item
should take you back to that fa
vorite little pub where the
barman himself would bring you
rarebit, or a pastie, or sausage
rolls, or crumpets with ham and
cheese, or (a real classic) an on
ion, tomato and cheese sand
wich. The conception here is
perfect, even if the execution
isn't always all it could be — the
beef pastie we tried was of the
boring British (seemingly) pre
packaged variety. But the rarebit
is excellent, and the crumpets
