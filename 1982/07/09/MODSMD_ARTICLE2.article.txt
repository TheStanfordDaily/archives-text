# Groups organize relief effort for Lebanon

Reacting to conditions in
Beirut, the besieged capital of
Lebanon, Bechtel International
Center Director Lee Zeigler has
helped organize the Stanford
Committee for Disaster Relief in
Lebanon. The group is working
with the American Friends Ser
vice Committee (AFSC), a
pacifist Quaker organization, to
gather humanitarian relief funds
which will be used to distribute
food, medicine, and supplies to
needy war victims.
The International Red Cross
estimates that 10,000 people
have already died in the conflict
while thousands more have
been injured and 600,000 are
homeless.
Soon after the invasion, an
AFSC relief worker described
conditions in Beirut as follows:
"Suffering of civilians in
calculable. Parts of the city un
der heavy air attack. lodayalone
100 killed, 300 wounded. In
cluded among victims were two
busloads of children going to the

United Nations Vocational Cen
ter. Many homes destroyed.
Warehouses containing food
stuffs of the government relief
committee completely de
molished. Many fires. Six am
bulances and two fire trucks
blown up. Cars buried with peo
ple inside. Overcrowding in
cities unbearable as masses flee
Israeli invasion in the South. War
refugees in their own country,
families now living in public
gardens and in the street. Hospi
tals full. Electricity out. Emer
gency aid needed."
According to Connie Jolly, a
staff worker at the AFSC's San
Francisco chapter, the AFSC'c
representative in Beirut is chan
nelling funds through a relief
network set up by the Middle
East Council of Churches. The
AFSC sent an initial sum of
$25,000. Relief supplies are dis
tributed throughout Lebanon to
needy civilians regardless of
their religious or political affilia
tions.
Everett Mendelson, a Middle

Eastern specialist associated with
the AFSC, testified before Con
gress regarding U.S. policy
towards Lebanon last week, said
Jolly. Mendelson made three
main suggestions in his presenta
tion. First, he said the United
States should pressure Israel to
end the blockade of Western
Beirut. Second, Congress should
investigate charges that Israel
has violated legal agreements
with the United States by using
American-made phosphorous
and cluster bombs for offensive
purposes. Finally, he suggested
that the U.S. government mount
a major relief operation de
signed to aid all needy parties to
the conflict in Lebanon.
Relief activities have been hin
dered by the Israeli blockade of
West Beirut. The leadership of
the Palestine Liberation Or
ganization (PLO), along with
6000 PLO troops, is centered in
West Beirut, the predominantly
Muslim section of the capital
city.
Israeli troops, aided by Chris

tian Phalange forces, have
blockaded deliveries of food,
water, and fuel to West Beirut in
an effort to force a full PLO re
treat from Lebanon. Israel has
threatened to invade West
Beirut if the PLO does not meet
Israeli demands. The seige, com
bined with the effects of in
tensive Israeli bombing, has
made conditions desperate for
the 500,000 Lebanese still living
in West Beirut. About 125,000
have been left homeless after

fleeing the city.
In response to these condi
tions, the AFSC has also
launched a public education
campaign designed to influence
American policy toward the con
flict. Drawing upon Middle
Eastern experts, the AFSC, in
coalition with other groups, is
helping to organize public fo
rums on the Lebanese conflict in
10 major regional cities includ
ing San Francisco.
