Late for the Train
561 Oak Grove
Menlo Park
321-6124
If you weren't late for the train
before you ate here, you will be
afterward. But fortunately, Late
for the Train's food more than
compensates for its slow, more
than-leisurely service.
The country-style restaurant
— featuring breakfast and lunch
only — offers "Whole Food"
prepared to order, according to
its menu. Produce is organic,
and needless to say, Late for the
Train does not add chemicals,
preservatives or artificial color
ing. You do pay for the high
quality ingredients, but then
again, an omelette here (about
$5) is five times better than an
Egg McMuffin.
Both of us insisted on ordering
omelettes — we justified this du

plication by ordering one
cheese and one avocado. Both
were declared delicious but too
buttery. The avocado ($5.50) was
stuffed with avocado, sour
cream, tomato, scallions and
parmesan cheese, and the
cheese ($4.25) was generously
filled with melted muenster,
rennettless cheddar and cream
cheese with chives.
If you're allergic to omelettes,
don't despair — Late for the
Train's menu features two pages
entitled "Other than Eggs." Fruit
kabobs ($5.15), turkey hash
($5.55), blintzes ($4.75), french
toast ($3.25) and whole grain
pancakes ($3.55) provide a few
alternatives. Others include
salads, soups and sandwiches.
Hot sandwiches (about $5), such
as cheese, turkey, tofu (sur
prise!) and fish, are open face.
Cold sandwiches (about $4) are
served on whole wheat bread
with a garnish of tabbouli.

But back to our meal...
Each of the eight varieties of
omelettes are prepared with
three large eggs and served with
a scone and choice of tamaried
potatoes or fruit wedges. The
scones, whole grain buttermilk
biscuits, are piping hot and de
licious. We could live on scone
alone, but since pancakes and
other breakfast favorites were
sitting tantalizingly on nearby
tables, we decided not to jump
too hastily into sconetarianism.

So in addition to our
omelettes, we decided to take
advantage of the a la carte op
tion, ideal for those (me!) who
have to sample a little of ev
erything. Faced with salads,
scones, potatoes and more, we
finally chose a side order of two
whole grain pancakes ($2.50)
and tabbouli ($1.95). The steam
ing pancakes, although a bit
small for the price, were cooked
to perfection and delicious. The
tabbouli, a crunchy mixture of
marinated bulgar wheat,
chopped fresh vegetables,

raisins, and sunflower seeds, was
garnished with a tangy curry
sauce. For those fond of trying
new flavors and textures, this is a
must.
Beverages, particularly the
cinnamon spice tea ($.50), are a
treat here. And purists take
note: the orange juice is freshly
squeezed (a floating seed pro
vided the proof). Other
beverages include coffee, water,
fruit juices, beer, wine and
champagne.

After thoroughly enjoying our
meal, we were not surprised to
discover that owner Bob Cool,
who opened the restaurant with
his wife five years ago, was one
of the original cooks at the Good
Earth.
The two area restaurants both
offer natural foods — and cin
namon spice tea — but the simi
larities end there. Compared to
Late for the Train, the Good
Earth resembles a health food
Howard Johnson's. Late for the
Train is able to offer all the small
touches which the chain cannot.

Flower arrangements, china
bowls filled with raw sugar, and
linen table cloths sit on each
table.
Another difference between
the two restaurants centers
around service. Waiters and
waitresses at the Good Earth are
trained. At Late for the Train, we
refilled our own tea cups twice.
The spacious one-room res
taurant comfortably seats 58. In
addition, the Cools recently
added outside seating for 24.

This should help accommodate
the crowds which sometimes
gather at the popular restaurant.
The brunchery is open 7 a.m.
to 3 p.m. Tuesday through Fri
day, and 8:30 a.m. to 2:30 p.m.
weekends. It is closed Mondays,
so don't be late for your train!
Anything on the menu can
also be prepared to go.
In all, Late for the Train's
strength — as it should be — is its
food.You'll leave feeling full and
relaxed — but with a thinner
wallet.

to perfection and delicious. The
tabbouli, a crunchy mixture of
marinated bulgar wheat,
chopped fresh vegetables,

raisins, and sunflower seeds, was
garnished with a tangy curry
sauce. For those fond of trying
new flavors and textures, this is a
must.
Beverages, particularly the
cinnamon spice tea ($.50), are a
treat here. And purists take
note: the orange juice is freshly
squeezed (a floating seed pro
vided the proof). Other
beverages include coffee, water,
fruit juices, beer, wine and
champagne.

After thoroughly enjoying our
meal, we were not surprised to
discover that owner Bob Cool,
who opened the restaurant with
his wife five years ago, was one
of the original cooks at the Good
Earth.
The two area restaurants both
offer natural foods — and cin
namon spice tea — but the simi
larities end there. Compared to
Late for the Train, the Good
Earth resembles a health food
Howard Johnson's. Late for the
Train is able to offer all the small
touches which the chain cannot.

Flower arrangements, china
bowls filled with raw sugar, and
linen table cloths sit on each
table.
Another difference between
the two restaurants centers
around service. Waiters and
waitresses at the Good Earth are
trained. At Late for the Train, we
refilled our own tea cups twice.
The spacious one-room res
taurant comfortably seats 58. In
addition, the Cools recently
added outside seating for 24.

This should help accommodate
the crowds which sometimes
gather at the popular restaurant.
The brunchery is open 7 a.m.
to 3 p.m. Tuesday through Fri
day, and 8:30 a.m. to 2:30 p.m.
weekends. It is closed Mondays,
so don't be late for your train!
Anything on the menu can
also be prepared to go.
In all, Late for the Train's
strength — as it should be — is its
food.You'll leave feeling full and
relaxed — but with a thinner
wallet.
