Through the fog we drove,
up and up Woodside
Road, then up and up Sky
line Boulevard. Outside it got
colder and colder. Night crept
in. And then it began to rain. The
heights of Woodside on this July
evening conjured up Mark
Twain's old adage: "The coldest
winter I ever spent was a summer
in San Francisco."
The restaurant seemed to be
an island envelopped by the mist
outside. To make things better (
not worse), all the electricity was
out and our dining room was
dimly lit by lanternlight. We
were removed from the activity
of the Bay Area, and it wasn't un
til nearly three hours later, head
ing back down Skyline, that the
mist broke and we saw city lights.
If it seems strange to begin a
review with a summary of the
weather, it's only because the
environs of the Bella Vista Con
tinental Restaurant constitute its
main attraction. It is, simply put,
a good restaurant in an excellent
location. One dines there for
special celebrations —
birthdays, anniversaries, in
timate flights from all sorts of
plagues related to Palo Alto liv
ing — and the experience must

be anticipated in its totality, be
ginning with the trek up there.
One can find food at least as
good, more cheaply, much
closer to Stanford, but that fact
will likely do little to dissuade
most people from going to the
Bella Vista, because one goes

there for much more than food.
For such pleasures — a beautiful
drive, an intimate setting and a
few hours away in the forest —
one does pay dearly. A dinner
for two with wine (but not in
cluding cocktails) will be at least
$50, and can of course run much
higher.
But we must talk about the
food ... The Soupe du Jour
opener, Cream of Carrot, turned
out to be the highlight of the
meal. It was light, with an almost
buttery taste, and was finely sea
soned. The Onion Gratinee, on
the other hand, was fair but
neither the seasonings nor the
cheese helped it to stand out
from a gratinee available at any
other comparable restaurant.
Our choice of soup opted us
out of the Salade Maison, a tradi-

tional French salad of lettuce
leaves with a tomato slice or two,
and we passed right on to the en
tree. One of the specials, a
Salmon en Crute ($16.95), actual
ly proved a bit disappointing.
The pastry shell was slightly

heavy, leaving us with the con
clusion that salmon in its most
primal form — broiled and less
any of the fancy frills — still re
igned supreme.
The Veal Piccata ($14.95) was
more satisfying — artfully
cooked with just the right
amount of seasoning, bread and
lemon. And, of course, our forks
didn't even scratch any of the
other entrees — including
Agneau (lamb), Volaille
(poultry) and Boeuf (beef).
The size of the wine list is im
pressive, but of the hundreds of
selections available, our first two
choices (one Californian and
one French) were unavailable, a
fact which our waiter tried to
shrug off with the explanation
that most restaurants are always
at the whim of suppliers for their

wine. We finally settled on a 1975
J. Lohr from Monterey County, a
light white win, which was satis
fying. Speaking of the waiter,
our service was acceptably slow
(one should never be in a hurry
to leave a place like the Bella Vis

ta), but distinctly disinterested.
Just after the two of us were
seated, a party of 10 came in, and
quickly seemed much of higher
concern to our server. We
weren't too bothered to be
treated as something of an after
thought, but others might be.
Dessert consisted of an ex
cellent Creme Caramel ($1.75),
in league with the finest of
caramels or flans, and a fair, bit
tersweet Mousse au Chocolat
($2.25). We lingered for a good
time over coffee, and shared in
the general good-natured disap
pointment when the electricity
was restored. The mist outside
did not let up, and so our heady
sense of insulation was retained.
A distinctly different pleasure
can be had on a clear night,
when the lights of the South Bay
twinkle down below.
As a meal, ours was just good;
one would expect more of a res
taurant of this stature. As an out
ing, however, our evening was
first-rate, and therein still lies the
appeal of this restaurant over its
counterparts down at Bay level.
When one dines at the Bella Vis
ta, one pays for a small vacation
of sorts, and everyone knows
that vacations are rarely inex
pensive. On that basis one
should decide whether a night
here is worth its formidable cost.
