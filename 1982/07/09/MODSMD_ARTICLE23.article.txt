Brezhnev leadership questioned
Washington — Diplomatic messages from the Kremlin
to President Ronald Reagan during the continuing Leba
nese crisis indicate that the Soviet government "is now
being run by committee" rather than by President
Leonid Brezhnev, a ranking White House official said
yesterday.
That judgment, by and large shared by State Depart
ment officials relying on other evidence besides the
cables regarding Lebanon, has led to an informal debate
within the administration about how U.S. policy should
respond to the situation in the Kremlin.
Both White House and State Department officials pre
dicted that there would be "stability and continuity" in
Soviet foreign policy during the transition of power from
Brezhnev, now 75 years old and increasingly enfeebled,
to a new titular leader.
As a result, however, the United States may be
tempted to tailor its policies to take advantage of the sit
uation in the belief that committee rule is slow, cum
bersome and seldom forceful.
So far two reactions appear to dominate U.S. thinking
on the issue:
One is relief that the Soviet Union is unlikely to be in
an "adventurous mode" for some time, as a State De
partment official said. Although the United States cannot
use the opportunity to change policies that affect the So
viets directly or indirectly, it can be less worried about
possible Soviet reactions to U.S. policies already being
pursued, he added.
The other view is that "this is not the time to negotiate
seriously with Moscow," another State Department of
ficial said. A Kremlin run by consensus will not be able to
make significant new concessions, as would be necessary
for a new strategic arms agreement, "so it's silly to put
our real cards on the table," he said.
Reagan blocks rail strike
Washington — President Ronald Reagan yesterday
signed an order blocking a nationwide rail strike that had
been planned for Sunday night by the union represent
ing 35,000 locomotive engineers and firemen.
The executive order forestalls a strike for a 60-day
"cooling-off period" and establishes an emergency
board to investigate the dispute between the Broth
erhood of Locomotive Engineers and most of the na
tion's major rail lines.
Influenced by the potential impact on shipment of
winter wheat, national defense material and coal as well
as unemployment and intercity passenger travel, Reagan
acted within hours of receiving word from a labor medi
ation board that the situation was "extremely critical,"
deputy White House press secretary Larry Speakes said in
Santa Barbara.
The president "considers the railroad industry crucial
to the U.S. economy," Speakes said, adding that the
strike would have involved 90 percent of rail track
mileage in the United States.
About 25 percent of Defense Department materials
traveled by rail in the first six months of this year, Speakes
said.
A strike "would have a significant impact on un
employment," adding an additional 620,000 people to al
ready swollen rolls by the end of the second week of
such a strike, he said. Of these, 300,000 would come from
the railroad industry and the remainder in related in-

dustries, he said.
Bogus cocaine lethal, warns FDA
Washington — The FDA yesterday warned users of co
caine substitutes that the look-alikes could be as lethal as
the real thing.
The warning was issued after the agency received re
ports that three persons had died from sniffing or inject
ing substitute white powders.
The substitutes are sold by mail or in "head shops" un
der such names as Toot, Florida Snow, Supercaine, Ultra
caine, Base-o-caine, and Superiorcaine.
'The diversion and misuse of these cocainesubstitutes
is a newly emerging public-health problem with deadly
consequences. We are asking all manufacturers and dis
tributors to help stop this diversion of these relatives of
cocaine," FDA Commissioner Arthur Hull Hayes said.
The cocaine substitutes can collapse blood vessels,
cause low-blood pressure and depress heart muscle
strength, the FDA said. The substitutes contain local
anesthetics like lidocaine, procaine, and tetracaine.
The FDA has notified manufacturers of those
anesthetics "to initiate stringent controls over the dis
tribution of the bulk anesthetics to assure that they are
offered for sale only to legally authorized firms," the
FDA said in a statement.
Soviets replace Syrian weapons
Washington — The Soviet Union has started an ap
parently major replacement of Syrian weapons and
equipment destroyed or captured by the Israelis in bat
tles in Lebanon, U.S. intelligence sources said yesterday.
These sources, who asked to remain anonymous, said
six Soviet merchant ships have unloaded tanks, surface
to-air missiles and other military cargo in Syrian ports
over the past two weeks.
This level of Soviet arms deliveries to Syria was de
scribed as being higher than in any previous full month
this year.
Between the beginning of 1982 and the Israeli invasion
of Lebanon in early June, the sources said, the Soviets
had delivered about 20,000 tons of military hardware and
ammunition to Syria.
Israeli Maj. Gen. Aharon Yariv told reporters here re
cently that Israeli forces destroyed 350 tanks and 18 sur
face-to-air missile batteries in battles with the Syrians.
The Israelis also claim to have inflicted heavy losses on
the Syrian air force.
Syria long has relied on the Soviet Union for most of its
weapons and other military gear. The Soviets re
equipped Syrian ground and air forces after they suf
fered huge losses to the Israelis in the 1967 and 1973
Arab-Israeli wars.
The latest Israeli defeats of Syrian ground and air units
in Lebanon have raised questions about how Soviet arms
stack up against American equipment. Much of Israel's
arms were supplied by the United States.
However, senior American generals have cautioned
against jumping to any conclusions which they say could
be simplistic.
Navy training planes collide
Corpus Christi, Texas — Two Navy training planes col
lided in flight yesterday, killing all six people aboard, a
Naval Air Station spokesman said.
The two T-44 turboprops crashed about 12:15 p.m.,

said Ensign Jeff Herman, the spokesman.
Two students and one instructor were aboard each
plane, Herman said.
The collision was two miles south of Cabanis Field, an
auxiliary landing field south of the air station, he said.
The T-44 is a small, propeller-driven plane the Navy
uses to train advanced students.
The cause of the crash was under investigation.
The names of the six victims were withheld pending
notification of kin.
Soviets charged with forgery
Washington — The Soviet Union is trying to stir up
trouble for American diplomats with forged letters and
documents purported to be written by President Ronald
Reagan and other top U.S. officials, the Reagan adminis
tration charged yesterday.
Among examples of forgeries given to reporters was a
letter supposedly sent by Reagan to King Juan Carlos of
Spain on Oct. 23,1981 in which the president allegedly
said it was urgent that Spain join NATO and proposed
ways for the king to counter domestic Spanish opposi
tion.
The State Department official said no such letter was
ever sent by Reagan and the forgery obviously was "de
signed to stir up trouble."
Such forged letters are distributed anonymously to
journalists and foreign officials in hopes that someone
will believe them and publicize them, said the official,
who insisted on not being identified by name.
Administration okays laser export
Washington — The Reagan administration has secretly
approved the export to West Germany and France of
special lasers for research that could make it simpler and
far cheaper to produce highly enriched uranium and su
per-grade plutonium suitable for nuclear bombs.
The so-called tunable diode lasers, produced by Laser
Analytics Inc., were sold to the French and West German
governments for research in laser isotope separation, a
sophisticated process that is also the object of an in
tensive development program at the Energy Depart
ment's Lawrence Livermore and Los Alamos National
Laboratories.
The decision to permit export of the lasers for such re
search, which had to be approved by Energy Secretary
James Edwards under terms of the Atomic Energy Act,
was classified by the Energy Department on grounds that
to disclose it might compromise the competitive posi
tion of the American manufacturer.

Brezhnev leadership questioned
Washington — Diplomatic messages from the Kremlin
to President Ronald Reagan during the continuing Leba
nese crisis indicate that the Soviet government "is now
being run by committee" rather than by President
Leonid Brezhnev, a ranking White House official said
yesterday.
That judgment, by and large shared by State Depart
ment officials relying on other evidence besides the
cables regarding Lebanon, has led to an informal debate
within the administration about how U.S. policy should
respond to the situation in the Kremlin.
Both White House and State Department officials pre
dicted that there would be "stability and continuity" in
Soviet foreign policy during the transition of power from
Brezhnev, now 75 years old and increasingly enfeebled,
to a new titular leader.
As a result, however, the United States may be
tempted to tailor its policies to take advantage of the sit
uation in the belief that committee rule is slow, cum
bersome and seldom forceful.
So far two reactions appear to dominate U.S. thinking
on the issue:
One is relief that the Soviet Union is unlikely to be in
an "adventurous mode" for some time, as a State De
partment official said. Although the United States cannot
use the opportunity to change policies that affect the So
viets directly or indirectly, it can be less worried about
possible Soviet reactions to U.S. policies already being
pursued, he added.
The other view is that "this is not the time to negotiate
seriously with Moscow," another State Department of
ficial said. A Kremlin run by consensus will not be able to
make significant new concessions, as would be necessary
for a new strategic arms agreement, "so it's silly to put
our real cards on the table," he said.
Reagan blocks rail strike
Washington — President Ronald Reagan yesterday
signed an order blocking a nationwide rail strike that had
been planned for Sunday night by the union represent
ing 35,000 locomotive engineers and firemen.
The executive order forestalls a strike for a 60-day
"cooling-off period" and establishes an emergency
board to investigate the dispute between the Broth
erhood of Locomotive Engineers and most of the na
tion's major rail lines.
Influenced by the potential impact on shipment of
winter wheat, national defense material and coal as well
as unemployment and intercity passenger travel, Reagan
acted within hours of receiving word from a labor medi
ation board that the situation was "extremely critical,"
deputy White House press secretary Larry Speakes said in
Santa Barbara.
The president "considers the railroad industry crucial
to the U.S. economy," Speakes said, adding that the
strike would have involved 90 percent of rail track
mileage in the United States.
About 25 percent of Defense Department materials
traveled by rail in the first six months of this year, Speakes
said.
A strike "would have a significant impact on un
employment," adding an additional 620,000 people to al
ready swollen rolls by the end of the second week of
such a strike, he said. Of these, 300,000 would come from
the railroad industry and the remainder in related in-

ftom the wire* of the Associated PrcH and the Lot Angeles Times/Washington Post News Service

dustries, he said.
Bogus cocaine lethal, warns FDA
Washington — The FDA yesterday warned users of co
caine substitutes that the look-alikes could be as lethal as
the real thing.
The warning was issued after the agency received re
ports that three persons had died from sniffing or inject
ing substitute white powders.
The substitutes are sold by mail or in "head shops" un
der such names as Toot, Florida Snow, Supercaine, Ultra
caine, Base-o-caine, and Superiorcaine.
'The diversion and misuse of these cocainesubstitutes
is a newly emerging public-health problem with deadly
consequences. We are asking all manufacturers and dis
tributors to help stop this diversion of these relatives of
cocaine," FDA Commissioner Arthur Hull Hayes said.
The cocaine substitutes can collapse blood vessels,
cause low-blood pressure and depress heart muscle
strength, the FDA said. The substitutes contain local
anesthetics like lidocaine, procaine, and tetracaine.
The FDA has notified manufacturers of those
anesthetics "to initiate stringent controls over the dis
tribution of the bulk anesthetics to assure that they are
offered for sale only to legally authorized firms," the
FDA said in a statement.
Soviets replace Syrian weapons
Washington — The Soviet Union has started an ap
parently major replacement of Syrian weapons and
equipment destroyed or captured by the Israelis in bat
tles in Lebanon, U.S. intelligence sources said yesterday.
These sources, who asked to remain anonymous, said
six Soviet merchant ships have unloaded tanks, surface
to-air missiles and other military cargo in Syrian ports
over the past two weeks.
This level of Soviet arms deliveries to Syria was de
scribed as being higher than in any previous full month
this year.
Between the beginning of 1982 and the Israeli invasion
of Lebanon in early June, the sources said, the Soviets
had delivered about 20,000 tons of military hardware and
ammunition to Syria.
Israeli Maj. Gen. Aharon Yariv told reporters here re
cently that Israeli forces destroyed 350 tanks and 18 sur
face-to-air missile batteries in battles with the Syrians.
The Israelis also claim to have inflicted heavy losses on
the Syrian air force.
Syria long has relied on the Soviet Union for most of its
weapons and other military gear. The Soviets re
equipped Syrian ground and air forces after they suf
fered huge losses to the Israelis in the 1967 and 1973
Arab-Israeli wars.
The latest Israeli defeats of Syrian ground and air units
in Lebanon have raised questions about how Soviet arms
stack up against American equipment. Much of Israel's
arms were supplied by the United States.
However, senior American generals have cautioned
against jumping to any conclusions which they say could
be simplistic.
Navy training planes collide
Corpus Christi, Texas — Two Navy training planes col
lided in flight yesterday, killing all six people aboard, a
Naval Air Station spokesman said.
The two T-44 turboprops crashed about 12:15 p.m.,

said Ensign Jeff Herman, the spokesman.
Two students and one instructor were aboard each
plane, Herman said.
The collision was two miles south of Cabanis Field, an
auxiliary landing field south of the air station, he said.
The T-44 is a small, propeller-driven plane the Navy
uses to train advanced students.
The cause of the crash was under investigation.
The names of the six victims were withheld pending
notification of kin.
Soviets charged with forgery
Washington — The Soviet Union is trying to stir up
trouble for American diplomats with forged letters and
documents purported to be written by President Ronald
Reagan and other top U.S. officials, the Reagan adminis
tration charged yesterday.
Among examples of forgeries given to reporters was a
letter supposedly sent by Reagan to King Juan Carlos of
Spain on Oct. 23,1981 in which the president allegedly
said it was urgent that Spain join NATO and proposed
ways for the king to counter domestic Spanish opposi
tion.
The State Department official said no such letter was
ever sent by Reagan and the forgery obviously was "de
signed to stir up trouble."
Such forged letters are distributed anonymously to
journalists and foreign officials in hopes that someone
will believe them and publicize them, said the official,
who insisted on not being identified by name.
Administration okays laser export
Washington — The Reagan administration has secretly
approved the export to West Germany and France of
special lasers for research that could make it simpler and
far cheaper to produce highly enriched uranium and su
per-grade plutonium suitable for nuclear bombs.
The so-called tunable diode lasers, produced by Laser
Analytics Inc., were sold to the French and West German
governments for research in laser isotope separation, a
sophisticated process that is also the object of an in
tensive development program at the Energy Depart
ment's Lawrence Livermore and Los Alamos National
Laboratories.
The decision to permit export of the lasers for such re
search, which had to be approved by Energy Secretary
James Edwards under terms of the Atomic Energy Act,
was classified by the Energy Department on grounds that
to disclose it might compromise the competitive posi
tion of the American manufacturer.
