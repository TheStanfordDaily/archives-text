# Pub planned for Encina Station
## 
### Sid Carter 
Encina Station will operate as a student-run pub
at night beginning this fall, according to Nanci
Howe, assistant director of Tresidder Union.
The change is designed to provide students with
entrepreneurial opportunities, Howe said. Stu
dent managers will run Encina Station during the
extended evening hours which will begin fall quar
ter.
Three student managers were selected this sum
mer, and will be trained by personnel of Servoma
tion Corporation. (Servomation is contracted by
Tresidder Union to run Encina Station during the
day.) The student managers will arrive in early Sep
tember to offer suggestions for physical changes in
the facility, oversee the changes, and prepare En
cina Station for the new school year. According to
Howe, the student managers will be responsible
for staffing, marketing, inventory control, pro
gramming, and maintaining financial statements.
They will be responsible for the evening hours
only; Servomation will continue to run daytime
operations.
Howe said Encina Station, located in the back of

Encina Hall, has traditionally served primarily as an
eating facility for faculty and staff, open 7 a.m. to
2:30 p.m. five days a week. Outside of isolated eve
ning events for students, Encina generally re
mained closed during the evenings.
With the input of the student managers, Tres
idder plans to run Encina as a pub-like operation
five to seven nights a week, said Howe.
Tresidder advertised for students interested in
managing the Encina pub. According to Howe, her
predecessor Greg Larson decided to turn the Cor
ner Pocket, located in Tresidder, over to student
management after being approached by several
students interested in running a frozen yogurt op
eration in Union Crossroads. Since the Corner
Pocket began selling frozen yogurt two months
ago, its business has increased.
Howe emphasized that the primary goal of the
project is not to generate profits. Rather, it is de
signed to provide entrepreneurial learning ex
periences for students and to increase student in
volvement with the management and services of
Tresidder Union.
