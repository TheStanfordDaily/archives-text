# Tenure decision delayed
## 
### Ray Newman 
The Deans of Humanities and
Sciences (H & S) have arrived at a
procedure that will be used to
review the decision not to grant
tenure to Asst. History Prof.
Estelle Freedman. The new pro
cedure will require at least a
month before a final decision re
garding Freedman's tenure is
reached.
Dean of H & S Norman
Wessells, when asked if a final
decision would be made within a
month, replied, "I seriously
doubt it." Wessells and As
sociate Deans James Rosse and
William Chace are reviewing
their earlier decision not to grant
tenure to Freedman.
Chace said'/Wedid make a de
cision about the procedure we
would employ."
Letters are being prepared in
structing the History department
on the procedure that would be
used in arriving at the tenure de
cision, Wessells said.
The timing of the decision
now "depends on how fast His
tory acts on it," Wessells said. "I
think they'll take longer than

one month," he added.
After the History Department
acts, the Committee on Ap
pointments and Promotions
(CAP) will review the case,
Wessells said. The CAP advises
the deans on the tenure de
cision.
History Prof. Carl Degler, who
is chairing a History department
committee dealing with Freed
man's case, said last Tuesday that
"it's not going to be resolved for
some time."
A decision would probably

not be made for "weeks at
least," Freedman said. "There
are procedural delays and it's
going to be some time," she said.
Freedman said that the pro
cedure did not directly involve
herself now. "It's really between
the dean and the department,"
she said.
Degler confirmed yesterday
that it is now the History Depart
ment's turn to act.
Freedman said that she has re
ceived a grant for next year to do
research.
