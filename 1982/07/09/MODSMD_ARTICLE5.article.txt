# ASSU investment options proposed

The ASSU is looking into in
vesting in a $15,000 to $25,000
computer banking service sys
tem and a $30,000 auxiliary unit
for a boathouse pizzeria, accord
ing to Student Financial Man
ager Bob Brody. He said the
projects would be financed
"from capital reserves."
The Senate must approve the
project proposals, which will be
presented at the first ASSU sum
mer meeting this Tuesday. Sum
mer Deputy Chair James
McGrath, a graduate student in
computer science, said, "We
don't think the Senate will have
any real problems with it.
"These projects (the
boathouse and the computer
system) in particular are aimed at
getting money to pay back our
capital costs," he said. Unlike the
ASSU's service and advocacy
(task force) goals, the aim of
business operations is to gener
ate revenue. "Most of the
ASSU's operating revenue
comes out of projects," he said.
If the Senate approves the
boathouse proposal, the
pizzeria may be open as early as
October, said Brody.
McGrath said the ASSU would
set up an independent corpo
ration along the lines of the Cof

fee House. The take-out pizza
operation would be totally stu
dent run, he added. The pro
posed pizzeria would have no
seating, but would offer a de
livery service. "There's no real
room out there to do anything,"
said McGrath.
The auxiliary unit would be
constructed solely by students.
"We have our own labor supp
ly," said McGrath. He added that
outside workers may be used for
utility work.
According to Brody, the com
puter system would help the
ASSU's banking service. It would
monitor student group expen
ditures and payroll better and
faster.
McGrath stressed the "hard
cash savings" the computer sys
tem would provide. For exam
ple, the ASSU would be able to
lease the computer to the Coffee
House for its monthly account
ing. If the Coffee House leased
the service for $400 per month,
the ASSU would get a return on
its investment in two years, he
said.
In addition to providing
"tighter control over program
budgets," the computer could
be used for word-processing
and correspondence, said
McGrath.
