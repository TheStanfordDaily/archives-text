## Ramos: America deceived by events in El Salvador 
### Jane West 
"If the American people don't
exert the power they have, the
lack of understanding of the sit
uation in El Salvador will lead to a
Central American war/' said
Arnoldo Ramos, a diplomatic
representative from FDR-FMLN,
the coalition opposed to the
present regime in El Salvador,
last Wednesday night.
Ramos spoke at the First Con
gregational Church in Palo Alto
before a crowd of approximately
60 people as part of an "El
Salvador Update," sponsored by
local Central American or
ganizations. The program also
featured American journalist
Richard Boyle, co-producer of a
documentary on the March
elections in El Salvador.
Ramos, a Berkeley graduate
and Stanford Ph.D candidate in
Spanish and Portuguese lan
guages, turned to "solidarity
work" in 1978 and now sees his
role as a "translator of the revo
lution to all sectors of the United
States, but above all to the peo
ple." Based in Washington and
New York, he travels around the
United States talking to solidarity
groups and doing press con
ferences.
"A big problem in America is
the communiction and educa
tion of this integral and internal
problem," Ramos told the Daily.
"This type of war involves the
direct participation of the Amer
ican people as opposed to the
will of the U.S. government,
whose every move has resulted
in the intensification and

polarization of our society."
Ramos said there is presently lit
tle dialogue with the U.S. gov
ernment, although he would sit
down with them if they wanted.
"El Salvador is only staying
alive because of U.S. military
presence," he said, alluding to
the financial aid, military ad
visors and hardware that have
been sent to the country. "The
U.S. advisors didn't go down to
fix helicopters. They are in
timately and directly involved in
the fighting."
Yet, "there is a smokescreen
over Congress; the new regime
in El Salvador is unstable and
does not have the support that it
claims. It won't carry out the ec
onomic and social tran
formation" that Congress is an
ticipating.
According to an unidentified
delegate, an eight-member con
gressional delegation in El
Salvador shortly after the March
elections to monitor nego
tiations warned the victorious
leaders of the rightist Nationalist
Republicans and National Con
ciliation Party that the Christian
Democrats must occupy key
positions in the new govern
ment. The delegate said the new
ly elected leaders were told the
government must continue,
itself, the economic and social
changes begun by the Christian
Democrats over the last two
years.
Ramos claimed that having the
Christian Democrats occupy the
ministerial positions of educa
tion, labor, and foreign relations

presents a facade of democracy
while the most important posts
— agriculture, trade and econo
my — are in the hands of the Na
tional Republicans, led by presi
dent of the Constituent As
sembly and extreme rightist
Robert D'Aubuisson. "It is quite
ironic for never in history has a
group acted against its own in
terests ... It will dawn on Con -
gress and the American people
that the provisional govern
ment has destroyed the tradi
tional foundations of legal re
form."
On May 26, the Senate Foreign
Relations Committee cut the
1983 allocation of military aid to
El Salvador from a proposed
$166.3 million to $66 million in
response to perceived alter
ations and delays in the land dis
tribution programs of the Con
stituent Assembly. The proposal
will be discussed next month in
Congress.
Ramos referred to this move as
one of "the two events that have
begun to break the veil." The
second is the period of military
victories for the guerrilla forces
in the Morazan province. "Con
trary to what was announced af
ter the elections, we are winning
the battle," he said.
Ramos claimed high govern
ment troop casualties during re
cent months, even in the Atlacatl
Battalion which was trained by
U.S. advisers in El Salvador. Re
ferring to Salvadoran Vice-Min
ister of Defense Colonel Castillo,
he said, "We have the second in
command in our hands."

Concerning the reports of
Honduran soldiers fighting in El
Salvador, Ramos explained that
the Honduran military has total
jurisdiction over all borders: "In
the Morazan and Chalatenango
provinces, 2000 troops have
been lining the side of the
border in order to block the es
cape of Salvadoran refugees...
There are at least 60 U.S. advisers
and 150 U.S. civilian personnel in
key military areas. Honduras has
become the jumping board, the
Thailand of Cental America."
Ramos discounted the recent
elections in which Alvaro
Magana of the National Con
ciliation Party became the pro
visional president, saying, "Any
election held in a war-torn coun
try is at best an optical illusion."
Ramos cited the results of a study
made public in early June by a
research center at the pre
dominantly Jesuit-administered
Jose Simeon Canas University of
Central America which show
that the vote total was inflated.
The Center for Documentation
and Information argued that not
more than 1.3 million people
could have voted on March 28
given the time it took to vote, the
number of polling places and
the "effective" number of hours
the polls were open (New York
Times, June 13).
"In San Salvador, the number
of polling places, normally 46,
was cut down to 14. People had
to wait around for hou. s; it took
at least three minutes to get each
identification card checked,"
said Ramos.
American journalist Richard
Boyle, speaking later in the eve
ning, said the atmosphere of ter
ror was especially fierce during
the elections. "The people were
climbing the walls to get into
vote, not because they wanted
to, but because they had to. If
you didn't vote, you could be
considered a guerrilla, fined or
imprisoned."
Boyle, who has covered the
events in El Salvador on and off
since 1974 and for a time was
Rep. Pete McCloskey's (R-Calif.)
adviser on military and foreign
affairs, related his personal ex
periences as a war correspon
dent and filmmaker. "The terror
affects everyone. People tend to
avoid talking politics for they

know their life will be shorter,"
said Boyle, who was injured and
had his car vandalized in front of
his house by the police. After
these "warnings," he said, he
tried to renew his visa and was
essentially kicked out of the
country.
Boyle visited a rebel village of
200 people, in which half were in
the militia, a half-dozen were
full-time soldiers, and the rest
worked in the village, did night
patrol and trained; one-third
were women volunteers. He
said, "Their morale was good but
the guerrillas were grossly un
derequipped. They had two
Belguim salt rifles, shotguns, a
Winchester; it looked like the
Wild West."
Ramos explained the diversity
of the fighting groups and in
dicated that coordination be
tween the rural and urban areas
has been difficult. "A post-elec
tion analysis showed that sup
port is weak in the cities where
the National Republicans have
been consolidating support
among the urban rich," he said.
Mentioning the worsening of
the economic crises in the coun
try, the lack of political opposi
tion, the tough conditions under
which the guerrillas are fighting
and the instability of the region,
Ramos said, "I want to reiterate
the fact that we are still for
peace. I believe there is a politi
cal solution to the conflict. We
have not closed all doors to ne
gotiations. But, they (the present
regime) do not want to nego
tiate; they want our physical de
struction."
"The peace and social justice
can come," he concluded, "if
the most powerful people — the
U.S. people — can act: by de
manding truthful information,
by educating themselves and
others (about the sitution in El
Salvador) and by demanding
that policies be changed. We
would be the first to sit down so
long as the United States re
spects our own interests and
right to self-determination."
The "El Salvador Update" was
sponsored by the Committee
Against U.S. Intervention in
Central America, the Stanford
Central America Action
Network, and the Labor Com
mittee on El Salvador.
