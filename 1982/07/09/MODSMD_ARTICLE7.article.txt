# Alliance calls for mutual cut in ground forces
## 
### Washington Post 
Vienna, Austria— The Atlan
tic Alliance yesterday put for
ward a draft treaty calling for
cuts in Eastern and Western
ground forces in Central Eu
rope to a ceiling of 700,000 for
each side. The reductions
would come in four stages
within a seven-year period.
The proposal, initially out
lined by President Ronald Rea
gan last month during his Eu
ropean visit, represents an at
tempt to put some vigor into
stalled talks on reducing
Eastern and Western conven
tional forces in Central Europe.
It is one of a series of new arms
control initiatives launched by
the administration in the face
of strong American and Eu
ropean grass-roots campaigns
for disarmament.
Western officials, explaining
the plan after its formal presen
tation here to Communist rep
resentatives, said it builds on
past Atlantic Alliance proposals
but includes a significant con
cession to the East.
Its most important feature is
that the proposed treaty would
spell out from the start the re
ductions that would be re
quired of members of both
blocs to reach a common ceil
ing on ground forces. A 1979
Western proposal that speci
fied only U.S. and Soviet reduc
tions as the first part of a more
vague two-part plan for cutting
Eastern and Western forces was
rejected by the East as lacking
guarantees for troop cuts by
other Western countries.

Western officials said the fact
that the plan was presented in
draft treaty form — the first
time that the West has offered
such a formal draft in these ne
gotiations — should be taken
as a sign, of the seriousness of
the proposal.
"I would like to emphasize,"
U.S. delegation spokesman
Harlan Moen told reporters,
"that the West in tabling this
new initiative in the form of a

Western officials said the fact the plan was
presented in draft treaty form... should
be taken as a sign of the seriousness of the
proposal.

draft treaty underscores
Western seriousness of
purpose to provide new im
petus to and further progress in
these negotiations, and
Western willingness to bring
about militarily significant re
ductions in Central Europe."
The Eastern side, while
agreeing to study the plan,
showed little enthusiasm for it.
Valerian Mikhailov, the Soviet
ambassador to the talks, was
quoted by a spokesman as
saying the draft did not appear
to represent "any movement
forward" on one of the key ob
stacles of the negotiations,
namely agreement on the ac
tual size of Warsaw Pact forces
in Central Europe.
Western military officials
have put the pact total at
962,000 troops while the East

asserts it has only 805,000.
Without East-West consensus
on such data, an agreement on
future troop reductions re
mains elusive. There is little dis
agreement that Western
ground forces in Central Eu
rope number 790,000.
The East's figures are thought
by Western officials to be de
liberately understated in order
to avoid greater reductions if
agreement on a common ceil-

ing is eventually reached.
Mikhailov also criticized the
Western draft for taking the
talks backward in some re
spects, notably by focusing
only on troop cuts and leaving
out any offer for reductions in
conventional armaments in

Central Europe.
The Soviet ambassador ob
jected as well to Western un
willingness to consider reduc
tions in air force personnel.
The Western plan calls for a
ceiling on Eastern and Western
air forces at the existing
Western level of 200,000.
Now well into their ninth
year, the Mutual Balanced
Force Reduction (MBFR) talks
here involve a 12-nation Atlan
tic Alliance group and the sev
en-nation Warsaw Pact. Over
the years, both East and West
have offered a variety of pro
posals to try to break the dead
lock, but the negotiations have
tended to take a back seat to
U.S.-Soviet talks on limiting
strategic nuclear weapons.
Alliance officials acknowl
edged yesterday that their draft
plan issimilartoa 1975 Western
proposal. The difference now,
they said, is that the West is
being much more concrete by

offering to negotiate binding
commitments for each phase
of the proposed reductions.
The draft provides that in the
first stage, the United States
would withdraw 13,000 ground
forces from Central Europe
and the Soviets would pull
back 30,000. After this, reduc
tions by other Eastern and
Western nations would occur
in three equal stages down to
the 700,000 ground force ceil
ing for each side.
The Western draft treaty has
provisions for verification, in
cluding an annual quota of on
site inspections, from either
the air or the ground, U.S. of
ficials in Washington said. Per
manent exit and entry points
would be established to keep
track of troops replaced or re
duced on both sides. In addi
tion, each side would have the
right to send observers to any
military manuevers involving
more than one division of
troops.

Vienna, Austria— The Atlan
tic Alliance yesterday put for
ward a draft treaty calling for
cuts in Eastern and Western
ground forces in Central Eu
rope to a ceiling of 700,000 for
each side. The reductions
would come in four stages
within a seven-year period.
The proposal, initially out
lined by President Ronald Rea
gan last month during his Eu
ropean visit, represents an at
tempt to put some vigor into
stalled talks on reducing
Eastern and Western conven
tional forces in Central Europe.
It is one of a series of new arms
control initiatives launched by
the administration in the face
of strong American and Eu
ropean grass-roots campaigns
for disarmament.
Western officials, explaining
the plan after its formal presen
tation here to Communist rep
resentatives, said it builds on
past Atlantic Alliance proposals
but includes a significant con
cession to the East.
Its most important feature is
that the proposed treaty would
spell out from the start the re
ductions that would be re
quired of members of both
blocs to reach a common ceil
ing on ground forces. A 1979
Western proposal that speci
fied only U.S. and Soviet reduc
tions as the first part of a more
vague two-part plan for cutting
Eastern and Western forces was
rejected by the East as lacking
guarantees for troop cuts by
other Western countries.

Western officials said the fact
that the plan was presented in
draft treaty form — the first
time that the West has offered
such a formal draft in these ne
gotiations — should be taken
as a sign, of the seriousness of
the proposal.
"I would like to emphasize,"
U.S. delegation spokesman
Harlan Moen told reporters,
"that the West in tabling this
new initiative in the form of a

Western officials said the fact the plan was
presented in draft treaty form... should
be taken as a sign of the seriousness of the
proposal.

draft treaty underscores
Western seriousness of
purpose to provide new im
petus to and further progress in
these negotiations, and
Western willingness to bring
about militarily significant re
ductions in Central Europe."
The Eastern side, while
agreeing to study the plan,
showed little enthusiasm for it.
Valerian Mikhailov, the Soviet
ambassador to the talks, was
quoted by a spokesman as
saying the draft did not appear
to represent "any movement
forward" on one of the key ob
stacles of the negotiations,
namely agreement on the ac
tual size of Warsaw Pact forces
in Central Europe.
Western military officials
have put the pact total at
962,000 troops while the East

asserts it has only 805,000.
Without East-West consensus
on such data, an agreement on
future troop reductions re
mains elusive. There is little dis
agreement that Western
ground forces in Central Eu
rope number 790,000.
The East's figures are thought
by Western officials to be de
liberately understated in order
to avoid greater reductions if
agreement on a common ceil-

ing is eventually reached.
Mikhailov also criticized the
Western draft for taking the
talks backward in some re
spects, notably by focusing
only on troop cuts and leaving
out any offer for reductions in
conventional armaments in

Central Europe.
The Soviet ambassador ob
jected as well to Western un
willingness to consider reduc
tions in air force personnel.
The Western plan calls for a
ceiling on Eastern and Western
air forces at the existing
Western level of 200,000.
Now well into their ninth
year, the Mutual Balanced
Force Reduction (MBFR) talks
here involve a 12-nation Atlan
tic Alliance group and the sev
en-nation Warsaw Pact. Over
the years, both East and West
have offered a variety of pro
posals to try to break the dead
lock, but the negotiations have
tended to take a back seat to
U.S.-Soviet talks on limiting
strategic nuclear weapons.
Alliance officials acknowl
edged yesterday that their draft
plan issimilartoa 1975 Western
proposal. The difference now,
they said, is that the West is
being much more concrete by

offering to negotiate binding
commitments for each phase
of the proposed reductions.
The draft provides that in the
first stage, the United States
would withdraw 13,000 ground
forces from Central Europe
and the Soviets would pull
back 30,000. After this, reduc
tions by other Eastern and
Western nations would occur
in three equal stages down to
the 700,000 ground force ceil
ing for each side.
The Western draft treaty has
provisions for verification, in
cluding an annual quota of on
site inspections, from either
the air or the ground, U.S. of
ficials in Washington said. Per
manent exit and entry points
would be established to keep
track of troops replaced or re
duced on both sides. In addi
tion, each side would have the
right to send observers to any
military manuevers involving
more than one division of
troops.
