# Arafat claims hopes for peace
## 
### Los Angeles Times 
Jerusalem â€” In an interview
with a leftist Israeli journalist
politician published Wednes
day, Yasser Arafat said his
Palestine Liberation Organiza
tion is ready to make peace with
Israel on the basis of a five-year
old Soviet proposal which rec
ognizes the Jewish state's right to
recognized borders.
But Arafat shied away when

the interviewer, Uri Avneri, a
former member of the Israeli
Parliament, urged him to ad
vocate "mutual understanding,
respect, mutual recognition."
Avneri, head of the leftist Sheli
Party, interviewed Arafat Satur
day in Beirut. A transcript of the
tape-recorded interview was
published in Avneri's weekly
magazine Haolam Haze.
In many ways, the fact that the
meeting took place at all is more
interesting than what was said. In
a preface to the interview, Av
neri said he went to pre
dominantly Christian East Beirut,
where he telephoned a PLO rep
resentative in Paris, who gave
him Arafat's unlisted telephone
number in West Beirut. Avneri
said he then telephoned Arafat's

office and arranged for the in
terview.
The meeting, probably the
first ever between an Israeli po
litical figure and Arafat, touched
off a demand from members of
Prime Minister Menachem Be
gin's Likud bloc that Avneri be
prosecuted for treason.
Avneri's Sheli Party did not re
ceive enough votes in the last
election to qualify a single can
didate for the Knesset (Par
liament). In previous elections,
the party did win representation
and Avneri has held a Knesset
seat.
Avneri has been more suc
cessful in journalism. His breezy
magazine is a big seller on Israeli
newsstands.
