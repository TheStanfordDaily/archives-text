## Viewpoint/Glen and Shearer Non-registrants stand for clearer foreign policies 
### 
Chicago — Bernie Harkin
didn't feel the heat of summer
until last week. After V/i years
of posturing, the Reagan admin
istration began to prosecute
young men who have refused to
register with the Selective Ser
vice System.
But then again, Harkin has
been sweating out Ronald Rea
gan's foreign policy for some
time now.
"I remember watching news
clips of the Vietnam War as a
child," said the 21-year-old
Harkin, wiping his glasses on his
blue terrycloth shirt. "And I'm
worried that Reagan is going to
get us into another Vietnam
type situation in the Middle East
or Central America. I'm just not
clear where he's going, but I fear
the worst."
As with so many of the strong
willed, Harkin doesn't fit the
stereotype. The meek, 5-9 Chi
cago West-sider doesn't look
like a fair match for Uncle Sam.
Yet, in the best tradition of
American dissent, Harkin is ask :
ing his government some very
tough questions.
He's saying: "If I'm to register
for the military, gentlemen,
please explain what I'm regis
tering for. If the government has
a coherent foreign policy, why
can't someone explain it to me?"
It's worth noting that Harkin's
curiosity is widely shared. Most
of the 200 avowed non-regis
trants on the justice Depart
ment's WANTED list are out
spoken critics of Reagan's
brawn-over-brains diplomacy.
Not counting the half-million
other non-registrants, many
Americans are beginning to
question the wisdom of an ad
ministration which treats Europe
as if it were a group of colonies,
stands silent on the destruction
of Lebanon, and aids repressive
regimes in Latin America. Now,
even former Secretary of State
Alexander Haig may count
himself among those con
cerned.
The president, moreover, has
done little recently to allay this
growing consensus of con
fusion. Though he opened his
press conference last week with
a statement on the economy,
Reagan had to field three times
as many questions about foreign
affairs as he did about domestic
policy. In response to allegations
of "confusion," the president
haltingly replied: "I would re
spond by saying that I think we
have been pursuing a foreign
policy that is sound and that
we've had some great successes
in a number of areas with this."
Whether Reagan knows it or
not, his current foreign policy is
anything but steady. Rather, as
each week passes, the U.S. more
clearly resembles a runaway
train, careening toward an in
evitable collision with a number
of other nations' better interests.
Can derailment be far down the
track when, as the nation
learned last week from The CBS

Evening News, 10 American mili
tary advisers were fighting
alongside Salvadoran troops in
that tiny Latin country?
Some people at least realize
that Reagan, by prosecuting reg
istration resisters, is preparing
the country for a return to mili
tary conscription. As Rep.
Mickey Leland (D-Texas) told us
last week, "People haven't re
alized the impact of what it really
means to force young people to
register. When we start drafting
and sending men into war zones,
the stark reality of this decision
will descend upon everyone."
Government prosecutors, nat
urally, care little for world affairs.
At the White House's instruc
tion, they've begun to reel in a
handful of the 500,000 resisters,
one at a time, starting with Ben
Sasway, a 21-year-old Humboldt
State University student from
San Diego.
Sheer numbers aside, these
lawyers have their hands full.
The Selective Service was so
quick to issue its regulations last
year that it may have made mis
takes which could eventually
jeopardize the validity of regis
tration in court.
In the meantime, it's a dis
grace that Congress's leadership
role in foreign affairs has been
eclipsed by the actions of a
handful of frightened young
men. Leland hypothesizes that
the nuclear-freeze movement
has absolved many lawmakers
from speaking out on other, less
popular foreign policy issues.
Men such as Sasway and
Harkin, therefore, may be com
mitting acts of patriotism by risk
ing their liberty to compel other
Americans to join the debate on
U.S. foreign policy.
They would certainly stand
with Mark Twain when he
wrote: "My kind of loyalty was
loyalty to one's country, not to
its institutions or its of
ficeholders. The country is the
real thing ... to watch over."

have been pursuing a foreign
policy that is sound and that
we've had some great successes
in a number of areas with this."
Whether Reagan knows it or
not, his current foreign policy is
anything but steady. Rather, as
each week passes, the U.S. more
clearly resembles a runaway
train, careening toward an in
evitable collision with a number
of other nations' better interests.
Can derailment be far down the
track when, as the nation
learned last week from The CBS

Evening News, 10 American mili
tary advisers were fighting
alongside Salvadoran troops in
that tiny Latin country?
Some people at least realize
that Reagan, by prosecuting reg
istration resisters, is preparing
the country for a return to mili
tary conscription. As Rep.
Mickey Leland (D-Texas) told us
last week, "People haven't re
alized the impact of what it really
means to force young people to
register. When we start drafting
and sending men into war zones,
the stark reality of this decision
will descend upon everyone."
Government prosecutors, nat
urally, care little for world affairs.
At the White House's instruc
tion, they've begun to reel in a
handful of the 500,000 resisters,
one at a time, starting with Ben
Sasway, a 21-year-old Humboldt
State University student from
San Diego.
Sheer numbers aside, these
lawyers have their hands full.
The Selective Service was so
quick to issue its regulations last
year that it may have made mis
takes which could eventually
jeopardize the validity of regis
tration in court.
In the meantime, it's a dis
grace that Congress's leadership
role in foreign affairs has been
eclipsed by the actions of a
handful of frightened young
men. Leland hypothesizes that
the nuclear-freeze movement
has absolved many lawmakers
from speaking out on other, less
popular foreign policy issues.
Men such as Sasway and
Harkin, therefore, may be com
mitting acts of patriotism by risk
ing their liberty to compel other
Americans to join the debate on
U.S. foreign policy.
They would certainly stand
with Mark Twain when he
wrote: "My kind of loyalty was
loyalty to one's country, not to
its institutions or its of
ficeholders. The country is the
real thing ... to watch over."
