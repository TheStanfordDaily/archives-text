# Statistics prof, wins $192,000 award
## 
### Bill Ainsworth 
University Statistics Prof. Persi
Diaconis was named a recipient
of a $192,000, five-year Mac A
rthur Foundation fellowship last
Friday.
Although he knew he was
being considered for the award
because friends had been asked
to write letters to the founda
tion, Diaconis said he never
thought winningit was possible.
"I was very surprised," he
said.
There are no strings attached
to the award and Diaconis said
he has not yet decided what to
do with the money, although he
does plan to continue teaching
here.
Diaconis said he felt that he
won the award based upon his
work in Bayesian statistics, in
probabilistic theory of al
gorithms and in debunking
parapsychology.
The cash award will be un
taxed because Diaconis did not
apply for the grant and because
he is not obligated to do any
thing in return for the money.
Diaconis claims that there are

no reproducible experiments
done in parapsychology, al
though he said some work com
pleted in that area leads one to
believe that it is reproducible.
"It's not terribly serious re
search," he said.
In his work criticizing parap
sychology, Diaconis said he was
aided by his experience as a
magician. For 10 years he per
formed magic all around the
world, specializing in sleight
of-hand tricks.

"I know both about deception
physically and deception with
bad numbers," he said.
According to Science
magazine, Diaconis is one of
only 25 people in the world who
can shuffle a deck of cards per
fectly eight times in a row, re
turning the deck to its original
order.
He left magic at the age of 24 to
go to college because he was
unable to understand an under
graduate book in statistics.
"I wanted to read the best un
dergraduate book in statistics
but couldn't because I could not
understand the calculus in it,"
Diaconis said.
Diaconis continues his associ
ation with magic by keeping up
with the latest developments in
the field, inventing new tricks
and performing tricks at magic
conventions such as the recent
magician's convention in Palo
Alto.
Occasionally, Diaconis said,
he considers taking a year off to
concentrate on magic, but he
has so far always decided that
working in math and statistics is

more rewarding. "The differ
ence between the two fields is
that the competition in math and
statistics is greater," he said.
After 10 years of performing, the
attraction of the "glamorous"
lifestyle of a performer has en
tirely diminished, he added.
Diaconis does not confine his
work in statistics to mathemati
cal applications. Instead, he
makes a great effort toward ap
plying his knowledge to a broad
range of fields. He has written
papers relating statistics to
philosophy, psychology, air pol
lution and medicine.
The award, Diaconis said, will
not have a great impact on his
life. "I'm pretty much doing
what I want to do right now. If I
had my choice this is where I'd
be," he explained.
The award will have some im
pact, he said, in that it will allow
him to "dig deeper" into his new
area of research — group
theory. "Without the award, I
probably wouldn't have been
able to do it with as much flexi
bility or as rapidly as I will now,"
he said.
