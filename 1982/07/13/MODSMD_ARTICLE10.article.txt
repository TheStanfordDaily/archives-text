Lantos must go
Peninsula residents have
grown to expect decent and
forthright representation from
their Congressmen. Two years
ago, I was shocked that Tom Lan
tos was elected to Congress.
However, I had hoped that he
would follow in the tradition of
Pete McCloskey, Leo Ryan and
Bill Royer in caring about the
concerns of Peninsula residents.
He hasn't. He has made a moc
kery of congressional represen
tation. His latest tantrum at a
Redwood City press conference
is proof. Lantos stated that
Royer's use of the theme, "He's
one of us ..." is bigoted, anti
semetic and unique in American
politics. As a Democrat, member
of the jewish faith and 12 year
member of the Pacifica City
Council I could not be more of
fended. Not only is Royer honest
and compassionate, his theme,
"He's one of us . . ."is probably

the most widely used theme in
campaigns.
My disgust with Lantos and his
total disregard for the office
which he is privileged to hold is
only one reason for my interest
in this race. Bill Royer is the
other. I have known Bill to be an
effective, compassionate and
extremely intelligent public offi
cial. He has demonstrated excel
lent judgement and concern for
real public needs. And unlike
Lantos, but in the tradition of his
predecessors McCloskey and
Ryan, Bill will work for the many
communities on the Peninsula,
not seek to divide them as Lan
tos has done. This is the true test
of a United States Congressman.
It is my hope that voters, regard
less of affiliation or philosophy,
will work to return Bill Royer to
office. Lantos must go.
