# ASSU monitors Stanford Players
## 
### Karen Springen 
The ASSU is serving as
executor of The Stanford
Players, taking a role in working
with a club for the first time, ac
cording to Student Financial
Manager Bob Brody. As
executor, the ASSU is monitor
ing rather than directing the the
ater group's financial activities.
According to Brody, the Stan
ford Players accumulated a $2000
debt this year, largely from poor
attendance at the group's spring
production of Side by Side by
Sondheim. The ASSU is not li
able for any of this debt but is
putting up the working capital
which the theater group needs.
"We're not paying off their
debts," he stressed.
The ASSU will help the
Players' efforts to earn money

through movies. Through work
ing with ASSU Sunday Flicks Di
rector Scott Coley, The Players
should learn the aspects of suc
cessful film production, said
Brody. He pointed to The Player
s'problems with their Friday film
series. For example, last Friday's
film, Young Frankenstein, was
cancelled because of insuffi
cient funds and incorrect forms,
said Brody.
Brody stressed that The
Players are using film produc
tion to decrease their debt.
"They're just using movies as a
fund-raiser," he said. "After
they get out of debt, they won't
want to run movies any more."
Any expenditures by the club
over the summer must be ap
proved by Brody and Coley.
