Participants in an all-day conference held by the As
sociation of Arab-American University Graduates
(AAUG) in San Francisco last Saturday focused on the
Israeli invasion of Lebanon.
The AAUG disseminates information in the United
States concerning Arab culture, heritage and politics to
promote better understanding between Americans
and Arabs. The conference focused on action and
analysis.
Three workshops dealt with medical relief to Leba
non, organizing Arab-Americans, and outreach and
education of non-Arab Americans concerning the
Palestinian cause and the current crisis.
AAUG national board member Nabiha Ghandour
noted that the AAUG, and many other Arab and Ameri
can groups in the United States, has begun active relief
efforts directed toward war victims in Lebanon. Urgent
medical sijpplies are being gathered from donors in
many parts of the United States for shipment to relief
organizations in Lebanon, he said. But the Israeli bloc
kade of Western Beirut is hindering relief work.
The other workshops stressed the need for Arab-

Americans to combat misperceptions in the United
States regarding the Palestinian cause and political
realities in the Middle East. Speakers argued that the
Judeo-Christian religious heritage of the United States,
the strength of the Israeli lobby, and unfair media
coverage have led to blind and uncritical American
support for Israel as well as inaccurate stereotyping of
the Palestinians.
Some participants complained that the U.S. media
has not shown the suffering and anguish of the Palesti
nians. The workshop covered practical means of pre
senting the American public with an Arab perspective
on the current conflict.
The afternoon's panel discussion, led by various
Middle Eastern scholars, turned to analysis of the
sources and meaning of the Israeli invasion. Most
speakers viewed the Israeli invasion as an attempt to
crush the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO). Elia
Zureik, professor of sociology at Queens University,
argued for a "people's war against Israeli aggression."
Khalil Nakhleh, director of the Institute of Arab
Studies, said that Israel has two major objectives in the
present campaign. "Israel wants to destroy the diverse

set of institutions which make up the PLO," he said. In
addition to the military operation in Lebanon, Nakhleh
pointed to recent Israeli actions in the West Bank
where certain schools have been closed and several
Palestinian mayors have been ousted by Israeli au
thorities.
Second, the Israelis "are asking Lebanon to become
an Israeli protectorate," he said. He concluded, "It is
our responsibility to reaffirm . . . that the PLO con
tinues to be the sole and legitimate representative of
the Palestinian people."
Dwight Simpson, professor at San Francisco State
and a Stanford alumnus, said, "There is a horrible
parallel between the behavior of the Nazi's in Germany
and the Israeli's in Lebanon." He criticized the interna
tional community for failure to actively and vigorously
condemn Israel during the present invasion. Referring
to the inability of the UN security troops in Southern
Lebanon to hold back or slow down the Israeli inva
sion, Simpson said, "The UN has become a bad joke."
Eric Davis, a political science professor from Rutgers,
criticized the relatively passive response of Arab gov
ernments to the Palestinian's plight in Lebanon.
