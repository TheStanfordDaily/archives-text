## Elton's back, you been? 
### Elton John Jump Up! Geffen Records by Tom Brennan 
It's been a long time since
Elton John has put out a great
album. The descent in quality
was both abrupt and pervasive
following the release of Captain
Fantastic and the Brown Dirt
Cowboy. John's original, suc
cessful band of Nigel Olsson,
Davey Johnstone and Dee Mur
ray went out on their own, and
John slapped together a new
band and released a terrible al
bum, Rock of the Westies, filled
with forgettable songs.
The final blow came with the
departure of Bernie Taupin, El
ton's lyricist, after Blue Moves.
Since then, John has come out
with Single Man, 21 at 33, Victim
of Love and The Fox. Each of
these records contains quickly
produced, cocktail/disco music
which managed to fill the void of
vinyl and not much else.
Elton's friend, Rod Stewart,
managed to survive his disco
phase and remain popular â€”
some people kept buying his re
cords. However, most of Elton's

fans did not, and his popularity
and record sales declined.
In his latest release, Jump Up,
John manages to rise above pre
dictable obscurity and come out
with some pleasant melodies
and lyrics. This metamorphosis
comes on the heels of Elton
reuniting his original band for
the current tour and using Ber
nie Taupin's lyrics once again;
these events and the improve
ment in musical quality are
probably not merely a coinci
dence.
Jump Up opens nicely with
"Dear John" and "Spiteful
Child," two songs that are sim
ple and clean sounding. Yet,
both of them manage to keep
guitar and piano lines distinct
and forceful.
"Ball and Chain" is next on the
first side. Pete Townshend plays
guitar on this track, which has a
pleasant sound as does "I am
Your Robot," which follows.
The other two songs on the
first side, "Legal Boys" and
"Blue Eyes," are written by Tim
Rice and Gary Osborne respec
tively. Unfortunately, they are
both poorly written and sound
indistinguishable from other

similar songs on Blue Moves and
Single Man.
"Legal Boys" (about divorce
and lawyers) becomes absurd as
Rice not so subtly searches for
rhymes: "There's a lot I'd like to
tell you/But I can't get past your
guards/I do not speak their
language/And they hold all the
cards."
"Blue Eyes" also sounds
ridiculous as it describes a
woman who manages to have
blue eyes in the morning and
blue eyes in the evening as well:
"Blue eyes, baby's got blue
eyes/When the morning comes
. . . Baby's got blue eyes/And I
am home again." The piece is
sung with such seriousness that
it becomes a parody in itself.
The second side of the album
is much better as it begins with
"Empty Garden (Hey Hey
Johnny)," a song about John
Lennon. It represents Elton John
and BernieTaupin's bestwork in
a long time, suggesting that,
given a subject they really care
about, they can still produce a
great song.
Apparently, they cared about
the rest of the album as well be

cause it finishes out nicely with
"Princess," "Where Have All the
Good Times Gone?" and "All
Quiet on the Western Front."
Each track combines good lyrics
with appropriate music to make
the album a good one overall
and a distinct improvement over
previous efforts.
The album may have been in
appropriately titled, however.
For the fans of his early music, it
may not be time to "Jump Up"
and rejoice, but rather time to
"Wake Up" and take notice be
cause Elton John and company
have the essential ingredients
and potential to make great
music once again.
