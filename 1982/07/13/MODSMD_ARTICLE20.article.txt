Israeli, PLO talks stalled
Beirut, Lebanon — Talks to end the Israeli siege of
Beirut are stalled because there is no Arab country
willing to take the PLO's guerrillas, a key Lebanese
mediator said yesterday.
As people on both sides of the beleaguered city
inspected the damage from Sunday's artillery ex
changes, former prime minister Saeb Salam said it is
up to the United States to find a country willing to
accept the guerrillas now that Syria has announced it
will not.
The leader of a radical PLO faction, in an interview,
said the PLO would not leave Lebanon completely,
and all but dared the Israelis to invade the Beirut's
Moslem sector and try to push them out.
"If we are forced to face the Israeli war machine
here in Beirut we are ready for it," said Dr. George
Habash, leader of the Popular Front for the Liberation
of Palestine, a Marxist, Soviet-backed group that is the
second largest of the Palestine Liberation Organiza
tion's eight factions.
"We are not leaving Lebanon and will continue
fighting not only from Lebanon but from Syria, Egypt
and Jordan, not by taking permission from anyone but
by forcing our military presence in all the countries
that surround Palestine," said Habash, in an interview
with Associated Press correspondent Alex Efty.
"Don't ask me about negotiations," PLO chairman
Yasser Arafat shouted in response to a question from
AP correspondent Terry Anderson on the progress of
the political talks. Arafat, inspecting the damage from
Israeli shelling around the PLO headquarters, waved
to the surrounding wreckage. "Ask me about this. You
should be writing about this."
"Why negotiate?" Arafat went on, saying Israeli
Prime Minister Menachem Begin "is insisting on de
stroying every house, every building, social and pub
lic institution, water and electricity and hospitals. This
is criminal."
"You are doing this, you are paying for this from
your taxes/' he told Anderson, an American. "One
hundred-ten thousand shells yesterday in 18 hours.
Tell Reagan to send more of these nice modern
weapons to Israel."
Britain returns Argentine POWs
Britain — Satisfied that Argentina considers hos
tilities in the South Atlantic at an end, Britain an
nounced Monday it is returning the remaining 593
Argentine prisoners who surrendered on the Falkland
Islands a month ago.
However, Britain will maintain its air and sea bloc
kade of the Falklands and the Argentine Coastline,
and the economic sanctions it imposed after Argen
tina invaded the islands April 2.
In Washington, President Reagan announced yes
terday, the immediate lifting of U.S. economic sanc
tions imposed against Argentina in support of Britain.
The sanctions included withholding new Export-
Import bank credits, insurance and guarantees; and
new Commodity Credit Corp. guarantees. But military
sanctions imposed in the Carter administration as a
result of human rights policies in Argentina will re-

main.
The final exchange of prisoners, including the re
lease Thursday of the sole British prisoner held by
Argentina, Flight Lt. Jeffrey Clover, did nothing to
resolve the bitter sovereignty dispute which led to the
74-day undeclared war that saw 255 British and 712
Argentine lives lost.
The Argentines claim sovereignty over the islands,
British for 149 years, and the two countries had been
negotiating the issue off and on for 17 years until the
Argentine invasion. Britain now says it will be a long
time before the matter is reopened.
The 593 prisoners, including commanding officer
Brig. Gen. Mario Banjamin Menendez, will be sent
home soon aboard the British passenger ferry St. Ed
mund, headed for Argentina's Puerto Madryn, the
Foreign Office announced.
At first Britain sought an "authoritative" statement
fj=<Sm Buenos Aires that hostilities were over, but fi
nally settled for "indications" that all conflict had
ceased.
The Foreign Office said these indications came
partly in an exchange of messages with Argentina and
partly from other sources, including "confidential
statements" relayed from Argentina.
Draft indictment expected
Roanoke, Va — An indictment is expected to be
handed down Tuesday against a Bridgewater College
student who failed to register for the draft.
Enten Eller, 20, of LaVerne, Calif., has said he ex
pects to be indicted by a U.S. District Court grand jury
here because he didn't register for the draft when
registration was reinstituted in 1980.
U.S. Attorney John Perry Alderman said Monday,
"The grand jury's going to meet tomorrow ... on a
particular case, I couldn't say anything else."
Alderman said he had read published statements in
which Eller said he expected to be indicted.
Underscoring Eller's conviction that he will be the
second person charged in the United States with fail
ing to register, the math and physics major has
scheduled a news conference today in Washington.
A California college student, Benjamin Sasway, 21,
was indicted June 30 in San Diego on one count of
failure to register. The maximum penalty if convicted
on the charge is a five-year prison sentence and a
$10,000 fine.
Supporters of Eller will hold a vigil outside the fed
eral courthouse in Roanoke at 11 a.m. today, followed
by their own news conference at 12:15 p.m., said Ray
Cingerich, a spokesman for Christians for Peace.
Drunk driver convicted of murder
San Francisco — California's first conviction of a
drinking driver on murder charges sets the scene for
similar prosecutions throughout the state, drunken
driving foes said yesterday.
"It's flat murder. There's nothing excusable," said
Duke Van Dyke, vice president of Mothers Against
Drunk Driving. "Hopefully, this is the type of thing
that will help bring it to public attention," Van Dyke
said yesterday.
Van Dyke said Madd, which was founded in 1980 by

a woman whose daughter was killed by a drunken
driver, is "not a temperance group," but an organiza
tion anxious to see drinking drivers responsible for
their actions.
"It is a willful thing. I don't know many people who
have alcohol forced down their throats," he said.
"Most of us get to the point where we know we prob
ably shouldn't be stepping into a car."
On Friday, a seven-woman, five-man jury in Red
ding convicted Robert Watson, 37, of two counts of
second-degree murder in connection with the Jan. 3,
1979 deaths of Penny Maillet, 22, of Redding and her
6-year-old daughter, Michelle. Another daughter was
injured.
The jury, which also convicted Watson of drunken
driving, deliberated six hours before delivering the
verdicts, which attorneys said marked the first time a
Californian has been convicted of a murder charge in
such a case.
The state Supreme Court cleared the way for the
conviction last November when it ruled that Watson's
conduct "was sufficiently wanton to hold him on a
second-degree murder charge."
Police said Watson was driving at 84 mph in a 35 mph
zone and that his blood-alcohol level was .23, well
above the legal limit of .10.
Under state law, a person convicted of vehicular
manslaughter could be sentenced up to one year in
jail. However, a second-degree murder conviction
carries a penalty of 15 years to life in prison.
British palace intruder arrested
London — "A man was arrested in Buckingham
Palace on Friday morning after entering the bedroom
of Her Majesty the Queen," Home Secretary William
Whitelaw said Monday in an extraordinary House of
Commons statement recalling earlier times when
court intrigue put many a British monarch in peril.
An unconfirmed report in the Daily Express said the
intruder sat on the bed of Queen Elizabeth II around 3
a.m. Friday and the two talked quietly for 10 minutes
until the monarch gained his confidence. The 56-
year-old queen then summoned a footman on the
pretense of getting the prowler a cigarette, and the
servant hustled him away, the report said.
Whitelaw promised an immediate inquiry, describ
ing himself as "shocked and staggered" by the breach
of royal security.
He gave no details of the incident, but told the
Commons "The House will admire the calm way in
which her majesty responded to what occurred."
Lawmakers and the press asked "How could it hap
pen?" and the furor mounted when government
spokesman Lord Elton told the House of Lords that the
intruder was the same man charged Saturday with a
June 7 palace break-in.

Israeli, PLO talks stalled
Beirut, Lebanon — Talks to end the Israeli siege of
Beirut are stalled because there is no Arab country
willing to take the PLO's guerrillas, a key Lebanese
mediator said yesterday.
As people on both sides of the beleaguered city
inspected the damage from Sunday's artillery ex
changes, former prime minister Saeb Salam said it is
up to the United States to find a country willing to
accept the guerrillas now that Syria has announced it
will not.
The leader of a radical PLO faction, in an interview,
said the PLO would not leave Lebanon completely,
and all but dared the Israelis to invade the Beirut's
Moslem sector and try to push them out.
"If we are forced to face the Israeli war machine
here in Beirut we are ready for it," said Dr. George
Habash, leader of the Popular Front for the Liberation
of Palestine, a Marxist, Soviet-backed group that is the
second largest of the Palestine Liberation Organiza
tion's eight factions.
"We are not leaving Lebanon and will continue
fighting not only from Lebanon but from Syria, Egypt
and Jordan, not by taking permission from anyone but
by forcing our military presence in all the countries
that surround Palestine," said Habash, in an interview
with Associated Press correspondent Alex Efty.
"Don't ask me about negotiations," PLO chairman
Yasser Arafat shouted in response to a question from
AP correspondent Terry Anderson on the progress of
the political talks. Arafat, inspecting the damage from
Israeli shelling around the PLO headquarters, waved
to the surrounding wreckage. "Ask me about this. You
should be writing about this."
"Why negotiate?" Arafat went on, saying Israeli
Prime Minister Menachem Begin "is insisting on de
stroying every house, every building, social and pub
lic institution, water and electricity and hospitals. This
is criminal."
"You are doing this, you are paying for this from
your taxes/' he told Anderson, an American. "One
hundred-ten thousand shells yesterday in 18 hours.
Tell Reagan to send more of these nice modern
weapons to Israel."
Britain returns Argentine POWs
Britain — Satisfied that Argentina considers hos
tilities in the South Atlantic at an end, Britain an
nounced Monday it is returning the remaining 593
Argentine prisoners who surrendered on the Falkland
Islands a month ago.
However, Britain will maintain its air and sea bloc
kade of the Falklands and the Argentine Coastline,
and the economic sanctions it imposed after Argen
tina invaded the islands April 2.
In Washington, President Reagan announced yes
terday, the immediate lifting of U.S. economic sanc
tions imposed against Argentina in support of Britain.
The sanctions included withholding new Export-
Import bank credits, insurance and guarantees; and
new Commodity Credit Corp. guarantees. But military
sanctions imposed in the Carter administration as a
result of human rights policies in Argentina will re-

main.
The final exchange of prisoners, including the re
lease Thursday of the sole British prisoner held by
Argentina, Flight Lt. Jeffrey Clover, did nothing to
resolve the bitter sovereignty dispute which led to the
74-day undeclared war that saw 255 British and 712
Argentine lives lost.
The Argentines claim sovereignty over the islands,
British for 149 years, and the two countries had been
negotiating the issue off and on for 17 years until the
Argentine invasion. Britain now says it will be a long
time before the matter is reopened.
The 593 prisoners, including commanding officer
Brig. Gen. Mario Banjamin Menendez, will be sent
home soon aboard the British passenger ferry St. Ed
mund, headed for Argentina's Puerto Madryn, the
Foreign Office announced.
At first Britain sought an "authoritative" statement
fj=<Sm Buenos Aires that hostilities were over, but fi
nally settled for "indications" that all conflict had
ceased.
The Foreign Office said these indications came
partly in an exchange of messages with Argentina and
partly from other sources, including "confidential
statements" relayed from Argentina.
Draft indictment expected
Roanoke, Va — An indictment is expected to be
handed down Tuesday against a Bridgewater College
student who failed to register for the draft.
Enten Eller, 20, of LaVerne, Calif., has said he ex
pects to be indicted by a U.S. District Court grand jury
here because he didn't register for the draft when
registration was reinstituted in 1980.
U.S. Attorney John Perry Alderman said Monday,
"The grand jury's going to meet tomorrow ... on a
particular case, I couldn't say anything else."
Alderman said he had read published statements in
which Eller said he expected to be indicted.
Underscoring Eller's conviction that he will be the
second person charged in the United States with fail
ing to register, the math and physics major has
scheduled a news conference today in Washington.
A California college student, Benjamin Sasway, 21,
was indicted June 30 in San Diego on one count of
failure to register. The maximum penalty if convicted
on the charge is a five-year prison sentence and a
$10,000 fine.
Supporters of Eller will hold a vigil outside the fed
eral courthouse in Roanoke at 11 a.m. today, followed
by their own news conference at 12:15 p.m., said Ray
Cingerich, a spokesman for Christians for Peace.
Drunk driver convicted of murder
San Francisco — California's first conviction of a
drinking driver on murder charges sets the scene for
similar prosecutions throughout the state, drunken
driving foes said yesterday.
"It's flat murder. There's nothing excusable," said
Duke Van Dyke, vice president of Mothers Against
Drunk Driving. "Hopefully, this is the type of thing
that will help bring it to public attention," Van Dyke
said yesterday.
Van Dyke said Madd, which was founded in 1980 by

a woman whose daughter was killed by a drunken
driver, is "not a temperance group," but an organiza
tion anxious to see drinking drivers responsible for
their actions.
"It is a willful thing. I don't know many people who
have alcohol forced down their throats," he said.
"Most of us get to the point where we know we prob
ably shouldn't be stepping into a car."
On Friday, a seven-woman, five-man jury in Red
ding convicted Robert Watson, 37, of two counts of
second-degree murder in connection with the Jan. 3,
1979 deaths of Penny Maillet, 22, of Redding and her
6-year-old daughter, Michelle. Another daughter was
injured.
The jury, which also convicted Watson of drunken
driving, deliberated six hours before delivering the
verdicts, which attorneys said marked the first time a
Californian has been convicted of a murder charge in
such a case.
The state Supreme Court cleared the way for the
conviction last November when it ruled that Watson's
conduct "was sufficiently wanton to hold him on a
second-degree murder charge."
Police said Watson was driving at 84 mph in a 35 mph
zone and that his blood-alcohol level was .23, well
above the legal limit of .10.
Under state law, a person convicted of vehicular
manslaughter could be sentenced up to one year in
jail. However, a second-degree murder conviction
carries a penalty of 15 years to life in prison.
