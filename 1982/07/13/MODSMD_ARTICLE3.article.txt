# Trustees approve funds for Stanford West
## 
### Colleen Gillard 
Stanford trustees have approved
money for a 1500-unit housing develop
ment on 51 acres along Willow Road in a
move that expresses active interest in
meeting the housing needs of junior fa
culty and mid-level staff.
Citing the Palo Alto housing shortage
as responsible for creating one of the
highest priced housing markets in the
country, the Office of Housing Programs
says that Stanford West will more than
double the amount of housing the Uni
versity currently provides its faculty and
staff.
With faculty that numbers nearly 1500
and more than 11,000 staff, the University
now houses nearly 70 percent of its fa
culty while meeting only about four per
cent of its staff's needs.
Beyond the problems junior faculty and
staff face in the tight local housing mar
ket, there are more immediate and
specialized needs faced by hospital staff,
nurses, interns and visitors (e.g. visiting

faculty, SLAC users), averaging 500 annu
ally, with an additional 400 in Hospital
House staff (or residents and interns).
Housing needs for residents and interns
are particularly acute because of their
long hours and small salaries.
Staff positions at the University may be
broken into three categories: 4310 work
ing for the hospital, 5470 working on
campus, and 1220 working at SLAC,foran
overall total of 11,000.
Although junior faculty and senior staff
members are eligible to buy one of the
140 units under construction on Peter
Coutts Hill, non-tenured faculty, if de
nied tenure, must sell within two years.
At Stanford West, they would not be re
quired to sell. The University even ex
pects that, over time, as many as 30 per
cent of the families in Stanford West
could lose their University affiliation
through changes in employment.
Stanford West acreage, split between
two sites, aims for high and medium de
nsity construction. The larger 46-acre site

between the Children's Health Council
and Oak Creek apartments, would be de
signed for multi-family residences at a
density of 28-units per acre. Comprising
1282 units, this development would fea
ture two-bedroom units.
The smaller site (194 units on 4.5 acres)
will be located across Willow Road, par
tially bounded by Pasteur Drive and
Welch Road. As high-density zoning, this
site would meet the maximum allowable
city limit of 45 units per acre. Primarily
designed for visitors and Stanford Hospi
tal House Staff, the majority of apart
ments would be studios and one
bedroom units. Because of the relatively
short duration of internships and resi
dences, these apartments would not be
for sale but would be held as permanent
rentals. Also located on this site, the 42-
unit, one-bedroom "hotel" realizes a
long-standing University desire to serve
extended care out-patients and their
families.
According to the Office of Housing

Programs the complex may eventually
see a population between 2600 and 3500
with about 800 school-age children.
Money from the proceeds of the Peter
Coutts project has been funding the ini
tial design studies for Stanford West,
which will cost $1,250,000. The project's
estimated costs top $200 million in bor
rowed funds. The University hopes to
reap a $30 million profit. (In comparison,
Peter Coutts will bring the University $6
million.)
Frank Morrow, director of Housing
Programs, hopes to see construction
begin no later than next summer and to
continue over the next four to seven
years, assuming all goes well before the
city council and planning boards. His of
fice has just finished an environmental
impact report which is now under city
scrutiny.
Bruce Freeland of Palo Alto City Plan
ning believes that although this is the
largest single development his office has
