# Dorm construction proceeds

Construction of the new dor
mitories is proceeding on
schedule and barring a workers
strikÂ° three new row houses
should be ready for student oc
cupancy by fall according to
Jan Van Houten, director of new
residences.
Van Houten said there is a
possibility of a trade union strike
at the end of this month as well
as a possible Stanford
employees' strike in late August.
Either of these strikes could
delay opening of the new row
houses.
"We're keeping our fingers
crossed that neither strike oc
curs," Van Houten said. Should
opening be delayed, students
assigned to EAST House will live
at 353 Campus Drive (the former
Zete House). "Contingency
space" has also been reserved in
Manzanita Park for students as
signed to the other row houses.
An on-time opening means that
180 currently unassigned stu
dents will have a place to live in
the fall.
The row houses are only the

first three portions of a project
comprising 17 units. Eventu
ally when the project is com
pleted the 850 additional hous
ing spaces provided may allow
undergrads four years of guaran
teed on campus housing.
By September 7, the last of the
three houses should be turned
over to the university for "activa
tion." Once final touches such
as carpeting and furnishing are
completed, the houses will be
ready for occupancy.
The row house nearest to
completion is the East Asian
Studies Theme (EAST) House.
Like the other theme houses on
campus, it will offer programs
consistent with its cultural em
phasis.
Each row house is three
stories high and will house 60
students mostly in doubles and
singles. Several of the rpoms
have sliding glass doors which
open onto small balconies.
Another 260 places in Man
zanita will be occupied during
autumn quarter by the future re
sidents of the suite complex,
scheduled for occupancy by

January 3.
"One of the reasons why they
(the students assigned to the
suites) are all living in Manzanita
is so they can develop a com
munity and make decisions
about the future," Van Houten
said.
The suites consist of two
houses of 90 students each, and
two of 40. Their living arrange
ment is unique at Stanford.
Croups of four or six students
will share a common living room
and bathroom, while each will
have a bedroom.
Students living in the suites
will eat in one of four eating
clubs. The clubs each have a
capacity of 90, which allows for
100 eating associates who do not
live in the suites.
In mid-October of this year,
two more units will be turned
over to the University. The first
contains four "Holiday Inn"-
style accomodations, for guests
of students. It also includes a
more elaborate "Guest in Resi
dence" space, suitable for hous
ing a guest professor or other
