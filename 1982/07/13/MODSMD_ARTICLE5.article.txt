## Congress apprehensive about marines in Lebanon 
### 
Washington (AP) — Congress
returned from its Fourth of July
recess Monday expressing in
creasing doubts about the wis
dom of sending U.S. Marines to
Lebanon to participate in a
peacekeeping force.
"For the most part, I am ap
prehensive," House Majority
Leader Jim Wright (D-Tex.) told
reporters. He said the situation
in Lebanon changes so drasti
cally from day to day that it is
uncertain what the mission of
the troops would be.
Senate Republican Leader
Howard Baker, said that in his
home statp of Tennessee he
found "very little support" for

sending troops to the war-torn
Middle Eastern country.
Baker said the Marines
"would be in a very, very dif
ficult situation" and he hopes
President Ronald Reagan will not
send them.
Reagan said Sunday that he
stood by his offer of 1000 U.S.
Marines to aid the evacuation of
Palestine Liberation Organiza
tion guerrillas from Beirut, but
that he is "wary" of the idea and
has had no formal invitation
from the Lebanese government.
Stiffening congressional resis
tance to the proposed troop de
ployment was only part of the
swelling discontent in Congress

over the Israeli invasion. Such
discontent could endanger the
administration's request for
more aid to Israel.
In a speech on the Senate
floor yesterday, Sen. John
Melcher (D-Mont.) said the Is
raeli assault on Beirut "has gone
on too long."
Opposition to the troop
proposal has come from law

makers who normally support
the administration, such as Sen.
William Roth (R-Del.) who
wrote Reagan last week that
such a mission would be "ex
tremely hazardous" and should
be avoided.
In Tel Aviv, however, Israeli
Prime Minister Menachem
Begin dismissed as "totally un
founded" a statement by Sen.

Charles Percy, chairman of the
Senate Foreign Relations Com
mittee, that U.S. support for Is
rael was waning because of the
Lebanon invasion.
Percy (R-lll.) appearing on
the CBS television program
Face the Nation, said Sunday
that relations between Israel and
the United States are at the low
est point in 25 years.
