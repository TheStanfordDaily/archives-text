# Women thought unfit to manage
## 
### Associated Press 
Women still climb the corpo
rate ladder more slowly and for
less money than men. Salary
statistics tell part of the story:
Only 0.8 percent of full-time
working women earn $25,000,
compared to 12 percent of such
men.
A Harvard Business Review

survey of 2000 executives done
17 years ago tells another part â€”
one most male managers are
now reluctant to openly admit.
Of those surveyed, 51 percent of
the men believed women were
"temporarily unfit for manage
ment."
A recent three-year study by
the Wellesley College Center for

Research on Women found that
despite a greater number of
women in management, qual
ified young women were not
being promoted into senior
management, in part because
female junior managers don't
get the same feedback from
male superiors as aspi ring young
men.
