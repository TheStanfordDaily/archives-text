# Mayors: no thank you to New Federalism
## 
### 
Washington (AP) — The na
tion's cities, large and small
alike, have run into financial
troubles enough without the
go-it-alone philosophy en
visioned by President Ronald
Reagan's "New Federalism," the
National League of Cities said
yesterday.
The organization made public
a survey of the finances of 43
cities, ranging from Green River,
Wyoming to New York City,

which said that most found ex
penditures growing faster than
revenues and most have been
unable or unwilling to replace
lost federal aid from their own
revenues.
On average, the cities re
ported that their outlays grew
last year by 13.3 percent and
their income by only 11.1 per
cent, Seattle Mayor Charles
Royer, first vice president of the
league, told a news conference.

Royer said cities "are cutting
back on many fronts, and they
are finding it difficult — if not
impossible — to step in to run
programs being cut by the fed
eral government."
His report came on the eve of
Reagan's trip to Baltimore to ad
dress the National Association of
Mayors in an attempt to sell his
revised "new federalism" prog
ram, which is intended to reor
ganize the federal system of

government in America.
The president's program calls
for turning about 30 federal
urban programs over to the
cities and states, with a $20 bill
ion trust fund set up to cushion
the impact over an eight-year
period.
Baltimore is often cited as a
city that has revitalized itself
with the use of federal prog
rams, and Royer said if he were
Reagan he would not "take a
look at what's happened in that
federal partnership" because he
would find refutation for his
own philosophy.
As for Reagan's updated ver
sion of the "New Federalism"
Royer said, "I'm afraid we have
to say 'no thank you.' " Reagan
revamped his proposals to meet
objections raised by state and
city officials when the president
first unveiled the plan in his
State of the Union address last
January.
He said the president was
using an attractive idea — self
sufficiency — to cloak slashes in
federal help for cities and to
carry out "some simplistic ex
tremes with radical results in
cities."
For example, he said the ad

ministration's urban policy
statement, issued last week, is
based on the idea that federal
aid to the poor is what keeps
poor people from leaving big
cities and searching out "that
'silicon valley' of employment
out there somewhere."
