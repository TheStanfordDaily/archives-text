## Viewpoint/Glen and Shearer Pageboy scandal only one of many 
### 
Washington — Compared to
the British, Americans have a re
latively high threshold for scan
dal. Few public "developments"
— illicit affairs involving public
officials, for example — leave us
utterly speechless. Fewer yet
shake our foundations, moral or
otherwise.
Perhaps that explains why re
cent revelations of sexual favors
between some congressmen
and their errand-running pages
haven't curried nationwide out
rage as much as aroused a col
lective curiosity about the way
people in Washington live to

day.
As more details trickle out, the
most recent national embar
rassment could bring down a
few lawmakers and eventually
see the reform of the teenage
page program. If we can be sure
of anything over the coming
months, the pageboy scandal
will make for spicy front-page
dispatches from an increasingly
hot and sleepy capital city.
But before we find ourselves
overobsessed with another
episode of criminal behavior by
our elected officials, a note of
caution might be in order: Much
bigger — but unheralded —
scandals go on here every day.
While we fancy the sexual side
of Capitol Hill (there's even a
real-life soap opera designed to
play on this national weakness),
we tend to ignore the day-to-day
travesty perpetrated by special
interest lobbies, political action
committees (PACs) and lawmak
ers. Though legal, their influ
ence trading may be every bit as
reprehensible as the use and
abuse of a handful of teenagers.
For the 15 months ending in
April of this year, for example,
PACs of varying affiliations had
raised $109 million, a 50 percent
jump over a similar period in
1979 and 1980. By April they'd
already spent two-thirds of the
kitty on candidates. Collectively,
corporate and trade-association
groups have packed the biggest
punch.
Political money may be part of
the game and sanctioned by the
First Amendment, but it buys in
fluence all the same. Lobbyists
have made PAC favors an essen
tial and potent part of their arse
nal. For example, the recent
congressional decision to re
scind a Federal Trade Commis
sion (FTC) regulation concern
ing used cars was undoubtedly
influenced by three-quarters of
a million dollars in auto-dealer
industry PAC contributions to
incumbents.
Such vote-buying, moreover,
isn't always veiled in euphemis
tic language. One beverage in
dustry newsletter recently re
marked that it might take up to
seven years and $1 million to
pass a particular piece of pro
industry legislation.
Of course, for lawmakers, the
page sex scandal may only cloud
the already smoggy air of respec
tability surrounding Capitol Hill.
"However few members are in
volved in the scandal," noted
Rep. Mickey Leland (D-Texas),
"it will overshadow any integrity
displayed by the majority. It will
cause a bad shadow on the real
work of Congress."
But, in our own fascination
with the seamier side of a con
gressman's life, we might also be
abiding by the old rule of C.W.
Plunkett, the New York City
ward boss. Plunkett, who rose
through the Tammany Hall
machine at the turn of the cen
tury, saw a difference between
"honest graft" and "dishonest
graft." Can we honestly curse
the sexploitation of young
people without paying equal at
tention to the virtual selling of
Congress?
