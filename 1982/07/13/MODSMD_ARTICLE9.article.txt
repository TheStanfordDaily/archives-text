## Israeli invasion unhumanitarian 
### 
Only a few weeks ago, following the re
turn of the Sinai by Israel back to Egypt in
adherence to the provisions of the Camp
David Peace Treaty, Israel launched another
long-awaited blitz attack on Lebanon. This
full-scale invasion of Lebanon was ostensi
bly designed to liquidate on a permanent
basis the military wing of the Palestine
Liberation Organization in Lebanon.
Contrary to the repeated assurances of
Israeli Defense Minister Ariel Sharon in
merely establishing a "25-mile buffer
zone," the Israeli army deemed it rather
necessary to encircle the densely Moslem
populated West Beirut with the aid of their
right-wing Christian Phalange allies under
the Gemayel family. The purpose of the lat
ter operation is an attempt to stamp out
completely the political existence of the
Palestine Liberation Organization from
Lebanon.
So far the Israeli army has successfully
accomplished its military objectives of in
discriminately eliminating PLO military
targets and Palestinian refugee camps in
southern Lebanon. Such an operation at
times involved the use of F-15 and F-16
fighter jets as well as U.S.-made cluster
bombs which sometimes shockingly en
tailed the staging of civilian genocide to
flush out PLO pocket resistances. Such a
policy was also a blatant violation of Israel's
military pact with the United States regard
ing the utilization of the advanced super
fighters only for the defensive purposes of
the state of Israel.

According to United Nations Secretary-
General Javier Perez de Cuellar, half the
population of Lebanon — some 1.5 million
civilians — have been affected by the recent
fighting. Although no clear statistics have
been drawn, such media reports as Time
magazine estimate over 10,000 killed, 16,000
wounded and 300,000 left homeless in
southern Lebanon.
The casualty rates clearly indicate that the
Israeli invasion exceeded the humanitarian
scale of past incursions into neighboring
Lebanon. Hospitals exceeding full capacity
while running out of urgent medical
supplies were placed under direct Israeli
artillery. The Red Cross was prevented by
the Israeli army from entering the confines
of Beirut, a humanitarian mission which is
even performed in war-torn El Salvador.
As of last week, the supply of food and
non-durable foods to the inhabitants of
West Beirut was choked off to enhance the
state of siege on the Palestinian guerillas.
Such a policy, on one hand, once more
catapulted the concept of Zionism as an
expansionist movement in the political
arena of the Middle East. On the other
hand, the Palestinians were bitterly dep
rived of urgent material support from the
Arab states.
The present entrapment of some 500,000
civilians in West Beirut along with 6000
Palestinian guerillas by Israeli troops lingers

as one American-lsraeli-PLO peace prop
osal after another is rejected soundly by
each of the parties regarding in particular
the "terrorist status" or "well-being" of the
PLO.
The alarming rate of casualty sacrifices is
presently engendering some discontent
within Israel regarding the foreign policy
directions of Prime Minister Menachem
Begin. Of particular concern to some Is
raelis are the heavyhanded military tactics
of Sharon.
Unfortunately, on the other hand, few
Americans have truly realized the mag
nitude of the casualty rate comprised of in
nocent Lebanese victims without elaborat
ing on the massive destruction of the coun
try's vital natural resources. Until very re
cently, for instance, the general mass media
was far more preoccupied with the Falkland
Islands crisis.
In response to the grim vision of more
death and destruction, an ad-hoc commit
tee at Stanford's International Center estab
lished the Stanford Committee for Disaster
Relief in Lebanon. The purpose of the
committee is to raise disaster relief funds
for the innocent victims of the Israeli milit
ary actions in Lebanon. The contributions
received by the committee are channeled
directly via the American Friends Service
Committee to Lebanon.
