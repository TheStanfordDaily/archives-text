Washington â€” Following two days of
confirmation hearings, yesterday theSen
ate overwhelmingly approved part-time
Business School Prof. George Shultz's
nomination for the office of Secretary of
State. On Wednesday the Senate Foreign
Relations Committee unanimously ap
proved the former president of Bechtel
International's nomination.
The few concerns raised about Shultz's
nomination involved Shultz's role with

News analysis

Bechtel, an international engineering and
construction company that does a sub
stantial amount of business for Saudi Ara
bia.
In his opening statement, Shultz in
formed the committee that, "If I am con
firmed, agreements already executed by
me will result in my resignation from my
officerships in all Becthel entities ... Al
though I understand that these steps
leave me with no legal conflict of interest,
I will if I become Secretary of State, ex
ecute a statement removing myself from
any 'particular matter' involving
Bechtel."
The main concern seemed to be that if

Shultz planned to return to Bechtel after
his term as Secretary, those plans could
influence his decisions while in office. His
reply to all such queries was that he was a
professor and would go back to teaching.
Assuming, as Shultz joked to the Com
mittee, that the University board of
trustees grants him a leave of absence, he
will go on leave from the University, re
sign from Bechtel, Inc., and take over as
secretary of state.
Relaxed and poised at the hearings, the
62-year-old "transplanted Californian"
impressed the Foreign Relations Commit
tee with his direct, thoughtful answers. As
each senator in turn questioned him,
Shultz remained soft-spoken but firm in
his replies. He was not flustered or an
gered by the multitude of questions ad
dressed to him, and did not allow himself
to be bullied.
Throughout the hearings, Shultz re
iterated his loyalty to President Ronald
Reagan. He assured Senator Zorinsky (D-
Neb.) that while he expected to work
closely with the national security advisor
and the secretary of defense, the presi
dent was his boss, and his role would be to
carry out the president's foreign policy.
He also defended Reagan's policies
against Senator Paul Tsongas' (D-Mass.)
charges of inconsistancy.

Several senators expressed concern
over the situation in Lebanon and asked
Shultz what his plan of action, if any,
would be. Addressing the president's de
sire to send Marines to Lebanon, Shultz
said, "there's a lot to be gained if it can be
brought off, but there are lots of prob
lems too."
His views on the Palestinian Liberation
Organization (PLO) were mixed. "An or
ganization that conducts guerilla and ter
rorist activities has not been a construc
tive force and I don't see that it's helpful
to keep it around.
"But," he continued, "the Palestinians
have to be represented by people they
consider legitimate. I don't see any need
to keep the terroristic side of the or
ganization together but we will be look
ing for people whom the Palestinians
consider legitimate."
Another recurring issue, brought up by
Senators John Glenn (D-Ohio), Alan
Cranston (D-Calif.), and Larry Pressler (R-
S. Dak.) was nuclear proliferation. Shultz
agreed that the subject was of great im
portance, but was not convinced, as they
were, that the United States' role must
change.
"We sold nuclear plants around the
world with the promise of fuel and we
have to be faithful to that agreement," he

said. Shultz added that he agrees with the
administration's policy that being a sup
plier of nuclear materials is the best way
for the United States to try to limit pro
liferation.
"We have to realize that we're dealing
with intelligent people in those countries
(that the U.S. supplies nuclear fuel to)
who could figure it out for themselves
sooner or later."
Shultz said that by selling nuclear fuel
to those countries, the United States best
maintains its influence over their use of
that fuel. "I fear that if we aren't willing to
work with others, they'll go their own way
and we'll miss our chance to work with
them."
Asked what the greatest foreign policy
success of the Reagan administration was,
Shultz said it was achieving a bipartisan
agreement to strengthen our defense. He
said the reality is that "peace and security
can be assured only if we have the
strength and will to preserve them."
"We have passed through a decade,"
he said "during which the Soviet Union
expanded its military capability at a steady
and rapid rate while we stood still. Presi
dent Reagan has given us the leadership
to turn that situation around. And just in
time."
