## SATs measure questionable skills 
### 
Washington — Whatever your age, please
take 15 second to complete the following
sentence. Pencils ready? Begin now:
Today's Scholastic Aptitude Test...
a) reliably indicates "aptitudes" and goes
far in predicting how well a student will do in
college and thereafter.
b) measures not aptitude but achieve
ment, and is closely linked to socioeconomic
status.
c) holds undue significance in the eyes of
college admissions officers and adulterates
the quality of nearly everyone's secondary
education.
d) band c.
Pencils down. The correct answer is "d,"
though partial credit may be awarded for
marking "b" or "c." If you completely
choked, however, and opted for "a," you
need not feel ashamed. In fact, most people
misunderstand the meaning and value of
SATs.
For the thousands of high school seniors
brushing up on their vocabulary and
geometry this summer in preparation for
next fall's three-hour academic Armaged
don, additional criticism of the SAT may
seem beside the point. Students have always
regarded SATs, at best, as a pain in the neck
and, at worst, a worthless measurement of
one's ability. Besides, they know the Educa
tion Testing Service has occasionally an
swered its own questions inaccurately.
Yet, despite all that, few of us ever both
ered to question the mysterious relationship
between scores and aptitude — that is, our

capacity to learn. We always hoped that ETS
knew what it was doing.
But, unfortunately, according to North
western University sociologist Christopher
Jencks, we should have known better. After
reviewing several major ETS in-house stud
ies, Jencks concluded that SATs predict one's
potential no better than do achievement
tests on specified subjects. As he told our re
porter John Riccardi, "SAT scores seem to
vary according to one's previous schooling
and background at least as much as achieve
ment tests do."
Of course, when the College Board first
administered the SAT in 1926, educators
were looking for a way to measure students
by some criterion presumably insensitive to
the quality of previous schooling. Aptitude
was believed to be a stable trait (sort of like
genes) in individuals that did not vary ac
cording to one's upbringing. Achievement
— how much information one has already
learned — was thought to be closely linked
to one's background.
One doesn't need to be able to score a
perfect 800, though, to guess that the distinc
tion between achievement and aptitude has
since been blurred. If Johnny High School
can define "terpsichorean," who's to say
whether it's due to Johnny's aptitude for vo
cabulary, his parents' frequent use of the
word, or because his high school had a
dance requirement? And does it really mat
ter to colleges?
Indeed, aptitude and achievement are re
ally just two sides of the same coin. If you've

got one, you've got the other. "For those
concerned with equality of opportunity, the
choice between so-called 'aptitude' and
'achievement' tests is a toss-up," said jencks.
As a result, SATs seem to have lost their
stuff as distributors of educational justice.
Moreover, the SAT's emphasis on so-called
"aptitude" only reinforces a popular student
notion: working harder won't help you get
ahead; only some kind of inherent "smarts"
will.
Before Stanley Kaplan — the almighty ad
ministrator of SAT brush-up courses — re
places Horace Mann as the father of public
education, high school administrators may
want to pressure their collegiate coun
terparts into placing more emphasis on
achievement tests and paying less homage to
the SAT. At the moment, five times as many
students take the SAT as do achievement
tests, a ratio that seems to value manipulative
skills over knowledge and teaching.
At a time when, for example, only 25 per
cent of all college students can describe the
nature of the Salvadoran conflict, college ad
missions policies should explicitly en
courage students to master course work and
reward the knowledge that diligence brings.
Otherwise, we're nearing a day when stu
dents only pore over Barron's "How to Pre
pare ..." books and cram for but one test a
year.
