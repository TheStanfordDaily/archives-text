# Upward Bound readies students for college
## 
### Elizabeth Drye 
Given its aims of motivating
and preparing high school stu
dents for college, the Upward
Bound program's on-campus lo
cation seems highly appropriate.
The 82 participants in the Uni
versity branch of the nation
wide program are being housed
in Kairos and Grove-Mayfield.
Stanford Upward Bound partici
pants are Sequoia Union High
School students, many of whom
live in Redwood City and East
Palo Alto.
Although the program oper
ates year-round, the highlight of
its activities comes during the
summer when students live in
college dormitories and take
classes designed to prepare
them for the upcoming year.
Throughout the rest of the year
students receive tutoring and
participate in cultural activities
under the guidance of counsel
ors.
Selection for the program, ac
cording to its description is
based on recommendation of
teachers, counselors, social ser
vice agencies and close acquain
tances. Low-income-level stu
dents and students whose pa
rents have not attended college
are given priority, said Program
Director Gene Matthews.
Program participants Alberto
Garcia, Enrique Montana, and
An Khieu spoke enthusiastically
about Upward Bound ex
periences over lunch at Wilbur.
Garcia noted that minorities
have an important need for bet
ter access to higher education:
"When we do get education, we
will become more self-suffi
cient," he explained.

Garcia added confidently that
he plans to earn an AB in politi
cal science and attend law
school. "In this program, you
don't just get input, you get out
put," he said.
The program's staff assists stu
dents with the transition from
high school to college by work
ing with college admission of
ficers and financial aid per
sonnel.
The most important device for
easing this transition is the Sum
mer Bridge program, said Mat
thews. "Bridgers" are program
members who have just com
pleted high school. They take
college level courses at Foothill
while participating in the non
academic activities offered dur
ing the summer session.
In addition to the eight
"Bridgers," eight high school
students also take college
courses at Foothill, getting a
head start on fulfilling college
requirements. Most students,
however, take Upward Bound
courses in the academic areas of
reading, writing, mathematics,
business, and science. These are
enrichment-type classes, prepar
ing students for subjects they
will take this fall. These courses
familiarize students with materi
al, teaching the "language" of
the subject.
Education Prof. Nel Noddings,
a Master Teacher for the Upward
Bound mathematics program,
teaches students to "read math
talk." Problem-solving ability,
performances on standardized
tests, and in-class communica
tion are other areas she seeks to
improve in her Algebra Problem
Solving class. She described the

youths as "highly motivated"
and "doing very well" thus far,
but said they are still too quiet in
class.
Noddings' role in the program
is unique in several ways. She is
the only University professor in
volved — instructors come from
diverse areas — and her volun
tary participation serves a dual
purpose.
The residential period offers
more than academics. Matthews
described the six weeks as a
chance to "deal with the total
personality" of the student.
Through recreation and work
experience programs, time man
agement and career planning
workshops, and study skill de
velopment students gain the
preparation and motivation nec
essary to succeed in the college
environment.
Students felt the time here is
an enjoyable way to spend their
summer and, as Montana
pointed out, his familiarity with
college life will help him func
tion as a college freshman.
Students adhere to a basic rou
tine each weekday: 30 students
commute and 50 students live on
campus,- returning home on
weekends. Their day begins with
two 90-minute classes, followed
by lunch, three hours of work
experience, dinner, a two-hour
study session and, finally, recrea
tion.
Courses in a broad range of
subjects consume morning
hours, and 50 of the 82 students
spend afternoons working. Jobs

in the Stanford area are made
available through the Summer
Youth Employment Program
(SYEP), which coordinates with
Upward Bound to provide work
experience.
Students have 90 minutes of
assigned homework each night,
and are required to attend an
evening study session of the
same length where available
tutors help with assigned work.
Although the participants
generally describe study time as
necessary and helpful, they also
seem to enjoy their work. "Stu
dying time is a chance to have a
lot of fun," explained Khiau.
Montana added, however, that
his trigonometry assigments
often require more than the pre
scribed time. Comparing his
class to high school math, he said
his instructor "covers two
months material in two weeks."
The course will allow him to
complete one year of high
school math this summer.
Although the college classes
are difficult, the students appear
to meet the challenge. Montana
said he's "doing pretty good" in
math; his friend Garcia, a stu
dent at Foothill, added, "going
to Foothill, you get more inde
pendent."
Overall, students spoke favor
ably of Upward Bound courses
and instructors, highlighting the
small class size and personal at
tention. Although class size var
ies, "the class size is not as im
portant as the student-teacher
ratio; the highest is eight to

one," Matthews said.
An optional recreation period
follows the study session each
evening. Phil Baca, a recent Stan
ford graduate, directs the recre
ation progam. This is his first
summer at the Stanford Upward
Bound, although its his third
year of involvement in what he
feels is a valuable program. His
only criticism of the program is
that it is limited in size and geo
graphical area. He lives with stu
dents in Kairos, and is presently
preparing the youth for athletic
competition at the Upward
Bound Games — a three-day
event to be held at UC-Davis this
weekend.
The games include competi
tion in various individual and
team sports as well as a "Prep
Bowl," an academic competition
in mathematics, English, science,
and social science.
Matthews felt the games are
valuable in keeping students
motivated throughout their six
weeks at the University. The
competition involves approx
imately 700 Upward Bounders,
and gives participants a chance
to see another college campus.
However, given the current
budget-cutting mood of the
government, the program may
not be so successful with the leg
islators responsible for funding
it. The future of the program,
however, is uncertain. Presently,
the Department of Education,
SYEP, and private donors fund
the program.
