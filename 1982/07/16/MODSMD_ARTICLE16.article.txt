# Israeli invasion evokes differing reactions
## Israeli sees opportunities for Middle Eastern peace 
### David Skidmore 
Shi Feldman is an optimist. De
spite the death and destruction
brought on by the Israeli in
vasion of Lebanon, Feldman, a
visiting Israeli scholar, maintains
hope that new opportunities
created by this current situation
may bring peace between Israel
and the Palestinians.
Feldman, on leave from the
Center for Strategic Studies in
Tel Aviv and currently associated
with the Stanford Arms Control
and Disarmament Program, is a
self-described "dove" within Is
raeli circles. He opposed the Be
gin government's decision to ex
pand Israeli military objectives
from clearing the PLO out of a
25-mile zone along the Israeli
border in Southern Lebanon to
the more ambitious goal of liqui
dating the PLO's "infrastruc
ture" in all of Lebanon.
However, Feldman now fore
sees new contingencies arising
from these events which could
finally bring Arabs and Israelis to
the bargaining table. The in
vasion, according to Feldman,
will strengthen the position of
moderates within Israel, the PLO
and the Arab states.
The first step of this scenario
would involve a significant shift
in the PLO's political strategy.
Feldman said, "We don't know
much about the internal
dynamics of the PLO." Yet
Feldman asserts that five factors
have created a situation of
"fluidity" which may work to
strengthen moderates within the
PLO and the Arab world in gen
eral.
"First, the PLO is now militarily
weak. A political course may ap
pear more attractive. Second,
the PLO needs a new conceptual
strategy. The old strategy was to
create havoc and draw other
Arab states into military confron
tation with Israel. That failed.
The other Arab states did not re
spond. Third, Syria has been
weakened militarily. Thus the

moderate Arab states are
strengthened in the Middle East
and Egypt is regaining its in
fluence among Arabs. Fourth,
the Syrians have been disap
pointed with the Soviet sup
port."
Feldman hopes that the Egyp
tian precedent may reoccur in
the case of Syria. After losing to
Israel in 1973, Egypt threw out
Soviet advisers and turned to the
United States. "Fifth, Iran has de
feated Iraq and is a threat to oth
er Arab states, particularly Saudi
Arabia. Thus the Saudis will at
tempt to forge Arab unity be
hind their own moderate leader
ship."
Doves in Israel, Feldman said,
recognize that these new op
portunities could lead to Arab
moderation and a re-invigorated
peace process involving PLO
participation. Any such develop
ment, however, is likely to pro
duce fierce debate in Israel.
Feldman feels a moderation of
PLO policy must include accep
tance of three principles estab
lished by the United States as
preconditions for dealing direct
ly with the PLO. These include
recognizing Israel's right to exist,
ending terrorism, and accepting
the possibility of some kind of
Palestinian autonomy which in
cludes the West Bank and Gaza
Strip but not Israel proper.
If the PLO accepted these con
ditions, Feldman said pressure
from the United States and Egypt
as well as internal public opinion
would force the Israeli govern
ment to enter into direct nego
tiations with the PLO over the is
sue of Palestinian self-de
termination. This scenario,
Feldman asserted, remains
plausible even if, in the near
future, Israel goes ahead with
plans for establishing a state of
limited autonomy on the West
Bank and the Gaza Strip which
falls far short of Palestinian de
mands. "Limited autonomy may
just be interim, but the PLO may
be brought into long-run nego
tiations which is what matters."
Feldman feels that one prob
lem, which helped lead to the in
vasion, is that "Israel has the per
ception that there is no one to
talk to about peace." In support
of this claim Feldman cited the
PLO's refusal to recognize Is
rael's right to exist and the un
willingness of the radical Arab
states to accept the moderate
Fahd plan submitted months ago
by Saudi Arabia as a basis for ne
gotiations. However, it should
be noted that the Begin govern
ment also vigorously rejected
the Fahd plan.
Regarding the Palestinian is
sue, Feldman asserted that
among the Israeli public "20 per
cent are doves, 20 percent are
hawks, while 60 percent are in
between and shift according to
political circumstances." As long
as Israel feels isolated and threat
ened, Feldman believes, the ma
jority of the public will side with
the hawks. However, Feldman
offered evidence that most Is
raelis are willing to be flexible if
they see opportunities for
peace.
For example, he said Israel has
seen dramatic shifts in opinion in
the past. "Before Sadat's visit to

Israel, a large majority of Israelis
opposed turning the Sinai over
to Egypt." Currently, however,
polls show most Israelis approve
of the recent return of the Sinai
to Egypt. He noted that "the
public was divided before the in
vasion about Lebanon." This
forced Begin to postpone his
plans for many months. Only
PLO shelling of Northern Israel
in early June galvanized public
support behind Begin's plans for
eliminating the PLO threat, ac
cording to Feldman.
Feldman said the govern
ment's decision to expand Israeli
war aims and push on to Beirut
has led to erosion of support for
the war. According to the Dahaf
Research Institute, 83 percent of
Israelis continue to approve of
the invasion, but 68 percent op
pose a final push into West
Beirut. Referring to a rally or
ganized by "Peace Now" which
attracted 80,000 people to Tel
Aviv in opposition to Begin's
handling of the crisis, Feldman
noted that "this is the first time
we have had that kind of opposi
tion during war." Newspaper re
ports even indicate some disaf
fection among Israeli troops, in
cluding instances of Israeli pilots
refusing to bomb heavily popu
lated sections of West Beirut.
For these reasons, Feldman

argues that once the current mil
itary crisis is resolved, peace ov
ertures by moderate Arabs
might fall on a receptive Israeli
audience. In the near future,
Feldman believes that where the
PLO relocates after leaving Leba
non "depends on the PLO's po
litical orientation."
If the PLO ends up in Syria or
some other radical Arab state,
Feldman predicts they will con
tinue to follow a radical course,
thus decreasing the chances of a
settlement. So far, however, Syr
ia has rejected the possibility of
accepting the PLO.
Feldman said a key concern is
"whether Washington recog
nizes the current fluidity in the
Arab world and tries to restruc
ture the situation. Feldman was
surprised by America's mild re
sponse to the Israeli invasion but
he believes "the moderate
American policy has paid off,"
by leaving the United States
enough leverage over Israel to
forestall a final Israeli push into
West Beirut. He feels, however,
that Secretary of State Alexander
Haig's resignation "did not
help" the situation.
Feldman has a complex vision
of the route to peace. Many con
tingencies must fall into place if
such a scenario were to become
reality.
