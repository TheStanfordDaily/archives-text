# Israeli invasion evokes differing reactions
## Israeli sees opportunities for Middle Eastern peace 
### David Skidmore 
Shi Feldman is an optimist. De
spite the death and destruction
brought on by the Israeli in
vasion of Lebanon, Feldman, a
visiting Israeli scholar, maintains
hope that new opportunities
created by this current situation
may bring peace between Israel
and the Palestinians.
Feldman, on leave from the
Center for Strategic Studies in
Tel Aviv and currently associated
with the Stanford Arms Control
and Disarmament Program, is a
self-described "dove" within Is
raeli circles. He opposed the Be
gin government's decision to ex
pand Israeli military objectives
from clearing the PLO out of a
25-mile zone along the Israeli
border in Southern Lebanon to
the more ambitious goal of liqui
dating the PLO's "infrastruc
ture" in all of Lebanon.
However, Feldman now fore
sees new contingencies arising
from these events which could
finally bring Arabs and Israelis to
the bargaining table. The in
vasion, according to Feldman,
will strengthen the position of
moderates within Israel, the PLO
and the Arab states.
The first step of this scenario
would involve a significant shift
in the PLO's political strategy.
Feldman said, "We don't know
much about the internal
dynamics of the PLO." Yet
Feldman asserts that five factors
have created a situation of
"fluidity" which may work to
strengthen moderates within the
PLO and the Arab world in gen
eral.
"First, the PLO is now militarily
weak. A political course may ap
pear more attractive. Second,
the PLO needs a new conceptual
strategy. The old strategy was to
create havoc and draw other
Arab states into military confron
tation with Israel. That failed.
The other Arab states did not re
spond. Third, Syria has been
weakened militarily. Thus the

moderate Arab states are
strengthened in the Middle East
and Egypt is regaining its in
fluence among Arabs. Fourth,
the Syrians have been disap
pointed with the Soviet sup
port."
Feldman hopes that the Egyp
tian precedent may reoccur in
the case of Syria. After losing to
Israel in 1973, Egypt threw out
Soviet advisers and turned to the
United States. "Fifth, Iran has de
feated Iraq and is a threat to oth
er Arab states, particularly Saudi
Arabia. Thus the Saudis will at
tempt to forge Arab unity be
hind their own moderate leader
ship."
Doves in Israel, Feldman said,
recognize that these new op
portunities could lead to Arab
moderation and a re-invigorated
peace process involving PLO
participation. Any such develop
ment, however, is likely to pro
duce fierce debate in Israel.
Feldman feels a moderation of
PLO policy must include accep
tance of three principles estab
lished by the United States as
preconditions for dealing direct
ly with the PLO. These include
recognizing Israel's right to exist,
ending terrorism, and accepting
the possibility of some kind of
Palestinian autonomy which in
cludes the West Bank and Gaza
Strip but not Israel proper.
If the PLO accepted these con
ditions, Feldman said pressure
from the United States and Egypt
as well as internal public opinion
would force the Israeli govern
ment to enter into direct nego
tiations with the PLO over the is
sue of Palestinian self-de
termination. This scenario,
Feldman asserted, remains
plausible even if, in the near
future, Israel goes ahead with
plans for establishing a state of
limited autonomy on the West
Bank and the Gaza Strip which
falls far short of Palestinian de
mands. "Limited autonomy may
