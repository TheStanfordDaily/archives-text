# Palestinian doubts peace prospects

### David Skidmore 
Maher Hashweh, a Palestinian Ph.D. student
here, does not share Shi Feldman's optimism.
His mind is absorbed with concern over the cur
rent suffering of his people and his thoughts of
the future are anything but sanguine. Con
fronted with the notion that Israel and the PLO
might move toward compromise and concilia
tion as a result of the crisis in Lebanon, Hashweh
sadly replied, "I wish I could believe it."
Hashweh was born in East Jerusalem. He at
tended American University in Beirut as well as
Berzeit University on the West Bank. (Berzeit
was recently closed for three months by Israeli
authorities after student protests against Israel's
West Bank policies.) He is currently a Ph.D. stu
dent in education.
Hashweh asserted that Israel "wants to get rid
of the PLO." This goal "ties into Israel's West
Bank policies," he said, in reference to the re
cent Israeli crackdown on Palestinian na
tionalism on the West Bank.
In addition to the introduction of many Israeli
settlements in the West Bank in recent years, Is
rael has recently fired six West Bank mayors, ar
rested protesters, and closed certain schools. Is
rael has, in some cities, given leadership posts to
members of the Village League, a small group of
pro-Israel Palestinians who have recently en
gaged in violent clashes with Palestinian na
tionalists. Many Palestinians fear that these
moves are first steps toward formal Israeli an
nexation of the West Bank.
Hashweh speculated that Israel and perhaps
even some American officials feel that the "only
obstacle to implementing Camp David is the
PLO." Hashweh contends that Israel intends to
offer only token concessions to Palestinian au
tonomy through the Camp David accords as a
way of diffusing the Palestinian issue. For this to
succeed, Hashweh said, Israel must crush the
leadership capacity of the PLO. Other critics of
the Camp David Accords, such as Eric Davis, vis
iting Hoover Fellow, have echoed similar
themes. Davis, a political scientist from Rutgers,
recently told a group of Arab-Americans that
the neutralization of Egypt through the Camp
David Accords gave Israel assurance that its in
vasion of Lebanon would not provoke a unified
Arab military response.
Concerning the current deadlock in nego
, tiations, Hashweh noted that the PLO, a delicate
coalition of many groups, has decided to hold
out for more favorable terms because "many
factions must be given some hope or con
cessions or they will stay and fight." One such
concession PLO leaders apparently seek is
American recognition.
Hashweh expressed concern about the fate

of an estimated 500,000 Palestinian refugees
who will be left in Lebanon even after the PLO
leadership and troops leave. Noting that the
PLO has set up hospitals, schools, orphanages,
factories, and research institutions to serve the
Palestinian population, Hashweh wonders
"what will happen to the institutions set up by
the PLO? What kind of protection do we have
that the Phalangists won't massacre Palestinian
refugees?"
Hashweh charged that the Christian
Phalangists, long at odds with the Palestinians as
well as Lebanese Moslems, joined with Syria to
massacre Palestinian civilians at the refugee
camps of Karantena and Tal Ezz' tar in the 1976
Lebanese civil war. Palestinian fears have risen
in response to reports by David Shipler of the
New York Times indicating that the Israelis are
levelling refugee homes in the Palestinian refu
gee camps of Burjal-Shemdi, Rashidye, and Ein
Khilweh in Southern Lebanon.

Hashweh contends that Israel
intends to offer only token
concessions to Palestinian
autonomy through the Camp
David accords as a way of
diffusing the Palestinian issue.

About America's role in the Middle East,
Hashweh stated, "I am very bitter about U.S.
policies now ... There is a big phobia of the
Russians but no consideration for human rights
... We have a history of suppression by the
West but not by the Soviets." Hashweh con
tends that some U.S. officials both knew about
and approved of the Israeli invasion.
The weak Arab response to the Israeli in
vasion has also disappointed Hashweh, who
thinks most Arab states were "caught with their
pants down; especially Syria." He also suspects,
however, that some Arab leaders may have se
cretly welcomed the Israeli attacks on the PLO
due to rivalries with Arafat and other PLO lead
ers. He said, "PLO leaders have tried to avoid
being puppets of other Arab regimes."
Hashweh said, "I cannot accept Zionism for
what it has done to my people. When Israelis
admit that the Palestinians have some national
right then we can talk." He believes that ihe
"big majority of Palestinians would accept a
state on the West Bank." Hashweh said the PLO
considers recognition of Israel a key bargaining
chip which can only be given in re-
turn for concrete con
cessions. Israel and the Unit
ed States, by contrast, see
PLO recognition of Israel's
right to exist as a precondi
tion for negotiations.
As proof of Arab flexibility,
Hashweh argues that "all
Arab states have accepted
U.N. resolution 242 which im
plicitly recognizes Israel
while the Fahd plan (put for
ward by Saudi Arabia) ex
plicitly calls for recognition of
Israel."
Hashweh dismisses Israeli
fears of a neighboring Palesti
nian state. "A West Bank state
would be too economically
dependent on both Israel and
Jordan and militarily weak to
pose a threat to Israel."
Hashweh is encouraged by

the Peace Now movement in
Israel which has criticized the
Israeli invasion of Lebanon
and called for greater con
ciliation toward the Palesti
nians. Hashweh "places hope
in dialogue." Yet he is
pessimistic about the short
term possibilities for change
in Israeli public opinion. "It is
not only the Right in Israel
which is against a solution ac
ceptable to the Palestinians.
The Labor Party is not any bet
ter."
Hashweh allows himself
only a vague hope for the dis
tant future. "There will be no
solution until it is recognized
that we as a people have
rights to our land. This may
set us back 10 to 15 years but
you cannot suppress a nation
of people forever."

moves are first steps toward formal Israeli an
nexation of the West Bank.
Hashweh speculated that Israel and perhaps
even some American officials feel that the "only
obstacle to implementing Camp David is the
PLO." Hashweh contends that Israel intends to
offer only token concessions to Palestinian au
tonomy through the Camp David accords as a
way of diffusing the Palestinian issue. For this to
succeed, Hashweh said, Israel must crush the
leadership capacity of the PLO. Other critics of
the Camp David Accords, such as Eric Davis, vis
iting Hoover Fellow, have echoed similar
themes. Davis, a political scientist from Rutgers,
recently told a group of Arab-Americans that
the neutralization of Egypt through the Camp
David Accords gave Israel assurance that its in
vasion of Lebanon would not provoke a unified
Arab military response.
Concerning the current deadlock in nego
, tiations, Hashweh noted that the PLO, a delicate
coalition of many groups, has decided to hold
out for more favorable terms because "many
factions must be given some hope or con
cessions or they will stay and fight." One such
concession PLO leaders apparently seek is
American recognition.
Hashweh expressed concern about the fate

of an estimated 500,000 Palestinian refugees
who will be left in Lebanon even after the PLO
leadership and troops leave. Noting that the
PLO has set up hospitals, schools, orphanages,
factories, and research institutions to serve the
Palestinian population, Hashweh wonders
"what will happen to the institutions set up by
the PLO? What kind of protection do we have
that the Phalangists won't massacre Palestinian
refugees?"
Hashweh charged that the Christian
Phalangists, long at odds with the Palestinians as
well as Lebanese Moslems, joined with Syria to
massacre Palestinian civilians at the refugee
camps of Karantena and Tal Ezz' tar in the 1976
Lebanese civil war. Palestinian fears have risen
in response to reports by David Shipler of the
New York Times indicating that the Israelis are
levelling refugee homes in the Palestinian refu
gee camps of Burjal-Shemdi, Rashidye, and Ein
Khilweh in Southern Lebanon.

Hashweh contends that Israel
intends to offer only token
concessions to Palestinian
autonomy through the Camp
David accords as a way of
diffusing the Palestinian issue.

About America's role in the Middle East,
Hashweh stated, "I am very bitter about U.S.
policies now ... There is a big phobia of the
Russians but no consideration for human rights
... We have a history of suppression by the
West but not by the Soviets." Hashweh con
tends that some U.S. officials both knew about
and approved of the Israeli invasion.
The weak Arab response to the Israeli in
vasion has also disappointed Hashweh, who
thinks most Arab states were "caught with their
pants down; especially Syria." He also suspects,
however, that some Arab leaders may have se
cretly welcomed the Israeli attacks on the PLO
due to rivalries with Arafat and other PLO lead
ers. He said, "PLO leaders have tried to avoid
being puppets of other Arab regimes."
Hashweh said, "I cannot accept Zionism for
what it has done to my people. When Israelis
admit that the Palestinians have some national
right then we can talk." He believes that ihe
"big majority of Palestinians would accept a
state on the West Bank." Hashweh said the PLO
considers recognition of Israel a key bargaining
chip which can only be given in re-
turn for concrete con
cessions. Israel and the Unit
ed States, by contrast, see
PLO recognition of Israel's
right to exist as a precondi
tion for negotiations.
As proof of Arab flexibility,
Hashweh argues that "all
Arab states have accepted
U.N. resolution 242 which im
plicitly recognizes Israel
while the Fahd plan (put for
ward by Saudi Arabia) ex
plicitly calls for recognition of
Israel."
Hashweh dismisses Israeli
fears of a neighboring Palesti
nian state. "A West Bank state
would be too economically
dependent on both Israel and
Jordan and militarily weak to
pose a threat to Israel."
Hashweh is encouraged by

the Peace Now movement in
Israel which has criticized the
Israeli invasion of Lebanon
and called for greater con
ciliation toward the Palesti
nians. Hashweh "places hope
in dialogue." Yet he is
pessimistic about the short
term possibilities for change
in Israeli public opinion. "It is
not only the Right in Israel
which is against a solution ac
ceptable to the Palestinians.
The Labor Party is not any bet
ter."
Hashweh allows himself
only a vague hope for the dis
tant future. "There will be no
solution until it is recognized
that we as a people have
rights to our land. This may
set us back 10 to 15 years but
you cannot suppress a nation
of people forever."
Maher Hashweh, a Palestinian Ph.D. student
here, does not share Shi Feldman's optimism.
His mind is absorbed with concern over the cur
rent suffering of his people and his thoughts of
the future are anything but sanguine. Con
fronted with the notion that Israel and the PLO
might move toward compromise and concilia
tion as a result of the crisis in Lebanon, Hashweh
sadly replied, "I wish I could believe it."
Hashweh was born in East Jerusalem. He at
tended American University in Beirut as well as
Berzeit University on the West Bank. (Berzeit
was recently closed for three months by Israeli
authorities after student protests against Israel's
West Bank policies.) He is currently a Ph.D. stu
dent in education.
Hashweh asserted that Israel "wants to get rid
of the PLO." This goal "ties into Israel's West
Bank policies," he said, in reference to the re
cent Israeli crackdown on Palestinian na
tionalism on the West Bank.
In addition to the introduction of many Israeli
settlements in the West Bank in recent years, Is
rael has recently fired six West Bank mayors, ar
rested protesters, and closed certain schools. Is
rael has, in some cities, given leadership posts to
members of the Village League, a small group of
pro-Israel Palestinians who have recently en
gaged in violent clashes with Palestinian na
tionalists. Many Palestinians fear that these
moves are first steps toward formal Israeli an
nexation of the West Bank.
Hashweh speculated that Israel and perhaps
even some American officials feel that the "only
obstacle to implementing Camp David is the
