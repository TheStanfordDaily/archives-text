Festival Cinema, Palo Alto
The Monty Python people
bring you something completely
different: a funny, by turns
charming and cynical fantasy
about a boy who inadvertently
gets caught up with the exploits
of six dwarfs who're out to
plunder the greatest treasures of
all time.The camera seldom raises
higher than about four-foot-one,
and maybe the air is richer down
there — this movie is faster and
more clever than any of the re
cent American fantasies popu
lated entirely by six-footers.
Double-billed with George
Pal's adaptation of The War of the
Worlds.

Gregory's Girl ★★★
Aquarius, Palo Alto
This Scottish movie about a
high school boy's misadventures
with girls is clumsily made, but
even the messed-up story and ed
iting can't detract from Gregory's
Girl's wit and charm. It features
great ensemble acting from a cast
composed almost entirely of
teenagers. There are half-a
dozen memorable per
formances, but the best is by
Gordon John Sinclair as Gregory,
who manages to merge style and
nerdishness with a facility that's
endearing and enviable. Bill For
syth wrote and directed.

E.T. — The Extraterrestrial
E.T. begins where Steven
Spielberg's Close Encounters
peaked — with the descent of an

alien craft — and gets better and
better from there. It's an
absolutely entrancing movie — a
miracle. This tale of a benevolent,
childlike alien's adventure on
earth doesn't contain a moment
of cruelty (though there is a great
deal of suspense), and Spielberg's
vision is so overwhelming that he
makes it difficult to conceive of
cruelty while watching the
film. The director uses film
maker's magic to tap into our
feelings, and the result is a movie
of extraordinary emotional
power.
— Steve Vineberg
Poltergeist ★★
Park Theater, Menlo Park
This movie is terribly efficient
— it gets to you — but I didn't
have much fun at it. I felt bar
raged by all the closeups and the
Dolby sound from the beginning,
long before the ghosts took over.
The film is so loud and relentless
throughout that it doesn't have
anywhere to go but straight to its
rather ludicrous big finish, with
ske'etons popping up all over the
neighborhood and houses flam
ing and folding. The film's main
bright spots come not through
the special effects but through
the actors. Jobeth Williams is
touchingly earnest as the per
sistent, loving mother, and Zelda
Rubenstein brings such an un
usual, quicksilver charm to her
role of medium-for-hire that she

nearly redeems the most self-se
rious scenes.

A Clockwork Orange
New Varsity, Palo Alto
Stanley Kubrick directed this
violent, upsetting movie right af
ter he made 2001, and it seems as
if he tried to turn everything he
did there inside out. From Arthur
Clarke's dreamy, leisurely view of
a giant leap into the future, he
turned to Anthony Burgess'
world where future shock is a giv
en and where anything that gets
you through the day is better
than boredom. Malcom
McDowell is the "protagonist" —
he's so violent that his society has
to use violent therapy to calm
him down, and its not clear which
one is more reprehensible. The
movie is garish and ugly — the
audience is being assaulted, too,
and our responses are being ma
nipulated as much as McDowell's
character's are. It's either a great
movie or a very terrible one — it
may be both.
Double-billed next Tuesday
and Wednesday with Per
formance, which features Mick
Jagger and was directed by Nich
olas Roeg.

Dennis Christopher plays a

curiously aimless (and therefore
strikingly American) quest. Es

goal. While we're watching this

Young Frankenstein ★★★★
Tonight, Cubberley Auditorium
Mel Brooks directed this
faithful sendup of Mary Shelley's
tale of a man who dares to play
God. Young Frankenstein is
probably the best Brooks movie
— there's a trace of real affection
here, something I've never
before or since detected in the
director's work. The Mel Brooks
Repertory Players are all in fine
form. Gene Wilder stars as the
Frankenstein heir who creates a
monster that looks alarmingly
like Peter Boyle. Cloris Leachman
plays Frau Blucher, a woman
whose very name causes panic in
the streets. And the ever-present
Madelaine Kahn portrays a nice
girl who learns to love life and

Rescheduled from last Friday.

My Fair Lady ★★★
Fox, Redwood City
George Cukor directed this
rather stodgy film adaptation of
the Lerner and Loewe musical.
Though it's not a great movie, the
play and the music are so appeal
ing that they more than outweigh
any weaknesses in direction and
pacing. As nearly everyone
knows, My Fair Lady is based on
the Shaw play, "Pygmalian" (or,
more accurately, it's based on the
screenplay Shaw worked up for
the 1938 movie version). Rex Har
rison, recreating his stage role,
plays linguistics expert Henry
Higgins; Audrey Hepburn plays
the dialectically underpriveleged
Eliza Doolittle. Lerner and Loewe
supplied the tunes: "I Could
Have Danced All Night," "On the
Street Where You Live," "I've
Grown Accustomed to Her
Face," and many others.
! Plays Sunday with Came/ot.

Gregory's Girl ★★★
Aquarius, Palo Alto
This Scottish movie about a
high school boy's misadventures
with girls is clumsily made, but
even the messed-up story and ed
iting can't detract from Gregory's
Girl's wit and charm. It features
great ensemble acting from a cast
composed almost entirely of
teenagers. There are half-a
dozen memorable per
formances, but the best is by
Gordon John Sinclair as Gregory,
who manages to merge style and
nerdishness with a facility that's
endearing and enviable. Bill For
syth wrote and directed.

E.T. — The Extraterrestrial
E.T. begins where Steven
Spielberg's Close Encounters
peaked — with the descent of an

alien craft — and gets better and
better from there. It's an
absolutely entrancing movie — a
miracle. This tale of a benevolent,
childlike alien's adventure on
earth doesn't contain a moment
of cruelty (though there is a great
deal of suspense), and Spielberg's
vision is so overwhelming that he
makes it difficult to conceive of
cruelty while watching the
film. The director uses film
maker's magic to tap into our
feelings, and the result is a movie
of extraordinary emotional
power.
— Steve Vineberg
Poltergeist ★★
Park Theater, Menlo Park
This movie is terribly efficient
— it gets to you — but I didn't
have much fun at it. I felt bar
raged by all the closeups and the
Dolby sound from the beginning,
long before the ghosts took over.
The film is so loud and relentless
throughout that it doesn't have
anywhere to go but straight to its
rather ludicrous big finish, with
ske'etons popping up all over the
neighborhood and houses flam
ing and folding. The film's main
bright spots come not through
the special effects but through
the actors. Jobeth Williams is
touchingly earnest as the per
sistent, loving mother, and Zelda
Rubenstein brings such an un
usual, quicksilver charm to her
role of medium-for-hire that she

nearly redeems the most self-se
rious scenes.

A Clockwork Orange
New Varsity, Palo Alto
Stanley Kubrick directed this
violent, upsetting movie right af
ter he made 2001, and it seems as
if he tried to turn everything he
did there inside out. From Arthur
Clarke's dreamy, leisurely view of
a giant leap into the future, he
turned to Anthony Burgess'
world where future shock is a giv
en and where anything that gets
you through the day is better
than boredom. Malcom
McDowell is the "protagonist" —
he's so violent that his society has
to use violent therapy to calm
him down, and its not clear which
one is more reprehensible. The
movie is garish and ugly — the
audience is being assaulted, too,
and our responses are being ma
nipulated as much as McDowell's
character's are. It's either a great
movie or a very terrible one — it
may be both.
Double-billed next Tuesday
and Wednesday with Per

Breaking Away ★★★
New Varsity, Palo Alto
A movie this good natured is
sure to cause cancer if seen too
often or praised too highly. But,
in limited doses, Breaking Away
can be invigorating — once in a

that everything can turn out all
right in the end.
Dennis Christopher plays a
high school student who at
tempts to bicycle his way out of
the lower middle class. His is a
curiously aimless (and therefore
strikingly American) quest. Es
cape, and nothing more, is his
goal. While we're watching this
movie, at least, that may be all the
goal that anyone needs.
Plays Saturday and Sunday
