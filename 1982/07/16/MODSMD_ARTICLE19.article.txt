## Text versus texture, two falls out of three... 'Star Trek II: The Wrath of Khan' 
### 
The chief pleasure audiences
derive from watching a TV series
regularly is in growing close to
the characters and getting to see
them develop. If the show has a
team of smart writers, they'll find
imaginative ways of testing the
characters — and the actors;
those of us who adore
for example, may feel, after lit
erally hundreds of episodes, a
warmth toward the members of
that unit that is reserved for dear

friends. Star Trek first aired near
ly two decades ago, and when
you catch a first glimpse of the
crew of the Starship Enterprise in
Star Trek II: The Wrath of Khan,
they look considerably older
than you remember them (espe
cially if, like myself, you took the
advice of friends and skipped
the last Star Trek movie): Uhura
(Nichelle Nichols) and Chekov
(Walter Koenig) have a number
of unfamiliar creases, and Scotty
(James Doohan) has a fuller
build and more authority. As for
Captain — now Admiral — Kirk
(William Shatner), he has a pair
of eyeglasses. Harve Bennett and
Jack Sowards, who wrote the
story (the script is Sowards'),
have wisely built the fact of the
actors' aging into the narrative,
which is about death and re
generation.
As the film begins, Kirk is
about to surrender command of
the Enterprise to an attractive
young Vulcan female, Saavik
(Kirstie Alley), who looks like a
pointy-eared Gilda Radner. His
voluntary retirement has made
him feel old; what revives him is
a crisis forcing him back to the
helm. One of the ship's satellites,

on an exploratory mission, en
counters an old adversary oi
Kirk's, Khan (Ricardo Mon
talban), a criminal exiled by Kirk
to a planet since deteriorated,
who has vowed revenge. (An
episode of the TV series in
troduced Khan, a time-frozen
human of unusual physical and
mental strength who captains a
crew of loyal outlaws.) Khan's
first move, once he has over
taken the satellite, is to raid a
space research hospital and steal
its top secret project, Genesis,
which has harnessed energy in
order to create new matter. The
doctor in charge of Genesis,
Carol Marcus (Bibi Besch), is a
one-time lover of Kirk's — and
her assistant, David (Merritt

Butrick), is their son, whom he
has never seen.
Sowards' script is full of reso
nant ideas. In the first scene, Kirk
administers a standard un
solvable examination situation
to Saavik as a test of character;
later we learn that, as a fledgling
commander, he "solved" the
problem himself by restructur
ing the data provided for it —
thereby, as Saavik puts it, "cheat

ing death." Anyone who has
watched Star Trek on television
knows that Kirk, with the aid of
the show's writers, has made a
career of cheating death, but in
the course of his rematch with
Khan, he is compelled to face
real loss for the first time — to
grieve for a friend whom he can
not save — and it revitalizes him.
It seems to work the same trick
on William Shatner, too. In the
second half of the film he is giv
en three or four scenes that re
quire the kind of genuine emo
tion no one (to my knowledge)
has ever seen from Shatner, and
the director, Nicholas Meyer, al
lows him no escape: the camera
is trained on his face. And by
God, he really does act — as if
the expanded size of the screen
left him no choice but to deepen
his performance accordingly.
Meyer's first picture, Time Af
ter Time, was a disappointment:
it had a terrific plot idea — H. G.
Wells chasing Jack the Ripper
into the late 20th century
through Wells' time machine —
but it became diffused along the
way, and Meyer didn't show the
kind of visual sense demanded
by a fantasy, or much of an edi
tor's sense, either. He has im
proved. There is no real beauty
in The Wrath of Khan — the
Eden spawned by Genesis is a bit
kitschy, like a Polynesian restau
rant in 70 mm — but he arranges
the eye-popping special effects
with the skill of a master comic
strip director, and the editor,
William P. Dornisch, keeps the
show moving at an exciting clip.
It's a witty, spirited adventure.
(The books in the monomaniac
Khan's cabin include Moby
Dick, The Tempest and Paradise
Lost.) Furthermore, Meyer
brings the sort of talent he did
exhibit in Time After Time to The
Wrath of Khan: he works won
ders with some of the actors. I
felt the same reserve about

Leonard Nimoy's Spock I've
always had, but I can't re
member when I've enjoyed
Walter Koenig so much, or
James Doohan, and anyone who
can coax a performance out of
William Shatner really should be
directing movies. Another sur
prise is Ricardo Montalban,
who, Looking like a cross be
tween a pirate and a middle
aged hippie, approaches the
role of Khan with all the flourish

of a glorious Shakespearean
ham. It's only the second time
I've seen himenjoy acting(oren
joyed watching him act) — the
first was in a staged reading of
Shaw's Don Juan in Hell in Bos
ton about 10 years ago, when he
tore into Don Juan's speeches
with the delight of a performer
who's been waiting tedious sea
sons for a part to set him loose.
I was sorry that Sowards and
