The postponement of the
ASSU fee assessment constitu
tional amendment by University
President Donald Kennedy and
Dean of Student Affairs James
Lyons dominated discussion at
the ASSU Senate meeting Tues
day night. The amendment,
which passed overwhelmingly
spring quarter, would limit fee
assessment refunds to students
who voted on the assessments.
The meeting also centered on
two ASSU proposals represent
ing large capital expenditures: a
pizzeria at the boathouse and an
ASSU computer system.
According to Roc Blumenthal,
acting senate chair, Kennedy
and Lyons expressed concern
that "certain aspects of the As
sociation Fee were undefined
and ... that students did not un
derstand what they vcted on."
Council of Presidents (COP)
member Mark Epstein said,
"they were worried that the stu
dents would not be able to get a
refund or validate the Associa
tion fee (which would .combine
the Publications Board, Program

Fee, and Academic? Organiza
tions Board) by vote.
The Association Fee approved
by students in last spring's elec
tions would be a $3-a-quarter
fee automatically placed on each
student's permit to register. The
fee would insure funding for
small programs on campus. Only
students who voted in the elec
tion would be able to get a re
fund.
The COP and Blumenthal met
with Lyons at the end of June.
"(We) attempted to satisfy the
concerns by pointing out the ap
propriate by-laws sections and
outlining the publicity given to
the issue," said Blumenthal.
Epstein said the COP told
Lyons it was "a matter between
the Association and its member
ship."
According to Epstein, the
ASSU has purchased 500 feet of
board to replace wood damaged
by dry rot at the Boathouse. The
main lounge area is also being
reconstructed, and an alarm sys
tem and outside floodlights have
been added.
By the end of the summer, the

boathouse should meet Univer
sity building specifications, Eps
tein said. The structure has been
condemned three times in the
past.
Funds now in the Boathouse
account will cover the expen
ditures this summer.
The addition of a take-out
pizzeria would "provide a per
manent source of financing for
the Boathouse," Epstein said.
Student Financial Manager
Bob Brody reported a pre
liminary estimate of $35,000 for
the facility and a delivery cart.
Informational meetings about
plans will be held next Wednes
day from 3-5 p.m. and 7-9 p.m. at
the boathouse.
Graduate senator Jim
McGrath, chairman of the fi
nance subcommittee on print
ing, reported on the computer
system being considered by the
ASSU. Information on various
systems will be gathered this
summer. Finance Committee
planning will follow in the fall.
The new system could be in op
eration as early as winter quar
ter, he said.
