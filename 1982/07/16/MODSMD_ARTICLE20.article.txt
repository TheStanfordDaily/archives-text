# Stealing shows from Mr. Tambourine Man
## 
### Mark Zeigler Grover Washington/Pieces of a Dream 
Greek Theatre/Berkeley
25 June 1982
A man, a huge man, sat a few
rows away from me in Berkeley's
starlit Greek Theatre. Under his
sprawling legs sat a red gym bag,
filled with what I guess he calls
his tools of the trade: a few extra
pieces of clothing to protect
against the sometimes cold
Berkeley night air and a tam
bourine. That's it.
On stage, not more than 100
feet away, the three-man warm
up band acknowledged the ap
plause after pounding out the
final notes of their third tune.
The trio then broke into one of
their more popular songs, fea
turing a guest vocalist. It was a
good, smooth jazz/fusion tune
with catchy lyrics called "Warm

Weather." Out came the tam
bourine.
And the man didn't retrieve
this Salvation Army percussion
relic from his red gym bag so it
could sit on his spacious lap mo
tionless. He started playing it
along with the music, displaying
his obvious experience at these
sorts of things. With each passing
measure of the song, he and his
tambourine became more and
more involved, drawing stares
from those in the immediate vi
cinity. Still, he kept playing.
A minute later, the large man
was on his feet, all six feet, four
inches and 245 pounds of him
making a better door than a win
dow for those sitting behind
him. "Down in front," they
yelled. No dice.
But the tambourine man cer
tainly had something to dance
about the way Pieces of a Dream

was playing. The youthful trio
from Philadelphia not only stole
their own show, but headliner
Grover Washington, Jr.'s as well.
The three played masterfully in
Washington's band during his
ensuing performance.
And get this. Drum

mon is 19 years old. So is bassist
Cedric Napoleon. Keyboardist
James Lloyd is what Harmon calls
the "baby of the group." He i
17. The three play with the poise
and grace of those twice their
age, like Grover, and produce
the full sound of a band twice
their size, again like Grover's.
Wow.
With connections like GW Jr.,
solid straight jazz backgrounds
and a funky bassist, the trio can't
go wrong. The famous sax
ophonist produced as well as
played on the group's first LP,
called Pieces of a Dream. He
went a step further in promoting
the trio by recruiting them as his
opening act for his 1982 summer
tour. People have in essence
been force-fed the Pieces of a
Dream commodity, but with fa
vorable results, judging by their
reception at the Greek Theatre.
Pieces of a Dream opened the
evening's festivities rather timid
ly, playing their first two songs
with an acoustic bass; they were
less than impressive. But as the
three gained confidence, their
songs blossomed into brilliant
form. Solos on their electric in
struments brought ovations and
increased audience respect.
What started as polite applause
ended in a standing O and
chants for "More, more, more."
Forget about finding their
albums in a used record store
anymore.
By the end of their set, Pieces
of a Dream had also demon
strated another of their talents â€”
versatility. The trio proved they
can play straight jazz, fusion,
funk and pop. More important
ly, they left no doubt that they
can blend these types of music
into a listenable whole, liked by
many. Of their two albums, their
first, Pieces of a Dream, is just a
bit better than their most recent
effort, although the 1982 release
shows more maturity.
But before Pieces of a Dream
steals the spotlight in this review

Grover
Washington Jr.
like they did at the Greek, some
thing should be said about the
evening's headliner, Grover
Washington, Jr. A legend in his
own time, Washington put on an
average show, in other words
brilliant. Although his albums
now appeal to more of a pop,
KFRC audience than in the mid
70's and thus contain more pop
py songs, the saxophonist has
not forgotten his past. Grover
opened the show with a bundle
of tunes from older albums.
However, as the show
progressed, Washington began
to play more of his latest LP,
Come Morning; not his best, to
put it politely. The album is slow
and boring and has no hit song
rivaling even "Just the Two of
Us" to sell it. The final three
songs were all vocal tracks,
showing that Grover is not

dumb. He knows what sells rec
ords.
Besides playing with that un
mistakeable soft, smooth style,
Washington is his same old self
in other ways. The saxophonist
has not yet succumbed to the
temptation of employing elec
tronic devices to "jazz up" his
musicor even hide mistakes, as is
quite often the case today. His
various saxes and horns are sim
ply hooked up to microphones
and Grover plays them. Nothing
more, nothing less. Washington
doesn't blow wildly into his in
strument, but soothes the lis
tener by drifting from note to
note and decreasing his volume
in between them.
Most of Grover's songs were
backed by heavy percussion,
featured two keyboardists (Lloyd
and Dexter Wansel), a bassist

and a guitarist. Washington
lengthened his songs enough so
there was room for usually two
solos, one by himself and one by
Lloyd. The latter's drew louder
applause, not necessarily be
cause they were better than the
great saxophonist's, but because
a 17-year-old kid was charming a
crowd of thousands. Lloyd's final
solo, in "Just the Two of Us," was
received by a standing ovation.
The "baby" has an amazing feel
ing for the Rhodes piano and in
corporates his straight jazz back
ground into an electric song in
much the same way as Joe Sam
ple. It was more than amazing to
see the young and the old bridge
the generation gap in such a
magical fashion.
Best of all, Lloyd is disciplined,
along with the rest of Pieces of a
Dream, and should not go the
way of a Herbie Hancock when
he gets his first taste of the big
bucks that Grover makes. That
day of reckoning is not far away,
either.
