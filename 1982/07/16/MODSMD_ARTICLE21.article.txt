# The 						Joffrey Ballet goes to a party its own

### Mary Walp 
The Joffrey Ballet is celebrat
ing its silveranniversary and they
give a great party. Interesting
people make for a good time,
and that is exactly why the Jof
frey is a great company. Unlike
so many companies which seem
to force the dancers into a mold,
Joffrey dancers allow their indi
vidual spirits to shine through,
giving their impeccable tech
nique an extra spark which turns
the choreography intoa celebra

tion.
Friday evening opened with
the dancers bursting onstage in
Gerald Arpino's Suite Saint-
Saens. Each dancer showed their
own personal joy with the danc
ing as they waltzed and leaped
through Arpino's wonderful
choreography. Cynthia An
derson dazzled the audience
with her strong work, and the
male pas de quatre was an ex
quisite demonstration of their
technique as well as their charm.

Many companies perform ne
oclassical ballets like Suite Saint-
Saens with one attitude which
prevails among the dancers. Not
the Joffrey. These dancers show
off their individuality which, al
though still working towards the
buoyant theme of the work, es
capes homogeneity by creating
interest.
An anniversary special and a
piece new to the company, Jiri
Kylian's psychological ballet
Transfigured Night, came next.
Kylian weaves the protagonists,
Ursula Burke and James Can
field, in and out of a somewhat
abstract plot which is resolved
with the couple's acceptance of
love. Burke and Canfield com
plemented each other perfectly
in both line and feeling on Fri
day, giving an emotion-packed
performance of Kylian's folk-in
fluenced ballet.
Next, Leslie Carothers saun
tered while Glenn Edgerton
slithered onstage to begin Mar
jorie Mussman's Random
Dances. Here again, the dancers'
personalities accentuated the
sparkling choreography in an
entertaining performance of a
playful neoclassic work.
Mussman's choreography is
full of jokes and laughs, from
Luis Peresz' solo entrance in a
prize fighter jog to Tom
Mussbrucker's impish refusal to
conform to the other six dan
cers' group efforts. Friday's cast
gave the ballet an exuberant,
energetic performance.

Twyla Tharp's amusing Deuce
Coupe II topped off the evening.
The women, clad in short slinky
dresses, rocked and flirted with
the tough men with slicked-back
hair. Snatches of a Beach Boys
concert back up the cool savvy
of Tharp's ballet which the Jof
frey carried off with just the right
touch of whimsy. Then, in the
midst of all this rock 'n roll, Leslie
Carothers entered and calmly
executed a series of ballet ex

ercises in a dainty white frock.
Carothers let loose for a few sec
onds when no one was looking,
but immediately reverted to her
five basic positions, creating a
funny opposition of old and
new. Ann Marie De Angelo was
especially funny as a saucy favor
ite with the boys, and the entire
cast gave a delightful finish to
the evening with Deuce Coupe.
Happy 25th, Joffrey Ballet. You
give a great party.
