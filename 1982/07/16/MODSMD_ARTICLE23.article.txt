# 'Blade Runner'

### 
Ridley Scott, the director of
Blade Runner, might learn a les
son from Nicholas Meyer. Vis
ually, Blade Runner is infinitely
more interesting than The Wrath
of Khan: Douglas Turnbull'sspe

cial effects are often astonishing,
and the production designs by
Lawrence G. Paull may be the
most inventive in any science fic
tion movie. The Los Angeles of
the film — set in 2019 — is a
neon-dotted landscape with
electric fires flashing out of
chimneys and aircraft soaring
overhead like hallucinatory
bubbles; from below, you see
enormous advertising images
projected on floating screens
and unceasing rain. Like the
people who assembled last
year's Outland, Scott and Paull
and photographer Jordan
Croenenworth have created a
future with enough visual con
nections to the past and the
present to be particularly eerie.
Some of the exteriors evoke
memories of the burnt-out Vien
na of The Third Man, while the
interiors are baroque, cavernous
and musty — mausoleum-like, as
in the Xanadu scenes in Citizen
Kane. And yet Blade Runner is a
cold, repellent movie.
In its original form, Blade
Runner was a wry novel by Philip
K. Dick called Do Androids
Dream of Electric SheepP, about
a bounty hunter assigned to "re
tire" (i.e., kill) a deceptively hu
man-seeming model of robot
(android or, in the film, repli
cant) known as the Nexus 6. His
problem is that he finds himself
unable to do his job without feel
ing as much guilt as if he were in
fact dispatching creatures of
flesh and blood. Adapting Dick's
story to the screen, Hampton
Faucher and David Peoples have
added an intriguing new wrinkle
out of Frankenstein by allowing
the replicant leader to confront
his maker in an effort to gain
more than the four-year life span
built into his system. Unhappily,
Ridley Scott, whose last film was
Alien, is not the right director for .

a movie that asks for emotional
fullness. His chief concern is
how to stage the violence in
freshly shocking, abstractly
beautiful ways — one replicant
crashes through four sets of
plate glass windows before she is
felled, and she wears a
cellophane raincoat so that the
blood can trickle down it in thin,
pretty streams. He concentrates
so much on these morally ques
tionable pictures that he lets the
narrative become muddy, and
he doesn't know what to do with
the actors. Harrison Ford, as the
hero, Deckard, is on automatic
pilot for almost the whole film,
and as the head replicant, the
Dutch actor Rutger Hauer, who
gave star performances in Sol
dier of Orange and Spetters, is
ferociously stylized under his
phosphorescent white fright
wig. No one else even registers.
Scott must get a kick out of
erecting gorgeous futuristic sets
and then setting off the dumb
conventions of old movies in
them, because Alien was just a
classy sci-fi haunted house pic

ture, and Blade Runner is full of
film noir bits. There are
crowded, creepy bars and a
Mickey Spillane narration (de
livered by Ford in a monotone),
and the robot Deckard falls for,
Rachael (Sean Young), sports a
piled, knobby '40s hairstyle and
suggests the dark beauty of some
of the post-war Hollywood hero
ines. (She also wears a striking
fake fur coat with a high collar
reminiscent of the one the Wick
ed Queen wore in Disney's
Snow White and the Seven
Dwarfs, while other replicants
suggest Fellini gone punk and
their manufacturer, Dr. Tyrell,
might be the High Lama in a 21st
century Lost Horizon.) Scott
doesn't know how to reshape
the style of these antique rou
tines, so they don't work for
him: they provide no humor and
no dramatic charge either. I
haven't seen a movie in a long
time that looked so marvelous
and played so flat — not since
Barry Lyndon or maybe Days of
Heaven. Someone is sure to mis
take it for art.
