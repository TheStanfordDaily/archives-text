# Theatre Works uneven in mixed 'Company'
## 
### Marc Fajer 
Theatre Works opened their
13th Summer Festival at the
Lucie Stern Community Center
in Palo Alto Saturday night with a
production of the Stephen Son
dheim musical Company. The
show, despite fine singing, and
some very funny moments, was,
on the whole, disappointing.
Difficulties with lighting and
choreography were especially
evident, and tended to over
shadow the good moments in
the show and to obscure John
Rathman's fine, evocative, sky
line set.
Company, which originally
opened on Broadway in 1970
with music and lyrics by Son
dheim and a book by George
Furth, concerns a 35-year-old
New York bachelor, Robert
(played by Steven Repetti), and
his "good and crazy" married
friends. The play is a study of
marriage, what it means to be in
timately involved, and what it
means to be alone.
The show was considered in
novative when it opened for its
use of musical numbers to com
ment on the action rather than
progress the plot. Director Rob
ert Kelley seems to-have shied
away from this a bit, and in doing
so, to have pulled the teeth out
of two of Company's more pow
erful numbers. In "Another
Hundred People," an outcry
against New York, "a city of
strangers," Kelley chooses to put
Marta (Ev Shiro) on roller-skates
while she sings, which makes the
city seem more whimsical than
cold. "Little Things," which is a
list of the elements of "perfect
relationships," (concerts you en
joy together, neighbors you an
noy together, children you de
stroy together ... ) is sung, at
first, between sections of
dialogue by Joanne (a wonder
fully bitchy performance by Sus

an Dorsey). Her entering and ex
iting for each section she sings is
more distracting than leaving
her in one place would have
been. This problem recurs
throughout the show; there
seem to be too many unneces
sary exits and entrances.
In other scenes, however,
Kelley's work is very good.
When Robert introduces Jenny
and David (Carol Bunker and
Brent Davis) to marijuana, their
reactions as they get high are
hysterical. "Sorry-Grateful,"
three husbands' contradictory
feelings about being married,
sung by Harry (Stephen S. Gill),
David, and Larry (Harry Christ), is
a lovely and touching number.
The staging of "Someone is Wait
ing," Robert's attempt to de
scribe his ideal girl, is also mov
ing; as he picks out the qualities
of each of the five wives of his
friends, they are highlighted in
intimate moments with their
husbands, emphasizing his lone
liness and their security.
Musical Director Stephen
Sano did a fine job both with the
orchestra and the vocalists.
There is little trouble under
standing Sondheim's difficult
and complex lyrics at any time,
and the singing, especially by the
women, is very good.
A wonderful performance was
turned in by Kathy Burch as
Amy. Her wedding morning sec
ond thoughts and confusion
("Getting Married Today") were
the high point of the show. Her
panic, as she frantically enjoins
everyone to "go have lunch, I'm
not getting married," as a can
dle-wielding choir bears down
on her, is hysterical. Diana Ell
ington, as April, a not-too-bright
stewardess who sleeps with Rob
ert, was also outstanding. Ev
Shiro, very funny as the slightly
crazy girl, Marta, who accosts
Robert in the park, and thinks

14th Street is the center of the
universe, does a fine dance rou
tine while April and Robert are
in bed together, but the purpose
of the dance is never really made
clear. Similarly, Michelle Col
lopy, as Kathy, yet another girl
friend, is moving and powerful
singing "Marry Me A Little," a
song which was originally writ
ten for Robert, and then cut
from the show. The rewriting
used to set up the re-inclusion of
the number is not good, and the
decision to stage the number did
not seem to augment the plot
particularly.
The weakest moments in the
show were the large group
dance numbers. The choreo
graphy by Sharon Cunningham
was often inappropriate, espe
cially during the title number,
and it was not well-executed.
The lighting by Bruce MacLeod
was often not bright enough,
and during these large numbers,

actors had a tendency to drift in
and out of the light. As a result of
all this, the "show-stopper"
numbers, "Company" and "Side
by Side by Side," looked
crowded and confused.
The set, the voices, the many
funny moments, and the strong
performances mentioned above
might have overcome the prob
lems if the main character had
been better. Steven Repetti, in
an admittedly difficult role, nev
er managed to convince us that
he was "the kind of man most
women want and never seem to
get." He always seemed uncom
fortable and weak with his
friends, and so the type of rela
tionships he was supposed to
have with them were not believ
able. By the time he comes to the
conclusion that "alone is alone
not alive" and is ready to make a
commitment at the end of the
show, we didn't care anymore.

Theatre Works opened their
13th Summer Festival at the
Lucie Stern Community Center
in Palo Alto Saturday night with a
production of the Stephen Son
dheim musical Company. The
show, despite fine singing, and
some very funny moments, was,
on the whole, disappointing.
Difficulties with lighting and
choreography were especially
evident, and tended to over
shadow the good moments in
the show and to obscure John
Rathman's fine, evocative, sky
line set.
Company, which originally
opened on Broadway in 1970
with music and lyrics by Son
dheim and a book by George
Furth, concerns a 35-year-old
New York bachelor, Robert
(played by Steven Repetti), and
his "good and crazy" married
friends. The play is a study of
marriage, what it means to be in
timately involved, and what it
means to be alone.
The show was considered in
novative when it opened for its
use of musical numbers to com
ment on the action rather than
progress the plot. Director Rob
ert Kelley seems to-have shied
away from this a bit, and in doing
so, to have pulled the teeth out
of two of Company's more pow
erful numbers. In "Another
Hundred People," an outcry
against New York, "a city of
strangers," Kelley chooses to put
Marta (Ev Shiro) on roller-skates
while she sings, which makes the
city seem more whimsical than
cold. "Little Things," which is a
list of the elements of "perfect
relationships," (concerts you en
joy together, neighbors you an
noy together, children you de
stroy together ... ) is sung, at
first, between sections of
dialogue by Joanne (a wonder
fully bitchy performance by Sus

an Dorsey). Her entering and ex
iting for each section she sings is
more distracting than leaving
her in one place would have
been. This problem recurs
throughout the show; there
seem to be too many unneces
sary exits and entrances.
In other scenes, however,
Kelley's work is very good.
When Robert introduces Jenny
and David (Carol Bunker and
Brent Davis) to marijuana, their
reactions as they get high are
hysterical. "Sorry-Grateful,"
three husbands' contradictory
feelings about being married,
sung by Harry (Stephen S. Gill),
David, and Larry (Harry Christ), is
a lovely and touching number.
The staging of "Someone is Wait
ing," Robert's attempt to de
scribe his ideal girl, is also mov
ing; as he picks out the qualities
of each of the five wives of his
friends, they are highlighted in
intimate moments with their
husbands, emphasizing his lone
liness and their security.
Musical Director Stephen
Sano did a fine job both with the
orchestra and the vocalists.
There is little trouble under
standing Sondheim's difficult
and complex lyrics at any time,
and the singing, especially by the
women, is very good.
A wonderful performance was
turned in by Kathy Burch as
Amy. Her wedding morning sec
ond thoughts and confusion
("Getting Married Today") were
the high point of the show. Her
panic, as she frantically enjoins
everyone to "go have lunch, I'm
not getting married," as a can
dle-wielding choir bears down
on her, is hysterical. Diana Ell
ington, as April, a not-too-bright
stewardess who sleeps with Rob
ert, was also outstanding. Ev
Shiro, very funny as the slightly
crazy girl, Marta, who accosts
Robert in the park, and thinks

14th Street is the center of the
universe, does a fine dance rou
tine while April and Robert are
in bed together, but the purpose
of the dance is never really made
clear. Similarly, Michelle Col
lopy, as Kathy, yet another girl
friend, is moving and powerful
singing "Marry Me A Little," a
song which was originally writ
ten for Robert, and then cut
from the show. The rewriting
used to set up the re-inclusion of
the number is not good, and the
decision to stage the number did
not seem to augment the plot
particularly.
The weakest moments in the
show were the large group
dance numbers. The choreo
graphy by Sharon Cunningham
was often inappropriate, espe
cially during the title number,
and it was not well-executed.
The lighting by Bruce MacLeod
was often not bright enough,
and during these large numbers,

actors had a tendency to drift in
and out of the light. As a result of
all this, the "show-stopper"
numbers, "Company" and "Side
by Side by Side," looked
crowded and confused.
The set, the voices, the many
funny moments, and the strong
performances mentioned above
might have overcome the prob
lems if the main character had
been better. Steven Repetti, in
an admittedly difficult role, nev
er managed to convince us that
he was "the kind of man most
women want and never seem to
get." He always seemed uncom
fortable and weak with his
friends, and so the type of rela
tionships he was supposed to
have with them were not believ
able. By the time he comes to the
conclusion that "alone is alone
not alive" and is ready to make a
commitment at the end of the
show, we didn't care anymore.
