Iran may further push Iraq
Washington — Although fighting be
tween Iranian and Iraqi forces appeared to
be less intense yesterday, there were indica
tions the Iranians may be planning a much
larger invasion further to the north within
the next week, according to both U.S. of
ficials and Arab sources.
Intelligence reports reaching here in
dicated that fighting was continuing along
about a front line. They also in
dicated that the initial Iranian thrust across
the border in southeastern Iraq Tuesday
night had penetrated about six miles into
Iraqi territory, roughly opposite the Iraqi
port city of Basra.
The six-mile estimate is less than the 12
miles estimated here yesterday. But sources
say these changes reflect refinements in in
telligence estimates based on data that
always lag many hours behind. Officials said
there was not much hard, or very precise, in
telligence being received from the area.
Iraq claimed yesterday that a three
pronged counter-attack had driven the in
vading Iranian forces from Iraqi soil. But
American officials monitoring intelligence
information developed independently —
presumably from picture-taking satellites,
high-flying reconaissance planes or airborne
warning and control systems radar planes
based in Saudi Arabia — say the Iraqis have
not pushed the Iranians back and that the
ground war is being fought inside Iraqi terri
tory.
Budget cuts approved
Washington — The House Ways and
Means Committee, meeting in an unusual
closed-door session, voted yesterday for a
package of Medicare savings totaling more
than $11 billion over three years and for crea
tion of an additional 13 weeks of unemploy
ment benefits.
In a day-long session barred to the public,
press and lobbyists, the panel approved a
combination of spending cuts and tax hikes
to cut budget deficits by nearly $21 billion
over the next three years.
More than half of that amount — about
$11.6 billion — would come from higher tax
es on federal workers, businesses and per
sons receiving unemployment benefits.
The Medicare savings call for slapping cost
controls on all services that hospitals provide
for recipients of the government's health
care program for the elderly.
It also includes an incentive system to re
ward hospitals for restraining annual in
creases in their costs. Institutions holding in
creases below a certain level would receive a

part of the difference as a reward.
In addition, the administration would be
ordered to produce a system under which
hospitals would agree in advance to accept a
certain amount of money for Medicare
payment, instead of the current system of re
imbursement for services.
Taken together, those three steps are ex
pected to save more than $5 billion over
three years.
Split-roll tax iniative fails
Sacramento — The split-roll initiative, a la
bor-backed proposal to cut homeowner and
renter taxes while raising business taxes, ap
parently has failed to qualify for the state
ballot, according to figures released yester
day.
Projections of signatures collected, based
on a random sample of petitions turned in to
counties, indicate that the initiative got only
92 percent of the 553,790 valid signatures it
needed to make the ballot, said Secretary of
State March Fong Eu.
She ordered a full signature count, as re
quired when the random sample yields a
projection between 90 and 110 percent of
the total. But state election officials say the
sampling method produces very accurate
projections.
"Based on past history, the random sample
has proved to be within 1 percent of the ac
tual signature-by-signature verification,"
said Caren Daniels, spokeswoman for Eu.
"If that proves to be the case this time as
well, the chances do not look good."
A leader of the initiative campaign, Ste
phen Hopcraft, said that after the signature
count is completed, the campaign will
challenge invalidation of individual signa
tures.
Me also said another attempt to qualify for
the 1984 ballot was "always a possibility, but
not one I'd like to think about."
GOP House losses predicted
Washington — A widely respected aca
demic model of off-year congressional elec
tions predicts Republicans will lose 40 U.S.
House seats in this fall's races, a Yale Univer
sity professor said yesterday.
A loss of 40 seats would be more than twice
the 15 to 17 seats that many political pro
fessionals now forecast.
Prof. Edward Tufte said his computer
model relates the public's ratings of a presi
dent's work in office and the nation's eco
nomic condition to the congressional elec
tions.
"Midterm elections have proved his
torically to be a rough, crude sort of referen-

how *e wfcee el *e Aeectoled Fn* «mI *e Lee Angeles Tlmee/WwUnglon Foel News Sefvke

dum on the performance of the incumbent
president and his management of the econ
omy," Tufte told a luncheon meeting of the
National Economists Club.
GOP losses in the House this fall would be
no surprise, for the party of the incumbent
president has lost House seats in every off
year election in this century save one. Dem
ocrats now hold a 242-193 edge in the House.
Tufte's model is widely respected in aca
demic circles for its record of accuracy and
its simpiicity. But the political scientist said
that two factors complicate the prediction
this year.
"The prediction has more uncertainty
than ever because of redisricting and be
cause of the great deal of Republican money
which is also very well spent," he said.
Tufte said he and others have extended
the model to cover Senate races as well and
that it works quite precisely for the upper
chamber too. He said the model for the Sen
ate would now forecast little change in the
54-45 partisan split there.
Spending bill approved
Washington — Congress gave final ap
proval yesterday to a compromise, $5.5
billion emergency spending bill, hoping to
avert a third veto by President Ronald Rea
gan and head off the unpaid furlough of
thousands of federal employees.
The House speedily approved the meas
ure on a 389-13 vote yesterday and sent it to
the Senate, which soon followed with a 91-6
affirmative vote that sent the legislation to
the White House.
Because the bill is Similar to one already
passed by the Senate with the blessing of
budget director David Stockman, its adop
tion by the Senate was virtually assured from
the outset.
There were strong indications that Reagan
would sign the bill this time.
"I've been informed this morning that the
president will sign this bill," Rep. Silvio Con
te of Massachusetts, ranking Republican
member of the Appropriations Committee,
told his colleagues on the House floor.
Deputy White House press secretary Larry
Speakes said the president's advisers recom
mended that he sign the bill. "We think it
looks like a good bill," Speakes said.
The measure was $4 billion less than the
first spending measure Reagan vetoed,
Speakes said, "so we think it was worth the
effort."
Said Conte: "Faced with two vetoes sus
tained in the House, with no bargaining
chips and (no) positions at all, we took what
we could get — which was very little."

"If that proves to be the case this time as

GOP House losses predicted
Washington — A widely respected aca
demic model of off-year congressional elec
tions predicts Republicans will lose 40 U.S.
House seats in this fall's races, a Yale Univer
sity professor said yesterday.
A loss of 40 seats would be more than twice
the 15 to 17 seats that many political pro
fessionals now forecast.
Prof. Edward Tufte said his computer
model relates the public's ratings of a presi
dent's work in office and the nation's eco
nomic condition to the congressional elec
tions.
"Midterm elections have proved his
torically to be a rough, crude sort of referen-

how *e wfcee el *e Aeectoled Fn* «mI *e Lee Angeles Tlmee/WwUnglon Foel News Sefvke

dum on the performance of the incumbent
president and his management of the econ
omy," Tufte told a luncheon meeting of the
National Economists Club.
GOP losses in the House this fall would be
no surprise, for the party of the incumbent
president has lost House seats in every off
year election in this century save one. Dem
ocrats now hold a 242-193 edge in the House.
Tufte's model is widely respected in aca
demic circles for its record of accuracy and
its simpiicity. But the political scientist said
that two factors complicate the prediction
this year.
"The prediction has more uncertainty
than ever because of redisricting and be
cause of the great deal of Republican money
which is also very well spent," he said.
Tufte said he and others have extended
the model to cover Senate races as well and
that it works quite precisely for the upper
chamber too. He said the model for the Sen
ate would now forecast little change in the
54-45 partisan split there.
Spending bill approved
Washington — Congress gave final ap
proval yesterday to a compromise, $5.5
billion emergency spending bill, hoping to
avert a third veto by President Ronald Rea
gan and head off the unpaid furlough of
thousands of federal employees.
The House speedily approved the meas
ure on a 389-13 vote yesterday and sent it to
the Senate, which soon followed with a 91-6
affirmative vote that sent the legislation to
the White House.
Because the bill is Similar to one already
passed by the Senate with the blessing of
budget director David Stockman, its adop
tion by the Senate was virtually assured from
the outset.
There were strong indications that Reagan
would sign the bill this time.
"I've been informed this morning that the
president will sign this bill," Rep. Silvio Con
te of Massachusetts, ranking Republican
member of the Appropriations Committee,
told his colleagues on the House floor.
Deputy White House press secretary Larry
Speakes said the president's advisers recom
mended that he sign the bill. "We think it
looks like a good bill," Speakes said.
The measure was $4 billion less than the
first spending measure Reagan vetoed,
Speakes said, "so we think it was worth the
effort."
Said Conte: "Faced with two vetoes sus
tained in the House, with no bargaining
chips and (no) positions at all, we took what
we could get — which was very little."
Iran may further push Iraq
Washington — Although fighting be
tween Iranian and Iraqi forces appeared to
be less intense yesterday, there were indica
tions the Iranians may be planning a much
larger invasion further to the north within
the next week, according to both U.S. of
ficials and Arab sources.
Intelligence reports reaching here in
dicated that fighting was continuing along
about a front line. They also in
dicated that the initial Iranian thrust across
the border in southeastern Iraq Tuesday
night had penetrated about six miles into
Iraqi territory, roughly opposite the Iraqi
port city of Basra.
The six-mile estimate is less than the 12
miles estimated here yesterday. But sources
say these changes reflect refinements in in
telligence estimates based on data that
always lag many hours behind. Officials said
there was not much hard, or very precise, in
telligence being received from the area.
Iraq claimed yesterday that a three
pronged counter-attack had driven the in
vading Iranian forces from Iraqi soil. But
American officials monitoring intelligence
information developed independently —
presumably from picture-taking satellites,
high-flying reconaissance planes or airborne
warning and control systems radar planes
based in Saudi Arabia — say the Iraqis have
not pushed the Iranians back and that the
ground war is being fought inside Iraqi terri
tory.
Budget cuts approved
Washington — The House Ways and
Means Committee, meeting in an unusual
closed-door session, voted yesterday for a
package of Medicare savings totaling more
than $11 billion over three years and for crea
tion of an additional 13 weeks of unemploy
ment benefits.
In a day-long session barred to the public,
press and lobbyists, the panel approved a
combination of spending cuts and tax hikes
to cut budget deficits by nearly $21 billion
over the next three years.
More than half of that amount — about
$11.6 billion — would come from higher tax
es on federal workers, businesses and per
sons receiving unemployment benefits.
The Medicare savings call for slapping cost
controls on all services that hospitals provide
for recipients of the government's health
care program for the elderly.
It also includes an incentive system to re
ward hospitals for restraining annual in
creases in their costs. Institutions holding in
creases below a certain level would receive a

part of the difference as a reward.
In addition, the administration would be
ordered to produce a system under which
hospitals would agree in advance to accept a
certain amount of money for Medicare
payment, instead of the current system of re
imbursement for services.
Taken together, those three steps are ex
pected to save more than $5 billion over
three years.
Split-roll tax iniative fails
Sacramento — The split-roll initiative, a la
bor-backed proposal to cut homeowner and
renter taxes while raising business taxes, ap
parently has failed to qualify for the state
ballot, according to figures released yester
day.
Projections of signatures collected, based
on a random sample of petitions turned in to
counties, indicate that the initiative got only
92 percent of the 553,790 valid signatures it
needed to make the ballot, said Secretary of
State March Fong Eu.
She ordered a full signature count, as re
quired when the random sample yields a
projection between 90 and 110 percent of
the total. But state election officials say the
sampling method produces very accurate
projections.
"Based on past history, the random sample
has proved to be within 1 percent of the ac
tual signature-by-signature verification,"
said Caren Daniels, spokeswoman for Eu.
"If that proves to be the case this time as
well, the chances do not look good."
