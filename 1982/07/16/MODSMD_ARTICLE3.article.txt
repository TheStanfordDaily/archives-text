# USW, Univ. mum on contract
## 
### Ray Newman 
Both University and United Stanford Workers
(USW) negotiator's have refused to talk to the
press concerning the progress of ongoing nego
tiations to replace the contract which expires Aug.
30.
Both sides agreed during their first negotiating
sessions to release information about the delibera
tions only through joint press releases.
Priscilla Wheeler, staff counsel and chief nego
tiator for the University, said yesterday that she
would not talk to a Daily reporter about the nego
tiations because "we want to focus our energies at
the table, and that's what we're going to do."
USW officials have also refused to speak to re
porters concerning the negotiations. A USW secre
tary said yesterday that the union was continuing
the press-release-only policy.
The University and USW have issued one press
release since negotiations began July 2. The release
listed the members of the negotiating team and

briefly described the union, but gave no indication
regarding the progress of the talks.
A USW negotiator had agreed earlier to answer
reporters' questions if they were submitted in writ
ing, in order that the University and the union
could discuss the questions together. That pro
posal fell through because the negotiators had
more important business to do than deal with the
press, according to Michael Baratz, executive sec
retary for USW.
During contract negotiations in the summer of
1979, both the University and the union discussed
the talks with reporters.
Other local unions have more open relations
with reporters. A spokesman for Teamsters Union
Local 216 said the union talked to reporters
"whenever they call." He added, "we don't call
them."
A spokesman for the American Federation of
Government Employees 2110 said that the union
"has no objections" to talking with reporters dur
ing contract negotiations.
