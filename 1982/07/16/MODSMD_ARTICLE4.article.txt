# University screens cable TV option
## 
### Neil MacFarquhar Senior staff writer 
As the alarm goes off at 9 a.m.,
Greg sits up in bed, turns on the
TV, switches to thetampus eco
nomics channel, and begins tak
ing notes from his professor's
lecture on supply and demand.
The professor's husband, writ
ing at their campus home, keeps
the T.V. on with the sound off,
watching the expressions on his
wife's face as she talks.
When the professor returns to
her office, she sits down at her
video display terminal, glances
over her "electronic" mail, and
then "calls-up" the morning's
Wall Street Journal.
If the University decides to in
stall a cable T.V. system, these
imaginary events might occur.
In the wake of a report detail
ing the potential benefits of
cable, the University is gauging
the forms of cable desired by
faculty and staff and studying the
engineering and financial
aspects of developing a system.
But a cable system would not be
come "fully operational" until
one to three years after the Uni
versity decides to implement it,
according to the report.
The University task force on
cable television recommends
that the University develop and
install a cable network because
"cable television will become a
significant feature in the ev
eryday personal and work lives
of most citizens."
The majority of people at the
University will have "to deal with
cable communication before
long and we can expect an in
creasing level of dependence on
this technology," according to
the task force report.
The task force recommends a
"broadband" system using a
coaxial cable, which would allow
any point within the system to
both send and receive. "Broad

band" means that in using dif
ferent frequencies, the cable
could carry TV signals, computer
hook-ups, telephone lines, and
electronic fire alarms, etc., all at
the same time.
As part of the development,
the University recently sent out
two questionnaires: one to 50
percent of the faculty and staff
living in Palo Alto and another to
all faculty and staff living on
campus.
The questionnaire sent to on
campus faculty and staff is the
same as that sent to Palo Alto res
idents, except it asks additional
questions concerning current
television and video usage.
Campus residents were also
asked to cite their cable enter
tainment preferences, from jazz
concerts to hard-core porno
graphy. The cable service would
be available on a subscription
basis from private companies.
Mike Oman, associate provost
and chairman of the cable task
force, said the questionnaire is
intended to "ascertain people's
interest in cable as entertain
ment and as an integrated sys
tem for handling data."
Since Palo Alto is currently re
viewing its options in implemen
ting a cable system, the survey
sent to University-affiliated Palo
Alto residents is designed to give
them "a chance to express their
views on the type of Stanford
services which might be pro
vided on a Palo Alto system," ac
cording to the Center for In
formation Technology.
Link to campus
Respondents are asked to an
swer on a one to five scale
whether they would be in
terested in telecasts of, for exam
ple, Lively Arts performances,
athletic contests, or lectures by
University faculty.
The questionnaire also asks if
viewers would be interested in
linking home terminals to office
computers or to national in
formation services.
A television can be trans
formed into a computer display
terminal with "videotex," a
technological system used in
conjunction with a decoding de
vice and a typewriter-like key
pad. Using videotex, for exam
ple, cable subscribers could read
any of the 11 newspapers na
tionwide, including the New
York Times and the San Francis
co Chronicle, which are avail
able on cable systems.
Faculty and staff were also
asked what they might be willing
to pay for services like videotex.
In addition to the survey,
Oman said, the task force wants
furthur research done on the en
gineering aspects of establishing
the cable links and on the finan
cial aspects of the system includ
ing implementation costs and
potential future return.
An outside firm, RFI Inc., won
the contract to survey the Uni
versity's existing duct system —
the cement-encased pipes
which carry wiring from building
to building — to determine
which ducts might be used for
cable and how many would have
to be added.
According to Gerald Os
trander, director of utilities and a
task force member, the com
pany completed its fieldwork
and is now drawing up the de

sign for a potential broadband
cable system.
It is a complicated process, Os
trander said, because a cable sys
tem would overlap as well as re
place some of the existing tele
phone lines and lines for SUNet
(Stanford University Network) —
the future University computer
and word-processing network.
The task force report says the
University has three options for
bringing cable on campus:
building and operating a system
of its own, obtaining a private
system but subcontracting a
private firm to build it, or tap
ping into a local community's
system. The options could be
mixed, for example, tapping a
local community's system for en
tertainment cable while keeping
the rest private.
While the University would re
tain "total control" over a
private system, the task force
does not recommend this option
because of "the financial risks,
the University's lack of market
ing expertise, and the Univer
sity's direct participation in a
sensitive business relationship
with its faculty, staff, and stu
dents."
Other universities, including
Brown, Michigan State, and the
University of Arizona, are in the
process of developing cable sys
tems.
On a national level, the report
says, 4500 cable systems now op
erate in 10,000 cities, with cable
available in 32 percent of all TV

homes. Of the 25.9 million
homes which actually use cable,
only about 800,000 of them have
two-way systems, the report
says.
Aside from regular entertain
ment, a cable system could be
used for public service an
nouncements and for adminis
trative and utility tasks. The re
port says that class scheduling in
formation, a news program pro
duced in a studio in the soon-to
be-completed communications
building, and local phone in
formation are just some of the
obvious applications for a uni
versity cable system.
The task force says cable could
be used to increase safety and
security on campus with elec
tronic fire alarms, intrusion
alarms, remote television
monitoring, and emergency
broadcasting, all linked to the
police and fire stations.
The task force has been work
ing with the City of Palo Alto,
and recommends that the cam
pus and the city be linked. Palo
Alto would benefit in obtaining
extensive, unique programming
from the University, and the
University would benefit in that
the large number of faculty,
staff, and students living in Palo
Alto would be able to com
municate more readily with the
campus.
The task force will recom
mend a cable system for the Uni
versity, pending the outcome of
its studies.

tem for handling data."
Since Palo Alto is currently re
viewing its options in implemen
ting a cable system, the survey
sent to University-affiliated Palo
Alto residents is designed to give
them "a chance to express their
views on the type of Stanford
services which might be pro
vided on a Palo Alto system," ac
cording to the Center for In
formation Technology.
Link to campus
Respondents are asked to an
swer on a one to five scale
whether they would be in
terested in telecasts of, for exam
ple, Lively Arts performances,
athletic contests, or lectures by
University faculty.
The questionnaire also asks if
viewers would be interested in
linking home terminals to office
computers or to national in
formation services.
A television can be trans
formed into a computer display
terminal with "videotex," a
technological system used in
conjunction with a decoding de
vice and a typewriter-like key
pad. Using videotex, for exam
ple, cable subscribers could read
any of the 11 newspapers na
tionwide, including the New
York Times and the San Francis
co Chronicle, which are avail
able on cable systems.
Faculty and staff were also
asked what they might be willing
to pay for services like videotex.
In addition to the survey,
Oman said, the task force wants
furthur research done on the en
gineering aspects of establishing
the cable links and on the finan
cial aspects of the system includ
ing implementation costs and
potential future return.
An outside firm, RFI Inc., won
the contract to survey the Uni
versity's existing duct system —
the cement-encased pipes
which carry wiring from building
to building — to determine
which ducts might be used for
cable and how many would have
to be added.
According to Gerald Os
trander, director of utilities and a
task force member, the com
pany completed its fieldwork
and is now drawing up the de

sign for a potential broadband
cable system.
It is a complicated process, Os
trander said, because a cable sys
tem would overlap as well as re
place some of the existing tele
phone lines and lines for SUNet
(Stanford University Network) —
the future University computer
and word-processing network.
The task force report says the
University has three options for
bringing cable on campus:
building and operating a system
of its own, obtaining a private
system but subcontracting a
private firm to build it, or tap
ping into a local community's
system. The options could be
mixed, for example, tapping a
local community's system for en
tertainment cable while keeping
the rest private.
While the University would re
tain "total control" over a
private system, the task force
does not recommend this option
because of "the financial risks,
the University's lack of market
ing expertise, and the Univer
sity's direct participation in a
sensitive business relationship
with its faculty, staff, and stu
dents."
Other universities, including
Brown, Michigan State, and the
University of Arizona, are in the
process of developing cable sys
tems.
On a national level, the report
says, 4500 cable systems now op
erate in 10,000 cities, with cable
available in 32 percent of all TV

homes. Of the 25.9 million
homes which actually use cable,
only about 800,000 of them have
two-way systems, the report
says.
Aside from regular entertain
ment, a cable system could be
used for public service an
nouncements and for adminis
trative and utility tasks. The re
port says that class scheduling in
formation, a news program pro
duced in a studio in the soon-to
be-completed communications
building, and local phone in
formation are just some of the
obvious applications for a uni
versity cable system.
The task force says cable could
be used to increase safety and
security on campus with elec
tronic fire alarms, intrusion
alarms, remote television
monitoring, and emergency
broadcasting, all linked to the
police and fire stations.
The task force has been work
ing with the City of Palo Alto,
and recommends that the cam
pus and the city be linked. Palo
Alto would benefit in obtaining
extensive, unique programming
from the University, and the
University would benefit in that
the large number of faculty,
staff, and students living in Palo
Alto would be able to com
municate more readily with the
campus.
The task force will recom
mend a cable system for the Uni
versity, pending the outcome of
its studies.
As the alarm goes off at 9 a.m.,
Greg sits up in bed, turns on the
TV, switches to thetampus eco
nomics channel, and begins tak
ing notes from his professor's
lecture on supply and demand.
The professor's husband, writ
ing at their campus home, keeps
the T.V. on with the sound off,
watching the expressions on his
wife's face as she talks.
When the professor returns to
her office, she sits down at her
video display terminal, glances
over her "electronic" mail, and
then "calls-up" the morning's
Wall Street Journal.
If the University decides to in
stall a cable T.V. system, these
imaginary events might occur.
In the wake of a report detail
ing the potential benefits of
cable, the University is gauging
the forms of cable desired by
faculty and staff and studying the
engineering and financial
aspects of developing a system.
But a cable system would not be
come "fully operational" until
one to three years after the Uni
versity decides to implement it,
according to the report.
The University task force on
cable television recommends
that the University develop and
install a cable network because
"cable television will become a
significant feature in the ev
eryday personal and work lives
of most citizens."
The majority of people at the
University will have "to deal with
cable communication before
long and we can expect an in
creasing level of dependence on
this technology," according to
the task force report.
The task force recommends a
"broadband" system using a
coaxial cable, which would allow
any point within the system to
both send and receive. "Broad

band" means that in using dif
ferent frequencies, the cable
could carry TV signals, computer
hook-ups, telephone lines, and
electronic fire alarms, etc., all at
the same time.
As part of the development,
the University recently sent out
two questionnaires: one to 50
percent of the faculty and staff
living in Palo Alto and another to
all faculty and staff living on
campus.
The questionnaire sent to on
campus faculty and staff is the
same as that sent to Palo Alto res
idents, except it asks additional
questions concerning current
television and video usage.
Campus residents were also
asked to cite their cable enter
tainment preferences, from jazz
concerts to hard-core porno
graphy. The cable service would
be available on a subscription
basis from private companies.
Mike Oman, associate provost
and chairman of the cable task
force, said the questionnaire is
