# University screens cable TV option
## 
### Neil MacFarquhar Senior staff writer 
As the alarm goes off at 9 a.m.,
Greg sits up in bed, turns on the
TV, switches to thetampus eco
nomics channel, and begins tak
ing notes from his professor's
lecture on supply and demand.
The professor's husband, writ
ing at their campus home, keeps
the T.V. on with the sound off,
watching the expressions on his
wife's face as she talks.
When the professor returns to
her office, she sits down at her
video display terminal, glances
over her "electronic" mail, and
then "calls-up" the morning's
Wall Street Journal.
If the University decides to in
stall a cable T.V. system, these
imaginary events might occur.
In the wake of a report detail
ing the potential benefits of
cable, the University is gauging
the forms of cable desired by
faculty and staff and studying the
engineering and financial
aspects of developing a system.
But a cable system would not be
come "fully operational" until
one to three years after the Uni
versity decides to implement it,
according to the report.
The University task force on
cable television recommends
that the University develop and
install a cable network because
"cable television will become a
significant feature in the ev
eryday personal and work lives
of most citizens."
The majority of people at the
University will have "to deal with
cable communication before
long and we can expect an in
creasing level of dependence on
this technology," according to
the task force report.
The task force recommends a
"broadband" system using a
coaxial cable, which would allow
any point within the system to
both send and receive. "Broad

band" means that in using dif
ferent frequencies, the cable
could carry TV signals, computer
hook-ups, telephone lines, and
electronic fire alarms, etc., all at
the same time.
As part of the development,
the University recently sent out
two questionnaires: one to 50
percent of the faculty and staff
living in Palo Alto and another to
all faculty and staff living on
campus.
The questionnaire sent to on
campus faculty and staff is the
same as that sent to Palo Alto res
idents, except it asks additional
questions concerning current
television and video usage.
Campus residents were also
asked to cite their cable enter
tainment preferences, from jazz
concerts to hard-core porno
graphy. The cable service would
be available on a subscription
basis from private companies.
Mike Oman, associate provost
and chairman of the cable task
force, said the questionnaire is
intended to "ascertain people's
interest in cable as entertain
ment and as an integrated sys
tem for handling data."
Since Palo Alto is currently re
viewing its options in implemen
ting a cable system, the survey
sent to University-affiliated Palo
Alto residents is designed to give
them "a chance to express their
views on the type of Stanford
services which might be pro
vided on a Palo Alto system," ac
cording to the Center for In
formation Technology.

Respondents are asked to an
swer on a one to five scale
whether they would be in
terested in telecasts of, for exam
ple, Lively Arts performances,
athletic contests, or lectures by
University faculty.
The questionnaire also asks if
