## Oil supply line from Mid East in jeopardy 
### Dallas Times Herald 
Washington — Iran's in
vasion of Iraq will have virtually
no immediate effect on oil sup
plies to the industrialized West,
specialists say, but they think it
could mark the beginning of a
shift in the fragile power struc
ture of the Middle East, one
that holds potentially
catastrophic consequences for
the oil-consuming nations.
In the nearfuture, the world
wide glut of crude oil, which
the Organization of Petroleum
Exporting Countries has not
been able to control, will ab
sorb any cuts in Iraq's produc
tion that might result from the
Iranian invasion, according to
petroleum experts.
Although spot oil prices
might jump if Iran succeeds in
toppling Iraqi President Sad

dam Hussein, one interna
tional energy expert said, the
world can easily withstand the
loss of Iraq's already reduced
oil output.
However, many analysts ex
pect that the Shiite Moslems in
Iran, fresh from a victory over
Iraq, will try toexporttheirfun
damentalist religious revolu
tion to the more moderate
Arab nations. Typically those
nations are ruled by members
of the rival Sunni Moslem sect,
which comprises the majority
of the Islamic population in all
but Iran, Iraq and the tiny is
land nation of Bahrain.
Once such a revolution
starts to spread, the oil supply
line from the Middle East could
be jeopardized — because oil
facilities would be an inviting
target and because, under such

pressure, even pro-Western
Arab leaders may be forced to
re-think their oil policies, the
analysts say.
"If the Shiites come to power
(in Iraq) they could foment un
rest in other countries. This
could potentially destabilize
the entire Middle East," said
one State Department source.
Although some Middle East
experts argue that Iranian lead
er Ayatollah Ruhollah Kho
meini's puritanical religious
views won't gain widespread
acceptance in the growing
consumer societies of the
wealthy oil-producing nations,
they don't discount the poten
tial havoc that Iran could
wreak.
Last December Shiite
Moslems backed by Iran failed
in an attempt to overthrow the
government of Bahrain, off the
eastern coast of Saudi Arabia,
and Khomeini has called for
the Shiite minorities in Kuwait
and Saudi Arabia to overthrow
the moderate, pro-Western
rulers of those nations.
In response, Saudi Arabia,
Kuwait and the United Arab
Emirates have given Iraq an es
timated $20 billion to help fi
nance its war with Iran. In addi
tion, through the forum of the
Gulf Cooperation Council,
they have been meeting regu
larly to fashion a response to
Iran's apparently imminent de
feat of Iraq.
Those three nations supply
nearly one-fifth of the world's
oil, or about 10 million barrels
per day. Add Iraq and Iran
(whose combined output is be
tween 2.5 million and 3 million
barrels per day) and one

will seek an "accommodation"
with Iran, in order to buy
peace. One price may be that
the Arab OPEC producers
fourth of the world's oil supply
is at stake.
One analyst suggested that
the Persian Gulf oil producers

would concede a larger share
of the oil export market to Iran.
That, in turn, means more
importing nations would be
vulnerable to the Iranians' use
of the "oil weapon," and that
Iranian coffers would be brim
ming with extra cash to spend.
