# U.S. puts obstacles in path of pipeline and alliance

"A spectre is haunting Europe
One hundred and thirty four
years after Marx's statement in
his 1848 treatise, The Communist
Manifesto, a spectre still haunts
Europe; however, with the im
position of martial law in Poland
and recent swings to the right in
West German elections, few
would argue that what most
haunts Europe is that self-same
communism.

News analysis

Rather, what now threatens
Western European allies are the
consequences of American for
eign policy decisions in the re
gion — high interest rates, fears
of playing host to an East-West
nuclear exchange, and the pres
ent dispute over the proposed
Euro-Soviet natural gas pipeline.
While Western European gov
ernments view the 3700 Urengoy
pipeline, which will run from
Siberia to Western Europe, as a
form of financial and
geopolitical security, the Reagan
administration has placed a ban
on the export of American tech
nology and equipment for work
on the pipeline to block its pro
duction.
To many Western Europeans,
the pipeline is synonomous with
employment. High interest rates
have provoked increased lay
offs and the $10 to $15 billion
pipeline promises many jobs.
As the Soviets manufacture
approximately 1,000,000 tons of
steel pipe per year, they will
need an additional 13 to 15 mil
lion tons of pipe. Mannesheim
of West Germany, the principal

co-contractor of the project,
along with Creusot-Loire of
France, is the chief manufacturer
of such pipe and expects the
pipeline to create approximately
3000 new positions.
The project promises reven
ues as well. German, French and
Dutch banks have awarded $4
billion in loans and credit to the
Soviets, so far, at a negotiated
price of 7Vi percent. Most of
these loans have provisions re
quiring the Soviets to purchase
equipment from the lender.
The contract between the So
viet Union and Germany,
France, Austria and Switzerland
lasts 25 years and is renegotiable
every three years thereafter. The
present negotiated price is $4.65
per.million BTUs (ca. 1000 cubic
feet of gas), considerably lower
than what France and West Ger
many now pay. In addition, the
contracts, denominated in Eu
ropean currencies, rather than
in dollars, give the Soviets in
creased liquidity to purchase Eu
ropean goods.
According to Stanford Politi
cal Science Profs. Steven
Krasner, a specialist in political
economy, and Alexander Dallin,
a scholar of Soviet foreign poli
cy, the pipeline represents a
form of risk diversification,
whereby Western European na
tions are able to become more
independent of the less ex
pansive and more expensive nat
ural gas reserves they now use.
The Urengoy region is as
sumed to contain 15 trillion
cubic meters of natural gas alto
gether.
The Europeans also view the
pipeline as beneficial to their
geopolitical security since an in
creased Soviet-European in

terdependence, indicated by
the increased level of European
trade with the Eastern block,
would deter the Soviet Union
from taking any potentially
destabilizing action in the re
gion.
Furthermore, President
Ronald Reagan's statements
concerning deployment of Per
shing and Cruise missiles in Eu
rope and the possibility of a
"winnable" nuclear war have
raised the question of United
States military commitment to
Europe. Western Europeans
point to these statements and
the initial U.S. abstention during
a U.N. vote during the Falklands
crisis as evidence of a specious
alliance.
Although the Europeans do
not perceive the Soviet Union as
politically motivated in con
structing the pipeline, some ex
perts claim that one of their aims
is to split the United States from
its Western allies. "The Soviets
are trying to drive a wedge be
tween the United States and
Western Europe, and with the
help of Reagan they just might
do that," said Dallin.
The Soviets plan to use the
Western hard currency to be
earned by the venture and the
geographic layout of the
pipeline as the preliminary steps
in the development of a Soviet
natural gas infrastructure.
Fearing the project would in
crease the Soviets' military mus
cle and economic defense
against later U.S. sanctions and
their ability to exert diplomatic
and economic leverage over Eu
rope, and disturbed by the re
cent imposition of martial law in
Poland, the Reagan adminis
tration has attempted to halt the

project. A ban issued early this
spring on the export of all Amer
ican technology and equipment
to European firms involved in
the pipeline's construction was
extended by the administration
on June 20 to include American
subsidiaries in Europe who will
face embargoes on data and
goods if they do not heed the
ban.
Krasner calls the action "im
prudent," and believes the Eu
ropeans will manufacture their
own machinery in spite of the
ban although most experts ex
pect the pipeline to be delayed
two years.
The ban has outraged many
Western European leaders, in
cluding British Prime Minister

Margaret Thatcher, who has
shown consistent support for
Reagan's policies.
It appears the United States is
in a no-win situation. The West
Europeans are set on following
through with the pipeline's con
struction, despite the bans, and
on July 1, the Deutsche Bank of
fered Moscow $2.03 billion in
credit, confirming its commit
ment to the project.
Thus, if the "haunting"
pipeline debate is not resolved
through careful diplomacy and
aplomb, the respect and
credibility the United States
holds in Western Europe may
become as vaporous and trans
parent as the gas the Euro-Soviet
pipeline intends to carry.

independent of the less ex
pansive and more expensive nat
ural gas reserves they now use.
The Urengoy region is as
sumed to contain 15 trillion
cubic meters of natural gas alto
gether.
The Europeans also view the
pipeline as beneficial to their
geopolitical security since an in
creased Soviet-European in

terdependence, indicated by
the increased level of European
trade with the Eastern block,
would deter the Soviet Union
from taking any potentially
destabilizing action in the re
gion.
Furthermore, President
Ronald Reagan's statements
concerning deployment of Per
shing and Cruise missiles in Eu
rope and the possibility of a
"winnable" nuclear war have
raised the question of United
States military commitment to
Europe. Western Europeans
point to these statements and
the initial U.S. abstention during
a U.N. vote during the Falklands
crisis as evidence of a specious
alliance.
Although the Europeans do
not perceive the Soviet Union as
politically motivated in con
structing the pipeline, some ex
perts claim that one of their aims
is to split the United States from
its Western allies. "The Soviets
are trying to drive a wedge be
tween the United States and
Western Europe, and with the
help of Reagan they just might
do that," said Dallin.
The Soviets plan to use the
Western hard currency to be
earned by the venture and the
geographic layout of the
pipeline as the preliminary steps
in the development of a Soviet
natural gas infrastructure.
Fearing the project would in
crease the Soviets' military mus
cle and economic defense
against later U.S. sanctions and
their ability to exert diplomatic
and economic leverage over Eu
rope, and disturbed by the re
cent imposition of martial law in
Poland, the Reagan adminis
tration has attempted to halt the

project. A ban issued early this
spring on the export of all Amer
ican technology and equipment
to European firms involved in
the pipeline's construction was
extended by the administration
on June 20 to include American
subsidiaries in Europe who will
face embargoes on data and
goods if they do not heed the
ban.
Krasner calls the action "im
prudent," and believes the Eu
ropeans will manufacture their
own machinery in spite of the
ban although most experts ex
pect the pipeline to be delayed
two years.
The ban has outraged many
Western European leaders, in
cluding British Prime Minister

Margaret Thatcher, who has
shown consistent support for
Reagan's policies.
It appears the United States is
in a no-win situation. The West
Europeans are set on following
through with the pipeline's con
struction, despite the bans, and
on July 1, the Deutsche Bank of
fered Moscow $2.03 billion in
credit, confirming its commit
ment to the project.
Thus, if the "haunting"
pipeline debate is not resolved
through careful diplomacy and
aplomb, the respect and
credibility the United States
holds in Western Europe may
become as vaporous and trans
parent as the gas the Euro-Soviet
pipeline intends to carry.
"A spectre is haunting Europe
One hundred and thirty four
years after Marx's statement in
his 1848 treatise, The Communist
Manifesto, a spectre still haunts
Europe; however, with the im
position of martial law in Poland
and recent swings to the right in
West German elections, few
would argue that what most
haunts Europe is that self-same
communism.

News analysis

Rather, what now threatens
Western European allies are the
consequences of American for
eign policy decisions in the re
gion — high interest rates, fears
of playing host to an East-West
nuclear exchange, and the pres
ent dispute over the proposed
Euro-Soviet natural gas pipeline.
While Western European gov
ernments view the 3700 Urengoy
pipeline, which will run from
Siberia to Western Europe, as a
form of financial and
geopolitical security, the Reagan
administration has placed a ban
on the export of American tech
nology and equipment for work
on the pipeline to block its pro
duction.
To many Western Europeans,
the pipeline is synonomous with
employment. High interest rates
have provoked increased lay
offs and the $10 to $15 billion
pipeline promises many jobs.
As the Soviets manufacture
approximately 1,000,000 tons of
steel pipe per year, they will
need an additional 13 to 15 mil
lion tons of pipe. Mannesheim
of West Germany, the principal

co-contractor of the project,
along with Creusot-Loire of
France, is the chief manufacturer
of such pipe and expects the
pipeline to create approximately
3000 new positions.
The project promises reven
ues as well. German, French and
Dutch banks have awarded $4
billion in loans and credit to the
Soviets, so far, at a negotiated
price of 7Vi percent. Most of
these loans have provisions re
quiring the Soviets to purchase
equipment from the lender.
The contract between the So
viet Union and Germany,
France, Austria and Switzerland
lasts 25 years and is renegotiable
every three years thereafter. The
present negotiated price is $4.65
per.million BTUs (ca. 1000 cubic
feet of gas), considerably lower
than what France and West Ger
many now pay. In addition, the
contracts, denominated in Eu
ropean currencies, rather than
in dollars, give the Soviets in
creased liquidity to purchase Eu
ropean goods.
According to Stanford Politi
cal Science Profs. Steven
Krasner, a specialist in political
economy, and Alexander Dallin,
a scholar of Soviet foreign poli
cy, the pipeline represents a
form of risk diversification,
whereby Western European na
tions are able to become more
independent of the less ex
pansive and more expensive nat
ural gas reserves they now use.
The Urengoy region is as
sumed to contain 15 trillion
cubic meters of natural gas alto
gether.
