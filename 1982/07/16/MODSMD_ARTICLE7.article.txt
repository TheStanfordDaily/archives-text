## Viewpoint/Carolyn Brown Pizzeria would ruin lake's atmosphere 
### 
An article printed in last Fri
day's Daily suggested a pizza
parlor would be ready to oper
ate at Lake Lagunita in October.
The ASSU Senate and the Stan
ford student body don't realize
the implications of this proposal.
Sure — it would be fantastic to
eat pizza at 12:30 a.m. on a
Wednesday night that tastes as if
it hadn't been riding in a back
seat for an hour. A take-out
pizza parlor is a definite plus fac
tor for those late night
munchies. Pizza proceeds
directed toward boathouse ex
penses are definitely pleasing to
the pocketbook. But the
boathouse isn't such a choice
spot for this hunger curing idea.
Lake Lagunita and the
boathouse provide recreational
activities for water lovers and
sun bathers in the springtime. It
provides a place of repose — a
chance to get away from study
ing and to see some new scenery
other than the inside of a trailer
or dorm room. I have often vis-
Jted the lake and boathouse to
dream and watch windsurfers
while enjoying a beautiful sun
set. Unfortunately, this scenario
would be destroyed by whiffs of
pepperoni and mushrooms siz
zling on the top of tomato sauce.
I'm also not too sure that I would
be thrilled about seeing empty
pizza boxes littering the lake's
shores.
Another problem I can vis
ualize involves safety factors. I
for one would not venture out at
11 p.m. to pick up a pizza in an
unlit, not-too-traveled area. (Al
though I realize that there would
be deliveries, maybe I wouldn't
want to pay the extra cost for this
— vou may recall that I'm un
employed.)

My suggestion for a pizza
parlor location is the Tresidder
parking lot vicinity — maybe
near the Bechtel center. In this
way, access to pizza pick-up is
easily provided and the area is
well-travelled. The pizza build
ing is not planned to occupy
much space; originally I believe
it would be built behind the fire
pit at the boathouse which is an
area of about 200 square feet.
Let's keep the boathouse and
Lake Lagunita out of the fast
food traffic.
Carolyn Brown is a junior in
