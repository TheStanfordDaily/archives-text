# Polish visitor announces probable defection
## 
### Bill Ainsworth 
A Polish scholar and member
of the suspended trade union
Solidarity, now doing research at
the Hoover Institution, an
nounced last week that if the
current martial law situation in
Poland continues he would seek
political asylum in the United
States.
However, as of yesterday Rett
Ludwikowski, who is studying
conservative movements in
America and political thought in
Poland from the 19th century to
the present, said he has not of
ficially filed forasylum. "I am not
completely decided yet," he
said. "Over time I hope that
something (in Poland) might
change. But I realize that hopes
are weak."
Under the martial law regime
Ludwikowski said there was "no
possibility" of working in Po
land.
"Maybe if I was head of Soli
darity my place would be in Po
land. As a scholar I am able to do
better work abroad," he said.
The decision to leave, he said,
was made so that he could con
duct his work without restric
tions and enjoy the civil liberties
available in the U.S.

"It was not made for econom
ic reasons," he said, adding that
he did not live under difficult
circumstances in Poland. In fact,
he left virtually all his
possessions in Poland.
Ludwikowski is staying here
with his two young children and
his wife Margaret, who is a law
yer. He will be at the Hoover In
stitution until this Saturday.
Ludwikowski feared that his
institution would be re-or
ganized and that historical sub
jects would be manipulated by
the government to serve its own
purposes.
At Cracow University, where
Ludwikowski's teaches, the law
faculty was suspended after it is
sued a proclamation opposing
martial law. All universities were
closed for two months during
the current crackdown.
After his university was re
opened, Ludwikowski was asked
to give a lecture on the benefits
of martial law â€” which he re
fused to do. For this action he
was not fired from the university,
but told that when all professors
were tested for loyalty his time
would come. At that point he ap
plied for a visa to do research in
the United States.

Ludwikowski said he could
not predict the impact his defec
tion would have on other Poles
trying to leave the country but
added that he was sure all Soli
darity union members applying
for visas were screened carefully
in any case.
Ludwikowski said that while in
Poland, he was "not persecuted

in the strict sense of the word."
However, he said his telephone
was monitored, his mail was
opened and his apartment was
checked.
Before the martial law
crackdown, Ludowikoski said he
enjoyed almost complete aca
demic freedom. He said he faced
no harsh academic restrictions

even before the appearance of
the liberalization movement in
Poland that came with Solidarity.
"I had relative freedom," he
said. " Of course the authorities
checked my work.
"When Solidarity appeared
the scope of freedoms grew big
ger. We were able to present ev
ery political view as we saw it."
One of the intellectual weak
nesses in Poland, he said* is the
concentration on world move
ments of the left.
He said his studies of conser
vative movements in the United
States had not caused him any
problems with the authorities.
On his current visit to the
Hoover Institution, he said he
has found a unique collection of
Polish materials in the Institu
tion's library. Last year
Ludwikowski visited the Institu
tion for two days during which
time he did some research and
attended seminars.
Currently Ludwikowski is
being sponsored by three in
stitutions, including the Wilbur
Foundation in Michigan which
he is using as a base, the Heritage
Foundation in Washington, D.C.
and the Hoover Institution.
