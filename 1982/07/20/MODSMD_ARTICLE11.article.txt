# New sounds 'pipe' into Mem Chu
## Baroque organ to replace romantic 
### Jane Bailie 
Ever since the 1906 earthquake
destroyed a significant portion
of Memorial Church, construc
tion and reconstruction have
been predominant features of
this example of University
architecture. But current reno
vation is to accomodate a musi
cal, rather than a structural,
change.
The romantic organ which has
occupied the north wall of the
church since 1902 is to be joined
by a baroque contemporary or
gan whose installation is set for
November 1983. The new instru
ment is being assembled in Bos
ton by the Charles Fisk Co. Fisk
himself was a graduate student
of music here.
"The organ we have now is
similar to English cathedral or
gans and is excellent for late
19th- and early 20th-century mu
sic. Its sound is richer, more
mellow than the new organ,"
said Herbert Nanney, professor

of music and Memorial Church
organist of 35 years.
The new baroque organ "will
give us the special ability to play
Renaissance and pre-1750 mu
sic," said Nanney. "With proper
tuning, we will be able to play a
well-tempered Bach as well as
earlier music. With both ele
ments (baroque and romantic),
all the literature need not be
played on the same instrument."
Nanney said he plays the ro
mantic organ every Sunday ser
vice, in addition to about 120
weddings and six to eight organ
recitals annually.
"The recitals will be played
more often when the new organ
comes," he said.
An electronic "substitute" or
gan, smaller in size than either
the romantic or baroque organs,
is currently being used and will
be returned to storage once the
installation process has been
completed.
Initial figures for the construc

tion and installation of the
baroque organ were set be
tween $300,000 and $400,000. At
the present time, however, Nan
ney estimates that costs have es
calated to close to $600,000.
As part of the church's $1.63
million reconstruction plan, the
ceiling is currently under resto
ration as well. The synthetic
panels which occupied the ma
jority of the inner roof since the
1920s are being replaced by
redwood boards. According to
Nanney, the boards will provide
superior acoustics for each or
gan's respective music.
"The church is really part of
the organ," said Nanney. "The
redwood is a much better sound
ing board for the organ's re
verberations."
Funding for the project, in
cluding the rebuilding of the
church's north wall and the
moveable console for the new
organ, has come primarily from
three private benefactors. A

donation of $544,000 from the
late George Morell constituted a
large part of the contributions.
An additional $538,000 was given

by the estate of the late Evelyn
Turrentine, and the third dona
tion was an anonymous gift of
$137,000.
