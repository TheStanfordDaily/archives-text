# Computer music: a trend that's caught fire
## 
### Jane Bailie 
In the wake of the well-known
sound track to the Oscar-win
ning motion picture Chariots of
Fire, computer-synthesized mu
sic has experienced a sudden
growth in audience popularity.
John Chowning, professor of
music and director of the Music
Department's Center for Com
puter Research in Music and
Acoustics, commonly referred
to as CCRMA (pronounced
"karma"), attributes this trend to
the fact that "people are curious.
They are surprised at how
elegantly composed it is. It's not
what they expected it to be. The
sounds that are made are very
rich and full."
But both Chowning and
French composer Jean-Claude
Risset agree that their respective
work bears little resemblance to
the musical accompaniment to
Chariots of Fire.
"It (Chariots of Fire) is more
made for movies, though there
are a few similarities," said
Rissett.

"Computer music is more
complex," added Chowning.
"The planning structure is more
controlled. The composition is
really very traditional, though it
may not sound as such."
CCRMA held two concerts in
the Frost Amphitheater on July
16-17, featuring the new music
of CCRMA composers Chris
Chafe, David Jaffe, Janis Mattox,
Michael McNabb, Bill Schot
tstaedt, and Malcolm Singer,
plus works by guest composers
Dexter Morrill, Bruce Pen
nycock and Rissett.
Audience reactions varied.
"Airy ... etherish, transitory,"
described an observer of Satur
day's concert.
"A series of ghost sounds," ex
plained another. "It sounded
like they were warming up their
instruments."
Computer-generated music at
CCRMA originated principally
under the direction of Chown
ing, who came here in 1962 as a
graduate student in composi
tion. In 1963 Chowning became

interested in the work of Max
Matthews (whom Risset refers to
as "the father of computer music
in addition to the July concerts
being dedicated in his name")
who was then involved with the
synthesizing of sound through
the use of computers.
In 1966 Chowning received his
DMA in composition and be
came a faculty member of the
Music Department. He moved
to the DC Power Lab to continue
his research with computer mu
sic, a facility which was con
structed by GTE in the early '60s
and was never fully completed.
The Lab was acquired by Stan
ford and formally housed the
Artificial Intelligence (Al)
Project and the Computer Sci
ence Department.
"Largely as a result of my ex
posure to electronic music in
Paris, I inquired about the possi
bility of electronic music here,"
said Chowning. "There was no
studio, and certainly no interest.
However, Stanford did have a
good computer system for the

time â€” an IBM 7090."
"We needed to use their facil
ities, so we became rather
tenacious parasites," said
Chowning of his early period at
the Power Lab. "(We) worked
mostly at night and on weekends
so as not to abuse our hosts."
In 1975 the computer music
group at the Power Lab was
ready to establish their own pro
gram. "We felt the separation
was necessary because our work
was so different from the usual

Music Department activity," said
Chowning.
The National Science Founda
tion (NSF) provided the program
with a $350,000 grant, and with
the support of Music Depart
ment chairman Albert Cohen,
the Center for Computer Re
search in Music and Acoustics
was established. Cofounders
along with Chowning were John
Grey, Loren Rush and Andy
Moore, now head of audio de
