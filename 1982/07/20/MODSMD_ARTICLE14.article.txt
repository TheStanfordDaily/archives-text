# Computer music: a trend that's caught fire
## 
### Jane Bailie 
In the wake of the well-known
sound track to the Oscar-win
ning motion picture Chariots of
Fire, computer-synthesized mu
sic has experienced a sudden
growth in audience popularity.
John Chowning, professor of
music and director of the Music
Department's Center for Com
puter Research in Music and
Acoustics, commonly referred
to as CCRMA (pronounced
"karma"), attributes this trend to
the fact that "people are curious.
They are surprised at how
elegantly composed it is. It's not
what they expected it to be. The
sounds that are made are very
rich and full."
But both Chowning and
French composer Jean-Claude
Risset agree that their respective
work bears little resemblance to
the musical accompaniment to
Chariots of Fire.
"It (Chariots of Fire) is more
made for movies, though there
are a few similarities," said
Rissett.

"Computer music is more
complex," added Chowning.
"The planning structure is more
controlled. The composition is
really very traditional, though it
may not sound as such."
CCRMA held two concerts in
the Frost Amphitheater on July
16-17, featuring the new music
of CCRMA composers Chris
Chafe, David Jaffe, Janis Mattox,
Michael McNabb, Bill Schot
tstaedt, and Malcolm Singer,
plus works by guest composers
Dexter Morrill, Bruce Pen
nycock and Rissett.
Audience reactions varied.
"Airy ... etherish, transitory,"
described an observer of Satur
day's concert.
"A series of ghost sounds," ex
plained another. "It sounded
like they were warming up their
instruments."
Computer-generated music at
CCRMA originated principally
under the direction of Chown
ing, who came here in 1962 as a
graduate student in composi
tion. In 1963 Chowning became

interested in the work of Max
Matthews (whom Risset refers to
as "the father of computer music
in addition to the July concerts
being dedicated in his name")
who was then involved with the
synthesizing of sound through
the use of computers.
In 1966 Chowning received his
DMA in composition and be
came a faculty member of the
Music Department. He moved
to the DC Power Lab to continue
his research with computer mu
sic, a facility which was con
structed by GTE in the early '60s
and was never fully completed.
The Lab was acquired by Stan
ford and formally housed the
Artificial Intelligence (Al)
Project and the Computer Sci
ence Department.
"Largely as a result of my ex
posure to electronic music in
Paris, I inquired about the possi
bility of electronic music here,"
said Chowning. "There was no
studio, and certainly no interest.
However, Stanford did have a
good computer system for the

time — an IBM 7090."
"We needed to use their facil
ities, so we became rather
tenacious parasites," said
Chowning of his early period at
the Power Lab. "(We) worked
mostly at night and on weekends
so as not to abuse our hosts."
In 1975 the computer music
group at the Power Lab was
ready to establish their own pro
gram. "We felt the separation
was necessary because our work
was so different from the usual

Music Department activity," said
Chowning.
The National Science Founda
tion (NSF) provided the program
with a $350,000 grant, and with
the support of Music Depart
ment chairman Albert Cohen,
the Center for Computer Re
search in Music and Acoustics
was established. Cofounders
along with Chowning were John
Grey, Loren Rush and Andy
Moore, now head of audio de
velopment at Lucasfilm.
Since 1975, CCRMA has re
ceived over $1 million from the
NSF to support its work. "These
grants have been based on the
scientific aspects of our work in
psycho-acoustics and signal
processing," said Chowning.
A number of PhD and DMA
dissertations have evolved from
the work at CCRMA, ranging
from composition and music
theory to signal processing and
psycho-acoustics (how sound is
perceived).
About half of the people cur
rently working at the DC Power
Lab are from other departments,
estimates Chowning, including
psychology, speech and hearing,
computer science and electrical
engineering, the field which
comprises the majority of non
musical students.
"It's difficult to imagine an en
vironment so interdisciplanary,"
said Chowning.
The reputation of CCRMA
soon spread to other parts of the
world, including France, where
composer/conductor Pierre
Boulez asked Chowning to help
him form a similar center in Par
is. This evolved into the current
close relationship between
CCRMA and IRCAM (Intstitut
de Recherche et de Coordi
nation Acoustique-Musique) in
Paris, which Boulez presently
directs.
The first CCRMA concert was
held at the Stanford Art Museum
in 1978, with an attendance of
approximately 450 people. The
first outdoor concert in 1980 at
the DC Power Lab attracted
close to 600 people and the NBC
Nightly News team. The concerts
in July witnessed an audience of
approximately 1500 each, esti
mates Chowning.
The Frost Amphitheater was
chosen, said Chowning, "be
cause we found the music in
volved would sound better there
than in a concert hall. With the

synthesized reverberance
caused by the music's ambiance,
we didn't need the natural re
verberation of an indoor set
ting."
Risset, whose work dominated
the second half of Saturday's
concert, worked with Matthews
at Bell Labs for three years on
computer sound synthesis. He
helped established computer
sound synthesis in Orsay and
Marseilles, and is presently pro
fessor of physics at the Univer
site d'Aix in Marseilles.

"...people are curious. They are surprised at how
elegantly composed it is. It's not what they
expected it to be. The sounds that are made are
very rich and full."

Risset described the process of
creating computer music as "a
process of evolving sound ...
manipulation, research, making
illusion. Numbers are trans
ferred into notes.
"There is a huge variety of
sounds you can produce on the
computer," said Risset. "You can
imitate conventional instru
ments; that is not an ultimate
goal, but it is useful.

"Most are hybrid (pre-rec
orded material played with a live
instrumental or singing accom
paniment) tapes," said Risset.
"That way there is a contact be
tween the two worlds.
"It's much easier to do things
in modern, high-level language
than it was with Fortran or as
sembler, for example. More and
more, the musical idea evolves
from a kind of cyclical interac
tion with the language. One asks
something of the language, and
it yields more than was asked for.

That's not surprising, since the
language represents thousands
of years of thought about
thought."
Chowning plans to release a
record comprised of some of the
music created at CCRMA within
the year, with other albums to
eventually follow.
"It's an important interface
between technology and the
arts," he said.
