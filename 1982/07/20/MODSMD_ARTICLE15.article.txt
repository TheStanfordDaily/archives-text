The Summer Mass Media In
stitute offers its students the op
portunity to explore different
careers in the field of com
munications. According to Jules
Dundes, director of the Mass
Media Institute, the program of
fers hands-on experience for
those who wish to get started in
the mass media field.
The Institute, which requires
no previous experience from its
applicants, is made up of four
separate workshops: broadcast
news, film production, journal
ism, and television production.
Each workshop involves regular
Communications Department
faculty along with working pro
fessionals from the mass media,
so that the student will beableto

combine experience in produc
tion, work with academic
courses.
This summer's program has
drawn 62 students. Dundes, a
former vice-president of CBS
Radio in New York and KCBS San
Francisco Radio, gives two main
reasons for the Institute's attrac
tion. "We have many students
who see the program as a way to
get started in the mass media
field. However, we also have
other people who are consider
ing a change in careers and they
come to Stanford to sample oth
er careers," said Dundes.
While this program is not
unique to the University, it may
be one of the oldest. Its begin
nings date back to 1943. "It
started during the war because

so many men were being taken
off to war. With the men going
off to war, there was a need to
train women for various jobs in
the media," Dundes said.
Because all four workshops
strive for practical experience,
the instructors encourage stu
dents to apply their knowledge.
Bryce Mclntyre, a doctoral stu
dent and a teaching fellow in the
journalism workshop, said, "I
encourage students to cover
public events and to publish
their work in the local news
papers. Some people increase
their experience by becoming
correspondents for different pa
pers."

Prof. Ron Alexander, formerly of
the National Film Board of Cana

da, teaches film writing and pro
duction in the film production
workshop. "The main thrust is a
16-mm film shot silent in black
and white, to which students add
voice, music, and sound effects.
In preparation for this, they do
two exercises in super-8," said
Alexander. "The main purpose is
to bring them to an under
standing as to what constitutes a
film."
While the students are ex
posed to a professionally ex
perienced faculty on campus,
they also have contact with pro
fessionals who are currently in
volved in the industry. Stanford
graduate Richard Heus, an inde
pendent producer from San
Francisco, teaches the technical
side of motion pictures during
the summer at the Institute.
Heus, who has recently writ
ten, directed and produced Feel
ing Good, Feeling Proud, a show
about a mentally retarded ac
tress (PBS, July 25), has sighted
the practical hands-on ex
perience as a good introduction
to film making. "Each student
directs his or her own two
minute film and the pictures are
made with the assistance of their
classmates. The students usually
work on documentaries and dra
matic films," he said.
Mass Media Institute students
give various reasons for spend
ing their summer here. Lisa
Wong of Corvallis, Oregon, a
University of Oregon student, is
involved in the broadcast news
workshop. Besides writing, pro

ducing, and anchoring their own
newscasts, the broadcast news
students also meet in the studios
of KPIX-TV in San Francisco on
Sundays. "I'm interested in
being a producer for a television
station and I thought it would be
a good opportunity to learn how
to do a news show," said Wong.
Patty Palmer of Washington,
D.C., a student at Cornell Uni
versity, is involved in the tele
vision production workshop. "It
is a fantastic experience and I'm
getting hands-on experience in
operating cameras, lighting, and
editing equipment. Also, the in
structors are patient and thor
ough in teaching the basic tech
nical operations of the equip
ment," Palmer said.
Diana Fedinec of Memphis,
Tennessee, is also involved in the
television production workshop
and recently received her mas
ters degree in communications
from Northwestern University.
"I'm enjoying the workshop. We
are taught the technical aspects
of production as well as the aca
demics of the industry, Also, i'or
studio productions, we use the
television studios at California
State University, Hayward," said
Fedinec.
To be considered for ad
mission, a student must have
completed a minimum of two
years of college or be over 25
years of age. Enrollment in each
workshop is limited.
"I frequently have testimony
from past students that the pro
gram was worthwhile.

fessionals who are currently in
volved in the industry. Stanford
graduate Richard Heus, an inde
pendent producer from San
Francisco, teaches the technical
side of motion pictures during
the summer at the Institute.
Heus, who has recently writ
ten, directed and produced Feel
ing Good, Feeling Proud, a show
about a mentally retarded ac
tress (PBS, July 25), has sighted
the practical hands-on ex
perience as a good introduction
to film making. "Each student
directs his or her own two
minute film and the pictures are
made with the assistance of their
classmates. The students usually
work on documentaries and dra
matic films," he said.
Mass Media Institute students
give various reasons for spend
ing their summer here. Lisa
Wong of Corvallis, Oregon, a
University of Oregon student, is
involved in the broadcast news
workshop. Besides writing, pro

ducing, and anchoring their own
newscasts, the broadcast news
students also meet in the studios
of KPIX-TV in San Francisco on
Sundays. "I'm interested in
being a producer for a television
station and I thought it would be
a good opportunity to learn how
to do a news show," said Wong.
Patty Palmer of Washington,
D.C., a student at Cornell Uni
versity, is involved in the tele
vision production workshop. "It
is a fantastic experience and I'm
getting hands-on experience in
operating cameras, lighting, and
editing equipment. Also, the in
structors are patient and thor
ough in teaching the basic tech
nical operations of the equip
ment," Palmer said.
Diana Fedinec of Memphis,
Tennessee, is also involved in the
television production workshop
and recently received her mas
ters degree in communications
from Northwestern University.
"I'm enjoying the workshop. We
are taught the technical aspects
of production as well as the aca
demics of the industry, Also, i'or
studio productions, we use the
television studios at California
State University, Hayward," said
Fedinec.
To be considered for ad
mission, a student must have
completed a minimum of two
years of college or be over 25
