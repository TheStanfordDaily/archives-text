# Legislation helps domestic violence victims
## 
### Karen Springen 
During the past two weeks,
three major bills designed to in
crease legal protection for vic
tims of domestic violence have
passed the state legislature, ac
cording to Anne Wuri, com
munity educator at the Mid-Pen
insula Support Network. The leg
islation, which will become ef
fective jan. 1, 1983, affects fund
ing of shelters, terms of child
custody, and length of restrain
ing orders.
A bill (A 83650) authored by
Assemblyman Byron Sher (D-
Palo Alto) lengthens the dura
tion of domestic violence re
straining orders from 90 days to
one year. Restraining orders
prohibit the batterer from com
ing into contact with his victim.
According to Sher, this ex
panded protection will provide a
"cooling-off period" and give

victims time to relocate and es
tablish themselves without har
rassment from former cohabi
tants. Presently, general harass
ment restraining orders are ef
fective for up to three years
while domestic violence orders
last 90 days.
Wuri said, "There are many,
many laws now throughout the
country which can give women
protection. They're often not
enforced. The advantage of a re
straining order is that a women
can act as her own attorney. It's a
fairly inexpensive way of getting
protection. If she goes to an at
torney, it's going to cost a lot of
money."
The principal bill (SB1330), au
thored by Sen. Robert Presley,
increased the tax on marriage
license fees from $8 to $13. The
revenues provide funding for
five regional organizations for

domestic violence shelters,
three of which are in Santa Clara
County.
The third bill (A 83569), au
thored by Gwen Moore, an as
semblywoman from Southern
California, includes provisions
for considering whether or not a
restraining order exists when
judges rule on child custody and
visitation.
Reported cases
Sher said, "though many inci
dents are never reported, 3.8
million cases (of domestic vio
lence) went on record in the
United States in 1981. The Mid-
Peninsula Support Network,
which serves domestic violence
victims in Santa Clara County,
reports 50 new incidents each
month."
According to graduated sen
ior Karen Haubrich, a volunteer
at the Mid-Peninsula Support
Network, reported cases of bat
tering have increased. She said
women reported 400 cases in the
first half of 1980, up from 400 to
tal cases in 1979. The Network
served 849 women in 1981.
Wuri said the increase in re
ported cases from 25 women per
month two years ago to 70 per
month now does not necessarily
indicate an increase in the fre
quency of battering.
"Right now there's a lot of un
employment, but we need to be
very careful attaching the two
things. Two years ago people
didn't know there was some
thing to be done about it. Now
more people are calling us," she
said.
In 1976 the FBI estimated that a
woman is battered every 18 sec
onds. The study also concluded
that battering is three times
more frequent than rape and
that only one out of 10 rapes are
reported. Wuri stressed that bat
tering is even more prevalent

than these statistics indicate.
"We know that only about one
battering out of 700 comes to the
attention of the police."
Haubrich said that battering
crosses over economic barriers.
"It almost gets more prevalent as
it (class) goes higher up because
there's more stress."
According to Wuri, a study
completed seven years ago
found that physical abuse was
more prevalent in families
whose members had graduated
from high school and college

than in families with little or no
high school education. "The au
thor of the study postulated that
it has to do with expectations,"
said Wuri. She stressed that bat
tering can happen to anybody
and that it is going on all the
time.
Battered students
"There's a lot of battering
going on right now in dating re
lationships," said Wuri. "Of the
people interviewed (in a recent
survey), one out of five had been
involved in a violent dating rela
tionship. Battered women are

not only battered wives. We've
had several people from Stan
ford call. That's something that
we haven't been aware of
before."

sistance list.
Haubrich said the center acts
as a "legal advocate."
"It (battering) is a solvable
problem," she stressed. The
short-term solution involves get
ting the women out of the vi
olent situation while the long
term solution calls for social
change, she added.

ing orders.
A bill (A 83650) authored by
Assemblyman Byron Sher (D-
Palo Alto) lengthens the dura
tion of domestic violence re
straining orders from 90 days to
one year. Restraining orders
prohibit the batterer from com
ing into contact with his victim.
According to Sher, this ex
panded protection will provide a
"cooling-off period" and give

victims time to relocate and es
tablish themselves without har
rassment from former cohabi
tants. Presently, general harass
ment restraining orders are ef
fective for up to three years
while domestic violence orders
last 90 days.
Wuri said, "There are many,
many laws now throughout the
country which can give women
protection. They're often not
enforced. The advantage of a re
straining order is that a women
can act as her own attorney. It's a
fairly inexpensive way of getting
protection. If she goes to an at
torney, it's going to cost a lot of
money."
The principal bill (SB1330), au
thored by Sen. Robert Presley,
increased the tax on marriage
license fees from $8 to $13. The
revenues provide funding for
five regional organizations for

domestic violence shelters,
three of which are in Santa Clara
County.
The third bill (A 83569), au
thored by Gwen Moore, an as
semblywoman from Southern
California, includes provisions
for considering whether or not a
restraining order exists when
judges rule on child custody and
visitation.
Reported cases
Sher said, "though many inci
dents are never reported, 3.8
million cases (of domestic vio
lence) went on record in the
United States in 1981. The Mid-
Peninsula Support Network,
which serves domestic violence
victims in Santa Clara County,
reports 50 new incidents each
month."
According to graduated sen
ior Karen Haubrich, a volunteer
at the Mid-Peninsula Support
Network, reported cases of bat
tering have increased. She said
women reported 400 cases in the
first half of 1980, up from 400 to
tal cases in 1979. The Network
served 849 women in 1981.
Wuri said the increase in re
ported cases from 25 women per
month two years ago to 70 per
month now does not necessarily
indicate an increase in the fre
quency of battering.
"Right now there's a lot of un
employment, but we need to be
very careful attaching the two
things. Two years ago people
didn't know there was some
thing to be done about it. Now
more people are calling us," she
said.
In 1976 the FBI estimated that a
woman is battered every 18 sec
onds. The study also concluded
that battering is three times
more frequent than rape and
that only one out of 10 rapes are
reported. Wuri stressed that bat
tering is even more prevalent

COUNSELING — A client off the Mid-Peninsula Support
Network receives help from a volunteer. The center, which
was founded In 1978, provides a number off services to vic
tims of domestic violence including legal help, counseling, a

One off three counseling centers in Santa Clara County, the
center reports 50 new incidents of domestic violence each

than these statistics indicate.
"We know that only about one
battering out of 700 comes to the
attention of the police."
Haubrich said that battering
crosses over economic barriers.
"It almost gets more prevalent as
it (class) goes higher up because
there's more stress."
According to Wuri, a study
completed seven years ago
found that physical abuse was
more prevalent in families
whose members had graduated
from high school and college

than in families with little or no
high school education. "The au
thor of the study postulated that
it has to do with expectations,"
said Wuri. She stressed that bat
tering can happen to anybody
and that it is going on all the
time.
Battered students
"There's a lot of battering
going on right now in dating re
lationships," said Wuri. "Of the
people interviewed (in a recent
survey), one out of five had been
involved in a violent dating rela
tionship. Battered women are

not only battered wives. We've
had several people from Stan
ford call. That's something that
we haven't been aware of
before."
Support Network
The center, which has been
providing services to beaten
women since 1978, provides le
gal and counseling services, a 24-
hour hotline, a live-in shelter,
aid in obtaining temporary re
straining orders, and a legal as
sistance list.
Haubrich said the center acts
as a "legal advocate."
"It (battering) is a solvable
problem," she stressed. The
short-term solution involves get
ting the women out of the vi
olent situation while the long
term solution calls for social
change, she added.
In addition to the three bat
tered women's shelters, the
Domestic Violence Information
Desk sponsored by the Santa
Clara County Bar Association in
San Jose provides information
for people who have restraining
orders.

During the past two weeks,
three major bills designed to in
crease legal protection for vic
tims of domestic violence have
passed the state legislature, ac
cording to Anne Wuri, com
munity educator at the Mid-Pen
insula Support Network. The leg
islation, which will become ef
fective jan. 1, 1983, affects fund
ing of shelters, terms of child
custody, and length of restrain
ing orders.
