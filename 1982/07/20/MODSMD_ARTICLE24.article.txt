## BSF distracted from the big time 
### Mike Hale 
The Berkeley Shakespeare
Festival is currently staging The
Tragedy of Antony, and
Cleopatra in the midst of an ur
ban forest — Berkeley's John
Hinkel Park. The park's am
phitheatre is a wonderful place
to spend a summer's evening;
unfortunately, the production in
question is anything but a mid
summer night's dream.
The Hinkel Park am
phitheatre, home of the festival
since its inception in 1974, is very
steep — each row is several feet
above the one before it — and
trees and earth rise up around
three sides of the stage, so that
there are no wings or backstage
area. It would seem to demand a
bare-bones approach to
Shakespeare and a concentra
tion on his language, things the
festival has been known for over
the years. Director Patrick
Tucker has tricked up Antony
and Cleopatra, however, and
made it as high-tech and busy
and colorful as he could given
the amphitheatre's limitations.
The result is a production that's
never boring, but also never en
gages the audience on any level
but the farcical — it inspires far
more laughter than a tragedy
ever should.
This production is staged in
the way you might expect John
(Animal House) Landis, or the
Stephen Spielberg of 7947, to ap
proach a play — choice scenes
from it coyld be assembled into
a great frat party (or Saturday
Night Live) skit. The meeting of
Antony, Octavius, and Pompey,
which in the text is both a
drunken brawl and a tightly
structured round of flattery and
deceit, here becomes all brawl

— the spectacle of grown men
prancing around stage,
snatching at each other's tunics,
bellowing and bawling and col
lapsing amidst the food (so that
fruit rolls around underfoot) is
so fascinating that when the
scene is over, you suddenly re
alize you have no idea what was
said. And throughout the play,
every line that can in any way be
construed as a sexual quibble is
read that way, with much wink
ing and elbowing among the
men and tittering among the
women.
Tucker has adapted to the am
phitheatre's configuration by
having the entire cast on view
most of the time — the charac
ters who aren't in a given scene
sit on benches alongside, and
slightly below, the raised stage.
They observe the action, and
when one of them is referred to
on-stage, he or she is often spot
lighted and must silently react in
character, a ploy that is needless
ly distracting. Even more distrac
ting was the music (composed by
Stephen Weinstock) the off
stage characters played, which
several times drowned out the
speech on stage. Most distract
ing of all was the habit several
characters had of making faces
in response to the quality of the
acting on stage.
' The stage itself is impressive,
on first sight. In keeping with
Tucker's program note, which
labels one theme of the play as
that of finding "a balance be
tween extremes" of masculinity
and femininity, reason and in
stinct, the stage is bisected
diagonally by a ditch (whether it
represents the Nile or the Medi
terranean is left to our imagina
tions) about six inches wide and

filled with real water. On one
side of it, in the corner of the
stage, is a small pyramid; on the
other side, in the opposite cor
ner, is a fountain. When a flame
burns atop the pyramid, we're in
Egypt; when the fountain
spouts, we're in Rome. How
ever, the stage is so small that this
spatial organization can't be
used to comment on the action,
or advance the themes, in any
way; scenes are played across
the width and depth of the stage,
with no regard for national
boundaries. This also forces the
characters to endlessly cross and
recross the "sea," leaving the au
dience with the constant fear
that someone will get their feet
wet.
Just as pointless are the black
metal poles, resembling those
used by junior high pole
vaulters, which are used here as
spears, stretchers, and scenery.
These multiple uses mean the ac
tors are always handling the
poles — picking them up, put
ting them down, building a 20-
foot pyramid out of them — and
the subsequent clinks and clanks
of metal are another in the long
list of distractions.
Several performers struggle
valiantly against the messy,
flashy atmosphere of the pro
duction. Luckily, Tony Amen
dola, who plays Antony, is one of
these. What little genuine emo
tion we see, tragic or otherwise,
is contained in his dignified per
formance, Julian Lopez-
Morillas, playing Octavius, and
Luis Oropeza, as Enobarbus, also
bring the production badly
needed professionalism. On the
other hand, Nancy Houfek is a
disaster as Cleopatra. The situ
ation isn't her fault — Tucker has

made her into a California beach
baby, who totally lacks the car
riage or manner of a queen. She
spends the first three-quarters of
the play pouting and flouncing,
and periodically drags Antony to
the floor. It's very hard to under
stand why wars could be fought
for the love of this floozy.
The Berkeley Shakespeare
Festival has been approaching
the big time for nine years now.
Productions like this won't move
it any closer.
