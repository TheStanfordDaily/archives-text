Cluster bomb shipment halted
Washington — President Ronald Reagan yesterday
halted the scheduled shipment of 4,000 cluster bombs to
Israel pending an administration study of whether such
weapons have been used improperly in Lebanon.
White House spokesman Larry Speakes said the cluster
bomb study is part of an overall review of whether Israel,
during its invasion of Lebanon, has violated various
agreements with the United States that govern use of
American-supplied weapons.
Speakes also disclosed that Reagan has held up pro
ceedings for a planned sale to Israel of 75 advanced F-16
warplanes, scheduled to be delivered in 1985.
In late May, just before the Israeli invasion, the White
House announced that the administration had notified
Congress of its intention to sell the planes. But yesterday,
as the U.S. government continued to pressure Israel to
make peace in Lebanon, Speakes said the president ac
tually had not sent the formal notification to Congress
and has not decided when to do so.
Additionally, Speakes, reading from prepared notes,
said "we're not satisfied" and "do not look with favor"
on the Israeli Army's blocking of caravans bringing
emergency food supplies to besieged citizens in West
Beirut.
Mitsubishi indicted for IBM theft
San Francisco — A federal grand jury indicted
Mitsubishi Electric Corp. of Japan and four of its employ
ees yesterday on charges of conspiring to transport sto
len IBM trade secrets.
Besides the corporation, those named included Takay
Ishida, 40, Torrance, Calif., an employee of Mitsubishi
Electronics America Inc.; Kazuma Ban, Chiyoji Tanaka,
and Akira Iwase, all in Japan and employees of
Mitsubishi Electric Corp.
Mitsubishi quickly denied any wrongdoing in a
statement shortly after the indictment was returned in
San Jose and announced simultaneously in San Francis
co.
"Mitsubishi Electric Corp. emphatically denies that it
or any of its employees has been involved in any un
lawful conduct," the company statement said.
Mitsubishi said it "intends to defend itself and its em
ployees vigorously."
The same four employees were named in a complaint
filed in San Francisco June 22 on the same charge of con
spiring to obtain confidential information of Interna
tional Business Machines Corp. to assist Mitshubishi in
developing computers and related equipment. Yester
day's indictment was the first indictment against
Mitsubishi.
PLO, Israeli conflict continues
Beirut, Lebanon — Israelis and Palestinians exchanged
artillery fire and Israeli jets flew over tense West Beirut as
secret talks continued yesterday, apparently without
progress, in an effort to find a way out of the city for the
Palestine Liberation Organization.
The artillery and light weapon exchanges were sporad
ic, and the jets flew over the city in both the morning and

From the wire* of the Auoclaltd Frew and the Lot Angctct Tlme»/Waihlngton rort Newt Service

afternoon. At about 5 p.m., Israeli jets made six passes
over the southern section of the city, where the Palesti
nian population is concentrated. Each flight came in low
er than the one before.
In the negotiations, U.S. special envoy Philip Habib
met for an hour yesterday with Lebanon's top leadership
but none of the participants would disclose what went
on.
The talks seemed to be on hold, however, as diplomats
waited to hear the results of President Ronald Reagan's
meeting in Washington today with the foreign ministers
of Syria and Saudi Arabia.
It is hoped here that Reagan will be able to convince
the Syrians to change their minds and allow the 6000 PLO
gut rrillas trapped in West Beirut by the Israeli invaders
to be evacuated to Syria.
As part of a settlement in Lebanon, Israel insists that
the PLO fighters leave the country. It had been widely
assumed for weeks that they would go to Syria. On June
9, however, Syria said it would not admit the guerrillas.
Poverty strikes more Americans
Washington — Nearly 2.2 million Americans joined
the poverty ranks last year, and real median family in
come dropped 3.5 percent, the Census Bureau reported
yesterday.
It was the second year in a row that the income of
American families failed to gain on inflation, according
to the survey of 62,000 households.
Median family income in 1981 was $22,390, the bureau
said, 6.5 percent more than in 1980. However, after ad
justing for the rise in consumer prices, it was 3.5 percent
below the 1980 level.
That decline, however, was less than the 5.5 percent
drop in median family income between 1979 and 1980.
Meanwhile, the number of Americans below the pov
erty level increased from 29.6 million in 1980 to 31.8 mil
lion in 1981. This occurred even though the poverty
threshold for a family of four rose from $8414 to $9287 in
the same period.
"Among the factors contributing to the increase in
poverty were the recession that began in mid-1981 and
the associated rise in the unemployment rate," the re
port said.
This rise in poverty was widespread, the study said,
with increases in the number of poor among both blacks
and whites. However, there was no significant change in
the number of poor people of Hispanic origin.
Iraqis bomb western Iran
Tehran — The Iraqi air force, after a two-day lull,
bombed the western Iranian towns of llam and Khor
ramabad yesterday, killing five people and wounding
about 50, sources here said.
Analysts noted the attacks on the towns, 30 miles and
60 miles respectively from the border, were launched
without apparent military or economic objectives. The
strikes hit about 250 miles from the southern sector,
where the main front is situated.
Iraq staged a similar attack on Hamadan in western
Iran last Friday, in which Iran said 97 were killed.
Iran launched its invasion of Iraq last Tuesday night,

moving hostilities onto Iraqi territory for the first time in
the 22-month Persian Gulf war.
Tehran Radio, citing military sources at the front, re
ported a further Iraqi counterattack in the western sec
tor of the southern front in Iraq beginning at dawn yes
terday. The radio said Iranian forces repelled the attack.
Saudis call on U.S. to support PLO
Washington — Saudi Arabian Foreign Minister Saud
Faisal called on the United States yesterday to endorse
Palestinian self-determination and begin dealing direct
ly with the Palestine Liberation Organization to create
conditions for a negotiated settlement of the conflict in
Lebanon.
Saud's statement came as he and Syrian Foreign Min
ister Abdul Halim Khaddam held preliminary talks at the
State Department before today's much-heralded White
House meeting at which an official Arab request for Is
raeli withdrawal is to be presented to President Ronald
Reagan.
U.S. officials have expressed hope that the visit of the
two foreign ministers can lead to a breakthrough in the
stalled Beirut negotiations over a future home for 5000 to
6000 trapped PLO fighters.
But a two-hour meeting late yesterday of the emissar
ies and Secretary of State George Shultz ended with no
clear sign of movement on any issue.
Saud said he was persuaded of the "good intentions
and motivations" of the United States but announced no
conclusion about U.S. policy. Khaddam said he had
asked the United States to assume its responsibility as "a
country that is extending a huge military, political and
economic assistance to Israel to put an end to Israeli ag
gression." He would notelabaorate.
House opens MX missile debate
Washington — The House opened debate yesterday
on next year's $177.1 billion defense budget with a
bipartisan drive to delay or kil! outright the controversial
MX missile program.
The White House, recognizing that a serious challenge
to the MX program is building in Congress, sent a
lengthy letter to the House leadership arguing that the
MX program is essential to national security and provides
"powerful leverage" in negotiating an arms reduction
treaty with the Soviet Union.
The letter, signed by President Ronald Reagan, was
sent to shore up support for the MX that had been
eroded by the administration's difficulty in finding a
method to base the missile, by rising opposition to nu
clear weapons and by the general concern over the de
fense budget's size, a White House official said yester
day.
The administration's plan to build and deploy the MX
missile has been in trouble in Congress almost since the
day it was unveiled last October as the centerpiece of the
administration's strategic modernization program.
At that time, the administration intended to put the
first 40 MX missiles, which will come off the production
line in 1986, in existing missile silos as an interim basing
plan, and to decide by 1984 on a more permanent meth
od of deploying the new generation of missiles.

ister Abdul Halim Khaddam held preliminary talks at the
State Department before today's much-heralded White
House meeting at which an official Arab request for Is
raeli withdrawal is to be presented to President Ronald
Reagan.
U.S. officials have expressed hope that the visit of the
two foreign ministers can lead to a breakthrough in the
stalled Beirut negotiations over a future home for 5000 to
6000 trapped PLO fighters.
But a two-hour meeting late yesterday of the emissar
ies and Secretary of State George Shultz ended with no
clear sign of movement on any issue.
Saud said he was persuaded of the "good intentions
and motivations" of the United States but announced no
conclusion about U.S. policy. Khaddam said he had
asked the United States to assume its responsibility as "a

House opens MX missile debate
Washington — The House opened debate yesterday
on next year's $177.1 billion defense budget with a
bipartisan drive to delay or kil! outright the controversial
MX missile program.
The White House, recognizing that a serious challenge
to the MX program is building in Congress, sent a
lengthy letter to the House leadership arguing that the
MX program is essential to national security and provides
"powerful leverage" in negotiating an arms reduction
treaty with the Soviet Union.
The letter, signed by President Ronald Reagan, was
sent to shore up support for the MX that had been
eroded by the administration's difficulty in finding a
method to base the missile, by rising opposition to nu
clear weapons and by the general concern over the de
fense budget's size, a White House official said yester
day.
The administration's plan to build and deploy the MX
missile has been in trouble in Congress almost since the
day it was unveiled last October as the centerpiece of the
administration's strategic modernization program.
At that time, the administration intended to put the
first 40 MX missiles, which will come off the production
line in 1986, in existing missile silos as an interim basing
plan, and to decide by 1984 on a more permanent meth
od of deploying the new generation of missiles.
Cluster bomb shipment halted
Washington — President Ronald Reagan yesterday
halted the scheduled shipment of 4,000 cluster bombs to
Israel pending an administration study of whether such
weapons have been used improperly in Lebanon.
White House spokesman Larry Speakes said the cluster
bomb study is part of an overall review of whether Israel,
during its invasion of Lebanon, has violated various
agreements with the United States that govern use of
American-supplied weapons.
Speakes also disclosed that Reagan has held up pro
ceedings for a planned sale to Israel of 75 advanced F-16
warplanes, scheduled to be delivered in 1985.
In late May, just before the Israeli invasion, the White
House announced that the administration had notified
Congress of its intention to sell the planes. But yesterday,
as the U.S. government continued to pressure Israel to
make peace in Lebanon, Speakes said the president ac
tually had not sent the formal notification to Congress
and has not decided when to do so.
Additionally, Speakes, reading from prepared notes,
said "we're not satisfied" and "do not look with favor"
on the Israeli Army's blocking of caravans bringing
emergency food supplies to besieged citizens in West
Beirut.
Mitsubishi indicted for IBM theft
San Francisco — A federal grand jury indicted
Mitsubishi Electric Corp. of Japan and four of its employ
ees yesterday on charges of conspiring to transport sto
len IBM trade secrets.
Besides the corporation, those named included Takay
Ishida, 40, Torrance, Calif., an employee of Mitsubishi
Electronics America Inc.; Kazuma Ban, Chiyoji Tanaka,
and Akira Iwase, all in Japan and employees of
Mitsubishi Electric Corp.
Mitsubishi quickly denied any wrongdoing in a
statement shortly after the indictment was returned in
San Jose and announced simultaneously in San Francis
co.
"Mitsubishi Electric Corp. emphatically denies that it
or any of its employees has been involved in any un
lawful conduct," the company statement said.
Mitsubishi said it "intends to defend itself and its em
ployees vigorously."
The same four employees were named in a complaint
filed in San Francisco June 22 on the same charge of con
spiring to obtain confidential information of Interna
tional Business Machines Corp. to assist Mitshubishi in
developing computers and related equipment. Yester
day's indictment was the first indictment against
Mitsubishi.
PLO, Israeli conflict continues
Beirut, Lebanon — Israelis and Palestinians exchanged
artillery fire and Israeli jets flew over tense West Beirut as
secret talks continued yesterday, apparently without
progress, in an effort to find a way out of the city for the
Palestine Liberation Organization.
The artillery and light weapon exchanges were sporad
ic, and the jets flew over the city in both the morning and

From the wire* of the Auoclaltd Frew and the Lot Angctct Tlme»/Waihlngton rort Newt Service

afternoon. At about 5 p.m., Israeli jets made six passes
over the southern section of the city, where the Palesti
nian population is concentrated. Each flight came in low
er than the one before.
In the negotiations, U.S. special envoy Philip Habib
met for an hour yesterday with Lebanon's top leadership
but none of the participants would disclose what went
on.
The talks seemed to be on hold, however, as diplomats
waited to hear the results of President Ronald Reagan's
meeting in Washington today with the foreign ministers
of Syria and Saudi Arabia.
It is hoped here that Reagan will be able to convince
the Syrians to change their minds and allow the 6000 PLO
gut rrillas trapped in West Beirut by the Israeli invaders
to be evacuated to Syria.
As part of a settlement in Lebanon, Israel insists that
the PLO fighters leave the country. It had been widely
assumed for weeks that they would go to Syria. On June
9, however, Syria said it would not admit the guerrillas.
Poverty strikes more Americans
Washington — Nearly 2.2 million Americans joined
the poverty ranks last year, and real median family in
come dropped 3.5 percent, the Census Bureau reported
yesterday.
It was the second year in a row that the income of
American families failed to gain on inflation, according
to the survey of 62,000 households.
Median family income in 1981 was $22,390, the bureau
said, 6.5 percent more than in 1980. However, after ad
justing for the rise in consumer prices, it was 3.5 percent
below the 1980 level.
That decline, however, was less than the 5.5 percent
drop in median family income between 1979 and 1980.
Meanwhile, the number of Americans below the pov
erty level increased from 29.6 million in 1980 to 31.8 mil
lion in 1981. This occurred even though the poverty
threshold for a family of four rose from $8414 to $9287 in
the same period.
"Among the factors contributing to the increase in
poverty were the recession that began in mid-1981 and
the associated rise in the unemployment rate," the re
port said.
This rise in poverty was widespread, the study said,
with increases in the number of poor among both blacks
and whites. However, there was no significant change in
the number of poor people of Hispanic origin.
Iraqis bomb western Iran
Tehran — The Iraqi air force, after a two-day lull,
bombed the western Iranian towns of llam and Khor
ramabad yesterday, killing five people and wounding
about 50, sources here said.
Analysts noted the attacks on the towns, 30 miles and
60 miles respectively from the border, were launched
without apparent military or economic objectives. The
strikes hit about 250 miles from the southern sector,
where the main front is situated.
Iraq staged a similar attack on Hamadan in western
Iran last Friday, in which Iran said 97 were killed.
Iran launched its invasion of Iraq last Tuesday night,

moving hostilities onto Iraqi territory for the first time in
the 22-month Persian Gulf war.
Tehran Radio, citing military sources at the front, re
ported a further Iraqi counterattack in the western sec
tor of the southern front in Iraq beginning at dawn yes
terday. The radio said Iranian forces repelled the attack.
