### Ray Newman 
The University is now begin
ning to receive library materials
that were ordered last year un
der an acquiring and sharing
program with the University of
California, according to Henry
Lowood, bibliographic specialist
here. The program is now enter
ing its second year.
The nine UC campuses and
the University each contribute
about three percent of their total
book budget to the program.
This totals more than $500,000
annually from the combined UC
campuses and more than $60,000
annually from Stanford.
The money is used to purchase
expensive library materials with
a low anticipated frequency of
use.

Only one or possibly two
copies of each work is
purchased, and kept at a
selected campus. But a biblio
graphic guide for each acquisi
tion is purchased for every cam
pus. Thus a student at any of the
10 participating campuses may
look up information through the
bibliographic guides and have
the desired materials sent to him
through the interlibrary loan sys
tem, according to Lowood.
The materials selected are
"pretty varied," Lowood said.
He said the program purchases
"a lot" of government docu
ments and historical collections,
and also technical materials,
newspapers, and copies of the
personal papers of famous or im
portant people.
UC-Riverside is buying a
group of science fiction period
icals published between 1920
and 1978, Lowood said. The
purchase amounts to over $6000,
he said.
Among the publications the
University will acquire are mi
croform sets of the papers of
Robert Peel, Franz Boas, Eugene
Debs and John Peabody Har
rington, as well as the papers of
the Student Non-Violent Coor
dinating Committee (1959-72)
and the Women's Trade Union
League.

Bibliographers from each
campus' library vote on the
works to be purchased, and then
"we basically add the points up,"
Lowood said.
"About 10 or 20 times" as
many recommendations are
voted on as the program can ac
tually afford to purchase, he
said.
Once the materials are or
dered, the bibliographers de
cide "which campus is the most
appropriate place" for each
item, and bibliographic guides
are sent to the other campuses,
Lowood said.
