## Promising yet fragile recovery for Chrysler 
### 
New York (AP) â€” Chrysler
Corp., struggling back from the
brink of bankruptcy, said yester
day it earned $106.9 million in
the second quarter, five times
better than its profit a year ago
despite a dip in revenue.
Analysts cautioned, however,
that the recovery was a fragile
one, coming on the heels of

more than $2 billion worth of
losses at Chrysler in the last two
years and on the eve of new con
tract talks with the United Auto
Workers union.
Chrysler's second-quarter
earnings compared with a profit
of $20.7 million in the cor
responding 1981 quarter. Reven
ues fell to $2.87 billion from $2.88
billion.
"This second quarter profit is
the result of outstanding auto
motive products selling well in a
lousy market and a man
agement-labor cooperative pro
gram of efficiency and prod

uctivity that is a model for Amer
ican industry," Chairman Lee
lacocca said at a news con
ference.
For the first six months, the
No. 3 automaker earned $256.8
million, compared with a loss of
$268.6 million in the first half of
1981. Chrysler had a profit of
$150 million for the first quarter,
but that came from tax credits
and the sale of Chrysler's de
fense subsidiary which erased an
operating loss of $89 million.
Revenues through the end of
June rose to $5.38 billion from
$5.14 billion. Car sales totaled

397,595, compared with 458,690
in the first six months of 1981.
The other Big Three auto
makers, General Motors Corp.
and Ford Motor Co., have not
yet released their earnings re
ports. But industry analysts were
expecting all three to show a
profit. Chrysler's profit had been
forecast in the range of $50 mil
lion to $100 million.
"It was a magnificent per
formance," Arvid Jouppi, an an
alyst with Detroit-based Colin
Hochstin Co., said of the
Chrysler report. "They've cut
their expenses very deeply. The

New Yorker sold well because of
lower gas prices, and they had
good interest income from in
vesting their money well."
But, Jouppi said, Chrysler still
has obstacles on its road to re
covery, particularly contract
talks with the UAW that open to
day.
Chrysler, faced with a 1980 loss
of $1.7 billion and a $475 million
shortfall in 1981, was forced to
win $800 million worth of con
cessions from its UAW employ
ees and make other cost-cutting
moves in the past two years.
