# Nuclear exports to Argentina authorized
## 
### Washington Post 
Washington — The Reagan
administration has authorized
the export of a computerized
control system for a "sensitive"
facility crucial to Argentina's aim
of nuclear independence.
The move, approved by
Energy Secretary James Edwards
last year after an in
terdepartmental review, is an
other in a series of adminis

tration reversals of Carter admin
istration policies on nuclear ex
ports, and has seriously under
cut a longtime U.S. effort to
pressure Argentina to put its nu
clear program under interna
tional safeguards.
The system of the Foxboro Co.
of Foxboro, Mass., that was ap
proved for export will become
the "brains" of a large heavy-wa
ter plant. A heavy-water plant —

like uranium enrichment and
plutonium reprocessing facil
ities — is classified as a "sensi
tive" technology because it is
the critical element in one route
to production of materials that
could be used in nuclear bombs.
Argentina's acquisition of
such a plant, which is under con
struction at Arroyitos and ex
pected to come on line in 1984,

would appear to take on even
more significance in light of re
cent remarks by Adm. Carlos
Castro Madero, chairman of Ar
gentina's Atomic Energy Com
mission, since the war with Brit
ain over the Falkland Islands.
"Until today, the safeguard
agreements signed by Argentina
have not permitted it to under
take nuclear energy develop
ment for military purposes,"
Castro Madero said in a radio in
terview three weeks ago. "Ar
gentina will comply with all its
obligations, but from now on re

serves the right for itself to un
dertake the development of eu
phemistically so-called non-pro
scribed military uses."
The 1978 Nuclear Non
proliferation Act bans U.S. coop
eration with any country that has
not placed its nuclear activities
under International Atomic
Energy Agency safeguards. But
the Reagan administration was
able to authorize the export to
Argentina because the control
system was ostensibly sold to a
Swiss firm that has the overall
contract for the plant.
