## Commentary/Glen and Shearer Dieting: it may make you thinner, but... 
### 
Washington — There's some
good news and some bad news
from Muscle Beach this summer.
First, the good news: fewer 97-
Ib. weaklings and more Arnold
Schwarzenegger types are
playing in the sand than ever
before. With 46 percent of adult
Americans now getting regular
exercise — and some 9 million
others counting their calories —
few bathers will be mistaken for
beach balls.
In other words, America is get
ting into training, and the sights
are worth seeing.
Now, the bad news: the aver
age American is still 18 percent
overweight. And that burns most
people up.
If these bulletins sound con
tradictory, that's because they
are. While America's obsession
with obesity is no secret, few na
tional concerns have rereived so
generous a helping of half
baked, theoretical mishmash
about how much we should
weigh, how we should diet, and
why.
Our numerous nutritional ex
perts, of course, have more than
a vested interest in feeding
America's fears of fatness. In a
society willing to dish out some
$10 billion for weight-control
programs, any blubber-burning
panacea is worth suggesting.
And, indeed, even a cursory
glance at a bookstore's "nutri
tion and health" shelf reveals
how today's diet books read
much like "Let's Go, U.S.A."
There's the Scarsdale, the
Southampton, the Cambridge,
the Beverly Hills and the I Love
New York diets. Weight-watch
ing is no longer a simple ques
tion of saying "no thanks" to
seconds. One could, in fact, easi
ly spend more time and energy
choosing a diet than following
one.
Admittedly, thanks to this
genre, we've learned to dist
inguish "happy" foods from
"sad" foods. We've con
templated the psychology of
starch and the meaning of meat,
and argued about the safety of
eggs and the wisdom of fiber.
One thing remains constant: we
love to eat, have got to be thin,
and will chew on any advice that
lets us do both.
A recent poll, for example,
asked women which aspect of
their lives they'd most like to
change, including sexist treat
ment, low salaries, vulnerability
to rape, poverty, fatness, illness,
wife abuse, pollution or the
threat of nuclear war. More than
half the respondents answered:
"my weight."
In the fast-paced, success-rid
den corridors of Wall Street,
even men battle the bulge by
carting their own salad dressings
to work (when they're not out
on three-martini lunches). Thin
ness, after all — no matter how
one gets there — means success
and affluence for both sexes.
The fact that we measure our
worth on the bathroom scale is a
curious commentary about our
values. We could easily become
a society that's never looked bet
ter, but also one that's never felt
worse.
Cigarette smoking, for exam
ple, has become a common
means for teenage girls to curb
their appetites; recent cigarette
ads testify to the tobacco in

dustry's awareness of this.
Meanwhile, bogus diet pills and
food regimens — such as the
Beverly Hills and the liquid pro
tein diets — can cause disorders
from diarrhea to ketosis in some
people, and provide little or no
nutrition.
Indeed, while we hope that
thinness will make life easier, we
may not enjoy the time that's
left. Too often we hear of funer
als when an observant relatives
pops up, "Too bad Uncle Bill's
dead. He never looked so
good."
