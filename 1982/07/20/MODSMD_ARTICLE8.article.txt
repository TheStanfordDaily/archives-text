## Disarmament session proves unfruitful 
### 
The United Nation's Second
Special Session on Disarmament
ended sourly last week. A month
after the U.S. peace movement
was infused with hope and
energy at vast support rallies in
New York and San Francisco, the
session dissolved without touch
ing a long list of disarmament
proposals. Accusations are flying
at the UN: talk of another dis
armament session — in four
years, or nine — inspires bitter
ness because 1986 may be too
late to negotiate, enact, or en
force an end to the weapons
crisis.
It is not so important that
things went wrong at the session,
though many things did go
wrong. More significantly,
things were wrong from the
start. The world's political
climate, attitudes of powerful
states, and the situation at the
UN itself worked against real dis
armament progress even before
the delegates convened.
Today's conflicts between the
East and West, the North and
South, and in Lebanon, the
Malvinas, and Central America
made the world of the 1978 First
Special Session seem relaxed,
even stable. Third Worlders
brought up these conflicts, and
pressed to link nuclear weapons

industries to underdevelopment
and dominance in their own re
gions. Why, after all, should the
Lebanese be silent? Who blames
Zambians for bringing up South
African aggression? And who
would not feel afraid, noting the
state of U.S.-Soviet relations as
reflected in President Ronald
Reagan's speech? The president
pointedly ignored a heartening
Soviet pledge to abstain from
first use of nuclear weapons.
"We need deeds, not words,
to convince us of Soviet sincer
ity," he said two days after the
USSR made its unilateral prom
ise. Reagan, ironically, came to
the session with his übiquitous
Little Black Box, which contains
the hardware to launch a nuclear
war.
At the president's behest, the
U.S. delegation was no less
trucluent. Hintsof troubleahead
came in early June, when the
State and Justice Departments
blocked the entry into the U.S.
of some 350 representatives of
non-governmental organiza
tions. Many of those denied visas
were Japanese who wished to
tell about life in post-nuclear
cities. More unease was gener
ated by a six-day delay on the
part of the United States to name
its delegation.

When the team finally took its
seat it included the president of
the Heritage Foundation, a con
servative think-tank which sus
pects the UN, opposes arms con
trol, and is horrified by the pros
pect of disarmament, it brings to
mind this administration's habit
of choosing people who want to
dismember government agen
cies to head those very agencies.
The U.S. delegation was all
that arrogant Americans are re
puted to be. Procedural stalling,
straw issues, and squabbles over
wording served to exhaust ev
eryone and prevent any real
work from being done until the
last frantic weeks. Others, un
fortunately, also undermined
the session. NATO scheduled a
summit that conflicted, and
Margaret Thatcher stuck to her
anachronistic policy of de
terrence through nuclear stock
piles, going as to join Rea
gan in belittling the Soviet
pledge. The USSR drew criticism
for stifling peace demonstra
tions in major Soviet cities, and
because it has not cooperated
with UN inquiries about
chemical warfare preparations.
As a force for peace, the UN
itself is undermined because it
lacks a constituency. Yet is is the
only existing governmental,
multilateral organization that
will or can take up disarmament.
Unfortunately, the delegation
set-up disenfranchised two im
portant groups.
On the one hand, less affluent
nations with small delegations
could not send representatives
to more than two or three work
ing committees at a time. These
nations had to choose which is
sues to work on, and to hope
that like-minded nations would
hold up their end in other com
mittees.
On the other hand, there was
a proliferation of well-informed,
hard-working women and men
who were on the outside look
ing in, as international repre

sentatives of religious, educa
tion, pacifist, and women's
groups. The one day that non
governmental organizations
were given to address delegates
aptly symbolized what hap
pened at the session to the con
cerns of the world's people who
want peace: non-governmental
representatives addressed a
nearly empty hall. And despite
repeated requests, no formal, le
gitimized role for non-gov
ernmental organizations was
written into the one accomplish
ment of the session, the plan for
an educational world disarma
ment campaign.
In every crisis — including the
weapons crisis — there is op
portunity. Perhaps the session
was a successful failure simply
because so many non-gov
ernmental representatives and
non-aligned delegates got their
fill of empty rhetoric. Pictures of
children at Nagasaki and families
leaving the Bikini Islands testing
sites seemed more powerful,
more infuriating than ever.
Women and men returned
home angry, frustrated, willing
to work harder. "If our message
doesn't get through today then
we must do what we are doing
today again and again," Coretta
Scott King told the crowds at
Central Park a month ago, and
that will wasstrengthened by the
session.
A test ban treaty, nuclear
freeze, arms reductions, global
no-first-use policy, nuclear-free
zones, enforcement mecha
nisms, demilitarization of space
and oceans, and regulation of
chemical and conventional
weapons proliferation are all
possible still, but there is much
work to be done.
Above all, our governments
must be disarmed by steady
pressure to negotiate in good
faith.

its delegation.

When the team finally took its
seat it included the president of
the Heritage Foundation, a con
servative think-tank which sus
pects the UN, opposes arms con
trol, and is horrified by the pros
pect of disarmament, it brings to

of choosing people who want to
dismember government agen
cies to head those very agencies.
The U.S. delegation was all
that arrogant Americans are re
puted to be. Procedural stalling,
straw issues, and squabbles over
wording served to exhaust ev
eryone and prevent any real
work from being done until the
last frantic weeks. Others, un
fortunately, also undermined
the session. NATO scheduled a
summit that conflicted, and
Margaret Thatcher stuck to her
anachronistic policy of de
terrence through nuclear stock
piles, going as to join Rea
gan in belittling the Soviet
pledge. The USSR drew criticism
for stifling peace demonstra
tions in major Soviet cities, and
because it has not cooperated
with UN inquiries about
chemical warfare preparations.
As a force for peace, the UN
itself is undermined because it
lacks a constituency. Yet is is the
only existing governmental,
multilateral organization that
will or can take up disarmament.
Unfortunately, the delegation
set-up disenfranchised two im
portant groups.
On the one hand, less affluent
nations with small delegations
could not send representatives
to more than two or three work
ing committees at a time. These
nations had to choose which is
sues to work on, and to hope
that like-minded nations would
hold up their end in other com
mittees.
On the other hand, there was
a proliferation of well-informed,
hard-working women and men
who were on the outside look
ing in, as international repre

sentatives of religious, educa
tion, pacifist, and women's
groups. The one day that non
governmental organizations
were given to address delegates
aptly symbolized what hap
pened at the session to the con
cerns of the world's people who
want peace: non-governmental
representatives addressed a
nearly empty hall. And despite
repeated requests, no formal, le
gitimized role for non-gov
ernmental organizations was
written into the one accomplish
ment of the session, the plan for
an educational world disarma
ment campaign.
In every crisis — including the
weapons crisis — there is op
portunity. Perhaps the session
was a successful failure simply
because so many non-gov
ernmental representatives and
non-aligned delegates got their
fill of empty rhetoric. Pictures of
children at Nagasaki and families
leaving the Bikini Islands testing
sites seemed more powerful,
more infuriating than ever.
Women and men returned
home angry, frustrated, willing
to work harder. "If our message
doesn't get through today then
we must do what we are doing
today again and again," Coretta
Scott King told the crowds at
Central Park a month ago, and
that will wasstrengthened by the
session.
A test ban treaty, nuclear
freeze, arms reductions, global
no-first-use policy, nuclear-free
zones, enforcement mecha
nisms, demilitarization of space
and oceans, and regulation of
chemical and conventional
weapons proliferation are all
possible still, but there is much
work to be done.
Above all, our governments
must be disarmed by steady
pressure to negotiate in good
faith.

The United Nation's Second
Special Session on Disarmament
ended sourly last week. A month
after the U.S. peace movement
was infused with hope and
energy at vast support rallies in
New York and San Francisco, the
session dissolved without touch
ing a long list of disarmament
proposals. Accusations are flying
at the UN: talk of another dis
armament session — in four
years, or nine — inspires bitter
ness because 1986 may be too
late to negotiate, enact, or en
force an end to the weapons
crisis.
It is not so important that
things went wrong at the session,
though many things did go
wrong. More significantly,
things were wrong from the
start. The world's political
climate, attitudes of powerful
states, and the situation at the
UN itself worked against real dis
armament progress even before
the delegates convened.
Today's conflicts between the
East and West, the North and
South, and in Lebanon, the
Malvinas, and Central America
made the world of the 1978 First
Special Session seem relaxed,
even stable. Third Worlders
brought up these conflicts, and
pressed to link nuclear weapons

industries to underdevelopment
and dominance in their own re
gions. Why, after all, should the
Lebanese be silent? Who blames
Zambians for bringing up South
African aggression? And who
would not feel afraid, noting the
state of U.S.-Soviet relations as
reflected in President Ronald
Reagan's speech? The president
pointedly ignored a heartening
Soviet pledge to abstain from
first use of nuclear weapons.
"We need deeds, not words,
to convince us of Soviet sincer
ity," he said two days after the
USSR made its unilateral prom
ise. Reagan, ironically, came to
the session with his übiquitous
Little Black Box, which contains
the hardware to launch a nuclear
war.
At the president's behest, the
U.S. delegation was no less
trucluent. Hintsof troubleahead
came in early June, when the
State and Justice Departments
blocked the entry into the U.S.
of some 350 representatives of
non-governmental organiza
tions. Many of those denied visas
were Japanese who wished to
tell about life in post-nuclear
cities. More unease was gener
ated by a six-day delay on the
part of the United States to name
its delegation.

When the team finally took its
seat it included the president of
the Heritage Foundation, a con
servative think-tank which sus
pects the UN, opposes arms con
trol, and is horrified by the pros
pect of disarmament, it brings to
