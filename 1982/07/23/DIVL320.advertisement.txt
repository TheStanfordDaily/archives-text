INDIA
RESTAURANT
Gaylord India Restaurant in Palo Alto is a member
of a distinguished and famous international restaurant
family with branches throughout the world's major cities,
including Bombay, Hong Kong, London, New York,
Chicago, and San Francisco.
With chefs trained in New Delhi, we prepare all types
of Indian cuisine, emphasing northern style "Tandoori
cooking. This method uses special clay ovens called
"Tandoor," fired by charcoal and kept over 750°. Lean
cuts of lamb and chicken, prawns, and fish are seared
quickly and cleanly in the Tandoor ovens. The high temp
erature locks in flavors of marinades and spices, making
meats tender and succulent. We also feature a larger
assortment of fresh breads cooked in our Tandoor ovens.
Let us give you the "Maharaja Experience.'
