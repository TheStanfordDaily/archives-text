## Schmidt supports French pipeline position 
### 
San Francisco (AP) â€” Following the French decision to
help the Soviet Union build a natural gas pipeline to
Western Europe, West German Chancellor Helmut
Schmidt said yesterday he agrees with France's opposi
tion to a U.S.-backed technology boycott of the pipeline
project.
Schmidt, who is a house guest of new U.S. Secretary of
State George Shultz, said he regarded the pipeline issue
as a "medium-size" breach in the relationship between
European governments and the United States.
Consular officials said the trip was largely a vacation,
planned long before Shultz' appointment. But Schmidt
met with World Bank president A.W. Clausen before an
afternoon news conference and a private dinner with

the Bay Area Council at San Francisco's Fairmont Hotel.
The visiting leader told reporters in San Francisco that
he would like to see President Ronald Reagan stop U.S.
efforts to impose a blockade on the use of U.S.-de
veloped technology on the pipeline. But he said he
didn't think a change was "very likely.
"I agree with the French, the same attitude that's been
taken by the British government, the French govern
ment and my government," Schmidt said. He said he did
not know if West Germany would change its position on
the issue.
French President Francois Mitterand said yesterday
that France "cannot accept the unilateral measures
taken by the United States on June 18."
The Reagan administration last month expanded sane

tions on exports of oil and gas equipment to the Soviet
Union to include equipment produced abroad under
U.S. licenses. The sanctions were aimed at punishing the
Soviets for imposing martial law in Poland in December.
Schmidt's remarks came as he started a brief round of
meetings and speeches in the San Francisco Bay area
prior to a private weekend encampment at the exclusive
Bohemian Grove, about 75 miles to the north.
Brief meetings were scheduled with Gov. Edmund
Brown, Jr. and San Francisco Mayor Dianne Feinstein
before a luncheon in Berkeley at the University of Cali
fornia with a German-American historians group.
Schmidt is scheduled to fly to Vancouver, British Co
lumbia, Monday night.
