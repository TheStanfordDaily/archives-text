## Construction blues linger here 
### 
They took all the trees and put
'em in a tree museum
And they charge all the people
a dollar 'n a half just to see 'em
â€” Joni Mitchell
The stark hills of the Marin
headlands rise and drop a ques
tion on your plate: why, in this
fair land of rain and sunshine,
are the hills bereft of trees? Pam
phlets at the Muir Woods Na
tional Monument offer an an
swer: those California 49ers, so
glorified in legend, dragged
away an entire redwood forest to
build the boom-town of San
Francisco.
An analogy can be drawn to
our beloved campus, blessed by
alumni eager to donate money
and have something, anything,
built in their memory.
I have fantasies about giving
tours to new Stanford students.
(I also have normal fantasies
about a condominium in
Sausalito, and 300 gallons of
pistachio ice-cream with nuts,
but I'll talk about those some
other time.)
I'm walking this group of
freshmen around campus, point
ing out all the changes I've seen
in three years. First I show them
all the obvious stupidities, like
Albers' $1.8 million Eighth World
Wonder, and the jungle-gym
called Mozart 11.
We get to Le Place Blanc, com
plete with construction site and
50-foot crane. A friend of mine
climbed that crane last quarter
and hung a banner saying
MOZART 111 on it.
I suppose building a new mu
sic building is as necessary as dis
turbing the quiescence of the
quad to rebuild sociology. May
be the next major reconstruc
tion will be the Chem building.
Both out of the way and
dilapidated, chemistry would be
a logical choice. Alas, my young
friend, the Stanford Building
Committee and Bottlewash
Crew does not function on logic.
To wit: see all the bikes whizz
ing by the French and Italian
Corner? The very busiest bike in
tersection on campus, this cor
ner is obviously the ideal place
for a clock tower.
See all the empty parking
spaces around the shopping
center? Well class, they're build
ing a few new stores so the
eager-to-please (businesses, not
undergraduates) Board of
Trustees agreed to pave more
paradise and put up a parking lot
no one will need.

Yes, sports fans, that same
group who annually raise tuition
17 percent and then proclaim
what? No one will suffer any fi
nancial hardship! They intend to
commit more thousands to pav
ing over more of our dwindling
tree-filled land so we can con
duct business-as-usual. A com
bination of commercial acumen
and engineering know-how sure
to make any robber-baron's
heart skip a beat.

Get used to the construction,
kiddies, because either some
one's brother owns a construc
tion firm, or the powers that be
suffer from the 19th-century de
lusion that continuous growth is
not only possible, but desirable.
Let's call it the Stanford Edifice
Complex, and take some prof
out of teaching to research it.
David Ganezer is a coterminal
student in Russian and Eastern
European studies.
