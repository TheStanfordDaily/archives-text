## National pastime now big business

Chicago — A few years back,
when a well-known company
equated baseball with the vir
tues of hot dogs, apple pie, and
automobiles, we should have re
alized something was rotten.
Last season's unprecedented
seven-week strike confirmed
our fears that America's Grand
Old Game is serious business
and, like so many others, could
be cracking under the weight of
ludicrous commercialization.
The is that while
player salaries have risen 250
percent since 1972, gate receipts
— baseball's single largest rev
enue source — are up only 59
percent. In order to pay for their
multimillion-dollar sluggers,
team owners have transformed a
spectator sport into a multi-me
dia spectacle.
Trips to the ballpark today ap
proach visits to Disney World.
We're drawn into the stadium by
free posters, decal-covered
windbreakers and team mugs.
Once inside, we're seduced by
ragtime bands, computerized
scoreboards, firework displays
and sexy base sweepers.
Whatever gimmicks owners
dream up, gate receipts can nev
er keep pace with free-agent
salaries (the average baseball
player earns $185,000 annually;
football players collect about
$83,000 per year). In 1980, de

spite near-record attendance
levels, only nine of 26 baseball
teams earned a profit.
In the future, a team's success
— at the bank and on the field —
will be more closely linked to its
ability to harness the local tele
vision markets. Teams with large
television audiences — Los An
geles and New York, for example
— will fare far better than those
without, such as Seattle or Mil
waukee. Short of revenue-shar
ing schemes, which function in
professional football, the al
ready-successful baseball teams
may be the only ones to grow
richer and better.
What could prove devastating,
however, are the numerous
cable-television agreements
now under negotiation. Already,
Chicago White Sox fans must pay
a $52.95 installation fee and
$21.95 per month for a decoder
box to watch their club on tele
vision.
"So, it's loot, loot, loot for the
home team,
If the fans get made it's a
shame,
Pay 'em less than one, two,
three million bucks,
And you're out of the Old Ball
game."
