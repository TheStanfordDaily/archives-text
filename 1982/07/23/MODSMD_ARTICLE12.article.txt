## Lantos deserves support, encouragement 
### 
Stanley Farber's letter (Daily,
July 13) aroused my disgust at his
shallow judgement and unin
formed partisanship. I doubt
that Bill Royer would have either
the intelligence or the courage
to support the revolutionary
movement in El Salvador as Tom
Lantos has done.
Asa refugee from a totalitarian
regime himself, Mr. Lantos un
derstands all too well the present
agony of the Salvadoran people.
He detests the brutal head of
state, Robert d'Aubuisson.
D'Aubuisson has not hesitated
to express his admiration for the
Nazis and for Hitler's efficiency
in murdering millionsof Europe
an jews. We now assist this man
as he carries out similar gen
ocide in his own country; we
send the ammunition, the
napalm, the helicopters and ma
chine guns with which
d'Aubuisson wages war against
his countrymen.
Tom Lantos is appalled at the
carnage in El Salvador. He is de
termined to see that the killers
who murdered the four Ameri
can churchwomen in December
1980 are brought to justice. He is
distressed to hear current re
ports of the suspension of vitally
needed agrarian reform by the
present government. Such ac
tions point inevitably to these
conclusions: the escalation of
hostilities by the Salvadoran gov
ernment against the poor and
dispossessed, the continuing
massacre of the peasantry in
search-and-destroy missions us
ing U.S. equipment, and the to
tal disregard for human rights
flagrantly displayed by Robert
d'Aubuisson.
Tom Lantos cannot, like Rea
gan et al., stand idly by; he in
tends, as he stated in a June 23

letter, "to continue ... to ex
press my outrage at violations of
humans rights in El Salvador. A
democratic society must never
compromise on the issue of hu
man rights."
Courageous and humane leg
islators like Lantos are not easy to
find, and his energy, dedication
and compassion deserve our
support and encouragement.

OD malpractices
I wish to go on record in op
position to two personnel
malpractices in the Office of De
velopment (OD). I had hoped
that with a transitional vice-pres
idency in place in the OD one
would begin to see new ethics,
but apparently such is not to be.
First, the OD continues to
place a cloak over job descrip
tions of employees. Two years
ago I requested to see job de
scriptions of particular positions
in the OD as a reference for
properly determining the classi
fication of a position under my
supervision. The request was de
nied under the guise that job de
scriptions were "personal and
confidential"; I was told this
again last week.
The Administrative Guide
does not state any place that job
descriptions are so classified;
nor does the job description
form itself. What some people
do within the University may be
a mystery, but it is not personal
and confidential, and it should
not be.
The second malpractice is
nepotism. A few years ago nepo
tism within the University was
only discouraged. When the Ad
ministrative Guide was revised in
the Spring of 1901, it was en

ddrsed. ("Employment of re
lated persons within an or
ganizational unit is permissible
with approval from the head of
the unit, e.g., dean, director, de
partment head." Guide Memo
22.1)
I disagreed with this change
then, and stated so publicly.
Now nepotism has become bla
tant in the OD as the acting vice
president, one of his directors,
and the OD's personnel officer
have or have had members of
their families working in the OD.
I could possibly understand em

ployees of lesser rank having
members of their families seek
ing positions in the same unit,
but not ranking employees. I
think the University must be
careful about institutional in
cest; it breeds inefficiency.
The mentality and lack of
character that go into these de
cisions also went in to the de
cision that placed parking
meters in front of Encina Hall.
That's class.
