# 49'er explains CARE's development efforts
## 
### Meg Donovan 
Last Tuesday night at the
Bechtel International Center,
the 30-40 people attending a
joint presentation given by the
Cooperative for American Relief
Everywhere (CARE) and backup
San Francisco 49'er quarterback,
University graduate Guy Ben
jamin, were treated to a radically
altered view of "life on the
farm."
However, the type of farm
Benjamin and CARE discussed
was not the "farm" so familiar to
students and faculty here, but
rather farms in the poverty
plagued third world nations
where CARE is conducting a va
riety of development programs.
Working in partnership with
host governments, CARE seeks
to provide technical and materi
al assistance in the form of tools,
equipment, instruction and su
pervision in many different
areas. According to its literature
the organization's central aim is
"to enable people not only to
survive, but also to gain the
strength and knowledge to be
come self-supporting." Not as
sociated with any government or
religion CARE is a voluntary,
nonprofit organization.
In addition to Benjamin the
other hosts at the presentation
were staff members from CARE's
Western Regional Office. The
talk was only the second such
presentation to be given in the
Bay Area since the relatively re
cent inception of the National
Football League Players Associa
tion/CARE program.
Benjamin's participation in
the program was the outgrowth
of a partnership between CARE
and the NFLPA designed to send
one representative from each
NFL team to witness CARE in ac
tion. Player representatives were
chosen by the NFLPA on the
basis of willingness to visit CARE
facilities in several developing
nations. Their time commitment
also includes a series of public

information forums, like the one
here, which they will host in
hopes of increasing public
awareness of the aims and ac
complishments of CARE world
wide.
Benjamin and the six other
NFLPA representatives in his
group (Houston's Elvin Bethea,
New Orleans' Benny Ricardo,
Seattle's Sam McCullum, Green
Bay's Chris Godfrey, Philadel
phia's Ray Ellis, and New York's
Beasley Reece), spent their time
viewing farming communities in
the rugged mountain coun
tryside of Peru and Ecuador.
While there, they were given the
opportunity to view CARE-spon
sored projects in health educa
tion, child feeding, water sys
tems installation, agricultural
improvement, and urban de
velopment.
"The presentation," ex
plained Bonnie Long, director of
CARE's Western office, "was a
chance to say thank you to CARE
donors and supporters, and also
an opportunity to present the
role of CARE Worldwide from a
novel viewpoint." Added Ben
jamin, "it was a chance to have
athletes view the facilities,
spread the word, and hopefully
help raise some money." The
trip itself was relatively inex
pensive because of the com
plimentary airfare afforded the
players by Braniff, and free lodg
ing in Peruvian hotels.
In addition to the time the
players spent in the Andean
farming communities, much of
their visit was spent viewing
pueblos jovenes, shanty towns
which have sprung up around
major cities with the influx of the
mountain farmers who abandon
their rugged homes and flock
toward more populated areas in
the hope of finding work, said
Benjamin. Unfortunately, work
is very difficult to come by even
in these areas. Moreover, the av
erage family spends up to one
quarter of their weekly income

merely obtaining potable water,
according to CARE represent
atives.
CARE has been in Peru since
1970 working to remedy such sit
uations. In their program vil
lagers do the work and con
tribute locally available re
sources.
Assistant Director Gary Wish
niewsky explained the steps in
volved in establishing CARE pro
grams in developing countries
around the world. "To begin
with, before CARE can even
consider the establishment of a
program, we require an invita
tion from the host government."
One special exception to this
policy was CARE's recent work
in Poland, where they super-

vised distribution of CARE pack
ages (for the first time since the
19605) on a local level, even
though the government had not
requested their help. Exceptions
such as this are rare, however,
said Richard Hoff, CARE field
representative.
After receiving an invitation
from the government of a partic
ular country, CARE sends a spe
cial investigative team in to
assess the situation and report
their findings to the Board of Di
rectors. The Board of Directors,
composed of sponsoring mem
ber agencies and members of
the general public, then makes a
final decision as to CARE's in
volvement. Should CARE decide
to undertake a project in that

country, the Board of Directors
then presents a contract to the
host government stipulating that
government's responsibility to
CARE staff and associates.
"I'm still searching myself for
some words to adequately de
scribe it,"says Benjamin of his
visit to the Andean farming com
munities. Benjamin came to
Tuesday night's program with
two strong plusses already in his
favor. Benjamin, also involved
with Friends of the Earth and the
March of Dimes, is a stranger to
neither social commitment nor
the Stanford community in
which he presented his im
pressions of the trip.
One of the bright spots in the
University's tradition of outstan
ding quarterbacks, Benjamin
graduated from Stanford in 1978.
The answers that Benjamin
once gave on an NCAA ques
tionaire illustrate two intriguing
aspects of his personality that
differentiate him from many
professional athletes. When
asked why he played football, his
response was "the great satisfac
tion and fulfillment, the sense of
camaraderie ... anything but
the accolades." Not your typical
response for a young man who
was at the time a highly touted
Heisman candidate. Asked
about possible career choices,
Benjamin listed among others
lawyer, athletic department ad
ministrator, and farmer. To some
extent then, he was right at
home with the Andean farmers.
In any case, he was clearly im
pressed by what he saw. "One
thing I liked about CARE, they
let the people do the work
themselves and utilize the re
sources they have (such as hu
man labor). They don't attempt
to introduce "American Ways" to
solve local problems. The beau
tiful thing is that they work
through the existing culture."
Wishniewsky said one of the
major reasons for CARE's suc
cess in limiting the imposition of

American values upon the local
populations they serve is their
policy of hiring natives as admin
istrators. He emphasized that us
ing local people to help educate
helps to overcome some of their
natural reluctance to change.
Another positive aspect to the
program is the establishment of
a link with athletics. Benjamin
said the "towns are united by
two things â€” school and soccer.
Athletics brought the communi
ty together."
Benjamin has long been in
terested in the role of sports and
the individual athlete in society.
He currently teaches a class here
in Optimal Human Per
formance, which examines the
psyschology and sociology of
sport. "It is designed to teach the
athlete a sense of responsibility,
it teaches them to know that
they have the ability to do what
ever they want to with their
potential both as an athlete and
as a human being."
Benjamin is deeply committed
to his own beliefs, among them
his awareness of his responsi
bility to his fans. His involvement
in the NFLPA/CARE program is
one way he sees of fulfilling this
responsibility.
