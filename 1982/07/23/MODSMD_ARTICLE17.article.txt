# Old-timers day draws S.F. baseball greats
## 
### Bill Ainsworth 
Willie Mays, Willie Mc-
Covey, Juan Marichal, Orlando
Cepeda and a somewhat puzzl
ing mix of stars and mediocre
players from the team's past
and present were all on hand to
celebrate the Giants 25th year
in San Francisco last Saturday at
the oldtimer's game.
The oldtimer's team, with a
roster of stars that read like a
list of who's who or who should
be who in Baseball's Hall of
Fame, contrasted with the cur
rent club's lineup, proving that
the team's past is more glorious
than its present.
But for the majority of the
33,000 spectators on hand, the
present club's mediocre stand
ing was the farthest thing from
their minds. The younger fans
were trying to get a glimpse of
the baseball legends they had
only heard about while the
older fans were concentrating
on reliving the club's great mo
ments, most of which were
achieved through the efforts of
the handful of aging stars on
the field.
On some stars, like Mays,
who hit a home run and several
long fly balls during batting

practice, the aging process was
not outwardly apparent.
Marichal, whose trade mark
high-kick was still in evidence,
had to have been pleased
when he struck out current
Philadelphia Phillies and
former Giants center fielder
Gary Maddox. For Maddox it
was a bad day all around.
Besides striking out twice in the
old timers game against
pitchers who hadn't pitched in
years, he reinjured his leg at
the beginning of the regular
game.
The performances given by
others like current General
Manager and former catcher
Tom Haller, showed that the
only thing left of their baseball
days were memories and bub
ble gum cards. Haller, how
ever, did manage to substitute
trickery for lost talent.
Instead of retrieving the
third ball that got past him, a
process which may have taken
hours, he took a ball from the
home plate umpire and kept
the runner from advancing.
However, the important
thing about the event was not
how the oldtimers fared
against each other in the game

— although that was interest
ing — but rather seeing the
personalities together again.
For a long-time fan like my
self, simply standing next to
Mays and McCovey in batting
practice and seeing Marichal in
the locker room provided the
biggest thrill of the day and it
allowed the realization of a
boyhood dream.
Younger Giants players felt
the same way. Chili Davis,
Giant centerfielder and can
didate for rookie of the year,
bashfully asked Mays for his au
tograph. Fred Breining, a
young Giant reliever who grew
up in the San Francisco area,
wandered around the locker
room getting his baseball auto
graphed by all the stars.
By far the most attention as
well as the most applause was
saved for Mays, probably the
best all-around player the
game has ever produced. Dur
ing the event he was sur
rounded by mobs of media
people wherever he went, all
of whom seemed to be asking
him the about the same things:
the Vic Wertz catch he made in
1954, the special relationship
he had with New York Giants
manager Leo Durocher, and
the uneasy relationship he had
with San Francisco fans who he
thought never gave him the
support he deserved.
Mays did tell the story of his
fielding trademark — the
basket catch. The catch, which
is made at the waist level in
stead of above the head, was
developed when he was in the
army during the Korean war,
according to Mays.
"I did it to boost the morale

of the fans (other enlisted
men)/'he said.
"When I came back I was
wondering how Leo
(Durocher, his manager at the
time) would like it/' he said.
Durocher apparently took to
the catch, as Mays continued to
use it for the next 20 years.
Mays gave his support to the
Giants for sponsoring the game
and said, "I wouldn't have
missed it for anything."

This was a somewhat dif
ferent attitude than Mays dis
played several years ago, when
he refused to appear for a day
the Giants wanted to arrange in
his honor without a large
payment. The result of that dis
agreement was that no day was
held.
"I think the people should
come out more in the future
for every game — not just Old
timers Game," Mays said.

saved for Mays, probably the
best all-around player the
game has ever produced. Dur
ing the event he was sur
rounded by mobs of media
people wherever he went, all
of whom seemed to be asking
him the about the same things:
the Vic Wertz catch he made in
1954, the special relationship
he had with New York Giants
manager Leo Durocher, and
the uneasy relationship he had
with San Francisco fans who he
thought never gave him the
support he deserved.
Mays did tell the story of his
fielding trademark — the
basket catch. The catch, which
is made at the waist level in
stead of above the head, was
developed when he was in the
army during the Korean war,
according to Mays.
"I did it to boost the morale

of the fans (other enlisted
men)/'he said.
"When I came back I was
wondering how Leo
(Durocher, his manager at the
time) would like it/' he said.
Durocher apparently took to
the catch, as Mays continued to
use it for the next 20 years.
Mays gave his support to the
Giants for sponsoring the game
and said, "I wouldn't have
missed it for anything."

This was a somewhat dif
ferent attitude than Mays dis
played several years ago, when
he refused to appear for a day
the Giants wanted to arrange in
his honor without a large
payment. The result of that dis
agreement was that no day was
held.
"I think the people should
come out more in the future
for every game — not just Old
timers Game," Mays said.

STRETCH — The leading lefthanded home run hitter in Na
tional League history, Willie McCovey, waits on deck for a
chance to bat in the old-timers game. McCovey drove in the
game's only run with a single to right field.
