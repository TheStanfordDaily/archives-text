# Corporate leaders run in meet
## 
### Mark Zeigler 
At 2:20 p.m. this Sunday, presidents and vice
presidents of some of the country's largest corpo
rations will not be on the golf course.
Instead, they will be at Stanford Stadium, not as
spectators, but as participants. These corporation
heads will be running in the President's Relay, one
of the many events in the fourth annual Corporate
Cup Relays to be held here this weekend.
The Corporate Cup (to be called the Chariot
Cup this year) has used University facilities as a
home for its national track championships for the
past two years. More than 70 corporations and or
ganizations will be represented Saturday, when
the two-day event kicks off.
Any corporate employee hired before March 1,
1982 who works a minimum of 32 hours a week is
eligible to compete in regional qualifying. How
ever, only the top squads from these eight regions
(San Francisco, Los Angeles, Denver, Dallas, Min
neapolis, Chicago, New York, and Atlanta) can par
ticipate in the national finals.
Any association, institution or government or

ganization can enter a team as long it is a member
of the CCA (Corporate Cup Association). The City
of Palo Alto placed seventh last year in the Class A
(non-corporation) division.
Corporations with 50 or more full-time employ
ees make up Class AA, while those with less than 50
Class B. This weekend Texas Instruments will at
tempt to defend its 1981 AA title, the U.S. Army at
Fort Ord its A championship, and Kransco Interna
tional its B crown.
The individual side of track is shunned in the
Corporate Cup, as all 12 events are team-oriented.
Aside from seven relays, five "races" are sched
uled with two-person teams; each person runs the
full race and their times are totaled to determine
the final outcome.
"You could take first place and still not win,"
said David Hans of Runners World magazine. "It
forces a company to look for depth, not just a few
outstanding individuals."
Overall team scores are tallied on a point basis,
with the first place squad in each event gaining 15
points.
