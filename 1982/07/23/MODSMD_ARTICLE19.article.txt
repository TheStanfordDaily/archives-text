## Lehrer ages well, but what price nostalgia? 
### Tony Kelly 
It's nice to see that Tom Lehrer
is getting along so nicely these
days. The actual man himself, I
don't know about; when last
sighted, the former professor of
mathematics at Harvard and po
litical satirist of the old That Was
the Week That Was was firmly
esconced at UC-Santa Cruz,
teaching on the applications of
mathematics to the social sci
ences. Killer stuff, you bet.
I mean the songs of Tom
Lehrer, composed while at
Harvard and performed on
TWTWTW and on three albums
that have sold a million and a half
copies between them. Songs like
"Poisoning Pigeons in the Park,"
"The Masochism Tango," and
"The Vatican Rag," that com
bined Tin Pan Alley melodies
and rhythms with the most
sardonic, twisted rhymes this
side of Ogden Nash. Lehrer's
songs have been resurrected
from their 15 to 20-year-old
grave and transformed into a
musical revue, an honor usually
reserved in San Francisco for
more respected and less living
songwriters like Gershwin or
Noel Coward. The show, Tom
foolery, at the Alcazar Theatre,
has just been held over to Sep
tember 12, having broken the
all-time box office record (or as
the Alcazar folks would say, the
ALL TIME BOX OFFICE REC
ORD) at the theatre. Sounds like
some show, huh?
Uh-uh. It's not a great show. In
fact, the production is fairly me
diocre. But the songs themselves
are so good that it's hard to make
them actually bad, though direc
tor Geoff Ferris and the cast cer
tainly try hard. What they have
done essentially is remove the
spontaneous charm of Lehrer's
original songs in favor of making
sure that everyone in the au
dience (and I mean everyone)
gets every joke. Tomfoolery
takes subtle, slightly academic
humor and roughs it up for the
blustery masses. And that both
ers me; I mean, I don't feel like a
blustery mass, who does?

Of course, that doesn't mean I
didn't sound like a blustery mass
— I laughed, giggled, and
chortled all through the show,
just like everyone else in the
Alcazar. But where I had pre
viously felt a sense of con
spiratorial glee while listening to
Lehrer's notes from under
ground, I now felt embarrassed
yukking along with "So Long
Mom" ("I'm off to drop the
bomb, so don't wait up for me")
while sitting in a plush theatre
seat for $13 a throw. Maybe it's as
Lehrer himself said, explaining
his self-imposed retirement
from live performance:
"Political satire became ob
solete when Henry Kissinger
won the Nobel Peace Prize."
Each of the four performers
had inspired moments, particu
larly Jack Shearer lampooning
the Hollywood politician in a
song about — surprise —
George Murphy. Lehrer insisted
on no updating of his songs in
Tomfoolery, and the choice is
wise — the closer the folks on
stage come to the camraderie of
the author's college days, the
better they get. When the show
was at its best, it allowed not only
the lyrics of the songs to pene
trate, but also the clever musical
direction of Barry Koron.
Koron's rickety piano, tinkling
away above the rest of the or
chestra, provided the most ac
curate representations of
Lehrer's humor, in addition to a
fertile ground for the many mu
sical jokes in the Tomfoolery
songbook.
But while the songs them
selves are intentionally kept in
their original context, the stag
ing is curiously competitive with
the text, making Tomfoolery at
best a series of jokes that don't
last beyond the theater (which I
suspect is against the show's in
tent) and at worst a showcase for
ham acting.
Robin Nicholas is capable, but
he is featured in Tomfoolery's
most telling moment, a song
called "The Elements." The song
is designed to list the elements of

the atomic chart, in no particular
order, paying attention only to
rhyming and keeping up a
breakneck pace. Nicholas does a
fine job at that difficult task; but
first he goes through the song,
very very slowly, listing the ele
ments and making snide jokes
about certain ones. It's as if he
feels he has to prove he's men
tioning every element, some
thing Lehrer never had to do
with his background in physics.
The effect doesn't work, strongly
implying that you don't need to
hear every word to get the jokes
in the songs of Tom Lehrer. It's a
real shame that everyone in
volved with Tomfoolery spent so
much time learning about
Lehrer and not understanding
that basic fact. The reaction I
have to Tomfoolery is similar to
how I felt after seeing The Blues
Brothers Movie: I'm overjoyed
to hear great songs again, but at
what price?


The Tomfoolery cast mugs it up.

grave and transformed into a
musical revue, an honor usually
reserved in San Francisco for
more respected and less living
songwriters like Gershwin or
Noel Coward. The show, Tom
foolery, at the Alcazar Theatre,
has just been held over to Sep
tember 12, having broken the
all-time box office record (or as
the Alcazar folks would say, the
ALL TIME BOX OFFICE REC
ORD) at the theatre. Sounds like
some show, huh?
Uh-uh. It's not a great show. In
fact, the production is fairly me
diocre. But the songs themselves
are so good that it's hard to make
them actually bad, though direc
tor Geoff Ferris and the cast cer
tainly try hard. What they have
done essentially is remove the
spontaneous charm of Lehrer's
original songs in favor of making
sure that everyone in the au
dience (and I mean everyone)
gets every joke. Tomfoolery
takes subtle, slightly academic
humor and roughs it up for the
blustery masses. And that both
ers me; I mean, I don't feel like a
blustery mass, who does?

Of course, that doesn't mean I
didn't sound like a blustery mass
— I laughed, giggled, and
chortled all through the show,
just like everyone else in the
Alcazar. But where I had pre
viously felt a sense of con
spiratorial glee while listening to
Lehrer's notes from under
ground, I now felt embarrassed
yukking along with "So Long
Mom" ("I'm off to drop the
bomb, so don't wait up for me")
while sitting in a plush theatre
seat for $13 a throw. Maybe it's as
Lehrer himself said, explaining
his self-imposed retirement
from live performance:
"Political satire became ob
solete when Henry Kissinger
won the Nobel Peace Prize."
Each of the four performers
had inspired moments, particu
larly Jack Shearer lampooning
the Hollywood politician in a
song about — surprise —
George Murphy. Lehrer insisted
on no updating of his songs in
Tomfoolery, and the choice is
wise — the closer the folks on
stage come to the camraderie of
the author's college days, the
better they get. When the show
was at its best, it allowed not only
the lyrics of the songs to pene
trate, but also the clever musical
direction of Barry Koron.
Koron's rickety piano, tinkling
away above the rest of the or
chestra, provided the most ac
curate representations of
Lehrer's humor, in addition to a
fertile ground for the many mu
sical jokes in the Tomfoolery
songbook.
But while the songs them
selves are intentionally kept in
their original context, the stag
ing is curiously competitive with
the text, making Tomfoolery at
best a series of jokes that don't
last beyond the theater (which I
suspect is against the show's in
tent) and at worst a showcase for
ham acting.
Robin Nicholas is capable, but
he is featured in Tomfoolery's
most telling moment, a song
called "The Elements." The song
is designed to list the elements of

the atomic chart, in no particular
order, paying attention only to
rhyming and keeping up a
breakneck pace. Nicholas does a
fine job at that difficult task; but
first he goes through the song,
very very slowly, listing the ele
ments and making snide jokes
about certain ones. It's as if he
feels he has to prove he's men
tioning every element, some
thing Lehrer never had to do
with his background in physics.
The effect doesn't work, strongly
implying that you don't need to
hear every word to get the jokes
in the songs of Tom Lehrer. It's a
real shame that everyone in
volved with Tomfoolery spent so
much time learning about
Lehrer and not understanding
that basic fact. The reaction I
have to Tomfoolery is similar to
how I felt after seeing The Blues
Brothers Movie: I'm overjoyed
to hear great songs again, but at
what price?


The Tomfoolery cast mugs it up.
