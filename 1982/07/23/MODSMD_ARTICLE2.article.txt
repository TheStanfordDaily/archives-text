# Coffee House patio slated

### Lisa Tseng 
An outdoor patio facing the recreation cen
ter should be installed behind the Coffee
House by Sept. 1, according to Ellie Op
penheim, director of Tresidder Union.
Oppenheim and Coffee House President
Chris Cramer said the idea of a patio has been
considered for more than a year. Initial plans
called for a patio in front of the Coffee House
facing Dinkelspiel Auditorium. But the budget
of $15,000 set for all remodeling funds, which is
still in effect, was insufficient at that location,
said Oppenheim.
I,ast Friday, the Tresidder Union Policy Board,
the Space Committee, and the Coffee House
Board officially approved the patio plans. This
new extension includes all existing picnic area
and walkways in the corner between the Coffee
House and the recreation center.
According to Steve Weiss, manager of the
Coffee House, the Coffee House needs a
change of atmosphere. Metal fencing and stone
retaining walls similar to those already used
throughout Tresidder will block off the area.
Potted plants and flowers will help to create a
pleasant, cheery atmosphere, he said.
New patio furnishings will be purchased to
replace the present picnic tables. In addition,
stage area for light entertainment has been set
aside but can easily be converted into more din
ing space if necessary.
Customers will have direct access to this area
through the Coffee House or through a handi
cap gate on one side of the patio. The main door
to the arcade and bowling alley will be moved
from its present postion to a door at the far end
of the building just outside of the proposed
pati space. Directional signs for the new en
trances will be posted, said Weiss.
He described the construction process as a
series of stages. Retaining walls and greenery
hold first priority, with electrical connections

and refinements following.
Weiss said the Coffee House Board may test a
new system of table service for this outer area.
Several proposals for serving customers effi
ciently include a number calling arrangement
or a direct hostessing operation. Another pos
sible procedure for service would establish
"selective" hours for direct table service. The
rest of the day would remain on a serve-and
seat-yourself basis.
The new patio should require additional hir
ing of students, said Weiss. With approximately
140 to 150 students working part-time already,
the Coffee House wants to continue the tradi
tion of staffing only with students.
According to Cramer, another advantage of
the outdoor patio is the possible extension of
the Coffee House liquor license. It is currently
illegal to take alcoholic beverages outside of
the Coffee House. When the pat'o is installed
and is bounded specifically on all sides, cus
tomers will be able to drink in areas not ex
clusively within the building. Alcohol sold by
the Coffee House will also be allowed in the
recreational center.
Interior remodeling will involve repainting
the walls and recarpeting the floor, and possibly
installing a filter for the circulation of smoke
filled air.
Regular entertainment will continue inside.
But the Coffee House will hire additional acts to
play outside when the new area is available.
Solo guitarists or single vocalists will be allowed
outside, but larger bands will perform inside
because of the noise level.
Weiss said, "It's a great investment because it
will increase our overall revenues which in turn
makes Tresidder's revenues increase also. Of
course it's better for business, but at the same
time it offers something different and informal
yet nice. It's the kind of place you can sit with a
nice bottle of Zinfandel wine and enjoy."
