Fast Times at Ridgemont High:
A True Story
Simon and Schuster: 1981
253 pp., $5.95
Everyone has separate, unique
memories of high school. This
individual memory becomes dis
torted over the years, and the in
accurate, romanticized view
makes many books about high
school seem unsatisfying and
shallow. However, one book,
Fast Times at Ridgemont High: A
True Story, manages to over
come the problem by telling the
true story of a high school in
Southern California.
Cameron Crowe, regularly a
magazine journalist, went back
to Ridgemont High at the age of
22 to observe and write about
students there. Posing as a sen
ior, he manages to find accep
tance and not be discovered
throughout the course of the
year. He sought an accurate
portrayal of high school. "I did

not want to become yet anbther
adult writing about adolescence
and the kids from an adult per
spective. This story, I felt,
belonged to the kids them
selves," Crowe wrote in the
preface.
Crowe proceeds through the
book with a series of short sec
tions, each providing a glimpse
of an event in one character life.
"I have tried to capture the flow
of day-to-day high school life, as
well as the life that begins as
soon as the last bell rings. It was
my intention to write of the en
tire business — from academic
competition to the sexual blun
ders — of teenage adulthood,"
Crowe wrote.
The descriptions of characters
and events remind the reader of
people he knew in high school
and cause a poignant effect. For
example, Gregg Adams and Cin
dy Carr are the campus couple
and experts at smiling. "Both
Adams and Carr were masters of
the teeth-baring smile. This,

more than anything else, was the
true sign of a high school social
climber known as the 'sosh.' The
teeth-baring sosh (long o) began
as a glimmer in the eye. Then the
sosh chin quivered, and then the
entire sosh face detonated into a
synthetic grin. Usually'accom
panied by a sharp 'hi,' it was an
art form that Adams and Carr
had taken to its extreme."
Crowe manages to effectively
describe characters so unusual
they could only be found in a
public high school; one pair of
characters includes Arnold
Hand, a teacher, and Jeff Spicoli,
a student. Hand idolizes Steve
McGarrett of TV's Hawaii Five-
CD. Hand styles his entire life after
the TV detective and manages to
create a classroom atmosphere
similar to that of McGarrett's of
fice in Honolulu.
Jeff Spicoli also has a fanciful
imagination. However, Spicoli is
driven by the dream to appear
on the Tonight Show, telling
(cooly, of course) the story of his
latest adventure as a world class
surfer. Spicoli manages to make
it to school every morning after
smoking three bowls of mari
juana and surfing at the local
beach. Spicoli, the truant, and
Hand, whose mortal enemy is
truancy, meet antagonistically at
first, but eventually develop a
rapport by the end of the school
year.
Friendship between students
is also explored at Ridgemont
High. Mark Ratner and Mike
Damone provide an example of
male friendship in the book.
Damone, from Philadelphia
"where women are fast and life
is cheap," provides a role model
for Ratner. Damone has de
veloped a philosophy of life

known simply as "the attitude."
The attitude entails remaining
cool at all times. Ratner is im
pressed by Damone's life-style
and becomes a student of his ev
ery move. Ratner is the most in
terested in Damone's philoso
phy of women, which conve
niently Damone has distilled
into a "five point plan" for suc
cess. The five point plan is put to
the test with hilarious results
when Ratner gets a date with his
dream girl, Stacy Hamilton.
Stacy Hamilton and Linda Bar
rett represent the female side of
friendship in the book. Linda

provides Stacy with lessons in life
she has learned the hard way be

hanging around with a rough

Stacy through several traumatic
experiences as the book
progresses. Both of them, how
ever, are unable to understand
male behavior, and this gives the
book an even-handed treatment
of boyfriends and girlfriends in
high school.
Not understanding his girl
friend is just the beginning of
Brad Hamilton's problems. Brad,
the main character in the book,

is plagued by problems in rus
senior year — his "cruise year."
Brad, bead fryer at the Ridge
mont Carl's Jr., is at the pinnacle
of the social ladder at the begin
ning of his senior year. However,
his popularity and social position
wane as he loses his job
He becomes frustrated and his
thoughts during college orien
tation week set the tone for the
entire book. "Brad Hamilton sat

long parade of adults, and the

climber known as the 'sosh.' The
teeth-baring sosh (long o) began
as a glimmer in the eye. Then the
sosh chin quivered, and then the
entire sosh face detonated into a
synthetic grin. Usually'accom
panied by a sharp 'hi,' it was an
art form that Adams and Carr
had taken to its extreme."
Crowe manages to effectively
describe characters so unusual
they could only be found in a
public high school; one pair of
characters includes Arnold
Hand, a teacher, and Jeff Spicoli,
a student. Hand idolizes Steve
McGarrett of TV's Hawaii Five-
CD. Hand styles his entire life after
the TV detective and manages to
create a classroom atmosphere
similar to that of McGarrett's of
fice in Honolulu.
Jeff Spicoli also has a fanciful
imagination. However, Spicoli is
driven by the dream to appear
on the Tonight Show, telling
(cooly, of course) the story of his
latest adventure as a world class
surfer. Spicoli manages to make
it to school every morning after
smoking three bowls of mari
juana and surfing at the local
beach. Spicoli, the truant, and
Hand, whose mortal enemy is
truancy, meet antagonistically at
first, but eventually develop a
rapport by the end of the school
year.
Friendship between students
is also explored at Ridgemont
High. Mark Ratner and Mike
Damone provide an example of
male friendship in the book.
Damone, from Philadelphia
"where women are fast and life
is cheap," provides a role model
for Ratner. Damone has de
veloped a philosophy of life

known simply as "the attitude."
The attitude entails remaining
cool at all times. Ratner is im
pressed by Damone's life-style
and becomes a student of his ev
ery move. Ratner is the most in
terested in Damone's philoso
phy of women, which conve
niently Damone has distilled
into a "five point plan" for suc
cess. The five point plan is put to
the test with hilarious results
when Ratner gets a date with his
dream girl, Stacy Hamilton.

Fast Times at Ridgemont High:
A True Story
Simon and Schuster: 1981
253 pp., $5.95
Everyone has separate, unique
memories of high school. This
individual memory becomes dis
torted over the years, and the in
accurate, romanticized view
makes many books about high
school seem unsatisfying and
shallow. However, one book,
Fast Times at Ridgemont High: A
True Story, manages to over
come the problem by telling the
true story of a high school in
Southern California.
Cameron Crowe, regularly a
magazine journalist, went back
to Ridgemont High at the age of
22 to observe and write about
students there. Posing as a sen
ior, he manages to find accep
tance and not be discovered
throughout the course of the
year. He sought an accurate
portrayal of high school. "I did

not want to become yet anbther
adult writing about adolescence
and the kids from an adult per
spective. This story, I felt,
belonged to the kids them
selves," Crowe wrote in the
preface.
Crowe proceeds through the
book with a series of short sec
tions, each providing a glimpse
of an event in one character life.
"I have tried to capture the flow
of day-to-day high school life, as
well as the life that begins as
soon as the last bell rings. It was
my intention to write of the en
tire business — from academic
competition to the sexual blun
ders — of teenage adulthood,"
Crowe wrote.
The descriptions of characters
and events remind the reader of
people he knew in high school
and cause a poignant effect. For
example, Gregg Adams and Cin
dy Carr are the campus couple
and experts at smiling. "Both
Adams and Carr were masters of
the teeth-baring smile. This,

more than anything else, was the
true sign of a high school social
climber known as the 'sosh.' The
teeth-baring sosh (long o) began
as a glimmer in the eye. Then the
sosh chin quivered, and then the
entire sosh face detonated into a
synthetic grin. Usually'accom
panied by a sharp 'hi,' it was an
art form that Adams and Carr
had taken to its extreme."
Crowe manages to effectively
describe characters so unusual
they could only be found in a

a student. Hand idolizes Steve

the TV detective and manages to
