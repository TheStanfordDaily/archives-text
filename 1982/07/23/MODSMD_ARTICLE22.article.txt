## The 						solution to the French dilemma

French restaurants are a
dilemma. They have a way of
being intimidating. You in
variably have to get dressed up
just to make it past the maitre d'.
You try desperately to recall
your high school French, but
end up struggling with the menu
and making a fool out of yourself
anyway. If it's not one thing it's
another ... you end up with a
hole in your wallet and prices
that were more than you
bargained for, or in a hole in the
wall where the food is disap
pointing at best.
The answer to this dilemma
lies across the street from the
picturesque Sunset Magazine
headquarters in Menlo Park. The
spot used to be occupied by a
rather forgettable cafeteria-style
restaurant called Blake's, but has
since been replaced by a rather
unforgettable restaurant called
Pear William's. Pear William's
has an atmosphere that is rare for
restaurants in this genre. It wel
comes both the casual diner as
well as those in evening attire.
Here, you can enjoy sophisti
cated French cuisine without
feeling the need to play the part
of the sophisticate. The food and
setting are unpretentious, and
there are no holds barred on the
quality of the meal.
The interior is quiet, the decor
simple, and the colors muted.
There are two dining areas and
an outdoor patio for lunches or
brunches.
The menu reflects the sim
plicity of the surroundings, it's a
scant three pages. There are five
hors d'oeuvres followed by a list
of a dozen or so entrees. The
brevity of the listings, however,
is hardly a limitation. The selec
tions have been judiciously as
sembled to make the most of
Cordon Bleu-trained Chef
Thomas McCombie. He is best
known for his mastery of the dif
ficult puff pastry cooking, but
equally impressive is his flair for
the imaginative use of spices, not
always associated primarily with
French cooking. We encoun
tered blue cheese, cumin, and
saffron on this particular night. It
sounds more Indian or Spanish,
and other ingredients run the

gamut from shiitake mushrooms
to golden caviar. All are pre
pared expertly, and the presen
tation of the dishes here relies
on flamboyance than on finesse.
The hors d'oeuvres range
from Saute of Mushrooms with
Madeira ($3.50) to Fromage de
Chevre en Casserole, a casserole
of baked French goat cheese
with bread crumb topping
($3.50). The most interesting may
be the Escargots au Beurre du
Fromage Bleu â€” escargots in
blue cheese. One's initial in
clination is to suspect that the
cheese would certainly over
power the more delicate flavor
of the escargot and butter. Upon
tasting one experiences a pleas
ant surprise. The sauce has the
faintest flavor of blue cheese and
makes for an intriguing variation
on the traditional escargot.
The entrees range from $8 to
$15 in price and are served with
salad, soup and vegetables. If
you're in luck, Chef McCombie
may have prepared a cold
tomato soup that day. It is ex
cellent, with a smooth texture
due to the shrimp puree, and
contains razor thin slices of raw
zucchini and celery. The flavor is
more subtle than a gazpacho,
with a dash of cumin giving it a
curious spicy tinge.
If you've never tried puff
pastry cooking, this is a good
place to become initiated. Mak
ing quality puff pastry requires
time and an experienced hand,
and though many restaurants
can boast of puff pastry in their
repertoire, few can match the
expertise of Chef McCombie.
Try the breast of chicken in a
cream and brandy sauce
($12.25), or the rolled filet of sole
($12.50), both encased in a flaky
puff pastry shell.
The latter is a relatively new
item on the menu. It comes in a
delicate sauce of butter, wine,
and shallots. Spanish saffron, an
often-neglected but elegant
spice, is added to give the sauce
a tangy flavor which comple
ments the fish well. The sole was
fresh and tender.
Another entree item my din
ner companion tried was an old
favorite here, Brochette de Co
quilles Saint-Jacques ($12.95).
According to Chef McCombie,
"I'd be lynched if I ever removed
it from the menu." It consists of
generous portions of skewered

scallops in a rich mushroom and
cheese sauce. Skewerinp the
scallops seems to be an odd
presentation of this dish, but the
result is an amazingly tender
shell fish. When cooked on a
skewer, under the chef's
watchful eye, the scallops

cook from within as

well as from the

outside, a

process

which

shortens the baking time, and
also tenderizes the fish. It is de
licious.
Other entrees range from
chicken breast sauteed with
parmesan cheese and bread
crumbs ($10.50), to pan-fried
steak with green peppercorn
sauce ($14.95).
The dinner salad is a fluffy red
lettuce sprinkled with walnut
shavings, and a vinegarette
dressing.
Much of the business here
seems to be repeat business, and
it is through the specials that va
riety in the menu is maintained.
There are monthly Thursday and
Friday-Saturday specials, as well
as the daily specials. These are
certainly enticing enough to
tempt one back to see what new
creations Chef McCombie has
produced. They range from trad
itional fare like Osso Buco Nico
ise, braised veal shanks with
herbs, olives and oranges, to
more adventurous fare like
Millefeuille de Filet de Sole,
fresh filet of sole in thin layers of
puff pastry in a light wine and
butter sauce and garnished with
Innoci mushrooms. The latter is

the height of puff pastry cook
ing, literally translated as "a
thousand leaves," and is an area
Chef McCombie wants to ex
pand into. For those who like to
plan in advance, ask to be placed
on their mailing list to receive
listings of upcoming specials.

For dessert, there is the Pear
William, which is served at the Le
Moulin de Mugins in southern

France, and from which Pear

William's derives its name.

The Pear William is a

poached pear pear half

on a bed of vanilla ice
cream cream with

homemade made
caramel sauce

Another ir
resistable des
sert is the
Feuilletage, a
puff pastry filled
with French
custard, your
choice of fresh
pear, blue-

berries or strawberries, and
creme chantilly. It's suggested
that you split a single serving un
less you're intent on calorie
binging. The preparation takes
20 minutes so make your desires
known well in advance.
The service here was a little
spotty on this night. The waiter
was a little forgetful, but the ser
vice was well meant and friendly.
Pear William's is by no means a
restaurant for the student
budget, as dinner for two will av
erage $30 to $40. If the hors
d'oeuvres and dessert are left
out, you can enjoy an affordable
meal, but they're too tempting
to omit. The prices are, however,
well within line for the quality of
food served.
If you're in search of un
pretentiously fine food for those
romantic nights, special occa
sions or just for the sake of cul
inary hedonism, this is the place.
The memory will linger on your
palate for days.
