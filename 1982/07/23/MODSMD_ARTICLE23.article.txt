Obrero Hotel and Restaurant
1208 Stockton Street
San Francisco
986-9850
Welcome to the Top of the O.
No, you have not arrived at the
latest of San Francisco's trendy
fern bars. You're on the second
floor of the undistinguished
verging-on-sleazy (but in a clean
kind of way) Obrero Hotel and
Restaurant. Actually, the hotel is
very, very clean and well-kept. It
and the restaurant are both small
and quaint, in the same architec
tural style as thousands of homes
in the City, but the restaurant is
quite unlike any other. It is this
distinction that makes the O a
fascinating place to visit, and to
eat.
The Obrero itself is the off
spring of an old tradition of
Basque hostelries in the Bay
Area. In days of old and not so
old, Basque men in Baghdad-by

the-Bay used to lodge at a partic
ular series of boarding houses
where card games, heavy smok
ing, heavier drinking and hearty

meals provided a distinctive Eu
ropean atmosphere. The Obrero
in modern times, though, is a
Basque hotel without the Bas

ques — immigrants no longer
own and operate the place, and
as owner Bambi McDonald ex
plained to us, for Basques
abroad it's strictly a matter of
when an owner goes, so go the
clientele.
However, the food and com
munal atmosphere remain the
same at the Obrero. Patrons are
seated at long tables and food is
brought out en masse and
amicablydivvied up, almost forc
ing you to make more than a
passing acquaintance with the
strangers next to you. Its in
formality is designed to get
groups talking, and we recom
mend one of the generous
aperitifs — vermouth and the
like, at a buck or so — to lower
any conversational barriers that
might exist.
It's like home. Not my home,
not your home, but Home. The
generically rustic decor —
checked red and white plastic
tablecloths, long tables, plants
(lots of plants), etc. — would be
at home anywhere on the conti
nent; you can even take your
pick of which continent. The in
tangibility of its identity did not
surprise us; after all, we had just
come through Japantown to a
district on the edge of Little Italy
and Chinatown, in the heart of
the great American city of San
Francisco, to a Basque restau
rant. On top of that, the group
seated behind us spoke only in
German. Talk about culture
shock.
Oh yeah, the food. The meal
was not distinguished, although
very good and very solid. In San
Francisco, a five-course meal (in
cluding two main courses) and a
half bottle of wine for $8.50 a
throw is truly outstanding, and
one can accept the lack of
pyrotechnics in the cuisine in re
turn for a full belly and some oc
casional moments of finesse. The

soup was, well, soup — a
flavorful broth full of cabbage
and carrots, along with the occa
sional wandering scrap of ham. It
would not set Escoffier a-waltz
ing, but Stuart's three-and-a-half
bowls testified to its palatibility,
and the constant supply of hot
bread to accompany it was a wef
come surprise.
Next, the shepherd's pie — a
blend of minced beef, pork,
lamb and a variety of spices,
topped with mashed potatoes
and baked. Portions were far
from delicate, but the flavor was
not. It showed an excellent sense
of balance and texture, and

though once again not ex
emplary gastronomic fare, it had
no pretensions of being so. We
felt like saying, "Nice one,
Mom." The Basque chicken was
in the same vein — a quarter of a
chicken smothered in a very
spicy tomato sauce, an old
Basque favorite. Like the rest of
this meal, it was filling and
flavorful, but not overwhelming.
Apparently, we were treated
to the Basquest of all the meals
offered. Each day of the week
has its own menu, and had we
come another day, we could
have encountered roast beef,

roast lamb, spaghetti with clam
sauce, et. al. — all generously
served, we're sure. We recom
mend that you find out the
schedule beforehand, and plan
your visit for whatever suits you
best.
Salad and cheese were stan
dard-to-boring, as was the des
sert — an orange. Not even a
large orange; just an orange.
Each. But having gorged
ourselves just over the line into
Lard City, this was hardly signifi
cant. They were quite edible,
and that sufficed. The wine was
surprisingly drinkable. The ser
vice was homey and very friend

ly; the owner jolly, although
cloistered for the most part in
the kitchen; and the clientele —
well, your guess is as good as
mine, each evening differs.
If you're in the City, have al
ready signed your checking ac
count over to the paperboy, feel
vaguely gregarious, and could
devour a small ox (but would
prefer to stick to good Basque
food), give the Obrero a well
deserved shot. It could become
your San Francisco home away
from home, like it was for the
Basques.

OBRERO
IN SAN FRANCISCO'S
FAMOUS
NORTH BEACH
Obrero Hotel and Restaurant
1208 Stockton Street
San Francisco
986-9850
Welcome to the Top of the O.
No, you have not arrived at the
latest of San Francisco's trendy
fern bars. You're on the second
floor of the undistinguished
verging-on-sleazy (but in a clean
kind of way) Obrero Hotel and
Restaurant. Actually, the hotel is
very, very clean and well-kept. It
and the restaurant are both small
and quaint, in the same architec
tural style as thousands of homes
in the City, but the restaurant is
quite unlike any other. It is this
distinction that makes the O a
fascinating place to visit, and to
eat.
The Obrero itself is the off
spring of an old tradition of
Basque hostelries in the Bay
Area. In days of old and not so
old, Basque men in Baghdad-by

the-Bay used to lodge at a partic
ular series of boarding houses
where card games, heavy smok
ing, heavier drinking and hearty

meals provided a distinctive Eu
ropean atmosphere. The Obrero
in modern times, though, is a
Basque hotel without the Bas

ques — immigrants no longer
own and operate the place, and
as owner Bambi McDonald ex
plained to us, for Basques
abroad it's strictly a matter of
when an owner goes, so go the
clientele.
However, the food and com
munal atmosphere remain the
same at the Obrero. Patrons are
seated at long tables and food is
brought out en masse and
amicablydivvied up, almost forc
ing you to make more than a
passing acquaintance with the
strangers next to you. Its in
formality is designed to get
groups talking, and we recom
mend one of the generous
aperitifs — vermouth and the
like, at a buck or so — to lower
any conversational barriers that
might exist.
It's like home. Not my home,
not your home, but Home. The
generically rustic decor —
checked red and white plastic
tablecloths, long tables, plants
(lots of plants), etc. — would be
at home anywhere on the conti
nent; you can even take your
pick of which continent. The in
tangibility of its identity did not
surprise us; after all, we had just
come through Japantown to a
district on the edge of Little Italy
and Chinatown, in the heart of
the great American city of San
Francisco, to a Basque restau
rant. On top of that, the group
seated behind us spoke only in
German. Talk about culture
shock.
Oh yeah, the food. The meal
was not distinguished, although
very good and very solid. In San
Francisco, a five-course meal (in
cluding two main courses) and a
half bottle of wine for $8.50 a
throw is truly outstanding, and
one can accept the lack of
pyrotechnics in the cuisine in re
