# Casual country cookin'

### 
Just the name conjures up
images in most of our
minds. It was 1967, a time
when political demonstrations,
"social consciousness" and pot
smoking were happening ev
erywhere. It was a crazy time,
with free expression in the air
and an attitude of Anything
Goes... In some ways Alice's is a
special holdout, maybe not for
those ideas and actions, but for
the memory of that era.
"Alice's Restaurant" is found
high in the Santa Cruz Moun
tains, about a half-hour drive
from Stanford. Opening as a gro
cery store in the early 1900s, it
was appropriately named the
"Four Corners" (it is located at
the intersection of four moun
tain highways, including the La
Honda Road which winds to the
coast) when it was converted to a
restaurant in the 19305. Around
the time of the famous Arlo
Guthrie song and in what the
present owner describes as a
"rebellious move," the restau
rant took on its present name. It
is referred to by most as just
"Alice's."
Regardless of any precon
ceived notion you have about
Alice's, we'd recommend you
set those aside and experience it

— outhouses and all — for the
mixture of character it reveals.
We were on our way to the
beach on a Saturday morning
and decided Alice's would be
the perfect stop-off along the
way. We arrived around 10 and
had no problem seating
ourselves. By 10:30, though, the
fog had broken and almost si
multaneously the little restau
rant (it seats about 50) filled up.
The outdoor patio, a wooden
deck with picnic benches and
large shade umbrellas, was also
very popular and customers
there didn't seem to have trou
ble finding seats for themselves.
Motorcycles and bicycles lined
the front of the patio railing, and
a few local dogs enjoying the
sunshine on the front
porchsteps casually greeted cus
tomers.
Montana moose-lodge style
best describes the mood of the
interior. The wooden walls are
literally covered with photos,
pictures, knick-knacks and signs
For example, a huge, old-time
photograph of Skyline
Boulevard hangs above the
counter with nutrition posters,
wildlife information guides and
motorcycle scenes scattered
around the dining room. Large
paneled windows framed with
calico curtains stretch from ceil
ing to floor. It seemed that many
a cowboy-, hiking- and motor
cycle-boot had kicked into the

wooden diner counter, and the
mellow country-style music
seemed to complete the at
mosphere.
On to the food. The menu is
nothing fancy, and between the
two of us we ordered a cheese
omelette ($3.75) and French
toast ($2.75), orange juice (alas,
not fresh) and coffee. The
omelette was the most en
joyable, with plenty of cheese
(cheddar, jack, Swiss or Ameri
can) and garnished with parsley
and a dash of paprika. With the
omelette came "camp-style"
hash browns, potato chunks
deep-fried to a crispy brown.
They were a little greasy, which
wasn't surprising, but on the
whole quite good. Toast is in
cluded, with a choice of wheat,
white or rye.
One also has a choice of
breads — wheat or white — with
the French toast. You are not giv
en the option to butter your
own, and unless you specify oth
erwise you'll be given a heavy
dose. The French toast, as with
all the food, is prepared "diner
style." It's good country
cooking — simple, a little greasy
(or buttery, if you prefer), and
usually very satisfying.
The service at Alice's is out
standing. The casual at
mosphere, complete with flan
nel-shirted waitresses in faded
blue jeans, might suggest equal
ly casual service, but this wasn't
the case. We weren't rushed,
even when the place got
crowded, which is unusual to
find these days.
The lunch menu offers
the basics — sandwiches,
burgers, soup, chili and the like.
We eyed a selection of home
made pies, and there's always ice
cream if you're interested in a la
mode. Domestic and imported
beers are available, and also a
selection of inexpensive wines."
Remember, however, that
Alice's is only open for breakfast

and lunch.
The prices at Alice's are aver
age, maybe even cheaper than
some. But Alice's isn't really a
place where you're close
enough to compare; it's in a
league, and location, of its own.
You could say they've got a
monopoly on tne area, but
they'd never consider exploiting
it. -
On the weekend you'll find, as
we did, a combination of in
teresting people. It is definitely a

bikers (motor, that is) hangout,
but on a sunny Saturday there
could easily be as many cyclists
foot-pedaling out to the Coast.
Some tourists make Alice's their
first stop when they reach the
Bay Area, drawn to its unique
and rare character.
Beach walkers, biker boots,
bare feet —it all goes ... well,
just about anything goes at
Alice's.

Just the name conjures up
images in most of our
minds. It was 1967, a time
when political demonstrations,
"social consciousness" and pot
smoking were happening ev
erywhere. It was a crazy time,
with free expression in the air
and an attitude of Anything
Goes... In some ways Alice's is a
special holdout, maybe not for
those ideas and actions, but for
the memory of that era.
"Alice's Restaurant" is found
high in the Santa Cruz Moun
tains, about a half-hour drive
from Stanford. Opening as a gro
cery store in the early 1900s, it
was appropriately named the
"Four Corners" (it is located at
the intersection of four moun
tain highways, including the La
Honda Road which winds to the
coast) when it was converted to a
restaurant in the 19305. Around
the time of the famous Arlo
Guthrie song and in what the
present owner describes as a
"rebellious move," the restau
rant took on its present name. It
is referred to by most as just
"Alice's."
Regardless of any precon
ceived notion you have about
Alice's, we'd recommend you
set those aside and experience it

— outhouses and all — for the
mixture of character it reveals.
We were on our way to the
beach on a Saturday morning
and decided Alice's would be
the perfect stop-off along the
way. We arrived around 10 and
had no problem seating
ourselves. By 10:30, though, the
fog had broken and almost si
multaneously the little restau
rant (it seats about 50) filled up.
The outdoor patio, a wooden
deck with picnic benches and
large shade umbrellas, was also
very popular and customers
there didn't seem to have trou
ble finding seats for themselves.
Motorcycles and bicycles lined
the front of the patio railing, and
a few local dogs enjoying the
sunshine on the front
porchsteps casually greeted cus
tomers.
Montana moose-lodge style
best describes the mood of the
interior. The wooden walls are
literally covered with photos,
pictures, knick-knacks and signs
For example, a huge, old-time
photograph of Skyline
Boulevard hangs above the
counter with nutrition posters,
wildlife information guides and
motorcycle scenes scattered
around the dining room. Large
paneled windows framed with
calico curtains stretch from ceil
ing to floor. It seemed that many
a cowboy-, hiking- and motor
cycle-boot had kicked into the

wooden diner counter, and the
mellow country-style music
seemed to complete the at
mosphere.
On to the food. The menu is
nothing fancy, and between the
two of us we ordered a cheese
omelette ($3.75) and French
toast ($2.75), orange juice (alas,
not fresh) and coffee. The
omelette was the most en
joyable, with plenty of cheese
(cheddar, jack, Swiss or Ameri
can) and garnished with parsley
and a dash of paprika. With the
omelette came "camp-style"
hash browns, potato chunks
deep-fried to a crispy brown.
They were a little greasy, which
wasn't surprising, but on the
whole quite good. Toast is in
cluded, with a choice of wheat,
white or rye.
One also has a choice of
breads — wheat or white — with
the French toast. You are not giv
en the option to butter your
own, and unless you specify oth
erwise you'll be given a heavy
dose. The French toast, as with
all the food, is prepared "diner
style." It's good country
cooking — simple, a little greasy
(or buttery, if you prefer), and
usually very satisfying.
The service at Alice's is out
standing. The casual at
mosphere, complete with flan
nel-shirted waitresses in faded
blue jeans, might suggest equal
ly casual service, but this wasn't
the case. We weren't rushed,
even when the place got
crowded, which is unusual to
find these days.

burgers, soup, chili and the like.
