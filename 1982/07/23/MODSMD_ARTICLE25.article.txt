# Authentic Vietnamese—no more, no less

in the midst of the upper-middle-ciass eateries of Palo
Alto where even Chinese food has become com
monplace, the Vietnam Restaurant provides a refreshing
and welcome change. And that change is worth the idio
syncracies you may have to deal with while eating there.
The owners make a definite attempt to meet the Amer
ican standard of a sophisticated restaurant. And in some
ways, it comes close. But even where they totally miss the
mark, it is difficult to complain because the effort is so
sincere.
The restaurant is semi-hidden on a side street in Menlo
Park; only a small sign marks the location. The inner de
cor epitomizes the attempt at elegance. It is small and
clean, with white tablecloths adorning each table. But
just as we sat down, impressed with the tablecloths, we
noticed the constant drone of muzak in the background,
and wished it wasn't there.
But even muzak is tolerable if the food is good. And it
is. Some of the dishes we tried were exceptional. To ac
quire these dishes, however, we had to sort through a
menu which was a little confusing.
There are two basic ordering concepts, which are not
really separated on the menu. The section of the menu
called "Rice Specialities" includes a selection of entire
meals — a main dish with soup and salad. Selections from
the other sections — noodles, soups, special dishes and
salads — are served in portion* large enough to serve
two or three, in the same fashion as Chinese restaurants.
In an attempt to sample a wide variety of things, we

tried both a full meal and a few dishes. The meal was de
scribed as "Steamed rice with BBQ pork on skewers and
BBQ beef with lemon grass and salad and soup and
sauce." My-tho soup, spring rolls and the special
chicken salad completed our selections.
The My-tho soup was basically a noodle soup with
pork, shrimp and a little bit of crab. Because of the mix
ture of meats, its flavor was distinct from other soups I've
tried, and I was therefore pleased with it.
The beef was truly excellent, and the pork was a close
second. The spring rolls — a mixture of pork, beef,

shrimp, crab, carrots and bean sprouts rolled In rice pa
per — were wonderful. The chicken salad was a mixture
of cabbage, chicken, carrots and shrimp tossed in a light
vinegar dressing, and it included a small plate of steamed
rice flour cakes. Our waitress explained that; the salad
was to be put on the cakes and eaten together. The com
bination was quite enjoyable.
The soup and salad which came with the full meal were
very simple, and not very notable.
The house wine (the only one they serve) is Paul
Masson, and we found it to be a good choice. They offer

white,red and pink. Coors and San Miguel beers are also
available.
Expense was not a problem. We completely filled our
stomachs for $14 (half litre of wine included). The larger
dishes ranged from $2 to about $4.95. The chicken salad,
for example, was $2.75; six spring rolls cost $3.20. Com
plete meals ranged from $2,75 to $4.95. The one we or
dered was $4.10.
A problem we encountered, which may or may not
have been caused by our ordering both a complete meal
and separate dishes, was badly timed service. It wasn't
slow; on the contrary, we were presented with more
things than we could handle at one time, and one or two
items were cold by the time we tried them.
But we were comfortable enough sitting at our table
until after the 9 p.m. closing time. And then something
amazing happened. All night, we had seen two different
people; the man who took our order and the woman
who served us. But after nine, there were suddenly three
tables full of people — relatives and friends of the man
agers, no doubt — eating their dinners and involving
themselves in lively Vietnamese conversation. Although
we suddenly felt very Caucasion, we had a marvelous
feeling of eating with the locals.
There were also many interesting drinks offered, in
cluding Vietnamese coffee, coconut soda and sugar cane
JumkK/ /
The restaurant is authentically Vietnamese, but the
food is not so different or the menu so strange that the
place is intimidating. Rather, it is a unique place to go in
the area for that often-needed change of pace.
There is a small market adjoining the restaurant with
various Vietnamese groceries.
