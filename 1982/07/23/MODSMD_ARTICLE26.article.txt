The Awful Truth *★★★
Festival Cinema, Palo Alto
Cary Grant and Irene Dunne
star in this quintessential screw
ball comedy: a lot of stuff hap
pens that doesn't make much
sense but which somehow man
ages to be incredibly funny.
Grant and Dunne play bickering
spouses who, after the divorce
papers have been signed, decide
that maybe a divorce wasn't such
a good idea after all. While get
ting back together again, they
turn each others' lives upside
down in a type of catharsis
through chaos that became the
hallmark of the this type of eprn*
edy. Leo McCarey directed and
wrote the script,
Through Wednesday Hvjth It
Happened One Night

It ; Happened One Night
★★★★
Festival Cinema, Palo Alto
Frank Capra's Depression clas
sic reflected a new era in comedy.
Fast-talking, shrewd, and op
timistic, if proved that Americans
could take something like eco
nomic disaster right in stride.
Capra always worked to show
that, left to their own devices,
people will reveal themselves as
inherently good, and his movies
come close to making you be
lieve it. Here, Clark Gable and
Claudette Colbert star as an un
likely pair of lovers. Thrown to
gether by a bus accident, they try
to get through the ordeal with
their morals and sense of humor
intact.
Plays through Wednesday with
another screwball comedy, The
Awful TrutlifrMt->S'?

Breaker Morant
Fox, Redwood City
Harry "Breaker" Morant is a
lieutenant in the British forces in
south Africa during the Boer
War, He and two other Australian
soldiers are court martialted for
killing a German priest; they are
sacrificial lambs, served up to ap
pease the German government
and world opinion. This account
of their trial, and the events
which led up to it, is an extremely
"well-made" movie, stuffed full
of pretty scenery and historical
significance; while it never quite
catches fire, it stays well above
the boredom threshold.
Plays Saturday and Monday
with Gallipoli.

Shampoo
Sunday, Memorial Auditorium
An American Rules of the
Came, set on the eve of Nixon's
inauguration. The intricate, in
genious script by Robert Towne
(which Warren Beatty hadaffrnd
in) chronicles the sexual esca
pades of a hairdresser and his IA
social circle. The director, Hal
tion, and the com
ic performances with tragic un
derpinnings. The result suggests
l.'AvvenWra played as a Feydeau
farce. Warren Beatty, Julie Christ
ie, Coldie Hawn, and lee Grant,
and Jack Warden have never
been better.

Life of Brian *★
New Varsity, Palo Alto
Sort of like Cadspell with dirty
Jokes. Several brilliant sketches
are lost in the drivel; it's all funny,
but it goes on for much too long.
The Monty Python troupe takes
aim at Biblical epics, terrorist
logistics, and the PIO; while they
don't always score, in this form
even a string of builseyes would
be boring. A Python movie needs
a better plot than the Bible can
provide.
Starts next Thursday with
Bedazzled, which features
Dudley Moore and Racquel
Welch as Lust.

E.T. — The Extraterrestrial
***★
E.T. begins where Steven
Spielberg's Close Encounters
peaked —* with the descent of an
alien craft —• and gets better and
better from there. It's an
absolutely entrancing movie — a
miracle. This tale of a benevolent,
childlike alien's adventure on
earth doesn't contain a moment
of cruelty (though there is a great
deal of suspense), and Spielberg's
vision is so overwhelming that he
makes it difficult to conceive of
cruelty while we are watching the
film. The director uses film
maker's magic to tap into our
feelings, and the result is a movie
of extraordinary emotional
power.

Gregory's Girl ★**
Aquarius, Palo Alto
This Scottish movie about a
high school boy's misadventures
with girls is clumsily made, but
even the messed-up story and ed
iting can't detract from Gregory's
Girl** wit and charm. It features
great ensemble actingfroma cast
composed/ almost entirely of
teenagers. There are half-a
dozen jpnemorable per
formances, but the best is by
Cordon john Sinclair as Gregory,
who manages to merge style and
nerdishness with a facility that's
endearing and enviable. Bill For
syth wrote and directed.

Rock'n'Roll High* School
New Varsity, Palo AHo
American schlock cinema at its
artistic height. Rock'n'Roll High
School is a must-see film about
the glory and energy of high
school revolution. This sleazy lit
tle musical brims with vitality,
verve, and the punk-rock music
of the Ramones. The indomitable
P.J. Soles is featured.
Tonight only with Rocky Hor
ror Picture Show.
— Dana Polan

Diva **** J
Aquarius, Palo Alto
The high-tech chic of Diva,
directed by lean-jacques Belnix
and shot by Philippe Rousselot, is
dazzling. You can't complain that
Diva doesn't mean anything, be
cause Beinix's style and the
weightless shimmer of Hilton
McConnico's interior designs de
clare it in every frame. Of course,
in Diva style is content.
Its story is so beautifully
farfetched that it acquires its own
logic. It revolves around the fixa
tion of a Jules, a young mailman
(Frederic Andrei) for a black op
era siftger (Wilhelmenia Wiggins
Fernandez). The singer nevfet
records, but Jules manages to
record one of her concerts.
When thai tape becomes
switched with a recordilg of an
expose by the mistress of a vice
chief, the movie slips into its own
giddy self-consciousnesS.

Poltergeist ★★
Park Theater, Menlo Park
This movie is terribly efficient
— it gets to you — but I didn't
have much fun at it. I felt bar
raged by all the closeups and the
Dolby sound from the beginning,
long before the ghosts took over.
The film is so loud and relentless
throughout that it doesn't have
anywhere to go but straight to its
rather ludicrous big finish, with
skeletons popping up all over the
neighborhood and houses flam
ing and folding. The film's main
bright spots come not through
the special effects but through
the actors. Jobeth Williams is
touchingly earnest as the per
sistent, Joving mother, and Zelda
Rubenstein brings such an un
usual, quicksilver charm to her
role of medium-for-hire that she
nearly redeems the most self-se
rious scenes.

Star Trek II ★★Vi
Mountain View Theater
HRn enjoyably dopey movie,
which strolls fearlessly down the
d$k corridor that lies between
pretentiousness and utter
gibsurdity. Most of the cast of the
'60s television series is back. The
•characters have been given pro
motions (except, rather upset
tingly, Uhura, who's still in her
old position of hyper-space sec
retary), but the dialogue they
speak is still as weirdly stilted as
ever. Nicholas Meyer, who
directed the often charming sci
ence fantasy Time After Time, is
at the helm, and does a good job
of keeping things moving fast
enough so the movie never really
grates on you.

Annie ★
Old Mill, Mountain View
Carol Burnett, who sings a
song called "Little Girls" and is
very funny and unpleasant, is vir
tually the only thing this over
long, overblown, overloud and
tuneless musical has going for it.
See it only if you want to hear
"Tomorrow" until your ears
ache.
John Huston directed, ineptly.
The talented, and mostly wasted,
cast inludes Albert Finney,
Bernadette Peters, and Ann Re
inking.
