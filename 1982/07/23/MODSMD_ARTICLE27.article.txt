Dems fail to deflect tax increase
Washington — Outnumbered Senate Democrats took
their best shot Wednesday but failed to dent a Re
publican-sponsored bill that would produce the biggest
tax increase in history.
On a nearly party-line vote of 54-45, the GOP-con
trolled Senate rejected a Democratic alternative that
would have eliminated some tax increases on lower- and
middle-income families and required the nation's
wealthiest people to wait for further tax relief until the
federal budget is balanced.
"That is not too much to ask" of upper-income Ameri
cans as the government tries to cut the federal deficit,
said Sen. Bill Bradley (D-N.J.), chief sponsor of the Dem
ocratic version. "If this bill is about fairness, this is clearly
the fairness amendment."
Sen. Bob Dole (R-Kan.), manager of the GOP bill, said
Bradley's plan would "cut the only tax relief the middle
income taxpayers have had in years" and would risk a
presidential veto of the entire package because it tam
pers with the scheduled 1903 tax cut.
With that major Democratic challenge out of the way,
the Senate began disposing of other amendments to the
bill, which would raise taxes by $99 billion and cut spend
ing for Medicare and Medicaid by $17.5 billion over the
next three years. That money will be used to cut the fed
eral deficit in hopes that will produce lower interest
rates.
Hitachi dodges arraignment
San Jose, Calif. — Eight employees and a former em
ployee of Hitachi Ltd., indicted by a grand jury in an al
leged scheme to send stolen computer secrets to japan,
failed to appear for arraignment yesterday, and a U.S.
magistrate issued warrants for their arrest.
Assistant U.S. Attorney Greg Ward refused comment
when a reporter asked whether the government would
seek extradition of the accused.
All the defendants, charged with conspiring to have
documents, tapes and computer components stolen
from International Business Machines sent to their own
country, are believed to be in Japan. If convicted, they
could each draw a maximum penalty of five years in pris
on and a $10,000 fine.
U.S. Magistrate Nordin Blacker increased their bail
from $200,000 to $250,000 on Ward's motion.
At about the same time, one of four Mitsubishi Electric
Corp. employees indicted Monday forallegedly conspir
ing to transport stolen computer secrets to the home
company, appeared and entered an innocent plea.
He was Takaya Ishida, who remains free on $250,000
bail. Eight others also charged in the Hitachi case already
have pleaded innocent.
The men who failed to appear are Kisaburo Nakazawa,
general manager of Hitachi's Kanagawa Works; Takehiro
Inoue, department manager, Kanagawa Works;
Michihiro Hirai, senior engineer, Kanagawa Works;
Katsuro Hirai, senior engineer, Kanagawa Works;
Katsuhiko Kato, department managerr, Odawara Works;
Jun Naruse, senior engineer, Software Works, Hitachi
plant; Teruji Yamamoto, senior engineer, Software
Works, Hitachi plant; former Hitachi engineer Katsumi
Takeda; Sadao Kowano, Odawara Works department
manager.
The government prosecutor said Hitachi as a firm, also
charged, would answer the indictment July 29, repre
sented by attorney Peter Fleming of New York City.
Ward said he had been contacted by a Hitachi represent
ative who asked for a week's delay of arraignment.
Four other Hitachi employees in this country and a
Japanese-American businessman already have entered

innocent pleas on the charges.
Truce violations provoke Israelis
Jerusalem — Israel said yesterday that its air and artil
lery attacks on Syrian and Palestine Liberation Organiza
tion positions in Lebanon were in retaliation for cease
fire violations and were not the start of the long-threat
ened military campaign to drive the PLO out of West
Beirut.
Officials said that the Israeli cabinet ordered the new
round of attacks to punish the PLO and Syrians for a
series of truce violations culminating with a PLO ambush
which killed five Israeli soldiers Wednesday in the Bekaa
Valley.
The officials said that Israel struck at both Syrian and
PLO targets because the guerrillas who staged the am
bush operated from behind Syrian lines and were aided
by the Syrian forces.
"Syria will not be able to evade its responsibility for
what goes on in territory under its control," the military
command said in a communique.
"The action of the Israeli army today demonstrates this
policy and, if this is understood, the cease-fire will con
tinue. But if the Syrians do not desist from their practice
(of allowing PLO forces to attack Israeli targets from Syr
ian-controlled areas), the Israeli army will act at the time,
place and in the intensity of its own choosing," the com
munique said.
About two hours after the raids began, Israel ordered a
renewed cease-fire. The military said that it was holding
several hours after the bombardment.
Officials were careful to separate the attacks from the
stalemated talks aimed at convincing the PLO to leave
West Beirut peacefully.
Israel has been threatening for weeks to use military
means to force the PLO to evacuate Lebanon if diplomat
ic efforts failed. Military sources have hinted that the as
sault probably would begin with limited operations,
rather than an all-out invasion of the Lebanese capital.
State to sue to block offshore wells
Sacramento — Gov. Edmund Brown said Wednesday
that California will file a suit against Interior Secretary
James Watt's decision to open the U.S. coast for oil and
gas drilling.
Brown's spokesman, Richard Steffen, said California
will join the State of Alaska "and a number of environ
mental groups" in a suit filed yesterday in a U.S. District
Court in Washington, D.C..
Steffen said the suit will oppose drilling in "key en
vironmentally sensitive areas" such as the coasts of Hum
boldt, San Diego and Santa Cruz counties, Santa Monica
Bay, and Orange County off Newport Beach.
Brown has filed numerous suits against offshore drill
ing. Steffen said one of the suits was upheld, and the San
ta Maria Basin, off the Santa Barbara County coast, is now
protected.
The areas on which Brown is taking aim were de
termined to be sensitive in environmental impact re
ports a couple of years ago, Steffen said.
Watt said he anticipated suits by California and Alaska
Steffen said Brown denied Watt's allegation that such
suits would be filed for political reasons.
Brown based his decision to sue on news reports. Stef
fen said he had not yet received official notice of Watt's
plan.
Watt said the plan to sell a billion acres in 41 sales in the
next five years would "enhance the national security
prov.de jobs and protect the environment while making
America less dependent on foreign oil sources "

Libyan contraband case cracked
Washington — The Justice Department, in crackii
what it yesterday claimed is the largest case of sell
contraband U.S. military equipment overseas, was
ing with information supplied by indicted former CI
agent Edwin Wilson, who allegedly was trying to put
competitor out of business.
Sources said Wilson, awaiting trial on chargesofsuj
plying terrorist equipment to Libyan president Q
Muammar Qaddafi, steered federal prosecutors tow
Tencom Corp., a Chicago firm accused by theJusticeDi
partment of supplying Qaddafi with $14 million inai
craft parts.
Early last year, State Department officials received
anonymous letter from Britain alleging that Tencom*
shipping such parts to Libya in violation of a U.S.ei
bargo.
Later in the year Wilson met secretly in Rome with
U.S. federal prosecutor and fingered Tencom. Attl
time, he was wanted by U.S. authorities and was trying
negotiate terms under which he would return tod
country.
In naming Tencom, he seemed to be "trying toput
competitor out of business," another prosecutor said
court yesterday.
The same day in Chicago, a federal grand jury indicti
Tencom, its top two officials and Qaddafi's personalpi)
for shipping $14 million worth of parts for C-130tran
port planes and C-47 helicopters to Libya.
Wilson, recently lured from Liby a in an elaborj
scheme and arrested, is being held on $20 millionb
here awaiting trial on the charges of supplying Qadda
Myles Ambrose, attorney for Tencom and its pre
dent, Nedim Sulyak, 30, a native of Turkey, said hisdiei
never intended to break the law. He said thatthedestin
tion of most of the 60 shipments to Libya was dear
marked and that they contained parts that could be us

Hill fights over budget compliance
Washington — The Senate Budget Committee sent
second big package of spending cuts to the Senateflo
yesterday after declaring the Senate's Republican-cm
trolled committees to be in full compliance with mai
dates of the budget that Congress approved last montl
But in the House, the Democratic majority wasbalkii
and the Republican minority was threatening an ali o
fight to force total compliance. Possible tactics indtK
demanding action on spending cuts before tax increas
and pushing for an omnibus substitute patterned aft
their winning budget alternatives of last year.
"All bets are off," said a House Republican leadersh
aide. "If it takes some procedural fighting or an attem(
to wrap it all up in one package, we'll do it."
House Speaker Thomas (Tip) O'Neill (D-Mass.) got'
his licks, too, accusing the Republicans of
catch-all package of cuts because they are afraid of pf
gram-by-program votes.
"They haven't got the courage to vote on individu
bills and let the people know where they stand,
O'Neill, who wants to break down the spending cuts" 1
several packages.
In the Senate, the measure approved by the Bud?
Committee Thursday included $12.3 billion in spen
cuts over the next three years, taken largely from cos
living increases in federal retirees' pensions and
food stamps and dairy price supports — all app ro
earlier by other Senate committees.

Truce violations provoke Israelis
Jerusalem — Israel said yesterday that its air and artil
lery attacks on Syrian and Palestine Liberation Organiza
tion positions in Lebanon were in retaliation for cease
fire violations and were not the start of the long-threat
ened military campaign to drive the PLO out of West
Beirut.
Officials said that the Israeli cabinet ordered the new
round of attacks to punish the PLO and Syrians for a
series of truce violations culminating with a PLO ambush
which killed five Israeli soldiers Wednesday in the Bekaa
Valley.
The officials said that Israel struck at both Syrian and
PLO targets because the guerrillas who staged the am
bush operated from behind Syrian lines and were aided
by the Syrian forces.
"Syria will not be able to evade its responsibility for
what goes on in territory under its control," the military
command said in a communique.
"The action of the Israeli army today demonstrates this
policy and, if this is understood, the cease-fire will con
tinue. But if the Syrians do not desist from their practice
(of allowing PLO forces to attack Israeli targets from Syr
ian-controlled areas), the Israeli army will act at the time,
place and in the intensity of its own choosing," the com
munique said.
About two hours after the raids began, Israel ordered a
renewed cease-fire. The military said that it was holding
several hours after the bombardment.
Officials were careful to separate the attacks from the
stalemated talks aimed at convincing the PLO to leave
West Beirut peacefully.
Israel has been threatening for weeks to use military
means to force the PLO to evacuate Lebanon if diplomat
ic efforts failed. Military sources have hinted that the as
sault probably would begin with limited operations,
rather than an all-out invasion of the Lebanese capital.
State to sue to block offshore wells
Sacramento — Gov. Edmund Brown said Wednesday
that California will file a suit against Interior Secretary
James Watt's decision to open the U.S. coast for oil and
gas drilling.
Brown's spokesman, Richard Steffen, said California
will join the State of Alaska "and a number of environ
mental groups" in a suit filed yesterday in a U.S. District
Court in Washington, D.C..
Steffen said the suit will oppose drilling in "key en
vironmentally sensitive areas" such as the coasts of Hum
boldt, San Diego and Santa Cruz counties, Santa Monica
Bay, and Orange County off Newport Beach.
Brown has filed numerous suits against offshore drill
ing. Steffen said one of the suits was upheld, and the San
ta Maria Basin, off the Santa Barbara County coast, is now
protected.
The areas on which Brown is taking aim were de
termined to be sensitive in environmental impact re
ports a couple of years ago, Steffen said.
Watt said he anticipated suits by California and Alaska
Steffen said Brown denied Watt's allegation that such
suits would be filed for political reasons.
Brown based his decision to sue on news reports. Stef
fen said he had not yet received official notice of Watt's
plan.
Watt said the plan to sell a billion acres in 41 sales in the
next five years would "enhance the national security
prov.de jobs and protect the environment while making
America less dependent on foreign oil sources "

Libyan contraband case cracked
Washington — The Justice Department, in crackii
what it yesterday claimed is the largest case of sell
contraband U.S. military equipment overseas, was

agent Edwin Wilson, who allegedly was trying to put
competitor out of business.
Sources said Wilson, awaiting trial on chargesofsuj
plying terrorist equipment to Libyan president Q
Muammar Qaddafi, steered federal prosecutors tow
Tencom Corp., a Chicago firm accused by theJusticeDi
partment of supplying Qaddafi with $14 million inai
craft parts.
Early last year, State Department officials received
anonymous letter from Britain alleging that Tencom*
shipping such parts to Libya in violation of a U.S.ei
bargo.
Later in the year Wilson met secretly in Rome with
U.S. federal prosecutor and fingered Tencom. Attl
time, he was wanted by U.S. authorities and was trying
negotiate terms under which he would return tod
country.
In naming Tencom, he seemed to be "trying toput
competitor out of business," another prosecutor said
court yesterday.
The same day in Chicago, a federal grand jury indicti
Tencom, its top two officials and Qaddafi's personalpi)
for shipping $14 million worth of parts for C-130tran
port planes and C-47 helicopters to Libya.
Wilson, recently lured from Liby a in an elaborj
scheme and arrested, is being held on $20 millionb
here awaiting trial on the charges of supplying Qadda
Myles Ambrose, attorney for Tencom and its pre
dent, Nedim Sulyak, 30, a native of Turkey, said hisdiei
never intended to break the law. He said thatthedestin

Hill fights over budget compliance
Washington — The Senate Budget Committee sent
second big package of spending cuts to the Senateflo
yesterday after declaring the Senate's Republican-cm

dates of the budget that Congress approved last montl
But in the House, the Democratic majority wasbalkii
and the Republican minority was threatening an ali o
fight to force total compliance. Possible tactics indtK
demanding action on spending cuts before tax increas
and pushing for an omnibus substitute patterned aft
their winning budget alternatives of last year.
"All bets are off," said a House Republican leadersh
aide. "If it takes some procedural fighting or an attem(
to wrap it all up in one package, we'll do it."
House Speaker Thomas (Tip) O'Neill (D-Mass.) got'
his licks, too, accusing the Republicans of
catch-all package of cuts because they are afraid of pf
gram-by-program votes.
"They haven't got the courage to vote on individu

O'Neill, who wants to break down the spending cuts" 1
several packages.
In the Senate, the measure approved by the Bud?

food stamps and dairy price supports — all app ro
earlier by other Senate committees.

Dems fail to deflect tax increase
Washington — Outnumbered Senate Democrats took
their best shot Wednesday but failed to dent a Re
publican-sponsored bill that would produce the biggest
tax increase in history.
On a nearly party-line vote of 54-45, the GOP-con
trolled Senate rejected a Democratic alternative that
would have eliminated some tax increases on lower- and
middle-income families and required the nation's
wealthiest people to wait for further tax relief until the
federal budget is balanced.
"That is not too much to ask" of upper-income Ameri
cans as the government tries to cut the federal deficit,
said Sen. Bill Bradley (D-N.J.), chief sponsor of the Dem
ocratic version. "If this bill is about fairness, this is clearly
the fairness amendment."
Sen. Bob Dole (R-Kan.), manager of the GOP bill, said
Bradley's plan would "cut the only tax relief the middle
income taxpayers have had in years" and would risk a
presidential veto of the entire package because it tam
pers with the scheduled 1903 tax cut.
With that major Democratic challenge out of the way,
the Senate began disposing of other amendments to the
bill, which would raise taxes by $99 billion and cut spend
ing for Medicare and Medicaid by $17.5 billion over the
next three years. That money will be used to cut the fed
eral deficit in hopes that will produce lower interest
rates.
Hitachi dodges arraignment
San Jose, Calif. — Eight employees and a former em
ployee of Hitachi Ltd., indicted by a grand jury in an al
leged scheme to send stolen computer secrets to japan,
failed to appear for arraignment yesterday, and a U.S.
magistrate issued warrants for their arrest.
Assistant U.S. Attorney Greg Ward refused comment
when a reporter asked whether the government would
seek extradition of the accused.
All the defendants, charged with conspiring to have
documents, tapes and computer components stolen
from International Business Machines sent to their own
country, are believed to be in Japan. If convicted, they
could each draw a maximum penalty of five years in pris
on and a $10,000 fine.
U.S. Magistrate Nordin Blacker increased their bail
from $200,000 to $250,000 on Ward's motion.
At about the same time, one of four Mitsubishi Electric
Corp. employees indicted Monday forallegedly conspir
ing to transport stolen computer secrets to the home
company, appeared and entered an innocent plea.
He was Takaya Ishida, who remains free on $250,000
bail. Eight others also charged in the Hitachi case already
have pleaded innocent.
The men who failed to appear are Kisaburo Nakazawa,
general manager of Hitachi's Kanagawa Works; Takehiro
Inoue, department manager, Kanagawa Works;

mental groups" in a suit filed yesterday in a U.S. District
Court in Washington, D.C..
Steffen said the suit will oppose drilling in "key en
vironmentally sensitive areas" such as the coasts of Hum
boldt, San Diego and Santa Cruz counties, Santa Monica
Bay, and Orange County off Newport Beach.
Brown has filed numerous suits against offshore drill
ing. Steffen said one of the suits was upheld, and the San
ta Maria Basin, off the Santa Barbara County coast, is now
protected.
The areas on which Brown is taking aim were de
termined to be sensitive in environmental impact re
ports a couple of years ago, Steffen said.
Watt said he anticipated suits by California and Alaska
Steffen said Brown denied Watt's allegation that such
suits would be filed for political reasons.
Brown based his decision to sue on news reports. Stef
fen said he had not yet received official notice of Watt's
plan.
Watt said the plan to sell a billion acres in 41 sales in the
next five years would "enhance the national security
prov.de jobs and protect the environment while making
America less dependent on foreign oil sources "

Hill fights over budget compliance
Washington — The Senate Budget Committee sent
second big package of spending cuts to the Senateflo
yesterday after declaring the Senate's Republican-cm
trolled committees to be in full compliance with mai
dates of the budget that Congress approved last montl
But in the House, the Democratic majority wasbalkii
and the Republican minority was threatening an ali o
fight to force total compliance. Possible tactics indtK
demanding action on spending cuts before tax increas
and pushing for an omnibus substitute patterned aft
their winning budget alternatives of last year.
"All bets are off," said a House Republican leadersh
aide. "If it takes some procedural fighting or an attem(
to wrap it all up in one package, we'll do it."
House Speaker Thomas (Tip) O'Neill (D-Mass.) got'
his licks, too, accusing the Republicans of
catch-all package of cuts because they are afraid of pf
gram-by-program votes.
"They haven't got the courage to vote on individu
bills and let the people know where they stand,
O'Neill, who wants to break down the spending cuts" 1

In the Senate, the measure approved by the Bud?
Committee Thursday included $12.3 billion in spen
cuts over the next three years, taken largely from cos
living increases in federal retirees' pensions and
food stamps and dairy price supports — all app ro
earlier by other Senate committees.
