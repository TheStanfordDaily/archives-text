# Technology transfer: essential but tricky

Calling interaction between univer
sities and industry "essential," Dean of
Graduate Studies and Research Gerald
Lieberman nevertheless warned mem
bers of the Society for Industrial and Ap
plied Mathematics (SIAM) yesterday that
care must be taken not to "divert faculty
from their primary mission of teaching
and research."
Lieberman spoke at a session on the
transfer of new technology from univer
sities to industry, which was sponsored by
SIAM as part of its week-long conference
here. Representatives of SRI International
and Varian Associates also participated.
Stanford has a long history of com
mercializing the discoveries made in its
research labs. Varian Associates President
Edward Ginzton recalled that in 1937 the
University granted two men permission
to use a room in the physics lab in return
for a 50 percent interest in their inven
tions. The result was the klystron tube,

which led directly to the development of
radar, and so became vital to the allies in
World War 11.
More recently, conflicting interests of
researchers, government claims that sen
sitive results are flowing to foreign ad
versaries, and the need to supplement
shrinking government grants have caused
universities and other non-profit re
search establishments to re-examine the
ways in which new technology finds its
way to the market.
SRI International, the non-profit re
search organization spun off from the
University in 1970, has instituted a new
mechanism for technology transfer, Pres
ident William Miller announced.
"We decided that we wanted to more
aggressively develop our own technolo
gies," most of which result from govern
ment research contracts, Miller said. To
that end, SRI formed a wholly owned
profit-seeking subsidiary, which in turn
entered a partnership with an investment
bank and venture capitalists.

"They will either license on our behalf,
or form start-up companies" to exploit
technologies invented at SRI, Miller said.
He cited the need to keep SRI at "arm's
length" from the business of marketing its
technology to prevent conflicts of in
terest. SRI inventors keep a financial in
terest in any patents resulting from their
work.
The University avoids entering into
agreements giving a company prior ex
clusive rights to the future output of re
search programs since "incentives for
proprietary secrecy" might result,
Lieberman said. But once a discovery is
made and announced, an exclusive
license may be issued as an incentive for a
company to bring the technology to mar
ket, especially if extensive development
work is required.
Industrial funds now account for about
five percent of the university's research
volume, and Lieberman said this is ex

pected to double within several years.
Lieberman criticized recent efforts by
the federal government to stem the flow
of sensitive technology abroad by restrict
ing the free exchange of even unclassified
research results.
"Universities, government and in
dustries must seek reasonable solutions
to this vexing problem," he said.
SIAM members were particularly in
terested in the commercial exploitation
of computer programs and mathematical
results. Hirsh Cohen, chairman of IBM's
Research Review Board and moderator of
the session, noted that although pro
grams cannot be patented, they often are
the key ingredient in patentable inven
tions, such as the sophisticated X-ray ma
chines known as CAT scanners.
Lieberman said that the University has a
policy prohibiting faculty from withhold
ing programs from colleagues who wish
to use them for research purposes.
