## Peace marchers visit Soviet Union 
### Los Angeles Times 
Moscow — Three hundred
Scandinavian women, the first
foreign peace marchers allowed
into the Soviet Union, arrived
here Wednesday for a festive
anti-nuclear demonstration
carefully managed by Soviet au
thorities.
Bearing banners and white
flags emblazoned with symbolic
doves, the women arrived by
train at Moscow's Riga Station
where a hand-picked crowd of
Soviet demonstrators greeted
them with professionally made
banners of their own condemn
ing nuclear war, missiles in Eu
rope and the American neutron
bomb.
Most of the about 100 Soviet
demonstrators refused to speak
with Western reporters. A few,
however, acknowledged that
Komsomol Youth Organization
leaders in their institutes and fac
tories had designated them to
carry anti-nuclear placards.
Dozens of plainclothes agents

circulated through the crowd of
Scandinavian and Soviet demon
strators during a round of
speeches.
In some case's the agents sur
reptitiously recorded conversa
tions between the women and
Western reporters.
The Scandinavian women are
half way through a 10-day tour of
six Soviet cities organized after
lengthy negotiations with the
state-run Soviet Peace Commit
tee.
Some of the women com
plained that Soviet authorities
appeared not to be advertising
when and where they would ap
pear.
The official Soviet press has
given the march detailed cov
erage, using it to suggest an un
equivocal endorsement by for
eign peace groups of President
Leonid Brezhnev's arms control
proposals. The marchers' itiner
ary, however, has been a well
kept secret.
