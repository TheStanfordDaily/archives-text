# Allies to judge Polish detente

### Washington Post 
Washington â€” Poland's relaxation of martial law
falls far short of steps required to lift U.S. sanctions
imposed on that nation, administration officials
told Congress Wednesday, even though the Unit
ed States is reserving formal judgment on the
Polish move until a joint evaluation by the Atlantic
Alliance.
White House deputy press secretary Larry
Speakes said, "We will evaluate the statement by
the Polish government after we consult with allies
before we offer any further interpretations of it."
The allies agreed privately and in advance on
that position. It was intended to head off further
division on the fate of the tougher U.S. sanctions
tied to Poland's resort to martial law last Decem
ber.
The Reagan administration is at odds with its al
lies over a ban on U.S.-licensed equipment for a
natural gas pipeline from Siberia to Western Eu
rope.
At the same time, administration officials told a
House appropriations subcommittee that there is
insufficient evidence that repression has been re
laxed in Poland to warrant an end to sanctions.
"We really have to see what the actions mean,"
said Marc Leland, an assistant secretary of the
treasury. But Leland added, "We know what we
are looking for, and so far it is not there."
U.S. conditions
Speaking for the State Department, Ambassador
Charles Meissner, a specialist on East-West eco
nomic affairs, stressed, as did Speakes at the White
House, that the North Atlantic Treaty Organization
laid down three conditions for lifting the Polish-re
lated sanctions:
"Releasing the political detainees, ending
martial law and reopening a meaningful dialogue
with the church and with Solidarity," the sup
pressed, independent Polish trade union.
Meissner's prepared statement, drafted before
the announcement about relaxation of martial law,
said: "Unfortunately, we have seen little indica
tion thus far that the (Polish) government is pre
pared to make meaningful steps either toward rec
onciliation or toward reinvigorating (its) faltering
economy."
Nothing but criticism of Poland's continuing
rule came in the House subcommittee hearing.
Rep. David Obey ( D-Wis.), who closely follows
events in Poland, said he was "greatly disap
pointed" by the statement of Gen. Wojciech
Jaruzelski on relaxation of martial law. Obey said
Jaruzelski "has missed an opportunity to establish

a more constructive relationship between the
United States and his country..."
Many other subcommittee members, notably
Chairman Clarence Long (D-Md.) and all of the
Republicans present, criticized the administration
for failing to be even tougher in its demands on Po
land and the Soviet Union.
Zdzislaw Rurarz, Poland's former ambassador to
Japan, who defected when martial law was de
clared in Poland last December, scoffed at the con
cessions announced in Warsaw Wednesday.
"Without democratization, without real dialogue,
nothing will be settled in Poland," he told the
panel.
For several weeks, there has been widespread
speculation in the East and the West on whether
Poland's Communist rulers could isolate the Unit
ed States by lifting military rule enough to satisfy
Western Europe but not the administration.
To that extent, administration officials appeared
relieved Wednesday that the United States was not
left in a more difficult position by Jaruzelski's an
nouncement.
West Germany, however, responded more ap
provingly to the Polish decision, with government
spokesman Lothar Ruehl labeling the announce
ment a "step in the right direction."
Economic penalties
In contrast to the eagerness of many Western Eu
ropean nations to restore normal relations with Po
land, U.S. officials testified that economic penal
ties on Poland are serving their purpose.
"Allied sanctions toward Poland have been
highly effective in maintaining economic pressure
on both the government of Poland and the Soviet
leadership," Meissner testified.
"With no new Western credits going to Poland,"
he said, "and with Poland being pressed to repay
its debt, there is a net financial flow from Poland to
the West, and the Soviets have been obliged to
transfer significant amounts of real resources to
Poland to prevent further economic de
terioration."
Poland's debt to the West at the end of 1981 was
$26 billion, the Treasury's Leland said, compared to
a Soviet indebtedness to the West of $21 billion.
Administration witnesses again resisted con
gressional demands to declare Poland in default
on its debts on grounds that a default would gain
nothing for the West and would produce instead
greater allied discord. "Anything we do unilat
erally," Leland said, "is not effective."
