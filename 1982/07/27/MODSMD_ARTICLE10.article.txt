## Pizzeria would give Boathouse new life 
### 
In her viewpoint (Daily, July
16), Carolyn Brown stated her
opposition to the placement of a
pizzeria near the Boathouse at
Lake Lagunita. We feel it is im
portant that she and other stu
dents understand the process of
decay which the Boathouse has
been suffering from, and our
plans for renovating the facility
and developing new services to
convert the area into a lakeside
Recreation Center.
Over the past several years the
Boathouse has been trans
formed from a public oriented
facility to a home and social club
for a small circle of students who
lived there. They closed the pub
lic locker rooms and restrooms

to increase the number of
Boathouse residents. At the
same time, the facility was un
kept, the decks were left to rot,
the barbecue was left broken,
and the facility was unusable for
most Stanford students.
In light of this degenerative
process, the ASSU has decided
that the Lakeside Recreation
Center needs a breath of new
life and a steady source of fund
ing for future improvement and
growth. The construction of a
picnic area and a small take-out
pizzeria would only enhancethe
area by allowing more students
to enjoy the lake, while provid
ing students in the dorms with a
quality alternative to Pizza Ex
press.
While increasing access to this
facility to the Stanford com
munity may destroy some of the
charm a few associate with its
isolation, we think you will agree
that it is in the interests of the
students as a whole to make the
Boathouse enjoyable for ev
eryone.

Leave posters alone
Several Stanford student or
ganizations and friends have re
cently been posting leaflets and
posters depicting the plight of
the Lebanese and Palestinian
people caused by the latest Is
raeli invasion of Lebanon. The
devastation and the casualties
among civilians are un
mistakable. These posters draw
upon information provided by
independent news agencies and
relief organizations.
However, we have been great
ly frustrated and baffled by the
continuing removal of such ma
terial from numerous places
properly designated for posting.
We think that such actions by
individuals constitute a decep
tion of the Stanford community
and a violation of its right to a
free flow of information repre
senting various viewpoints.
