I win the fourth annual Chariot
jp. More than 65 teams from
ross the nation participated in
e event, formerly called the
Kporate Cup Relays, which is
onsored by Runn&*s' World
agazine.
Saturday saw only four relay
ials as much of the day was
ent qualifying teams for Sun
ly's events, but in every one
e national Corporate Cup rec
ti was broken.
In the Class A Master's Relay, a
fflne-and-a-quarter mile race in
Which each team member is 40
||r over, the State of California
iiirned in a time of 5:40.5, break-
Hig the old record by four sec
nds. In the next final, the Pre
dio of San Francisco ran the
lass A Executive Relay in
8:28.4, smashing their own
lark of 18:52.2. The executives,
fho had to be at the level of
lanager or above and at least 30
ears old, ran two-mile, one
[lile, half-mile and quarter-mile
Michael James & Associates
fon the Class B Men's Mile team
ace in a respectable time of
:29.2 (an average of 4:45 for
ach of the two runners) and
rimmed 8 seconds off of the na
tional mark. In the last final of
the day, the Class AA Open Re-
Bay (a five-man relay with legs of
three miles, two miles, one mile,
l|)ne mile and an anchor leg of a
■half mile), Rockwell Interna-
I jional destroyed the old record
B>f 35:09.7 by over a minute, post
ng a time of 34:06.5.
The Men's Ten Kilometer
load Race, first race of the day
>n Sunday, proved to be one of
he more exciting. The leaders
vere bunched in a pack for the
irst three miles; then Doug
(urtis of Ford Motor Company
bulled 30 to 50 yards ahead. After
mother mile, Randy Stroud of
Jell Systems (AT & T) joined
Curtis and together they pulled
100 yards ahead of the pack.
With half a mile to go, Kurtis
Hilled away from Stroud and fin

ished in 30:07.6, an excellent 10-
kilometer time, while Stroud fell
back to third. The race was so
competitive that the 100 th fin
isher came across the line in
35:17. After the race, Stroud,
who works for Bell in Atlanta, at
tributed the times to the good
weather and the relatively flat
course.
After the ceremonies, Lou
Putman of Bell explained the
strategy behind winning the
Cup. Since points are awarded
for the first 10 places in each
race, the idea is to place your
team into as many finals as pos
• sible. The runners can only enter
three events, so the captain tries
to place them where they will
add up to the best team score.
The Sprint Relay proved to be
the most exciting race of the day.
Pacific Telephone had a 50-yard
lead after three laps of the one
mile race, but they had used
their fastest runners first, where
as IBM and Texas Instruments
had saved their horses for the
last two 2205. They roared past
the Pacific Telephone runner
with 300 yards to go; both ex
changes were perfect, and the
two anchormen tore up the
track, both finishing under the
old record of 3:26.5 with IBM
edging out T. 1., 3:22.9 to 3:23.0.
The final race of the day, the
Executive Relay, was close to the
wire as well. Bell chased Mont
gomery Securities through the
first two-mile leg and then
moved into first during the one
mile leg with T.I. right behind
them. They passed and repassed
each other over the next quarter
mile, and then Bell pulled ahead
with a lap to go. Asthey rounded
the last corner, the T.I. anchor
man roared back, catching and
then passing Bell with 50 yards to
go. Again, both broke the old
national standard with T.I. win
ning by only 0.4 seconds.
Bell's early lead and depth
proved to be too much for T. 1., as
they took the 1982 Chariot Cup
by scoring 91 points to T.l.'s 82;
General Electric took third, Del
ta fourth and IBM fifth. The State
of California won the Class A,
"non-corporate" section, and
Numisco won Class B.

CORPORATE MUSCLE — Executive runners relay a physical
message in the Runners' World sponsored championship at
the Stadium.
After the meet Bell Systems
took to the track for a team vic
tory lap. And it was a real team
effort, with over 20 runners con
tributing to their win. Bell
runners Randy Stroub, Earl
Owens and Paul Squires stood
out. Stroub placed third in the
10-kilometer road race and
helped Bell place third in the
three-kilometer team race.
Owens placed sixth in the 10-kil
ometer and ran the two-mile leg
in the executive relay. Squires
led Bell to a victory in the mile
team race, ran the one-mile leg
in the executive relay and ran
the three-kilometer race with
Stroub.
Unfortunately, Bell may not

be here in the same form next
year. Only 60 percent of their
team is from AT & T central, the
other 40 percent coming from
the local companies around the
country.
According to Bell runner Tony
D'Andrea, the fate of their team
depends on exactly how the
courts and the FCC break up the
company. One can bet T. 1., IBM,
G.E. and Delta are all hoping the
result is a slightly weaker track
team.
This year the Corporate Cup
Association added a new event,
the media relay. The Stanford
Daily team, which included Jane
Bailie, Don Nagle, Chris
Schneck, and Mark Ziegler,
placed sixth out of 18 teams.
