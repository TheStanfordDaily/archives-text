# Asner appears at El Salvador convocation
## U.S.: a 'biased participant' 
### Carol Anderson 
■ Ed Asner, president of the Screen Actors
■uild, said Sunday that the cancellation of the
lllevision show Lou Grant was due to an "ex
|»ss of freedom of expression."
■ Asner and several other media represent
■ives spoke at a convocation sponsored by the
Hedia Alliance at the Sheraton Palace Hotel in
San Francisco. He said the meeting was in-
Snded to bring together members of the media
Sjlterested in El Salvador.
■ Asner, the keynote speaker, called the
oligarchical government of El Salvador an "out
[lige begging for change." He predicted the
U.S. media would be a major impetus for that
change.
■I But he added, "participants in a democracy
need total access to information." American re
[(farters do not have this total access, he said, be
cause the U.S. government is a "biased partici
pant in El Salvador and no longer a source of in
formation."
| Asner cited evidence from the Central Amer-
Ban University in San Salvador that the "free
Section" conducted by the United States in El
■Ivador was mathematically impossible. He
■id that a free and open government should be
lie objective of U.S. foreign policy, but that the
Bnited States chooses to "perpetuate an
Bigarchy as long as that government is anti-So-
Bet." Asner claimed that President Ronaid Rea
;gan's "Better Dead Than Red" rhetoric con
■itutes the basis for U.S. foreign policy world-
Bide.
B Robert Drinan, a Jesuit priest and professor of
Hw at Georgetown University, followed Asner.
Irinan, formerly a U.S. representative from
lassachusetts, was a major proponent of the
ar Powers Act, which limits the power of the
esident in a time of war.
Drinan predicted that Reagan will certify to
iy that human rights in El Salvador have im
oved in the last six months and that another
66,000,000 in military aid is necessary.
Drinan said that no land reform has occurred
El Salvador. The 55 U.S. "advisers" in El
ilvador are actually orchestrating the war

against the remaining 10,000 guerrillas, he
claimed. Drinan said this information repre
sents a violation of the War Powers Act, whi:h
states that if a president commits troops where
there is war, he must withdraw them within 30
days.
Drinan said the guerrillas could more proper
ly be described as Catholics, who have decided
to fight for social justice as described by Pope
John Paul ll's "liberation theology," than as
Communists. Drinan cited 2829 recorded politi
cal murders committed by the Salvadoran army,
and the fact that national guardsmen charged
with the killingsof four American nunsstillhave
not been tried, as evidence of obvious dis
crepancies in the policy of a supposedly sympa
thetic Salvadoran government.
William Ford, the brother of one of the
murdered nuns, called these women an "em
barrassment" to an uninterested United States
government. He cited instancesof "disinforma
tion" that he and members of the other families
of the nuns claim to have received, and said the
government claims the release of information
about the nuns' deaths would impinge on "na
tional security." In addition, Ford said, the
women were described by United States Am
bassador to the United Nations Jeanne
Kirkpatrick as political activists who deserved
what they got.
Furthermore, said Ford, former Secretary of
State Alexander Haig claimed that the women
were killed in an exchangeof fire while running
a road block. Ford and other members of the
families later asked a state department official
why Haig said this. The official replied that it was
nonsense and that Haig could never have said it.
The state department official had not read the
papers, said Ford. Ford concluded that Haig had
lied to advance American policy.
Ford also cited a New York Times article
which incorrectly called his sister a political ac
tivist. Ford phoned the reporter in San Salvador
and asked if he had ever known or talked to
Ford's sister or any of the three other nuns. The
reporter answered no and that he had received
his information from the American Embassy.
