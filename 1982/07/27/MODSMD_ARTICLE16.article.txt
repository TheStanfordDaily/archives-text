# British trade unionists talk politics here
## 
### David Skidmore 
Four members of the British
labor movement made Stanford
part of their American itinerary
last Thursday, and while here,ex
pressed concerns familiar' to
many an American worker.
Group member Alex Gerlis
told the Daily, "the economic
policies of the Reagan adminis
tration are having the same ad
verse impact on American work
ers as similar policies pursued by
the Thatcher government have
had in Britain."
Larry Whitty, head of the re
search department of the Gen
eral and Municipal Workers
Union, applauded "the decision
the AFL-CIO has taken to at
tempt to make a greater impact
on Democratic Party candidate
selection." He said this kind of
political activism has long been a
feature of British unions, which
have close ties with the Labor
Party.
The group is composed of
three trade union represent
atives, including Gellis (press and

public relations officer of the As
sociation of Professional, Ex
ecutive, Clerical and Computer
Staff), Whitty, and Mark Walker,
a secretary of the National Union
of Railwaymen. Rounding out
the group is Barrie Clark, a Labor
Party official. The group's visit to
the Bay Area focused on study
ing the impact of the local elec
tronics industry on the American
workforce.
Members of the group ex
pressed concern that the com
puter revolution and rapid tech
nological change may ultimately
displace many workers whose
skills are made obsolete. "Peo
ple in this country are not as
aware of the impacts of new
technologies on employment,"
said Gerlis.
Whitty said, "there are two
basic questions to be asked
about new technology: who
controls how it is introduced and
what impact does it have on
workers?" He suggested that re
ducing the hourly work week
might allow for the introduction

of labor-saving technologies
without increasing unemploy
ment.
Unemployment was on the
minds of all four visitors. Recent
statistics show that Britain's un
employment rate has reached a
new post-World War II high of
over 13 percent. Each blamed
Britain's economic troubles on
Prime Minister Margaret
Thatcher's Conservative Party
government. Thatcher has
shown no flexibility in the realm
of national economic policy,
said Clark. Whitty said,
"Thatcher's attitude toward la
bor is, 'You won't get more jobs
until you cut your wages more
and more.' "
But the Labor Party has had
trouble reaping political benefit
from the Conservative govern
ment's inability to solve Britain's
economic puzzle. Whitty said
Thatcher has benefitted from
Britain's recent victory in the
Falklands crisis. "The Conserva
tives were doing poorly before
the Falklands. Now Thatcher has
a 57 percent approval rating, but
it will diminish. We have to be
sure that the benefits rebound to
Labor," he said.
The Labor Party, however, has
been torn by highly publicized
splits. Clark said that prior to
electoral defeat in 1979 the La
bor government "lived on day

to-day policies without con
sistency." Since then the Labor
Party "has allowed greater dem
ocratic participation." Although
Clark pointed out that "basic
policies have now been agreed
to by the Labor Party, the Trade
Union Congress, and Parlia
mentary representatives," he
also acknowledged differences
within the Party.
"Ideological splits have always
been there. The Conservatives
try to portray this as division. It is
healthy debate which strength
ens Labor, though we still
haven't gotten our ballgame to
gether. The Labor Party has been
through crises before. It is not a
divided house, it is a broad
church."
The centrist coalition consist
ing of the newly formed Social
Democratic Party (SDP) and the
Liberal Party also poses prob
lems for the Labor Party. The SDP
was formed by a faction of
former Laborites who split with
the party after a series of dis
putes with Labor's left wing. For
a time, observers were surprised
by the strength shown by the
new SDP-Liberal coalition in the
polls. But Clark claims that the
centrist coalition's purported
strength was a "razzmatazz crea
tion of the media."
Whitty said, "organized capi-

tal, through the media, wante
to create an alternative to l<
bor." He called the SDP-Liber
coalition a shaky partnership
which may not last.
Members of the group ha
sharp criticism for the Reaga
administration's policies towar
Europe. Regarding U.S. sani
tions designed to impede con
pletion of the proposed Sovie
West European gas pipelin
Gillis said, "the U.S. is hypocri
ical. The U.S. wants to punishtl
Soviets over Poland but theU.
still supplies the USSR withgraii
Furthermore, the support(Pres
dent Ronald) Reagan has give
to Solidarity does not tie in wit
his own anti-union policies
the U.S."
Clark said, "Reagan h
wholly misjudged the moodi
Europe, especially on theissi
of Pershing missiles. He h
pushed liberals into the peat
movement which is by no meai
Communist controlled."
