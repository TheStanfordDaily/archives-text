Oingo Boingo's music is a
strange mixture of various styles
whose heterogeneous nature
comes off as confused rather
than harmonious. Whether they
are rambling through material
off their new album Nothing To
Fear or reproducing such well
known hits as "You Really Got
Me," their sound-and-fury new
wave rock strikes a definite dis
cordant note, all the time signi
fying nothing. Throughout the
set, in every song, in every meas
ure, between every beat (get the
point?), there was some sort of
instrumental fill, some quirk
thrown at the audience in a
vague hope of attracting atten
tion. No dice. The only time they
even seemed capable of playing
the same song was on "You Real
ly Got Me," again proving the
power of bonehead riffs over
clever gimmicks. One was recur
rently struck with the continual
desire to turn the volume down,
if not off.
I would find it difficult to jus
tify the same action for Squeeze.
Their music, diverse in both style
and context, ranged from the
steady, almost repetitious sound
of "If I Didn't Love You" to the
more constantly shifting "Pull
ing Muscles From A Shell." Since
the release of East Side Story,
Squeeze has taken a slight de
tour from their brand of new
wave rock to a more middle-of
the-road style, reminiscent of
many of their rock contem

poraries in mainstream Hitsville
USA. Take a listen to "Tempted"
sometime — if that isn't in
nocuous, then nothing is. Yet
despite this perhaps inevitable
transition, Squeeze still main
tains a distinctive brand of music
through their unconventional
lyrics. And the music is still in
teresting — I mean, it's easy to
say that Squeeze sounds like a lot
of other folks, but it's hard as hell
to say specifically who.
And at the same time, it's still
possible for Squeeze to be tradi
tionally radical, in true rock fash
ion. It takes a lot of guts to play
tunes like Smokey Robinson's
"Tears of a Clown" or "Rip It
Up" from the original bad boy of
rock and roll (that is, when the
term still meant something), Lit
tle Richard. And still more guts
to do it well, as Squeeze did in
their various encores (this was
the last date of their current U.S.
tour, and so they made the most
of it by making the show last as
long as possible).
Finally, there's the courage to
admit an out-and-out steal of a
melody in front of 1500 fans,
something that's made Nick
Lowe sort of legendary in my
book. There's a song on East Side
Story — I think it's called "In
Quintessence," but I'm not sure.
Anyway, it's a weird title for a
pop song, and pretty dumb, too.
The melody is taken straight
from an old Booker T and the
MGs song, called "Time is Tight"
— apparently a big fave on the
new wave front, because the
Clash have a version of it on their

Black Market Clash EP. When
Squeeze started to play "In
Quintessence," they first played
"Time is Tight," admitting their
thievery to anyone who cared at
the time. Then they went straight
into "In Quintessence," point

ing out the real message of the
song, namely that it doesn't mat
ter where you steal from, as long
as you do the original some jus
tice. That's class. You see, there's
some value in conservatism after
all.

instrumental fill, some quirk
thrown at the audience in a
vague hope of attracting atten
tion. No dice. The only time they
even seemed capable of playing
the same song was on "You Real
ly Got Me," again proving the
power of bonehead riffs over
clever gimmicks. One was recur
rently struck with the continual
desire to turn the volume down,
if not off.
I would find it difficult to jus
tify the same action for Squeeze.
Their music, diverse in both style
and context, ranged from the
steady, almost repetitious sound
of "If I Didn't Love You" to the
more constantly shifting "Pull
ing Muscles From A Shell." Since
the release of East Side Story,
Squeeze has taken a slight de
tour from their brand of new
wave rock to a more middle-of
the-road style, reminiscent of
many of their rock contem

poraries in mainstream Hitsville
USA. Take a listen to "Tempted"
sometime — if that isn't in
nocuous, then nothing is. Yet
despite this perhaps inevitable
transition, Squeeze still main
tains a distinctive brand of music
through their unconventional
lyrics. And the music is still in
teresting — I mean, it's easy to
say that Squeeze sounds like a lot
of other folks, but it's hard as hell
to say specifically who.
And at the same time, it's still
possible for Squeeze to be tradi
tionally radical, in true rock fash
ion. It takes a lot of guts to play
tunes like Smokey Robinson's
"Tears of a Clown" or "Rip It
Up" from the original bad boy of
rock and roll (that is, when the
term still meant something), Lit
tle Richard. And still more guts
to do it well, as Squeeze did in
their various encores (this was
the last date of their current U.S.
tour, and so they made the most
of it by making the show last as
long as possible).
Finally, there's the courage to
admit an out-and-out steal of a
melody in front of 1500 fans,
something that's made Nick
Lowe sort of legendary in my
book. There's a song on East Side
Story — I think it's called "In
Quintessence," but I'm not sure.
Anyway, it's a weird title for a
pop song, and pretty dumb, too.
The melody is taken straight
from an old Booker T and the
MGs song, called "Time is Tight"
— apparently a big fave on the
new wave front, because the
Clash have a version of it on their

Black Market Clash EP. When
Squeeze started to play "In
Quintessence," they first played
"Time is Tight," admitting their
thievery to anyone who cared at
the time. Then they went straight
into "In Quintessence," point

ing out the real message of the
song, namely that it doesn't mat
ter where you steal from, as long
as you do the original some jus
tice. That's class. You see, there's
some value in conservatism after
all.
