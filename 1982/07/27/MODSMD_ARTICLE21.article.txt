Alternate nuclear freeze endorsed
Washington — Fearing damage to his bargaining posi
tion with the Soviet Union, President Ronald Reagan yes
terday condemned a nuclear weapons freeze resolution
pending in the House and endorsed a substitute meas
ure that supports his policies.
The endorsement set up a showdown vote in the Dem
ocratic-controlled House, probably early next week, be
tween the Republican president and the well-organized
nuclear-freeze movement.
Besides its potential impact on U.S.-Soviet arms reduc
tion talks now under way in Geneva, the battle being
waged in Congress could affect current election cam
paigns.
The freeze issue already has been influenced by a
strong undercurrent of election-year politics. Groups
advocating a nuclear weapons freeze say they are raising
at least $2.25 million to help elect candidates who share
their views. The call for a freeze increasingly is becoming
a key plank in the campaign arsenals of Democratic poli
ticians.
The aim of the Reagan-endorsed resolution is to at
tract members of Congress who both want to support
the president's nuclear arms policies and go on record in
favor of a freeze. But it would be a freeze primarily in
name — freezing nuclear forces only after they had
reached "equal and substantially reduced levels" — and
not right now at current levels, as the freeze movement
wants.
A core issue is the current nuclear balance between
the two superpowers. Reagan says the Soviets enjoy "a
definite margin of superiority" in nuclear arms. The Sovi
ets say there is "essential parity." The freeze movement
generally maintains that the nuclear arsenals are basical
ly equal, but argues it really doesn't matter anyway be
cause each nation now has enough weapons to destroy
the other.
U.S. rejects PLO statement
Washington — The Reagan administration yesterday
rejected a statement signed Sunday by Palestine Liber
ation Organization leader Yasser Arafat, saying it did not
recognize "in a clear and unequivocal way" Israel's right
to exist and therefore does not meet U.S. conditions for
dealing with the PLO.
In identical responses, the White House and State De
partment reaffirmed the policy, in effect since 1975, that
the United States will not recognize nor negotiate with
the PLO until it accepts Israel's right to exist and U.N. Se
curity Council resolutions 242 and 338, which have pro
vided the framework for efforts to resolve the Arab-Is
raeli conflict. >
"We have indicated this must be done in a clear and
unequivocal way," said White House deputy press secre
tary Larry Speakes and State Department spokesman
Dean hscher. "The statement by Arafat does not meet
our conditions."
Although U.S. officials would not say so publicly, they
appeared to be in agreement with Israel's contention
that the Arafat statement was not a significant new de
parture in Mideast diplomacy, but a propaganda ploy
aimed at winning world sympathy and support for the
PLO, whose military forces are under Israeli siege in West
Beirut and under pressure to leave Lebanon.
The U.S. statement implied that the administration re
gards the question of PLO recognition as a side issue that
could divert attention from the efforts of President Rea
gan's special Mideast envoy, Philip Habib, to negotiate
relocation of the PLO from Lebanon to other Arab coun
tries.
Habib, meanwhile, yesterday received a strong vote of
confidence from Reagan following revelations that the
retired foreign service officer has been a paid consultant
to the Bechtel Group Inc., an international engineering
firm that has extensive business interests in the Arab
world.
(Habib is also a senior research fellow at the Hoover
Institution.)
At Reagan's behest, the State Department issued a for

mal statement that called Habib "one of the outstanding
public servants of this country" and said that he has' the
full confidence and support" of Reagan and Secretary of
State George Shultz, who is former president of Bechtel.
Israeli jets hit PLO ammo dump
Beirut — Israeli jets scored a direct hit on a huge
Palestinian ammunition dump yesterday, setting off a
chain reaction of explosions that rocked the Lebanese
capital for more than an hour and sent huge plumes of
smoke over the city.
The timing of the attack on Beirut, which was struck by
Israeli jets for the fifth day in a row, may have been a re
ply to the controversial statement signed Sunday by
Palestine Liberation Organization leader Yasser Arafat.
Arafat said in the statement that he was willing to rec
ognize all United Nations resolutions concerning the
Palestinian question.
Coincidence or not, the Israelis bombed the southern
areas of West Beirut for almost an hour in yet another
show of force designed to keep up the pressure and
force the PLO out of Lebanon.
The Israelis, intent on eradicating both the military and
political presence of the PLO, invaded Lebanon on June
6 and have encircled the Palestinian stronghold of West
Beirut since june 13. Durmg the last seven weeks of war,
diplomatic efforts have so far failed to extricate the PLO
from Beirut and disband the guerrillas to other Arab
states.
Israels army colonel resigns
Jerusalem — A well-known Israeli army colonel has re
signed as commander of a combat brigade in Lebanon,
asserting that "his conscience and his outlook did not
permit him to continue taking part in that operation," Is
raeli military officials said Sunday night.
The resignation ofacombatcommandduringwartime
to protest government policy was thought to be a first in
Israel's conflict-filled, 34-year history. It also was another
sign that doubts about the human and political costs of a
military strike into Beirut are beginning to surface as the
Israeli invasion of Lebanon passed the 50-day mark.
Initially there was almost universal support here for
the announced objective of the military operation,
which was to clear the PLO from a 25-mile corridor in
southern Lebanon along Israel's northern border. Even
when Israeli troops moved far beyond the 25-mile goal
there was little public dissent because of the swiftness
and the success of the advance.
McCloskey supports Arafat letter
Beirut — Members of a U.S. congressional delegation
appeared divided yesterday over a one-sentence docu
ment signed by PLO chief Yasser Arafat that some con
tend meets the conditions for U.S. recognition of the
Palestine Liberation Organization.
"They (the PLO) clearly are ready to recognize Israel's
right to exist," Rep. Paul McCloskey (R-Calif.) told a
news conference yesterday, a day after he obtained the
statement from Arafat.
Such PLO acceptance of Israel is the main U.S. prere
quisite for dealing with the Palestinian organization.
But another congressman in the six-member delega
tion called the Arafat statement "at best a rehash," and it
was dismissed in both Washington and Israel. McCloskey
himself acknowledged it could have been more explicit
and unequivocal.
He said Arafat specified he was endorsing U.N. Secur
ity Council Resolution 242, which implies recognition of
Israel, only in the context of other U.N. resolutions. But
neither Israel nor the United States accepts those other
resolutions, which call for establishment of a Palestinian
state.
In Washington, White House spokesman Larry
Speakes said the Arafat statement did not fulfill U.S con
ditions for dealing with the PLO. A senior State Depart
ment official, who asked not to be identified, noted this
formula of 'all U.N. resolutions" includes many resolu-

tions the Un ited States has voted against.
Further complicating the issue was a statementbyi
PLO's observer at the United Nations in New York,Zd
Terzi, who said Arafat told him in a telephone conver
tion Sunday night that Resolution 242 was not indud
in the document signed in Beirut.
But Terzi said Arafat's endorsement did apply toU
General Assembly Resolution 181, which calls forsei
rate Jewish and Palestinian states.
A spokesman for the Israeli Foreign Ministry,,
Pazner, told reporters Israel wants the besieged P
guerrillas to leave Beirut first. The Israelis have k
maintained they will not deal with the PLO until it
nounces terrorism and amends its charter, which calls
replacing the Jewish state with a secular nation
Palestine.

Torture jeopardizes Salvadoran ai<
Washington — The Salvadoran police tortured art

Americans' support for military aid to the war-tornco

The warning came to light as the Reagan admi

President Ronald Reagan was expected to make

State Department officials said the National Poli
torture of a volunteer for the Green Cross, a medica

known to the U.S. Embassy.
But they argued the Salvadoran government
achieved enough progress to justify certification.
"Police officers and military officers are being p

secretary of state for human rights. "There has been

That is not to suggest that there are not abuses.'

Alternate nuclear freeze endorsed
Washington — Fearing damage to his bargaining posi
tion with the Soviet Union, President Ronald Reagan yes
terday condemned a nuclear weapons freeze resolution
pending in the House and endorsed a substitute meas
ure that supports his policies.
The endorsement set up a showdown vote in the Dem
ocratic-controlled House, probably early next week, be
tween the Republican president and the well-organized
nuclear-freeze movement.
Besides its potential impact on U.S.-Soviet arms reduc
tion talks now under way in Geneva, the battle being
waged in Congress could affect current election cam
paigns.
The freeze issue already has been influenced by a
strong undercurrent of election-year politics. Groups
advocating a nuclear weapons freeze say they are raising
at least $2.25 million to help elect candidates who share
their views. The call for a freeze increasingly is becoming
a key plank in the campaign arsenals of Democratic poli
ticians.
The aim of the Reagan-endorsed resolution is to at
tract members of Congress who both want to support
the president's nuclear arms policies and go on record in
favor of a freeze. But it would be a freeze primarily in
name — freezing nuclear forces only after they had
reached "equal and substantially reduced levels" — and
not right now at current levels, as the freeze movement
wants.
A core issue is the current nuclear balance between
the two superpowers. Reagan says the Soviets enjoy "a
definite margin of superiority" in nuclear arms. The Sovi
ets say there is "essential parity." The freeze movement
generally maintains that the nuclear arsenals are basical
ly equal, but argues it really doesn't matter anyway be
cause each nation now has enough weapons to destroy
the other.
U.S. rejects PLO statement
Washington — The Reagan administration yesterday
rejected a statement signed Sunday by Palestine Liber
ation Organization leader Yasser Arafat, saying it did not
recognize "in a clear and unequivocal way" Israel's right
to exist and therefore does not meet U.S. conditions for
dealing with the PLO.
In identical responses, the White House and State De
partment reaffirmed the policy, in effect since 1975, that
the United States will not recognize nor negotiate with
the PLO until it accepts Israel's right to exist and U.N. Se
curity Council resolutions 242 and 338, which have pro
vided the framework for efforts to resolve the Arab-Is
raeli conflict. >
"We have indicated this must be done in a clear and
unequivocal way," said White House deputy press secre
tary Larry Speakes and State Department spokesman
Dean hscher. "The statement by Arafat does not meet
our conditions."
Although U.S. officials would not say so publicly, they
appeared to be in agreement with Israel's contention
that the Arafat statement was not a significant new de
parture in Mideast diplomacy, but a propaganda ploy
aimed at winning world sympathy and support for the
PLO, whose military forces are under Israeli siege in West
Beirut and under pressure to leave Lebanon.
The U.S. statement implied that the administration re
gards the question of PLO recognition as a side issue that
could divert attention from the efforts of President Rea
gan's special Mideast envoy, Philip Habib, to negotiate
relocation of the PLO from Lebanon to other Arab coun
tries.
Habib, meanwhile, yesterday received a strong vote of
confidence from Reagan following revelations that the
retired foreign service officer has been a paid consultant
to the Bechtel Group Inc., an international engineering
firm that has extensive business interests in the Arab
world.
(Habib is also a senior research fellow at the Hoover
Institution.)
At Reagan's behest, the State Department issued a for

mal statement that called Habib "one of the outstanding
public servants of this country" and said that he has' the
full confidence and support" of Reagan and Secretary of
State George Shultz, who is former president of Bechtel.
Israeli jets hit PLO ammo dump
Beirut — Israeli jets scored a direct hit on a huge
Palestinian ammunition dump yesterday, setting off a
chain reaction of explosions that rocked the Lebanese
capital for more than an hour and sent huge plumes of
smoke over the city.
The timing of the attack on Beirut, which was struck by
Israeli jets for the fifth day in a row, may have been a re
ply to the controversial statement signed Sunday by
Palestine Liberation Organization leader Yasser Arafat.
Arafat said in the statement that he was willing to rec
ognize all United Nations resolutions concerning the
Palestinian question.
Coincidence or not, the Israelis bombed the southern
areas of West Beirut for almost an hour in yet another
show of force designed to keep up the pressure and
force the PLO out of Lebanon.
The Israelis, intent on eradicating both the military and
political presence of the PLO, invaded Lebanon on June
6 and have encircled the Palestinian stronghold of West
Beirut since june 13. Durmg the last seven weeks of war,
diplomatic efforts have so far failed to extricate the PLO
from Beirut and disband the guerrillas to other Arab
states.
Israels army colonel resigns
Jerusalem — A well-known Israeli army colonel has re
signed as commander of a combat brigade in Lebanon,
asserting that "his conscience and his outlook did not
permit him to continue taking part in that operation," Is
raeli military officials said Sunday night.
The resignation ofacombatcommandduringwartime
to protest government policy was thought to be a first in
Israel's conflict-filled, 34-year history. It also was another
sign that doubts about the human and political costs of a
military strike into Beirut are beginning to surface as the
Israeli invasion of Lebanon passed the 50-day mark.
Initially there was almost universal support here for
the announced objective of the military operation,
which was to clear the PLO from a 25-mile corridor in
southern Lebanon along Israel's northern border. Even
when Israeli troops moved far beyond the 25-mile goal
there was little public dissent because of the swiftness
and the success of the advance.
McCloskey supports Arafat letter
Beirut — Members of a U.S. congressional delegation
appeared divided yesterday over a one-sentence docu
ment signed by PLO chief Yasser Arafat that some con
tend meets the conditions for U.S. recognition of the
Palestine Liberation Organization.
"They (the PLO) clearly are ready to recognize Israel's
right to exist," Rep. Paul McCloskey (R-Calif.) told a
news conference yesterday, a day after he obtained the
statement from Arafat.
Such PLO acceptance of Israel is the main U.S. prere
quisite for dealing with the Palestinian organization.
But another congressman in the six-member delega
tion called the Arafat statement "at best a rehash," and it
was dismissed in both Washington and Israel. McCloskey
himself acknowledged it could have been more explicit
and unequivocal.
He said Arafat specified he was endorsing U.N. Secur
ity Council Resolution 242, which implies recognition of
Israel, only in the context of other U.N. resolutions. But
neither Israel nor the United States accepts those other
resolutions, which call for establishment of a Palestinian
state.
In Washington, White House spokesman Larry
Speakes said the Arafat statement did not fulfill U.S con
ditions for dealing with the PLO. A senior State Depart
ment official, who asked not to be identified, noted this
formula of 'all U.N. resolutions" includes many resolu-

tions the Un ited States has voted against.
Further complicating the issue was a statementbyi
PLO's observer at the United Nations in New York,Zd
Terzi, who said Arafat told him in a telephone conver
tion Sunday night that Resolution 242 was not indud
in the document signed in Beirut.
But Terzi said Arafat's endorsement did apply toU
General Assembly Resolution 181, which calls forsei
rate Jewish and Palestinian states.
A spokesman for the Israeli Foreign Ministry,,
Pazner, told reporters Israel wants the besieged P
guerrillas to leave Beirut first. The Israelis have k
maintained they will not deal with the PLO until it
nounces terrorism and amends its charter, which calls
replacing the Jewish state with a secular nation
Palestine.

Washington — The Salvadoran police tortured art

Alternate nuclear freeze endorsed
Washington — Fearing damage to his bargaining posi
tion with the Soviet Union, President Ronald Reagan yes
terday condemned a nuclear weapons freeze resolution
pending in the House and endorsed a substitute meas
ure that supports his policies.
The endorsement set up a showdown vote in the Dem
ocratic-controlled House, probably early next week, be
tween the Republican president and the well-organized
nuclear-freeze movement.
Besides its potential impact on U.S.-Soviet arms reduc
tion talks now under way in Geneva, the battle being
waged in Congress could affect current election cam
paigns.
The freeze issue already has been influenced by a
strong undercurrent of election-year politics. Groups
advocating a nuclear weapons freeze say they are raising
at least $2.25 million to help elect candidates who share
their views. The call for a freeze increasingly is becoming
a key plank in the campaign arsenals of Democratic poli
ticians.
The aim of the Reagan-endorsed resolution is to at
tract members of Congress who both want to support
the president's nuclear arms policies and go on record in
favor of a freeze. But it would be a freeze primarily in
name — freezing nuclear forces only after they had
reached "equal and substantially reduced levels" — and
not right now at current levels, as the freeze movement
wants.
A core issue is the current nuclear balance between
the two superpowers. Reagan says the Soviets enjoy "a
definite margin of superiority" in nuclear arms. The Sovi
ets say there is "essential parity." The freeze movement
generally maintains that the nuclear arsenals are basical
ly equal, but argues it really doesn't matter anyway be
cause each nation now has enough weapons to destroy
the other.
U.S. rejects PLO statement
Washington — The Reagan administration yesterday
rejected a statement signed Sunday by Palestine Liber
ation Organization leader Yasser Arafat, saying it did not
recognize "in a clear and unequivocal way" Israel's right
to exist and therefore does not meet U.S. conditions for
dealing with the PLO.
In identical responses, the White House and State De
partment reaffirmed the policy, in effect since 1975, that
the United States will not recognize nor negotiate with
the PLO until it accepts Israel's right to exist and U.N. Se
curity Council resolutions 242 and 338, which have pro
vided the framework for efforts to resolve the Arab-Is
raeli conflict. >
"We have indicated this must be done in a clear and
unequivocal way," said White House deputy press secre
tary Larry Speakes and State Department spokesman
Dean hscher. "The statement by Arafat does not meet
our conditions."
Although U.S. officials would not say so publicly, they
appeared to be in agreement with Israel's contention
that the Arafat statement was not a significant new de
parture in Mideast diplomacy, but a propaganda ploy
aimed at winning world sympathy and support for the
PLO, whose military forces are under Israeli siege in West
Beirut and under pressure to leave Lebanon.
The U.S. statement implied that the administration re
gards the question of PLO recognition as a side issue that
could divert attention from the efforts of President Rea
gan's special Mideast envoy, Philip Habib, to negotiate
relocation of the PLO from Lebanon to other Arab coun
tries.
Habib, meanwhile, yesterday received a strong vote of
confidence from Reagan following revelations that the
retired foreign service officer has been a paid consultant
to the Bechtel Group Inc., an international engineering
firm that has extensive business interests in the Arab
world.
(Habib is also a senior research fellow at the Hoover
Institution.)
At Reagan's behest, the State Department issued a for

mal statement that called Habib "one of the outstanding
public servants of this country" and said that he has' the
full confidence and support" of Reagan and Secretary of
State George Shultz, who is former president of Bechtel.
Israeli jets hit PLO ammo dump
Beirut — Israeli jets scored a direct hit on a huge
Palestinian ammunition dump yesterday, setting off a
chain reaction of explosions that rocked the Lebanese
capital for more than an hour and sent huge plumes of
smoke over the city.
The timing of the attack on Beirut, which was struck by
Israeli jets for the fifth day in a row, may have been a re
ply to the controversial statement signed Sunday by
Palestine Liberation Organization leader Yasser Arafat.
Arafat said in the statement that he was willing to rec
ognize all United Nations resolutions concerning the
Palestinian question.
Coincidence or not, the Israelis bombed the southern
areas of West Beirut for almost an hour in yet another
show of force designed to keep up the pressure and
force the PLO out of Lebanon.
The Israelis, intent on eradicating both the military and
political presence of the PLO, invaded Lebanon on June
6 and have encircled the Palestinian stronghold of West
Beirut since june 13. Durmg the last seven weeks of war,
diplomatic efforts have so far failed to extricate the PLO
from Beirut and disband the guerrillas to other Arab
states.
Israels army colonel resigns
Jerusalem — A well-known Israeli army colonel has re
signed as commander of a combat brigade in Lebanon,
asserting that "his conscience and his outlook did not
permit him to continue taking part in that operation," Is
raeli military officials said Sunday night.
The resignation ofacombatcommandduringwartime
to protest government policy was thought to be a first in
Israel's conflict-filled, 34-year history. It also was another
sign that doubts about the human and political costs of a
military strike into Beirut are beginning to surface as the
Israeli invasion of Lebanon passed the 50-day mark.
Initially there was almost universal support here for
the announced objective of the military operation,
which was to clear the PLO from a 25-mile corridor in
southern Lebanon along Israel's northern border. Even
when Israeli troops moved far beyond the 25-mile goal
there was little public dissent because of the swiftness
and the success of the advance.
McCloskey supports Arafat letter
Beirut — Members of a U.S. congressional delegation
appeared divided yesterday over a one-sentence docu
ment signed by PLO chief Yasser Arafat that some con
tend meets the conditions for U.S. recognition of the
Palestine Liberation Organization.
"They (the PLO) clearly are ready to recognize Israel's
right to exist," Rep. Paul McCloskey (R-Calif.) told a
news conference yesterday, a day after he obtained the
statement from Arafat.
Such PLO acceptance of Israel is the main U.S. prere
quisite for dealing with the Palestinian organization.
But another congressman in the six-member delega
tion called the Arafat statement "at best a rehash," and it
was dismissed in both Washington and Israel. McCloskey
himself acknowledged it could have been more explicit
and unequivocal.
He said Arafat specified he was endorsing U.N. Secur
ity Council Resolution 242, which implies recognition of
Israel, only in the context of other U.N. resolutions. But
neither Israel nor the United States accepts those other
resolutions, which call for establishment of a Palestinian
state.
In Washington, White House spokesman Larry
Speakes said the Arafat statement did not fulfill U.S con
ditions for dealing with the PLO. A senior State Depart
ment official, who asked not to be identified, noted this
formula of 'all U.N. resolutions" includes many resolu-

tions the Un ited States has voted against.
Further complicating the issue was a statementbyi
PLO's observer at the United Nations in New York,Zd
Terzi, who said Arafat told him in a telephone conver
tion Sunday night that Resolution 242 was not indud
in the document signed in Beirut.
But Terzi said Arafat's endorsement did apply toU
General Assembly Resolution 181, which calls forsei
rate Jewish and Palestinian states.
A spokesman for the Israeli Foreign Ministry,,
Pazner, told reporters Israel wants the besieged P
guerrillas to leave Beirut first. The Israelis have k
maintained they will not deal with the PLO until it
nounces terrorism and amends its charter, which calls
replacing the Jewish state with a secular nation
Palestine.

Torture jeopardizes Salvadoran ai<
Washington — The Salvadoran police tortured art
agency volunteer in May, prompting the U.S. I
bassador to warn that such actions could jeopari
Americans' support for military aid to the war-tornco
try, State Department officials said yesterday.
The warning came to light as the Reagan admi
tration prepared to certify that the Salvadoran govi
ment was making progress in human rights, a (
gressional requirement for continuation of this y<
$81 million in U.S. military assistance.
President Ronald Reagan was expected to make
finding tomorrow.
State Department officials said the National Poli
torture of a volunteer for the Green Cross, a medica
lief agency, was among recent human rights viola#
known to the U.S. Embassy.
But they argued the Salvadoran government
achieved enough progress to justify certification.
"Police officers and military officers are being p
ished for these incidents," said Elliott Abrams, assis
secretary of state for human rights. "There has been
provement in the performance of the National P"
That is not to suggest that there are not abuses.'
In interviews and internal State Department ®
ments, U.S. officials also cited problems in convin
the Salvadoran military to take prisoners in battle an*
stop killing civilians suspected of helping le ,,is
surgents.
State Department officials who asked not to be idei
fied said U.S. Ambassador Deane Hinton wa
Salvadoran President Alvaro Magana in San Salva
month that the practice of torture could damag
public support for the Salvadoran government.
