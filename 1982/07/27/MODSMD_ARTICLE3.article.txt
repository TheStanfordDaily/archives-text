# Army official threatens to cut funds to Universities

In a retaliatory move against
aw schools that bar Army re
:ruiters from campus because of
he Army's refusal to admit
lomosexuals, the judge ad
ocate general of the Army has
hreatened to recommend
withholding millions of dollars
n Defense Department con
racts from those universities
whose law schools bar re
:ruiters.
Stanford will not be affected
ince the Law School, and the
Jniversity in general, do not bar
recruiters. Gloria Pyszka,
placement director at the Law
ichool, said, "Our discimination
>olicy does not include sexual
reference." The University sets
he Law School's discrimination
>olicy, she said.
According to Pyszka, only one
Stanford Law graduate in the
Jast two years has become an
irmy lawyer.
Law School Dean J. Keith
said he was unsure about
he power of Major General
Hugh Clausen's recommenda
tion. He said the army possessed
some residual power" due to
defense department contract
ng. University Counsel could
lot be reached for comment.
The University Career Plan
ning and Placement Center
(CPPC) does enforce a non
discrimination policy, according
to Melinda Kaewert, supervisor
Â°112 recruitment activities. Cur
rently, the policy does not apply
to discrimination based on sex
ual preference. The possibility of
changing the policy to include
sexual preference discrimina
tion has been discussed but nev
er acted upon, she said.
Kaewert said the policy was set
in 1971 under former University
President Richard Lyman. The
policy, which she said "reflects
the law," has undergone some
minor revisions as the laws were
amended.
Our stated policy does not
"ay sexual preference, it says
se */' said Kaewert. "We've nev
er had a test case," she added,
since the Army does not current
'y recruit through the CPPC.

"Their policy has never been
stated to me."
The CPPC makes its facilities
and services available for in
terviewers who do not dis
criminate based on race, creed,
sex, or age. Employers must
comply with "legitimate em
ployment specifications," she
said.
Harvard, Yale, Columbia, New
York University, UCLA and
Wayne State University are the
schools which received letters in
May from Clausen warning that
he would recommend that no
further contracts be awarded to
them because their law schools
prohibit Army recruiting on
campus.
These universities received
more than $41 million in re
search and other contracts from
the Defense Department in the
last fiscal year.
According to Ellen Williams,
manager of data and informa
tional systems at the Sponsored
Projects office here, Defense
Department research awards to
Stanford as of the end of last fis
cal year were $27.3 million.
The University of California
system received $30 million. Al
though UCLA has the non
discrimination rule, other law
schools in the University of Cali
fornia system such as Boalt Hall
at UC-Berkeley and Hastings in
San Francisco allow the Army to
recruit students on campus. It is
unclear whether any action
taken against UCLA would affect
other universities in the UC sys
tem.
Susan Kishi, placement assis
tant at Boalt, said, "We have a
policy. We don't have a specific
policy for sexual orientation."
The UC-Berkeley discrimination
policy, similar to the policy here,
refers only to race, religion, sex,
or national origin. "It doesn't
stipulate sexual orientation,"
said Kishi.
Clausen's letter
Clausen wrote that homosex
uality is a crime under military
law. Soldiers "must often sleep,
eat and perform personal
hygiene under conditions, af
fording minimal privacy," he

said. "The presence of homosex
uals in such an environment
tends to impair unit morale and
cohesion as well as infringing on
the right of privacy of those ser
vice members who have a more
traditional sexual preference."
The National Law Journal,
which published a report on gay
lawyers yesterday, obtained
Clausen's letter. (The journal
edition will be available at the
Law School library next week.)
Army spokesperson Margaret
Tackley said the Army will not
hire homosexual lawyers nor re
cruit homosexual soldiers be
cause "homosexuals are just not
suitable for military service." But
Army lawyers live in private
quarters rather than regular bar

racks.
According to an Army recruit
ing sergeant in Mountain View
who refused to disclose his
name, homosexuality is a per
manent disqualification from
the Army. The officer, who re
cruits here without aid of the
CPPC, said other permanent dis
qualifications inciude question
able moral character and sexual
perversion.
When asked how the army
identifies a prospective appli
cant as a homosexual, the officer
replied, "He's got to tell us about
it."
He stressed that the University
does not restrict the Army. "We
have pretty much open territo
ry," he said. "Stanford has never
restricted us." The officer was

unaware of CPPC services, but
has since made an appointment
with Kaewert. "As far as getting
assistance from Stanford, I
don't," he said.
According to the San Jose
Mercury News, none of the six
law schools named has changed
its policies on discrimination in
response to Clausen's letter, but
officials at several schools said
their faculties were reviewing
the letter to determine whether
they should make an exception
for the Army.
NYU adopted its policy against
employers who discriminate
against homosexuals "on a mor
al principle," according to Place
ment Director Michael Mag
ness.
