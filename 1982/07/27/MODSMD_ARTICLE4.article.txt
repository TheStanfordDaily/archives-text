### Jane Bailie 
University President Donald Kennedy been
named as one of the 18 members of the board of
the Institute for World Environment Resources.
The institute, funded by a $15 million grant from
the John D. Mac Arthur foundation, was founded,
according to a recent report, because "neither
United Nations organizations, the U.S. govern
ment, nor state governments are providing the
policy studies that are needed in global resources
and the environment area ... No private institu
tion is now providing the interdisciplinary, scien
tifically informed, policy-oriented studies that are
needed to address world resource and environ
ment issues."
"It's like any other board position,' explained
Kennedy. "There are policy directors and those
who review programs."
Kennedy described the Institute as a first-rate
program formed by some very good people."
Through his involvement with the institute, Ken
nedy says that he hopes to "include people, espe
cially biologists, from around here (the Univer
sity)." i
The organizational core of the institute revolves
around scientific research, both life and physical,
on a national as well as international level.
"The Institute will tap underused intellectual re
sources," explains the report, "broaden the range
of participants in public policy debates, avoid du
plication of effort, and in the process help give
coherence to a new community of scholars con

cerned with global resource and environmental is
sues."
Due to the relatively large size of the institute, it
will be able "to undertake projects and programs
of large scope and potential impact," states the re
port. "The size of the Institute will also permit it to
develop the reputation and stature in the United
States and abroad that would enhance its effective
ness."
The organization will work through a "hub and
spokes" structure, where the administrative and
scientific base will work with associated academic
and research centers throughout the world. The
relationship between these two entities will, ac
cording to the report, be "open to development
and evolution in an organic way."
One of the institute's responsibilities will be to
serve as a communication channel between what
the report describes as "scholarship and public
policy, bringing the best scientific and other
knowledge and analysis to the attention of de
cision-makers and the public generally, while at
the same time affording scholars better access to
the decision process.
"The Institute will also serve as a forum where
contending forces and ideas can be explored
through participation in seminars, conferences
and informal discussions," states the report.
The institute hopes to establish connections
with various segments of American society as well
as with those who share similar interests abroad.
