# Labor-management battles: a continuing threat
## Meatcutters' strike violent 
### Washington Post 
Dakota City, Neb. — Until sev
>n weeks ago some of the top
irloins for sale in supermarkets
ikely were boned by Bill
'ritchard, a strapping blond
neatcutter here.
But since June 7, he and 2400
>ther members of meatcutters
.ocal 222 have been on strike
lere against lowa Beef Process
es Inc., the world's largest beef
laughterhouse and packer.
They are not fighting for
ligher pay. They are seeking a
wo-year wage freeze that looks
jood only in contrast to the

four-year freeze lowa Beef is in
sisting on.
The company has enraged the
union by hiring replacements —
people like David Inks of nearby
Sioux Falls, lowa, who was laid
off from his grain-elevator job
six months ago — to do union
members' work.
Inks, lined up last week for the
union members' old jobs, said
he is so desperate for work that
he is willing to risk the threat of
violence like that which broke
out last Tuesday and Wednes
day, when the plant reopened.
Inks and Pritchard are players

in an epic labor-management
battle, set in the glare of the hot
summer on the plains. The script
is being written by hard times
and the new realities of technol
ogy in the slaughterhouse.
At the center of the drama is
lowa Beef, a corporate bull that
came charging into the meat
packing industry in 1961 with
revolutionary impact.
Its colorful history is laced
with convictions for bribery, al
legations of controversial busi
ness tactics as well as labor vio
lence. It is now being in
vestigated for alleged antitrust

violations.
Squeezed for profits in a cut
throat industry, the company
must lower labor costs to stay
competitive or eventually close
some plants as many of their
former competitors have been
forced to do, they said.
On sales of $5 billion to $6
billion a year, lowa Beef has only
slightly more than a 1 percent
profit margin, according to com
pany official Charles Harness.
lowa Beef slaughters 5.7 mil
lion head of cattle a year, more
than 16 percent of all beef cattle
killed in the United States an

nually.
Pritchard, with a wife and two
children, is struggling to get by
on his $65-a-week strike pay.
"You can't just go out and find
other work," he said. "A lot of us
have been looking since the
strike started."
lowa Beef is offering Inks $6.95
an hour, $1 less than he made at
his grain elevator job and $2 less
than Pritchard and the other
strikers were making in the same
jobs.
Once the fear of further vio
lence has abated, lowa Beef of
ficials expect to be able to bring
the plant back up to full capacity
within a few weeks "with or
without the union," Harness
said. Some 50 members of the
union are among those back at
work, he said.
Last week two dozen strikers
were arrested, 29 people includ
ing a television newsman were
injured and 70 vehicles were
damaged when strikers pelted
the replacement workers with
bricks and stones as they tried to
cross the picket lines.
