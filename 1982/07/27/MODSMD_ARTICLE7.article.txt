# Air controller preparations
## 
### Washington Post 
Washington — Although the government
sn't expecting a repeat of last year's labor
iroblems — when 11,000 air-traffic con
rollers walked off the job — agencies have
leen told to update their strike-contingency
>lans just in case.
Many of the government's 2.8 million
vorkers are unhappy with job cuts and caps
>n their pay and pension increases. But be
muse of economic conditions (and what
lappened to the controllers) there is little
alk from government union leaders about
vhat the government calls "job actions" —
strikes or sickouts.
Nevertheless, the administration has
directed top officials to review strike
•cenarios, to make sure they know what to
Jo if people talk strikes, or to keep function
ng should picket lines go up.
The Office of Personnel Management has
quietly circulated Management Guidance
Bulletin No. 14, "Strike Contingency Plans,"
to agency heads. It reviews SCPs set up dur
ing the Ford and Carter administrations and
notes that the plans of many agencies are in
adequate to some degree or other.
In some cases, the bulletin says, agencies
are prepared to act only after they have been
hit by a strike.

Some of the advice contained in the 17-
page bulletin:
•Prepare SCPs for local and national situ
ations to reduce "the number of decisions
that are made under the conditions of haste
and stress involved in an actual or threat
ened strike. ... It should establish adminis
trative policies, anticipate shifts in per
sonnel, and the continuance of or change in
services needed for proper response to job
actions."
•Determine "how many employees are
needed to provide essential services, and
how to deploy nonstriking employees."
•Set procedures for "prompt and accurate
communication with unions and/or em
ployees" to begin "as soon as the job action
appears imminent."
•Ensure that agencies are prepared to deal
with the press and public in strike or pre
strike situations. "Communication with the
public in some cases will be as important as
communication with employees' unions"
the OPM document says.
•Designate the role of key officials in a
strike action, and "alternative labor pools"
who could perform the work of striking em
ployees.
•Establish "security for agency personnel

and property" so that employees who want
to report for work can do so safely. "Man
agement may find it useful to organize van
pools to transport employees across picket
lines," the bulletin says, and should make
sure that local law-enforcement officials and
the FBI are aware of the strike situation.
•Be aware of federal no-strike laws. Em
ployees who strike can be fired, fined $1000
and/or sentenced to a year and a day in jail.
The bulletin notes that many previous job ac
tions have been "short-lived (usually a mat
ter of hours)" and often can be handled ad
ministratively.
The bulletin also contains five "sample"
letters agencies might want to have ready.
One is a "Sample Deterrent Letter to Em
ployees," reminding that strikes are illegal,
and that they took an oath not to strike.
An OPM official said the bulletin is "not
intended to throw down the gauntlet or try
to intimidate people." He said it is "just com
mon sense to be prepared for job actions.
We don't anticipate any," he said, "but then
again very few people thought PATCO (the
Professional Air Traffic Controllers Or
ganization) would strike up until the day
they did."
