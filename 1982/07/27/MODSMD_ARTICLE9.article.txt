## PLO-exaggerated figures hide true story 
### 
I received a letter from my Is
raeli friend Avi the other day. Avi
is situated at the far left of the Is
raeli political spectrum; he is a
supporter of the Peace Now
movement, votes for the leftist
Shelli party in national elections,
and supports the establishment
of a Palestinian Arab state on the
West Bank. He also supported,
with a heavy heart, the Israeli in
vasion of Lebanon. "Something
had to be done," he wrote.
Something had to be done.
And despite 'he loss of many
fathers and sons, 80 percent of
Israeli citizens agree with him.
From SOOO miles away on the
Stanford campus, the reality of
PLO terrorism seems very dim.
To the citizens and government
of Israel, however, the buildup
of hostile forces across the
border, shelling across that
border, and incursions of ter
rorists were all too real. The PLO,
it is true, had not shelled Israeli
cities for months, but other inci
dents of terrorism, both in Israel
and against Israeli and Jewish
targets abroad, had continued
unabated. Under those circum
stances, it is the responsibility of
the Israeli government to pro
vide for the defense of its
citizens.
But PLO apologists argue that
Israel's invasion occurred at the
expense of Arab civilian casual
ties, and brand the war as unjust
on those grounds. Unfortunate
ly, modern warfare sometimes
causes deaths of civilians; a war
is not unjust simply because civil
ians die. What we can and
should demand is that comba
tants try their utmost to avoid ci
vilian casualties. The Israelis
have done this, while the PLO
has not.
The Israelis dropped leafleats
over metropolitan areas several
hours before their army bom
barded or entered the areas;
these leaflets warned inhabitants
to leave temporarily because of
the imminent fighting.
Loudspeakers and local leaders
were used to convey the same
message, and many citizens did
evacuate. Once the army en
tered, only areas that offered re
sistance were attacked; soldiers
were instructed never to fire un
less fired upon ("Patterns of
physical destruction also tend to
bear out the Israeli verson of
events," AP, July 7). The army
gave up the element of surprise
and incurred higher casualties in
order to save the lives of Arab ci
vilians (286 Israeli soldiers have

died so far).
Despite these precautions,
however, many civilians did die.
The official Israeli count, com
piled in cooperation with Leba
nese mayors, government doc
tors and other public figures,
shows 56 Lebanese citizens and
Palestinians were killed in Tyre,
265 in Sidon and 10 in Nabatiya
(International Jerusalem Post,
July 11). Roughly 20,000 people
have been made homeless.
PLO propagandists, un
satisfied with these numbers,
have multiplied both the
homeless and the killed by a fac
tor of 30. The Palestinian Red
Crescent took a leading role in
spreading the wildly inflated fig
ures; this organization is, coin
cidentally, headed by the
brother of Yasser Arafat, PLO
chairman (New York Times, July
13). As David Shipler of the
Times wrote on July 15th, "It is
cle£r to anyone who has traveled
in southern Lebanon ... that the
original figures of 10,000 dead
and 600,000 homeless ... were
extreme exaggerations." The
Wall Street Journal editorialized
(July 21) that "the Israeli assault
was not wanton but carefully cal
culated to minimize civilian cas
ualties."
Even after the original num
bers were revised down by the
people who first made them,
newspapers (including theDaily)
continued using the outlandish
early estimates. There are not
even 600,000 people living in the
entire area of southern Lebanon
under Israeli control.
So the Israelis incurred heavy
personal losses while keeping ci
vilian deaths low. But why did ci
vilians die at all? To understand
this, we must examine the ac
tions of the PLO, who consistent
ly used civilians to shield them
selves. Throughout southern
Lebanon, the PLO located its mil
itary installations in Palestinian
camps, and shelled Israel from
those bases. They counted on Is
raeli (and world) sensitivities to
civilian casualities to protect
themselves.
Their actions In southern Leb
anon are now being repeated in
Beirut. The San Francisco
Chronicle reported on July 13th
that "Palestinian guerrillas ...
have moved into residential
neighborhoods in West Beirut,
seeking shelter from Israeli artil
lery and planes"; thus, instead of
caring about civilian casualties,
they prefer to use civilians as
hostages in a cowardly manner.

Then they point their own
bloody fingers at the Israelis
when the latter refuse to be at
tacked with impunity.
If the PLO has been less than
sensitive about preventing
Palestinian and Lebanese civilian
casualties, it has not cared at all
about Israeli civilian deaths.
There is a touch of the sur
realistic in the PLO and its
apologists condemning civilian
casualties, after 18 years of
purposefully attacking civilian
targets in Israel.
The solution to this conflict re
quires that Palestinian Arabs rec
ognize Israel's right to exist. The
PLO has refused to do this even
though it would gain their much
desired goal of American recog
nition. Why do they refuse? Be
cause, simply, they really do
want to destroy the Jewish state;
they believe the Jews have no
right to a country of their own
(Palestine National Covenant,
Article 20).
Perhaps someday they will
adopt a new approach; after all,
it is hypocritical of them to deny
the Jewish peple a right to a na
tional home, while claiming to
fight for their own. In the mean
time, Israel continues to fight
those who would kill it, and
Americans should support that
just fight.
Of course, a basic and just res
olution of the conflict must be
found. Fortunately, the outline
of such a solution aleady exists.
Palestine, as defined by the Brit
ish mandate, included all of
present-day Israel and Jordan:
the Jordanian portion of
Palestine accounts for 76.9 per
cent of the total area, the majori
ty of Jordan's inhabitants are
Palestinians, and the PLO still
claims all of Palestine (PNC Arti
cle 21), including Jordan. The
country's present regime is a
throwback to the British, who in
stalled King Hussein's Bedouin
(i.e. non-Palestinian) grand
father as a ruler over eastern
Palestine so that they would
have a compliant ally in the re
gion.
The anachronism of Jordan
should be ended. Eastern
Palestine (i.e. Jordan) should be
set up as a Democratic Palesti
nian state. There is plenty of
room to absorb millions of
Palestinian refugees; they will
finally have the chance to return
home to Palestine.
The future of the West Bank
and Gaza would then be nego

tiated over; the Israeli govern
ment has stated its willingness to
hold such negotiations. The is
sue of these terrorities would
thus be reduced to its proper
place as a border conflict.
There is a major advantage to
this plan of setting up a Palesti
nian state in eastern Palestine —
it is one of the few things that
both Menachem Begin and
Vasser Arafat agree on (though
Arafat wants western Palestine as
well). It presupposes, of course,
that the Palestinian Arabs would
accept the right of the Jewish
people to their own homeland,
without which the conflict
would simply continue in a new
form.
The plan, however, has very
little chance of adoption, since
both Saudi Arabia and the Unit
ed States prefer to have a "mod
erate" like Hussein in power
rather than provide justice for
the Palestinian Arabs.
Despite these cynical objec
tions, it is high time we looked
towards eastern Palestine for a
solution to Israel's and the Ar
abs' problems.

I received a letter from my Is
raeli friend Avi the other day. Avi
is situated at the far left of the Is
raeli political spectrum; he is a
supporter of the Peace Now
movement, votes for the leftist
Shelli party in national elections,
and supports the establishment
of a Palestinian Arab state on the
West Bank. He also supported,
with a heavy heart, the Israeli in
vasion of Lebanon. "Something
had to be done," he wrote.
Something had to be done.
And despite 'he loss of many
fathers and sons, 80 percent of
Israeli citizens agree with him.
From SOOO miles away on the
Stanford campus, the reality of
PLO terrorism seems very dim.
To the citizens and government
of Israel, however, the buildup
of hostile forces across the
border, shelling across that
border, and incursions of ter
rorists were all too real. The PLO,
it is true, had not shelled Israeli
cities for months, but other inci
dents of terrorism, both in Israel
and against Israeli and Jewish
targets abroad, had continued
unabated. Under those circum
stances, it is the responsibility of
the Israeli government to pro
vide for the defense of its
citizens.
But PLO apologists argue that
Israel's invasion occurred at the
expense of Arab civilian casual
ties, and brand the war as unjust
on those grounds. Unfortunate
ly, modern warfare sometimes
causes deaths of civilians; a war
is not unjust simply because civil
ians die. What we can and
should demand is that comba
tants try their utmost to avoid ci
vilian casualties. The Israelis
have done this, while the PLO
has not.
The Israelis dropped leafleats
over metropolitan areas several
hours before their army bom
barded or entered the areas;
these leaflets warned inhabitants
to leave temporarily because of
the imminent fighting.
Loudspeakers and local leaders
were used to convey the same
message, and many citizens did
evacuate. Once the army en
tered, only areas that offered re
sistance were attacked; soldiers
were instructed never to fire un
less fired upon ("Patterns of
physical destruction also tend to
bear out the Israeli verson of
events," AP, July 7). The army
gave up the element of surprise
and incurred higher casualties in
order to save the lives of Arab ci
vilians (286 Israeli soldiers have

died so far).
Despite these precautions,
however, many civilians did die.
The official Israeli count, com
piled in cooperation with Leba
nese mayors, government doc
tors and other public figures,
shows 56 Lebanese citizens and
Palestinians were killed in Tyre,
265 in Sidon and 10 in Nabatiya
(International Jerusalem Post,
July 11). Roughly 20,000 people
have been made homeless.
PLO propagandists, un
satisfied with these numbers,
have multiplied both the
homeless and the killed by a fac
tor of 30. The Palestinian Red
Crescent took a leading role in
spreading the wildly inflated fig
ures; this organization is, coin
cidentally, headed by the
brother of Yasser Arafat, PLO
chairman (New York Times, July
13). As David Shipler of the
Times wrote on July 15th, "It is
cle£r to anyone who has traveled
in southern Lebanon ... that the
original figures of 10,000 dead
and 600,000 homeless ... were
extreme exaggerations." The
Wall Street Journal editorialized
(July 21) that "the Israeli assault
was not wanton but carefully cal
culated to minimize civilian cas
ualties."
Even after the original num
bers were revised down by the
people who first made them,
newspapers (including theDaily)
continued using the outlandish
early estimates. There are not
even 600,000 people living in the
entire area of southern Lebanon
under Israeli control.
So the Israelis incurred heavy
personal losses while keeping ci
vilian deaths low. But why did ci
vilians die at all? To understand
this, we must examine the ac
tions of the PLO, who consistent
ly used civilians to shield them
selves. Throughout southern
Lebanon, the PLO located its mil
itary installations in Palestinian
camps, and shelled Israel from
those bases. They counted on Is
raeli (and world) sensitivities to
civilian casualities to protect
themselves.
Their actions In southern Leb
anon are now being repeated in
Beirut. The San Francisco
Chronicle reported on July 13th
that "Palestinian guerrillas ...
have moved into residential
neighborhoods in West Beirut,
seeking shelter from Israeli artil
lery and planes"; thus, instead of
caring about civilian casualties,
they prefer to use civilians as
hostages in a cowardly manner.

Then they point their own
bloody fingers at the Israelis
when the latter refuse to be at
tacked with impunity.
If the PLO has been less than
sensitive about preventing
Palestinian and Lebanese civilian
casualties, it has not cared at all
about Israeli civilian deaths.
There is a touch of the sur
realistic in the PLO and its
apologists condemning civilian
casualties, after 18 years of
purposefully attacking civilian
targets in Israel.
The solution to this conflict re
quires that Palestinian Arabs rec
ognize Israel's right to exist. The
PLO has refused to do this even
though it would gain their much
desired goal of American recog
nition. Why do they refuse? Be
cause, simply, they really do
want to destroy the Jewish state;
they believe the Jews have no
right to a country of their own
(Palestine National Covenant,
Article 20).
Perhaps someday they will
adopt a new approach; after all,
it is hypocritical of them to deny
the Jewish peple a right to a na
tional home, while claiming to
fight for their own. In the mean
time, Israel continues to fight
those who would kill it, and
Americans should support that
just fight.
Of course, a basic and just res
olution of the conflict must be
found. Fortunately, the outline
of such a solution aleady exists.
Palestine, as defined by the Brit
ish mandate, included all of
present-day Israel and Jordan:
the Jordanian portion of
Palestine accounts for 76.9 per
cent of the total area, the majori
ty of Jordan's inhabitants are
Palestinians, and the PLO still
claims all of Palestine (PNC Arti
cle 21), including Jordan. The
country's present regime is a
throwback to the British, who in
stalled King Hussein's Bedouin
(i.e. non-Palestinian) grand
father as a ruler over eastern
Palestine so that they would
have a compliant ally in the re
gion.
The anachronism of Jordan
should be ended. Eastern
Palestine (i.e. Jordan) should be
set up as a Democratic Palesti
nian state. There is plenty of
room to absorb millions of
Palestinian refugees; they will
finally have the chance to return
home to Palestine.
The future of the West Bank
and Gaza would then be nego

tiated over; the Israeli govern
ment has stated its willingness to
hold such negotiations. The is
sue of these terrorities would
thus be reduced to its proper
place as a border conflict.
There is a major advantage to
this plan of setting up a Palesti
nian state in eastern Palestine —
it is one of the few things that
both Menachem Begin and
Vasser Arafat agree on (though
