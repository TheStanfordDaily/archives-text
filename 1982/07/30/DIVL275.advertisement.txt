Whatsa matter, Bunkie? You say
you'd like to take a trip but your old
suitcase just won't hold enough stuff
anymore? ... You say it's gonna split
open and spew your underwear all
over the baggage claim area? . . .
You say Customs might confiscate
your suitcase as a public eyesore? . . .
And you've been looking at all the
fancy luggage ads but you just don't
have that kind of money?
Well, cheer up, Bunkie, because Dealin' Down has a
fabulous array of soft luggage, duffles, carry-ons and convert
tto-luggage backpacks. More than 50
different pieces to choose from,
bright fabric colors (you'd rather have
■L that than those expensive naugahydes
anyway, wouldn't ya?) And you can
# find models to suit your taste in every
1 'economical price bracket. Sounds like
fjp ||l the start of a great new trip, doesn't it,
when you think
of travel, think of
