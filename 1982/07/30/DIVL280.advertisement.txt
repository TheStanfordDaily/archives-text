An Unusual Summer Experience
Few Share and None Forget
There is a certain magic to the
sky that has fascinated people
for centuries. One flight is all it
will take to convince you there
is nothing quite like it.
With the Stanford Flying Club
Solo-Course you can become
part of this adventure at a very
affordable price.
Most pilots obtain a Solo
License in about 14 hours of
flight time. Many members
have completed a Solo
License for less than $432 in
just a few weeks.
More advanced training is also
available. < CtanfAv/1
The Club fleet includes 10
modem airplanes (Cessna
-150/152's, Aerobatic C-152,
C-172's, C-172RG, C-182,
and Turbo-210 aircraft).
Stanford Flying Club members
can fly planes for less than 22
cents per mile! That's less than
the real cost of a car, including
fuel, maintenance and
insurance.
Could you afford not to learn
to drive? Come fly with us. To
schedule a lesson, or just to get
free information, call today
941-8818 (1:00-5:30 pm).
