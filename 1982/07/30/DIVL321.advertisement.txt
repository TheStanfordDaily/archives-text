ESTRELLITA
RESTAURANT
"ESTRELLITA features a classic Mexican menu which
includes everything from exquisite tacos to exotic dishes
like chalupas. . . . This white-walled interior, candlelit
tables and handmade Mexican decor creates the
unpretentious ambience found south of the border. We
highly recommend ESTRELLITA."
-The Stanford Daily
This is a very pleasant family run restaurant that serves a
wide range of dishes, including a wide range of burritos
that couldn't possibly be served without plates.
ESTRELLITA's burritos are not only excellent, but with
the help of a take home container they could last for
days."
