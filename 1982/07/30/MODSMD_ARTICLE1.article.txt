# Congress passes amendment
## Legislation links student aid to registration 
### Jane West 
Late Wednesday the House of Repre
sentatives approved by the overwhelm
ing margin of 303-95 an amendment to
the Defense Authorization Bill that will
deny financial aid to students not regis
tered with the Selective Service. The Sen
ate passed a similar version of the amend
ment in May.
The amendment, introduced in the
House by Rep. Gerald Solomon (R-N.Y.),
is one component of the $177.1 billion
1983 Defense Authorization Bill that is in
the final stages of approval.
According to the Congressional Rec
ord summary of the legislation, "In order
to receive any educational grant, loan or
work assistance under title IV of the
Higher Education Act, a person who is re
quired to register for the draft must file a
statement of compliance with that re
quirement with the Institute of Higher

Education."
Due to difficulties in tracking down
non-registrants and to inevitable high
cost federal prosecutions, the House and
Senate both passed this controversial
amendment.
"The University does not support the
amendment, but there cannot be much
done at this point," said Vice President for
Public Affairs Robert Rosenzweig. "It is a
bad policy that combines conscription
and education... A student does not de
cide not to register for financial reasons,
and I doubt whether the prospective de
nial of benefits will be powerful enough
to deter someone from making that de
cision. This is senseless and mischievous
legislation."
"This is very serious," said Director of
Financial Aids Robert Huff. But Huff has
reserved further comment until Univer
sity legal counsel and other adminis

trators have an opportunity to examine
the bill.
UC-Berkeley Acting Director of Finan
cial Affairs Francis Mondragon said he is
extremely displeased and opposed to the
new rule. "I see a lot of problems with stu
dents having to incriminate themselves to
receive financial aid."
How the amendment will be presented
on financial aid forms is still unknown.
But the translation process will be "a big
mess," predicted Rosenzweig.
"The forms don't exist yet. Then, once
created, they will have to go to the educa
tional institutions. And, who will be re
sponsible for checking accuracy (veri
fication of registration)?" he said.
Students will probably have to indicate
on the forms if they have registered and
the forms will then be sent to the Selec
tive Service System (SSS) for verification.
If it cannot be verified, or if the student

responds "no," then he will be open to
prosecution, though there may be a grace
period in which he could register.
Mark Hage of the Central Committee
for Conscientious Objectors explained,
"The amendment will place a terrible
burden, not only on registrants, but on
every institution of higher education. It
will produce a terrible and unwarranted
bureaucracy," he said.
Hage suggested that one possible
ramification of the legislation would be
the re-introduction of draft cards (as was
done in the 19605) to expedite the identi
fication of registrants.
The SSS presently sends a letter to all
registrants acknowledging the receipt of
a registration card and asking to be
notified of any change in the registrant's
address. In an attempt to identify Ameri
can men who have failed to reg
ister when 18, the director of the
SSS told Congress Wednesday
that non-registrants will lose
"the advantage of anonymity" in
August when the Selective Ser
vice starts comparing its files
with Social Security lists.
By linking registration and fi
nancial aid, the Congress is
creating its own version of extor
tion, added Hage. "The purpose
of the bill is coercion."
Matt Nicodemus, a member of
Stanford Against Conscription
said that many non-registrants in
college will not let this legisla
tion affect their decisions to re

fuse to register and will find al
ternate means to obtain an
education.
"In any case, in passing this
legislation the government may
be denying education to some of
this country's most conscien
tious and principled youths
these are exactly the people our
society needs to be educated.
"This bill is very classist. It
hurts most those who cannot af
ford to pay for their own educa
tion."
Rep. Tom Lantos (D-Calif.),
who voted against the amend
ment, said the provision is highly
discriminating. His press secre

tary, Jeffrey Smith, explained,
"Lower and middle class males
are affected while the wealthy
can evade the penalties .. .
Furthermore, it is not the role of
the universities or the banks to
enforce the law. This is an ill
conceived idea."
Although expected to take
force Oct. 1, the new rule will
most affect federal student loans
Guaranteed Student Loans
(GSL), National Direct Student
Loans (NDSL), Supplemental
Education Opportunity Grants
(SEOG), Pell Grants, work-study,
and a portion of Cal Grants
that will be processed for the ac
ademic year 1983-84.
According to Rosenzweig, the

processing of financial aid forms
for autumn is near completion.
Nicodemus said legislation
will not affect student aid for the
upcoming year. "Non
registrants, therefore, will not
have to worry that they will not
get financial aid and will have
more time to think about their
decision."
This amendment is part of the
largest spending authorization
bill this year, which also includes
a civil defense plan passed yes
terday to evacuate Americans to
rural areas in the event of nucle
ar attack, a $4 billion plan to pro
duce 100 B-1 bombers, and $3.8
billion to develop the MX missile
system.
