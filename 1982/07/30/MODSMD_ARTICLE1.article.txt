# Congress passes amendment
## Legislation links student aid to registration 
### Jane West 
Late Wednesday the House of Repre
sentatives approved by the overwhelm
ing margin of 303-95 an amendment to
the Defense Authorization Bill that will
deny financial aid to students not regis
tered with the Selective Service. The Sen
ate passed a similar version of the amend
ment in May.
The amendment, introduced in the
House by Rep. Gerald Solomon (R-N.Y.),
is one component of the $177.1 billion
1983 Defense Authorization Bill that is in
the final stages of approval.
According to the Congressional Rec
ord summary of the legislation, "In order
to receive any educational grant, loan or
work assistance under title IV of the
Higher Education Act, a person who is re
quired to register for the draft must file a
statement of compliance with that re
quirement with the Institute of Higher

Education."
Due to difficulties in tracking down
non-registrants and to inevitable high
cost federal prosecutions, the House and
Senate both passed this controversial
amendment.
"The University does not support the
amendment, but there cannot be much
done at this point," said Vice President for
Public Affairs Robert Rosenzweig. "It is a
bad policy that combines conscription
and education... A student does not de
cide not to register for financial reasons,
and I doubt whether the prospective de
nial of benefits will be powerful enough
to deter someone from making that de
cision. This is senseless and mischievous
legislation."
"This is very serious," said Director of
Financial Aids Robert Huff. But Huff has
reserved further comment until Univer
sity legal counsel and other adminis

trators have an opportunity to examine
the bill.
UC-Berkeley Acting Director of Finan
cial Affairs Francis Mondragon said he is
extremely displeased and opposed to the
new rule. "I see a lot of problems with stu
dents having to incriminate themselves to
receive financial aid."
How the amendment will be presented
on financial aid forms is still unknown.
But the translation process will be "a big
mess," predicted Rosenzweig.
"The forms don't exist yet. Then, once
created, they will have to go to the educa
tional institutions. And, who will be re
sponsible for checking accuracy (veri
fication of registration)?" he said.
Students will probably have to indicate
on the forms if they have registered and
the forms will then be sent to the Selec
tive Service System (SSS) for verification.
If it cannot be verified, or if the student

responds "no," then he will be open to
prosecution, though there may be a grace
period in which he could register.
Mark Hage of the Central Committee
for Conscientious Objectors explained,
"The amendment will place a terrible
burden, not only on registrants, but on
every institution of higher education. It
will produce a terrible and unwarranted
bureaucracy," he said.
Hage suggested that one possible
ramification of the legislation would be
the re-introduction of draft cards (as was
done in the 19605) to expedite the identi
fication of registrants.
The SSS presently sends a letter to all
registrants acknowledging the receipt of
a registration card and asking to be
notified of any change in the registrant's
address. In an attempt to identify Ameri
