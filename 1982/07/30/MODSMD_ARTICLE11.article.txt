## Refs: viewing IMs from another angle 
### 
Picture the excitement. There
is a turnover in the backcourt,
and the fast break develops the
other way. As the outside refer
ee you spring down the floor
with the players. You cut to the
hoop at the baseline but go too
far, and, in your best Maxwell
Smart imitation, splatter yourself
onto the folded-up stands. Si
multaneously you can hear the
offensive player collide with his
defensive counterpart, they
both hit the floor with a "thud,"
and the ball goes flying. With
your face pressed against lami
nated wood you are unable to
make a call. Both teams scream:
"C'mon ref. You've gotta call
that. What are we paying you
for?"
So went a first night as a
basketball referee.
Yes, it's true, we intramural of
ficials get paid in money, not in
compliments. During the hours
of running I remind myself that
refereeing is the best way to hear
entertaining lines such as:
"This is like a television show.
They're calling everything."
(From the same players who
complain that they are getting
brutalized by the evil opposition
and you're not calling it)
"When are you going to call
that?"
"Where's the foul, ref? Aren't
you going to call that?"
"Are you blind?"
"I didn't touch him."
"Me?!"
"Good call. Just call it both
ways."
"This game is a farce."
"Do you know these guys
(other team) really well?"
"How much money did they
(other team) pay you?" (Person
ally, I feel it should be $5O per
game, with more for playoffs).
"Your lack of basketball
knowledge just disgusts me."
"My dog could do better."
"Read the rules, ref." Well, I
have, and IM rules are . . .
unique. Contrary to certain
sneakered people's opinions, a
ball is not declared to hit the top
of the backboard unless... it ac
tually hits the top. Close does
not count. Nor is there such a
thing as a backcourt foul. Foul

shots are played off the rim, not
off the shooter's hand. The clock
runs constantly in the first half
and likewise in the second half
until the final two minutes. Why?
Why not? "I'm a doctor, Jim, not
an official."
Try this braintwister. If the of
fensive player dribbles the ball
up the half-court line, steps
over, but continues to dribble
the ball in the backcourt, do you
blow the whistle? Is it over and
back?
Ah, but that's only basketball,
you say. What about softball, the
great American pastime? Grass,
sunshine, beer, and good cheer.
Balls lost in the sun, overthrows,
holes in the gloves, Billy Ball
baserunning, enthusiasm, and
occasional good plays. A sum
mer afternoon on the Farm.

The team names surely invite
sportsmanship for all IM sports:
Earthquake vs. Mishandled Balls,
Lovetron vs. Swish, Big Mac At
tack vs. Burgerman, Not Guilty
But Sane vs. Blockheads, Built
For Comfort vs. Orgy '79, Un
knowns vs. Invisible Hands, and
the Geezenslaw Brothers vs. The
Ted Mack Amateur Hour.
So you envision a kickback
panacea of mellow tanning.
Have you noticed, though, how
baseball players argue with um
pires on the TV sports news late
ly? If Dave Winfield and Bobby
Grich can do it, so can IM types:
"That was a strike!"
"Foul?"
"Hey, ump, you know those
guys?"
"I didn't know you could
bring your own umpire with
you."
"What do you mean he's
safe?"
"She came off the bag."
"Shaky call, ump."
"What about interference?"
"Well, take the rest of the af
ternoon off, too?"
One calls the pitch a ball, and
both the pitcher and the hitter
express surprise. Nobody ap
preciates charity from an um
pire.
Interested? Anyone can be
come an official; it's an ex
perience. Yet there never seem
to be enough of us. Try it next
year.
Look for these 1983 innova
tions in fashion and gadgetry:
• bionic glasses guaranteed to
produce vision and good calls.
• new circular striped shirts
with the bullseye on the chest.
• laryngitis gun to aim and va
porize diatribes of disgruntled,
dastardly deviates.
• particle emitter to maintain
good vibes and reinforce ev
eryone's having a good time.
