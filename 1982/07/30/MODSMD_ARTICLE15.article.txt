# Speakers discuss nuclear arms race
## Ex-negotiator advocates immediate arms treaty 
### Jane Bailie 
San Jose Former chief U.S.
arms control negotiator Paul
Warnke told a large audience
here Tuesday that the United
States and the Soviet Union must
immediately develop a nuclear
disarmament treaty.
"Time is against us. Both (na
tions) are developing a greater
counter force capability. Yet
neither side can really develop a
first strike capability/' Warnke
said.
The talk drew approximately
2700 spectators to San Jose's
Center for the Performing Arts.
Unless the Reagan adminis

tration realizes the urgent need
for such a negotation, said
Warnke, further technological
advances could lead to an im
balance in the nuclear stalemate
which currently keeps the two
superpowers in check. "Neither
country is going to negotiate a
treaty that puts it at a disadvan
tage," statesd Warnke. "You
can't get results if you're going
to continue increasing."
Warnke, currently a partner in
the Washington, D.C. law firm
Clifford and Warnke, advocates
a ban on nuclear weapons tes
ting in addition to the proposed

freeze on actual weapons pro
duction and installation. Ob
served Warnke, "If we stop tes
ting, then we will lose con
fidence in our nuclear weapons
stock. I say speed the day. How
ever, if we stop testing, scientists
will no longer regard nuclear

weaponry as a growing in
dustry."
When asked if he thought the
Reagan administration was seri
ous about bringing an end to the
arms race, Warnke replied, "I
don't know. I think they can get
serious in a hurry. It's a matter of
putting pressure on the White
House and Congress. Let them
know that the American public
will not be satisifed with cos
metics. We want results."
A former assistant secretary of
defense and President Jimmy
Carter's chief negotiator in the

second round of Strategic Arms
Limitation Talks (SALT II),
Warnke said, "The frictions will
continue and we must expect
that there will be recurrent
crises."
Warnke explains that a "step
by-step process" would be the

only feasible solution to the
present situation between the
two nations. "SALT II cannot be
ratified without major mod
ifications.
"We can succeed in this en
deavor if our leadership is seri
ous in this effort," said Warnke.
"It's of critical importance that
our American leaders not be left
in doubt of what the people
want."
The only way to achieve supe
riority, Warnke explains, is "if
you have the ability to destroy
the other side, and the other side

can't destroy you. Each side
could lead the other side to feel
that it couldn't retaliate, and
would therefore have to strike
first."
Warnke said that without arms
control, "we cannot expect the
present strategic stable balance
to continue. Our basic security is
threatened as never before, and
trillions of dollars will not solve
the problem."
Should each nation be al
lowed to continue the manufac
ture of nuclear weapons, "both
sides become more vulnerable
and more deadly," said Warnke.
In that type of environment,
Warnke said, both governments
could develop a sense of
vulnerability which could possi
bly lead either nation to rely on a
first strike strategy as a means of
defense.
Should such a situation occur,
he said, "the balance of terror"
that currently prevents either
power from utilizing its nuclear
weaponry will disappear.
Warnke said the Soviets "have
just as much interest as we have
(in arms control)" and urged
"that we see to it that the ac
complishments of Nixon, Ford,
and Carter are not forgotten and

Should each nation be allowed to continue the
manufacture of nuclear weapons, "both sides
become more vunerable and more deadly,"said
Warnke. In that type of enviroment, Warnke said,
both governments could develop a sense of
vunerability which could possibly lead either
nation to rely on a first strike strategy as a means of
defense.
we don't have to start from
square one.
"SALT II should not be rati
fied," continued Warnke, "be
cause it sets bad precedents...
Yet if you wait for that one ul
timate perfect agreement, you'll
wait forever."
Warnke disagreed with the
Reagan administration's claim
that the Soviets presently possess
nuclear superiority over the
United States. "I do not know of
one military leader in the U.S.
government who would trade
our forces for the Russians'."
Warnke does not advocate
unilateral disarmament since the
differences between the Soviet
Union and the United States are
"too deep and fundamental.
"The president wants a sub

stantial reduction in ballistic mis
sile warheads, especially
ICBMs," explained Warnke.
"But we have to expect a certain
amount of resistance because
those are 75 percent of the Sovi
ets' forces. So the question is,
what are we prepared to throw
on the table for a quid pro quo?"
Warnke emphasized that any
treaty must be "unambiguous
and clear" to avoid confusion
and possible problems in either
single or mutual compliance.
"History shows that the Sovi
ets live up to the letter and I
emphasize the letter of arms
control agreements. Don't
count on them to live up to the
spirit," he said.
"Despite the differences be
tween these two countries,"
concluded Warnke, "I cannot
see that the grievence can justify
the jeopardy of their own na
tional existence."

Warnke. In that type of enviroment, Warnke said,
both governments could develop a sense of
vunerability which could possibly lead either
nation to rely on a first strike strategy as a means of
defense.
we don't have to start from
square one.
"SALT II should not be rati
fied," continued Warnke, "be
cause it sets bad precedents...
Yet if you wait for that one ul
timate perfect agreement, you'll
wait forever."
Warnke disagreed with the
Reagan administration's claim
that the Soviets presently possess
nuclear superiority over the
United States. "I do not know of
one military leader in the U.S.
government who would trade
our forces for the Russians'."
Warnke does not advocate
unilateral disarmament since the
differences between the Soviet
Union and the United States are
"too deep and fundamental.
"The president wants a sub

stantial reduction in ballistic mis
sile warheads, especially
ICBMs," explained Warnke.
"But we have to expect a certain
amount of resistance because
those are 75 percent of the Sovi
ets' forces. So the question is,
what are we prepared to throw
on the table for a quid pro quo?"
Warnke emphasized that any
treaty must be "unambiguous
and clear" to avoid confusion
and possible problems in either
single or mutual compliance.
"History shows that the Sovi
ets live up to the letter and I
emphasize the letter of arms
control agreements. Don't
count on them to live up to the
spirit," he said.
"Despite the differences be
tween these two countries,"
concluded Warnke, "I cannot
see that the grievence can justify
the jeopardy of their own na
tional existence."
San Jose Former chief U.S.
arms control negotiator Paul
Warnke told a large audience
here Tuesday that the United
States and the Soviet Union must
immediately develop a nuclear
disarmament treaty.
"Time is against us. Both (na
tions) are developing a greater
counter force capability. Yet
neither side can really develop a
first strike capability/' Warnke
said.
The talk drew approximately
2700 spectators to San Jose's
Center for the Performing Arts.
Unless the Reagan adminis

tration realizes the urgent need
for such a negotation, said
Warnke, further technological
advances could lead to an im
balance in the nuclear stalemate
which currently keeps the two
superpowers in check. "Neither
country is going to negotiate a
treaty that puts it at a disadvan
tage," statesd Warnke. "You
can't get results if you're going
to continue increasing."
Warnke, currently a partner in
the Washington, D.C. law firm
Clifford and Warnke, advocates
a ban on nuclear weapons tes
ting in addition to the proposed

freeze on actual weapons pro
duction and installation. Ob
served Warnke, "If we stop tes
ting, then we will lose con
fidence in our nuclear weapons
stock. I say speed the day. How
ever, if we stop testing, scientists
will no longer regard nuclear

weaponry as a growing in
dustry."
When asked if he thought the
Reagan administration was seri
ous about bringing an end to the
arms race, Warnke replied, "I
don't know. I think they can get
serious in a hurry. It's a matter of
putting pressure on the White
House and Congress. Let them
know that the American public
will not be satisifed with cos
metics. We want results."
A former assistant secretary of
defense and President Jimmy
Carter's chief negotiator in the

second round of Strategic Arms
Limitation Talks (SALT II),
Warnke said, "The frictions will
continue and we must expect
that there will be recurrent
crises."
Warnke explains that a "step
by-step process" would be the

only feasible solution to the
present situation between the
two nations. "SALT II cannot be
ratified without major mod
ifications.
"We can succeed in this en
deavor if our leadership is seri
ous in this effort," said Warnke.
"It's of critical importance that
our American leaders not be left
in doubt of what the people
want."
The only way to achieve supe
riority, Warnke explains, is "if
you have the ability to destroy
the other side, and the other side

can't destroy you. Each side
could lead the other side to feel
that it couldn't retaliate, and
would therefore have to strike
first."
Warnke said that without arms
control, "we cannot expect the
present strategic stable balance
to continue. Our basic security is
threatened as never before, and
trillions of dollars will not solve
the problem."
Should each nation be al
lowed to continue the manufac
ture of nuclear weapons, "both
sides become more vulnerable
and more deadly," said Warnke.
In that type of environment,
Warnke said, both governments
could develop a sense of
vulnerability which could possi
bly lead either nation to rely on a
first strike strategy as a means of
defense.
Should such a situation occur,
he said, "the balance of terror"
that currently prevents either
power from utilizing its nuclear
weaponry will disappear.
Warnke said the Soviets "have
just as much interest as we have
(in arms control)" and urged
"that we see to it that the ac
complishments of Nixon, Ford,
and Carter are not forgotten and

Should each nation be allowed to continue the
manufacture of nuclear weapons, "both sides
become more vunerable and more deadly,"said
Warnke. In that type of enviroment, Warnke said,

vunerability which could possibly lead either
nation to rely on a first strike strategy as a means of
