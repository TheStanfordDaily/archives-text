# Lewis: public awareness rising
## 
### Jane Bailie 
The American public is becoming increasingly
aware of nuclear weaponry, according to Political
Science Prof. John Lewis.
"This sense of awareness that we are now in is
quite a dramatic change. There have been move
ments like this in the past, but they have been quite
rare," said Lewis.
Lewis spoke Wednesday in Terman
Auditorium on the topic,"Can START (Strategic
Arms Reduction Talks) get started?" His talk
focused on the development of nuclear artillery
and the inherent dangers of increased reliance on
nuclear armaments in both the Soviet Union and
United States.
Lewis lamented how infrequently public opin
ion "lines up with anything you could do about the
process (nuclear disarmament)," and added, "very
often the public opinion has run counter to any
thing that people know about it."
"There are times," continued Lewis, "when
people have affected the decision; sometimes
wisely, sometimes not wisely. But in fact, public
opinion helped to kill SALT II."

This occurred, according to Lewis, because
before the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan there
was "a growing feeling that there was a major
threat on the part of the Soviets, and that would
not only not be met by SALT, but would somehow
be increased."
Looking back over the last 15 years of student
awareness of the nuclear arms situation, Lewis said,
"One of the clear senses that I have ... (is that)
most of them have been tuned out.
"Most people have not paid very much atten
tion, partly because they can't do anything about
it, partly because they don't understand it, and
partly because it's so hard to grasp that it doesn't
really help to think about it very much."
Lewis emphasized that there are not likely to be
any "defense capabilities."
"Most of those things (defense methods) that
are known about do not solve the basic problem
that the offense can overwhelm the defense.
Therefore, we're in that terrible situation which is
sometimes called 'the hostage world.' " Lewis feels
that attempts to improve defense make the situ
ation worse, because "if you try
to defend yourselves, you will
increase the incentive to impact
on that target even more."
Lewis suggested a novel meth
od of increasing public aware
ness. "Some of my friends on the
Manhattan Project argue that
there ought to be a nuclear
weapons demonstration every
five years for the leaders so they
would have some sense that
these aren't political objects."
He then offered statistics il

lustrating the non-political na
ture of nuclear weapons. "For
example, the Trident submarine
commander is the third largest
nuclear power. He has on board
something in the order of 240 to
336 warheads which could hit in
dependently 240 to 336 different
targets, each at least the destruc
tive power of the Hiroshima
bomb.
"Right now we have 50,000
nuclear warheads," estimated
Lewis, "which gives us the de
structive capability of 10,000
World War lis or 1 million times
the destructive power of the
Hiroshima bomb."
