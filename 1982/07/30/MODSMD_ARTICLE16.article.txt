# Lewis: public awareness rising

The American public is becoming increasingly
aware of nuclear weaponry, according to Political
Science Prof. John Lewis.
"This sense of awareness that we are now in is
quite a dramatic change. There have been move
ments like this in the past, but they have been quite
rare," said Lewis.
Lewis spoke Wednesday in Terman
Auditorium on the topic,"Can START (Strategic
Arms Reduction Talks) get started?" His talk
focused on the development of nuclear artillery

really help to think about it very much."
Lewis emphasized that there are not likely to be
any "defense capabilities."
"Most of those things (defense methods) that
are known about do not solve the basic problem
that the offense can overwhelm the defense.
Therefore, we're in that terrible situation which is
sometimes called 'the hostage world.' " Lewis feels
that attempts to improve defense make the situ
