# Police reinstate campus motorcycle patrol

The red lights and siren of leg
endary campus police officer
"Captain Midnight" will be the
only things missing when the
University police reinstate a mo
torcycle patrol this September,
according to Captain Marvin
Moore.
In a move to introduce more
enforcement in the Quad, two
police officers will patrol White
Plaza on red Honda 250 CCs. The
motorcycles will be equipped
for patrolling off-road areas and
the large sections of the inner
campus which are blocked by
bollards to vehicle traffic.
Moore said Chief Marvin Har
rington decided to implement
the motorcycle squad because
of the "numerous complaints"
which the station receives re
garding mopeds. Despite the
bollards, mopeds continue to
enter the Quad illegally.
Two officers will patrol the
Quad area from 7:30 a.m. to 5
p.m., said Moore. "The Quad
will actually become a beat
itself," said Moore. "They (the
officers) will also be responsible
for other duties," he added.
Police now occasionally patrol
White Plaza on foot. "We let
them go for it," said Moore.
The new unit does not require
additional police officers, said
Moore. Rather than use two of
ficers per squad car, ex
perienced riders will be assigned
to the motorcycle patrol.
Officers will issue citations to
people illegally using motor
driven vehicles in the inner cam
pus. But Moore said "tickets
aren't the primary function" of
the new unit.
Use of both mopeds and auto
mobiles within White Plaza con

stitutes a moving violation, said
Moore. Both are subject to a ve
hicle exclusion fine.
Because automobile and
moped citations are classified to
gether, neither the police nor
the Santa Clara Municipal
Courts have a record of moped
violations. Sara Rodriguez of the
Santa Clara Municipal Court
said, "We process those just like
motor vehicles. They (mopeds)
are not flagged in any different
way."
But Rodriguez said that of the
50 traffic citations issued on av
erage each week by University
police, one-third are generally
for mopeds. She stressed that
these figures are for traffic, rath
er than parking, violations.
Again because the violations
are classified together, repeat
moped and automobile violators
may be subject to the same pen
alties, such as driving school,
said Moore.
Fines vary depending on the
judge's discretion. But Moore
said they are "in the ballpark"
of $2O to $25. "It is kind of a stiff
fine," he added.
Moore estimated that moped
traffic has more than doubled in
the past two years. "Two years
ago I rarely saw a moped," he
said.
Regarding the proposed traf
fic lanes in the mall area, Moore
said they should "relieve some
of the traffic."
According to Moore, the new
unit will cost slightly more than
$3500. It will not affect patrol
units now in operation.
The moped patrol officers will
use Honda 250 CCs, which are
dual bikes. But Moore said,

"They (the motorcycles) have
the appearance of a dirt bike."
He stressed the versatility and
flexibility of the vehicles. "Mo
torcycles are very useful, fhey
have quick response time," he
said.
In addition to patroling the
large mall area, the motorcycle
policemen will be able to patrol
the catwalks and bicycle paths
which honeycomb the residen
tial area, said Moore.
Officers will wear protective
uniforms with specific padding.
"We're trying to make it as com
fortable as possible," said
Moore.
In the 19605, "bikes were part
of overall enforcement," said
Moore.
At that time, officer Carl
Gielitz, popularly known as
"Captain Midnight," held mo
torcycle duty. But Gielitz said the
anti-war riots of the '6os caused
the motorcycle patrol to end.
The motorcycle patrol ended
largely for safety reasons,, he
said, because motorcycles offer
little protection to the rider.
Gielitz, who retired from the
force in 1981 after 32 years, said
the new patrol will differ from
his. "They won't be working traf
fic like I did."
He also cited changes in
equipment and emphasis.
"When I was riding a motor
cycle, it had all the equipment
with it a radio, a siren, red
lights," he said. The new patrol
will travel with only portable ra
dios and mikes, night sticks, spe
cial lights, first aid kits and cita
tion books. They will not carry

sirens because they are not de
signed for emergency pursuit.
Officers will radio a call for as
sistance if needed.
"I worked all kinds of traffic,"
said Gielitz.
Gielitz called the patrol a good
idea. "(Motorcycles) were real
mobile no matter what the traffic
conditions were about the cam
pus," he said. "We could get
through traffic."
According to Sergeant Philip
Love, who will be field super
visor of the new patrol, officers
will receive special training for
the job. Gielitz said, "If they
want me to come back and train,
I'll be available."

on the inner campus will run an increasing risk of being
ticketed when the campus motorcycle patrol begins.
