# Pizzeria raises economic and aesthetic questions
## 
### Ray Newman 
The ASSU proposal to build a
take-out pizzeria between the
boathouse and Lomita Drive
near the boathouse faces poten
tially serious aesthetic and eco
nomic questions before it is ap
proved by the University, ac
cording to administrators here.
According to Associate Dean
of Student Affairs Thomas
Massey, a final decision to ap
prove or disapprove the pizzeria
will "come as a result of a con
sensus." He said "anyone who is
going to be affected" by the pro
posal will be involved in the de
cision.
Potential problems include
competition with Tresidder
Union and the pub planned for
Encina Station, the accuracy of
the economic analysis contained
in the ASSU proposal, and
whether the pizzeria would be
aesthetically attractive, ASSU
Council of Presidents member
Mark Epstein said.
Economics seems to be a ma
jor issue.
Tresidder Union Director Ellie
Oppenheim said, "There is
probably some limit" to the
number of food services that can
be operated profitably on cam
pus. "It's not clear to me how
clearly the markets are sepa
rated," she added. As director,
Oppenheim has "discretion
over food sales outside Tres
idder," said Massey.
The ASSU proposal dist
inguishes between the markets
for a "location-based" restau
rant and a take-out service, and
claims that the markets are "ex
actly opposite."
According to Massey, one of
the things that the Office of the
Dean of Student Affairs will do is
review the economic picture
presented by the ASSU report.
"We'll check to see if there are
any other data around," he said.
Margaret Ann Fidler, associate
dean of student affairs, said that
the ASSU may have under
estimated labor costs. The ASSU
has called for the pizzeria to be
constructed by student laborers
under the supervision of a con
tractor. The dean's office has
"no problem intrinsically" with
student laborers performing the
construction work, Fidler said,
but there may be some safety
problems, which would require
professional handling.

According to Epstein, another
question raised by the University
is whether the new pizzeria
building would be aesthetically
pleasant. The building would be
visible both from the road and
from a University-owned house
overlooking the lake.
Fidler said there may be "ma
jor problems with the site, given
the type of the building and the
location of the building . .. I
guess it would boil down to
aesthetics."
According to the proposal, the
pizzeria will be housed in a pre
fabricated building.
In addition, said Fidler, the
University has raised the "overall
personal safety issue." She said,
"we're dealing with a night time
operation in a fairly secluded
area."
According to Epstein, other
complaints include increased
traffic at the lake if the pizzeria
and other proposed projects
were built. "There will be more
people at the lake, but I'm all for
that," he said.
The ASSU has cleared its first
hurdle and is ready to file "Form
1," signed by an official with the
Office of the Dean of Student Af
fairs, as the first step in receiving
University approval for the
pizzeria, according to Epstein.
The form means only that the
dean's office "is willing to con
sider it," Epstein said.
The proposal will also be in
spected by the Provost's Office,
the Planning Office, a program
manager, and the University
Committee on Land and Build
ing Development, according to
Epstein. The office of the Dean
of Student Affairs will remain ac
tive in the decision, he said.
Tresidder Union officials will
meet on the proposal "within
the next week or so, " Op
penheim said.
According to Fidler, the Office
of the Dean of Student Affairs
could review cost estimates for
the actual construction of the
pizzeria within "a couple of
weeks" if the ASSU does submit
a Form 1.
The ASSU proposal calls for
the profits from the pizzeria to
finance ASSU funds and to pro
vide money for the upkeep and
proposed expansion of the
boathouse facilities and area.
According to the proposal,
Domino's and Ramona's

pizzerias have a combined cam
pus delivery market of 300 pizzas
per night. The ASSU is targeting
sales of about 120 pizzas per
night at a price (for a 16-inch
pizza) of $6.50, Epstein said.
Proposed general improve
ments of the boathouse area in
clude planting grass and install
ing a sprinkler system, convert
ing existing bedrooms into a
public changing room, bath
room, and an office for the
boathouse staff, and installing a
sand volleyball court. The ASSU
proposal slates the improve
ments, some of which are for
safety reasons, to take place by
Sept. 30 of this year.
Epstein described an im
proved boathouse as an on-cam
pus area in which graduate and

off-campus students could
gather.
The actual pizzeria construc
tion would begin only when the
proposal is approved, Epstein
said.
Epstein and four other
boathouse residents are current
ly repairing the facility. They live
at the boathouse and are
granted free rent in exchange
for working on repairs for 12
hours a week.
Completed work includes re
placing planking on the upper
boathouse deck and on the
walkway leading to the
boathouse, installing lights and
burglar alarms, and repairing
some plumbing and structural
damage.

traffic at the lake if the pizzeria
and other proposed projects
were built. "There will be more
people at the lake, but I'm all for
that," he said.
The ASSU has cleared its first
hurdle and is ready to file "Form
1," signed by an official with the
Office of the Dean of Student Af
fairs, as the first step in receiving
University approval for the
pizzeria, according to Epstein.
The form means only that the
dean's office "is willing to con
sider it," Epstein said.
The proposal will also be in
spected by the Provost's Office,
the Planning Office, a program
manager, and the University
Committee on Land and Build
ing Development, according to
Epstein. The office of the Dean
of Student Affairs will remain ac
tive in the decision, he said.
Tresidder Union officials will
meet on the proposal "within
the next week or so, " Op
penheim said.
According to Fidler, the Office
of the Dean of Student Affairs
could review cost estimates for
the actual construction of the
pizzeria within "a couple of
weeks" if the ASSU does submit
a Form 1.
The ASSU proposal calls for
the profits from the pizzeria to
finance ASSU funds and to pro
vide money for the upkeep and
proposed expansion of the
boathouse facilities and area.
According to the proposal,
Domino's and Ramona's

pizzerias have a combined cam
pus delivery market of 300 pizzas
per night. The ASSU is targeting
sales of about 120 pizzas per
night at a price (for a 16-inch
pizza) of $6.50, Epstein said.
Proposed general improve
ments of the boathouse area in
clude planting grass and install
ing a sprinkler system, convert
ing existing bedrooms into a
public changing room, bath
room, and an office for the
boathouse staff, and installing a
sand volleyball court. The ASSU
proposal slates the improve
ments, some of which are for
safety reasons, to take place by
Sept. 30 of this year.
Epstein described an im
proved boathouse as an on-cam
pus area in which graduate and

University administrators.
off-campus students could
gather.
The actual pizzeria construc
tion would begin only when the
proposal is approved, Epstein
said.
Epstein and four other
boathouse residents are current
ly repairing the facility. They live
at the boathouse and are
granted free rent in exchange
for working on repairs for 12
hours a week.
Completed work includes re
placing planking on the upper
boathouse deck and on the
walkway leading to the
boathouse, installing lights and
burglar alarms, and repairing
some plumbing and structural
damage.
The ASSU proposal to build a
take-out pizzeria between the
boathouse and Lomita Drive
near the boathouse faces poten
tially serious aesthetic and eco
nomic questions before it is ap
proved by the University, ac
cording to administrators here.
According to Associate Dean
of Student Affairs Thomas
Massey, a final decision to ap
prove or disapprove the pizzeria
will "come as a result of a con
sensus." He said "anyone who is
going to be affected" by the pro
posal will be involved in the de
cision.
Potential problems include
competition with Tresidder
Union and the pub planned for
Encina Station, the accuracy of
the economic analysis contained
in the ASSU proposal, and
whether the pizzeria would be
aesthetically attractive, ASSU
Council of Presidents member
Mark Epstein said.
Economics seems to be a ma
jor issue.
Tresidder Union Director Ellie
Oppenheim said, "There is
probably some limit" to the
number of food services that can
be operated profitably on cam
pus. "It's not clear to me how
clearly the markets are sepa
rated," she added. As director,
Oppenheim has "discretion
over food sales outside Tres
idder," said Massey.
The ASSU proposal dist
inguishes between the markets
for a "location-based" restau
rant and a take-out service, and
claims that the markets are "ex
actly opposite."
According to Massey, one of
the things that the Office of the
Dean of Student Affairs will do is
review the economic picture
presented by the ASSU report.
"We'll check to see if there are
any other data around," he said.
Margaret Ann Fidler, associate
dean of student affairs, said that
the ASSU may have under
estimated labor costs. The ASSU
has called for the pizzeria to be
constructed by student laborers
under the supervision of a con
tractor. The dean's office has
"no problem intrinsically" with
student laborers performing the
construction work, Fidler said,
but there may be some safety
problems, which would require
professional handling.

According to Epstein, another
question raised by the University
is whether the new pizzeria
building would be aesthetically
pleasant. The building would be
visible both from the road and
from a University-owned house
overlooking the lake.
Fidler said there may be "ma
jor problems with the site, given
the type of the building and the
location of the building . .. I
guess it would boil down to
aesthetics."
According to the proposal, the
pizzeria will be housed in a pre
fabricated building.
In addition, said Fidler, the
University has raised the "overall
personal safety issue." She said,
"we're dealing with a night time
operation in a fairly secluded
area."
According to Epstein, other
complaints include increased
traffic at the lake if the pizzeria
and other proposed projects
were built. "There will be more
people at the lake, but I'm all for
that," he said.
The ASSU has cleared its first
