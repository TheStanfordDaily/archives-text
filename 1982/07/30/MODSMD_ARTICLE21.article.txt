# Children's hospital merges with Center
## $41 million children's hospital to be built 
### Forrest Maltzman 
First it was Eastern and Pan
American Airlines. Then it was
Dean Witter Reynolds and
Sears Roebuck. Now it appears
as if the Children's Hospital at
Stanford (CHS) and the
pediatric department of the
Stanford University Hospital
(SUH) are going to follow suit
and merge.
The board of directors of
both CHS and SUH last week
unanimously agreed to con
solidate the pediatric facilities
of the two institutions.
The new hospital will be
housed in a new facility to be
built at an estimated cost to the

two institutions of $4O million.
The facility is part of SUH's
modernization project, a $71.4
million construction project
expected to be completed in
1987.
Even though the new facility
will be physically attached to
SUH, the hospital will have its
own corporate identity, main
tain its own board of directors
(five members from both the
current CHS and SUH boards)
and retain the name Children's
Hospital at Stanford.
According to SUH spokes
man Mike Goodkind, the
merger will promote more effi
ciency. "We currrently have

two pediatric hospitals that are
intertwined. Doctors and pa
tients are constantly having to
commute between the facil
ities."
The present CHS, a non
profit institution, shares a com
mon medical staff with SUH
and serves as an affiliated
teaching hospital for the medi
cal school.
The new hospital will con
solidate the 60 beds of CHS and
the 44 pediatric care beds of
SUH.
The new CHS plans to pro
vide inpatient pediatric ser
vices in 15 specialties.
"The numbers are not
changing. What is changing is

location," said CHS spokes
person Vicki Applegate.
An executive director and a
chief of staff will be appointed
by the new board to run the
new facility, she said.
CHS was established in 1919
to serve as a local hospital for
youth. The University hopsital
was located in San Francisco
until 1957. When SUH moved
onto the campus in '57, the
CHS continued providing
pediatric care to local resi
dents.
Currently, CHS and SUH are
located one mile apart. This
separation has yearly required
2500 patients, who need spe
cialized services only available

at one of the hospitals, to be
transported across Willow
Road.
In November 1981, the two
hospitals began formal con
solidation discussions and
commissioned a feasibility
study.
Unlike many more tradi
tional hospitals, the CHS tries
to promote a casual and friend
ly atmosphere, Goodkind said.
Floors in the hospital are
carpeted, nurses do not wear
the traditional white uniform,
and the walls are painted bright
colors. According to
Goodkind, the new CHS will
continue to maintain this phi
losophy and ambiance.
