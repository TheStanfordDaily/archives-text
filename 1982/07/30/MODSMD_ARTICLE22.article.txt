# Med Center gifts increase

A $50,000 challenge grant
from the Kaiser Foundation,
following a $lOO,OOO outright
gift, spurred on a fundraising
drive by the University's School
of Medicine last year which re
sulted in a 150 percent increase
in contributions to the school.
The percentage increase in
contributions from alumni and
friends of the medical school
was calculated against the base
years of 1978-79. The number
of new donors increased by 47
percent, according to Sally
Agle, deputy director of Medi
cal Development.
The response to the
challenge totalled $563,937.
Forty percent of those who
gave during the 1978-79 base
years increased their gifts.
The challenge was offered to
each member of a 13-school
consortium of private medical
schools. The University is the
only West Coast member of the
group, which includes Johns
Hopkins, Harvard, and Cornell.
Agle said all 13 schools
achieved their goals.
Each donor responding to
the challenge designated one
of three areas for their con
tribution. Kaiser in turn varied
its matching grant according to
the category for which the gift
was specified. For every two
dollars given for scholarships,
the Kaiser Foundation donated
one dollar. Each three dollars
earmarked for loans yielded a
Kaiser dollar, while every four

dollars for endowments also
gained a dollar from the grant.
The donations had to be new
money in order to qualify for
the matching grant. "We were
not trading dollars," Agle said.
"We encouraged people who
hadn't been giving to con
tribute, and asked previous
givers to give more."
The intensity of fundraising
increased during the challenge
period of September 1980 to
December 1981.
Agle said that solicitations
were mainly sent to alumni and

former house staff. "We felt
that they would have the most
sympathy," she said.
All donations went into the
medical school's general schol
arship fund. Grants from the
fund are given according to a
calculation of a student's need.
The Henry J. Kaiser Family
Foundation was founded in
1948. It is a philanthropic or
ganization which administers
and reviews grant requests, pri
marily in the field of health
care.
