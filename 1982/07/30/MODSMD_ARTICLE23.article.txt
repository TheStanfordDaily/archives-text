## Heart's rare Bay Area visit worth waiting for 
### Karen Halbo 
We didn't mean to arrive late. Really. But I must
admit that neither my friend nor I were all that up
set about having missed some of John Cougar's
opening act at the Heart concert this past Tuesday
night at the Concord Paviilion'.
Watching Cougar gyrate and swagger in front of
the appreciative crowd convinced me that the ma
jority of my fellow concert-goers were on more
than a "natural" high during his act. Not long after
we arrived, a young woman seated in front of us
leaned over the back of her seat and quietly threw
up. Now I didn't like him either, folks, but he
wasn't that bad.
I didn't mind sitting through the rock n' roll
Cougar purports to play, primarily because there
was so much to watch during the act. The backup
singers for Cougar's band were some very
energetic women, two modern-day Supremes,
who danced and leapt around the stage in a most
entertaining manner. However, they couldn't steal
the spotlight away from Cougar, who managed to
knock over his microphone during the show, and
nearly hung himself on the cord neartheend of his
act.
However, the piece de resistance for Cougar's
act was just before his first encore, when, much to
the security guards' distress, he hopped off the
stage and ran up and down the aisles of the lower
section. We watched, amused, as the guards pulled
the frantic young girls off Cougar's person so he
could return to the stage for his encore. He played
a new song off his album American Fool entitled
"Jack and Diane." It's a catchy tune, with the de
pressing refrain, "Life goes on, long after the thrill
of living is gone." That sort of describes how we
felt about his act.
But Cougar was just the opening act for the

older, and much more polished, Heart. Opening
the act with "Crazy on You" from their Dreamboat
Annie album, Ann Wilson quickly proved that her
soaring and powerful voice is as beautiful as ever.
I bought my first Heart album when I was in high
school, and was a little surprised to see that Ann
and Nancy Wilson have grown up quite a bit since
then. Ann (the one with the dark hair) was at least
30 pounds heavier then she had been in the earlier
days, but her voice had lost none of its charm.
What the hell, if opera stars can do it, why not a
female rock star? It was just something of a shock
for me to see such a drastic change.
Nancy Wilson (the blond one) looked much as
she had on the albums, except that she has gotten a
Streisand-like kinky hairdo, and for some god
awful reason wore tight leopard skin pants with
spike heels. Of course, I mean, what else does one
wear to play guitar for three hours?
One of the nicest songs during the concert had
to be "Mistral Wind," which started with a blue
light focused on Nancy, who played the lovely
chords at the beginning of the song, and then
opened up to include the whole stage as the music
shifted into the gripping hard rock that can be
found in the best of Heart's music.
Another nice moment was when, near the end
of the concert, they swung into a spirited version
of "Barracuda" which brought the crowd to its
feet, and brought the more enthusiastic fans out
into the aisles.
During the concert, Ann Wilson remarked that it
had been far too long since they had played in the
Bay Area, and that hopefully it won't be so long
before the next time they come. After a great show,
with four encores, all the fans at Concord that
night were hoping the same thing.
