It was Bastille Day jn
France, but America the
beautiful reigned in San Fran
cisco on July 14 when the Jof
frey Ballet presented a pro
gram of works that were not
only danced by Americans,
but also choreographed and
set to music by Americans. If
anything could inspire na
tional pride, this evening
could. The next evening, the
dancers moved over to Eu
rope with a performance of
John Cranko's Taming of the
Shrew , a sometimes tedious
work with which the dancers
did their best.
Cranko's choreography
drags, especially in the first
act where there is far too
much clowning by Bianca's
suitors and an excess of unin
teresting variations which
have little to do with the plot.
But then Beatrice
Rodriguez, as Katherina,
Bianca's old-maid sister, en
ters. Rodriguez's fiery in

terpretation of Katherina
finally got things going. At
first, Rodriguez's explosive,
strong dancing overpowered
the otherwise static first act,
but later proved to be a won
derful complement to the in
sipid dancing and character
of Bianca. Rodriguez's
change from untamed shrew
to Petruchio's somewhat sub
dued wife vvas marvelous as
well. Jerel Hilding danced
Petruchio, providing the sec
ond half of a wonderfully spir
ited couple.
Patricia Miller and James
Canfield as Bianca and Lucen
tio were perfectly limp, giving
a hilarious contrast to their
fiery counterparts. Their pas
de deux in the second act was
enchanting, however,
danced with beautiful tech
nique and feeling, and the
two managed to shine despite
the lack of personality which
their parts called for.
But if it were not for these
stars, the ballet would have

been very hard to endure.
Cranko tends to get long
winded in between his de
lightful moments, as in the
first act and the carnival
scene. In the latter, the corps
appears as a frolicking, ex
quisitely costumed mob of
clowns. Everything is bright
and gay, and at first very excit
ing, but it all becomes very
boring by the end, making a
potentially exciting scene
monotonous.
The stars are wonderful,
however, and there is little
the rest of the cast can do as
this Shrew is choreographed
now. With a little tightening,
The Taming of the Shrew
could be an entertaining and
engaging work.
The previous evening
needed no tightening, how
ever, as the company danced
a thoroughly enjoyable eve
ning of Americana.
