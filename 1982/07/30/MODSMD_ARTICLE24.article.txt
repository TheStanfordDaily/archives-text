# The 						Joffrey goes 1 for 2

### Mary Walp 
It was Bastille Day jn
France, but America the
beautiful reigned in San Fran
cisco on July 14 when the Jof
frey Ballet presented a pro
gram of works that were not
only danced by Americans,
but also choreographed and
set to music by Americans. If
anything could inspire na
tional pride, this evening
could. The next evening, the
dancers moved over to Eu
rope with a performance of
John Cranko's Taming of the
Shrew , a sometimes tedious
work with which the dancers
did their best.
Cranko's choreography
drags, especially in the first
act where there is far too
much clowning by Bianca's
suitors and an excess of unin
teresting variations which
have little to do with the plot.
But then Beatrice
Rodriguez, as Katherina,
Bianca's old-maid sister, en
ters. Rodriguez's fiery in

terpretation of Katherina
finally got things going. At
first, Rodriguez's explosive,
strong dancing overpowered
the otherwise static first act,
but later proved to be a won
derful complement to the in
sipid dancing and character
of Bianca. Rodriguez's
change from untamed shrew
to Petruchio's somewhat sub
dued wife vvas marvelous as
well. Jerel Hilding danced
Petruchio, providing the sec
ond half of a wonderfully spir
ited couple.
Patricia Miller and James
Canfield as Bianca and Lucen
tio were perfectly limp, giving
a hilarious contrast to their
fiery counterparts. Their pas
de deux in the second act was
enchanting, however,
danced with beautiful tech
nique and feeling, and the
two managed to shine despite
the lack of personality which
their parts called for.
But if it were not for these
stars, the ballet would have

been very hard to endure.
Cranko tends to get long
winded in between his de
lightful moments, as in the
first act and the carnival
scene. In the latter, the corps
appears as a frolicking, ex
quisitely costumed mob of
clowns. Everything is bright
and gay, and at first very excit
ing, but it all becomes very
boring by the end, making a
potentially exciting scene
monotonous.
The stars are wonderful,
however, and there is little
the rest of the cast can do as
this Shrew is choreographed
now. With a little tightening,
The Taming of the Shrew
could be an entertaining and
engaging work.
The previous evening
needed no tightening, how
ever, as the company danced
a thoroughly enjoyable eve
ning of Americana.
Gerald Arpino's new ballet,
Light Rain, started off the eve
ning. It is a wonderful ballet.
Set to a fusion of eastern and
western musical forms, it
starts off with the entire cast
massed together, reaching
upwards with fluttering
hands. From there, Arpino's
choreography takes the dan
cers through some very beau
tiful, evocative and in
novative moves. One pas de
deux in particular, danced by
Leslie Carothers and James
Canfield, was especially riv
eting and sensual.
The dancers in Light Rain
showed us some pretty amaz
ing technique, yet fortunately
there was no showing off.
Light Rain is a moving work
and the dancers helped make

it an excellent one.
Laura Dean's Night was also
on the program, a ballet for
eight dancers set to Dean's
own piano score. The Joffrey
dancers worked within the
controlled, contained move
ment to create a mesmerizing
experience. Night is jazzy at
times, but the overall effect of
the ballet is that of a whirling
mass of dancers who are
strangely distanced. This
makes it a difficult ballet to
carry off without boring the
audience. However, the ex
pressionless faces served
Dean's purpose and helped
to create an incredibly ab
sorbing interpretation of the
night.
Trinity, the Joffrey's long
time signature work, was the
last ballet of the evening. A
rock ballet straight from 1970
Berkeley, it comes complete
with electric guitar and psy

chedelic colors. Trinity over
flows with energy and op
timism, and this particular
cast added even more, per
forming the ballet with an en
thusiasm that affected the au
dience.
Arpino's choreography
does not spring from any of
the negativeness of the time,
but rather from the peace
and-love attitudes of the
flower children. The choreo
graphy is joyous and upbeat,
built upon a classical base
which creates an effect that is
anything but classical. The
rock and jazz elements which
Arpino has added, and the
performances by the Joffrey
dancers, created an uplifting
half hour of dance. In re
sponse to the audience's en
thusiastic reaction, they
added a 10-minute encore
if only it could have been 10
weeks.

lightful moments, as in the
first act and the carnival
scene. In the latter, the corps
appears as a frolicking, ex
quisitely costumed mob of
clowns. Everything is bright
and gay, and at first very excit
ing, but it all becomes very
boring by the end, making a
potentially exciting scene
monotonous.
The stars are wonderful,
however, and there is little
the rest of the cast can do as
this Shrew is choreographed
now. With a little tightening,
The Taming of the Shrew
could be an entertaining and
engaging work.
The previous evening
needed no tightening, how
ever, as the company danced
a thoroughly enjoyable eve
ning of Americana.
Gerald Arpino's new ballet,
Light Rain, started off the eve
ning. It is a wonderful ballet.
Set to a fusion of eastern and
western musical forms, it
starts off with the entire cast
massed together, reaching
upwards with fluttering
hands. From there, Arpino's
choreography takes the dan
cers through some very beau
tiful, evocative and in
novative moves. One pas de
deux in particular, danced by
Leslie Carothers and James
Canfield, was especially riv
eting and sensual.
The dancers in Light Rain
showed us some pretty amaz
ing technique, yet fortunately
there was no showing off.
Light Rain is a moving work
and the dancers helped make

it an excellent one.
Laura Dean's Night was also
on the program, a ballet for
eight dancers set to Dean's
own piano score. The Joffrey
dancers worked within the
controlled, contained move
ment to create a mesmerizing
experience. Night is jazzy at
times, but the overall effect of
the ballet is that of a whirling
mass of dancers who are
strangely distanced. This
makes it a difficult ballet to
carry off without boring the
audience. However, the ex
pressionless faces served
Dean's purpose and helped
to create an incredibly ab
sorbing interpretation of the
night.
Trinity, the Joffrey's long
time signature work, was the
last ballet of the evening. A
rock ballet straight from 1970
Berkeley, it comes complete
with electric guitar and psy

chedelic colors. Trinity over
flows with energy and op
timism, and this particular
cast added even more, per
forming the ballet with an en
thusiasm that affected the au
dience.
Arpino's choreography
does not spring from any of
the negativeness of the time,
but rather from the peace
and-love attitudes of the
flower children. The choreo
graphy is joyous and upbeat,
built upon a classical base
which creates an effect that is
anything but classical. The
rock and jazz elements which
Arpino has added, and the
performances by the Joffrey
dancers, created an uplifting
half hour of dance. In re
sponse to the audience's en
thusiastic reaction, they
added a 10-minute encore
if only it could have been 10
weeks.
