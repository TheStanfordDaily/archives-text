# Fats Waller hits the big time in Palo Alto
## 
### Marc Fajer 
Ain't Misbehavin', the musical
tribute to jazz great Fats Waller,
opened Friday night at the Lucie
Stern Community Center in Palo
Alto with a display of talent and
energy that left the audience on
their feet applauding long after
the cast had left the stage. The
show, the second of
Theatre Works' Summer Festival,
is composed of musical numbers
written and/or made famous by
Waller. These songs, staged by
director Anthony Haney and
performed by an extremely tal
ented cast, are hilarious, seduc
tive, and heart rending in turn,
and succeed in evoking the rich
atmosphere of Harlem in the
1920s and '3os, where Waller
worked and played.
The ensemble had no obvious
weak points, a notable fact in a
show so dependent on the
group working together. Each
performer had strong points
which added to the overall ef
fect. Raynetta Hart has a voice to
fall in love with. In her first solo
number, "Squeeze Me," she is
as beautifully seductive playing
the unvocalized moments as
when she is singing. Rob Rob
inson (who also did the vocal
direction) and Bob Jones are a
very funny team in the numbers
"The Ladies Who Sing With the
Band" and "Fat and Greasy," the
more so because of the physical
differences between them. Rob
inson is slight; his counterpart is
a big man with a big, rich voice.
Jones exploits that voice and his
enormous comic talents in his
song to a woman with just one
problem: "Your Feet's Too Big."
Tracey Mitchem is a little bun

die of energy, whose charm and
exuberance grab attention
whenever she is on stage. She is
at her best in numbers such as
"Yacht Club Swing," a parody of
women who sang for armed
forces shows, when her smile
and her ability to use her body
make her hysterical. She has an
occasional problem making
some of the lyrics under
standable, but this often goes
unnoticed in the bounce and life
she brings to the stage.
Jeffrey Walker, Glenn
Goodson and Donne Mathias
provide stylish and athleticdanc
ing, both separately and with the
rest of the company. One of the
finest numbers in the show is
"The Viper's Drag," in which a
very stoned Walker muses about
his condition as his hallucination
(Goodson) dances around him.
The choreography (by Stanford's
Susie Cashion) is superb here,
and both men display con
siderable talent.
If one had to pick a "best"
among the talented cast, how
ever, it would have to be Renee
Lubin. Her rich voice, throaty
laugh and deliberate move
ments give something special to
a variety of songs: with Jones,
the scolding "That Ain't Right,"
and a wonderful rendition of
"Honey-Suckle Rose"; with
Mitchem, the hilarious cattiness
of "Find Out What They Like";
and, by herself, a moving blues
number, "Mean to Me."
The cast is well complemented
by B.J. Fredrickson's excellent
set. The faded neon and art deco
lines help to create the at
mosphere of the period, ably as
sisted by John Fisher's lights.

Special mention should be made
of the atmosphere created for
"The Viper's Drag"; the 4 a.m.
inebriated haze was present in
the sets and lights as well as in
the actors. The music was
marvellous. Both the band, un
der the direction of Keith
Atwater, and the vocals, directed
by Robinson, were noteworthy.
Extra plaudits should go to pian
ist Bill Liberatore. The choreo
graphy was inconsistent,
though. Some of the more
energetic numbers seemed a bit
uncontrolled, but the slower
songs were very well handled.
The most powerful moment in
the show comes near the end.

"Black and Blue," about being
just that, is performed by the cast
sitting on stools facing the au
dience. The quiet sadness and
precise singing are especially
poignant after the frenetic com
edy which precedes the
number. At this moment, the

mask of Fats Waller slips a bit,
and we can see the depth of the
man and of his work.
"Ain't Misbehavin'" will be
performedjn repertory until
September 3. It is worth going
out of your way to see.
