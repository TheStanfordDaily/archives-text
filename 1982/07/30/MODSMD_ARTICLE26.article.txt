Lebanon cease-fire holds
Despite PLO mortar fire and a reported Israeli "starve
and parch" campaign against West Beirut, the U.S.-me
diated cease-fire held yesterday and presidential envoy
Philip Habib offered "positive new points" toward get
ting the guerrillas to leave their encircled stronghold.
Israel said Foreign Minister Yitzhak Shamir will leave
for Washington Sunday for possible talks with President
Ronald Reagan on Habib's initiative to get the Palestine
Liberation Organization out of Beirut.
The Arab League urged the PLO yesterday to leave
Beirut under a six-point program that also sought a with
drawal of Israeli forces, league Secretary-General Chadli
Klibi announced.
The plan, drafted during a two-day meeting in Jidda,
Saudi Arabia, called for an international peacekeeping
force to ensure the security of Beirut and its suburbs.
Klibi said the league's committee on Lebanon also"af
firmed the determination of the Arab states to pursue ac
tion for halting the Zionist (Israeli) aggression on Leba
non and end the tragedy of the Lebanese and Palestinian
peoples."
A spokesman at the PLO information office in Beirut
said the organization had "nothing officially" byway of
reaction to Klibi's announcement.
Senate rejects balanced budget bill
Washington The Senate yesterday rejected 59-39 an
attempt to shield the Social Security program and its 36
million pensioners from a proposed constitutional
amendment barring deficit federal spending.
Critics of the amendment, led by Sen. Daniel
Moynihan (D-N.Y.) said the first target for spending cuts
is certain to be the $l7O billion in annual retirement ben
efits.
"We would have no choice, save disbanding the
armed forces," Moynihan said. "It would be the ineluc
table (certain) result of this amendment."
Sen. Strom Thurmond (R-S.C.) chairman of the Senate
Judiciary Committee, said the constitutional amend
ment is not intended to either protect or reduce the size
of any specific federal spending program.
"It does not include or exclude anything," said
Thurmond. "That's the way it ought to be."
Only when the amendment is in place, said
Thurmond, should Congress begin deciding on what
taxes should be raised or which programs should be cut.
During yesterday's Senate debate, Moynihan said the
amendment would pass only because it is the politically
safe thing to do in an election year when the federal defi
cit is above $lOO billion.
If the vote were by secret ballot, he said, it would fail to
get a majority, let alone the required two-thirds.
"Tampering with the Constitution for purposes of
winning the mid-term election is not worthy of the
world's oldest constitutional republic," he said.
One after another, the Senate has been defeating
changes proposed by opponents to the amendment,
which, if enacted by the Congress, and ratified by the
states, would likely take hold in 1986 or 1987.
Pipeline tech ban strains NATO
Washington British Foreign Secretary Francis Pym,
after a two-hour visit here yesterday with U.S. Secretary
of State George Shultz, joined a widening circle of allied
officials who are trying to patch up one of the most seri
ous ruptures between the United States and its West Eu
ropean allies in the 33-year history of the North Atlantic
alliance.
The rupture has been caused by President Ronald Rea
gan's decision on June 18 to ban the use of American

deveoped technology, including equipment produced
under license abroad, for a Soviet natural gas pipeline to
Western Europe.
That decision is being defied by the French and Italians
and is strongly objected to by the West Germans and Brit
ish, who all say the pipeline will be built anyway.
This has elevated emotions on both sides of the Atlan
tic to a point where some officials here felt they were get
ting out of hand. A few days ago, one White House of
ficial said the feelings of indignation and betrayal on
both sides threatened to unravel the alliance. "The effort
now is to put a cap on the acrimony," one official said.
In recent days, however, officials now suggest, there
has been a conscious effort to calm things down and not
to let the pipeline issue do more damage to NATO than it
does to Moscow.
On a visit to the United States last week, West German
Chancellor Helmut Schmidt first told interviewers that
his country will undoubtedly follow the French lead and
help build the pipeline. But later in the week, he referred
to the overall situation as "some family problems" within
an alliance of friends. "We are going to overcome
them," he said, so "please don't let us overdramatize the
whole affair."
At his press conference Wednesday night, President
Reagan repeated Schmidt's comments about a feud
within the family. "But the family is still a family," he said.
"And we know that we're bound together... in a great
many ways," he said.
Reagan urges state abortion laws
Washington Declaring that the time has come to
stop "imposing" on the Constitution, the Reagan admin
istration yesterday urged the Supreme Court to leave it
up to state legislatures to decide most abortion ques
tions.
Solicitor General Rex Lee took the position in volun
teering the federal government's view in cases from Mis
souri and Akron, Ohio, that raise questions about how
far state and local governments may go in seeking to limit
abortions.
"While the United States has no particularized interest
in addressing the merits of the actual legislative choices
made by the state of Missouri and the city of Akron, it
does have a substantial interest in preserving the proper
sphere of legislative action," Lee said in a friend-of-the
court brief.
The outcome of the cases "will directly impact upon
the ability of this country's elected representatives
both state and federal to deal with an important issue
of continuing public debate," Lee said.
The brief marked the first time the Justice Department
has taken a position on a Supreme Court abortion case in
which the federal government was not a party and no
federal law was involved.
Arthur Brill, a Justice Department spokesman, said Lee
had discussed his position with Attorney General Wil
liam French Smith and Deputy Attorney General Edward
Schmults, who in turn consulted with White House of
ficials, including Fred Fielding, counsel to the president.
Smith made "some minor suggestions," but the "tone,
flavor, policy and style" of the stance taken by Lee was
not changed, Brill said. He said the White House agreed
with Lee's position.
Quake ripples through LA
Los Angeles A small earthquake rippled through
oceanside communities at 10:50 p.m. Wednesday, seis
mological officials said. It prompted numerous calls to
police but no reports of damage or injuries.
The temblor measured 3.5 on the Richter scale and was
centered in the ocean 10 miles southwest of Santa

Monica, due west of downtown Los Angeles, according
to the California Institute of Technology in Pasadena.
"We got a bunch of calls from people wondering what
was going on and felt a small jolt to the desk here, but
that's about it," Los Angeles County Sheriff's Deputy
Jake Young said from the substation at Malibu, 15 miles
up the coast from Santa Monica.
Santa Monica police also reported a handful of calls.
The Richter scale measures ground motion in an
earthquake, with every increase of one number repre
senting a tenfold increase in magnitude. A temblor
measuring 3.5 can do moderate damage.
Pathologists lobby for funds
Washington Three years ago, when the Senate Fi
nance Committee was trying to limit the growing cost of
hospital laboratory services to the Medicare program,
four members of the Kansas Society of Pathologists paid
a visit to Sen. Robert Dole (R-Kan).
Congress has never placed limits on what the Medi
care program paid hospital pathologists the specialists
who analyze blood and tissue samples for telltale signs of
disease and these doctors were determined to keep it
that way.
"The lobbying got to be pretty heated," Dole recalled.
"They were bringing people back here from my state.
They really got their juices flowing. It was difficult to re
sist." Dole agreed to a watered-down version of the bill
that would make less severe cuts in pathologists' com
pensation, but the effort later died in a House-Senate
conference.
But Dole gradually changed his mind. He became an
noyed when rural pathologists testified that they needed
high salaries to pay for the private jets they use to fly from
one hospital to another. So when the Senate approved a
package of domestic spending cuts last week, the meas
ure included a proposal by Dole to cut Medicare reim
bursements for laboratory and X-ray services by more
than $220 million a year.
"When we're taking pennies away from school
lunches and Medicaid patients, we've got to be willing to
do it to people at the upper end of the scale," said Dole,
who became chairman of the Finance Committee last
year when the Republicans took control of the Senate.
"Everyone else is tightening their belts. We can't veer off
course every time another special-interest group comes
to town."
Like dairy farmers, used-car dealers and a host of other
industry groups, the nation's 16,000 pathologists have
long used an aggressive mixture of fund-raising, lobby
ing and litigation to preserve the federal rules that help
boost their compensation. Now, however, even some of
their onetime supporters believe that Medicare, the fed
eral health care program for the elderly, has been too
generous in the way it compensates pathologists.
Federal officials estimate that the average full-time
compensation for pathologists rose from $66,200 a year
in 1972 to $170,000 in 1978. But Dr. Jerald Schenken, a top
officer in the College of American Pathology, insists
there is no evidence that pathologists are abusing the
Medicare program.
"I don't think it's appropriate to set (income) levels for
anyone," said Schenken, who uses a chartered jet to visit
14 hospitals in Nebraska, lowa and Missouri. "What has
to be evaluated is what patients are getting for their
money.
