# Univ. shows investment loss
## 
### Marc Schwarz 
The University posted a 1.4 percent inflation
adjusted loss in capital gains for fiscal year 1981.
Traditionally, the school likes to maintain a
long-run growth in returns on investment of 5
percertt over the national inflation rate, which
for 1981 was approximately 9 1 /2 percent.
According to the University Treasurer's Of
fice, this somewhat lackluster performance can
be traced to a number of factors, most notably
consistently sluggish markets, which them
selves were aggravated by increasing un
employment and a relatively low input from the
private sector.
The University's endowments total some $532
million, of which approximately 87 percent was
put into domestic investments and bonds for
the 1981 period. The rest of the endowment is
invested as follows: 7 percent in real estate, 2
percent real estate debt, 2 percent in small
equities and 2 percent in venture capital.
In the wake of recent events, Rod Adams, di
rector of investments and University treasurer,
remains optimistic about the direction the
school is taking with regard to eventual long
term growth. "Our portfolio position tends to
be more in a defensive type of stance. We ex
pect that there are going to be times when the
markets are going to go down, but not as much
. . . Yes, the value of the endowment has gone
down with the market decline, but our plan
ning, our simulations, our experience is consis
tent."
Historically, the Office of Investments tends
to engage in very little speculation. Instead, var
ious models are used to establish investment
targets. Generally, the office tries to strategical
ly leverage its investments within these ex
pected returns, according to the Treasury Of
fice.
Adams said, "We do not, in our office, do any

of the research to pick the stocks and bonds per
se ... we in fact do research to pick money mar
ket investments and short term fixed-income
securities. We rely on outside managers to man
age our stock and bond portfolios; they tend to
do a lot of research, and they share that with us,
so we don't have to duplicate much of that...
We do do research in the understanding of cap
ital markets, but we do not do any original type
of work, there just does not appear to be any
need to, in that there is so much of it being done
by others..."
No direct in-house research is done for the
purpose of developing either targets or long
term investment options. However, a dialogue
is kept between professors and the office. Once
these targets are developed, they and com
bined information are then presented to sever
al investment managers, whose job it is to syn
thesize a tactical short-term plan in relation to
the long range goals of the University. This pro
posal is then given to the board of trustees for
final approval and execution. The board is in
volved throughout the entire process, and will
often interface with the managers for various
reasons.
One of the major changes in thisyear'splan is
the move out of bonds, with a shift toward more
liquid equities and cash, according to Associate
Treasurer Guy Conver.
While at an absolute level the results appear
somewhat disappointing, on a comparative
level the University is in the upper-middle
bracket of universities with regards to invest
ments, said Conver.
According to Conver, last year's relative de
cline was not too surprising. University invest
ments appear strategically well positioned to
take advantage of any rebounds. In shifting
more towards equities,said Conver, future re
turns might change for the better.
