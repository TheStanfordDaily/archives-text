## Official media is silent Bangladesh hill tribes battle military government 
### Deutsche Presse-Agentur 
Dacca, Bangladesh After a six-month
lull in clashes between government
troops and tribal insurgents in Bang
ladesh's troubled southeastern territory,
the two sides are once again involved in
hostilities.
The military government, which after
coming to power in March sought to
quash the rebellion by tribal dissidents, is
now concerned about recent clashes be
tween border security forces and hostile
tribesmen.
The first news that the insurgency had

resumed came on June 25, when news
papers reported the death of at least nine
border security troops in an ambush deep
in the jungle about 75 miles from the
area's administrative headquarters.
Press reports also said that a tribal guer
rilla leader, Seneha Ranjan Chakma, and
his bodyguard were captured in another
encounter last month.
The official media is mostly silent on the
incidents in the hilly southeastern sector,
but sources here said that the new gov
ernment prefers to win over the tribal
people through a development package
for the region, instead of taking tougher

military action against the dissidents.
The head of the military government,
General Hussain Ershad, in his first tour of
the Chittagong hill tracts since assuming
power, told a group of tribal leaders Tues
day that he would allocate more govern
ment spending for the hill areas, which
are poorer than the rest of Bangladesh.
The trouble in the hills began seven
years ago when landless farmers from the
plains were resettled to the sparsely pop
ulated hills. The move was opposed by
some tribal leaders, who took to armed
confrontation with the government in the
dense jungle terrain bordering India and

Burma.
The former Bangladesh civilian govern
ment had often blamed India for supply
ing arms to the tribesmen and providing
sanctuary for the guerrillas. For its part,
India had denied such allegations and ac
cused Bangladesh of aiding rebels in the
hills.
The daily newspaper New Nation re
cently quoted a government official as
saying that Bangladesh objected to recent
allegations from India that armed rebels
creating trouble in India were coming
from Bangladesh.
