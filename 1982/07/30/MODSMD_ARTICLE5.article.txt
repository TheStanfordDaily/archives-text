# ZAPU accused in kidnapping
## 
### Washington Post 
Harare, Zimbabwe Prime Minister Robert
Mugabe yesterday accused the party of his politi
cal rival Joshua Nkomo of responsibility for the
kidnapping of six foreign tourists and warned the
party leaders that they would be in "serious
jeopardy" unless they "desist from their clan
destine organization of banditry."
"The swords are drawn and it will be a luta con
tinua to the finish," Mugabe told Parliament, using
a Portuguese-language revolutionary cry meaning
"constant battle." "I appeal to the leadership (of
ZAPU) to do all it can to retrieve the hostages." As
semblyman Nkomo sat silently nearby as Mugabe
spoke.
A task force of more than 1500 troops and police
have been unable to track down the kidnappers

and their hostages, including two Americans, cap
tured last Friday. The dissidents have threatened to
start killing the hostages today unless the govern
ment releases from prison key Nkomo supporters,
ceases attacks on the party and returns its con
fiscated properties.
Another incident, on Sunday, put in doubt the
government's ability to maintain security when a
mysterious attack on the key Thornhill Base in the
Center of the country destroyed a quarter of Zim
babwe's air force planes. Eleven men, most of
them whites, were detained Wednesday in con
nection with the attack on the base, informed
sources said.
Mugabe, in his parliamentary speech, made his
harshest attack on Nkomo's Zimbabwe African
People's Union (ZAPU) party since he fired his
former partner from the Cabinet in February.
