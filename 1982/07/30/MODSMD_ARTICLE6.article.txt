# Defense minister interviewed
## Nicaragua will acquire MiGs and Mirages 
### Washington Post 
Managua, Nicaragua As the
threat of a serious confrontation
with neighboring Honduras
grows amid border skirmishes, a
rising body count and increas
ingly bellicose rhetoric, the rev
olutionary government here is
pushing ahead with plans to ac
quire Soviet MiG, French Mirage
or other fighter-bomber aircraft,
Nicaraguan Defense Minister
Humberto Ortega said in an in
terview.
Ortega declined to specify the
exact model of the planes being
sought except to say they would
be used primarily as "intercep
tors" to engage other aircraft in
the event of an invasion.
The defense minister gave fig
ures ranging from eight to 15
fighters as the potential force
Nicaragua hopes to obtain in
Paris, Moscow and other coun
tries.
(A spokesman for the French

Embassy in Washington said
Wednesday that "no further
arms sales" to Nicaragua are
contemplated by his govern
ment.)
The possibility of bringing So
viet-made fighters into
Nicaragua was foreshadowed by
U.S. State Department allega
tions last year that Soviet Bloc
countries were training
Nicaraguan pilots and that sever
al military runways had been
lengthened to handle the rela
tively sophisticated MiG-21s.
The issue has been a major focus
of U.S. concern and of the grow
ing arms race in the region.
Ortega insisted that the air
planes, as well as Soviet-made
tanks acquired last year, are
needed strictly for defensive
purposes in a hostile environ
ment in which Nicaragua's Sand
inista leaders say they must equal
or surpass the combined
strength of all other regular Cen

tral American armies in order to
protect their leftist revolution.
The 35-year-old defense min
ister said the flight radius of the
planes being looked at is "very
limited."
"We're not going to bomb
Washington," he added with a
bit of a smile.
Many of Ortega's remarks
echoed statements this week by
other top Sandinista officials. He
said that the problems of conflict
and warfare rapidly spreading
through the area can be resolved
conclusively only through politi
cal dialogue.
"We always come back to a vi
cious circle," said Ortega, speak
ing specifically about the grow
ing tension with Honduras, "in
which the only way out is politi
cal."
Ortega set no timetable for
the arrival of the planes, saying
that would depend largely on
the development of a sufficient
infrastructure to handle them,

including additional training of
pilots.
Ortega said that West Germa
ny, Italy and other Western and
Eastern European countries have
been approached as sources of
arms and aircraft. He said his
government is working hard to
strike a deal with France for the
acquisition of Mirage fighters,
possibly to operate in an air
force that also included MiGs.
Ortega and other Sandinista

leaders repeatedly make the
point that whatever arms they
receive must be on concessional
terms. With the exception of two
French Alouette helicopters that
arrived here a few weeks ago as
part of a $l7 million French arms
package, most of the arms ac
quired by the Nicaraguans in the
last two years were manufac
tured in Soviet Bloc countries
and obtained directly or through
third parties such as Algeria.
