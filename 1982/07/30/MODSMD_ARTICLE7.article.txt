# West Berlin in money trouble
## 
### Deutsche Presse-Agentur 
Berlin The West German government and the
West Berlin administration are quarreling over the
financial subsidies that bolster the city's sagging
economy.
The dispute follows the Bonn government's
plans to sharply cut certain subsidies to West Ber
lin.
West Germany at present spends close to $25
million a day to balance West Berlin's budget and
prevent a collapse of the city's economy.
This year the West German government will
transfer $4.34 billion to West Berlin to finance 54.4
percent of its public expenses. Bonn also is provid
ing $4.68 billion in other subsidies to the city, in
cluding tax allowances, wage bonuses and fees for
the use of roads leading from West Germany to
Berlin across East German territory.
The West German government intends to re
duce the flow of subsidies considerably in the com

ing year, seeking to cut its contributions to West
Berlin's budget from the present 54.4 percent to
52.1 percent by 1986.
Bonn's plans have drawn strong protests from
West Berlin, including one from Norbert Bluem,
the West Berlin Senator (Cabinet minister) in
charge of relations with West Germany. Bluem
said, "The Bonn government's unreasonable de
mands have hit Berliners like a stroke of lightning."
To which Bonn Finance Minister Manfred
Lahnstein replied: "Let's tell the Berlin loud
mouths: the finance minister cannot be black
mailed."
Observers said financial scandals, bankruptcies
of major building companies, speculation with
public money, prestigious economic projects eat
ing up millions of dollars and close ties between
some politicians and leading businessmen have all
been important factors in undermining West Ber
lin's subsidized economy.
