Missing facts bias article

In one of the cruelest
episodes to occur after World
War 11, anti-Semites spread the
word that the Holocaust had
never taken place. They claimed
that photographs of bodies
stacked like cordwood in the lib
erated death camps showed
"victims of typhoid." Now, in an
ironic reversal, apologists for Is
rael's invasion of Lebanon are at
tempting to minimize the civil
ian suffering caused by that op
eration.
When entire settlements are
obliterated by saturation bomb
ing, and the corpses shoved into
mass graves by bulldozers, surely
Israel did not "do its utmost to
avoid civilian casualties," as Jeff
Rosenschein said in his column
(Daily, July 27).
Rosenschein quoted David
Shipler of the New York Times as
saying, "It is clear to anyone who
has travelled in southern Leba
non that the original figures of
10,000 dead and 600,000
homeless . . . were extreme ex
aggerations." What Rosenschein
left out was Shipler's phrase,
"during the first week or the
war."
Shipler also wrote, in the same
article, "But the Israeli (casualty)
figures are misleading because
of what they exclude. They ig
nore West Beirut, which has
been pounded by air and artil
lery attacks. They ignore the
Palestinian refugee camps near
Tyre and Sidon, where very
heavy fighting occurred, and
where there is so much rubble
that bodies may still be buried."
Shipler added that "the destruc
tion is so extensive irr some of
the camps" that the Israeli army
was keeping correspondents
away.
In another column, Shipler
wrote that the Israeli army "had
left civilians on beaches for two

days without food and water,
and had later barred the United
Nations peacekeeping force
from continuing relief convoys."
David B. Ottoway of the Wash
ington Post reported "that shells
seemingly fired aimlessly from
warships into the (Beirut) city
center" smashed apartment
houses and killed a number of
children. So much for avoiding
civilian casualties.
According to Shulamit Aloni, a
member of the Israeli Knesset,
Israeli officials do not count
Palestinians among the civilian
dead. It is as if Palestinians are
not human beings, she said. As if
to illustrate her point, on June 22
a reporter asked an Israeli officer
why he was leveling to the
ground a refugee settlement
that still contained women and
children. "They are all ter
rorists," he replied.
To minimize the tragedy that
has overwhelmed Palestinian
and Lebanese victims of Israel's
assault is to collaborate with
those who, like the Israeli of
ficer, reduce helpless human
beings to objects so that they can
more easily be destroyed.

Ticket mopeds
Having just avoided an acci
dent with a moped driver next to
the Stanford Post Office, I feel it
is time to publicly express my
dissatisfaction with the use of
mopeds on campus. Although
the near-accident with the
speeding rider compelled me to
write, it is just one of many rea
sons to support efforts to ban
mopeds from Stanford:
•The vehicles are noisy. In the
past, the campus has enjoyed
peace from the sound of chug
ging pistons. Now, pedestrians
and bicyclists must endure the

crackle of moped engines. So
much for a quiet lunch on the
grass.
•The vehicles are fuel ineffi
cient. Moped owners are wast
ing non-renewable energy re
sources to propel themselves
around campus. Granted that bi
cycle seats aren't nearly as large
or cushioned, but these tradi
tional conveyances will go as far
as the operator desires with no
resulting offshore oil drilling.
•The vehicles are unsafe. They
are driven much faster than any
bicycle through crowded areas
with many blind access ways
(Tresidder-White Plaza areas es
pecially). In an accident with the
heavier vehicles, the (usually
helmetless) moped owner may
escape serious injury, but the
pedestrian or bicyclist involved
clearly won't be so lucky.
It is currently illegal to ride
mopeds on campus. I've even
seen one owner getting a ticket
near the Law School. While I ap
plaud the diligence of the Police
Department in that instance, I
believe it will take more: a Stan
ford Community consensus to
keep mopeds out!
