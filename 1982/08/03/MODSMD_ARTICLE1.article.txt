# Coyote Hill land use study stirs controversy
## 
### Mike Hale 
The question of open space
guarantees on University land,
an issue that has been gener
ating controversy for the past 20
years, was revived recently when
a University study onjhe future
of Coyote Hill met with a cooi re
ception before the Palo Alto
Planning Commission.

News Analysis

Commissioners' reactions to
the document ranged from "I'm
really surprised" to "It's not
quite what anybody had in
mind." Commissioner Ellen
Christensen appeared to sum up
the Commission's view when
she said, "The report doesn't
give a long-term plan for protec
ting Coyote Hill."
Palo Alto City Councilman
Gary Fazzino suggested last year
'hat the University Planning De
partment do the study of Coyote
Hill and two adjacent parcels of
land (known as Stanford North
and South) "to show how that
area could be protected." Ac
cording to University Director of
Planning Phillip Williams, the re
port was given to the Palo Alto
Planning Department staff a year
a go, but only reached the Plan
ning Commission last month.
That report was not a high
Priority for us, and not a high
Priority for city staff," said Wil
liams, "because there was no
Pressure on anybody's part for
any development in that area."
Williams feels the study finally
surfaced because Palo Alto is
currently updating its Com
prehensive Plan land use desig
nations and the Commission felt
the study would have a bearing
0n that issue.
Williams told the Daily, "the
re Port ... could not possibly
come to the conclusion that this
* as Permanent open space, just
7 very terms of our land en
dowment." He went on to say,
And everybody knows that, re
a"y- so the perception that this
r ®port was going to be magic
about open space was wishful
thinking."
Academic reserve
it Williams is probably right that
ev erybody" interested in land

use in this area knows what the
University's philosophy is. He
stated the policy as follows: "Mr.
Stanford's founding grant pre
scribed that the (University's)
land will be used for academic
purposes ... So there's a clear
priority in the University's land
use policy that any of the land is
to be held available for academic
use." This means that while open
space may be, in Williams'
words, the "second clear
choice" in Stanford's foothills
property, the University will not
declare any particular piece of
property permanent open
space.
This "academic reserve" poli
cy meets with varying degrees of
sympathy from interested
parties outside the University.
Palo Alto Planning Com
missioner Fred Nichols feels the
University is "caught in the
middle between academic and
scenic obligations," and said, "I
think Stanford is probably right"
in its decision not to designate
permanent open space in the
foothills.
City Councilman Fazzino, on
the other hand, charged that
"Stanford hides behind the
guise of academia like the Vat
ican hides behind the guise of re
ligion." Fazzino told the Daily,
"it was very clear that the Coun
cil wanted (permanent) open
space" on University land. He
said the Council felt there
should be "far more central
campus development."
Lennie Roberts, a former pres
ident of the Committee for
Green Foothills (CCF), a local
conservation/open space
group, stands somewhere be
tween these views. "There are
obviously lands that won't be
developed" because of their
natural features, or simply be
cause their value as open space is
so great, she told the Daily, but
added "there is quite a bit of
Stanford land that could be (of
ficially) preserved."
Williams is aware of all the
views present in the community,
and said, "You can appreciate
each viewpoint." He said the
University is "reluctant" to build
in the foothills and would always

first consider a central campus
site; but he added, "it's only
something that really needs to
be isolated that we would con
sider putting out there (in the
foothills)."
Coyote Hill
Coyote Hill, which sits just
south of the Stanford Industrial
Park near the corner of Foothill
Expressway and Page Mill Road,
has historically been a focus of
controversy. A 1973 CGF press
release called the hill and Stan
ford North South "some of the
last of the great heritage of the
midpeninsula, the gateway to
the foothills of the Santa CrQz
Mountains."
The Committee, formed by lo
cal conservationists in the early
'60s partly in response to the de
velopment of the Stanford In
dustrial Park, took action in 1969
when they felt this heritage was
being threatened. The CGF filed
suit in district court against the
University and the City of Palo
Alto over alleged illegal sub
division procedures in the
Coyote Hill area, effectively pre
venting the construction of a
Xerox Corp. research facility on
the hill. A settlement was
reached two and a half years lat
er which opened the way for
Xerox to build, but drew several

concessions from the corpo
ration and the University, the
most important being an agree
ment by the University to accept
51 and 20-year scenic restrictions
on most of the west side of the
hill (facing Page Mill Road) and
limits on the Xerox facility's
future expansion.
Arguments over the status of
this 10-year-old agreement are
what led to the University study
read by the Palo Alto Planning
Commission last month. Xerox
came to the city a year ago last
spring seeking approval for an
expansion of their facility which
was, according to Williams,
"completely within the agreed
upon limits." Williams went to
say, "At that time the CCF op
posed Xerox's application ..,
because they wanted to try to
leverage a revision" of the 51-
and 20-year scenic restrictions
into the settlement.
According to CGF member
Roberts, the Committee spoke
before the City Council in sup
port of Xerox's expansion, but
asked that approval be post
poned until negotiations could
be held with the University re
garding extensions of the scenic
restrictions. She said Xerox was
"very supportive" of the CGF's
efforts, and agreed to lobby the

University for the extensions.
In any case, the agreement
was not extended. "We stood
pat, and we think rightfully so,"
says Williams. As a compromise,
Fazzino suggested the study,
which was, according to Wil
liams, "a mechanism for getting
an agreement." The study has
now been presented and read by
the Planning Commission (the
City Council has not yet seen it),
and the stalemate between open
space advocates and the Univer
sity goes on. A suggestion that a
city Planning sub-committee be
formed to pursue the Coyote
Hill question was dropped when
Williams reiterated the Univer
sity's stand against a permanent
open space commitment.
Future hopes
Not everyone thinks there is a
stalemate. "I don't perceive that
there's a problem," said Com
missioner Nichols. "Stanford
and Palo Alto planners have had
a close discussion" of these mat
ters, he said, and the results have
been satisfactory.
Councilman Fazzino dis
agrees. "We want a specific pro
posal (regarding open space),
and we haven't seen that yet,"
he said. "Palo Alto has done so
much to preserve the visible

foothills and open space, and we
want to see Stanford do the
same."
Roberts believes there is ac
;ion conservationists can take,
iow and in the future. She said
he role of conservationists will
)e to "look into just what trade
jffs Stanford might make" in re
urn for development. For in

ipace agreements might be
Jrawn from the University as a
rade-off against the proposed
»6-acre housing development at
itanford West. Fazzino also
toted Stanford West as a pos
ible area for compromise.
Williams himself believes the
elationship as it exists will do.
'We always talk to environmen
alists. We are environmentalists,
ill of us, to one degree or anoth
!r," he said. "We think we're
aking the right steps to be fair to

Xerox to build, but drew several

concessions from the corpo
ration and the University, the
most important being an agree
ment by the University to accept
51 and 20-year scenic restrictions
on most of the west side of the
hill (facing Page Mill Road) and
limits on the Xerox facility's
future expansion.
Arguments over the status of
this 10-year-old agreement are
what led to the University study
read by the Palo Alto Planning
Commission last month. Xerox
came to the city a year ago last
spring seeking approval for an
expansion of their facility which
was, according to Williams,
"completely within the agreed
upon limits." Williams went to
say, "At that time the CCF op
posed Xerox's application ..,
because they wanted to try to
leverage a revision" of the 51-
and 20-year scenic restrictions
into the settlement.
According to CGF member
Roberts, the Committee spoke
before the City Council in sup
port of Xerox's expansion, but
asked that approval be post
poned until negotiations could
be held with the University re
garding extensions of the scenic
restrictions. She said Xerox was
"very supportive" of the CGF's
efforts, and agreed to lobby the

University for the extensions.
In any case, the agreement
was not extended. "We stood
pat, and we think rightfully so,"
says Williams. As a compromise,
Fazzino suggested the study,
which was, according to Wil
liams, "a mechanism for getting
an agreement." The study has
now been presented and read by
the Planning Commission (the
City Council has not yet seen it),
and the stalemate between open
space advocates and the Univer
sity goes on. A suggestion that a
city Planning sub-committee be
formed to pursue the Coyote
Hill question was dropped when
Williams reiterated the Univer
sity's stand against a permanent
open space commitment.
Future hopes
Not everyone thinks there is a
stalemate. "I don't perceive that
there's a problem," said Com
missioner Nichols. "Stanford
and Palo Alto planners have had
a close discussion" of these mat
ters, he said, and the results have
been satisfactory.
Councilman Fazzino dis

The question of open space
guarantees on University land,
an issue that has been gener
ating controversy for the past 20
years, was revived recently when
a University study onjhe future
of Coyote Hill met with a cooi re
ception before the Palo Alto
Planning Commission.

News Analysis

Commissioners' reactions to
the document ranged from "I'm
really surprised" to "It's not
quite what anybody had in
mind." Commissioner Ellen
Christensen appeared to sum up
the Commission's view when
she said, "The report doesn't
give a long-term plan for protec
ting Coyote Hill."
Palo Alto City Councilman
Gary Fazzino suggested last year
'hat the University Planning De
partment do the study of Coyote
Hill and two adjacent parcels of
land (known as Stanford North
and South) "to show how that
area could be protected." Ac
cording to University Director of
Planning Phillip Williams, the re
port was given to the Palo Alto
Planning Department staff a year
a go, but only reached the Plan
ning Commission last month.
That report was not a high
Priority for us, and not a high
Priority for city staff," said Wil
liams, "because there was no
Pressure on anybody's part for
any development in that area."
Williams feels the study finally
surfaced because Palo Alto is
currently updating its Com
prehensive Plan land use desig
nations and the Commission felt
the study would have a bearing
0n that issue.
Williams told the Daily, "the
re Port ... could not possibly
come to the conclusion that this
* as Permanent open space, just
7 very terms of our land en
dowment." He went on to say,
And everybody knows that, re
a"y- so the perception that this
r ®port was going to be magic
about open space was wishful
thinking."
Academic reserve
it Williams is probably right that
ev erybody" interested in land

use in this area knows what the
University's philosophy is. He
stated the policy as follows: "Mr.
Stanford's founding grant pre
scribed that the (University's)
land will be used for academic
purposes ... So there's a clear
priority in the University's land
use policy that any of the land is
to be held available for academic
use." This means that while open
space may be, in Williams'
words, the "second clear
choice" in Stanford's foothills
property, the University will not
declare any particular piece of
property permanent open
space.
This "academic reserve" poli
cy meets with varying degrees of
sympathy from interested
parties outside the University.
Palo Alto Planning Com
missioner Fred Nichols feels the
University is "caught in the
middle between academic and
scenic obligations," and said, "I
think Stanford is probably right"
in its decision not to designate
permanent open space in the
foothills.
City Councilman Fazzino, on
the other hand, charged that
"Stanford hides behind the
guise of academia like the Vat
ican hides behind the guise of re
ligion." Fazzino told the Daily,
"it was very clear that the Coun
cil wanted (permanent) open
space" on University land. He
said the Council felt there
should be "far more central
campus development."
Lennie Roberts, a former pres
ident of the Committee for
Green Foothills (CCF), a local
conservation/open space
group, stands somewhere be
tween these views. "There are
obviously lands that won't be
developed" because of their
natural features, or simply be
cause their value as open space is
so great, she told the Daily, but
added "there is quite a bit of
Stanford land that could be (of
ficially) preserved."
Williams is aware of all the
views present in the community,
and said, "You can appreciate
each viewpoint." He said the
University is "reluctant" to build
in the foothills and would always

first consider a central campus
site; but he added, "it's only
something that really needs to
be isolated that we would con
sider putting out there (in the
foothills)."
Coyote Hill
Coyote Hill, which sits just
south of the Stanford Industrial
Park near the corner of Foothill
Expressway and Page Mill Road,
has historically been a focus of
controversy. A 1973 CGF press
release called the hill and Stan
ford North South "some of the
last of the great heritage of the
midpeninsula, the gateway to
the foothills of the Santa CrQz
Mountains."
The Committee, formed by lo
cal conservationists in the early
'60s partly in response to the de
velopment of the Stanford In
dustrial Park, took action in 1969
when they felt this heritage was
being threatened. The CGF filed
suit in district court against the
University and the City of Palo
Alto over alleged illegal sub
division procedures in the
Coyote Hill area, effectively pre
venting the construction of a
Xerox Corp. research facility on
the hill. A settlement was
reached two and a half years lat
er which opened the way for
Xerox to build, but drew several

concessions from the corpo
ration and the University, the
most important being an agree
ment by the University to accept
51 and 20-year scenic restrictions
on most of the west side of the
hill (facing Page Mill Road) and
limits on the Xerox facility's
future expansion.
