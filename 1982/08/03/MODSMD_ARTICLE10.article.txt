## Israeli casualty figures also questionable 
### 
Jeff Rosenchein's editorial in
support of the Israeli invasion of
Lebanon (Daily, July 27) ad
vances as one of its principal
theses that the issue of war casu
alties has been grossly distorted.
Rosenchein certainly acknowl
edges that civilians in Lebanon
haev been killed, but curiously
decides that "the official Israeli
count" of casualties and refu
gees is the only believable set of
figures.
The Israeli army's claim is that
there have been approximately
300 civilian deaths and 20,000 left
homeless in southern Lebanon.
Meanwhile, according to Rosen
chein, "PLO propagandists, un
satisfied with these numbers,
have multiplied both the
homeless and the killed by a fac
tor of 30. The Palestinian Red
Crescent took a leadmg role in
spreading the wildly inflated fig
ures; this organization is, coin
cidentally, headed by the
brother of Yasser Arafat, PLO
chairman."
The Red Crescent collaborates
with the officially recognized
Lebanese Red Cross Society, an
affiliate of the international
League of Red Cross Societies, in
operating hospitals and other
health care facilities; hence, the

Red Crescent Society might be
expected to have some notion of
the extent of casualties — al
though political factors indicate
caution in accepting such fig
ures, of course. Rosenchein pre
fers to flatly reject the Red Cres
cent figures.
One might also note that the
International Committee of the
Red Cross — responsible for
seeing that protections of the
Geneva Convention are applied
to war prisoners and affected ci
vilians, and a sister organization
to the League — has generally
held the Red Crescent figures to
be more accurate than the Israeli
Army figures. Again, Rosen
chein has no comment orl this
matter.
An intriguing New York Times
report (July 19) comes from
David Shipler, whom Rosen
chein quoted as reporting on
July 15 that "the original Red
Crescent figures of 10,000 dead
and 600,000 homeless ... were
extreme exaggerations." Shipler
reports that "Israeli relief of
ficials" put the refugee figure at
60,000 to 70,000, far in excess of
the Israeli Army figures. (One
wonders whether Rosenchein
will now denounce these relief
officials as "PLO propagandists"

for deviating from the Army fig
ure.)
Shipler also notes that "the Is
raeli Army made the refugee
problem worse by deliberatly
creating additional refugees af
ter the end of the fighting. Dem
olition squads blew up shelters
in the camps, destroying houses
as well, and bulldozers knocked
down rows of homes that had
survived the battle." The Army
reasoning is that the refugee
camps are merely "terrorist"
haunts, hence merit destruction.
Because the PLO military is in
herently a guerrilla force, with
roots in the Palestinian com
munity, this rationale can — and
has — been applied to all Palesti
nian communities.
. As for the issue of whether the
Army figures are reliable, con
sider also this passage from
Shipler's report: "The Israeli
Army has made extraordinary ef
forts to keep the destruction out
of public view by refusing to take
visitors to the camps and trying
to keep journalists out." So
much for the free flow of in
formation. Rosenchein ap
parently has no use for Shipler's
report, which raises doubts
about the accuracy of the Army
figures, to put it mildly.
Rosenchein's column raises a
number of other issues. For ex
ample, there is the matter of
"recognition." Recent events in
volving Yasser Arafat and the in
famous "piece of paper" need
not be recounted here. It is cor
rect to say that the ideal goal of
the PLO is a change in Israel'ssta
tus "destruction," if one pre
fers — and replacement by an
other entity, namely, a secular
state, which Israel most em
phatically is not.
Nonetheless, it appears that a
substantial portion of the PLO,
which is hardly a monolithic or
ganization, would be glad to
have a mini-state in the West
Bank and Gaza. Such a state
would be economically depen
dent upon Israel and Jordan; it
would also, almost inevitably, be
politically dominated by the
PLO, which has become the ma
jor representative of Palestinian
nationalism. Israeli refusal to ac
cept this situation is akin to U.S.
refusal to recognize the ex
istence of China from roughly
1950 until Nixon's famous trip.
The war in Lebanon draws at
tention away from the events
taking place in the West Bank,
yet both appear to have the goal

of destroying the PLO as a politi
cal force. The dismissal of
elected Palestinian mayors and
town councils is well-known;
less publicized is the manner in
which Israel is applying the rule
of "divide and conquer." So
called Village Leagues — name
ly, bands of collaborators -
have been set up. The Leagues
are nominally "rural improve
ment groups," but "are allowed
to arm their members in self-de
fense .. . Any Arab caught carry
ing arms in any other circum
stance is in serious and some
times terminal trouble" (Christ
opher Hitchens, The Nation, July
24-31; see also the Christian Sci
ence Monitor, July 27).
Rosenchein's comment tha
the issue of the statusof the West
Bank and Gaza is merely that of«
"border conflict" between Israe
and the "Palestinian' state ol
Jordan is also quite revealing.
Rosenchein would abolish the
present Jordanian state, trans
ferring Palestinian refugees
there so that "they will finally
have the chance to return to
Palestine." The fact that these
refugees come from what is now
Israel or its occupied territories
seems to have escaped Rosen
schein's notice as he strains to
define "Palestine" in a truly re
vanchist fashion. Rosencheins
self-deception on this m 3ll ®'''
