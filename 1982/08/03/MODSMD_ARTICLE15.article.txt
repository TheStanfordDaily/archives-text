# Talks start in September
## Large arsenal cut proposed 
### Susan Owen 
SLAC Deputy Director Sidney Drell has come
up with a new proposal which would slash cur
rent American and Soviet nuclear arsenals by
up to a half. Philip Farley, a senior social science
research associate in the Provost's Office, has
joined Drell in expressing hope that the Reagan
administration will closely examine Drell's arms
control proposal for the Strategic Arms Reduc
tions Talks (START) which will reconvene this
September.
Drell and Farley also gave testimony at the
Arms Control Subcommittee of the Senate For
eign Relations Committee in San Francisco last
January.
Under Drell's plan, a reduction in current
American and Soviet nuclear arsenals would be
accomplished by creating a new numerical limit
on the number of warheads as well as the
number of missiles each side may deploy.
Farley said he could see no inconsistencies
between some recent statements by President
Ronald Reagan and Drell's proposal. Some of
Reagan's statements, he said, have put strong
emphasis on the importance of arms reductions
and have expressed the U.S. government's
commitment to working for progress at the ne
gotiating table. According to Farley, Reagan will
have to come up with a new approach after
roundly criticizing the provisions of SALT 11.
Drell's "ingenious proposition may be just what
he's looking for," Farley said.
The basis of Drell's proposal is a simple for
mula which limits and reduces the number of
warheads as well as the number of missiles to a
combined maximum of 8000. That limit would
be increased to 9000 if all intermediate as well as
intercontinental range missiles were included,
said Drell.
Currently, SALT II sets a ceiling only on the
numbers of missiles that each side can build,
said Drell. It sets only indirect limits on the
numbers of warheads each side may deploy by
limiting the numbers of warheads that can be
attached to each new type of missile (for exam
ple, 14 warheads per SLBM and 10 per ICBM).
This provision may even be viewed, said
Drell, as providing an incentive for developing
and deploying missiles which can carry multiple
warheads even though such missiles are viewed
by both sides as the most threatening to each
other's national security.
According to Drell, missiles which carry mul
tiple warheads move both sides closer to a pre

emptive first-strike capability, for they are
capable of destroying the opponent's land
based missiles in their silos. Thus numerical lim
its on missiles alone cannot provide an ade
quate basis for continuing successful nego
tiations, said Drell. Drell has therefore set a
direct limit on the number of warheads, as well
as missiles, that can be deployed.
The results of this new limit, said Drell, would
be to make missiles which carry multiple war
heads strategically "expensive" for "there is a
much smaller probability that all of a large
number of single warhead missiles will fail than
there is of one highly MIRV'd missile carrying
the same number of warheads." Drell said that
with the new limit, both the United States and
the Soviet Union would move away from the
current heavy reliance on missiles carrying mul
tiple warheads toward the deployment of more
single-warhead missiles.
According to Drell, both the United States
and the Soviet Union have "tended to come out
with some very different-appearing systems."
The United States has developed a more sea
based system and the Soviet Union a more land
based system, said Drell. "We must therefore
find some measure which doesn't force either
side into the other's mode/' he said. Drell be
lieves that his proposal provides this flexibility,
allowing each side "freedom to mix in accord
with its own technological and bureaucratic
needs while carrying out reductions to the
agreed quota."
The missile plus warhead quota of 8000 or less
for strategic systems, together with SALT II re
strictions on the modernization of land-based
ICBM's "is a simple and powerful combination
for effective arms control," said Drell. "Were
we to negotiate such a treaty — and soon — it
would be a major advance in arms control rela
tive to the painfully slow progress thus far/' he
said.
Thus far, said Drell, the lack of a strong public
constitutency is at least in part to blame for our
limited success in moving toward substantial
and balanced arms reductions. "There needs to
be a public constituency which is informed, not
necessarily to the point of technical expertise,
but which understands the basic issues, the
awesome meaning of 10,000 megatons and
what it would mean to survive a nuclear war,"
said Drell.
