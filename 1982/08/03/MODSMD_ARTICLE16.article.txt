# Alumni elect new trustees
## 
### Marc Schwarz 
About 16 percent of University
alumni, the largest turnout since
1976, voted in last week's trustee
election, electing four new
members to the University
Board of Trustees. The new
trustees will serve five-year
terms beginning in September,
according to Board President
William Kimball.
According to Robert Hamrdla,
assistant to University President
Donald Kennedy, the candidates
for the Board were selected by
an Alumni Association nomi
nating committee. An alumnus
may nominate himself or herself
by petition, but this did not oc
cur.
Elected members and as
sociate members have similar
privileges, said Hamrdla. "Once
they get on the board, everyone
works together," he said.
Nancy Ditz, assistant to the
president of the Alumni Associa
tion, said the Board includes 32
members, eight of whom are
elected alumni. Each member

now serves a five-year term.
Because terms were served
previously for four years, new
elections take place alternately
every two years and three years.
Four new board members will be
elected three years from now in
1985.
Only eight board members
are required to be University
alumni. But Ditz said, "Most of
them (the 32 members) are in
fact alums of the University."
The election was contested in
two categories: 35 years of age
and younger (won by Daniel
Brenner of Washington, D.C.
and Katherine Heard Handson
of Boston, Massachusetts) and 36
years and older (won by Martin
Anderson of Honolulu and John
Ditz of Atherton, California).
Ditz (class of '42) is president
of Foremost McKesson Property
Co. in San Francisco. He re
ceived about 51 percent of the
19,600 eligible ballots. In addi
tion to his post as a member of
Block Sand Stanford Associates,
he has served as past president of

the Stanford Buck Club and the
Stanford Athletic Board.
Anderson (class of '48, LLB '49)
is a practicing attorney and cattle
rancher. He is a partner of
Goodsill, Anderson and Quinn
in Honolulu. While attending
the University he served as stu
dent body president, and cap
tained the track team.
Hanson (class of '69) served as
an executive director of the
Consortium of Financing Higher
Education and has been active in
various volunteer posts
Brenner (BA, MA '73, JD '76) is
a legal assistant to the chairman
of the FCC and a former lecturer
in the communications depart
ment here.
The incoming trustees suc
ceeded four alumni whose terms
on the board expired this year:
Nelson Dong, Barbara Maxwell,
John Packard, and Phillip Taub
man.
This year's turnout reversed a
trend of decreasing partici
pation in the six prior elections
held since 1970.
