# Saturn's ring analyzed

Based on measurement of
radio signals made Nov. 13,
1980, from Voyager I, a re
search group here has con
cluded that most of the parti
cles forming Saturn's rings are
six to 13 feet in radius and ap
pear to be leftovers from the
formation of the solar system.
Previously scientists believed
that the rings were formed
from the shattered fragments
of some ancient moon.
According to Adjunct Elec
trical Engineering Prof. C.
Leonard Tyler, the Center for
Radar Astronomy has been
analyzing the data regarding
particle size for almost two
years.
The Radio Occultation Ex
periment, performed solely
by the group here, was con
ducted in conjuction with the
Voyager Project. The Center
for Radar Astronomy trans
mitted radio waves, which in
teracted with the ring parti
cles as they passed through
the rings. They were then re
ceived on the earth just out
side of Madrid, said Tyler.
Scientists have known for
decades that the particles are
chunks of ice. But the group
here is the first to discover the
relatively uniform size and
the round, smooth shape of
the blobs, he said.
According to Tyler, when
he started researching the
rings, estimates of particle
size ranged from the
thickness of a human hair to
five to 50 miles. But he said
analysis of Voyager I data in
dicates particles which

"range from the size of a 8.8.
to the size of a house."
He said, "There's a cut-off
in the sizes where we don't
see particles larger than 10
meters."
Tyler said scientists have
two major hypotheses as to
how the rings were formed.
The first hypothesis, ad
vocated by the group here,
says that size limit shows that
the particle rings "were
formed in place and always
there," said Tyler. "But there
will be a lot of disagreement
about this."
He said evidence indicates
that the particles were
formed at about the same
time as Saturn itself â€” about
four and a half billion years
ago.
According to the second
hypothesis, the chunks
formed as moons which were
shattered. They were trapped
in the orbits of ring particles
and ground down to create
Saturn's three rings.
But Tyler said that if the par
ticles had come from a moon
that was broken apart, the
group should have seen some
fragments in the one kilo
meter to 10 kilometer range.
"We're trying to under
stand the rings as a dvnamical
system," said Tyler. He called
Saturn "a working model that
mimics the way the solar sys
tem was formed in terms of
the gravitational processes
ft
The research will help sci
entists understand action in
the early stages of the solar
system, he said.
