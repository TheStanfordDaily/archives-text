# Simon trial nearing end
## 
### Jane Bailie 
Santa Clara â€” University graduate Robert Si
mon, on trial here for vehicular manslaughter and
drunk driving in connection with a campus auto
accident which occured last October, denied last
week that he was drunk at the time of the accident.
Simon maintained he was not drunk despite the
fact that his blood alcohol level was recorded as.lB
percent several hours after the accident. The legal
minimum for drunken driving is .10 percent.
In another development, Garret Shumway, a
classmate and friend of Simon's, broke a nine
month silence in regard to the accident to deny
that the reason he left Simon's Datsun 280ZX short
ly before the crash was that he was concerned
about the erratic nature of Simon's driving. He told
the court he had been having an argument with Si
mon at the time.
In his testimony, Simon acknowledged that he
did not remember any of the events which oc
cured immediately before the collision. He said he
recalled that MacMillan and Becker "were horsing
around" in the rear compartment at the back of
the car, and "at least twice" a hand reached for
ward to attempt to rewind the tape on the tape
deck. Simon said he pushed the hand away both
times, for fear that the tape might be ruined.
Soon after passing Palm Drive, Simon recalled "a

sharp blow to my upper arm and looking over my
right shoulder, and that's it."
According to the police report, approximately
300 vards past the Lomita Drive intersection Si
mon's car skidded 11 feet from the road, smashing
into an oak tree at what has been estimated to be
60 mph. The crush length of the front right portion
of the automobile was measured to be seven feet
four inches, a distance which police investigator
Tom Shelton described as "a severe crush."
The drag factor of Simon's car at the rime of im
pact was estimated to be .7 measures of gravity, a
C-force .1 higher than the standard .6 for a full
emergency stop (.82 is the force required to initiate
a locked-wheel skid.). Shelton said that Simon
could not have been traveling at less than 50 mph.
Shumway's version of the series of events lead
ing up to the fatal crash closely matched Simon's.
During a brief visit to the Oasis bar in Menlo
Park, he said, an argument broke out between he
and Simon which continued to escalate until the
car reached Campus and Palm Drive, at which
point Shumway left the car.
Shumway said that at no time did he believe Si
mon to be drunk or incapable of operating an au
tomobile.
Final arguments in the case will be delivered to
day.
