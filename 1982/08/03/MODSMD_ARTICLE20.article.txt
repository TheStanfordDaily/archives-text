## Atomic Cafe' only for the already converted 
### 
The Atomic Cafe is a true curio
• a montage of newsreel, army
aining and popular propagan
a footage tracing the develop
lent of atomic weapons from
ie flight of the Enola Gay over
iroshima in 1945 to the chilliest
jys of the Cold War in the mid-
Os. Some of it is horrifying, but
lost is foolish and risible, like

;ns on a test base cautioning
Idiers to discretion ("If You
ouldn't Tell Stalin, Don't Tell
nyone"), or a humorously ed
;d collection of educational
lots showing Americans in the
actice of "Duck and Cover,"
le recommended response to
udear attack. In one memo
ible clip, Richard Nixon, trying
ir diplomatic cool, flails hope
issly in conversaton with a
lissfully, hilariously arrogant
likita Kruschev, and in another
- a U.S. Army training short — a
haplain who talks so painfully

slowly that he sounds retarded
describes the glory of nuclear
explosion: "And then you look
up and you see the fireball as it
ascends up into the heavens. It's
a wonderful sight to behold."
Kevin Rafferty, Jayne Loader
and Pierce Rafferty must have as
sembled the film as a contribu
tion to the anti-nuke movement,

but most of it seems too remote
and naive to have any real politi
cal potency. Besides, the tone of
the movie, snide and super
cilious, may become uncom
fortable even if you share the
filmmakers' point of view.
Though they prepared no narra
tion, their attitude toward the
material comes glaringly
through in the editing and in
some of their choices. When we
get to the Rosenbergs' trial and
execution for espionage, for in
stance, the film suddenly be
comes maudlin: shots of fanat

ical marchers carrying placards
that demand instant death to
traitors are intercut with footage
of the Rosenburg children,
while Broadway-Jewish violin
music pumps mawkishly behind.
There is an absolutely gratuitous
clip of Nixon, grinning dumbly
as he rings the Liberty Bell to
herald the commencement of
Mental Health Week — isn't it
rather late in the day for Nixon
jokes, and would responsible
documentarians indulge in one?
Sometimes Loader and the Raf
fertys withhold information: we
see G.l.s dressed in everyday
army garb and perilously close to
a bomb testing site, then we are
not told whether the army's pre
sumed indifference to the men's
safety actually had any unhappy
consequences.
The film is maddeningly defi
cient in identifying data
throughout, so we don't usually
know what we're watching, or if
any two juxtaposed sequences
are in fact taken from the same
source. This is particularly trou
blesome when we see a "typi
cal" suburban family switch on
television or radio in their living
room and Truman's face or Ei
senhower's voice follows.
Where did this filler derive from,
and what is the point of includ
ing it? There is a prodigious
amount of footage of crew
cutted Americans in indist
inguishable parlors, and they
always seem to be under the
spell of TV hypnosis. You can
guess what the filmmakers are

up to even before they give
themselves away in the most of
fensive editing ploy in the
picutre: Eisenhower celebrates
the "intellectual strength" of the
nation while the film cuts to
shots of drive-in hamburger
joints and frozen TV dinners in
supermarket bins. Loader and
the Raffertys seem to be saying
that the path to nuclear holo
caust is being paved by blank
faced, ignorant middle-class
Americans with no taste, that the
ugliness of the suburban land
scape goes hand in hand with
the moral ugliness of its crass in
habitants. Is there still an au
dience for this kind of smug,
wholesale putdown of America?
I kept thinking of the 1975 Hearts
and Minds (an Oscar winner for
Best Documentary), in which a
touching eulogy by the father of
a young soldier dead in Vietnam
turned into a cheap joke when
he praised the continuing efforts
of Nixon's government to win
the war. The interview had taken
place in 1970 or '71, but the film
makers inserted it in their self
congratulatory post-Watergate
movie so that now there was vir
tually no one left in movie thea
ters who might applaud Nixon
(or the Vietnam War), even
those who had voted to keep
him in office three years earlier
could enjoy a derisive laugh at
the expense of the grieving
father. This sort of manipulation
makes me want to throw things
at the screen; at that point my
moral indignation outweighs my
political consciousness. A movie

like The Atomic Cafe or Hearts
and Minds assumes that we are
members of the same club as the
filmmakers and thus will accept
their most high-handed
judgments as our own truths.
You don't have to reside in the
right wing to balk at these films.
There is more than one kind of
moral ugliness.

- a U.S. Army training short — a
haplain who talks so painfully

slowly that he sounds retarded
describes the glory of nuclear
explosion: "And then you look
up and you see the fireball as it
ascends up into the heavens. It's
a wonderful sight to behold."
Kevin Rafferty, Jayne Loader
and Pierce Rafferty must have as
sembled the film as a contribu
tion to the anti-nuke movement,

but most of it seems too remote
and naive to have any real politi
cal potency. Besides, the tone of
the movie, snide and super
cilious, may become uncom
fortable even if you share the
filmmakers' point of view.
Though they prepared no narra
tion, their attitude toward the
material comes glaringly
through in the editing and in
some of their choices. When we
get to the Rosenbergs' trial and
execution for espionage, for in
stance, the film suddenly be
comes maudlin: shots of fanat

ical marchers carrying placards
that demand instant death to
traitors are intercut with footage
of the Rosenburg children,
while Broadway-Jewish violin
music pumps mawkishly behind.
There is an absolutely gratuitous
clip of Nixon, grinning dumbly
as he rings the Liberty Bell to
herald the commencement of
Mental Health Week — isn't it
rather late in the day for Nixon
jokes, and would responsible
documentarians indulge in one?
Sometimes Loader and the Raf
fertys withhold information: we
see G.l.s dressed in everyday
army garb and perilously close to
a bomb testing site, then we are
not told whether the army's pre
sumed indifference to the men's
safety actually had any unhappy
consequences.
The film is maddeningly defi
cient in identifying data
throughout, so we don't usually
know what we're watching, or if
any two juxtaposed sequences
are in fact taken from the same
source. This is particularly trou
blesome when we see a "typi
cal" suburban family switch on
television or radio in their living
room and Truman's face or Ei
senhower's voice follows.
Where did this filler derive from,
and what is the point of includ
ing it? There is a prodigious
amount of footage of crew
cutted Americans in indist
inguishable parlors, and they
always seem to be under the
spell of TV hypnosis. You can
guess what the filmmakers are

up to even before they give
themselves away in the most of
fensive editing ploy in the
picutre: Eisenhower celebrates
the "intellectual strength" of the
nation while the film cuts to
shots of drive-in hamburger
joints and frozen TV dinners in
supermarket bins. Loader and
the Raffertys seem to be saying
that the path to nuclear holo
caust is being paved by blank
faced, ignorant middle-class
Americans with no taste, that the
ugliness of the suburban land
scape goes hand in hand with
the moral ugliness of its crass in
habitants. Is there still an au
dience for this kind of smug,
wholesale putdown of America?
I kept thinking of the 1975 Hearts
and Minds (an Oscar winner for
Best Documentary), in which a
touching eulogy by the father of
a young soldier dead in Vietnam
turned into a cheap joke when
he praised the continuing efforts
of Nixon's government to win
the war. The interview had taken
place in 1970 or '71, but the film
makers inserted it in their self
congratulatory post-Watergate
movie so that now there was vir
tually no one left in movie thea
ters who might applaud Nixon
(or the Vietnam War), even
those who had voted to keep
him in office three years earlier
could enjoy a derisive laugh at
the expense of the grieving
father. This sort of manipulation
makes me want to throw things
at the screen; at that point my
moral indignation outweighs my
political consciousness. A movie

like The Atomic Cafe or Hearts
and Minds assumes that we are
members of the same club as the
filmmakers and thus will accept
their most high-handed
judgments as our own truths.
You don't have to reside in the
right wing to balk at these films.
There is more than one kind of
moral ugliness.
