Beirut shudders under 'cease-fire'
Beirut, Lebanon — The cease-fire in this embattled city
hung by a thread yesterday as the Israeli army moved ap
proximately 200 tanks up to the entrances into West
Beirut.
Technically, the reduced warfare could hardly be
called a cease-fire, since the distant thud of exploding
mortar shells could be heard beginning early in the day
from the southern outskirts of the city, where Israeli
forces were fortifying their positions at the airport taken
during a massive bombardment of the city Sunday.
The Israelis once again claimed that the bombardment
was in response to violations of the latest cease-fire,
which was imposed at 5 p.m. Sunday. But journalists
moving around the area saw no evidence that Palestinian
Liberation Organization forces were returning the Israeli
fire.
As the scores of Israeli tanks, some of them pulling ar
tillery pieces behind them, moved to the crossings at
Galerie Samaan and the Museum along the "green line"
separating East and West Beirut, the head of the Israeli
northern command issued a warning to West Beirut's ci
vilian population.
"Beirutis should leave before it is too late," Com
mander Amir Drori said. "We can do nothing for those
who remain."
Early in the morning, cars were lined up at the
Museum crossing as people began moving to the east
side of the city.
Those who did not leave went about recovering from
the thunderous shelling and bombing of the day before.
Lebanese police said the casualty toll in the 14 hours of
bombardment including 165 dead and 400 injured. It was
impossible to assess the damage to buildings.
Kenyan president quells coup
Nairobi, Kenya — President Daniel Arap Moi, who sur
vived a bloody weekend coup attempt, put the capital
under curfew yesterday and gave the remaining air force
rebels an extra 24 hours to surrender.
Sporadic resistance was reported at air force head
quarters at Embakasi near Nairobi, but a clergyman with
contacts at the base said loyal troops had secured the in
stallation. He said pro-government soldiers entered the
base pretending to join the rebels and then gunned
down the insurgents. He asked not to be identified for
reasons of personal safety and there was no official con
firmation of his account.
Junior air force officers launched the coup against
Moi's civilian government at 3 a.m. Sunday from Em
bakasi. More than 90 civilians and military personnel
were reported killed and hundreds were injured.
Police, soldiers and other troops continued searching
for rebels, some of whom were posing as civilians. Identi
fication papers were checked at roadblocks and auto
mobile trunks were searched. Some people were made
to kneel at gunpoint as their papers were checked by
members of the paramilitary General Service Unit.
Government radio stations, which resumed broad
casts yesterday, said Moi's cabinet met in emergency ses
sion at his official residence to "express satisfaction"
with the way the coup was suppressed and to reaffirm its
loyalty to the 58-year-old leader.
Britain defies pipeline embargo
London — Britain, joining France in open defiance of
President Ronald Reagan's embargo, announced yester
day that four British companies have been told to ignore
the "repugnant'' U.S. ban on supply of American-de
signed equipment for the Soviet gas pipeline.

Reagan imposed the embargo in June because of Sovi
et support for martial law in Poland.
British Trade Secretary Lord Cockfield told the House
of Lords in announcing Britain's decision that Prime Min
ister Margaret Thatcher's government had no wish to
"escalate" the dispute with Washington over equipment
for the 3600-mile Siberian pipeline. It is scheduled to
start bringing natural gas to Western Europe in 1984.
Cockfield said, however, that Britain's interests must
be defended.
He said the four companies making pipeline equip
ment under U.S. license had entered into contracts
before the Reagan embargo, and he had instructed them
not to comply with the ban.
Cockfield said he was acting under Britain's Protection
of Trading Interests Act.
Britain signaled its intentions on the pipeline a week
ago when Cockfield said the Reagan embargo was
"wrong and unprincipled."
About 20 West European firms have contracts to pro
vide equipment for the pipeline.
The Sunday Times of London, foreseeing Cockfield's
action, said it could start a trans-Atlantic trade war in
which the United States may refuse access to its technol
ogy, or impose financial penalties on British companies.
Salvador certification challenged
Washington — A spokesman for El Salvador's leftist in
surgents yesterday challenged the Reagan adminis
tration's certification of Salvadoran progress in land re
form and human rights as justification for continued U.S.
aid to the Central American nation.
Ruben Zamora of the Farabundo Marti National Liber
ation Front-Revolutionary Democratic Front said at a
news conference that since El Salvador's March elections
were won by political parties on the far right, land reform
has been dealt a "series of mortal blows."
The first of these, he said, was the appointment of fol
lowers of Roberto D'Aubuisson — head of the right wing
Arena party and president of the new Constituent As
sembly — to the key Cabinet posts of agriculture, eco
nomics and foreign trade. Next, the 1962 constitution
was reinstated, which, Zamora said, removed the right to
expropriate privately held land.
"The most recent blow has been the suspension for
one crop year — one to four calendar years — of Decree
207," Zamora said. This decree enabled small farmers to
buy the land they cultivated and the program has been
effectively halted, he said.
Zamora criticized the administration's certification last
week of progress toward representative government
and the safeguarding of human rights in El Salvador. He
said the Salvadoran military holds power by "repression
and murder" and "is not about to allow the erosion of its
base of power."
Zamora scoffed at testimony by U.S. Deputy Assistant
Secretary of Defense Nestor Sanchez, who told the
House Committee on International Affairs last week that
U.S.-trained troops are turning the tide for the eovern
ment.
Sanchez testified that the Belloso battalion, which re
ceived three months of training at Fort Bragg, N.C., suf
fered almost no casualties in retaking the rebel-held
town of Perquin in Morazan province. Zamora said that
government soldiers suffered many casualties and he
said an officer, identified only as Lt. Rosales, had been
captured by the rebels.
Reagan tries to placate farmers
Des Moines, lowa - President Ronald Reagan, trying
to mend political fences in the Midwest, assured farmers

yesterday that they should be able to sell large amoun
of grain to the Soviet Union next year even though h
has ruled out a long-term agreement for now.
Reagan set the tone for his speech to the 25th annu,
convention of the National Corn Growers Associate
by declaring at the outset that "the farmers of Americ
are very much on my mind."
The forum he chose and the tenor of his remarks wei
a marked departure from a visit to Des Moines in Febri
ary in which he spoke exclusively about his federalisi
proposals — never mentioning farms.
That earlier omission — in a speech to the lowa legist
ture — raised the ire of many local Republican leader
who also were concerned that he met on that trip on
with people who paid $1000 to have breakfast with hirr
This time he was meeting with lowa Farm Bureauo
ficials and planned to visit a nearby farm for an inform
chat with area farmers.
In his prepared speech, Reagan said that under a one
year grain sale extension "we are now exploring, wewi
be able to sell large quantities during the next year. I
other words, the granary door is open and the exchang
will be cash on the barrelhead."
His remarks came three days after Reagan reaffirme
his decision to forgo any long-term grain agreemer
with the Soviets until there is further relaxation of Sovie
assisted martial law in Poland.
Defending that decision,
Reagan's grain decisions have received a lukewarmr<
action in the Midwest where farmers are reeling froi
low prices brought on by bountiful crops and high ir
terest rates.
EPA toughens lead standards
Washington — In the face of intense protests, the En
vironmental Protection Agency apparently has donea
about-face on the issue of lead standards for gasolin
and is preparing to toughen, rather than relax, the r<
strictions on leaded gas.
EPA sources predict that the new proposal will reduc
the amount of lead in the air by 31 percent more thanth
current standards would over the next eight years.
"EPA has determined that rescinding or relaxingth
present lead standard would result in an increase in lea
emissions to the atmosphere" and that "environment
lead exposure continues to be a national health coi
cern," EPA explained in a notice scheduled to beprinte
in the Federal Register in the next several days.
An earlier agency proposal to relax the standard
made public in February, brought a storm of denuncii
tions from health-interest groups and environmentalist
Lead, long known to have adverse health effects, pa
ticularly on children, is added to gasoline to raise thea
tane level.
Under the current system, the average amount of lea
added to gasoline by large refiners must not be moi
than 0.5 gram per gallon (gpg) of all gasoline (leaded an
unleaded) they produce. For small refiners the liffl
ranges from 0.8 to 2.65 gpg, depending on the size of th
operation.
This system allows a refiner to increase the amount!
lead it adds to its leaded gasoline each time it increases!
volume of unleaded gasoline. Recent studies indicat
that the overall amount of lead in gasoline has been ri
ing, due in part to this system.
