# Injury averted in lab explosion

A Chemical Engineering laboratory assistant es
caped injury in the explosion of a high-pressure
vessel at the Stauffer Chemical Engineering Build
ing early last Friday morning because he had left
the room to work in an adjacent laboratory.
Robert Beth, University director of risk man
agement, said that Laboratory Assistant Stefan
Ebner would have been hurt "if he had been in the
room."
No one was injured and there was no chemical
contamination of the building, according to Beth.
The explosion broke a water pipe in the room
and caused "a lot of splattering on the walls and
ceiling," Beth said. He estimated the damage,
caused mainly by water flooding the room, at
about $2500.
Associate Chemical Engineering Prof. Curtis
Frank said students had been verbally instructed to
do no syntheses at night. The vessel exploded
around 2:30 a.m.
Frank said a "breakdown of communication" re

garding laboratory safety procedures had occured.
Laboratory rules will "certainly be clarified," Frank
added.
The vessel exploded because "it was filled with
too much liquid at low temperatures, and there
was no room for vapor" as the vessel was heated,
Frank said.
When asked if disciplinary action was being con
sidered, Beth replied that Ebner is writing a report
about the explosion, and that Frank will also write a
report once Ebner's report is finished.
Frank said the explosion was caused "more by
carelessness" than by other factors. "Certainly
there was no willful action taken," he said.
Damage to lab equipment was "very low, about
$600," Frank said. The cost of cleaning the labora
tory has not been determined yet, he added.
Ebner had been synthesizing fluoropolymers
when the apparatus exploded.
"It was not a new procedure," Frank said. "We
have done similar syntheses over the past four
years."
