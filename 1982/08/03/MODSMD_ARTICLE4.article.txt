## Accent on the economy Reagan's plan: neither money nor energy saving 
### Washington Post 
Washington — The General
Accounting Office, in a report
highly critical of President
Ronald Reagan's plan to
abolish the Department of
Energy, says a four-month
study turned up no evidence to
support the administration's
claim that the action would
save more than $400 million a
year — or any lesser sum.
In fact, the GAO says, the ad
ministration has failed to take
into account "numerous" ex
penses that shifting most of
DOE's functions to the Com
merce Department would in
volve and has "not performed
the detailed planning neces
sary" to effect a major re

organization efficiently.
The report, scheduled to be
made public this week, seems
likely to doom any lingering
hope of the Reagan adminis
tration to get legislation to
abolish the Energy Department
enacted in this session of Con
gress.
Introduced in the Senate two
months ago, the adminis
tration's plan ran into reactions
ranging from skepticism to
outright hostility at the only
hearing held. The White House
has yet to find a sponsor to in
troduce the bill in the House.
In recent months the admin
istration has variously claimed
that the reorganization would
save $1.3 billion, $1 billion and

$250 million over three years.
But the GAO, in its report, said
it found that "sufficient evi
dence has not been de
veloped" by the administration
to support any of the savings
estimates.
The GAO said that when it
reviewed the figures with ad
ministration officials, they
agreed most of the envisaged

reductions in personnel were
"primarily related" to cutbacks
in federal energy programs and
were not linked to the pro
posed reorganization.
As to claimed efficiencies
from merging the operations
of the two Cabinet depart
ments, the GAO said Com
merce Department officials
"had no specific explanation"

of what types of automated sys
tems could be merged to pro
duce the $200 million savings
cited by the administration.
In fact, the GAO concluded,
"to the extent that it would be
necessary to integrate systems,
the difficulties of combining
Energy's systems with those of
Commerce would likely be
substantial."
