# Jobs: most pressing issue
## 
### 
Los Angeles (AP) â€” Blacks face "a future of per
manent depression" without a jobs program to
whittle down their 20 percent unemployment rate,
the head of the National Urban League said Sun
day.
"The single most pressing issue facing black
people is jobs," league president John Jacob said.
"Not only jobs to bring down a black unemploy
ment rate of about 20 percent, but also jobs for the
future."
At a news conference preceding the opening of
the league's four-day annual conference Sunday
night, Jacob called for a $100 billion "Universal Em
ployment and Training System" rivaling the
Marshall Plan, which rebuilt Europe after World
War 11.

"We face a future of permanent depression"
without a jobs program, said Jacob, who took over
as league president in January.
He noted that black unemployment is more than
double that for whites and the highest since World
War H.
He gave no specific cost estimate, but said the
program would compare to the Marshall Plan'sex
penditures of almost 4 percent of the gross na
tional product, or $100 billion by current stan
dards.
Jacob said Americans might now be ready to pay
for such a plan.
"I think the public elected a tax-cutter (Presi
dent Reagan) before they realized what 10 million
unemployed people look like," he said.
