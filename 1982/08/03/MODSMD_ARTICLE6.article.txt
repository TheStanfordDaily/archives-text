# Bald ridge first Cabinet member to disclose:
## Next year federal deficit will be an extra $20 billion 
### Washington Post 
Washington â€” Commerce Secretary
Malcolm Baldrige said yesterday that next
year's federal deficit will be $20 bMlion to
$30 billion larger than the adminis
tration's midterm economic review
projected last week.
Baldrige became the first member of
the Reagan Cabinet to declare publicly
what many administration officials ac
knowledged privately when they issued
the midterm budget review, which
showed a $115 billion budget for fiscal
1983, beginning Oct. 1.
The Baldrige estimate would put the
deficit figure more in line with the $140
billion to $160 billion estimated by the

Congressional Budget Office and many
private forecasters.
In offering his own somewhat gloomier
view of the projections made in the mid
year economic review last Friday,
Baldrige said he was not trying to distance
himself from administration policy but
was simply stating obvious conclusions
about the state of the economy. He
pointed out that the mid-session review
was based on economic projections now
several months old.
The administration's official deficit esti
mates, made Friday, were based on an an
ticipated expansion in gross national
product of 4.5 percent during the second
half of this year. That growth rate is more

than either the CBO or many private
economists now expect.
Baldrige said he thinks the economy
will expand only at about 3 to 3.5 percent
in the last six months of this year, and as a
result the deficit will be $20 billion to $30
billion larger than projected. This is be
cause slower growth in the economy au
tomatically means lower tax collections
and more government spending on such
programs as unemployment compensa
tion and welfare.
High interest rates also add to the defi
cit because the Treasury must pay more
on the national debt.
Deficit spending forces the govern
ment to borrow more money in the credit

markets, which makes less available for
businesses and consumers to borrow and
forces interest rates upward.
"Without a decline in interest rates, we
will probably not have 4.5 percent (ex
pansion)," Baldrige said. "It looks now,
because interest rates have not come
down enough yet, unless they come
down dramatically, the figure of $20
billion or $30 billion is more in the
ballpark."
A senior administration official, who
briefed reporters on the mid-session re
view last week on condition that he not
be identified, also predicted that the 1983
deficit would be higher than the official
$115 billion projection.
