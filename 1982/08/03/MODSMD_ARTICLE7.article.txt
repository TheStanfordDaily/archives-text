# Major banks lower prime rate
## 
### 
New York (AP) — Virtually all of the nation's ma
jor banks cut their prime lending rates to 15 per
cent today to match the one-half percentage point
cut initiated by the Mellon Bank of Pittsburgh.
That put the the prime at its lowest level since
November 1980 and marked the second big prime
drop in a week. Several smaller banks began
matching the 15 percent rate after the large banks
made their announcements.
Among those joining the move today to a lower
prime were Citibank, the nation's second-largest;
No. 3 Chase Manhattan Bank; No. 4 Manufacturers
Hanover Trust Co.; No. 5 Morgan Guaranty Trust
Co.; No. 6 Chemical Bank; No. 9 First National
Bank of Chicago and No. 16 Irving Trust Co.

The drops reflected sharp declines in the banks'
costs of obtaining money for lending and invest
ment.
Norman Robertson, chief economist at Mellon,
said the prime raje could dip another full point
within the next few weeks.
"We feel strongly that by lowering the prime
lending rate we can make a contribution to the ec
onomic recovery process. Obviously, one of the
reasons that the economy has been so weak in re
cent months has been the persistence of very high
interest rates."
Mellon is ranked 15th among U.S. banks.
The prime is the rate banks charge their best cor
porate customers for loans.
