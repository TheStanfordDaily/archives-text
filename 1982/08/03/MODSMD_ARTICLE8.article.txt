## Viewpoint/Patricia Nabti Americans' silence on Lebanon crisis must end 
### 
Ever since World War 11, the
Western world has been re
minded that those who were si
lent in the face of Nazi atrocities
bear some of the responsibility
for the holocaust against the
Jewish people. Silence was tan
tamount to acquiescence or
even consent. But guilt and a
wish to compensate the victims
and survivors of that holocaust
cannot justify silence in the face
of today's holocaust in Lebanon.
Only 10 days after Israeli
forces invaded Lebanon 200 Is
raeli reservists printed an ad
vertisement in the Israeli news
paper Ha'aretz (July 16), declar
ing: "We officers and soldiers in
the reserves, ask you not to send
us to Lebanon — because we
cannot stand it anymore! We
have killed too many and too
many of us have been killed. We
have conquered too much,
bombed too much and de
stroyed too much."
Another group of 92 Israeli re
servists charged that they "were
used cynically as a tool to
achieve objectives that were to
tally at odds with the stated ob
jective of this war, as stated by
Menachem Begin in the Knesset.
Their objectives were achieved
at the expense of human lives
and with total disregard for hu
man values."
A Canadian surgeon, Dr. Chris
Giannou, who was in charge of
the Sidon hospital during the Is
raeli invasion, spoke in San Fran
cisco July 24. He charged the Is
raelis with direct bombings of
hospitals; of imprisoning
surgeons, doctors, nurses and
hospital staff desperately
needed for care for the
wounded. He charged that while
he was detained he saw pris
oners being taunted and beaten
constantly — some beaten to
death.
Evidence of Israeli obstruction
of relief operations in southern
Lebanon has come from many
sources. World Vision, which has
organized relief efforts in many
parts of the world has joined ef
forts in Lebanon. Its president,
Stan Mooneyham, declared that
"Israel refused all relief agencies
access to occupied areas for
more than 10 days of the worst
need when quick action could
have saved many lives. The Red
Cross ship SS Anton was refused
permission on security grounds
to land critically needed supplies
in Sidon two weeks after the in
vasion, although our people in
the city reported total security,
with people fishing from the
beach."
In a telegram to President
Ronald Reagan, Mooneyham
stated "Obstruction by Israelites
to the delivery of relief goods
and services is sadly in evidence
and is contrary to the principles
of the Geneva Convention."
Nothing can justify the direct
bombing of hospitals and ob
struction of relief operations,
the wanton destruction of prop
erty, the inhumane treatment of
those under detention, and
above all, the killing, wounding
and homelessness of countless
thousands of non-combatant
Palestinians and Lebanese.
Those who remain silent bear
such responsibility since it is
America that has provided much

of the military machinery, the fi
nancial aid, and the unques
tioned political support of Israel
that has made this all possible.
The destruction is going on
now, and so now is the time to
act. In a reaffirmation of our hu
manitarian values, we must write
to or call our political leaders
and congressional represent
atives. We must join with those
Israeli reservists who cried out
that Israel has "killed too many
. . . conquered too much,
bombed too much and de
stroyed too much ... we cannbt
stand it anymore!"
