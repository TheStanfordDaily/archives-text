### Jane Bailie 
Santa Clara — University graduate Robert Simon was
Dund guilty of two counts of misdemeanor vehicular
nanslaughter and one count of felony drunk driving
Vednesday by a six-man, six-woman jury in Santa Clara
lounty Superior Court here.
Simon was the driver in an auto accident on campus
ist October that resulted in the deaths of his passengers,
jniors Michael Becker and Kevin MacMillan.
Sentencing has been scheduled for Sept. 17.
The jury began deliberation on Tuesday, following
losing arguments. The 12 jurors took six hours to reach
heir verdict.
In his final argument, Defense Attorney William
Ceogh urged the jury to find his client innocent of all
harges. Keogh referred several times to the testimonies
>112 defense witnesses, the majority of them were personal
riends of Simon's, who said they thought Simon was
apable of operating his Datsun 280ZX the night of the
ccident.
Police tests showed that Simon's blood alcohol level
vas .18 percent one hour after the incident occurred. At
he moment of the collision medical experts estimated
lis blood alcohol level to be .20 or .21 percent — a level
vhich is double the legally recognized minimum of .10
>ercent for drunken driving.
Prosecuting Attorney Lane Liroff concentrated on Si

mon's high blood level, referring to several studies con
ducted on the effects of intoxicating beverages.
Keogh argued that levels of intoxication vary greatly
according to individual tolerance. He said that witnesses
who had seen Simon minutes before the collision oc
curred had testified that they had found Simon capable
of operating his Datsun 280ZX.
In reaching the misdemeanor manslaughter verdicts,
the jury found Simon to have acted without "gross negli
gence." Gross negligence is a legal definition meaning a
defendent is "wholly indifferent to the consequences of
his conduct."
The verdict fell short of the two felony manslaughter
charges initially brought against Simon by the prose
cution, but Liroff still claimed victory.
"I think the jury was quite satisfied that when you
drink excessive amounts of alcohol and strike your car
into a tree, that's not the type of activity that will be toler
ated," Liroff said.
Jury foreman Edward Craig said, "We felt that he had
exhibited care ... Not long before he had stuck around
and hauled his friends out of a bar when the police were
called. If he didn't give a damn, he would have just
driven off."
He added, "I didn't see any strong prejudices ... I
think some jurors (who) had had some empathy think,
'There but for the grace of God go I for my college

pranks.' "
Juror Nick Renna said, "We felt primarily that it wasn't
an intentional act... He didn't get into the situation with
the intent of harming anyone."
Simon, a former industrial engineering student, faces a
maximum sentence of three years in a state prison. Pres
ently, he is working on campus as a research assistant
while he is free on his own recognizance.
Becker, MacMillan, and Simon were fraternity
brothers in Theta Delta Chi. Simon was heading home to
the fraternity house at the time of the crash.
Court records show that the three men visited two bars
that evening. At the second pub, Encina Station, Becker
and MacMillan started a confrontation with some em
ployees over a beer. Employees testified that Simon was
instrumental in breaking up the fight, and that he
seemed coherent at the time.
There were no witnesses during the minutes before
the actual collision. But Simon told the court that Becker
and MacMillan were "horsing around" in the luggage
compartment of the car. He said that "at least twice" a
hand darted forward to rewind the Greg Kihn tape on
the tapedeck.
Simon added that the last incident he remembers
before being pried from his automobile by paramedics
was "a sharp blow to my upper arm and looking over my
right shoulder, and that's it."
