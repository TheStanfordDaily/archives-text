## Lebanon letters offer weak arguments 
### 
The reactions to my column in
last week's Daily (July 27) warrant
a response. It seems worthwhile
to examine the major points in
my article and see what the
counterarguments were. .
Israel has taken strong meas
ures to minimize civilian casual
ties.
Rachelle Marshall (Daily, July
30) tried to counter this claim,
but did not deny the well
documented facts: Israel
dropped leaflets and used
loudspeakers to warn civilians
away from areas of conflict, and
soldiers were ordered not to fire
until fired upon (New York
Times, July 15; Wall Street Jour
nal, July 21). These precautions
cost lives and limbs on the Israel
is' part.
Arab casualty figures in south
ern Lebanon have been wildly
exaggerated.
This point generated the most
response, but interestingly, no
one actually tried to defend the
Arab figures. Marshall tried
some creative editing, though.
She claimed to fill in a missing
New York Times quote, but ac
tually filled in only part, chang
ing the import of the whole sec

tion. The quote bears repetition,
in its entirety:
"It is clear to anyone who has
traveled in southern Lebanon, as
many journalists and relief work
ers now have, that the original
figures of 10,000 dead and
600,000 homeless, reported by
the Beirut representative of the
International Committee of the
Red Cross during the first week
of the war, were extreme exag
gerations." (New York Times,
July 15)
The Wall Street journal edito
rialized (July 21), "a review of the
fighting so far shows that initial
reports of heavy civilian casual
ties were greatly exaggerated."
The New Republic writes (Au
gust 2), "the numbers from
Beirut about the deaths in the
south also defy logic and ex
perience. ... It is by now certain
that the casualties reported out
of " southern Lebanon were
false." The citations go on and
on; my space, unfortunately,
does not.
Even the Red Cross officially
recanted those early figures:
"Franceso Noseda, head of the
Red Cross mission in Lebanon,
claimed that (on July 25) "we did
not mention here any figure ap
proaching 10,000 " He did say
that the only numbers the Red
Cross had provided were the
counts of 47 dead and 247
wounded in Tyre — and these
figures, interestingly, are lower
than those put out by Israeli au
thorities." (The New Republic,
August 2)
Since the original inflated fig
ures were a jumping off point for
subsequent estimates, their de
bunking is important. Joe
Walder's citing of Israeli reports
of 60,000 to 70,000 homeless
(Daily, 8/3) only emphasizes my
point: the original numbers
were wildly inflated.
Walder and Marshall did make
a valid observation, however: Is
raeli army figures should not be
accepted as gospel truth. I agree.
They obviously do not take into
account West Beirut, since Israel
has no means of obtaining ac
curate figures in that area.
Furthermore, various Israeli
groups, using different criteria,
have arrived at different num
bers of homeless. All these fig
ures, however, have been far, far
below the discredited Arab
ones.
There are two reasons why the
truth for southern Lebanon

probably lies close to the Israeli
figures. First, they were com
piled with the full cooperation
of Lebanese mayors and doctors,
who had access to the area in
question. Secondly, journalists
now move freely in all of south
ern Lebanon (including, for the
last couple weeks, Palestinian
refugee camps), and the Israeli
figures appear to be holding up.
In a statement Marshall curious
ly ignored from that New York
Times article, we read: "Dis
cussions with local officials and
residents tend to reinforce the
Israeli casualty estimates." (NYT,
July 15)
I am most definitely not trying
to minimize the suffering of in
nocents; I just don't think exag
geration of that suffering is justi
fied — or necessary. Most im
portantly, I'm afraid all this
macabre haggling over body
counts obscures more fun
damental issues in the conflict.
Nevertheless, these distorted
figures have been widely used to
attack Israel, and they have to be
addressed.
The PLO is committed to Is
rael's destruction.
No one disagreed with this
point. Walder, however, theo
rized (without citation) that a
"substantial portion" of the PLO
would be satisfied to have a
mini-state in the West Bank and
Gaza. The official PLO position
is, in fact, that they would be
happy to have such a mini-state
— as a first step towards the "lib
eration" of all of Palestine, i.e.,
present-day Israel and Jordan
(Palestine National Council Ten
Point Program, June 8,1974, Arti
cle^.
Eastern Palestine, i.e., Jordan,
should serve as the bulk of a
democratic Palestinian Arab
state.
Walder claims I have strained
to define Palestine as including
both Israel and Jordan; t must
admit I didn't have to strain very
hard, since Arafat, Hussein,
Habash, Begin and Sharon all
agree with that definition
("Palestine with its boundaries
that existed at the time of the
British Mandate is an indivisible
territorial unit," Palestinian Na
tional Covenant, Article 2).
The irony is noteworthy; I am
arguing for a large Palestinian
Arab state, and Walder would
prefer a tiny one, "economically
dependent upon Israel and Jor

dan" (his words). Is this a just
solution to the Palestinian Arab
desire for a homeland? Give
them a mini-state, hamstrung
politically, economically and
militarily, and with insufficient
room to absorb refugees?
Some people consider Jordan
to be the "Palestinian Arab
state" already, since it occupies
over three-quarters of Palestine
and a majority of its citizens are
Palestinian Arabs. But Jordan is
not such a state because the
Palestinian Arabs cannot control
their national destiny under Jor
dan's present regime. I shall
shed no tears if and when
Hussein's monarchy is replaced
by a democracy.
We have to broaden our
horizons to solve major his
torical problems; there is no ra
tional reason to stay fixated on
the West Bank as the only place
the Palestinian Arabs should be
granted self-determination.
Eastern Palestine should be up
permost in our minds as a way to
provide a credible homeland for
the Palestinian Arabs.
I must emphasize, nego
tiations would be held between
this Palestinian state and Israel
on the final disposition of the
West Bank and Gaza; personally,
I am in favor of Israel's nego
tiating away the bulk of these
territories. But this question
could be resolved peacefully, as
a border issue between two sov
ereign nations (security and de
mographicconcerns will certain
ly be taken into account by both
sides). Yes, refugees who had
fled from Israel might have to re
settle outside of Israel (though
still in Palestine), the way Jewish
refugees who fled Arab coun
tries had to resettle in Israel;
Walder might consider this an
unreasonable trade-off, but I do
not.
As these words are written,
events in West Beirut dwarf the
importance of our two-week old
debate. There has been a bloody
Arab-Israeli war going on, not
for the past two months, but for
the past 34 years. If Americans
are truly concerned about all the
deaths on both sides (as they
should be), they have to try and
understand the causes of con
flict, and the alternatives for its
resolution. Only then can move
ment towards peace be realized.
