# Fulbright scholar to study in Africa
## 
### Jane Bailie 
For many college students,
the thought of a Fulbright
Scholarship conjures up im
ages of closeted academics
studying in the scholastic at
mospheres of Oxford or the
Sorbonne. For Stanford
linguistics Ph.D. candidate
Paul Kozelka, the dream has
become reality, but with a dif
ference. Instead of studying
in a cloistered hall, Kozelka
will use his scholarship in a lit
tle-known area of south
western Africa, the nation of
Togo.
Kozelka's interest in
linguistics and the country of
Togo both developed when
he was stationed there in the
Peace Corps, from 1973 to
1978. He spent two years in
the North and three years in
the South, working as an
educational administrator
and English teacher.
A graduate of Penn State in
French and Portuguese,
Kozelka came to the Univer
sity in 1978 to begin work on
his Masters in linguistics. He
hopes to complete work on
his Ph.D. in December 1983.
"People were very recep
tive in spite of the growing
pains of a growing country,"
observed Kozelka. "They
manage to accept these pains
of a developing country with
humor and a large grain of
salt.
"They're a peaceful peo
ple. There are no handguns.
Yet they are not pas
sive,"Kozelka emphasized.

"They are really enthusiastic
about their socceer games.
They are very enjoyable."
Kozelka will spend nine
months in the southern capi
tal of Togo at the University of
Benin, researching the selec
tion and development of the
two recently chosen national
languages, Ewe, from the
North and Lome, from the
South. This will be a signifi
cant reduction from the ap
proximately 40 languages
which are presently spoken in
various regional areas of the
nation.
"People have accepted the
change," he said. "It is some
thing that will help preserve
the culture, especially the
oral literature. They under
stand the need and the
purpose.
"Languages are a some
what sensitive political sub
ject," continues Kozelka.
"Language is so much in
volved with culture."
Kozelka will be "interview
ing government officals and
working with language plan
ners to see how they make
decisions about the lan
guages, what their processes
are and how they evaluate
their programs."
Following his period of re
search in Togo, Kozelka
hopes to become involved in
"languageplanning.. .possi
bly diplomacy, on the in
ternational level. I'm not
fussy about where.
"I'm much more of an ap
plied person," explained
Kozelka.
