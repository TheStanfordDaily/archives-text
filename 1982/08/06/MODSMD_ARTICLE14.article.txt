# Gene-splicing patent delayed
## 
### 
The U.S. Patent Office delayed
issuing a genetic engineering
patent Wednesday to Stanford
and the University of California
because of questions over
whether the patent was "enabl
ing" â€” accurate and detailed
enough to permit other re
searchers to use the genetic en
gineering techniques described.
The patent covers the prod
ucts of basic gene splicing and
cloning methods invented by
Stanley Cohen, professor of ge
netics and medecme here, and
Herbert Boyer, professor of
biochemistry at the University of
California-San Francisco. An
earlier patent covering basic
techniques involved with the
process had been issued in De
cember 1980.
"In its action this week, the
Patent Office raises several ques
tions which must be addressed
before the patent can be issued,
but none of the issues seem to be
insurmountable problems," said
Niels Reimers, director of the
University's office of technology
licensing.
"It will be an even stronger
patent than before because
these issues will have been ad
dressed in the patent prose
cution process and will not have
been left open for speculation,"
he added.
The prosecution process sub
jects the patent to critical review,
challenging the applicant to
marshal explanations for pos
sible challenges to a patent, Re
imers said.
Normally the patent prose
cution is confidential until the
patent is issued. In this case the
University chose to open up the
process for public scrutiny to
ensure that all potential objec
tions might be raised.

The patent includes a descrip
tion of how a particular plasmid
(a circular form of DNA) was
formed during Cohen and
Boyer's original experiments.
However, later experiments by
Cohen showed that the in
terpretation detailed in the pat
ent was incorrect.
Reimers said that the descrip
tion was a tangential issue, since
the basic genetic engineering
process described in the patent
has been proven to work in labo
ratories throughout the world.
A second issue is that a DNA
process analogous to the one
described in the patent can oc
cur in nature under special cir
cumstances. However, Reimers
said scientists have pointed out
that the naturally occuring proc
ess happens too infrequently to
be useful for commercial gene
cloning.
Licenses are being granted by
Stanford and UC to industry on a
non-exclusive basis for reason
able royalties based on the gene
cloning techniques, Reimers

said.
Licenses issued so far to 73
firms have resulted in income to
the universities of about $1.4 mil
lion, Reimers said.
No products are commercially
available now, Reimers said, but.
insulin, a human growth
hormone, and a vaccine for
scours, a disease of swine, are ex
pected to be available by the end
of the year.
In the case of the recombinant
DNA method and product pat
ents, both Cohen and Boyer
have waived their right to per
sonal royalties from payments
accrued from licensing of the
patents.
Because bacteria theoretically
could be engineered to produce
almost anything created natural
ly by plant and animal cells, the
techniques developed by Cohen
and Boyer may have significant
applications in a wide range of
industries such as energy,
chemicals and agriculture.
