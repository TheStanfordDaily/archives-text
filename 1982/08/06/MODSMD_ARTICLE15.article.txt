# New Placement Center director appointed

Christopher Shinkman, direc
tor of career counseling at Trini
ty College in Hartford, Connect
icut, and founder of a noted fac
ulty career advisor system there,
has been named director of the
Career Planning and Placement
Center (CPPC).
Shinkman, who will take over
for current director Ralph
Keller, was appointed by Dean
of Student Affairs James Lyons.
The appointment will take effect
on Sept. 1.
Lyons called the new director
"an accomplished leader in his
field and an educator who is
committed to helping students
make informed choices about
their education and subsequent
careers."
No radical changes are pre
dicted for the center, according
to Shinkman. He said he wishes
to start off by "taking stock, look
ing around, and generally main
taining the fine job Ralph Keller
has done as director for the past
20 years."
Shinkman said he wants to
maintain an effective placement
program that serves seniors well
in on-campus recruiting, and to
provide students with helpful
job-search techniques.

Shinkman strongly em
phasized his desire to see
freshmen and sophomores in
the CPPC. Through internships
and summer jobs they can begin
early career planning, he said.
Although Shinkman's position is
managerial, he hopes to retain a
"counselor" attitude by having
direct contact with students.
He hopes to develop and
maintain a strong relationship
with the faculty by meeting as
many members of the staff as he
can early in the year and con
tinually keeping them aware of
CPPC affairs.
Shinkman has held his present
post for the past seven years.
Prior to that he served as assis
tant to the provost at Johns
Hopkins University from
1973-1975, and director of Ca
reer Planning and Placement for
the School of Industrial and La
bor Relations at Cornell Univer
sity from 1967-1973. He has also
had experience in admissions, fi
nancial aid, and placement at the
University of Pittsburgh and at
Westminster College in Pennsyl
vania.
In addition to his professional
experience in student affairs,
Shinkman is co-author of Career
Development in the 1980's: The

ory and Practice. The book is a
publication written partly by
practitioners and partly by lead
ing theorists such as John
Holland and John Krumboltz
(professor of education and psy
chology here). Shinkman wrote
a chapter dealing with career
planning in the early years, em
phasizing that underclassmen
can begin career planning soon
after entering college. The idea,
he said, is not to worry about
future plans but to gather in
formation about job op
portunities.
Shinkman has also done re
search on employment options
in the public and non-profit sec
tors. In 1981 he was appointed a
National Fellow of the Associa
tion of American Colleges.
Shinkman, his wife Marsha,
and their two children will move
here in September. Marsha
Shinkman, currently director of
public information for the Amer
ican School for the Deaf in Hart
ford, is searching for a job in
public information in this area,
possibly at the new Children's
Hospital at Stanford extension.
During a recent visit to cam
pus, Shinkman stated, "career
planning and placement is a par
ticularly important service at this

period in the history of Ameri
can higher education. Students
and their parents, faculty, and
administrators are all aware of
the need for effective service. I

look forward to the challenges
and opportunities I will en
counter as the director of the
Career Planning Center at Stan
ford."

ONE LESS JOB â€” Although there is one less job available in
the recession-ridden economy now that Christopher
Shinkman has been appointed head of the Career Planning
and Placement Center, perhaps Shinkman can pass on his
proven job-hunting techniques to students seeking employ
ment.
