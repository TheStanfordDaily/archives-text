## 'Annie' more like big-top than wide-screen 
### Steve Vineberg 
Annie is John Huston's first
musical in more than 40 years of
uninterrupted filmmaking —
and it's also, arguably, his worst
movie, even including such as
sorted duds as The Kremlin Let
ter and The Mackintosh Man.
His last film, Victory, set in a Ger
man POW camp during the Sec
ond World War, was pre
posterous (so implausible that,
as Rolling Stone critic Michael
Spragow put it, it might have
taken place in a parallel uni
verse) but Huston's professional
knowhow gave it such a charge
that it was extremely entertain
ing — high nonsense. That the
same man directed Annie, a
hopelessly inept musical com
edy circus in the Haifa Sixpence-
Hello, Dolly! league, seems un
likely. The project — a film ver
sion of Thomas Meehan's hit
Broadway show, based on
Harold Gray's comic strip Little
Orphan Annie — appears to
have defeated Huston: there are
chase sequences so blandly
staged and edited (by Margaret
Booth and Michael A.
Stevenson) that they lack sus
pense (one is shot almost entire
ly in close-up), unexplained fig
ures, illogical trailing bits of nar
rative.
I've never seen Annie on
stage, so I don't know if
Meehan's script is as poor as
Carol Sobieski's screenplay, but
the material is certainly colorful
enough to supply a rousing mov
ie musical. Set in the New York
of the Depression, it's predi
cated on a contrast between the
sleazy, run-down Hudson Street
Home for Girls, an orphanage
underthesupervisionof a randy,
alcoholic monster named Miss
Hannigan, and the estate of
billionaire Oliver "Daddy" War
bucks, where Little Orphan An
nie comes to live. This kind of
contrast provided much of the
fairy tale pleasure of Carol
Reed's Oliver!, clearly the unof

ficial inspiration for Annie on
stage and screen. (The orphans
perform one number, "It's a
Hard Knock Life," in imitation of
"Food, Glorious Food," and
Huston and his choreographer,
Arlene Phillips, have built a huge
open house sequence around "I
Think I'm Gonna Like It Here,"
danced by maids and butlers,
that makes us wish we were
watching "Who Will Buy?") It's
true that Martin Charnin's lyrics
are, to put it kindly, uninspired,
and Charles Strouse's music is
bland and forgettable — far from
his best; he also scored Bye Bye
Birdie and the haunting, neg
lected Sammy Davis vehicle
Golden Boy. But Lionel Bart's
songs for Oliver! weren't much
better; it's possible to make a
first-rate musical film with a sec
ond- or even a third-rate score.
The most frustrating part
about sitting through Annie is
the recognition that Huston
didn't lose control until the cam
eras started rolling: except for
Aileen Quinn, the cast could
hardly be better. The problem is
that most of the actors don't
have a thing to do. Albert Fin
ney, bald and broad, is an
hilarious Daddy Warbucks; he
works up such fine comic bluster
that even his sentimental scenes
don't defeat him. And Carol
Burnett's Miss Hannigan is a
gorgeous grotesque — riotous
and frightening at the same time,
with a knockabout savagery that
bursts the corset strings of the
dumb movie around her. It's a
full-length caricature — the first
performance Burnett has given
on the large screen that realizes
the potential of the work she did
for years on the small one. But
Finney and Burnett are the only
winners in this picture. Ann Re
inking's role as Warbucks' secre
tary Grace Farrell is a glamorized
version of the parts Ruby Keeler
used to play in the '30s, and she
looks strained in her customes
and hairstyle. The proud, sexy

sparkle in her eyes when, having
persuaded her boss to adopt An
nie, she tells him/ "I could just
kiss you," is the closest she
comes to reminding us of how
good she was in All That Jazz,
and only the title number shows
off her dancing — the rest of the
choreography featuring her is
purely decorative. Geoffrey
Holder is amusingly costumed as
Warbucks' bodyguard Punjab,
but aside from a neat moment
when he cures Finney's aching
shin, he might as well be addi
tional furniture in the mansion.
Tim Curry (of The Rocky Horror
Picture Show) and Bernadette
Peters (of Pennies from Heaven)
look wonderful — he wears his
hair slicked back, and his cheap
sharp suit and fedora are right
out of Guys and Dolls — and
they are ideally cast as Han
nigan's villainous brother and
his tarty paramour, but Huston
allows each of them approx
imately 20 juicy seconds.
When Curry and Peters join
Carol Burnett for the "Easy
Street" number, you figure the
film has to pick up, but like all of
the other dances in Annie, this
one is misconceived and idi
otically shot. We see feet when
we want to see whole bodies,
and the continuity is messed up,
so that the number never gets
going. The size of the musical se
quences exposes the faults in
their construction with cruel
regularity, just as the scene from
Garbo's Camille, which Annie
views with Warbucks and Grace
at radio City Music Hall, can't
support being blown up into
wide screen because the pores
in the actors' bodies gape and
the tops of their heads are cut
off. (A bit of inaccuracy: we're
told that Annie is 10 and was
born in 1922, but George Cukor
made Camille in 1937). Huston
shouldn't have included so
many quotes from other musi
cals, either, because most of
them stir up memories of better

movies. For example, there's a
dreadful Rockettes number in
the style of Busby Berkeley, and
a tap duet between Finney and
Aileen Quinn that evokes
Shirley Temple and "Bojangles"
Robinson in Captain January,
and the finale includes an hom
age to the last shot of Minnelli's
Meet Me in St. Louis. There's
even a bit from Anchors Aweigh,
though it's one of the worst
numbers — the one in which
Gene Kelly climbs up to Kathryn

Grayson's balcony with a rose in
his teeth — and so it effects a dif
ferent kind of damage: you just
wonder about Huston's taste.
The references to Mary Poppins
and Hello, Dolly! may be ac
cidental. But Annie, for all its ef
forts to join the pantheon of
memorable musical pictures, has
only one terrific number: "Little
Girls," in which Carol Burnett
smashes a radio into a doll's skull
and then twists it off. This mo
ment gives us a little perspective.
