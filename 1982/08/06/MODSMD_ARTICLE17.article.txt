# The 						sound of Metheny, the roar of the crowd

Pat Metheny
Greek Theatre/Berkeley
30 July 1982
When the sun sets in Berkeley
the temperature drops. And
when it gets colder, stringed in
struments, like guitars and
basses, get out of tune. It took
Pat Metheny and his bassist,
Steve Raodby, nearly five
minutes to tune their respective
instruments after the closing
song and the first encore. But
when Metheny unplugged his
guitar and Raodby his electric
bass from the electric tuner, they
were prepared to pick up where
they left off.
Now five minutes is a long
time to keep an audience wait
ing for an encore, especially af
ter two and a quarter hours of
jazz/fusion played to perfection
by one of the industry's more in
teresting bands. And when the
Pat Metheny Group ran back
onto the Greek Theater's huge
outdoor stage, whatever the
thousands in the chairs, con
crete blocks and the grass had
held in while the band took five

was emitted in a roar that could
only be matched by, say, a win
ning basket at the buzzer in the
NCAA Basketball Cham
pionships.
It was also the type of roar that
one would expect to hear on a
live album. And there's a good
chance that it might end up on a
Pat Metheny Live LP, too. Be
cause of the Greek Theater's ex
cellent acoustics, Metheny and
Co. recorded their two-and-a
half-hour concert. But the
quintet didn't necessarily record
with the idea of cutting an album
in mind. That's not their style. In
stead, as Metheny said after the
show, the group just wanted to
"get it on tape." Money doesn't
seem to be the issue here. Just
recording the in-concert magic
of the Pat Metheny Group does.
It should be clarified that the
Pat Metheny Group, not just Pat
Metheny, appeared at the
Greek. There's a big difference,
too. Metheny by himself is just
that. A man and a guitar, not an
act 5000 would pay $10 to see on
a Friday night in the height of
summer. The Pat Metheny
Group features five musicians

and, although Metheny is the
main attraction, he is by far not
the only reason to fork out ten
bills.
There is also (Metheny likes to
call him a pianist) keyboardist
Lyle Mays, drummer Dan Got
tlieb, bassist Raodby and the
most recent addition to the
quintet, percussionist Nanu
Vasconcelos. The five combine
to produce a sound unlike any
other group in jazz, fusion, rock,
funk, etc. The quintet has taken
the fluidity of straight jazz, sim
plified the basslines and then
added the acoustic and electric
sounds of Metheny and Mays,
topping it all with the innovative
percussion of Vasconcelos. The
band is much more a band than
it may seem, as many fans at
tribute the unique, relaxing
sound to Metheny's guitar. That,
again, is not the full story.
Of the five musicians, only
Raodby seems dispensable. In
fact, the core of the group,
Metheny, Mays and Gottlieb,
have remained loyal since their
start in 1977. Although the
trademark of the group is the
special way Metheny plays his
arsenal of guitars, Mays and Got
tlieb make just as much of a con
tribution, though it may not be
as audible.
Unlike many jazz/fusion key
boardists, Mays often plays with
both hands when soloing, part
ing from the more traditional
right-hand-only technique. The
result is a fuller sound and a vast
ly more complex effort. And in

stead of playing just one note at a
time during a solo, Mays has his
fingers on three or four keys at
once.
Metheny fuses single- and
multiple-note riffs together in
much the same manner as Mays.
The short, long-haired guitarist
has found the perfect medium
between lead and rhythm guitar.
Metheny will play a note, fol
lowed by a chord. The band
leader plays both a 12-string
acoustic and a six-string electric
guitar on some songs in concert,
since a fair share of Pat Metheny
Group songs begin with the
acoustic instrument and feature
the electric one during the solos.
Besides an orthodox electric
guitar, Metheny plays a Digital,
in which the notes are fed
through a synthesizer to pro
duce a high pitched, wailing
sound.
Rounding out the trio that
makes up the Pat Metheny
Group's backbone is drummer
Gottlieb, the band's superglue.
Gottlieb is heavily influenced by
straight-ahead drummers and
plays accordingly. He is also big
on cymbals and does not shy
away from displaying this fetish
in concert. But Gottlieb does not
pound on the cymbols like a
rock drummer or even a Billy
Cobham; instead he hits them in
a soft, soothing manner, usually
syncopated with Methenv's
guitar riffs.
Unfortunately, the Pat
Metheny Group has released
but three albums in their five

years of existence. The most re
cent addition to this excellent
collection is Off Ramp, which hit
the record stores a few months
ago, and is by far their weakest
effort. The songs on Pat
Metheny Group and American
Garage seem to have much more
patience and thought behind
them, and except for a few vin
tage tunes Off Ramp is relatively
boring.
Perhaps the biggest change
the group is going through at the
present time is the slow transi
tion to more electronic instru
ments. Mays seems to be aban
doning his piano for various syn
thesizers while Metheny ap
pears to be relying on his Digital
more and more. Whether or not
these trends are carried to ex
tremes remains to be seen on the
group's next studio album.
I say studio because if
Metheny and Co. opt for a live
LP as their next effort, the in
creased use of electronics may
not be too audible, based on
their live performance at the
Greek. Metheny picked up his
Digital only a few times, one of
which was during the group's
only "space tune," the avant
garde title track of Off Ramp.
The Pat Metheny Group plans
to tour again in the fall, concen
trating on playing at college
campuses. Here's hoping that
they'll be around again, hearing
the tremendous roar of a Stan
ford audience.

Cobham; instead he hits them in
a soft, soothing manner, usually
syncopated with Methenv's
guitar riffs.
Unfortunately, the Pat
Metheny Group has released
but three albums in their five

years of existence. The most re
cent addition to this excellent
collection is Off Ramp, which hit
the record stores a few months
ago, and is by far their weakest
effort. The songs on Pat
Metheny Group and American
Garage seem to have much more
patience and thought behind
them, and except for a few vin
tage tunes Off Ramp is relatively
boring.
Perhaps the biggest change
the group is going through at the
present time is the slow transi
tion to more electronic instru
ments. Mays seems to be aban
doning his piano for various syn
thesizers while Metheny ap
pears to be relying on his Digital
more and more. Whether or not
these trends are carried to ex
tremes remains to be seen on the
group's next studio album.
I say studio because if
Metheny and Co. opt for a live
LP as their next effort, the in
creased use of electronics may
not be too audible, based on
their live performance at the
Greek. Metheny picked up his
Digital only a few times, one of
which was during the group's
only "space tune," the avant
garde title track of Off Ramp.
The Pat Metheny Group plans
to tour again in the fall, concen
trating on playing at college
campuses. Here's hoping that
they'll be around again, hearing
the tremendous roar of a Stan
ford audience.
Pat Metheny
Greek Theatre/Berkeley
30 July 1982
When the sun sets in Berkeley
the temperature drops. And
when it gets colder, stringed in
struments, like guitars and
basses, get out of tune. It took
Pat Metheny and his bassist,
Steve Raodby, nearly five
minutes to tune their respective
instruments after the closing
song and the first encore. But
when Metheny unplugged his
guitar and Raodby his electric
bass from the electric tuner, they
were prepared to pick up where
they left off.
Now five minutes is a long
time to keep an audience wait
ing for an encore, especially af
ter two and a quarter hours of
jazz/fusion played to perfection
by one of the industry's more in
teresting bands. And when the
Pat Metheny Group ran back
onto the Greek Theater's huge
outdoor stage, whatever the
thousands in the chairs, con
crete blocks and the grass had
held in while the band took five

was emitted in a roar that could
only be matched by, say, a win
ning basket at the buzzer in the
NCAA Basketball Cham
pionships.
It was also the type of roar that
one would expect to hear on a
live album. And there's a good
chance that it might end up on a
Pat Metheny Live LP, too. Be
cause of the Greek Theater's ex
cellent acoustics, Metheny and
Co. recorded their two-and-a
half-hour concert. But the
quintet didn't necessarily record
with the idea of cutting an album
in mind. That's not their style. In
stead, as Metheny said after the
show, the group just wanted to
"get it on tape." Money doesn't
seem to be the issue here. Just
recording the in-concert magic
of the Pat Metheny Group does.
It should be clarified that the
Pat Metheny Group, not just Pat
Metheny, appeared at the
Greek. There's a big difference,
too. Metheny by himself is just
that. A man and a guitar, not an
act 5000 would pay $10 to see on
a Friday night in the height of
summer. The Pat Metheny
Group features five musicians

and, although Metheny is the
main attraction, he is by far not
the only reason to fork out ten
bills.
There is also (Metheny likes to
call him a pianist) keyboardist
Lyle Mays, drummer Dan Got
tlieb, bassist Raodby and the
most recent addition to the
quintet, percussionist Nanu
Vasconcelos. The five combine
to produce a sound unlike any
other group in jazz, fusion, rock,
funk, etc. The quintet has taken
the fluidity of straight jazz, sim
plified the basslines and then
added the acoustic and electric
sounds of Metheny and Mays,
topping it all with the innovative
percussion of Vasconcelos. The
band is much more a band than
it may seem, as many fans at
tribute the unique, relaxing
sound to Metheny's guitar. That,
again, is not the full story.
Of the five musicians, only
Raodby seems dispensable. In
fact, the core of the group,
Metheny, Mays and Gottlieb,
have remained loyal since their
start in 1977. Although the
trademark of the group is the
special way Metheny plays his
arsenal of guitars, Mays and Got
tlieb make just as much of a con
tribution, though it may not be
as audible.
Unlike many jazz/fusion key
boardists, Mays often plays with
both hands when soloing, part
ing from the more traditional
right-hand-only technique. The
result is a fuller sound and a vast
ly more complex effort. And in

stead of playing just one note at a
time during a solo, Mays has his
fingers on three or four keys at
once.
Metheny fuses single- and
multiple-note riffs together in
much the same manner as Mays.
The short, long-haired guitarist
has found the perfect medium
between lead and rhythm guitar.
Metheny will play a note, fol
lowed by a chord. The band
leader plays both a 12-string
acoustic and a six-string electric
guitar on some songs in concert,
since a fair share of Pat Metheny
Group songs begin with the
acoustic instrument and feature
the electric one during the solos.
Besides an orthodox electric
guitar, Metheny plays a Digital,
in which the notes are fed
through a synthesizer to pro
duce a high pitched, wailing
sound.
Rounding out the trio that
makes up the Pat Metheny
Group's backbone is drummer
Gottlieb, the band's superglue.
Gottlieb is heavily influenced by
straight-ahead drummers and
plays accordingly. He is also big
on cymbals and does not shy
away from displaying this fetish
in concert. But Gottlieb does not
pound on the cymbols like a
rock drummer or even a Billy
Cobham; instead he hits them in
a soft, soothing manner, usually
syncopated with Methenv's
guitar riffs.
