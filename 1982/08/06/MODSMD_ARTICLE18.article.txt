## Bay view, Bay shrimp make it first-class

A cast of stars, including
Mother Nature, general man
ager Kevin Westlye and chef
David Lisandrelli, has created
wonders at Borel's.
Mother Nature has done her
part by giving Borel's a view that
is undoubtedly the best offered
by any restaurant in the Bay
Area. Set on the crest of the foot-
the diners can see below
them the sweep of the Bay and as
far as the mountains on the con
tinental side that crest in Mount
Diablo.
These days, sunset comes at
the time when the dining hour is
in full swing, so as the sun fades
the diners can see the breath
taking transformation of the
Peninsula into a spangled carpet
of lights.
Not only this, but the restau
rant is so arranged that the seat
ing is in tiers, and literally every
table has a view.
The designers of the restau
rant cleverly planted birches and
tree ferns so that the view is
framed in a natural setting.
Enhancing the effect, the capaci
ous interior is studded with ficus,
hanging ferns and pieces of
sculpture.
The ceilings soar 20 to 30 feet
above the tables, so the air is
always fresh, and the buzz of

conversation does not re
verberate but ascends to the sky
lights far above.
Flambeaux of natural gas pro
vide an unusual pattern of light.
Our table had a bowl in which

grew African violets.
Borel's is a large restaurant,
seating 300 and doing $3 million
of business a year. However, the
tiers of floors and the way the in
terior is divided up, gives the in
dividual diner a sense of being in

a smaller place.
Kevin Westlye, the general
manager, is a young man of Nor
wegian descent who clearly has
trained his staff to a pitch some
what above the average. They
are all young, enthusiastic about

their jobs, and helpful.
We started off our meal with
two dishes based on bay shrimp,
and here the hand of chef Lisan
drelli was apparent. The first was
bay shrimp marinated in a dill

mustard sauce and served in a
half papaya ($4.50). This was first
class. I had the shrimp re
■noulade — a New Orleans spe
cialty. This consisted of Oregon
bay shrimp and hard-boiled egg
covered with a blend of may-

onnaise, capers, anchovies,
chervil, mustard and fresh garlic
($4.25). Again, full marks.
At the urging of our waiter, we
sampled the home-made Boston
clam chowder ($1.75), which is
created by his brother, an assis
tant chef. It could not possibly
have been as good as the brother
promised, but it was very close,
and lacked only the full flavor
that is possible with a more gen
erous proportion of clams.
The tossed salad of Danish
bleu cheese was a great success.
The spinach salad with
mushroom and bacon was even
better.
Borel's offers a full menu, but
leans toward seafood as its
strong suit. Therefore, I ordered
the bouillabaisse(sl2.9s) which
consisted of crab, shrimp, fish
and clams in a rich tomato broth.
In Marseilles, where this dish or
iginated and is the regional mas

terpiece, they go very lightly on
the tomatoes, and often leave
them out altogether. This is an
individual taste, and personally I
could have done with less
tomato, but the dish was very sat
isfying.
My companion had the prime
rib ($12.25), which was so thick
and juicy that she went into a
state of bliss, during which she
was able to convey that the zuc
chini was crisp, a rarity in most
restaurants.
For the ambitious there are
such offerings as top sirloin plus
Alaskan king crab's legs ($16.95).
Another of the chef's master
pieces is stuffed sole Monterey,
with shrimp and crabmeat, fresh
tomato, Monterey jack cheese
and basil butter ($10.25).
Borel's has a total of 12
seafood dishes, and these we in
tend to try on subsequent visits.

The wine list featured many of
the noted California vineyards.
The house wines are from In
glenook at $3.25 a half litre.

drinking while listening to soft
rock and watching magnificent
views can do so in the impressive
bar (which is on the topmost tier
of floors). There is live music at
the bar from 8 p.m. to 1 a.m.
Wednesday through Saturday.
Borel's has been open for
eight years and has built up a
steady clientele, so reservations
are advised.
