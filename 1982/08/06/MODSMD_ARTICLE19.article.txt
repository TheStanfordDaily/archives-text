Scott's Seafood Grill & Bar
2300 E. Bayshore Road
Palo Alto
856-1046
Scott's somehow seems out of place in
Palo Alto — its large, open interior and
nearly all-seafood menu resemble many
of the waterfront restaurants found along
San Francisco's Fishermen's Wharf or
down in the Los Angeles area, but certain
ly not the smaller, more intimate and
often less specialized eating houses com
mon to this area.
Fortunately, it's here anyway.
For if one doesn't mind dining in full
view of about 150 others and in the ac
companying din of conversation, Scott's
is an excellent place for the seafood lover.
The fare is fresh, extremely well prepared
and on the whole attractively garnished,
and the service is very good.
We arrived at 9 on a Friday evening and
the restaurant was still crowded. The
smell of the sea was hardly in the air, nor
was the roar of the coast, but the Palo Alto
Baylands are right down the street so all is
certainly not lost. We were immediately
seated in one of two large dining areas,
more-than-fully lighted and in full view of
everybody else. If you're a people
watcher Scott's is ideal, but you will also,
of course, be among the watched.
We declined a cocktail by "virtue" of
hunger, and set about ordering. First law
of dining at Scott's: ignore the menu and
look at the large "Special's" board first.
They vary nightly not just for variety's
sake, but because the chefs decide on
them each morning on the basis (at least
partly) of what's most fresh.What's more,
the specials, we were told, are part of an
intramural rivalry of sorts among the

three Scott's restaurants (the other two
are in the City) and individual chefs are
given free rein to create them.
On this particular night, the Palo Alto
team must have been on a hitting streak,
for everything looked good. There was,
for example, Grilled Halibut with green
onion, walnuts and tomatoes in a sour
cream sauce ($11.50) — this we tried and it
was excellent.
There were also, among other dishes,

Grilled Sturgeon with garlic cream sauce
($11.95) and Broiled Thresher Shark with
almonds cooked in brown butter ($9.95)
on the specials board — not to mention
homemade espresso ice cream ($3).
From the regular menu, we did order
fresh Pacific Salmon ($12.95). This was
grilled and was tender, flaky and really ex
cellent. It is served with Hollandaise, and
can be broiled or poached depending on
the customers' wishes.
To jump back out of the fire and into

the frying pan, we should describe the ap
petizers, with which, despite the se
quence of this review, we did begin our
meal. First we tried a Bay Shrimp cocktail
with sauce ($4.25) which was perhaps the
least fresh-tasting of all our samples and
also a bit too cold, but still good. Next we
tackled a cup of Boston Clam Chowder
($1.50, a bowl is $2.75), which was creamy,
deliciously spiced ... but too subtle on
the clam side. Just a few more of 'em
would make it outstanding, and couldput

Scott's in head-to-head (should we say,
shell-to-shell) competition with New Eng
land's finest. The house salad, hearts of
Romaine served with tomato and
cucumber and a vinaigrette dressing, was
interesting.
The seafood entrees were served with
delicious, crisp zucchini (the remaining
portion of which, truth be told, we used
to cook a delicious spaghetti sauce at
home a few days later) but were also near

ly buried in an accompanying mound of
zealous-looking French fries.
The possibilities listed so far are just a
small sample of the full range available —
there is also Filet of Petrale Sole, Grilled
Sandciabs, Grilled Filet of Pacific Snapper
(cooked provencale with garlic, tomato
and mushroom or meuniere in stock,
lemon and wine), Fried Calamari, Broiled
Lobster Tail, Grilled Rainbow Trout, Hot
Crabcake Sandwich ... The Filet Mignon
($14.95) looked singularly lonely on the
menu, and very out of place.
It seems hard to believe that after all
this, there is room for a bit more praise.
However, a delicious Raspberry Jack des
sert of ice cream, fresh raspberries, Triple
Sec and whipped cream deserves plaudits
as does, apologies for the non sequitur,
our waiter. The latter was first-rate: very
attentive to our wants throughout the
evening, but not at all obtrusive. Not an
easy balance to strike, as just about any
body who's ever had the occupation will
attest.
Our total bill, including a half-carafe of
the house wine, came to $43.07.
Scott's is not the place for a cozy, in
timate and romantic tete a fete, a fact
brought home to us not just by the roar of
the crowd, but also by a chef's assistant
who sauntered out halfway through our
meal to fill a plastic bucket with water out
of a tap just a few feet away from us.
Reservations are advisable although
not necessary for dinner, and lunch is also
served (with no reservations taken or
needed). There is also a happy hour Mon
day through Friday from 4 to 7, with free
Prawns provencale and oysters at 25 cents
apiece.

easy balance to strike, as just about any

Our total bill, including a half-carafe of

Scott's is not the place for a cozy, in

Scott's Seafood Grill & Bar
2300 E. Bayshore Road
Palo Alto
856-1046
Scott's somehow seems out of place in
Palo Alto — its large, open interior and
nearly all-seafood menu resemble many
of the waterfront restaurants found along
San Francisco's Fishermen's Wharf or
down in the Los Angeles area, but certain
ly not the smaller, more intimate and
often less specialized eating houses com
mon to this area.
Fortunately, it's here anyway.
For if one doesn't mind dining in full
view of about 150 others and in the ac
companying din of conversation, Scott's
is an excellent place for the seafood lover.
The fare is fresh, extremely well prepared
and on the whole attractively garnished,
and the service is very good.
We arrived at 9 on a Friday evening and
the restaurant was still crowded. The
smell of the sea was hardly in the air, nor
was the roar of the coast, but the Palo Alto
Baylands are right down the street so all is
certainly not lost. We were immediately
seated in one of two large dining areas,
more-than-fully lighted and in full view of
everybody else. If you're a people
watcher Scott's is ideal, but you will also,
of course, be among the watched.
We declined a cocktail by "virtue" of
hunger, and set about ordering. First law
of dining at Scott's: ignore the menu and
look at the large "Special's" board first.
They vary nightly not just for variety's
sake, but because the chefs decide on
them each morning on the basis (at least
partly) of what's most fresh.What's more,
the specials, we were told, are part of an
intramural rivalry of sorts among the

three Scott's restaurants (the other two
are in the City) and individual chefs are
given free rein to create them.
On this particular night, the Palo Alto
team must have been on a hitting streak,
for everything looked good. There was,
for example, Grilled Halibut with green
onion, walnuts and tomatoes in a sour
cream sauce ($11.50) — this we tried and it
was excellent.
There were also, among other dishes,

Grilled Sturgeon with garlic cream sauce
($11.95) and Broiled Thresher Shark with
almonds cooked in brown butter ($9.95)
on the specials board — not to mention
homemade espresso ice cream ($3).
From the regular menu, we did order
fresh Pacific Salmon ($12.95). This was
grilled and was tender, flaky and really ex
cellent. It is served with Hollandaise, and
can be broiled or poached depending on
the customers' wishes.
To jump back out of the fire and into

the frying pan, we should describe the ap
petizers, with which, despite the se
quence of this review, we did begin our
meal. First we tried a Bay Shrimp cocktail
with sauce ($4.25) which was perhaps the
least fresh-tasting of all our samples and
also a bit too cold, but still good. Next we
tackled a cup of Boston Clam Chowder
($1.50, a bowl is $2.75), which was creamy,
deliciously spiced ... but too subtle on
the clam side. Just a few more of 'em
would make it outstanding, and couldput

Scott's in head-to-head (should we say,
shell-to-shell) competition with New Eng
land's finest. The house salad, hearts of
Romaine served with tomato and
cucumber and a vinaigrette dressing, was
interesting.
The seafood entrees were served with
delicious, crisp zucchini (the remaining
portion of which, truth be told, we used
to cook a delicious spaghetti sauce at
home a few days later) but were also near

ly buried in an accompanying mound of
zealous-looking French fries.
The possibilities listed so far are just a
small sample of the full range available —
there is also Filet of Petrale Sole, Grilled
Sandciabs, Grilled Filet of Pacific Snapper
(cooked provencale with garlic, tomato
and mushroom or meuniere in stock,
lemon and wine), Fried Calamari, Broiled
Lobster Tail, Grilled Rainbow Trout, Hot
Crabcake Sandwich ... The Filet Mignon
($14.95) looked singularly lonely on the
menu, and very out of place.
It seems hard to believe that after all
this, there is room for a bit more praise.

sert of ice cream, fresh raspberries, Triple
