# Wegotiations in progress for Frost concerts
## Grateful Dead, Loggins may perform in Oct. 
### Karen Springen 
If contract negotiations go as
expected next week, both the
Grateful Dead and Keriny Log
gins will perform in Frost Am
phitheater this October.
Current plans, if approved,
slate Bill Graham Presents to co
produce the Grateful Dead with
the Stanford Chaparral and Ken
ny Loggins with the Student
Alumni Network (STAN).
Danny Scher, vice-president
of Bill Graham Presents, the lead
ing Bay Area live entertainment
promotional company, told the
Daily Wednesday night that con
tracts should be signed for both
concerts next week. "I forsee no
problems," he said.
Scher will negotiate both con
tracts with Vicky Holt, University
director of events and services.
The University Committee on
Contemporary Entertainment
(COCE), which has overseen
concerts here since ASSU Spe
cial Events was disbanded two
years ago, appointed Holt to ne
gotiate for groups seeking con
certs here.
According to STAN Director
Margot Nelson, the committee
delegated Holt because of her
Past experience in both nego
tiation and entertainment. Since
'he committee delegated Holt to
negotiate with Scher, no one
e '*e is technically permitted to
'alk with him, she said.
Concert dates
According to Holt, tentative
concert dates include Oct. 9 and
for the Grateful Dead and
Oct. 23 or 24 for Kenny Loggins.
I think we're going to have
some concerts," she said.
Nelson said these were the
on 'y dates available because of a
University rule which places a
im 't of one major event per
Weekend. This eliminated, for
example, the USC game week
end of Oct. 16.
Nelson said STAN has been
talking to Scher since last Sep
tember and has been working

on proposals since May. Yet ne
gotiations are not finalized.
Scher said negotiations were
delayed because "a lot of heavy
personal things came down this
week" at Bill Graham Presents.
Scher (class of '73, MBA 75)
ran the now-defunct ASSU Spe
cial Events the last year it was
profitable. Although he nego
tiated contracts at that time, the
absence of student negotiators
now does not bother him. He
said students should no longer
negotiate because of their
proven failure during the past 10
years.
"I was successful. Other peo
ple who had my job weren't suc
cessful," he said. "I think Stan
ford students couldn't negotiate
with talent. That's the whole rea
son you're out of business."
But Associate Dean of Student
Affairs Tom Massey, chair of the
COCE, has expressed his disap
pointment that students are not
involved, said STAN member
Dave Stucky.
Vinny Freda, business man
ager of the Chaparral and a
member of the COCE, said, "The
negotiations are really tense ...
The way concert negotiations
work, privacy always plays really
a large part in what you're
doing." But he said, "STAN defi
nitely has a point (in wanting stu
dents to receive business ex
perience)."
Both STAN and the Chaparral
declined to disclose the terms of
the contract or to predict poten
tial earnings. But Nelson said,
"Our first choice would be the
contract we had last May (for
Pablo Cruise)."
Freda said, "I'm absolutely not
allowed to tell you anything fi
nancial now ... If Bill Graham
knows how much the concert's
going to cost us, that's a major
bargaining chip."
But Freda said he doubted
profits would be large. He cited
potential risks involved, adding,
"I don't think there's ever been a

concert at Stanford in which
someone has not broken a leg."
Nelson said, "The rock busi
ness is not that good right now."
She declined to speculate
whether the contract would be
similar to last year's Pablo Cruise
deal which estimated a $5000 to
$10,000 profit for STAN and in
cluded a $1500 guarantee. The
concert was cancelled due to an
injury. STAN, however, claimed
only $900 of the $1500 com
pensation, leaving the remain
ing $600 in a measure of "good
faith" for future concerts.
More concerts?
STAN and the Chaparral are
the only groups to have had final
proposals passed by the Concert
Committee this summer. But the
Leland Stanford Junior Univer
sity Marching Band and the Del
ta Upsilon fraternity have had
preliminary proposals passed.
According to ASSU Financial
Manager Bob Brody, one of sev
en members on the Concert
Committee (a subcommittee of
COCE), neither the Band nor the
DU fraternity have submitted
proposals for specific groups yet.
Both groups had planned con
certs this past year that fell
through. The Band's previous
choice, Elton John, had opted
for a night concert at Berkeley,
and the DU's choice, George
Benson, took a job outside of Bill
Graham Presents.
Co-promotion
Bill Graham Presents is cur
rently the only major promoter
of concerts in the Bay Area. Be
cause of the difficulties in han
dling concerts and the past fail
ure of concerts promoted solely
by students, the University pre
fers that groups use a co-pro
moter.
Freda said, "Since Special
Events closed down, everyone's
a little leary of doing concerts
themselves."
According to Freda, COCE
consists of nine voting members
who decide policy issues and

meet to deal with major prob
lems. The Concert Committee,
the part of the COCE which
manages day-to-day operations
and negotiates contracts, in
cludes Massey (the chairman),
Brody, Freda, ASSU senator Nick
Gault, and a student intern.
Freda said the approval proc
ess consists of seven steps.
Groups must tell Holt that they
want to promote a concert. Holt
gives the group a preliminary
proposal application which they
fill out and submit to the com
mittee. The commitee then
votes on the preliminary applica
tion. After the the group is
shown to be financially sound,
the preliminary proposal is ap
proved. With the aid of Holt, the
group starts deciding who to
promote and where.
Why these groups?
Nelson explained that STAN's
selection of Loggins was based
on the nature and the availability
of the act. Stucky added, "We
didn't want somebody that
would be too radical."

Freda said the Chaparral knew
that the Grateful Dead, who ap
peared here in Maples Pavilion a
decade ago, was going to be on
tour in October. "We put forth a
final proposal with the specific
concert of the Dead," he said.
Pending approval
If approved, the concerts will
be held in Frost Amphitheater
which has a 9500-person capaci
ty-
Freda said general admission
tickets will be sold. Prices will be
up to Bill Graham Presents, but
students will get a $1 discount,
he said. Tresidder will probably
handle concessions.
The Chaparral could reject the
contract to be negotiated by
Holt. But Freda said, "She (Holt)
is well aware of what we want."
The Chaparral may use any prof
its to put color inside its maga
zine, said Freda.
Freda said the Chaparral is
motivated by two points: to pro
vide business experience for
anyone who wants it and to pub
licize the Chaparral.
