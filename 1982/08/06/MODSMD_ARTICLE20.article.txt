# Few surprises... but no disappointments

We sat sipping tea in the dimly lit room, and began
scanning the 98 varieties of (Pe)king and
(Sze)chuan dishes presented simply on the
menu. Upon our waiter's arrival, we helplessly inquired,
"Do you have any suggestions or any specials?"
"Well, nothing that special," he replied.
Such was the start of a low-key meal at King Chuan's
Chinese restaurant that heralded few surprises yet no
disappointments. In fact, the comfortable atmosphere
provided the perfect escape from the craziness of a day
at work or the fast pace of the adjacent El Camino Real.
We had just enough time to take in trie decorations —
Chinese lanterns, scrolls, pictures, healthy plants, red
checkered table cloths, bits of Christmas decorations
and the soothing muzak (some old favorites like "Sun
rise, Sunset") that filled the small room before two gigan
tic bowls of soup (for small portions, that is) arrived and,
almost immediately thereafter, assorted cold appetizers
for two ($4.25).
The sizzling rice soup and the pork with szechuan
pickle soup (both $3 for the small, and with three larger
sizes ranging up to $7.75) were piping hot; thus, it be
came essential to alternate between the soup and the ap

petizers and glasses of water. What a beginning! Bites of
crunchy spring roll, fried won ton and chicken wings in
terspersed with slow spoonfuls of salty and spicy soup
and gasps for air and cold water.
Already content and grateful for a small rest before
our next dose, we drank some unobtrusive house wine

(Tsingtao beer is also available as are other beers, wines
and sake) and badgered our next-door neighbor, a self
identified regular who was enjoying a not-so-hot but
hot-enough dish of Kung Pao chicken (Szechuan style
and $4.50). A family across the aisle also recommended
the Hacked Chicken with Hot Sauce ($4.25), a cold ap
petizer, the Shrimp with Lobster Sauce (5.50) and
without question, the Mo-Shu Pork (4.50).
We were as happy with our selections. The Mo-Shu
Pork was cut well and contained a good balance of pork
and vegetables, although we would encourage the use
of more sauce and pancakes. The Tao Chien Chicken
(also $4.50) which featured slices of celery, green pep

per, water chestnut, egg and chicken was spicy and
savory but not as outstanding as the subtly spiced Hot
Braised Shrimp ($5.50).
To this point the presentations of dishes had not been
very flashy (although any of the Peking Duck dinners
promises to be entertaining) until the dessert. Our
waiter, who maintained his wry sense of humor through
out the meal as well as a great deal of dependable ser
vice, set our choice of glaced bananas on fire and then
watched our faces light up. The bananas ($4) were tender
and terrific; the meal, a fulfilling experience.
Our waiter told us that lunches are a bit more exciting.
"At noon, it is so rushed and noisy, it's like being in a
war," he quipped.
"We also used to close on Sundays and the boss would
take us to Reno but now we are so busy that Sunday trips
have stopped." King Chuan is open every day from 11:30
to 2:30 and 5 to 9:30 (weekends until 10),
"The boss's dream is to have a high-class Chinese res
taurant in which only small bowls of soup would be
served and customers wouldn't be able to get more even
if they wanted to," he concluded.
For the moment, owner Mr. Chen is still accomodat
ing. His three-year old un-Americanized Chinese restau
rant continues to offer good quality food at reasonable
prices and an intimate haven for students and local resi
dents.
