If you have tired of going to
the Dutch Goose or the Oasis
and seeing the same people
over and over, perhaps it is
time to try someplace new. In
fact, a good alternative awaits
just around the corner at the
Lancashire Tavern, an English
pub that has been open for
only two months.
The first notable difference
in the Lancashire Tavern is the
lack of a college atmosphere.
Peanut shells will not be
crunching under your feet as
you walk, and beer is served
English-style in pints or half
pints. There are five beers on

tap, three of which are British,
and 11 imported bottled
beers from which to choose.
Prices range from $2 for a
pint of English ale to $1 for a
bottle of American beer.
The atmosphere of the tav
ern also makes a visit a worth
while endeavor. On a Friday
or Saturday night one will
surely find a lively and outgo
ing crowd, although breath
ing space may be at a pre
mium. The bartenders are as
varied as the patrons and all
of them, from the young soc
cer player to the woman
decked out in full punk re
galia, are extremely pleasant.
The Lancashire Tavern is
perhaps the closest thing we
have here to a New Wave bar,
and many of the patrons sport

British accents. The loud juke
box is stocked with the latest
in New Wave as well as classic
rock and roll.
The bar itself is rather small
and dark and can get quite
crowded on the weekends.
But then again, if a bar does
not get crowded on the
weekend, you probably don't
want to be there.
It is doubtful that the Lan
cashire Tavern will replace
the "O" or the Dutch Goose
as favorite Stanford hangouts,
but it is certainly a worthwhile
alternative, especially if you
are in the mood for a New
Wave evening or some good
British beer.
