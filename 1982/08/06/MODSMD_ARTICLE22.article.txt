Prior to experiencing his first Los Angeles sprout
decked sandwich in Annie Hall, Woody Allen claimed
that California's only cultural advantage over New York
City was the ability to make a right-hand turn on red.
That's all well and good for the folks who can't see
beyond Brooklyn, but for those who know it's clear that
New York's true claim to fame lies at the other end of the
state. From Buffalo, the city that has brought America
Millard Fillmore, the Bills, Mark Russell, Molly McGuire
and Spyro Gyra, come two gastronomic chefs d'oeuvres
which are true masterpieces, Chicken Wings and Beef on
Week.
Thanks to the enterprise of restaurateur Ron Mentel,
Californians no longer need be deprived of these
gastronomic wonders. In fact, Ron's Buffalo Wings Cafe
puts California one giant step closer to proving Woody
totally out of phase.
To the uninitiated, Chicken Wings and Beef on Week
may seem hardly worth raising one's blood pressure for.
However, I have it on good authority from the horse
radish vendor at Buffalo's Polish Market that there are
only three cities in the United States where one eats well:
Buffalo, Cleveland and Philadelphia. Cleveland may

have its Kielbasa and Philly its cheesesteaks, but in Buf
falo the tavern style Beef on Week and Chicken Wings
reign supreme.
So what is this munchy fare, exactly? Beef on Week.is
an established German roast beef sandwich served on
Kummelweck ("Week"), which is a hard, crusty and
strictly German roll covered with caraway seeds and salt
crystals.
Chicken Wings are more of an upstart in Buffalo's his
tory, but they have taken the city by storm. Local lore has
it that they began their career when the chicken delivery
man brought the wrong order to Frank and Theresa's
Anchor Bar (a late-night Main Street landmark). A spir
ited cook saved Frank and Theresa from near disaster by
b< rbequeing the wings, covering them in a special red
hot sauce, and serving them with blue cheese dressing
and celery sticks. And thus, a star was born. They were an
instant hit, and are now available throughout the Buffalo
area.
To many the Chicken Wings combination sounds
something on the far side of bizarre, but for most people
an act of faith in trying them is well rewarded. In fact,
Chicken Wings have gained popularity so rapidly that
Buffalo Mayor Makowski has officially proclaimed July
29 as Buffalo Chicken Wings Day; and this brings us back
to Ron Mentel and his Buffalo Chicken Wings Cafe.
Ron has an exceptional pedigree for exporting these
Buffalo specialties to California. His family was in the res

taurant business for 40 years in the heart of Buffalo's
Broadway-Fillmore district, right across from the Polish
Market. The Wings recipe is the authentic original, due
to a collaboration with Frank and Theresa's.
Furthermore, like most expatriates, Ron is not one to let
an excuse for a party waste away, especially when it's in
honor of the "Queen City of the Great Lakes."
The Cafe is on Route 12 north of Sonoma, almost to the
end of Fetters Hot Springs as one heads toward
Kenwood.
I was so excited to find real Buffalo cuisine in Califor
nia that we tried both the Wings and the Beef on Week.
The wings were excellent, with a hot sauce to make any
Buffalo refugee feel right at home. Ten pieces go for
$3.75, 20 for $7, and die-hards can test their mettle with a
50-piece bucket.
Ron has exported another Buffalo tradition in featur
ing a Friday and Saturday night fish fry. He also has a
nightly dinner special, and — for the cynics — Buffalo
Chips. The restaurant is open from 8 a.m. to 11 p.m. on
weekdays, and 24 hours on the weekends.
For a casual, elbows-on-the-table time and good re
gional food, nothing beats a trip to Buffalo, New York via
Sonoma County. The effect will be even better if Ron
fulfills his dreams of bringing Genessee Beer to the
Golden State. One can almost hear the faint roar of
Niagara Falls.
