Casablanca ★★★★
New Varsity, Palo Alto
The movie that's represented
romance for two generations of
moviegoers. As Rick and llsa,
Humphrey Bogart and Ingrid
Bergman are one of the screen's
perfect couples: this was a match
made in movie heaven. Michael
Curtiz, a Warner Brothers con
tract director, was handed a rou
tine (and unfinished) script and
all the actors the studio had to of
fer. The result is a lot more than
routine — in its enduring appeal,
Casablanca has made movie his
tory.
Also featured are Dooley
Wilson, Claude Rains, Peter
Lorre, Sidney Greenstreet and
many others. Tonight only with
Play It Again, Sam.
Your faithful CinemaScope

editor apologizes for listing
Casablanca as playing last Friday,
and promises that it is, indeed,
playing this evening.

E.T. — The Extraterrestrial
★★★★
E.T. begins where Steven
Spielberg's Close Encounters
peaked — with the descent of an
alien craft — and gets better and
better from there. It's an
absolutely entrancing movie — a
miracle. This tale of a benevolent,
childlike alien's adventure on
earth doesn't contain a moment
of cruelty (though there is a great
deal of suspense), and Spielberg's
vision is so overwhelming that he
makes it difficult to conceive of
cruelty while we are watching the

film. The director uses film
maker's magic to tap into our
feelings, and the result is a movie
of extraordinary emotional
power.
— Steve Vineberg
Breaker Morant
New Varsity, Palo Alto
Harry "Breaker" Morant is a
lieutenant in the British forces in
South Africa during the Boer
War. He and two other Australian
soldiers are court martialled for
killing a German priest; they are
sacrificial lambs, served up to ap
pease the German government
and world opinion. This account
of their trial, and the events
which led up to it, is an extremely
"well-made" movie, stuffed full
of pretty scenery and historical

significance; while it never quite
catches fire, it stays well above
the boredom threshold.
Plays Sunday and Monday with
Gallipoli.
— Mike Hale
Gregory's Girl ★★★
Aquarius, Palo Alto
This Scottish movie about a
high school boy's misadventures
with girls is clumsily made, but
even the messed-up story and ed
iting can't detract from Gregory's
Girl's wit and charm. It features
great ensemble acting from a cast
composed almost entirely of
teenagers. There are half-a
dozen memorable per
formances, but the best is by
Gordon John Sinclair as Gregory,
who manages to merge style and
nerdishness with a facility that's
endearing and enviable. Bill For
syth wrote and directed.

Poltergeist ★*
Park Theater, Menlo Park
This movie is terribly efficient
— it gets to you — but I didn't
have much fun at it. I felt bar
raged by all the closeups and the
Dolby sound from the beginning,
long before the ghosts took over.
The film is so loud and relentless
throughout that it doesn't have
anywhere to go but straight to its
rather ludicrous big finish, with
skeletons popping up all over the
neighborhood and houses flam
ing and folding. The film's main
bright spots come not through
the special effects but through
the actors. Jobeth Williams is
touchingly earnest as the per
sistent, loving mother, and Zelda
Rubenstein brings such an un
usual, quicksilver charm to her
role of medium-for-hire that she
nearly redeems the most self-se
rious scenes.
Double-billed with Raiders of
the Lost Ark.

Diva ★★★★
Aquarius, Palo Alto
The high-tech chic of Diva,
directed by Jean-Jacques Beinix
and shot by Philippe Rousselot, is
dazzling. You can't complain that
Diva doesn't mean anything, be
cause Beinix's style and the
weightless shimmer of Hilton
McConnico's interior designs de
clare it in every frame. Of course,
in Diva style is content.
Its story is so beautifully
farfetched that it acquires its own
logic. It revolves around the fixa
tion of a Jules, a young mailman
(Frederic Andrei) for a black op
era singer (Wilhelmenia Wiggins

Fernandez). The singer never
records, but Jules manages to
record one of her concerts.
When that tape becomes
switched with a recording of an
expose by the mistress of a vice
chief, the movie slips into its own
giddy self-consciousness.
-S.V.
The 39 Steps
Fox, Redwood City
One of the later films, and per
haps the greatest, that Alfred
Hitchcock made before leaving
Britain for the United States. This
is a masterpiece of the under
stated, high-spirited blend of hu
mor, suspense, and wonderfully
implausible situations that
Hitchcock was so gifted at creat
ing. Robert Donat stars as a man
who inadvertently becomes in
volved with a group of spies; he
must flee over what seems to be
nearly all of Great Britain before
he manages to prove his in
nocence. Madeleine Carroll is a
woman he picks up on a train:
she thinks he's a murderer, and
Donat's too busy to convince her
otherwise. It's only after the two
are handcuffed together, and left
to wander about the Scottish
moors, that she realizes he might
not be so villainous after all.
Based, very loosely, on the John
Buchan novel.
Plays Monday with The Lady
Vanishes.
— J.M.
The Magic Flute ★★★★
Fox, Redwood City
Ingmar Bergman, in a sum
mertime mood, directed this
brilliant film version of the
Mozart opera. His Magic Flute is
unabashedly stagey — we see the
curtain go up at the beginning
and down at the end, and the ac
tion takes place amid cardboard
scenery — but this movie conveys
all of the fantasy the title suggests.
This film could be used as a
model for intelligently trans
ferring stage works to the screen.
Mozart seems to have been in
a summertime mood, too, and I'd
hazard a guess that some of the
film's success is his doing. His mu
sic is sung in Swedish, with sub
titles added for those who don't
speak it.
Plays next Thursday.

to wander about the Scottish
moors, that she realizes he might
not be so villainous after all.
Based, very loosely, on the John
Buchan novel.
Plays Monday with The Lady
Vanishes.

The Magic Flute ★★★★
Fox, Redwood City
Ingmar Bergman, in a sum
mertime mood, directed this
brilliant film version of the
Mozart opera. His Magic Flute is
unabashedly stagey — we see the
curtain go up at the beginning
and down at the end, and the ac
tion takes place amid cardboard
scenery — but this movie conveys
all of the fantasy the title suggests.
This film could be used as a
model for intelligently trans
ferring stage works to the screen.
Mozart seems to have been in
a summertime mood, too, and I'd
hazard a guess that some of the
film's success is his doing. His mu
sic is sung in Swedish, with sub
titles added for those who don't
speak it.
Plays next Thursday.

Casablanca ★★★★
New Varsity, Palo Alto
The movie that's represented
romance for two generations of
moviegoers. As Rick and llsa,
Humphrey Bogart and Ingrid
Bergman are one of the screen's
perfect couples: this was a match
made in movie heaven. Michael
Curtiz, a Warner Brothers con
tract director, was handed a rou
tine (and unfinished) script and
all the actors the studio had to of
fer. The result is a lot more than
routine — in its enduring appeal,
Casablanca has made movie his
tory.
Also featured are Dooley
Wilson, Claude Rains, Peter
Lorre, Sidney Greenstreet and
many others. Tonight only with
Play It Again, Sam.
Your faithful CinemaScope

editor apologizes for listing
Casablanca as playing last Friday,
and promises that it is, indeed,
playing this evening.

E.T. — The Extraterrestrial
★★★★
E.T. begins where Steven
Spielberg's Close Encounters
peaked — with the descent of an
alien craft — and gets better and
better from there. It's an
absolutely entrancing movie — a
miracle. This tale of a benevolent,
childlike alien's adventure on
earth doesn't contain a moment
of cruelty (though there is a great
deal of suspense), and Spielberg's
vision is so overwhelming that he
makes it difficult to conceive of
cruelty while we are watching the

film. The director uses film
maker's magic to tap into our
feelings, and the result is a movie
of extraordinary emotional
power.

Breaker Morant
New Varsity, Palo Alto
Harry "Breaker" Morant is a
lieutenant in the British forces in
South Africa during the Boer
War. He and two other Australian
soldiers are court martialled for
killing a German priest; they are
sacrificial lambs, served up to ap
pease the German government
and world opinion. This account
of their trial, and the events
which led up to it, is an extremely
"well-made" movie, stuffed full
of pretty scenery and historical

significance; while it never quite
catches fire, it stays well above
the boredom threshold.
Plays Sunday and Monday with
Gallipoli.
— Mike Hale
Gregory's Girl ★★★
Aquarius, Palo Alto
This Scottish movie about a
high school boy's misadventures
with girls is clumsily made, but
even the messed-up story and ed
iting can't detract from Gregory's
Girl's wit and charm. It features
great ensemble acting from a cast
composed almost entirely of
teenagers. There are half-a
dozen memorable per
formances, but the best is by
Gordon John Sinclair as Gregory,
who manages to merge style and
nerdishness with a facility that's
endearing and enviable. Bill For
syth wrote and directed.
— J.M.
Poltergeist ★*
Park Theater, Menlo Park
This movie is terribly efficient
— it gets to you — but I didn't
have much fun at it. I felt bar
raged by all the closeups and the
Dolby sound from the beginning,
long before the ghosts took over.
The film is so loud and relentless
throughout that it doesn't have
anywhere to go but straight to its
rather ludicrous big finish, with
skeletons popping up all over the
neighborhood and houses flam
ing and folding. The film's main
bright spots come not through
the special effects but through
the actors. Jobeth Williams is
touchingly earnest as the per
sistent, loving mother, and Zelda
Rubenstein brings such an un
usual, quicksilver charm to her
role of medium-for-hire that she
nearly redeems the most self-se
rious scenes.
Double-billed with Raiders of
the Lost Ark.
— S.V.
Diva ★★★★
Aquarius, Palo Alto
The high-tech chic of Diva,
directed by Jean-Jacques Beinix
and shot by Philippe Rousselot, is
dazzling. You can't complain that
Diva doesn't mean anything, be
cause Beinix's style and the
weightless shimmer of Hilton
McConnico's interior designs de
clare it in every frame. Of course,
in Diva style is content.
Its story is so beautifully
farfetched that it acquires its own
logic. It revolves around the fixa
tion of a Jules, a young mailman
(Frederic Andrei) for a black op
era singer (Wilhelmenia Wiggins

Fernandez). The singer never
records, but Jules manages to
record one of her concerts.
When that tape becomes
switched with a recording of an
expose by the mistress of a vice
chief, the movie slips into its own
giddy self-consciousness.
-S.V.
The 39 Steps
Fox, Redwood City
One of the later films, and per
haps the greatest, that Alfred
Hitchcock made before leaving
Britain for the United States. This
is a masterpiece of the under
stated, high-spirited blend of hu
mor, suspense, and wonderfully
implausible situations that
Hitchcock was so gifted at creat
ing. Robert Donat stars as a man
who inadvertently becomes in
volved with a group of spies; he
must flee over what seems to be
nearly all of Great Britain before
he manages to prove his in
nocence. Madeleine Carroll is a
woman he picks up on a train:
she thinks he's a murderer, and
Donat's too busy to convince her
otherwise. It's only after the two
are handcuffed together, and left
to wander about the Scottish
moors, that she realizes he might
not be so villainous after all.
Based, very loosely, on the John
Buchan novel.
