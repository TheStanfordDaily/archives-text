Israel rejects U.S. retreat demand
Thousands of panicky families fled west Beirut on yes
terday and the United States stepped up efforts to evac
uate the PLO. Israeli jets flew mock divebombing raids
and tanks dug in near guerrilla camps at the start of the
third month of the invasion.
The Reagan administration, apparently shifting its pol
icy for a cease-fire in place, called on Israel to surrender
the military gains it won in Wednesday's fierce tank as
saults and retreat to the truce lines that existed Sunday.
In an apparent response to this demand by President
Ronald Reagan for an Israeli pullback, Israel said the
deployment of its forces in Beirut would be determined
only after the trapped Palestinian guerrillas leave the
city, and yesterday night bluntly rejected a call for the
deployment of United Nations cease-fire observers
around Beirut.
During a five-hour special meeting conducted while
more than 2000 anti-war demonstrators stood outside
the office of Prime Minister Menachem Begin, the Israeli
Cabinet adopted a resolution saying the presence of
cease-fire observers would signal to the Palestine Liber
ation Organization that it is "not obligated to leave
Beirut and Lebanon" as Israel is demanding.
The statement, read to reporters by Cabinet Secretary
Dan Meridor, made no direct reference to Reagan's call
for a two-week total cease-fire to aid the negotiations for
a PLO withdrawal and for a pullback by Israeli forces
from positions they gained earlier this week inside the
western sector of the besieged city.
House rejects nuclear freeze
Washington — Repeatedly warned that it would in
terfere with U.S.-Soviet arms negotiations, the House
yesterday rejected a resolution calling for a freeze in
production, deployment and testing of nuclear weap
ons.
By a vote of 204 to 202 it adopted instead a measure en
dorsing ongoing strategic arms talks in Geneva and call
ing for a freeze sometime in the future.
Fifty-three Democrats voted with 151 Republicans for
the substitute after Rep. Robert Michel (R-lll.), the
House minority leader told members, "Let's do the sen
sible thing and help the president of the United States."
Although the margin was narrow, the vote was an im
portant victory for the White House, which had lobbied
intensely against the freeze resolution since the measure
was adopted by the House Foreign Affairs Committee in
late June. Rep. Clement Zablocki (D-Wis.) chairman of
the committee, led the forces supporting the freeze.
Shortly before the vote, Rep. William Broomfield (R-
Mich.), the principal sponsor of the substitute resolu
tion, read a letter from President Ronald Reagan saying
that adoption of the freeze would give Soviet negotiators
in Geneva an impression that the United States would
settle for less than it has already proposed in the arms ne
gotiations.

Neither of the resolutions considered by the House
was binding, but the issue was debated at length because
of the grass roots interest in a freeze that has swept the
United States in recent months.
Reagan fights to avert GOP revolt
Washington - President Ronald Reagan fought yester
day to quell a growing revolt against his proposed tax in
crease by such longtime conservative allies as Jack Kemp
(R-N.Y.), the California Republican congressional dele
gation and even former White House aides.
But the president's struggle showed few signs of im
mediate success after two afternoons filled with urgent
meetings at the White House with supporters and defec
tors alike.
The paradox of a president who ran for election on a
pledge to cut taxes, kept his word and now wants to raise
them to reduce a growing budget deficit was not lost on
conservatives who have refused to follow his lead.
"Quietly, without debate, the Republican party is in
danger of making a U-turn back to its familiar role of tax
collector for Democratic spending programs. This is
potentially an explosive scenario politically because the
GOP clearly will take the blame for any tax increase
passed by Congress," said a letter to Reagan signed by
Kemp and more than 80 other House Republicans, in
cluding 14 of 21 members from the president's home
state of California.
One White House official, asking that his name not be
used, said yesterday of Kemp: "We've had enough.
We're not going to put up with somebody leading a mi
nority within a minority (in the House). This is supposed
to be a team and he's gotten off of it."
Kemp co-sponsored the record tax cut that Reagan
endorsed last year and pushed to enactment. On
Wednesday, according to a White House source, Reagan
"took Kemp to the woodshed" in the Oval Office for
leading the opposition to the tax increase.
But the president also was having trouble with a non
congressional group of conservatives — calling itself the
"Friends of Reagan" — that included two former key
White House aides, political director Lyn Nofziger and
policy director Martin Anderson.
After holding a late Wednesday night meeting to plot
opposition to the tax increase, the group released a
statement yesterday declaring "we believe that to re
store the health of the economy and to put Americans
back to work, America should follow a course against
high taxes and high federal spending."
First offshore leasing sale held
Washington — The first oil and gas lease sale under In
terior Secretary James Watt's controversial new offshore
leasing program was held yesterday and oil companies
bid on only 40 of the 554 tracts offered for sale.
High bids for all 40 of the nine-mile-square tracts to
taled only $12.3 million, the lowest offering per acre

since the Interior Department put federal offshore lands
up for lease in 1954.
The low bids are likely to put something of a damper
on President Ronald Reagan's and Secretary Watt's
promise that federal revenues and royalties from off
shore oil and gas leases would make up as much as $15.7
billion toward the elimination of the federal deficit in fis
cal 1983.
Interior Department officials said, however, that the
areas up for bids yesterday were tracts passed over in
earlier offerings or those where previous bids were re
jected as too low.
Though they agreed that the tracts reoffered for sale
were not the best, oil industry spokesmen suggested
there were other reasons the bids were so low. Industry
profits are down, exploration is down and demand for oil
is down around the world.
Among the tracts that received no bids ut all were 23
off the coast of New Jersey. New jersey Gov. Thomas
Kean had sued to block the sale, claiming it would cause
over $1 billion in damage a year to the state's commercial
and recreational fishing industries. His suit became moot
when no oil company wanted to drill there.
NRC okays breeder reactor plans
Washington — In a reversal of policy, the U.S. Nuclear
Regulatory Commission bowed yesterday to Reagan ad
ministration requests and voted to allow construction to
begin on the controversial Clinch River Breeder Reactor.
By a 3-1 vote, the commission approved a Department
of Energy request that it waive certain licensing require
ments so that $40 million in site-preparation work could
begin immediately at Oak Ridge, Tenn., for the $3.2
billion plutonium-fueled nuclear power plant.
The project is designed to be the nation's first full
scale breeder reactor. Breeders produce more nuclear
fuel than they consume.
The commission twice this year had rejected the re
quest. Yesterday's vote was immediately attacked by
citizen and environmental groups as misguided and a
threat to the public interest.
On May 17, the commission turned down a similar De
paitnlcrti of Energy request by a 2-2 vote when Com
missioner James Asselstine, an appointee of President
Ronald Reagan who had been sworn in only hours
before, cast the decisive vote against the proposal. He
said that to have done otherwise "might raise serious
questions regarding my independence and objectivity."
