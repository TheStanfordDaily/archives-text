## Mansfield: U.S.-Japan relations are tense 
### Los Angeles Times 
Tokyo — U.S. Ambassador
Mike Mansfield said yesterday
that he was concerned by "a
sense of uneasiness on both
sides of the Pacific" and an "at
mosphere of mutual recrimina
tion" that he said had developed
between the United States and
Japan.
Both Americans and Japanese,

he told a luncheon meeting at
the Japan National Press Club,
have developed "a tendency to
search for hidden motivations
and prejudgments about each
other.
"A Pandora's box of old stere
otypes has been opened, letting
loose some capricious and
negative elements that are hard
to control," he said.
However, Mansfield did not
spell out what he called
"wounds (that threaten) to fester
and infect" U.S.-Japan relations.
But he appeared to be referring
to emotional criticism of Japan
by Americans and a growing
Japanese feeling that Japan has
been singled out as a scapegoat
for American economic trou
bles.
Although Mansfield has often
cited the seriousness of disputes
over both trade and defense is
sues since he became am
bassador in 1977, under Presi
dent Jimmy Carter, the former
Senate Majority Leader had not
before expressed concern about
"mutual recrimination" be
tween the two nations.
Yesterday, he again cited the
"enormity" of the trade prob
lem — an $18 billion U.S. deficit
last year that is expected to in

crease slightly this year. He said
that "additional measures to
open up the Japanese market —
particularly in agriculture — will
be necessary in the months
ahead."
He also criticized Japan for
dismissing the threat of growing
Soviet military power in Asia and
said Japan should accelerate
plans it announced July 23 to
procure up to $18.4 billion worth
of weaponry over the next five
years.
Issues like these are "quite
manageable" in themselves, he

said, but an atmosphere of
mutual recrimination makes it
"very difficult" for the two gov
ernments to resolve them.
"Without the recognition that
mutual understanding and
frank, level-headed discussion
between allies is essential, the
(U.S.-Japan) relationshipcan suf
fer serious and needless dam
age," he warned.
In reply to a question, Mans
field said he realized that an FBI
"sting" investigation in the Unit
ed States that led to indictments
of the Hitachi Co. and the

Mitsubishi Electric Co. on
charges of conspiracy to trans
port stolen property — in the
form of IBM computer secrets —
had led some Japanese to be
lieve that "this was directed pri
marily at Japan and was tied in
with the trade friction. *
"Nothing could be further
from the truth/' he said.
Mansfield said neither the U.S.
Embassy in Tokyo nor IBM,
Japan, knew anything about the
investigation "until after it was
reported in the Japanese press."
