Manila (DPA) — President Ferdinand Marcos
will soon appoint his wife, Imelda, as a member of
the executive committee that would take over the
government if he dies while in office, presidential
spokesman Adrian Cristobal said yesterday.
The committee is headed by the prime minister
and currently has seven members, although it
eventually will have 15. It is constitutionally
charged with running the affairs of government
until a presidential successor is chosen.
Cristobal said Marcos would also fill the remain
ing positions when he formally appoints Mrs.
Marcos, 54, who is already minister of human set
tlements and governor of metropolitan Manila.
The spokesman did not say when the formal ap
pointment would be made but the statement
fueled speculation that the first lady was being

groomed to succeed her husband, who has been
in power since 1965.
Imelda Marcos recently stated that if her hus
band stepped down then she would, too. But
Cristobal said that this did not mean she should be
disqualified from being elected.
,"To disqualify anyone in advance is rather
strange for anyone who believes in freedom of
choice," Cristobal said. "Indeed, if the people do
not want anyone, they will in due time say so in the
ballots."
Cristobal stressed that the question of who will
succeed Marcos might "be a premature concern.
"For one thing, there is every indication that the
ruling party will nominate Mr. Marcos again in
1987," he said, "and it seems that the opposition
wants this, too, for various reasons, not the least of
which is their fear of a less-tolerant adversary."
