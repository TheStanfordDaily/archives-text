# Morocco leads boycott of African leaders meeting
## 
### Washington Post 
Nairobi, Kenya â€”Africa's 112 rag
ile unity hung in the balance yes
terday as a Moroccan-led
boycott stymied the opening of
the annual summit meeting of
the Organization of African
Unity in Libya.
Kenya's President Daniel arap
Moi, the OAU chairman, said
here yesterday that he would at
tend only in the unlikely event
that there is a quorum. This
would mean that Moi would not
turn the OAU's leadership over
to Libya's Moammar Khadafy,
who is scheduled to succeed
him.
Since Sunday, when an at
tempt to overthrow Moi was
crushed by the army, most
diplomats had not expected him
to attend the controversial sum
mit.
Moi told diplomats yesterday
that so far there were 129 con
firmed dead in the uprising,
mainly junior air force officers,
although analysts felt the final
figure would be much higher.
In Tripoli, OAU delegates held
informal sessions away from the
conference center. By the end of
the day 17 African heads of state
or government had arrived and
some other nations were repre

sented by their foreign min
isters, but the total was far short
of the 34 needed to reach a two
thirds majority of the 51 mem
bers.
Khadafy has threatened to go
ahead without a quorum, a
move that could break up the
OAU, but the scheduled open
ing yesterday passed without a
formal session. The OAU meet
ing was scheduled to end Sun
day.
Morocco is leading the
boycott by mainly Arab and
West African nations opposed to
the admission of the Polisario
Front to the OAU. Moroccan
forces have been fighting the
Polisario guerrillas for control of
arid Western Sahara, a former
Spanish colony, for six years.
Nairobi continued its slow re
turn to normal during daylight
hours yesterday. Gunfire could
be heard occasionally, apparent
ly from clashes between troops
and rebels. Two bodies were on
the sidewalk opposite a popular
downtown movie theater yester
day morning.
A 6 p.m. curfew is still in effect,
and the exodus from the capital
begins long before that, leaving
the streets deserted by late after
noon. Autos race through Nairo

bi's lush residential neighbor
hoods to beat the deadline. Spo
radic shooting could still be
heard after dark.
In Tripoli, the OAU delegates
face the dilemma of how to pro
ceed without a quorum or an of
ficial agenda. Insufficient repre
sentation over the last nine days
prevented formal meetings of
the OAU foreign ministers who
were to prepare an agenda.
If Khadafy, who has made it
clear that he wants to lead the
OAU, goes ahead with the sum
mit without a quorum, the OAU
could break up into two or more
camps.
However, even some of the
leaders who support Polisario
and are present in Tripoli may
hesitate to attend a conference
that could produce such a rift.
The African solution to such
controversial problems in the
past has usually been to finesse
the issue, and that could happen
again if there is a decision to
postpone the summit. Then a
special summit could be held,
probably not in Libya, to deal
with the Polisario question
without endangering the entire
future of the organization.
The problem came to the fore
front last February when the out

going OAU secretary-general,
Edem Kodjo, ruled that
Polisario's Sahara Arab Demo
cratic Republic should be seated
at an OAU foreign ministers'
meeting because 26 nations, a
majority of the organization, had
recognized it as the legitimate
government of the Western Sa
hara despite the continuing war.
Morocco still controls most of
the territory.
Kodjo argued that the issue
was an administrative matter to
be decided by a simple majority,
while Morocco and its backers
said that it was a matter reserved
for the summit and that a two
thirds vote was necessary.
The issue has plagued and
often paralyzed subsequent spe
cialized meetings of the OAU.

Senegal refused to admit
Polisario to an OAU meeting,
causing a boycott by its sup
porters. Zimbabwe, on the other
hand, admitted the front and a
Moroccan-led boycott fol
lowed.
Morocco's cause has also
been aided by some members'
opposition to holding a summit
in Libya and anointing Khadafy,
who has used terrorism abroad
to eliminate his enemies, as
Africa's leader.
Khadafy has accused the Unit
ed States of encouraging African
nations, through "corruption,"
to boycott the OAU.
The United States has broken
relations with Libya and urged all
American companies and indi
viduals to quit the country.
