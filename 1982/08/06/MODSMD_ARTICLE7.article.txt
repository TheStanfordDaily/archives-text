## Viewpoint/Glen and Shearer Reagan's attitude dampens START 
### 
Geneva, Switzerland — For
years, many have said that the
superpowers could expedite
their arms negotiations were
they only to meet in Hiroshima,
Dresden or Coventry. Perhaps
by working where bombs — nu
clear or otherwise — have done
their worst damage, negotiators
would strive to forestall a repeat
of history.
Unfortunately, venue has little
to do with the progress of cur
rent arms-control talks. After the
first spate of meetings between
U.S. and U.S.S.R. negotiators on
medium- and long-range nucle
ar forces, it seems clear that
progress — or lack thereof —
will be a factor of events
elsewhere.
Of course, it's not easy to
reach this conclusion. At their
respective missions, both super
powers pass out scads of free
propaganda boasting the most
willing, flexible and peaceable
approaches to current talks.
If anyone has undermined the
negotiations, each participant
claims it's been the other side.
But, for America's part at least,
recent actions have made a
mockery of its boasts about
peaceful intentions. In the last
two weeks, Reagan has:
• Ruled out a test-ban treaty
with the Soviets this year;
• Discouraged the possibility
of an October meeting with So
viet leader Brezhnev;
• Resolved to ignore con
gressional limits on military
spending;
• Indicated his intentions of
doubling the number of neutron
bomb warheads currently in
production.
Though probably unrelated
measures, these developments
test one's belief in the U.S. gov
ernment's commitment to the
stated aims of Geneva.
In an effort to smooth the way
for agreement, the United States
could, by completing any of the
following, signal a unilateral will
ingness to make arms reduc
tions:
• Freeze or reduce the
number of short-range nuclear
weapons currently deployed by

NATO in Europe (on land, the
number stands at about 6000);
• Begin a gradual shift from
the deployment of tanks to that
of anti-tank weapons to under
score claims of NATO's commit
ment to defense, not offense;
• Cancel plans to move Ameri
can troops in West Germany
"forward" this autumn;
• Bag the billion-dollar MX.
If the president sincerely de
sires results from Geneva, he
may find that the wheels of the
machinery need grease. Throw
ing wrenches in the works only
makes for a breakdown.
