# Hospital accessibility delays endorsement
## 
### Marc Schwarz 
Although a Subcommittee of
the Palo Alto City Council has
voted to tentatively support the
University's hospital mod
ernization program, the en
dorsement is conditioned upon
the solution of a four-year con
flict over local physicans' ac
cessibility to hospital resources.
The issue was scheduled to be
voted upon last night by the full
City Council. A vote on the en
dorsement was originally sched
uled last month but was delayed
over the accessibility issue.
Local physicians have corn

plained of inadequate access to
hospital services. Specifically,
certain equipment and research
facilities at the hospital may be
used only by University staff.
Currently, should a patient with
a local, non-staff doctor require
use of a restricted facility, a Uni
versity doctor must be contacted
to perform the necessary tasks.
Under these rules a local physi
cian — even though he might be
qualified to work on University
equipment — would lose the fee
for such work.
Michael Goodkind, of the
University medical news bureau,

charged that the accessibility is
sue is unrelated to the mod
ernization plan and that it was
being used by several local doc
tors for "economic and political
gain."
"Even the doctors who had
raised some objections said that
no reasonable person could op
pose the plan," he said.
The University is not receiving
any funding from the city for the
project. However, Dr. Lawrence
Crowley, University vice-presi
dent for medical affairs, said the
city's endorsement is essential to
the University's application for a
certificate of need (CON) for the
modernization project. The
Health Systems Agency, which
must approve the expansion, re
quires evidence of community
support.
While agreeing that the ac
cessibility issue is a factor, Palo
Alto City Councilman Larry
Klein contended that such an is
sue is separate from the actual
modernization plan and he does
not forsee any significant delay
in the council's endorsement.
Klein said he did not know how a
delayed or denied endorsement
would effect the outcome of the
project.
Klein said he did not feel eco
nomics provided the main

motivation in the access issue.
"Yes, there are economic con
siderations here," he said. "I
don't think the economic issues
are at the forefront. I think the
discussion at the present time is
how access should be defined."
Crowley did not feel that the
endorsement was in question,
merely the timing of the en
dorsement. He said that the most
probable effect of a delayed en
dorsement would be a delay in
construction.
According to the University,
the plan is designed to bring the
hospital facilities up to the stan
dards required of a modern
teaching and research center,
while providing the surrounding
community with improved
health care.
The plan has been broken into
three main phases. The first
phase entails construction, in
which "shell" space from the
1976 hospital addition will be
completed. As well, phase one
includes remodeling the areas
adjacent to the shell, and the
enclosure Galeria (dining area).
Phase one itself will provide
some 87,000 additional gross
square feet to the hospital com
plex.
Phase two entails construction

of new nursing areas, and re
locating medical/surgical beds,
as well as diagnostic and treat
ment areas. The proposed con
struction will provide approx
imately 358,000 gross square
feet.
Phase three calls for remodel
ing areas in theexisting hospital.
The current outline is in the
schematic stage. The final
documentation will be com
pleted in 1984, and will allow for
differing departmental needs
and changes occurring before
then. Tentatively, phase three
will provide an additional
140,000 gross square feet.
The schematic plans call for
the project to be built according
to these three phases using one
Certificate of Need application,
which will be submitted to the
Health Systems Agency of Santa
Clara County for permission to
modify and augment the present
plan.
Also, the plan calls for the
merger of the children's hospital
with the main facility, as re
ported in last week's Daiiy. Doc
tors have lobbied and petitioned
the city council to withhold en
dorsement until a more feasible
ruling for access can be estab
lished.
