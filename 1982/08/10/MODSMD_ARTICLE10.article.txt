Article distorts facts
I am both surprised and disap
pointed in the editors of the Dai
ly. Following the interview on
which your article, "Fulbright
Scholar to Study in Africa" (Dai
ly, Aug. 6), was based it was my
understanding that your re
porter had both facts and names
straight. Since Africa is (regret
fully) still too little known to
scholarly communities and to
Americans in general, I re
quested that in everyone's best
interests the editors review the
article with me before publica
tion.
My concern for informative
accuracy was subsequently re
paid with work that I find an em
barrassment to myself, to the
Daily, and to the intellectual
community it purports to repre
sent and serve.
For the record: I stated that
Togo was on the southern coast
of West Africa; this appeared as
"a little-known area of south
western Africa." (Namibia?) In
the hope of reducing a common

stereotype of Africans as a bunch
of Idi Amins, I mentioned that
the Togolese — while peaceful
and easy-going — are as en
terprising in their daily lives and
as enthusiastic about such things
as sports and comrr unity life, as
people anywhere in the world.
This gives a far different image to
readers than "They are really en
thusiastic about their soccer
games. They (?) are really en
joyable." The latter depicts nit
wit sports nuts rather than re
sponsible, friendly human
beings.
Responsible journalism could
do much to enhance our knowl
edge of distant lands and peo
ples, already too often mis
represented and misun
derstood. I hope that you will at
least set the facts straight (by the
way, Lome is the capital and Ewe
is spoken in the South), and at
best recognize the potential of
your press to educate ... or to
mislead.
