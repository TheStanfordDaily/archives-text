## Israeli soldiers lead opposition to war 
### 
The Israeli invasion of Leba
non has raised severe moral
problems for many Israelis, es
pecially amongst the soldiers. In
fact, the opposition to the war is
lead by reservists who actually
took part in the fighting.
A group of 92 soldiers pub
lished an open letter expressing
their distrust of Minister of Se
curity Ariel Sharon, and deman
ding his immediate resignation.
In their letter they write: "...
We were used cynically as a tool
to achieve objectives that had
nothing to do with those men
tioned by Mr. Begin in the
Knesset. These objectives were
achieved with a total disregard
for human lives and values."
( Ha'aretz, July 2)
Another group of 200 re
servists explain their opposition*
to the objectives of the invasion

in a letter to Menachem Begin in
which they demand to be re
leased from service in Lebanon:
"In this war you are trying to
achieve a military solution to the
Palestinian problem, but there is
no military solution to the prob
lem of a nation. You are trying to
enforce a 'new order' upon the
ruins of Lebanon. You are spill
ing our blood and the blood of
others for the sake of the
Phalangists. We were not drafted
for this. You lied to us.. . instead
of peace in the Galilee you have
involved us in a never-ending
war." (Ha'aretzJuly 16)
These soldiers are dis
illusioned and bitter. The
massive civilian casualties, the
wanton destruction of property,
and the daily contact with devas
tated survivors have been a se
vere shock. The unprecedented
military censorship about the ex
tent of the destruction, repeated
Israeli violations of cease-fire
agreements, and the ever chang
ing objectives of the invasion
have destroyed government
credibility.
Soldiers from a commando
unit wrote to Begin: "We were
tricked and called upon to fight
in the first war in Israel's history
that was for defense, but was a
dangerous gamble for political
purposes." (Ha'aretz, July 9)
Others wrote: "We have killed
too many and too many of us
have been killed. We have con
quered too much, bombed too
much and destroyed too much."
{Ha'aretz, July 16)

A group of reservists have
formed a group called "Soldiers
Against Silence" and have prom
ised to reveal the atrocities per
formed during the invasion.

The peace movement in Israel
has demanded the resignation of
Sharon, a withdrawal of troops
from Lebanon, and for diplomat
ic negotiations to resolve the key
issue — self-determination for
the Palestinian people. In the
words of a high-ranking officer
in the tank corps, writing from
Beirut to the organizers of a
demonstration in Tel-Aviv
(100,000 demonstrators): "Now
is the time, maybe our last
chance, to recognize the PLO.
Only political recognition will
put us on the right road toward a
solution of the-Palestinian prob
lem." (Ha'aretz, July 2)
The peace movement main
tains that the invasion is directly
connected to the government's
efforts to annex the West Bank.
The government hoped: 1) to di
vert world attention from what
was happening on the West
Bank; and 2) that by destroying
the PLO, they could crush the
determined opposition of West
Bank Palestinians to the annexa
tion. The peace movement has
protested that these goals are
impossible to achieve, the
means inhuman, and the price
so far, on both sides, has been
too high.
The peace movement is des
perately trying to return sanity to
the Zionist movement. Its sup
porters are loyal soldiers, who
are willing to risk their lives for
the defense of Israel — but not
to crush other nations. More
than 200,000 Israelis have pro
tested the invasion and more are
joining daily as the toll rises in
Lebanon.
