# Renaissance hits 20th-century Calif.
## 
### Karen Springen 
It's the weekend, you've got a
full tank of gas, and you want to
do something a little out of the
ordinary — how about going to
the Renaissance Pleasure Faire?
Novato, a small town about an
hour and a half away from the
University, is hosting the 16th
annual fair this year.
For those who want a change
from the present, the fair recre
ates 16th-century England. Not
everything is authentic — water
ice, tarot, astrology and a cof
feehouse are slightly out of sync
— but no one seems to mind.
Prices also do not reflect the 16th
century — a 20-minutd astrology
session goes for $20 (including a
chart).

Despite the high prices, the
fair is non-elitist: actors and fair
visitors range from "peasants" to
"queens" (and the parking lot
includes a good mix of pick-up
trucks and BMWs!).
One recommendation unless
you want to feel mundane: it's
the custom for both workers and
visitors to dress in costume and
to speak with an old-English ac
cent.
The faire features crafts by
more than 1000 artists.
Craftsmen include weavers, gold
and silversmiths,
leatherworkers, stonecarvers,
clothworkers, pewterers, and
spinners — both of wool and of
stories. Visitors may also make

their own candles, masks and pa
per at participation booths.
Food is abundant in 16th-cen
tury style but not always authen
tic.
Games range from a tradi
tional tug of war to a rope bal
ance test rewarded by a kiss from
a "lass." Others may want to util
ize baseball skills to "dunk a
monk."
Events include a 16th-century
Grand Elizabethan Tournament
of Horses. Monty Python fans re
joice — the humorous at
mosphere of the tournament
and other events are reminiscent
of the Holy Grail.

Jugglers, musicians, dancers
and many other entertainers
roam the fair grounds. More
than 2000 costumed actors
donate their time and energy to
the event.
The Renaissance Pleasure
Faire is open from 9 a.m. to 6
p.m. weekends, Aug. 7 through
Sept. 12, including Labor Day.
To get there: take highway 101
across the Golden Gate to high
way 37. Turn off at the Black
point exit. Remember to note
your parking area — more than
20,000 visitors come each day.
The Faire is produced by the
Living History Center, a non
profit corporation.
