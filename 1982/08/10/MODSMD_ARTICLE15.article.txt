# Renaissance hits 20th-century Calif.

It's the weekend, you've got a
full tank of gas, and you want to
do something a little out of the
ordinary — how about going to
the Renaissance Pleasure Faire?
Novato, a small town about an
hour and a half away from the
University, is hosting the 16th
annual fair this year.
For those who want a change
from the present, the fair recre
ates 16th-century England. Not
everything is authentic — water
ice, tarot, astrology and a cof
feehouse are slightly out of sync
— but no one seems to mind.
Prices also do not reflect the 16th
century — a 20-minutd astrology
session goes for $20 (including a
chart).

Despite the high prices, the
fair is non-elitist: actors and fair
visitors range from "peasants" to
"queens" (and the parking lot
includes a good mix of pick-up
trucks and BMWs!).
One recommendation unless
you want to feel mundane: it's
the custom for both workers and
visitors to dress in costume and
to speak with an old-English ac
cent.
The faire features crafts by
more than 1000 artists.
Craftsmen include weavers, gold
and silversmiths,
leatherworkers, stonecarvers,
clothworkers, pewterers, and
spinners — both of wool and of
stories. Visitors may also make
