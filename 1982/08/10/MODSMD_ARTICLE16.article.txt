# Russian artist exhibits 'subversive' work
## 
### Jane Bailie 
I hose unfamiliar with the work of soviet artist Mihail
Chemiakin, which is featured at the Faculty Club and
Tresidder Union this month, might initially see his paint
ings as lost mythical frescoes of the pre-classical world.
Chemiakin, one of several Soviet artists Uving in exile
in the west, is known for a style frequently termed
"metaphysical synthesism." J \
It takes a few minutes of contemplation before the
viewer is able to recognize the aifegorical, ritualistic and
symbolic characters which seem to weave themelves
into one another in these compositions. Much of
Chemiakin's work may appear to express no obvious
message. His frequent use of vibrant colors arid flowing,
almost shapeless figrues give the impression of broken
tapestry rather than what the Soviet police considered to
be politically subversive art. ' a
"His paintings are, without question, among the most
exciting avant-garde works on the international scene,"
said art critic Tricia Crane. " ~. Chemiakin is a contem
porary artist with rare strength. His vision of the world is
highly pessimistic; he believes that Civilization has cor
rupted the human spirit."
Chemiakin was born in Moscow in 1943. His father was
in the military and his mother was an actress. In 1957 he
entered the Repine School of Painting, only to be ex
pelled in 1959. In 1961 Chemiakin held various jobs in the
Soviet Union, including handyman at the Hermitage
Museum, mailman and streetsweeper. It was not until
1962 that Chemiakin was actually able to exhibit his art.
By 1966 Chemiakin's work had been exhibited in the
Hermitage Museum and in the Rimsky-Korsakov Con
servatory.
But a feeling of dissatisfaction and suspicion concern
ing his work within the Soviet police was mounting.
Several times members of the KGB came to

Chemiakin's exhibits. Chemiakin said they explained
their interruption with the phrase, "We do like your
work. But we don't understand it."
Chemiakin said, "The whole reaction was lead by the
KGB ... But if one looked deeper, one would see that it
was really a struggle between offical artists and those of
the avant-garde."
Chemiakin left the Soviet Union in 1972 following a
series of vehement attacks on his work by the Soviet gov\
ernment. He said that for an avant-garde artist to exhibit
in the Soviet Union, ''You had to have illegal exhibitions
in peoples' apartments. People were usually arrested
there. Once, when I was exhibiting in an apartment in
Moscow, the police came and said that no one could go
in because someone in the building had thf plague.7
He moved first to Paris, where he continued to con
centrate on his art as a full time profession. "Chemiakin
appeared in Pafis at the right time," said art critic Aleksis
Rannit. "He is the most French of the Russian artists,
even more so than Russian-born Frenchmen like Benois
and Lanceray, who contributed a great deal to the St. Pe
tersburg culture of the 20th century.
"Russian by his nationality, French By his place in art,
Chemiakin is today the new prince of Paris ... Like his
predecessor, Jean Cocteau, he is an elegant exhibi
tionist; like Cocteau, he possesses a kind of Raphaelic
immateriality of style; and like Cocteau, he is brilliant
and lucid, but at the same time mystifies and of course,
hides himself behind the mask of a saltimbanque. His
message, too, is a message to a cultured society, and his
mission, however hieratic he may become, is not unlike
Cocteau's — to give pleasure and to surprise."
Chemiakin found his principal rivals to be not the
KGB, but the "Offical Artists," a term used by the Soviet
government which he defines as those artists who were
"strict to the mean of social realism. Also, membership in

the Communist party is important. Their works have to
be opt ijnistic. Usually in the Soviet Union, art is part of
the ideological front and that's why people who fit into
the social realism are considered to be representative of
the ideology.
"The Soviet Union is not afraid of modern art," said
Chemiakin. "Because after the Revolution there were
excellent artists of the avant-garde in Russia."
But according to gallery owner Eduard Nakamkin,
there is a different aspect to the Soviets' acceptance of
artists of the avant-garde. "The repression of the work of
these artists is part of the Russian tradition. Kandinksy,
Chagall and other great Russian painters also had to
leave their homeland before they became great."
Chemiakin is presently living in New York, which he
terms "the most snobbish city in the United States." He is
quick to point out analogies between the Soviet police
and the"Artistic Mafia" of New York.
/"They have a lot in common. In both Mafias money
plays a significant role. In New York, an entrepreneur
adopts a painter or painters and invests a lot of money in
advertising them. Once they (gallery owners and en
trepreneurs) have their own group of painters and
critics, they don't have to accept others; not because
they (the artists) are not interesting, but they've already
invested enough money in other artists...
"The critics are tied with the politics of the galleries,"
said Chemiakin. "Here in America, politics plays a signif
icant role. They are very aware of the conflicts in Europe.
America is a young nation and they don't have significant
rules. The French, to the contrary, are considered to
have extensive rules. They're not worried about
criticism. If a Frenchmen likes it (anartwork), he buys it."
Chemiakin said he relies upon his personal interpreta
tion of religious and ancient primitive issues and cul
tures, which are the principal subjects in his work.

tionist; like Cocteau, he possesses a kind of Raphaelic
immateriality of style; and like Cocteau, he is brilliant
and lucid, but at the same time mystifies and of course,
hides himself behind the mask of a saltimbanque. His
message, too, is a message to a cultured society, and his
mission, however hieratic he may become, is not unlike
Cocteau's — to give pleasure and to surprise."
Chemiakin found his principal rivals to be not the
KGB, but the "Offical Artists," a term used by the Soviet
government which he defines as those artists who were
"strict to the mean of social realism. Also, membership in

the Communist party is important. Their works have to
be opt ijnistic. Usually in the Soviet Union, art is part of
the ideological front and that's why people who fit into
the social realism are considered to be representative of
the ideology.
"The Soviet Union is not afraid of modern art," said
Chemiakin. "Because after the Revolution there were
excellent artists of the avant-garde in Russia."
But according to gallery owner Eduard Nakamkin,
there is a different aspect to the Soviets' acceptance of
artists of the avant-garde. "The repression of the work of
these artists is part of the Russian tradition. Kandinksy,
Chagall and other great Russian painters also had to
leave their homeland before they became great."
Chemiakin is presently living in New York, which he
terms "the most snobbish city in the United States." He is
quick to point out analogies between the Soviet police
and the"Artistic Mafia" of New York.
/"They have a lot in common. In both Mafias money
plays a significant role. In New York, an entrepreneur
adopts a painter or painters and invests a lot of money in
advertising them. Once they (gallery owners and en
trepreneurs) have their own group of painters and
critics, they don't have to accept others; not because
they (the artists) are not interesting, but they've already
invested enough money in other artists...
"The critics are tied with the politics of the galleries,"
said Chemiakin. "Here in America, politics plays a signif
icant role. They are very aware of the conflicts in Europe.
America is a young nation and they don't have significant
rules. The French, to the contrary, are considered to
have extensive rules. They're not worried about
criticism. If a Frenchmen likes it (anartwork), he buys it."
Chemiakin said he relies upon his personal interpreta
tion of religious and ancient primitive issues and cul
tures, which are the principal subjects in his work.
I hose unfamiliar with the work of soviet artist Mihail
Chemiakin, which is featured at the Faculty Club and
Tresidder Union this month, might initially see his paint
ings as lost mythical frescoes of the pre-classical world.
Chemiakin, one of several Soviet artists Uving in exile
in the west, is known for a style frequently termed
"metaphysical synthesism." J \
It takes a few minutes of contemplation before the
viewer is able to recognize the aifegorical, ritualistic and
symbolic characters which seem to weave themelves
into one another in these compositions. Much of
Chemiakin's work may appear to express no obvious
message. His frequent use of vibrant colors arid flowing,
almost shapeless figrues give the impression of broken
tapestry rather than what the Soviet police considered to
be politically subversive art. ' a
"His paintings are, without question, among the most
exciting avant-garde works on the international scene,"
said art critic Tricia Crane. " ~. Chemiakin is a contem
porary artist with rare strength. His vision of the world is
highly pessimistic; he believes that Civilization has cor
rupted the human spirit."
Chemiakin was born in Moscow in 1943. His father was
in the military and his mother was an actress. In 1957 he
entered the Repine School of Painting, only to be ex
pelled in 1959. In 1961 Chemiakin held various jobs in the
Soviet Union, including handyman at the Hermitage
Museum, mailman and streetsweeper. It was not until
1962 that Chemiakin was actually able to exhibit his art.
By 1966 Chemiakin's work had been exhibited in the
Hermitage Museum and in the Rimsky-Korsakov Con
servatory.
But a feeling of dissatisfaction and suspicion concern
ing his work within the Soviet police was mounting.
Several times members of the KGB came to

Chemiakin's exhibits. Chemiakin said they explained
their interruption with the phrase, "We do like your
work. But we don't understand it."
Chemiakin said, "The whole reaction was lead by the
KGB ... But if one looked deeper, one would see that it
was really a struggle between offical artists and those of
the avant-garde."
Chemiakin left the Soviet Union in 1972 following a
series of vehement attacks on his work by the Soviet gov\
ernment. He said that for an avant-garde artist to exhibit
in the Soviet Union, ''You had to have illegal exhibitions
in peoples' apartments. People were usually arrested
there. Once, when I was exhibiting in an apartment in
Moscow, the police came and said that no one could go
in because someone in the building had thf plague.7
He moved first to Paris, where he continued to con
centrate on his art as a full time profession. "Chemiakin
appeared in Pafis at the right time," said art critic Aleksis
Rannit. "He is the most French of the Russian artists,
even more so than Russian-born Frenchmen like Benois
and Lanceray, who contributed a great deal to the St. Pe
tersburg culture of the 20th century.
"Russian by his nationality, French By his place in art,
Chemiakin is today the new prince of Paris ... Like his
predecessor, Jean Cocteau, he is an elegant exhibi
tionist; like Cocteau, he possesses a kind of Raphaelic
immateriality of style; and like Cocteau, he is brilliant
