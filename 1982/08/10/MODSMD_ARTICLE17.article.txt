## New Zealand 'Palace,' South Pole malice 
### Steve Vineberg 
'Smash Palace'
In the first-rate New Zealand
film Smash Palace, scripted and
directed by Roger Donaldson,
two decent married people, Al
and Jackie Shaw (Bruno Law
rence and Anna Jemison), split
up after nearly a decade. She is
better educated and finds their
backwater existence stifling; his
response to the sour notes in
their marriage is to plunge
himself into his work — he reno
vates wrecked cars and races
them — and to allow himself to
drift toward virtual inertia in his
relationship with his wife.
("Smash Palace" is the name of
his auto yard, though its implica
tions for the story of the Shaws
are obvious.) Jackie's aristocratic
hauteur is partly affected, but
she's so sexually charged even in
boredom that we can under
stand what drew Al to her —
there's an element of Lady Chat
terly here — and when we see
them in bed together, their love
play has a desperate ferocity, a
violence that is simultaneously
exciting and frightening. (This is
one of the most illuminating
love scenes in recent movies.)
Jackie walks out on Al, taking
their seven-year-old daughter
Georgie (Greer Robson) with
her, and initiating an affair with
his best friend, Roy (Keith Aber
dein).
Smash Palace covers much of
the same ground as Shoot the
Moon, though Donaldson's style
is very different from Alan
Parker's: he is unselfconscious
to the point of seeming artless
(tn fact, of course, he is highly
skilled), and he derives humor
from Al's awareness of the
absurdity of his own position. Al
has a sharper sense of irony than
George, the husband in Shoot
the Moon — realizing that Roy is

inside the house with Jackie, he
peels off his clothes and stuffs
them through the mailbox, in
sisting that Roy help himself to
his clothes as well as his wife —
but he also has reserves of vio
lence in him and perhaps those
in the audience who had no
sympathy for George will reject
Al, too. Many of my friends told
me they had trouble believing
that the break-up of his family
would drive George to such de
structive extremes, but surely
being locked out of the house he
used to live in with his wife and
being told his daughter refuses
to see him are precisely the kinds
of emotional triggers that can
propel a man into the realm of
the irrational. The greatest virtue
of Smash Palace, I think, is the
clarity with which it chronicles
that process. If Donaldson errs
— aside from including a gratui
tous bit of melodrama involving
a sadistic second cop (Sean Duf
fy) and prolonging the final se
quence an unnecessary seven or
eight minutes — It is in making
Al considerably more sympa
thetic than Jackie. That results
not so much from an indictment
of Jackie (and it certainly isn't
Anna Jemison's fault) as from the
care Donaldson expends on
showing us Al's breakdown, and
from the depth of Bruno Law
rence's performance.
American audiences never get
to see the work of New Zea
landers, and our ignorance of
their movies makes Smash Pal
ace a particular surprise. It's well
acted by all the principals, but
Lawrence is exceptional: he
takes us so far inside Al's agony
that we may feel cheated after
wards, knowing that we're un
likely to see much of Lawrence's
other acting over here. His is the
kind of intensity we mif?ht ex
pect from Al Pacino or Dustin
Hoffman or Sean Connery, and

his scenes with little Greer Rob
son somehow combine great
sweetness and terror. How did
Donaldson manage to learn so
much about the way a small child
responds to the nightmare of her
parents' crumbling marriage —
and how did he ever coax a per
formance so complex out of a
seven-year-old actress? Smash
Palace doesn't linger on
Georgie, yet every moment she's
on screen is a study in bewilder
ment or emotional displace
ment. In one scene, she lies in
bed flicking her flashlight on and
off as Jackie and Al scream at
each other in the next room; in
another, she watches her father
win a race on TV and turns
around to share the thrill with an
empty room. The last shot in the
movie is a close-up of her
scarred face that tells as much as
a whole sequel could.
'Author!'
1982 may be the year of the
child in movies. Children give
wonderful performances in

Shoot the Moon, E.T., Three
Brothers, and the new Smash
Palace from New Zealand. On
the other hand, there are Aileen
Quinn and the Orphans' Chorus
in Annie, and Al Pacino's brood
in Author! Authorl (There's ac
tually one talented kid in Annie

— Rosanne Sorrentino, who
looks like a junior Cindy Wil
liams and has real spunk.) In Au
thor! Authorl, Pacino plays a
gifted playwright whose wife
(Tuesday Weld, inscrutable in an
inscrutable role) leaves him with


Al Pacino and the kids in Authorl Author!
four of her offspring from her
previous marriage as well as one
of his own. The appalling
manner in which these kids have
been shunted back and forth be
tween uncaring parents — only
the saintly writer-hero loves
them — has worked no apparent
damage on any of them: they
comfort themselves with the
wisecracking familiarity of the
children on TV sitcoms. Only
one of them — an overweight
baseball freak named Spike,
played by B. J. Barrie — is even

halfway possible; Igor, the
oldest (Eric Gurry), is a steal from
A Thousand Clowns.
Pacino isn't really at home in
the role of the New Sensitive
Father; the darker notes he usu
ally brings to his acting are miss
ing here. Since Ivan Trevalian,
the character he plays, is (in
part, at least) a counterpart for
the screenwriter, Israel Horo
vitz, his benevolence is uncom
fortably self-congratulatory.
The Thing'
John Carpenter earned points

by keeping the violence off
screen in his ghost story The Fog,
but Escape from New York,
which he brought out last sum
mer, was unusually nasty, and his
new remake of the '50s sci-fi
thriller The Thing puts him
beyond the It's a real stom
ach-churner about a crew of sci
entists in the Antarctic who bat
tle an extra-terrestrial intruder,
long buried under ice, that takes
on the s+iape of whatever
creature it preys on. The idea in
this version (the men don't know
who's human and who's not, so

their community begins to fall
apart) is intriguing, if hardly nov
el: a famous Twilight Zone
episode attempted something
similar, and of course it contains
echoes of the two Invasion of the
Body Snatchers movies.
Carpenter and the screenwriter,
Bill Lancaster, have furnished
the men with individual idiosyn
crasies such as a mania for roller
skates or a predilection for dope
or J. & 8., but they forgot to
make them likable. And even ac
tors like Kurt Russell, T. K. Carter
and Thomas Waites, who have all

shown talent in the past, can't do
much when they're being con
stantly upstaged by the most
elaborate body-bursting effects
since Brian De Palma tore John
Cassavetes apart at the end of
The Fury. Carpenter lacks De
Palma's wit — it's hard to think of
a horror film director with less —
so we're asked to take scene af
ter gruesome scene straight.
And all the while Ennio Mor
ricone's monotonous score
pounds mercilessly away. I can
think of more enjoyable ways to
get a headache.
