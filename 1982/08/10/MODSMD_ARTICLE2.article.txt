# Zschau calls for end to deficits
## 
### Ray Newman 
12th District Republican con
gressional candidate Ed Zschau
stressed yesterday in a Daily in
terview that repeated federal
deficits are the "root cause" of
the nation's economic and un
employment problems, and said
also that the United States will
need an armed forces draft in
the future.
Zschau, who received an
MBA, an M.S. in Statistics, and
Ph.D. in Business from Stanford,
also spoke last night with about
35 people in Trancos lounge in
Wilbur Hall. He came to campus
at the request of student Scott
Barker, although Stanford and
Palo Alto are not in the 12th
Congressional district.
Zschau is running against
Democrat Emmett Lynch for the
seat vacated by Pete McCloskey.
Zschau said that Congress
should deal with unemploy
ment, now at a 41-year high, by
controlling federal budget defi
cits and also by "softening the
blow" of unemployment
through a 12- or 26-week ex
tension of unemployment bene
fits.
Zschau said Congress should
"focus on the root cause of the
problem, which in my opinion
has been the continued govern
ment deficits. It is very important
that we don't think that un
employment benefits are the
solution to the problem."
The housing and auto in
dustries, which Zschau said are
suffering because of the federal
budget deficits and correspond
ing high interest rates, "aren't
going to recover until interest
goes down," he said.
Zschau said that spending cuts
need to be made in what he says
is the 75 percent of the budget,
including defense and entitle
ments programs, that Congress
has "put off limits."
Congress could cut "another
$10 billion to $15 billion" out of
the 1983 defense budget, Zschau
said. He proposed that Congress
"challenge" the defense depart
ment, and tell them "here's what
you have to spend, tell me how
we're going to achieve our ob
jectives with that amount."
Specifically, Zschau said that
the B-1 bomber and large nucle
ar-powered aircraft carriers
"should be examined."
Entitlements programs "have
been over-indexed for the past
several years," Zschau said. He
said that the indexing formula,

which ties increases in benefits
to the Consumer Price Index,
should be re-evaluated.
The indexing issue should be
come less important as inflation
decreases, Zschau said.
"Through bringing down infla
tion as we have ... (we) have
made the cost of living adjust
ment less important," he said.
On another issue, Zschau said
that he supported a policy of
"national service," similar to that
proposed by McCloskey, that
would require youths to serve in
the regular army, in reserve
armed forces units, or as com
munity volunteers.
"I think that we're going to
have to have a draft in the
future," Zschau said. "The all
volunteer army is not working.
The capablity of the all-volun
teer army seems to be below that
that we had before."
Other reasons that he sup
ports a "national service" policy
are considerations of cost and
the possibility that an un
representative all-volunteer
force might leave decision
makers in Washington without
children in the armed forces.
"You may come to a point where
all the decision makers don't
have sons or daughters in the
army, don't have a personal
stake in the armed forces," he
said.
Zschau also supported the re
cently passed law that requires
students who are subject to reg
istration and receiving federal
student aid to file signed
statements stating that they had
indeed registered.
"One can say that It's dis
criminatory against poor stu
dents, but it's also to their advan
tage... they're the ones getting
the help" from the federal stu
dent aid programs, Zschau said.
