Israelis launch massive attack
Beirut — The Israelis launched a massive air and artil
lery attack against Palestinian guerrilla positions yester
day, while negotiators waited for Jerusalem's reply to a
U.S. plan to end the siege of the capital.
The-day began with Israelis and Palestine Liberation
Organization guerrillas exchanging fire in the southern
suburbs and at the major crossing points between mostly
Moslem West Beirut and Christian East Beirut.
In the early afternoon, Israeli warplanes struck first at
Palestinian artillery positions near the Syrian-controlled
village of Tarshish, about 30 miles east of Beirut.
The planes then assaulted Beirut, where a three-hour
air attack in the late afternoon left the southern part of
the city under a pall of dense, black smoke. The Israelis
said the air attack was in retaliation for cease-fire vio
lations in and around Beirut, where the PLO has been
trapped since June 13.
But there was some speculation here that the intensity
of the air raid may have been directly related to the kill
ing of six people yesterday at a restaurant in the Jewish
quarter of Paris. The PLO representative in Paris
deplored the shooting and said his organization had
nothing to do with it, however.
Saeb Salaam, the former Lebanese premier partici
pating in the negotiations to evacuate the PLO from
Beirut, said that the air raids and ground fire were in
tended to keep the military pressure on the PLO fighters
while the search for a final compromise continued.
Hinckley to remain in hospital
Washington — A federal judge yesterday ordered
John Hinckley committed to a mental institution for an
indefinite period after psychiatrists reported that the
presidential assailant is "unpredictably dangerous" and
obsessed with thoughts of killing actress Jodie Foster.
Hinckley, looking pale and heavier in his first
courtroom appearance since June 21, when he was
found not guilty by reason of insanity of shooting Presi
dent Ronald Reagan and three others on March 30,1981,
told U.S. District Judge Barrington Parker that he volun
tarily waived his right to a hearing to determine whether
he should be released from St. Elizabeths Hospital, the
federal mental institution where he has been confined
since his acquittal.
He also asked that the court make public the hospital
medical report assessing his mental condition, although
he said he did not totally agree with its conclusions.
"I would like to say for the record that by signing these
waivers, I am not admitting or agreeing to what is in the
report," he said, standing before the judge, flanked by
his attorneys and U.S. marshals.
The report, which had been sealed by the court since
its delivery to the judge Aug. 2, said that Hinckley is suf
fering from a "severe, chronic mental disorder." It
diagnosed him as having a "schizotypal" personality, a
condition less severe than schizophrenia, characterized
by "magical thinking."
"His basic character structure is essentially unchanged
since the time of the shooting," the report said. "He is
still preoccupied with Jodie Foster, still plans to harm her
and-or himself, still believes they will be united. He has
said that the movie (Taxi Driver) is over, but... without
treatment, he may set up another 'movie' as a guiding
principle of his life."
Parisian attack called 'anti-Semitic'
Paris — Six persons died and 22 were wounded yester
day when gunmen bombed and shot up the best-known
Jewish restaurant in Paris.
The attack on Jo Goldenberg's restuarant was im

mediately denounced by the French government as anti-
Semitic.
But Israel blamed the French authorities and media,
saying they had inflamed passions over Lebanon.
When President Francois Mitterrand attended a
synagogue memorial service for the victims yesterday
night, he was heckled by demonstrators.
Goldenberg's is in the Marais district, now fashionably
bohemian but seven centuries ago the city's Jewish ghet
to. It is still the main Jewish quarter in Paris.
Reports on how the violence erupted were conflict
ing. Some eyewitnesses saying there were four gunmen,
while others reported five.
The attackers were in two groups. A member of one
group tossed a Czechoslovak-made hand grenade
through a window of the restaurant, and then the second
group went in firing machine pistols.
Three women and three men died in the attack.
Among the wounded was a plainclothes poiiceman hit
by buckshot from a shotgun fired by Marko Goldenberg,
one of the proprietor's sons, who mistook the policeman
for one of the gunmen.
"Blind violence" was the comment later of the head of
the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO) bureau in
paris, Ibrahim Suss.
Suss said the PLO deplored the shooting of "innocent
victims and sends its condolences to their families."
Israeli jets harry U.S. copters
Washington — An Israeli F-16 jet fighter repeatedly
and closely buzzed two U.S. helicopters in one of three
incidents of harassment of an American military liaison
team in the Lebanon area over the weekend, Reagan ad
ministration sources said yesterday.
Officials described the incidents Saturday and Sunday
as "very serious" even though no shots were fired and
none of the American military personnel were harmed,
so far as could be determined here.
A spokesman at the Israeli embassy in Washington,
Benjamin Abileah, said, "There were problems of com
munication and coordination of flights in the area. The
problem has been solved."
Abileah said he was not denying the report, but said
details would have to come from the Pentagon. There
was no immediate comment from the White House,
State or Defense Departments.
The reported harassment seemed certain to deepen
tensions between the United States and Israel at a time
when Israel is under strong criticism in Congress and
elsewhere for its invasion of southern Lebanon and its
bombings and shellings of Beirut, where Palestine Liber
ation Organization fighters are trapped.
The incidents were the first known encounters be
tween U.S. and Israeli military elements since Israeli jet
fighters and torpedo boats wrecked the U.S. spy ship Lib
erty off the Sinai Peninsula during the 1967 Arab-Israeli
war. The Israeli government apologized for that attack,
which it claimed was accidental.
While declining to respond to the weekend incidents,
the State Department expressed confidence that a nego
tiated solution for PLO evacuation of West Beirut can be
arranged if the cease-fire between Israel and Palestinian
forces holds. "It is our view that there is momentum,"
said spokesman Alan Romberg.
Begin grants Habib more time
Israeli Prime Minister Menachem Begin said yesterday
American mediator Philip Habib could have more time
to arrange a peaceful end to the siege of Beirut, but he
did not specify how long Israel was willing to wait for
more negotiations.
As Begin spoke, Israel resumed its military pressure on

the Palestinian forces, launching artillery barrages and
air raids on the besieged capital.
Begin, in a speech reported by Israeli radio, criticized
Arab states for not offering refuge to Palestine Liberation
Organization fighters. He complained that while Israel
faces heavy criticism for its invasion of Lebanon, "the
world has not expressed its outrage over the Arab
stand."
In the Beirut suburb of Baabda, Habib met with Leba
nese officials amid optimistic predictions that a with
drawal couid begin this week.
Lebanese mediator Saeb Salam said the government
would soon formally request that France, Italy and jhe
United States contribute troops to the peacekeeping
force that is supposed to step between the Palestinians
and the Israelis during the withdrawal.
"Everything will be arranged ... Having had the de
termination of the Palestinians to leave and the accep
tance (by Israel) of the international forces to come over,
everything will be ironed out. I can assure you of this,"
Salam said.
Sources close to the PLO said the first group of guer
rillas would be ready to leave Beirut tomorrow on French
ships headed for Jordan, Jordan has agreed to take those
fighters with Jordanian passports.
Reagan calls for reduced busing
Washington — The Reagan administration called yes
terday for scaling back forced busing in a Louisiana
school district where two years ago the Carter adminis
tration had urged substantially more busing to achieve
desegregation.
The Department of Justice's stance on the East Baton
Rouge, La., school district before the U.S. sth Circuit
Court of Appeals marked the first time it has asked an ap
pellate court to reduce school busing that already was
under way.
In urging a turnaround, department lawyers cited the
school board's estimate that 4000 elementary students —
13 percent of the 1980 enrollment — had left the district's
public schools as a result of a white "exodus" to the sub
urbs.
"A desegregation remedy intended to eliminate one
race schools that drives large numbers of students out of
the system can hardly be reckoned effective," William
Bradford Reynolds, assistant attorney general for civil
rights, told the appeals court.
Without reference to the 1980 election of President
Ronald Reagan, who campaigned against court-ordered
busing, the department said that in the two years since it
had urged busing, "we have had occasion to reconsider
the usefulness of mandatory transportation as a de
segregation remedy."
"Parents with the means to withdraw their children
from public school have often done so, leaving behind
public school systems threatened with transformation
into 'the preserve of the disadvantaged of both races,' "
the department said.

At the same time, the department urged the appellate
court to uphold a lower court ruling that the East Baton
Rouge Parish School Board had failed to dismantle its il
legally segregated system.
