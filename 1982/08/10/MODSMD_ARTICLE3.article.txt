# Univ. hosts Pac-10 referees

Talk of birdies and bogies over vodka tonics pre
vails at the patio overlooking the 18th green of the
Stanford Golf Course. It's early Friday evening and
the 75 middle-aged men who just completed 18
holes now relax against the setting sun, drinks in
hand, stories in mouth.
Less than 24 hours later these same men sit quiet
ly in a classroom in the Quad. They no longer stand
with golf clubs looking over their balls, but sit with
pencils scrutinizing an exam.
These men are all part of the three-day Pacific-10
Football Officials Clinic, held each year here at the
University. The 75 participants come from all over
the West Coast to discuss the rules they enforce in
the autumn months and they still have time to play
a round or two on the University's famed golf
course.
"It's the start of the season," said Frank "Doc"
Jones, a retired offical. "It's really getting yourself
set mentally and physically for the season."
The officials, housed in Toyon Hall by the Con
ference Office, prepare for the autumn season in
two frames of mind: relaxed and serious.
The first day of the conference consisted of an
informal golf tournament, compliments of the
Stanford Golf Course, a cocktail party and a
barbeque.

Hightlighting Saturday's activities was the 100-
question rules exam, taken by all the officials. Each
year an official in the Pac-10 is given a rating com
posed of three elements: coaches' evaluations,
observer's evaluations and exam score. Those of
ficials with the lowest rankings are sometimes dis
missed.
Most of the officials felt it essential to have both
a relaxed and serious atmosphere present at the
three-day conference. "It's important for the of
ficials to meet one another," one said.
"I'm sure just about everyone here knows each
other," said rookie official Jim Rinne. "Generally, I
think everybody here gets along with everybody
else."
Such camaraderie is especialy important this
year, as the Pac-10 will be using "crews" of officials
for the first time. A typical crew will have a nine
game schedule with three of those games set aside
for the younger, less-experienced officials to have
a chance to move onto the field from the alternate
position they usually occupy.
The Pac-10 Officials Clinic also gives the referees
a chance to catch their breath before another pres
sure packed season. "You just have to get ac
customed to large crowds (in the Pac-10)," one of
ficial said. "After a while you don't worry about it.
They (the crowd) are just a lot of noise "
