## Hinckley case revives en old controversy Lawyers' conclave debates insanity defense 
### 
San Francisco (AP) — Debate
over the insanity defense, given
new prominence by the case of
presidential assailant john
Hinckley Jr., found a receptive, if
small, forum among convention
ing lawyers Sunday.
Less than 100 of the 9000 law
yers attending the American Bar
Association convention here lis
tened to lawyers, law professors
and psychiatrists argue over
whether the defense should
abolished.
University of Santa Clara law
professor George Alexander ad
vocated abolition of the de
fense. "Law doesn't make any
sense at all unless it is based on
free will," he said.
He said juries routinely defeat
the purpose of the insanity de

fense — to free from legal re
sponsibility those people who
did not know they were doing
wrong or could not control
themselves — by finding the
sickest defendants sane and guil
ty.
Such jurors, in effect are
saying "that guy is so crazy that
he better not be turned loose"
— a possibility following acquit
tals by reason of insanity, Alex
ander said.
Idaho Attorney General David
Leroy, whose state abolished the
insanity defense last month,
agreed the issue of insanity is a
confusing one for jurors.
"It's easy to see the system
does not work," Leroy said.

Steven Goldberg, a University
of Minnesota law professor,
urged keeping the defense. "So
ciety must make an effort to de
termine which of its folks are sick

and which are mean," he said.
Bernard Diamond, a former
law professor and now a pro
fessor of clinical psychiatry at the
University of California-San

Francisco, decried the "hysteri
cal abolitionist approach," add
ing that "a serious inquiry into
the issue" is difficult in the wake
of Hinckley's "sensational" case.
