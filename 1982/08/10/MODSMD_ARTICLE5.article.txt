### 
Washington (AP) — Presidential assailant John
Hinckley Jr. is returning to court to tell a federal
judge he will not "at this time" seek release from a
hospital where doctors consider him mentally ill
and dangerous.
U.S. District Judge Barrington Parker ordered
Hinckley back into court today, although Hinckley
has agreed in writing to waive a hearing on his re
lease.
The last time he was in Parker's courtroom,
Hinckley stood, tears streaking down his cheeks,
while a jury found him innocent by reason of in
sanity of the March 30,1981, shooting of President
Ronald Reagan and three other men.
That verdict, seven weeks ago today, generated
nationwide outrage and gave new vigor to a con
gressional drive to change the insanity law.
Hinckley, 27, faced life imprisonment if con
victed on charges of attempting to assassinate the

president and assaulting, with intent to kill, Rea
gan, White House Press Secretary James Brady and
two law enforcement officers.
Instead, as required under the law, he was sent
to St. Elizabeths mental hospital in Washington for
evaluation on June 21. The law entitled him to a
hearing within 50 days to determine if he should
remain institutionalized. It was that proceeding
Parker scheduled for today.
Although Hinckley later stated he wouldn't seek
release, prosecutors insisted he be advised in per
son of his right to a hearing and, possibly, a jury
trial to determine his continuing commitment.
Even after today's hearing, Hinckley has the legal
right to petition the court every six months for his
release, with the determining issue to be whether
he is mentally ill and dangerous to himself and oth
ers.
