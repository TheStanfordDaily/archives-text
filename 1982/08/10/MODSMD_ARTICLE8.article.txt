# Governors' revised federalism
## 
### 
Alton, Okla. (AP) — A resolution calling on the
nation's governors to develop their own plan for
putting "new federalism" in action, with or
without President Ronald Reagan's cooperation
was adopted Sunday by the executive committee
of the National Governors' Association.
The resolution, which will be presented today to
all the governors for approval, called on the as
sociation to "assume responsibility for working
with Congress toward enactment of a federalism
reform initiative that incorporates the historic
principles of the National Governors' Association
respecting federalism."
The action reflected the view of Republican
Gov. Richard Snelling of Vermont, chairman of the
association and one of six governors who has been
negotiating with the White House in search of a
"new federalism" compromise on such critical
areas as welfare and Medicaid.
Reagan wants the states to pay $8.1 billion Wash
ington now contributes for Aid to Families with
Dependent Children as well as take over 30 other
federal programs costing $30.7 billion.

In exchange, the federal government would
save the states $18.3 billion by taking over most of
Medicaid. Washington also would create a $20.4
billion trust fund to help the states through an
eight-year transition period.
The governors traditionally have advocated a
federal takeover of the welfare programs Reagan
wants shifted to the states.
"Something more is required than a continua
tion of the present process," Snelling told a meet
ing of the executive committee.
"I am convinced that we must forge a plan that
we can present to the Congress, hopefully with the
support of the president," the Vermont governor
added.
Both Snelling'and Gov. Scott Matheson of Utah,
who soon will succeed Snelling as association
chairman, expressed their commitment to con
tinue efforts to reach a compromise with the White
House.
The executive committee action was taken on
the opening day of the association's annual three
day summer meeting.
