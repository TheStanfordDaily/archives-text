## Viewpoint/Glen and Shearer Corporate grip on research is tightening 
### 
Washington — Don't look
now, but the days of the wonder
fully innocent, absent-minded
professor may be gone.
Corporate America now un
derwrites some $200 million
worth of scientific research in
our university laboratories. It
seems many of our once-de
tached scholars are turning into
shrewdly minded Daddy War
bucks' in lab coats.
Examples abound of big busi
nesses' recent efforts to tap the
intellectual wellhead on cam
pus. Exxon plans to spend be
tween $7 million and $8 million
over the next 10 years at the Mas
sachusetts Institute of Technolo
gy alone for studies of new ways
to generate usable gas products.
Meanwhile, computer and
engineering experts at Pit
tsburgh's Carnegie Mellon Uni
versity, backed by more than $5
million from Westinghouse and
Digital Equipment Corp., have
formed a "Robotics Institute" to
offer research on the automated
factory of tomorrow. And Du
Pont and Monsanto have in
vested millions in recombinant

DNA research and other
biotechnological activities at
Harvard and St. Louis' Washing
ton University. The list of big
time corporate-academic mar
riages goes on and on.
Upon first glance, the re
newed spirit of cooperation be
tween the industrial and scholas
tic worlds may seem downright
patriotic. Industrial witch doc
tors have long argued that im
proved research abilities can
help America "reindustrialize"
itself and sustain a dominant
position in the world.
Moreover, with university en
rollment dropping and the fed
eral government retrenching,
faculty members and their assis
tants are understandably willing
to consider corporate stipends
for their laboratory and consult
ing services. In fact, almost 90
percent of all professors in high
tech departments have ex
tramural arrangements of one
sort or another with commercial
business.
Yet, the federal government
still pays for approximately 80
percent of all university-based

research. Most of the fixed costs
— faculty salaries and equip
ment — are already spoken for
by the time industry comes into
the picture. Corporate dollars, in
other words, go an ex
traordinarily long way in direct
ing research priorities.
But perhaps the more signifi
cant question is whether pro
fessors or the public realize the
extent to which academia is be
coming just another corporate
subsidiary.
In their book, The Regulation
Came, Bruce Owen and Ronald
Braevtigan warn businessmen
that co-optation of academics
with research grants and consult
ing arrangements "must not be
done too blatantly, for the ex
perts themselves must not rec
ognize that they have lost their
objectivity and freedom of ac
tion."
Taxpayers are similarly
blinded by the undue credibility
carried by the mere names of
some research centers. "We
always hear about how a product
has been tested at a 'major re
search university'; and we tend
to believe that whatever goes on
behind the laboratory doors is
OK and for the good of society,"

Meyerhoff told our reporter,
John Riccardi. "But who's to say
that research into the auto
mation of the assembly line is in
the best interests of our socie
ty?"
Indeed, public objections to
corporate-academic marriages
have been largely stifled, if not
completely ignored. While more
prescient academicians such as
Harvard president Derek Bok
are finally confronting some
conflict-of-interest questions,
leaders of Stanford's unusual
conference on the corporate
connection closed their meeting
to the public. Labor, consumer
and environmental groups,
which have been slow to suggest
how universities' resources
could be put to better use, have
been rarely seen or heard.
From the student's per
spective, the corporate campus
takeover may be barely notice
able this fall. But when most pro
fessors begin wearing pin
striped suits and curtail their of
fice hours, it may be time to take
a look at this dirty business.
