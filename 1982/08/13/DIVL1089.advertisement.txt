BEFORE
YOU MAKE A COMMITMENT,
TRY LIVING TOGETHER.
Furniture can be pretty beguiling.
Especially when you're sleeping on an air mattress that was a casualty of WWII. Or trying to have an
intimate dinner on a cardboard box.
Well, before you rush into anything, stop by Gran Tree Furniture Rental. We'll show you furniture that will
make you drool. Take as much as you want, for as long as you want. And the minute you get bored with one piece 4
we'll let you trade it in on another.
While it may be the most attractive furniture you've ever seen, it's built with the old-fashioned quality that
would even be approved by mom.
And you can have it for peanuts. We've got month-to-month rental agreements so easy they ought to be
called scholarships. And with a three month minimum rental of $49.00, we'll even give you $25.00 off your first
month's rent.
Of course, as sometimes happens, you start living together, things work out. and you want to make the
arrangement permanent. No problem. We have a 100% purchase option.
