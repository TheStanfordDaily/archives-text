Money (sss) for staying awake.
If you find yourself awake in the hours after midnight and
own your own car, consider driving the Daily the one-half
hour trek to our printer. You would leave usually at 2 a.m.
and, for your troubles, receive $22.50 each night.
If you're interested, drop by the Daily or call 497-4632 —
ask for Richard or Doug.
