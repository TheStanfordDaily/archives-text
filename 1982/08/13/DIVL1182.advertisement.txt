JAY
WEINBERG:
LIVING PROOF
YOUR
- CONTRIBUTIONS
COUNT.
I
These days, Jay
Weinberg's most
difficult battles take
place on the tennis
court. Five years
ago, he had a
different kind of
fight on his hands:
against one of the
toughest forms of
cancer. Cancer
research and
treatment have
made J ay's kind of
recovery possible for
almost 2 million
people. Which
means that your
donations have
helped buy Jay
Weinberg a very
beautiful gift:
his life.
