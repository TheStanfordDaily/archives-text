# LOTS adds new computer, terminals

The purchase of a new computer by the University
should shorten student lines for computers in the LOTS
(Low Overhead Time Sharing) system this fall. The new
computer, a Digital Equipment Corporation (DEC) 2060,
will replace LESS, which was being loaned to LOTS by the
Graduate School of Business last year.
LOTS will install the new $750,000 computer during the
second week of September, according to LOTS Director
Ralph Gorin.
In addition to purchasing the new computer, LOTS is
authorized to install 130 new terminals this year, said
Gorin. About 67 of these terminals will be replacing units
which were installed more than five years ago and 63 will
be additional units, he said. However, space limitations
will dictate the number of new terminals which are ac
tually installed.
Gorin said, "We have not fully formed the plan for de
ciding what terminals will go where. We will have at least
as many terminals at CERAS as we had before."
Bob Knight, manager of LOTS, said the CERAS build
ing now houses 105 terminals.
Vice-Provost Gerald Lieberman said that between 30
and 40 new terminals should be installed in September
and the balance throughout fall quarter.
He said that acquisition of additional space for LOTS in
the CERAS building depends upon the dean of the
School of Education, who must assess the needs of his
department. Lieberman guessed that the dean "will do
as much as he can for LOTS."
Gorin said terminals will be installed gradually. "In
September we will have quite a lot to do getting the com
puter itself installed."

According to Gorin, he first recommended the
purchase of additional equipment in June 1981. The
LOTS Advisory Board formally advised Lieberman, who
oversees funding for LOTS, of its decision.
The Center for information Technology (CIT) pro
posed use of its excess computer capacity to avoid
purchasing the new computer, said Gorin. But its excess
capacity was finished by January and thus proved inade
quate for long-term use, he said.
Lieberman said, "The conclusion was that it would be
better for the University to go out and buy another
DEC-2060."
The Advisory Board considered "what would satisfy
the needs of our students now and their needs in the for
seeable future," he said.
Knight said the new equipment should be sufficient
"in the short-term future," which he defined as three
years. But he said, "Usage expands to fill available facil
ities."
Lieberman agreed. "The more roads you build, the
more cars you get. The more computing you have avail
able free, the more use of the computer... Our aim is to
provide students with enough computing to satisfy their
needs...
"We can use as much computing power as we put up,"
he said. "(But) computing is not a free commodity."
Lieberman stressed that the additional equipment is
"not for Star Wars at LOTS."
Gorin said that the present computer has 80 terminal
ports. About 64 of these are either at CERAS or at Term
an. The remaining 16 are dial-in terminals.
The new DEC-2060 is larger than the LESS computer.
Initially it will support 48 terminals, like LESS, but may be
capable of %, said Gorin. It will have "room for growth,"

he said.
Lieberman said, "This was the time in which we
thought that an expenditure of this magnitude was war
ranted." The GSB computer gave the University an op
portunity to assess how LOTS would work with two com
puters, he said, and the additional computer "went a
long way to solving lots of problems."
Lieberman said the University is exploring several
long-term computer-space options such as putting ter
minals in dorms and in various libraries. But he said, "To
get those terminals in right now, you need to establish a
line from wherever you put them into CERAS and Term
an ... There are some technical problems."
During the past year, LOTS has paid about $75,000 in
cluding equipment upgrades for the use of the GSB com
puter, said Knight.
Knight said the addition of new terminals and the larg
er computer will not affect the amount of computer time
allotted to each student. He said queues should be short
er, if anything, than last spring due to the additional
equipment.
According to Knight, about 4500 students use the com
puter facilities per quarter. About one-third of these
4500 accounts are on LESS and two-thirds are on LOTS.
The discrepancy is due to the larger size of LOTS, he said.
The CIT computer will not be used heavily this fall be
cause of the attention which will be focused on the new
computer, said Knight.
A name contest is being conducted for the new com
puter and the LOTS computer. The LOTS computer is
being renamed because students now associate the
word "LOTS" with the building rather than with the
computer, said Gorin.
