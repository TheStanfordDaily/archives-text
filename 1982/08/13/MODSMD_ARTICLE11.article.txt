## Parking meters unfair to staff 
### 
It came to my attention Mon
day that pay parking meters have
been installed in front of Encina
Hall. I find that innovation to be
iniquitous.
Stanford staff members are al
ready paying for parking stickers
to park on campus — and the
staff members who can least af
ford them, the more junior
members who live too far from
campus to walk or bike and must
drive from the cheaper outlying
communities — are the ones
who frequently do the errands
on-campus in the middle of the
day and cannot easily find park
ing.
It is bad enough to pay for a
sticker and then not be able to
find a place to park if you move
your car during the day, but to
have to pay to park while you are
running an errand to SPO or Will
Call or the Conference Office —
or any of a dozen offices at En
cina — is to add insult to injury.
Stanford Campus is too big to
enable many of the staff mem
bers to do these errands on foot
— I can't afford the time away
from my office to walk from the
Medical Center to the other side
of campusl And Marguerite is
also too slow. To get from my of
fice — even if I catch a bus the in
stant I get to the stop — to En
cina, I must go the long way
around Tresidder and it just
takes too long.
The same problem exists at the
Post Office and Bookstore.
There is no parking nearby. I re
cently changed my postage
meter filling station to the Palo
Alto Post Office from the Stan
ford Post Office because there is
no place near the Post Office to

park legally, and the meter is just
too heavy to carry very far.
As a staff member and former
student who has been on cam
pus for the past 10 years, I be
lieve Stanford has consistently
shown no consideration for staff
members in its parking policies.
Every year it costs more to park,
and, as I said before, the ones
who can least afford it are the
ones who are penalized most —
the ones who have no option but

to drive cars. They are forced to
pay for parking that is not ade
quate, or to risk parking tickets
they can ill afford.
The Parking and Transporta
tion Committee should consider
my concerns and get rid of the
parking meters in front of Encina
— and do something about the
parking situation at Stanford in
general!
