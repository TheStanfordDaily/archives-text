## Shocked and appalled, part II 
### 
Rumor has it that tonight's
Daily is the last of the summer.
Hearing this, I w?. a shocked and
appalled at the thought that the
following questions may have
been asked for the last time.
Questions such as: Tony, why
the hell aren't your pages done
yet? How many stories does Bill
have to write? Who's going to go
get fish and chips? Is Heather
here? Where is she? Is Lebanon
all you care about, Erin? Isn't it
time for munchies? Where's the
cinemadope? Tony went where?
When do I get to do a restaurant
review, Sam? How many ad lines
are changing this week, Paul?
Laurie, would you please go de
velop copy? What's Mary Rose
on? Doesn't anyone ever clean
up around here? Where's to-

day's PTT? How do I do this, Vic?
What's Mary Rose wearing to
night? Where's a fac/staff? Mike,
is it okay if I go home now? Does
Mary Rose want to go to Luv's?
Don't the Dodgers suck? Is Tony
back yet? Mike, have you sent
anything? Does anyone want to
learn to crochet? Can I go home
now? Where's this cutline?
Don't you know anything?
That should give you an idea
of what I'm talking about. And I
hope it gives Karen, Karen, Erin,
Bill, Tony, Jane, Jane, Ray, Neil,
James, Spiro, Heather, Vic, Sam,
Lisa, Paul, Dan, Laurie, Mary
Rose, Bev, Jim and Jean some
idea of what a great summer I've
had.
