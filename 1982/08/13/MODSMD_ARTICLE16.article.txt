# Married couple reunited after hunger strike
## 
### Jeffrey Hamilton 
Although the Helsinki Ac
cords legally bind the Soviet
government to unifying families
separated by national bound
aries, the Soviet husband of a
Stanford graduate student
joined his wife in this country re
cently only after they completed
a joint 26-day hunger strike.
Andrei Frolov, 51, a Soviet
travel writer and photographer,
is the only member of a small
group of Soviet hunger strikers
to have been allowed to leave
the Soviet Union and join a
spouse in another country.
Reached by phone at her
home in Chicago, Lois Becker
Frolov, a 27-year-old Ph.D. can
didate in Russian intellectual his
tory, told the Daily she and her
husband chose fasting as a
means of protest "because no
law or due process exists in
Russia."
Denying any political motives,
Mrs. Frolov said they were left
with no choice but to fast as a
way to bring attention to the So
viet Union's refusal to allow her
husband to emigrate.
She said they had discussed
the possibility of "fasting for
freedom" during a visit she
made to the Soviet Union in
March, but eventually decided
against it.
However, on May 10 Mrs.
Frolov, at home in Chicago, was
informed that her husband had
begun a fast. She vowed to join
him for as long as he could en
dure. She then embarked on a
medically supervised diet of wa
ter which she would later de
scribe as particularly "trying"
due to the pressures of dealing

with bureaucracies and the me
dia during the ordeal.
Meanwhile, in Moscow,
Frolov had been joined in his fast
by six other members of sepa
rated families who were also
seeking emigration visas.
On the 26th day of the hunger
strike Frolov was unexpectedly
granted permission by Soviet au
thorities to leave the Soviet
Union for West Germany. Soviet
authorities then made him wait

''One dissident
was issued a visa
more quickly
because someone
in an influential
position desired
the dissident's
apartment

two weeks to buy a plane ticket,
Mrs. Frolov said. Frolov boarded
a plane to Frankfurt where he
was permitted a 90-minute stop
over. According to Soviet regu
lation, if a citizen does not ob
tain a visa within that time period
he must return to the Soviet
Union.
To both the Frolov's surprise,
he secured the visa and con
tinued on to the United States to
be reunited with his wife one
year after their marriage.
The couple was married in
Moscow in May 1981 during
Mrs. Frolov's second trip to the
Soviet Union.

Shortly after the ceremony
Mrs. Frolov returned to the Unit
ed States without her husband,
who was unable to obtain per
mission to emigrate.
In March of this year Mrs.
Frolov returned to the Soviet
Union on a 19-day tourist visa
but returned to the United States
without her husband.
Mrs. Frolov said she and her
husband don't know whether
Soviet authorities were duped
by the speed with which her hus
band obtained a visa, or whether
they actually wanted him to
leave.
According to History prof.
Alexander Dallin, chairman of
the International Relations De
partment here and an expert on
the Soviet Union, authorities
there have no set policy toward
freeing dissidents. Because of
this, the choice is often made
haphazardly. For example, he
said, one dissident was issued a
visa more quickly because some
one in an influential position de
sired the dissident's apartment.
Mrs. Frolov thought that her
lawyers may have played a
critical role in influencing her
husband's release from the Sovi
et Union. They had filed an in
junction asking an Illinois judge
to prohibit the commercial trade
of grain and gold between the
Chicago Board of Trade and the
Soviet Union.
According to Mrs. Frolov, she
and her husband were able to
elicit ar. enormous amount of
moral support and media cov
erage in Chicago and from the
Stanford community.
Hunger strikes within the So
viet Union are not a new
phenomenon. Dallin said they
have existed at least since the

Stalinist purges of the 19305. But
only in the last 20 years have anti-
Soviet protestors received media
attention. Before Stalin's death
in 1953, it was virtually im
possible to join a non-Soviet
spouse abroad. "Soviet author
ities are entirely erratic but want
to discourage dissidents from
leaving," said Dallin. To date, vi
sas granted to hunger strikers
have not received publicity, he
said.
"Only if a Soviet hunger
striker can get publicity does a
fast make sense," said Dallin. So
viet authorities are under pres
sure to allow their dissidents out
quietly, because to not let them
go is evidence against the Soviet
government's claim that their
citizens enjoy the right to emi
grate. Under these circum

stances a dissident is faced with a
choice between quiet
diplomacy and loud drama.
Dallin said he is "surprised
Russian authorities have yielded
(to public opinion) as often as
they have."
Although hunger strikes are
not outlawed in the Soviet
Union, such an action may be in
terpreted as anti-Soviet propa
ganda and thus the possibility ex
ists for strikers to be prosecuted.
However, as of yet no one has
been arrested for hunger strik
ing.
Once a formal petition to
leave the Soviet Union has been
submitted to authorities, Dallin
said, the petitioner may count
on losing his job, professional as
sociates, and friends. The peti
tioner is considered an outcast in
the Soviet system.
Dallin said that before any dis
sident intimates to authorities
that he or she is ready to leave, it
would be foolish not to have
been accepted first to another
country.
In addition to other hardships,
the petitioner faces conflicting
signals from the various depart
ments within the Soviet bureau
cracy, which often leave him
confused.
For example, a Soviet citizen
wishing to leave is charged for a
mandatory medical examination
that otherwise is provided free
from the state, even to foreign
visitors.
Mrs. Frolov said that Soviet au
thorities, to induce the striker to
end the fast, sometimes promise
the striker a visa and then refuse

to issue it.
Another hunger str ker, lurii
Balovlenkov, a computer pro
gramming student in the Soviet
Union, gave up his first fast in the
10th day because his exit visa was
promised to him. When it was
later denied he resumed the
strike for an additional 45 days.
He recently dropped the fast be
cause his wife falsely told him
that he had been granted a visa.
Earlier his wife had filed an af
fidavit here to have Balovlenkov
force fed. The affidavit was un
successful. Consequently she
went to Moscow on a 10-day visa
but could not get Balovlenkov
out. Balovlenkov's 61-year-old
mother joined him in his latest
fast.
Mrs. Frolov is currently
waitressing and writing about
the experience with her hus
band.

Moscow in May 1981 during
Mrs. Frolov's second trip to the
Soviet Union.

Shortly after the ceremony
Mrs. Frolov returned to the Unit
ed States without her husband,
who was unable to obtain per
mission to emigrate.
In March of this year Mrs.
Frolov returned to the Soviet
Union on a 19-day tourist visa
but returned to the United States
without her husband.
Mrs. Frolov said she and her
husband don't know whether
Soviet authorities were duped
by the speed with which her hus
band obtained a visa, or whether
they actually wanted him to
leave.
According to History prof.
Alexander Dallin, chairman of
the International Relations De
partment here and an expert on
the Soviet Union, authorities
there have no set policy toward
freeing dissidents. Because of
this, the choice is often made
haphazardly. For example, he
said, one dissident was issued a
visa more quickly because some
one in an influential position de
sired the dissident's apartment.
Mrs. Frolov thought that her
lawyers may have played a
critical role in influencing her
husband's release from the Sovi
et Union. They had filed an in
junction asking an Illinois judge
to prohibit the commercial trade
of grain and gold between the
Chicago Board of Trade and the
Soviet Union.
According to Mrs. Frolov, she
and her husband were able to
elicit ar. enormous amount of
moral support and media cov
erage in Chicago and from the
Stanford community.
Hunger strikes within the So
viet Union are not a new
phenomenon. Dallin said they
have existed at least since the

Stalinist purges of the 19305. But
only in the last 20 years have anti-
Soviet protestors received media
attention. Before Stalin's death
in 1953, it was virtually im
possible to join a non-Soviet
spouse abroad. "Soviet author
ities are entirely erratic but want
to discourage dissidents from
leaving," said Dallin. To date, vi
sas granted to hunger strikers
have not received publicity, he
said.
"Only if a Soviet hunger
striker can get publicity does a
fast make sense," said Dallin. So
viet authorities are under pres
sure to allow their dissidents out
quietly, because to not let them
go is evidence against the Soviet
government's claim that their
citizens enjoy the right to emi
grate. Under these circum

stances a dissident is faced with a
choice between quiet
diplomacy and loud drama.
Dallin said he is "surprised
Russian authorities have yielded
(to public opinion) as often as
they have."
Although hunger strikes are
not outlawed in the Soviet
Union, such an action may be in
terpreted as anti-Soviet propa
ganda and thus the possibility ex
ists for strikers to be prosecuted.
However, as of yet no one has
been arrested for hunger strik
ing.
Once a formal petition to
leave the Soviet Union has been
submitted to authorities, Dallin
said, the petitioner may count
on losing his job, professional as
sociates, and friends. The peti
tioner is considered an outcast in
the Soviet system.
Dallin said that before any dis
sident intimates to authorities
that he or she is ready to leave, it
would be foolish not to have
been accepted first to another
country.
In addition to other hardships,
the petitioner faces conflicting
signals from the various depart
ments within the Soviet bureau
cracy, which often leave him
confused.
For example, a Soviet citizen
wishing to leave is charged for a
mandatory medical examination
that otherwise is provided free
from the state, even to foreign
visitors.
Mrs. Frolov said that Soviet au
thorities, to induce the striker to
end the fast, sometimes promise
the striker a visa and then refuse

to issue it.
Another hunger str ker, lurii
Balovlenkov, a computer pro
gramming student in the Soviet
Union, gave up his first fast in the
10th day because his exit visa was
promised to him. When it was
later denied he resumed the
strike for an additional 45 days.
He recently dropped the fast be
cause his wife falsely told him
that he had been granted a visa.
Earlier his wife had filed an af
fidavit here to have Balovlenkov
force fed. The affidavit was un
successful. Consequently she
went to Moscow on a 10-day visa
but could not get Balovlenkov
out. Balovlenkov's 61-year-old
mother joined him in his latest
fast.
Mrs. Frolov is currently
waitressing and writing about
the experience with her hus
band.
Although the Helsinki Ac
cords legally bind the Soviet
government to unifying families
separated by national bound
aries, the Soviet husband of a
Stanford graduate student
joined his wife in this country re
cently only after they completed
a joint 26-day hunger strike.
Andrei Frolov, 51, a Soviet
travel writer and photographer,
is the only member of a small
group of Soviet hunger strikers
to have been allowed to leave
the Soviet Union and join a
spouse in another country.
Reached by phone at her
home in Chicago, Lois Becker
Frolov, a 27-year-old Ph.D. can
didate in Russian intellectual his
tory, told the Daily she and her
husband chose fasting as a
means of protest "because no
law or due process exists in
Russia."
Denying any political motives,
Mrs. Frolov said they were left
with no choice but to fast as a
way to bring attention to the So
viet Union's refusal to allow her
husband to emigrate.
She said they had discussed
the possibility of "fasting for
freedom" during a visit she
made to the Soviet Union in
March, but eventually decided
against it.
However, on May 10 Mrs.
Frolov, at home in Chicago, was
informed that her husband had
begun a fast. She vowed to join
him for as long as he could en
dure. She then embarked on a
medically supervised diet of wa
ter which she would later de
scribe as particularly "trying"
due to the pressures of dealing

with bureaucracies and the me
dia during the ordeal.
Meanwhile, in Moscow,
Frolov had been joined in his fast
by six other members of sepa
rated families who were also
seeking emigration visas.
On the 26th day of the hunger
strike Frolov was unexpectedly
granted permission by Soviet au
thorities to leave the Soviet
Union for West Germany. Soviet
authorities then made him wait

''One dissident

in an influential
position desired
the dissident's
apartment

two weeks to buy a plane ticket,
Mrs. Frolov said. Frolov boarded
a plane to Frankfurt where he
was permitted a 90-minute stop
over. According to Soviet regu
lation, if a citizen does not ob
tain a visa within that time period
he must return to the Soviet
Union.
To both the Frolov's surprise,
he secured the visa and con
tinued on to the United States to
be reunited with his wife one
year after their marriage.
