When jim Nadel graduated
in 1972, the University offered
no formalized program on
jazz study. But with the as
sistance of the now defunct
Design Co-Op, he and Bert
Carelli began a small work
shop on theory and im
provisation.
In the past 10 years, Stan
ford Jazz has grown to be
come a residential program
for students and master musi
cians. The group gathered
this month for two one-week
sessions under a pleasant, low
pressure environment.
Highlighting the first week
was the celebrated, interna
tional artist Stan Getz. The
workshop was only the sec
ond clinic Getz had ever at
tended, the former being on
the East coast some eight
years ago.
He appeared with his band,
which included Marc John
son on stand-up bass, Victor
Lewis on drums, and Jim
McNeely on piano. In addi
tion to leading master classes,
Getz gave sessions on theory
with some individual instruc
tion.
The second week featured
Morgan, famed alto
saxophonist formerly with





the Maynard Ferguson Band
and Supersax. Whereas Getz
tended to concentrate more
on lead work, Morgan
worked more on rhythm. He
provided individual instruc
tion and criticism.
Morgan and his band, fea
turing Paul Breslin on bass,
Larry Dunlop on piano, Cal
Lewiston on trumpet, and Jim
Zimmerman on drums, gave a
free concert at Tresidder to
cap off the week. The per
formance was funded
through grants by the Music
Performers Trust Fund, as
well as the National Associa
tion of Jazz Educators.
The workshop had a record
attendance this year. In gen
eral, only 20 to 30 people en
roll. But this year, 85 students
from across the country came
here to improve their craft.
One student flew out from
Sussex, England, specifically
to meet Stan Getz. Another
travelled from Norway to at
tend both weeks of the work
shop.
In addition to the standard

program, a five-week eve
ning course was available for
$150.
Thecrux of the seminar is in
teaching and developing im
provisational skills in small
combo format. The residence
program, featuring noted
professional musicians, is an
outgrowth of the previous
nine clinics.
The workshop was a pres
entation of the Student Arts at
Stanford (STARTS). The entire
project was self-supported.
Some of the major dif
ferences of the workshop, as

compared to other nationally
run clinics, include the op
portunity for the more ad
vanced players to perform
before an audience, often on
the Tresidder patio or in the
Coffee House.
Joe Oliveira, a student sax
ophonist, said, "I can go on
forever about how much I've
learned. It's been a very in
tensive course. The great
thing is that you're there get
ting experience and tips from
an actual pro in the field who
knows how it's done."
