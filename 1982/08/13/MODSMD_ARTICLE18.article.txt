# Medfly mop-up continues to burden state

The Med Fly Eradication
Project is currently in the "mop
up stages," according to project
spokesman Roger Blake. Project
headquarters in Los Gatos laid
off half of its 320 workers yester
day and will shut down fully in
September.
The Project Office's closure
corresponds to the assumption
that the Mediterranean fruit fly
infestation is over. However, as
the project dwindles in size, con
troversies surrounding the med
fly remain unresolved. Tax
payers will continue to bear the

costs of the Eradication Project's
past activities and of protection
against another infestation.
The state began actively bat
tling the fly in June 1980, using a
three-pronged attack. For one
year, ground spraying, fruit
stripping, and release of sterile
flies were used to combat the
pest. This phase cost taxpayers
$19 million, Blake said, and was
not effective.
In July 1981, the controversial
aerial spraying of malathion
began. Deemed successful, the
spraying was responsible for the
bulk of the project's $94.5 mil

lion cost to date.
Presently, spraying is limited
to nine square miles in Stockton,
and is predicted to stop on Au
gust 19.
The Stockton spraying is in re
sponse to a June 23 find of a sin
gle med fly, one of three such
single finds in Northern Califor
nia over the past year.
Blake predicted that single
finds will probably be common
in the future because the
number of set traps has in
creased from 5000 state-wide
three years ago to "over 100,000
now â€” probably about 140,000."

As the project scales down and the Project
Office closes, med fly control will fall into
the hands of county agricultural
commissioners. Traps will be maintained
on a permanent basis, though reduced in
number from 50 to five traps per square
mile. The estimated cost of maintaining
traps on a state-wide level is $5.2 million
per year, and will "probably be a yearly
expense for the next 100 years/' Blake said.

Blake explained single fly finds
are not necessarily cause for
alarm. "The main thing is look
ing for a breeding population,"
he said. One or two flies does
not necessarily indicate this. "It's
like trying to start an anthill with
two ants. It's very difficult to do."
However, the project has
treated the presence of a single
fly cautiously. The attack is based
on knowledge of the flies' life
cycles. The protocol is to quaran

tine an 81-square-mile area sur
rounding the fly, and spray nine
square miles. Spraying continues
through two life cycles, which
are temperature-dependent in
length, varying from as short as
23 days in warmer areas like
Stockton to as long as 94 days in
San Mateo's cooler environ
ment. Careful detection through
trapping is used during the third
life cycle; if no flies are found,
the area can then be declared
eradicated.
Last Friday, eradication was
declared in all of Santa Cruz
County and 13 square of

bordering Santa Clara County
(in which the University is lo
cated), reducing the total
quarantined area from 943 t0623
square miles, less than a sixth of
the area under quarantine at the
battle's peak.
In Santa Clara County, the last
fly find was t'c.ober 22, 1981,
west of Moffett Field. Currently,
77 square miles are still quaran
tined in the county, but the
quarantine will be lifted Septem

ber 10. All of San Mateo County
will also be declared eradicated
at this time, leaving only a 90-
square-mile area in San Joaquin
County under quarantine until
this too is removed in mid-Sep
tember.
As the project scales down and
the Project Office closes, med fly
control will fall into the hands of
county agricultural com
missioners. Traps will be main
tained on a permanent basis,
though reduced in number from
50 to five traps per square mile.
The estimated cost of main
taining traps on a state-wide
level is $5.2 million per year, and
will "probably be a yearly ex
pense for the next 100 years,"
Blake said.
Another on-going cost result
ing from the crisis will be law suit
settlements. More than 16,000
claims have been filed against
the state over the use of
malathion, the vast majority of
which contend that the
pesticide's use damaged car
paint, according to Robert Eich,
asst. executive secretary of the
State Board of Control. Property
damage claims total $12,300,000,
Eich said.
To meet the cost, the State As
sembly passed a bill (AB3383) on
June 30, 1982, setting aside $4
million and has set a cap for how
much can be spent on reim
bursement of vehicle damage
claims.
Personal injury claims number
85 and total $81 million, Eich
said. Blake pointed out that of
2.5 million Bay Area residences
sprayed, 27 persons have filed
health claims. He cited these
statistics as evidence of the
pesticide's harmlessness.
Though the repercussions
from spraying linger on, the
threat of the fly itself appears to
be over. Still, the pest merits
close attention in the future.
Blake predicted the Eradication
Project will have cost taxpayers
close to $100 million by its com
pletion. The estimated loss to
California agriculture varies ac
cording to the source. Dis

crepancies arise when defining
losses that can be attributed to
the fly. Actual damage by the
pest was relatively low, but im
posed quarantines impaired
sales and relations with buyers.
The California Department of
Food and Agriculture estimated
the loss to agriculture at $73 mil
lion in 1981. However, the Cali
fornia Farm Bureau set the cost
at closer to $250 million, Blake
said.
