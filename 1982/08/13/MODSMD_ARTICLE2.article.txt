This article is based on in
terviews conducted during a
visit by a Daily reporter into
the Giants clubhouse last Sat
urday. On that day, which
marked the midpoint of the
team's win streak, the Giants
defeated the Astros 9-2.
San Francisco — The re
surgence of the San Francisco
Giants has caught almost ev
erybody off guard — with the
exception of the Giants them
selves. They're convinced
that the recent 10-game win
ning streak (broken yesterday
when the team dropped a
game to the Dodgers) was not
a fluke, but rather the result
of the team's talent coming
together.
Only a few weeks ago the

Giants were thought to be out
of the pennant race. But that
was before the win streak
combined with the collapse
of the formerly front-running
Atlanta Braves to suddenly
catapult the team into serious
contention for the National
League West title.
First baseman Reggie Smith
— one of the most important
reasons for the team's re
juvenation — told the Daily
that the club's recent winning
streak was a result of the
emergence of strengths on
the team.
One of those strengths has
to be the play of Smith
himself, who
last week hit three home runs
and drove in seven runs to

earn honors as the National
League Player of the Week.
Wednesday Smith hit a home
run in the 12th to pull out anoth
er win for the Giants.
"It was just a matter of us be
lieving in ourselves and doing
the things we're capable of," he

said.
Smith compared the Giants at
tack to the strength of the con
tending teams he played for
while he was with the Los Angel
es Dodgers. "There our attack
was like an octopus — if one arm
didn't get you another one
would ... we're starting to de

velop that here," he said.
Smith's intensity was reflected
in the slow and clear manner in
which he enunciated his words
to a crowd of reporters. "We've
made our own breaks and that's
what all good ball clubs do.
"By staying in games you have
the best chance to win and that's
what we've been doing and why
we've enjoyed the success that
we've had," he said.
According to Smith, the
team's earlier struggle helped
build the foundation for its cur
rent success. "Sometimes a team
has to go through some adversi
ty. I think it has a humbling effect
and I think if handled properly it
can be a learning experience."
Smith sees his role as that of a
veteran who can provide the
team with a winning attitude —
something which he said the
team lacked before. "They
thought that maybe some of the
younger players could learn
some of the things that they
needed to know to be a produc
tive ball team from me," he said.
Smith refused to look as far
ahead as the Dodger series.
"I will go into the series know
ing what we've done and that's
win," he said.
Another veteran, second
baseman Joe Morgan, has also
contributed heavily to the
team's winning effort, as much
with his timely hitting and steady
defensive play as with his win
ning attitude and leadership
capabilities. Because of his hot
hitting Morgan was named the
National League Player of the
month for July.
Manager Frank Robinson, liv
ing up to his reputation for being
stern and humorless, told the
group of, reporters after the
game that the streak was the re
sult of timely hitting and ex
cellent pitching. Not, as one re
porter jokingly suggested, as a
result of managerial genius.
Robinson responded to many
of the reporters' questions with a

silent stare before answering
them in a low voice, creating a
tense atmosphere in his office.
Robinson said he would like to
keep a set line-up to maintain
consistency, but that he has
been forced to make changes in
the order to improve the team.
"You make changes for results
and because you're not getting
results," he said.
Throughout the win streak the
Giant's bullpen has performed
superbly. Over a period a little
longer than the 10-game win
streak the bullpen has posted a
combined earned run average
(ERA) of a little over one run per
nine innings.
Greg Minton, the Giants' re
lief ace and one of the best relief
pitchers in the National League,
told the Daily that the difference
in motivation this year for
pitchers is the team's strength
ened hitting.
"I've been with this team for
six years and this is the first time
that I know we can hold them an
inning or two we can win it...
we've got guys on this team that
can hit it a long ways. Knowing
that you don't let up. Before I
could go six innings before we
might score again," he said.
The team's best right-handed
reliever for several years credits
his particularly excellent per
formance this year to his de
velopment of a curve and to his
improved control.
Although he is second in the
National League in saves with 19
and he leads the club with an
ERA of 1.94, Minton points to an
other statistic as more important
to his success. This year he has
had more strikeouts than walks.
"I'm going to give up some
singles, but if there's noboby on
base with a walk I have to give up
three singles for them to score,
which makes a big difference/'
he said.
Known as a colorful player in
the style of ex-National League
pitcher Bill Lee, Minton's warm

up jacket has his nickname
"Moon Man" printed across the
back.
Luckily for the Giants Minton
prefers working a lot. "I need a
lot of work so I'm tired. If I'm too
strong I try to throw it all the way
to the back stop."
If it were up to him, Minton
said he would pitch the last in
ning of every game.
Rookie centerfielder Chili
Davis attributed the team's re
cent success to the closeness of
the team. "Contrary to what you
read in the papers everyone
here gets along with everyone,"
he told the Daily.
Davis, along with rookie
pitchers Bill Laskey and Atlee
Hammaker and rookie third
baseman Tom O'Malley, de
serve a large share of the credit
for the team's revival. Along with
Dodger second baseman Steve
Sax, Davis has to be considered
one of the leading candidates for
Rookie of the Year.
Although earlier in the year
the group made its share of
rookie mistakes intertwined
with brilliant play, according to
Davis those mistakes are just
about over.
"We play not like rookies but
veteran ballplayers," he said.
The influence of veterans such
as Morgan and Smith has had a
stabilizing effect, he said. "They
try to help us with the little
things we do wrong on the field
arid off the field.
"They don't stuff advice in
your face. They don't say okay,
rook, I'm a veteran and you do as
I say," he said. "They don't do
that and that's what I like about
them — they treat you like
men."
Davis said the veterans' at
titude has made his first full year
in the major leagues a com
fortable one.
Recently Davis was switched
from third in the lineup to first.
But he said he has no preference
for one spot over another.

First baseman Reggie Smith
— one of the most important

earn honors as the National
League Player of the Week.
Wednesday Smith hit a home
run in the 12th to pull out anoth
er win for the Giants.
"It was just a matter of us be
lieving in ourselves and doing
the things we're capable of," he

said.
Smith compared the Giants at
tack to the strength of the con
tending teams he played for
while he was with the Los Angel
es Dodgers. "There our attack
was like an octopus — if one arm
didn't get you another one
would ... we're starting to de

velop that here," he said.
Smith's intensity was reflected
in the slow and clear manner in
which he enunciated his words
to a crowd of reporters. "We've
made our own breaks and that's
what all good ball clubs do.
"By staying in games you have
the best chance to win and that's
what we've been doing and why
we've enjoyed the success that
we've had," he said.
According to Smith, the
team's earlier struggle helped
build the foundation for its cur
rent success. "Sometimes a team
has to go through some adversi
ty. I think it has a humbling effect
and I think if handled properly it
can be a learning experience."
Smith sees his role as that of a
veteran who can provide the
team with a winning attitude —
something which he said the
team lacked before. "They
thought that maybe some of the
younger players could learn
some of the things that they
needed to know to be a produc
tive ball team from me," he said.
Smith refused to look as far
ahead as the Dodger series.
"I will go into the series know
ing what we've done and that's
win," he said.
Another veteran, second
baseman Joe Morgan, has also
contributed heavily to the
team's winning effort, as much
with his timely hitting and steady
defensive play as with his win
ning attitude and leadership
capabilities. Because of his hot
hitting Morgan was named the
National League Player of the
month for July.
Manager Frank Robinson, liv
ing up to his reputation for being
stern and humorless, told the
group of, reporters after the
game that the streak was the re
sult of timely hitting and ex
cellent pitching. Not, as one re
porter jokingly suggested, as a
result of managerial genius.
Robinson responded to many
of the reporters' questions with a

silent stare before answering
them in a low voice, creating a
tense atmosphere in his office.
Robinson said he would like to
keep a set line-up to maintain
consistency, but that he has
been forced to make changes in
the order to improve the team.
"You make changes for results
and because you're not getting
results," he said.
Throughout the win streak the
Giant's bullpen has performed
superbly. Over a period a little
longer than the 10-game win
streak the bullpen has posted a
combined earned run average
(ERA) of a little over one run per
nine innings.
Greg Minton, the Giants' re
lief ace and one of the best relief
pitchers in the National League,
told the Daily that the difference
in motivation this year for
pitchers is the team's strength
ened hitting.
"I've been with this team for
six years and this is the first time
that I know we can hold them an
inning or two we can win it...
we've got guys on this team that
can hit it a long ways. Knowing
that you don't let up. Before I
could go six innings before we
might score again," he said.
The team's best right-handed
reliever for several years credits
his particularly excellent per
formance this year to his de
velopment of a curve and to his
improved control.
Although he is second in the
National League in saves with 19
and he leads the club with an
ERA of 1.94, Minton points to an
other statistic as more important
to his success. This year he has
had more strikeouts than walks.
"I'm going to give up some
singles, but if there's noboby on
base with a walk I have to give up
three singles for them to score,
which makes a big difference/'
he said.
Known as a colorful player in
the style of ex-National League
pitcher Bill Lee, Minton's warm

up jacket has his nickname
"Moon Man" printed across the
back.
Luckily for the Giants Minton
prefers working a lot. "I need a
lot of work so I'm tired. If I'm too
strong I try to throw it all the way
to the back stop."
If it were up to him, Minton
said he would pitch the last in
ning of every game.
Rookie centerfielder Chili
Davis attributed the team's re
cent success to the closeness of
the team. "Contrary to what you
read in the papers everyone
here gets along with everyone,"
he told the Daily.
Davis, along with rookie
pitchers Bill Laskey and Atlee
Hammaker and rookie third
baseman Tom O'Malley, de
serve a large share of the credit
for the team's revival. Along with
Dodger second baseman Steve
Sax, Davis has to be considered
one of the leading candidates for
Rookie of the Year.
Although earlier in the year
the group made its share of
rookie mistakes intertwined
with brilliant play, according to
Davis those mistakes are just
