## According to Garp, Irving, Tesich and Hill 
### Steve Vineberg 
Reading John Irving's The
World According to Garp is a
dense, fulfilling experience: Irv
ing dreams up seductive ideas
and crams your mind with im
aginative variations on them,
and the characters remain startl
ing and emotionally engaging
even on a second reading. Garp
lovers — some of whom return
to the book y* ar after year —
tend to see the hero, T.S. Garp,
as an embodiment of Irving
himself, and though such con
fusions are seldom accurate (or
wise), the origins of this one are
quickly visible: the protagonist is
a writer and Irving's vision is that
life is a novel. Irving's com
pulsive inventing is mirrored in
what Garp's wife Helen calls his
"ruthlessness" as a storyteller,

even when he's just cooking up
an after-dinner tale to amuse his
son Walt: as long as there is
potential for another twist or
switch, he can't leave the damn
thing alone. By making his hero a
writer, his hero's mother a writ
er, and his hero's wife a reader
(an English instructor?, Irving can
build his writer's program —
foreshadowing, irony, sym
metry, even an epilogue — right
into the novel, because the char
acters are always conscious of
the way life seems to delight in
these processes, and how they
themselves can assist at them.
Inevitably, any film of Garp
will seem thin. No movie can ac
complish what a good novel can,
and a novel about writing poses
more problems than most. Per
haps that explains why one may

feel a little cheated Walking out
of this film, despite the clear
headedness of Steve Tesich's
script and the seamless manner
in which the director, George
Roy Hill, has assembled it; it
doesn't fill you up. The World
According to Garp struck me in
itially as a respectable adaptation
— intelligent but disappointing;
but I found myself, hours later,
thinking back with pleasure on
more sequences than I'd im
agined would stay with me. A lot
of the movie is really quite good,
and affecting in a way that can't
just be explained away as emo
tional residue from the novel.
The film begins in 1944, shortly
after Garp's birth to a single
minded nurse named Jenny
Field who feels the need for a
child but none at all for a hus

band. (Carp's father, a severely
retarded veteran in Jenny's
ward, dies shortly after unknow
ingly impregnating her.) The ear
ly scenes, indifferently handled
by Hill, pass in a boys' private
school where Jenny is employed
and where Garp learns to wres
tle, has his first sexual ex
perience, falls in love (with
Helen, the wrestling coach's
daughter) and yearns to be a
writer; when he graduates, he
and Jenny spend a year in New
York, where he writes his first
major short story and she an au
tobiography that enthralls wom
en all over the country, establish
ing her as a feminist heroine. In
the novel, Irving employes a
phallic motif that plays tensely
against both the feminist subplot
(Jenny's home at Dog's Head

Harbor becomes a haven for
beseiged women) and Jenny's
inability to feel or even com
prehend sexual desire. Hill and
Tesich can't really duplicate this,
so they develop a motif of their
own: flying. As a child, Garp fan
tasizes about his father, who he
imagines flew fighter planes in
the war; he slips from the roof of
the infirmary, nearly killing
himself; a sniper attempting to
shoot Jenny at a rally is shot
down from a tree; etc. In this
movie, we identify flying both as
something exciting and promis
ing and as something ominous
— a harbinger of that peculiar,
persistent bad karma Garp's fam
ily calls the Under Toad (after
Walt's misunderstanding of "un
dertow," which Garp urges him
to beware of when he's swim
ming at Jenny's beach house).
Academic and schematic it may
be, but the repeated flying im
agery does accumulate power.
Garp is not an example of the
right book in the wrong hands
(like The French Lieutenant's
Woman) or mishandled by film
makers who don't understand
the material (like Ragtime). In
fact, Hill and Tesich have even
worked out a way to put the de
velopment of Garp's writing on
screen. Standing at a window in

his New York hotel room, Garp
pulls the blinds open and shut;
each time they open, they un
earth a new image: Dog's Head
Harbor, the wrestling room, a
field where he and Helen gather
the wind-scattered pages of his
first attempt at short story writ
ing. A series of subsequent shots,
each one expanding on a scene
we have witnessed with Garp,
form a precis of the story as bits
of it pass from his memory into
the collage of fiction. This
enormously clever conceit
marks one of the few times a
movie has brought us close to
understanding the creative
process; it's a pity that Robin
Williams, who plays Garp, can't
convince us that he's really a
writer. Williams has a marvelous
baby face and an endearing ap
ple-cheeked grin; he's often
very funny, and he's terribly
good at conveying childlike
hurt. His work on television and
in nightclubs evidences a
brilliant comic talent, but his
work in movies has, so far, been
unremarkable. This is his second
film and the second time I'd im
agined beforehand he was
brilliantly cast and wondered af
terwards why I'd thought so. He
had some charming moments in
Popeye, and perhaps his failure
to sustain them was due in part
to the puzzling inconsistency of
Robert Altman's direction and in
part to physical handicaps — a
corncob pipe stuck constantly in
his maw and one permanently
closed eye — that would present
obstacles to any actor. As Garp,
though, Williams' obstacles
seem to be internal. His emo
tional scenes are earnest
enough, but he approaches

them with a baldness that con
tradicts the indirection and un
usual texture of much of the rest
of the picture. More important
ly, he doesn't offer us a Garp
with much depth. Perhaps it's a
case of an actor sprung on a big
role before he's ready for it.
Williams' inadequacies show
up more clearly, perhaps, be
cause Hill has surrounded him
with a team of talented New
York actors who excel at pre
cision, economy and under
statement. Glenn Close manages
to make Jenny's bizarre com
bination of sexual disinterest
and personal warmth more con
vincing than Irving did, though
Tesich errs, I think, in glossing
over Irving's great irony about
this woman: that, with no first
hand knowledge of what she
deems "lust," she writes a book
largely concerned with it and ac
quires an entourage who look to
her for what they think is
feminist guidance and she sees
as the kind of care a first-rate
nurse can always provide. In the
movie, we don't see Jenny's iro
ny about herself in her new posi
tion as high priestess of the
women's movement, and so her
transition from resident nurse at
Steering Academy to resident
confidant at Dog's Head Harbor
may bewilder those who haven't
read the novel.
As Helen, Mary Beth Hurt,
who stars in Crimes of the Heart
on Broadway, carries off her
teenage scenes (Robin Williams
doesn't), and as Helen ages —
under an unnecessarily fake
looking wig — Hurt's per
formance deepens. Since she
hasn't done much work in film
and Woody Allen didn't use her
well in Interiors, the eloquence

of her quiet moments on screen
is especially impessive — a lov
ing glance at her husband fol
lowed seconds later by a sharp,
suspicious look as he drives a
sexy babysitter home, the
strategy that plays out on her
face as she foresees an affair with
one of her students; and she has
an achingly effective big scene
with Garp. Even better is John
Lithgow, an actor of amazing
range (filmgoers saw him last as
the Gordon Liddy-like assassin in
De Palma's Blow Out), who plays
the Garp family's friend Roberta
Muldoon, a transsexual who
was, in her other life, tight end
for the Philadelphia Eagles.
Lithgow isn't afraid to set both
the masculinity and the
femininity of this character
going at full force, so we under
stand what makes Roberta
unique and why Jenny relies on
her strength in crises. Roberta
does have some irony about
herself, and Lithgow's timing is
good enough to make the most
of the comedy inherent in the
role, but the real triumph of his
performance is that he makes us
stop laughing and accept Ro
berta as she is.
Swoosie Kurtz does a fine,
polished turn as a New York
hooker — she keeps popping
up, like a supporting player in
Dickens, and each time we are
glad to see her. Some dist
inguished stage performers ap
pear in memorable cameos, too.
Jessica Tandy and Hume Cronyn
play Jenny's astonished parents
in the opening scene; they are
very funny. (It's the first time I've
liked Cronyn in any movie.) And
Amanda Plummer is somehow
fiery and touching in a non
speaking, thirty-second walk-on

in the last half hour of the film.
Plummer, who made a spellbind
ing film debut in last summer's
Cattle Annie and Little Britches,
escaping general notice because
the picture was not released in
most cities, has been winning
awards in New York in the mean
time; her one scene in Garp is a
measure of what a gifted actress
can do with almost nothing.
Whatever Carp's disappoint
ments are, its virtue outweigh
them, at least in retrospect. I
wish that Miroslav Ondricek,
who shot Hill's most handsome
movie (Slaughterhouse-Five),
had found a less wholesome
look for this one, and that Hill
had made the Steering scenes
more compelling and come
closer to the strange, whimsical

sorrowful tone Irving achieves in
most of the novel. But I ad
mire the warmth and structure
of Steve Tesich's screenplay, and
some of the dialogue really
rings: he's done wonders with
Garp's son Duncan (well played
by Nathan Babcock), for exam
ple. And it's only the third time
in George Roy Hill's 20 years as a
director that I've felt he was
doing something he believed in.
The other times were also on
projects derived from popular
novels — Hawaii and
Slaughterhouse-Five. Often a
filmmaker who loves the book
he is adapting is for that very rea
son the wrong choice for it, but
Garp brings out qualities we
rarely see in George Roy Hill —
honesty and sincerity.
