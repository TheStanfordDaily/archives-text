## According to Garp, Irving, Tesich and Hill 
### Steve Vineberg 
Reading John Irving's The
World According to Garp is a
dense, fulfilling experience: Irv
ing dreams up seductive ideas
and crams your mind with im
aginative variations on them,
and the characters remain startl
ing and emotionally engaging
even on a second reading. Garp
lovers — some of whom return
to the book y* ar after year —
tend to see the hero, T.S. Garp,
as an embodiment of Irving
himself, and though such con
fusions are seldom accurate (or
wise), the origins of this one are
quickly visible: the protagonist is
a writer and Irving's vision is that
life is a novel. Irving's com
pulsive inventing is mirrored in
what Garp's wife Helen calls his
"ruthlessness" as a storyteller,

even when he's just cooking up
an after-dinner tale to amuse his
son Walt: as long as there is
potential for another twist or
switch, he can't leave the damn
thing alone. By making his hero a
writer, his hero's mother a writ
er, and his hero's wife a reader
(an English instructor?, Irving can
build his writer's program —
foreshadowing, irony, sym
metry, even an epilogue — right
into the novel, because the char
acters are always conscious of
the way life seems to delight in
these processes, and how they
themselves can assist at them.
Inevitably, any film of Garp
will seem thin. No movie can ac
complish what a good novel can,
and a novel about writing poses
more problems than most. Per
haps that explains why one may

feel a little cheated Walking out
of this film, despite the clear
headedness of Steve Tesich's
script and the seamless manner
in which the director, George
Roy Hill, has assembled it; it
doesn't fill you up. The World
According to Garp struck me in
itially as a respectable adaptation
— intelligent but disappointing;
but I found myself, hours later,
thinking back with pleasure on
more sequences than I'd im
agined would stay with me. A lot
of the movie is really quite good,
and affecting in a way that can't
just be explained away as emo
tional residue from the novel.
The film begins in 1944, shortly
after Garp's birth to a single
minded nurse named Jenny
Field who feels the need for a
child but none at all for a hus

band. (Carp's father, a severely
retarded veteran in Jenny's
ward, dies shortly after unknow
ingly impregnating her.) The ear
ly scenes, indifferently handled
by Hill, pass in a boys' private
school where Jenny is employed
and where Garp learns to wres
tle, has his first sexual ex
perience, falls in love (with
Helen, the wrestling coach's
daughter) and yearns to be a
writer; when he graduates, he
and Jenny spend a year in New
York, where he writes his first
major short story and she an au
tobiography that enthralls wom
en all over the country, establish
ing her as a feminist heroine. In
the novel, Irving employes a
phallic motif that plays tensely
against both the feminist subplot
(Jenny's home at Dog's Head

Harbor becomes a haven for
beseiged women) and Jenny's
inability to feel or even com
prehend sexual desire. Hill and
Tesich can't really duplicate this,
so they develop a motif of their
own: flying. As a child, Garp fan
tasizes about his father, who he
imagines flew fighter planes in
the war; he slips from the roof of
the infirmary, nearly killing
himself; a sniper attempting to
shoot Jenny at a rally is shot
down from a tree; etc. In this
movie, we identify flying both as
something exciting and promis
ing and as something ominous
— a harbinger of that peculiar,
persistent bad karma Garp's fam
ily calls the Under Toad (after
Walt's misunderstanding of "un
dertow," which Garp urges him
to beware of when he's swim
ming at Jenny's beach house).
Academic and schematic it may
be, but the repeated flying im
agery does accumulate power.
Garp is not an example of the
right book in the wrong hands
(like The French Lieutenant's
Woman) or mishandled by film
makers who don't understand
the material (like Ragtime). In
fact, Hill and Tesich have even
worked out a way to put the de
velopment of Garp's writing on
screen. Standing at a window in
