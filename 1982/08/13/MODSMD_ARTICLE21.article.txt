# The 						WASPs at home in 'The Dining Room'
## 
### Marc Fajer 
In the past several years, a
great deal of time has been
spent, more or less successfully,
trying to capture the experience
of the ethnic groups of America
on stage. The lives of Italians,
Jews, Blacks, et al. have been
portrayed in attempts to get to
the heart of what it means to be a
hyphenated American. The Din
ing Room, which opened
Wednesday night at the Geary
Theatre in San Francisco, is a
poignant and innovative stab at
coming to grips with the lives of
the unhyphenated Americans,
the WASPs. The play consists of a
series of unrelated vignettes, set
over the past 50 years, in which
the talented cast of six play 46
different people of all ages. The
only throw lines provided by
author A. R. Gurney, Jr. are the
dining room itself, imposing and
austere, and the enforced order
and formality that the room rep
resents. As the various stories
unfold around the huge wooden
table, we are presented with a
moving, funny and affectionate
look at what it means to be a
WASP.
Director David Trainer has
done a fine job holding the
many segments together. Use of
varied styles, overlapping scenes
and lightning-quick pacing
keeps the show interesting at all
times and displays the very fine
writing to its best advantage. The
cast, while not perfect in each of
their many roles, manage to be

convincing most of the time,
whether portraying eight- or 80-
year-olds. The men, Barry
Neison, Richard Backus, and
Nicolas Hormann, are especially
impressive, but the women,
Cathryn Damon (Mary
Campbell of "Soap"), Jeanne
Ruskin, and Mary Catherine
Wright, each have outstanding
moments. Loren Sherman's set is

properly formal and expensive
looking, and is highlighted by a
mirror center stage which re
flects the audience. This serves
to remind many of those watch
ing that they are part of the
world being evoked before
them.
This world is presented as
being very carefully regulated.
Every aspect of life has its correct
procedures and, if these are fol
lowed, order will result and all
will be well. In one of the early
scenes, Nelson, as a 1930s busi
nessman at breakfast, dictates
body posture, table manners, at
titude toward school and proper
role of government to his ner
vous and squirming children
(Backus and Wright). He man

ages to throw an additional ad
monition to the maid about
seeds in his orange juice, which
"wreak havoc with the diges
tion; they take root and grow."
Ironically, the scene itself sows
seeds of discontent which also
"take root and grow." We are
presented later with an architect
(Backus), who, remembering
breakfasts of that ilk, develops a

neurotic urge to destroy dining
rooms as he remodels.
The desire for control reaches
all facets of life. Nelson, in two
very powerful scenes, portrays
rich old men trying to exert con
trol. One, visited by a grandson
requesting money for boarding
school (Backus again), torments
the boy into tearfully confessing
that he does not really want to go
before he promises the money.
The other dictates instructions to
his grown son (Hormann) for his
funeral. Nelson manages to be
both touching and funny in his
concern for detail; he insists, for
example, that his wife be buried
next to him, even if she remar
ries: "She'll come back in the

end."
The best pieces in "The Dining
Room" are those in which peo
ple try to cope with the erosion
of their cherished order. When
their elderly mother (Wright)
loses touch with reality at a
Thanksgiving dinner, and
forgets where she is, her three
sons try singing to her to get her
back. Her initial apparent recog
nition, and ultimate failue to re
turn to reality are among the
most moving moments in the
show. Hormann does his best
performance of the evening as a
middle aged man confronted by
his daughter's request to come
home. She has left her husband,
and had affairs with both a man
and a woman. His withdrawal
into alcohol and platitude, and
the inevitable rejection despite
very real concern, are feelingly
portrayed. Unfortunately, some
weak moments by Wright as the
distraught girl kept the scene
from being the best of the night.
Implicit in the depiction of the

WASP battle for order is the fact
that it is being lost. Aunt Harriet
(Ruskin, in a wonderful bit)
proudly displays finger bowls
and pistol-handled knives for
her nephew to photograph for a
'project,' only to discover that he
is studying dying cultures.
Though her feisty reaction
shows that, in her mind at least,
her world is not dead, the hand
writing is clearly on the wall. The
show concludes with Cathryn
Damon telling the audience of
her dream of reconstructing the
grand dinner parties of old, and
with the vision of such a party. As
we watch the table fill up for the
only time in the play, it is clear
that this tableau, and the fully or
dered world that it represents,
are indeed fantasies. For good or
ill, we hyphenated Americans
have ended the reign of the din
ing room. The lifestyle that
Gurney carefully and affec
tionately brings to life is disap
pearing, and with it, a significant
part of American culture.

ple try to cope with the erosion
of their cherished order. When
their elderly mother (Wright)
loses touch with reality at a
Thanksgiving dinner, and
forgets where she is, her three
sons try singing to her to get her
back. Her initial apparent recog
nition, and ultimate failue to re
turn to reality are among the
most moving moments in the
show. Hormann does his best
performance of the evening as a
middle aged man confronted by
his daughter's request to come
home. She has left her husband,
and had affairs with both a man
and a woman. His withdrawal
into alcohol and platitude, and
the inevitable rejection despite
very real concern, are feelingly
portrayed. Unfortunately, some
weak moments by Wright as the
distraught girl kept the scene
from being the best of the night.
Implicit in the depiction of the

WASP battle for order is the fact
that it is being lost. Aunt Harriet
(Ruskin, in a wonderful bit)
proudly displays finger bowls
and pistol-handled knives for
her nephew to photograph for a
'project,' only to discover that he
is studying dying cultures.
Though her feisty reaction
shows that, in her mind at least,
her world is not dead, the hand
writing is clearly on the wall. The
show concludes with Cathryn
Damon telling the audience of
her dream of reconstructing the
grand dinner parties of old, and
with the vision of such a party. As
we watch the table fill up for the
only time in the play, it is clear
that this tableau, and the fully or
dered world that it represents,
are indeed fantasies. For good or
ill, we hyphenated Americans
have ended the reign of the din
ing room. The lifestyle that
Gurney carefully and affec
tionately brings to life is disap
pearing, and with it, a significant
part of American culture.
In the past several years, a
great deal of time has been
spent, more or less successfully,
trying to capture the experience
of the ethnic groups of America
on stage. The lives of Italians,
Jews, Blacks, et al. have been
portrayed in attempts to get to
the heart of what it means to be a
hyphenated American. The Din
ing Room, which opened
Wednesday night at the Geary
Theatre in San Francisco, is a
poignant and innovative stab at
coming to grips with the lives of
the unhyphenated Americans,
the WASPs. The play consists of a
series of unrelated vignettes, set
over the past 50 years, in which
the talented cast of six play 46
different people of all ages. The
only throw lines provided by
author A. R. Gurney, Jr. are the
dining room itself, imposing and
austere, and the enforced order
and formality that the room rep
resents. As the various stories
unfold around the huge wooden
table, we are presented with a
moving, funny and affectionate
look at what it means to be a
WASP.
Director David Trainer has
done a fine job holding the
many segments together. Use of
varied styles, overlapping scenes
and lightning-quick pacing
keeps the show interesting at all
times and displays the very fine
writing to its best advantage. The
cast, while not perfect in each of
their many roles, manage to be

convincing most of the time,
whether portraying eight- or 80-
year-olds. The men, Barry
Neison, Richard Backus, and
Nicolas Hormann, are especially
impressive, but the women,
Cathryn Damon (Mary
Campbell of "Soap"), Jeanne
Ruskin, and Mary Catherine
Wright, each have outstanding
moments. Loren Sherman's set is

mirror center stage which re
flects the audience. This serves
to remind many of those watch
ing that they are part of the
world being evoked before
them.
This world is presented as
being very carefully regulated.
Every aspect of life has its correct
procedures and, if these are fol
lowed, order will result and all
will be well. In one of the early
scenes, Nelson, as a 1930s busi
nessman at breakfast, dictates
body posture, table manners, at
titude toward school and proper
role of government to his ner
vous and squirming children
(Backus and Wright). He man

ages to throw an additional ad
monition to the maid about
seeds in his orange juice, which
"wreak havoc with the diges
tion; they take root and grow."
Ironically, the scene itself sows
seeds of discontent which also
"take root and grow." We are
presented later with an architect
(Backus), who, remembering
breakfasts of that ilk, develops a

neurotic urge to destroy dining
rooms as he remodels.
The desire for control reaches
all facets of life. Nelson, in two
very powerful scenes, portrays
rich old men trying to exert con
trol. One, visited by a grandson
requesting money for boarding
school (Backus again), torments
the boy into tearfully confessing
that he does not really want to go
before he promises the money.
The other dictates instructions to
his grown son (Hormann) for his
funeral. Nelson manages to be
both touching and funny in his
concern for detail; he insists, for
example, that his wife be buried
next to him, even if she remar
ries: "She'll come back in the

end."
