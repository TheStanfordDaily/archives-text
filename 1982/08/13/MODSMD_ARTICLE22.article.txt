The Philadelphia Story****
Festival Cinema, Palo Alto
This is one of those movies that
give headaches to people trying
to define what is and what isn't
"cinematic." The Philadelphia
Story is an unabashedly straight
forward adaptation of the Philip
Barry stage play —- no photo
graphic geegaws or editing
aoohickies have been added.
Yet, by almost any definition, it's
an exceedingly good movie. i
The key to its success can lie I
only in the talent involved in
bringing it to the screen. The di
rector was George Cukor, a i
gifted craftsman capabieof bring- j
ing fine performances out of vir- I
tuaily any actor. And the actors
aren't just anybody: the cast in
cludes Katharine Hepburn,
nostrils fiaring and indignation
aflame; Cary Grant, comic sense
perfectly tuned; and lames Stew
art, who drunkenly sings "Over
the Rainbow" as if he'd stake his
reputation on it.
Plays through Wednesday with
Adam's Rib, which features Hep
burn, Spencer Tracy, and Judy
Holliday.
— Jim Mattson

Quest for Fire ***vr"
Fox, Redwood City
A lovely surprise. lean-Jacques
Annaud's movie is an un-cynical
account of the struggle of early
homo sapiens to find fire; it is
huge and impressive but Annaud
has concentrated on a very strong
narrative line. Annaud not only
captures his hero Naoh's sense of
wonder at the discovery of new
marvels; in the best tradition of
literature and film, he shares it.
Annaud has used his actors won
derfully (Everett McGill and Rae
Dawn Chong are especially
good), though perhaps the movie
needs a little more humor.
Plays Saturday and again on
Monday with Altered States.
— Steve Vineberg

King of Hearts ***
New Varsity, Palo Alto
This enormously popular anti
war comedy is probably over
rated; it sometimes gets a little
too wrapped up in the wonder of
its own whimsy for comfort. But,
admitting that, it's still difficult to
resist Alan Bates as a World War I
soldier who, upon entering an
abandoned village, discovers that
it is still inhabitated by the resi
dent's of the town's lunatic asy
lum. Bates falls in love with the
completely looney but still very
charming Genevieve Bujold, and,
after an initial period of adjust
ment, they live happily ever after.
Phiilipe De Broca directed.
Plays Saturday through
Wednesday with Harold and
Maude.

Star Wars ★★
Park, Menlo Park
At first glance Ustunningly en
tertaining and wildly visual
2)wildly entertaining and stun
ningly visual 3)the kind of movie
nobody makes anymore.
On second thought, it's de
liberately anesthetic. Except for
Alec Guinness the actors are not
unlike Barbie dolls or escapees
from episodes of Lassie; Lucas'
decision to center the action
around members of the Pepsi
generation rankles and irks and
peeves. True 2007 fans insist that
for all of its visual achievements
Star Wars is really very bland —
even though I still don't know
what the hell was going on in
Kubrick's movie I am tempted to
agree.
— John Nielsen
Diva ****
Aquarius, Palo Alto
The high-tech chic of Diva,
directed by Jean-Jacques Beinix
and shot by Philippe Rousselot, is
dazzling. You can't complain that
Diva doesn't mean anything, be
cause Beinix's style and the
weightless shimmer of Hilton
McConnico's interior designs de
clare it in every frame. Of course,
in Diva style is content.
Its story is so beautifully
farfetched that it acquires its own
logic. It revolves around the fixa
tion of a Jules, a young mailman
(Frederic Andrei) for a black op
era singer (Wilhelmenia Wiggins
Fernandez). The singer never
records, but Jules manages to
record one of her concerts.
When that tape becomes
switched with a recording of an
expose by the mistress of a vice
chief, the movie slips into its own
giddy self-consciousness.

James Iver Mattson****
UCLA Film Archives
lim Mattson is the Hamlet of
movie critics. He has virtually
perfect taste. Jim's one of those;
critics who gives headaches to
people trying to define what is
and isn't "critical."
Director Katie Mattson must
have been in a summertime
mood when she made little Jim
my. Throughout nine volumes as
editor of Cinemascope, Jim has
delighted readers with reviews
that possess the wit and grace of
Restoration comedy. Some say
this enormously popular critic
may be over-rated; he sometimes
gets a little too wrapped up in the
wonder of his own whimsy for
comfort. But readers of the time
were simply unprepared for the
writer's elliptical narrative and
precedent-shattering technique.
Mattson's reputation as being
the greatest critic ever born
shouldn't scare you away from
reading him. If you read only one
review this summer, it should be
one of his.
Will play for the next four or so
years at the graduate program in
film studies, UCLA.

writer's elliptical narrative and
precedent-shattering technique.
Mattson's reputation as being
the greatest critic ever born
shouldn't scare you away from
reading him. If you read only one
review this summer, it should be
one of his.
Will play for the next four or so
years at the graduate program in
film studies, UCLA.

The Philadelphia Story****
Festival Cinema, Palo Alto
This is one of those movies that
give headaches to people trying
to define what is and what isn't
"cinematic." The Philadelphia
Story is an unabashedly straight
forward adaptation of the Philip
Barry stage play —- no photo
graphic geegaws or editing
aoohickies have been added.
Yet, by almost any definition, it's
an exceedingly good movie. i
The key to its success can lie I
only in the talent involved in
bringing it to the screen. The di
rector was George Cukor, a i
gifted craftsman capabieof bring- j
ing fine performances out of vir- I
tuaily any actor. And the actors
aren't just anybody: the cast in
cludes Katharine Hepburn,
nostrils fiaring and indignation
aflame; Cary Grant, comic sense
perfectly tuned; and lames Stew
art, who drunkenly sings "Over
the Rainbow" as if he'd stake his
reputation on it.
Plays through Wednesday with
Adam's Rib, which features Hep
burn, Spencer Tracy, and Judy
Holliday.

Quest for Fire ***vr"
Fox, Redwood City
A lovely surprise. lean-Jacques
Annaud's movie is an un-cynical
account of the struggle of early
homo sapiens to find fire; it is
huge and impressive but Annaud
has concentrated on a very strong
narrative line. Annaud not only
captures his hero Naoh's sense of
wonder at the discovery of new
marvels; in the best tradition of
literature and film, he shares it.
Annaud has used his actors won
derfully (Everett McGill and Rae
Dawn Chong are especially
good), though perhaps the movie
needs a little more humor.
Plays Saturday and again on
Monday with Altered States.

King of Hearts ***
New Varsity, Palo Alto
This enormously popular anti
war comedy is probably over
rated; it sometimes gets a little
too wrapped up in the wonder of
its own whimsy for comfort. But,
admitting that, it's still difficult to
resist Alan Bates as a World War I
soldier who, upon entering an
abandoned village, discovers that
it is still inhabitated by the resi
dent's of the town's lunatic asy
lum. Bates falls in love with the
completely looney but still very
charming Genevieve Bujold, and,
after an initial period of adjust
ment, they live happily ever after.
Phiilipe De Broca directed.
Plays Saturday through
Wednesday with Harold and
Maude.

Star Wars ★★
Park, Menlo Park
At first glance Ustunningly en
tertaining and wildly visual
2)wildly entertaining and stun
ningly visual 3)the kind of movie
nobody makes anymore.
On second thought, it's de
liberately anesthetic. Except for
Alec Guinness the actors are not
unlike Barbie dolls or escapees
from episodes of Lassie; Lucas'
decision to center the action
around members of the Pepsi
generation rankles and irks and
peeves. True 2007 fans insist that
for all of its visual achievements
Star Wars is really very bland —
even though I still don't know
what the hell was going on in
Kubrick's movie I am tempted to
agree.
— John Nielsen
Diva ****
Aquarius, Palo Alto
The high-tech chic of Diva,
directed by Jean-Jacques Beinix
and shot by Philippe Rousselot, is
dazzling. You can't complain that
Diva doesn't mean anything, be
cause Beinix's style and the
weightless shimmer of Hilton
McConnico's interior designs de
clare it in every frame. Of course,
in Diva style is content.
Its story is so beautifully
farfetched that it acquires its own
logic. It revolves around the fixa
tion of a Jules, a young mailman
(Frederic Andrei) for a black op
era singer (Wilhelmenia Wiggins
Fernandez). The singer never
records, but Jules manages to
record one of her concerts.
When that tape becomes
switched with a recording of an
expose by the mistress of a vice
chief, the movie slips into its own
giddy self-consciousness.

James Iver Mattson****
UCLA Film Archives
lim Mattson is the Hamlet of
movie critics. He has virtually
perfect taste. Jim's one of those;
critics who gives headaches to
people trying to define what is
and isn't "critical."
Director Katie Mattson must
have been in a summertime
mood when she made little Jim
my. Throughout nine volumes as
editor of Cinemascope, Jim has
delighted readers with reviews
that possess the wit and grace of
Restoration comedy. Some say
this enormously popular critic
may be over-rated; he sometimes
gets a little too wrapped up in the
wonder of his own whimsy for
comfort. But readers of the time
were simply unprepared for the
writer's elliptical narrative and
precedent-shattering technique.
Mattson's reputation as being
the greatest critic ever born
shouldn't scare you away from
reading him. If you read only one
review this summer, it should be
one of his.
Will play for the next four or so
years at the graduate program in
film studies, UCLA.
