Actor Henry Fonda dies
Los Angeles — Actor Henry Fonda, who for half a cen
tury captured the essence of the gentle but strong Amer
ican hero as one of Hollywood's biggest stars, died yes
terday after a long battle against heart disease. He was 77.
Fonda, who appeared in more than 80 movies, including
The Grapes of Wrath, Twelve Angry Men and Mister
Roberts, but won his first acting Oscar only this year for
On Golden Pond, died at 7:55 a.m. PDT at Cedars-Sinai
Medical Center.
From the beginning of his career, Fonda was one of the
most versatile of screen performers, his lanky frame and
matter-of-fact Midwestern speech fitting a wide range of
roles — from the tragic, searching Abe Lincoln in Young
Mr. Lincoln to the light comedy of The Lady Eve and The
Male Animal.
Fonda's wife of 16 years, Shirlee, was at his side when
he died. Daughter Jane Fonda and son Peter Fonda were
en route to the hospital at the time of death.
"He was comfortable and was in no pain," Mrs. Fonda
said later as she and his children met with reporters out
side the Fondas' Bel-Air home. "He had a good night. He
talked with all of us and he was conscious at all times. He
woke up this morning, he sat up and just stopped breath
ing."
Family spokeswoman Pat Kingsley said Fonda died of
"respiratory failure brought on by heart disease." She
explained that Fonda suffered from an "enlargement of
the heart muscles, which caused a loss of elasticity of the
heart and its ability to pump blood."
Another family spokesman, Gary Springer, said there
would be no funeral. He said the body would be
cremated "as per Mr. Fonda's wishes."
Fonda, who had been in failing health for the past 18
months and had worn a heart pacemaker since 1974, en
tered the hospital for the final time Sunday to have his
heart medication checked after doctors said his condi
tion had worsened.
PLO calls for outside intervention
Beirut — Israeli jets today flew their heaviest strikes on
west Beirut in the 9-week-old war. Lebanese leaders sus
pended talks with the United States on evacuating the
PLO and appealed to President Ronald Reagan and King
Fahd of Saudi Arabia to intervene to stop the bloodshed.
The more than 10 hours of raids ended in late after
noon with Israel declaring a new cease-fire after Fahd
called Reagan and Reagan phoned Israeli Prime Minister
Menachem Begin to "express his outrage over this latest
round of massive military action."
White House deputy press secretary Larry Speakes,
who reported the phone conversation, refused to dis
cuss whether Reagan threatened to suspend U.S. arms or
take other retaliation if the raids continued.
But Israel radio said the United States warned it might
drop out of the talks if the air attacks continued. The
State Department said the Israelis advised they intended
to stop air attacks to keep the talks alive, and Israel radio
said Defense Minister Ariel Sharon was criticized for
launching the air attacks without Begin's approval.
Reagan protests Israeli attacks
Washington — President Ronald Reagan, shocked and
outraged at Israel's renewed heavy bombardment of
West Beirut, told Prime Minister Menachem Begin yes
terday that the intense fighting had derailed U.S.-spon
sored efforts to get the Palestine Liberation Organization
out of the city just as the negotiations were "at the point
of success."
A sternly worded White House statement, the second

public criticism of Israel in just over a week, said a
"shocked" president had expressed "outrage over this
latest round of massive military action." Reagan, in a 10-
minute telephone talk with Begin, "made it clear that it is
imperative that the cease-fire in place be observed
absolutely in order for negotiations to proceed," the
statement said.
Hours earlier, responding to a flurry of cabled and tel
ephoned messages from special envoy Philip Habib in
Beirut, the administration instructed Samuel Lewis, the
U.S. ambassador to Israel, to deliver a firm message to
Begin. Israeli radio said the message threatened to end
the mediation talks and bring Habib home if the Israeli
bombing did not end.
Habib's negotiating efforts were broken off yesterday,
r.artly at the request of Lebanon's prime minister and
partly because Habib simply could not meet with the ne
gotiators because of the bombardment, administration
officials aid.
White House spokesman Larry Speakes and other ad
ministration officials dismissed as "not accurate" the Is
raeli radio report that Lewis had threatened to end
Habib's mission. Rather, a State Department official said,
Lewis was instructed to emphasize that Habib was physi
cally unable to carry out his contacts with Lebanese au
thorities under the intense bombardment.
"The language meant: it's impossible to continue ne
gotiations as long as there's a fight," Speakes said. "But
we didn't threaten to bring Habib back or anything like
that."
Trident homecoming protested
Bangor, Wash. — The nation's deadliest nuclear
armed submarine sailed into its new home port in Wash
ington on Wednesday, escorted by Coast Guard vessels
routing protesters in a flotilla of small boats with fire
hoses.
At least 14 people opposed to nuclear weapons were
arrested, including six who landed in the drink when the
Coast Guard doused a protest sailboat, but there were no
injuries.
One small boat slipped through the Coast Guard se
curity net and circled within 100 feet of the 560-foot-long
Trident submarine USS Ohio before it was swamped by
the propwash of a helicopter.
The Coast Guard said 14 people were arrested on vari
ous charges — including failure to obey a federal officer
— and an unspecified number of others were detained.
Blockade leaders said there were 18 preliminary arrests
and 11 people were unaccounted for but believed to be
in Coast Guard custody.
The protesters, 49 people in two large and about 20
small boats, had set sail shortly after dawn to await the
Ohio in Admiralty Inlet, north of Hood Canal.
Reagan campaigns for tax bill
Washington — The Reagan administration stepped up
its campaign yesterday for passage of a $98.9 billion tax
bill, with groups of congressmen summoned to the
White House and new allies enlisted in the business
community.
But Rep. Robert Michel (R-lll.), House Republican
leader, said the struggle to pass the tax bill would be
harder than any of the president's previous victories in
budget and tax battles.
The legislation has been temporarily stalled as House
and Senate conferees have disagreed on provisions deal
ing with welfare spending. The legislation calls for $98.9
billion in tax increases, and spending cuts of $17.5 billion
to reduce the federal deficit and help bring down in
terest rates.

With the president spending several hours daily talk
ing with members of Congress at the White House or
making telephone calls seeking support, the adminis
tration is looking ahead to next week when the bill is ex
pected to reach the House and Senate floors for final ac
tion.
Campaign help for Republican House members may
depend on their support for the bill, White House
spokesman Larry Speakes said yesterday, referring to
speeches by Cabinet members and other administration
officials on behalf of GOP candidates.
"I wouldn't call it pressure, I'd call it persuasion,"
Speakes said.
The White House must do its biggest selling campaign
among the ranks of the 192 Republicans in the House,
many of whom are opposed to a tax increase, particularly
in an election year.
The Republicans were virtually unanimous in backing
the Reagan tax and budget cuts last year, and this year's
budget reduction. On this tax bill, however, "I'll be
scratching like the devil to get 100 votes," Michel, the
House minority leader, told reporters.
Senate debates immigration law
Washington — The Senate, taking up the first com
prehensive overhaul of the nation's immigration law in
30 years, began debate yesterday on a bill that would es
tablish jail penalties for people who persist in hiring il
legal aliens.
Sponsors said the measure would help the United ol its
borders."
Sen. Edward Kennedy (D-Mass.), opposing major pro
visions of the bill, said, "I believe we must be extremely
cautious to avoid legislation that raises the level of in
tolerance and discrimination in our society."
Kennedy said the proposed employer sanctions could
lead to widespread discrimination against minority
groups, particularly Hispanics.
Jet crash report amended
Washington — Faulty air traffic control procedures
were partially responsible for the mid-air collision of a
Pacific Southwest Airlines jet and a small private plane at
San Diego on Sept. 25,1978, a federal safety board said
yesterday in amending its original report on the acci
dent.
The PSA 727 jet was approaching Lindbergh Field
when it collided with a small Cessna plane on a training
flight and crashed into a residential area, killing 144 per
sons, including seven on the ground.
The National Transportation Safety Board on April 20,
1979, initially attributed the accident to the three-man
PSA flight crew. In its finding then, the board concluded
that the probable cause of the accident — at the time the
nation's worst air disaster — was the flight crew's failure
to maintain visual separation clearance from other air
craft and failure to alert air traffic controllers when they
lost sight of other planes.
The board's finding was challenged by the Air Line Pi
lots Association, which petitioned the board for a re
view.
The pilot group contended that the plane's crew
members never saw the small Cessna plane involved in
the accident, and that they had received insufficient in
formation from controllers about other air traffic in the
area.
