SCHEDULE 3
What to do, when and how to do it, where to go — the whole

scoop for the craziness
dubbed "1982
Orientation Week."
Last year, an orientee
said, "It's like summer
camp with beer."
Should be lots of fun
. . . but wait till classes
start.

HISTORY & LEXICON 5
In the beginning, Leland Stanford created the University.

And the University was
without form and void.
And Leland said, "Let
there be a Quad, a Mem
Chu, a Tree, Hoover's
Last Erection, Thunder
Chickens . . . . " And
there was.

COUNSELING & TRADITIONS /
You got into Stanford. But despite all the rumors to the

contrary, Stanford can
be tough once you get
in. If it all gets to be too
much, many counseling
services are available
on campus. Should that
fail, kiss a senior in the
Quad at midnight
under a full moon. It's a
tradition.

POLITICS 10
The campus has seen its share of '60s-style activism — a sit

in in theOld Union,
rocks thrown through
windows, tear gas
dispersing protesters at
the Stanford Research
Institute (now SRI). In
the '80s, the political
activity is more quiet
but, some say, more
effective.

RESEARCH 1 1
The University, one of the largest research institutions in

the country, is on the
cutting edge of much
academic investigation
Said one scientist at
the Stanford Linear
Accelerator Center,
"Finding the ultimate
structure . . . at this
point it's almost at
mind-blowing state."

GRADSTUDENTS 12
They do a major part of the University's work and research.

Yet grad students often
feel isblated and cut off
from other grad
students as well as
undergraduates. Said
one grad student,
"Grad life is an illusion
— it's what you make
of it."

WOMEN 1 J
"Take back the night." Women's groups on campus, long

active, became
especially visible last
year. A series of rapes
on campus prompted
women to organize
rallies, debates, and
discussion groups.

ETCETERA 14
A galleria of miscellanea: where to get your checks cashed

for less; how to find
your way around
Stanford museums, the
Medical Center, SLAC;
how to cure the
homesick blues with a
family away from
home.
