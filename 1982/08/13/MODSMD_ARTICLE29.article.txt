## Stanford A HISTORY 
### 
w, 11 David Starr
Jordan arrived at Stanford in the
summer of 1891 to he the Uni
versity's first president, he found
the countryside enthralling:
"The Santa Clara Valley," he
wrote in his autobiography, "ex
tends southward 50 miles and
more from near the head of San
Francisco Bay. Bounding it on
the southwest rises . . . the Sierra
de la Santa Cruz — 'a misty camp
of mountains pitched tumult
ously' ....
"Immediately behind the
University estate and forming its
higher background is the
wooded Sierra Morena, its cloak
ot redwood, oak and madrono
diversified bv thickets of cheini
sal
"On the east, opposing the
green ridges ol the Holy Cross,
stretches the long, relatively bar
ren and treeless Sierra del Monte

Diablo."
In this sheltered area 30 miles
south of San Francisco, its favor
able climate assured by its situa
tion between bay and ocean, its
meadows patterned with ancicnt
oaks, Senator and Mrs. I.eland
Stanford established their uni
versity on the site of their subur
ban home. Palo Alto.
The first parcel, bought in
1576, consisted of 650 acres
along San Francisquito Creek,
and subsequent purchases ran
the total to 5250 acres.,
The whole of the Stanfords'
land was given to the University
in the ISSS Grant of Endow
ment with the stipulation that it
should never be sold.
To this land. Senator Stanford
brought Francis Walker, presi
dent of Massachusetts Institute
of Technology and the promi
nent landscape architect. Fre
derick Law Olmsted, in the
summer of I KB6.
They gave serious thought to
locating the campus in the footh
ills of the ranch, so as to take
advantage of the magnificent
view of the bay. but they finally
decided to drive in a stake in the

grainfields below, at a point that
marks tine corner of the Inner
Quadrangle. The senator felt the
flat site was more practical for
later expansion.
Olmsted worked out the gen
eral concept for the grounds and
the buildings, but it remained for
the young Boston architect,
Charles Allerton Coolidge, to
develop this concept in the style
of his late mentor, Henry Hobbs
Richardson, considered the most
eminent architect of his time.
The style is called Richardso
nian Romanesque, and it follows
the European Romanesque,
which is characterized by re
ctilinear stone buildings joined
by covered arcasdes formed of
successive half-circle arches
supported by short columns with
decorated capitals.
The inner quad of 12 clas
sroom buildings — with the cent
ral place reserved for the future
Memorial Church — and three
engineering buildings, Encina

Hall for men and Roble Hall for
women were ready for the Uni
versity's opening on October 1,
1891.
"These long corridors with
their stately pillars," Dr. Jordan
said at the dedication, "will have
their part in the students' train
ing. Each stone in the quad
rangle shall teach its lesson of
grace and genuiness."
President Andrew White of
Cornell pronounced the Stan
ford buildings the most beautiful
college architecture in America.
But just before five on the
morning of April IS. 1906, the
ground beneath Stanford's new
buildings shook for 45 seconds.
The great earthquake killed two
men on campus and caused mill
ions of dollars of damage.
The ponderous church tower,
with its clocks, chimes and spire,
crashed into the chancel of
Memorial Church, and the con
cussion blew out the front wall.
The rose window and the huge
Venetian mosaic of the Sermon
on the Mount that had graced the
facade lay as rubble in the inner
quad.
Memorial Arch, the central
structure of the outer quad —

100 feet high and decorated with
a frieze depicting the march of
civilization — was damaged
beyond repair. So were a library
and gymnasium that were just
short of completion. None of
these was replaced.
Reconstruction cost more
than $2 million. Classes were
dismissed until the fall. Seniors
in what has come to he known as
"The Earthquake Class" were
voted their degrees in May.
It was a setback, but only a
temporary one, for the young
university quickly rebuilt, pursu
ing a construction project that
was begun in 1886 and that has
been intermittently continued up
to the present.
The construction has taken
place on approximately 5000
acres reserved by the Board of
Trustees for educational uses.
This is the heartland of the Stan
ford land, comprised for the
most part of the central portion
running from El Camino Real to
the back boundary in the footh
ills.
The areas designated for light
lie in open land, including the
arboretum, golf course and the
foothill lands used for space
probing antennae and research
in nuclear physics and biological
sciences.
The inner and outer quads oc
cupy 17 acres at the heart of the
academic area. The inner quad's
12 classroom buildings, two of
which are now used by the presi
dent and his staff, date from the
time the University opened in
1891, while the outer quad was
completed in 1903, the same
year that Memorial Church was
dedicated.
Buildings in the outer quad are
being brought up to
earthquake-proof standards by
an "inside-out" process of con
struction to preserve the
sandstone exterior.
The church represents the
Stanfords' deep religious faith,
though they were followers of no
particular denomination. In the
Founding Grant, they directed
the trustees "to have taught in
the University the immortality of
the soul, the existence of an all
wise and benevolent Creator,
and that obedience to His laws is
the highest duty of man."
To serve the widest needs of
the campus community, they de
creed that the church and the
University were to be nonsecta
rian and at no time tied to any
particular denomination.
In the original plans, the cent
ral site now occupied by the

church was reserved for it,
though construction was deter
red. When Senator Stanford died
in 1893, his widow determined
that the church would be built as
a memorial to him.
Mrs. Stanford chose the final
designs for windows and
mosaics, traveling to Italy to ap
prove the mosaic sketches, and
obtaining papal permission to
copy the Roselli fresco of the
"Last Supper" in the Sistinc
Chapel.
The Venetian mosaics which
cover the interior walls are
largely Old Testament, depicting
the history of redemption. The
largest mosaic, however, oc
cupies most of the facade of the
church and, with 47 figures, de
picts the welcoming of the right
eous into heaven as described in
the New Testament text of
Matthew 25:34. It is frequently
mistaken for the Sermon on the
Mount.
After the earthquake of 1906,
the structure was completely
dismantled and rebuilt around a
steel framework. Another set of
mosaics was brought from Ven
ice, but the 80-foot spire, hous
ing clocks and chimes, was never
rebuilt.

T
he campus land
mark. 285-foot Hoover Tower,
was dedicated at the University's
50th anniversary in 1941. The
tower and the adjoining l.ou
Henry Hoover Building (opened
in lv(i7) house the vast
documentary collections of the
Hoover Institution on War, Re
volution and Peace — millions of
items that include books, docu
ments, files, manuscripts,
diaries, pamphlets, posters,
maps and photos. The Herbert
Hoover Memorial Building,
completed in 197X. honors the
former president's humanitarian
works.
Herbert Hoover started the
library collection during World
War I when he headed the

Commission for Relief in Bel
gium. Struck with the thought
that his relict work placed him in
a position to document the war.
Hoover shipped crates of mate
rial to the library at Stanford, his
alma mater, and laid the literary
foundation of the Hoover In
stitution.
At the 1941 ceremony.
Hoover said: "The purpose of
this institution is to promote
peace. Its records stand as a chal
lenge to those who promote war.

They should attract those who
search for peace."
The Institution has more
material on communism than
can be found anywhere outside
Russia. It has more data on Mus
solini than can he found in lt;il\.
It also probably has the most
complete record on Hitler and
the Nazi movement extant.
With these resources, the in
stitution serves as a center for

advanced study and research on
problems of social, political and
economic change in the 20th
century.
Across from Hoover Tower
sits Memorial Hall (Au
ditorium), dedicated in 1937.
Built primarily through student
contributions as a memorial to
Stanford students and faculty
slain in World War 1, the au
ditorium also contains in the
foyer plaques honoring the Stan
ford dead of World War II The
main auditorium seats 1700 and
the Little Theater seats 200.
Just south of the quad is White
Memorial Plaza, a 200.000
square foot landscaped area do
nated to the University by Mr.
and Mrs. Raymond White in
memory of their sons. The focal
point of the pla/a is a tall, free
form fountain executed in
bron/e by San Francisco sculptor

Aristides Demetrios.
Bordered by the bookstore,
post office, Tresidder Memorial
Union, the music building and
the Old Union — which contains
several student services — the
pla/a is a campus crossroads.
The Radioscience Laboratory
conducts at its antenna farm one
of the most productive and var
ied programs of ionospheric and
interplanetary radio investiga

tion. Its scientists made the first
radar contact with the sun.
T
JML he most spec
tacular of the antennae, the 70-
ti n, 150-foot diameter steel and
aluminum "Dish," has explored
the sun. planets and interplanet
ary gases by means of a radar
beam.
The Stanford Linear Ac
celerator Center (SI.AC) oper
ates a two-mile-long atom
smasher on 460 acres along Sand
Hill Road. The $114 million
machine, financed by the Atomic
Energy Commission and com
pleted in 1966, fires the electron
down a straight, slender tube
rather than whirling protons in
circles, as most atom smashers
do. The machine develops an
energv of 20 billion electron

volts.
As the'7os end, the University
draws to a close its so-called
"Second Great Stone Age," a
building boom launched in the
early in which the Univer
sity has attempted to meet its big
post-war expansion in students
and faculty.
In the last 20 years, the Uni
versity has raised some $325

Now. however, as the Univer
sity stabilizes its population, it
•plans fewer ma jor building pro

The University's appearance
will not change dramatically in
the next decade, at least.
But construction projects such
as the new music center and
dormitory do depend largely on
the beneticience ol I niversity
donors (including the federal
government), and in tins in

may have difficulty raising the"
necessary funds.

Stanford may not always be as
lucky as ii was recently, for in
stance. when a middle-aged
couple v\ ho like to jog in the area
donated 5150,000 to renovate
and replant the "Oval" in front
of the main entrance.
II Stanford does attract the re
quired support, it might continue
to build right through the 100 th
anniversary of that day in INNh
when Senator Stanford decided

to locate his new university on
the site of his horse farm.
The Senator felt that any land
good enough for breeding horses
ought to be good enough for
teaching students.

The church represents the
Stanfords' deep religious faith,
though they were followers of no
particular denomination. In the
Founding Grant, they directed
the trustees "to have taught in
the University the immortality of
the soul, the existence of an all
wise and benevolent Creator,
and that obedience to His laws is
the highest duty of man."
To serve the widest needs of
the campus community, they de
creed that the church and the
University were to be nonsecta
rian and at no time tied to any
particular denomination.
In the original plans, the cent
ral site now occupied by the

church was reserved for it,
though construction was deter
red. When Senator Stanford died
in 1893, his widow determined
that the church would be built as
a memorial to him.
Mrs. Stanford chose the final
designs for windows and
mosaics, traveling to Italy to ap
prove the mosaic sketches, and
obtaining papal permission to
copy the Roselli fresco of the
"Last Supper" in the Sistinc
Chapel.
The Venetian mosaics which
cover the interior walls are
largely Old Testament, depicting
the history of redemption. The
largest mosaic, however, oc
cupies most of the facade of the
church and, with 47 figures, de
picts the welcoming of the right
eous into heaven as described in
the New Testament text of
Matthew 25:34. It is frequently
mistaken for the Sermon on the
Mount.
After the earthquake of 1906,
the structure was completely
dismantled and rebuilt around a
steel framework. Another set of
mosaics was brought from Ven
ice, but the 80-foot spire, hous
ing clocks and chimes, was never
rebuilt.

T
he campus land
mark. 285-foot Hoover Tower,
was dedicated at the University's
50th anniversary in 1941. The
tower and the adjoining l.ou
Henry Hoover Building (opened
in lv(i7) house the vast
documentary collections of the
Hoover Institution on War, Re
volution and Peace — millions of
items that include books, docu
ments, files, manuscripts,
diaries, pamphlets, posters,
maps and photos. The Herbert
Hoover Memorial Building,
completed in 197X. honors the
former president's humanitarian
works.
Herbert Hoover started the
library collection during World
War I when he headed the

Commission for Relief in Bel
gium. Struck with the thought
that his relict work placed him in
a position to document the war.
Hoover shipped crates of mate
rial to the library at Stanford, his
alma mater, and laid the literary
foundation of the Hoover In
stitution.
At the 1941 ceremony.
Hoover said: "The purpose of
this institution is to promote
peace. Its records stand as a chal
lenge to those who promote war.

They should attract those who
search for peace."
The Institution has more
material on communism than
can be found anywhere outside
Russia. It has more data on Mus
solini than can he found in lt;il\.
It also probably has the most
complete record on Hitler and
the Nazi movement extant.
With these resources, the in
stitution serves as a center for

advanced study and research on
problems of social, political and
economic change in the 20th
century.
Across from Hoover Tower
sits Memorial Hall (Au
ditorium), dedicated in 1937.
Built primarily through student
contributions as a memorial to
Stanford students and faculty
slain in World War 1, the au
ditorium also contains in the
foyer plaques honoring the Stan
ford dead of World War II The
main auditorium seats 1700 and
the Little Theater seats 200.
Just south of the quad is White
Memorial Plaza, a 200.000
square foot landscaped area do
nated to the University by Mr.
and Mrs. Raymond White in
memory of their sons. The focal
point of the pla/a is a tall, free
form fountain executed in
bron/e by San Francisco sculptor

Aristides Demetrios.
Bordered by the bookstore,
post office, Tresidder Memorial
Union, the music building and
the Old Union — which contains
several student services — the

1980: Storey House burns
w, 11 David Starr
Jordan arrived at Stanford in the
summer of 1891 to he the Uni
versity's first president, he found
the countryside enthralling:
"The Santa Clara Valley," he
wrote in his autobiography, "ex
tends southward 50 miles and
more from near the head of San
Francisco Bay. Bounding it on
the southwest rises . . . the Sierra
de la Santa Cruz — 'a misty camp
of mountains pitched tumult
ously' ....
"Immediately behind the
University estate and forming its
higher background is the
wooded Sierra Morena, its cloak
ot redwood, oak and madrono
diversified bv thickets of cheini
sal
"On the east, opposing the
green ridges ol the Holy Cross,
stretches the long, relatively bar
ren and treeless Sierra del Monte

Diablo."
In this sheltered area 30 miles
south of San Francisco, its favor
able climate assured by its situa
tion between bay and ocean, its
meadows patterned with ancicnt
oaks, Senator and Mrs. I.eland
Stanford established their uni
versity on the site of their subur
ban home. Palo Alto.
The first parcel, bought in
1576, consisted of 650 acres
along San Francisquito Creek,
and subsequent purchases ran
the total to 5250 acres.,
The whole of the Stanfords'
land was given to the University
in the ISSS Grant of Endow
ment with the stipulation that it
should never be sold.
To this land. Senator Stanford
brought Francis Walker, presi
dent of Massachusetts Institute
of Technology and the promi
nent landscape architect. Fre
derick Law Olmsted, in the
summer of I KB6.
They gave serious thought to
locating the campus in the footh
ills of the ranch, so as to take
advantage of the magnificent
view of the bay. but they finally
decided to drive in a stake in the

grainfields below, at a point that
marks tine corner of the Inner
Quadrangle. The senator felt the
flat site was more practical for
later expansion.
Olmsted worked out the gen
eral concept for the grounds and
the buildings, but it remained for
the young Boston architect,
Charles Allerton Coolidge, to
develop this concept in the style
of his late mentor, Henry Hobbs
Richardson, considered the most
eminent architect of his time.
The style is called Richardso
nian Romanesque, and it follows
the European Romanesque,
which is characterized by re
ctilinear stone buildings joined
by covered arcasdes formed of
successive half-circle arches
supported by short columns with
decorated capitals.
The inner quad of 12 clas
sroom buildings — with the cent
ral place reserved for the future
Memorial Church — and three
engineering buildings, Encina

Hall for men and Roble Hall for
women were ready for the Uni
versity's opening on October 1,
1891.
"These long corridors with
their stately pillars," Dr. Jordan
said at the dedication, "will have
their part in the students' train
ing. Each stone in the quad
rangle shall teach its lesson of
grace and genuiness."
President Andrew White of
Cornell pronounced the Stan
ford buildings the most beautiful
college architecture in America.
But just before five on the
morning of April IS. 1906, the
ground beneath Stanford's new
buildings shook for 45 seconds.
The great earthquake killed two
men on campus and caused mill
ions of dollars of damage.
The ponderous church tower,
with its clocks, chimes and spire,
crashed into the chancel of
Memorial Church, and the con
cussion blew out the front wall.
The rose window and the huge
Venetian mosaic of the Sermon
on the Mount that had graced the
facade lay as rubble in the inner
quad.
Memorial Arch, the central
structure of the outer quad —

100 feet high and decorated with
a frieze depicting the march of
civilization — was damaged
beyond repair. So were a library
and gymnasium that were just
short of completion. None of
these was replaced.
Reconstruction cost more
than $2 million. Classes were
dismissed until the fall. Seniors
in what has come to he known as
"The Earthquake Class" were
voted their degrees in May.
It was a setback, but only a
temporary one, for the young
university quickly rebuilt, pursu
ing a construction project that
was begun in 1886 and that has
been intermittently continued up
to the present.
The construction has taken
place on approximately 5000
acres reserved by the Board of
Trustees for educational uses.
This is the heartland of the Stan
ford land, comprised for the
most part of the central portion
running from El Camino Real to
the back boundary in the footh
ills.
The areas designated for light
lie in open land, including the
arboretum, golf course and the
foothill lands used for space
probing antennae and research
in nuclear physics and biological
sciences.
The inner and outer quads oc
cupy 17 acres at the heart of the
academic area. The inner quad's
12 classroom buildings, two of
which are now used by the presi
dent and his staff, date from the
time the University opened in
1891, while the outer quad was
completed in 1903, the same
year that Memorial Church was
dedicated.
Buildings in the outer quad are
being brought up to
earthquake-proof standards by
an "inside-out" process of con
struction to preserve the
sandstone exterior.
The church represents the
Stanfords' deep religious faith,
though they were followers of no
particular denomination. In the
Founding Grant, they directed
the trustees "to have taught in
the University the immortality of
the soul, the existence of an all
wise and benevolent Creator,

1980: Storey House burns
w, 11 David Starr
Jordan arrived at Stanford in the
summer of 1891 to he the Uni
versity's first president, he found
the countryside enthralling:
"The Santa Clara Valley," he
wrote in his autobiography, "ex
tends southward 50 miles and
more from near the head of San
Francisco Bay. Bounding it on
the southwest rises . . . the Sierra
de la Santa Cruz — 'a misty camp
of mountains pitched tumult
ously' ....
"Immediately behind the
University estate and forming its
higher background is the
wooded Sierra Morena, its cloak
ot redwood, oak and madrono
diversified bv thickets of cheini
sal
"On the east, opposing the
green ridges ol the Holy Cross,
stretches the long, relatively bar
ren and treeless Sierra del Monte

Diablo."
In this sheltered area 30 miles
south of San Francisco, its favor
able climate assured by its situa
tion between bay and ocean, its
meadows patterned with ancicnt
oaks, Senator and Mrs. I.eland
Stanford established their uni
versity on the site of their subur
ban home. Palo Alto.
The first parcel, bought in
1576, consisted of 650 acres
along San Francisquito Creek,
and subsequent purchases ran
the total to 5250 acres.,
The whole of the Stanfords'
land was given to the University
in the ISSS Grant of Endow
ment with the stipulation that it
should never be sold.
To this land. Senator Stanford
brought Francis Walker, presi
dent of Massachusetts Institute
of Technology and the promi
nent landscape architect. Fre
derick Law Olmsted, in the
summer of I KB6.
They gave serious thought to
locating the campus in the footh
ills of the ranch, so as to take
advantage of the magnificent
view of the bay. but they finally
decided to drive in a stake in the

grainfields below, at a point that
marks tine corner of the Inner
Quadrangle. The senator felt the
flat site was more practical for
later expansion.
Olmsted worked out the gen
eral concept for the grounds and
the buildings, but it remained for
the young Boston architect,
Charles Allerton Coolidge, to
develop this concept in the style
of his late mentor, Henry Hobbs
Richardson, considered the most
eminent architect of his time.
The style is called Richardso
nian Romanesque, and it follows
the European Romanesque,
which is characterized by re
ctilinear stone buildings joined
by covered arcasdes formed of
successive half-circle arches
supported by short columns with
decorated capitals.
The inner quad of 12 clas
sroom buildings — with the cent
ral place reserved for the future
Memorial Church — and three
engineering buildings, Encina

Hall for men and Roble Hall for
women were ready for the Uni
versity's opening on October 1,
1891.
"These long corridors with
their stately pillars," Dr. Jordan
said at the dedication, "will have
their part in the students' train
ing. Each stone in the quad
rangle shall teach its lesson of
grace and genuiness."
President Andrew White of
Cornell pronounced the Stan
ford buildings the most beautiful
college architecture in America.
But just before five on the
morning of April IS. 1906, the
ground beneath Stanford's new
buildings shook for 45 seconds.
The great earthquake killed two
men on campus and caused mill
ions of dollars of damage.
The ponderous church tower,
with its clocks, chimes and spire,
crashed into the chancel of
Memorial Church, and the con
cussion blew out the front wall.
The rose window and the huge
Venetian mosaic of the Sermon
on the Mount that had graced the
facade lay as rubble in the inner
quad.
Memorial Arch, the central
structure of the outer quad —

100 feet high and decorated with
a frieze depicting the march of
civilization — was damaged
beyond repair. So were a library
and gymnasium that were just
short of completion. None of
these was replaced.
Reconstruction cost more
than $2 million. Classes were
dismissed until the fall. Seniors
in what has come to he known as
"The Earthquake Class" were
voted their degrees in May.
It was a setback, but only a
temporary one, for the young
university quickly rebuilt, pursu
ing a construction project that
was begun in 1886 and that has
been intermittently continued up
to the present.
The construction has taken
place on approximately 5000
acres reserved by the Board of
Trustees for educational uses.
This is the heartland of the Stan
ford land, comprised for the
most part of the central portion
running from El Camino Real to
the back boundary in the footh
ills.
The areas designated for light
lie in open land, including the
arboretum, golf course and the
foothill lands used for space
probing antennae and research
in nuclear physics and biological
sciences.
The inner and outer quads oc
cupy 17 acres at the heart of the
academic area. The inner quad's
12 classroom buildings, two of
which are now used by the presi
dent and his staff, date from the
time the University opened in
1891, while the outer quad was
completed in 1903, the same
year that Memorial Church was
dedicated.
Buildings in the outer quad are
being brought up to
earthquake-proof standards by
an "inside-out" process of con
struction to preserve the
sandstone exterior.
The church represents the
Stanfords' deep religious faith,
though they were followers of no
particular denomination. In the
Founding Grant, they directed
the trustees "to have taught in
the University the immortality of
the soul, the existence of an all
wise and benevolent Creator,
and that obedience to His laws is
the highest duty of man."
To serve the widest needs of
the campus community, they de
creed that the church and the
University were to be nonsecta
rian and at no time tied to any
particular denomination.
In the original plans, the cent
ral site now occupied by the

church was reserved for it,
though construction was deter
red. When Senator Stanford died
in 1893, his widow determined
that the church would be built as
a memorial to him.
Mrs. Stanford chose the final
designs for windows and
mosaics, traveling to Italy to ap
prove the mosaic sketches, and
obtaining papal permission to
copy the Roselli fresco of the
"Last Supper" in the Sistinc
Chapel.
The Venetian mosaics which
cover the interior walls are
largely Old Testament, depicting
the history of redemption. The
largest mosaic, however, oc
cupies most of the facade of the
church and, with 47 figures, de
picts the welcoming of the right
eous into heaven as described in
the New Testament text of
Matthew 25:34. It is frequently
mistaken for the Sermon on the
Mount.
After the earthquake of 1906,
the structure was completely
dismantled and rebuilt around a
steel framework. Another set of
mosaics was brought from Ven
ice, but the 80-foot spire, hous
ing clocks and chimes, was never
rebuilt.

T
he campus land
mark. 285-foot Hoover Tower,
was dedicated at the University's
50th anniversary in 1941. The
tower and the adjoining l.ou
Henry Hoover Building (opened
in lv(i7) house the vast
documentary collections of the
Hoover Institution on War, Re
volution and Peace — millions of
items that include books, docu
ments, files, manuscripts,
diaries, pamphlets, posters,
maps and photos. The Herbert
Hoover Memorial Building,
completed in 197X. honors the
former president's humanitarian
works.
Herbert Hoover started the
library collection during World
War I when he headed the

Commission for Relief in Bel
gium. Struck with the thought
that his relict work placed him in
a position to document the war.
Hoover shipped crates of mate
rial to the library at Stanford, his
alma mater, and laid the literary
foundation of the Hoover In
stitution.
At the 1941 ceremony.
Hoover said: "The purpose of
this institution is to promote
peace. Its records stand as a chal
lenge to those who promote war.

They should attract those who
search for peace."
The Institution has more
material on communism than
can be found anywhere outside
Russia. It has more data on Mus
solini than can he found in lt;il\.
It also probably has the most
complete record on Hitler and
the Nazi movement extant.
With these resources, the in
stitution serves as a center for

advanced study and research on
problems of social, political and
economic change in the 20th
century.
Across from Hoover Tower
sits Memorial Hall (Au
ditorium), dedicated in 1937.
Built primarily through student
contributions as a memorial to
Stanford students and faculty
slain in World War 1, the au
ditorium also contains in the
foyer plaques honoring the Stan
ford dead of World War II The
main auditorium seats 1700 and
the Little Theater seats 200.
Just south of the quad is White
Memorial Plaza, a 200.000
square foot landscaped area do
nated to the University by Mr.
and Mrs. Raymond White in
memory of their sons. The focal
point of the pla/a is a tall, free
form fountain executed in
bron/e by San Francisco sculptor

Aristides Demetrios.
Bordered by the bookstore,
post office, Tresidder Memorial
Union, the music building and
the Old Union — which contains
several student services — the
pla/a is a campus crossroads.
The Radioscience Laboratory
conducts at its antenna farm one
of the most productive and var
ied programs of ionospheric and
interplanetary radio investiga

tion. Its scientists made the first
radar contact with the sun.
T
JML he most spec
tacular of the antennae, the 70-
ti n, 150-foot diameter steel and
aluminum "Dish," has explored
the sun. planets and interplanet
ary gases by means of a radar
beam.
The Stanford Linear Ac
celerator Center (SI.AC) oper
ates a two-mile-long atom
smasher on 460 acres along Sand
Hill Road. The $114 million
machine, financed by the Atomic
Energy Commission and com
pleted in 1966, fires the electron
down a straight, slender tube
rather than whirling protons in
circles, as most atom smashers
do. The machine develops an
energv of 20 billion electron

volts.
As the'7os end, the University
draws to a close its so-called
"Second Great Stone Age," a
building boom launched in the
early in which the Univer
sity has attempted to meet its big
post-war expansion in students
and faculty.
In the last 20 years, the Uni
versity has raised some $325
