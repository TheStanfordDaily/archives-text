# Lantos'resolution supports defecting Chinese tennis star
## 
### Bill Ainsworth 
Rep. Tom Lantos (D-Calif.) of
San Mateo introduced a resolu
tion in the House last week to
support Chinese tennis star Hu
Na's application for political asy
lum in the United States. Well
known Rep. Jack Kemp (R-New
York) has signed on as a co
sponsor.
Na has not appeared in public
since she disappeared from an
international tennis tournament
in Santa Clara several weeks ago.
However, her lawyers have filed
an application for political asy
lum for her.
The resolution, according to
Lantos' Executive Assistant Bryan
Rosman, has no binding power

on the Immigration and Natural
ization Service, which must
make the final decision on the
case. Instead, Rosman said, it
gives the agency a sense of Con
gressional support for Na.
Rosman said he anticipates no
problem in getting the resolu
tion passed by Congress. So far
no action has been taken on the
resolution but he said the bill
should be heard in the near
future. The bill has been as
signed to the House Judiciary
Committee.
Lantos drew up the bill after
consulting with Na and the State
Department.
Na's defection has sparked
controversy in the propaganda

battle being waged by the Peo
ple's Republic of China and
Taiwan. While China has de
manded the return of Na, the
Taiwanese press has hailed her as
a "freedom fighter."
Lantos' involvement in the bill
was not meant to undercut Sin
oU.S. relations, according to
Rosman. Rather, he said the leg
islation was introduced strictly
on humanitarian grounds.
"He (Lantos) is sensitive to the
need to keep good relations
with China,"said Rosman.
Na is filing for political asylum
on the basis of "a well-founded
fear of persecution upon re
turn," he said.
