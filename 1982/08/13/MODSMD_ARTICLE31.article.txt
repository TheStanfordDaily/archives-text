'Without any effort on
your part, you and your
advisor will
automatically become
good friends. Your
advisor will call you
regularly for tennis,
dinner, a movie, or a
Caribbean cruise.'

These are the best years of your life, right?
What's more, you're spending them in Califor
nia, where the sun soothes all worries, right?
Not necessarily.
During the first year of college, freshmen en
counter all kinds of unexpected stresses."The
thing that troubles (freshmen) most is feeling
pressured by the load of work, and feeling anx
ious . . ~" said Vince D'Andrea, staff psy
chiatrist and coordinator of clinical services at
Counseling and Pyschological Services
(CAPS). "A lot of people experience real anxie
ty for the first time in their lives," he said.
The environment of a university exerts tre
mendous social and academic pressure on stu
dents. Fortunately, a wide variety of academic
and social psychological counseling exists on
campus and in the community. Counseling can

help ease the transition to a large school en
vironment.
"One way you get to know about a new com
munily is by seeking out answers." said Alice
Supton. assistant director of residential educa
tion. "On the other hand, people can feel a little
overwhelmed by all there is to get accustomed
to."
According to graduate Dayna Goldfine, a
former resident assistant who has had counsel
ing, "Sometimes you just need to talk to some
one . I wished 1 would have learned about
(counseling services) sooner."
Orientation volunteers and resident assis
tants (R A's) usually provide the first contact. In
addition to being information sources and
counselors, these people take an interest in the
University, according to Alice Supton, assistant
dean of residential education. "We pick people
who know the University well andean make ap
propriate referrals." She added, "RAs have at
their fingertips materials that will aid them in
responding to students' questions. RAs are nat
urally responsive people — sensitive and ap
proachable."
Counseling and Psychological Services
(CAPS), a part of the University health service,
provides professional personal and general
counseling help to students.
D'Andrea, one of 16 CAPS staff psy
chologists, said all students are eligible to use
the service, either on a self-referral basis or on
an RA recommendation. Each student is
eligible for 10 free visits per year to the Houston
House facility. "Most people come in very
briefly," he said.
The 1200 to 1500 students — 10 percent of the
University population — who use the service

each academic year average three to four visits.
"Usually people think of personal counseling
when they think of CAPS . . . We also do voca
tional counseling and testing."
D'Andrea cited "low utilization by
freshmen." He said. "We like to think that it's
because of the really good support services
(available) to freshmen . . . More attention is
paid in freshmen residences."
Each dorm has a CAPS representative who
works closely with residence staff. This liaison
provides the formal counseling structure within
the residences.
The Bridge, staffed completely by student
volunteers, is probably the most well-known
peer counseling organization on campus.
Grad student Amy Mar, one of four students
who live in the Bridge, said the facility's work
shops generally deal with mental health or self
growth, ranging from self-hypnosis to massage
to parapsychology.
The Bridge is open five days a week from
noon until 10 p.m. Bridge live-in staffers are on
call all night. The service is free to all students.
The Bridge occasionally receives an ASSU fee
assessment, but most funds are from the annual
spring crafts faire. Senior Michele Shockey, a
live-in at the Bridge, said this fund-raiser gener
ates about $10,000.
Many outside groups from yoga classes to ac
ademic advising forums use the Bridge's facil
ities.
The Gay Counseling Center also operates out
of the Bridge. As a result, said Shockey, "a lot
of people think we're the GPL (Gay People's
Union)."
According to Bruce Campbell, head of the
Gay Counseling Group, the organization of
about 15 staff members runs the gay speakers'
bureau. Gay counselors are available from 4 to
7 p.m. weekdays at the Bridge.
Campbell said the Gay and Lesbian Alliance
at Stanford (GLAS), formerly the GPU, "more
social and political."
Residences provide the academic advising
structure — from choosing courses to going ov
erseas.
Advising associates, who work with Resident
Fellows (RFs) and RAs, are coordinated
through the Academic Information Center
(AIC) and Res Hd.
But academic advisors are not miracle work
ers.
A recent Res Ed poster citing nine frosh facts
for fall warns incoming students of many myths
and facts about advising. M\ths include: "Ad
visors have computer-like brains which store
and regularly update all information in Courses
and Degrees, Course Abstracts, The ASSU
Course Guide, and the Time Scheduleand
"Without any effort at all on your part, you and
vour advisor will automatically become best

friends. Your advisor will call you regularly for
tennis, dinner, a movie, or a Caribbean cruise."
Career Planning and Placement Center
(CPPC) Counselors, trained in a class last
spring, will provide resume assistance, help
with interview techniques, and give tours of the
career library. They will also advise on how to
find an appropriate career.
"The students really appreciate being able to
come in and talk to another stud'.-nf." s:iid
Kathy Campbell, assistant director of liberal
arts placement. Sessions, arranged around indi
vidual student schedules, generally run 30 to 45
minutes.
For specific academic counseling and in
formation. the Academic Information Center
(AIC) and the Learning Assistance Center
(LAC) are available.
The LAC gives a study skills course for credit
fall quarter. Supton stressed, "You don't have
to have been in some trouble to take that
course."
Peer counseling and tutoring are also avail
able through the LAC.
The AIC, located in the Old Union, offers on
call advisors and pre-professional advising.
Other academic help centers include the term
paper advisory service in Meyer and the English
department tutorial center.
Cowell Health Center offers confidential con
traceptive peer counseling weekdays from noon
to 5 p.m. It often acts as a referral service for
abortion counseling, prenatal care, and price
information.
Peer counselors must take a two-part class in
cluding both medical and peer counseling.
According to senior Sheila Scoba, a two
quarter counselor, contraceptive counselors are

particularly useful in an informal capacity, such
as in their dorms. "In some ways this is even
more effective than the office hours," she said.
Students may also make an appointment
with the Cowell gynecologist or nurse practi
tioner.
Planned Parenthood offers an alternative
pregnancy and counseling service. The service
— except for abortions — is free, but Planned
Parenthood asks for donations.
The national federation, present throughout
the United States, provides pregnancy testing
and counseling from 9:30 a.m. to 5 p.m. daily.
Appointments are preferable but not re
quired. Clinics are held Monday and Thursday
from 2 p.m. to 6:45 p.m.
Rosetta Crockett, head of the Planned Pa
renthood branch in Menlo Park, said, "They
can just come over and visit, too. People don't
have to be coming in for contraceptives."
Palo Alto is the headquarters of the Venereal
Disease (VD) National Hotline, operated by the
American Social Health Association. VD is an
often asymtomatic disease which can afflict
anyone sexually active with an infected partner.
Students here volunteer at the center and may
apply for credit through SCIRE.
Callers are usually referred to one of 2000
crisis intervention centers or to one of 5000
clinics throughout the United States.
In the end. the decision to seek counseling is
voluntary. "The formal personal and
pscyhological counseling is really up to the stu
dent," said Supton. "What we try to do through
the residence staff is to remove any barriers stu
dents have to seeking help. There are going to
be some rough times. We want students to
know that help is available."

'Without any effort on

These are the best years of your life, right?
What's more, you're spending them in Califor
nia, where the sun soothes all worries, right?
Not necessarily.
During the first year of college, freshmen en
counter all kinds of unexpected stresses."The
thing that troubles (freshmen) most is feeling
pressured by the load of work, and feeling anx
ious . . ~" said Vince D'Andrea, staff psy
chiatrist and coordinator of clinical services at
Counseling and Pyschological Services
(CAPS). "A lot of people experience real anxie
ty for the first time in their lives," he said.
The environment of a university exerts tre
mendous social and academic pressure on stu
dents. Fortunately, a wide variety of academic
and social psychological counseling exists on
campus and in the community. Counseling can

help ease the transition to a large school en
vironment.
"One way you get to know about a new com
munily is by seeking out answers." said Alice
Supton. assistant director of residential educa
tion. "On the other hand, people can feel a little
overwhelmed by all there is to get accustomed
to."
According to graduate Dayna Goldfine, a
former resident assistant who has had counsel
ing, "Sometimes you just need to talk to some
one . I wished 1 would have learned about
(counseling services) sooner."
Orientation volunteers and resident assis
tants (R A's) usually provide the first contact. In
addition to being information sources and
counselors, these people take an interest in the
University, according to Alice Supton, assistant
dean of residential education. "We pick people
who know the University well andean make ap
propriate referrals." She added, "RAs have at
their fingertips materials that will aid them in
responding to students' questions. RAs are nat
urally responsive people — sensitive and ap
proachable."
Counseling and Psychological Services
(CAPS), a part of the University health service,
provides professional personal and general
counseling help to students.
D'Andrea, one of 16 CAPS staff psy
chologists, said all students are eligible to use
the service, either on a self-referral basis or on
an RA recommendation. Each student is
eligible for 10 free visits per year to the Houston
House facility. "Most people come in very
briefly," he said.
The 1200 to 1500 students — 10 percent of the
University population — who use the service

each academic year average three to four visits.
"Usually people think of personal counseling
when they think of CAPS . . . We also do voca
tional counseling and testing."
D'Andrea cited "low utilization by
freshmen." He said. "We like to think that it's
because of the really good support services
(available) to freshmen . . . More attention is
paid in freshmen residences."
Each dorm has a CAPS representative who
works closely with residence staff. This liaison
provides the formal counseling structure within
the residences.
The Bridge, staffed completely by student
volunteers, is probably the most well-known
peer counseling organization on campus.
Grad student Amy Mar, one of four students
who live in the Bridge, said the facility's work
shops generally deal with mental health or self
growth, ranging from self-hypnosis to massage
to parapsychology.
The Bridge is open five days a week from
noon until 10 p.m. Bridge live-in staffers are on
call all night. The service is free to all students.
The Bridge occasionally receives an ASSU fee
assessment, but most funds are from the annual
spring crafts faire. Senior Michele Shockey, a
live-in at the Bridge, said this fund-raiser gener
ates about $10,000.
Many outside groups from yoga classes to ac
ademic advising forums use the Bridge's facil
ities.
The Gay Counseling Center also operates out
of the Bridge. As a result, said Shockey, "a lot
of people think we're the GPL (Gay People's
Union)."
According to Bruce Campbell, head of the
Gay Counseling Group, the organization of
about 15 staff members runs the gay speakers'
bureau. Gay counselors are available from 4 to
7 p.m. weekdays at the Bridge.
Campbell said the Gay and Lesbian Alliance
at Stanford (GLAS), formerly the GPU, "more
social and political."
Residences provide the academic advising
structure — from choosing courses to going ov
erseas.
Advising associates, who work with Resident
Fellows (RFs) and RAs, are coordinated
through the Academic Information Center
(AIC) and Res Hd.
But academic advisors are not miracle work
ers.
A recent Res Ed poster citing nine frosh facts
for fall warns incoming students of many myths
and facts about advising. M\ths include: "Ad
visors have computer-like brains which store
and regularly update all information in Courses
and Degrees, Course Abstracts, The ASSU
Course Guide, and the Time Scheduleand
"Without any effort at all on your part, you and
vour advisor will automatically become best

friends. Your advisor will call you regularly for
tennis, dinner, a movie, or a Caribbean cruise."
Career Planning and Placement Center
(CPPC) Counselors, trained in a class last
spring, will provide resume assistance, help
with interview techniques, and give tours of the
career library. They will also advise on how to
find an appropriate career.
"The students really appreciate being able to
come in and talk to another stud'.-nf." s:iid
Kathy Campbell, assistant director of liberal
arts placement. Sessions, arranged around indi
vidual student schedules, generally run 30 to 45
minutes.
For specific academic counseling and in
formation. the Academic Information Center
(AIC) and the Learning Assistance Center
(LAC) are available.
The LAC gives a study skills course for credit
fall quarter. Supton stressed, "You don't have
to have been in some trouble to take that
course."
Peer counseling and tutoring are also avail
able through the LAC.
The AIC, located in the Old Union, offers on
call advisors and pre-professional advising.
Other academic help centers include the term
paper advisory service in Meyer and the English
department tutorial center.
Cowell Health Center offers confidential con
traceptive peer counseling weekdays from noon
to 5 p.m. It often acts as a referral service for
abortion counseling, prenatal care, and price
information.
Peer counselors must take a two-part class in
cluding both medical and peer counseling.
According to senior Sheila Scoba, a two
quarter counselor, contraceptive counselors are

particularly useful in an informal capacity, such
as in their dorms. "In some ways this is even
more effective than the office hours," she said.
Students may also make an appointment
with the Cowell gynecologist or nurse practi
tioner.
