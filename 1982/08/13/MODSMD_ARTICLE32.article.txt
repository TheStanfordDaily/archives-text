## A 						midnight kiss in the Quad — campus tradition flourishes 
### 
Puzzling over that row of
bronze numbered plaques in
front of Memorial Church?
Those plaques, set in the tiles of
the Quad since 1892, conceal
one of the few remaining Stan
ford traditions.
Each graduating class over the
years has interred a time capsule
containing the memorabilia of its
short era at Stanford —

everything from armbands to the
Saturday Night Fever sound
track, from Lacoste shirts to
punk rock paraphernalia. The
capsules are to be opened, one
per year, starting with the Uni
versity's centennial in 1992.
But other Stanford traditions
have not stood the test of time so
well and like many collegiate
whims have gone the way of

panty raids and streaking.
Some conventions out of the
Stanford archives that freshmen
need not learn, but may enjoy
reading, include:
• Only seniors may wear cor
duroy pants.
• No smoking in the Ouad.
• No women on the steps of the
I,aw building (which is now the
Political Science Dept.)

• No corsages at Stanford dances
except the Senior Ball.
• Ride-sharing seekers congre
gate under the big oak tree by
the History Corner.
• Only skirts may be worn by
women travelling beyond the
Post Office toward the Ouad.
• Candy or flowers are a must for
women subjected to the indig
nity of being locked out after

dormitory closing hours.
• No men allowed in women's
dorms except in social rooms.
• No women allowed alone in
men's dorms, fraternities or off
campus.
• And last but not least, the trad
itional Big Game bonfire has
been forever extinguished.
The demise of many of these
traditions came with woman's

liberation and the sexual revolu
tion of the '60s. Others just
faded into a past that held such
scriptures more dearly.
Some new traditions such as
following the Band to the City
the night before Big Game,
Jack's runs and the great paper
airplane show during the Sunday
Flicks have risen to take the old
formalities' place.

However, freshmen women
must still he on their guard for
one tradition which is still going
strong. As legend has it. in fact,
one cannot truly he called a Stan
ford woman until one has been
kissed in the middle of the Quad
at midnight during a full moon In
a senior man. Firing a bottle ol
champagne and do it up right
you'll be in good company.
