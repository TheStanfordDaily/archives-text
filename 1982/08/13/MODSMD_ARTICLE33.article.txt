## Campus hosts political rallies, demonstrations, debates

'Stanford is less
tolerant of politically
useless activities. Here
the people try to fit
activism into the space
of free time left
available for students.'

Crass-bay rival UC-Berkeley's reputation for
political activism, which became identified with
activism in the turbulent era of student protests
of the '60s and early '70s. often overshadows
Stanford's political actions. But the University
has an extensive history of demonstrations, sit
ins and mass marches.
Thousands of students and faculty partici
pated in the April 3 movement of 1969 which
formed to protest the classified research being
undertaken at the University and at the then
Stanford Research Institute (SRI). Eventually
pressure from students and faculty members re
sulted in the Board of Trustee's severing ties
with the Stanford Research Institute which,
barred from using the Stanford name, is known
today only by the acronym SRI. Since the
Trustee decision, no classified research is con
ducted on campus.
The following year the issue of permitting
students to obtain credit for ROTC sparked
two weeks of protests, which escalated into vi
olent riots, causing at least 515.000 worth of
damage, as well as injuries to several students
and police.
As a response to the expansion of the United
States war in South East Asia into Cambodia in
1970 more than 8000 students and faculty at
tended a mass rally in Frost Amphitheatre to
discuss the events.
A student strike implemented after the Cam
bodian expansion was honored by almost two
thirds of the student population. As a result of
the strike here and at other Universities across
the country the campus was closed for several
days.
Since these violent eruptions of the past, po
litical activism at Stanford has taken on a much
milder form than the violent eruptions of the
past. Activism here reflects a larger national
trend toward conservatism on college cam
puses. Fewer students involve themselves politi
cally today than did 12 years ago and often
those who are active do not maintain the same
level of intensity as past student leaders due to a
desire to balance political activism with aca
demic pursuits.
The highest level of activism took place last
year when around 500 students protested Presi
dent Ronald Reagan's defense policies the day
that Defense Secretary Caspar Weinberger
spoke on campus. Protest marches and rallies
were held before, during and after Weinberger's
speech.
Earlier in the year an overflow crowed
jammed into kresge Auditorium to hear a de
bate on the Equal Rights Amendment (ERA)
between noted ERA opponent Phyliss Schla
fly and feminist and ERA supporter Catherine
MacKinnon.

Student participation reached a peak during
a v\eek-long group of activities called "Dis
orientation Week" last Spring Quarter when on
a Friday night John Kenneth Galbraith drew an
overflow crowd of 1700 in Memorial
Auditorium at the same time a capacity crowd
of 600 was attending a panel discussion on
pornography in Kresge Auditorium featuring
former pornography star of Deep Throat fame
Linda Lovelace.
The rest of the week's activities, which were
also well-attended, included rallies and other
speakers such as Consumer Advocate Ralph
Nader. American Indian Movement leader
Dennis Banks and Democratic Socialist
Michael Harrington.
The week was put together by a coalition of
groups called the Stanford Progressive Alliance
(SPA), which is planning on putting together

one or two Disorientation Weeks this year ac
cording to last year's Co-Coordinator Jim
Steyer.
Steyer said the most important benefit stu
dents derived from the week was the ability to
organize. "Something much more important
than learning about the issue is students learn
ing how to organize . . . that's what they take
away from it."he said.
Another well-attended event sponsored by
SPA was Hoovervilleßeaganville 82'. Students
constructed a model of the depression -era
shanty towns named after Hoover in an empty
field across from the Hoover Tower in an at
tempt to relate Reagan's policies to those
pursued by Hoover.
Steyer felt that last year students were more
politically involved than they had been in the
past two vears, although activism was still far

below the levels of the late '60s and early '70s.
The reason for the greater student involve
ment hist year' According to Steyer, it's Rea
gan.
"Ronald Reagan is great for political ac
tivism. He takes so many objectionable stances
that it raises everyones consciousness. He's
probably the greatest thing that happened to
student politics," Steyer said.
Steyer predicted a greater level of student in
volvement this year in SPA because of the ex
perience gained last year and the success of last
year's events.
"Students have an incredible power to in
fluence politics but I don't think they perceive
that," he said.
Not all political activism here comes from
liberal or left leaning groups. The Stanford Col

lege Republicans last year sponsored a number
of activities including a speech by 12th District
Republican Congressional Candidate Fd
Zschau. Lisa Barron headed the group last year.
With the public becoming more concerned
with nuclear arms issues the awareness and the
activities of students has also increased. Mere,
students interested in these issues have formed
the Stanford Arms Control and Disarmament
Forum (SACDF).
SACDF planned some of its activities over
the summer according to Co-Coordinator Eric
Horvitz. The organization, which is devoted to
informing the Stanford community about the
effects and dangers of the accelerated nuclear
arms race, is co-sponsoring a day of activities to
educate students on nuclear issues on October
23.
"In general the country really woke up to the
issue (nuclear arms control) this year. I don't
think Stanford's increased awareness of the nu
clear issue matched the increased awareness in
the country," Horvitz said. In comparing ac
tivism here with that at Cal, which Horvitz at
tended as an undergraduate, he said that here
there is a stronger sense of political realism.
"Stanford is less tolerant of politically useless
activities. Here people try to fit activism into the
space of free time left available for stu
dents,"Horvitz said.
Last year, SACDF sponsored "Weapons
Crisis Week" to focus attention on the causes
and effects of the nuclear arms race as well as
the consequences of nuclear war.
Other projects in the works for SACDF are a
film series that attempts to look into the root
causes of the arms race and the creation of a
parliament to draft a paper outlining Stanford's
view on disarmament.
Another area that has drawn the attention of
the nation and students here is Central Ameri
ca, where revolution, terrorism and repression
in its various forms have been cited by various
groups.
Here the Stanford Central American Action
Network (SCAAN) has been formed to prevent
escalation of U.S. military intervention in Cen
tral America and to promote solidarity with
people of the region.
According to SCAAN spokesman Brad
Barham, last year the group devoted much of its
efforts towards raising money for refugees from
El Salvador and successfully lobbying Repre
sentative Tom Lantos (D-San Mateo) to op
pose further aid to El Salvador under the cur
rent human rights situation.
This year the group plans to teach a SWOPSI
class on Central America, as well as sponsoring
speakers, forums and Films, said Barham.
Two non-partisan groups — the Stanford
Committee on Political Education (SCOPE)
and the ASSU Speaker's Bureau — last year
brought a number of well-known politicians to
campus. Both organizations plan to continue to
sponsor political speakers this year.
Among the other groups that maintained a
high profile on campus last year were Stanford
for Environmental Education (SEE) and Stan
ford Against Conscription (SAC). Last year
SEE sponsored a week of discussion and fo
rums that focused on the Clean Air Act.
While The Farm does not offer anything
comparable to Berkeley's Sproul Plaza —
where proponents of everything from the nucle
ar freeze to sailing lessons hawk to passers-by
— students should be able to find political
groups here that match their own interest or
ideology.


(Clockwise from top left) Although it's true that Stanford student activism can't hold a
candle to the legendary campus confrontations of the '60s, Defense Secretary Caspar
Weinberger's speech at Kresge Auditorium last March drew a large crowd of evening
protesters. Other major political events last year included the noon hour "silent vigil"
for El Salvador, held in White Plaza in February, and the J anuary debate between

Catherine MacKinnon and Phyllis Schlafly,
sponsored by Stanford College Republicans.
Throughout the year, the issue of nuclear
disarmament loomed ominously overhead.

the nation and students here is Central Ameri
ca, where revolution, terrorism and repression
in its various forms have been cited by various
groups.
Here the Stanford Central American Action
Network (SCAAN) has been formed to prevent
escalation of U.S. military intervention in Cen
tral America and to promote solidarity with
people of the region.
According to SCAAN spokesman Brad
Barham, last year the group devoted much of its
efforts towards raising money for refugees from
El Salvador and successfully lobbying Repre
sentative Tom Lantos (D-San Mateo) to op
pose further aid to El Salvador under the cur
rent human rights situation.
This year the group plans to teach a SWOPSI
class on Central America, as well as sponsoring
speakers, forums and Films, said Barham.
Two non-partisan groups — the Stanford
Committee on Political Education (SCOPE)
and the ASSU Speaker's Bureau — last year
brought a number of well-known politicians to
campus. Both organizations plan to continue to
sponsor political speakers this year.
Among the other groups that maintained a
high profile on campus last year were Stanford
for Environmental Education (SEE) and Stan
ford Against Conscription (SAC). Last year
SEE sponsored a week of discussion and fo
rums that focused on the Clean Air Act.
While The Farm does not offer anything
comparable to Berkeley's Sproul Plaza —
where proponents of everything from the nucle
ar freeze to sailing lessons hawk to passers-by
— students should be able to find political
groups here that match their own interest or
ideology.


(Clockwise from top left) Although it's true that Stanford student activism can't hold a
candle to the legendary campus confrontations of the '60s, Defense Secretary Caspar
Weinberger's speech at Kresge Auditorium last March drew a large crowd of evening
protesters. Other major political events last year included the noon hour "silent vigil"
for El Salvador, held in White Plaza in February, and the J anuary debate between

Catherine MacKinnon and Phyllis Schlafly,
sponsored by Stanford College Republicans.
Throughout the year, the issue of nuclear
disarmament loomed ominously overhead.
'Stanford is less
tolerant of politically
useless activities. Here
the people try to fit
activism into the space
of free time left
available for students.'

Crass-bay rival UC-Berkeley's reputation for
political activism, which became identified with
activism in the turbulent era of student protests
of the '60s and early '70s. often overshadows
Stanford's political actions. But the University
has an extensive history of demonstrations, sit
ins and mass marches.
Thousands of students and faculty partici
pated in the April 3 movement of 1969 which
formed to protest the classified research being
undertaken at the University and at the then
Stanford Research Institute (SRI). Eventually
pressure from students and faculty members re
sulted in the Board of Trustee's severing ties
with the Stanford Research Institute which,
barred from using the Stanford name, is known
today only by the acronym SRI. Since the
Trustee decision, no classified research is con
ducted on campus.
The following year the issue of permitting
students to obtain credit for ROTC sparked
two weeks of protests, which escalated into vi
olent riots, causing at least 515.000 worth of
damage, as well as injuries to several students
and police.
As a response to the expansion of the United
States war in South East Asia into Cambodia in
1970 more than 8000 students and faculty at
tended a mass rally in Frost Amphitheatre to
discuss the events.
A student strike implemented after the Cam
bodian expansion was honored by almost two
thirds of the student population. As a result of
the strike here and at other Universities across
the country the campus was closed for several
days.
Since these violent eruptions of the past, po
litical activism at Stanford has taken on a much
milder form than the violent eruptions of the
past. Activism here reflects a larger national
trend toward conservatism on college cam
puses. Fewer students involve themselves politi
cally today than did 12 years ago and often
those who are active do not maintain the same
level of intensity as past student leaders due to a
desire to balance political activism with aca
demic pursuits.
The highest level of activism took place last
year when around 500 students protested Presi
dent Ronald Reagan's defense policies the day
that Defense Secretary Caspar Weinberger
spoke on campus. Protest marches and rallies
were held before, during and after Weinberger's
speech.
Earlier in the year an overflow crowed
jammed into kresge Auditorium to hear a de
bate on the Equal Rights Amendment (ERA)
between noted ERA opponent Phyliss Schla
fly and feminist and ERA supporter Catherine
MacKinnon.

Student participation reached a peak during
a v\eek-long group of activities called "Dis
orientation Week" last Spring Quarter when on
a Friday night John Kenneth Galbraith drew an
overflow crowd of 1700 in Memorial
Auditorium at the same time a capacity crowd
of 600 was attending a panel discussion on
pornography in Kresge Auditorium featuring
former pornography star of Deep Throat fame
Linda Lovelace.
The rest of the week's activities, which were
also well-attended, included rallies and other
speakers such as Consumer Advocate Ralph
Nader. American Indian Movement leader
Dennis Banks and Democratic Socialist
Michael Harrington.
The week was put together by a coalition of
groups called the Stanford Progressive Alliance
(SPA), which is planning on putting together

one or two Disorientation Weeks this year ac
cording to last year's Co-Coordinator Jim
Steyer.
Steyer said the most important benefit stu
dents derived from the week was the ability to
organize. "Something much more important
than learning about the issue is students learn
ing how to organize . . . that's what they take
away from it."he said.
Another well-attended event sponsored by
SPA was Hoovervilleßeaganville 82'. Students
constructed a model of the depression -era
shanty towns named after Hoover in an empty
field across from the Hoover Tower in an at
tempt to relate Reagan's policies to those
pursued by Hoover.
Steyer felt that last year students were more
politically involved than they had been in the
past two vears, although activism was still far

below the levels of the late '60s and early '70s.
The reason for the greater student involve
ment hist year' According to Steyer, it's Rea
gan.
"Ronald Reagan is great for political ac
tivism. He takes so many objectionable stances
that it raises everyones consciousness. He's
probably the greatest thing that happened to
student politics," Steyer said.
Steyer predicted a greater level of student in
volvement this year in SPA because of the ex
perience gained last year and the success of last
year's events.
"Students have an incredible power to in
fluence politics but I don't think they perceive
that," he said.
Not all political activism here comes from
liberal or left leaning groups. The Stanford Col

lege Republicans last year sponsored a number
of activities including a speech by 12th District
Republican Congressional Candidate Fd
Zschau. Lisa Barron headed the group last year.
With the public becoming more concerned
with nuclear arms issues the awareness and the
activities of students has also increased. Mere,
students interested in these issues have formed
the Stanford Arms Control and Disarmament
Forum (SACDF).
SACDF planned some of its activities over
the summer according to Co-Coordinator Eric
Horvitz. The organization, which is devoted to
informing the Stanford community about the
effects and dangers of the accelerated nuclear
arms race, is co-sponsoring a day of activities to
educate students on nuclear issues on October
23.
"In general the country really woke up to the
issue (nuclear arms control) this year. I don't
think Stanford's increased awareness of the nu
clear issue matched the increased awareness in
the country," Horvitz said. In comparing ac
tivism here with that at Cal, which Horvitz at
tended as an undergraduate, he said that here
there is a stronger sense of political realism.
"Stanford is less tolerant of politically useless
activities. Here people try to fit activism into the
space of free time left available for stu
dents,"Horvitz said.
Last year, SACDF sponsored "Weapons
Crisis Week" to focus attention on the causes
and effects of the nuclear arms race as well as
the consequences of nuclear war.
Other projects in the works for SACDF are a
film series that attempts to look into the root
causes of the arms race and the creation of a
parliament to draft a paper outlining Stanford's
view on disarmament.
Another area that has drawn the attention of
