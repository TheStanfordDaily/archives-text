'Finding the ultimate
structure... at this
stage, it's almost at a
mind-blowing state.'

As one of the foremost educational institu
tions in the United States, Stanford University
* has occupied a position of importance in many
areas of research throughout the world. If the
federally funded Stanford Linear Accelerator
Center is included, Stanford is one of, if not the
largest, research institutions in the country.
With the incorporation of a number of facil
v ities surrounding the central campus, the Uni
versity has received significant financial sup
port from several federal agencies, in addition
i to private sponsorships and donations. Though
due to government cuts in educational support
the University will no longer he able to expand
their research facilites at the previous rate pos
|j sible under earlier administratons, Vice Provost
; and Dean of Graduate Studies and Research
Gerald Lieberman is optimistic about the
future of research at Stanford.
During the 1980-81 academic year, the total
5 volume of research for the University was esti
mated to be 130 million dollars, according to
Lieberman, Finances of9o nercent of this figure
came from the federal government, with 5 per
cent coming from private industry and founda
tions and non-profit organizations respectively.
"We, like every other major research univer
sity, are very dependent upon the whims of the
federal government." emphasized Lieberman.
The National Institute of Health is the pre
dominant agency for financial support for the
University, and substantial funding is also pro
vided by the National' Science Foundation and
the Department of Defense.
Changes in federal sponsorships have had a
"significant effect" on research projects in
itiated by the University, and a possible de
crease in funds in the range of 2 to A million
dollars is predicted in the near future.
However, Lieberman emphasized, "Stanford
does not do classified research. It is something
about which we feel very strongly. We don't
think secrecy is good because we feel it inhibits
the research atmosphere."
Despite possible cuts in federal support,
Lieberman does not see the University turning
to industry for additional finances to eliminate
any defecits due to lack of government funding.
"The way things look with the economy and
with Congress right now, the best we can do is

to remain static. But I think we will be doing
very well." Lieberman said he doesn't foresee
industry relieving the government of the finan
cial burden of research and development.
"They (industry) will always remain small. In
dustrial support is not the answer, but they do
finance areas which government is not in
terested in. It (industrial support) evens out the
peaks and valleys which frequently occur with
federal financing."
Despite the vagaries of research funding, in
vestigation here goes on at a frenetic rate, with
new many new discoveries coming to light each
week. An outline, by no means comprehensive,
of some of ihe most notable research centers on
campus follows.
The Hoover Institution
Many of President Ronald Reagan's inner
sanctum — Phillip Habib, Martin Anderson,
Seymour Martin Lipset, even Reagan himself
— hold chairs, or have been associated with the
Hoover Institution on War, Revolution and
Peace. Those who teach are constantly cancell
ing lectures to fly off to meetings in Washing
ton. With the coming of the New Conservatism
and the New Federalism, the Hoover Institu
tion has become one of the most influential
think tanks in the country.
"The highlight of the past year was the elec
tion of honorary fellow Ronald Reagan as Pres
ident of the United States." Hoover Institution
Director Glenn Campbell wrote in his Direc
tor's Review. "This development, together with
the Institution's national and international rep
utation as a unique center for advanced study,
has continued to focus attention on the work of
the Institution's scholars and on its library and
archival collections. During the 1980-81 aca
demic year, the research and publication ac
tivites of the Institution's scholars, concerning
both current and historical issues of domestic
and foreign affairs, continued to address a wide
and diversified audience throughout the United
States and abroad."
The Hoover Institution's resident staff con
sists of roughly 140 scholars, librarians and re
search assistants, who speak an estimated 41
languages. Three Nobel Laureates are also
presently affiliated with the institution.
Stanford Linear Accelerator (SLAC)
SLAC is a facility devoted principally to the
works of pure science — basic, not applied, re
search. However, there are various practical ap
plications from the discoveries made in the lab
oratories and accelerators.
At the moment several members of SLAC
and similar international and domestic agen
cies, including CF.RN, a laboratory near Gene
va. Switzerland, maintain close contact with
one another, have communicated many of their
respective findings. "High energy physics is an
international operation." said Prof. Burton
Richter. winner of the 1976 Nobel Prize in phys
ics.

Richter termed the goal of much of the work
done at SLAC as "finding the ultimate struc
ture ... at this stage, it's almost in a mind-blow
ing state."
"The main work on research is in elementary
particle physics," stated Richter. . . studying
atoms under various conditions-finding the
fundamental constituents of nature."
SI.AC came to the University campus in
1961, when a contract was signed bet wen the
Atomic Energy Commission and the Univer
sity Built on a 480-acre section of land in the
foothills behind campus, construction was
completed in 1966, on schedule, and within the
allocated budget of SI 14 million. Since that
time SI AC has expanded its facilities to include
some of the most technologically advanced
methods of electron acceleration and collision.
This process of electron splitting is ac
complished by accelerating the electrons down
a narrow tube at speeds only a small fraction of
a second from the speed of light. These elec
tron> crash into the nuclei of stationary target
material in two large end-station buildings, and
the scattering of subnuclear particles are cap
lured by optical and electronic detectors.
The splitting of the atom and the electron has
a predominant area of research at SLAC, and
the reverberations from a few of these dis
coveries have warranted the awarding of their
faculty the Nobel Prize in their respective fields.
Richter was awarded the Nobel Pri/.e in physics
in 1976 for his discovery of the particle "psi,"
which was found to make up what was pre
viously considered to be the smallest units of
matter, the electron.
The initial accelerator has been joined by two
more recent contemporaries, SPEAR (Stanford
Positron Electron Asymmetric Ring) and PEP
(Positron Electron Project), and there is soon to
be a third; SLC(SLAC Linear Collider).
"The SI.C is a new kind of accelerator."
stated Richter. "We are constructing it for two
reasons. One reason is that the old kinds are get
ling too expensive. You can't just continue to
make old accelerators bigger and bigger be
cause costs get out of hand. Secondly, the chase
for higher energy is trying to find out what's
happening at high energy...The seeds in the
plum pudding, if you will."
Medical Research
The research involving the transplation of the
human heart has been a predominant, and
much publicized, area of investigation by the
Stanford University Medical Center for ap
proximately the past 20 years, according to Dr.
Stuart Jamieson, presently head of the heart
and lung transplant unit at the University Med
ical Center
V igures estimate that close to half of the
world's cardiac transplant operations have
taken place at Stanford, and adds Jamieson,
"l ver\ aspect has been preceded by thorough
laboratorv research."

The first adult human heart transplant in the
United States took place on January 6, 1968.
under the direction of Medical Center surgeon
Dr. Norman Shumway. (The first heart trans
plant operation in the world took place in South
Africa a few weeks earlier, using a number of
the surgical methods developed by Dr.
Shumway during his laboratory research.)
Approximately ten years of laboratory ex
perimentation and research preceded
Shuniway's operation. Methods for such an op
eration became standardized, and since then
close <o 250 heart transplants have taken place
at Stanford, and the survival rate has steadily
increased. In 1968 the one year post surgical life
expectancy was 20 percent, 80 percent of the
transplant patients now live at least one year.
"It is the highest in the world.said
Jamieson. "This is the result of continuing me
thodical research directly linked to clinical ac
tivitv. The clinical program has benefited im
mensely from that."
Hopkins Marine Station
Hopkins Marine Station, the Stanford's pri-

Mary facility for biological research in the
marine enviroment, is located in the Pacific
Grove on the Monterey Peninsula, some 90
miles south of the University campus.
The University holds title to approximately
11 acres on and around the point, which encom
passes close to one miles of shoreline. The habi
tats represented with the immediate vicinity of
the Marine Station include granite reefs and
outcroppings. in addition to tidepools, chan
nels. beaches and offshore kelp beds. The in
tertidal and offshore waters surrounding the
Marine Station are protected by law as a marine
reserve, and provide extensive resources for re
search and education.
The research and teaching at the Marine Sta
tion cover a wide spectrum of subjects. Some
projects focus on problems in marine biology,
while others are involved with issues such as
cellular and developmental biology, im
munology. neurobiology, comparative physi
ology, behavior, population biology and
ecology.

Scientists work at the two mile-long Stanford Linear Accelerator — an atom smasher. Electrons
approach the speed of light when these physicists shoot them down the accelerator's narrow tube
. . . smashing the electrons into the nuclei of stationary target material at the end of the accelerator.
The scattering of sub-nuclear particles that results is monitored by optical and magnetic instru
ments.
