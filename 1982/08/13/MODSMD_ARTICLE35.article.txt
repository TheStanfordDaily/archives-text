Stanford graduate students are a diverse lot.
The diversity can be attributed to the sheer number of grad
students — 55(H) — who are each enrolled in one of seven schools:
Business, Earth Sciences. Education. Engineering. Humanities
and Sciences. Law and Medicine.

Phc essence of graduate work is studying, a routine which
leaves time for little else. But there are common denominators
between the thousands of graduates: many worr\ about the lack
of available on-campus housing and spiral ing off-campus costs,
tuition costs are depressing and dwindling research funds
plague most departments.

Grad students can be characterized by three traits, said
Jean Fetter, associate dean of the graduate division: talent,
diversity and multi-faceted roles. (Stanford's graduate
administration is comprised of one dean, four associate
deans and five assistant deans.)
The "talent" aspect is self-evident, she said and "di
versitx" is attributed to the number of students from all

over the world.
It is the "multi-faceted" role which is the most
complex. Fetter said. "Graduates are students,
teachers, researchers, often parents and a lot of them
work." she said. "The graduate phase of your life is
complex because you have so many roles to play.
No other element of Stanford has that number of

facets."
This may coincide with an announcement re
cently made b\ Cowell Health Center. The
majority of patients using the Counseling and
Psychological Services at Cowell are grad stu
dents. Dr. David Dorosin, director of those

services, said.
"It is the graduates who have the greatest
pressures and problems," said Dr. Doro
sin. "Very often these people have worked
extremely hard in order to get into their
highly-rated professional school and
now that they have succeeded it seems
less important to be there," he said.
"They find themselves doubting
L whether this was the right choice for

them."
Another denominator is a grad's
teelings about the Stanford com
munity. Some grads love the re
laxed aura generated by the
people and environment which

constitute the Stanford com
munity, while others berate the
community for its lack of so
cial and political awareness.
But the major common

denominator among grads
seems to be that few are
able to make the attempt
to get to know grads in
other schools, let alone
Stanford's 6590 under
grads. Many grads
I meet undergrads while
serving as teacher's as

sistants, but Gail Perez,
a Ph.D. English candi
date, said. "We don't
socialize with the un
dergraduates because,
as teachers, it seems in
appropriate."'
The lack of graduate
communication bet
ween the various
schools is something
Stanford's administra
tion says it is accutely
aware of and is trying to
overcome. It's some
thing grads think ab
out, maybe worry
about and regret, but
it's something which is
not high on their list of
priorities. The priority
is Stanford University
in the academic sense.
"The general
philosophy of graduate
education is that it is a
salient part of this in-

stitution's educational prog
ram," said Albert Hastorf. vicc
president and provost. He said
Stanford strives to balance
graduate and undergraduate
education so that the two com
plement one another.
Nonetheless, Hastorf also said
Stanford "looks at graduate stu
dents as organized and operated
by departments" and that most
grads have little opportunity for
taking courses outside of their
departments.
Another key to understanding
graduate students is separating
the masters candidates—"pro
fessionals," as Hastorf calls them
— from the doctorate candi
dates. The professional prog
rams are found in law, business,
medicine, engineering and
communications. But most ad
vanced degree programs incor
porate the masters program into
the doctorate programs because
the University has relatively few
masters programs in its seven
schools. (The number of "pro
fessional" students, though, far
outweighs the number of docto
rate candidates.)
This separation of graduate
from graduate and graduate
from undergraduate begins with
the admissions process. All un
dergrads are admitted through
the dean of admissions' office
while grads apply to and are ad
mitted by one department. All
students, however, receive a de
gree from Stanford University.
At East Coast schools such as
Harvard and Princeton, the
grads and undergrads are enrol
led in separate colleges in those
institutions. Hastorf said the dif
ference between Stanford and
Harvard and Princeton is in
name only. The admissions pro
cess is identical, he said.
It's not only the admissions
process which is identical to East
Coast Schools,; the quality of
education is as superb, and in

many eases, better. In a 1978
study published In the American
Council 011 Education, "Rating
nt Graduate Programs," the
quality ot Stanford's faculty was
ranked among the top five na
tionally in fields, a total ex
ceeded only by Berkeley and
Harv aid.
While many grads said they
came to Stanford because it's a
beautiful campus and because
they wanted to live in California,
the bottom line is Stanford's
reputation. "It's a ri;:me that
rings the bell," Perex said.
It's a bell Terry O'Toole opted
for.
O' Toole was accepted by Har
vard Law School and received a
two-year deferred admission be
cause he wanted to work before
beginning graduate studies — a
trait common to a growing
number of graduate students and
desired by businesses. O'Toole,
23. graduated as an economics
major from Villanova University
in Pennsylvania in 1980. Har
vard seemed ideal because his
family was from Massachusetts.
Then he began working for a
Philadelphia management con
sulting firm and decided he
would rather work on a MBA
degree.
"I chose Stanford because it
had the name and the teaching
methods," O'Toole, a first-year
MBA candidate, said. "The em
phasis seemed to be on learning
rather than the competition ele
ment at Harvard."
O'Toole's decision was en
hanced by conversations with
business personnel and Stanford
alumni, tie's satisfied with his
choice.
" I love Stanford because it ful
fills my expectations of graduate
education." O'Toole said. "The
professors are excellent and for
the most part the program is out
standing."
But O'Toole said the MBA
program is so intensive and self
contained that he doesn't have
much time to enjoy the aesthetic
experiences of Stanford. "There
comes a time when you get sick
of graduate students," O'Toole
said. But "there is a real separa
tion of graduates and under
graduates by the nature of our
classes.
"Sometimes we sit around and
say. "Why don't we meet
more undergraduate women?"
he said. "We try to go to Tresid
der tii see the other world."
Tresidder Union, and particu
larly the Coffee House, is fre
quented by grad students. But
Gail Perez thinks the Coffee
House is an inadequate facility
for grad students to socialize.
She'd like to see a pub or bar set
up for grads. This way, perhaps,
more interaction between grad
students will occur, she said.

There is no one place grad stu
dents meet, either on or off cam
pus. Most grads -tudy in their re
spective department's libraries
and socialize at private parties or
at department functions.
"The chief consequence of this
is that we're ineffective politi
cally," Perez said.
The lack of political clout may
be due in part to the high mobil
ity of grad students. Depending
on the program and department
they enter, grads can be here for
a one-year masters program or
four years or more for a docto
rate. This year alone. 2 I 52 of the
total graduate population are in
their first year at Stanford.
The lack of clout is evident in
poor grad turnout at the
Graduate Student Association's
Monday meetings. An average
of 15 students attend. Worse, the
ASSU recently announced that
the 10 graduate senators had a
far worse attendance record than
the 10 undergraduate senators
from May through December
1981. This, said ASSU Senate
Chair Dave Phelps, makes it dif
ficult for the ASSU to serve
graduate students.

It is the Stanford administra
tion's hope that these needs are
being met by the grad students'
departments. Perez said the En
glish Department is effective in
assisting her through her prog
ram, but O'Toole said that, while
the Business School attempts to
meet his needs, the number of
students in the MBA program
limits successful interaction bet
ween students and faculty.
Hastorf is aware of the prob-

Icm. "1 feel some departments
do a lut to make the student feel
a part of the departmental fam
ily, hut I can't think of many de
partments which don't do
much," he said. Ultimately,
however, Hastorf said, it is up to
the department to reach
graduate students.
The departmental family roie
doesn't stop the administration
from trying to make urad stu-

dents feel a part of Stanford Uni
versity. Last fall, for the first
time, the University's graduate
division held orientation prog
rams for all incoming grad stu
dents. They were held from Sept.
25 through Sept. 27 and included
teaching assistant workshops, a
graduate information fair,
guided tours, dinners and con
certs.
The graduate division offices
also sent out a booklet. "Guide
to University Resources for
Graduate Students," which in
cluded an introduction to stu
dent services, a dictionary on
"The Stanford Dialect" (" Hoo
Tow" , Hoover Tower, "The Vil
lage" ; Escondido Village) —and
an overview of Stanford's or
ganizational structure. The
graduate division office plans to
make both the orientation and
booklet permanent facets avail
able to grad students.
The University also sponsors
various clubs and organizations
designed specifically for grads.
Many of these groups, some with
the aid of the GSA, are attempt
ing to sponsor mutual functions
to facilitate awareness of
graduate needs.
Ultimately, however, it is up to
the grad student to make the
most of Stanford. While the un
dergrad relies on the University
as a whole to make him feel a
part of Stanford, the grad ex
perience depends on the size and
nature of his department. This is
the key difference between Stan
ford's graduate and under
graduate experience.



But the major common
denominator among grads
seems to be that few are able
to make the attempt to get
to know grads in other
schools. ..


The lack of graduate
communication between the
various schools is something
Stanford's administration
says it is acutely a ware of
and is trying to overcome.

Gail Perez thinks the Coffee

There is no one place grad stu

"The chief consequence of this
is that we're ineffective politi

The lack of political clout may
be due in part to the high mobil
ity of grad students. Depending
on the program and department
they enter, grads can be here for
a one-year masters program or
four years or more for a docto
rate. This year alone. 2 I 52 of the
total graduate population are in
their first year at Stanford.
The lack of clout is evident in
poor grad turnout at the
Graduate Student Association's
Monday meetings. An average
of 15 students attend. Worse, the
ASSU recently announced that
the 10 graduate senators had a
far worse attendance record than
the 10 undergraduate senators
from May through December
1981. This, said ASSU Senate
Chair Dave Phelps, makes it dif
ficult for the ASSU to serve
graduate students.

It is the Stanford administra

glish Department is effective in
assisting her through her prog

the Business School attempts to

limits successful interaction bet

however, Hastorf said, it is up to
the department to reach

The departmental family roie
doesn't stop the administration
from trying to make urad stu-

25 through Sept. 27 and included
teaching assistant workshops, a

guided tours, dinners and con

The graduate division offices
also sent out a booklet. "Guide

Graduate Students," which in
cluded an introduction to stu
dent services, a dictionary on
"The Stanford Dialect" (" Hoo

an overview of Stanford's or

graduate division office plans to
make both the orientation and

The University also sponsors
various clubs and organizations
designed specifically for grads.

It will take Aaker. 25. 2': years.

Stanford graduate students are a diverse lot.
The diversity can be attributed to the sheer number of grad
students — 55(H) — who are each enrolled in one of seven schools:
Business, Earth Sciences. Education. Engineering. Humanities
and Sciences. Law and Medicine.

Phc essence of graduate work is studying, a routine which
leaves time for little else. But there are common denominators
between the thousands of graduates: many worr\ about the lack
of available on-campus housing and spiral ing off-campus costs,
tuition costs are depressing and dwindling research funds
plague most departments.

Grad students can be characterized by three traits, said
Jean Fetter, associate dean of the graduate division: talent,
diversity and multi-faceted roles. (Stanford's graduate
administration is comprised of one dean, four associate
deans and five assistant deans.)
The "talent" aspect is self-evident, she said and "di
versitx" is attributed to the number of students from all

over the world.
It is the "multi-faceted" role which is the most
complex. Fetter said. "Graduates are students,
teachers, researchers, often parents and a lot of them
work." she said. "The graduate phase of your life is
complex because you have so many roles to play.
No other element of Stanford has that number of

facets."
This may coincide with an announcement re
cently made b\ Cowell Health Center. The
majority of patients using the Counseling and
Psychological Services at Cowell are grad stu
dents. Dr. David Dorosin, director of those

services, said.
"It is the graduates who have the greatest
pressures and problems," said Dr. Doro
sin. "Very often these people have worked
extremely hard in order to get into their
highly-rated professional school and
now that they have succeeded it seems
less important to be there," he said.
"They find themselves doubting
L whether this was the right choice for

them."
Another denominator is a grad's
teelings about the Stanford com
munity. Some grads love the re
laxed aura generated by the
people and environment which

constitute the Stanford com
munity, while others berate the
community for its lack of so
cial and political awareness.
But the major common

denominator among grads
seems to be that few are
able to make the attempt
to get to know grads in
other schools, let alone
Stanford's 6590 under
grads. Many grads
I meet undergrads while
serving as teacher's as

sistants, but Gail Perez,
a Ph.D. English candi
date, said. "We don't
socialize with the un
dergraduates because,
as teachers, it seems in
appropriate."'
The lack of graduate
communication bet
ween the various
schools is something
Stanford's administra
tion says it is accutely
aware of and is trying to
overcome. It's some
thing grads think ab
out, maybe worry
about and regret, but
it's something which is
not high on their list of
priorities. The priority
is Stanford University
in the academic sense.
"The general
philosophy of graduate
education is that it is a
salient part of this in-

stitution's educational prog
ram," said Albert Hastorf. vicc
president and provost. He said
Stanford strives to balance
graduate and undergraduate
education so that the two com
plement one another.
Nonetheless, Hastorf also said
Stanford "looks at graduate stu
dents as organized and operated
by departments" and that most
grads have little opportunity for
taking courses outside of their
departments.
Another key to understanding
graduate students is separating
the masters candidates—"pro
fessionals," as Hastorf calls them
— from the doctorate candi
dates. The professional prog
rams are found in law, business,
medicine, engineering and
communications. But most ad
vanced degree programs incor
porate the masters program into
the doctorate programs because
the University has relatively few
masters programs in its seven
schools. (The number of "pro
fessional" students, though, far
outweighs the number of docto
rate candidates.)
This separation of graduate
from graduate and graduate
from undergraduate begins with
the admissions process. All un
dergrads are admitted through
the dean of admissions' office
while grads apply to and are ad
mitted by one department. All
students, however, receive a de
gree from Stanford University.
At East Coast schools such as
Harvard and Princeton, the
grads and undergrads are enrol
led in separate colleges in those
institutions. Hastorf said the dif
ference between Stanford and
Harvard and Princeton is in
name only. The admissions pro
cess is identical, he said.
It's not only the admissions
process which is identical to East
Coast Schools,; the quality of
education is as superb, and in

many eases, better. In a 1978
study published In the American
Council 011 Education, "Rating
nt Graduate Programs," the
quality ot Stanford's faculty was
ranked among the top five na
tionally in fields, a total ex
ceeded only by Berkeley and
Harv aid.
While many grads said they
came to Stanford because it's a
beautiful campus and because
they wanted to live in California,
the bottom line is Stanford's
reputation. "It's a ri;:me that
rings the bell," Perex said.
It's a bell Terry O'Toole opted
for.
O' Toole was accepted by Har
vard Law School and received a
two-year deferred admission be
cause he wanted to work before
beginning graduate studies — a
trait common to a growing
number of graduate students and
desired by businesses. O'Toole,
23. graduated as an economics
major from Villanova University
in Pennsylvania in 1980. Har
vard seemed ideal because his
family was from Massachusetts.
Then he began working for a
Philadelphia management con
sulting firm and decided he
would rather work on a MBA
degree.
"I chose Stanford because it
had the name and the teaching
methods," O'Toole, a first-year
MBA candidate, said. "The em
phasis seemed to be on learning
rather than the competition ele
ment at Harvard."
O'Toole's decision was en
hanced by conversations with
business personnel and Stanford
alumni, tie's satisfied with his
choice.
" I love Stanford because it ful
fills my expectations of graduate
education." O'Toole said. "The
professors are excellent and for
the most part the program is out
standing."
But O'Toole said the MBA
program is so intensive and self
contained that he doesn't have
much time to enjoy the aesthetic
experiences of Stanford. "There
comes a time when you get sick
of graduate students," O'Toole
said. But "there is a real separa
tion of graduates and under
graduates by the nature of our
classes.
"Sometimes we sit around and
say. "Why don't we meet
more undergraduate women?"
he said. "We try to go to Tresid
der tii see the other world."
Tresidder Union, and particu
larly the Coffee House, is fre
quented by grad students. But
Gail Perez thinks the Coffee
House is an inadequate facility
for grad students to socialize.
She'd like to see a pub or bar set

overcome. It's some
thing grads think ab
out, maybe worry
about and regret, but
it's something which is
not high on their list of
priorities. The priority
is Stanford University
in the academic sense.
"The general
philosophy of graduate
education is that it is a
salient part of this in-

stitution's educational prog
ram," said Albert Hastorf. vicc
president and provost. He said
Stanford strives to balance
graduate and undergraduate
education so that the two com
plement one another.
Nonetheless, Hastorf also said
Stanford "looks at graduate stu
dents as organized and operated
by departments" and that most
grads have little opportunity for
taking courses outside of their
departments.
Another key to understanding
graduate students is separating
the masters candidates—"pro
fessionals," as Hastorf calls them
— from the doctorate candi
dates. The professional prog
rams are found in law, business,
medicine, engineering and
communications. But most ad
vanced degree programs incor
porate the masters program into
the doctorate programs because
the University has relatively few
masters programs in its seven
schools. (The number of "pro
fessional" students, though, far
outweighs the number of docto
rate candidates.)
This separation of graduate
from graduate and graduate
from undergraduate begins with
the admissions process. All un
dergrads are admitted through
the dean of admissions' office
while grads apply to and are ad
mitted by one department. All
students, however, receive a de
gree from Stanford University.
At East Coast schools such as
Harvard and Princeton, the
grads and undergrads are enrol
led in separate colleges in those
institutions. Hastorf said the dif
ference between Stanford and
Harvard and Princeton is in
name only. The admissions pro
cess is identical, he said.
It's not only the admissions
process which is identical to East
Coast Schools,; the quality of
education is as superb, and in

many eases, better. In a 1978
study published In the American
Council 011 Education, "Rating
nt Graduate Programs," the
quality ot Stanford's faculty was
ranked among the top five na
tionally in fields, a total ex
ceeded only by Berkeley and
Harv aid.
While many grads said they
came to Stanford because it's a
beautiful campus and because
they wanted to live in California,
the bottom line is Stanford's
reputation. "It's a ri;:me that
rings the bell," Perex said.
It's a bell Terry O'Toole opted
for.
O' Toole was accepted by Har
vard Law School and received a
two-year deferred admission be
cause he wanted to work before
beginning graduate studies — a
trait common to a growing
number of graduate students and
desired by businesses. O'Toole,
23. graduated as an economics
major from Villanova University
in Pennsylvania in 1980. Har
vard seemed ideal because his
family was from Massachusetts.
Then he began working for a
Philadelphia management con
sulting firm and decided he
would rather work on a MBA
degree.
"I chose Stanford because it
had the name and the teaching
methods," O'Toole, a first-year
MBA candidate, said. "The em
phasis seemed to be on learning
rather than the competition ele
ment at Harvard."
O'Toole's decision was en
hanced by conversations with
business personnel and Stanford
alumni, tie's satisfied with his
choice.
" I love Stanford because it ful
fills my expectations of graduate
education." O'Toole said. "The
professors are excellent and for
the most part the program is out
standing."
But O'Toole said the MBA
program is so intensive and self
contained that he doesn't have
much time to enjoy the aesthetic
experiences of Stanford. "There
comes a time when you get sick
of graduate students," O'Toole
said. But "there is a real separa
tion of graduates and under
graduates by the nature of our
classes.
"Sometimes we sit around and
say. "Why don't we meet
more undergraduate women?"
he said. "We try to go to Tresid
der tii see the other world."
Tresidder Union, and particu
larly the Coffee House, is fre
quented by grad students. But
Gail Perez thinks the Coffee
House is an inadequate facility
for grad students to socialize.
She'd like to see a pub or bar set
up for grads. This way, perhaps,
more interaction between grad
students will occur, she said.

There is no one place grad stu
dents meet, either on or off cam
pus. Most grads -tudy in their re
spective department's libraries
and socialize at private parties or
at department functions.
"The chief consequence of this
is that we're ineffective politi
cally," Perez said.
The lack of political clout may
be due in part to the high mobil
ity of grad students. Depending
on the program and department
they enter, grads can be here for
a one-year masters program or
four years or more for a docto
rate. This year alone. 2 I 52 of the
total graduate population are in
their first year at Stanford.
The lack of clout is evident in
poor grad turnout at the
Graduate Student Association's
Monday meetings. An average
of 15 students attend. Worse, the
ASSU recently announced that
the 10 graduate senators had a
far worse attendance record than
the 10 undergraduate senators
from May through December
1981. This, said ASSU Senate
Chair Dave Phelps, makes it dif
ficult for the ASSU to serve
graduate students.

It is the Stanford administra
tion's hope that these needs are
being met by the grad students'
departments. Perez said the En
glish Department is effective in
assisting her through her prog
ram, but O'Toole said that, while
the Business School attempts to
meet his needs, the number of
students in the MBA program
limits successful interaction bet
ween students and faculty.
Hastorf is aware of the prob-

Icm. "1 feel some departments
do a lut to make the student feel
a part of the departmental fam
ily, hut I can't think of many de
partments which don't do
much," he said. Ultimately,
however, Hastorf said, it is up to
the department to reach
graduate students.
The departmental family roie
doesn't stop the administration
from trying to make urad stu-

dents feel a part of Stanford Uni
versity. Last fall, for the first
time, the University's graduate
division held orientation prog
rams for all incoming grad stu
dents. They were held from Sept.
25 through Sept. 27 and included
teaching assistant workshops, a
graduate information fair,
guided tours, dinners and con
certs.
The graduate division offices
also sent out a booklet. "Guide
to University Resources for
Graduate Students," which in
cluded an introduction to stu
dent services, a dictionary on
"The Stanford Dialect" (" Hoo
Tow" , Hoover Tower, "The Vil
lage" ; Escondido Village) —and
an overview of Stanford's or
ganizational structure. The
graduate division office plans to
make both the orientation and
booklet permanent facets avail
able to grad students.
The University also sponsors
various clubs and organizations
designed specifically for grads.
Many of these groups, some with
the aid of the GSA, are attempt
ing to sponsor mutual functions
to facilitate awareness of
graduate needs.
Ultimately, however, it is up to
the grad student to make the
most of Stanford. While the un
dergrad relies on the University
as a whole to make him feel a
part of Stanford, the grad ex
perience depends on the size and
nature of his department. This is
the key difference between Stan
ford's graduate and under
graduate experience.



But the major common
denominator among grads
seems to be that few are able
to make the attempt to get
to know grads in other
schools. ..


The lack of graduate
communication between the
various schools is something
Stanford's administration
says it is acutely a ware of
and is trying to overcome.

It will take Aaker. 25. 2': years.

Stanford graduate students are a diverse lot.
The diversity can be attributed to the sheer number of grad
students — 55(H) — who are each enrolled in one of seven schools:
Business, Earth Sciences. Education. Engineering. Humanities
and Sciences. Law and Medicine.

Phc essence of graduate work is studying, a routine which
leaves time for little else. But there are common denominators
between the thousands of graduates: many worr\ about the lack
of available on-campus housing and spiral ing off-campus costs,
tuition costs are depressing and dwindling research funds
plague most departments.

Grad students can be characterized by three traits, said
Jean Fetter, associate dean of the graduate division: talent,
diversity and multi-faceted roles. (Stanford's graduate
administration is comprised of one dean, four associate
deans and five assistant deans.)
The "talent" aspect is self-evident, she said and "di
versitx" is attributed to the number of students from all

over the world.
It is the "multi-faceted" role which is the most
complex. Fetter said. "Graduates are students,
teachers, researchers, often parents and a lot of them
work." she said. "The graduate phase of your life is
complex because you have so many roles to play.
No other element of Stanford has that number of

facets."
This may coincide with an announcement re
cently made b\ Cowell Health Center. The
majority of patients using the Counseling and
Psychological Services at Cowell are grad stu
dents. Dr. David Dorosin, director of those

services, said.
"It is the graduates who have the greatest
pressures and problems," said Dr. Doro
sin. "Very often these people have worked
extremely hard in order to get into their
highly-rated professional school and
now that they have succeeded it seems
less important to be there," he said.
"They find themselves doubting
L whether this was the right choice for

them."
Another denominator is a grad's
teelings about the Stanford com
munity. Some grads love the re
laxed aura generated by the
people and environment which

constitute the Stanford com
munity, while others berate the
community for its lack of so
cial and political awareness.
But the major common

denominator among grads
seems to be that few are
able to make the attempt
to get to know grads in
other schools, let alone
Stanford's 6590 under
grads. Many grads
I meet undergrads while
serving as teacher's as

sistants, but Gail Perez,
a Ph.D. English candi
date, said. "We don't
socialize with the un
dergraduates because,
as teachers, it seems in
appropriate."'
The lack of graduate
communication bet
ween the various
schools is something
Stanford's administra
tion says it is accutely
aware of and is trying to
overcome. It's some
thing grads think ab
out, maybe worry
about and regret, but
