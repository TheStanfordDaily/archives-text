## Feminist groups active, open to different perspectives 
### Karen Springen 
Stanford may not be known as a hotbed of
radical feminist movements. But the campus
has certainly changed since the lifting 50 years
ago of the "500" rule, which limited female en
rollment to 500.
In addition to adding a feminist studies ma
jor, the University does house many women's
groups and support centers. Despite these tan
gible gains, well-known feminist Leah Halper,
gave a varied assessment of women's progress
at Stanford. Citing rapes specifically and sexism
in general, Halper said, "There are certain
things that don't change." But Halper accented
the positive change in atmosphere brought by
the fefrtinl'St'studies program. At the'same tirrie,
she warned. "I don't think that anyone should
sit back and say it's all done."
The following guide should help prevent just
that by providing a few of the women's re
sources available on campus and in the com
munity.
Women's Center
The Women's Center, funded through an
ASSU fee assessment, provides a student-run
gathering place which is mainly used by under
graduate women. Aurora, a collective and
feminist journal, and various support groups
use the facilities. It also houses a library with
many feminist journals.
Dayna Goldfine, a feminist studies major,
said the Women's Center provides a casual at
mosphere which invites people to drop in and

socialize.
Elaine Holliman. a member of Aurora and
the feminist studies committee, said, "The real
stress is that there are a lot of different per
spectives within feminism and they're all wel
come."
The Bridge
The Bridge offers peer counseling and gener
al support for women's efforts. Last fall, for ex
ample, the Bridge helped to sponsor "Working
Against Rape — Current Research and
Strategies for Change," a rape awareness week.
This summer the Bridge aided a new project, the
Lesbian Support Group.
According to Odi Mendez, the Bridge coun
selor whey treads' '*ne Lesbian Support Group,
the new organization consists of six women.
"Women want to talk with women," said
Mendez. It is a closed group, similar to a thera
py group, she said. "Part of the reason that it is
closed is fear of coming out," she added.
"They're afraid of the reaction."
Mendez said that similar groups off-campus
generally charge for their services.
Rape Education Project
A group of students and staff people con
cerned and angry about the incidents of re
ported rape here founded the The Rape Educa
tion Project in 1979.
According to graduate Leah Halper, the
project gained momentum when a videotape,
"Working Against Rape," was finished..
The group often uses the video tape in dorm

discussions and outreaches. In addition, the or
ganization coordinates self-defense in the resi
dences.
It received a fee assessment last year in con
junction with the SURE escort service.
CROW
The Center for Research on Women
(CROW), located in Serra House, is an in
terdisciplinary center concerned with research
and education on gender and gender-related is
sues. It is designed to disseminate information
and to bring "new insights into past and present
patterns of women's lives," said office assistant
Bethany Alley. CROW is staffed by six women.
Founded in 1976 with a Ford Foundation
Grant, CROW three years later gained Univer
sity recognition as a department. The academic
research center is partially funded by the Uni
versity. It houses Signs, a leading feminist jour
nal, and offers internships for credit.
The center stresses research rather than stu
dent service, according to Alley.
CROW is presently working on a study of
women, work, and stress. In addition, CROW,
14 faculty members from the sociology depart
ment, and Boys Town are researching "The
Perceived Conflicts between Feminists Intersts
and Children's Interests."
CROW has offered a popular lecture series
each quarter for several years. Formerly known
as the Wednesday noon series, they are now
called the Jing Lyman lectures, after former

University President Richard Lyman's wife.
The Lv mans were strong supporters of CROW,
and Mrs. Lyman was a frequent guest at the lec
ture series. The center has a tape of each lecture
in its library, open to the public.
The feminist studies program, which began
two years ago, is an outgrowth of CROW. The
Committee on Feminist Studies, developed in
conjunction with the major, works on cur
riculum and attracting high-calibre professors.
It consists of two undergraduate and three
graduate members.
Graduate Women's Support Network
Unique in that it serves a dual purpose, the
Graduate Women's Support - Network
(GWSN) promotes feminist research and sup
ports women in doing their research.
Sorca O'Connor, former coordinator of the
organization, said the group aids each woman
"in her particular struggle in a male-dominated
setting (the University)."
She called the group "a social and academic
network" designed "to keep graduate women in
touch with other graduate women and to widen
all those networks." Many graduate women ar
rive with few links to other women here, she
said. Thegroupdoesmaintain links with undei
graduate women.
O'Connor said that while CP «v focu«es on
already established female scholars researching
women's issues, the GWSN supports female
graduate students regardless of their research

subject. She added that the network is "some
what political."
GSWN also offers workshops and lecture
series, sponsors speakers, and publishes a
monthly newsletter.
Community resources
The University offers a large number of
women's support groups. But students should
not be misled that the Women's Group,
CROW. Stanford Women in Law. etc. are the
only available resources. Students here may use
a wide variety of community centers ranging
from Planned Parenthood to the Mid-Peninsu
la Support Network.
Stanford women are not sheltered from
abuse and so-eailed domestic violence suffered
by women off-campus. According to Anne
Wuri, community educator at the Mid-Peninsu
la Support Network, about one out of five peo
ple in a recent survey had been involved in a dat
ing relationship marred by violence. Battered
women are not only battered wives: several
Stanford women have called the Network, she
said.
The Mid-Peninsula Support Network, lo
cated at 2221) View Street, Mountain View of
fers crisis services for battered women and their
families 24 hours a day. The Santa Clara agen
v.,,. staffed largely by volunteers, is community
based and non-profit.
For information during office hours, call
964-6503. The hotline number is 964-2266.

nal, and offers internships for credit.
The center stresses research rather than stu
dent service, according to Alley.
CROW is presently working on a study of
women, work, and stress. In addition, CROW,
14 faculty members from the sociology depart
ment, and Boys Town are researching "The
Perceived Conflicts between Feminists Intersts
and Children's Interests."
CROW has offered a popular lecture series
each quarter for several years. Formerly known
as the Wednesday noon series, they are now
called the Jing Lyman lectures, after former

University President Richard Lyman's wife.
The Lv mans were strong supporters of CROW,
and Mrs. Lyman was a frequent guest at the lec
ture series. The center has a tape of each lecture
in its library, open to the public.
The feminist studies program, which began
two years ago, is an outgrowth of CROW. The
Committee on Feminist Studies, developed in
conjunction with the major, works on cur
riculum and attracting high-calibre professors.
It consists of two undergraduate and three
graduate members.
Graduate Women's Support Network
Unique in that it serves a dual purpose, the
Graduate Women's Support - Network
(GWSN) promotes feminist research and sup
ports women in doing their research.
Sorca O'Connor, former coordinator of the
organization, said the group aids each woman
"in her particular struggle in a male-dominated
setting (the University)."
She called the group "a social and academic
network" designed "to keep graduate women in
touch with other graduate women and to widen
all those networks." Many graduate women ar
rive with few links to other women here, she
said. Thegroupdoesmaintain links with undei
graduate women.
O'Connor said that while CP «v focu«es on
already established female scholars researching
women's issues, the GWSN supports female
graduate students regardless of their research

subject. She added that the network is "some
what political."
GSWN also offers workshops and lecture
series, sponsors speakers, and publishes a
monthly newsletter.
Community resources
The University offers a large number of
women's support groups. But students should
not be misled that the Women's Group,
CROW. Stanford Women in Law. etc. are the
only available resources. Students here may use
a wide variety of community centers ranging
from Planned Parenthood to the Mid-Peninsu
la Support Network.
Stanford women are not sheltered from
abuse and so-eailed domestic violence suffered
by women off-campus. According to Anne
Wuri, community educator at the Mid-Peninsu
la Support Network, about one out of five peo
ple in a recent survey had been involved in a dat
ing relationship marred by violence. Battered
women are not only battered wives: several
Stanford women have called the Network, she
said.
The Mid-Peninsula Support Network, lo
cated at 2221) View Street, Mountain View of
fers crisis services for battered women and their
families 24 hours a day. The Santa Clara agen
v.,,. staffed largely by volunteers, is community
based and non-profit.

Spurred by a series of rapes on campus,
Stanford feminist groups were very active
and experienced high visibility in the Bay
Area press last year. (left to right) To pro
test the assaults on female students, a
feminist wears a red arm band. Students
gather in White Plaza for a lunchtime rally
protesting rape and supporting feminist
causes. Catherine MacKinnon — feminist
and visiting law professor — came to sym
bolize the campus feminist effort.
Stanford may not be known as a hotbed of
radical feminist movements. But the campus
has certainly changed since the lifting 50 years
ago of the "500" rule, which limited female en
rollment to 500.
In addition to adding a feminist studies ma
jor, the University does house many women's
groups and support centers. Despite these tan
gible gains, well-known feminist Leah Halper,
gave a varied assessment of women's progress
at Stanford. Citing rapes specifically and sexism
in general, Halper said, "There are certain
things that don't change." But Halper accented
the positive change in atmosphere brought by
the fefrtinl'St'studies program. At the'same tirrie,
she warned. "I don't think that anyone should
sit back and say it's all done."
The following guide should help prevent just
that by providing a few of the women's re
sources available on campus and in the com
munity.
Women's Center
The Women's Center, funded through an
ASSU fee assessment, provides a student-run
gathering place which is mainly used by under
graduate women. Aurora, a collective and
feminist journal, and various support groups
use the facilities. It also houses a library with
many feminist journals.
Dayna Goldfine, a feminist studies major,
said the Women's Center provides a casual at
mosphere which invites people to drop in and

socialize.
Elaine Holliman. a member of Aurora and
the feminist studies committee, said, "The real
stress is that there are a lot of different per
spectives within feminism and they're all wel
come."
The Bridge
The Bridge offers peer counseling and gener
al support for women's efforts. Last fall, for ex
ample, the Bridge helped to sponsor "Working
Against Rape — Current Research and
Strategies for Change," a rape awareness week.
This summer the Bridge aided a new project, the
Lesbian Support Group.
According to Odi Mendez, the Bridge coun
selor whey treads' '*ne Lesbian Support Group,
the new organization consists of six women.
"Women want to talk with women," said
Mendez. It is a closed group, similar to a thera
py group, she said. "Part of the reason that it is
closed is fear of coming out," she added.
"They're afraid of the reaction."
Mendez said that similar groups off-campus
generally charge for their services.
Rape Education Project
A group of students and staff people con
cerned and angry about the incidents of re
ported rape here founded the The Rape Educa
tion Project in 1979.
According to graduate Leah Halper, the
project gained momentum when a videotape,
"Working Against Rape," was finished..
The group often uses the video tape in dorm

discussions and outreaches. In addition, the or
ganization coordinates self-defense in the resi
dences.
It received a fee assessment last year in con
junction with the SURE escort service.
CROW
The Center for Research on Women
(CROW), located in Serra House, is an in
terdisciplinary center concerned with research
and education on gender and gender-related is
sues. It is designed to disseminate information
and to bring "new insights into past and present
patterns of women's lives," said office assistant
Bethany Alley. CROW is staffed by six women.
Founded in 1976 with a Ford Foundation
Grant, CROW three years later gained Univer
sity recognition as a department. The academic
research center is partially funded by the Uni
versity. It houses Signs, a leading feminist jour
nal, and offers internships for credit.
