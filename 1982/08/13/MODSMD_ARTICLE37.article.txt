## ET CETERA... Alumni offer homes away from home 
### 
When students hear of the
Stanford Alumni Association,
many falsely conclude that this
mysterious organization exists
only to take their mone\. and has
nothing to do with students until
they graduate.
But the Bowman Alumni
House offers many services to
current students, including the
Alumni Contact Service. Home
Away From Home. Experience
by Degrees and the Student
l iaison programs. The Student
Alumni Network (STAN),
is the umbrella organization for
the programs.
Vlargot Nelson, director of
class scr\ ices and coordinator of
STAN, said the services are
based on alumni-student interac
tion.
In the Home Away from
Home program, students are
matched with a local family. Nel
son said the alumns become a
"surrogate family."
The Home Away from Home
sci\ ice. v\ hich started last spring,
is geared toward freshmen and
originated from alums hosting
senior brunches. The alums ex
pressed the desire to meet with
students at an earlier stage than
senior year.
About 40 alumns and 70
freshmen participated last \ear.
And with 35.000 alumns in the
Bay Area, the program can ex
pand easily.
According to Nelson, students

Pack will be matched with
alumni families on a first-come.
tirst-ser\ e basis. She said they try
to match student-alumni in
terests if possible.
" Both students and alumni are
interested and enthusiastic." she
said.
The Alumni Contact Service is
designed to provide career in
formation to students of any year
and what's more, these contacts
may lead to jobs.
According to Nelson, over
5000 alumni have responded to
the contact service request card.

Over 1500 of these responses
have been in the Ba\ Area alone.
Nelson estimated that 10 stu
dents use the service each day.
Listings are filed under New
York. Chicago. Washington.
Oregon. Washington. D.C.. Los
Angelas and the Bay Area.
Alumni list their major, degrees,
business organization, com
ments and whether their firms
have an\ job openings.
Experience by Degrees,
another program which began
spring quarter, brings recent
alumni hack, to cWSfihSP their
specific degree with students.
According to Nelson, about
seven Experience by Degree
programs will nelu ihis year.

She described the event as a
sherry hour with about 15 alums
and 70 students, the first of
which for this year will be Oc
tober 20 in the History Depart
ment.
Nelson emphasized that the
new program gets \cuing alums
involved and allows them to give
students a feeling for what the
first five years and the trials im
mediatelv after graduation are
like.
.il I be StudcijjJ \jjmini Network,
a committee' of about 60 stu
dents. coordinates all class ac
tivities. STAN's purpose is to
provide seed funds for future

projects.
The Student Liaison Program
links students with the alumni
club of their geographic area,
often through freshman parties,
according to club director Caro
lyn Manning. She added that
some of the clubs, such as the
Chicago organization, hold
Christmas parties as well.
Manning said the association
has almost 100 clubs, with more
than 75 of them in the United
States. Some of the clubs help
with the Alumni Contact Ser
vice. 1 he Washington, D.C.

primary aim is to alumni and pa
rents of undergraduates."
