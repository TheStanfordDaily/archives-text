# Tour-guides’ impressions
## Tours orient visitors, newcomers 
### 
Aside from its reputation as one of the best
universities in the nation, Stanford also ean boast
of being one of the most seenic and beautiful cam
puses. From the foothills to the bay. as we sa\. the
sprawling campus gets enough sightseers and
tourists in its own right to rival many of San Fran
cisco's most famous attractions.
Because of this, the University offers student
tour guides who escort visitors around the main
areas of campus, offering historical and informa
tive anecdotes about Jane and I.eland Stanford's
gift to California.
What follows are the musings of some of the
people who guide those tours. Some of the mis
conceptions they chronicle may surprise vou —
others you may find you shared.
Okay, 'fess up! When you were looking at Stan
ford senior year, did you ask your tour guide his
SAT score? If you didn't, you're in the minority.
According to senior Rich Martinez, who is al
ready going down in guide service history for his
record-setting 750-plus hours of work, most
people ask what the University looks for in an
applicant. Martinez said his standard response is
"Nobody will tell you."
High school students do, in fact, make up one of
the biggest groups of tourists to the Stanford cam
pus. Tour guides like Lisa Brown, another vete
ran. describes this, groyjj;as one, the ntjepabtys of
which are usually "dressed up. nervous and
quiet." She agreed that most high school students
ask for personal grade point average information
in contrast with older visitors who are interested
primarily in Memorial Church and with alumns
who are curious about newly-constructed build
ings.
Some of the most commonly held misconcep
tions, Martinez explained, relate to President
Herbert Hoover, a member of the first class which
graduated in 1895.
"People assume that because he has a tower
everybody likes him," said Martinez, even though
the most thought many students have given to the
depression era president last surfaced in high
school American history classes.
While Hoover Tower, affectionately referred to
by many as "Hoover's last erection," may have
failed to immortalize the former president as a
historical figure, the structure itself has gained a
somewhat infamous legend about it as a suicide
jump-off point. Martinez noted that visitors often
ask about committing suicide from the top of the
tower, although this is virtually impossible unless
one is extremely thin, as the narrow rails fence in
the 250-foot high observation platform.
Most questions, however, are not out of the
ordinary. "They're afraid to ask questions in a
large group." said Martinez.
As a guide myself. I have concluded, too, that
most visitors stick to "socially acceptable" ques
tions like, "Where is the Bookstore?", "Is there

going to be another earthquake while I am in the
top of the tower?" (followed by nervous laughter,
even when assured that the only major quake so
far was in 1906), "Is food service as bad as they
say?", and" What is that tree over there?" (To this
last question. 1 ignorantly say that it is a "palo
alto" (tall tree) whether it is a bush ora redwood.)
(iuests also ask if Stanford includes a junior
college when they see the Leland Stanford, Jr.
sweatshirts. The answer is no of course, as the
University was named in memory of Leland and
Jane Stanford's son, Leland. Jr.
And there will always be someone like junior
Celeste Kruzic. who asked her guide. "Where do
you go for an ice cream cone?"
Martinez observed that "not enough Stanford
students go to the top of the tower." just as many
New Yorkers have not been to the top of the
Lmpire State Building. Most guides agree that the
majority of visitors to the-last erection fall into the
"paid admission" category — they are mainly
foreign visitors and high school students, even
though a trip to the campus landmark — or eye
sore, it's up to you — ix free for students and
University personnel. Even alumns must pay a
50-cent admission fee.
Now aren't you dying to go on a tour? If you
can't make the free 45-minute walking tours
which .leave from the visitor information cell in
front of the quadrangle at 1 I a.m. and 2:15 p.m.
Monday through Saturday, here's a somewhat
edited version you can safely read at your desk,
without dodging cyclists or being pegged by pas
sersby as a tourist:
I he University is privately supported and non
denominational. It opened in 1891. Senator Le
land Stanford and his wife, Jane, dedicated the
then 8800-acre (now 8200-acre) education center
to their son. Leland. who died of typhoid fever at
Hi. They sought to "educate the children of
California."
About 465 students — including Herbert
Hoover — entered the first class. About 13,000
students, slightly over half of these under
graduate. now attend the University. Stanford has
been coeducational since it opened.
Memorial Church was completed in 1903, de
stroyed in the 1906 earthquake and reopened in
I C JI 5. The church houses services each Sunday at
11 a.m.
Now you've got the basics — satisfy your own
curiosity on your own if you'd like; most depart
ments or museums or libraries or even the
Bookstore can provide you with more information
on the subject of your choice.
And do take a tour if you're so inclined, but
remember, we tour guides don't know it all either
as I found out one day in Mem C'hu when a little
child looked up at me and asked "Is God here?"
