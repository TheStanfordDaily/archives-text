The National Labor Relations Board has certified
the defeat of the University clericals' attempt to
unionize 15 months ago.
University Counsel Priscilla Wheeler said that
she was "not at all surprised" that the NLRB over
ruled the last remaining legal challenge by United
Stanford Workers (USW) Local 715. They con
tended that the University influenced the election
by announcing a change in the wage structure for
nonexempt employees two months before the
election. "It (the election) was a pretty resounding
defeat," she said.
Clerical workers voted 930 to 554 to reject USW
a; a bargaining unit for its 1800 members on May 7,
1981.
Wheeler said she was glad to have the issue re
solved. "The only difficult thing was having it in
limbo so long," she salid.
Wheeler said that "organizing can go on at any
point in time," but that the clericals would have to
secure a 30 percent showing again in order to sub
mit a new petition.
Gloria Parks, head of the Office Staff Organizing
Committee (OSOC), said the ad hoc group is "not
engaged in an active union drive."

She said OSOC continues to hold study groups,
distribute information and give advice. "We don't
have any power," she said.
Kathy McKennan, field representative for USW
said, "It's finalized ... We just have to start over."
She added, "a lot of clericals have been calling ask
ing what can be done."
A University task force, formed as a reaction to
the unionization drive, is expected to issue recom
mendations to President Donald Kennedy and the
Administrative Council in September on per
sonnel issues.
USW initially filed 16 objections with the NLRB.
The union later withdrew 12 of these and the NLRB
overruled three of the four remaining objections.
The University submitted documents to the
NLRB showing that the change in wage structure
was contemplated more than a year before
OSOC's unionization attempt as evidence that the
administration was not attempting to influence the
election. Traditionally salary increases are an
nounced in March.
USW now represents 1300 technical, main
tenance, and service workers here. The proposed
clerical bargaining unit would have been made up
of about 1800 office and library support staff.
