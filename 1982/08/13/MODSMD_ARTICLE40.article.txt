Personalized contact between staff
and students in a sometimes too im
personal university environment is
the underlying goal of the Freshman
Advising System here.
While this system is considered
better than the less personal, cen
tralized advising systems at many
Eastern and large state schools, even
many people who are involved say
there is much room for improvement
in the Stanford program as well.
Some of the improvements which
have already been implemented —
based largely on student feedback —
include more attempts to educate
freshmen on the aims of the advising
system. Expectations and goals of
both the advisers and advisees are
discussed at greater length. On the
faculty side, a number of attempts
have been made to improve the qual
ity of counseling opportunities, such
as dinners each quarter shared by ad
visers and advisees.
These dinners, which have become
a formal part of the system, now

allow students to meet at least three
times with their advisers during the
quarter, outside of the stall person's
office. This represents a change from
past expectations that advisers
should attempt to eat in the dorms
once a week.
Faculty who were already heavily
committed would be unable to live up
to this expectation from the very be

ginning and would begin "drawing
back" from an inherent sense of par
tial failure, explained Alice Supton.
associate dean for residential educa
tion.
Now, however, this system creates
a greater feeling of working with a
team. By getting to know members of
the team, i.e. other advisers, Resi

dent Fellows, RAs and the recently
added Advising Associates, the ad
visers can learn to whom on the team
they can refer questions that they
personally may not he able to answer.
Also the team concept is important
for the student's benefit as well, be
cause if he or she cannot relate to the
adviser assigned, the student can eas
ily seek out another member of the
team for help, or even change to
another adviser.
Meanwhile the Advising Associate
program is designed to incorporate
peer advising to supplement regular
advisers and offer the freshmen, "the
perspective of an upper classman."
said Tania Granoff, advising coor
dinator of the Academic Information
Center.
Another step taken to aid the ad
viser has been to be sure they are
aware of the various resources avail
able to them for answering questions

they are unsure of and the distrihu
tion of a small, revised booklet callei
the Adviser's Yellow Pages whicl
makes referrals and researeh easier
Unreal expectations have
been the thorn in the side of the advis
ing system; some freshmen evpeci
miracles from their advisers ant
hence advisers feel inadequate in the
face of these unrealistic expectations
"Be aware that these people .iren'

are human beings who can be un
iquely useful but they can't be ail

Granoff warned.
Supton agreed that ads isers sltoul
stimulate the general trains o
thought a student is having, not die
tate an unwavering path.
""It requires the taking of initiativ
in a lot of ways. Everybody, ad\ isei
and freshmen, has to work at it."
