## Card football in '82? Start guessing.

'This year we are
going to try to
establish the pass
first because that's
what we do best.
For example, if you
were Rocky
Marciano you
wouldn't come out
and spar around.'

Most sportswriters would rather read
tarot cards than try to make predictions
about the Stanford football team. The
Cardinal surprised the football world
last season when its highly touted team
featuring All-Americas John Elway and
Darrin Nelson sputtered out a 4-7 rec
ord. This season, for the first time in
several years, the team has failed to
make the top 20 in any of the preseason
polls, hut head coach Paul Wiggin
thinks he might have his most talented
crew since he's been here and hopes to
give the "so called" experts a surprise of
his own.
"This is the strongest team we've had
since I've been here." Wiggin said re
cently. "The great percentage of the

kids were recruited by our staff and
that's important. 1 ast year we had kind
of a generation gap. We had nine fifth
year seniors and we couldn't seem to
bring them all together."
Last years problems stemmed from
many sources but the most common
criticism in the early part of the season
was the lack of imagination in the of
fense. Stanford tried to use the run to
set up its passing game, but all that
meant was that Cardinal quarterback
John Klway was faced with obvious
passing situations with third and long.
By the end of the year, the philosophy
changed as the Cardinal ran over its
final three opponents, scoring 147
points in the process.
This season Wiggin and his staff plan
to utili/e the pass even more and hope
to keep last years momentum rolling.
"You have to come and do what you
do best," Wiggin explained following a
practice this fall. "I think we were
trying to be a little too cute in the early
games last year. This year we are going
to try to establish the pass first because
that he what we do best. For example if
you were Rocky Marciano you
wouldn't come out and spar around. I
don't believe Darrin would have gained
1000 yards last year if we didn't start to
pass as much as we did. We must estab
lish the pass to set up the run because
that is what we do best."
Much of Stanford's fortunes this year
lie with All-America and Heistnan
Trophy candidate Klway who may just
be the best in a long line of great
Cardinal quarterbacks. Klway is close
to breaking almost every Stanford and
Pacific-10 passing record and has been

called by many scouts as the best pro
quarterback prospect ever.
Klway had an excellent year last year
for anybody but Klway. Although he
passed for 2674 yards and 20 touch
downs. it fell short of his phenomenal
sophomore season as Klwav was both

ered by a nagging ankle injury suffered
in the season opener against Purdue. In
Ins three years on the I arm. Klway has
yet to go to a how I game and admits he
was frustrated last season hut is excited
about the team's prospects this year.
"I dellniteh want to do something

this year," Klway said during fall work
outs. "This is the best football team I've
been on since I've been here. I think the
Rose Bowl is a real possibility. "We've
got a lot of experience at the skilled
positions. The only person we lost was
Darrin. We also have the best offensive
line since I've been here.
"The losses we've suffered while I've
been here have not really been that bad
because 1 think I've learned from them.
I think that adversity has made me a
better person if not a better player. Our
schedule is tough again. We have a
tough schedule every year. To have a
chance, we are going to have to keep ev
ery body healthy because we don't have
a whole lot of depth."
Although Klway might be the gem of
the offense, any fine jewel must be
guarded. The offensive line returns only
two of five starters from last year but
Wiggin and Klway both think that it
could be the best line on the Karm in the
past several years.
"We like our starting offensive line."
Wiggin said. "Our front line is very
critical to us."
Junior Mall Moran and senior Den
nis Kngel -ire the only returning starters
with Moran switching from left tackle
to right guard this season. Junior Jeff
Deaton takes over ihe left tackle posi
tion while seniors Mike Teeuws and
C hris Rose will play center and tackle
respectively. Two other players who
could figure in the scheme of things are
sophomore center Brent Martin and
freshman redshirt tackle John Barnes.
Wiggin readily admits that his most
immediate concern about the offensive
line is depth, \lthough his startinu unit

could he the best he's had in the past
several years. Wiggin said he's noticed a
significant difference in practice when
the starting unit is not in. The offensive
line is one of the most difficult positions
to learn and Wiggin said the problem
stems from more a lack of experience in
the backups than a lack of talent.
I ast year Stanford lost receiver An
dre Tyler in fall practice and entered the
Purdue game with virtually no ex
perience among its receievers. This year
things have changed. The Cardinal will
open up with senior flanker Mike
Tolliver and sophomore split end Emile
Harry and are loaded in depth and ex
perience.
Tolliver who was thrust into the
limelight as Stanford's number one re
ceiver after the injury to Tyler, re
sponded well last season. In his first
start, he snagged eight passes for I6S
yards against Purdue. While drawing
the double coverage which was sup
posed to have gone to Tyler, he still
managed to snag 33 passes for 639 yards
and seven touchdowns.
Emile Harry, last season's highly
touted freshman, gained invaluable
game experience last year and his pres
ence should take the pressure off
Tolliver. Don Lonsinger, Eric Mullens
and Steve Brown are all experienced
backups and freshman speedster Kenny
Williams will should also log some
playing time.
Tolliver. for one, does not diminish
the importance of game experience.
"7 he biggest difference I see is that I am
more relaxed." he said. "You can prac
tice all you want but until you get into
