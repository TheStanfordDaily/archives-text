## 'Incomparable’ band announcer Hal Mickelson interviewed 
### Edwin Marshall Beau 
The heavyset character in the
rumpled tweed sportsjacket.
pointed out by the barkeep as the
Stanford Band Announcer, was
sitting sideways in the carved-up
wooden booth, scowling, study
ing the business page of the
Chronicle
The Dailv'% correspondent ap
proached him warilv. "Uncle
HalT
"No, I'm Richard Simmons,
and I'm hanging around here
waiting for my voice to change "
The voice wasn't that of Rich
ard Simmons, but it also wasn't
the stentorian bellow the reporter
remembered having heard during
pre-game and halftime shows.
"You don't sound like you."
"Look. I can't do that circus
ringmaster. '30s-new scaster
voice for more than 10 or 15
minutes a week. I mean. I could,
but I'd lose my job and what few
friends I have. Take a seal. I like
to think that most of the time. I
sound like Jimmy Stewart when
he was my age."
"W hat is your age?"
"I've *>een doing the band an
nouncer bit, off and on. since I
was a junior in 1969. when men
were men and Commies were
scum. Count on your fingers."
"Slavbe I should ask you what
the Stanford Marching Band will
be doing this fall."
"Maybe you should offer to
buy me a beer, fearing that if you
don't. I'll get hoarse and grumpy.

and you'll have to go and in
terview Mark Mancall instead."
"I could talk to Arthur Barnes
"You could, but he's ask vou
to buy him a drink, too. and
probably a call brand Vou'll gel
off at least as cheap with me Tell
your editor you had to spend it
on gas in order to meet me. Write
it up as 'fuel' on >our expense re
port. You'll even be telling the
truth, technically speaking."
A cold St Pauli Girl was pro
duced and set before the some
what recalcitrant subject. He fin
ished polishing a pair of horn-rim
glasses, carefully hooked them
over his ears, and brushed back a
forelock tinged slightly with
gray.
He didn't exactly swill the
beer, but about a third of it was
gone before he put the bottle
down again.
"The band this fall is going to
be a tighter, more cohesive per
forming unit than you've heard
in the past few years. After all. it's
the sound that really sets the Stan
ford Band apart from those look
alike wimps in the Ivy League:
not only the glandular secretions,
the way they go into transports of
ecstasy when they bust their
chops. I think you're going to see
them playing with more energy
than you've seen in a while, and
the difference in the sound will
prove it."
"Could you describe that
sound as kick-ass rock and roll?"

"I'd call it industrial-strength
rock and roll, even weapons
grade rock and roll."

I'm sure that neither the men nor
women will leave any of their
equipment up in the stands."
"What I meant to ask. will they
be putting any — well, any ex
plicit anatomical representations
— you know — into their for
mations?
"It's heen done, and done to
death. The Princeton band and
the Vale hand do it.and the
Harvard band does it to the ex
tent they know what such objects
look like; the Rich Marching Ow
Band, or MOB. has done it.and I
saw in the public prints that the
Humboldt State Marching Lum
berjacks have done it Next thing
you know, you'll see a long,
cigar-shaped rocket with two
round fuel tanks at one end as the
final formation of a Peace
through Strength halftime show
at Jerry Falwell's Liberty Baptist
College, and the whole left wing
of the marching band movement
will have to re-think its fun

damental premises
"You're saying that things
have changed, and that the alum
ri will be happy with this year's
v hows at Stanford."
"Hell. no. the alumni won't be
happv Thev're conditioned to be
unhappy They're conditioned to
see things that aren't even there.
It's a Dickensian nightmare:
Gross Expectations "
"W hat are vou doing to avoid
bad taste '"
"I'm staving as far away from
'.he V XV all as possible. And
I categor cailv deny that anyone

"Bitter something?"
"I'll evel with vou. I'm a law
yer \ corporate lawyer, at that.
Lawvers aren"t -upposed to be
nce Lawver* are supposed to
oppress the friendless. V\ hen I
heard you were from the Daily. I
-urmised vou were one of the
friendless, and 1 saw my task
before me."
"That raises an interesting
point. I'm told that you're a com
pany attorney for. shall we say. a
Palo Alto-based electronics and
computer manufacturer. What
do the people you work with
think about your being the Stan
ford Band Announcer?"

"They don't think about it
often, thank the Lord. Even if
they did. they're a tolerant
bunch. \nd I suppose they figure
it might help with college recruit
ing. or campus sales, or some
thing Want to buy a calculator?

ciation schedules and discounted

nipulation ..."
"Do you gel a kickback from
the Bookstore if I put that in the
story?"
"In addition to being the Stan
ford Band Announcer. I'm on the
Board of Directors of the non
profit corporation which pub
lishes the Daily. The Bookstore is
a big advertiser. One hand
washes the other."
"Before we plumb the depths
of your crassness, do you any
more or less serious words of ad
vice for the entering freshman
class?"
"More or less serious. For the
next four years or so, those
freshmen will have a chance to
pick up some skills they may use
in their careers and some
Brownie points for getting into
graduate or professional school.

At the same time, they'll have a
chance to stretch their minds
around a couple of truly signifi
cant ideas that will make a real
difference in the way they live
their lives. You can't do the
mind-stretching part unless you
stay loose, have a few laughs, and
keep things in perspective. Going
to a football game on a Saturday
afternoon helps you keep things
in perspective.
"When you watch the team
perform, you're watching people
who have worked incredibly hard
to develop themselves and their
abilities. If you can identify with
them, if you yell from the bottom
of your lungs when they're win
ning. along with 60 thousand

other students and alumni and
fans, you get a sense of exhilara
tion that carries over to ev
erything else you do.
"I don't mean to suggest thai
watching and listening to the
Stanford Marching Band is the
same kind of inspirational ex
perience. hut with any luck, the
hand can also provide a bit of
perspective and a bit of emo
tional release. If you lose yourself
in the music, just as you lose
yourself in what the team is
doing, you can transcend the
drudgery of the academic grind,
and think better thoughts on
Monday morning . . .
"Why don't you buy me an
other beer?"
