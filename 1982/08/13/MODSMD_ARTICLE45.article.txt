# Dollies more than smiles and short skirts
## 
### Heather Millar 
The Dollie room. In it. five Dollies
sideline smiles and high kicks have
become, more lhan the Cardinal color, the
symbol of Stanford athletic fanfare and
camraderie.
Perhaps more than a symbol, today they
are fanfare and comraderie. In variations
on the theme of Dolphin shorts and bright
tank tops, this year's five — Sue Cameron,
Betsy De Palma. Diana Dobbs, Gina
Moreno. Melinda Myers — lounge
around the mattress and pompon covered
floor of their enclave in the Band Shack.
They are still. A rare moment. Yet the
room is still full of their banter which —
though not mindless — rings in the style of
a Go-Go's concert and is reminiscent of
high school cheerleading squads. In the
first few minutes, they take you in. sit you
down. make you comfortable. They know
each other well — four of them were
freshman roommates in Branner — and
they make you feel like they want to know
you well. You can't help but like them. It's
their job. but they want to communicate.
"We got white boots for this fall." they
tell you and go on to describe the outfits
they have for the three seasons that they
will dance at games, promotional events,
and charities.
"We want lots of people to try out for
the Dollies next year," one adds, explain
ing next year's turn-out depends on this
year's example. "A turn of the head can
mean so much . . ."
"The white boots look kind of weird up
close, but out on the field they're great.

The alums like it."
"Omigod. I know." someone says,"I
used lo get such a hard time when I was
trying them on."
"I had to put them on again when I had
them altered." one gasps to you.
"They didn't fit'?!." asks a comrade.
"Oh. they just put a little elastic in the
rim." Sue explains, pinching the strips of
her pompon together to illustrate.
For the last five minutes. Sue had been
running her fingers through that pompon
and staring absently in the mirror that
panels one wall of the Dollie Room. She,
like her four compatriots, has a cute snub
nose, clear skin, a svelte figure. You can
forgive the Dollies a little vanity. It would
take a saint to withstand the once-overs of
thousands of alums and campus men.
The slightly envious glances and oft cat
ty comments of their fellow Stanford
women only reaffirm popular approval.
It's glamorous — "The Dollies get a lot
more glory than a lot of other equally de
serving people." — but none of the five
seem obsessed by having been crowned as
the campus sex symbols. They say they
would like to change the Dollie image this
year, perform at more women's sporting
events and give promotional talks in the
dorms.
"We want to be known asgood dancers,
not as as a bunch of dumb blonds in short
dresses." says Betsy, a former gymnast
and a brunette.
However stereotypically bubbly they
are. this year's Dollies want to be taken se

riously and insist "We're not on Dollie
scholarships; we all got into Stanford all
on our own."
Betsy accents the athletic nature of what
the Dollies do. All of them have a back
ground in dance. Some have experience in
sports, cheerleading and drill as well. "I
have knee problems, and I have to work
out in the weight room every day,"says
Betsy. "Some of the varsity athletes ask
why in the heck a Dollie has to work out?!.
I look at them straight in the eye and reply,
"We. work, hard."
"We put in a lot of time and we're stu
dents too." says Gina who, on the night
before her spring quarter Calculus final,
had to dance in front of Memorial
Auditorium for the showing of The Gradu
ate.
Each Dollie choreographed routines to
four songs over the summer, adding 20
new numbers to the traditional reperatoire
of acts such as William Tell and Alma
Mater. Last spring they worked 16 hours a
week: during the last month of the summer
it approached 40 hours a week. The school
year time committment is impossible to es
timate since even this summer they start
spontaneous practices on their off-hours.
"We love it," they chorus, telling you
how great it is and how they spend hours
on the grass learning new things, some
times as many as two new routines a day.
"Oh' Did we tell you guys this?" Sue
and Gina interject. The subject in a Dollie
conversation changes constantly. "We
were lounging around on the lawn, drink

ing Pepsi, when we saw Dean F : red (Dean
of Undergraduate Admissions Fred
Hargadon) . . . and we wanted to say 'hi'
in a special way. But he turned around,
and said without a smile 'Get to work." "
They all laugh.
Hargadon wants the Dollies to be good
this year. The alums like them. They're
clean cut and cute. It's been a tradition
since 1956.
Before 1956, members of a campus spir
it group dubbed the Rally Committee
donned white sweaters and pleated skirts
to wave red and white pompons at football
games. According to a 1957 Daily, these
girls were not allowed to "prance, kick or
turn." Skirts had to fall below the knee.
In 1956, five somevvhat precocious
women raised the hemline one inch,
changed their traditional dress color to red
and started choreographing routines to
the Stanford Band's music.
A series of 125 women have carried on
the tradition since.
"Some of the older Dollies helped us
learn routines," said Gina. "But it's fun to
try on new styles."
"We want people to know we did some
thing new." They say they want to be able
to set a good example for next year's
Dollies who will debut at the Splendor
party next spring.
"Don't talk about it,"says Gina. "I
don't want to think about it ending. It'>
too sad."
"But you haven't even started!," ex
claims a band member.

a Go-Go's concert and is reminiscent of
high school cheerleading squads. In the
first few minutes, they take you in. sit you
down. make you comfortable. They know
each other well — four of them were
freshman roommates in Branner — and
they make you feel like they want to know
you well. You can't help but like them. It's
their job. but they want to communicate.
"We got white boots for this fall." they
tell you and go on to describe the outfits
they have for the three seasons that they
will dance at games, promotional events,
and charities.
"We want lots of people to try out for
the Dollies next year," one adds, explain
ing next year's turn-out depends on this
year's example. "A turn of the head can
mean so much . . ."
"The white boots look kind of weird up
close, but out on the field they're great.

The alums like it."
"Omigod. I know." someone says,"I
used lo get such a hard time when I was
trying them on."
"I had to put them on again when I had
them altered." one gasps to you.
"They didn't fit'?!." asks a comrade.
"Oh. they just put a little elastic in the
rim." Sue explains, pinching the strips of
her pompon together to illustrate.
For the last five minutes. Sue had been
running her fingers through that pompon
and staring absently in the mirror that
panels one wall of the Dollie Room. She,
like her four compatriots, has a cute snub
nose, clear skin, a svelte figure. You can
forgive the Dollies a little vanity. It would
take a saint to withstand the once-overs of
thousands of alums and campus men.
The slightly envious glances and oft cat
ty comments of their fellow Stanford
women only reaffirm popular approval.
It's glamorous — "The Dollies get a lot
more glory than a lot of other equally de
serving people." — but none of the five
seem obsessed by having been crowned as
the campus sex symbols. They say they
would like to change the Dollie image this
year, perform at more women's sporting
events and give promotional talks in the
dorms.
"We want to be known asgood dancers,
not as as a bunch of dumb blonds in short
dresses." says Betsy, a former gymnast
and a brunette.
However stereotypically bubbly they
are. this year's Dollies want to be taken se

riously and insist "We're not on Dollie
scholarships; we all got into Stanford all
on our own."
Betsy accents the athletic nature of what
the Dollies do. All of them have a back
ground in dance. Some have experience in
sports, cheerleading and drill as well. "I
have knee problems, and I have to work
out in the weight room every day,"says
Betsy. "Some of the varsity athletes ask
why in the heck a Dollie has to work out?!.
I look at them straight in the eye and reply,
"We. work, hard."
"We put in a lot of time and we're stu
dents too." says Gina who, on the night
before her spring quarter Calculus final,
had to dance in front of Memorial
Auditorium for the showing of The Gradu
ate.
Each Dollie choreographed routines to
four songs over the summer, adding 20
new numbers to the traditional reperatoire
of acts such as William Tell and Alma
Mater. Last spring they worked 16 hours a
week: during the last month of the summer
it approached 40 hours a week. The school
year time committment is impossible to es
timate since even this summer they start
spontaneous practices on their off-hours.
"We love it," they chorus, telling you
how great it is and how they spend hours
on the grass learning new things, some
times as many as two new routines a day.
"Oh' Did we tell you guys this?" Sue
and Gina interject. The subject in a Dollie
conversation changes constantly. "We
were lounging around on the lawn, drink

ing Pepsi, when we saw Dean F : red (Dean
of Undergraduate Admissions Fred
Hargadon) . . . and we wanted to say 'hi'
in a special way. But he turned around,
and said without a smile 'Get to work." "
They all laugh.
Hargadon wants the Dollies to be good
this year. The alums like them. They're
clean cut and cute. It's been a tradition
since 1956.
Before 1956, members of a campus spir
it group dubbed the Rally Committee
donned white sweaters and pleated skirts
to wave red and white pompons at football
games. According to a 1957 Daily, these
girls were not allowed to "prance, kick or
turn." Skirts had to fall below the knee.
In 1956, five somevvhat precocious
women raised the hemline one inch,
changed their traditional dress color to red
and started choreographing routines to
the Stanford Band's music.
A series of 125 women have carried on
the tradition since.
"Some of the older Dollies helped us
learn routines," said Gina. "But it's fun to
try on new styles."
"We want people to know we did some
thing new." They say they want to be able
to set a good example for next year's
Dollies who will debut at the Splendor
party next spring.
"Don't talk about it,"says Gina. "I
don't want to think about it ending. It'>
too sad."
"But you haven't even started!," ex
claims a band member.
The Dollie room. In it. five Dollies
sideline smiles and high kicks have
become, more lhan the Cardinal color, the
symbol of Stanford athletic fanfare and
camraderie.
Perhaps more than a symbol, today they
are fanfare and comraderie. In variations
on the theme of Dolphin shorts and bright
tank tops, this year's five — Sue Cameron,
Betsy De Palma. Diana Dobbs, Gina
Moreno. Melinda Myers — lounge
around the mattress and pompon covered
floor of their enclave in the Band Shack.
They are still. A rare moment. Yet the
room is still full of their banter which —
though not mindless — rings in the style of
a Go-Go's concert and is reminiscent of
high school cheerleading squads. In the
first few minutes, they take you in. sit you
down. make you comfortable. They know
