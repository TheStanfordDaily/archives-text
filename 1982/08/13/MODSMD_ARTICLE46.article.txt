## Scouting REPORTS 
### 
BASEBALL
Coach: Mark Marquess

Last Season: 49-18-1, sth in NC A A
Conference: Pacific-10
Home Facility: Sunken Diamond
To put it simply, graduation and the pro draft
were not kind to the Cardinal over the summer.
At Commencement, the Farm bid farewell to
third baseman Loring Davies (.346. 45 RBI),
shortstop Bob DeCosta (.308. 44 RBI. 19 2B).
catcher Bob Hausladen (.301, 8 HR. 53 RBI),
right fielder M ike Tooth man (.258,41 RBI) and
pitchers Mike Sullivan (3-2) and Brian
Mignano (14-6. 68 SO. 13 complete games). It
gets worse. Via the pro draft, the Card said
good-bye to the eligiblitv of senior Steve Bue
chele (.354. 27 RBI) and top recruit Kenny Wil
liams. What's left of the 49-18-1 team, junior
Greg Loren/etti and seniors Mike Dotterer
(.359). Mike Aldrete, Eric Hardgraveand Dar
r\l Stephens, will solidify the outfield and first
base. But Marquess will be searching for a new
catcher, second baseman, short stop and third
baseman come the '83 season. Unlike past
Cardinal clubs, the experienced pitching staff
w ill be the strong point on the team, since it was
not hit hard by the pro draft. Although No. I
hurler Mignano is gone, a strong starting and
relief crew return, including junior Brian
Meyers (8-2) and sophomore sensations David
Harris (7-0, 3.25) and Greg Ballard (7-4, 61 SO
in 91 IP). On offense. Stanford will not hit for
averages as much as it will for power in '83 to go
along with good team speed. Marquess' biggest
chores w ill be filling the infield holes and keep
ing a youthful team away from injuries. A sec
ond consecutive College World Series ap
pearance is not definite, but by the same token
not out of the question.

BASKETBALL, MEN'S
Coach: Tom Davis
Last Season: 7-20
Conference: Paeific-10
Home Facility: Vlaples Pavilion
Although brilliant former Boston College
coach Tom Davis has arrived on the scene, his
debut season may be spoiled by a glaring lack of
talent and depth. Injuries have laid waste to

what might he a decent '82-83 squad and a poor
recruiting year has not improved the situation.
I eg injuries have rendered sophomores Johnny
Rogers, Pac-10 Rookie of the Year in 81-82,
and Roger Lemons "highly doubtful." accord
ing to Davis. Junior forward Hans Wichary is
still recovering from a foot stress fracture that
sidelined him for the better part of last season.
The onl> bright spot in the Cardinal's line-up
seems to be forward center John Revelli. First
Team All-Pac-IO last season as a sophomore,
leading the Card in scoring (16.4) and rebound
ing (8.6). At 6-8, 220 pounds, Revelli appears to
be the Card's only legitimate threat inside, un
less 6-10 senior David Nussbaumcan drasticaly
improve his '81-82 stats — 1.6 ppg and 1.1 rpg.
At guard, junior Keith Jones, who sat out last
season for academic reasons, and returning

c
starter sophomore Steve Brown are question
able as to v\ hether they will be a potent team. Of
the four new recruits, only junior transfer guard
Ricky Lewis and forward Eric Koberlein
should make an immediate contribution.
Nevertheless, the '82-83 campaign should
prove to he an exciting one with Davis at the
helm. Win or lose, slow or fast team, Davis
plans to run and press the entire game. And
with a 57.50 for 18 games student season ticket
package, the team should be fun, let alone <
cheap to watch, although losses will most likely
outnumber wins in the highlv competitive
Pac-10.
BASKETBALL, WOMEN'S
Coach: Dotti McCrea
Last Season: 19-8
Conference: Western Collegiate Athletic
Association (WC'AA)
Home Facility: Maples Pavilion
II coach Dotti McCrea can buy some ex
perience for her backcourt, the Card will once
again field a fine women's basketball team that
could equal or better last season's 19-8 mark
and an berth in the NCAA post-season tour
nament. Guards Angie Paccione, Sarah Miller
and Debbie Gore have all left the Farm via
graduation, leaving the Cardinal with youth in
the backcourt. Nevertheless, in returning for
wards Meg Metzger and Jeanne Ruark Hoffthe
Card has a pair of potential 20-point per game
stars. If Met/ger can stay out of foul trouble,
her nemesis last season, she could very well be
one of the top players on the West Coast, ac
cording to McCrea. To deepen Stanford's front
line even further, McCrea has recruited 6-2 cen

ter Sarah I vans, a player that should make an
immediate contribution. One change in the.
l l )82-83 season from last year will be a bit
slower st\le of play, one that will take full ad
vantage of Met/ger. etc. up front while remov
ing the pressure from the inexperienced guards.
The Cardinal will compete in a much tougher
league this season, the WCAA. It includes the
likes of nationally-ranked UCLA, Long Beach
Stale. \ri/ona State and USC, a potential Final
Lour team.
CROSS COUNTRY, MEN'S
Coach: Mike Tomasello
Last Season: 4th in the Pac-10
Conference: Pacific-10
Home Facility: Stanford Golf Course
A fine misture of returnees and rookies high
light Stanford's men's cross-country team this
fall. Senior Bill Graham and junior Jim Smith
will be the experience on an otherwise youthful
team. Sophomore Brian Pettingill. a national
contender in the mile during track season,
should also occupy one of the five "starting"
spots on the team. Star recruits will be freshmen
Charles Alexander, Mark Schrage, and Ryan
Stoll. If the Card can stay away from injuries to
key runners, it should have the depth to re
alistically compete for the southern Pac-10 title.
CROSS COUNTRY,
WOMEN'S
Coach: Brooks Johnson
I ast Season: 3rd in NCA \
Conference: Western Collegiate Athletic As
sociation (WCAA)
Stanford's women's cross country team can
do nothing but improve in '82. No one gradu
ated from 1981 's squad, while the Card ac
quired some talented recruits in the spring.
Sophomore Regina Jacobs and junior Ellen
Lyons have recovered from injuries that forced
them out of action last year. It all adds up to a
legitimate NCAA title contender. Returnees in

clude team captain Kim Schnurpfeil and Ceci
Hopp, the NCAA's 1982 10,000 and 3.000
meter champions, respectively. Junior Pattisue
Plumer and sophomore Ann Locke both are
potential All-Americans this fall. Coach
Brooks Johnson's prize recruit is Alison Wiley,
who finished 10th at the World Cross Country
Championships in Italy and who should make
the Cardinal a good bet to take the NCAAs this
November. Stanford will compete in the newly
formed WCAA in 1982. probably the most
competitive conference in the nation.
FENCING
Coach: Ed "Buzz" Hurst
Last Season: 5-2, 2nd in NorCal
Conference: Independent
Home Facility: Roble Gymnasium
Rookies and veterans will combine to give
Stanford's fencing team the potential to qualify
for all events in the NCAA Championships this
season.For the men. coach Buz/. Hurst has both
returning players and promising recruits in all
three fencing events — sabers, foils and epees. A
few examples: Senior Howard Cash, ranked
17th in the nation last year, will be backed by
freshman Andy Gorman in the saber division.
In the foil competition, the deepest area for the
Card, sophomore David Sherman heads a list
of experienced players who will battle for start
ing positions with freshman Eliot Chew. Nik
Blcvins, a junior, was 16th in the NCAA and
fourth in the junior Olympics a year ago will be
joined in the epee category by Harvey Kain.
Heading the women's team will be seniors
Pam Henck and Cathy Correa, two players who
starting fencing in classes at Stanford.
Sophomore Alison Reid and recruit Jennifer

Yu will add depth to the squad. The Card
fencers will face their toughest schedule ever
this season because they are independent for the
first time, without a restricting league. Na
tionally-ranked San Jose State, the Cardinal's
rival in fencing, top a list of extremely com
petitive teams.
FIELD HOCKEY
Coach: Onnie Killefer
Last Season: 6-5-3
Conference: NorCal
Home Facility: Roble Field
Coach Onnie Killefer is calling Stanford's
1982 field hockey season "challenging" with
good reason: seven players from last year's
squad will not play for the Farm this fall. The
six graduates include Andrea Welsh, Claudia
Gold and goalie Cecca Freccero. But the sev
enth loss may be the most serious. Junior Patsv
Huntington, a member of the junior national
team last year, will sit out the '82 campaign due
