## Scouting REPORTS 
### 
BASEBALL
Coach: Mark Marquess

Last Season: 49-18-1, sth in NC A A
Conference: Pacific-10
Home Facility: Sunken Diamond
To put it simply, graduation and the pro draft
were not kind to the Cardinal over the summer.
At Commencement, the Farm bid farewell to
third baseman Loring Davies (.346. 45 RBI),
shortstop Bob DeCosta (.308. 44 RBI. 19 2B).
catcher Bob Hausladen (.301, 8 HR. 53 RBI),
right fielder M ike Tooth man (.258,41 RBI) and
pitchers Mike Sullivan (3-2) and Brian
Mignano (14-6. 68 SO. 13 complete games). It
gets worse. Via the pro draft, the Card said
good-bye to the eligiblitv of senior Steve Bue
chele (.354. 27 RBI) and top recruit Kenny Wil
liams. What's left of the 49-18-1 team, junior
Greg Loren/etti and seniors Mike Dotterer
(.359). Mike Aldrete, Eric Hardgraveand Dar
r\l Stephens, will solidify the outfield and first
base. But Marquess will be searching for a new
catcher, second baseman, short stop and third
baseman come the '83 season. Unlike past
Cardinal clubs, the experienced pitching staff
w ill be the strong point on the team, since it was
not hit hard by the pro draft. Although No. I
hurler Mignano is gone, a strong starting and
relief crew return, including junior Brian
Meyers (8-2) and sophomore sensations David
Harris (7-0, 3.25) and Greg Ballard (7-4, 61 SO
in 91 IP). On offense. Stanford will not hit for
averages as much as it will for power in '83 to go
along with good team speed. Marquess' biggest
chores w ill be filling the infield holes and keep
ing a youthful team away from injuries. A sec
ond consecutive College World Series ap
pearance is not definite, but by the same token
not out of the question.

BASKETBALL, MEN'S
Coach: Tom Davis
Last Season: 7-20
Conference: Paeific-10
Home Facility: Vlaples Pavilion
Although brilliant former Boston College
coach Tom Davis has arrived on the scene, his
debut season may be spoiled by a glaring lack of
talent and depth. Injuries have laid waste to

what might he a decent '82-83 squad and a poor
recruiting year has not improved the situation.
I eg injuries have rendered sophomores Johnny
Rogers, Pac-10 Rookie of the Year in 81-82,
and Roger Lemons "highly doubtful." accord
ing to Davis. Junior forward Hans Wichary is
still recovering from a foot stress fracture that
sidelined him for the better part of last season.
The onl> bright spot in the Cardinal's line-up
seems to be forward center John Revelli. First
Team All-Pac-IO last season as a sophomore,
leading the Card in scoring (16.4) and rebound
ing (8.6). At 6-8, 220 pounds, Revelli appears to
be the Card's only legitimate threat inside, un
less 6-10 senior David Nussbaumcan drasticaly
improve his '81-82 stats — 1.6 ppg and 1.1 rpg.
At guard, junior Keith Jones, who sat out last
season for academic reasons, and returning

c
starter sophomore Steve Brown are question
able as to v\ hether they will be a potent team. Of
the four new recruits, only junior transfer guard
Ricky Lewis and forward Eric Koberlein
should make an immediate contribution.
Nevertheless, the '82-83 campaign should
prove to he an exciting one with Davis at the
helm. Win or lose, slow or fast team, Davis
plans to run and press the entire game. And
with a 57.50 for 18 games student season ticket
package, the team should be fun, let alone <
cheap to watch, although losses will most likely
outnumber wins in the highlv competitive
Pac-10.
BASKETBALL, WOMEN'S
Coach: Dotti McCrea
Last Season: 19-8
Conference: Western Collegiate Athletic
Association (WC'AA)
Home Facility: Maples Pavilion
II coach Dotti McCrea can buy some ex
perience for her backcourt, the Card will once
again field a fine women's basketball team that
could equal or better last season's 19-8 mark
and an berth in the NCAA post-season tour
nament. Guards Angie Paccione, Sarah Miller
and Debbie Gore have all left the Farm via
graduation, leaving the Cardinal with youth in
the backcourt. Nevertheless, in returning for
wards Meg Metzger and Jeanne Ruark Hoffthe
Card has a pair of potential 20-point per game
stars. If Met/ger can stay out of foul trouble,
her nemesis last season, she could very well be
one of the top players on the West Coast, ac
cording to McCrea. To deepen Stanford's front
line even further, McCrea has recruited 6-2 cen

ter Sarah I vans, a player that should make an
immediate contribution. One change in the.
l l )82-83 season from last year will be a bit
slower st\le of play, one that will take full ad
vantage of Met/ger. etc. up front while remov
ing the pressure from the inexperienced guards.
The Cardinal will compete in a much tougher
league this season, the WCAA. It includes the
likes of nationally-ranked UCLA, Long Beach
Stale. \ri/ona State and USC, a potential Final
Lour team.
CROSS COUNTRY, MEN'S
Coach: Mike Tomasello
Last Season: 4th in the Pac-10
Conference: Pacific-10
Home Facility: Stanford Golf Course
A fine misture of returnees and rookies high
light Stanford's men's cross-country team this
fall. Senior Bill Graham and junior Jim Smith
will be the experience on an otherwise youthful
team. Sophomore Brian Pettingill. a national
contender in the mile during track season,
should also occupy one of the five "starting"
spots on the team. Star recruits will be freshmen
Charles Alexander, Mark Schrage, and Ryan
Stoll. If the Card can stay away from injuries to
key runners, it should have the depth to re
alistically compete for the southern Pac-10 title.
CROSS COUNTRY,
WOMEN'S
Coach: Brooks Johnson
I ast Season: 3rd in NCA \
Conference: Western Collegiate Athletic As
sociation (WCAA)
Stanford's women's cross country team can
do nothing but improve in '82. No one gradu
ated from 1981 's squad, while the Card ac
quired some talented recruits in the spring.
Sophomore Regina Jacobs and junior Ellen
Lyons have recovered from injuries that forced
them out of action last year. It all adds up to a
legitimate NCAA title contender. Returnees in

clude team captain Kim Schnurpfeil and Ceci
Hopp, the NCAA's 1982 10,000 and 3.000
meter champions, respectively. Junior Pattisue
Plumer and sophomore Ann Locke both are
potential All-Americans this fall. Coach
Brooks Johnson's prize recruit is Alison Wiley,
who finished 10th at the World Cross Country
Championships in Italy and who should make
the Cardinal a good bet to take the NCAAs this
November. Stanford will compete in the newly
formed WCAA in 1982. probably the most
competitive conference in the nation.
FENCING
Coach: Ed "Buzz" Hurst
Last Season: 5-2, 2nd in NorCal
Conference: Independent
Home Facility: Roble Gymnasium
Rookies and veterans will combine to give
Stanford's fencing team the potential to qualify
for all events in the NCAA Championships this
season.For the men. coach Buz/. Hurst has both
returning players and promising recruits in all
three fencing events — sabers, foils and epees. A
few examples: Senior Howard Cash, ranked
17th in the nation last year, will be backed by
freshman Andy Gorman in the saber division.
In the foil competition, the deepest area for the
Card, sophomore David Sherman heads a list
of experienced players who will battle for start
ing positions with freshman Eliot Chew. Nik
Blcvins, a junior, was 16th in the NCAA and
fourth in the junior Olympics a year ago will be
joined in the epee category by Harvey Kain.
Heading the women's team will be seniors
Pam Henck and Cathy Correa, two players who
starting fencing in classes at Stanford.
Sophomore Alison Reid and recruit Jennifer

Yu will add depth to the squad. The Card
fencers will face their toughest schedule ever
this season because they are independent for the
first time, without a restricting league. Na
tionally-ranked San Jose State, the Cardinal's
rival in fencing, top a list of extremely com
petitive teams.
FIELD HOCKEY
Coach: Onnie Killefer
Last Season: 6-5-3
Conference: NorCal
Home Facility: Roble Field
Coach Onnie Killefer is calling Stanford's
1982 field hockey season "challenging" with
good reason: seven players from last year's
squad will not play for the Farm this fall. The
six graduates include Andrea Welsh, Claudia
Gold and goalie Cecca Freccero. But the sev
enth loss may be the most serious. Junior Patsv
Huntington, a member of the junior national
team last year, will sit out the '82 campaign due

Keller Strother/Daily
to an injury. That leaves the Cardinal to rest its
hopes on senior Becky Howell, both an ex
cellent defender and scorer. Besides Howell,
Killeler's troops will consist of team players
rather than outstanding individuals. Although
Stanford's tough schedule includes San Jose
Stale, Cal, UOP and fourth ranked Long Beach
State, improvement because of summer train
ing should help the Card meet the challenge.

FOOTBALL
Coach: Paul Wiggin
Last Season: 4-7
Conference: Pacific-10
Home Facility: Stanford Stadium
Stanford's always unpredictable football
team will enter the football season confronting
fans with yet another mystery. Suffering a dis
appointing 4-7 season last year, the team hopes
to become a part of the Rose Howl picture. Sen
ior All-America quarterback and Heisman
Trophy candidate John Elway returns and will
lead w hat should be one of the nations most po
tent passing attacks. Vincent White replaces the
irreplacable Darrin Nelson in the halfback
position. White, who runs like a Nelson clone,
is expected to keep the running game strong and
could he one of the surprises in the Pac-10. Jun
ior receiver Mike Tolliver leads an experienced
receiving crew and Chris Dressel returns for his
fourth year at the tight end position. The de
fense which ranked last in the Pac-10 against the
pass last year will try to get back on track with
All-America candidate Vaughn Williams
switching from strong to free safety this year.
Other defensive standouts include sophomore
noseguard Terry Jackson, junior tackle John
Bergren and sophomore linebacker Garin Ver
is. Junior Mark Harmon returns for the kicking
duties and should rank as one of the nations
best kickers. Still, question marks remain. Al
though the offense should be one of the nation's
best, the defense is still untested and depth is a
problem, especially on the offensive line.

GOLF, MEN'S
Coach: Tim Schaaf
Last Season: Sth in Pac-10
Conference: Pacific-10
Home Facility: Stanford Golf Course
Men's golf coach Tim Schaaf will be examin
ing swings and scorecards closer than ever
before come fall practice. Last year's regulars
Tad Buchanan, David Gamesand Neil Rob
inson have graduated, leaving the starting spots
on the Card's golf roster a wide open race. At
least ten individuals will vie for a postion on the
six-man starting team with one possible excep
tion — Josh Mondry. The Card sophomore was
Stanford's sole representative in the NCAA
championships while leading Stanford with a
74.X stroke average during the spring. The top
contenders for the other five places are senior
John Scanlon, juniors Tim Robinson, Lanny
Sawchuck, Lew Dickey and Doug Thompson
and sophomore Scott Erickson, all of which

saw action last season. Freshmen Carl Wagner
and Don Walsworth may also challenge for
playing time. After a decent showing last
fall.the male linksters faltered in the spring,
eventually taking fifth at the Pac-10 cham
pionships: a third place finish would have quali
fied the Card for the NCAAs. But if Shaaf can
make heads of tails this fall, the Card very well
may he in the thick of things come spring.

GOLF, WOMEN'S
Coach: Tim Baldwin
Last Season: 6th in NCAA
Conference: Western Collegiate Athletic n
Association (WCAA)
Home Facility: Stanford Golf Course
Stanford's women's golf team should be
about the same this season as last season, a
compliment. Under the fourth year tutelage of
mentor Tim Baldwin, the Card has landed two
talented recruits to fill the hole left by the gradu
ation of Lori Castillo and Debbie Barbario.
Kathy Kostas, Golf Magazine's No.I junior
female golfer in the country, and Julie
Carmichael will arrive on the scene this fall.
Kostas will team with sophomore standout
Diane Nixon, junior Kathy Nino, and senior
Joanne Pacillo to give the Card a NCAA con
tending squad with only one question mark —
depth. Hopefully, either Carmichael and senior
Roxy Gumlia will ablely fill the fifth spot on the
roster and provide the Cardinal with
'"'that missing dimension. Last season, Stanford
got off to a painfully slow start, one that threat
ened their even qualifying for the NCAA
Championships, which were held on the Stan
ford Golf Course last spring. But strong outings
late in the season, especially by Nixon, enabled
Baldwin and Co. not only to qualify for the
NCAAs, but place sixth though seeded 13th.
The Card's biggest fall tournament is the Stan
lord Fall Intercollegiate, an event it won two
years ago.

GYMNASTICS, MEN'S
Coach: Sadao Hamada
Last Season: sth in Pac-10
Conference: Pac-10
Home Facility: Maples Pavilion
An excellent recruiting year and unproved re
turning athletes make up what coach Sadao
Hamada calls the "strongest year ever" for the
Stanford men's gymnastics program. Seniors
Kirk Druey and Brian Nelson and junior Jim
Campanelli form the basis of the Hamada's
eleventh Cardinal team. Freshmen recruits Jon
Levy and Gary Smith will provide the Card
with needed depth. Although all-arounders,
both Levy and Smith specialize in the floor ex
ercise: Levy also has high marks in the rings,
while Smith excels at vaulting. If injuries do not
factor in the team's performance as they did last
year. Hamada believes the Card has a realistic
chance at the qualifying for the NCAAs.
GYMNASTICS, WOMEN'S
Coach: TBA
Last Season: 9-3, NorC'al champs
Conference: Western Collegiate Athletic
Association (WCAA)
Home Facility: Maples Pavilion
The 1982-83 version of Stanford's women's
gymnastics squad will not be all Merilyn Chap
man as much as her amazing stats make it ap
pear. The nationally-ranked junior will have a
strong supporting cast this season featuring a
mixture of returning and incoming gymnasts.
Top Card recruit is all-arounder Dell
Wilkinson will be joined by three promising
walk-ons. Senior Karen Hall will return in
'82-83. after redshirting last year. In '80-81.
Hall's all-around average of 34.68 was second
only to Chapman's. Senior Kim Strauss and
sophomore Angie Barnes will also return, pro
viding needed experience and depth. Ihe
Cardinal was not able to reach its potential last
season because of coaching complications. But
if the new women's coach can keep things under
control, 1982-83 could prove to be the first year
that Stanford can send both its gymnastics
teams to the NCAA championships.

Last Season: Ist in Pac-10, 3rd in NCAA
Conference: Pacific-10
Home Facility: DeGuerre Pool
Its NCAA title or bust for Stanford's men's
swim team in 19X2-83. After gaining valuable
experience at last spring's NCAA Cham
pionships. theclose-knit squad has all the ele
ments of a championship team — talent depth,
maturity and chemistry. Coach Skip Kenney
lost just two players to graduation from I9S2'*-
Pac-10 champs and has picked up two worthy
replacements. I reshman John Moffet is the top
swimming prospect in the nation while diver
Tom Rothenbucher is No. I or No. 2. depend
ing on whom you talk to. Junior Ricky Bodor
has recovered from last season's bout with
pnemonia and John Simons is another year
away from his season-cancelling injury of
'80-81. Joining those four w ill be last year's fan
tastic freshmen — Dave Bottom (American rec
ord holder in 100 back). Carter Cast. Jon Den
ny and John Fngs — as well as upperclassmen
Todd Lincoln. David Sims. Bari Wieck and
Sam Worden. The backstroke, breaststroke
and individual medleys and al three relays will
all be the Cardinal's strongest events; if a
weakness exists, it's in the sprints, specifically
the 50 and 100 free. Sprints or no sprints, the
only team that should have the ability to stop
Stanford from winning its first NCAA title is
defending NCAA champ Texas. The Long
horns will join the Cardinal and the other top
four teams in the nation in late January at SVIU
for a meet sponsored by the Dallas Morn
ing Aews. Key home dual meets for Stanford
will he against CSC and 19X2 NCAA runner-up
UCLA. But if the Card stays healthy, Kenney
and Co. are aiming for an undefeated season, a
second consecutive Pac-10 Championship and
a NCAA title. Nothing more, nothing less.

terflier Pattv Gavin The overall effect? A swim
team with talent and depth in all events includ

petition will be tougher in the'B2-83 campiagn.
The NCAA will include powers like Texas,UC
Berkeley and Southern Illinois this year since
the merger of the NCAA and the AIAW. Key
home meets for the Cardinal will be against Cal,
USC. and UCL.A while the biggest road contest
pits Stanford against 1982 AIAW champ Texas.

TENNIS, MEN S

strong teams in 'S3 and attempt to ruin what

h\ Stanford standards.
TENNIS, WOMEN'S
. Coach: Frank Brennan
Last Season: 20-0, NCAA Champs
Conference: Independent
Home Facility: Stanford Tennis Stadium
An undefeated season and a NCAA cham
pionship w ill be hard to top for the Cardinal in
IMS 3. Number one player and NCAA singles
champ Alycia Moulton and supersub Sue
Rasmussen have graduated. Number three
kateGompert, the country's top junior in I9SO,
has followed in the footsteps of John McLnroe
and turned pro after just her freshman year on
the I arm. (That's the price coach Frank Bren
nan puys for recruiting too well.) However, the
remnants of last season's "once a decade" team
plus a pair of recruits will make up what should
at least he another NCAA title contender. For
Brennan. finding dependable No. 2 and No. 3
players and potent doubles teams will be his
biggest problem. Junior Elise Burgin will fiteas-

Is . r. w m '» '.it , ~v ! —sosi.re'i i*
that she stands an excellent chance at winning
the NCAA individual crown in '83. But whether
sophomore Linda Gates, junior Michelle Weiss
and senior Caryn Copeland, Brennan's No. 4.
5. (i combo last year, can move up successfully is
questionable. Junior Alison Hardy and
freshmen Alyee Werdcl and Jackie Joseph
should also see singles action. UCLA, USC and
Trinity will again have extremely competitive
squads in '83. making 20-0 and a NCAA title a
most difficult feat to repeat.

TRACK, MEN'S
Coach: Brooks Johnson
Last Season: 6-6
Conference: Pacific-10
Home Facility: Stanford Stadium
The key to Stanford's men's track team in
148.1 is the development of the more youthful
members of this year's squad. Freshmen like
J.P. Holland. Brian Pettingill. Shaun Pickering,
Ciarin Veris and Freddy Williams give the
Cardinal a base from which to build future
teams. And Stanford can do nothing but im
pro\e on last season's tenth place finish in the
highly competitive Pac-10 —a conference that
featured six of the nation's lop ten dual meet
teams at the beginning of the 1981 campaign.
Holland is a triple and long jumper who also
contributes in the relays, while Pettingill was
perhaps the best freshman distance middle dis
tance runner in the country last spring. Pick
ering and Veris. a starting football player in the
tall, .ire national contenders in the hammer
throw and the shot put. respectively. Hopefully,
coach Brooks Johnson will be able to find some
support for Williams in the sprints, by far the
Card's weakest track department. Though the
Card has a good foundation on which to build,
it is still two or three solid recruiting years away
from being a serious Pac-10 contender.

TRACK, WOMEN'S
Coach: Brooks Johnson
Last Season: 8-5
Conference: Western Collegiate Athletic
Association (WCAAI
Home Facility: Stanford Stadium
In the fall, it's cross-country, but in the
spring, it's truck season for a quintet of long dis
tance Cardinal runners. The fab five includes
nationally-ranked freshmen Ceci Hopp and
Sloan Burton, sophomores I lien Lyons and
Pattisue Plumber and junior Kim Schnurpfeil.
However, in 19X2. Burton's season was can
celled due to a foot injury and the full prowess
of Stanford's distance runners was not on ex
hibition. Besides the cross-country/trackers,
theCard will havea pair of returning stars in the
weight events. Carol Cady and Mary Osborne.
Stanford women's 800 meter record holder Re
gina Jacobs will only be a sophomore this sea
son while sprinter and jumper Pam Donald has
yet another year of elgibility. As is the case with
the men's team, the women will lack depth, let
alone talent, in the sprints. But because of the
fact that the Lady Card tracksters lost no one to
graduation, they can do nothing but improve
and come away with a fine showing in the brand
new WCAA.
VOLLEYBALL, MEN'S
Coach: Fred Sturm
Last Season: 7-18
Conference: California Intercollegiate Vol
leyball Association (OVA)
Home Facility: Maples Pavilion
Even with a year of expereince under their
belts. Stanford's men's volleyball team again
will be young. The team's sole senior, Mark
Reagan, will combine with sophomores Craig

Lauchner and Dan Parr and freshman Jon
Root, one of the top recruits in the nation. The
latter three were members of the ten-man Na
tional Sports Festival West team over the sum
mer. Parr. Reagan and Root are all middle
blockers and thus Parr or Root might be moved
to an outside hitter position. The Cardinal will
try to gain a berth in the NCAA regionals in
19X3. but first they must deal with the CIV A. by
far the toughest conference in the country.
Teams like UCLA, USC and UCSB. all with
plenty of talent to win it all, are just a few ex
amples of what the Card will face. Though
Stanford w ill not have a tremendous amount of
depth, avoiding key injuries will keep it afloat in
the CIVA.
VOLLEYBALL, WOMEN'S
Coach: Fred Sturm
Last Season: 32-14, sth in NCAA
Conference: Western Collegiate Athletic
Association (WCAA)
Home Facility: Maples Pavilion
Fver since gaining varsity status six years
ago, women's volleyball at Stanford has steadi
ly improved. Unfortunately, the Card may have
peaked last season with a 32-14 record and a
fifth place NCAA finish. After losing three

starters, coach Fred Sturm is looking for
players to fill in as well as ways to win in the
Card's competitive new league, the WCAA,
touted as the top conference in the nation. Sen
iors Deanna Boyette, J.J. Gearhart and Kisi
I lame provide Stanford with experience while
K ari Rush Julie Baker, Margaret Grove. Susan
Compton. Brandace Hope, Lisa Murphv.
Diedra Dvorak and Jodv Freeman give the
Cardinal depth. One of the top recruits in the
country. Kim Oden, who played in the National
Sports Festival last summer, will also challenge
lor a starting role. Though depth should not he
a factor, finding a potent starting unit will. The
talent is there, hut the chemistry is missing. The
WCAA should prove to he a big test for Sturm's
troops, with a line-up that one would only ex
pect to find at the NCAA Championships. Top
20 teams like UCLA and USC head the new
women's conference, making the Card's sched
ule much more demanding than in past seasons.
WATER POLO
Coach: Dante Dettamanti
Last Season: 31-0, NCAA champs
Conference: Pacific-10
Home Facility: DeGuerre Pool
An NCAA championship and a 31-0 record
will he hard to duplicate in 1982, but coach
Dante Dettamanti is not selling his team short
even though a big chunk last year's team fell
pre\ to graduation. Senior John Bergeson.who
last year was the NCAA's most prolific goal
scorer. will lead the charge that could possibly
end in the Card's fifth NCAA crown in seven
years. Six-year coach Dettamanti sees his '82
squad not as the best in the nation as it was a
year ago, but as a "contender."
UC Irvine. UCLA, Cal and USC pose as the
Card's four toughest opponents on a rugged
West Coast schedule, one that most likely will
take it toll in the form of defeats. But if the

team's question marks answer themselves
positively over the course of the season, Stan
lord could escape with less than five losses.
WRESTLING
Coach: Chris Horpel
Last Season: 5-6, sth in Pac-10
Conference: Pacific-10
Home Facility: Maples Pavilion
Alter being reinstated as a Stanford varsity
sport just three years ago, the Card wrestling
team has a chance at being a Pac-10 contender
in the 19X2-83 campaign. Coach Chris Horpel
will rest his hopes on fifth-year senior Doug
Perkins, junior I om Mullen and sophomore fcd
Katz. Perkins placed second in the Pac-10 last
season and is an early favorite to capture the
league title in the 177-pound weight class this
year. Stanford's strength in '82-83 will again lie
in the upper weights, while a lack of depth is the
biggest problem the Card will wrestle this sea
son. The Pac-10 will feature a pair of national
powerhouses in the "82-83 season: Arizona
State and Oregon. San Jose State will also be a
thorn in Stanford's schedule, one that is much
tougher than the easier Nor Cal schedule that
the Cardinal could play in place of the Pac-10.
I he ( ard will face its Pac-10 foes in a dual-meet
format for the first time ir) Stanford history.

BASEBALL
Coach: Mark Marquess

Last Season: 49-18-1, sth in NC A A
Conference: Pacific-10
Home Facility: Sunken Diamond
To put it simply, graduation and the pro draft
were not kind to the Cardinal over the summer.
At Commencement, the Farm bid farewell to
third baseman Loring Davies (.346. 45 RBI),
shortstop Bob DeCosta (.308. 44 RBI. 19 2B).
catcher Bob Hausladen (.301, 8 HR. 53 RBI),
right fielder M ike Tooth man (.258,41 RBI) and
pitchers Mike Sullivan (3-2) and Brian
Mignano (14-6. 68 SO. 13 complete games). It
gets worse. Via the pro draft, the Card said
good-bye to the eligiblitv of senior Steve Bue
chele (.354. 27 RBI) and top recruit Kenny Wil
liams. What's left of the 49-18-1 team, junior
Greg Loren/etti and seniors Mike Dotterer
(.359). Mike Aldrete, Eric Hardgraveand Dar
r\l Stephens, will solidify the outfield and first
base. But Marquess will be searching for a new
catcher, second baseman, short stop and third
baseman come the '83 season. Unlike past
Cardinal clubs, the experienced pitching staff
w ill be the strong point on the team, since it was
not hit hard by the pro draft. Although No. I
hurler Mignano is gone, a strong starting and
relief crew return, including junior Brian
Meyers (8-2) and sophomore sensations David
Harris (7-0, 3.25) and Greg Ballard (7-4, 61 SO
in 91 IP). On offense. Stanford will not hit for
averages as much as it will for power in '83 to go
along with good team speed. Marquess' biggest
chores w ill be filling the infield holes and keep
ing a youthful team away from injuries. A sec
ond consecutive College World Series ap
pearance is not definite, but by the same token
not out of the question.

BASKETBALL, MEN'S
Coach: Tom Davis
Last Season: 7-20
Conference: Paeific-10
Home Facility: Vlaples Pavilion
Although brilliant former Boston College
coach Tom Davis has arrived on the scene, his
debut season may be spoiled by a glaring lack of
talent and depth. Injuries have laid waste to

what might he a decent '82-83 squad and a poor
recruiting year has not improved the situation.
I eg injuries have rendered sophomores Johnny
Rogers, Pac-10 Rookie of the Year in 81-82,
and Roger Lemons "highly doubtful." accord
ing to Davis. Junior forward Hans Wichary is
still recovering from a foot stress fracture that
sidelined him for the better part of last season.
The onl> bright spot in the Cardinal's line-up
seems to be forward center John Revelli. First
Team All-Pac-IO last season as a sophomore,
leading the Card in scoring (16.4) and rebound
ing (8.6). At 6-8, 220 pounds, Revelli appears to
be the Card's only legitimate threat inside, un
less 6-10 senior David Nussbaumcan drasticaly
improve his '81-82 stats — 1.6 ppg and 1.1 rpg.
At guard, junior Keith Jones, who sat out last
season for academic reasons, and returning

c
starter sophomore Steve Brown are question
able as to v\ hether they will be a potent team. Of
the four new recruits, only junior transfer guard
Ricky Lewis and forward Eric Koberlein
should make an immediate contribution.
Nevertheless, the '82-83 campaign should
prove to he an exciting one with Davis at the
helm. Win or lose, slow or fast team, Davis
plans to run and press the entire game. And
with a 57.50 for 18 games student season ticket
package, the team should be fun, let alone <
cheap to watch, although losses will most likely
outnumber wins in the highlv competitive
Pac-10.
BASKETBALL, WOMEN'S
Coach: Dotti McCrea
Last Season: 19-8
Conference: Western Collegiate Athletic
Association (WC'AA)
Home Facility: Maples Pavilion
II coach Dotti McCrea can buy some ex
perience for her backcourt, the Card will once
again field a fine women's basketball team that
could equal or better last season's 19-8 mark
and an berth in the NCAA post-season tour
nament. Guards Angie Paccione, Sarah Miller
and Debbie Gore have all left the Farm via
graduation, leaving the Cardinal with youth in
the backcourt. Nevertheless, in returning for
wards Meg Metzger and Jeanne Ruark Hoffthe
Card has a pair of potential 20-point per game
stars. If Met/ger can stay out of foul trouble,
her nemesis last season, she could very well be
one of the top players on the West Coast, ac
cording to McCrea. To deepen Stanford's front
line even further, McCrea has recruited 6-2 cen

ter Sarah I vans, a player that should make an
immediate contribution. One change in the.
l l )82-83 season from last year will be a bit
slower st\le of play, one that will take full ad
vantage of Met/ger. etc. up front while remov
ing the pressure from the inexperienced guards.
The Cardinal will compete in a much tougher
league this season, the WCAA. It includes the
likes of nationally-ranked UCLA, Long Beach
Stale. \ri/ona State and USC, a potential Final
Lour team.
CROSS COUNTRY, MEN'S
Coach: Mike Tomasello
Last Season: 4th in the Pac-10
Conference: Pacific-10
Home Facility: Stanford Golf Course
A fine misture of returnees and rookies high
light Stanford's men's cross-country team this
fall. Senior Bill Graham and junior Jim Smith
will be the experience on an otherwise youthful
team. Sophomore Brian Pettingill. a national
contender in the mile during track season,
should also occupy one of the five "starting"
spots on the team. Star recruits will be freshmen
Charles Alexander, Mark Schrage, and Ryan
Stoll. If the Card can stay away from injuries to
key runners, it should have the depth to re
alistically compete for the southern Pac-10 title.
CROSS COUNTRY,
WOMEN'S
Coach: Brooks Johnson
I ast Season: 3rd in NCA \
Conference: Western Collegiate Athletic As
sociation (WCAA)
Stanford's women's cross country team can
do nothing but improve in '82. No one gradu
ated from 1981 's squad, while the Card ac
quired some talented recruits in the spring.
Sophomore Regina Jacobs and junior Ellen
Lyons have recovered from injuries that forced
them out of action last year. It all adds up to a
legitimate NCAA title contender. Returnees in

clude team captain Kim Schnurpfeil and Ceci
Hopp, the NCAA's 1982 10,000 and 3.000
meter champions, respectively. Junior Pattisue
Plumer and sophomore Ann Locke both are
potential All-Americans this fall. Coach
Brooks Johnson's prize recruit is Alison Wiley,
who finished 10th at the World Cross Country
Championships in Italy and who should make
the Cardinal a good bet to take the NCAAs this
November. Stanford will compete in the newly
formed WCAA in 1982. probably the most
competitive conference in the nation.
FENCING
Coach: Ed "Buzz" Hurst
Last Season: 5-2, 2nd in NorCal
Conference: Independent
Home Facility: Roble Gymnasium
Rookies and veterans will combine to give
Stanford's fencing team the potential to qualify
for all events in the NCAA Championships this
season.For the men. coach Buz/. Hurst has both
returning players and promising recruits in all
three fencing events — sabers, foils and epees. A
few examples: Senior Howard Cash, ranked
17th in the nation last year, will be backed by
freshman Andy Gorman in the saber division.
In the foil competition, the deepest area for the
Card, sophomore David Sherman heads a list
of experienced players who will battle for start
ing positions with freshman Eliot Chew. Nik
Blcvins, a junior, was 16th in the NCAA and
fourth in the junior Olympics a year ago will be
joined in the epee category by Harvey Kain.
Heading the women's team will be seniors
Pam Henck and Cathy Correa, two players who
starting fencing in classes at Stanford.
Sophomore Alison Reid and recruit Jennifer

Yu will add depth to the squad. The Card
fencers will face their toughest schedule ever
this season because they are independent for the
first time, without a restricting league. Na
tionally-ranked San Jose State, the Cardinal's
rival in fencing, top a list of extremely com
petitive teams.
FIELD HOCKEY
Coach: Onnie Killefer
Last Season: 6-5-3
Conference: NorCal
Home Facility: Roble Field
Coach Onnie Killefer is calling Stanford's
1982 field hockey season "challenging" with
good reason: seven players from last year's
squad will not play for the Farm this fall. The
six graduates include Andrea Welsh, Claudia
Gold and goalie Cecca Freccero. But the sev
enth loss may be the most serious. Junior Patsv
Huntington, a member of the junior national
team last year, will sit out the '82 campaign due

to an injury. That leaves the Cardinal to rest its
hopes on senior Becky Howell, both an ex
cellent defender and scorer. Besides Howell,
Killeler's troops will consist of team players
rather than outstanding individuals. Although
Stanford's tough schedule includes San Jose
Stale, Cal, UOP and fourth ranked Long Beach
State, improvement because of summer train
ing should help the Card meet the challenge.

FOOTBALL
Coach: Paul Wiggin
Last Season: 4-7
Conference: Pacific-10
Home Facility: Stanford Stadium
Stanford's always unpredictable football
team will enter the football season confronting
fans with yet another mystery. Suffering a dis
appointing 4-7 season last year, the team hopes
to become a part of the Rose Howl picture. Sen
ior All-America quarterback and Heisman
Trophy candidate John Elway returns and will
lead w hat should be one of the nations most po
tent passing attacks. Vincent White replaces the
irreplacable Darrin Nelson in the halfback
position. White, who runs like a Nelson clone,
is expected to keep the running game strong and
could he one of the surprises in the Pac-10. Jun
ior receiver Mike Tolliver leads an experienced
receiving crew and Chris Dressel returns for his
fourth year at the tight end position. The de
fense which ranked last in the Pac-10 against the
pass last year will try to get back on track with
All-America candidate Vaughn Williams
switching from strong to free safety this year.
Other defensive standouts include sophomore
noseguard Terry Jackson, junior tackle John
Bergren and sophomore linebacker Garin Ver
is. Junior Mark Harmon returns for the kicking
duties and should rank as one of the nations
best kickers. Still, question marks remain. Al
though the offense should be one of the nation's
best, the defense is still untested and depth is a
problem, especially on the offensive line.

GOLF, MEN'S
Coach: Tim Schaaf
Last Season: Sth in Pac-10
Conference: Pacific-10
Home Facility: Stanford Golf Course
Men's golf coach Tim Schaaf will be examin
ing swings and scorecards closer than ever
before come fall practice. Last year's regulars
Tad Buchanan, David Gamesand Neil Rob
inson have graduated, leaving the starting spots
on the Card's golf roster a wide open race. At
least ten individuals will vie for a postion on the
six-man starting team with one possible excep
tion — Josh Mondry. The Card sophomore was
Stanford's sole representative in the NCAA
championships while leading Stanford with a
74.X stroke average during the spring. The top
contenders for the other five places are senior
John Scanlon, juniors Tim Robinson, Lanny
Sawchuck, Lew Dickey and Doug Thompson
and sophomore Scott Erickson, all of which

saw action last season. Freshmen Carl Wagner
and Don Walsworth may also challenge for
playing time. After a decent showing last
fall.the male linksters faltered in the spring,
eventually taking fifth at the Pac-10 cham
pionships: a third place finish would have quali
fied the Card for the NCAAs. But if Shaaf can
make heads of tails this fall, the Card very well
may he in the thick of things come spring.

GOLF, WOMEN'S
Coach: Tim Baldwin
Last Season: 6th in NCAA
Conference: Western Collegiate Athletic n
Association (WCAA)
Home Facility: Stanford Golf Course
Stanford's women's golf team should be
about the same this season as last season, a
compliment. Under the fourth year tutelage of
mentor Tim Baldwin, the Card has landed two
talented recruits to fill the hole left by the gradu
ation of Lori Castillo and Debbie Barbario.
Kathy Kostas, Golf Magazine's No.I junior
female golfer in the country, and Julie
Carmichael will arrive on the scene this fall.
Kostas will team with sophomore standout
Diane Nixon, junior Kathy Nino, and senior
Joanne Pacillo to give the Card a NCAA con
tending squad with only one question mark —
depth. Hopefully, either Carmichael and senior
Roxy Gumlia will ablely fill the fifth spot on the
roster and provide the Cardinal with
'"'that missing dimension. Last season, Stanford
got off to a painfully slow start, one that threat
ened their even qualifying for the NCAA
Championships, which were held on the Stan
ford Golf Course last spring. But strong outings
late in the season, especially by Nixon, enabled
Baldwin and Co. not only to qualify for the
NCAAs, but place sixth though seeded 13th.
The Card's biggest fall tournament is the Stan
lord Fall Intercollegiate, an event it won two
years ago.

GYMNASTICS, MEN'S
Coach: Sadao Hamada
Last Season: sth in Pac-10
Conference: Pac-10
Home Facility: Maples Pavilion
An excellent recruiting year and unproved re
turning athletes make up what coach Sadao
Hamada calls the "strongest year ever" for the
Stanford men's gymnastics program. Seniors
Kirk Druey and Brian Nelson and junior Jim
Campanelli form the basis of the Hamada's
eleventh Cardinal team. Freshmen recruits Jon
Levy and Gary Smith will provide the Card
with needed depth. Although all-arounders,
both Levy and Smith specialize in the floor ex
ercise: Levy also has high marks in the rings,
while Smith excels at vaulting. If injuries do not
factor in the team's performance as they did last
year. Hamada believes the Card has a realistic
chance at the qualifying for the NCAAs.
GYMNASTICS, WOMEN'S
Coach: TBA
Last Season: 9-3, NorC'al champs
Conference: Western Collegiate Athletic
Association (WCAA)
Home Facility: Maples Pavilion
The 1982-83 version of Stanford's women's
gymnastics squad will not be all Merilyn Chap
man as much as her amazing stats make it ap
pear. The nationally-ranked junior will have a
strong supporting cast this season featuring a
mixture of returning and incoming gymnasts.
Top Card recruit is all-arounder Dell
Wilkinson will be joined by three promising
walk-ons. Senior Karen Hall will return in
'82-83. after redshirting last year. In '80-81.
Hall's all-around average of 34.68 was second
only to Chapman's. Senior Kim Strauss and
sophomore Angie Barnes will also return, pro
viding needed experience and depth. Ihe
Cardinal was not able to reach its potential last
season because of coaching complications. But
if the new women's coach can keep things under
control, 1982-83 could prove to be the first year
that Stanford can send both its gymnastics
teams to the NCAA championships.

Todd Lincoln. David Sims. Bari Wieck and
Sam Worden. The backstroke, breaststroke
and individual medleys and al three relays will
all be the Cardinal's strongest events; if a
weakness exists, it's in the sprints, specifically
the 50 and 100 free. Sprints or no sprints, the
only team that should have the ability to stop
Stanford from winning its first NCAA title is
defending NCAA champ Texas. The Long
horns will join the Cardinal and the other top
four teams in the nation in late January at SVIU
for a meet sponsored by the Dallas Morn

TRACK, MEN'S
Coach: Brooks Johnson
Last Season: 6-6
Conference: Pacific-10
Home Facility: Stanford Stadium
The key to Stanford's men's track team in
148.1 is the development of the more youthful
members of this year's squad. Freshmen like
J.P. Holland. Brian Pettingill. Shaun Pickering,
Ciarin Veris and Freddy Williams give the
Cardinal a base from which to build future
teams. And Stanford can do nothing but im
pro\e on last season's tenth place finish in the
highly competitive Pac-10 —a conference that
featured six of the nation's lop ten dual meet
teams at the beginning of the 1981 campaign.
Holland is a triple and long jumper who also
contributes in the relays, while Pettingill was
perhaps the best freshman distance middle dis
tance runner in the country last spring. Pick
ering and Veris. a starting football player in the
tall, .ire national contenders in the hammer
throw and the shot put. respectively. Hopefully,
coach Brooks Johnson will be able to find some
support for Williams in the sprints, by far the
Card's weakest track department. Though the
Card has a good foundation on which to build,
it is still two or three solid recruiting years away
from being a serious Pac-10 contender.

TRACK, WOMEN'S

nationally-ranked freshmen Ceci Hopp and
Sloan Burton, sophomores I lien Lyons and
Pattisue Plumber and junior Kim Schnurpfeil.
However, in 19X2. Burton's season was can
celled due to a foot injury and the full prowess
of Stanford's distance runners was not on ex

theCard will havea pair of returning stars in the
weight events. Carol Cady and Mary Osborne.
Stanford women's 800 meter record holder Re
gina Jacobs will only be a sophomore this sea
son while sprinter and jumper Pam Donald has
yet another year of elgibility. As is the case with
the men's team, the women will lack depth, let
alone talent, in the sprints. But because of the
fact that the Lady Card tracksters lost no one to
graduation, they can do nothing but improve
and come away with a fine showing in the brand
new WCAA.

Reagan, will combine with sophomores Craig

Lauchner and Dan Parr and freshman Jon
Root, one of the top recruits in the nation. The
latter three were members of the ten-man Na
tional Sports Festival West team over the sum
mer. Parr. Reagan and Root are all middle
blockers and thus Parr or Root might be moved
to an outside hitter position. The Cardinal will
try to gain a berth in the NCAA regionals in
19X3. but first they must deal with the CIV A. by
far the toughest conference in the country.
Teams like UCLA, USC and UCSB. all with
plenty of talent to win it all, are just a few ex
amples of what the Card will face. Though
Stanford w ill not have a tremendous amount of
depth, avoiding key injuries will keep it afloat in
the CIVA.

fifth place NCAA finish. After losing three

starters, coach Fred Sturm is looking for
players to fill in as well as ways to win in the
Card's competitive new league, the WCAA,

country. Kim Oden, who played in the National
Sports Festival last summer, will also challenge
lor a starting role. Though depth should not he
a factor, finding a potent starting unit will. The
talent is there, hut the chemistry is missing. The
WCAA should prove to he a big test for Sturm's
troops, with a line-up that one would only ex
pect to find at the NCAA Championships. Top
20 teams like UCLA and USC head the new
women's conference, making the Card's sched

An NCAA championship and a 31-0 record

Dante Dettamanti is not selling his team short
even though a big chunk last year's team fell
pre\ to graduation. Senior John Bergeson.who
last year was the NCAA's most prolific goal
scorer. will lead the charge that could possibly
end in the Card's fifth NCAA crown in seven
years. Six-year coach Dettamanti sees his '82
squad not as the best in the nation as it was a
year ago, but as a "contender."
UC Irvine. UCLA, Cal and USC pose as the
Card's four toughest opponents on a rugged
West Coast schedule, one that most likely will
take it toll in the form of defeats. But if the

team's question marks answer themselves
positively over the course of the season, Stan

Last Season: 5-6, sth in Pac-10
Conference: Pacific-10
Home Facility: Maples Pavilion
Alter being reinstated as a Stanford varsity
sport just three years ago, the Card wrestling
team has a chance at being a Pac-10 contender
in the 19X2-83 campaign. Coach Chris Horpel
will rest his hopes on fifth-year senior Doug
Perkins, junior I om Mullen and sophomore fcd
Katz. Perkins placed second in the Pac-10 last
season and is an early favorite to capture the
league title in the 177-pound weight class this
year. Stanford's strength in '82-83 will again lie
in the upper weights, while a lack of depth is the
biggest problem the Card will wrestle this sea
son. The Pac-10 will feature a pair of national
powerhouses in the "82-83 season: Arizona
State and Oregon. San Jose State will also be a
thorn in Stanford's schedule, one that is much
tougher than the easier Nor Cal schedule that
the Cardinal could play in place of the Pac-10.
I he ( ard will face its Pac-10 foes in a dual-meet
format for the first time ir) Stanford history.

BASEBALL
Coach: Mark Marquess

Last Season: 49-18-1, sth in NC A A
Conference: Pacific-10
Home Facility: Sunken Diamond
To put it simply, graduation and the pro draft
were not kind to the Cardinal over the summer.
At Commencement, the Farm bid farewell to
third baseman Loring Davies (.346. 45 RBI),
shortstop Bob DeCosta (.308. 44 RBI. 19 2B).
catcher Bob Hausladen (.301, 8 HR. 53 RBI),
right fielder M ike Tooth man (.258,41 RBI) and
pitchers Mike Sullivan (3-2) and Brian
Mignano (14-6. 68 SO. 13 complete games). It
gets worse. Via the pro draft, the Card said
good-bye to the eligiblitv of senior Steve Bue
chele (.354. 27 RBI) and top recruit Kenny Wil
liams. What's left of the 49-18-1 team, junior
Greg Loren/etti and seniors Mike Dotterer
(.359). Mike Aldrete, Eric Hardgraveand Dar
r\l Stephens, will solidify the outfield and first
base. But Marquess will be searching for a new
catcher, second baseman, short stop and third
baseman come the '83 season. Unlike past
Cardinal clubs, the experienced pitching staff
w ill be the strong point on the team, since it was
not hit hard by the pro draft. Although No. I
hurler Mignano is gone, a strong starting and
relief crew return, including junior Brian
Meyers (8-2) and sophomore sensations David
Harris (7-0, 3.25) and Greg Ballard (7-4, 61 SO
in 91 IP). On offense. Stanford will not hit for
averages as much as it will for power in '83 to go
along with good team speed. Marquess' biggest
chores w ill be filling the infield holes and keep
ing a youthful team away from injuries. A sec
ond consecutive College World Series ap
pearance is not definite, but by the same token
not out of the question.

BASKETBALL, MEN'S
Coach: Tom Davis
Last Season: 7-20
Conference: Paeific-10
Home Facility: Vlaples Pavilion
Although brilliant former Boston College
coach Tom Davis has arrived on the scene, his
debut season may be spoiled by a glaring lack of
talent and depth. Injuries have laid waste to

what might he a decent '82-83 squad and a poor
recruiting year has not improved the situation.
I eg injuries have rendered sophomores Johnny
Rogers, Pac-10 Rookie of the Year in 81-82,
and Roger Lemons "highly doubtful." accord
ing to Davis. Junior forward Hans Wichary is
still recovering from a foot stress fracture that
sidelined him for the better part of last season.
The onl> bright spot in the Cardinal's line-up
seems to be forward center John Revelli. First
Team All-Pac-IO last season as a sophomore,
leading the Card in scoring (16.4) and rebound
ing (8.6). At 6-8, 220 pounds, Revelli appears to
be the Card's only legitimate threat inside, un
less 6-10 senior David Nussbaumcan drasticaly
improve his '81-82 stats — 1.6 ppg and 1.1 rpg.
At guard, junior Keith Jones, who sat out last
season for academic reasons, and returning

c
starter sophomore Steve Brown are question
able as to v\ hether they will be a potent team. Of
the four new recruits, only junior transfer guard
Ricky Lewis and forward Eric Koberlein
should make an immediate contribution.
Nevertheless, the '82-83 campaign should
prove to he an exciting one with Davis at the
helm. Win or lose, slow or fast team, Davis
plans to run and press the entire game. And
with a 57.50 for 18 games student season ticket
package, the team should be fun, let alone <
cheap to watch, although losses will most likely
outnumber wins in the highlv competitive
Pac-10.
BASKETBALL, WOMEN'S
Coach: Dotti McCrea
Last Season: 19-8
Conference: Western Collegiate Athletic
Association (WC'AA)
Home Facility: Maples Pavilion
II coach Dotti McCrea can buy some ex
perience for her backcourt, the Card will once
again field a fine women's basketball team that
could equal or better last season's 19-8 mark
and an berth in the NCAA post-season tour
nament. Guards Angie Paccione, Sarah Miller
and Debbie Gore have all left the Farm via
graduation, leaving the Cardinal with youth in
the backcourt. Nevertheless, in returning for
wards Meg Metzger and Jeanne Ruark Hoffthe
Card has a pair of potential 20-point per game
stars. If Met/ger can stay out of foul trouble,
her nemesis last season, she could very well be
one of the top players on the West Coast, ac
cording to McCrea. To deepen Stanford's front
line even further, McCrea has recruited 6-2 cen

ter Sarah I vans, a player that should make an
immediate contribution. One change in the.
l l )82-83 season from last year will be a bit
slower st\le of play, one that will take full ad
vantage of Met/ger. etc. up front while remov
ing the pressure from the inexperienced guards.
The Cardinal will compete in a much tougher
league this season, the WCAA. It includes the
likes of nationally-ranked UCLA, Long Beach
Stale. \ri/ona State and USC, a potential Final
Lour team.
CROSS COUNTRY, MEN'S
Coach: Mike Tomasello
Last Season: 4th in the Pac-10
Conference: Pacific-10
Home Facility: Stanford Golf Course
A fine misture of returnees and rookies high
light Stanford's men's cross-country team this
fall. Senior Bill Graham and junior Jim Smith
will be the experience on an otherwise youthful
team. Sophomore Brian Pettingill. a national
contender in the mile during track season,
should also occupy one of the five "starting"
spots on the team. Star recruits will be freshmen
Charles Alexander, Mark Schrage, and Ryan
Stoll. If the Card can stay away from injuries to
key runners, it should have the depth to re
alistically compete for the southern Pac-10 title.
CROSS COUNTRY,
WOMEN'S
Coach: Brooks Johnson
I ast Season: 3rd in NCA \
Conference: Western Collegiate Athletic As
sociation (WCAA)
Stanford's women's cross country team can
do nothing but improve in '82. No one gradu
ated from 1981 's squad, while the Card ac
quired some talented recruits in the spring.
Sophomore Regina Jacobs and junior Ellen
Lyons have recovered from injuries that forced
them out of action last year. It all adds up to a
legitimate NCAA title contender. Returnees in

clude team captain Kim Schnurpfeil and Ceci
Hopp, the NCAA's 1982 10,000 and 3.000
meter champions, respectively. Junior Pattisue
Plumer and sophomore Ann Locke both are
potential All-Americans this fall. Coach
Brooks Johnson's prize recruit is Alison Wiley,
who finished 10th at the World Cross Country
Championships in Italy and who should make
the Cardinal a good bet to take the NCAAs this
November. Stanford will compete in the newly
formed WCAA in 1982. probably the most
competitive conference in the nation.
FENCING
Coach: Ed "Buzz" Hurst
Last Season: 5-2, 2nd in NorCal
Conference: Independent
Home Facility: Roble Gymnasium
Rookies and veterans will combine to give
Stanford's fencing team the potential to qualify
for all events in the NCAA Championships this
season.For the men. coach Buz/. Hurst has both
returning players and promising recruits in all
three fencing events — sabers, foils and epees. A
few examples: Senior Howard Cash, ranked
17th in the nation last year, will be backed by
freshman Andy Gorman in the saber division.
In the foil competition, the deepest area for the
Card, sophomore David Sherman heads a list
of experienced players who will battle for start
ing positions with freshman Eliot Chew. Nik
Blcvins, a junior, was 16th in the NCAA and
fourth in the junior Olympics a year ago will be
joined in the epee category by Harvey Kain.
Heading the women's team will be seniors
Pam Henck and Cathy Correa, two players who
starting fencing in classes at Stanford.
Sophomore Alison Reid and recruit Jennifer

Yu will add depth to the squad. The Card
fencers will face their toughest schedule ever
this season because they are independent for the
first time, without a restricting league. Na
tionally-ranked San Jose State, the Cardinal's
rival in fencing, top a list of extremely com
petitive teams.
FIELD HOCKEY
Coach: Onnie Killefer
Last Season: 6-5-3
Conference: NorCal
Home Facility: Roble Field
Coach Onnie Killefer is calling Stanford's
1982 field hockey season "challenging" with
good reason: seven players from last year's
squad will not play for the Farm this fall. The
six graduates include Andrea Welsh, Claudia
Gold and goalie Cecca Freccero. But the sev
enth loss may be the most serious. Junior Patsv
Huntington, a member of the junior national
team last year, will sit out the '82 campaign due

to an injury. That leaves the Cardinal to rest its
hopes on senior Becky Howell, both an ex
cellent defender and scorer. Besides Howell,
Killeler's troops will consist of team players
rather than outstanding individuals. Although
Stanford's tough schedule includes San Jose
Stale, Cal, UOP and fourth ranked Long Beach
State, improvement because of summer train
ing should help the Card meet the challenge.

FOOTBALL
Coach: Paul Wiggin
Last Season: 4-7
Conference: Pacific-10
Home Facility: Stanford Stadium
Stanford's always unpredictable football
team will enter the football season confronting
fans with yet another mystery. Suffering a dis
appointing 4-7 season last year, the team hopes
to become a part of the Rose Howl picture. Sen
ior All-America quarterback and Heisman
Trophy candidate John Elway returns and will
lead w hat should be one of the nations most po
tent passing attacks. Vincent White replaces the
irreplacable Darrin Nelson in the halfback
position. White, who runs like a Nelson clone,
is expected to keep the running game strong and
could he one of the surprises in the Pac-10. Jun
ior receiver Mike Tolliver leads an experienced
receiving crew and Chris Dressel returns for his
fourth year at the tight end position. The de
fense which ranked last in the Pac-10 against the
pass last year will try to get back on track with
All-America candidate Vaughn Williams
switching from strong to free safety this year.
Other defensive standouts include sophomore
noseguard Terry Jackson, junior tackle John
Bergren and sophomore linebacker Garin Ver
is. Junior Mark Harmon returns for the kicking
duties and should rank as one of the nations
best kickers. Still, question marks remain. Al
though the offense should be one of the nation's
best, the defense is still untested and depth is a
problem, especially on the offensive line.

GOLF, MEN'S
Coach: Tim Schaaf
Last Season: Sth in Pac-10
Conference: Pacific-10
Home Facility: Stanford Golf Course
Men's golf coach Tim Schaaf will be examin
ing swings and scorecards closer than ever
before come fall practice. Last year's regulars
Tad Buchanan, David Gamesand Neil Rob
inson have graduated, leaving the starting spots
on the Card's golf roster a wide open race. At
least ten individuals will vie for a postion on the
six-man starting team with one possible excep
tion — Josh Mondry. The Card sophomore was
Stanford's sole representative in the NCAA
championships while leading Stanford with a
74.X stroke average during the spring. The top
contenders for the other five places are senior
John Scanlon, juniors Tim Robinson, Lanny
Sawchuck, Lew Dickey and Doug Thompson
and sophomore Scott Erickson, all of which

saw action last season. Freshmen Carl Wagner
and Don Walsworth may also challenge for
playing time. After a decent showing last
fall.the male linksters faltered in the spring,
eventually taking fifth at the Pac-10 cham
pionships: a third place finish would have quali
fied the Card for the NCAAs. But if Shaaf can
make heads of tails this fall, the Card very well
may he in the thick of things come spring.

GOLF, WOMEN'S
Coach: Tim Baldwin
Last Season: 6th in NCAA
Conference: Western Collegiate Athletic n
Association (WCAA)
Home Facility: Stanford Golf Course
Stanford's women's golf team should be
about the same this season as last season, a
compliment. Under the fourth year tutelage of
mentor Tim Baldwin, the Card has landed two
talented recruits to fill the hole left by the gradu
ation of Lori Castillo and Debbie Barbario.
Kathy Kostas, Golf Magazine's No.I junior
female golfer in the country, and Julie
Carmichael will arrive on the scene this fall.
Kostas will team with sophomore standout
Diane Nixon, junior Kathy Nino, and senior
Joanne Pacillo to give the Card a NCAA con
tending squad with only one question mark —
depth. Hopefully, either Carmichael and senior
Roxy Gumlia will ablely fill the fifth spot on the
roster and provide the Cardinal with
'"'that missing dimension. Last season, Stanford
got off to a painfully slow start, one that threat
ened their even qualifying for the NCAA
Championships, which were held on the Stan
ford Golf Course last spring. But strong outings
late in the season, especially by Nixon, enabled
Baldwin and Co. not only to qualify for the
NCAAs, but place sixth though seeded 13th.
The Card's biggest fall tournament is the Stan
lord Fall Intercollegiate, an event it won two
years ago.

GYMNASTICS, MEN'S
Coach: Sadao Hamada
Last Season: sth in Pac-10
Conference: Pac-10
Home Facility: Maples Pavilion
An excellent recruiting year and unproved re
turning athletes make up what coach Sadao
Hamada calls the "strongest year ever" for the
Stanford men's gymnastics program. Seniors
Kirk Druey and Brian Nelson and junior Jim
Campanelli form the basis of the Hamada's
eleventh Cardinal team. Freshmen recruits Jon
Levy and Gary Smith will provide the Card
with needed depth. Although all-arounders,
both Levy and Smith specialize in the floor ex
ercise: Levy also has high marks in the rings,
while Smith excels at vaulting. If injuries do not
factor in the team's performance as they did last
year. Hamada believes the Card has a realistic
chance at the qualifying for the NCAAs.
GYMNASTICS, WOMEN'S
Coach: TBA
Last Season: 9-3, NorC'al champs
Conference: Western Collegiate Athletic
Association (WCAA)
Home Facility: Maples Pavilion
The 1982-83 version of Stanford's women's
gymnastics squad will not be all Merilyn Chap
man as much as her amazing stats make it ap
pear. The nationally-ranked junior will have a
strong supporting cast this season featuring a
mixture of returning and incoming gymnasts.
Top Card recruit is all-arounder Dell
Wilkinson will be joined by three promising
walk-ons. Senior Karen Hall will return in
'82-83. after redshirting last year. In '80-81.
Hall's all-around average of 34.68 was second
only to Chapman's. Senior Kim Strauss and
sophomore Angie Barnes will also return, pro
viding needed experience and depth. Ihe
Cardinal was not able to reach its potential last
season because of coaching complications. But
if the new women's coach can keep things under
control, 1982-83 could prove to be the first year
that Stanford can send both its gymnastics
teams to the NCAA championships.

tastic freshmen — Dave Bottom (American rec
ord holder in 100 back). Carter Cast. Jon Den

Todd Lincoln. David Sims. Bari Wieck and
Sam Worden. The backstroke, breaststroke
and individual medleys and al three relays will
all be the Cardinal's strongest events; if a
weakness exists, it's in the sprints, specifically
the 50 and 100 free. Sprints or no sprints, the
only team that should have the ability to stop
Stanford from winning its first NCAA title is
defending NCAA champ Texas. The Long
horns will join the Cardinal and the other top
four teams in the nation in late January at SVIU
for a meet sponsored by the Dallas Morn
ing Aews. Key home dual meets for Stanford
will he against CSC and 19X2 NCAA runner-up
UCLA. But if the Card stays healthy, Kenney

a NCAA title. Nothing more, nothing less.

most difficult feat to repeat.

TRACK, MEN'S
Coach: Brooks Johnson
Last Season: 6-6
Conference: Pacific-10
Home Facility: Stanford Stadium
The key to Stanford's men's track team in
148.1 is the development of the more youthful
members of this year's squad. Freshmen like
J.P. Holland. Brian Pettingill. Shaun Pickering,
Ciarin Veris and Freddy Williams give the
Cardinal a base from which to build future
teams. And Stanford can do nothing but im
pro\e on last season's tenth place finish in the
highly competitive Pac-10 —a conference that
featured six of the nation's lop ten dual meet
teams at the beginning of the 1981 campaign.
Holland is a triple and long jumper who also
contributes in the relays, while Pettingill was
perhaps the best freshman distance middle dis
tance runner in the country last spring. Pick
ering and Veris. a starting football player in the
tall, .ire national contenders in the hammer
throw and the shot put. respectively. Hopefully,
coach Brooks Johnson will be able to find some
support for Williams in the sprints, by far the
Card's weakest track department. Though the
Card has a good foundation on which to build,
it is still two or three solid recruiting years away
from being a serious Pac-10 contender.

TRACK, WOMEN'S

nationally-ranked freshmen Ceci Hopp and
Sloan Burton, sophomores I lien Lyons and
Pattisue Plumber and junior Kim Schnurpfeil.
However, in 19X2. Burton's season was can
celled due to a foot injury and the full prowess
of Stanford's distance runners was not on ex

theCard will havea pair of returning stars in the
weight events. Carol Cady and Mary Osborne.
Stanford women's 800 meter record holder Re
gina Jacobs will only be a sophomore this sea
son while sprinter and jumper Pam Donald has
yet another year of elgibility. As is the case with
the men's team, the women will lack depth, let
alone talent, in the sprints. But because of the
fact that the Lady Card tracksters lost no one to
graduation, they can do nothing but improve
and come away with a fine showing in the brand
new WCAA.

Lauchner and Dan Parr and freshman Jon
Root, one of the top recruits in the nation. The
latter three were members of the ten-man Na
tional Sports Festival West team over the sum
mer. Parr. Reagan and Root are all middle
blockers and thus Parr or Root might be moved
to an outside hitter position. The Cardinal will
try to gain a berth in the NCAA regionals in
19X3. but first they must deal with the CIV A. by
far the toughest conference in the country.
Teams like UCLA, USC and UCSB. all with
plenty of talent to win it all, are just a few ex
amples of what the Card will face. Though
Stanford w ill not have a tremendous amount of

lor a starting role. Though depth should not he
a factor, finding a potent starting unit will. The
talent is there, hut the chemistry is missing. The
WCAA should prove to he a big test for Sturm's
troops, with a line-up that one would only ex

scorer. will lead the charge that could possibly
end in the Card's fifth NCAA crown in seven
years. Six-year coach Dettamanti sees his '82
squad not as the best in the nation as it was a
year ago, but as a "contender."
UC Irvine. UCLA, Cal and USC pose as the
Card's four toughest opponents on a rugged
West Coast schedule, one that most likely will
take it toll in the form of defeats. But if the

WRESTLING
Coach: Chris Horpel
Last Season: 5-6, sth in Pac-10
Conference: Pacific-10
Home Facility: Maples Pavilion
Alter being reinstated as a Stanford varsity
sport just three years ago, the Card wrestling
team has a chance at being a Pac-10 contender
in the 19X2-83 campaign. Coach Chris Horpel
will rest his hopes on fifth-year senior Doug
Perkins, junior I om Mullen and sophomore fcd
Katz. Perkins placed second in the Pac-10 last
season and is an early favorite to capture the
league title in the 177-pound weight class this
year. Stanford's strength in '82-83 will again lie
in the upper weights, while a lack of depth is the
biggest problem the Card will wrestle this sea
son. The Pac-10 will feature a pair of national
powerhouses in the "82-83 season: Arizona
State and Oregon. San Jose State will also be a
thorn in Stanford's schedule, one that is much
tougher than the easier Nor Cal schedule that
the Cardinal could play in place of the Pac-10.
I he ( ard will face its Pac-10 foes in a dual-meet
format for the first time ir) Stanford history.

Last Season: 49-18-1, sth in NC A A
Conference: Pacific-10
Home Facility: Sunken Diamond
To put it simply, graduation and the pro draft
were not kind to the Cardinal over the summer.
At Commencement, the Farm bid farewell to
third baseman Loring Davies (.346. 45 RBI),
shortstop Bob DeCosta (.308. 44 RBI. 19 2B).
catcher Bob Hausladen (.301, 8 HR. 53 RBI),
right fielder M ike Tooth man (.258,41 RBI) and
pitchers Mike Sullivan (3-2) and Brian
Mignano (14-6. 68 SO. 13 complete games). It
gets worse. Via the pro draft, the Card said
good-bye to the eligiblitv of senior Steve Bue
chele (.354. 27 RBI) and top recruit Kenny Wil
liams. What's left of the 49-18-1 team, junior
Greg Loren/etti and seniors Mike Dotterer
(.359). Mike Aldrete, Eric Hardgraveand Dar
r\l Stephens, will solidify the outfield and first
base. But Marquess will be searching for a new
catcher, second baseman, short stop and third
baseman come the '83 season. Unlike past
Cardinal clubs, the experienced pitching staff
w ill be the strong point on the team, since it was
not hit hard by the pro draft. Although No. I
hurler Mignano is gone, a strong starting and
relief crew return, including junior Brian
Meyers (8-2) and sophomore sensations David
Harris (7-0, 3.25) and Greg Ballard (7-4, 61 SO
in 91 IP). On offense. Stanford will not hit for
averages as much as it will for power in '83 to go
along with good team speed. Marquess' biggest
chores w ill be filling the infield holes and keep
ing a youthful team away from injuries. A sec
ond consecutive College World Series ap
pearance is not definite, but by the same token
not out of the question.

BASKETBALL, MEN'S
Coach: Tom Davis
Last Season: 7-20

Home Facility: Vlaples Pavilion
Although brilliant former Boston College
coach Tom Davis has arrived on the scene, his
debut season may be spoiled by a glaring lack of
talent and depth. Injuries have laid waste to

what might he a decent '82-83 squad and a poor
recruiting year has not improved the situation.
I eg injuries have rendered sophomores Johnny
Rogers, Pac-10 Rookie of the Year in 81-82,
and Roger Lemons "highly doubtful." accord
ing to Davis. Junior forward Hans Wichary is
still recovering from a foot stress fracture that
sidelined him for the better part of last season.
The onl> bright spot in the Cardinal's line-up
seems to be forward center John Revelli. First
Team All-Pac-IO last season as a sophomore,
leading the Card in scoring (16.4) and rebound
ing (8.6). At 6-8, 220 pounds, Revelli appears to
be the Card's only legitimate threat inside, un
less 6-10 senior David Nussbaumcan drasticaly
improve his '81-82 stats — 1.6 ppg and 1.1 rpg.
At guard, junior Keith Jones, who sat out last
season for academic reasons, and returning

c
starter sophomore Steve Brown are question
able as to v\ hether they will be a potent team. Of
the four new recruits, only junior transfer guard
Ricky Lewis and forward Eric Koberlein
should make an immediate contribution.
Nevertheless, the '82-83 campaign should
prove to he an exciting one with Davis at the
helm. Win or lose, slow or fast team, Davis
plans to run and press the entire game. And
with a 57.50 for 18 games student season ticket
package, the team should be fun, let alone <
cheap to watch, although losses will most likely
outnumber wins in the highlv competitive
Pac-10.
BASKETBALL, WOMEN'S

Last Season: 19-8
Conference: Western Collegiate Athletic

Home Facility: Maples Pavilion
II coach Dotti McCrea can buy some ex
perience for her backcourt, the Card will once
again field a fine women's basketball team that
could equal or better last season's 19-8 mark
and an berth in the NCAA post-season tour
nament. Guards Angie Paccione, Sarah Miller
and Debbie Gore have all left the Farm via
graduation, leaving the Cardinal with youth in
the backcourt. Nevertheless, in returning for
wards Meg Metzger and Jeanne Ruark Hoffthe
Card has a pair of potential 20-point per game
stars. If Met/ger can stay out of foul trouble,
her nemesis last season, she could very well be
one of the top players on the West Coast, ac
cording to McCrea. To deepen Stanford's front
line even further, McCrea has recruited 6-2 cen

ter Sarah I vans, a player that should make an
immediate contribution. One change in the.
l l )82-83 season from last year will be a bit
slower st\le of play, one that will take full ad
vantage of Met/ger. etc. up front while remov
ing the pressure from the inexperienced guards.
The Cardinal will compete in a much tougher
league this season, the WCAA. It includes the
likes of nationally-ranked UCLA, Long Beach

Lour team.
CROSS COUNTRY, MEN'S

Last Season: 4th in the Pac-10
Conference: Pacific-10
Home Facility: Stanford Golf Course
A fine misture of returnees and rookies high
light Stanford's men's cross-country team this
fall. Senior Bill Graham and junior Jim Smith
will be the experience on an otherwise youthful
team. Sophomore Brian Pettingill. a national
contender in the mile during track season,
should also occupy one of the five "starting"
spots on the team. Star recruits will be freshmen
Charles Alexander, Mark Schrage, and Ryan
Stoll. If the Card can stay away from injuries to
key runners, it should have the depth to re
alistically compete for the southern Pac-10 title.
CROSS COUNTRY,
WOMEN'S
Coach: Brooks Johnson
I ast Season: 3rd in NCA \
Conference: Western Collegiate Athletic As
sociation (WCAA)
Stanford's women's cross country team can
do nothing but improve in '82. No one gradu
ated from 1981 's squad, while the Card ac
quired some talented recruits in the spring.
Sophomore Regina Jacobs and junior Ellen
Lyons have recovered from injuries that forced
them out of action last year. It all adds up to a
legitimate NCAA title contender. Returnees in

clude team captain Kim Schnurpfeil and Ceci
Hopp, the NCAA's 1982 10,000 and 3.000
meter champions, respectively. Junior Pattisue
Plumer and sophomore Ann Locke both are
potential All-Americans this fall. Coach
Brooks Johnson's prize recruit is Alison Wiley,
who finished 10th at the World Cross Country
Championships in Italy and who should make
the Cardinal a good bet to take the NCAAs this
November. Stanford will compete in the newly
formed WCAA in 1982. probably the most
competitive conference in the nation.
FENCING
Coach: Ed "Buzz" Hurst
Last Season: 5-2, 2nd in NorCal
Conference: Independent
Home Facility: Roble Gymnasium
Rookies and veterans will combine to give
Stanford's fencing team the potential to qualify
for all events in the NCAA Championships this
season.For the men. coach Buz/. Hurst has both
returning players and promising recruits in all
three fencing events — sabers, foils and epees. A
few examples: Senior Howard Cash, ranked
17th in the nation last year, will be backed by
freshman Andy Gorman in the saber division.
In the foil competition, the deepest area for the
Card, sophomore David Sherman heads a list
of experienced players who will battle for start
ing positions with freshman Eliot Chew. Nik
Blcvins, a junior, was 16th in the NCAA and
fourth in the junior Olympics a year ago will be
joined in the epee category by Harvey Kain.
Heading the women's team will be seniors
Pam Henck and Cathy Correa, two players who
starting fencing in classes at Stanford.
Sophomore Alison Reid and recruit Jennifer

Yu will add depth to the squad. The Card
fencers will face their toughest schedule ever
this season because they are independent for the
first time, without a restricting league. Na
tionally-ranked San Jose State, the Cardinal's
rival in fencing, top a list of extremely com
petitive teams.
FIELD HOCKEY
Coach: Onnie Killefer
Last Season: 6-5-3
Conference: NorCal
Home Facility: Roble Field
Coach Onnie Killefer is calling Stanford's
1982 field hockey season "challenging" with
good reason: seven players from last year's
squad will not play for the Farm this fall. The
six graduates include Andrea Welsh, Claudia
Gold and goalie Cecca Freccero. But the sev
enth loss may be the most serious. Junior Patsv
Huntington, a member of the junior national
team last year, will sit out the '82 campaign due

to an injury. That leaves the Cardinal to rest its
hopes on senior Becky Howell, both an ex
cellent defender and scorer. Besides Howell,
Killeler's troops will consist of team players
rather than outstanding individuals. Although
Stanford's tough schedule includes San Jose
Stale, Cal, UOP and fourth ranked Long Beach
State, improvement because of summer train
ing should help the Card meet the challenge.

FOOTBALL
Coach: Paul Wiggin
Last Season: 4-7
Conference: Pacific-10
Home Facility: Stanford Stadium
Stanford's always unpredictable football
team will enter the football season confronting
fans with yet another mystery. Suffering a dis
appointing 4-7 season last year, the team hopes
to become a part of the Rose Howl picture. Sen
ior All-America quarterback and Heisman
Trophy candidate John Elway returns and will
lead w hat should be one of the nations most po
tent passing attacks. Vincent White replaces the
irreplacable Darrin Nelson in the halfback
position. White, who runs like a Nelson clone,
is expected to keep the running game strong and
could he one of the surprises in the Pac-10. Jun
ior receiver Mike Tolliver leads an experienced
receiving crew and Chris Dressel returns for his
fourth year at the tight end position. The de
fense which ranked last in the Pac-10 against the
pass last year will try to get back on track with
All-America candidate Vaughn Williams
switching from strong to free safety this year.
Other defensive standouts include sophomore
noseguard Terry Jackson, junior tackle John
Bergren and sophomore linebacker Garin Ver
is. Junior Mark Harmon returns for the kicking
duties and should rank as one of the nations
best kickers. Still, question marks remain. Al
though the offense should be one of the nation's
best, the defense is still untested and depth is a
problem, especially on the offensive line.

GOLF, MEN'S
Coach: Tim Schaaf
Last Season: Sth in Pac-10
Conference: Pacific-10
Home Facility: Stanford Golf Course
Men's golf coach Tim Schaaf will be examin
ing swings and scorecards closer than ever
before come fall practice. Last year's regulars
Tad Buchanan, David Gamesand Neil Rob
inson have graduated, leaving the starting spots
on the Card's golf roster a wide open race. At
least ten individuals will vie for a postion on the
six-man starting team with one possible excep
tion — Josh Mondry. The Card sophomore was
Stanford's sole representative in the NCAA
championships while leading Stanford with a
74.X stroke average during the spring. The top
contenders for the other five places are senior
John Scanlon, juniors Tim Robinson, Lanny
Sawchuck, Lew Dickey and Doug Thompson
and sophomore Scott Erickson, all of which

saw action last season. Freshmen Carl Wagner
and Don Walsworth may also challenge for
playing time. After a decent showing last
fall.the male linksters faltered in the spring,
eventually taking fifth at the Pac-10 cham
pionships: a third place finish would have quali
fied the Card for the NCAAs. But if Shaaf can
make heads of tails this fall, the Card very well
may he in the thick of things come spring.

GOLF, WOMEN'S
Coach: Tim Baldwin
Last Season: 6th in NCAA
Conference: Western Collegiate Athletic n
Association (WCAA)
Home Facility: Stanford Golf Course
Stanford's women's golf team should be
about the same this season as last season, a
compliment. Under the fourth year tutelage of
mentor Tim Baldwin, the Card has landed two
talented recruits to fill the hole left by the gradu
ation of Lori Castillo and Debbie Barbario.
Kathy Kostas, Golf Magazine's No.I junior
female golfer in the country, and Julie
Carmichael will arrive on the scene this fall.
Kostas will team with sophomore standout
Diane Nixon, junior Kathy Nino, and senior
Joanne Pacillo to give the Card a NCAA con
tending squad with only one question mark —
depth. Hopefully, either Carmichael and senior
Roxy Gumlia will ablely fill the fifth spot on the
roster and provide the Cardinal with
'"'that missing dimension. Last season, Stanford
got off to a painfully slow start, one that threat
ened their even qualifying for the NCAA
Championships, which were held on the Stan
ford Golf Course last spring. But strong outings
late in the season, especially by Nixon, enabled
Baldwin and Co. not only to qualify for the
NCAAs, but place sixth though seeded 13th.
The Card's biggest fall tournament is the Stan
lord Fall Intercollegiate, an event it won two
years ago.

GYMNASTICS, MEN'S
Coach: Sadao Hamada
Last Season: sth in Pac-10
Conference: Pac-10
Home Facility: Maples Pavilion
An excellent recruiting year and unproved re
turning athletes make up what coach Sadao
Hamada calls the "strongest year ever" for the
Stanford men's gymnastics program. Seniors
Kirk Druey and Brian Nelson and junior Jim
Campanelli form the basis of the Hamada's
eleventh Cardinal team. Freshmen recruits Jon
Levy and Gary Smith will provide the Card
with needed depth. Although all-arounders,
both Levy and Smith specialize in the floor ex
ercise: Levy also has high marks in the rings,
while Smith excels at vaulting. If injuries do not
factor in the team's performance as they did last
year. Hamada believes the Card has a realistic
chance at the qualifying for the NCAAs.
GYMNASTICS, WOMEN'S
Coach: TBA
Last Season: 9-3, NorC'al champs
Conference: Western Collegiate Athletic
Association (WCAA)
Home Facility: Maples Pavilion
The 1982-83 version of Stanford's women's
gymnastics squad will not be all Merilyn Chap
man as much as her amazing stats make it ap
pear. The nationally-ranked junior will have a
strong supporting cast this season featuring a
mixture of returning and incoming gymnasts.
Top Card recruit is all-arounder Dell
Wilkinson will be joined by three promising
walk-ons. Senior Karen Hall will return in
'82-83. after redshirting last year. In '80-81.
Hall's all-around average of 34.68 was second
only to Chapman's. Senior Kim Strauss and
sophomore Angie Barnes will also return, pro
viding needed experience and depth. Ihe
Cardinal was not able to reach its potential last
season because of coaching complications. But
if the new women's coach can keep things under
control, 1982-83 could prove to be the first year
that Stanford can send both its gymnastics
teams to the NCAA championships.

Todd Lincoln. David Sims. Bari Wieck and
Sam Worden. The backstroke, breaststroke
and individual medleys and al three relays will
all be the Cardinal's strongest events; if a
weakness exists, it's in the sprints, specifically
the 50 and 100 free. Sprints or no sprints, the
only team that should have the ability to stop
Stanford from winning its first NCAA title is
defending NCAA champ Texas. The Long

four teams in the nation in late January at SVIU
for a meet sponsored by the Dallas Morn

Last Season: 6-6

The key to Stanford's men's track team in

members of this year's squad. Freshmen like
J.P. Holland. Brian Pettingill. Shaun Pickering,
Ciarin Veris and Freddy Williams give the
Cardinal a base from which to build future
teams. And Stanford can do nothing but im
pro\e on last season's tenth place finish in the
highly competitive Pac-10 —a conference that
featured six of the nation's lop ten dual meet
teams at the beginning of the 1981 campaign.
Holland is a triple and long jumper who also
contributes in the relays, while Pettingill was
perhaps the best freshman distance middle dis
tance runner in the country last spring. Pick
ering and Veris. a starting football player in the
tall, .ire national contenders in the hammer
throw and the shot put. respectively. Hopefully,
coach Brooks Johnson will be able to find some
support for Williams in the sprints, by far the
Card's weakest track department. Though the
Card has a good foundation on which to build,
it is still two or three solid recruiting years away
from being a serious Pac-10 contender.

Pattisue Plumber and junior Kim Schnurpfeil.
However, in 19X2. Burton's season was can

Stanford women's 800 meter record holder Re

yet another year of elgibility. As is the case with
the men's team, the women will lack depth, let

far the toughest conference in the country.
Teams like UCLA, USC and UCSB. all with

An NCAA championship and a 31-0 record
will he hard to duplicate in 1982, but coach
Dante Dettamanti is not selling his team short
even though a big chunk last year's team fell
pre\ to graduation. Senior John Bergeson.who
last year was the NCAA's most prolific goal
scorer. will lead the charge that could possibly
end in the Card's fifth NCAA crown in seven
years. Six-year coach Dettamanti sees his '82
squad not as the best in the nation as it was a
year ago, but as a "contender."
UC Irvine. UCLA, Cal and USC pose as the
Card's four toughest opponents on a rugged
West Coast schedule, one that most likely will
take it toll in the form of defeats. But if the

team's question marks answer themselves
positively over the course of the season, Stan

Last Season: 5-6, sth in Pac-10
Conference: Pacific-10
Home Facility: Maples Pavilion
Alter being reinstated as a Stanford varsity
sport just three years ago, the Card wrestling
team has a chance at being a Pac-10 contender
in the 19X2-83 campaign. Coach Chris Horpel
will rest his hopes on fifth-year senior Doug
Perkins, junior I om Mullen and sophomore fcd
Katz. Perkins placed second in the Pac-10 last
season and is an early favorite to capture the
league title in the 177-pound weight class this
year. Stanford's strength in '82-83 will again lie
in the upper weights, while a lack of depth is the
biggest problem the Card will wrestle this sea
son. The Pac-10 will feature a pair of national
powerhouses in the "82-83 season: Arizona
State and Oregon. San Jose State will also be a
thorn in Stanford's schedule, one that is much
tougher than the easier Nor Cal schedule that
the Cardinal could play in place of the Pac-10.

format for the first time ir) Stanford history.

To put it simply, graduation and the pro draft
were not kind to the Cardinal over the summer.
At Commencement, the Farm bid farewell to
third baseman Loring Davies (.346. 45 RBI),
shortstop Bob DeCosta (.308. 44 RBI. 19 2B).
catcher Bob Hausladen (.301, 8 HR. 53 RBI),
right fielder M ike Tooth man (.258,41 RBI) and
pitchers Mike Sullivan (3-2) and Brian
Mignano (14-6. 68 SO. 13 complete games). It
gets worse. Via the pro draft, the Card said
good-bye to the eligiblitv of senior Steve Bue
chele (.354. 27 RBI) and top recruit Kenny Wil
liams. What's left of the 49-18-1 team, junior
Greg Loren/etti and seniors Mike Dotterer
(.359). Mike Aldrete, Eric Hardgraveand Dar
r\l Stephens, will solidify the outfield and first
base. But Marquess will be searching for a new
catcher, second baseman, short stop and third
baseman come the '83 season. Unlike past
Cardinal clubs, the experienced pitching staff
w ill be the strong point on the team, since it was
not hit hard by the pro draft. Although No. I
hurler Mignano is gone, a strong starting and
relief crew return, including junior Brian
Meyers (8-2) and sophomore sensations David
Harris (7-0, 3.25) and Greg Ballard (7-4, 61 SO
in 91 IP). On offense. Stanford will not hit for
averages as much as it will for power in '83 to go
along with good team speed. Marquess' biggest
chores w ill be filling the infield holes and keep
ing a youthful team away from injuries. A sec

pearance is not definite, but by the same token
not out of the question.

BASKETBALL, MEN'S

Last Season: 7-20

Although brilliant former Boston College
coach Tom Davis has arrived on the scene, his
debut season may be spoiled by a glaring lack of
talent and depth. Injuries have laid waste to

what might he a decent '82-83 squad and a poor
recruiting year has not improved the situation.

Rogers, Pac-10 Rookie of the Year in 81-82,
and Roger Lemons "highly doubtful." accord
ing to Davis. Junior forward Hans Wichary is
still recovering from a foot stress fracture that
sidelined him for the better part of last season.
The onl> bright spot in the Cardinal's line-up
seems to be forward center John Revelli. First
Team All-Pac-IO last season as a sophomore,
leading the Card in scoring (16.4) and rebound
ing (8.6). At 6-8, 220 pounds, Revelli appears to
be the Card's only legitimate threat inside, un
less 6-10 senior David Nussbaumcan drasticaly
improve his '81-82 stats — 1.6 ppg and 1.1 rpg.
At guard, junior Keith Jones, who sat out last
season for academic reasons, and returning

c
starter sophomore Steve Brown are question
able as to v\ hether they will be a potent team. Of
the four new recruits, only junior transfer guard
Ricky Lewis and forward Eric Koberlein
should make an immediate contribution.
Nevertheless, the '82-83 campaign should
prove to he an exciting one with Davis at the
helm. Win or lose, slow or fast team, Davis
plans to run and press the entire game. And
with a 57.50 for 18 games student season ticket
package, the team should be fun, let alone <
cheap to watch, although losses will most likely
outnumber wins in the highlv competitive
Pac-10.

II coach Dotti McCrea can buy some ex
perience for her backcourt, the Card will once
again field a fine women's basketball team that
could equal or better last season's 19-8 mark
and an berth in the NCAA post-season tour
nament. Guards Angie Paccione, Sarah Miller
and Debbie Gore have all left the Farm via
graduation, leaving the Cardinal with youth in
the backcourt. Nevertheless, in returning for
wards Meg Metzger and Jeanne Ruark Hoffthe
Card has a pair of potential 20-point per game
stars. If Met/ger can stay out of foul trouble,
her nemesis last season, she could very well be
one of the top players on the West Coast, ac
cording to McCrea. To deepen Stanford's front
line even further, McCrea has recruited 6-2 cen

immediate contribution. One change in the.
l l )82-83 season from last year will be a bit
slower st\le of play, one that will take full ad
vantage of Met/ger. etc. up front while remov

Conference: Pacific-10
Home Facility: Stanford Golf Course
A fine misture of returnees and rookies high
light Stanford's men's cross-country team this
fall. Senior Bill Graham and junior Jim Smith
will be the experience on an otherwise youthful
team. Sophomore Brian Pettingill. a national
contender in the mile during track season,
should also occupy one of the five "starting"
spots on the team. Star recruits will be freshmen
Charles Alexander, Mark Schrage, and Ryan
Stoll. If the Card can stay away from injuries to
key runners, it should have the depth to re
alistically compete for the southern Pac-10 title.
CROSS COUNTRY,
WOMEN'S
Coach: Brooks Johnson

Conference: Western Collegiate Athletic As
sociation (WCAA)
Stanford's women's cross country team can
do nothing but improve in '82. No one gradu
ated from 1981 's squad, while the Card ac
quired some talented recruits in the spring.
Sophomore Regina Jacobs and junior Ellen
Lyons have recovered from injuries that forced
them out of action last year. It all adds up to a
legitimate NCAA title contender. Returnees in

clude team captain Kim Schnurpfeil and Ceci
Hopp, the NCAA's 1982 10,000 and 3.000
meter champions, respectively. Junior Pattisue
Plumer and sophomore Ann Locke both are
potential All-Americans this fall. Coach
Brooks Johnson's prize recruit is Alison Wiley,
who finished 10th at the World Cross Country
Championships in Italy and who should make
the Cardinal a good bet to take the NCAAs this
November. Stanford will compete in the newly
formed WCAA in 1982. probably the most
competitive conference in the nation.
FENCING
Coach: Ed "Buzz" Hurst
Last Season: 5-2, 2nd in NorCal
Conference: Independent
Home Facility: Roble Gymnasium
Rookies and veterans will combine to give
Stanford's fencing team the potential to qualify
for all events in the NCAA Championships this
season.For the men. coach Buz/. Hurst has both
returning players and promising recruits in all
three fencing events — sabers, foils and epees. A
few examples: Senior Howard Cash, ranked
17th in the nation last year, will be backed by
freshman Andy Gorman in the saber division.
In the foil competition, the deepest area for the
Card, sophomore David Sherman heads a list
of experienced players who will battle for start
ing positions with freshman Eliot Chew. Nik
Blcvins, a junior, was 16th in the NCAA and
fourth in the junior Olympics a year ago will be
joined in the epee category by Harvey Kain.
Heading the women's team will be seniors
Pam Henck and Cathy Correa, two players who
starting fencing in classes at Stanford.
Sophomore Alison Reid and recruit Jennifer

Yu will add depth to the squad. The Card
fencers will face their toughest schedule ever
this season because they are independent for the
first time, without a restricting league. Na
tionally-ranked San Jose State, the Cardinal's
rival in fencing, top a list of extremely com
petitive teams.
FIELD HOCKEY
Coach: Onnie Killefer
Last Season: 6-5-3
Conference: NorCal
Home Facility: Roble Field
Coach Onnie Killefer is calling Stanford's
1982 field hockey season "challenging" with
good reason: seven players from last year's
squad will not play for the Farm this fall. The
six graduates include Andrea Welsh, Claudia
Gold and goalie Cecca Freccero. But the sev
enth loss may be the most serious. Junior Patsv
Huntington, a member of the junior national
team last year, will sit out the '82 campaign due

to an injury. That leaves the Cardinal to rest its
hopes on senior Becky Howell, both an ex
cellent defender and scorer. Besides Howell,
Killeler's troops will consist of team players
rather than outstanding individuals. Although
Stanford's tough schedule includes San Jose
Stale, Cal, UOP and fourth ranked Long Beach
State, improvement because of summer train
ing should help the Card meet the challenge.

FOOTBALL
Coach: Paul Wiggin
Last Season: 4-7
Conference: Pacific-10
Home Facility: Stanford Stadium
Stanford's always unpredictable football
team will enter the football season confronting
fans with yet another mystery. Suffering a dis
appointing 4-7 season last year, the team hopes
to become a part of the Rose Howl picture. Sen
ior All-America quarterback and Heisman
Trophy candidate John Elway returns and will
lead w hat should be one of the nations most po
tent passing attacks. Vincent White replaces the
irreplacable Darrin Nelson in the halfback
position. White, who runs like a Nelson clone,
is expected to keep the running game strong and
could he one of the surprises in the Pac-10. Jun
ior receiver Mike Tolliver leads an experienced
receiving crew and Chris Dressel returns for his
fourth year at the tight end position. The de
fense which ranked last in the Pac-10 against the
pass last year will try to get back on track with
All-America candidate Vaughn Williams
switching from strong to free safety this year.
Other defensive standouts include sophomore
noseguard Terry Jackson, junior tackle John
Bergren and sophomore linebacker Garin Ver
is. Junior Mark Harmon returns for the kicking
duties and should rank as one of the nations
best kickers. Still, question marks remain. Al
though the offense should be one of the nation's
best, the defense is still untested and depth is a
problem, especially on the offensive line.

GOLF, MEN'S
Coach: Tim Schaaf
Last Season: Sth in Pac-10
Conference: Pacific-10
Home Facility: Stanford Golf Course
Men's golf coach Tim Schaaf will be examin
ing swings and scorecards closer than ever
before come fall practice. Last year's regulars
Tad Buchanan, David Gamesand Neil Rob
inson have graduated, leaving the starting spots
on the Card's golf roster a wide open race. At
least ten individuals will vie for a postion on the
six-man starting team with one possible excep
tion — Josh Mondry. The Card sophomore was
Stanford's sole representative in the NCAA
championships while leading Stanford with a
74.X stroke average during the spring. The top
contenders for the other five places are senior
John Scanlon, juniors Tim Robinson, Lanny
Sawchuck, Lew Dickey and Doug Thompson
and sophomore Scott Erickson, all of which

saw action last season. Freshmen Carl Wagner
and Don Walsworth may also challenge for
playing time. After a decent showing last
fall.the male linksters faltered in the spring,
eventually taking fifth at the Pac-10 cham
pionships: a third place finish would have quali
fied the Card for the NCAAs. But if Shaaf can
make heads of tails this fall, the Card very well
may he in the thick of things come spring.

GOLF, WOMEN'S
Coach: Tim Baldwin
Last Season: 6th in NCAA
Conference: Western Collegiate Athletic n
Association (WCAA)
Home Facility: Stanford Golf Course
Stanford's women's golf team should be
about the same this season as last season, a
compliment. Under the fourth year tutelage of
mentor Tim Baldwin, the Card has landed two
talented recruits to fill the hole left by the gradu
ation of Lori Castillo and Debbie Barbario.
Kathy Kostas, Golf Magazine's No.I junior
female golfer in the country, and Julie
Carmichael will arrive on the scene this fall.
Kostas will team with sophomore standout
Diane Nixon, junior Kathy Nino, and senior
Joanne Pacillo to give the Card a NCAA con
tending squad with only one question mark —
depth. Hopefully, either Carmichael and senior
Roxy Gumlia will ablely fill the fifth spot on the
roster and provide the Cardinal with
'"'that missing dimension. Last season, Stanford
got off to a painfully slow start, one that threat
ened their even qualifying for the NCAA
Championships, which were held on the Stan
ford Golf Course last spring. But strong outings
late in the season, especially by Nixon, enabled
Baldwin and Co. not only to qualify for the
NCAAs, but place sixth though seeded 13th.
The Card's biggest fall tournament is the Stan
lord Fall Intercollegiate, an event it won two
years ago.

GYMNASTICS, MEN'S
Coach: Sadao Hamada
Last Season: sth in Pac-10
Conference: Pac-10
Home Facility: Maples Pavilion
An excellent recruiting year and unproved re
turning athletes make up what coach Sadao
Hamada calls the "strongest year ever" for the
Stanford men's gymnastics program. Seniors
Kirk Druey and Brian Nelson and junior Jim
Campanelli form the basis of the Hamada's
eleventh Cardinal team. Freshmen recruits Jon
Levy and Gary Smith will provide the Card
with needed depth. Although all-arounders,
both Levy and Smith specialize in the floor ex
ercise: Levy also has high marks in the rings,
while Smith excels at vaulting. If injuries do not
factor in the team's performance as they did last
year. Hamada believes the Card has a realistic
chance at the qualifying for the NCAAs.
GYMNASTICS, WOMEN'S
Coach: TBA
Last Season: 9-3, NorC'al champs
Conference: Western Collegiate Athletic
Association (WCAA)
Home Facility: Maples Pavilion
The 1982-83 version of Stanford's women's
gymnastics squad will not be all Merilyn Chap
man as much as her amazing stats make it ap
pear. The nationally-ranked junior will have a
strong supporting cast this season featuring a
mixture of returning and incoming gymnasts.
Top Card recruit is all-arounder Dell
Wilkinson will be joined by three promising
walk-ons. Senior Karen Hall will return in
'82-83. after redshirting last year. In '80-81.
Hall's all-around average of 34.68 was second
only to Chapman's. Senior Kim Strauss and
sophomore Angie Barnes will also return, pro
viding needed experience and depth. Ihe
Cardinal was not able to reach its potential last
season because of coaching complications. But
if the new women's coach can keep things under
control, 1982-83 could prove to be the first year
that Stanford can send both its gymnastics
teams to the NCAA championships.

Todd Lincoln. David Sims. Bari Wieck and
Sam Worden. The backstroke, breaststroke
and individual medleys and al three relays will
all be the Cardinal's strongest events; if a
weakness exists, it's in the sprints, specifically
the 50 and 100 free. Sprints or no sprints, the
only team that should have the ability to stop
Stanford from winning its first NCAA title is
defending NCAA champ Texas. The Long

four teams in the nation in late January at SVIU
for a meet sponsored by the Dallas Morn

The key to Stanford's men's track team in

members of this year's squad. Freshmen like
J.P. Holland. Brian Pettingill. Shaun Pickering,
Ciarin Veris and Freddy Williams give the
Cardinal a base from which to build future
teams. And Stanford can do nothing but im
pro\e on last season's tenth place finish in the
highly competitive Pac-10 —a conference that
featured six of the nation's lop ten dual meet
teams at the beginning of the 1981 campaign.
Holland is a triple and long jumper who also
contributes in the relays, while Pettingill was
perhaps the best freshman distance middle dis
tance runner in the country last spring. Pick
ering and Veris. a starting football player in the
tall, .ire national contenders in the hammer
throw and the shot put. respectively. Hopefully,
coach Brooks Johnson will be able to find some
support for Williams in the sprints, by far the
Card's weakest track department. Though the

Pattisue Plumber and junior Kim Schnurpfeil.
However, in 19X2. Burton's season was can

WATER POLO
Coach: Dante Dettamanti

Conference: Pacific-10
Home Facility: DeGuerre Pool
An NCAA championship and a 31-0 record
will he hard to duplicate in 1982, but coach
Dante Dettamanti is not selling his team short
even though a big chunk last year's team fell
pre\ to graduation. Senior John Bergeson.who
last year was the NCAA's most prolific goal
scorer. will lead the charge that could possibly
end in the Card's fifth NCAA crown in seven
years. Six-year coach Dettamanti sees his '82
squad not as the best in the nation as it was a
year ago, but as a "contender."
UC Irvine. UCLA, Cal and USC pose as the
Card's four toughest opponents on a rugged
West Coast schedule, one that most likely will
take it toll in the form of defeats. But if the

team's question marks answer themselves
positively over the course of the season, Stan
lord could escape with less than five losses.
WRESTLING
Coach: Chris Horpel
Last Season: 5-6, sth in Pac-10
Conference: Pacific-10
Home Facility: Maples Pavilion
Alter being reinstated as a Stanford varsity
sport just three years ago, the Card wrestling
team has a chance at being a Pac-10 contender
in the 19X2-83 campaign. Coach Chris Horpel
will rest his hopes on fifth-year senior Doug
Perkins, junior I om Mullen and sophomore fcd
Katz. Perkins placed second in the Pac-10 last
season and is an early favorite to capture the
league title in the 177-pound weight class this
year. Stanford's strength in '82-83 will again lie
in the upper weights, while a lack of depth is the
biggest problem the Card will wrestle this sea
son. The Pac-10 will feature a pair of national
powerhouses in the "82-83 season: Arizona
State and Oregon. San Jose State will also be a
thorn in Stanford's schedule, one that is much
tougher than the easier Nor Cal schedule that
the Cardinal could play in place of the Pac-10.
I he ( ard will face its Pac-10 foes in a dual-meet
format for the first time ir) Stanford history.

Last Season: 49-18-1, sth in NC A A
Conference: Pacific-10
Home Facility: Sunken Diamond
To put it simply, graduation and the pro draft
were not kind to the Cardinal over the summer.
At Commencement, the Farm bid farewell to
third baseman Loring Davies (.346. 45 RBI),
shortstop Bob DeCosta (.308. 44 RBI. 19 2B).
catcher Bob Hausladen (.301, 8 HR. 53 RBI),
right fielder M ike Tooth man (.258,41 RBI) and
pitchers Mike Sullivan (3-2) and Brian
Mignano (14-6. 68 SO. 13 complete games). It
gets worse. Via the pro draft, the Card said
good-bye to the eligiblitv of senior Steve Bue
chele (.354. 27 RBI) and top recruit Kenny Wil
liams. What's left of the 49-18-1 team, junior
Greg Loren/etti and seniors Mike Dotterer
(.359). Mike Aldrete, Eric Hardgraveand Dar
r\l Stephens, will solidify the outfield and first
base. But Marquess will be searching for a new
catcher, second baseman, short stop and third
baseman come the '83 season. Unlike past
Cardinal clubs, the experienced pitching staff
w ill be the strong point on the team, since it was
not hit hard by the pro draft. Although No. I
hurler Mignano is gone, a strong starting and
relief crew return, including junior Brian
Meyers (8-2) and sophomore sensations David
Harris (7-0, 3.25) and Greg Ballard (7-4, 61 SO
in 91 IP). On offense. Stanford will not hit for
averages as much as it will for power in '83 to go
along with good team speed. Marquess' biggest
chores w ill be filling the infield holes and keep
ing a youthful team away from injuries. A sec
ond consecutive College World Series ap
pearance is not definite, but by the same token
not out of the question.

BASKETBALL, MEN'S
Coach: Tom Davis
Last Season: 7-20

Home Facility: Vlaples Pavilion
Although brilliant former Boston College
coach Tom Davis has arrived on the scene, his
debut season may be spoiled by a glaring lack of
talent and depth. Injuries have laid waste to

what might he a decent '82-83 squad and a poor
recruiting year has not improved the situation.
I eg injuries have rendered sophomores Johnny
Rogers, Pac-10 Rookie of the Year in 81-82,
and Roger Lemons "highly doubtful." accord
ing to Davis. Junior forward Hans Wichary is
still recovering from a foot stress fracture that
sidelined him for the better part of last season.
The onl> bright spot in the Cardinal's line-up
seems to be forward center John Revelli. First
Team All-Pac-IO last season as a sophomore,
leading the Card in scoring (16.4) and rebound
ing (8.6). At 6-8, 220 pounds, Revelli appears to
be the Card's only legitimate threat inside, un
less 6-10 senior David Nussbaumcan drasticaly
improve his '81-82 stats — 1.6 ppg and 1.1 rpg.
At guard, junior Keith Jones, who sat out last
season for academic reasons, and returning

c
starter sophomore Steve Brown are question
able as to v\ hether they will be a potent team. Of
the four new recruits, only junior transfer guard
Ricky Lewis and forward Eric Koberlein
should make an immediate contribution.
Nevertheless, the '82-83 campaign should
prove to he an exciting one with Davis at the
helm. Win or lose, slow or fast team, Davis
plans to run and press the entire game. And
with a 57.50 for 18 games student season ticket
package, the team should be fun, let alone <
cheap to watch, although losses will most likely
outnumber wins in the highlv competitive
Pac-10.
BASKETBALL, WOMEN'S

Last Season: 19-8
Conference: Western Collegiate Athletic
Association (WC'AA)
Home Facility: Maples Pavilion
II coach Dotti McCrea can buy some ex
perience for her backcourt, the Card will once
again field a fine women's basketball team that
could equal or better last season's 19-8 mark
and an berth in the NCAA post-season tour
nament. Guards Angie Paccione, Sarah Miller
and Debbie Gore have all left the Farm via
graduation, leaving the Cardinal with youth in
the backcourt. Nevertheless, in returning for
wards Meg Metzger and Jeanne Ruark Hoffthe
Card has a pair of potential 20-point per game
stars. If Met/ger can stay out of foul trouble,
her nemesis last season, she could very well be
one of the top players on the West Coast, ac
cording to McCrea. To deepen Stanford's front
line even further, McCrea has recruited 6-2 cen

ter Sarah I vans, a player that should make an
immediate contribution. One change in the.
l l )82-83 season from last year will be a bit
slower st\le of play, one that will take full ad
vantage of Met/ger. etc. up front while remov

The Cardinal will compete in a much tougher
league this season, the WCAA. It includes the
likes of nationally-ranked UCLA, Long Beach

CROSS COUNTRY, MEN'S

Last Season: 4th in the Pac-10
Conference: Pacific-10
Home Facility: Stanford Golf Course
A fine misture of returnees and rookies high
light Stanford's men's cross-country team this
fall. Senior Bill Graham and junior Jim Smith
will be the experience on an otherwise youthful
team. Sophomore Brian Pettingill. a national
contender in the mile during track season,
should also occupy one of the five "starting"
spots on the team. Star recruits will be freshmen
Charles Alexander, Mark Schrage, and Ryan
Stoll. If the Card can stay away from injuries to
key runners, it should have the depth to re
alistically compete for the southern Pac-10 title.
CROSS COUNTRY,
WOMEN'S
Coach: Brooks Johnson
I ast Season: 3rd in NCA \
Conference: Western Collegiate Athletic As
sociation (WCAA)
Stanford's women's cross country team can
do nothing but improve in '82. No one gradu
ated from 1981 's squad, while the Card ac
quired some talented recruits in the spring.
Sophomore Regina Jacobs and junior Ellen
Lyons have recovered from injuries that forced
them out of action last year. It all adds up to a
legitimate NCAA title contender. Returnees in

clude team captain Kim Schnurpfeil and Ceci
Hopp, the NCAA's 1982 10,000 and 3.000
meter champions, respectively. Junior Pattisue
Plumer and sophomore Ann Locke both are
potential All-Americans this fall. Coach
Brooks Johnson's prize recruit is Alison Wiley,
who finished 10th at the World Cross Country
Championships in Italy and who should make
the Cardinal a good bet to take the NCAAs this
November. Stanford will compete in the newly
formed WCAA in 1982. probably the most
competitive conference in the nation.
FENCING
Coach: Ed "Buzz" Hurst
Last Season: 5-2, 2nd in NorCal
Conference: Independent
Home Facility: Roble Gymnasium
Rookies and veterans will combine to give
Stanford's fencing team the potential to qualify
for all events in the NCAA Championships this
season.For the men. coach Buz/. Hurst has both
returning players and promising recruits in all
three fencing events — sabers, foils and epees. A
few examples: Senior Howard Cash, ranked
17th in the nation last year, will be backed by
freshman Andy Gorman in the saber division.
In the foil competition, the deepest area for the
Card, sophomore David Sherman heads a list
of experienced players who will battle for start
ing positions with freshman Eliot Chew. Nik
Blcvins, a junior, was 16th in the NCAA and
fourth in the junior Olympics a year ago will be
joined in the epee category by Harvey Kain.
Heading the women's team will be seniors
Pam Henck and Cathy Correa, two players who
starting fencing in classes at Stanford.
Sophomore Alison Reid and recruit Jennifer

Yu will add depth to the squad. The Card
fencers will face their toughest schedule ever
this season because they are independent for the
first time, without a restricting league. Na
tionally-ranked San Jose State, the Cardinal's
rival in fencing, top a list of extremely com
petitive teams.
FIELD HOCKEY
Coach: Onnie Killefer
Last Season: 6-5-3
Conference: NorCal
Home Facility: Roble Field
Coach Onnie Killefer is calling Stanford's
1982 field hockey season "challenging" with
good reason: seven players from last year's
squad will not play for the Farm this fall. The
six graduates include Andrea Welsh, Claudia
Gold and goalie Cecca Freccero. But the sev
enth loss may be the most serious. Junior Patsv
Huntington, a member of the junior national
team last year, will sit out the '82 campaign due

to an injury. That leaves the Cardinal to rest its
hopes on senior Becky Howell, both an ex
cellent defender and scorer. Besides Howell,
Killeler's troops will consist of team players
rather than outstanding individuals. Although
Stanford's tough schedule includes San Jose
Stale, Cal, UOP and fourth ranked Long Beach
State, improvement because of summer train
ing should help the Card meet the challenge.

FOOTBALL
Coach: Paul Wiggin
Last Season: 4-7
Conference: Pacific-10
Home Facility: Stanford Stadium
Stanford's always unpredictable football
team will enter the football season confronting
fans with yet another mystery. Suffering a dis
appointing 4-7 season last year, the team hopes
to become a part of the Rose Howl picture. Sen
ior All-America quarterback and Heisman
Trophy candidate John Elway returns and will
lead w hat should be one of the nations most po
tent passing attacks. Vincent White replaces the
irreplacable Darrin Nelson in the halfback
position. White, who runs like a Nelson clone,
is expected to keep the running game strong and
could he one of the surprises in the Pac-10. Jun
ior receiver Mike Tolliver leads an experienced
receiving crew and Chris Dressel returns for his
fourth year at the tight end position. The de
fense which ranked last in the Pac-10 against the
pass last year will try to get back on track with
All-America candidate Vaughn Williams
switching from strong to free safety this year.
Other defensive standouts include sophomore
noseguard Terry Jackson, junior tackle John
Bergren and sophomore linebacker Garin Ver
is. Junior Mark Harmon returns for the kicking
duties and should rank as one of the nations
best kickers. Still, question marks remain. Al
though the offense should be one of the nation's
best, the defense is still untested and depth is a
problem, especially on the offensive line.

GOLF, MEN'S
Coach: Tim Schaaf
Last Season: Sth in Pac-10
Conference: Pacific-10
Home Facility: Stanford Golf Course
Men's golf coach Tim Schaaf will be examin
ing swings and scorecards closer than ever
before come fall practice. Last year's regulars
Tad Buchanan, David Gamesand Neil Rob
inson have graduated, leaving the starting spots
on the Card's golf roster a wide open race. At
least ten individuals will vie for a postion on the
six-man starting team with one possible excep
tion — Josh Mondry. The Card sophomore was
Stanford's sole representative in the NCAA
championships while leading Stanford with a
74.X stroke average during the spring. The top
contenders for the other five places are senior
John Scanlon, juniors Tim Robinson, Lanny
Sawchuck, Lew Dickey and Doug Thompson
and sophomore Scott Erickson, all of which

saw action last season. Freshmen Carl Wagner
and Don Walsworth may also challenge for
playing time. After a decent showing last
fall.the male linksters faltered in the spring,
eventually taking fifth at the Pac-10 cham
pionships: a third place finish would have quali
fied the Card for the NCAAs. But if Shaaf can
make heads of tails this fall, the Card very well
may he in the thick of things come spring.

GOLF, WOMEN'S
Coach: Tim Baldwin
Last Season: 6th in NCAA
Conference: Western Collegiate Athletic n
Association (WCAA)
Home Facility: Stanford Golf Course
Stanford's women's golf team should be
about the same this season as last season, a
compliment. Under the fourth year tutelage of
mentor Tim Baldwin, the Card has landed two
talented recruits to fill the hole left by the gradu
ation of Lori Castillo and Debbie Barbario.
Kathy Kostas, Golf Magazine's No.I junior
female golfer in the country, and Julie
Carmichael will arrive on the scene this fall.
Kostas will team with sophomore standout
Diane Nixon, junior Kathy Nino, and senior
Joanne Pacillo to give the Card a NCAA con
tending squad with only one question mark —
depth. Hopefully, either Carmichael and senior
Roxy Gumlia will ablely fill the fifth spot on the
roster and provide the Cardinal with
'"'that missing dimension. Last season, Stanford
got off to a painfully slow start, one that threat
ened their even qualifying for the NCAA
Championships, which were held on the Stan
ford Golf Course last spring. But strong outings
late in the season, especially by Nixon, enabled
Baldwin and Co. not only to qualify for the
NCAAs, but place sixth though seeded 13th.
The Card's biggest fall tournament is the Stan
lord Fall Intercollegiate, an event it won two
years ago.

GYMNASTICS, MEN'S
Coach: Sadao Hamada
Last Season: sth in Pac-10
Conference: Pac-10
Home Facility: Maples Pavilion
An excellent recruiting year and unproved re
turning athletes make up what coach Sadao
Hamada calls the "strongest year ever" for the
Stanford men's gymnastics program. Seniors
Kirk Druey and Brian Nelson and junior Jim
Campanelli form the basis of the Hamada's
eleventh Cardinal team. Freshmen recruits Jon
Levy and Gary Smith will provide the Card
with needed depth. Although all-arounders,
both Levy and Smith specialize in the floor ex
ercise: Levy also has high marks in the rings,
while Smith excels at vaulting. If injuries do not
factor in the team's performance as they did last
year. Hamada believes the Card has a realistic
chance at the qualifying for the NCAAs.
GYMNASTICS, WOMEN'S
Coach: TBA
Last Season: 9-3, NorC'al champs
Conference: Western Collegiate Athletic
Association (WCAA)
Home Facility: Maples Pavilion
The 1982-83 version of Stanford's women's
gymnastics squad will not be all Merilyn Chap
man as much as her amazing stats make it ap
pear. The nationally-ranked junior will have a
strong supporting cast this season featuring a
mixture of returning and incoming gymnasts.
Top Card recruit is all-arounder Dell
Wilkinson will be joined by three promising
walk-ons. Senior Karen Hall will return in
'82-83. after redshirting last year. In '80-81.
Hall's all-around average of 34.68 was second
only to Chapman's. Senior Kim Strauss and
sophomore Angie Barnes will also return, pro
viding needed experience and depth. Ihe
Cardinal was not able to reach its potential last
season because of coaching complications. But
if the new women's coach can keep things under
control, 1982-83 could prove to be the first year
that Stanford can send both its gymnastics
teams to the NCAA championships.

Todd Lincoln. David Sims. Bari Wieck and
Sam Worden. The backstroke, breaststroke
and individual medleys and al three relays will
all be the Cardinal's strongest events; if a
weakness exists, it's in the sprints, specifically
the 50 and 100 free. Sprints or no sprints, the
only team that should have the ability to stop
Stanford from winning its first NCAA title is
defending NCAA champ Texas. The Long
horns will join the Cardinal and the other top
four teams in the nation in late January at SVIU
for a meet sponsored by the Dallas Morn

TRACK, MEN'S
Coach: Brooks Johnson
Last Season: 6-6
Conference: Pacific-10
Home Facility: Stanford Stadium
The key to Stanford's men's track team in
148.1 is the development of the more youthful
members of this year's squad. Freshmen like
J.P. Holland. Brian Pettingill. Shaun Pickering,
Ciarin Veris and Freddy Williams give the
Cardinal a base from which to build future
teams. And Stanford can do nothing but im
pro\e on last season's tenth place finish in the
highly competitive Pac-10 —a conference that
featured six of the nation's lop ten dual meet
teams at the beginning of the 1981 campaign.
Holland is a triple and long jumper who also
contributes in the relays, while Pettingill was
perhaps the best freshman distance middle dis
tance runner in the country last spring. Pick
ering and Veris. a starting football player in the
tall, .ire national contenders in the hammer
throw and the shot put. respectively. Hopefully,
coach Brooks Johnson will be able to find some
support for Williams in the sprints, by far the
Card's weakest track department. Though the
Card has a good foundation on which to build,
it is still two or three solid recruiting years away
from being a serious Pac-10 contender.

TRACK, WOMEN'S

nationally-ranked freshmen Ceci Hopp and
Sloan Burton, sophomores I lien Lyons and
Pattisue Plumber and junior Kim Schnurpfeil.
However, in 19X2. Burton's season was can
celled due to a foot injury and the full prowess
of Stanford's distance runners was not on ex

theCard will havea pair of returning stars in the
weight events. Carol Cady and Mary Osborne.
Stanford women's 800 meter record holder Re
gina Jacobs will only be a sophomore this sea
son while sprinter and jumper Pam Donald has
yet another year of elgibility. As is the case with
the men's team, the women will lack depth, let

fact that the Lady Card tracksters lost no one to
graduation, they can do nothing but improve
and come away with a fine showing in the brand

Lauchner and Dan Parr and freshman Jon
Root, one of the top recruits in the nation. The
latter three were members of the ten-man Na

mer. Parr. Reagan and Root are all middle
blockers and thus Parr or Root might be moved
to an outside hitter position. The Cardinal will
try to gain a berth in the NCAA regionals in
19X3. but first they must deal with the CIV A. by
far the toughest conference in the country.
Teams like UCLA, USC and UCSB. all with

Fver since gaining varsity status six years
ago, women's volleyball at Stanford has steadi
ly improved. Unfortunately, the Card may have
peaked last season with a 32-14 record and a
fifth place NCAA finish. After losing three

starters, coach Fred Sturm is looking for
players to fill in as well as ways to win in the
Card's competitive new league, the WCAA,
touted as the top conference in the nation. Sen
iors Deanna Boyette, J.J. Gearhart and Kisi
I lame provide Stanford with experience while
K ari Rush Julie Baker, Margaret Grove. Susan
Compton. Brandace Hope, Lisa Murphv.
Diedra Dvorak and Jodv Freeman give the
Cardinal depth. One of the top recruits in the
country. Kim Oden, who played in the National
Sports Festival last summer, will also challenge
lor a starting role. Though depth should not he
a factor, finding a potent starting unit will. The
talent is there, hut the chemistry is missing. The
WCAA should prove to he a big test for Sturm's
troops, with a line-up that one would only ex
pect to find at the NCAA Championships. Top
20 teams like UCLA and USC head the new
women's conference, making the Card's sched
ule much more demanding than in past seasons.
WATER POLO
Coach: Dante Dettamanti
Last Season: 31-0, NCAA champs
Conference: Pacific-10
Home Facility: DeGuerre Pool
An NCAA championship and a 31-0 record
will he hard to duplicate in 1982, but coach
Dante Dettamanti is not selling his team short
even though a big chunk last year's team fell
pre\ to graduation. Senior John Bergeson.who
last year was the NCAA's most prolific goal
scorer. will lead the charge that could possibly
end in the Card's fifth NCAA crown in seven
years. Six-year coach Dettamanti sees his '82
squad not as the best in the nation as it was a
year ago, but as a "contender."
UC Irvine. UCLA, Cal and USC pose as the
Card's four toughest opponents on a rugged
West Coast schedule, one that most likely will
take it toll in the form of defeats. But if the

team's question marks answer themselves
positively over the course of the season, Stan
lord could escape with less than five losses.
WRESTLING
Coach: Chris Horpel
Last Season: 5-6, sth in Pac-10
Conference: Pacific-10
Home Facility: Maples Pavilion
Alter being reinstated as a Stanford varsity
sport just three years ago, the Card wrestling
team has a chance at being a Pac-10 contender
in the 19X2-83 campaign. Coach Chris Horpel
will rest his hopes on fifth-year senior Doug
Perkins, junior I om Mullen and sophomore fcd
Katz. Perkins placed second in the Pac-10 last
season and is an early favorite to capture the
league title in the 177-pound weight class this
year. Stanford's strength in '82-83 will again lie
in the upper weights, while a lack of depth is the
biggest problem the Card will wrestle this sea
son. The Pac-10 will feature a pair of national
powerhouses in the "82-83 season: Arizona
State and Oregon. San Jose State will also be a
thorn in Stanford's schedule, one that is much
tougher than the easier Nor Cal schedule that
the Cardinal could play in place of the Pac-10.
I he ( ard will face its Pac-10 foes in a dual-meet
format for the first time ir) Stanford history.

To put it simply, graduation and the pro draft
were not kind to the Cardinal over the summer.
At Commencement, the Farm bid farewell to
third baseman Loring Davies (.346. 45 RBI),
shortstop Bob DeCosta (.308. 44 RBI. 19 2B).
catcher Bob Hausladen (.301, 8 HR. 53 RBI),
right fielder M ike Tooth man (.258,41 RBI) and
pitchers Mike Sullivan (3-2) and Brian
Mignano (14-6. 68 SO. 13 complete games). It
gets worse. Via the pro draft, the Card said
good-bye to the eligiblitv of senior Steve Bue
chele (.354. 27 RBI) and top recruit Kenny Wil
liams. What's left of the 49-18-1 team, junior
Greg Loren/etti and seniors Mike Dotterer
(.359). Mike Aldrete, Eric Hardgraveand Dar
r\l Stephens, will solidify the outfield and first
base. But Marquess will be searching for a new
catcher, second baseman, short stop and third
baseman come the '83 season. Unlike past
Cardinal clubs, the experienced pitching staff
w ill be the strong point on the team, since it was
not hit hard by the pro draft. Although No. I
hurler Mignano is gone, a strong starting and
relief crew return, including junior Brian
Meyers (8-2) and sophomore sensations David
Harris (7-0, 3.25) and Greg Ballard (7-4, 61 SO
in 91 IP). On offense. Stanford will not hit for
averages as much as it will for power in '83 to go
along with good team speed. Marquess' biggest
chores w ill be filling the infield holes and keep
ing a youthful team away from injuries. A sec

pearance is not definite, but by the same token
not out of the question.

BASKETBALL, MEN'S

Last Season: 7-20

Although brilliant former Boston College
coach Tom Davis has arrived on the scene, his
debut season may be spoiled by a glaring lack of
talent and depth. Injuries have laid waste to

what might he a decent '82-83 squad and a poor
recruiting year has not improved the situation.

Rogers, Pac-10 Rookie of the Year in 81-82,
and Roger Lemons "highly doubtful." accord
ing to Davis. Junior forward Hans Wichary is
still recovering from a foot stress fracture that
sidelined him for the better part of last season.
The onl> bright spot in the Cardinal's line-up
seems to be forward center John Revelli. First
Team All-Pac-IO last season as a sophomore,
leading the Card in scoring (16.4) and rebound
ing (8.6). At 6-8, 220 pounds, Revelli appears to
be the Card's only legitimate threat inside, un
less 6-10 senior David Nussbaumcan drasticaly
improve his '81-82 stats — 1.6 ppg and 1.1 rpg.
At guard, junior Keith Jones, who sat out last
season for academic reasons, and returning

c
starter sophomore Steve Brown are question
able as to v\ hether they will be a potent team. Of
the four new recruits, only junior transfer guard
Ricky Lewis and forward Eric Koberlein
should make an immediate contribution.
Nevertheless, the '82-83 campaign should
prove to he an exciting one with Davis at the
helm. Win or lose, slow or fast team, Davis
plans to run and press the entire game. And
with a 57.50 for 18 games student season ticket
package, the team should be fun, let alone <
cheap to watch, although losses will most likely
outnumber wins in the highlv competitive
Pac-10.

II coach Dotti McCrea can buy some ex
perience for her backcourt, the Card will once
again field a fine women's basketball team that
could equal or better last season's 19-8 mark
and an berth in the NCAA post-season tour
nament. Guards Angie Paccione, Sarah Miller
and Debbie Gore have all left the Farm via
graduation, leaving the Cardinal with youth in
the backcourt. Nevertheless, in returning for
wards Meg Metzger and Jeanne Ruark Hoffthe
Card has a pair of potential 20-point per game
stars. If Met/ger can stay out of foul trouble,
her nemesis last season, she could very well be
one of the top players on the West Coast, ac
cording to McCrea. To deepen Stanford's front
line even further, McCrea has recruited 6-2 cen

immediate contribution. One change in the.
l l )82-83 season from last year will be a bit
slower st\le of play, one that will take full ad

light Stanford's men's cross-country team this
fall. Senior Bill Graham and junior Jim Smith
will be the experience on an otherwise youthful
team. Sophomore Brian Pettingill. a national
contender in the mile during track season,
should also occupy one of the five "starting"
spots on the team. Star recruits will be freshmen
Charles Alexander, Mark Schrage, and Ryan
Stoll. If the Card can stay away from injuries to
key runners, it should have the depth to re
alistically compete for the southern Pac-10 title.
CROSS COUNTRY,
WOMEN'S
Coach: Brooks Johnson

Conference: Western Collegiate Athletic As

Stanford's women's cross country team can
do nothing but improve in '82. No one gradu
ated from 1981 's squad, while the Card ac
quired some talented recruits in the spring.
Sophomore Regina Jacobs and junior Ellen
Lyons have recovered from injuries that forced
them out of action last year. It all adds up to a
legitimate NCAA title contender. Returnees in

clude team captain Kim Schnurpfeil and Ceci
Hopp, the NCAA's 1982 10,000 and 3.000
meter champions, respectively. Junior Pattisue
Plumer and sophomore Ann Locke both are
potential All-Americans this fall. Coach
Brooks Johnson's prize recruit is Alison Wiley,
who finished 10th at the World Cross Country
Championships in Italy and who should make
the Cardinal a good bet to take the NCAAs this
November. Stanford will compete in the newly
formed WCAA in 1982. probably the most
competitive conference in the nation.
FENCING
Coach: Ed "Buzz" Hurst
Last Season: 5-2, 2nd in NorCal
Conference: Independent
Home Facility: Roble Gymnasium
Rookies and veterans will combine to give
Stanford's fencing team the potential to qualify
for all events in the NCAA Championships this
season.For the men. coach Buz/. Hurst has both
returning players and promising recruits in all
three fencing events — sabers, foils and epees. A
few examples: Senior Howard Cash, ranked
17th in the nation last year, will be backed by
freshman Andy Gorman in the saber division.
In the foil competition, the deepest area for the
Card, sophomore David Sherman heads a list
of experienced players who will battle for start
ing positions with freshman Eliot Chew. Nik
Blcvins, a junior, was 16th in the NCAA and
fourth in the junior Olympics a year ago will be
joined in the epee category by Harvey Kain.
Heading the women's team will be seniors
Pam Henck and Cathy Correa, two players who
starting fencing in classes at Stanford.
Sophomore Alison Reid and recruit Jennifer

Yu will add depth to the squad. The Card
fencers will face their toughest schedule ever
this season because they are independent for the
first time, without a restricting league. Na
tionally-ranked San Jose State, the Cardinal's
rival in fencing, top a list of extremely com
petitive teams.
FIELD HOCKEY
Coach: Onnie Killefer
Last Season: 6-5-3
Conference: NorCal
Home Facility: Roble Field
Coach Onnie Killefer is calling Stanford's
1982 field hockey season "challenging" with
good reason: seven players from last year's
squad will not play for the Farm this fall. The
six graduates include Andrea Welsh, Claudia
Gold and goalie Cecca Freccero. But the sev
enth loss may be the most serious. Junior Patsv
Huntington, a member of the junior national
team last year, will sit out the '82 campaign due

to an injury. That leaves the Cardinal to rest its
hopes on senior Becky Howell, both an ex
cellent defender and scorer. Besides Howell,
Killeler's troops will consist of team players
rather than outstanding individuals. Although
Stanford's tough schedule includes San Jose
Stale, Cal, UOP and fourth ranked Long Beach
State, improvement because of summer train
ing should help the Card meet the challenge.

FOOTBALL
Coach: Paul Wiggin
Last Season: 4-7
Conference: Pacific-10
Home Facility: Stanford Stadium
Stanford's always unpredictable football
team will enter the football season confronting
fans with yet another mystery. Suffering a dis
appointing 4-7 season last year, the team hopes
to become a part of the Rose Howl picture. Sen
ior All-America quarterback and Heisman
Trophy candidate John Elway returns and will
lead w hat should be one of the nations most po
tent passing attacks. Vincent White replaces the
irreplacable Darrin Nelson in the halfback
position. White, who runs like a Nelson clone,
is expected to keep the running game strong and
could he one of the surprises in the Pac-10. Jun
ior receiver Mike Tolliver leads an experienced
receiving crew and Chris Dressel returns for his
fourth year at the tight end position. The de
fense which ranked last in the Pac-10 against the
pass last year will try to get back on track with
All-America candidate Vaughn Williams
switching from strong to free safety this year.
Other defensive standouts include sophomore
noseguard Terry Jackson, junior tackle John
Bergren and sophomore linebacker Garin Ver
is. Junior Mark Harmon returns for the kicking
duties and should rank as one of the nations
best kickers. Still, question marks remain. Al
though the offense should be one of the nation's
best, the defense is still untested and depth is a
problem, especially on the offensive line.

GOLF, MEN'S
Coach: Tim Schaaf
Last Season: Sth in Pac-10
Conference: Pacific-10
Home Facility: Stanford Golf Course
Men's golf coach Tim Schaaf will be examin
ing swings and scorecards closer than ever
before come fall practice. Last year's regulars
Tad Buchanan, David Gamesand Neil Rob
inson have graduated, leaving the starting spots
on the Card's golf roster a wide open race. At
least ten individuals will vie for a postion on the
six-man starting team with one possible excep
tion — Josh Mondry. The Card sophomore was
Stanford's sole representative in the NCAA
championships while leading Stanford with a
74.X stroke average during the spring. The top
contenders for the other five places are senior
John Scanlon, juniors Tim Robinson, Lanny
Sawchuck, Lew Dickey and Doug Thompson
and sophomore Scott Erickson, all of which

saw action last season. Freshmen Carl Wagner
and Don Walsworth may also challenge for
playing time. After a decent showing last
fall.the male linksters faltered in the spring,
eventually taking fifth at the Pac-10 cham
pionships: a third place finish would have quali
fied the Card for the NCAAs. But if Shaaf can
make heads of tails this fall, the Card very well
may he in the thick of things come spring.

GOLF, WOMEN'S
Coach: Tim Baldwin
Last Season: 6th in NCAA
Conference: Western Collegiate Athletic n
Association (WCAA)
Home Facility: Stanford Golf Course
Stanford's women's golf team should be
about the same this season as last season, a
compliment. Under the fourth year tutelage of
mentor Tim Baldwin, the Card has landed two
talented recruits to fill the hole left by the gradu
ation of Lori Castillo and Debbie Barbario.
Kathy Kostas, Golf Magazine's No.I junior
female golfer in the country, and Julie
Carmichael will arrive on the scene this fall.
Kostas will team with sophomore standout
Diane Nixon, junior Kathy Nino, and senior
Joanne Pacillo to give the Card a NCAA con
tending squad with only one question mark —
depth. Hopefully, either Carmichael and senior
Roxy Gumlia will ablely fill the fifth spot on the
roster and provide the Cardinal with
'"'that missing dimension. Last season, Stanford
got off to a painfully slow start, one that threat
ened their even qualifying for the NCAA
Championships, which were held on the Stan
ford Golf Course last spring. But strong outings
late in the season, especially by Nixon, enabled
Baldwin and Co. not only to qualify for the
NCAAs, but place sixth though seeded 13th.
The Card's biggest fall tournament is the Stan
lord Fall Intercollegiate, an event it won two
years ago.

GYMNASTICS, MEN'S

An excellent recruiting year and unproved re
turning athletes make up what coach Sadao
Hamada calls the "strongest year ever" for the
Stanford men's gymnastics program. Seniors
Kirk Druey and Brian Nelson and junior Jim
Campanelli form the basis of the Hamada's
eleventh Cardinal team. Freshmen recruits Jon
Levy and Gary Smith will provide the Card
with needed depth. Although all-arounders,
both Levy and Smith specialize in the floor ex
ercise: Levy also has high marks in the rings,
while Smith excels at vaulting. If injuries do not
factor in the team's performance as they did last
year. Hamada believes the Card has a realistic
chance at the qualifying for the NCAAs.
GYMNASTICS, WOMEN'S
Coach: TBA
Last Season: 9-3, NorC'al champs
Conference: Western Collegiate Athletic
Association (WCAA)
Home Facility: Maples Pavilion
The 1982-83 version of Stanford's women's
gymnastics squad will not be all Merilyn Chap
man as much as her amazing stats make it ap
pear. The nationally-ranked junior will have a
strong supporting cast this season featuring a
mixture of returning and incoming gymnasts.
Top Card recruit is all-arounder Dell
Wilkinson will be joined by three promising
walk-ons. Senior Karen Hall will return in
'82-83. after redshirting last year. In '80-81.
Hall's all-around average of 34.68 was second
only to Chapman's. Senior Kim Strauss and
sophomore Angie Barnes will also return, pro
viding needed experience and depth. Ihe
Cardinal was not able to reach its potential last
season because of coaching complications. But
if the new women's coach can keep things under
control, 1982-83 could prove to be the first year
that Stanford can send both its gymnastics
teams to the NCAA championships.

and individual medleys and al three relays will
all be the Cardinal's strongest events; if a
weakness exists, it's in the sprints, specifically
the 50 and 100 free. Sprints or no sprints, the
only team that should have the ability to stop
Stanford from winning its first NCAA title is
defending NCAA champ Texas. The Long

four teams in the nation in late January at SVIU

The key to Stanford's men's track team in

members of this year's squad. Freshmen like
J.P. Holland. Brian Pettingill. Shaun Pickering,
Ciarin Veris and Freddy Williams give the
Cardinal a base from which to build future
teams. And Stanford can do nothing but im
pro\e on last season's tenth place finish in the
highly competitive Pac-10 —a conference that
featured six of the nation's lop ten dual meet
teams at the beginning of the 1981 campaign.
Holland is a triple and long jumper who also
contributes in the relays, while Pettingill was
perhaps the best freshman distance middle dis
tance runner in the country last spring. Pick
ering and Veris. a starting football player in the
tall, .ire national contenders in the hammer

Reagan, will combine with sophomores Craig

Lauchner and Dan Parr and freshman Jon
Root, one of the top recruits in the nation. The
latter three were members of the ten-man Na
tional Sports Festival West team over the sum
mer. Parr. Reagan and Root are all middle
blockers and thus Parr or Root might be moved
to an outside hitter position. The Cardinal will
try to gain a berth in the NCAA regionals in
19X3. but first they must deal with the CIV A. by
far the toughest conference in the country.
Teams like UCLA, USC and UCSB. all with
plenty of talent to win it all, are just a few ex
amples of what the Card will face. Though
Stanford w ill not have a tremendous amount of
depth, avoiding key injuries will keep it afloat in
the CIVA.
VOLLEYBALL, WOMEN'S
Coach: Fred Sturm
Last Season: 32-14, sth in NCAA
Conference: Western Collegiate Athletic
Association (WCAA)
Home Facility: Maples Pavilion
Fver since gaining varsity status six years
ago, women's volleyball at Stanford has steadi
ly improved. Unfortunately, the Card may have
peaked last season with a 32-14 record and a
fifth place NCAA finish. After losing three

starters, coach Fred Sturm is looking for
players to fill in as well as ways to win in the
Card's competitive new league, the WCAA,
touted as the top conference in the nation. Sen
iors Deanna Boyette, J.J. Gearhart and Kisi
I lame provide Stanford with experience while
K ari Rush Julie Baker, Margaret Grove. Susan
Compton. Brandace Hope, Lisa Murphv.
Diedra Dvorak and Jodv Freeman give the
Cardinal depth. One of the top recruits in the
country. Kim Oden, who played in the National
Sports Festival last summer, will also challenge
lor a starting role. Though depth should not he
a factor, finding a potent starting unit will. The
talent is there, hut the chemistry is missing. The
WCAA should prove to he a big test for Sturm's
troops, with a line-up that one would only ex
pect to find at the NCAA Championships. Top
20 teams like UCLA and USC head the new
women's conference, making the Card's sched
ule much more demanding than in past seasons.
WATER POLO
Coach: Dante Dettamanti
Last Season: 31-0, NCAA champs
Conference: Pacific-10
Home Facility: DeGuerre Pool
An NCAA championship and a 31-0 record
will he hard to duplicate in 1982, but coach
Dante Dettamanti is not selling his team short
even though a big chunk last year's team fell
pre\ to graduation. Senior John Bergeson.who
last year was the NCAA's most prolific goal
scorer. will lead the charge that could possibly
end in the Card's fifth NCAA crown in seven
years. Six-year coach Dettamanti sees his '82
squad not as the best in the nation as it was a
year ago, but as a "contender."
UC Irvine. UCLA, Cal and USC pose as the
Card's four toughest opponents on a rugged
West Coast schedule, one that most likely will
take it toll in the form of defeats. But if the

team's question marks answer themselves
positively over the course of the season, Stan
lord could escape with less than five losses.
WRESTLING
Coach: Chris Horpel
Last Season: 5-6, sth in Pac-10
Conference: Pacific-10
Home Facility: Maples Pavilion
Alter being reinstated as a Stanford varsity
sport just three years ago, the Card wrestling
team has a chance at being a Pac-10 contender
in the 19X2-83 campaign. Coach Chris Horpel
will rest his hopes on fifth-year senior Doug
Perkins, junior I om Mullen and sophomore fcd
Katz. Perkins placed second in the Pac-10 last
season and is an early favorite to capture the
league title in the 177-pound weight class this
year. Stanford's strength in '82-83 will again lie
in the upper weights, while a lack of depth is the
biggest problem the Card will wrestle this sea
son. The Pac-10 will feature a pair of national
powerhouses in the "82-83 season: Arizona
State and Oregon. San Jose State will also be a
thorn in Stanford's schedule, one that is much
tougher than the easier Nor Cal schedule that
the Cardinal could play in place of the Pac-10.
I he ( ard will face its Pac-10 foes in a dual-meet
format for the first time ir) Stanford history.
