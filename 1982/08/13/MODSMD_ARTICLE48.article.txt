Stanford sports teams are of
ficially recognized as the
t ardinal today. hut such univer
sal acceptance is a raritx in cam
pus athletics It's been a rough
history lor the I'niversitx sym
bol While cardinal has alxxays
been the school color, it was not
the mascot until last fall.
According to Don Carlson, di
rector of I ni\ersitv relations,
students here voted cardinal the
school color in 1592. one year af
ter the I'niversitx was founded.
\ local newspaper headline after
the first big game in 1K92. which
proclaimed "Cardinal triumphs

o'er Blue and Gold" cemented
the title, said Carlson
Students selected cardinal oxer
gold in a xigorous dispute settled
on the afternoon of the first big
game.
Students did not vote for the
controversial Indian mascot —
discontinued by President Rich
ard 1 yrnan in 11>72l l >72 as a result of
objections raised bx Native
\mericaiis — until I^3o
M ascots grexx in popularity
with the surge of radio in the
WOs. said ( arlson. In 1930,
Stanford students chose the Indi
an as Stanford's mascot the

first of manx. \nnouneers used
the terms Indians md Cardinals
interchaniieahlx Hut cardinal
has alxxaxs been the I'niversitx
color, and the Indian — repre
sented at Iviotball e.lines bx Chief
I ightl'oot — has nex er been more
than a mascot
W hen Pop W arner. an Indian,
coacheil here, his popularity and
approxal of the idea helped lead
to the adoption of the Indian
mascot. Warner, known as the
namesake for a dix ision of little
league football, had coached for
the ( arlisle Indiaiis.
I uis called I niversitv team

members the Red Men. as a re
sult of the color cardinal, said
Carlson. I his term led to the "red
man", the Indian.
During the *(>os. the Native
American community began to
resent the Indian mascot. It was
abandoned in a llurr> of con
troversy and Chief Lightfoot was
banned from Stanford Stadium
in l l >7:.
Since the ban of the Indian,
students have voted for several
I 'niversity mascots. The choices
m recent elections were Thunder
Chickens in 1972 and Robber
Barons in 1975. Later, the trees
won b\ a narrow margin. None

of these choices ever became the
official I'iliversit\ mascot, how
ever. since the Hoard ol I rustees
refused to adopt them.
However, when students
adopted the color cardinal as the
University mascot in a special
election held in October 1981, the
Board approved of the election
results.
The I 'niversitv is unique in the
Pacific-10 Conference, in which
six mammals, a bird, a Sun Devil,
and a military figure are repre
sented — but no color.
Finally, it's decided. The
cardinal is now the I niversitv
svmbol — and mascot.
