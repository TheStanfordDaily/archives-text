"His moves are analogous to

he continued. "He has good in
stincts. he can change directions
quicker than anyone and he has a
rocket of a shooting arm."
Adding to the polo charge is a
group of unproven talent: seniors
John Tanner. Greg Lambert,
(irant Hansen, Steve Jensen, Jeff
Stiling and underclassmen Steve

I.ampert and Mark Daly.
Tanner and Lambert will

continued. "I look for some

While the Card can attribute a
great deal of its success to tal

derance of the accolades must go
to the man behind-the-scenes —
coach Dante Dettamanti.
Dettamanti remembers well

however, he does not expect a re
