## Anniversary of construction marked After two decades, Berlin Wall is still as impassable 
### Greenwich Time 
Twenty-one years ago today, before
first light, workers heavily guarded by East
German People's Police began rolling out
barbed wire in a bird sanctuary on the
edge of Berlin, on the banks of the
Tegeler Fliess.
A few uncomprehending waitresses
from a nearby inn and night shift workers
who had jobs in the Western sector but
lived in the Eastern sector made a last trip
home in the early hours of that day, not
taking much notice of the barbed wire
being uncoiled in one street after anoth
er.
Some people gathered to watch the
process in anguish and bitter disbelief.
Some wept openly. By the end of the hot,
cloudless day, Berlin had been turned
into two cities with almost no ties left —
no telephone connections; no travel
from one side to the other, except for

those with government permission, or
who were passed in the exchange of cof
fins every Wednesday at the gap in the

bloodstains of those who
try (to escape).

wall at Heinrich Heine Strasse.
Through the years the wall has been
strengthened with more than 60 miles of
concrete slabs, 30 miles of metal railed
fence, drop gratings, arrester nets, an
empty and floodlit death strip, and other
devices that have all but stopped the peo
ple seeking to escape to the West. The
wall is whitewashed regularly to cover the
bloodstains of those who try.
Since the wall was built, 72 people have

been killed trying to get over it. An addi
tional 107 people have been killed trying
to escape elsewhere on the border.
For some in East Germany, however,
there is a way to the West, through a quiet
program of ransom paid by the West Ger
man government. According to the In
ternational Society for Human Rights,
based in the western sector, the West
Germans have bought freedom for more
than 18,000 political prisoners.
The ransom arrangements are secret
and inconsistent. Last year 30 political
prisoners were let out of East Germany in
a single transaction in exchange for the
release of Guenter Guillaume, an aide to
West German Chancellor Willy Brandt
who was accused of spying for East Ger
many.
For those who remain in East Germany
and complain, prison is almost inevitable.

For example, some East Germans were
sent to prison in 1978 for criticizing the in
troduction of "military studies" into the
high school curriculum, according to an
Amnesty International report. Others
were imprisoned for criticizing new re
strictions imposed on writers in the sum
mer of 1979.
"... prisoners have reported being
told that speedy confession will lead to
remission of sentence, that failure to an
swer questions may result in the arrest of
relatives or friends, or that their (the pris
oners') children may be taken into state
care," the Amnesty International report
says.
A West Berlin organization — the Au
gust 13 Working Group — estimates that a
relatively constant 4500 political prisoners
remain in East German jails, despite the
ransoming.
