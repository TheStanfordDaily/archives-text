## Card hoop no longer a laughing matter 
### Mark Zeigler 
'Coaching is a
weird profession.
It isn't for
everybody. It's
something that
only a few people
fit into.'

All nightmares must come to
an end sometime.
But sometime was not soon
enough for Stanford's Athletic
Department when it began
searching for a new basketball
coach last spring. After seven
years of losing records, including
a 7-20 mark last season that
drove former Card basketball
coach Dick Dißiaso to resigna
tion, it was time to end the bad
dream — and soon.
Athletic Director Andy Geiger
and company sought the nation's
No. I nightmare-killer: Boston
College coach Tom Davis. They
got him.

But Davis, nicknamed "Dr.
Tom" because he has a Ph.D. in
history, is making no promises
heading into the 1982-83 season
and well he shouldn't. A virtually
non-existant recruiting year, in
juries and graduation have left
the Cardinal with a team short on
height, speed and, above all, tal
ent.
"A coach is only as good as his
talent," Davis is quick to point
out. And unless some key players
recover from some serious in
juries, basketball talent is one in
gredient that will be hard to find
on the Farm.
None of this is new to Dr.
Tom, however. In 1977, Davis
took the reins of an 8-18 Boston
College club. A year later, the
Kagles were 15-11. Three years
later, Boston College and Davis
were 7 points short of reaching
the Final Four in the NCAA's
post-season tournament.
Now in 1982 it's back to the
drawing board for Davis, only
this time at a different school in a
different league on the other side
of the country.
"I think people want basket
ball to hold up its end of that
whole competitive spectrum,"
Davis said. This school is so
good in so many different sports
that I think its going to be in

teresting to find out if basketball
can be among them."
Step one on the road to re
covery is to make the best of what
does not promise to be one of
Stanford's more memorable sea
sons. Davis plans to implement
an entirely new system, one that
he feels will please player and fan
alike.
"We're definitely going to run.
There is no question of that,"
Davis said without batting an
eyelash. "Every time we get the
ball we're going to go with it. We
are going to get the ball and our
men to the other end of the court
as quickly as we possibly can.
"We'll also press for 40
minutes," the new Card coach
continued. "We'll put constant
pressure on the opposition."
Such a strategy was not seen in
Maples Pavilion during the
Dißiaso era, but for a good rea
son — the Cardinal simply did
not have the necessary size and
speed. And unless some Carl
Lewises or Stanley Floyds
transfer to Stanford between now
and the start of basketball sea
son, the 1982-X3 version of the
Card will be in much the same
vein as Dißiaso teams.
So what, says Dr. Tom. "As we
get quicker, taller, better players,
then this style is even more effec
tive. But it can be done with less
than great quickness and some
thing less than great size as a
strategy and philosophy of play,"
he explained.
"I know some of them (Card
players) aren't built to play this
style, but I don't see that they
have any choice," he said.
"That's the way we want to do
it."
How about when Stanford
goes up against such Pac-10 pow
erhouses as UCLA? Won't Davis
and Company play a slow-down,
stalling type game in hopes of up
setting the Bruins? No way. "We
will not hold the ball (against
UCLA). We will press and we
will fast break and we will not
change our strategy," Davis in
sisted.
"If we lose, we're going to lose
pressing and running. We're not
going to lose sitting back and

playing a slower style," he re
iterated. "Its just the way I enjoy
coaching. I hope it's the way the
fans enjoy watching it."
Such a strategy in the highly
competitive Pac-10 underlies
Davis 1 entire coaching philoso
phy. When reconstructing a
basketball program at the univer
sity level, he believes the new
coach should not bring with him
a set of ideas, but a complete sys
tem that can be adjusted to indi
vidual players.
"The 'secret' of coaching, if
there is one, is to figure out what
talent you have and fit them into
your system of play," he said.
"You make adjustments to the
individual differences, but you
make them within your philoso
phy of play. You don't change
your philosophy of play from
year to year."
Another advantage to a style
of play that utilizes all 94 feet of
the court is its high excitement
level, something that keeps a fan
returning game after game, win
or lose. And the one group of
fans Davis would most like to
have returning game after game
is the students.
In an effort to to so, Davis and
the Athletic Department have in
stituted perhaps the nation's
most lucrative student season
ticket package — 57.50 guaran
tees the holder a spot in the
courtside student section for all
18 home games.
The new Card mentor sees
basketball as a sport "easily iden
tified by the student, because you
can see the player up close and
recognize him physically. We
hope that the students will sup
port us enough to come out from
curiosity's standpoint. Once
they're in there (Maples Pavil
ion), its up to us to get them back.
"If we play terribly, I don't ex
pect anybody to come and see
us," Davis continued. "On the
other hand, if we play hard, I
know people will come back."
According to Davis, his run
and press philosophy has its
roots in his high school coaching
days in the mid-west during the
mid-1960'5. Before that, his first
coaching experience was at

Camp Wakanda, a summer camp
on the shores of Lake Mendoda
near Madison. Wisconsin. Davis,
then attending University of Wis
consin, set up a basketball pro
gram in which he coached a team
that played against other camps
in the vicinity.
But il was at Wisconsin that he

was influenced the most. There
Davis lettered four times in
basketball under coach John
Barth, "a strict disciplinarian, a
sound fundamentalist and a great
teacher," he said. "I don't know
if I could even be in this pro
fession today without having
played for that man."

There are other influences. Dr.
Tom accredits his full court zone
press to former UCLA coach
John Wooden and his pressure
defense philosophy to Portland
Trailhla/ers mentor Jack
Ramsay. He also substitutes in a
similar fashion to Dean Smith,
coach of 1981 NCAA champs
North Carolina.
At Wiconsin, Davis received
both a B.A. in history and a mas
ter's in physical education. A few
years later, he entered the Uni
versity of Maryland in search of a
Ph.D. in history, temporarily
halting his coaching career. But
during his second and third years
in the doctorate program, Davis
was able to double as an assistant
basketball coach at Maryland.
Immediately Davis was exposed
to "eastern basketball" and had a
chance to "regroup" his
philosophies.
After completing his disserta
tion ("The Role of Sport and Ex
ercise in the Lives of Selected Co
lonial Americans, Massachusetts
and Virginia, 1700-1775"), Dr.
Tom became a full time coach.
"Coaching is a weird pro
fession," he said, looking back
on his 11-year college career. "It
isn't for everybody. Its some
thing that only a few people fit
into." _ S
Davis then put in time at
American University (two years)
and Lafayette College (six years)
before arriving at Boston Col
lege, where he definitely "fit in."
Dr. Tom compiled a 100-47
record with the Eagles, upping
his career mark to 216-91. In five
years with Boston College, he
chalked-up five winning seasons,
three of them 20-win campaigns,
and three appearances in post
