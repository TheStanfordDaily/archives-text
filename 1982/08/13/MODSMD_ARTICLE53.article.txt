THEATER 3
It is the richness of its theatrical world that prompts San

Franciscans to
compare themselves to
New Yorkers and
Parisians. The Bay
Area puts on a show
hard to equal on the
West Coast:
experimental,
traditional, Chekov,
Gilbert and Sullivan,
Euripedes. A guide to
the theaters, the ticket
agencies, the
companies. . .

THE ART WORLD 5
"It's especially hard for students (to take advantage of

museums because) they
spend too much time
just looking and
listening as it is, to get
excited at museums â€”
it's easier to stay awake
at the beach or 42nd
street." A guide to
revealing the art world
to students.

MUSIC 7
Music in the Bay Area is the hardest thing to pin down since

it includes "everything
from the San Francisco
Opera to the Keystone
Palo Alto . . . with
room in between for
Bach societies and
Rolling Stones in
Candlestick Park.

Q
MOVIES
Is the popcorn good? What is the sound system like? Are the

seats comfortable? A
review not of the
movies, but of the
theaters that show
them.
