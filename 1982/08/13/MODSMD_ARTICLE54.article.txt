Because of the
strange rules
that apply in
financing in the
arts, there are
only two ways to
survive in
theatre: to be
very small, or
very, very big.

What museums arc to Flor
ence, the theatre is for San Fran
cisco. No matter how much
people talk about the San Fran
cisco Opera or the city's night
clubs, it is the area's hundreds of
theatre groups that validate San
Francisco's claim to West Coast
cultural supremacy. The most
important activity takes place in
the many small theatres scat
tered around San Francisco and
Berkeley; the following account
starts closer to home, covering
campus and area theatre first,
then moving to the city's major
groups, and finally arriving at the
smaller venues.
The Stanford Drama Dept.
presents a major play each quar
ter, with productions usually tak
ing place in the Little Theater
behind Memorial Auditorium.
The productions are directed
and designed by members of the
department, but cast auditions
are open to the public, and stu
dents from fields other than
drama are often cast. The de
partment's 19N2-K3 plays will be
Turandot, or The Cover-Up
Congress, Bertolt Brecht's last
play (fall quarter); Euripides'
The Cyclops, adapted and di
rected by graduate student Rush
Rehm (winter quarter); Carib

bean Carnival, an outdoor musi
cal presented with the Commit
tee on Black Performing Arts
(spring quarter); and Kaufman
and Mart's Once in a Lifetime.

Palo Alto supports a couple of
theatre companies, one of which
has recently become a profes
sional group. I heafreworks.
which performs in the renovated
I ucie Stern Center theatre at
I >US Middlefield Road (near
Pnibarcadero), is entering its
second season after leaving the
Palo Alto Council for the Arts'
non profit structure. The group
has been very successful with its
mix ol sentimental musicals and
flashy premieres; its schedule
this season includes the Bay
Area premiere of St rider,
Oliver!, Ilw Wool gatherer
(another premiere) and The
Cheat White Hope. Smaller than
I'heatreworks. and with more of
a community theatre feel to it. is
the Palo \lto Players. The
Players also perform at Lucie
Stern Center, anil will open their
52nd season on the 24th with
Uomantu ( omeily hy Bernard
Slade, one of the many preten
ders to Neil Simon's throne as
the patron of American com
munity theatre.

Of the many other community
theatres in the towns surround
ing Stanford, the most interest
ing is probably the Millharn The
ater (1285 E. Hillsdale Blvd.
Foster City). which is opening its
43nd season with Deathtrap by
Ira Levin, and will go on to per
form Lock Up Your Daughters
and John Tobias' Is the Real You
Really You? this season.
Up until a couple of years ago,
the peninsula had its own major
repertory theater. But the de
mise of the California Actors
Theatre, which did rotating re
pertory out of theaters in Los
Gatos and Redwood City, left a
professional theatre gap. The
San Jose Repertory Company,
now in it-> third year, is trying to
till this gap. They will be present
ing a five-play season in the
Montgomery Theatre (Market
and San Carlos Streets,
downtown San Jose), opening
with Feydeau's Flea in Her Eat.
Another expanding company is
Los Gatos' Theater West. similar
to Theatrcworks in its name and
increasingly professional struc
ture. Theater West is opening its
six-play season with Bleacher
Hums, a nine-inning comedy that
was performed on campus last

spring.
The peninsula even has its own
Shakespeare festival. The Valley
Institute of Theatre Arts, head
quartered in Saratoga, has put on
a festival the last two summers,
with performances at the Paul
Masson Mountain Winery in
Saratoga. This summer, three
plays were performed through a
month-long season.
There is a huge gap, in San
Francisco and Berkeley profes
sional theatre, between the large
groups and the small groups. Be
cause of the strange rules that
apply in financing for the arts,
there are only two ways to sur
vive: to he very small, or very,
very big. This leads to another
dichotomy. The small theatres
can afford to be much more ad
venturous in their programming,
or to aim themselves at a specific
audience. The large theatres
have huge investments to pro
tect, and must attract as wide an
audience as possible; hence, they
are inherently conservative. And
there's one more difference, also
determined by economic consid
erations: there are, by most
standards, only three "large"
companies to describe, all three

of which we have; there are
many, many small companies,
the most important of which are
described thereafter.
The American Conservatory
Theater, or \CT. ranks with the
Guthrie Theatre in Minneapolis
as one of the country's best reg
ional theatres. Its presence in the
Geary Theatre, at 450 Geary in
San Francisco, makes Geary
Street the heart of the theatre
district. No company in the Bay
Area, or even on the West coast
(outside of Shakespearean festi
val groups) can rival the ACT in
performing talent, facilities, or
reputation. The ACT is an arch
conservative company: they go
heavy on the classics, with a
Chekhov and a Shakespeare
every year, and the modern
(meaning post-1920) plays they
do perform tend to be of the
sparkling-British-wit (Noel
Coward) or the folksy-American
(/ Remember Mama, Ah! Wil
derness) kind. But they are
nearly always a joy to watch, be
cause no one puts polish on a
production these days like the

ACT.
I'hc Berkeley Repertory
1 heatre keeps threatening to be
come an ACT clone: their
schedule this season, despite
opening with Brecht and Weill's
Happy End. is just as conserva
tive as the San Francisco corn
pain s. the main difference being
that Berkele> Rep is doing
Chekhov in Yalta instead of
Chekhov. Despite their slick
promotional efforts, though.
Berkeley Rep in person is much
less pretentious than the ACT.
Their theatre at 2205 Addison
St. is a marvel, both modern and
comfortable: it is a much nicer
place to see a play than the rather
baroque Geary.
The big money in San Fran
cisco theatre is tied up in Carole
Shorenstein's two "Best of
Broadway" series. "Best of
Broadway" plays in three diffe
rent theatres: the Golden Gate.
25 Taylor: the Orpheum. 1192
Market; and the Curran. 445
Geary (next door to the ACT).
The Golden Gate's season nor
mally runs through summer and
fall, but the theatre was dark for

most of the summer after an
early closing of Evita. The cur
rent production, running
through mid-November, is Lena
Home: The Lady and Her Music.
The fall season at the Orpheum
and Curran. already starting with
Donald O'Connor in Show Boat.
features Lauren Bacall in
Woman of the Year. Yul Brynner
in The King and I.and Sophisti
cated Ladies, a musical based on
the songs of Duke Ellington.
In addition to the repertory
and short-run groups and ven
ues, large and small, there are a
number of longer-running
shows. These are generally re
vues that are put on in small
theatres or clubs, and are often
sold out w ell ahead. Chief among
these are Beach Blanket Baby
lon. San Francisco's longest
running show, at Club Fugazi.
678 Green Street, and Dance Be
tween the Lines. at the Music
Hall Theater. 931 l.arkin.
Although it does not often re
ceive much publicity, the bulk of
the theatrical activity in San
Francisco is centered around the
smaller, semi-professional
theatres. It is here that most of
the local actors work, where the
local authors often have their
plays first performed, and where
the local technicians get to try
out their ideas.
They are often referred to as
the "99-seat" theatres since, by
limiting themselves to less than
one hundred seats, they can
avoid equity (i.e. union) pay
scales and thus mount new pro
ductions at relatively low cost.
The size of these theatres also
brings many benefits to the audi
ence. Spaces this small offer an
intimacy and intensity that is al
most never attained in a large
theatre. There is often no ex
travagant stage; sometimes just a
space on the floor surrounded by
seats. The traditional distance
between audience and per
former can be almost completely
wiped out. emphasizing the -
"live" aspects which give theatre
its unique excitement.
Another advantage of the
small size is that writers and di
rectors are offered a great deal of
flexibility. The risks of mounting
a production are not so great,
and experimentation is common.
Another important feature is
that the theatres can specialize
— only producing plays with cer-
I tain themes, or plays connected

with some social or political
group.
Trying to describe this aspect
of San Francisco theatre can he
difficult since companies can sur
face and then disappear quickly.
There are a number of theatres,
however, which have become an
established part of the city's cul
tural life. Even if it omits the
more volatile companies, a de
scription of their work should
give an impression of the vitality
of small theatre in the Bay Area.
The Magic Theatre is the best
known of the small theatres in
San Francisco, thanks in part to
its resident playwright, Sam
Shepard. Shepard has premiered

many of his more recent plays at
the Magic, including True West
and Buried Child (which won the
Pulitzer Prize in 1979).
The Magic specializes in new
plays by contemporary playw
rights. and often stages experi
mental theatre pieces by perfor
mance artists. They have strong
ties to contemporary German
and Austrian theatre via their
dramaturg, Stanford drama pro
fessor Martin Esslin.
The fall season starts Sep
tember 29 with Sand Castles by
Adele Edling Shank. Shank is
also in residence this year with
the Magic, and is one of eight
winners of a Rockefeller Found

a tion award.
The Magic Theatre has two
stages located in Building D at
Fort Mason. More information,
as well as reservations, can be
obtained by calling 441-8822.
The Julian Theatre specializes
in plays dealing with current
events and contemporary social
issues. In addition, their produc
tions are usually multi-racial and
multi-cultural, thus giving an
implicit social consciousness to
any play they perform.
The Julian also has ties with
contemporary German theatre
through its productions of plays
by Botho Strauss. They have per
formed the English-language
premieres of three of his plays in
recent years. The latest was
Three Acts of Recognition which,
thanks to the financial assistance
of the Goethe Institute, they
toured with last year.
The Julian is located at 953
DeHaro Street, on Potrero Hill.
They share their space, in a resi
dential neighborhood, with
another group, the Nabe
Theatre. Their phone number is
647-8098.
Because of the many ethnic
and social groups in the city,
playwrights and performers from
these groups have come together
to form theatres which concen
trate on the special interests ot
these communities. Two ot the
best known groups of this type
are Theatre Rhinoceros and the
Asian-American Theatre Pro
ject.
Because of its heavy reliance
on improvisation and its often
transitory nature, it is difficult to
give much concrete information
about performance art in the
city. It is almost completely un
publicized, with information
being spread by word of mouth
among the artist's friends and
colleagues. Another problem is
that the works are often per
formed in unusual settings, such
as empty lots, warehouses, or
parks.
One space which specializes in
performance art (as well as en
vironmental sculpture and ex
perimental poetry) is 80
Langton. It is run by artists, and
it puts on frequent shows, hut
often with very brief runs
(perhaps only one night).
80 Langton is located, not sur
prisingly, at 80 Langton, a small
street off Folsom near Seventh.
They publish a monthly schedule

of events which can he obtained
hv calling 626-5416.
The small theatres in San
Francisco often put on plays with
brief runs and do not have a lot ,ti
money to spend 011 publicity \ s
a result, just finding out what is
going on can be a challenge.
One very good source ol m
formation is the Sunday pink see
tion of the San Francisco
Examiner. They have listings
(occasionally with descriptions)
of productions by the more es
tablished small theatres.
There are two free publica
tions which give much more in
formation about the less well
known groups. The Si li tn
Guardian appears every Weii
nesday. It is distributed in main
bars and restaurants in the eit\
and in the east bay. In addition to
a calendar of cheap and free
events, they publish quite com
plete listings of plays currently
running as well as of plays about
to open.
City Arts is a monthly which
although it cannot be as up-to
date as the Bay Guardian, main
tains better contact with the
theatre companies. Reviews are
often accompanied by rebuttals
from the performers and dnei
tor, and productions at small
theatres are treated with a it
spect rarely seen in the laruer
newspapers. City Arts can usu
ally be found at theatres and bars
in the city.
For performance art. a good
source of information is the San
Francisco new-wave publication
Boulevards. It can be purchased
at Printer's Inc. Bookstore 011
California Avenue in Palo Alto
For students, ticket prices are
sometimes an issue. The small
theatres can be a great bargain.
In addition to their generally
lower prices, there are usually
discounts for students, and
cheaper prices on off niuhts
(Thursdays and Sundays) I 1
nally, there are almost always
"preview" performances the
week before opening night
These are often the best bargains
of all — at the Julian, for exam
pie, they are free.
Although this can hardly he
regarded as a complete sum
rnary, it should prove to be a use
fill pointer to the very active lik
in the small theatres in San I ran
cisco. There is so much variety
that even very special tastes can
usually be accomodated.
