Because of the
strange rules
that apply in
financing in the
arts, there are
only two ways to
survive in
theatre: to be
very small, or
very, very big.

What museums arc to Flor
ence, the theatre is for San Fran
cisco. No matter how much
people talk about the San Fran
cisco Opera or the city's night
clubs, it is the area's hundreds of
theatre groups that validate San
Francisco's claim to West Coast
cultural supremacy. The most
important activity takes place in
the many small theatres scat
tered around San Francisco and
Berkeley; the following account
starts closer to home, covering
campus and area theatre first,
then moving to the city's major
groups, and finally arriving at the
smaller venues.
The Stanford Drama Dept.
presents a major play each quar
ter, with productions usually tak
ing place in the Little Theater
behind Memorial Auditorium.
The productions are directed
and designed by members of the
department, but cast auditions
are open to the public, and stu
dents from fields other than
drama are often cast. The de
partment's 19N2-K3 plays will be
Turandot, or The Cover-Up
Congress, Bertolt Brecht's last
play (fall quarter); Euripides'
The Cyclops, adapted and di
rected by graduate student Rush
Rehm (winter quarter); Carib

bean Carnival, an outdoor musi
cal presented with the Commit
tee on Black Performing Arts
(spring quarter); and Kaufman
and Mart's Once in a Lifetime.

Palo Alto supports a couple of
theatre companies, one of which
has recently become a profes
sional group. I heafreworks.
which performs in the renovated
I ucie Stern Center theatre at
I >US Middlefield Road (near
Pnibarcadero), is entering its
second season after leaving the
Palo Alto Council for the Arts'
non profit structure. The group
has been very successful with its
mix ol sentimental musicals and
flashy premieres; its schedule
this season includes the Bay
Area premiere of St rider,
Oliver!, Ilw Wool gatherer
(another premiere) and The
Cheat White Hope. Smaller than
I'heatreworks. and with more of
a community theatre feel to it. is
the Palo \lto Players. The
Players also perform at Lucie
Stern Center, anil will open their
52nd season on the 24th with
Uomantu ( omeily hy Bernard
Slade, one of the many preten
ders to Neil Simon's throne as
the patron of American com
munity theatre.

Of the many other community
theatres in the towns surround
ing Stanford, the most interest
ing is probably the Millharn The
ater (1285 E. Hillsdale Blvd.
Foster City). which is opening its
43nd season with Deathtrap by
Ira Levin, and will go on to per
form Lock Up Your Daughters
and John Tobias' Is the Real You
Really You? this season.
Up until a couple of years ago,
the peninsula had its own major
repertory theater. But the de
mise of the California Actors
Theatre, which did rotating re
pertory out of theaters in Los
Gatos and Redwood City, left a
professional theatre gap. The
San Jose Repertory Company,
now in it-> third year, is trying to
till this gap. They will be present
ing a five-play season in the
Montgomery Theatre (Market
and San Carlos Streets,
downtown San Jose), opening
with Feydeau's Flea in Her Eat.
Another expanding company is
Los Gatos' Theater West. similar
to Theatrcworks in its name and
increasingly professional struc
ture. Theater West is opening its
six-play season with Bleacher
Hums, a nine-inning comedy that
was performed on campus last

spring.
The peninsula even has its own
Shakespeare festival. The Valley
Institute of Theatre Arts, head
quartered in Saratoga, has put on
a festival the last two summers,
with performances at the Paul
Masson Mountain Winery in
Saratoga. This summer, three
plays were performed through a
month-long season.
There is a huge gap, in San
Francisco and Berkeley profes
sional theatre, between the large
groups and the small groups. Be
cause of the strange rules that
apply in financing for the arts,
there are only two ways to sur
vive: to he very small, or very,
very big. This leads to another
dichotomy. The small theatres
can afford to be much more ad
venturous in their programming,
or to aim themselves at a specific
audience. The large theatres
have huge investments to pro
tect, and must attract as wide an
audience as possible; hence, they
are inherently conservative. And
there's one more difference, also
determined by economic consid
erations: there are, by most
standards, only three "large"
companies to describe, all three
