The smallish
collection allows
you to
recapitulate the
history of
Western art by
early afternoon,
leaving lots of
time to see the
fish at the
Academy of
Sciences.

One of my earliest memories of
London is of being dragged by
my parents through room after
dirty room filled with mummies
and Greek vases, when I had spe
cifically requested a trip to the
Tower to see where all the heads
got chopped off. That one dose of
culture cured me of museums for
the next 12 years.
Too many people reach their
20s with the same idea I had: that
museums are just larger versions
of attics, worth looking around
in. but too dusty and quiet and
creepy to be much fun. It's espe
cially hard for students, who
spend too much time just looking
and listening as it is, to get excited
at museums — it's easier to stay
awake at the beach, or 42nd
Street.
So, in the belief that ignorance
is half the problem — if you don't
know what's there, you're not
likely to find out on your own —
and with the implicit assumption
that museums are worth visiting,
here is a highly subjective ac

count of places to look at art in
the Bay Area. It won't encom
pass even the major venues, let
alone every place where you
might see something interesting,
because there just isn't room; but
take it as a start, and the more
places you get to, the more you'll
find out about.
On campus
It's hard to spend a day at
Stanford without confronting
public art in some form, but it's
quite easy to spend four years
here without ever stumbling
across the museum. Not that the
Stanford Museum of Art is small
— when it was built, during Jane
Stanford's "Great Stone Age," it
was the largest private museum
in theworld. Most of the building
collapsed in 1906, along with the
plaster copies of Greek and
Cypriot sculpture and pottery
that were its early pride, but what
remains is substantial enough. Its
obscurity is probably due to loca
tion — its nearest neighbors are

the old chemistry building and
the animal medicine labs — and a
curious lack of publicity. While
the museum association's annual
auction gets advertised in Time
magazine, the museum's ex
istence would be hard to prove
from evidence in the local media.
The museum's collection is
largely didactic, "illustrating the
history of Western art from
earliest times to the present," and
many sections (particularly the
contemporary gallery) merit one
quick stroll at the most. But some
— the 19th and 20th century
paintings, the Buck jade collec
tion, the Stanford family memo
rabilia — deserve closer atten
tion, and the Rodin collection
will draw you back to the
museum long after you've for
gotten where the libraries are.
Both the museum and the T.
W. Stanford Art Gallery (on
Serra Street, between the Busi
ness School and Annenberg
Auditorium) host regular series
of temporary exhibits. These
often bring the work of major ar
tists to campus; the exhibit of
Harry Callahan's photography
at the gallery last April will rank
as one of the most important
Other places on campus where
art is shown on a regular basis in
clude the Bechtel International
Center, the Coffee House, the
Faculty Club and the second
floor lobby of Tresidder Union.
Green Library's Special Collec
tions department puts on exhibits
of the book arts in the Lurie
Rotunda on the second floor of
the old section of the library;
they're currently showing items
from the Schofield collection of
children's literature. Some of the
most impressive works of art on
campus are those most taken for
granted; the outdoor sculptures.
Everyone has an opinion about
Albers' Wall and Kenneth
Snelson's Mozart / is still fresh
enough in the sophomore mind
to be toilet-papered; but not
many people know that Stanford
boasts a Calder (at the Law
School), a Bufano (at Tresidder),
and a Henry Moore (in front of
the art building).

the M. H. de Young Memorial
Museum, hut like most San
Francisco institutions, the de
Young has its own special charm.
Its dark, tiled interior gives it a
vaguely Mediterranean feel (an
other San Francisco character
istic) and the smallish collection
allows you to recapitulate the his
tory of Western art by early after
noon, leaving lots of time to see
the fish at the Academy of Sci
ences, Most of the masters are
represented; fans of Fl Greco will
be particularly rewarded. The

Egyptian Greek/Roman and
Africa Oceania/Americas gal
leries are hidden at opposite ends
of the building; in between is the
excellent collection of American
painting, one of the best on the
West Coast. To fulfill its role as
official museum, the de Young
also boasts six period rooms, in
cluding an Elizabethan English, a
rococo French and an 1805 New
burvport, Massachusetts parlor.
Adjoining the de Young (ac
tually sharing the same entrance)
is the Asian Art Museum. It was
built in 1966 to house Avery
Brundage's world-famous collec
tion of Asian art. which he had
donated to the city. Brundage's

Golden Gate, sits the California
Palace of the Legion of Honor.
This museum, the only one in the
country that exhibits strictly
French art. gives an impression
vastly different from both the de
Young and the Asian Art
Museum. The severe neo-classi
cal building is a smaller copy of
the Palace of the Legion of Hon
or in Paris, and is entered via a
grassy court running between
blank arcades, whose centerpiece
is a large casting of Rodin's The
Thinker. The collection runs the
gamut from Medieval tapestries
to a room of Impressionist and
post-Impressionist paintings,
with furniture, porcelain,
Fragonard and Poussin in be
tween. Coming to the Legion this
summer will be a special exhibit
of 34 works by Cezanne from the
Pearlman collection.
The basement of the Legion of
Honor holds the Achenbach
Foundation for Graphic Arts,
the print and drawing collections
of the Fine Arts Museums of San
Francisco. While there is no per
manent exhibit space for these
collections, the foundation

mounts constant temporary ex
hibits; currently showing is a col
lection of turn-of-the-century
American posters.
The last of the major San Fran
cisco museums isn't in a park, hut
it does have a connection to
greener visions of the city. After
the 1906 earthquake, a city plan
was drawn up which aimed at
making San Francisco a second
Athens: it did not meet the favor
of businessmen and the only frag
ment of it that was built was what
we now call the Civic Center. The
Museum of Modern Art occupies
the third and fourth floors of the
Veteran's Building, at Van Ness
and MacAllister. sharing the
building with Herbst Hall and
the block with the Opera House.
SFMOMA has several major
drawbacks. First, it isn't a very
pleasant place to look at art —
when it isn't freezing, it's stifling
and the endless third-floor cor
ridors could give an anteater ver
tigo. Second, the museum's per
manent collection can be hard to
track down. At the moment,
there are two paintings — both by
Clyfford Still — from the per

manent collection on view, as
well as one short hall of Europe
an photography. This means that
works b> every great modern Eu
ropean and American painter —
things like Matisse's The Girl
with Green Eyes, Picasso's Street
Scene. Paris, paintings by Dek
ooning. Pollock and Rothko, 12
Stills — are in storage or on loan.
And even when the permanent
collection is up. only a fraction of
the photographs holdings can be
hung.
This situation arises because
the museum's curators desper
ately pack the halls with contem
porary shows and big-name trav
eling exhibits (like the immense
Hopper show of this past w inter).
Currently sharing quarters in
SFMOMA are a sampling of the
museum's new acquisitions, two
exhibits of sculpture in the 20th
century, a permanent-collection
exhibit of "Collage and As
semblage", photographs by Stan
Bowman and Barbara kasten, a
more general show of contem
porary color photography, and
the traveling "Images of Ameri
ca. Precisionist Painting and
Modern Photography" show . All

this in a space hardly large
enough to call a m u:\-rm. Still,
there is a certain exhilaration to
all this; the situation is more frus
trating than anything else.
Fast Bay
Two museums on the far side
of the Ba\ Bridge should be men
tioned. Both are notable partly
for their own architecture. The
Oakland Museum (I(KM) Oak
Street, near the Lake Merritt
BART station), is the centerpiece
of an urban park designed by
Roche, Dinkeloo and Associates
in 1969. In the museum complex
itself, the main galleries are lo
cated beneath terraced roof
gardens. The museum isn't strict
l\ an art museum, but collects
items concerning the art. history
and environment of California:
its art holdings include works by
more than 1000 California ar
tists. It also hosts major traveling
exhibits of American art; current
ly on display is "Contemporary
American Realism Since 1960."
Coming full circle, the last
museum I can cram in is another
campus affair — the University
Art Museum at UC Berkeley. Its
spirit couldn't be more different

than lhat of the noble pile we
have here. Berkeley's collection is
housed in a fan-shaped, exposed
rein forced-concrete building that
looks from the air like a poker
hand. Inside, the galleries are laid
out along a continuous ascending
ramp — you start at the bottom
and at the end take an elevator
back down to the ground floor.
The centerpiece of the collection
is a group of Hans Hofman paint
ings. which occupy their own gal
lery: Mofmann. who taught at
Berkeley after the war. began the
museum's building fund with a
donation of $250,000 and 45
paintings.
Galleries
By far the liveliest part of San
Francisco's art world are the
scads of galleries scattered
around town. The good ones can
be hard to find (if you can tell
from the street that something is
a gallery, it probably isn't worth
going in), but a little searching
pays off.

best place in the country to see

Park Theatre, Menlo Park


Stanford Art Gallery
The smallish
collection allows
you to
recapitulate the
history of
Western art by
early afternoon,
leaving lots of
time to see the
fish at the
Academy of
Sciences.

One of my earliest memories of
London is of being dragged by
my parents through room after
dirty room filled with mummies
and Greek vases, when I had spe
cifically requested a trip to the
Tower to see where all the heads
got chopped off. That one dose of
culture cured me of museums for
the next 12 years.
Too many people reach their
20s with the same idea I had: that
museums are just larger versions
of attics, worth looking around
in. but too dusty and quiet and
creepy to be much fun. It's espe
cially hard for students, who
spend too much time just looking
and listening as it is, to get excited
at museums — it's easier to stay
awake at the beach, or 42nd
Street.
So, in the belief that ignorance
is half the problem — if you don't
know what's there, you're not
likely to find out on your own —
and with the implicit assumption
that museums are worth visiting,
here is a highly subjective ac

count of places to look at art in
the Bay Area. It won't encom
pass even the major venues, let
alone every place where you
might see something interesting,
because there just isn't room; but
take it as a start, and the more
places you get to, the more you'll
find out about.
On campus
It's hard to spend a day at
Stanford without confronting
public art in some form, but it's
quite easy to spend four years
here without ever stumbling
across the museum. Not that the
Stanford Museum of Art is small
— when it was built, during Jane
Stanford's "Great Stone Age," it
was the largest private museum
in theworld. Most of the building
collapsed in 1906, along with the
plaster copies of Greek and
Cypriot sculpture and pottery
that were its early pride, but what
remains is substantial enough. Its
obscurity is probably due to loca
tion — its nearest neighbors are

the old chemistry building and
the animal medicine labs — and a
curious lack of publicity. While
the museum association's annual
auction gets advertised in Time
magazine, the museum's ex
istence would be hard to prove
from evidence in the local media.
The museum's collection is
largely didactic, "illustrating the
history of Western art from
earliest times to the present," and
many sections (particularly the
contemporary gallery) merit one
quick stroll at the most. But some
— the 19th and 20th century
paintings, the Buck jade collec
tion, the Stanford family memo
rabilia — deserve closer atten
tion, and the Rodin collection
will draw you back to the
museum long after you've for
gotten where the libraries are.
Both the museum and the T.
W. Stanford Art Gallery (on
Serra Street, between the Busi
ness School and Annenberg
Auditorium) host regular series
of temporary exhibits. These
often bring the work of major ar
tists to campus; the exhibit of
Harry Callahan's photography
at the gallery last April will rank
as one of the most important
Other places on campus where
art is shown on a regular basis in

Center, the Coffee House, the
Faculty Club and the second

Green Library's Special Collec
tions department puts on exhibits
of the book arts in the Lurie
Rotunda on the second floor of
the old section of the library;
they're currently showing items
from the Schofield collection of
children's literature. Some of the
most impressive works of art on
campus are those most taken for
granted; the outdoor sculptures.

Its dark, tiled interior gives it a

allows you to recapitulate the his
tory of Western art by early after

the fish at the Academy of Sci

official museum, the de Young
also boasts six period rooms, in
cluding an Elizabethan English, a
rococo French and an 1805 New

Adjoining the de Young (ac

Golden Gate, sits the California
Palace of the Legion of Honor.
This museum, the only one in the
country that exhibits strictly
French art. gives an impression
vastly different from both the de
Young and the Asian Art
Museum. The severe neo-classi
cal building is a smaller copy of
the Palace of the Legion of Hon
or in Paris, and is entered via a
grassy court running between
blank arcades, whose centerpiece
is a large casting of Rodin's The
Thinker. The collection runs the
gamut from Medieval tapestries
to a room of Impressionist and
post-Impressionist paintings,
with furniture, porcelain,
Fragonard and Poussin in be
tween. Coming to the Legion this
summer will be a special exhibit
of 34 works by Cezanne from the
Pearlman collection.
The basement of the Legion of
Honor holds the Achenbach
Foundation for Graphic Arts,
the print and drawing collections
of the Fine Arts Museums of San
Francisco. While there is no per
manent exhibit space for these
collections, the foundation

mounts constant temporary ex
hibits; currently showing is a col
lection of turn-of-the-century
American posters.
The last of the major San Fran
cisco museums isn't in a park, hut
it does have a connection to
greener visions of the city. After
the 1906 earthquake, a city plan
was drawn up which aimed at
making San Francisco a second
Athens: it did not meet the favor
of businessmen and the only frag
ment of it that was built was what
we now call the Civic Center. The
Museum of Modern Art occupies
the third and fourth floors of the
Veteran's Building, at Van Ness
and MacAllister. sharing the
building with Herbst Hall and
the block with the Opera House.
SFMOMA has several major
drawbacks. First, it isn't a very
pleasant place to look at art —
when it isn't freezing, it's stifling
and the endless third-floor cor
ridors could give an anteater ver
tigo. Second, the museum's per
manent collection can be hard to
track down. At the moment,
there are two paintings — both by
Clyfford Still — from the per

manent collection on view, as
well as one short hall of Europe
an photography. This means that
works b> every great modern Eu
ropean and American painter —
things like Matisse's The Girl
with Green Eyes, Picasso's Street
Scene. Paris, paintings by Dek
ooning. Pollock and Rothko, 12
Stills — are in storage or on loan.
And even when the permanent
collection is up. only a fraction of
the photographs holdings can be
hung.
This situation arises because
the museum's curators desper
ately pack the halls with contem
porary shows and big-name trav
eling exhibits (like the immense
Hopper show of this past w inter).
Currently sharing quarters in
SFMOMA are a sampling of the
museum's new acquisitions, two
exhibits of sculpture in the 20th
century, a permanent-collection
exhibit of "Collage and As
semblage", photographs by Stan
Bowman and Barbara kasten, a
more general show of contem
porary color photography, and
the traveling "Images of Ameri
ca. Precisionist Painting and
Modern Photography" show . All

this in a space hardly large
enough to call a m u:\-rm. Still,
there is a certain exhilaration to
all this; the situation is more frus
trating than anything else.
Fast Bay
Two museums on the far side
of the Ba\ Bridge should be men
tioned. Both are notable partly
for their own architecture. The
Oakland Museum (I(KM) Oak
Street, near the Lake Merritt
BART station), is the centerpiece
of an urban park designed by
Roche, Dinkeloo and Associates
in 1969. In the museum complex
itself, the main galleries are lo
cated beneath terraced roof
gardens. The museum isn't strict
l\ an art museum, but collects
items concerning the art. history
and environment of California:
its art holdings include works by
more than 1000 California ar
tists. It also hosts major traveling
exhibits of American art; current
ly on display is "Contemporary
American Realism Since 1960."
Coming full circle, the last
museum I can cram in is another
campus affair — the University
Art Museum at UC Berkeley. Its
spirit couldn't be more different

than lhat of the noble pile we
have here. Berkeley's collection is
housed in a fan-shaped, exposed
rein forced-concrete building that
looks from the air like a poker
hand. Inside, the galleries are laid
out along a continuous ascending
ramp — you start at the bottom
and at the end take an elevator
back down to the ground floor.
The centerpiece of the collection
is a group of Hans Hofman paint
ings. which occupy their own gal
lery: Mofmann. who taught at
Berkeley after the war. began the
museum's building fund with a
donation of $250,000 and 45
paintings.
Galleries
By far the liveliest part of San
Francisco's art world are the
scads of galleries scattered
around town. The good ones can
be hard to find (if you can tell
from the street that something is
a gallery, it probably isn't worth
going in), but a little searching
pays off.

Park Theatre, Menlo Park


Stanford Art Gallery
The smallish
collection allows
you to
recapitulate the
history of
Western art by
early afternoon,
leaving lots of
time to see the
fish at the
Academy of
Sciences.

One of my earliest memories of
London is of being dragged by
my parents through room after
dirty room filled with mummies
and Greek vases, when I had spe
cifically requested a trip to the
Tower to see where all the heads
got chopped off. That one dose of
culture cured me of museums for
the next 12 years.
Too many people reach their
20s with the same idea I had: that
museums are just larger versions
of attics, worth looking around
in. but too dusty and quiet and
creepy to be much fun. It's espe
cially hard for students, who
spend too much time just looking
and listening as it is, to get excited
at museums — it's easier to stay
awake at the beach, or 42nd
Street.
So, in the belief that ignorance
is half the problem — if you don't
know what's there, you're not
likely to find out on your own —
and with the implicit assumption
that museums are worth visiting,
here is a highly subjective ac

count of places to look at art in
the Bay Area. It won't encom
pass even the major venues, let
alone every place where you
might see something interesting,
because there just isn't room; but
take it as a start, and the more
places you get to, the more you'll
find out about.
On campus
It's hard to spend a day at
Stanford without confronting
public art in some form, but it's
quite easy to spend four years
here without ever stumbling
across the museum. Not that the
Stanford Museum of Art is small
— when it was built, during Jane
Stanford's "Great Stone Age," it
was the largest private museum
in theworld. Most of the building
collapsed in 1906, along with the
plaster copies of Greek and
Cypriot sculpture and pottery
that were its early pride, but what
remains is substantial enough. Its
obscurity is probably due to loca
tion — its nearest neighbors are

the old chemistry building and
the animal medicine labs — and a
curious lack of publicity. While
the museum association's annual
auction gets advertised in Time
magazine, the museum's ex
istence would be hard to prove
from evidence in the local media.
The museum's collection is
largely didactic, "illustrating the
history of Western art from
earliest times to the present," and
many sections (particularly the
contemporary gallery) merit one
quick stroll at the most. But some
— the 19th and 20th century
paintings, the Buck jade collec
tion, the Stanford family memo
rabilia — deserve closer atten
tion, and the Rodin collection
will draw you back to the
museum long after you've for
gotten where the libraries are.
Both the museum and the T.
W. Stanford Art Gallery (on
Serra Street, between the Busi
ness School and Annenberg
Auditorium) host regular series
of temporary exhibits. These
often bring the work of major ar
tists to campus; the exhibit of
Harry Callahan's photography
at the gallery last April will rank
as one of the most important
Other places on campus where
art is shown on a regular basis in

most impressive works of art on

allows you to recapitulate the his

Golden Gate, sits the California
Palace of the Legion of Honor.
This museum, the only one in the
country that exhibits strictly
French art. gives an impression
vastly different from both the de
Young and the Asian Art
Museum. The severe neo-classi
cal building is a smaller copy of
the Palace of the Legion of Hon
or in Paris, and is entered via a
grassy court running between
blank arcades, whose centerpiece
is a large casting of Rodin's The
Thinker. The collection runs the
gamut from Medieval tapestries
to a room of Impressionist and
post-Impressionist paintings,
with furniture, porcelain,
Fragonard and Poussin in be
tween. Coming to the Legion this
summer will be a special exhibit
of 34 works by Cezanne from the
Pearlman collection.
The basement of the Legion of
Honor holds the Achenbach
Foundation for Graphic Arts,
the print and drawing collections
of the Fine Arts Museums of San
Francisco. While there is no per
manent exhibit space for these
collections, the foundation

mounts constant temporary ex
hibits; currently showing is a col
lection of turn-of-the-century
American posters.
The last of the major San Fran
cisco museums isn't in a park, hut
it does have a connection to
greener visions of the city. After
the 1906 earthquake, a city plan
was drawn up which aimed at
making San Francisco a second
Athens: it did not meet the favor
of businessmen and the only frag
ment of it that was built was what
we now call the Civic Center. The
Museum of Modern Art occupies
the third and fourth floors of the
Veteran's Building, at Van Ness
and MacAllister. sharing the
building with Herbst Hall and
the block with the Opera House.
SFMOMA has several major
drawbacks. First, it isn't a very
pleasant place to look at art —
when it isn't freezing, it's stifling
and the endless third-floor cor
ridors could give an anteater ver
tigo. Second, the museum's per
manent collection can be hard to
track down. At the moment,
there are two paintings — both by
Clyfford Still — from the per

manent collection on view, as
well as one short hall of Europe
an photography. This means that
works b> every great modern Eu
ropean and American painter —
things like Matisse's The Girl
with Green Eyes, Picasso's Street
Scene. Paris, paintings by Dek
ooning. Pollock and Rothko, 12
Stills — are in storage or on loan.
And even when the permanent
collection is up. only a fraction of
the photographs holdings can be
hung.
This situation arises because
the museum's curators desper
ately pack the halls with contem
porary shows and big-name trav
eling exhibits (like the immense
Hopper show of this past w inter).
Currently sharing quarters in
SFMOMA are a sampling of the
museum's new acquisitions, two
exhibits of sculpture in the 20th
century, a permanent-collection
exhibit of "Collage and As
semblage", photographs by Stan
Bowman and Barbara kasten, a
more general show of contem
porary color photography, and
the traveling "Images of Ameri
ca. Precisionist Painting and

this in a space hardly large
enough to call a m u:\-rm. Still,
there is a certain exhilaration to
all this; the situation is more frus
trating than anything else.
Fast Bay
Two museums on the far side
of the Ba\ Bridge should be men
tioned. Both are notable partly
for their own architecture. The
Oakland Museum (I(KM) Oak
Street, near the Lake Merritt
BART station), is the centerpiece
of an urban park designed by
Roche, Dinkeloo and Associates
in 1969. In the museum complex
itself, the main galleries are lo
cated beneath terraced roof
gardens. The museum isn't strict
l\ an art museum, but collects
items concerning the art. history
and environment of California:
its art holdings include works by
more than 1000 California ar
tists. It also hosts major traveling
exhibits of American art; current
ly on display is "Contemporary
American Realism Since 1960."
Coming full circle, the last
museum I can cram in is another
campus affair — the University
Art Museum at UC Berkeley. Its
spirit couldn't be more different

than lhat of the noble pile we
have here. Berkeley's collection is
housed in a fan-shaped, exposed
rein forced-concrete building that
looks from the air like a poker
hand. Inside, the galleries are laid
out along a continuous ascending
ramp — you start at the bottom
and at the end take an elevator
back down to the ground floor.
The centerpiece of the collection
is a group of Hans Hofman paint
ings. which occupy their own gal
lery: Mofmann. who taught at
Berkeley after the war. began the
museum's building fund with a
donation of $250,000 and 45
paintings.
Galleries
By far the liveliest part of San
Francisco's art world are the
scads of galleries scattered
around town. The good ones can
be hard to find (if you can tell
from the street that something is
a gallery, it probably isn't worth
going in), but a little searching
pays off.

Park Theatre, Menlo Park


Stanford Art Gallery
The smallish
collection allows
you to
recapitulate the
history of
Western art by
early afternoon,
leaving lots of
time to see the
fish at the
Academy of
Sciences.

One of my earliest memories of
London is of being dragged by
my parents through room after
dirty room filled with mummies
and Greek vases, when I had spe
cifically requested a trip to the
Tower to see where all the heads
got chopped off. That one dose of
culture cured me of museums for
the next 12 years.
Too many people reach their
20s with the same idea I had: that
museums are just larger versions
of attics, worth looking around
in. but too dusty and quiet and
creepy to be much fun. It's espe
cially hard for students, who
spend too much time just looking
and listening as it is, to get excited
at museums — it's easier to stay
awake at the beach, or 42nd
Street.
So, in the belief that ignorance
is half the problem — if you don't
know what's there, you're not
likely to find out on your own —
and with the implicit assumption
that museums are worth visiting,
here is a highly subjective ac

count of places to look at art in
the Bay Area. It won't encom
pass even the major venues, let
alone every place where you
might see something interesting,
because there just isn't room; but
take it as a start, and the more
places you get to, the more you'll
find out about.
On campus
It's hard to spend a day at
Stanford without confronting
public art in some form, but it's
quite easy to spend four years
here without ever stumbling
across the museum. Not that the
Stanford Museum of Art is small
— when it was built, during Jane
Stanford's "Great Stone Age," it
was the largest private museum
in theworld. Most of the building
collapsed in 1906, along with the
plaster copies of Greek and
Cypriot sculpture and pottery
that were its early pride, but what
remains is substantial enough. Its
obscurity is probably due to loca
tion — its nearest neighbors are

the old chemistry building and
the animal medicine labs — and a
curious lack of publicity. While
the museum association's annual
auction gets advertised in Time
magazine, the museum's ex
istence would be hard to prove
from evidence in the local media.
The museum's collection is
largely didactic, "illustrating the
history of Western art from
earliest times to the present," and
many sections (particularly the
contemporary gallery) merit one
quick stroll at the most. But some
— the 19th and 20th century
paintings, the Buck jade collec
tion, the Stanford family memo
rabilia — deserve closer atten
tion, and the Rodin collection
will draw you back to the
museum long after you've for
gotten where the libraries are.
Both the museum and the T.
W. Stanford Art Gallery (on
Serra Street, between the Busi
ness School and Annenberg
Auditorium) host regular series
of temporary exhibits. These
often bring the work of major ar
tists to campus; the exhibit of
Harry Callahan's photography
at the gallery last April will rank
as one of the most important
Other places on campus where
art is shown on a regular basis in
clude the Bechtel International
Center, the Coffee House, the
Faculty Club and the second
floor lobby of Tresidder Union.
Green Library's Special Collec
tions department puts on exhibits
of the book arts in the Lurie
Rotunda on the second floor of
the old section of the library;
they're currently showing items
from the Schofield collection of
children's literature. Some of the
most impressive works of art on
campus are those most taken for
granted; the outdoor sculptures.
Everyone has an opinion about

enough in the sophomore mind
to be toilet-papered; but not
many people know that Stanford
boasts a Calder (at the Law
School), a Bufano (at Tresidder),
and a Henry Moore (in front of
the art building).
San Francisco
San Francisco's official

Egyptian splendor alongside the
Music Concourse in Golden
Gate Park. New York, Cleve

Pasadena, Washington. Detroit.

ton all have museums better than
the M. H. de Young Memorial
Museum, hut like most San
Francisco institutions, the de
Young has its own special charm.
Its dark, tiled interior gives it a
vaguely Mediterranean feel (an
other San Francisco character
istic) and the smallish collection
allows you to recapitulate the his
tory of Western art by early after
noon, leaving lots of time to see
the fish at the Academy of Sci
ences, Most of the masters are
represented; fans of Fl Greco will
be particularly rewarded. The

Egyptian Greek/Roman and
Africa Oceania/Americas gal
leries are hidden at opposite ends
of the building; in between is the
excellent collection of American
painting, one of the best on the
West Coast. To fulfill its role as
official museum, the de Young
also boasts six period rooms, in
cluding an Elizabethan English, a
rococo French and an 1805 New
burvport, Massachusetts parlor.
Adjoining the de Young (ac
tually sharing the same entrance)
is the Asian Art Museum. It was
built in 1966 to house Avery
Brundage's world-famous collec
tion of Asian art. which he had
donated to the city. Brundage's
10.000 pieces, half of them Chi

Golden Gate, sits the California
Palace of the Legion of Honor.
This museum, the only one in the
country that exhibits strictly
French art. gives an impression
vastly different from both the de
Young and the Asian Art
Museum. The severe neo-classi
cal building is a smaller copy of
the Palace of the Legion of Hon
or in Paris, and is entered via a
grassy court running between
blank arcades, whose centerpiece
is a large casting of Rodin's The
Thinker. The collection runs the
gamut from Medieval tapestries
to a room of Impressionist and
post-Impressionist paintings,
with furniture, porcelain,
Fragonard and Poussin in be
tween. Coming to the Legion this
summer will be a special exhibit
of 34 works by Cezanne from the
Pearlman collection.
The basement of the Legion of
Honor holds the Achenbach
Foundation for Graphic Arts,
the print and drawing collections
of the Fine Arts Museums of San
Francisco. While there is no per
manent exhibit space for these
collections, the foundation

mounts constant temporary ex
hibits; currently showing is a col
lection of turn-of-the-century
American posters.
The last of the major San Fran
cisco museums isn't in a park, hut
it does have a connection to
greener visions of the city. After
the 1906 earthquake, a city plan
was drawn up which aimed at
making San Francisco a second
Athens: it did not meet the favor
of businessmen and the only frag
ment of it that was built was what
we now call the Civic Center. The
Museum of Modern Art occupies
the third and fourth floors of the
Veteran's Building, at Van Ness
and MacAllister. sharing the
building with Herbst Hall and
the block with the Opera House.
SFMOMA has several major
drawbacks. First, it isn't a very
pleasant place to look at art —
when it isn't freezing, it's stifling
and the endless third-floor cor
ridors could give an anteater ver
tigo. Second, the museum's per
manent collection can be hard to
track down. At the moment,
there are two paintings — both by
Clyfford Still — from the per

manent collection on view, as
well as one short hall of Europe
an photography. This means that
works b> every great modern Eu
ropean and American painter —
things like Matisse's The Girl
with Green Eyes, Picasso's Street
Scene. Paris, paintings by Dek
ooning. Pollock and Rothko, 12
Stills — are in storage or on loan.
And even when the permanent
collection is up. only a fraction of
the photographs holdings can be
hung.
This situation arises because
the museum's curators desper
ately pack the halls with contem
porary shows and big-name trav
eling exhibits (like the immense
Hopper show of this past w inter).
Currently sharing quarters in
SFMOMA are a sampling of the
museum's new acquisitions, two
exhibits of sculpture in the 20th
century, a permanent-collection
exhibit of "Collage and As
semblage", photographs by Stan
Bowman and Barbara kasten, a
more general show of contem
porary color photography, and
the traveling "Images of Ameri
ca. Precisionist Painting and
Modern Photography" show . All

this in a space hardly large
enough to call a m u:\-rm. Still,
there is a certain exhilaration to
all this; the situation is more frus
trating than anything else.
Fast Bay
Two museums on the far side
of the Ba\ Bridge should be men
tioned. Both are notable partly
for their own architecture. The
Oakland Museum (I(KM) Oak
Street, near the Lake Merritt
BART station), is the centerpiece
of an urban park designed by
Roche, Dinkeloo and Associates
in 1969. In the museum complex
itself, the main galleries are lo
cated beneath terraced roof
gardens. The museum isn't strict
l\ an art museum, but collects
items concerning the art. history
and environment of California:
its art holdings include works by
more than 1000 California ar
tists. It also hosts major traveling
exhibits of American art; current
ly on display is "Contemporary
American Realism Since 1960."
Coming full circle, the last
museum I can cram in is another
campus affair — the University
Art Museum at UC Berkeley. Its
spirit couldn't be more different

than lhat of the noble pile we
have here. Berkeley's collection is
housed in a fan-shaped, exposed
rein forced-concrete building that
looks from the air like a poker
hand. Inside, the galleries are laid
out along a continuous ascending
ramp — you start at the bottom
and at the end take an elevator
back down to the ground floor.
The centerpiece of the collection
is a group of Hans Hofman paint
ings. which occupy their own gal
lery: Mofmann. who taught at
Berkeley after the war. began the
museum's building fund with a
donation of $250,000 and 45
paintings.
Galleries
By far the liveliest part of San
Francisco's art world are the
scads of galleries scattered
around town. The good ones can
be hard to find (if you can tell
from the street that something is
a gallery, it probably isn't worth
going in), but a little searching
pays off.

best place in the country to see
