The smallish
collection allows
you to
recapitulate the
history of
Western art by
early afternoon,
leaving lots of
time to see the
fish at the
Academy of
Sciences.

One of my earliest memories of
London is of being dragged by
my parents through room after
dirty room filled with mummies
and Greek vases, when I had spe
cifically requested a trip to the
Tower to see where all the heads
got chopped off. That one dose of
culture cured me of museums for
the next 12 years.
Too many people reach their
20s with the same idea I had: that
museums are just larger versions
of attics, worth looking around
in. but too dusty and quiet and
creepy to be much fun. It's espe
cially hard for students, who
spend too much time just looking
and listening as it is, to get excited
at museums — it's easier to stay
awake at the beach, or 42nd
Street.
So, in the belief that ignorance
is half the problem — if you don't
know what's there, you're not
likely to find out on your own —
and with the implicit assumption
that museums are worth visiting,
here is a highly subjective ac

count of places to look at art in
the Bay Area. It won't encom
pass even the major venues, let
alone every place where you
might see something interesting,
because there just isn't room; but
take it as a start, and the more
places you get to, the more you'll
find out about.
On campus
It's hard to spend a day at
Stanford without confronting
public art in some form, but it's
quite easy to spend four years
here without ever stumbling
across the museum. Not that the
Stanford Museum of Art is small
— when it was built, during Jane
Stanford's "Great Stone Age," it
was the largest private museum
in theworld. Most of the building
collapsed in 1906, along with the
plaster copies of Greek and
Cypriot sculpture and pottery
that were its early pride, but what
remains is substantial enough. Its
obscurity is probably due to loca
tion — its nearest neighbors are

the old chemistry building and
the animal medicine labs — and a
curious lack of publicity. While
the museum association's annual
auction gets advertised in Time
magazine, the museum's ex
istence would be hard to prove
from evidence in the local media.
The museum's collection is
largely didactic, "illustrating the
history of Western art from
earliest times to the present," and
many sections (particularly the
contemporary gallery) merit one
quick stroll at the most. But some
— the 19th and 20th century
paintings, the Buck jade collec
tion, the Stanford family memo
rabilia — deserve closer atten
tion, and the Rodin collection
will draw you back to the
museum long after you've for
gotten where the libraries are.
Both the museum and the T.
W. Stanford Art Gallery (on
Serra Street, between the Busi
ness School and Annenberg
Auditorium) host regular series
of temporary exhibits. These
often bring the work of major ar
tists to campus; the exhibit of
Harry Callahan's photography
at the gallery last April will rank
as one of the most important
Other places on campus where
art is shown on a regular basis in
clude the Bechtel International
Center, the Coffee House, the
Faculty Club and the second
floor lobby of Tresidder Union.
Green Library's Special Collec
tions department puts on exhibits
of the book arts in the Lurie
Rotunda on the second floor of
the old section of the library;
they're currently showing items
from the Schofield collection of
children's literature. Some of the
most impressive works of art on
campus are those most taken for
granted; the outdoor sculptures.
Everyone has an opinion about
Albers' Wall and Kenneth
Snelson's Mozart / is still fresh
enough in the sophomore mind
to be toilet-papered; but not
many people know that Stanford
boasts a Calder (at the Law
School), a Bufano (at Tresidder),
and a Henry Moore (in front of
the art building).
San Francisco
San Francisco's official

"museum of art" sits in pseudo-
Egyptian splendor alongside the
Music Concourse in Golden
Gate Park. New York, Cleve
land. Chicago, I.os Angeles,
Pasadena, Washington. Detroit.
Philadelphia. Boston and Hous
ton all have museums better than
the M. H. de Young Memorial
Museum, hut like most San
Francisco institutions, the de
Young has its own special charm.
Its dark, tiled interior gives it a
vaguely Mediterranean feel (an
other San Francisco character
istic) and the smallish collection
allows you to recapitulate the his
tory of Western art by early after
noon, leaving lots of time to see
the fish at the Academy of Sci
ences, Most of the masters are
represented; fans of Fl Greco will
be particularly rewarded. The

Egyptian Greek/Roman and
Africa Oceania/Americas gal
leries are hidden at opposite ends
of the building; in between is the
excellent collection of American
painting, one of the best on the
West Coast. To fulfill its role as
official museum, the de Young
also boasts six period rooms, in
cluding an Elizabethan English, a
rococo French and an 1805 New
burvport, Massachusetts parlor.
Adjoining the de Young (ac
tually sharing the same entrance)
is the Asian Art Museum. It was
built in 1966 to house Avery
Brundage's world-famous collec
tion of Asian art. which he had
donated to the city. Brundage's
10.000 pieces, half of them Chi
nese. still make up 95 percent of'
the museum's collection. The
