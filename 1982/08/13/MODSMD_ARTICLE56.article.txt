Music is the hardest enter
tainment category to pin down,
because it encompasses every
thing from the San Francisco
Opera to the Keystone Palo
Alto, with room in between for
Bach societies and Rolling
Stones concerts in Candlestick
Park. At the same time, the local
music scene is less monolithic
than the theatre; in any given
genre of music, it is possible to
keep track of what's happening,
and even to attend a good prop
ortion of the relevant events.
Most musical performers
spend their time traveling; the
best way to describe local musi
cal offerings is in terms of or
ganizers, who tend to stay in one
place. On campus, the most visi
ble of these organizers is the
Lively Arts at Stanford. While
the Lively Arts program contains
a variety of events, including
dapce companies, films and lec
tures, and (occasionally) drama,
the bulk of the schedule is made
up of musical acts. This year the
Lively Arts is bringing to campus
a number of soloists — pianists
Bella Davidovich and Murray
Perahia, violinists Oscar
Shumsky and Charles Trcger
(with Andre Watts at the piano),
cellists Nathaniel Rosen and
Anner Bylsma, and guitarist
Michael Lorimer to name a few
— and chamber groups — the
Emerson, Guarneri and Endell
ion quartets, the Chamber Music
Society of Lincoln Center, the
Empire Brass Quintet — several

jazz groups, and a few offbeat
acts, including the McLain fam
ily bluegrass band and an ap
pearance by modern composer
Philip Glass. For the big acts, like
Davidovich or the Guarneri
Ouartet, it may be hard to find
good seats, or any seats; the
Lively Arts conducts an aggres
sive season ticket sales campaign
each spring. For tickets to indi
vidual events, go to the Tresid
der Ticket Office. Ticket prices
are high, for campus events, but
less than you'd pay to see the
same performers elsewhere.
Don't worry about missing out
on the events; it's hard not to
hear about them. The Lively
Arts advertising campaigns, like
their ticket sales, are aggressive.
The Stanford Music Depart
ment sponsors a full season of
performances throughout the
school year, featuring campus
groups and performers. Many of
the department's students give
recitals in the upstairs lounges at
Tresidder which are open to the
public. Orchestral ensembles,
including the Stanford Sym
phony and Chamber Orchestras
and the Stanford Baroque En
semble, and the University's
vocal grops, the Chorus and
Chorale, give performances in
Dinkelspiel and the Church. The
Tresidder recitals are free; the
ensemble performances cost $1
— $3 for students. Other groups
sponsored by the department in
clude the Dunstable Singers,
performers of older choral
music, and Alea 11, the depart
ment's contemporary music en
semble. One of the nicer Stan
ford traditions is the yearly Mes
siah Sing, held at the end of each
winter quarter in Memorial
Church. This year's sing is
scheduled for Dec. 13.
The Bay Area is known as a
hotbed of "new" music. Stan
ford's contribution to this is the
Center for Computer Research
in Music and Acoustics, located
at 1600 Arastradero Rd. bet
ween Page Mill and Alpine
Roads. The CCRMA gives
periodic performances of its
latest compositions, in the even
ing under the open sky. They
suggest you bring a blanket.
The Music Dept. publishes a
quarterly calendar of events.

which can be obtained from
them or at the Tresidder Infor
mation Desk. If you wish to buy
tickets for an event in advance,
you may order them from the
department or purchase them at
the Tresidder Ticket Office.
STARTS (Student Arts st
Stanford) is a student group,
headquartered in Tresidder,
which works to involve students
in the arts. They sponsor a truly
wide variety of things: lectures,
art exhibits, excursions around
the Bay Area, classes in callig
raphy, dancing, music, etc., and
large-scale events such as the
Stanford Christmas Faire and
the Plant and Poster Sale (which
is going on right now). And, of
course, music: noon concerts on
the Tresidder patio, featuring
local rock and jazz groups,
"Classical Cafe" and other prog
rams in the Coffee House, and
live music several nights a week
at Encina Station.
At an institution that doesn't
have many "institutions" of its
own, the Stanford Savoyards
stand out. This will be the
Savoyards' ninth season of per
forming Gilbert & Sullivan
operettas in Dinkelspiel Au
ditorium. The Savoyards mem
bership is drawn from all parts of
the university: students, faculty,
staff, and community members
work together to put on the
shows. This year's productions
will be HMS Pinafore and a 1 Oth
anniversary program of selected
Savoyards highlights.
This only covers the more
formal, institutionalized, in
stances of music on campus.
Other sorts of events happen all
the time. Big-name rock con
certs will be making a comeback,
after a one year hiatus, when
Pablo Cruise plays in Frost Am
phitheatre Oct. 4. The concert is
being sponsored by the Stanford
Student Alumni Network; so far,
there has been no official an
nouncement of further concerts.
Another musical possibility is
dorm and frat parties; they often
feature live music, especially
spring quarter.
The most well-known Bay
Area purveyor of classical music
is also the one least popular
among students — the San Fran
cisco Opera. The Opera, on the

basis of its numerous big-name
guest stars, is world-reknowned.
This season's lineup includes
Marilyn Home in La Ceneren
tola and Leontyne Price in
Dialogues of the Carmelites,
along with season-opening ap
pearances by Luciano Pavarotti
and Joan Sutherland.Getting a
ticket for the performance you
want to see may be a major chal
lenge; four of the 11 operas
scheduled are sold out for their
run, and the rest are 85 to 95

percent sold out. All perfor
mances are in the War Memorial
Opera House (Civic Center, San
Francisco).
The San Francisco Symphony,
while certainly respectable, does
not quite have the world-class
status accorded the Opera. Gen
eral critical opinion concerning
its conductor of five-year's
standing, Edo de Waart, and its
one-year-old home, the Louise
M. Davies Symphony Hall, is still
up in the air. At home, though,
the SF Symphony is still the best
there is, and "going to the sym
phony" is a very popular "cul
tural thing to do" with students.
This is largely due to the Sym
phony's student outreach prog
ram; many dorms own season
tickets to the symphony, for use
by students. Programs at the
Symphony run one to two weeks,
Wednesday through Sunday;
student tickets are generally for
Wednesday night performances.
Wednesday night programs are
also broadcast on KQED radio.
The San Jose Symphony, con
ducted by George Cleve, is
mainly known for its extensive
Mostly Mozart series, giveri
every summer. This is the

group's tenth season; all perfor
mances are in the San Jose Per
forming Arts Center (one of the
area's best auditoriums) in
downtown San Jose.
Both the San Francisco and
San Jose symphonies put on
series at Flint Center, on the De
Anza College campus in Cuper
tino (a short drive south from
Stanford).
Popular music in the area can
be heard in two very different
sorts of environments. There are
the big places, from large arenas
up to football stadiums, which
only big-name acts can fill; and
there are the clubs, where you
might hear anybody. As you
might expect, the clubs are more
interesting. But first, the big
places.
Before a couple of years ago, it
was not uncommon for fairly
famous bands — Southside
Johnny and the Asbury Jukes,
Poco, Willie Nelson, The Knack
(remember, this is a couple of
years ago) — to play the Stan
ford campus, either in Frost
Amphitheatre or Maples Pavil
ion. But the group that booked
them, ASSU Special F.vents,
folded in 1980 after going

roughly $100,000 in debt. Since
then, the campus has gone con
certless while debates raged over
who should present concerts on
campus, and how. An end is in
sight, however, with Bill Graham
Presents joining forces with the
Chaparral to bring the Grateful
Dead to Frost on October 9 and
10, and with the Delta Upsilon
fraternity to present Kenny Log
gins on October 24.
Arenas in the area which at
tract top groups include Spartan
Stadium, at San Jose State; the
Cow Palace and Candlestick
Park, in San Francisco; the Oak
land Coliseum; the Concord
Pavilion, in Concord; Berkeley's
Greek Theatre; and the San Jose
Civic Auditorium. If you like
ELO, or Aerosmith, or Yes,
these are the places you'll go.
The Circle Star Theatre, just
off 101 in San Carlos, is a
medium-sized theater-in-the
round, with a revolving stage.
The quality of the acts varies, but
most of them are headliners of
the George Benson/O'Jays and
Johnny Cash-Tammy Wynette
varieties.
