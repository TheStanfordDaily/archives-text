Music is the hardest enter
tainment category to pin down,
because it encompasses every
thing from the San Francisco
Opera to the Keystone Palo
Alto, with room in between for
Bach societies and Rolling
Stones concerts in Candlestick
Park. At the same time, the local
music scene is less monolithic
than the theatre; in any given
genre of music, it is possible to
keep track of what's happening,
and even to attend a good prop
ortion of the relevant events.
Most musical performers
spend their time traveling; the
best way to describe local musi
cal offerings is in terms of or
ganizers, who tend to stay in one
place. On campus, the most visi
ble of these organizers is the
Lively Arts at Stanford. While
the Lively Arts program contains
a variety of events, including
dapce companies, films and lec
tures, and (occasionally) drama,
the bulk of the schedule is made
up of musical acts. This year the
Lively Arts is bringing to campus
a number of soloists — pianists
Bella Davidovich and Murray
Perahia, violinists Oscar
Shumsky and Charles Trcger
(with Andre Watts at the piano),
cellists Nathaniel Rosen and
Anner Bylsma, and guitarist
Michael Lorimer to name a few
— and chamber groups — the
Emerson, Guarneri and Endell
ion quartets, the Chamber Music
Society of Lincoln Center, the
Empire Brass Quintet — several

jazz groups, and a few offbeat
acts, including the McLain fam
ily bluegrass band and an ap
pearance by modern composer
Philip Glass. For the big acts, like
Davidovich or the Guarneri
Ouartet, it may be hard to find
good seats, or any seats; the
Lively Arts conducts an aggres
sive season ticket sales campaign
each spring. For tickets to indi
vidual events, go to the Tresid
der Ticket Office. Ticket prices
are high, for campus events, but
less than you'd pay to see the
same performers elsewhere.
Don't worry about missing out
on the events; it's hard not to
hear about them. The Lively
Arts advertising campaigns, like
their ticket sales, are aggressive.
The Stanford Music Depart
ment sponsors a full season of
performances throughout the
school year, featuring campus
groups and performers. Many of
the department's students give
recitals in the upstairs lounges at
Tresidder which are open to the
public. Orchestral ensembles,
including the Stanford Sym
phony and Chamber Orchestras
and the Stanford Baroque En
semble, and the University's
vocal grops, the Chorus and
Chorale, give performances in
Dinkelspiel and the Church. The
Tresidder recitals are free; the
ensemble performances cost $1
— $3 for students. Other groups
sponsored by the department in
clude the Dunstable Singers,
performers of older choral
music, and Alea 11, the depart
ment's contemporary music en
semble. One of the nicer Stan
ford traditions is the yearly Mes
siah Sing, held at the end of each
winter quarter in Memorial
Church. This year's sing is
scheduled for Dec. 13.
The Bay Area is known as a
hotbed of "new" music. Stan
ford's contribution to this is the
Center for Computer Research
in Music and Acoustics, located
at 1600 Arastradero Rd. bet
ween Page Mill and Alpine
Roads. The CCRMA gives
periodic performances of its
latest compositions, in the even
ing under the open sky. They
suggest you bring a blanket.
The Music Dept. publishes a
quarterly calendar of events.

which can be obtained from
them or at the Tresidder Infor
mation Desk. If you wish to buy
tickets for an event in advance,
you may order them from the
department or purchase them at
the Tresidder Ticket Office.
STARTS (Student Arts st
Stanford) is a student group,
headquartered in Tresidder,
which works to involve students
in the arts. They sponsor a truly
wide variety of things: lectures,
art exhibits, excursions around
the Bay Area, classes in callig
raphy, dancing, music, etc., and
large-scale events such as the
Stanford Christmas Faire and
the Plant and Poster Sale (which
is going on right now). And, of
course, music: noon concerts on
the Tresidder patio, featuring
local rock and jazz groups,
"Classical Cafe" and other prog
rams in the Coffee House, and
live music several nights a week
at Encina Station.
At an institution that doesn't
have many "institutions" of its
own, the Stanford Savoyards
stand out. This will be the
Savoyards' ninth season of per
forming Gilbert & Sullivan
operettas in Dinkelspiel Au
ditorium. The Savoyards mem
bership is drawn from all parts of
the university: students, faculty,
staff, and community members
work together to put on the
shows. This year's productions
will be HMS Pinafore and a 1 Oth
anniversary program of selected
Savoyards highlights.
This only covers the more
formal, institutionalized, in
stances of music on campus.
Other sorts of events happen all
the time. Big-name rock con
certs will be making a comeback,
after a one year hiatus, when
Pablo Cruise plays in Frost Am
phitheatre Oct. 4. The concert is
being sponsored by the Stanford
Student Alumni Network; so far,
there has been no official an
nouncement of further concerts.
Another musical possibility is
dorm and frat parties; they often
feature live music, especially
spring quarter.
The most well-known Bay
Area purveyor of classical music
is also the one least popular
among students — the San Fran
cisco Opera. The Opera, on the

basis of its numerous big-name
guest stars, is world-reknowned.
This season's lineup includes
Marilyn Home in La Ceneren
tola and Leontyne Price in
Dialogues of the Carmelites,
along with season-opening ap
pearances by Luciano Pavarotti
and Joan Sutherland.Getting a
ticket for the performance you
want to see may be a major chal
lenge; four of the 11 operas
scheduled are sold out for their
run, and the rest are 85 to 95

percent sold out. All perfor
mances are in the War Memorial
Opera House (Civic Center, San
Francisco).
The San Francisco Symphony,
while certainly respectable, does
not quite have the world-class
status accorded the Opera. Gen
eral critical opinion concerning
its conductor of five-year's
standing, Edo de Waart, and its
one-year-old home, the Louise
M. Davies Symphony Hall, is still
up in the air. At home, though,
the SF Symphony is still the best
there is, and "going to the sym
phony" is a very popular "cul
tural thing to do" with students.
This is largely due to the Sym
phony's student outreach prog
ram; many dorms own season
tickets to the symphony, for use
by students. Programs at the
Symphony run one to two weeks,
Wednesday through Sunday;
student tickets are generally for
Wednesday night performances.
Wednesday night programs are
also broadcast on KQED radio.
The San Jose Symphony, con
ducted by George Cleve, is
mainly known for its extensive
Mostly Mozart series, giveri
every summer. This is the

group's tenth season; all perfor
mances are in the San Jose Per
forming Arts Center (one of the
area's best auditoriums) in
downtown San Jose.
Both the San Francisco and
San Jose symphonies put on
series at Flint Center, on the De
Anza College campus in Cuper
tino (a short drive south from
Stanford).
Popular music in the area can
be heard in two very different
sorts of environments. There are
the big places, from large arenas
up to football stadiums, which
only big-name acts can fill; and
there are the clubs, where you
might hear anybody. As you
might expect, the clubs are more
interesting. But first, the big
places.
Before a couple of years ago, it
was not uncommon for fairly
famous bands — Southside
Johnny and the Asbury Jukes,
Poco, Willie Nelson, The Knack
(remember, this is a couple of
years ago) — to play the Stan
ford campus, either in Frost
Amphitheatre or Maples Pavil
ion. But the group that booked
them, ASSU Special F.vents,
folded in 1980 after going

roughly $100,000 in debt. Since
then, the campus has gone con
certless while debates raged over
who should present concerts on
campus, and how. An end is in
sight, however, with Bill Graham
Presents joining forces with the
Chaparral to bring the Grateful
Dead to Frost on October 9 and
10, and with the Delta Upsilon
fraternity to present Kenny Log
gins on October 24.
Arenas in the area which at
tract top groups include Spartan
Stadium, at San Jose State; the
Cow Palace and Candlestick
Park, in San Francisco; the Oak
land Coliseum; the Concord
Pavilion, in Concord; Berkeley's
Greek Theatre; and the San Jose
Civic Auditorium. If you like
ELO, or Aerosmith, or Yes,
these are the places you'll go.
The Circle Star Theatre, just
off 101 in San Carlos, is a
medium-sized theater-in-the
round, with a revolving stage.
The quality of the acts varies, but
most of them are headliners of
the George Benson/O'Jays and
Johnny Cash-Tammy Wynette
varieties.
Newark has discos. Cleveland


Dinkelspiel Auditorium, Stanford
San Francisco's
nightclubs, even
more than Herb
Caen or the
Zodiac Killer,
distinguish this
city.

has discos. Omaha has discos.
Even Marriot's Great America
has discos.
Houston has a stadium capa
ble of accomodating Led Zeppe
lin. Seattle has a really big
stadium and they put really big
(and trashy and mindless) acts
like Aerosmith in there. Los
Angeles has two stadiums capa
ble of accomodating Aerosmith
if you count Anaheim (the Rams
did).
And every place has sym
phonies, albeit of varied quality.
Every place also has Roller
Derby rinks and experimental
theater. Every place has most
everything, if you look long
enough — even the most branch
office of all branch office met
ropoli go to pains to see that this
is true. Quality of performance
aside, it just goes to show that it
was a mistake to leave Kansas in
the first place. Maybe out there
you can't get what you want, but
you can get what you need, so to
speak.
Everything except nightclubs,
that is. San Francisco's night
clubs, even more than Herb
Caen and the Zodiac Killer, dis
tinguish this city from every in
habited community outside New
York State lines. The City has
more nightclubs than LA, for in
stance, which holds somewhere
near eight times as many in
habitants, and it offers more var
iety than LA, for example, which
holds eight times as many human
beings.
Of course it is very hard to find
one's way around when one
doesn't always know where to

go. It isn't alwpvs good to have a
billion zillion nightclubs if your
orientation issue doesn't at least
include a guide to the good ones.
As usual, the Keystone Palo
Alto is the club most folks know
about. It's not the cheapest club,
or the biggest, or the friendliest,
or the one with the best sound
(Lord, no!). But it is close, and
that means a lot to a mostly
bicycle-bound audience justifi
ably uneasy about traversing the
wilds of San Mateo on a stray
Samtrans 7F or facing the Ten
derloin district without an easy
escape route.
But location doth not a night
club make, and the Keystone is
not a nightclub, so don't let any
one tell you differently. A night
club has entertainment, but also
gives you an atmosphere and a
chance to converse. The Keys
tone Palo Alto does not exactly
fail in these goals; rather,-it blat
antly refuses to attempt reaching
them.
Consequently , the selection of
bands is like that of a small con
cert arena — country bumpkins
one night, multigenarian blues/
jazz artists the next, rapid and
rabid lobotomy rock the next.
For the latter be especially
forewarned, for Palo Alto punk
rockers are a singularly ridicul
ous bunch. Despite the kids with
skinny ties borrowed from their
fathers and the lineups of family
Buicks outside the Keystone
dropping off Skip and Cindy for
Punk Nite Out, the dancing in
side can often resemble a cross
between leapfrog and Rollerball.
If you beware the hazards,
though, the Keystone is always a
good guess in the spontaneous
"let's go to a show" rallies com
mon in dorms around the end of
a quarter.
If, on the other hand, you
enjoy the hazards and want to go
out of your way to create them,
then the Mabuhay Gardens is
waiting for you with open safety
pins. Still thriving as a Polyne
sian restaurant by day/
polyester-punk cave by night,
the Fab Mab is ideal both for
those who want to feel individual
by dressing like thousands of
other fashionable punks in $300
leather jackets and for those who
understand the colossal joke tak
ing place seven nights a week.

That's entertainment.
Another standby is the Old
Waldorf, a living will and testa
ment to Big Brother Bill
Graham's ownership of Bay
Area entertainment. Where
other nightclubs have to struggle
to get moderately successful acts
to grace their dance pits, the
Waldorf somehow consistently
draws the largest names. Never
mind that you can't see because
the stage is too low, or that you
can't hear because the ceiling is
too low (nasty business for
acoustics) and the sound system
is God-awful, or that you can't

dance because the place is scan
dalously oversold. The best
guess is that Mr. G pays folks a
lot of bread to play this breadbox
— at least then there's some jus
tification for the prices (another
drawback). In other words the
Old Waldorf is not a fun place,
understand? But good luck in
finding a name act anywhere
else.
Rule number one of nightclub
choosery specifically prohibits
parties of the first part from fol
lowing only high fame quotient
stars. High fame quotient stars
usually end up in stadiums, with

high boredom quotient warm-up
acts — you must remember that
nightclubs depend on medium
small entertainers.
"Medium-small" generally
has to do only with album sales,
however, as does the "high fame
quotient" — the point is that you
ought not wait all year for your
favorite group. They'll sell out
anyway, if they play in a night
club, so what true clubbers ought
to do is experiment with their
ears.
And you should know in ad
vance that rule number two is
not for a great many people.

It requires that you admit the
existence of a flaw. Yet it is im
portant, and we should shed our
misconceptions eventually. So
remember this — despite the
popularity of component stereo
systems with multi-colored dials
and switches, most of humanity
is unable to tell a good sound
system from a dixie cup on a
string. It follows from that that
although sound systems vary in
nightclubs, to most people it
doesn't really matter.
Consider two examples. The
Great American Music Hall and
the Old Waldorf have acoustic
drawbacks, despite their shared
habit of featuring high-quality
acts. But did you ever hear any

one complain about it? At the
Old Waldorf — a favorite haunt
for Peter Tosh / Patti Smith /
Warren Zevon types — it is sur
prising how badly the music is
mixed. And Great America's
beautiful gold-leaf interior can
sometimes send a trumpet solo
into an ear in a disconcerting
moment. But both places simply
don't need perfect acoustics, be
cause there are very tew perfect
ears. Those so blessed can find
what they need at nearly every
jazz club. (Keystone Korner for
example. That's a jazz place, and
one of the best anywhere. Jazz
places are frequented by people
who demand near-perfect acous
tics — they have it because they
need it, but other places don't.)
So that's rule two, to be noted
especially by rock fans — it
doesn't make much difference if
the weak middle range of a sys
tem is matched by a blown-out
middle ear.
Next, it is absolutely essential
to know what kind of crowd you
like. There's a world of differ
ence between Mabuhay
Gardens-variety crowds and the
rest of mankind as we know it,
for example. You gots to know
which ilk you really enjoy or else
it could destroy an evening.
Rule three has to do with tic
ket prices, but that's usually in
the paper, so forget it.
And the differences in food
and drink prices begat rule
number four. And 10, the mul
titudes were told not to forget
that gasoline is sometimes re
quired when return is made to
Palo Alto, and they were told
that they would have to sleep in
an alley. And the multitude
adhered to the commandments
of the golden calf of tuition, and
called in advance to find out the
drink minimum.
Meanwhile, over at rule
number five, everybody got the
Final Clue. When you choose a
club, and like it, go back. Fre
quent the place that treated you
like you wanted to be treated.
The psychological difference be
tween an easy ID check and the
jerk who laughs and says you
don't look 13 can be considera
ble, and a place that has extra
dancing space might turn things
around. Never underestimate
the power of a pleasant atmos
phere, once you've made up your
mind as to your definition of
"pleasant."

Ticket prices are
high for campus
events, but less
than you'd pay to
see the same
performers
elsewhere.

Music is the hardest enter
tainment category to pin down,
because it encompasses every
thing from the San Francisco
Opera to the Keystone Palo
Alto, with room in between for
Bach societies and Rolling
Stones concerts in Candlestick
Park. At the same time, the local
music scene is less monolithic
than the theatre; in any given
genre of music, it is possible to
keep track of what's happening,
and even to attend a good prop
ortion of the relevant events.
Most musical performers
spend their time traveling; the
best way to describe local musi
cal offerings is in terms of or
ganizers, who tend to stay in one
place. On campus, the most visi
ble of these organizers is the
Lively Arts at Stanford. While
the Lively Arts program contains
a variety of events, including
dapce companies, films and lec
tures, and (occasionally) drama,
the bulk of the schedule is made
up of musical acts. This year the
Lively Arts is bringing to campus
a number of soloists — pianists
Bella Davidovich and Murray
Perahia, violinists Oscar
Shumsky and Charles Trcger
(with Andre Watts at the piano),
cellists Nathaniel Rosen and
Anner Bylsma, and guitarist
Michael Lorimer to name a few
— and chamber groups — the
Emerson, Guarneri and Endell
ion quartets, the Chamber Music
Society of Lincoln Center, the
Empire Brass Quintet — several

jazz groups, and a few offbeat
acts, including the McLain fam
ily bluegrass band and an ap
pearance by modern composer
Philip Glass. For the big acts, like
Davidovich or the Guarneri
Ouartet, it may be hard to find
good seats, or any seats; the
Lively Arts conducts an aggres
sive season ticket sales campaign
each spring. For tickets to indi
vidual events, go to the Tresid
der Ticket Office. Ticket prices
are high, for campus events, but
less than you'd pay to see the
same performers elsewhere.
Don't worry about missing out
on the events; it's hard not to
hear about them. The Lively
Arts advertising campaigns, like
their ticket sales, are aggressive.
The Stanford Music Depart
ment sponsors a full season of
performances throughout the
school year, featuring campus
groups and performers. Many of
the department's students give
recitals in the upstairs lounges at
Tresidder which are open to the
public. Orchestral ensembles,
including the Stanford Sym
phony and Chamber Orchestras
and the Stanford Baroque En
semble, and the University's
vocal grops, the Chorus and
Chorale, give performances in
Dinkelspiel and the Church. The
Tresidder recitals are free; the
ensemble performances cost $1
— $3 for students. Other groups
sponsored by the department in
clude the Dunstable Singers,
performers of older choral
music, and Alea 11, the depart
ment's contemporary music en
semble. One of the nicer Stan
ford traditions is the yearly Mes
siah Sing, held at the end of each
winter quarter in Memorial
Church. This year's sing is
scheduled for Dec. 13.
The Bay Area is known as a
hotbed of "new" music. Stan
ford's contribution to this is the
Center for Computer Research
in Music and Acoustics, located
at 1600 Arastradero Rd. bet
ween Page Mill and Alpine
Roads. The CCRMA gives
periodic performances of its
latest compositions, in the even
ing under the open sky. They
suggest you bring a blanket.
The Music Dept. publishes a
quarterly calendar of events.

which can be obtained from
them or at the Tresidder Infor
mation Desk. If you wish to buy
tickets for an event in advance,
you may order them from the
department or purchase them at
the Tresidder Ticket Office.
STARTS (Student Arts st
Stanford) is a student group,
headquartered in Tresidder,
which works to involve students
in the arts. They sponsor a truly
wide variety of things: lectures,
art exhibits, excursions around
the Bay Area, classes in callig
raphy, dancing, music, etc., and
large-scale events such as the
Stanford Christmas Faire and
the Plant and Poster Sale (which
is going on right now). And, of
course, music: noon concerts on
the Tresidder patio, featuring
local rock and jazz groups,
"Classical Cafe" and other prog
rams in the Coffee House, and
live music several nights a week
at Encina Station.
At an institution that doesn't
have many "institutions" of its
own, the Stanford Savoyards
stand out. This will be the
Savoyards' ninth season of per
forming Gilbert & Sullivan
operettas in Dinkelspiel Au
ditorium. The Savoyards mem
bership is drawn from all parts of
the university: students, faculty,
staff, and community members
work together to put on the
shows. This year's productions
will be HMS Pinafore and a 1 Oth
anniversary program of selected
Savoyards highlights.
This only covers the more
formal, institutionalized, in
stances of music on campus.
Other sorts of events happen all
the time. Big-name rock con
certs will be making a comeback,
after a one year hiatus, when
Pablo Cruise plays in Frost Am
phitheatre Oct. 4. The concert is
being sponsored by the Stanford
Student Alumni Network; so far,
there has been no official an
nouncement of further concerts.
Another musical possibility is
dorm and frat parties; they often
feature live music, especially
spring quarter.
The most well-known Bay
Area purveyor of classical music
is also the one least popular
among students — the San Fran
cisco Opera. The Opera, on the

basis of its numerous big-name
guest stars, is world-reknowned.
This season's lineup includes
Marilyn Home in La Ceneren
tola and Leontyne Price in
Dialogues of the Carmelites,
along with season-opening ap
pearances by Luciano Pavarotti
and Joan Sutherland.Getting a
ticket for the performance you
want to see may be a major chal
lenge; four of the 11 operas
scheduled are sold out for their
run, and the rest are 85 to 95

percent sold out. All perfor
mances are in the War Memorial
Opera House (Civic Center, San
Francisco).
The San Francisco Symphony,
while certainly respectable, does
not quite have the world-class
status accorded the Opera. Gen
eral critical opinion concerning
its conductor of five-year's
standing, Edo de Waart, and its
one-year-old home, the Louise
M. Davies Symphony Hall, is still
up in the air. At home, though,
the SF Symphony is still the best
there is, and "going to the sym
phony" is a very popular "cul
tural thing to do" with students.
This is largely due to the Sym
phony's student outreach prog
ram; many dorms own season
tickets to the symphony, for use
by students. Programs at the
Symphony run one to two weeks,
Wednesday through Sunday;
student tickets are generally for
Wednesday night performances.
Wednesday night programs are
also broadcast on KQED radio.
The San Jose Symphony, con
ducted by George Cleve, is
mainly known for its extensive
Mostly Mozart series, giveri
every summer. This is the

group's tenth season; all perfor
mances are in the San Jose Per
forming Arts Center (one of the
area's best auditoriums) in
downtown San Jose.
Both the San Francisco and
San Jose symphonies put on
series at Flint Center, on the De
Anza College campus in Cuper
tino (a short drive south from
Stanford).
Popular music in the area can
be heard in two very different
sorts of environments. There are
the big places, from large arenas
up to football stadiums, which
only big-name acts can fill; and
there are the clubs, where you
might hear anybody. As you
might expect, the clubs are more
interesting. But first, the big
places.
Before a couple of years ago, it
was not uncommon for fairly
famous bands — Southside
Johnny and the Asbury Jukes,
Poco, Willie Nelson, The Knack
(remember, this is a couple of
years ago) — to play the Stan
ford campus, either in Frost
Amphitheatre or Maples Pavil
ion. But the group that booked
them, ASSU Special F.vents,
folded in 1980 after going

roughly $100,000 in debt. Since
then, the campus has gone con
certless while debates raged over
who should present concerts on
campus, and how. An end is in
sight, however, with Bill Graham
Presents joining forces with the
Chaparral to bring the Grateful
Dead to Frost on October 9 and
10, and with the Delta Upsilon
fraternity to present Kenny Log
gins on October 24.
Arenas in the area which at
tract top groups include Spartan
Stadium, at San Jose State; the
Cow Palace and Candlestick
Park, in San Francisco; the Oak
land Coliseum; the Concord
Pavilion, in Concord; Berkeley's
Greek Theatre; and the San Jose
Civic Auditorium. If you like
ELO, or Aerosmith, or Yes,
these are the places you'll go.
The Circle Star Theatre, just
off 101 in San Carlos, is a
medium-sized theater-in-the
round, with a revolving stage.
The quality of the acts varies, but
most of them are headliners of
the George Benson/O'Jays and
Johnny Cash-Tammy Wynette
varieties.
Newark has discos. Cleveland

city.

has discos. Omaha has discos.
Even Marriot's Great America
has discos.
Houston has a stadium capa
ble of accomodating Led Zeppe
lin. Seattle has a really big
stadium and they put really big
(and trashy and mindless) acts
like Aerosmith in there. Los
Angeles has two stadiums capa
ble of accomodating Aerosmith
if you count Anaheim (the Rams
did).
And every place has sym
phonies, albeit of varied quality.
Every place also has Roller
Derby rinks and experimental
theater. Every place has most
everything, if you look long
enough — even the most branch
office of all branch office met
ropoli go to pains to see that this
is true. Quality of performance
aside, it just goes to show that it
was a mistake to leave Kansas in
the first place. Maybe out there
you can't get what you want, but
you can get what you need, so to
speak.
Everything except nightclubs,
that is. San Francisco's night
clubs, even more than Herb
Caen and the Zodiac Killer, dis
tinguish this city from every in
habited community outside New
York State lines. The City has
more nightclubs than LA, for in
stance, which holds somewhere
near eight times as many in
habitants, and it offers more var
iety than LA, for example, which
holds eight times as many human
beings.
Of course it is very hard to find
one's way around when one
doesn't always know where to

go. It isn't alwpvs good to have a
billion zillion nightclubs if your
orientation issue doesn't at least
include a guide to the good ones.
As usual, the Keystone Palo
Alto is the club most folks know
about. It's not the cheapest club,
or the biggest, or the friendliest,
or the one with the best sound
(Lord, no!). But it is close, and
that means a lot to a mostly
bicycle-bound audience justifi
ably uneasy about traversing the
wilds of San Mateo on a stray
Samtrans 7F or facing the Ten
derloin district without an easy
escape route.
But location doth not a night
club make, and the Keystone is
not a nightclub, so don't let any
one tell you differently. A night
club has entertainment, but also
gives you an atmosphere and a
chance to converse. The Keys
tone Palo Alto does not exactly
fail in these goals; rather,-it blat
antly refuses to attempt reaching
them.
Consequently , the selection of
bands is like that of a small con
cert arena — country bumpkins
one night, multigenarian blues/
jazz artists the next, rapid and
rabid lobotomy rock the next.
For the latter be especially
forewarned, for Palo Alto punk
rockers are a singularly ridicul
ous bunch. Despite the kids with
skinny ties borrowed from their
fathers and the lineups of family
Buicks outside the Keystone
dropping off Skip and Cindy for
Punk Nite Out, the dancing in
side can often resemble a cross
between leapfrog and Rollerball.
If you beware the hazards,
though, the Keystone is always a
good guess in the spontaneous
"let's go to a show" rallies com
mon in dorms around the end of
a quarter.
If, on the other hand, you
enjoy the hazards and want to go
out of your way to create them,
then the Mabuhay Gardens is
waiting for you with open safety
pins. Still thriving as a Polyne
sian restaurant by day/
polyester-punk cave by night,
the Fab Mab is ideal both for
those who want to feel individual
by dressing like thousands of
other fashionable punks in $300
leather jackets and for those who
understand the colossal joke tak
ing place seven nights a week.

That's entertainment.
Another standby is the Old
Waldorf, a living will and testa
ment to Big Brother Bill
Graham's ownership of Bay
Area entertainment. Where
other nightclubs have to struggle
to get moderately successful acts
to grace their dance pits, the
Waldorf somehow consistently
draws the largest names. Never
mind that you can't see because
the stage is too low, or that you
can't hear because the ceiling is
too low (nasty business for
acoustics) and the sound system
is God-awful, or that you can't

dance because the place is scan
dalously oversold. The best
guess is that Mr. G pays folks a
lot of bread to play this breadbox
— at least then there's some jus
tification for the prices (another
drawback). In other words the
Old Waldorf is not a fun place,
understand? But good luck in
finding a name act anywhere
else.
Rule number one of nightclub
choosery specifically prohibits
parties of the first part from fol
lowing only high fame quotient
stars. High fame quotient stars
usually end up in stadiums, with

high boredom quotient warm-up
acts — you must remember that
nightclubs depend on medium
small entertainers.
"Medium-small" generally
has to do only with album sales,
however, as does the "high fame
quotient" — the point is that you
ought not wait all year for your
favorite group. They'll sell out
anyway, if they play in a night
club, so what true clubbers ought
to do is experiment with their
ears.
And you should know in ad
vance that rule number two is
not for a great many people.

It requires that you admit the
existence of a flaw. Yet it is im
portant, and we should shed our
misconceptions eventually. So
remember this — despite the
popularity of component stereo
systems with multi-colored dials
and switches, most of humanity
is unable to tell a good sound
system from a dixie cup on a
string. It follows from that that
although sound systems vary in
nightclubs, to most people it
doesn't really matter.
Consider two examples. The
Great American Music Hall and
the Old Waldorf have acoustic
drawbacks, despite their shared
habit of featuring high-quality
acts. But did you ever hear any

one complain about it? At the
Old Waldorf — a favorite haunt
for Peter Tosh / Patti Smith /
Warren Zevon types — it is sur
prising how badly the music is
mixed. And Great America's
beautiful gold-leaf interior can
sometimes send a trumpet solo
into an ear in a disconcerting
moment. But both places simply
don't need perfect acoustics, be
cause there are very tew perfect
ears. Those so blessed can find
what they need at nearly every
jazz club. (Keystone Korner for
example. That's a jazz place, and
one of the best anywhere. Jazz
places are frequented by people
who demand near-perfect acous
tics — they have it because they
need it, but other places don't.)
So that's rule two, to be noted
especially by rock fans — it
doesn't make much difference if
the weak middle range of a sys
tem is matched by a blown-out
middle ear.
Next, it is absolutely essential
to know what kind of crowd you
like. There's a world of differ
ence between Mabuhay
Gardens-variety crowds and the
rest of mankind as we know it,
for example. You gots to know
which ilk you really enjoy or else
it could destroy an evening.
Rule three has to do with tic
ket prices, but that's usually in
the paper, so forget it.
And the differences in food
and drink prices begat rule
number four. And 10, the mul
titudes were told not to forget
that gasoline is sometimes re
quired when return is made to
Palo Alto, and they were told
that they would have to sleep in
an alley. And the multitude
adhered to the commandments
of the golden calf of tuition, and
called in advance to find out the
drink minimum.
Meanwhile, over at rule
number five, everybody got the
Final Clue. When you choose a
club, and like it, go back. Fre
quent the place that treated you
like you wanted to be treated.
The psychological difference be
tween an easy ID check and the
jerk who laughs and says you
don't look 13 can be considera
ble, and a place that has extra
dancing space might turn things
around. Never underestimate
the power of a pleasant atmos
phere, once you've made up your
mind as to your definition of
"pleasant."

Ticket prices are
high for campus
events, but less
than you'd pay to
see the same
performers
elsewhere.

Music is the hardest enter
tainment category to pin down,
because it encompasses every
thing from the San Francisco
Opera to the Keystone Palo
Alto, with room in between for
Bach societies and Rolling
Stones concerts in Candlestick
Park. At the same time, the local
music scene is less monolithic
than the theatre; in any given
genre of music, it is possible to
keep track of what's happening,
and even to attend a good prop
ortion of the relevant events.
Most musical performers
spend their time traveling; the
best way to describe local musi
cal offerings is in terms of or
ganizers, who tend to stay in one
place. On campus, the most visi
ble of these organizers is the
Lively Arts at Stanford. While
the Lively Arts program contains
a variety of events, including
dapce companies, films and lec
tures, and (occasionally) drama,
the bulk of the schedule is made
up of musical acts. This year the
Lively Arts is bringing to campus
a number of soloists — pianists
Bella Davidovich and Murray
Perahia, violinists Oscar
Shumsky and Charles Trcger
(with Andre Watts at the piano),
cellists Nathaniel Rosen and
Anner Bylsma, and guitarist
Michael Lorimer to name a few
— and chamber groups — the
Emerson, Guarneri and Endell
ion quartets, the Chamber Music
Society of Lincoln Center, the
Empire Brass Quintet — several

jazz groups, and a few offbeat
acts, including the McLain fam
ily bluegrass band and an ap
pearance by modern composer
Philip Glass. For the big acts, like
Davidovich or the Guarneri
Ouartet, it may be hard to find
good seats, or any seats; the
Lively Arts conducts an aggres
sive season ticket sales campaign
each spring. For tickets to indi
vidual events, go to the Tresid
der Ticket Office. Ticket prices
are high, for campus events, but
less than you'd pay to see the
same performers elsewhere.
Don't worry about missing out
on the events; it's hard not to
hear about them. The Lively
Arts advertising campaigns, like
their ticket sales, are aggressive.
The Stanford Music Depart
ment sponsors a full season of
performances throughout the
school year, featuring campus
groups and performers. Many of
the department's students give
recitals in the upstairs lounges at
Tresidder which are open to the
public. Orchestral ensembles,
including the Stanford Sym
phony and Chamber Orchestras
and the Stanford Baroque En
semble, and the University's
vocal grops, the Chorus and
Chorale, give performances in
Dinkelspiel and the Church. The
Tresidder recitals are free; the
ensemble performances cost $1
— $3 for students. Other groups
sponsored by the department in
clude the Dunstable Singers,
performers of older choral
music, and Alea 11, the depart
ment's contemporary music en
semble. One of the nicer Stan
ford traditions is the yearly Mes
siah Sing, held at the end of each
winter quarter in Memorial
Church. This year's sing is
scheduled for Dec. 13.
The Bay Area is known as a
hotbed of "new" music. Stan
ford's contribution to this is the
Center for Computer Research
in Music and Acoustics, located
at 1600 Arastradero Rd. bet
ween Page Mill and Alpine
Roads. The CCRMA gives
periodic performances of its
latest compositions, in the even
ing under the open sky. They
suggest you bring a blanket.
The Music Dept. publishes a
quarterly calendar of events.

which can be obtained from
them or at the Tresidder Infor
mation Desk. If you wish to buy
tickets for an event in advance,
you may order them from the
department or purchase them at
the Tresidder Ticket Office.
STARTS (Student Arts st
Stanford) is a student group,
headquartered in Tresidder,
which works to involve students
in the arts. They sponsor a truly
wide variety of things: lectures,
art exhibits, excursions around
the Bay Area, classes in callig
raphy, dancing, music, etc., and
large-scale events such as the
Stanford Christmas Faire and
the Plant and Poster Sale (which
is going on right now). And, of
course, music: noon concerts on
the Tresidder patio, featuring
local rock and jazz groups,
"Classical Cafe" and other prog
rams in the Coffee House, and
live music several nights a week
at Encina Station.
At an institution that doesn't
have many "institutions" of its
own, the Stanford Savoyards
stand out. This will be the
Savoyards' ninth season of per
forming Gilbert & Sullivan
operettas in Dinkelspiel Au
ditorium. The Savoyards mem
bership is drawn from all parts of
the university: students, faculty,
staff, and community members
work together to put on the
shows. This year's productions
will be HMS Pinafore and a 1 Oth
anniversary program of selected
Savoyards highlights.
This only covers the more
formal, institutionalized, in
stances of music on campus.
Other sorts of events happen all
the time. Big-name rock con
certs will be making a comeback,
after a one year hiatus, when
Pablo Cruise plays in Frost Am
phitheatre Oct. 4. The concert is
being sponsored by the Stanford
Student Alumni Network; so far,
there has been no official an
nouncement of further concerts.
Another musical possibility is
dorm and frat parties; they often
feature live music, especially
spring quarter.
The most well-known Bay
Area purveyor of classical music
is also the one least popular
among students — the San Fran
cisco Opera. The Opera, on the

basis of its numerous big-name
guest stars, is world-reknowned.
This season's lineup includes
Marilyn Home in La Ceneren
tola and Leontyne Price in
Dialogues of the Carmelites,
along with season-opening ap
pearances by Luciano Pavarotti
and Joan Sutherland.Getting a
ticket for the performance you
want to see may be a major chal
lenge; four of the 11 operas
scheduled are sold out for their
run, and the rest are 85 to 95

percent sold out. All perfor
mances are in the War Memorial
Opera House (Civic Center, San
Francisco).
The San Francisco Symphony,
while certainly respectable, does
not quite have the world-class
status accorded the Opera. Gen
eral critical opinion concerning
its conductor of five-year's
standing, Edo de Waart, and its
one-year-old home, the Louise
M. Davies Symphony Hall, is still
up in the air. At home, though,
the SF Symphony is still the best
there is, and "going to the sym
phony" is a very popular "cul
tural thing to do" with students.
This is largely due to the Sym
phony's student outreach prog
ram; many dorms own season
tickets to the symphony, for use
by students. Programs at the
Symphony run one to two weeks,
Wednesday through Sunday;
student tickets are generally for
Wednesday night performances.
Wednesday night programs are
also broadcast on KQED radio.
The San Jose Symphony, con
ducted by George Cleve, is
mainly known for its extensive
Mostly Mozart series, giveri
every summer. This is the

group's tenth season; all perfor
mances are in the San Jose Per
forming Arts Center (one of the
area's best auditoriums) in
downtown San Jose.
Both the San Francisco and
San Jose symphonies put on
series at Flint Center, on the De
Anza College campus in Cuper
tino (a short drive south from
Stanford).
Popular music in the area can
be heard in two very different
sorts of environments. There are
the big places, from large arenas
up to football stadiums, which
only big-name acts can fill; and
there are the clubs, where you
might hear anybody. As you
might expect, the clubs are more
interesting. But first, the big
places.
Before a couple of years ago, it
was not uncommon for fairly
famous bands — Southside
Johnny and the Asbury Jukes,
Poco, Willie Nelson, The Knack
(remember, this is a couple of
years ago) — to play the Stan
ford campus, either in Frost
Amphitheatre or Maples Pavil
ion. But the group that booked
them, ASSU Special F.vents,
folded in 1980 after going

roughly $100,000 in debt. Since
then, the campus has gone con
certless while debates raged over
who should present concerts on
campus, and how. An end is in
sight, however, with Bill Graham
Presents joining forces with the
Chaparral to bring the Grateful
Dead to Frost on October 9 and
10, and with the Delta Upsilon
fraternity to present Kenny Log
gins on October 24.
Arenas in the area which at
tract top groups include Spartan
Stadium, at San Jose State; the
Cow Palace and Candlestick
Park, in San Francisco; the Oak
land Coliseum; the Concord
Pavilion, in Concord; Berkeley's
Greek Theatre; and the San Jose
Civic Auditorium. If you like
ELO, or Aerosmith, or Yes,
these are the places you'll go.
The Circle Star Theatre, just
off 101 in San Carlos, is a
medium-sized theater-in-the
round, with a revolving stage.
The quality of the acts varies, but
most of them are headliners of
the George Benson/O'Jays and
Johnny Cash-Tammy Wynette
varieties.
Newark has discos. Cleveland


Dinkelspiel Auditorium, Stanford
San Francisco's
nightclubs, even
more than Herb
Caen or the
Zodiac Killer,
distinguish this
city.

has discos. Omaha has discos.
Even Marriot's Great America
has discos.
Houston has a stadium capa
ble of accomodating Led Zeppe
lin. Seattle has a really big
stadium and they put really big
(and trashy and mindless) acts
like Aerosmith in there. Los
Angeles has two stadiums capa
ble of accomodating Aerosmith
if you count Anaheim (the Rams
did).
And every place has sym
phonies, albeit of varied quality.
Every place also has Roller
Derby rinks and experimental
theater. Every place has most
everything, if you look long
enough — even the most branch
office of all branch office met
ropoli go to pains to see that this
is true. Quality of performance
aside, it just goes to show that it
was a mistake to leave Kansas in
the first place. Maybe out there
you can't get what you want, but
you can get what you need, so to
speak.
Everything except nightclubs,
that is. San Francisco's night
clubs, even more than Herb
Caen and the Zodiac Killer, dis
tinguish this city from every in
habited community outside New
York State lines. The City has
more nightclubs than LA, for in
stance, which holds somewhere
near eight times as many in
habitants, and it offers more var
iety than LA, for example, which
holds eight times as many human
beings.
Of course it is very hard to find
one's way around when one
doesn't always know where to

go. It isn't alwpvs good to have a
billion zillion nightclubs if your
orientation issue doesn't at least
include a guide to the good ones.
As usual, the Keystone Palo
Alto is the club most folks know
about. It's not the cheapest club,
or the biggest, or the friendliest,
or the one with the best sound
(Lord, no!). But it is close, and
that means a lot to a mostly
bicycle-bound audience justifi
ably uneasy about traversing the
wilds of San Mateo on a stray
Samtrans 7F or facing the Ten
derloin district without an easy
escape route.
But location doth not a night
club make, and the Keystone is
not a nightclub, so don't let any
one tell you differently. A night
club has entertainment, but also
gives you an atmosphere and a
chance to converse. The Keys
tone Palo Alto does not exactly
fail in these goals; rather,-it blat
antly refuses to attempt reaching
them.
Consequently , the selection of
bands is like that of a small con
cert arena — country bumpkins
one night, multigenarian blues/
jazz artists the next, rapid and
rabid lobotomy rock the next.
For the latter be especially
forewarned, for Palo Alto punk
rockers are a singularly ridicul
ous bunch. Despite the kids with
skinny ties borrowed from their
fathers and the lineups of family
Buicks outside the Keystone
dropping off Skip and Cindy for
Punk Nite Out, the dancing in
side can often resemble a cross
between leapfrog and Rollerball.
If you beware the hazards,
though, the Keystone is always a
good guess in the spontaneous
"let's go to a show" rallies com
mon in dorms around the end of
a quarter.
If, on the other hand, you
enjoy the hazards and want to go
out of your way to create them,
then the Mabuhay Gardens is
waiting for you with open safety
pins. Still thriving as a Polyne
sian restaurant by day/
polyester-punk cave by night,
the Fab Mab is ideal both for
those who want to feel individual
by dressing like thousands of
other fashionable punks in $300
leather jackets and for those who
understand the colossal joke tak
ing place seven nights a week.

That's entertainment.
Another standby is the Old
Waldorf, a living will and testa
ment to Big Brother Bill
Graham's ownership of Bay
Area entertainment. Where
other nightclubs have to struggle
to get moderately successful acts
to grace their dance pits, the
Waldorf somehow consistently
draws the largest names. Never
mind that you can't see because
the stage is too low, or that you
can't hear because the ceiling is
too low (nasty business for
acoustics) and the sound system
is God-awful, or that you can't

dance because the place is scan
dalously oversold. The best
guess is that Mr. G pays folks a
lot of bread to play this breadbox
— at least then there's some jus
tification for the prices (another
drawback). In other words the
Old Waldorf is not a fun place,
understand? But good luck in
finding a name act anywhere
else.
Rule number one of nightclub
choosery specifically prohibits
parties of the first part from fol
lowing only high fame quotient
stars. High fame quotient stars
usually end up in stadiums, with

high boredom quotient warm-up
acts — you must remember that
nightclubs depend on medium
small entertainers.
"Medium-small" generally
has to do only with album sales,
however, as does the "high fame
quotient" — the point is that you
ought not wait all year for your
favorite group. They'll sell out
anyway, if they play in a night
club, so what true clubbers ought
to do is experiment with their
ears.
And you should know in ad
vance that rule number two is
not for a great many people.

It requires that you admit the
existence of a flaw. Yet it is im
portant, and we should shed our
misconceptions eventually. So
remember this — despite the
popularity of component stereo
systems with multi-colored dials
and switches, most of humanity
is unable to tell a good sound
system from a dixie cup on a
string. It follows from that that
although sound systems vary in
nightclubs, to most people it
doesn't really matter.
Consider two examples. The
Great American Music Hall and
the Old Waldorf have acoustic
drawbacks, despite their shared
habit of featuring high-quality
acts. But did you ever hear any

one complain about it? At the
Old Waldorf — a favorite haunt
for Peter Tosh / Patti Smith /
Warren Zevon types — it is sur
prising how badly the music is
mixed. And Great America's
beautiful gold-leaf interior can
sometimes send a trumpet solo
into an ear in a disconcerting
moment. But both places simply
don't need perfect acoustics, be
cause there are very tew perfect
ears. Those so blessed can find
what they need at nearly every
jazz club. (Keystone Korner for
example. That's a jazz place, and
one of the best anywhere. Jazz
places are frequented by people
who demand near-perfect acous
tics — they have it because they
need it, but other places don't.)
So that's rule two, to be noted
especially by rock fans — it
doesn't make much difference if
the weak middle range of a sys
tem is matched by a blown-out
middle ear.
Next, it is absolutely essential
to know what kind of crowd you
like. There's a world of differ
ence between Mabuhay
Gardens-variety crowds and the
rest of mankind as we know it,
for example. You gots to know
which ilk you really enjoy or else
it could destroy an evening.
Rule three has to do with tic
ket prices, but that's usually in
the paper, so forget it.
And the differences in food
and drink prices begat rule
number four. And 10, the mul
titudes were told not to forget
that gasoline is sometimes re
quired when return is made to
Palo Alto, and they were told
that they would have to sleep in
an alley. And the multitude
adhered to the commandments
of the golden calf of tuition, and
called in advance to find out the
drink minimum.
Meanwhile, over at rule
number five, everybody got the
Final Clue. When you choose a
club, and like it, go back. Fre
quent the place that treated you
like you wanted to be treated.
The psychological difference be
tween an easy ID check and the
jerk who laughs and says you
don't look 13 can be considera
ble, and a place that has extra
dancing space might turn things
around. Never underestimate
the power of a pleasant atmos
phere, once you've made up your
mind as to your definition of
"pleasant."

Ticket prices are
high for campus
events, but less
than you'd pay to
see the same
performers
elsewhere.

Music is the hardest enter
tainment category to pin down,
because it encompasses every
thing from the San Francisco
Opera to the Keystone Palo
Alto, with room in between for
Bach societies and Rolling
Stones concerts in Candlestick
Park. At the same time, the local
music scene is less monolithic
than the theatre; in any given
genre of music, it is possible to
keep track of what's happening,
and even to attend a good prop
ortion of the relevant events.
Most musical performers
spend their time traveling; the
best way to describe local musi
cal offerings is in terms of or
ganizers, who tend to stay in one
place. On campus, the most visi
ble of these organizers is the
Lively Arts at Stanford. While
the Lively Arts program contains
a variety of events, including
dapce companies, films and lec
tures, and (occasionally) drama,
the bulk of the schedule is made
up of musical acts. This year the
Lively Arts is bringing to campus
a number of soloists — pianists
Bella Davidovich and Murray
Perahia, violinists Oscar
Shumsky and Charles Trcger
(with Andre Watts at the piano),
cellists Nathaniel Rosen and
Anner Bylsma, and guitarist
Michael Lorimer to name a few
— and chamber groups — the
Emerson, Guarneri and Endell
ion quartets, the Chamber Music
Society of Lincoln Center, the
Empire Brass Quintet — several

jazz groups, and a few offbeat
acts, including the McLain fam
ily bluegrass band and an ap
pearance by modern composer
Philip Glass. For the big acts, like
Davidovich or the Guarneri
Ouartet, it may be hard to find
good seats, or any seats; the
Lively Arts conducts an aggres
sive season ticket sales campaign
each spring. For tickets to indi
vidual events, go to the Tresid
der Ticket Office. Ticket prices
are high, for campus events, but
less than you'd pay to see the
same performers elsewhere.
Don't worry about missing out
on the events; it's hard not to
hear about them. The Lively
Arts advertising campaigns, like
their ticket sales, are aggressive.
The Stanford Music Depart
ment sponsors a full season of
performances throughout the
school year, featuring campus
groups and performers. Many of
the department's students give
recitals in the upstairs lounges at
Tresidder which are open to the
public. Orchestral ensembles,
including the Stanford Sym
phony and Chamber Orchestras
and the Stanford Baroque En
semble, and the University's
vocal grops, the Chorus and
Chorale, give performances in
Dinkelspiel and the Church. The
Tresidder recitals are free; the
ensemble performances cost $1
— $3 for students. Other groups
sponsored by the department in
clude the Dunstable Singers,
performers of older choral
music, and Alea 11, the depart
ment's contemporary music en
semble. One of the nicer Stan
ford traditions is the yearly Mes
siah Sing, held at the end of each
winter quarter in Memorial
Church. This year's sing is
scheduled for Dec. 13.
The Bay Area is known as a
hotbed of "new" music. Stan
ford's contribution to this is the
Center for Computer Research
in Music and Acoustics, located
at 1600 Arastradero Rd. bet
ween Page Mill and Alpine
Roads. The CCRMA gives
periodic performances of its
latest compositions, in the even
ing under the open sky. They
suggest you bring a blanket.
The Music Dept. publishes a
quarterly calendar of events.

which can be obtained from
them or at the Tresidder Infor

tickets for an event in advance,
you may order them from the
department or purchase them at
the Tresidder Ticket Office.
STARTS (Student Arts st
Stanford) is a student group,
headquartered in Tresidder,
which works to involve students
in the arts. They sponsor a truly
wide variety of things: lectures,
art exhibits, excursions around
the Bay Area, classes in callig
raphy, dancing, music, etc., and
large-scale events such as the
Stanford Christmas Faire and
the Plant and Poster Sale (which
is going on right now). And, of
course, music: noon concerts on
the Tresidder patio, featuring
local rock and jazz groups,
"Classical Cafe" and other prog
rams in the Coffee House, and
live music several nights a week
at Encina Station.
At an institution that doesn't
have many "institutions" of its
own, the Stanford Savoyards
stand out. This will be the
Savoyards' ninth season of per
forming Gilbert & Sullivan
operettas in Dinkelspiel Au
ditorium. The Savoyards mem
bership is drawn from all parts of
the university: students, faculty,
staff, and community members
work together to put on the
shows. This year's productions
will be HMS Pinafore and a 1 Oth
anniversary program of selected
Savoyards highlights.
This only covers the more
formal, institutionalized, in
stances of music on campus.
Other sorts of events happen all
the time. Big-name rock con
certs will be making a comeback,
after a one year hiatus, when
Pablo Cruise plays in Frost Am
phitheatre Oct. 4. The concert is
being sponsored by the Stanford
Student Alumni Network; so far,
there has been no official an
nouncement of further concerts.
Another musical possibility is
dorm and frat parties; they often
feature live music, especially
spring quarter.
The most well-known Bay
Area purveyor of classical music
is also the one least popular
among students — the San Fran
cisco Opera. The Opera, on the

basis of its numerous big-name
guest stars, is world-reknowned.
This season's lineup includes
Marilyn Home in La Ceneren
tola and Leontyne Price in
Dialogues of the Carmelites,
along with season-opening ap
pearances by Luciano Pavarotti
and Joan Sutherland.Getting a
ticket for the performance you
want to see may be a major chal
lenge; four of the 11 operas
scheduled are sold out for their
run, and the rest are 85 to 95

percent sold out. All perfor
mances are in the War Memorial
Opera House (Civic Center, San
Francisco).
The San Francisco Symphony,
while certainly respectable, does
not quite have the world-class
status accorded the Opera. Gen
eral critical opinion concerning
its conductor of five-year's
standing, Edo de Waart, and its
one-year-old home, the Louise
M. Davies Symphony Hall, is still
up in the air. At home, though,
the SF Symphony is still the best
there is, and "going to the sym
phony" is a very popular "cul
tural thing to do" with students.
This is largely due to the Sym
phony's student outreach prog
ram; many dorms own season
tickets to the symphony, for use
by students. Programs at the
Symphony run one to two weeks,
Wednesday through Sunday;
student tickets are generally for
Wednesday night performances.
Wednesday night programs are
also broadcast on KQED radio.
The San Jose Symphony, con
ducted by George Cleve, is
mainly known for its extensive
Mostly Mozart series, giveri
every summer. This is the

group's tenth season; all perfor
mances are in the San Jose Per
forming Arts Center (one of the
area's best auditoriums) in
downtown San Jose.
Both the San Francisco and
San Jose symphonies put on
series at Flint Center, on the De
Anza College campus in Cuper
tino (a short drive south from
Stanford).
Popular music in the area can
be heard in two very different
sorts of environments. There are
the big places, from large arenas
up to football stadiums, which
only big-name acts can fill; and
there are the clubs, where you
might hear anybody. As you
might expect, the clubs are more
interesting. But first, the big
places.
Before a couple of years ago, it
was not uncommon for fairly
famous bands — Southside
Johnny and the Asbury Jukes,
Poco, Willie Nelson, The Knack
(remember, this is a couple of
years ago) — to play the Stan
ford campus, either in Frost
Amphitheatre or Maples Pavil
ion. But the group that booked
them, ASSU Special F.vents,
folded in 1980 after going

roughly $100,000 in debt. Since
then, the campus has gone con
certless while debates raged over
who should present concerts on
campus, and how. An end is in
sight, however, with Bill Graham
Presents joining forces with the
Chaparral to bring the Grateful
Dead to Frost on October 9 and
10, and with the Delta Upsilon
fraternity to present Kenny Log
gins on October 24.
Arenas in the area which at
tract top groups include Spartan
Stadium, at San Jose State; the
Cow Palace and Candlestick
Park, in San Francisco; the Oak
land Coliseum; the Concord
Pavilion, in Concord; Berkeley's
Greek Theatre; and the San Jose
Civic Auditorium. If you like
ELO, or Aerosmith, or Yes,
these are the places you'll go.
The Circle Star Theatre, just
off 101 in San Carlos, is a
medium-sized theater-in-the
round, with a revolving stage.
The quality of the acts varies, but
most of them are headliners of
the George Benson/O'Jays and
Johnny Cash-Tammy Wynette
varieties.
Newark has discos. Cleveland


Dinkelspiel Auditorium, Stanford
San Francisco's
nightclubs, even
more than Herb
Caen or the
Zodiac Killer,
distinguish this
city.

has discos. Omaha has discos.
Even Marriot's Great America
has discos.
Houston has a stadium capa
ble of accomodating Led Zeppe
lin. Seattle has a really big
stadium and they put really big
(and trashy and mindless) acts
like Aerosmith in there. Los
Angeles has two stadiums capa
ble of accomodating Aerosmith
if you count Anaheim (the Rams
did).
And every place has sym
phonies, albeit of varied quality.
Every place also has Roller
Derby rinks and experimental
theater. Every place has most
everything, if you look long
enough — even the most branch
office of all branch office met
ropoli go to pains to see that this
is true. Quality of performance
aside, it just goes to show that it
was a mistake to leave Kansas in
the first place. Maybe out there
you can't get what you want, but
you can get what you need, so to
speak.
Everything except nightclubs,
that is. San Francisco's night
clubs, even more than Herb
Caen and the Zodiac Killer, dis
tinguish this city from every in
habited community outside New
York State lines. The City has
more nightclubs than LA, for in
stance, which holds somewhere
near eight times as many in
habitants, and it offers more var
iety than LA, for example, which
holds eight times as many human
beings.
Of course it is very hard to find
one's way around when one
doesn't always know where to

go. It isn't alwpvs good to have a
billion zillion nightclubs if your
orientation issue doesn't at least
include a guide to the good ones.
As usual, the Keystone Palo
Alto is the club most folks know
about. It's not the cheapest club,
or the biggest, or the friendliest,
or the one with the best sound
(Lord, no!). But it is close, and
that means a lot to a mostly
bicycle-bound audience justifi
ably uneasy about traversing the
wilds of San Mateo on a stray
Samtrans 7F or facing the Ten
derloin district without an easy
escape route.
But location doth not a night
club make, and the Keystone is
not a nightclub, so don't let any
one tell you differently. A night
club has entertainment, but also
gives you an atmosphere and a
chance to converse. The Keys
tone Palo Alto does not exactly
fail in these goals; rather,-it blat
antly refuses to attempt reaching
them.
Consequently , the selection of
bands is like that of a small con
cert arena — country bumpkins
one night, multigenarian blues/
jazz artists the next, rapid and
rabid lobotomy rock the next.
For the latter be especially
forewarned, for Palo Alto punk
rockers are a singularly ridicul
ous bunch. Despite the kids with
skinny ties borrowed from their
fathers and the lineups of family
Buicks outside the Keystone
dropping off Skip and Cindy for
Punk Nite Out, the dancing in
side can often resemble a cross
between leapfrog and Rollerball.
If you beware the hazards,
though, the Keystone is always a
good guess in the spontaneous
"let's go to a show" rallies com
mon in dorms around the end of
a quarter.
If, on the other hand, you
enjoy the hazards and want to go
out of your way to create them,
then the Mabuhay Gardens is
waiting for you with open safety
pins. Still thriving as a Polyne
sian restaurant by day/
polyester-punk cave by night,
the Fab Mab is ideal both for
those who want to feel individual
by dressing like thousands of
other fashionable punks in $300
leather jackets and for those who
understand the colossal joke tak
ing place seven nights a week.

That's entertainment.
Another standby is the Old
Waldorf, a living will and testa
ment to Big Brother Bill
Graham's ownership of Bay
Area entertainment. Where
other nightclubs have to struggle
to get moderately successful acts
to grace their dance pits, the
Waldorf somehow consistently
draws the largest names. Never
mind that you can't see because
the stage is too low, or that you
can't hear because the ceiling is
too low (nasty business for
acoustics) and the sound system
is God-awful, or that you can't

dance because the place is scan
dalously oversold. The best
guess is that Mr. G pays folks a
lot of bread to play this breadbox
— at least then there's some jus
tification for the prices (another
drawback). In other words the
Old Waldorf is not a fun place,
understand? But good luck in
finding a name act anywhere
else.
Rule number one of nightclub
choosery specifically prohibits
parties of the first part from fol
lowing only high fame quotient
stars. High fame quotient stars
usually end up in stadiums, with

high boredom quotient warm-up
acts — you must remember that
nightclubs depend on medium
small entertainers.
"Medium-small" generally
has to do only with album sales,
however, as does the "high fame
quotient" — the point is that you
ought not wait all year for your
favorite group. They'll sell out
anyway, if they play in a night
club, so what true clubbers ought
to do is experiment with their
ears.
And you should know in ad
vance that rule number two is
not for a great many people.

It requires that you admit the
existence of a flaw. Yet it is im
portant, and we should shed our
misconceptions eventually. So
remember this — despite the
popularity of component stereo
systems with multi-colored dials
and switches, most of humanity
is unable to tell a good sound
system from a dixie cup on a
string. It follows from that that
although sound systems vary in
nightclubs, to most people it
doesn't really matter.
Consider two examples. The
Great American Music Hall and
the Old Waldorf have acoustic
drawbacks, despite their shared
habit of featuring high-quality
acts. But did you ever hear any

one complain about it? At the
Old Waldorf — a favorite haunt
for Peter Tosh / Patti Smith /
Warren Zevon types — it is sur
prising how badly the music is
mixed. And Great America's
beautiful gold-leaf interior can
sometimes send a trumpet solo
into an ear in a disconcerting
moment. But both places simply
don't need perfect acoustics, be
cause there are very tew perfect
ears. Those so blessed can find
what they need at nearly every
jazz club. (Keystone Korner for
example. That's a jazz place, and
one of the best anywhere. Jazz
places are frequented by people
who demand near-perfect acous
tics — they have it because they
need it, but other places don't.)
So that's rule two, to be noted
especially by rock fans — it
doesn't make much difference if
the weak middle range of a sys
tem is matched by a blown-out
middle ear.
Next, it is absolutely essential
to know what kind of crowd you
like. There's a world of differ
ence between Mabuhay
Gardens-variety crowds and the
rest of mankind as we know it,
for example. You gots to know
which ilk you really enjoy or else
it could destroy an evening.
Rule three has to do with tic
ket prices, but that's usually in
the paper, so forget it.
And the differences in food
and drink prices begat rule
number four. And 10, the mul
titudes were told not to forget
that gasoline is sometimes re
quired when return is made to
Palo Alto, and they were told
that they would have to sleep in
an alley. And the multitude
adhered to the commandments
of the golden calf of tuition, and
called in advance to find out the
drink minimum.
Meanwhile, over at rule
number five, everybody got the
Final Clue. When you choose a
club, and like it, go back. Fre
quent the place that treated you
like you wanted to be treated.
The psychological difference be
tween an easy ID check and the
jerk who laughs and says you
don't look 13 can be considera
ble, and a place that has extra
dancing space might turn things
around. Never underestimate
the power of a pleasant atmos
phere, once you've made up your
mind as to your definition of
"pleasant."

Ticket prices are
high for campus
events, but less
than you'd pay to
see the same
performers
elsewhere.

Music is the hardest enter
tainment category to pin down,
because it encompasses every
thing from the San Francisco
Opera to the Keystone Palo
Alto, with room in between for
Bach societies and Rolling
Stones concerts in Candlestick
Park. At the same time, the local
music scene is less monolithic
than the theatre; in any given
genre of music, it is possible to
keep track of what's happening,
and even to attend a good prop
ortion of the relevant events.
Most musical performers
spend their time traveling; the
best way to describe local musi
cal offerings is in terms of or
ganizers, who tend to stay in one
place. On campus, the most visi
ble of these organizers is the
Lively Arts at Stanford. While
the Lively Arts program contains
a variety of events, including
dapce companies, films and lec
tures, and (occasionally) drama,
the bulk of the schedule is made
up of musical acts. This year the
Lively Arts is bringing to campus
a number of soloists — pianists
Bella Davidovich and Murray
Perahia, violinists Oscar
Shumsky and Charles Trcger
(with Andre Watts at the piano),
cellists Nathaniel Rosen and
Anner Bylsma, and guitarist
Michael Lorimer to name a few
— and chamber groups — the
Emerson, Guarneri and Endell
ion quartets, the Chamber Music
Society of Lincoln Center, the
Empire Brass Quintet — several

jazz groups, and a few offbeat
acts, including the McLain fam
ily bluegrass band and an ap
pearance by modern composer
Philip Glass. For the big acts, like
Davidovich or the Guarneri
Ouartet, it may be hard to find
good seats, or any seats; the
Lively Arts conducts an aggres
sive season ticket sales campaign
each spring. For tickets to indi
vidual events, go to the Tresid
der Ticket Office. Ticket prices
are high, for campus events, but
less than you'd pay to see the
same performers elsewhere.
Don't worry about missing out
on the events; it's hard not to
hear about them. The Lively
Arts advertising campaigns, like
their ticket sales, are aggressive.
The Stanford Music Depart
ment sponsors a full season of
performances throughout the
school year, featuring campus
groups and performers. Many of
the department's students give
recitals in the upstairs lounges at
Tresidder which are open to the
public. Orchestral ensembles,
including the Stanford Sym
phony and Chamber Orchestras
and the Stanford Baroque En
semble, and the University's
vocal grops, the Chorus and
Chorale, give performances in
Dinkelspiel and the Church. The
Tresidder recitals are free; the
ensemble performances cost $1
— $3 for students. Other groups
sponsored by the department in
clude the Dunstable Singers,
performers of older choral
music, and Alea 11, the depart
ment's contemporary music en
semble. One of the nicer Stan
ford traditions is the yearly Mes
siah Sing, held at the end of each
winter quarter in Memorial
Church. This year's sing is
scheduled for Dec. 13.
The Bay Area is known as a
hotbed of "new" music. Stan
ford's contribution to this is the
Center for Computer Research
in Music and Acoustics, located
at 1600 Arastradero Rd. bet
ween Page Mill and Alpine
Roads. The CCRMA gives
periodic performances of its
latest compositions, in the even
ing under the open sky. They
suggest you bring a blanket.
The Music Dept. publishes a
quarterly calendar of events.

which can be obtained from
them or at the Tresidder Infor
mation Desk. If you wish to buy
tickets for an event in advance,
you may order them from the
department or purchase them at
the Tresidder Ticket Office.
STARTS (Student Arts st
Stanford) is a student group,
headquartered in Tresidder,
which works to involve students
in the arts. They sponsor a truly
wide variety of things: lectures,
art exhibits, excursions around
the Bay Area, classes in callig
raphy, dancing, music, etc., and
large-scale events such as the
Stanford Christmas Faire and
the Plant and Poster Sale (which
is going on right now). And, of
course, music: noon concerts on
the Tresidder patio, featuring
local rock and jazz groups,
"Classical Cafe" and other prog
rams in the Coffee House, and
live music several nights a week
at Encina Station.
At an institution that doesn't
have many "institutions" of its
own, the Stanford Savoyards
stand out. This will be the
Savoyards' ninth season of per
forming Gilbert & Sullivan
operettas in Dinkelspiel Au
ditorium. The Savoyards mem
bership is drawn from all parts of
the university: students, faculty,
staff, and community members
work together to put on the
shows. This year's productions
will be HMS Pinafore and a 1 Oth
anniversary program of selected
Savoyards highlights.
This only covers the more
formal, institutionalized, in
stances of music on campus.
Other sorts of events happen all
the time. Big-name rock con
certs will be making a comeback,
after a one year hiatus, when
Pablo Cruise plays in Frost Am
phitheatre Oct. 4. The concert is
being sponsored by the Stanford
Student Alumni Network; so far,
there has been no official an
nouncement of further concerts.
Another musical possibility is
dorm and frat parties; they often
feature live music, especially
spring quarter.
The most well-known Bay
Area purveyor of classical music
is also the one least popular
among students — the San Fran
cisco Opera. The Opera, on the

basis of its numerous big-name
guest stars, is world-reknowned.
This season's lineup includes
Marilyn Home in La Ceneren
tola and Leontyne Price in
Dialogues of the Carmelites,
along with season-opening ap
pearances by Luciano Pavarotti
and Joan Sutherland.Getting a
ticket for the performance you
want to see may be a major chal
lenge; four of the 11 operas
scheduled are sold out for their
run, and the rest are 85 to 95

percent sold out. All perfor
mances are in the War Memorial
Opera House (Civic Center, San
Francisco).
The San Francisco Symphony,
while certainly respectable, does
not quite have the world-class
status accorded the Opera. Gen
eral critical opinion concerning
its conductor of five-year's
standing, Edo de Waart, and its
one-year-old home, the Louise
M. Davies Symphony Hall, is still
up in the air. At home, though,
the SF Symphony is still the best
there is, and "going to the sym
phony" is a very popular "cul
tural thing to do" with students.
This is largely due to the Sym
phony's student outreach prog
ram; many dorms own season
tickets to the symphony, for use
by students. Programs at the
Symphony run one to two weeks,
Wednesday through Sunday;
student tickets are generally for
Wednesday night performances.
Wednesday night programs are
also broadcast on KQED radio.
The San Jose Symphony, con
ducted by George Cleve, is
mainly known for its extensive
Mostly Mozart series, giveri
every summer. This is the

group's tenth season; all perfor
mances are in the San Jose Per
forming Arts Center (one of the
area's best auditoriums) in
downtown San Jose.
Both the San Francisco and
San Jose symphonies put on
series at Flint Center, on the De
Anza College campus in Cuper
tino (a short drive south from
Stanford).
Popular music in the area can
be heard in two very different
sorts of environments. There are
the big places, from large arenas
up to football stadiums, which
only big-name acts can fill; and
there are the clubs, where you
might hear anybody. As you
might expect, the clubs are more
interesting. But first, the big
places.
Before a couple of years ago, it
was not uncommon for fairly
famous bands — Southside
Johnny and the Asbury Jukes,
Poco, Willie Nelson, The Knack
(remember, this is a couple of
years ago) — to play the Stan
ford campus, either in Frost
Amphitheatre or Maples Pavil
ion. But the group that booked
them, ASSU Special F.vents,
folded in 1980 after going

roughly $100,000 in debt. Since
then, the campus has gone con
certless while debates raged over
who should present concerts on
campus, and how. An end is in
sight, however, with Bill Graham
Presents joining forces with the
Chaparral to bring the Grateful
Dead to Frost on October 9 and
10, and with the Delta Upsilon
fraternity to present Kenny Log
gins on October 24.
Arenas in the area which at
tract top groups include Spartan
Stadium, at San Jose State; the
Cow Palace and Candlestick
Park, in San Francisco; the Oak
land Coliseum; the Concord
Pavilion, in Concord; Berkeley's
Greek Theatre; and the San Jose
Civic Auditorium. If you like
ELO, or Aerosmith, or Yes,
these are the places you'll go.
The Circle Star Theatre, just
off 101 in San Carlos, is a
medium-sized theater-in-the
round, with a revolving stage.
The quality of the acts varies, but
most of them are headliners of
the George Benson/O'Jays and
Johnny Cash-Tammy Wynette
varieties.
Newark has discos. Cleveland

San Francisco's

more than Herb

city.

has discos. Omaha has discos.
Even Marriot's Great America
has discos.
Houston has a stadium capa
ble of accomodating Led Zeppe
lin. Seattle has a really big
stadium and they put really big
(and trashy and mindless) acts
like Aerosmith in there. Los
Angeles has two stadiums capa
ble of accomodating Aerosmith
if you count Anaheim (the Rams
did).
And every place has sym
phonies, albeit of varied quality.
Every place also has Roller
Derby rinks and experimental
theater. Every place has most
everything, if you look long
enough — even the most branch
office of all branch office met
ropoli go to pains to see that this
is true. Quality of performance
aside, it just goes to show that it
was a mistake to leave Kansas in
the first place. Maybe out there
you can't get what you want, but
you can get what you need, so to
speak.
Everything except nightclubs,
that is. San Francisco's night
clubs, even more than Herb
Caen and the Zodiac Killer, dis
tinguish this city from every in
habited community outside New
York State lines. The City has
more nightclubs than LA, for in
stance, which holds somewhere
near eight times as many in
habitants, and it offers more var
iety than LA, for example, which
holds eight times as many human
beings.
Of course it is very hard to find
one's way around when one
doesn't always know where to

go. It isn't alwpvs good to have a
billion zillion nightclubs if your
orientation issue doesn't at least
include a guide to the good ones.
As usual, the Keystone Palo
Alto is the club most folks know
about. It's not the cheapest club,
or the biggest, or the friendliest,
or the one with the best sound
(Lord, no!). But it is close, and
that means a lot to a mostly
bicycle-bound audience justifi
ably uneasy about traversing the
wilds of San Mateo on a stray
Samtrans 7F or facing the Ten
derloin district without an easy
escape route.
But location doth not a night
club make, and the Keystone is
not a nightclub, so don't let any
one tell you differently. A night
club has entertainment, but also
gives you an atmosphere and a
chance to converse. The Keys
tone Palo Alto does not exactly
fail in these goals; rather,-it blat
antly refuses to attempt reaching
them.
Consequently , the selection of
bands is like that of a small con
cert arena — country bumpkins
one night, multigenarian blues/
jazz artists the next, rapid and
rabid lobotomy rock the next.
For the latter be especially
forewarned, for Palo Alto punk
rockers are a singularly ridicul
ous bunch. Despite the kids with
skinny ties borrowed from their
fathers and the lineups of family
Buicks outside the Keystone
dropping off Skip and Cindy for
Punk Nite Out, the dancing in
side can often resemble a cross
between leapfrog and Rollerball.
If you beware the hazards,
though, the Keystone is always a
good guess in the spontaneous
"let's go to a show" rallies com
mon in dorms around the end of
a quarter.
If, on the other hand, you
enjoy the hazards and want to go
out of your way to create them,
then the Mabuhay Gardens is
waiting for you with open safety
pins. Still thriving as a Polyne
sian restaurant by day/
polyester-punk cave by night,
the Fab Mab is ideal both for
those who want to feel individual
by dressing like thousands of
other fashionable punks in $300
leather jackets and for those who
understand the colossal joke tak
ing place seven nights a week.

That's entertainment.
Another standby is the Old
Waldorf, a living will and testa
ment to Big Brother Bill
Graham's ownership of Bay
Area entertainment. Where
other nightclubs have to struggle
to get moderately successful acts
to grace their dance pits, the
Waldorf somehow consistently
draws the largest names. Never
mind that you can't see because
the stage is too low, or that you
can't hear because the ceiling is
too low (nasty business for
acoustics) and the sound system
is God-awful, or that you can't

dance because the place is scan
dalously oversold. The best
guess is that Mr. G pays folks a
lot of bread to play this breadbox
— at least then there's some jus
tification for the prices (another
drawback). In other words the
Old Waldorf is not a fun place,
understand? But good luck in
finding a name act anywhere
else.
Rule number one of nightclub
choosery specifically prohibits
parties of the first part from fol
lowing only high fame quotient
stars. High fame quotient stars
usually end up in stadiums, with

high boredom quotient warm-up
acts — you must remember that
nightclubs depend on medium
small entertainers.
"Medium-small" generally
has to do only with album sales,
however, as does the "high fame
quotient" — the point is that you
ought not wait all year for your
favorite group. They'll sell out
anyway, if they play in a night
club, so what true clubbers ought
to do is experiment with their
ears.
And you should know in ad
vance that rule number two is
not for a great many people.

It requires that you admit the
existence of a flaw. Yet it is im
portant, and we should shed our
misconceptions eventually. So
remember this — despite the
popularity of component stereo
systems with multi-colored dials
and switches, most of humanity
is unable to tell a good sound
system from a dixie cup on a
string. It follows from that that
although sound systems vary in
nightclubs, to most people it
doesn't really matter.
Consider two examples. The
Great American Music Hall and
the Old Waldorf have acoustic
drawbacks, despite their shared
habit of featuring high-quality
acts. But did you ever hear any

one complain about it? At the
Old Waldorf — a favorite haunt
for Peter Tosh / Patti Smith /
Warren Zevon types — it is sur
prising how badly the music is
mixed. And Great America's
beautiful gold-leaf interior can
sometimes send a trumpet solo
into an ear in a disconcerting
moment. But both places simply
don't need perfect acoustics, be
cause there are very tew perfect
ears. Those so blessed can find
what they need at nearly every
jazz club. (Keystone Korner for
example. That's a jazz place, and
one of the best anywhere. Jazz
places are frequented by people
who demand near-perfect acous
tics — they have it because they
need it, but other places don't.)
So that's rule two, to be noted
especially by rock fans — it
doesn't make much difference if
the weak middle range of a sys
tem is matched by a blown-out
middle ear.
Next, it is absolutely essential
to know what kind of crowd you
like. There's a world of differ
ence between Mabuhay
Gardens-variety crowds and the
rest of mankind as we know it,
for example. You gots to know
which ilk you really enjoy or else
it could destroy an evening.
Rule three has to do with tic
ket prices, but that's usually in
the paper, so forget it.
And the differences in food
and drink prices begat rule
number four. And 10, the mul
titudes were told not to forget
that gasoline is sometimes re
quired when return is made to
Palo Alto, and they were told
that they would have to sleep in
an alley. And the multitude
adhered to the commandments
of the golden calf of tuition, and
called in advance to find out the
drink minimum.
Meanwhile, over at rule
number five, everybody got the
Final Clue. When you choose a
club, and like it, go back. Fre
quent the place that treated you
like you wanted to be treated.
The psychological difference be
tween an easy ID check and the
jerk who laughs and says you
don't look 13 can be considera
ble, and a place that has extra
dancing space might turn things
around. Never underestimate
the power of a pleasant atmos
phere, once you've made up your
mind as to your definition of
"pleasant."

Ticket prices are
high for campus
events, but less
than you'd pay to
see the same
performers
elsewhere.

Music is the hardest enter
tainment category to pin down,
because it encompasses every
thing from the San Francisco
Opera to the Keystone Palo
Alto, with room in between for
Bach societies and Rolling
Stones concerts in Candlestick
Park. At the same time, the local
music scene is less monolithic
than the theatre; in any given
genre of music, it is possible to
keep track of what's happening,
and even to attend a good prop
ortion of the relevant events.
Most musical performers
spend their time traveling; the
best way to describe local musi
cal offerings is in terms of or
ganizers, who tend to stay in one
place. On campus, the most visi
ble of these organizers is the
Lively Arts at Stanford. While
the Lively Arts program contains
a variety of events, including
dapce companies, films and lec
tures, and (occasionally) drama,
the bulk of the schedule is made
up of musical acts. This year the
Lively Arts is bringing to campus
a number of soloists — pianists
Bella Davidovich and Murray
Perahia, violinists Oscar
Shumsky and Charles Trcger
(with Andre Watts at the piano),
cellists Nathaniel Rosen and
Anner Bylsma, and guitarist
Michael Lorimer to name a few
— and chamber groups — the
Emerson, Guarneri and Endell
ion quartets, the Chamber Music
Society of Lincoln Center, the
Empire Brass Quintet — several

jazz groups, and a few offbeat
acts, including the McLain fam
ily bluegrass band and an ap
pearance by modern composer
Philip Glass. For the big acts, like
Davidovich or the Guarneri
Ouartet, it may be hard to find
good seats, or any seats; the
Lively Arts conducts an aggres
sive season ticket sales campaign
each spring. For tickets to indi
vidual events, go to the Tresid
der Ticket Office. Ticket prices
are high, for campus events, but
less than you'd pay to see the
same performers elsewhere.
Don't worry about missing out
on the events; it's hard not to
hear about them. The Lively
Arts advertising campaigns, like
their ticket sales, are aggressive.
The Stanford Music Depart
ment sponsors a full season of
performances throughout the
school year, featuring campus
groups and performers. Many of
the department's students give
recitals in the upstairs lounges at
Tresidder which are open to the
public. Orchestral ensembles,
including the Stanford Sym
phony and Chamber Orchestras
and the Stanford Baroque En
semble, and the University's
vocal grops, the Chorus and
Chorale, give performances in
Dinkelspiel and the Church. The
Tresidder recitals are free; the
ensemble performances cost $1
— $3 for students. Other groups
sponsored by the department in
clude the Dunstable Singers,
performers of older choral
music, and Alea 11, the depart
ment's contemporary music en
semble. One of the nicer Stan
ford traditions is the yearly Mes
siah Sing, held at the end of each
winter quarter in Memorial
Church. This year's sing is
scheduled for Dec. 13.
The Bay Area is known as a
hotbed of "new" music. Stan
ford's contribution to this is the
Center for Computer Research
in Music and Acoustics, located
at 1600 Arastradero Rd. bet
ween Page Mill and Alpine
Roads. The CCRMA gives
periodic performances of its
latest compositions, in the even
ing under the open sky. They
suggest you bring a blanket.
The Music Dept. publishes a
quarterly calendar of events.

you may order them from the
department or purchase them at
the Tresidder Ticket Office.
STARTS (Student Arts st
Stanford) is a student group,
headquartered in Tresidder,
which works to involve students
in the arts. They sponsor a truly
wide variety of things: lectures,
art exhibits, excursions around
the Bay Area, classes in callig
raphy, dancing, music, etc., and
large-scale events such as the
Stanford Christmas Faire and
the Plant and Poster Sale (which
is going on right now). And, of
course, music: noon concerts on
the Tresidder patio, featuring
local rock and jazz groups,
"Classical Cafe" and other prog
rams in the Coffee House, and
live music several nights a week
at Encina Station.
At an institution that doesn't
have many "institutions" of its
own, the Stanford Savoyards
stand out. This will be the
Savoyards' ninth season of per
forming Gilbert & Sullivan
operettas in Dinkelspiel Au
ditorium. The Savoyards mem
bership is drawn from all parts of
the university: students, faculty,
staff, and community members
work together to put on the
shows. This year's productions
will be HMS Pinafore and a 1 Oth
anniversary program of selected
Savoyards highlights.
This only covers the more
formal, institutionalized, in
stances of music on campus.
Other sorts of events happen all
the time. Big-name rock con
certs will be making a comeback,
after a one year hiatus, when
Pablo Cruise plays in Frost Am
phitheatre Oct. 4. The concert is
being sponsored by the Stanford
Student Alumni Network; so far,
there has been no official an
nouncement of further concerts.
Another musical possibility is
dorm and frat parties; they often
feature live music, especially
spring quarter.
The most well-known Bay
Area purveyor of classical music
is also the one least popular
among students — the San Fran
cisco Opera. The Opera, on the

basis of its numerous big-name
guest stars, is world-reknowned.
This season's lineup includes
Marilyn Home in La Ceneren
tola and Leontyne Price in
Dialogues of the Carmelites,
along with season-opening ap
pearances by Luciano Pavarotti
and Joan Sutherland.Getting a
ticket for the performance you
want to see may be a major chal
lenge; four of the 11 operas
scheduled are sold out for their
run, and the rest are 85 to 95

percent sold out. All perfor
mances are in the War Memorial
Opera House (Civic Center, San
Francisco).
The San Francisco Symphony,
while certainly respectable, does
not quite have the world-class
status accorded the Opera. Gen
eral critical opinion concerning
its conductor of five-year's
standing, Edo de Waart, and its
one-year-old home, the Louise
M. Davies Symphony Hall, is still
up in the air. At home, though,
the SF Symphony is still the best
there is, and "going to the sym
phony" is a very popular "cul
tural thing to do" with students.
This is largely due to the Sym
phony's student outreach prog
ram; many dorms own season
tickets to the symphony, for use
by students. Programs at the
Symphony run one to two weeks,
Wednesday through Sunday;
student tickets are generally for
Wednesday night performances.
Wednesday night programs are
also broadcast on KQED radio.
The San Jose Symphony, con
ducted by George Cleve, is
mainly known for its extensive
Mostly Mozart series, giveri
every summer. This is the

group's tenth season; all perfor
mances are in the San Jose Per
forming Arts Center (one of the
area's best auditoriums) in
downtown San Jose.
Both the San Francisco and
San Jose symphonies put on
series at Flint Center, on the De
Anza College campus in Cuper
tino (a short drive south from
Stanford).
Popular music in the area can
be heard in two very different
sorts of environments. There are
the big places, from large arenas
up to football stadiums, which
only big-name acts can fill; and
there are the clubs, where you
might hear anybody. As you
might expect, the clubs are more
interesting. But first, the big
places.
Before a couple of years ago, it
was not uncommon for fairly
famous bands — Southside
Johnny and the Asbury Jukes,
Poco, Willie Nelson, The Knack
(remember, this is a couple of
years ago) — to play the Stan
ford campus, either in Frost
Amphitheatre or Maples Pavil
ion. But the group that booked
them, ASSU Special F.vents,
folded in 1980 after going

roughly $100,000 in debt. Since
then, the campus has gone con
certless while debates raged over
who should present concerts on
campus, and how. An end is in
sight, however, with Bill Graham
Presents joining forces with the
Chaparral to bring the Grateful
Dead to Frost on October 9 and
10, and with the Delta Upsilon
fraternity to present Kenny Log
gins on October 24.
Arenas in the area which at
tract top groups include Spartan
Stadium, at San Jose State; the
Cow Palace and Candlestick
Park, in San Francisco; the Oak
land Coliseum; the Concord
Pavilion, in Concord; Berkeley's
Greek Theatre; and the San Jose
Civic Auditorium. If you like
ELO, or Aerosmith, or Yes,
these are the places you'll go.
The Circle Star Theatre, just
off 101 in San Carlos, is a
medium-sized theater-in-the
round, with a revolving stage.
The quality of the acts varies, but
most of them are headliners of
the George Benson/O'Jays and
Johnny Cash-Tammy Wynette
varieties.
Newark has discos. Cleveland


Dinkelspiel Auditorium, Stanford
San Francisco's
nightclubs, even
more than Herb
Caen or the
Zodiac Killer,
distinguish this
city.

has discos. Omaha has discos.
Even Marriot's Great America
has discos.
Houston has a stadium capa
ble of accomodating Led Zeppe
lin. Seattle has a really big
stadium and they put really big
(and trashy and mindless) acts
like Aerosmith in there. Los
Angeles has two stadiums capa
ble of accomodating Aerosmith
if you count Anaheim (the Rams
did).
And every place has sym
phonies, albeit of varied quality.
Every place also has Roller
Derby rinks and experimental
theater. Every place has most
everything, if you look long
enough — even the most branch
office of all branch office met
ropoli go to pains to see that this
is true. Quality of performance
aside, it just goes to show that it
was a mistake to leave Kansas in
the first place. Maybe out there
you can't get what you want, but
you can get what you need, so to
speak.
Everything except nightclubs,
that is. San Francisco's night
clubs, even more than Herb
Caen and the Zodiac Killer, dis
tinguish this city from every in
habited community outside New
York State lines. The City has
more nightclubs than LA, for in
stance, which holds somewhere
near eight times as many in
habitants, and it offers more var
iety than LA, for example, which
holds eight times as many human
beings.
Of course it is very hard to find
one's way around when one
doesn't always know where to

go. It isn't alwpvs good to have a
billion zillion nightclubs if your
orientation issue doesn't at least
include a guide to the good ones.
As usual, the Keystone Palo
Alto is the club most folks know
about. It's not the cheapest club,
or the biggest, or the friendliest,
or the one with the best sound
(Lord, no!). But it is close, and
that means a lot to a mostly
bicycle-bound audience justifi
ably uneasy about traversing the
wilds of San Mateo on a stray
Samtrans 7F or facing the Ten
derloin district without an easy
escape route.
But location doth not a night
club make, and the Keystone is
not a nightclub, so don't let any
one tell you differently. A night
club has entertainment, but also
gives you an atmosphere and a
chance to converse. The Keys
tone Palo Alto does not exactly
fail in these goals; rather,-it blat
antly refuses to attempt reaching
them.
Consequently , the selection of
bands is like that of a small con
cert arena — country bumpkins
one night, multigenarian blues/
jazz artists the next, rapid and
rabid lobotomy rock the next.
For the latter be especially
forewarned, for Palo Alto punk
rockers are a singularly ridicul
ous bunch. Despite the kids with
skinny ties borrowed from their
fathers and the lineups of family
Buicks outside the Keystone
dropping off Skip and Cindy for
Punk Nite Out, the dancing in
side can often resemble a cross
between leapfrog and Rollerball.
If you beware the hazards,
though, the Keystone is always a
good guess in the spontaneous
"let's go to a show" rallies com
mon in dorms around the end of
a quarter.
If, on the other hand, you
enjoy the hazards and want to go
out of your way to create them,
then the Mabuhay Gardens is
waiting for you with open safety
pins. Still thriving as a Polyne
sian restaurant by day/
polyester-punk cave by night,
the Fab Mab is ideal both for
those who want to feel individual
by dressing like thousands of
other fashionable punks in $300
leather jackets and for those who
understand the colossal joke tak
ing place seven nights a week.

That's entertainment.
Another standby is the Old
Waldorf, a living will and testa
ment to Big Brother Bill
Graham's ownership of Bay
Area entertainment. Where
other nightclubs have to struggle
to get moderately successful acts
to grace their dance pits, the
Waldorf somehow consistently
draws the largest names. Never
mind that you can't see because
the stage is too low, or that you
can't hear because the ceiling is
too low (nasty business for
acoustics) and the sound system
is God-awful, or that you can't

dance because the place is scan
dalously oversold. The best
guess is that Mr. G pays folks a
lot of bread to play this breadbox
— at least then there's some jus
tification for the prices (another
drawback). In other words the
Old Waldorf is not a fun place,
understand? But good luck in
finding a name act anywhere
else.
Rule number one of nightclub
choosery specifically prohibits
parties of the first part from fol
lowing only high fame quotient
stars. High fame quotient stars
usually end up in stadiums, with

high boredom quotient warm-up
acts — you must remember that
nightclubs depend on medium
small entertainers.
"Medium-small" generally
has to do only with album sales,
however, as does the "high fame
quotient" — the point is that you
ought not wait all year for your
favorite group. They'll sell out
anyway, if they play in a night
club, so what true clubbers ought
to do is experiment with their
ears.
And you should know in ad
vance that rule number two is
not for a great many people.

It requires that you admit the
existence of a flaw. Yet it is im
portant, and we should shed our
misconceptions eventually. So
remember this — despite the
popularity of component stereo
systems with multi-colored dials
and switches, most of humanity
is unable to tell a good sound
system from a dixie cup on a
string. It follows from that that
although sound systems vary in
nightclubs, to most people it
doesn't really matter.
Consider two examples. The
Great American Music Hall and
the Old Waldorf have acoustic
drawbacks, despite their shared
habit of featuring high-quality
acts. But did you ever hear any

one complain about it? At the
Old Waldorf — a favorite haunt
for Peter Tosh / Patti Smith /
Warren Zevon types — it is sur
prising how badly the music is
mixed. And Great America's
beautiful gold-leaf interior can
sometimes send a trumpet solo
into an ear in a disconcerting
moment. But both places simply
don't need perfect acoustics, be
cause there are very tew perfect
ears. Those so blessed can find
what they need at nearly every
jazz club. (Keystone Korner for
example. That's a jazz place, and
one of the best anywhere. Jazz
places are frequented by people
who demand near-perfect acous
tics — they have it because they
need it, but other places don't.)
So that's rule two, to be noted
especially by rock fans — it
doesn't make much difference if
the weak middle range of a sys
tem is matched by a blown-out
middle ear.
Next, it is absolutely essential
to know what kind of crowd you
like. There's a world of differ
ence between Mabuhay
Gardens-variety crowds and the
rest of mankind as we know it,
for example. You gots to know
which ilk you really enjoy or else
it could destroy an evening.
Rule three has to do with tic
ket prices, but that's usually in
the paper, so forget it.
And the differences in food
and drink prices begat rule
number four. And 10, the mul
titudes were told not to forget
that gasoline is sometimes re
quired when return is made to
Palo Alto, and they were told
that they would have to sleep in
an alley. And the multitude
adhered to the commandments
of the golden calf of tuition, and
called in advance to find out the
drink minimum.
Meanwhile, over at rule
number five, everybody got the
Final Clue. When you choose a
club, and like it, go back. Fre
quent the place that treated you
like you wanted to be treated.
The psychological difference be
tween an easy ID check and the
jerk who laughs and says you
don't look 13 can be considera
ble, and a place that has extra
dancing space might turn things
around. Never underestimate
the power of a pleasant atmos
phere, once you've made up your
mind as to your definition of
"pleasant."

Ticket prices are
high for campus
events, but less
than you'd pay to
see the same
performers
elsewhere.

Music is the hardest enter
tainment category to pin down,
because it encompasses every
thing from the San Francisco
Opera to the Keystone Palo
Alto, with room in between for
Bach societies and Rolling
Stones concerts in Candlestick
Park. At the same time, the local
music scene is less monolithic
than the theatre; in any given
genre of music, it is possible to
keep track of what's happening,
and even to attend a good prop
ortion of the relevant events.
Most musical performers
spend their time traveling; the
best way to describe local musi
cal offerings is in terms of or
ganizers, who tend to stay in one
place. On campus, the most visi
ble of these organizers is the
Lively Arts at Stanford. While
the Lively Arts program contains
a variety of events, including
dapce companies, films and lec
tures, and (occasionally) drama,
the bulk of the schedule is made
up of musical acts. This year the
Lively Arts is bringing to campus
a number of soloists — pianists
Bella Davidovich and Murray
Perahia, violinists Oscar
Shumsky and Charles Trcger
(with Andre Watts at the piano),
cellists Nathaniel Rosen and
Anner Bylsma, and guitarist
Michael Lorimer to name a few
— and chamber groups — the
Emerson, Guarneri and Endell
ion quartets, the Chamber Music
Society of Lincoln Center, the
Empire Brass Quintet — several

jazz groups, and a few offbeat
acts, including the McLain fam
ily bluegrass band and an ap
pearance by modern composer
Philip Glass. For the big acts, like
Davidovich or the Guarneri
Ouartet, it may be hard to find
good seats, or any seats; the
Lively Arts conducts an aggres
sive season ticket sales campaign
each spring. For tickets to indi
vidual events, go to the Tresid
der Ticket Office. Ticket prices
are high, for campus events, but
less than you'd pay to see the
same performers elsewhere.
Don't worry about missing out
on the events; it's hard not to
hear about them. The Lively
Arts advertising campaigns, like
their ticket sales, are aggressive.
The Stanford Music Depart
ment sponsors a full season of
performances throughout the
school year, featuring campus
groups and performers. Many of
the department's students give
recitals in the upstairs lounges at
Tresidder which are open to the
public. Orchestral ensembles,
including the Stanford Sym
phony and Chamber Orchestras
and the Stanford Baroque En
semble, and the University's
vocal grops, the Chorus and
Chorale, give performances in
Dinkelspiel and the Church. The
Tresidder recitals are free; the
ensemble performances cost $1
— $3 for students. Other groups
sponsored by the department in
clude the Dunstable Singers,
performers of older choral
music, and Alea 11, the depart
ment's contemporary music en
semble. One of the nicer Stan
ford traditions is the yearly Mes
siah Sing, held at the end of each
winter quarter in Memorial
Church. This year's sing is
scheduled for Dec. 13.
The Bay Area is known as a
hotbed of "new" music. Stan
ford's contribution to this is the
Center for Computer Research
in Music and Acoustics, located
at 1600 Arastradero Rd. bet
ween Page Mill and Alpine
Roads. The CCRMA gives
periodic performances of its
latest compositions, in the even
ing under the open sky. They

the Tresidder Ticket Office.
STARTS (Student Arts st
Stanford) is a student group,
headquartered in Tresidder,
which works to involve students
in the arts. They sponsor a truly
wide variety of things: lectures,
art exhibits, excursions around
the Bay Area, classes in callig
raphy, dancing, music, etc., and
large-scale events such as the
Stanford Christmas Faire and
the Plant and Poster Sale (which
is going on right now). And, of
course, music: noon concerts on
the Tresidder patio, featuring
local rock and jazz groups,
"Classical Cafe" and other prog
rams in the Coffee House, and
live music several nights a week
at Encina Station.
At an institution that doesn't
have many "institutions" of its
own, the Stanford Savoyards
stand out. This will be the
Savoyards' ninth season of per
forming Gilbert & Sullivan
operettas in Dinkelspiel Au
ditorium. The Savoyards mem
bership is drawn from all parts of
the university: students, faculty,
staff, and community members
work together to put on the
shows. This year's productions
will be HMS Pinafore and a 1 Oth
anniversary program of selected
Savoyards highlights.
This only covers the more
formal, institutionalized, in
stances of music on campus.
Other sorts of events happen all
the time. Big-name rock con
certs will be making a comeback,
after a one year hiatus, when
Pablo Cruise plays in Frost Am
phitheatre Oct. 4. The concert is
being sponsored by the Stanford
Student Alumni Network; so far,
there has been no official an
nouncement of further concerts.
Another musical possibility is
dorm and frat parties; they often
feature live music, especially
spring quarter.
The most well-known Bay
Area purveyor of classical music
is also the one least popular
among students — the San Fran
cisco Opera. The Opera, on the

basis of its numerous big-name
guest stars, is world-reknowned.
This season's lineup includes
Marilyn Home in La Ceneren
tola and Leontyne Price in
Dialogues of the Carmelites,
along with season-opening ap
pearances by Luciano Pavarotti
and Joan Sutherland.Getting a
ticket for the performance you
want to see may be a major chal
lenge; four of the 11 operas
scheduled are sold out for their
run, and the rest are 85 to 95

percent sold out. All perfor
mances are in the War Memorial
Opera House (Civic Center, San
Francisco).
The San Francisco Symphony,
while certainly respectable, does
not quite have the world-class
status accorded the Opera. Gen
eral critical opinion concerning
its conductor of five-year's
standing, Edo de Waart, and its
one-year-old home, the Louise
M. Davies Symphony Hall, is still
up in the air. At home, though,
the SF Symphony is still the best
there is, and "going to the sym
phony" is a very popular "cul
tural thing to do" with students.
This is largely due to the Sym
phony's student outreach prog
ram; many dorms own season
tickets to the symphony, for use
by students. Programs at the
Symphony run one to two weeks,
Wednesday through Sunday;
student tickets are generally for
Wednesday night performances.
Wednesday night programs are
also broadcast on KQED radio.
The San Jose Symphony, con
ducted by George Cleve, is
mainly known for its extensive
Mostly Mozart series, giveri
every summer. This is the

group's tenth season; all perfor
mances are in the San Jose Per
forming Arts Center (one of the
area's best auditoriums) in
downtown San Jose.
Both the San Francisco and
San Jose symphonies put on
series at Flint Center, on the De
Anza College campus in Cuper
tino (a short drive south from
Stanford).
Popular music in the area can
be heard in two very different
sorts of environments. There are
the big places, from large arenas
up to football stadiums, which
only big-name acts can fill; and
there are the clubs, where you
might hear anybody. As you
might expect, the clubs are more
interesting. But first, the big
places.
Before a couple of years ago, it
was not uncommon for fairly
famous bands — Southside
Johnny and the Asbury Jukes,
Poco, Willie Nelson, The Knack
(remember, this is a couple of
years ago) — to play the Stan
ford campus, either in Frost
Amphitheatre or Maples Pavil
ion. But the group that booked
them, ASSU Special F.vents,
folded in 1980 after going

roughly $100,000 in debt. Since
then, the campus has gone con
certless while debates raged over
who should present concerts on
campus, and how. An end is in
sight, however, with Bill Graham
Presents joining forces with the
Chaparral to bring the Grateful
Dead to Frost on October 9 and
10, and with the Delta Upsilon
fraternity to present Kenny Log
gins on October 24.
Arenas in the area which at
tract top groups include Spartan
Stadium, at San Jose State; the
Cow Palace and Candlestick
Park, in San Francisco; the Oak
land Coliseum; the Concord
Pavilion, in Concord; Berkeley's
Greek Theatre; and the San Jose
Civic Auditorium. If you like
ELO, or Aerosmith, or Yes,
these are the places you'll go.
The Circle Star Theatre, just
off 101 in San Carlos, is a
medium-sized theater-in-the
round, with a revolving stage.
The quality of the acts varies, but
most of them are headliners of
the George Benson/O'Jays and
Johnny Cash-Tammy Wynette
varieties.
Newark has discos. Cleveland

has discos. Omaha has discos.
Even Marriot's Great America
has discos.
Houston has a stadium capa
ble of accomodating Led Zeppe
lin. Seattle has a really big
stadium and they put really big
(and trashy and mindless) acts
like Aerosmith in there. Los
Angeles has two stadiums capa
ble of accomodating Aerosmith
if you count Anaheim (the Rams
did).
And every place has sym
phonies, albeit of varied quality.
Every place also has Roller
Derby rinks and experimental
theater. Every place has most
everything, if you look long
enough — even the most branch
office of all branch office met
ropoli go to pains to see that this
is true. Quality of performance
aside, it just goes to show that it
was a mistake to leave Kansas in
the first place. Maybe out there
you can't get what you want, but
you can get what you need, so to
speak.
Everything except nightclubs,
that is. San Francisco's night
clubs, even more than Herb
Caen and the Zodiac Killer, dis
tinguish this city from every in
habited community outside New
York State lines. The City has
more nightclubs than LA, for in
stance, which holds somewhere
near eight times as many in
habitants, and it offers more var
iety than LA, for example, which
holds eight times as many human
beings.
Of course it is very hard to find
one's way around when one
doesn't always know where to

go. It isn't alwpvs good to have a
billion zillion nightclubs if your
orientation issue doesn't at least
include a guide to the good ones.
As usual, the Keystone Palo
Alto is the club most folks know
about. It's not the cheapest club,
or the biggest, or the friendliest,
or the one with the best sound
(Lord, no!). But it is close, and
that means a lot to a mostly
bicycle-bound audience justifi
ably uneasy about traversing the
wilds of San Mateo on a stray
Samtrans 7F or facing the Ten
derloin district without an easy
escape route.
But location doth not a night
club make, and the Keystone is
not a nightclub, so don't let any
one tell you differently. A night
club has entertainment, but also
gives you an atmosphere and a
chance to converse. The Keys
tone Palo Alto does not exactly
fail in these goals; rather,-it blat
antly refuses to attempt reaching
them.
Consequently , the selection of
bands is like that of a small con
cert arena — country bumpkins
one night, multigenarian blues/
jazz artists the next, rapid and
rabid lobotomy rock the next.
For the latter be especially
forewarned, for Palo Alto punk
rockers are a singularly ridicul
ous bunch. Despite the kids with
skinny ties borrowed from their
fathers and the lineups of family
Buicks outside the Keystone
dropping off Skip and Cindy for
Punk Nite Out, the dancing in
side can often resemble a cross
between leapfrog and Rollerball.
If you beware the hazards,
though, the Keystone is always a
good guess in the spontaneous
"let's go to a show" rallies com
mon in dorms around the end of
a quarter.
If, on the other hand, you
enjoy the hazards and want to go
out of your way to create them,
then the Mabuhay Gardens is
waiting for you with open safety
pins. Still thriving as a Polyne
sian restaurant by day/
polyester-punk cave by night,
the Fab Mab is ideal both for
those who want to feel individual
by dressing like thousands of
other fashionable punks in $300
leather jackets and for those who
understand the colossal joke tak
ing place seven nights a week.

That's entertainment.
Another standby is the Old
Waldorf, a living will and testa
ment to Big Brother Bill
Graham's ownership of Bay
Area entertainment. Where
other nightclubs have to struggle
to get moderately successful acts
to grace their dance pits, the
Waldorf somehow consistently
draws the largest names. Never
mind that you can't see because
the stage is too low, or that you
can't hear because the ceiling is
too low (nasty business for
acoustics) and the sound system
is God-awful, or that you can't

dance because the place is scan
dalously oversold. The best
guess is that Mr. G pays folks a
lot of bread to play this breadbox
— at least then there's some jus
tification for the prices (another
drawback). In other words the
Old Waldorf is not a fun place,
understand? But good luck in
finding a name act anywhere
else.
Rule number one of nightclub
choosery specifically prohibits
parties of the first part from fol
lowing only high fame quotient
stars. High fame quotient stars
usually end up in stadiums, with

high boredom quotient warm-up
acts — you must remember that
nightclubs depend on medium
small entertainers.
"Medium-small" generally
has to do only with album sales,
however, as does the "high fame
quotient" — the point is that you
ought not wait all year for your
favorite group. They'll sell out
anyway, if they play in a night
club, so what true clubbers ought
to do is experiment with their
ears.
And you should know in ad
vance that rule number two is
not for a great many people.

It requires that you admit the
existence of a flaw. Yet it is im
portant, and we should shed our
misconceptions eventually. So
remember this — despite the
popularity of component stereo
systems with multi-colored dials
and switches, most of humanity
is unable to tell a good sound
system from a dixie cup on a
string. It follows from that that
although sound systems vary in
nightclubs, to most people it
doesn't really matter.
Consider two examples. The
Great American Music Hall and
the Old Waldorf have acoustic
drawbacks, despite their shared
habit of featuring high-quality
acts. But did you ever hear any

one complain about it? At the
Old Waldorf — a favorite haunt
for Peter Tosh / Patti Smith /
Warren Zevon types — it is sur
prising how badly the music is
mixed. And Great America's
beautiful gold-leaf interior can
sometimes send a trumpet solo
into an ear in a disconcerting
moment. But both places simply
don't need perfect acoustics, be
cause there are very tew perfect
ears. Those so blessed can find
what they need at nearly every
jazz club. (Keystone Korner for
example. That's a jazz place, and
one of the best anywhere. Jazz
places are frequented by people
who demand near-perfect acous
tics — they have it because they
need it, but other places don't.)
So that's rule two, to be noted
especially by rock fans — it
doesn't make much difference if
the weak middle range of a sys
tem is matched by a blown-out
middle ear.
Next, it is absolutely essential
to know what kind of crowd you
like. There's a world of differ
ence between Mabuhay
Gardens-variety crowds and the
rest of mankind as we know it,
for example. You gots to know
which ilk you really enjoy or else
it could destroy an evening.
Rule three has to do with tic
ket prices, but that's usually in
the paper, so forget it.
And the differences in food
and drink prices begat rule
number four. And 10, the mul
titudes were told not to forget
that gasoline is sometimes re
quired when return is made to
Palo Alto, and they were told
that they would have to sleep in
an alley. And the multitude
adhered to the commandments
of the golden calf of tuition, and
called in advance to find out the
drink minimum.
Meanwhile, over at rule
number five, everybody got the
Final Clue. When you choose a
club, and like it, go back. Fre
quent the place that treated you
like you wanted to be treated.
The psychological difference be
tween an easy ID check and the
jerk who laughs and says you
don't look 13 can be considera
ble, and a place that has extra
dancing space might turn things
around. Never underestimate
the power of a pleasant atmos
phere, once you've made up your
mind as to your definition of
"pleasant."
