The Park, with
its curved roof, is
like a
reconditioned
aircraft hangar,
which makes it a
great place to see
high-tech
cinema.

There are enough
moviehouses within biking dis
tance of campus to enable you to
see a different movie every night
of the week, week after week.
(And I should know — I've done
just about that for the last four
years.) Our moviegoing experi
ence is invariably affected by the
conditions in which we view the
movie: how big is the screen? is

the sound system worth listening
to? do the people who work nt
the concession stand have body
odor? What follows is a review
not of movies but of the theaters
that show them.
As good a place to start as any
is right here on campus. Many
Stanford organizations sponsor
weekly film series. Admission
prices — usually $1 or $1.50 —
are virtually unbeatable. Cam
pus film series advertise via
flyers posted around campus and
advertisements in the Daily.
The ASSU Sunday Flicks,
which are scheduled — surprise!
— every Sunday night in Memo
rial Auditorium during the quar
ter. feature new or nearly new
releases. Memorial Auditorium
has a good sound system and a
fairly large screen. One disad
vantage to the Flicks (and to
other campus series) is that they
sometimes show, without giving
advance warning, 16 millimeter
prints of widescreen films — giv
ing the movie a crop job that, at
best, is ugly.
The Stanford Film Society's

Monday Night Movie Master
pieces screen in Kresge Au
ditorium. Kresge, which is in the
Law School Building, has com
fortable seats, a smallish screen,
and an acceptable sound system.
The movie masterpieces include
film classics from the last 80
years — this is a good place to
catch up i)n those movies you've
always heard about but have
never been able to see.
The French and Italian l-ilm
Series is scheduled for either
Tuesday or Wednesday night
during the quarter and screens in
Bishop Auditorium in the
Graduate School of Business.
The series schedules subtitled
foreign films which usually in
clude a good mix of better and
lesser-known films and direc
tors. The audience at this series
often laughs at jokes that haven't
been included in the subtitles,
which is sometimes a little in
timidating (or, if you like, irritat
ing) to those of us w ho are fluent
in neither French nor Italian.
Bishop auditorium is quite small,
the sound system is OK, and, un
less they've repaired it, the sc

reen has a nasty-looking gash in
it.
The Law School Film Series is
presented on Friday nights in
Kresge Auditorium. This is the
most eclectic of campus film
series, screening The Philadel
phia Story one week and Dirty
Harry meets the Kung Fa Killers
the next. The announcements
made prior to the movies — the
part where they tell you not to
cat or smoke and to come next
week — are almost always worth
the price of admission.
The Chaparral Saturday
Night Movies appear in Cubber
ley Auditorium, which is quite
possibly the worst place to see a
movie at Stanford. The screen is
small and dingy, and the sound
system has a self-censorship cir
cuit which allows only one out of
three words to reach your ears
intelligibly. This is unfortunate,
for the Chaparral series shows
current and not-so-current
movies that are usually more ad
venturesome and interesting (if
you forget about things like
Knute Roekne, All American,
which is nobody's idea of a good

joke) than the ones shown at the
Sunday Flicks.
Other film series on campus
may appear on a one-quarter
basis. Last year, for example, the
Great Directors Film Series,
sponsored by STARTS,
scheduled a Fassbinder film
series and an interesting series of
MGM. The Bechtel Interna
tional Center usually presents
the Third World Film Series on
Thursday evenings. Watch for
flyers around campus and read
the Daily's "Once Around the
Quad" section for information
about these programs.
Theaters in Palo Alto, Menlo
Park, and Mountain View are all
within biking distance of the
Stanford campus. Admission
prices hover in the three to four
dollar range, and many theaters
offer discounts for the first show
of the day or on one evening a
week.
Palo Alto has two repertory
movie houses which show good
movies from a range of eras,
styles, and languages. The New
Varsity Theater, on University
Avenue, might have been what
god was thinking about when he
invented movies. It has a huge
screen, a fine sound system, and
conscientious projectionists who
almost always manage to keep
most of the image in focus. The
concessions stand boasts pop
corn and ice cream, and the New
Varsity's espresso bar can get
you wired all night. Movies gen
erally screen for one or two even

ings before being replaced by
another double bill.
The Festival Cinema, one
block over from the Varsity on
Hamilton Avenue, is, at first
glance, a little less ostentatious.
It is a tiny theater, with a small
screen. But every week the Fes
tival puts together a double bill
that features the best older
movies you could hope to find.
The Festival's cat wanders up
and down the aisle during the
movies (in search of dropped
Junior Mints. I think). The con
cession stand can supply pop
corn, bagels, and apple juice, and
has the cheapest prices around
for your standard non-nutritive
foodstuffs.
The Aquarius Twin Theaters,
on Emerson, program first-run
Hollywood and foreign films.
Both theaters are shaped like
shoeboxes, the shoebox on the
left being a little larger than the
shoebox on the right I he theat
ers have a problem with sound
leaking through the wall they
share — it often happens that the
mood music from the Aquarius 1
mingles promiscuously with the
mood music from the Aquarius
2. The specialty of the house is
carrot cake, and Tuesday is a dis
count night for students.
The Bijou Theater, also on
Emerson, usually programs Hol
lywood product, although
foreign films have been known to
make an appearance here. The
Bijou might remind you of an
auditorium in an Appalachian

high school (never having been
in an Appalachian high school, I
can't be entirely certain). The
walls and ceiling are bare
plywood, the hnMae lighting is
agressively institutional, and the
seats, when you lean back in
them, let out a short sight of pain.
During slow parts in movies
these noises waft through the
theater like moans from the
spirit of the lower back
The Palo Alto Square Theat
ers, on El Camino, are newer,
very nice, and a little boring,
which describes many of the
movies which play there. The sc
reens are large (the left screen,
like the Aquarius', is bigger than
the one on the right: I think I see
a trend developing here), and the
sound system entirely adequate.
The shared wall is thick enough
to exclude all but the most vio
lent sound from leaking from
one theater into the other. The
concession stand is well-stocked
and conservative (very heavy on
Coca Cola and M&M's (but fea
tures frozen bon-bons, which
true devotees will claim are more
than enough to make up for the
Square's stale popcorn.
The Fine Arts Theater, on
California Avenue, often shows
pretty good movies. It often
shows these pretty good movies
for a very long time — La Cage
Aux holies. for example played
for over a year, and Autumn
Sonata saw some warm summer
