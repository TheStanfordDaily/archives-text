# Dominican Republic to enter new age of morality

Hector Perez Tovar, a member
of the transition team for Domin
ican Republic President-elect
Jorge Blanco, told the Daily dur
ing a recent visit here that a new
idea of morality will pre
dominate in the new adminis
tration, which is scheduled to as
sume power August 16.
Perez explained that Blanco
and his supporters will try to
eliminate corruption in adminis
trative spheres by passing new
laws to protect the state's assets.
"Officers will be severely pun
ished if they do anything close to

corruption," said Perez.
Yet, Perez denied that there
will be an anti-corruption probe.
"There will be no committee,"
he said.
The prospect of an anti-cor
ruption probe is a sensitive issue
in the Dominican Republic, as
there are rumors that former
President Antonio Guzman,
who died July 4 from a gunshot
wound to the head in what was
reported to be suicide, may have
been under pressure from sub
ordinates who feared they
would be targets of the probe.
Asked how the former admin
istration's idea of morality dif
fered from that of President
elect Blanco's, Perez stated that
Guzman "was a totally honest
and moral man. The wealth he
amassed was the result of his
own work. One can't term
Guzman's government corrupt,
but it is well known that he was
hurt by many of his close friends.

He felt they betrayed him; may
be this is the reason he did what
he did."
Guzman, a member of the
Partido Revolucionario Domini
cano (PRD) was the first presi
dent in the Dominican Re
public's 148-year history to an
nounce during his first term that
he would not seek re-election;
Blanco, also of the PRD, was
elected in the May 16 presiden
tial elections with 46.7 percent of
the vote.
Perez, who has worked for
Blanco since 1981, is presently
the assistant to the technical ov-

erall coordinator of the Transi
tion Commissions, as well as the
coordinator of the Appropriate
Technology Commission, and
assistant coordinator of the So
cial Welfare and the Organiza
tion of the State Commissions.
During his 30-day visit to the
United States at the invitation of
the U.S. government, Perez met
with officials and business lead
ers to discuss policy objectives
and measures that Blanco ex
pects will stimulate the small
Carribean nation's economy —
the setting up of free zones, agri
culturally oriented development
programs, technical assistance,
and methods to increase effi
ciency in government offices.
The current annual growth rate
is approximately 2.4 percent.
According to Perez, the new
administration's economic plan
to increase production (especial
ly of food) will undoubtedly be
affected by the Caribbean Basin

Initiative, the Reagan adminis
tration plan unveiled in April
which is intended to bring
Caribbean nations closer to the
United States.
"Overall, the initiative will be
important to the development
of our country. There is a move
ment in Washington, however,
to make the Congress more
aware of the needs of the Do
minican Republic and improve
the package without making ma
jor changes," he said.
"For example, we'd like to
have a better sugar quota. We're
hopeful that the Dominican Re
public will be given preferential
treatment." As recorded in 1980,
sugar and sugar byproducts ac
count for 34 percent of all Do
minican Republic export earn
ings, coffee and cacao 14 per
cent, and minerals 39 percent.
The United States provides the
market for more than 50 percent
of Dominican exports and is the
supplier of more than 44 percent
of Dominican imports.
Perez confirmed that accord
ing to the details of the Carri
bean Basin Initiative, Jamaica is
the only nation scheduled to re
ceive an increase in U.S. aid —
$112 million, up from $93 million
last year — while all other na
tions will suffer a five percent
cut.
"The United States has to have
reasons for this decision," said
Perez. "That'll be great for Ja
maica, but it would be worse if
ours (aid) was reduced.
"One of our objectives," he
explained, "is to stimulate for
eign investment in all sectors
that don't conflict with local in
vestment, such as manufac
turing, agro-industry, and tex
tiles. We hope to use labor very
intensively and our own raw ma
terials which have a high ag
gregate value."
Perez stated that the new gov
ernment would be interested in
opening more "free zones"
where foreign investors can in
vest without paying taxes. Ac
cording to a State Department
Public Affairs report, the Domin
ican Republic already has three
industrial free zones employing
over 12,000 people.
"We're also considering cer
tain amendments in laws gov

erning foreign investment and
specifically the repatriation of
profits. These investors can only
take out 18 percent, which is not
much of an incentive consider
ing the high interest rates in the
United States and the rest of the
world." The government also
hopes to restrict the import of
luxury goods, strengthen the
peso against the dollar in the
"parallel market" and launch a
house-building project to re
duce employment, according to
Latin America Regional Reports.
Land reform will also be an ob
jective of the new government,
although the reform would con
sist mainly of settling small land
holders on parcels of state land,
rather than breaking up large es
tates, Perez said.
"We expect to create between

8000 and 10,000 setttlements per
year." Yet, Perez was not certain
how many peasants this would
affect, but approximated that
one family of at least six would
be placed on each settlement.
"We are planning to give the
peasants ownership of the forest
and in this way, we can stop the
depredation of the forest which
has been a problem," he added.
"We plan to establish energy
farms to plant fast-growing trees
with high thermal power to be
used by peasants.
Perez received his Masters in
economics from Degli Studi de
Verona in Italy and along with
his governmental duties, teaches
economics and personnel man
agement at two local universities
in Santo Domingo, the capitol
city.

8000 and 10,000 setttlements per
year." Yet, Perez was not certain
how many peasants this would
affect, but approximated that
one family of at least six would
be placed on each settlement.
"We are planning to give the
peasants ownership of the forest
and in this way, we can stop the
depredation of the forest which
has been a problem," he added.
"We plan to establish energy
farms to plant fast-growing trees
with high thermal power to be
used by peasants.

Hector Perez Tovar, a member
of the transition team for Domin
ican Republic President-elect
Jorge Blanco, told the Daily dur
ing a recent visit here that a new
idea of morality will pre
dominate in the new adminis
tration, which is scheduled to as
sume power August 16.
Perez explained that Blanco
and his supporters will try to
eliminate corruption in adminis
trative spheres by passing new
laws to protect the state's assets.
"Officers will be severely pun
ished if they do anything close to

corruption," said Perez.
Yet, Perez denied that there
will be an anti-corruption probe.
"There will be no committee,"
he said.
The prospect of an anti-cor
ruption probe is a sensitive issue
in the Dominican Republic, as
there are rumors that former
President Antonio Guzman,
who died July 4 from a gunshot
wound to the head in what was
reported to be suicide, may have
been under pressure from sub
ordinates who feared they
would be targets of the probe.
Asked how the former admin
istration's idea of morality dif
fered from that of President
elect Blanco's, Perez stated that
Guzman "was a totally honest
and moral man. The wealth he
amassed was the result of his
own work. One can't term
Guzman's government corrupt,
but it is well known that he was
hurt by many of his close friends.

He felt they betrayed him; may
be this is the reason he did what
he did."
Guzman, a member of the
Partido Revolucionario Domini
cano (PRD) was the first presi
dent in the Dominican Re
public's 148-year history to an
nounce during his first term that
he would not seek re-election;
Blanco, also of the PRD, was
elected in the May 16 presiden
tial elections with 46.7 percent of
the vote.
Perez, who has worked for
Blanco since 1981, is presently
the assistant to the technical ov-

erall coordinator of the Transi
tion Commissions, as well as the
coordinator of the Appropriate
Technology Commission, and
assistant coordinator of the So
cial Welfare and the Organiza
tion of the State Commissions.
During his 30-day visit to the
United States at the invitation of
the U.S. government, Perez met
with officials and business lead
ers to discuss policy objectives
and measures that Blanco ex
pects will stimulate the small
Carribean nation's economy —
the setting up of free zones, agri
culturally oriented development
programs, technical assistance,
and methods to increase effi
ciency in government offices.
The current annual growth rate
is approximately 2.4 percent.
According to Perez, the new
administration's economic plan
to increase production (especial
ly of food) will undoubtedly be
affected by the Caribbean Basin

Initiative, the Reagan adminis
tration plan unveiled in April
which is intended to bring
Caribbean nations closer to the
United States.
"Overall, the initiative will be
important to the development
of our country. There is a move
ment in Washington, however,
to make the Congress more
aware of the needs of the Do
minican Republic and improve
the package without making ma
jor changes," he said.
"For example, we'd like to
have a better sugar quota. We're
hopeful that the Dominican Re
public will be given preferential
treatment." As recorded in 1980,
sugar and sugar byproducts ac
count for 34 percent of all Do
minican Republic export earn
ings, coffee and cacao 14 per
cent, and minerals 39 percent.
The United States provides the
market for more than 50 percent
of Dominican exports and is the
supplier of more than 44 percent
of Dominican imports.
Perez confirmed that accord
ing to the details of the Carri
bean Basin Initiative, Jamaica is
the only nation scheduled to re
ceive an increase in U.S. aid —
$112 million, up from $93 million
last year — while all other na
tions will suffer a five percent
cut.
"The United States has to have
reasons for this decision," said
Perez. "That'll be great for Ja
maica, but it would be worse if
ours (aid) was reduced.
"One of our objectives," he
explained, "is to stimulate for
eign investment in all sectors
that don't conflict with local in
vestment, such as manufac
turing, agro-industry, and tex
tiles. We hope to use labor very
intensively and our own raw ma
terials which have a high ag
gregate value."
Perez stated that the new gov
ernment would be interested in
opening more "free zones"
where foreign investors can in
vest without paying taxes. Ac
cording to a State Department
Public Affairs report, the Domin
ican Republic already has three
industrial free zones employing
over 12,000 people.
"We're also considering cer
tain amendments in laws gov

erning foreign investment and
specifically the repatriation of
profits. These investors can only
take out 18 percent, which is not
much of an incentive consider
ing the high interest rates in the
United States and the rest of the
world." The government also
hopes to restrict the import of
luxury goods, strengthen the
peso against the dollar in the
"parallel market" and launch a
house-building project to re
duce employment, according to
Latin America Regional Reports.
Land reform will also be an ob
jective of the new government,
although the reform would con
sist mainly of settling small land
holders on parcels of state land,
rather than breaking up large es
tates, Perez said.
"We expect to create between

8000 and 10,000 setttlements per
year." Yet, Perez was not certain
how many peasants this would
affect, but approximated that
one family of at least six would
be placed on each settlement.
