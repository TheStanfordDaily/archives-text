# DIVERSIONS
## Things that ought not to be missed... 
### 
The "Approaching Stanford"
handbook, older brothers, sisters,
friends, and RAs all exhort the in
coming freshman to go to the top
of Hoover tower, to tour the Line
ar Accelerator, check out the
Bookstore, attend a service at Me
morial Church — to do the staple
Stanford activities. But these pas

times soon become pedestrian to
the Stanford student. The campus
also offers many distinctive ex
periences, some real, some im
agined and talked about. In any
case, these ought not to be missed
during a student's tenure here.
Though both San Francisco
and San Jose can be seen from the

top of Hoover Tower, the vista
from the ridge near the"The
Dish" is equally breathtaking
and makes a sunrise or sunset
picnic in the foothills a must.
"Cowtipping" — pushing over
cows that are sleeping standing
up — is said to be another fa
vored foothill pastime, though
many say cowtipping stories are
tall tales of the "snipe hunt"
genre.
Should you find yourself un
able to take it all, sunbathing in
the top of Terman Engineering
Building offers an unusual vista
of the campus as well as a relax
ing study break. The stairs lead
right up to the roof, and the more
driven have even set up desks
there.
If you escape both the red
shirted Orientation volunteers
and your RA and are not bap
tised into the Stanford tradition
by a "fountain-hopping" run
during your first week at Stan
ford, dipping in fountains such as
"The Claw" in White Plaza or
"The Hoop" in front of Green
Library will cool you off during
the warm fall quarter or spring
quarter. Students have also been
known to dunk classmates in the
fountains during the winter.
Many talk of climbing the
walls around here. Some do.
Walk around the Quad on any
given sunny day and you are like
ly to see a fellow student/rock
climbing enthusiast clinging to
the cracks and crags of the sand
stone walls. Excellent practice for
climbing in the Sierra, some
mountaineers claim.
In the fall, Lake Lag is nothing
but a myth propagated by Uni
versity bulletins and public rela
tions brochures. By spring, how
ever, the crater has
metamorphosed into a lake . . .
perfect for a picnic breakfast on a
raft at sunrise. Lunchtime raft

picnics are also nice, but are often
interrupted by out-of-control be
ginners in the spring quarter
wind-surfing class.
If you need a release on a sun
ny day, a California hybrid —
frisbee golf — will kill an after
noon in no time. Just pick a
target and see how many tosses of
a frisbee it takes to hit the target.
Certain students have also been
seen swinging golf club at a whif
fle ball among the bike racks, but
this is for the particularly desper
ate.
Should your shoulders get sore
from frisbee golf, or hunching
over a study carrel for too long, a
jacuzzi in the "Faculty Ghetto"
will loosen up the muscles. Be
courteous — the facility is meant
for the residents of the complex.
A network of steam tunnels
lies under the University, and
though it is illegal, "spelunking"
in the steam tunnels has become
sort of a tradition with some
groups on campus. Legend has it
that one party of explorers even
ordered a Domino's pizza from a
steam tunnel under the Quad . . .
and it was delivered!
During the week before finals
— Dead Week — groups of stu
dents, usually dorm-mates,
gather every evening at midnight
to let the University know how
they feel . . . and let loose a
"Primal Scream" that echoes
eerily across the campus.
Another Dead Week ritual,
The Paper Ball and Airplane Ac
curacy Contest, was discon
tinued last year when glass win
dows were installed in the atrium
of Meyer Undergraduate Li
brary. But in the ante-window
days, a student would place a
small wastepaper basket about
20 feet in front of the loan desk,
throw the inaugural paper ball,
and a shower of paper would fall
from the balconies above.
