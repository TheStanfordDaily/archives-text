place. Ramona's serves

good hamburgers and subs

sock). The legendary salad
bar has gone downhill in
the last few years, but it's
still one of the best around.
The main attraction, of
course, is the pizza, which
is the area's second best;

and Ramona's is a lot
closer to campus than
FJ &L's. Plan on waiting
15-20 minutes. Open

toward veal, chicken, and
curries. Open daily,

5:30-10. N; local checks.

Sundance mine com
pany, 1921 El Camino
Real, Palo Alto (321-
6798) — If you have to go
to a steak and seafood
place, Sundance Mine is
the place to go. A lot of

Silicon Valley execs pat
ronize it, which is good and
bad, but gives you an idea
of the sort of place it is.
Prime rib, trout, steaks,
lobster, and crab — that
sort of thing. Good wine
list (try the Mirassou
Chardonnay), and the at
mosphere is a good com
promise betwen the too
ornate and the too-clean.
Open daily; Expensive —
BYP (depending on wine);
major credit cards; NC.
TOGO'S, 4131 El Camino
Way, Palo Alto (494-
8223) — Togo's makes
small, medium and large

sandwiches, all of which
are big. Ordering is done
cafeteria-style — you step

or so selections by
number, and two minutes
later you're handed your
sandwich. Most
sandwiches are combina
tions of various cheeses,
cold meats, onions, and
avocado. Togo's has no

ZOTS, Alpine Road, Por
tola Valley — Formerly
Rosotti's, hence the
nickname Zot's, the Al
pine Inn has long been a
favorite beer and burger
lover's haven, especially in
the spring when they can
be enjoyed outside on pic
nic tables in the beer gar
den. Zot's features an
array of pinball machines
and video games, a bar
frequented by regulars
often wearing Alpine Inn
t-shirts over their jeans
and work boots (it's not
wise to mess with these
folks — it's their turf) and,
rumour has it, just about
the best cheeseburger you
can get in the area, served
on a sourdough French
roll. They also offer salads,
a few other kinds of
