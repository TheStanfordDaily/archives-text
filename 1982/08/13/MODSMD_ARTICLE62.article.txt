Fox, Redwood City
Not a great movie, but often
quick enough, and witty enough,
and warped enough to make it far
more enjoyable than the other co
medies that were foisted upon us
last summer. Dudley Moore, in the
title role, plays an incredibly
wealthy alcoholic who falls in love
with a guttersnipe played by Liza
Minnelli, who spends her time
shoplifting and dreaming of being
an actress. The movie's real love
match, however, is between Moore
and John Gielgud, who plays
Arthur's aging valet and best
friend. Gielgud's so good that the
movie dies a little whenever he's of
fscreen.

entertaining and stunningly visual
3)the kind of movie nobody makes
anymore.
On second thought, it's de
liberately anesthetic. Except for
Alec Guinness the actors are not
unlike Barbie dolls or escapees
from episodes of Lassie; Lucas' de
cision to center the action around
members of the Pepsi generation
rankles and irks and peeves. True
2001 fans insist that for all of its vis
ual achievements Star Wars is real
ly very bland — even though I still
don't know what the hell was going
on in Kubrick's movie I am

E.T. — The Extraterrestrial
***★
Old Mill, Mountain View
E.T. begins where Steven
Spielberg's Close Encounters
peaked — with the descent of an al
ien craft — and gets better and bet
ter from there. It's an absolutely en
trancing movie — a miracle. This
tale of a benevolent, childlike al
ien's adventure on earth doesn't
contain a moment of cruelty
(though there is a great deal of sus
pense), and Spielberg's vision is so
overwhelming that he makes it dif
ficult to conceive of cruelty while
we are watching the film. The direc
tor uses filmmaker's magic to tap
into our feelings, and the result is a
movie of extraordinary emotional
power.
— Steve Vineberg

Annie Hall ★★★*
Fox, Redwood City; New Varsity,
Palo Alto
Woody Allen's great psycho-sex
ual comedy has no weak moments;
it's his most consistently appealing
film. Allen and his co-star, Diane
Keaton, are wonderful together.
W hen Keaton's around, Allen loses
some of his freakishness and is
transformed into a person who, if
still not entirely normal, is a very
special human being.
Keaton, too, is lent a special ra
diance: she sings "Seems Like Old
Times" in a thin, quavery, pretty
voice, and, as the camera caresses
her face, we sense how much Allen
adores her. A lovely movie.
Plays with Manhattan Friday,
Sept. 24, and Monday, Sept. 27, at
the Fox, and Friday-Sunday, Sept.
24-26, at the New Varsity.

Diva #***
Aquarius, Palo Alto
The high-tech chic of Diva.
directed by Jean-Jacques Beinix
and shot by Philippe Rousselot, is
dazzling. You can't complain that
Diva doesn't mean anything, be
cause Beinix's style and the weight
less shimmer of Hilton McCon
nico's interior designs declare it in
every frame. In Diva, style is con
tent.
Its story is so beautifully
farfetched that it acquires its own
logic. It revolves around the fixa
tion of Jules, a young mailman
(Frederic Andrei) for a black opera
singer (Wilhelmenia Wiggins
Fernandez). The singer never rec
ords, but Jules manages to record
one of her concerts. When that tape
becomes switched with a recording
of an expose by the mistress of a
vice-chief, the movie slips into its
own giddy self-consciousness.
— Steve Vineberg
Singin' in the Rain
Fox, Redwood City
Singin' in the Rain is the Hamlet
of musicals. It's a virtually perfect
movie. The script, by Betty Com
den and Adolph Green, is funny
and tight — it's also historically ac
curate in its telling of the troubles
that beset the movies when they
learned to talk. The music, by
Arthur Freed and Nacio Herb
Brown, is wonderful — the songs
include "You are My Lucky Star,"
"Broadway Rhythm," "Make 'Em
Laugh," "Moses Supposes" (a
great nonsense lyric which starts
out "Moses supposes his toeses are
roses but Moses supposes er
roneously"), and, of course, the ti
tle tune. And the performers are
splendid. Gene Kelly and Donald
O'Connor dance and sing a lot;
Debbie Revnold sings quite a bit
and dances a little; Cvd Charisse
just dances; and Jean Hagen plays
Lena Lamont, a screen star who
can't sing, can't dance, and can't
act. Lena Lamont's awful, and
Hagen's marvelous.
Plays next Wednesday, Sept. 29,
with My Man Godfrey.

E.T. — The Extraterrestrial
***★
Old Mill, Mountain View
E.T. begins where Steven
Spielberg's Close Encounters
peaked — with the descent of an al
ien craft — and gets better and bet
ter from there. It's an absolutely en
trancing movie — a miracle. This
tale of a benevolent, childlike al
ien's adventure on earth doesn't
contain a moment of cruelty
(though there is a great deal of sus
pense), and Spielberg's vision is so
overwhelming that he makes it dif
ficult to conceive of cruelty while
we are watching the film. The direc
tor uses filmmaker's magic to tap
into our feelings, and the result is a
movie of extraordinary emotional
power.

Annie Hall ★★★*
Fox, Redwood City; New Varsity,
Palo Alto
Woody Allen's great psycho-sex
ual comedy has no weak moments;
it's his most consistently appealing
film. Allen and his co-star, Diane
Keaton, are wonderful together.
W hen Keaton's around, Allen loses
some of his freakishness and is
transformed into a person who, if
still not entirely normal, is a very
special human being.
Keaton, too, is lent a special ra
diance: she sings "Seems Like Old
Times" in a thin, quavery, pretty
voice, and, as the camera caresses
her face, we sense how much Allen
adores her. A lovely movie.
Plays with Manhattan Friday,
Sept. 24, and Monday, Sept. 27, at
the Fox, and Friday-Sunday, Sept.
24-26, at the New Varsity.

Diva #***
Aquarius, Palo Alto
The high-tech chic of Diva.
directed by Jean-Jacques Beinix
and shot by Philippe Rousselot, is
dazzling. You can't complain that
Diva doesn't mean anything, be
cause Beinix's style and the weight
less shimmer of Hilton McCon
nico's interior designs declare it in
every frame. In Diva, style is con
tent.
Its story is so beautifully
farfetched that it acquires its own
logic. It revolves around the fixa
tion of Jules, a young mailman
(Frederic Andrei) for a black opera
singer (Wilhelmenia Wiggins
Fernandez). The singer never rec
ords, but Jules manages to record
one of her concerts. When that tape
becomes switched with a recording
of an expose by the mistress of a
vice-chief, the movie slips into its
own giddy self-consciousness.
— Steve Vineberg
Singin' in the Rain
Fox, Redwood City
Singin' in the Rain is the Hamlet
of musicals. It's a virtually perfect
movie. The script, by Betty Com
den and Adolph Green, is funny
and tight — it's also historically ac
curate in its telling of the troubles
that beset the movies when they
learned to talk. The music, by
Arthur Freed and Nacio Herb
Brown, is wonderful — the songs
include "You are My Lucky Star,"
"Broadway Rhythm," "Make 'Em
Laugh," "Moses Supposes" (a
great nonsense lyric which starts
out "Moses supposes his toeses are
roses but Moses supposes er
roneously"), and, of course, the ti
tle tune. And the performers are
splendid. Gene Kelly and Donald
O'Connor dance and sing a lot;
Debbie Revnold sings quite a bit
and dances a little; Cvd Charisse
just dances; and Jean Hagen plays
Lena Lamont, a screen star who
can't sing, can't dance, and can't
act. Lena Lamont's awful, and
Hagen's marvelous.
Plays next Wednesday, Sept. 29,
with My Man Godfrey.

Arthur
Fox, Redwood City
Not a great movie, but often
quick enough, and witty enough,
and warped enough to make it far
more enjoyable than the other co
medies that were foisted upon us
last summer. Dudley Moore, in the
title role, plays an incredibly
wealthy alcoholic who falls in love
with a guttersnipe played by Liza
Minnelli, who spends her time
shoplifting and dreaming of being
an actress. The movie's real love
match, however, is between Moore
and John Gielgud, who plays
Arthur's aging valet and best
friend. Gielgud's so good that the
movie dies a little whenever he's of
fscreen.
Plavs next Friday, Oct. 1, with
