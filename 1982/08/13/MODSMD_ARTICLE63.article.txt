Student bibliophiles (ev en bib
liomaniacs) are laced with an
unusual problem at Stanford.
Finding a good bookstore near
campus is no challenge: choosing
is the hard part. Between
California Avenue, in Palo Alto,
and Santa C'ru/ Avenue, in
Menlo Park, there are nearly 30
different stores which sell only,
or primarily, books; and a
number o! other establishments
— thrift shops, consignment
shops, outdoor stores, etc —
which keep books on hand. Any
attempt to cover them all would
be overwhelming; the following
account will onlv try to hit the
highlights.
The place to start, of course, is
on campus. The Stanford
Bookstore is both more than, and
less than, a good bookstore.
More, because hall ot its floor
space is given over to ollice, art
and engineering supplies, clo
thing. candy and cookies,
stationery, cards, and hundreds
ol useless items that say "Stan
lord." The Bookstore also stocks
textbooks (upstairs), cashes
checks (on Saturdavs), orders art

prints, and does a lot ol other
things most bookstores won't. It
is less than a good bookstore,
however, because it isn't a very
nice place to browse tor books. If
you're looking for something
specific, the selection is very
good in most areas (particularly

art history and literary criticism),
but the atmosphere in the front
of the store, where the books are
shelved, is such as to force you to
find the book you want quickly
and leave. The lighting is un
pleasant. and there is no seating
ol any kind; the rows of often

crowded check-out lines make
the store resemble nothing so
much as a supermarket It's j
good place to find a book (the>
will also order anything in print),
but it ranks low as a place tor
looking at books.
The campus is bracketed In
the area's two best "new book"
bookstores. To the southeast,
and slightly closer, is Printers
Inc. (310 California Ave.). Prin
ters Inc. is relatively new (it was
started by five former Kepler's
employees), and has quickly be
come the most popular place
around, largely on the strength
of its espresso bar and artsy
literary ambiance. Printers Inc.
calls itself "the literary
bookstore." and most nights the
store is full of professors of En
glish. local artist types, a few real
writers, and a lot of people try ing
hard to look like they belond.
This, to my mind, is one of the
store's drawbacks; the other is
lack of ventilation. Printers Inc.
is a hot place if you're more than
10 feet from the door. Atmos
pheric conditions aside, how
ever. Printers Inc. is a good store,
well-stocked in most areas (hard

and sottcover). and especially
strong in fiction and children's
books, with lots of chairs scat
tered around and nice carpeting
(a rarity). The store has occa
sional Wednesday night read
ings; in the last year local authors
such as John I Heureux (/)<'-
sires) and Janet Lewis (The Wife
ot Martin (iuerre) as well as na
tional figures like Susan Griffin
(Pornography and Silence) have
read there. East, and best, is the
niaga/ine selection. Scattered
around the front of the store are
hundreds of periodicals; they
carry everything from Arizona
Highways to /)/«• Zeit. and have
the area's best selection of scho
larly and literary journals.
Northwest of campus, along El
Camino Real in Menlo Park, lies
Kepler's Kepler's is a local
landmark, having been a focus
for "radical" activity in the '60s.
Phe store lias moved with the
times; its image is now composed
of equal parts of environmental
awareness, small-scale technol
ogy advocacy. and championship
of small and av ant-garde presses.
Bv the time this article appears,
Kepler's will probably have

mmcd to a new location (30 leet
from the old building) in a small
shopping mall. One hopes that
the Kepler's spirit survives the
move.
The main bragging point at
Kepler's, as far as books go. is its
claim to be the biggest paper
back bookstore around. The old
building made this point incon
testable. Most people didn't find
the whole store their first \isit;
eventually, on their second or
third trip, the) stumbled into the
back room and the other half of
the store's books. The store
didn't have the carpeting or
stained shelves of a Printer's
Inc.. but sheer si/e made it a nice
place to browse — there were
any number of nooks and cran
nies to lose yourself in. Adding
to the charm w ere a central room
with chairs and tables where no
one bothered you while you read
and a copier bearing a sign that
asked you not to break the spines
of the books you were xeroxing.
Kepler's has a magazine selec
tion second only to Printers Inc.
among local bookstores, and a
section devoted to small press
publications. Both stores are
open late. Printers Inc. until 1 1
p.m. every night and Kepler's
until 1 I p.m. weeknights and
midnight weekends.
Several other "new book"
stores deserve mention. There
are three very different stores in

downtown Palo Alto: Shirlev
Cobb ( 452 University Ave.),
Stacy's (21 l > University Ave.),
and Plowshare Community
Booksellers (1 <S2 University
Ave.) Shirley Cobb is the
epitome of the small-scale, per
sonalized bookstore. It stocks
only hardcover, and the selection
is aimed at affluent, educated,
suburbanites. This makes it a bit
expensive, but browsing is fun.
and it's a wonderful place to shop
for a gift. The selection is rather
idiosyncratic, perhaps reflecting
the staffs tastes, but the art.
photography, fiction, and nature
sections are excellent.
Stacey's began as strictly ;i
medical technical store, but has
expanded into most of the gen
eral areas. The technical areas
still seem to be the store's
strength (it has one of those
ludicrous fiction/literature splits
you usually see only in chain
stores), but the photography sec
tion is worth a look.
Plowshare was founded about
I 0 years ago by a group of Stan
ford graduates, and is very
community-oriented; it's the
place to go for news of environ
mental. anti-nuclear, or any
"counter-culture" sort of hap
penings. It is. at the same time,
an excellent small paperback
store, with a good fiction selec
tion and a children's alcove; the
