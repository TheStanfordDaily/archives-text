Student bibliophiles (ev en bib
liomaniacs) are laced with an
unusual problem at Stanford.
Finding a good bookstore near
campus is no challenge: choosing
is the hard part. Between
California Avenue, in Palo Alto,
and Santa C'ru/ Avenue, in
Menlo Park, there are nearly 30
different stores which sell only,
or primarily, books; and a
number o! other establishments
— thrift shops, consignment
shops, outdoor stores, etc —
which keep books on hand. Any
attempt to cover them all would
be overwhelming; the following
account will onlv try to hit the
highlights.
The place to start, of course, is
on campus. The Stanford
Bookstore is both more than, and
less than, a good bookstore.
More, because hall ot its floor
space is given over to ollice, art
and engineering supplies, clo
thing. candy and cookies,
stationery, cards, and hundreds
ol useless items that say "Stan
lord." The Bookstore also stocks
textbooks (upstairs), cashes
checks (on Saturdavs), orders art

prints, and does a lot ol other
things most bookstores won't. It
is less than a good bookstore,
however, because it isn't a very
nice place to browse tor books. If
you're looking for something
specific, the selection is very
good in most areas (particularly

art history and literary criticism),
but the atmosphere in the front
of the store, where the books are
shelved, is such as to force you to
find the book you want quickly
and leave. The lighting is un
pleasant. and there is no seating
ol any kind; the rows of often

crowded check-out lines make
the store resemble nothing so
much as a supermarket It's j
good place to find a book (the>
will also order anything in print),
but it ranks low as a place tor
looking at books.
The campus is bracketed In
the area's two best "new book"
bookstores. To the southeast,
and slightly closer, is Printers
Inc. (310 California Ave.). Prin
ters Inc. is relatively new (it was
started by five former Kepler's
employees), and has quickly be
come the most popular place
around, largely on the strength
of its espresso bar and artsy
literary ambiance. Printers Inc.
calls itself "the literary
bookstore." and most nights the
store is full of professors of En
glish. local artist types, a few real
writers, and a lot of people try ing
hard to look like they belond.
This, to my mind, is one of the
store's drawbacks; the other is
lack of ventilation. Printers Inc.
is a hot place if you're more than
10 feet from the door. Atmos
pheric conditions aside, how
ever. Printers Inc. is a good store,
well-stocked in most areas (hard

and sottcover). and especially
strong in fiction and children's
books, with lots of chairs scat
tered around and nice carpeting
(a rarity). The store has occa
sional Wednesday night read
ings; in the last year local authors
such as John I Heureux (/)<'-
sires) and Janet Lewis (The Wife
ot Martin (iuerre) as well as na
tional figures like Susan Griffin
(Pornography and Silence) have
read there. East, and best, is the
niaga/ine selection. Scattered
around the front of the store are
hundreds of periodicals; they
carry everything from Arizona
Highways to /)/«• Zeit. and have
the area's best selection of scho
larly and literary journals.
Northwest of campus, along El
Camino Real in Menlo Park, lies
Kepler's Kepler's is a local
landmark, having been a focus
for "radical" activity in the '60s.
Phe store lias moved with the
times; its image is now composed
of equal parts of environmental
awareness, small-scale technol
ogy advocacy. and championship
of small and av ant-garde presses.
Bv the time this article appears,
Kepler's will probably have

mmcd to a new location (30 leet
from the old building) in a small
shopping mall. One hopes that
the Kepler's spirit survives the
move.
The main bragging point at
Kepler's, as far as books go. is its
claim to be the biggest paper
back bookstore around. The old
building made this point incon
testable. Most people didn't find
the whole store their first \isit;
eventually, on their second or
third trip, the) stumbled into the
back room and the other half of
the store's books. The store
didn't have the carpeting or
stained shelves of a Printer's
Inc.. but sheer si/e made it a nice
place to browse — there were
any number of nooks and cran
nies to lose yourself in. Adding
to the charm w ere a central room
with chairs and tables where no
one bothered you while you read
and a copier bearing a sign that
asked you not to break the spines
of the books you were xeroxing.
Kepler's has a magazine selec
tion second only to Printers Inc.
among local bookstores, and a
section devoted to small press
publications. Both stores are
open late. Printers Inc. until 1 1
p.m. every night and Kepler's
until 1 I p.m. weeknights and
midnight weekends.
Several other "new book"
stores deserve mention. There
are three very different stores in

downtown Palo Alto: Shirlev
Cobb ( 452 University Ave.),
Stacy's (21 l > University Ave.),
and Plowshare Community
Booksellers (1 <S2 University
Ave.) Shirley Cobb is the
epitome of the small-scale, per
sonalized bookstore. It stocks
only hardcover, and the selection
is aimed at affluent, educated,
suburbanites. This makes it a bit
expensive, but browsing is fun.
and it's a wonderful place to shop
for a gift. The selection is rather
idiosyncratic, perhaps reflecting
the staffs tastes, but the art.
photography, fiction, and nature
sections are excellent.
Stacey's began as strictly ;i
medical technical store, but has
expanded into most of the gen
eral areas. The technical areas
still seem to be the store's
strength (it has one of those
ludicrous fiction/literature splits
you usually see only in chain
stores), but the photography sec
tion is worth a look.
Plowshare was founded about
I 0 years ago by a group of Stan
ford graduates, and is very
community-oriented; it's the
place to go for news of environ
mental. anti-nuclear, or any
"counter-culture" sort of hap
penings. It is. at the same time,
an excellent small paperback
store, with a good fiction selec
tion and a children's alcove; the


Chimaera Books, Menlo Park
back room is reserved tor the
sections 011 1 astern religions,
homesteading. etc.
Behind Macy s. in the Stan
ford ShoppingC enter, you'll find
Books Inc.. .1 hardcover
softcov cr store notable tor its
paperback mystery and science
fiction stocks and its remaindci
tables and shelves. In the Old
Mill Shopping ( enter, oft San
Antonio Road 111 Mountain

View. is I pstart Crow & C o.
Tins bookstore cafe has little 111
the way ot books, hut it vou ha\ e
to he in the Old Mill it's not .1 had
place to get a cup ot coffee.
I here are chain stores in the
area: one should shun them as .1
matter ot principle, hut occa
sionally a bargan can he found on
their bargain tables. Closest to
campus are B. Dalton's. in the
Stanford Shopping Center, and
\\ aldenbooks. on California
Ave.
A number ot stores cater to
particular needs. The most
common ot this type is the religi
ous bookstore. The One
Way Bookstore (320 California
Ave.) is Christian. I he \ngelus
(779 Santa Cm/ A\e., Menlo
Park) is general, and Fast-West
Bookshop (1171) El Camino.
Menlo Park) is about what the
name implies. The most interest
ing store of this type that I've
found is Minerva Books (1027
Alma. Palo Alto), a small hut
\ery attractive store with in
teresting selections in mythologv
and all religions and without the
self-conscious "mysticism" ot
other stores like itself.
A distant relative ot the religi
ous bookstores is the science fic
tion and fantasy bookstore.
Comics & C'omiv 111 downtown
Palo Alto (515 Cow per) has lots
of comic hooks. SI paperbacks,
posters, and magazines; its stock
runs toward sadistic porn, and
the clientele appears to he
mostly high-school age. Future
Fantasy (2033 El Camino. Palo
Alto) is smaller, hut more seri
ous.
All the backpacking stores
(Sierra Designs. Ski Hut. Nortli
Face) carry books related to
their specialties: hiking and
climbing guides, nature books,
camping directories. Two places
with more extensive stocks in
these areas are the Nature Com
pany (Stanford Shopping
Center), and the Peninsula Con
servation Center (2253 Park
Blvd.. behind the Co-op). The
Conservation Center also has a
library, a gift-shop, and a walk
through water-saving garden. A
few doors down from the Center,
at 2185 Park Blvd.. is Peninsula
Scientific, which carries hooks
along with its telescopes, micros
copes and freeze-dried bacteria.
Finally, here are three miscel
laneous special-interest stores.
The American Opinion

Bookstore (2f>56 Broadway.
Redwood City) is "the peninsu
la's onl\ conservative
bookstore." S/wede Slavic Books
(2233 El Camino. Palo Alto) is
self-explanatory. And the closest
adult bookstore to campus is the
H & K Bookstore (4163 El
Camino Way. Palo Alto, a block
from Togo's), w here you can also
watch movies for a quarter and
bu\ magazines in plastic bags for
512.50.
It you are interested in used
books, for economy's sake or col
lecting's sake. you will want to go
tn Berkeley as often as possible.
Having said that, 1 must admit
that there are a couple of stores
around here than nearly match
up. the differences being mainly
of size rather than quality.
l or collectors, the two most
important stores in this area are

Chimaera Books & Records and
Wessex I sed Books & Records.
VVcssex, located near the corner
of El Camino and Santa Cruz in
Menlo Park, is strictly a used
book store. The stock is mostly
hardcover, and the specialty is
modern fiction, within which
area the store is one of the best in
the Bay Area. Wessex is a small
store (two rooms),and outside of
fiction its selection is rather
skimpy. But there are enough
novels to keep you browsing for
hours, and the prices are very
reasonable, as first editions go.
Chimaera is another story en
tirely. The store takes up most of
the two-story house on the
corner of Kipling and Lytton, in
downtown Palo Alto, and it is
crammed with books, mostly
paperbacks. Chimaera is the
place to go for cheap copies of
good books, in almost any field,
and the browsing is great — the

staff ignores you, and the up
stairs rooms have overstuffed
chairs and couches to sit in.
Chimaera also caters to the col
lector, but in an over-priced and
rather over-bearing manner.
They put a small selection of
modern firsts out on the shelves,
and keep everything else of an
tiquarian interest locked in a
back room, to be seen on re
quest. Contrary to rumor, the
staff is not openly hostile; rather
than insulting your taste, they
usually gently humor you. Both
Wessex and Chimapra will take
books and records for trade or
cash, the general being 25 per
cent of the resale price in cash or
40 to 50 percent in trade. Be
careful what you take in, how
ever, as both stores are choosy.
There are four other used
bookstores in Palo Alto worth
mentioning, two for collectors

and two lor cheapskates. Bell's
Book Store (53f> I mason) is
more fun to look at than to
browse in — the shelves go up
the walls more than 20 feet. I he
staff prides itself on knowing
where everything is; unfortu
nately. most ot what you ask for
won't be there. Around the
corner, at 200 Hamilton, is Wil
liam P. Wreden. a true antikqua
rian store with dusty leather vol
umes in glass cases. Once again,
it's fun to look at. but there

probably won't be much you'd
want to buy. A couple doors
down from Wreden, at 230
Hamilton, is Recycle Books,
which sells lots of books which
were cheap to begin with even
cheaper. Finally, there's
Megabooks. at 444 University
Ave., with a good used paper
back selection at reasonable
prices.
After all this, there's still one

crucial issue left uniesolved:
where should you go to buy the
Sunday New York limes ' The
closest place, it you live on cam
pus. is The Store at Tresidder:
but The Store gets the paper late
and sells it out early. Better is
Printers Inc.. where you can read
the paper over a cup of French
Roast, assuming you find an
empty table. Best, however, is
Mac's Smoke Shop (534 Fmer
son). half a block from the Good
Earth Restaurant in downtown

Palo Alto. Mac's is the real thing,
with magazines and drugstore
paperbacks down one wall (start
ing with Barron's and ending
with Kaunch), and cigars down
the other, and old men telling
dirty jokes behind the counter.
The long, narrow store is open to
the sidewalk, and the newspap
ers are right in front; walking in
and buying a paper at Mac's is
tbe closest feefmgin-Pirlo AHo to
being in New York.
