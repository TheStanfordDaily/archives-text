# DIVERSIONS
## Campus Libraries 
### 
Most new students are so busy
their first week at Stanford,
meeting their roommates, going
to orientation activities, buying
books, and worrying about clas
ses, that they just never get
around to taking the twenty mi
nute guided tour of Meyer Un
dergraduate Library.
"Hey, 1 thought this was sup
posed to be about diversions"
you may have just said, "why
would they start encouraging me
to go to the library?"
Well, you may soon find that
the only time you find books
you'd like to read for pleasure is
when you're hunched over in a
corner trying to get a problem set
done or finish reserve reading.
Or you may find that you want to
get involved in an activity that
requires a little background in
formation. So think of this as fuel
for your diversions.
Students who have taken the
tour can vouch for the fact that a
lotgoes on and lives in Stanford's
libraries that most people never
know about.
The Meyer Library orienta
tion tours, which are offered
September 28 and 29 every
half-hour from 10:00 a.m. to
3:30 p.m.. September 30, Oc
tober 1, 2 and 5-9 al 1 LOO a.m.
and 3:00 p.m. (beginning in the
first floor lobby), are a good in
troduction to the libraries for
new students.
The eleven University lib
raries and six coordinate lib
raries here present students with
a vast store of information in
cluding manuscripts, maps,
sound recordings, periodicals,
microtexts, photographs, gov
ernment documents, and over
four and one-half million books.
About half of all library staf
fers here work at Green Library.
Green contains a general refer
ence service, the University
Archives, the current Periodicals
and Microtexts room, the Gov
ernment documents collection,
the Central Map collection. Spe
cial collections, and the main re
search collection of the Univer
sity libraries.
In Special collections, for in
stance, students can examine
such diverse materials as
Shakespeare's folios and the per
sonal correspondence of writers
like John Steinbeck.
Green also is one of the more
modern libraries here (the East
Wing was completed in 19N0)
and students must show their
student identification to gain
admittance to the library.
Inside Green Library there are
lockers, study carrells. countless
shelves of books, and incredibly
comfortable chairs. Since Green

has more space than all the other
libraries on campus, there is usu
ally a good chance of finding a
tree semi-isolated desk or chair
at which to do serious studying.
Meyer Undergraduate Lib
rary, affectionately known as
UCiLY, contains language
laboratories, audio visual ser
vices. a periodicals room, an
exam file (copies of mid-term
and linal exams for various clas
ses) lockers and carrels, and is
where one obtains any materials
placed on reserve for class read
ing Meyer also houses the
Learning Assistance Center.
Meyer has several Copicard
copying machines, electric and
manual typewriters and cal
culators. Because it houses the
reserve reading materials, Meyer
Library is not as quiet or un
crowded as (irecn The'observa
tion deck' arrangement of the
lobby and the third and fourth
floors lend themselves to scoping
and socializing, hence another
nickname of Meyer Library, 'the
zoo."
The Art and Architecture I .ib
rary, in the Nathan Cummings
Art Building contains books on
art and architectural history,
paintings, a special collection on
Chinese ait, sculpture and
graphic ait.
The Frederic M. Falconer
Biology Library, on the third

floor of Herrin Hall in the
Biological Sciences Center,
holds various materials in
botany, zoology ancl experimen
tal fields of biology.
The Swain Library of Chemis
try, in Room One of the Chemis
try building, has books on
chemistry, and materials about
chemical and petroleum indus
tries. The Cubberlv Library of
Education, on the second floor
of the Education building, offers
books, documents, periodicals,
pamphlets, microforms, disserta
tions and other materials on edu
cation.
The Branner Earth Sciences
Library, on the second floor of
the Mitchell Earth Sciences
building has materials in geol
ogy, geophysics, mineral en
gineering, and petroleum en
gineering, geological maps, U.S.
Geological Survey topographical
sheets, and a stunning mineral
collection. The only drawback
to this library is the seemingly
sub-zero temperatures in the
winter. Warm days outside,
however, make it a great place to
study when you are seeking air
conditioning.
I ik Lnginceiing Lihruiy. in
the l ei man Engineering build
ing, has books on engineering,
and the Guggenheim Space Sci

ences I.ibrary, containing collec
tions in aeronautics, and as
tronautics, radio science, and
electrical engineering.
The Mathematical and Com
puter Science Library, in Room
384 of the Quad, has books on
math, statistics, and computer
theory and application.
The Music Library, on the
second floor of the Knoll, con
tains the only catalog for scores
and recordings, and holds collec
tions for music teaching, re
search and performance.
The Physics Library, in Room
300 of the Varian building, has
the Hansen Microwave
Laboratory Library, which con
tains materials on microwave
physics and engineering, and the
Plasma Physics Institute.
The six coordinate libraries
offer detailed information on
their field of study, and though
intended for use by their specific
staffs, several are open to stu
dents. These libraries include the
Food Research Institute Library,
the Hoover Institution on War,
Revolution and Peace, the J.
Hugh Jackson Library of Busi
ness, the Lane Medical I.ibrary,
the School of I.aw Library, and
the Stanford Linear Accelerator
Center Library.

four and one-half million books.
About half of all library staf

the Central Map collection. Spe

In Special collections, for in
stance, students can examine
such diverse materials as
Shakespeare's folios and the per
sonal correspondence of writers
like John Steinbeck.
Green also is one of the more
modern libraries here (the East
Wing was completed in 19N0)
and students must show their
student identification to gain
admittance to the library.
Inside Green Library there are
lockers, study carrells. countless
shelves of books, and incredibly
comfortable chairs. Since Green

has more space than all the other
libraries on campus, there is usu
ally a good chance of finding a
tree semi-isolated desk or chair
at which to do serious studying.
Meyer Undergraduate Lib
rary, affectionately known as
UCiLY, contains language
laboratories, audio visual ser
vices. a periodicals room, an
exam file (copies of mid-term
and linal exams for various clas

where one obtains any materials
placed on reserve for class read
ing Meyer also houses the
Learning Assistance Center.
Meyer has several Copicard
copying machines, electric and
manual typewriters and cal
culators. Because it houses the
reserve reading materials, Meyer

crowded as (irecn The'observa

floors lend themselves to scoping
and socializing, hence another
nickname of Meyer Library, 'the
zoo."
The Art and Architecture I .ib

Art Building contains books on
art and architectural history,
paintings, a special collection on
Chinese ait, sculpture and
graphic ait.

sub-zero temperatures in the
winter. Warm days outside,
however, make it a great place to
study when you are seeking air
conditioning.

Most new students are so busy
their first week at Stanford,
meeting their roommates, going
to orientation activities, buying
books, and worrying about clas
ses, that they just never get
around to taking the twenty mi
nute guided tour of Meyer Un
dergraduate Library.
"Hey, 1 thought this was sup
posed to be about diversions"
you may have just said, "why
would they start encouraging me
to go to the library?"
Well, you may soon find that
the only time you find books
you'd like to read for pleasure is
when you're hunched over in a
corner trying to get a problem set
done or finish reserve reading.
Or you may find that you want to
get involved in an activity that
requires a little background in
formation. So think of this as fuel
for your diversions.
Students who have taken the
tour can vouch for the fact that a
lotgoes on and lives in Stanford's
libraries that most people never
know about.
The Meyer Library orienta
tion tours, which are offered
September 28 and 29 every
half-hour from 10:00 a.m. to
3:30 p.m.. September 30, Oc
tober 1, 2 and 5-9 al 1 LOO a.m.
and 3:00 p.m. (beginning in the
first floor lobby), are a good in
troduction to the libraries for
new students.
