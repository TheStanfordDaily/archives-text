BALLOONING
Location: Napa, CA; two hours
from Stanford
Cost: $95 per person for one
hour
By Heather Millar
Californians get into some pretty weird and
extravagant things. Of this genre, taking a
champagne flight over the Napa Valley at misty
dawn has to be the ultimate California ex
perience.
Balloon Aviation of Napa Valley flies cham
pagne balloon flights over the heart of the Napa
Valley seven days a week. Each flight is led by
an FAA certified pilot and two ground crew,
but guests are invited to help with the inflation
of the balloon. The balloon pilots can also make
an entry in a passenger's log book, if desired.
The flight itself takes about one hour and is
followed by a lavish champagne brunch.
Plenty of time remains for visitors to tour the
wineries of Napa Valley or the Calistoga hot
springs.
BERKELEY
Location: east 112 across the Bay;
about one hour from Stanford
Cost: Varies
By Jane Bailie
"There's no where like Berzerkeley!" stu
dents of the University of California at Berkeley
laughingly exclaim as they weave their way
down Telegraph Avenue, many of them seem
ingl\ oblivious to their surroundings, treating
each new human "obstacle" as something to be
ignored rather than accosted.
The city of Berkeley has been known to at
tract some of the more eccentric personalities of
the local area. The shops and streets are painted
with a certain amount of "human color," some
of it psychedelic.
The "Red Man" can been seen virtually any
day parading around the streets of Berkeley,
dressed completely from head to foot in a vi
brant shade of scarlet, carrying on his back a
stuffed puppet the size of a small child.
"Crazy William" is rumored to have been a
philosophy graduate student who "went over
the edge." He painted his clothes and face with
dollar-size red polka dots and now camps out
on Telegraph making faces at people and gener
ally drawing attention to himself. "You have to
be normal to stand out" many freshmen are
told, and despite the large student population,
many often find this the case.
The city carries with it an atmosphere which
is probably unique throughout the country.
"It's very much the 'Live and let live' philosphy
here." explained one woman resident. "With
this kind of community, there's got to be some
sort of laissez-faire."
Telegraph Avenue presents the viewer with a
variety of impressons. One is immediately
struck by the diversity not only of the architec
ture fronting the street, but of the people who
frequent the street itself. Ever since the I%o's,
when students and police often clashed in riots
>nd anti-war demonstrations Berkeley has ac
quired the reputation as a city w here the "hippy
radicals" of his bygone period have been able to
retain those qualities which have made such a
mark on the last two decades in American pop
culture.
Berkeley is often still considered a mecca for
political demonstrators and activists. Few
causes seem to go noticed. Supporters of ev
erything from the nuclear freeze to sailing
classes establish themselves in Sproul Plaza, a
focal point of the UC campus. During the late
morning and early afternoon, it is difficult to
cross this stretch of pavement without being
asked to sign any number of political petitons
or join a variety of activist groups.
Though ni'nn >112 •' ■ -h 'he area mav
students tend to p oe'uist; tactics" to
ward off the more adament of these represent
ative demonstrators. Clutching textbooks and

note pads, students can be seen with heads bent
and eyes focused firmly on the ground in front
of them as they quickly stride through crowd of
activists proffering petitions.
The majority of those persons often con
sidered "unusual" are in reality harmless, pro
vided they are not provoked. "Whatever you do
or see, avoid eye contact!" is the often repeated

line of advice given to those unfamiliar with the
area.
With its seemingly unending stream of street
vendors, whose merchandise ranges from Indi
an jewelry to tie-dyed clothing, the northern

section of Telegraph Avenue may give the ap
pearance of being a shopping mall rather than a
city street. Combined with the already static at
mosphere which seems to pervade much of the
area surrounding the UC Berkeley campus this
extremely heterogeneous mixture of humanity
can, to say the least, be overwhelming.
Berkeley is a place alive with a unique life
style and culture all its own, which can be stimu
lating ... if one takes it all with an open mind
and a sense of adventure.
WHALE WATCHING
Location: The coastal waters
from Baja California to the
Bering Sea
Cost: Varies depending on the
boat company and the length of
the trip, anywhere from $8 to
$35
•: t ,t j- rhe ''Vtst.il waters fro*n Baja
(. alifornia to the Bering Sea are filled *uh ceta
cean traffic as the Grey Whale make their an
cestral migration ... an event that spurs na

ture Tans to take to their boats to get an up-close
look at the great mammals who have made such
a phenomenal comeback.
In the last century, the Grey fell prey to the
Captain Ahabs of the Yankee whaling fleet.
The number of these animals fell from about
30,000 to near extinction. In 1895, they became
protected by law and have since rebounded to a

population close to 15.000.
After four months of feeding in the North Pa
cific. the herds migrate almost 6000 miles, led
by the pregnant females, to Scammon's Lagoon
in Baja, California. In the warm lagoons of

Baja, the fetnales calve and the calves stay with
the mother until the following.
Seeing a whale breach just yards away is a
breathtaking sight, but it's also possible that
you could go out for three hours and see noth
ing but seagulls.
Several boating companies regularly charter
trips to watch the whales: Marin Adventures, at
the College of Marin in Kentfield; the Oceanic
Society Whale Watch in San Francisco; and
Pillar Point Fishing Trips in Half Moon Bay.
If you have access to a boat, and want to go
out on your own, be aware that a federal law
posts a $10,000 fine if you come closer than 100
yards of a whale.
PARACHUTING
Location:Antioch, CA; about
two hours from Stanford
Cost: For groups of one to three
$85 each, larger groups as low
as $70 each
B> Heather Millar
1 placed my fool in the door. "Are you
ready?," he asked.
It was windy outside. A chill shot down my
spine. Could I finally find the courage to do it
this time? "I guess there's no way out," I re
plied.
"Nope," he replied. "The point is coming
up," and with a slap on the back, "GO!"
The rest of my body followed my foot out the
door into the emptiness below. Time seemed to
ripple and slow — nothing registered but the
disbelief that I had done it. I had jumped out the
door of an airplane! Three thousand feet of air
separated me and the ground.
Four seconds — was it minutes? — passed.
As the "static line" went taut, the parachute au
tomatically deployed with a gentle tug, billow
ing out into a light green jellyfish with tentacles,
or shroud lines, reaching down to my harness.
The view from 2500 feet spread the whole Bay
Area at my feet. The sun set into the fog,
silhouetting the live oaks on Mt. Diablo.
Never since have I felt more full of life ... or
more terrified.
The Antioch Parachute Center had done ev
erything possible to prepare me to react to any
situation that might arise on a first jump. Dur
ing Antioch's first jump course, which is akin
my vision of Marine boot camp, I had drilled: I
had gone through simulated jumps; I had
jumped off platforms; I had sweated; I had been
lectured to; I had practiced hopping out of an
aircraft on the ground.
When I strode out onto the tarmac outfitted
in a jump suit and parachute, I was sure, in
tellectually at least, that I was prepared for any
emergency. Emotionally, I felt like a sacrificial
lamb, trussed up for the cost of an first jump

course.
Walking back to the tarmac from my first
jump, it all seemed worth it. As Perry Stevens,
the center's owner, said in his lecture to my first
jump class, "Parachuting is the most fun you
can have with your clothes on!"
SKUNK TRAIN
Location: Central Terminal in
Fort Bragg, CA; four hours
from Stanford
Cost: $8.50 to $12.00 depend
ing on the route
By Heather Millar
Promontory point; great train robberies; the
Atchitson, Topeka and the Santa Fe — the 19th
century locomotive has captured the American
imagination. The Skunk Train line engines hark
back to the days when trains were trains,
robbers were robbers, redwoods stood tall and
the frontier was wild.
Originally a 40-mile long logging railroad
lugging great redwoods to Georgia-Pacific mills
in Fort Bragg, the Skunk line offered steam pas
senger service for about a decade until the self
powered Skunk trains were introduced in 1925.
The yellow one-car trains were named for their
original gas engines. As folks used to say, "You
can smell 'em before you see 'em."
In addition to the Skunks, which service
redwood communities inaccessable by road, the
line also runs two vintage logging "Super-
Skunk" locomotives complete with wood seats,

observation cars, and wizzcned conductors.
Rumbling through tunnels and over 31 tres
tles, the trains follow a lengthy stretch of the
Noyo river in course of their two round-trips
daily to Northspur, the half-way point in the
line. Passengers may stop at Northspur to await
the returning train and enjoy the cafe under the
redwoods. Or they may choose to spend a whole
day watching the redwoods between Fort Bragg
and Willits sweep past the open observation
car.
From Fort Bragg, the Skunk travels along
Pudding Creek, through the first tunnel and
along the Noyo. The trip to Northspur takes
about one hour.
From Willits, a 1700 climb into the rolling
hills immediately confronts the train. The track
descends from this summit down to apple
groves, wildflowers, cattle, and finally into the

deep forest groves surrounding Northspur.
Itineraries from Fort Bragg to Willits, Willits
to Fort Bragg, or from either end of the line to
Northspur and back can all be accomodated.
RIDGE VINEYARDS
Location: Saratoga, CA;about
one hour from Stanford
Cost: Free plus wine-tasting
By Heather Millar
Americans tend to idealize the farm with im
ages of "amber waves of grain." Yet only a
small percentage of the country's population
now lives in rural area. Few take part in the har
vest which appears miraculously on the nation's
supermarket shelves. But at Ridge Vineyards in
Saratoga, urban involvement in the harvest is a
tradition.
Ridge Vineyards, described by one owner as
a "big-small winery" with an output of about
30,000 cases a year, annually invites volunteers
.to Qorne help pick grapes.
Picking is a vefy, very special time," said
Sue Crane, one of Ridge's owners. "It's the
whole winemaking process in a capsule. It starts
with the grapes."
The volunteer grape-picking tradition started
more than twenty years ago when three SRI en
gineers, their families, and a bachelor bought
the acres on Montebello Ridge because, accord

ing to Crane, "it was a beautiful piece of land
and we wanted to make a small amount of wine
for ourselves." What used to be necessity has
become a tradition.
Ridge Vineyards has grown to become a well
respected winery with the distinction of elevat
ing Zinfandel to the level of a premium wine.
Although this growth has made it necessary to
hire a staff and bring in migrant workers to pick
grapes during the work week, Ridge still invites
volunteers to help on Saturdays during the pick-»
ing.
The day begins about 8 o'clock in the morn
ing, when grape knives are distributed and
pickers shown what to pick and what not to
pick. The amateurs pick from about 9 o'clock
until 1 o'clock and then convene to a picnic
lunch and a winetasting of older Ridge wines.
Only those over 21 can be served.
Wine has recently captured the American
taste, chardonnay replacing beer in popularity
and the wine cooler the martini. The word of
Ridge's tradition has now spread so wide that
although the picking used to open to all comers,
past volunteer pickers are now notified by a
"picking letter" and reservations must be made
in advance (phone 408-867-3233).
Picking starts "when the grapes are ready,"
usually in late September or in October and
goes on for about three weeks, says Crane.
Since that period spans only three Saturdays,
available spaces fill quickly. Between 200 and
300 people show up every harvest Saturday and
in the last few years Ridge has had to keep a
waiting list.
"We teach people how to pick; it's gotten
pretty formal" Crane said, remembering the
days when all the families would go out to har
vest and crush the grapes. "Sometimes I think
we should just bring in field workers and get the
whole thing overwith, but then I realize that this
is the thing relationships are made of..
