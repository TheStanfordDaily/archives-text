BALLOONING
Location: Napa, CA; two hours
from Stanford
Cost: $95 per person for one
hour
By Heather Millar
Californians get into some pretty weird and
extravagant things. Of this genre, taking a
champagne flight over the Napa Valley at misty
dawn has to be the ultimate California ex
perience.
Balloon Aviation of Napa Valley flies cham
pagne balloon flights over the heart of the Napa
Valley seven days a week. Each flight is led by
an FAA certified pilot and two ground crew,
but guests are invited to help with the inflation
of the balloon. The balloon pilots can also make
an entry in a passenger's log book, if desired.
The flight itself takes about one hour and is
followed by a lavish champagne brunch.
Plenty of time remains for visitors to tour the
wineries of Napa Valley or the Calistoga hot
springs.
BERKELEY
Location: east 112 across the Bay;
about one hour from Stanford
Cost: Varies
By Jane Bailie
"There's no where like Berzerkeley!" stu
dents of the University of California at Berkeley
laughingly exclaim as they weave their way
down Telegraph Avenue, many of them seem
ingl\ oblivious to their surroundings, treating
each new human "obstacle" as something to be
ignored rather than accosted.
The city of Berkeley has been known to at
tract some of the more eccentric personalities of
the local area. The shops and streets are painted
with a certain amount of "human color," some
of it psychedelic.
The "Red Man" can been seen virtually any
day parading around the streets of Berkeley,
dressed completely from head to foot in a vi
brant shade of scarlet, carrying on his back a
stuffed puppet the size of a small child.
"Crazy William" is rumored to have been a
philosophy graduate student who "went over
the edge." He painted his clothes and face with
dollar-size red polka dots and now camps out
on Telegraph making faces at people and gener
ally drawing attention to himself. "You have to
be normal to stand out" many freshmen are
told, and despite the large student population,
many often find this the case.
The city carries with it an atmosphere which
is probably unique throughout the country.
"It's very much the 'Live and let live' philosphy
here." explained one woman resident. "With
this kind of community, there's got to be some
sort of laissez-faire."
Telegraph Avenue presents the viewer with a
variety of impressons. One is immediately
struck by the diversity not only of the architec
ture fronting the street, but of the people who
frequent the street itself. Ever since the I%o's,
when students and police often clashed in riots
>nd anti-war demonstrations Berkeley has ac
quired the reputation as a city w here the "hippy
radicals" of his bygone period have been able to
retain those qualities which have made such a
mark on the last two decades in American pop
culture.
Berkeley is often still considered a mecca for
political demonstrators and activists. Few
causes seem to go noticed. Supporters of ev
erything from the nuclear freeze to sailing
classes establish themselves in Sproul Plaza, a
focal point of the UC campus. During the late
morning and early afternoon, it is difficult to
cross this stretch of pavement without being
asked to sign any number of political petitons
or join a variety of activist groups.
Though ni'nn >112 •' ■ -h 'he area mav
students tend to p oe'uist; tactics" to
ward off the more adament of these represent
ative demonstrators. Clutching textbooks and

note pads, students can be seen with heads bent
and eyes focused firmly on the ground in front
of them as they quickly stride through crowd of
activists proffering petitions.
The majority of those persons often con
sidered "unusual" are in reality harmless, pro
vided they are not provoked. "Whatever you do
or see, avoid eye contact!" is the often repeated

line of advice given to those unfamiliar with the
area.
With its seemingly unending stream of street
vendors, whose merchandise ranges from Indi
an jewelry to tie-dyed clothing, the northern

section of Telegraph Avenue may give the ap
pearance of being a shopping mall rather than a
city street. Combined with the already static at
mosphere which seems to pervade much of the
area surrounding the UC Berkeley campus this
extremely heterogeneous mixture of humanity
can, to say the least, be overwhelming.
Berkeley is a place alive with a unique life
style and culture all its own, which can be stimu
lating ... if one takes it all with an open mind
and a sense of adventure.
WHALE WATCHING
Location: The coastal waters
from Baja California to the
Bering Sea
Cost: Varies depending on the
boat company and the length of
the trip, anywhere from $8 to
$35
•: t ,t j- rhe ''Vtst.il waters fro*n Baja
(. alifornia to the Bering Sea are filled *uh ceta
cean traffic as the Grey Whale make their an
cestral migration ... an event that spurs na

ture Tans to take to their boats to get an up-close
look at the great mammals who have made such
a phenomenal comeback.
In the last century, the Grey fell prey to the
Captain Ahabs of the Yankee whaling fleet.
The number of these animals fell from about
30,000 to near extinction. In 1895, they became
protected by law and have since rebounded to a

population close to 15.000.
After four months of feeding in the North Pa
cific. the herds migrate almost 6000 miles, led
by the pregnant females, to Scammon's Lagoon
in Baja, California. In the warm lagoons of

Baja, the fetnales calve and the calves stay with
the mother until the following.
Seeing a whale breach just yards away is a
breathtaking sight, but it's also possible that
you could go out for three hours and see noth
ing but seagulls.
Several boating companies regularly charter
trips to watch the whales: Marin Adventures, at
the College of Marin in Kentfield; the Oceanic
Society Whale Watch in San Francisco; and
Pillar Point Fishing Trips in Half Moon Bay.
If you have access to a boat, and want to go
out on your own, be aware that a federal law
posts a $10,000 fine if you come closer than 100
yards of a whale.
PARACHUTING
Location:Antioch, CA; about
two hours from Stanford
Cost: For groups of one to three
$85 each, larger groups as low
as $70 each
B> Heather Millar
1 placed my fool in the door. "Are you
ready?," he asked.
It was windy outside. A chill shot down my
spine. Could I finally find the courage to do it
this time? "I guess there's no way out," I re
plied.
"Nope," he replied. "The point is coming
up," and with a slap on the back, "GO!"
The rest of my body followed my foot out the
door into the emptiness below. Time seemed to
ripple and slow — nothing registered but the
disbelief that I had done it. I had jumped out the
door of an airplane! Three thousand feet of air
separated me and the ground.
Four seconds — was it minutes? — passed.
As the "static line" went taut, the parachute au
tomatically deployed with a gentle tug, billow
ing out into a light green jellyfish with tentacles,
or shroud lines, reaching down to my harness.
The view from 2500 feet spread the whole Bay
Area at my feet. The sun set into the fog,
silhouetting the live oaks on Mt. Diablo.
Never since have I felt more full of life ... or
more terrified.
The Antioch Parachute Center had done ev
erything possible to prepare me to react to any
situation that might arise on a first jump. Dur
ing Antioch's first jump course, which is akin
my vision of Marine boot camp, I had drilled: I
had gone through simulated jumps; I had
jumped off platforms; I had sweated; I had been
lectured to; I had practiced hopping out of an
aircraft on the ground.
When I strode out onto the tarmac outfitted
in a jump suit and parachute, I was sure, in
tellectually at least, that I was prepared for any
emergency. Emotionally, I felt like a sacrificial
lamb, trussed up for the cost of an first jump

course.
Walking back to the tarmac from my first
jump, it all seemed worth it. As Perry Stevens,
the center's owner, said in his lecture to my first
jump class, "Parachuting is the most fun you
can have with your clothes on!"
SKUNK TRAIN
Location: Central Terminal in
Fort Bragg, CA; four hours
from Stanford
Cost: $8.50 to $12.00 depend
ing on the route
By Heather Millar
Promontory point; great train robberies; the
Atchitson, Topeka and the Santa Fe — the 19th
century locomotive has captured the American
imagination. The Skunk Train line engines hark
back to the days when trains were trains,
robbers were robbers, redwoods stood tall and
the frontier was wild.
Originally a 40-mile long logging railroad
lugging great redwoods to Georgia-Pacific mills
in Fort Bragg, the Skunk line offered steam pas
senger service for about a decade until the self
powered Skunk trains were introduced in 1925.
The yellow one-car trains were named for their
original gas engines. As folks used to say, "You
can smell 'em before you see 'em."
In addition to the Skunks, which service
redwood communities inaccessable by road, the
line also runs two vintage logging "Super-
Skunk" locomotives complete with wood seats,

observation cars, and wizzcned conductors.
Rumbling through tunnels and over 31 tres
tles, the trains follow a lengthy stretch of the
Noyo river in course of their two round-trips
daily to Northspur, the half-way point in the
line. Passengers may stop at Northspur to await
the returning train and enjoy the cafe under the
redwoods. Or they may choose to spend a whole
day watching the redwoods between Fort Bragg
and Willits sweep past the open observation
car.
From Fort Bragg, the Skunk travels along
Pudding Creek, through the first tunnel and
along the Noyo. The trip to Northspur takes
about one hour.
From Willits, a 1700 climb into the rolling
hills immediately confronts the train. The track
descends from this summit down to apple
groves, wildflowers, cattle, and finally into the

deep forest groves surrounding Northspur.
Itineraries from Fort Bragg to Willits, Willits
to Fort Bragg, or from either end of the line to
Northspur and back can all be accomodated.
RIDGE VINEYARDS
Location: Saratoga, CA;about
one hour from Stanford
Cost: Free plus wine-tasting
By Heather Millar
Americans tend to idealize the farm with im
ages of "amber waves of grain." Yet only a
small percentage of the country's population
now lives in rural area. Few take part in the har
vest which appears miraculously on the nation's
supermarket shelves. But at Ridge Vineyards in
Saratoga, urban involvement in the harvest is a
tradition.
Ridge Vineyards, described by one owner as
a "big-small winery" with an output of about
30,000 cases a year, annually invites volunteers
.to Qorne help pick grapes.
Picking is a vefy, very special time," said
Sue Crane, one of Ridge's owners. "It's the
whole winemaking process in a capsule. It starts
with the grapes."
The volunteer grape-picking tradition started
more than twenty years ago when three SRI en
gineers, their families, and a bachelor bought
the acres on Montebello Ridge because, accord

ing to Crane, "it was a beautiful piece of land
and we wanted to make a small amount of wine
for ourselves." What used to be necessity has
become a tradition.
Ridge Vineyards has grown to become a well
respected winery with the distinction of elevat
ing Zinfandel to the level of a premium wine.
Although this growth has made it necessary to
hire a staff and bring in migrant workers to pick
grapes during the work week, Ridge still invites
volunteers to help on Saturdays during the pick-»
ing.
The day begins about 8 o'clock in the morn
ing, when grape knives are distributed and
pickers shown what to pick and what not to
pick. The amateurs pick from about 9 o'clock
until 1 o'clock and then convene to a picnic
lunch and a winetasting of older Ridge wines.
Only those over 21 can be served.
Wine has recently captured the American
taste, chardonnay replacing beer in popularity
and the wine cooler the martini. The word of
Ridge's tradition has now spread so wide that
although the picking used to open to all comers,
past volunteer pickers are now notified by a
"picking letter" and reservations must be made
in advance (phone 408-867-3233).
Picking starts "when the grapes are ready,"
usually in late September or in October and
goes on for about three weeks, says Crane.
Since that period spans only three Saturdays,
available spaces fill quickly. Between 200 and
300 people show up every harvest Saturday and
in the last few years Ridge has had to keep a
waiting list.
"We teach people how to pick; it's gotten
pretty formal" Crane said, remembering the
days when all the families would go out to har
vest and crush the grapes. "Sometimes I think
we should just bring in field workers and get the
whole thing overwith, but then I realize that this
is the thing relationships are made of..

SAN SIMEON
Location: San Simeon, CA,
about four hours from Stanford
Cost: $7 per tour

Imagine living in a castle with 38 bedrooms,
31 bathrooms, a movie theater, a refectory (din
ing hall) and two immense swimming pools.
Named La Cuesta Fncantada, The Enchanted
Hill, just such an estate sprawls over 123 acres
near the little town of San Simeon. Opulently
set against the Santa Lucia Mountains on a
coastal knoll overlooking the sea, the 137-foot
high mansion is surrounded by gardens, ter
races, pools and palatial guest houses.
Before 1958, the fabled mansion was ac
cessible only to friends and guests of William
Randolph Hearst, publishing magnate and
owner of the San Francisco Chronicle. Begun in
1922 to be the permanent residence of the
Hearst family, the castle was still unfinished at
the time of Hearst's death in 1951. It remains
uncompleted although this is hard to believe
when confronted with the profusion of statuary
and paintings that adorn the rooms of the four
mansions that make up the complex.
Seven years after Hearst's death, the Hearst
Corporation presented the castle to the state of
California with the understanding that it be pre
served as a memorial to Hearst and his mother.
Four different tours of the San Simeon estate
are available. Each two-hour tour covers a dif
ferent portion of the castle. More than one tour
may be taken in one day.
Tours are $8 each for adults and $4 for chil
dren. No student discounts are offered.
Advance reservations may be made through
Ticketron at 393-6914. For more specific in
formation, call the Hearst Castle at
(805)927-4621.
To drive to the castle, take Highway 1 (205
miles from San Francisco) or Highway 101 (245
miles from San Francisco) south. Although
Highway 1 is a scenic route which might take
about five hours, it is worth the detour along
tortuous roads to pass Carmel, Monterey, and
Big Sur.
Estimated driving time from Monterey to
San Simeon is three hours.

MOUNTAIN PLAY
Location: Top of Mount
Tamalpais, Marin County,
CA; about an hour and a half
drive from Stanford, shuttle
buses depart from Mill Valley
Cost: '83 prices not yet set 112 '82
prices $3 to $6.50

Marin County residents have a reputation for
doing things that are a little iconoclastic, a little
mellow and sinfully enjoyable. Of these, the
Mountain Play is one.
The site used for the plays descends with an
upper slope of Mount Tamalpais and curves
into a Greek style amphitheater. History buffs
claim that the site was once the scene of Indian
religious rites, because the shape of the site is
either a freak of nature or a work of man.
From the upper reaches of the outdoor theater a
hint of the San Francisco skyline can be seen
over the redwoods. Grass lines each level or row
of "seats;" and wildflowers poke through the
cracks. Each May, spectators spread blankets
on the grass for a different play.
The Mountain Play is one of the traditional
events in Marin County. It was first held in 1913
on land that then belonged to William Kent
when Kent owned most of the land on Mount
Tarn. When Kent died in 1928, he left the
Mountain Theater to the Mountain Play As
sociation which later had the stone levels in
stalled by the Civilian Conservation Corps.
HANDEL SING
Location: Louise M. Davies
Symphony Hall, San Francis
co, CA
Cost: not yet determined

For infusing good old Yuletide cheer, the An
nual Sing-lt-Yourself-Messiah sponsored by
the San Francisco Conservatory of Music,
would be hard to beat.
Conducting sing-alongs of the massive musi
cal work which Handel scrawled in only 24 days
is not an original idea. Groups throughout Eng

land have been gathering for years to sing this
composer's most popular choral work. But the
Conservatory of Music has created a unique
tradition by televising the event live from Lou
ise M. Davies Symphony Hall.
The over 3000 tickets available each year sell
out about as fast as you can say "Deck the Halls
with Boughs of Holly." Two hours after tickets
went on sale in 1980, they were gone. The event
is beginning to attract a cult following of Bay
Area choral enthusiasts such as the Con
servatory Singers and the San Francisco Gay
Men's Chorus. But everyone, regardless of vo
cal persuasion, is welcomed and expected to
join in.
Companies such as the Emporium and the
Transamerica Corporation usually contribute
to cost of renting the hall, and the ticket sales
have raised over $20,000 for the San Francisco
Conservatory Scholarship Fund in past years.
It has been said, but not verified, that the San
Francisco sing is the largest rendition of the
Handel hit — sending the famous chorus of
"Hallelujah!" booming out of Davies and echo
ing across the San Francisco Civic Center. Last
year the exultation grew so powerful that 14

Christmas trees on the stage shook.
The chorus is accompanied by the San Fran
cisco Conservatory Orchestra and is conducted
by Louis Magor, director of the San Francisco
Symphony Chorus.
Hallelujah!
MUD BATHS
Location: Calistoga, CA;
about two hours from Stanford
Cost: Varies with treatment, up
to $31

Hot, mucky mud may not conjure up dec
adent luxury. But mudbaths are popular among
students — and they are available three hours
away in the Napa Valley town of Calistoga.
So if hot tubs and saunas have become old
hat, try mudbaths. Calistoga isone of only a few
mudbath capitals in the world, housing four
mudbath centers. Dr. Wilkinson's, the most
well-known and posh mudbath center, offers a
full treatment for $31. The mudbath center has
been shown on several television feature pro
grams, including Evening Magazine on San
Francisco's Channel 5
The mud in Calistoga — and in a few places
back east and in the desert — is special because
it is mixed with mineral water from local hot
springs. The fine-grained mud, like lava, is
black and somewhat gritty. It smells vaguely
sulfurous because of its mineral content.
Allegedly, the baths have a unique ability to
eliminate toxins from the human system. The
relaxing hot mud process cleanses the body by

opening pores, providing a drawing action that
saunas and hot tubs do not.
Mudbather Dave Bassett described the proc
ess as "a very gradual warming of the body."
Graduate Karen Halbo, another mudbather,
said, "It's like being in very warm water, but
you feel it more. . .you're supported."
The mud goes up to the shoulders, enabling
bathers to sip water through a straw.
A full treatment includes a mud bath, an indi
vidual mineral water whirlpool tub, a steamroll
and blanket rub, and a half-hour full body
massage. The entire process takes about two
hours and 15 minutes. "It's fun, it's great, it's
good for your health, it's competelv relaxing."
said one mudbather.
"It's a great way to go pamper yourself," said
Halbo.
Although the weather and the world's vaca
tion schedule have made March to October the
official mudbath season. Dr. Wilkinson's is
open every day of the year (except Christmas
and New Year's Day).
GOLD PANNING
Location: the Mother Lode in
the foothills of the Sierra Ne
vada, an average of four hours
away from Stanford
Cost: varies with area and pro
gram from $5 to over $50

I remember panning gold for the first time:
I squatted about knee deep in a stream running
out of the Sierra foothills, letting silt and sand

swirl through, and out of, my gold pan ... a
glint, a small nuggget, a glint, a flake. What I
gleaned from the stream that day was hardly
enough to buy a carton of milk, hut the thrill of
the glint-a-nugget-glint-a-flake process out
weighed the scantiness of my find.
No one organized park or facility exists for
those wanting to relive the days of the '49ers.
Perhaps it is this lack of organization that
makes panning gold in the Mother Lode so en
joyable. It leaves some of the adventure in the
bargain. Any stretch of stream or river is open
game, provided it is not already claimed.
Often the existence of a claim is hard to de
termine. especially on well-worked streams
such as the American River. Caution is war
ranted if you're out exploring on your own.
Prospectors are very possessive of their
claims. If you're set on exploring on your own,
the best approach is to look up the local sport
ing goods store in town — most of them also
carry prospecting equipment — and ask for ad
vice. The store owner probably has a claim of
his own and would be glad to help out.
Of course, most campgrounds in the Sierra
foothills rent gold panning equipment and les
sons. There are organized gold-seeking river
raft trips. Some prospectors rent out their
claims. Others make a business oTletting people
come up to their claim and watch a gold dredge
in action and perhaps pan a little.
The most important thing to remember
about prospecting for a weekend is that the
search is the challenge. You'll probably find
some gold, a glint, but it won't rival the dis
covery at Sutter's Mill in 1840's which got this
whole business started. You'll be lucky to get a
carton of milk out of the deal.

SOL VANG
Location: Solvang, CA; 45
miles north of Santa Barbara
Cost: Varies

Set against the blue Southern California sky
of the Santa Ynez Valley 45 miles north of San
ta Barbara, the thatched roofs of Solvang recre
ate a page out of Hans Christian Anderson.
Though far from being exclusively Danish,
Solvang is laid out like a 19th century Danish
village. Windmills turn lazily in the bree/.e.
Plaster and timber houses with gables and

steeply pitched roofs and Copenhagen gas
lights line the streets. Storks guard the chim
neys Aromas from the town's famous bakeries
which produce breads and pastries from cen
tury-old recipes filter into where visitors and
residents — many of them speaking Danish —
stroll.
Three Danish-horn educators and clergymen
founded Solvang seventy years ago, intending
to use the town as a site for a folk school pat
terned after the Danish College of Grand View
in Des Moines. Atterdag College opened its
doors to students in 1914.
The early settlers were almost exclusively
D;inish-born or of Danish extraction and fol
lowed such trades as farming and carpentry.
Solvang soon became the economic center of
the Santa Yne/ Valley and native Americans
began to settle there. But the Scandinavian trad
ition has been reinforced by a steady influx of
first-generation Danes. Danish is taught in the
schools and most families attend the Danish ru
ral-styled Bethania Lutheran Church.
The annual "Danish Days" festival, usually
held the third weekend in September, accents
the town's heritage. Groups of traditional
singers and dancers rove the streets; and the Vil
lage Band plays atop the Carlsberg beer wagon.
Villagers dressed in Danish costumes, serve an
aebleskiver breakfast on the streets.
During the summer, a company of 200, the
Solvang Theatrefest, performs seven open-air
productions in rotating repertory. Construc
tion of an indoor theatre will be finished some
time this year, and plays will then be offered
year-round.
Other notable Solvang festivals include the
July 4th and Christmas parades.
CALA VERAS JUMP
ING FROG JUBILEE
Location: Angel's Camp,
Calaveras County in the Moth
er Lode; CA about three hours
from Stanford
Cost: travel, $3 entry fee for
your frog, $5-$6 admission to
the Fair
Samuel Clemens has been blamed for the
whole craziness held annually during the third
week of May: the Cala'eras Jumping Frog
Jubilee.
After a trip to the Mother Lode in the days
when '49ers kept the area a wild country,
Clemens heard a tale of a man named Jim
Smiley, a jumping frog named "Dan'l Webster"
and some Bowery Boys from New York. He re
turned to his cabin and wrote "The Celebrated
Jumping Frog of Calaveras County," a short
story which firmly established him as a humor
ist under the pen name of Mark Twain.
This was all the fable of Mark Twain until the
citizens of Calaveras County reenacted the first
frog jump to celebrate the paving of the Angel's

Camp streets in 1928. There were 51 frogs en
tered that first day; S(XX) people attended.
The frog jumping contest has since grown to
he full-scale extravaganza with a fair atten
dance of over 50.000. Frogs from South Ameri
ca. England, Germany. Australia and Canada
enter. Many preliminary contests around the
world qualify frogs to participate at the interna
tional championships in Angel's Camp. "E.
Davy Croakett," who jumped 20 feet, three in
ches now holds the world record for the longest
leap.
Frogs are best caught at night by momentari
ly blinding them with a flashlight. Frogs may
also be rented at Angel's Camp.

Berkeley is a place alive with a unique life
style and culture all its own, which can be stimu
lating ... if one takes it all with an open mind
and a sense of adventure.
WHALE WATCHING
Location: The coastal waters
from Baja California to the
Bering Sea
Cost: Varies depending on the
boat company and the length of
the trip, anywhere from $8 to
$35
•: t ,t j- rhe ''Vtst.il waters fro*n Baja

cean traffic as the Grey Whale make their an
cestral migration ... an event that spurs na

ture Tans to take to their boats to get an up-close
look at the great mammals who have made such
a phenomenal comeback.
In the last century, the Grey fell prey to the
Captain Ahabs of the Yankee whaling fleet.
The number of these animals fell from about
30,000 to near extinction. In 1895, they became
protected by law and have since rebounded to a

population close to 15.000.
After four months of feeding in the North Pa
cific. the herds migrate almost 6000 miles, led
by the pregnant females, to Scammon's Lagoon
in Baja, California. In the warm lagoons of

Baja, the fetnales calve and the calves stay with
the mother until the following.
Seeing a whale breach just yards away is a
breathtaking sight, but it's also possible that
you could go out for three hours and see noth
ing but seagulls.
Several boating companies regularly charter
trips to watch the whales: Marin Adventures, at
the College of Marin in Kentfield; the Oceanic
Society Whale Watch in San Francisco; and
Pillar Point Fishing Trips in Half Moon Bay.
If you have access to a boat, and want to go
out on your own, be aware that a federal law
posts a $10,000 fine if you come closer than 100
yards of a whale.
PARACHUTING

B> Heather Millar
1 placed my fool in the door. "Are you
ready?," he asked.
It was windy outside. A chill shot down my
spine. Could I finally find the courage to do it
this time? "I guess there's no way out," I re
plied.
"Nope," he replied. "The point is coming
up," and with a slap on the back, "GO!"
The rest of my body followed my foot out the
door into the emptiness below. Time seemed to
ripple and slow — nothing registered but the
disbelief that I had done it. I had jumped out the
door of an airplane! Three thousand feet of air
separated me and the ground.
Four seconds — was it minutes? — passed.
As the "static line" went taut, the parachute au
tomatically deployed with a gentle tug, billow
ing out into a light green jellyfish with tentacles,
or shroud lines, reaching down to my harness.
The view from 2500 feet spread the whole Bay
Area at my feet. The sun set into the fog,
silhouetting the live oaks on Mt. Diablo.
Never since have I felt more full of life ... or
more terrified.
The Antioch Parachute Center had done ev
erything possible to prepare me to react to any
situation that might arise on a first jump. Dur
ing Antioch's first jump course, which is akin
my vision of Marine boot camp, I had drilled: I
had gone through simulated jumps; I had
jumped off platforms; I had sweated; I had been
lectured to; I had practiced hopping out of an
aircraft on the ground.
When I strode out onto the tarmac outfitted
in a jump suit and parachute, I was sure, in
tellectually at least, that I was prepared for any
emergency. Emotionally, I felt like a sacrificial
lamb, trussed up for the cost of an first jump

course.
Walking back to the tarmac from my first
jump, it all seemed worth it. As Perry Stevens,
the center's owner, said in his lecture to my first
jump class, "Parachuting is the most fun you
can have with your clothes on!"
SKUNK TRAIN
Location: Central Terminal in
Fort Bragg, CA; four hours
from Stanford
Cost: $8.50 to $12.00 depend
ing on the route
By Heather Millar
Promontory point; great train robberies; the
Atchitson, Topeka and the Santa Fe — the 19th
century locomotive has captured the American
imagination. The Skunk Train line engines hark
back to the days when trains were trains,
robbers were robbers, redwoods stood tall and
the frontier was wild.
Originally a 40-mile long logging railroad
lugging great redwoods to Georgia-Pacific mills
in Fort Bragg, the Skunk line offered steam pas
senger service for about a decade until the self
powered Skunk trains were introduced in 1925.
The yellow one-car trains were named for their
original gas engines. As folks used to say, "You
can smell 'em before you see 'em."
In addition to the Skunks, which service
redwood communities inaccessable by road, the
line also runs two vintage logging "Super-
Skunk" locomotives complete with wood seats,

observation cars, and wizzcned conductors.
Rumbling through tunnels and over 31 tres
tles, the trains follow a lengthy stretch of the
Noyo river in course of their two round-trips
daily to Northspur, the half-way point in the
line. Passengers may stop at Northspur to await
the returning train and enjoy the cafe under the
redwoods. Or they may choose to spend a whole
day watching the redwoods between Fort Bragg
and Willits sweep past the open observation
car.
From Fort Bragg, the Skunk travels along
Pudding Creek, through the first tunnel and
along the Noyo. The trip to Northspur takes
about one hour.
From Willits, a 1700 climb into the rolling
hills immediately confronts the train. The track
descends from this summit down to apple
groves, wildflowers, cattle, and finally into the

deep forest groves surrounding Northspur.
Itineraries from Fort Bragg to Willits, Willits
to Fort Bragg, or from either end of the line to
Northspur and back can all be accomodated.
RIDGE VINEYARDS
Location: Saratoga, CA;about
one hour from Stanford
Cost: Free plus wine-tasting
By Heather Millar
Americans tend to idealize the farm with im
ages of "amber waves of grain." Yet only a
small percentage of the country's population
now lives in rural area. Few take part in the har
vest which appears miraculously on the nation's
supermarket shelves. But at Ridge Vineyards in
Saratoga, urban involvement in the harvest is a
tradition.
Ridge Vineyards, described by one owner as
a "big-small winery" with an output of about
30,000 cases a year, annually invites volunteers
.to Qorne help pick grapes.
Picking is a vefy, very special time," said
Sue Crane, one of Ridge's owners. "It's the
whole winemaking process in a capsule. It starts
with the grapes."
The volunteer grape-picking tradition started
more than twenty years ago when three SRI en
gineers, their families, and a bachelor bought
the acres on Montebello Ridge because, accord

ing to Crane, "it was a beautiful piece of land
and we wanted to make a small amount of wine
for ourselves." What used to be necessity has
become a tradition.
Ridge Vineyards has grown to become a well
respected winery with the distinction of elevat
ing Zinfandel to the level of a premium wine.
Although this growth has made it necessary to
hire a staff and bring in migrant workers to pick
grapes during the work week, Ridge still invites
volunteers to help on Saturdays during the pick-»
ing.
The day begins about 8 o'clock in the morn
ing, when grape knives are distributed and
pickers shown what to pick and what not to
pick. The amateurs pick from about 9 o'clock
until 1 o'clock and then convene to a picnic
lunch and a winetasting of older Ridge wines.
Only those over 21 can be served.
Wine has recently captured the American
taste, chardonnay replacing beer in popularity
and the wine cooler the martini. The word of
Ridge's tradition has now spread so wide that
although the picking used to open to all comers,
past volunteer pickers are now notified by a
"picking letter" and reservations must be made
in advance (phone 408-867-3233).
Picking starts "when the grapes are ready,"
usually in late September or in October and
goes on for about three weeks, says Crane.
Since that period spans only three Saturdays,
available spaces fill quickly. Between 200 and
300 people show up every harvest Saturday and
in the last few years Ridge has had to keep a
waiting list.
"We teach people how to pick; it's gotten
pretty formal" Crane said, remembering the
days when all the families would go out to har
vest and crush the grapes. "Sometimes I think
we should just bring in field workers and get the
whole thing overwith, but then I realize that this
is the thing relationships are made of..

SAN SIMEON
Location: San Simeon, CA,
about four hours from Stanford
Cost: $7 per tour

Imagine living in a castle with 38 bedrooms,
31 bathrooms, a movie theater, a refectory (din
ing hall) and two immense swimming pools.
Named La Cuesta Fncantada, The Enchanted
Hill, just such an estate sprawls over 123 acres
near the little town of San Simeon. Opulently
set against the Santa Lucia Mountains on a
coastal knoll overlooking the sea, the 137-foot
high mansion is surrounded by gardens, ter
races, pools and palatial guest houses.
Before 1958, the fabled mansion was ac
cessible only to friends and guests of William
Randolph Hearst, publishing magnate and
owner of the San Francisco Chronicle. Begun in
1922 to be the permanent residence of the
Hearst family, the castle was still unfinished at
the time of Hearst's death in 1951. It remains
uncompleted although this is hard to believe
when confronted with the profusion of statuary
and paintings that adorn the rooms of the four
mansions that make up the complex.
Seven years after Hearst's death, the Hearst
Corporation presented the castle to the state of
California with the understanding that it be pre
served as a memorial to Hearst and his mother.
Four different tours of the San Simeon estate
are available. Each two-hour tour covers a dif
ferent portion of the castle. More than one tour
may be taken in one day.
Tours are $8 each for adults and $4 for chil
dren. No student discounts are offered.
Advance reservations may be made through
Ticketron at 393-6914. For more specific in
formation, call the Hearst Castle at
(805)927-4621.
To drive to the castle, take Highway 1 (205
miles from San Francisco) or Highway 101 (245
miles from San Francisco) south. Although
Highway 1 is a scenic route which might take
about five hours, it is worth the detour along
tortuous roads to pass Carmel, Monterey, and
Big Sur.
Estimated driving time from Monterey to
San Simeon is three hours.

MOUNTAIN PLAY
Location: Top of Mount
Tamalpais, Marin County,
CA; about an hour and a half
drive from Stanford, shuttle
buses depart from Mill Valley
Cost: '83 prices not yet set 112 '82
prices $3 to $6.50

Marin County residents have a reputation for
doing things that are a little iconoclastic, a little
mellow and sinfully enjoyable. Of these, the
Mountain Play is one.
The site used for the plays descends with an
upper slope of Mount Tamalpais and curves
into a Greek style amphitheater. History buffs
claim that the site was once the scene of Indian
religious rites, because the shape of the site is
either a freak of nature or a work of man.
From the upper reaches of the outdoor theater a
hint of the San Francisco skyline can be seen
over the redwoods. Grass lines each level or row
of "seats;" and wildflowers poke through the
cracks. Each May, spectators spread blankets
on the grass for a different play.
The Mountain Play is one of the traditional
events in Marin County. It was first held in 1913
on land that then belonged to William Kent
when Kent owned most of the land on Mount
Tarn. When Kent died in 1928, he left the
Mountain Theater to the Mountain Play As
sociation which later had the stone levels in
stalled by the Civilian Conservation Corps.
HANDEL SING
Location: Louise M. Davies
Symphony Hall, San Francis
co, CA
Cost: not yet determined

For infusing good old Yuletide cheer, the An
nual Sing-lt-Yourself-Messiah sponsored by
the San Francisco Conservatory of Music,
would be hard to beat.
Conducting sing-alongs of the massive musi
cal work which Handel scrawled in only 24 days
is not an original idea. Groups throughout Eng

land have been gathering for years to sing this
composer's most popular choral work. But the
Conservatory of Music has created a unique
tradition by televising the event live from Lou
ise M. Davies Symphony Hall.
The over 3000 tickets available each year sell
out about as fast as you can say "Deck the Halls
with Boughs of Holly." Two hours after tickets
went on sale in 1980, they were gone. The event
is beginning to attract a cult following of Bay
Area choral enthusiasts such as the Con
servatory Singers and the San Francisco Gay
Men's Chorus. But everyone, regardless of vo
cal persuasion, is welcomed and expected to
join in.
Companies such as the Emporium and the
Transamerica Corporation usually contribute
to cost of renting the hall, and the ticket sales
have raised over $20,000 for the San Francisco
Conservatory Scholarship Fund in past years.
It has been said, but not verified, that the San
Francisco sing is the largest rendition of the
Handel hit — sending the famous chorus of
"Hallelujah!" booming out of Davies and echo
ing across the San Francisco Civic Center. Last
year the exultation grew so powerful that 14

Christmas trees on the stage shook.
The chorus is accompanied by the San Fran
cisco Conservatory Orchestra and is conducted
by Louis Magor, director of the San Francisco
Symphony Chorus.
Hallelujah!
MUD BATHS
Location: Calistoga, CA;
about two hours from Stanford
Cost: Varies with treatment, up
to $31

Hot, mucky mud may not conjure up dec
adent luxury. But mudbaths are popular among
students — and they are available three hours
away in the Napa Valley town of Calistoga.
So if hot tubs and saunas have become old
hat, try mudbaths. Calistoga isone of only a few
mudbath capitals in the world, housing four
mudbath centers. Dr. Wilkinson's, the most
well-known and posh mudbath center, offers a
full treatment for $31. The mudbath center has
been shown on several television feature pro
grams, including Evening Magazine on San
Francisco's Channel 5
The mud in Calistoga — and in a few places
back east and in the desert — is special because
it is mixed with mineral water from local hot
springs. The fine-grained mud, like lava, is
black and somewhat gritty. It smells vaguely
sulfurous because of its mineral content.
Allegedly, the baths have a unique ability to
eliminate toxins from the human system. The
relaxing hot mud process cleanses the body by

opening pores, providing a drawing action that
saunas and hot tubs do not.
Mudbather Dave Bassett described the proc
ess as "a very gradual warming of the body."
Graduate Karen Halbo, another mudbather,
said, "It's like being in very warm water, but
you feel it more. . .you're supported."
The mud goes up to the shoulders, enabling
bathers to sip water through a straw.
A full treatment includes a mud bath, an indi
vidual mineral water whirlpool tub, a steamroll
and blanket rub, and a half-hour full body
massage. The entire process takes about two
hours and 15 minutes. "It's fun, it's great, it's
good for your health, it's competelv relaxing."
said one mudbather.
"It's a great way to go pamper yourself," said
Halbo.
Although the weather and the world's vaca
tion schedule have made March to October the
official mudbath season. Dr. Wilkinson's is
open every day of the year (except Christmas
and New Year's Day).
GOLD PANNING
Location: the Mother Lode in
the foothills of the Sierra Ne
vada, an average of four hours
away from Stanford
Cost: varies with area and pro
gram from $5 to over $50

I remember panning gold for the first time:
I squatted about knee deep in a stream running
out of the Sierra foothills, letting silt and sand

swirl through, and out of, my gold pan ... a
glint, a small nuggget, a glint, a flake. What I
gleaned from the stream that day was hardly
enough to buy a carton of milk, hut the thrill of
the glint-a-nugget-glint-a-flake process out
weighed the scantiness of my find.
No one organized park or facility exists for
those wanting to relive the days of the '49ers.
Perhaps it is this lack of organization that
makes panning gold in the Mother Lode so en
joyable. It leaves some of the adventure in the
bargain. Any stretch of stream or river is open
game, provided it is not already claimed.
Often the existence of a claim is hard to de
termine. especially on well-worked streams
such as the American River. Caution is war
ranted if you're out exploring on your own.
Prospectors are very possessive of their
claims. If you're set on exploring on your own,
the best approach is to look up the local sport
ing goods store in town — most of them also
carry prospecting equipment — and ask for ad
vice. The store owner probably has a claim of
his own and would be glad to help out.
Of course, most campgrounds in the Sierra
foothills rent gold panning equipment and les
sons. There are organized gold-seeking river
raft trips. Some prospectors rent out their
claims. Others make a business oTletting people
come up to their claim and watch a gold dredge
in action and perhaps pan a little.
The most important thing to remember
about prospecting for a weekend is that the
search is the challenge. You'll probably find
some gold, a glint, but it won't rival the dis
covery at Sutter's Mill in 1840's which got this
whole business started. You'll be lucky to get a
carton of milk out of the deal.

SOL VANG
Location: Solvang, CA; 45
miles north of Santa Barbara
Cost: Varies

Set against the blue Southern California sky
of the Santa Ynez Valley 45 miles north of San
ta Barbara, the thatched roofs of Solvang recre
ate a page out of Hans Christian Anderson.
Though far from being exclusively Danish,
Solvang is laid out like a 19th century Danish
village. Windmills turn lazily in the bree/.e.
Plaster and timber houses with gables and

steeply pitched roofs and Copenhagen gas
lights line the streets. Storks guard the chim
neys Aromas from the town's famous bakeries
which produce breads and pastries from cen
tury-old recipes filter into where visitors and
residents — many of them speaking Danish —
stroll.
Three Danish-horn educators and clergymen
founded Solvang seventy years ago, intending
to use the town as a site for a folk school pat
terned after the Danish College of Grand View
in Des Moines. Atterdag College opened its
doors to students in 1914.
The early settlers were almost exclusively
D;inish-born or of Danish extraction and fol
lowed such trades as farming and carpentry.
Solvang soon became the economic center of
the Santa Yne/ Valley and native Americans
began to settle there. But the Scandinavian trad
ition has been reinforced by a steady influx of
first-generation Danes. Danish is taught in the
schools and most families attend the Danish ru
ral-styled Bethania Lutheran Church.
The annual "Danish Days" festival, usually
held the third weekend in September, accents
the town's heritage. Groups of traditional
singers and dancers rove the streets; and the Vil
lage Band plays atop the Carlsberg beer wagon.
Villagers dressed in Danish costumes, serve an
aebleskiver breakfast on the streets.
During the summer, a company of 200, the
Solvang Theatrefest, performs seven open-air
productions in rotating repertory. Construc
tion of an indoor theatre will be finished some
time this year, and plays will then be offered
year-round.
Other notable Solvang festivals include the
July 4th and Christmas parades.
CALA VERAS JUMP
ING FROG JUBILEE
Location: Angel's Camp,
Calaveras County in the Moth
er Lode; CA about three hours
from Stanford
Cost: travel, $3 entry fee for
your frog, $5-$6 admission to
the Fair
Samuel Clemens has been blamed for the
whole craziness held annually during the third
week of May: the Cala'eras Jumping Frog
Jubilee.
After a trip to the Mother Lode in the days
when '49ers kept the area a wild country,
Clemens heard a tale of a man named Jim
Smiley, a jumping frog named "Dan'l Webster"
and some Bowery Boys from New York. He re
turned to his cabin and wrote "The Celebrated
Jumping Frog of Calaveras County," a short
story which firmly established him as a humor
ist under the pen name of Mark Twain.
This was all the fable of Mark Twain until the
citizens of Calaveras County reenacted the first
frog jump to celebrate the paving of the Angel's

Camp streets in 1928. There were 51 frogs en
tered that first day; S(XX) people attended.
The frog jumping contest has since grown to
he full-scale extravaganza with a fair atten
dance of over 50.000. Frogs from South Ameri
ca. England, Germany. Australia and Canada
enter. Many preliminary contests around the
world qualify frogs to participate at the interna
tional championships in Angel's Camp. "E.
Davy Croakett," who jumped 20 feet, three in
ches now holds the world record for the longest
leap.
Frogs are best caught at night by momentari
ly blinding them with a flashlight. Frogs may
also be rented at Angel's Camp.

BALLOONING
Location: Napa, CA; two hours
from Stanford
Cost: $95 per person for one
hour
By Heather Millar
Californians get into some pretty weird and
extravagant things. Of this genre, taking a
champagne flight over the Napa Valley at misty
dawn has to be the ultimate California ex
perience.
Balloon Aviation of Napa Valley flies cham
pagne balloon flights over the heart of the Napa
Valley seven days a week. Each flight is led by
an FAA certified pilot and two ground crew,
but guests are invited to help with the inflation
of the balloon. The balloon pilots can also make
an entry in a passenger's log book, if desired.
The flight itself takes about one hour and is
followed by a lavish champagne brunch.
Plenty of time remains for visitors to tour the
wineries of Napa Valley or the Calistoga hot
springs.
BERKELEY
Location: east 112 across the Bay;
about one hour from Stanford
Cost: Varies
By Jane Bailie
"There's no where like Berzerkeley!" stu
dents of the University of California at Berkeley
laughingly exclaim as they weave their way
down Telegraph Avenue, many of them seem
ingl\ oblivious to their surroundings, treating
each new human "obstacle" as something to be
ignored rather than accosted.
The city of Berkeley has been known to at
tract some of the more eccentric personalities of
the local area. The shops and streets are painted
with a certain amount of "human color," some
of it psychedelic.
The "Red Man" can been seen virtually any
day parading around the streets of Berkeley,
dressed completely from head to foot in a vi
brant shade of scarlet, carrying on his back a
stuffed puppet the size of a small child.
"Crazy William" is rumored to have been a
philosophy graduate student who "went over
the edge." He painted his clothes and face with
dollar-size red polka dots and now camps out
on Telegraph making faces at people and gener
ally drawing attention to himself. "You have to
be normal to stand out" many freshmen are
told, and despite the large student population,
many often find this the case.
The city carries with it an atmosphere which
is probably unique throughout the country.
"It's very much the 'Live and let live' philosphy
here." explained one woman resident. "With
this kind of community, there's got to be some
sort of laissez-faire."
Telegraph Avenue presents the viewer with a
variety of impressons. One is immediately
struck by the diversity not only of the architec
ture fronting the street, but of the people who
frequent the street itself. Ever since the I%o's,
when students and police often clashed in riots
>nd anti-war demonstrations Berkeley has ac
quired the reputation as a city w here the "hippy
radicals" of his bygone period have been able to
retain those qualities which have made such a
mark on the last two decades in American pop
culture.
Berkeley is often still considered a mecca for
political demonstrators and activists. Few
causes seem to go noticed. Supporters of ev
erything from the nuclear freeze to sailing
classes establish themselves in Sproul Plaza, a
focal point of the UC campus. During the late
morning and early afternoon, it is difficult to
cross this stretch of pavement without being
asked to sign any number of political petitons
or join a variety of activist groups.
Though ni'nn >112 •' ■ -h 'he area mav
students tend to p oe'uist; tactics" to
ward off the more adament of these represent
ative demonstrators. Clutching textbooks and

note pads, students can be seen with heads bent
and eyes focused firmly on the ground in front
of them as they quickly stride through crowd of
activists proffering petitions.
The majority of those persons often con
sidered "unusual" are in reality harmless, pro
vided they are not provoked. "Whatever you do
or see, avoid eye contact!" is the often repeated

line of advice given to those unfamiliar with the
area.
With its seemingly unending stream of street
vendors, whose merchandise ranges from Indi
an jewelry to tie-dyed clothing, the northern

section of Telegraph Avenue may give the ap
pearance of being a shopping mall rather than a
city street. Combined with the already static at
mosphere which seems to pervade much of the
area surrounding the UC Berkeley campus this
extremely heterogeneous mixture of humanity
can, to say the least, be overwhelming.
Berkeley is a place alive with a unique life
style and culture all its own, which can be stimu
lating ... if one takes it all with an open mind
and a sense of adventure.
WHALE WATCHING

In the last century, the Grey fell prey to the
Captain Ahabs of the Yankee whaling fleet.
The number of these animals fell from about
30,000 to near extinction. In 1895, they became
protected by law and have since rebounded to a

population close to 15.000.
After four months of feeding in the North Pa
cific. the herds migrate almost 6000 miles, led
by the pregnant females, to Scammon's Lagoon
in Baja, California. In the warm lagoons of

Baja, the fetnales calve and the calves stay with
the mother until the following.
Seeing a whale breach just yards away is a
breathtaking sight, but it's also possible that
you could go out for three hours and see noth
ing but seagulls.
Several boating companies regularly charter
trips to watch the whales: Marin Adventures, at
the College of Marin in Kentfield; the Oceanic
Society Whale Watch in San Francisco; and
Pillar Point Fishing Trips in Half Moon Bay.
If you have access to a boat, and want to go
out on your own, be aware that a federal law
posts a $10,000 fine if you come closer than 100
yards of a whale.

It was windy outside. A chill shot down my
spine. Could I finally find the courage to do it
this time? "I guess there's no way out," I re
plied.
"Nope," he replied. "The point is coming
up," and with a slap on the back, "GO!"
The rest of my body followed my foot out the
door into the emptiness below. Time seemed to
ripple and slow — nothing registered but the
disbelief that I had done it. I had jumped out the
door of an airplane! Three thousand feet of air
separated me and the ground.
Four seconds — was it minutes? — passed.
As the "static line" went taut, the parachute au
tomatically deployed with a gentle tug, billow
ing out into a light green jellyfish with tentacles,
or shroud lines, reaching down to my harness.
The view from 2500 feet spread the whole Bay
Area at my feet. The sun set into the fog,
silhouetting the live oaks on Mt. Diablo.
Never since have I felt more full of life ... or
more terrified.
The Antioch Parachute Center had done ev

ing on the route
By Heather Millar
Promontory point; great train robberies; the
Atchitson, Topeka and the Santa Fe — the 19th
century locomotive has captured the American
imagination. The Skunk Train line engines hark
back to the days when trains were trains,
robbers were robbers, redwoods stood tall and
the frontier was wild.
Originally a 40-mile long logging railroad
lugging great redwoods to Georgia-Pacific mills
in Fort Bragg, the Skunk line offered steam pas
senger service for about a decade until the self
powered Skunk trains were introduced in 1925.
The yellow one-car trains were named for their
original gas engines. As folks used to say, "You
can smell 'em before you see 'em."
In addition to the Skunks, which service
redwood communities inaccessable by road, the
line also runs two vintage logging "Super-
Skunk" locomotives complete with wood seats,

observation cars, and wizzcned conductors.
Rumbling through tunnels and over 31 tres
tles, the trains follow a lengthy stretch of the
Noyo river in course of their two round-trips
daily to Northspur, the half-way point in the
line. Passengers may stop at Northspur to await
the returning train and enjoy the cafe under the
redwoods. Or they may choose to spend a whole
day watching the redwoods between Fort Bragg
and Willits sweep past the open observation
car.
From Fort Bragg, the Skunk travels along
Pudding Creek, through the first tunnel and
along the Noyo. The trip to Northspur takes
about one hour.
From Willits, a 1700 climb into the rolling
hills immediately confronts the train. The track
descends from this summit down to apple
groves, wildflowers, cattle, and finally into the

deep forest groves surrounding Northspur.
Itineraries from Fort Bragg to Willits, Willits
to Fort Bragg, or from either end of the line to
Northspur and back can all be accomodated.
RIDGE VINEYARDS
Location: Saratoga, CA;about
one hour from Stanford
Cost: Free plus wine-tasting
By Heather Millar
Americans tend to idealize the farm with im
ages of "amber waves of grain." Yet only a
small percentage of the country's population
now lives in rural area. Few take part in the har
vest which appears miraculously on the nation's
supermarket shelves. But at Ridge Vineyards in
Saratoga, urban involvement in the harvest is a
tradition.
Ridge Vineyards, described by one owner as
a "big-small winery" with an output of about
30,000 cases a year, annually invites volunteers
.to Qorne help pick grapes.
Picking is a vefy, very special time," said
Sue Crane, one of Ridge's owners. "It's the
whole winemaking process in a capsule. It starts
with the grapes."
The volunteer grape-picking tradition started
more than twenty years ago when three SRI en
gineers, their families, and a bachelor bought
the acres on Montebello Ridge because, accord

ing to Crane, "it was a beautiful piece of land
and we wanted to make a small amount of wine
for ourselves." What used to be necessity has
become a tradition.
Ridge Vineyards has grown to become a well
respected winery with the distinction of elevat
ing Zinfandel to the level of a premium wine.
Although this growth has made it necessary to
hire a staff and bring in migrant workers to pick
grapes during the work week, Ridge still invites
volunteers to help on Saturdays during the pick-»
ing.
The day begins about 8 o'clock in the morn
ing, when grape knives are distributed and
pickers shown what to pick and what not to
pick. The amateurs pick from about 9 o'clock
until 1 o'clock and then convene to a picnic
lunch and a winetasting of older Ridge wines.
Only those over 21 can be served.
Wine has recently captured the American
taste, chardonnay replacing beer in popularity
and the wine cooler the martini. The word of
Ridge's tradition has now spread so wide that
although the picking used to open to all comers,
past volunteer pickers are now notified by a
"picking letter" and reservations must be made
in advance (phone 408-867-3233).
Picking starts "when the grapes are ready,"
usually in late September or in October and
goes on for about three weeks, says Crane.
Since that period spans only three Saturdays,
available spaces fill quickly. Between 200 and
300 people show up every harvest Saturday and
in the last few years Ridge has had to keep a
waiting list.
"We teach people how to pick; it's gotten
pretty formal" Crane said, remembering the
days when all the families would go out to har
vest and crush the grapes. "Sometimes I think
we should just bring in field workers and get the
whole thing overwith, but then I realize that this
is the thing relationships are made of..

SAN SIMEON
Location: San Simeon, CA,
about four hours from Stanford
Cost: $7 per tour

Imagine living in a castle with 38 bedrooms,
31 bathrooms, a movie theater, a refectory (din
ing hall) and two immense swimming pools.
Named La Cuesta Fncantada, The Enchanted
Hill, just such an estate sprawls over 123 acres
near the little town of San Simeon. Opulently
set against the Santa Lucia Mountains on a
coastal knoll overlooking the sea, the 137-foot
high mansion is surrounded by gardens, ter
races, pools and palatial guest houses.
Before 1958, the fabled mansion was ac
cessible only to friends and guests of William
Randolph Hearst, publishing magnate and
owner of the San Francisco Chronicle. Begun in
1922 to be the permanent residence of the
Hearst family, the castle was still unfinished at
the time of Hearst's death in 1951. It remains
uncompleted although this is hard to believe
when confronted with the profusion of statuary
and paintings that adorn the rooms of the four
mansions that make up the complex.
Seven years after Hearst's death, the Hearst
Corporation presented the castle to the state of
California with the understanding that it be pre
served as a memorial to Hearst and his mother.
Four different tours of the San Simeon estate
are available. Each two-hour tour covers a dif
ferent portion of the castle. More than one tour
may be taken in one day.
Tours are $8 each for adults and $4 for chil
dren. No student discounts are offered.
Advance reservations may be made through
Ticketron at 393-6914. For more specific in
formation, call the Hearst Castle at
(805)927-4621.
To drive to the castle, take Highway 1 (205
miles from San Francisco) or Highway 101 (245
miles from San Francisco) south. Although
Highway 1 is a scenic route which might take
about five hours, it is worth the detour along
tortuous roads to pass Carmel, Monterey, and
Big Sur.
Estimated driving time from Monterey to
San Simeon is three hours.

MOUNTAIN PLAY
Location: Top of Mount
Tamalpais, Marin County,
CA; about an hour and a half
drive from Stanford, shuttle
buses depart from Mill Valley
Cost: '83 prices not yet set 112 '82
prices $3 to $6.50

Marin County residents have a reputation for
doing things that are a little iconoclastic, a little
mellow and sinfully enjoyable. Of these, the
Mountain Play is one.
The site used for the plays descends with an
upper slope of Mount Tamalpais and curves
into a Greek style amphitheater. History buffs
claim that the site was once the scene of Indian
religious rites, because the shape of the site is
either a freak of nature or a work of man.
From the upper reaches of the outdoor theater a
hint of the San Francisco skyline can be seen
over the redwoods. Grass lines each level or row
of "seats;" and wildflowers poke through the
cracks. Each May, spectators spread blankets
on the grass for a different play.
The Mountain Play is one of the traditional
events in Marin County. It was first held in 1913
on land that then belonged to William Kent
when Kent owned most of the land on Mount
Tarn. When Kent died in 1928, he left the
Mountain Theater to the Mountain Play As
sociation which later had the stone levels in
stalled by the Civilian Conservation Corps.
HANDEL SING
Location: Louise M. Davies
Symphony Hall, San Francis
co, CA
Cost: not yet determined

For infusing good old Yuletide cheer, the An
nual Sing-lt-Yourself-Messiah sponsored by
the San Francisco Conservatory of Music,
would be hard to beat.
Conducting sing-alongs of the massive musi
cal work which Handel scrawled in only 24 days
is not an original idea. Groups throughout Eng

land have been gathering for years to sing this
composer's most popular choral work. But the
Conservatory of Music has created a unique
tradition by televising the event live from Lou
ise M. Davies Symphony Hall.
The over 3000 tickets available each year sell
out about as fast as you can say "Deck the Halls
with Boughs of Holly." Two hours after tickets
went on sale in 1980, they were gone. The event
is beginning to attract a cult following of Bay
Area choral enthusiasts such as the Con
servatory Singers and the San Francisco Gay
Men's Chorus. But everyone, regardless of vo
cal persuasion, is welcomed and expected to
join in.
Companies such as the Emporium and the
Transamerica Corporation usually contribute
to cost of renting the hall, and the ticket sales
have raised over $20,000 for the San Francisco
Conservatory Scholarship Fund in past years.
It has been said, but not verified, that the San
Francisco sing is the largest rendition of the
Handel hit — sending the famous chorus of
"Hallelujah!" booming out of Davies and echo
ing across the San Francisco Civic Center. Last
year the exultation grew so powerful that 14

Christmas trees on the stage shook.
The chorus is accompanied by the San Fran
cisco Conservatory Orchestra and is conducted
by Louis Magor, director of the San Francisco
Symphony Chorus.
Hallelujah!
MUD BATHS
Location: Calistoga, CA;
about two hours from Stanford
Cost: Varies with treatment, up
to $31

Hot, mucky mud may not conjure up dec
adent luxury. But mudbaths are popular among
students — and they are available three hours
away in the Napa Valley town of Calistoga.
So if hot tubs and saunas have become old
hat, try mudbaths. Calistoga isone of only a few
mudbath capitals in the world, housing four
mudbath centers. Dr. Wilkinson's, the most
well-known and posh mudbath center, offers a
full treatment for $31. The mudbath center has
been shown on several television feature pro
grams, including Evening Magazine on San
Francisco's Channel 5
The mud in Calistoga — and in a few places
back east and in the desert — is special because
it is mixed with mineral water from local hot
springs. The fine-grained mud, like lava, is
black and somewhat gritty. It smells vaguely
sulfurous because of its mineral content.
Allegedly, the baths have a unique ability to
eliminate toxins from the human system. The
relaxing hot mud process cleanses the body by

opening pores, providing a drawing action that
saunas and hot tubs do not.
Mudbather Dave Bassett described the proc
ess as "a very gradual warming of the body."
Graduate Karen Halbo, another mudbather,
said, "It's like being in very warm water, but
you feel it more. . .you're supported."
The mud goes up to the shoulders, enabling
bathers to sip water through a straw.
A full treatment includes a mud bath, an indi
vidual mineral water whirlpool tub, a steamroll
and blanket rub, and a half-hour full body
massage. The entire process takes about two
hours and 15 minutes. "It's fun, it's great, it's
good for your health, it's competelv relaxing."
said one mudbather.
"It's a great way to go pamper yourself," said
Halbo.
Although the weather and the world's vaca
tion schedule have made March to October the
official mudbath season. Dr. Wilkinson's is
open every day of the year (except Christmas
and New Year's Day).
GOLD PANNING
Location: the Mother Lode in
the foothills of the Sierra Ne
vada, an average of four hours
away from Stanford
Cost: varies with area and pro
gram from $5 to over $50

I remember panning gold for the first time:
I squatted about knee deep in a stream running
out of the Sierra foothills, letting silt and sand

swirl through, and out of, my gold pan ... a
glint, a small nuggget, a glint, a flake. What I
gleaned from the stream that day was hardly
enough to buy a carton of milk, hut the thrill of
the glint-a-nugget-glint-a-flake process out
weighed the scantiness of my find.
No one organized park or facility exists for
those wanting to relive the days of the '49ers.
Perhaps it is this lack of organization that
makes panning gold in the Mother Lode so en
joyable. It leaves some of the adventure in the
bargain. Any stretch of stream or river is open
game, provided it is not already claimed.
Often the existence of a claim is hard to de
termine. especially on well-worked streams
such as the American River. Caution is war
ranted if you're out exploring on your own.
Prospectors are very possessive of their
claims. If you're set on exploring on your own,
the best approach is to look up the local sport
ing goods store in town — most of them also
carry prospecting equipment — and ask for ad
vice. The store owner probably has a claim of
his own and would be glad to help out.
Of course, most campgrounds in the Sierra
foothills rent gold panning equipment and les
sons. There are organized gold-seeking river
raft trips. Some prospectors rent out their
claims. Others make a business oTletting people
come up to their claim and watch a gold dredge
in action and perhaps pan a little.
The most important thing to remember
about prospecting for a weekend is that the
search is the challenge. You'll probably find
some gold, a glint, but it won't rival the dis
covery at Sutter's Mill in 1840's which got this
whole business started. You'll be lucky to get a
carton of milk out of the deal.

SOL VANG
Location: Solvang, CA; 45
miles north of Santa Barbara
Cost: Varies

Set against the blue Southern California sky
of the Santa Ynez Valley 45 miles north of San
ta Barbara, the thatched roofs of Solvang recre
ate a page out of Hans Christian Anderson.
Though far from being exclusively Danish,
Solvang is laid out like a 19th century Danish
village. Windmills turn lazily in the bree/.e.
Plaster and timber houses with gables and

steeply pitched roofs and Copenhagen gas
lights line the streets. Storks guard the chim
neys Aromas from the town's famous bakeries
which produce breads and pastries from cen
tury-old recipes filter into where visitors and
residents — many of them speaking Danish —
stroll.
Three Danish-horn educators and clergymen
founded Solvang seventy years ago, intending
to use the town as a site for a folk school pat
terned after the Danish College of Grand View
in Des Moines. Atterdag College opened its
doors to students in 1914.
The early settlers were almost exclusively
D;inish-born or of Danish extraction and fol
lowed such trades as farming and carpentry.
Solvang soon became the economic center of
the Santa Yne/ Valley and native Americans
began to settle there. But the Scandinavian trad
ition has been reinforced by a steady influx of
first-generation Danes. Danish is taught in the
schools and most families attend the Danish ru
ral-styled Bethania Lutheran Church.
The annual "Danish Days" festival, usually
held the third weekend in September, accents
the town's heritage. Groups of traditional
singers and dancers rove the streets; and the Vil
lage Band plays atop the Carlsberg beer wagon.
Villagers dressed in Danish costumes, serve an
aebleskiver breakfast on the streets.
During the summer, a company of 200, the
Solvang Theatrefest, performs seven open-air
productions in rotating repertory. Construc
tion of an indoor theatre will be finished some
time this year, and plays will then be offered
year-round.
Other notable Solvang festivals include the
July 4th and Christmas parades.
CALA VERAS JUMP
ING FROG JUBILEE
Location: Angel's Camp,
Calaveras County in the Moth
er Lode; CA about three hours
from Stanford
Cost: travel, $3 entry fee for
your frog, $5-$6 admission to
the Fair
Samuel Clemens has been blamed for the
whole craziness held annually during the third
week of May: the Cala'eras Jumping Frog
Jubilee.
After a trip to the Mother Lode in the days
when '49ers kept the area a wild country,
Clemens heard a tale of a man named Jim
Smiley, a jumping frog named "Dan'l Webster"
and some Bowery Boys from New York. He re
turned to his cabin and wrote "The Celebrated
Jumping Frog of Calaveras County," a short
story which firmly established him as a humor
ist under the pen name of Mark Twain.
This was all the fable of Mark Twain until the
citizens of Calaveras County reenacted the first
frog jump to celebrate the paving of the Angel's

Camp streets in 1928. There were 51 frogs en
tered that first day; S(XX) people attended.
The frog jumping contest has since grown to
he full-scale extravaganza with a fair atten
dance of over 50.000. Frogs from South Ameri
ca. England, Germany. Australia and Canada
enter. Many preliminary contests around the
world qualify frogs to participate at the interna
tional championships in Angel's Camp. "E.
Davy Croakett," who jumped 20 feet, three in
ches now holds the world record for the longest
leap.
Frogs are best caught at night by momentari
ly blinding them with a flashlight. Frogs may
also be rented at Angel's Camp.

BALLOONING
Location: Napa, CA; two hours
from Stanford
Cost: $95 per person for one
hour
By Heather Millar
Californians get into some pretty weird and
extravagant things. Of this genre, taking a
champagne flight over the Napa Valley at misty
dawn has to be the ultimate California ex
perience.
Balloon Aviation of Napa Valley flies cham
pagne balloon flights over the heart of the Napa
Valley seven days a week. Each flight is led by
an FAA certified pilot and two ground crew,
but guests are invited to help with the inflation
of the balloon. The balloon pilots can also make
an entry in a passenger's log book, if desired.
The flight itself takes about one hour and is
followed by a lavish champagne brunch.
Plenty of time remains for visitors to tour the
wineries of Napa Valley or the Calistoga hot
springs.
BERKELEY
Location: east 112 across the Bay;
about one hour from Stanford
Cost: Varies
By Jane Bailie
"There's no where like Berzerkeley!" stu
dents of the University of California at Berkeley
laughingly exclaim as they weave their way
down Telegraph Avenue, many of them seem
ingl\ oblivious to their surroundings, treating
each new human "obstacle" as something to be
ignored rather than accosted.
The city of Berkeley has been known to at
tract some of the more eccentric personalities of
the local area. The shops and streets are painted
with a certain amount of "human color," some
of it psychedelic.
The "Red Man" can been seen virtually any
day parading around the streets of Berkeley,
dressed completely from head to foot in a vi
brant shade of scarlet, carrying on his back a
stuffed puppet the size of a small child.
"Crazy William" is rumored to have been a
philosophy graduate student who "went over
the edge." He painted his clothes and face with
dollar-size red polka dots and now camps out
on Telegraph making faces at people and gener
ally drawing attention to himself. "You have to
be normal to stand out" many freshmen are
told, and despite the large student population,
many often find this the case.
The city carries with it an atmosphere which
is probably unique throughout the country.
"It's very much the 'Live and let live' philosphy
here." explained one woman resident. "With
this kind of community, there's got to be some
sort of laissez-faire."
Telegraph Avenue presents the viewer with a
variety of impressons. One is immediately
struck by the diversity not only of the architec
ture fronting the street, but of the people who
frequent the street itself. Ever since the I%o's,
when students and police often clashed in riots
>nd anti-war demonstrations Berkeley has ac
quired the reputation as a city w here the "hippy
radicals" of his bygone period have been able to
retain those qualities which have made such a
mark on the last two decades in American pop
culture.
Berkeley is often still considered a mecca for
political demonstrators and activists. Few
causes seem to go noticed. Supporters of ev
erything from the nuclear freeze to sailing
classes establish themselves in Sproul Plaza, a
focal point of the UC campus. During the late
morning and early afternoon, it is difficult to
cross this stretch of pavement without being
asked to sign any number of political petitons
or join a variety of activist groups.
Though ni'nn >112 •' ■ -h 'he area mav
students tend to p oe'uist; tactics" to
ward off the more adament of these represent
ative demonstrators. Clutching textbooks and

note pads, students can be seen with heads bent
and eyes focused firmly on the ground in front
of them as they quickly stride through crowd of
activists proffering petitions.
The majority of those persons often con
sidered "unusual" are in reality harmless, pro
vided they are not provoked. "Whatever you do
or see, avoid eye contact!" is the often repeated

line of advice given to those unfamiliar with the
area.
With its seemingly unending stream of street
vendors, whose merchandise ranges from Indi
an jewelry to tie-dyed clothing, the northern

section of Telegraph Avenue may give the ap
pearance of being a shopping mall rather than a
city street. Combined with the already static at
mosphere which seems to pervade much of the
area surrounding the UC Berkeley campus this
extremely heterogeneous mixture of humanity
can, to say the least, be overwhelming.
Berkeley is a place alive with a unique life
style and culture all its own, which can be stimu
lating ... if one takes it all with an open mind
and a sense of adventure.
WHALE WATCHING
Location: The coastal waters
from Baja California to the
Bering Sea
Cost: Varies depending on the
boat company and the length of
the trip, anywhere from $8 to
$35
•: t ,t j- rhe ''Vtst.il waters fro*n Baja
(. alifornia to the Bering Sea are filled *uh ceta
cean traffic as the Grey Whale make their an
cestral migration ... an event that spurs na

ture Tans to take to their boats to get an up-close
look at the great mammals who have made such
a phenomenal comeback.
In the last century, the Grey fell prey to the
Captain Ahabs of the Yankee whaling fleet.
The number of these animals fell from about
30,000 to near extinction. In 1895, they became
protected by law and have since rebounded to a

population close to 15.000.
After four months of feeding in the North Pa
cific. the herds migrate almost 6000 miles, led
by the pregnant females, to Scammon's Lagoon
in Baja, California. In the warm lagoons of

Baja, the fetnales calve and the calves stay with
the mother until the following.
Seeing a whale breach just yards away is a
breathtaking sight, but it's also possible that
you could go out for three hours and see noth
ing but seagulls.
Several boating companies regularly charter
trips to watch the whales: Marin Adventures, at
the College of Marin in Kentfield; the Oceanic
Society Whale Watch in San Francisco; and
Pillar Point Fishing Trips in Half Moon Bay.
If you have access to a boat, and want to go
out on your own, be aware that a federal law
posts a $10,000 fine if you come closer than 100
yards of a whale.
PARACHUTING
Location:Antioch, CA; about
two hours from Stanford
Cost: For groups of one to three
$85 each, larger groups as low
as $70 each
B> Heather Millar
1 placed my fool in the door. "Are you
ready?," he asked.
It was windy outside. A chill shot down my
spine. Could I finally find the courage to do it
this time? "I guess there's no way out," I re
plied.
"Nope," he replied. "The point is coming
up," and with a slap on the back, "GO!"
The rest of my body followed my foot out the
door into the emptiness below. Time seemed to
ripple and slow — nothing registered but the
disbelief that I had done it. I had jumped out the
door of an airplane! Three thousand feet of air
separated me and the ground.
Four seconds — was it minutes? — passed.
As the "static line" went taut, the parachute au
tomatically deployed with a gentle tug, billow
ing out into a light green jellyfish with tentacles,
or shroud lines, reaching down to my harness.
The view from 2500 feet spread the whole Bay
Area at my feet. The sun set into the fog,
silhouetting the live oaks on Mt. Diablo.
Never since have I felt more full of life ... or
more terrified.
The Antioch Parachute Center had done ev
erything possible to prepare me to react to any
situation that might arise on a first jump. Dur
ing Antioch's first jump course, which is akin
my vision of Marine boot camp, I had drilled: I
had gone through simulated jumps; I had
jumped off platforms; I had sweated; I had been
lectured to; I had practiced hopping out of an
aircraft on the ground.
When I strode out onto the tarmac outfitted
in a jump suit and parachute, I was sure, in
tellectually at least, that I was prepared for any
emergency. Emotionally, I felt like a sacrificial
lamb, trussed up for the cost of an first jump

course.
Walking back to the tarmac from my first
jump, it all seemed worth it. As Perry Stevens,
the center's owner, said in his lecture to my first
jump class, "Parachuting is the most fun you
can have with your clothes on!"
SKUNK TRAIN
Location: Central Terminal in
Fort Bragg, CA; four hours
from Stanford
Cost: $8.50 to $12.00 depend
ing on the route
By Heather Millar
Promontory point; great train robberies; the
Atchitson, Topeka and the Santa Fe — the 19th
century locomotive has captured the American
imagination. The Skunk Train line engines hark
back to the days when trains were trains,
robbers were robbers, redwoods stood tall and
the frontier was wild.
Originally a 40-mile long logging railroad
lugging great redwoods to Georgia-Pacific mills
in Fort Bragg, the Skunk line offered steam pas
senger service for about a decade until the self
powered Skunk trains were introduced in 1925.
The yellow one-car trains were named for their
original gas engines. As folks used to say, "You
can smell 'em before you see 'em."
In addition to the Skunks, which service
redwood communities inaccessable by road, the
line also runs two vintage logging "Super-
Skunk" locomotives complete with wood seats,

observation cars, and wizzcned conductors.
Rumbling through tunnels and over 31 tres
tles, the trains follow a lengthy stretch of the
Noyo river in course of their two round-trips
daily to Northspur, the half-way point in the
line. Passengers may stop at Northspur to await
the returning train and enjoy the cafe under the
redwoods. Or they may choose to spend a whole
day watching the redwoods between Fort Bragg
and Willits sweep past the open observation
car.
From Fort Bragg, the Skunk travels along
Pudding Creek, through the first tunnel and
along the Noyo. The trip to Northspur takes
about one hour.
From Willits, a 1700 climb into the rolling
hills immediately confronts the train. The track
descends from this summit down to apple
groves, wildflowers, cattle, and finally into the

deep forest groves surrounding Northspur.
Itineraries from Fort Bragg to Willits, Willits
to Fort Bragg, or from either end of the line to
Northspur and back can all be accomodated.
RIDGE VINEYARDS
Location: Saratoga, CA;about
one hour from Stanford
Cost: Free plus wine-tasting
By Heather Millar
Americans tend to idealize the farm with im
ages of "amber waves of grain." Yet only a
small percentage of the country's population
now lives in rural area. Few take part in the har
vest which appears miraculously on the nation's
supermarket shelves. But at Ridge Vineyards in
Saratoga, urban involvement in the harvest is a
tradition.
Ridge Vineyards, described by one owner as
a "big-small winery" with an output of about
30,000 cases a year, annually invites volunteers
.to Qorne help pick grapes.
Picking is a vefy, very special time," said
Sue Crane, one of Ridge's owners. "It's the
whole winemaking process in a capsule. It starts
with the grapes."
The volunteer grape-picking tradition started
more than twenty years ago when three SRI en
gineers, their families, and a bachelor bought
the acres on Montebello Ridge because, accord

ing to Crane, "it was a beautiful piece of land
and we wanted to make a small amount of wine
for ourselves." What used to be necessity has
become a tradition.
Ridge Vineyards has grown to become a well
respected winery with the distinction of elevat
ing Zinfandel to the level of a premium wine.
Although this growth has made it necessary to
hire a staff and bring in migrant workers to pick
grapes during the work week, Ridge still invites
volunteers to help on Saturdays during the pick-»
ing.
The day begins about 8 o'clock in the morn
ing, when grape knives are distributed and
pickers shown what to pick and what not to
pick. The amateurs pick from about 9 o'clock
until 1 o'clock and then convene to a picnic
lunch and a winetasting of older Ridge wines.
Only those over 21 can be served.
Wine has recently captured the American
taste, chardonnay replacing beer in popularity
and the wine cooler the martini. The word of
Ridge's tradition has now spread so wide that
although the picking used to open to all comers,
past volunteer pickers are now notified by a
"picking letter" and reservations must be made
in advance (phone 408-867-3233).
Picking starts "when the grapes are ready,"
usually in late September or in October and
goes on for about three weeks, says Crane.
Since that period spans only three Saturdays,
available spaces fill quickly. Between 200 and
300 people show up every harvest Saturday and
in the last few years Ridge has had to keep a
waiting list.
"We teach people how to pick; it's gotten
pretty formal" Crane said, remembering the
days when all the families would go out to har
vest and crush the grapes. "Sometimes I think
we should just bring in field workers and get the
whole thing overwith, but then I realize that this
is the thing relationships are made of..

SAN SIMEON
Location: San Simeon, CA,
about four hours from Stanford
Cost: $7 per tour

Imagine living in a castle with 38 bedrooms,
31 bathrooms, a movie theater, a refectory (din
ing hall) and two immense swimming pools.
Named La Cuesta Fncantada, The Enchanted
Hill, just such an estate sprawls over 123 acres
near the little town of San Simeon. Opulently
set against the Santa Lucia Mountains on a
coastal knoll overlooking the sea, the 137-foot
high mansion is surrounded by gardens, ter
races, pools and palatial guest houses.
Before 1958, the fabled mansion was ac
cessible only to friends and guests of William
Randolph Hearst, publishing magnate and
owner of the San Francisco Chronicle. Begun in
1922 to be the permanent residence of the
Hearst family, the castle was still unfinished at
the time of Hearst's death in 1951. It remains
uncompleted although this is hard to believe
when confronted with the profusion of statuary
and paintings that adorn the rooms of the four
mansions that make up the complex.
Seven years after Hearst's death, the Hearst
Corporation presented the castle to the state of
California with the understanding that it be pre
served as a memorial to Hearst and his mother.
Four different tours of the San Simeon estate
are available. Each two-hour tour covers a dif
ferent portion of the castle. More than one tour
may be taken in one day.
Tours are $8 each for adults and $4 for chil
dren. No student discounts are offered.
Advance reservations may be made through
Ticketron at 393-6914. For more specific in
formation, call the Hearst Castle at
(805)927-4621.
To drive to the castle, take Highway 1 (205
miles from San Francisco) or Highway 101 (245
miles from San Francisco) south. Although
Highway 1 is a scenic route which might take
about five hours, it is worth the detour along
tortuous roads to pass Carmel, Monterey, and
Big Sur.
Estimated driving time from Monterey to
San Simeon is three hours.

MOUNTAIN PLAY
Location: Top of Mount
Tamalpais, Marin County,
CA; about an hour and a half
drive from Stanford, shuttle
buses depart from Mill Valley
Cost: '83 prices not yet set 112 '82
prices $3 to $6.50

Marin County residents have a reputation for
doing things that are a little iconoclastic, a little
mellow and sinfully enjoyable. Of these, the
Mountain Play is one.
The site used for the plays descends with an
upper slope of Mount Tamalpais and curves
into a Greek style amphitheater. History buffs
claim that the site was once the scene of Indian
religious rites, because the shape of the site is
either a freak of nature or a work of man.
From the upper reaches of the outdoor theater a
hint of the San Francisco skyline can be seen
over the redwoods. Grass lines each level or row
of "seats;" and wildflowers poke through the
cracks. Each May, spectators spread blankets
on the grass for a different play.
The Mountain Play is one of the traditional
events in Marin County. It was first held in 1913
on land that then belonged to William Kent
when Kent owned most of the land on Mount
Tarn. When Kent died in 1928, he left the
Mountain Theater to the Mountain Play As
sociation which later had the stone levels in
stalled by the Civilian Conservation Corps.
HANDEL SING
Location: Louise M. Davies
Symphony Hall, San Francis
co, CA
Cost: not yet determined

For infusing good old Yuletide cheer, the An
nual Sing-lt-Yourself-Messiah sponsored by
the San Francisco Conservatory of Music,
would be hard to beat.
Conducting sing-alongs of the massive musi
cal work which Handel scrawled in only 24 days
is not an original idea. Groups throughout Eng

land have been gathering for years to sing this
composer's most popular choral work. But the
Conservatory of Music has created a unique
tradition by televising the event live from Lou
ise M. Davies Symphony Hall.
The over 3000 tickets available each year sell
out about as fast as you can say "Deck the Halls
with Boughs of Holly." Two hours after tickets
went on sale in 1980, they were gone. The event
is beginning to attract a cult following of Bay
Area choral enthusiasts such as the Con
servatory Singers and the San Francisco Gay
Men's Chorus. But everyone, regardless of vo
cal persuasion, is welcomed and expected to
join in.
Companies such as the Emporium and the
Transamerica Corporation usually contribute
to cost of renting the hall, and the ticket sales
have raised over $20,000 for the San Francisco
Conservatory Scholarship Fund in past years.
It has been said, but not verified, that the San
Francisco sing is the largest rendition of the
Handel hit — sending the famous chorus of
"Hallelujah!" booming out of Davies and echo
ing across the San Francisco Civic Center. Last
year the exultation grew so powerful that 14

Christmas trees on the stage shook.
The chorus is accompanied by the San Fran
cisco Conservatory Orchestra and is conducted
by Louis Magor, director of the San Francisco
Symphony Chorus.
Hallelujah!
MUD BATHS
Location: Calistoga, CA;
about two hours from Stanford
Cost: Varies with treatment, up
to $31

Hot, mucky mud may not conjure up dec
adent luxury. But mudbaths are popular among
students — and they are available three hours
away in the Napa Valley town of Calistoga.
So if hot tubs and saunas have become old
hat, try mudbaths. Calistoga isone of only a few
mudbath capitals in the world, housing four
mudbath centers. Dr. Wilkinson's, the most
well-known and posh mudbath center, offers a
full treatment for $31. The mudbath center has
been shown on several television feature pro
grams, including Evening Magazine on San
Francisco's Channel 5
The mud in Calistoga — and in a few places
back east and in the desert — is special because
it is mixed with mineral water from local hot
springs. The fine-grained mud, like lava, is
black and somewhat gritty. It smells vaguely
sulfurous because of its mineral content.
Allegedly, the baths have a unique ability to
eliminate toxins from the human system. The
relaxing hot mud process cleanses the body by

opening pores, providing a drawing action that
saunas and hot tubs do not.
Mudbather Dave Bassett described the proc
ess as "a very gradual warming of the body."
Graduate Karen Halbo, another mudbather,
said, "It's like being in very warm water, but
you feel it more. . .you're supported."
The mud goes up to the shoulders, enabling
bathers to sip water through a straw.
A full treatment includes a mud bath, an indi
vidual mineral water whirlpool tub, a steamroll
and blanket rub, and a half-hour full body
massage. The entire process takes about two
hours and 15 minutes. "It's fun, it's great, it's
good for your health, it's competelv relaxing."
said one mudbather.
"It's a great way to go pamper yourself," said
Halbo.
Although the weather and the world's vaca
tion schedule have made March to October the
official mudbath season. Dr. Wilkinson's is
open every day of the year (except Christmas
and New Year's Day).
GOLD PANNING
Location: the Mother Lode in
the foothills of the Sierra Ne
vada, an average of four hours
away from Stanford
Cost: varies with area and pro
gram from $5 to over $50

I remember panning gold for the first time:
I squatted about knee deep in a stream running
out of the Sierra foothills, letting silt and sand

swirl through, and out of, my gold pan ... a
glint, a small nuggget, a glint, a flake. What I
gleaned from the stream that day was hardly
enough to buy a carton of milk, hut the thrill of
the glint-a-nugget-glint-a-flake process out
weighed the scantiness of my find.
No one organized park or facility exists for
those wanting to relive the days of the '49ers.
Perhaps it is this lack of organization that
makes panning gold in the Mother Lode so en
joyable. It leaves some of the adventure in the
bargain. Any stretch of stream or river is open
game, provided it is not already claimed.
Often the existence of a claim is hard to de
termine. especially on well-worked streams
such as the American River. Caution is war
ranted if you're out exploring on your own.
Prospectors are very possessive of their
claims. If you're set on exploring on your own,
the best approach is to look up the local sport
ing goods store in town — most of them also
carry prospecting equipment — and ask for ad
vice. The store owner probably has a claim of
his own and would be glad to help out.
Of course, most campgrounds in the Sierra
foothills rent gold panning equipment and les
sons. There are organized gold-seeking river
raft trips. Some prospectors rent out their
claims. Others make a business oTletting people
come up to their claim and watch a gold dredge
in action and perhaps pan a little.
The most important thing to remember
about prospecting for a weekend is that the
search is the challenge. You'll probably find
some gold, a glint, but it won't rival the dis
covery at Sutter's Mill in 1840's which got this
whole business started. You'll be lucky to get a
carton of milk out of the deal.

SOL VANG
Location: Solvang, CA; 45
miles north of Santa Barbara
Cost: Varies

Set against the blue Southern California sky
of the Santa Ynez Valley 45 miles north of San
ta Barbara, the thatched roofs of Solvang recre
ate a page out of Hans Christian Anderson.
Though far from being exclusively Danish,
Solvang is laid out like a 19th century Danish
village. Windmills turn lazily in the bree/.e.
Plaster and timber houses with gables and

steeply pitched roofs and Copenhagen gas
lights line the streets. Storks guard the chim
neys Aromas from the town's famous bakeries
which produce breads and pastries from cen
tury-old recipes filter into where visitors and
residents — many of them speaking Danish —
stroll.
Three Danish-horn educators and clergymen
founded Solvang seventy years ago, intending
to use the town as a site for a folk school pat
terned after the Danish College of Grand View
in Des Moines. Atterdag College opened its
doors to students in 1914.
The early settlers were almost exclusively
D;inish-born or of Danish extraction and fol
lowed such trades as farming and carpentry.
Solvang soon became the economic center of
the Santa Yne/ Valley and native Americans
began to settle there. But the Scandinavian trad
ition has been reinforced by a steady influx of
first-generation Danes. Danish is taught in the
schools and most families attend the Danish ru
ral-styled Bethania Lutheran Church.
The annual "Danish Days" festival, usually
held the third weekend in September, accents
the town's heritage. Groups of traditional
singers and dancers rove the streets; and the Vil
lage Band plays atop the Carlsberg beer wagon.
Villagers dressed in Danish costumes, serve an
aebleskiver breakfast on the streets.
During the summer, a company of 200, the
Solvang Theatrefest, performs seven open-air
productions in rotating repertory. Construc
tion of an indoor theatre will be finished some
time this year, and plays will then be offered
year-round.
Other notable Solvang festivals include the
July 4th and Christmas parades.
CALA VERAS JUMP
ING FROG JUBILEE
Location: Angel's Camp,
Calaveras County in the Moth
er Lode; CA about three hours
from Stanford
Cost: travel, $3 entry fee for
your frog, $5-$6 admission to
the Fair
Samuel Clemens has been blamed for the
whole craziness held annually during the third
week of May: the Cala'eras Jumping Frog
Jubilee.
After a trip to the Mother Lode in the days
when '49ers kept the area a wild country,
Clemens heard a tale of a man named Jim
Smiley, a jumping frog named "Dan'l Webster"
and some Bowery Boys from New York. He re
turned to his cabin and wrote "The Celebrated
Jumping Frog of Calaveras County," a short
story which firmly established him as a humor
ist under the pen name of Mark Twain.
This was all the fable of Mark Twain until the
citizens of Calaveras County reenacted the first
frog jump to celebrate the paving of the Angel's

Camp streets in 1928. There were 51 frogs en
tered that first day; S(XX) people attended.
The frog jumping contest has since grown to
he full-scale extravaganza with a fair atten
dance of over 50.000. Frogs from South Ameri
ca. England, Germany. Australia and Canada
enter. Many preliminary contests around the
world qualify frogs to participate at the interna
tional championships in Angel's Camp. "E.
Davy Croakett," who jumped 20 feet, three in
ches now holds the world record for the longest
leap.
Frogs are best caught at night by momentari
ly blinding them with a flashlight. Frogs may
also be rented at Angel's Camp.

BALLOONING
Location: Napa, CA; two hours
from Stanford
Cost: $95 per person for one
hour
By Heather Millar
Californians get into some pretty weird and
extravagant things. Of this genre, taking a
champagne flight over the Napa Valley at misty
dawn has to be the ultimate California ex
perience.
Balloon Aviation of Napa Valley flies cham
pagne balloon flights over the heart of the Napa
Valley seven days a week. Each flight is led by
an FAA certified pilot and two ground crew,
but guests are invited to help with the inflation
of the balloon. The balloon pilots can also make
an entry in a passenger's log book, if desired.
The flight itself takes about one hour and is
followed by a lavish champagne brunch.
Plenty of time remains for visitors to tour the
wineries of Napa Valley or the Calistoga hot
springs.
BERKELEY
Location: east 112 across the Bay;
about one hour from Stanford
Cost: Varies
By Jane Bailie
"There's no where like Berzerkeley!" stu
dents of the University of California at Berkeley
laughingly exclaim as they weave their way
down Telegraph Avenue, many of them seem
ingl\ oblivious to their surroundings, treating
each new human "obstacle" as something to be
ignored rather than accosted.
The city of Berkeley has been known to at
tract some of the more eccentric personalities of
the local area. The shops and streets are painted
with a certain amount of "human color," some
of it psychedelic.
The "Red Man" can been seen virtually any
day parading around the streets of Berkeley,
dressed completely from head to foot in a vi
brant shade of scarlet, carrying on his back a
stuffed puppet the size of a small child.
"Crazy William" is rumored to have been a
philosophy graduate student who "went over
the edge." He painted his clothes and face with
dollar-size red polka dots and now camps out
on Telegraph making faces at people and gener
ally drawing attention to himself. "You have to
be normal to stand out" many freshmen are
told, and despite the large student population,
many often find this the case.
The city carries with it an atmosphere which
is probably unique throughout the country.
"It's very much the 'Live and let live' philosphy
here." explained one woman resident. "With
this kind of community, there's got to be some
sort of laissez-faire."
Telegraph Avenue presents the viewer with a
variety of impressons. One is immediately
struck by the diversity not only of the architec
ture fronting the street, but of the people who
frequent the street itself. Ever since the I%o's,
when students and police often clashed in riots
>nd anti-war demonstrations Berkeley has ac
quired the reputation as a city w here the "hippy
radicals" of his bygone period have been able to
retain those qualities which have made such a
mark on the last two decades in American pop
culture.
Berkeley is often still considered a mecca for
political demonstrators and activists. Few
causes seem to go noticed. Supporters of ev
erything from the nuclear freeze to sailing
classes establish themselves in Sproul Plaza, a
focal point of the UC campus. During the late
morning and early afternoon, it is difficult to
cross this stretch of pavement without being
asked to sign any number of political petitons
or join a variety of activist groups.
Though ni'nn >112 •' ■ -h 'he area mav
students tend to p oe'uist; tactics" to
ward off the more adament of these represent
ative demonstrators. Clutching textbooks and

note pads, students can be seen with heads bent
and eyes focused firmly on the ground in front
of them as they quickly stride through crowd of
activists proffering petitions.
The majority of those persons often con
sidered "unusual" are in reality harmless, pro
vided they are not provoked. "Whatever you do
or see, avoid eye contact!" is the often repeated

line of advice given to those unfamiliar with the
area.
With its seemingly unending stream of street
vendors, whose merchandise ranges from Indi
an jewelry to tie-dyed clothing, the northern

section of Telegraph Avenue may give the ap
pearance of being a shopping mall rather than a
city street. Combined with the already static at
mosphere which seems to pervade much of the
area surrounding the UC Berkeley campus this
extremely heterogeneous mixture of humanity
can, to say the least, be overwhelming.
Berkeley is a place alive with a unique life
style and culture all its own, which can be stimu
lating ... if one takes it all with an open mind
and a sense of adventure.
WHALE WATCHING
Location: The coastal waters
from Baja California to the
Bering Sea
Cost: Varies depending on the
boat company and the length of
the trip, anywhere from $8 to
$35
•: t ,t j- rhe ''Vtst.il waters fro*n Baja
(. alifornia to the Bering Sea are filled *uh ceta
cean traffic as the Grey Whale make their an
cestral migration ... an event that spurs na

ture Tans to take to their boats to get an up-close
look at the great mammals who have made such
a phenomenal comeback.
In the last century, the Grey fell prey to the
Captain Ahabs of the Yankee whaling fleet.
The number of these animals fell from about
30,000 to near extinction. In 1895, they became
protected by law and have since rebounded to a

population close to 15.000.
After four months of feeding in the North Pa
cific. the herds migrate almost 6000 miles, led
by the pregnant females, to Scammon's Lagoon
in Baja, California. In the warm lagoons of

Baja, the fetnales calve and the calves stay with
the mother until the following.
Seeing a whale breach just yards away is a
breathtaking sight, but it's also possible that
you could go out for three hours and see noth
ing but seagulls.
Several boating companies regularly charter
trips to watch the whales: Marin Adventures, at
the College of Marin in Kentfield; the Oceanic
Society Whale Watch in San Francisco; and
Pillar Point Fishing Trips in Half Moon Bay.
If you have access to a boat, and want to go
out on your own, be aware that a federal law
posts a $10,000 fine if you come closer than 100
yards of a whale.
PARACHUTING
Location:Antioch, CA; about

Cost: For groups of one to three
$85 each, larger groups as low
as $70 each
B> Heather Millar
1 placed my fool in the door. "Are you
ready?," he asked.
It was windy outside. A chill shot down my
spine. Could I finally find the courage to do it
this time? "I guess there's no way out," I re
plied.
"Nope," he replied. "The point is coming
up," and with a slap on the back, "GO!"
The rest of my body followed my foot out the
door into the emptiness below. Time seemed to
ripple and slow — nothing registered but the
disbelief that I had done it. I had jumped out the
door of an airplane! Three thousand feet of air
separated me and the ground.
Four seconds — was it minutes? — passed.
As the "static line" went taut, the parachute au
tomatically deployed with a gentle tug, billow
ing out into a light green jellyfish with tentacles,
or shroud lines, reaching down to my harness.
The view from 2500 feet spread the whole Bay
Area at my feet. The sun set into the fog,
silhouetting the live oaks on Mt. Diablo.
Never since have I felt more full of life ... or
more terrified.
The Antioch Parachute Center had done ev
erything possible to prepare me to react to any
situation that might arise on a first jump. Dur
ing Antioch's first jump course, which is akin
my vision of Marine boot camp, I had drilled: I
had gone through simulated jumps; I had
jumped off platforms; I had sweated; I had been
lectured to; I had practiced hopping out of an
aircraft on the ground.
When I strode out onto the tarmac outfitted
in a jump suit and parachute, I was sure, in
tellectually at least, that I was prepared for any
emergency. Emotionally, I felt like a sacrificial
lamb, trussed up for the cost of an first jump

course.
Walking back to the tarmac from my first
jump, it all seemed worth it. As Perry Stevens,
the center's owner, said in his lecture to my first
jump class, "Parachuting is the most fun you
can have with your clothes on!"
SKUNK TRAIN
Location: Central Terminal in
Fort Bragg, CA; four hours
from Stanford
Cost: $8.50 to $12.00 depend
ing on the route
By Heather Millar
Promontory point; great train robberies; the
Atchitson, Topeka and the Santa Fe — the 19th
century locomotive has captured the American
imagination. The Skunk Train line engines hark
back to the days when trains were trains,
robbers were robbers, redwoods stood tall and
the frontier was wild.
Originally a 40-mile long logging railroad
lugging great redwoods to Georgia-Pacific mills
in Fort Bragg, the Skunk line offered steam pas
senger service for about a decade until the self
powered Skunk trains were introduced in 1925.
The yellow one-car trains were named for their
original gas engines. As folks used to say, "You
can smell 'em before you see 'em."
In addition to the Skunks, which service
redwood communities inaccessable by road, the
line also runs two vintage logging "Super-
Skunk" locomotives complete with wood seats,

observation cars, and wizzcned conductors.
Rumbling through tunnels and over 31 tres
tles, the trains follow a lengthy stretch of the
Noyo river in course of their two round-trips
daily to Northspur, the half-way point in the
line. Passengers may stop at Northspur to await
the returning train and enjoy the cafe under the
redwoods. Or they may choose to spend a whole
day watching the redwoods between Fort Bragg
and Willits sweep past the open observation
car.
From Fort Bragg, the Skunk travels along
Pudding Creek, through the first tunnel and
along the Noyo. The trip to Northspur takes
about one hour.
From Willits, a 1700 climb into the rolling
hills immediately confronts the train. The track
descends from this summit down to apple
groves, wildflowers, cattle, and finally into the

deep forest groves surrounding Northspur.
Itineraries from Fort Bragg to Willits, Willits
to Fort Bragg, or from either end of the line to
Northspur and back can all be accomodated.
RIDGE VINEYARDS
Location: Saratoga, CA;about
one hour from Stanford
Cost: Free plus wine-tasting
By Heather Millar
Americans tend to idealize the farm with im
ages of "amber waves of grain." Yet only a
small percentage of the country's population
now lives in rural area. Few take part in the har
vest which appears miraculously on the nation's
supermarket shelves. But at Ridge Vineyards in
Saratoga, urban involvement in the harvest is a
tradition.
Ridge Vineyards, described by one owner as
a "big-small winery" with an output of about
30,000 cases a year, annually invites volunteers
.to Qorne help pick grapes.
Picking is a vefy, very special time," said
Sue Crane, one of Ridge's owners. "It's the
whole winemaking process in a capsule. It starts
with the grapes."
The volunteer grape-picking tradition started
more than twenty years ago when three SRI en
gineers, their families, and a bachelor bought
the acres on Montebello Ridge because, accord

ing to Crane, "it was a beautiful piece of land
and we wanted to make a small amount of wine
for ourselves." What used to be necessity has
become a tradition.
Ridge Vineyards has grown to become a well
respected winery with the distinction of elevat
ing Zinfandel to the level of a premium wine.
Although this growth has made it necessary to
hire a staff and bring in migrant workers to pick
grapes during the work week, Ridge still invites
volunteers to help on Saturdays during the pick-»
ing.
The day begins about 8 o'clock in the morn
ing, when grape knives are distributed and
pickers shown what to pick and what not to
pick. The amateurs pick from about 9 o'clock
until 1 o'clock and then convene to a picnic
lunch and a winetasting of older Ridge wines.
Only those over 21 can be served.
Wine has recently captured the American
taste, chardonnay replacing beer in popularity
and the wine cooler the martini. The word of
Ridge's tradition has now spread so wide that
although the picking used to open to all comers,
past volunteer pickers are now notified by a
"picking letter" and reservations must be made
in advance (phone 408-867-3233).
Picking starts "when the grapes are ready,"
usually in late September or in October and
goes on for about three weeks, says Crane.
Since that period spans only three Saturdays,
available spaces fill quickly. Between 200 and
300 people show up every harvest Saturday and
in the last few years Ridge has had to keep a
waiting list.
"We teach people how to pick; it's gotten
pretty formal" Crane said, remembering the
days when all the families would go out to har
vest and crush the grapes. "Sometimes I think
we should just bring in field workers and get the
whole thing overwith, but then I realize that this
is the thing relationships are made of..

SAN SIMEON
Location: San Simeon, CA,
about four hours from Stanford
Cost: $7 per tour

Imagine living in a castle with 38 bedrooms,
31 bathrooms, a movie theater, a refectory (din
ing hall) and two immense swimming pools.
Named La Cuesta Fncantada, The Enchanted
Hill, just such an estate sprawls over 123 acres
near the little town of San Simeon. Opulently
set against the Santa Lucia Mountains on a
coastal knoll overlooking the sea, the 137-foot
high mansion is surrounded by gardens, ter
races, pools and palatial guest houses.
Before 1958, the fabled mansion was ac
cessible only to friends and guests of William
Randolph Hearst, publishing magnate and
owner of the San Francisco Chronicle. Begun in
1922 to be the permanent residence of the
Hearst family, the castle was still unfinished at
the time of Hearst's death in 1951. It remains
uncompleted although this is hard to believe
when confronted with the profusion of statuary
and paintings that adorn the rooms of the four
mansions that make up the complex.
Seven years after Hearst's death, the Hearst
Corporation presented the castle to the state of
California with the understanding that it be pre
served as a memorial to Hearst and his mother.
Four different tours of the San Simeon estate
are available. Each two-hour tour covers a dif
ferent portion of the castle. More than one tour
may be taken in one day.
Tours are $8 each for adults and $4 for chil
dren. No student discounts are offered.
Advance reservations may be made through
Ticketron at 393-6914. For more specific in
formation, call the Hearst Castle at
(805)927-4621.
To drive to the castle, take Highway 1 (205
miles from San Francisco) or Highway 101 (245
miles from San Francisco) south. Although
Highway 1 is a scenic route which might take
about five hours, it is worth the detour along
tortuous roads to pass Carmel, Monterey, and
Big Sur.
Estimated driving time from Monterey to
San Simeon is three hours.

MOUNTAIN PLAY
Location: Top of Mount
Tamalpais, Marin County,
CA; about an hour and a half
drive from Stanford, shuttle
buses depart from Mill Valley
Cost: '83 prices not yet set 112 '82
prices $3 to $6.50

Marin County residents have a reputation for
doing things that are a little iconoclastic, a little
mellow and sinfully enjoyable. Of these, the
Mountain Play is one.
The site used for the plays descends with an
upper slope of Mount Tamalpais and curves
into a Greek style amphitheater. History buffs
claim that the site was once the scene of Indian
religious rites, because the shape of the site is
either a freak of nature or a work of man.
From the upper reaches of the outdoor theater a
hint of the San Francisco skyline can be seen
over the redwoods. Grass lines each level or row
of "seats;" and wildflowers poke through the
cracks. Each May, spectators spread blankets
on the grass for a different play.
The Mountain Play is one of the traditional
events in Marin County. It was first held in 1913
on land that then belonged to William Kent
when Kent owned most of the land on Mount
Tarn. When Kent died in 1928, he left the
Mountain Theater to the Mountain Play As
sociation which later had the stone levels in
stalled by the Civilian Conservation Corps.

For infusing good old Yuletide cheer, the An
nual Sing-lt-Yourself-Messiah sponsored by
the San Francisco Conservatory of Music,
would be hard to beat.
Conducting sing-alongs of the massive musi
cal work which Handel scrawled in only 24 days
is not an original idea. Groups throughout Eng

land have been gathering for years to sing this
composer's most popular choral work. But the
Conservatory of Music has created a unique
tradition by televising the event live from Lou
ise M. Davies Symphony Hall.
The over 3000 tickets available each year sell
out about as fast as you can say "Deck the Halls
with Boughs of Holly." Two hours after tickets
went on sale in 1980, they were gone. The event
is beginning to attract a cult following of Bay
Area choral enthusiasts such as the Con
servatory Singers and the San Francisco Gay
Men's Chorus. But everyone, regardless of vo
cal persuasion, is welcomed and expected to
join in.
Companies such as the Emporium and the
Transamerica Corporation usually contribute
to cost of renting the hall, and the ticket sales
have raised over $20,000 for the San Francisco
Conservatory Scholarship Fund in past years.
It has been said, but not verified, that the San
Francisco sing is the largest rendition of the
Handel hit — sending the famous chorus of
"Hallelujah!" booming out of Davies and echo
ing across the San Francisco Civic Center. Last
year the exultation grew so powerful that 14

Christmas trees on the stage shook.
The chorus is accompanied by the San Fran
cisco Conservatory Orchestra and is conducted
by Louis Magor, director of the San Francisco
Symphony Chorus.
Hallelujah!
MUD BATHS
Location: Calistoga, CA;
about two hours from Stanford
Cost: Varies with treatment, up
to $31

Hot, mucky mud may not conjure up dec
adent luxury. But mudbaths are popular among
students — and they are available three hours
away in the Napa Valley town of Calistoga.
So if hot tubs and saunas have become old
hat, try mudbaths. Calistoga isone of only a few
mudbath capitals in the world, housing four
mudbath centers. Dr. Wilkinson's, the most
well-known and posh mudbath center, offers a
full treatment for $31. The mudbath center has
been shown on several television feature pro
grams, including Evening Magazine on San
Francisco's Channel 5
The mud in Calistoga — and in a few places
back east and in the desert — is special because
it is mixed with mineral water from local hot
springs. The fine-grained mud, like lava, is
black and somewhat gritty. It smells vaguely
sulfurous because of its mineral content.
Allegedly, the baths have a unique ability to
eliminate toxins from the human system. The
relaxing hot mud process cleanses the body by

opening pores, providing a drawing action that
saunas and hot tubs do not.
Mudbather Dave Bassett described the proc
ess as "a very gradual warming of the body."
Graduate Karen Halbo, another mudbather,
said, "It's like being in very warm water, but
you feel it more. . .you're supported."
The mud goes up to the shoulders, enabling
bathers to sip water through a straw.
A full treatment includes a mud bath, an indi
vidual mineral water whirlpool tub, a steamroll
and blanket rub, and a half-hour full body
massage. The entire process takes about two
hours and 15 minutes. "It's fun, it's great, it's
good for your health, it's competelv relaxing."
said one mudbather.
"It's a great way to go pamper yourself," said
Halbo.
Although the weather and the world's vaca
tion schedule have made March to October the
official mudbath season. Dr. Wilkinson's is
open every day of the year (except Christmas
and New Year's Day).
GOLD PANNING
Location: the Mother Lode in
the foothills of the Sierra Ne
vada, an average of four hours
away from Stanford
Cost: varies with area and pro
gram from $5 to over $50

I remember panning gold for the first time:
I squatted about knee deep in a stream running
out of the Sierra foothills, letting silt and sand

swirl through, and out of, my gold pan ... a
glint, a small nuggget, a glint, a flake. What I
gleaned from the stream that day was hardly
enough to buy a carton of milk, hut the thrill of
the glint-a-nugget-glint-a-flake process out
weighed the scantiness of my find.
No one organized park or facility exists for
those wanting to relive the days of the '49ers.
Perhaps it is this lack of organization that
makes panning gold in the Mother Lode so en
joyable. It leaves some of the adventure in the
bargain. Any stretch of stream or river is open
game, provided it is not already claimed.
Often the existence of a claim is hard to de
termine. especially on well-worked streams
such as the American River. Caution is war
ranted if you're out exploring on your own.
Prospectors are very possessive of their
claims. If you're set on exploring on your own,
the best approach is to look up the local sport
ing goods store in town — most of them also
carry prospecting equipment — and ask for ad
vice. The store owner probably has a claim of
his own and would be glad to help out.
Of course, most campgrounds in the Sierra
foothills rent gold panning equipment and les
sons. There are organized gold-seeking river
raft trips. Some prospectors rent out their
claims. Others make a business oTletting people
come up to their claim and watch a gold dredge
in action and perhaps pan a little.
The most important thing to remember
about prospecting for a weekend is that the
search is the challenge. You'll probably find
some gold, a glint, but it won't rival the dis
covery at Sutter's Mill in 1840's which got this
whole business started. You'll be lucky to get a
carton of milk out of the deal.

SOL VANG
Location: Solvang, CA; 45
miles north of Santa Barbara
Cost: Varies

Set against the blue Southern California sky
of the Santa Ynez Valley 45 miles north of San
ta Barbara, the thatched roofs of Solvang recre
ate a page out of Hans Christian Anderson.
Though far from being exclusively Danish,
Solvang is laid out like a 19th century Danish
village. Windmills turn lazily in the bree/.e.
Plaster and timber houses with gables and

steeply pitched roofs and Copenhagen gas
lights line the streets. Storks guard the chim
neys Aromas from the town's famous bakeries
which produce breads and pastries from cen
tury-old recipes filter into where visitors and
residents — many of them speaking Danish —
stroll.
Three Danish-horn educators and clergymen
founded Solvang seventy years ago, intending
to use the town as a site for a folk school pat
terned after the Danish College of Grand View
in Des Moines. Atterdag College opened its
doors to students in 1914.
The early settlers were almost exclusively
D;inish-born or of Danish extraction and fol
lowed such trades as farming and carpentry.
Solvang soon became the economic center of
the Santa Yne/ Valley and native Americans
began to settle there. But the Scandinavian trad
ition has been reinforced by a steady influx of
first-generation Danes. Danish is taught in the
schools and most families attend the Danish ru
ral-styled Bethania Lutheran Church.
The annual "Danish Days" festival, usually
held the third weekend in September, accents
the town's heritage. Groups of traditional
singers and dancers rove the streets; and the Vil
lage Band plays atop the Carlsberg beer wagon.
Villagers dressed in Danish costumes, serve an
aebleskiver breakfast on the streets.
During the summer, a company of 200, the
Solvang Theatrefest, performs seven open-air
productions in rotating repertory. Construc
tion of an indoor theatre will be finished some
time this year, and plays will then be offered
year-round.
Other notable Solvang festivals include the
July 4th and Christmas parades.
CALA VERAS JUMP
ING FROG JUBILEE
Location: Angel's Camp,
Calaveras County in the Moth
er Lode; CA about three hours
from Stanford
Cost: travel, $3 entry fee for
your frog, $5-$6 admission to
the Fair
Samuel Clemens has been blamed for the
whole craziness held annually during the third
week of May: the Cala'eras Jumping Frog
Jubilee.
After a trip to the Mother Lode in the days
when '49ers kept the area a wild country,
Clemens heard a tale of a man named Jim
Smiley, a jumping frog named "Dan'l Webster"
and some Bowery Boys from New York. He re
turned to his cabin and wrote "The Celebrated
Jumping Frog of Calaveras County," a short
story which firmly established him as a humor
ist under the pen name of Mark Twain.
This was all the fable of Mark Twain until the
citizens of Calaveras County reenacted the first
frog jump to celebrate the paving of the Angel's

Camp streets in 1928. There were 51 frogs en
tered that first day; S(XX) people attended.
The frog jumping contest has since grown to
he full-scale extravaganza with a fair atten
dance of over 50.000. Frogs from South Ameri
ca. England, Germany. Australia and Canada
enter. Many preliminary contests around the
world qualify frogs to participate at the interna
tional championships in Angel's Camp. "E.
Davy Croakett," who jumped 20 feet, three in
ches now holds the world record for the longest
leap.
Frogs are best caught at night by momentari
ly blinding them with a flashlight. Frogs may
also be rented at Angel's Camp.

BALLOONING
Location: Napa, CA; two hours
from Stanford
Cost: $95 per person for one
hour
By Heather Millar
Californians get into some pretty weird and
extravagant things. Of this genre, taking a
champagne flight over the Napa Valley at misty
dawn has to be the ultimate California ex
perience.
Balloon Aviation of Napa Valley flies cham
pagne balloon flights over the heart of the Napa
Valley seven days a week. Each flight is led by
an FAA certified pilot and two ground crew,
but guests are invited to help with the inflation
of the balloon. The balloon pilots can also make
an entry in a passenger's log book, if desired.
The flight itself takes about one hour and is
followed by a lavish champagne brunch.
Plenty of time remains for visitors to tour the
wineries of Napa Valley or the Calistoga hot
springs.
BERKELEY
Location: east 112 across the Bay;
about one hour from Stanford
Cost: Varies
By Jane Bailie
"There's no where like Berzerkeley!" stu
dents of the University of California at Berkeley
laughingly exclaim as they weave their way
down Telegraph Avenue, many of them seem
ingl\ oblivious to their surroundings, treating
each new human "obstacle" as something to be
ignored rather than accosted.
The city of Berkeley has been known to at
tract some of the more eccentric personalities of
the local area. The shops and streets are painted
with a certain amount of "human color," some
of it psychedelic.
The "Red Man" can been seen virtually any
day parading around the streets of Berkeley,
dressed completely from head to foot in a vi
brant shade of scarlet, carrying on his back a
stuffed puppet the size of a small child.
"Crazy William" is rumored to have been a
philosophy graduate student who "went over
the edge." He painted his clothes and face with
dollar-size red polka dots and now camps out
on Telegraph making faces at people and gener
ally drawing attention to himself. "You have to
be normal to stand out" many freshmen are
told, and despite the large student population,
many often find this the case.
The city carries with it an atmosphere which
is probably unique throughout the country.
"It's very much the 'Live and let live' philosphy
here." explained one woman resident. "With
this kind of community, there's got to be some
sort of laissez-faire."
Telegraph Avenue presents the viewer with a
variety of impressons. One is immediately
struck by the diversity not only of the architec
ture fronting the street, but of the people who
frequent the street itself. Ever since the I%o's,
when students and police often clashed in riots
>nd anti-war demonstrations Berkeley has ac
quired the reputation as a city w here the "hippy
radicals" of his bygone period have been able to
retain those qualities which have made such a
mark on the last two decades in American pop
culture.
Berkeley is often still considered a mecca for
political demonstrators and activists. Few
causes seem to go noticed. Supporters of ev
erything from the nuclear freeze to sailing
classes establish themselves in Sproul Plaza, a
focal point of the UC campus. During the late
morning and early afternoon, it is difficult to
cross this stretch of pavement without being
asked to sign any number of political petitons
or join a variety of activist groups.
Though ni'nn >112 •' ■ -h 'he area mav
students tend to p oe'uist; tactics" to
ward off the more adament of these represent
ative demonstrators. Clutching textbooks and

note pads, students can be seen with heads bent
and eyes focused firmly on the ground in front
of them as they quickly stride through crowd of
activists proffering petitions.
The majority of those persons often con
sidered "unusual" are in reality harmless, pro
vided they are not provoked. "Whatever you do
or see, avoid eye contact!" is the often repeated

line of advice given to those unfamiliar with the
area.
With its seemingly unending stream of street
vendors, whose merchandise ranges from Indi
an jewelry to tie-dyed clothing, the northern

section of Telegraph Avenue may give the ap
pearance of being a shopping mall rather than a
city street. Combined with the already static at
mosphere which seems to pervade much of the
area surrounding the UC Berkeley campus this
extremely heterogeneous mixture of humanity
can, to say the least, be overwhelming.
Berkeley is a place alive with a unique life
style and culture all its own, which can be stimu
lating ... if one takes it all with an open mind
and a sense of adventure.
WHALE WATCHING
Location: The coastal waters
from Baja California to the
Bering Sea
Cost: Varies depending on the
boat company and the length of
the trip, anywhere from $8 to
$35
•: t ,t j- rhe ''Vtst.il waters fro*n Baja
(. alifornia to the Bering Sea are filled *uh ceta
cean traffic as the Grey Whale make their an
cestral migration ... an event that spurs na

ture Tans to take to their boats to get an up-close
look at the great mammals who have made such
a phenomenal comeback.
In the last century, the Grey fell prey to the
Captain Ahabs of the Yankee whaling fleet.
The number of these animals fell from about
30,000 to near extinction. In 1895, they became
protected by law and have since rebounded to a

population close to 15.000.
After four months of feeding in the North Pa
cific. the herds migrate almost 6000 miles, led
by the pregnant females, to Scammon's Lagoon
in Baja, California. In the warm lagoons of

Baja, the fetnales calve and the calves stay with
the mother until the following.
Seeing a whale breach just yards away is a
breathtaking sight, but it's also possible that
you could go out for three hours and see noth
ing but seagulls.
Several boating companies regularly charter
trips to watch the whales: Marin Adventures, at
the College of Marin in Kentfield; the Oceanic
Society Whale Watch in San Francisco; and
Pillar Point Fishing Trips in Half Moon Bay.
If you have access to a boat, and want to go
out on your own, be aware that a federal law
posts a $10,000 fine if you come closer than 100
yards of a whale.
PARACHUTING
Location:Antioch, CA; about

Cost: For groups of one to three
$85 each, larger groups as low
as $70 each
B> Heather Millar
1 placed my fool in the door. "Are you
ready?," he asked.
It was windy outside. A chill shot down my
spine. Could I finally find the courage to do it
this time? "I guess there's no way out," I re
plied.
"Nope," he replied. "The point is coming
up," and with a slap on the back, "GO!"
The rest of my body followed my foot out the
door into the emptiness below. Time seemed to
ripple and slow — nothing registered but the
disbelief that I had done it. I had jumped out the
door of an airplane! Three thousand feet of air
separated me and the ground.
Four seconds — was it minutes? — passed.
As the "static line" went taut, the parachute au
tomatically deployed with a gentle tug, billow
ing out into a light green jellyfish with tentacles,
or shroud lines, reaching down to my harness.
The view from 2500 feet spread the whole Bay
Area at my feet. The sun set into the fog,
silhouetting the live oaks on Mt. Diablo.
Never since have I felt more full of life ... or
more terrified.
The Antioch Parachute Center had done ev
erything possible to prepare me to react to any
situation that might arise on a first jump. Dur
ing Antioch's first jump course, which is akin
my vision of Marine boot camp, I had drilled: I
had gone through simulated jumps; I had
jumped off platforms; I had sweated; I had been
lectured to; I had practiced hopping out of an
aircraft on the ground.
When I strode out onto the tarmac outfitted
in a jump suit and parachute, I was sure, in
tellectually at least, that I was prepared for any
emergency. Emotionally, I felt like a sacrificial
lamb, trussed up for the cost of an first jump

course.
Walking back to the tarmac from my first
jump, it all seemed worth it. As Perry Stevens,
the center's owner, said in his lecture to my first
jump class, "Parachuting is the most fun you
can have with your clothes on!"
SKUNK TRAIN
Location: Central Terminal in
Fort Bragg, CA; four hours
from Stanford
Cost: $8.50 to $12.00 depend
ing on the route
By Heather Millar
Promontory point; great train robberies; the
Atchitson, Topeka and the Santa Fe — the 19th
century locomotive has captured the American
imagination. The Skunk Train line engines hark
back to the days when trains were trains,
robbers were robbers, redwoods stood tall and
the frontier was wild.
Originally a 40-mile long logging railroad
lugging great redwoods to Georgia-Pacific mills
in Fort Bragg, the Skunk line offered steam pas
senger service for about a decade until the self
powered Skunk trains were introduced in 1925.
The yellow one-car trains were named for their
original gas engines. As folks used to say, "You
can smell 'em before you see 'em."
In addition to the Skunks, which service
redwood communities inaccessable by road, the
line also runs two vintage logging "Super-
Skunk" locomotives complete with wood seats,

observation cars, and wizzcned conductors.
Rumbling through tunnels and over 31 tres
tles, the trains follow a lengthy stretch of the
Noyo river in course of their two round-trips
daily to Northspur, the half-way point in the
line. Passengers may stop at Northspur to await
the returning train and enjoy the cafe under the
redwoods. Or they may choose to spend a whole
day watching the redwoods between Fort Bragg
and Willits sweep past the open observation
car.
From Fort Bragg, the Skunk travels along
Pudding Creek, through the first tunnel and
along the Noyo. The trip to Northspur takes
about one hour.
From Willits, a 1700 climb into the rolling
hills immediately confronts the train. The track
descends from this summit down to apple
groves, wildflowers, cattle, and finally into the

deep forest groves surrounding Northspur.
Itineraries from Fort Bragg to Willits, Willits
to Fort Bragg, or from either end of the line to
Northspur and back can all be accomodated.
RIDGE VINEYARDS
Location: Saratoga, CA;about
one hour from Stanford
Cost: Free plus wine-tasting
By Heather Millar
Americans tend to idealize the farm with im
ages of "amber waves of grain." Yet only a
small percentage of the country's population
now lives in rural area. Few take part in the har
vest which appears miraculously on the nation's
supermarket shelves. But at Ridge Vineyards in
Saratoga, urban involvement in the harvest is a
tradition.
Ridge Vineyards, described by one owner as
a "big-small winery" with an output of about
30,000 cases a year, annually invites volunteers
.to Qorne help pick grapes.
Picking is a vefy, very special time," said
Sue Crane, one of Ridge's owners. "It's the
whole winemaking process in a capsule. It starts
with the grapes."
The volunteer grape-picking tradition started
more than twenty years ago when three SRI en
gineers, their families, and a bachelor bought
the acres on Montebello Ridge because, accord

ing to Crane, "it was a beautiful piece of land
and we wanted to make a small amount of wine
for ourselves." What used to be necessity has
become a tradition.
Ridge Vineyards has grown to become a well
respected winery with the distinction of elevat
ing Zinfandel to the level of a premium wine.
Although this growth has made it necessary to
hire a staff and bring in migrant workers to pick
grapes during the work week, Ridge still invites
volunteers to help on Saturdays during the pick-»
ing.
The day begins about 8 o'clock in the morn
ing, when grape knives are distributed and
pickers shown what to pick and what not to
pick. The amateurs pick from about 9 o'clock
until 1 o'clock and then convene to a picnic
lunch and a winetasting of older Ridge wines.
Only those over 21 can be served.
Wine has recently captured the American
taste, chardonnay replacing beer in popularity
and the wine cooler the martini. The word of
Ridge's tradition has now spread so wide that
although the picking used to open to all comers,
past volunteer pickers are now notified by a
"picking letter" and reservations must be made
in advance (phone 408-867-3233).
Picking starts "when the grapes are ready,"
usually in late September or in October and
goes on for about three weeks, says Crane.
Since that period spans only three Saturdays,
available spaces fill quickly. Between 200 and
300 people show up every harvest Saturday and
in the last few years Ridge has had to keep a
waiting list.
"We teach people how to pick; it's gotten
pretty formal" Crane said, remembering the
days when all the families would go out to har
vest and crush the grapes. "Sometimes I think
we should just bring in field workers and get the
whole thing overwith, but then I realize that this
is the thing relationships are made of..

SAN SIMEON
Location: San Simeon, CA,
about four hours from Stanford
Cost: $7 per tour

Imagine living in a castle with 38 bedrooms,
31 bathrooms, a movie theater, a refectory (din
ing hall) and two immense swimming pools.
Named La Cuesta Fncantada, The Enchanted
Hill, just such an estate sprawls over 123 acres
near the little town of San Simeon. Opulently
set against the Santa Lucia Mountains on a
coastal knoll overlooking the sea, the 137-foot
high mansion is surrounded by gardens, ter
races, pools and palatial guest houses.
Before 1958, the fabled mansion was ac
cessible only to friends and guests of William
Randolph Hearst, publishing magnate and
owner of the San Francisco Chronicle. Begun in
1922 to be the permanent residence of the
Hearst family, the castle was still unfinished at
the time of Hearst's death in 1951. It remains
uncompleted although this is hard to believe
when confronted with the profusion of statuary
and paintings that adorn the rooms of the four
mansions that make up the complex.
Seven years after Hearst's death, the Hearst
Corporation presented the castle to the state of
California with the understanding that it be pre
served as a memorial to Hearst and his mother.
Four different tours of the San Simeon estate
are available. Each two-hour tour covers a dif
ferent portion of the castle. More than one tour
may be taken in one day.
Tours are $8 each for adults and $4 for chil
dren. No student discounts are offered.
Advance reservations may be made through
Ticketron at 393-6914. For more specific in
formation, call the Hearst Castle at
(805)927-4621.
To drive to the castle, take Highway 1 (205
miles from San Francisco) or Highway 101 (245
miles from San Francisco) south. Although
Highway 1 is a scenic route which might take
about five hours, it is worth the detour along
tortuous roads to pass Carmel, Monterey, and
Big Sur.
Estimated driving time from Monterey to
San Simeon is three hours.

MOUNTAIN PLAY
Location: Top of Mount
Tamalpais, Marin County,
CA; about an hour and a half
drive from Stanford, shuttle
buses depart from Mill Valley
Cost: '83 prices not yet set 112 '82
prices $3 to $6.50

Marin County residents have a reputation for
doing things that are a little iconoclastic, a little
mellow and sinfully enjoyable. Of these, the
Mountain Play is one.
The site used for the plays descends with an
upper slope of Mount Tamalpais and curves
into a Greek style amphitheater. History buffs
claim that the site was once the scene of Indian
religious rites, because the shape of the site is
either a freak of nature or a work of man.
From the upper reaches of the outdoor theater a
hint of the San Francisco skyline can be seen
over the redwoods. Grass lines each level or row
of "seats;" and wildflowers poke through the
cracks. Each May, spectators spread blankets
on the grass for a different play.
The Mountain Play is one of the traditional
events in Marin County. It was first held in 1913
on land that then belonged to William Kent
when Kent owned most of the land on Mount
Tarn. When Kent died in 1928, he left the
Mountain Theater to the Mountain Play As
sociation which later had the stone levels in
stalled by the Civilian Conservation Corps.
HANDEL SING

Symphony Hall, San Francis
co, CA
Cost: not yet determined

For infusing good old Yuletide cheer, the An

Conducting sing-alongs of the massive musi

is not an original idea. Groups throughout Eng

land have been gathering for years to sing this
composer's most popular choral work. But the
Conservatory of Music has created a unique
tradition by televising the event live from Lou
ise M. Davies Symphony Hall.
The over 3000 tickets available each year sell
out about as fast as you can say "Deck the Halls
with Boughs of Holly." Two hours after tickets
went on sale in 1980, they were gone. The event
is beginning to attract a cult following of Bay
Area choral enthusiasts such as the Con
servatory Singers and the San Francisco Gay
Men's Chorus. But everyone, regardless of vo
cal persuasion, is welcomed and expected to
join in.
Companies such as the Emporium and the
Transamerica Corporation usually contribute
to cost of renting the hall, and the ticket sales
have raised over $20,000 for the San Francisco
Conservatory Scholarship Fund in past years.
It has been said, but not verified, that the San
Francisco sing is the largest rendition of the
Handel hit — sending the famous chorus of
"Hallelujah!" booming out of Davies and echo
ing across the San Francisco Civic Center. Last
year the exultation grew so powerful that 14

Christmas trees on the stage shook.
The chorus is accompanied by the San Fran

by Louis Magor, director of the San Francisco
Symphony Chorus.

MUD BATHS
Location: Calistoga, CA;

Cost: Varies with treatment, up
to $31

Hot, mucky mud may not conjure up dec
adent luxury. But mudbaths are popular among
students — and they are available three hours
away in the Napa Valley town of Calistoga.
So if hot tubs and saunas have become old
hat, try mudbaths. Calistoga isone of only a few
mudbath capitals in the world, housing four
mudbath centers. Dr. Wilkinson's, the most
well-known and posh mudbath center, offers a
full treatment for $31. The mudbath center has
been shown on several television feature pro
grams, including Evening Magazine on San
Francisco's Channel 5
The mud in Calistoga — and in a few places
back east and in the desert — is special because
it is mixed with mineral water from local hot

black and somewhat gritty. It smells vaguely
sulfurous because of its mineral content.
Allegedly, the baths have a unique ability to
eliminate toxins from the human system. The
relaxing hot mud process cleanses the body by

opening pores, providing a drawing action that

Graduate Karen Halbo, another mudbather,
said, "It's like being in very warm water, but
you feel it more. . .you're supported."
The mud goes up to the shoulders, enabling
bathers to sip water through a straw.
A full treatment includes a mud bath, an indi
vidual mineral water whirlpool tub, a steamroll
and blanket rub, and a half-hour full body
massage. The entire process takes about two
hours and 15 minutes. "It's fun, it's great, it's
good for your health, it's competelv relaxing."
said one mudbather.
"It's a great way to go pamper yourself," said
Halbo.
Although the weather and the world's vaca

official mudbath season. Dr. Wilkinson's is
open every day of the year (except Christmas
and New Year's Day).
GOLD PANNING
Location: the Mother Lode in

vada, an average of four hours
away from Stanford
Cost: varies with area and pro
gram from $5 to over $50

I remember panning gold for the first time:
I squatted about knee deep in a stream running
out of the Sierra foothills, letting silt and sand

swirl through, and out of, my gold pan ... a
glint, a small nuggget, a glint, a flake. What I
gleaned from the stream that day was hardly
enough to buy a carton of milk, hut the thrill of
the glint-a-nugget-glint-a-flake process out
weighed the scantiness of my find.
No one organized park or facility exists for
those wanting to relive the days of the '49ers.
Perhaps it is this lack of organization that
makes panning gold in the Mother Lode so en
joyable. It leaves some of the adventure in the
bargain. Any stretch of stream or river is open
game, provided it is not already claimed.
Often the existence of a claim is hard to de
termine. especially on well-worked streams
such as the American River. Caution is war
ranted if you're out exploring on your own.
Prospectors are very possessive of their
claims. If you're set on exploring on your own,
the best approach is to look up the local sport
ing goods store in town — most of them also
carry prospecting equipment — and ask for ad
vice. The store owner probably has a claim of
his own and would be glad to help out.
Of course, most campgrounds in the Sierra
foothills rent gold panning equipment and les
sons. There are organized gold-seeking river
raft trips. Some prospectors rent out their
claims. Others make a business oTletting people
come up to their claim and watch a gold dredge
in action and perhaps pan a little.
The most important thing to remember
about prospecting for a weekend is that the
search is the challenge. You'll probably find
some gold, a glint, but it won't rival the dis
covery at Sutter's Mill in 1840's which got this
whole business started. You'll be lucky to get a
carton of milk out of the deal.

SOL VANG
Location: Solvang, CA; 45
miles north of Santa Barbara
Cost: Varies

Set against the blue Southern California sky
of the Santa Ynez Valley 45 miles north of San
ta Barbara, the thatched roofs of Solvang recre
ate a page out of Hans Christian Anderson.
Though far from being exclusively Danish,
Solvang is laid out like a 19th century Danish
village. Windmills turn lazily in the bree/.e.
Plaster and timber houses with gables and

steeply pitched roofs and Copenhagen gas
lights line the streets. Storks guard the chim
neys Aromas from the town's famous bakeries
which produce breads and pastries from cen
tury-old recipes filter into where visitors and
residents — many of them speaking Danish —
stroll.
Three Danish-horn educators and clergymen
founded Solvang seventy years ago, intending
to use the town as a site for a folk school pat
terned after the Danish College of Grand View
in Des Moines. Atterdag College opened its
doors to students in 1914.
The early settlers were almost exclusively
D;inish-born or of Danish extraction and fol
lowed such trades as farming and carpentry.
Solvang soon became the economic center of
the Santa Yne/ Valley and native Americans
began to settle there. But the Scandinavian trad
ition has been reinforced by a steady influx of
first-generation Danes. Danish is taught in the
schools and most families attend the Danish ru
ral-styled Bethania Lutheran Church.
The annual "Danish Days" festival, usually
held the third weekend in September, accents
the town's heritage. Groups of traditional
singers and dancers rove the streets; and the Vil
lage Band plays atop the Carlsberg beer wagon.
Villagers dressed in Danish costumes, serve an
aebleskiver breakfast on the streets.
During the summer, a company of 200, the
Solvang Theatrefest, performs seven open-air
productions in rotating repertory. Construc
tion of an indoor theatre will be finished some
time this year, and plays will then be offered
year-round.
Other notable Solvang festivals include the
July 4th and Christmas parades.
CALA VERAS JUMP
ING FROG JUBILEE
Location: Angel's Camp,
Calaveras County in the Moth
er Lode; CA about three hours
from Stanford
Cost: travel, $3 entry fee for
your frog, $5-$6 admission to
the Fair
Samuel Clemens has been blamed for the
whole craziness held annually during the third
week of May: the Cala'eras Jumping Frog
Jubilee.
After a trip to the Mother Lode in the days
when '49ers kept the area a wild country,
Clemens heard a tale of a man named Jim
Smiley, a jumping frog named "Dan'l Webster"
and some Bowery Boys from New York. He re
turned to his cabin and wrote "The Celebrated
Jumping Frog of Calaveras County," a short
story which firmly established him as a humor
ist under the pen name of Mark Twain.
This was all the fable of Mark Twain until the
citizens of Calaveras County reenacted the first
frog jump to celebrate the paving of the Angel's

Camp streets in 1928. There were 51 frogs en
tered that first day; S(XX) people attended.
The frog jumping contest has since grown to
he full-scale extravaganza with a fair atten
dance of over 50.000. Frogs from South Ameri
ca. England, Germany. Australia and Canada
enter. Many preliminary contests around the
world qualify frogs to participate at the interna
tional championships in Angel's Camp. "E.
Davy Croakett," who jumped 20 feet, three in
ches now holds the world record for the longest
leap.
Frogs are best caught at night by momentari
ly blinding them with a flashlight. Frogs may
also be rented at Angel's Camp.

BALLOONING
Location: Napa, CA; two hours
from Stanford
Cost: $95 per person for one
hour
By Heather Millar
Californians get into some pretty weird and
extravagant things. Of this genre, taking a
champagne flight over the Napa Valley at misty
dawn has to be the ultimate California ex
perience.
Balloon Aviation of Napa Valley flies cham
pagne balloon flights over the heart of the Napa
Valley seven days a week. Each flight is led by
an FAA certified pilot and two ground crew,
but guests are invited to help with the inflation
of the balloon. The balloon pilots can also make
an entry in a passenger's log book, if desired.
The flight itself takes about one hour and is
followed by a lavish champagne brunch.
Plenty of time remains for visitors to tour the
wineries of Napa Valley or the Calistoga hot
springs.
BERKELEY
Location: east 112 across the Bay;
about one hour from Stanford
Cost: Varies
By Jane Bailie
"There's no where like Berzerkeley!" stu
dents of the University of California at Berkeley
laughingly exclaim as they weave their way
down Telegraph Avenue, many of them seem
ingl\ oblivious to their surroundings, treating
each new human "obstacle" as something to be
ignored rather than accosted.
The city of Berkeley has been known to at
tract some of the more eccentric personalities of
the local area. The shops and streets are painted
with a certain amount of "human color," some
of it psychedelic.
The "Red Man" can been seen virtually any
day parading around the streets of Berkeley,
dressed completely from head to foot in a vi
brant shade of scarlet, carrying on his back a
stuffed puppet the size of a small child.
"Crazy William" is rumored to have been a
philosophy graduate student who "went over
the edge." He painted his clothes and face with
dollar-size red polka dots and now camps out
on Telegraph making faces at people and gener
ally drawing attention to himself. "You have to
be normal to stand out" many freshmen are
told, and despite the large student population,
many often find this the case.
The city carries with it an atmosphere which
is probably unique throughout the country.
"It's very much the 'Live and let live' philosphy
here." explained one woman resident. "With
this kind of community, there's got to be some
sort of laissez-faire."
Telegraph Avenue presents the viewer with a
variety of impressons. One is immediately
struck by the diversity not only of the architec
ture fronting the street, but of the people who
frequent the street itself. Ever since the I%o's,
when students and police often clashed in riots
>nd anti-war demonstrations Berkeley has ac
quired the reputation as a city w here the "hippy
radicals" of his bygone period have been able to
retain those qualities which have made such a
mark on the last two decades in American pop
culture.
Berkeley is often still considered a mecca for
political demonstrators and activists. Few
causes seem to go noticed. Supporters of ev
erything from the nuclear freeze to sailing
classes establish themselves in Sproul Plaza, a
focal point of the UC campus. During the late
morning and early afternoon, it is difficult to
cross this stretch of pavement without being
asked to sign any number of political petitons
or join a variety of activist groups.
Though ni'nn >112 •' ■ -h 'he area mav
students tend to p oe'uist; tactics" to
ward off the more adament of these represent
ative demonstrators. Clutching textbooks and

note pads, students can be seen with heads bent
and eyes focused firmly on the ground in front
of them as they quickly stride through crowd of
activists proffering petitions.
The majority of those persons often con
sidered "unusual" are in reality harmless, pro
vided they are not provoked. "Whatever you do
or see, avoid eye contact!" is the often repeated

line of advice given to those unfamiliar with the
area.
With its seemingly unending stream of street
vendors, whose merchandise ranges from Indi
an jewelry to tie-dyed clothing, the northern

section of Telegraph Avenue may give the ap
pearance of being a shopping mall rather than a
city street. Combined with the already static at
mosphere which seems to pervade much of the
area surrounding the UC Berkeley campus this
extremely heterogeneous mixture of humanity
can, to say the least, be overwhelming.
Berkeley is a place alive with a unique life
style and culture all its own, which can be stimu
lating ... if one takes it all with an open mind
and a sense of adventure.
WHALE WATCHING
Location: The coastal waters
from Baja California to the
Bering Sea
Cost: Varies depending on the
boat company and the length of
the trip, anywhere from $8 to
$35
•: t ,t j- rhe ''Vtst.il waters fro*n Baja
(. alifornia to the Bering Sea are filled *uh ceta
cean traffic as the Grey Whale make their an
cestral migration ... an event that spurs na

ture Tans to take to their boats to get an up-close
look at the great mammals who have made such
a phenomenal comeback.
In the last century, the Grey fell prey to the
Captain Ahabs of the Yankee whaling fleet.
The number of these animals fell from about
30,000 to near extinction. In 1895, they became
protected by law and have since rebounded to a

population close to 15.000.
After four months of feeding in the North Pa
cific. the herds migrate almost 6000 miles, led
by the pregnant females, to Scammon's Lagoon
in Baja, California. In the warm lagoons of

Baja, the fetnales calve and the calves stay with
the mother until the following.
Seeing a whale breach just yards away is a
breathtaking sight, but it's also possible that
you could go out for three hours and see noth
ing but seagulls.
Several boating companies regularly charter
trips to watch the whales: Marin Adventures, at
the College of Marin in Kentfield; the Oceanic
Society Whale Watch in San Francisco; and
Pillar Point Fishing Trips in Half Moon Bay.
If you have access to a boat, and want to go
out on your own, be aware that a federal law
posts a $10,000 fine if you come closer than 100
yards of a whale.
PARACHUTING
Location:Antioch, CA; about
two hours from Stanford
Cost: For groups of one to three
$85 each, larger groups as low
as $70 each
B> Heather Millar
1 placed my fool in the door. "Are you
ready?," he asked.
It was windy outside. A chill shot down my
spine. Could I finally find the courage to do it
this time? "I guess there's no way out," I re
plied.
"Nope," he replied. "The point is coming
up," and with a slap on the back, "GO!"
The rest of my body followed my foot out the
door into the emptiness below. Time seemed to
ripple and slow — nothing registered but the
disbelief that I had done it. I had jumped out the
door of an airplane! Three thousand feet of air
separated me and the ground.
Four seconds — was it minutes? — passed.
As the "static line" went taut, the parachute au
tomatically deployed with a gentle tug, billow
ing out into a light green jellyfish with tentacles,
or shroud lines, reaching down to my harness.
The view from 2500 feet spread the whole Bay
Area at my feet. The sun set into the fog,
silhouetting the live oaks on Mt. Diablo.
Never since have I felt more full of life ... or
more terrified.
The Antioch Parachute Center had done ev
erything possible to prepare me to react to any
situation that might arise on a first jump. Dur
ing Antioch's first jump course, which is akin
my vision of Marine boot camp, I had drilled: I
had gone through simulated jumps; I had
jumped off platforms; I had sweated; I had been
lectured to; I had practiced hopping out of an
aircraft on the ground.
When I strode out onto the tarmac outfitted
in a jump suit and parachute, I was sure, in
tellectually at least, that I was prepared for any
emergency. Emotionally, I felt like a sacrificial
lamb, trussed up for the cost of an first jump

course.
Walking back to the tarmac from my first
jump, it all seemed worth it. As Perry Stevens,
the center's owner, said in his lecture to my first
jump class, "Parachuting is the most fun you
can have with your clothes on!"
SKUNK TRAIN
Location: Central Terminal in
Fort Bragg, CA; four hours
from Stanford
Cost: $8.50 to $12.00 depend
ing on the route
By Heather Millar
Promontory point; great train robberies; the
Atchitson, Topeka and the Santa Fe — the 19th
century locomotive has captured the American
imagination. The Skunk Train line engines hark
back to the days when trains were trains,
robbers were robbers, redwoods stood tall and
the frontier was wild.
Originally a 40-mile long logging railroad
lugging great redwoods to Georgia-Pacific mills
in Fort Bragg, the Skunk line offered steam pas
senger service for about a decade until the self
powered Skunk trains were introduced in 1925.
The yellow one-car trains were named for their
original gas engines. As folks used to say, "You
can smell 'em before you see 'em."
In addition to the Skunks, which service
redwood communities inaccessable by road, the
line also runs two vintage logging "Super-
Skunk" locomotives complete with wood seats,

observation cars, and wizzcned conductors.
Rumbling through tunnels and over 31 tres
tles, the trains follow a lengthy stretch of the
Noyo river in course of their two round-trips
daily to Northspur, the half-way point in the
line. Passengers may stop at Northspur to await
the returning train and enjoy the cafe under the
redwoods. Or they may choose to spend a whole
day watching the redwoods between Fort Bragg
and Willits sweep past the open observation
car.
From Fort Bragg, the Skunk travels along
Pudding Creek, through the first tunnel and
along the Noyo. The trip to Northspur takes
about one hour.
From Willits, a 1700 climb into the rolling
hills immediately confronts the train. The track
descends from this summit down to apple
groves, wildflowers, cattle, and finally into the

deep forest groves surrounding Northspur.
Itineraries from Fort Bragg to Willits, Willits
to Fort Bragg, or from either end of the line to
Northspur and back can all be accomodated.
RIDGE VINEYARDS
Location: Saratoga, CA;about
one hour from Stanford
Cost: Free plus wine-tasting
By Heather Millar
Americans tend to idealize the farm with im
ages of "amber waves of grain." Yet only a
small percentage of the country's population
now lives in rural area. Few take part in the har
vest which appears miraculously on the nation's
supermarket shelves. But at Ridge Vineyards in
Saratoga, urban involvement in the harvest is a
tradition.
Ridge Vineyards, described by one owner as
a "big-small winery" with an output of about
30,000 cases a year, annually invites volunteers
.to Qorne help pick grapes.
Picking is a vefy, very special time," said
Sue Crane, one of Ridge's owners. "It's the
whole winemaking process in a capsule. It starts
with the grapes."
The volunteer grape-picking tradition started
more than twenty years ago when three SRI en
gineers, their families, and a bachelor bought
the acres on Montebello Ridge because, accord

ing to Crane, "it was a beautiful piece of land
and we wanted to make a small amount of wine
for ourselves." What used to be necessity has
become a tradition.
Ridge Vineyards has grown to become a well
respected winery with the distinction of elevat
ing Zinfandel to the level of a premium wine.
Although this growth has made it necessary to
hire a staff and bring in migrant workers to pick
grapes during the work week, Ridge still invites
volunteers to help on Saturdays during the pick-»
ing.
The day begins about 8 o'clock in the morn
ing, when grape knives are distributed and
pickers shown what to pick and what not to
pick. The amateurs pick from about 9 o'clock
until 1 o'clock and then convene to a picnic
lunch and a winetasting of older Ridge wines.
Only those over 21 can be served.
Wine has recently captured the American
taste, chardonnay replacing beer in popularity
and the wine cooler the martini. The word of
Ridge's tradition has now spread so wide that
although the picking used to open to all comers,
past volunteer pickers are now notified by a
"picking letter" and reservations must be made
in advance (phone 408-867-3233).
Picking starts "when the grapes are ready,"
usually in late September or in October and
goes on for about three weeks, says Crane.
Since that period spans only three Saturdays,
available spaces fill quickly. Between 200 and
300 people show up every harvest Saturday and
in the last few years Ridge has had to keep a
waiting list.
"We teach people how to pick; it's gotten
pretty formal" Crane said, remembering the
days when all the families would go out to har
vest and crush the grapes. "Sometimes I think
we should just bring in field workers and get the
whole thing overwith, but then I realize that this
is the thing relationships are made of..

SAN SIMEON
Location: San Simeon, CA,
about four hours from Stanford
Cost: $7 per tour

Imagine living in a castle with 38 bedrooms,
31 bathrooms, a movie theater, a refectory (din
ing hall) and two immense swimming pools.
Named La Cuesta Fncantada, The Enchanted
Hill, just such an estate sprawls over 123 acres
near the little town of San Simeon. Opulently
set against the Santa Lucia Mountains on a
coastal knoll overlooking the sea, the 137-foot
high mansion is surrounded by gardens, ter
races, pools and palatial guest houses.
Before 1958, the fabled mansion was ac
cessible only to friends and guests of William
Randolph Hearst, publishing magnate and
owner of the San Francisco Chronicle. Begun in
1922 to be the permanent residence of the
Hearst family, the castle was still unfinished at
the time of Hearst's death in 1951. It remains
uncompleted although this is hard to believe
when confronted with the profusion of statuary
and paintings that adorn the rooms of the four
mansions that make up the complex.
Seven years after Hearst's death, the Hearst
Corporation presented the castle to the state of
California with the understanding that it be pre
served as a memorial to Hearst and his mother.
Four different tours of the San Simeon estate
are available. Each two-hour tour covers a dif
ferent portion of the castle. More than one tour
may be taken in one day.
Tours are $8 each for adults and $4 for chil
dren. No student discounts are offered.
Advance reservations may be made through
Ticketron at 393-6914. For more specific in
formation, call the Hearst Castle at
(805)927-4621.
To drive to the castle, take Highway 1 (205
miles from San Francisco) or Highway 101 (245
miles from San Francisco) south. Although
Highway 1 is a scenic route which might take
about five hours, it is worth the detour along
tortuous roads to pass Carmel, Monterey, and
Big Sur.
Estimated driving time from Monterey to
San Simeon is three hours.

MOUNTAIN PLAY
Location: Top of Mount
Tamalpais, Marin County,
CA; about an hour and a half
drive from Stanford, shuttle
buses depart from Mill Valley
Cost: '83 prices not yet set 112 '82
prices $3 to $6.50

Marin County residents have a reputation for
doing things that are a little iconoclastic, a little
mellow and sinfully enjoyable. Of these, the
Mountain Play is one.
The site used for the plays descends with an
upper slope of Mount Tamalpais and curves
into a Greek style amphitheater. History buffs
claim that the site was once the scene of Indian
religious rites, because the shape of the site is
either a freak of nature or a work of man.
From the upper reaches of the outdoor theater a
hint of the San Francisco skyline can be seen
over the redwoods. Grass lines each level or row
of "seats;" and wildflowers poke through the
cracks. Each May, spectators spread blankets
on the grass for a different play.
The Mountain Play is one of the traditional
events in Marin County. It was first held in 1913
on land that then belonged to William Kent
when Kent owned most of the land on Mount
Tarn. When Kent died in 1928, he left the
Mountain Theater to the Mountain Play As
sociation which later had the stone levels in
stalled by the Civilian Conservation Corps.
HANDEL SING
Location: Louise M. Davies
Symphony Hall, San Francis
co, CA
Cost: not yet determined

For infusing good old Yuletide cheer, the An
nual Sing-lt-Yourself-Messiah sponsored by
the San Francisco Conservatory of Music,
would be hard to beat.
Conducting sing-alongs of the massive musi
cal work which Handel scrawled in only 24 days
is not an original idea. Groups throughout Eng

land have been gathering for years to sing this
composer's most popular choral work. But the
Conservatory of Music has created a unique
tradition by televising the event live from Lou
ise M. Davies Symphony Hall.
The over 3000 tickets available each year sell
out about as fast as you can say "Deck the Halls
with Boughs of Holly." Two hours after tickets
went on sale in 1980, they were gone. The event
is beginning to attract a cult following of Bay
Area choral enthusiasts such as the Con
servatory Singers and the San Francisco Gay
Men's Chorus. But everyone, regardless of vo
cal persuasion, is welcomed and expected to
join in.
Companies such as the Emporium and the
Transamerica Corporation usually contribute
to cost of renting the hall, and the ticket sales
have raised over $20,000 for the San Francisco
Conservatory Scholarship Fund in past years.
It has been said, but not verified, that the San
Francisco sing is the largest rendition of the
Handel hit — sending the famous chorus of
"Hallelujah!" booming out of Davies and echo
ing across the San Francisco Civic Center. Last
year the exultation grew so powerful that 14

Christmas trees on the stage shook.
The chorus is accompanied by the San Fran
cisco Conservatory Orchestra and is conducted
by Louis Magor, director of the San Francisco
Symphony Chorus.
Hallelujah!
MUD BATHS
Location: Calistoga, CA;
about two hours from Stanford
Cost: Varies with treatment, up
to $31

Hot, mucky mud may not conjure up dec
adent luxury. But mudbaths are popular among
students — and they are available three hours
away in the Napa Valley town of Calistoga.
So if hot tubs and saunas have become old
hat, try mudbaths. Calistoga isone of only a few
mudbath capitals in the world, housing four
mudbath centers. Dr. Wilkinson's, the most
well-known and posh mudbath center, offers a
full treatment for $31. The mudbath center has
been shown on several television feature pro
grams, including Evening Magazine on San
Francisco's Channel 5
The mud in Calistoga — and in a few places
back east and in the desert — is special because
it is mixed with mineral water from local hot
springs. The fine-grained mud, like lava, is
black and somewhat gritty. It smells vaguely
sulfurous because of its mineral content.
Allegedly, the baths have a unique ability to
eliminate toxins from the human system. The
relaxing hot mud process cleanses the body by

opening pores, providing a drawing action that
saunas and hot tubs do not.
Mudbather Dave Bassett described the proc
ess as "a very gradual warming of the body."
Graduate Karen Halbo, another mudbather,
said, "It's like being in very warm water, but
you feel it more. . .you're supported."
The mud goes up to the shoulders, enabling
bathers to sip water through a straw.
A full treatment includes a mud bath, an indi
vidual mineral water whirlpool tub, a steamroll
and blanket rub, and a half-hour full body
massage. The entire process takes about two
hours and 15 minutes. "It's fun, it's great, it's
good for your health, it's competelv relaxing."
said one mudbather.
"It's a great way to go pamper yourself," said
Halbo.
Although the weather and the world's vaca
tion schedule have made March to October the
official mudbath season. Dr. Wilkinson's is
open every day of the year (except Christmas
and New Year's Day).
GOLD PANNING
Location: the Mother Lode in
the foothills of the Sierra Ne
vada, an average of four hours
away from Stanford
Cost: varies with area and pro
gram from $5 to over $50

I remember panning gold for the first time:
I squatted about knee deep in a stream running
out of the Sierra foothills, letting silt and sand

swirl through, and out of, my gold pan ... a
glint, a small nuggget, a glint, a flake. What I
gleaned from the stream that day was hardly
enough to buy a carton of milk, hut the thrill of
the glint-a-nugget-glint-a-flake process out
weighed the scantiness of my find.
No one organized park or facility exists for
those wanting to relive the days of the '49ers.
Perhaps it is this lack of organization that
makes panning gold in the Mother Lode so en
joyable. It leaves some of the adventure in the
bargain. Any stretch of stream or river is open
game, provided it is not already claimed.
Often the existence of a claim is hard to de
termine. especially on well-worked streams
such as the American River. Caution is war
ranted if you're out exploring on your own.
Prospectors are very possessive of their
claims. If you're set on exploring on your own,
the best approach is to look up the local sport
ing goods store in town — most of them also
carry prospecting equipment — and ask for ad
vice. The store owner probably has a claim of
his own and would be glad to help out.
Of course, most campgrounds in the Sierra
foothills rent gold panning equipment and les
sons. There are organized gold-seeking river
raft trips. Some prospectors rent out their
claims. Others make a business oTletting people
come up to their claim and watch a gold dredge
in action and perhaps pan a little.
The most important thing to remember
about prospecting for a weekend is that the
search is the challenge. You'll probably find
some gold, a glint, but it won't rival the dis
covery at Sutter's Mill in 1840's which got this
whole business started. You'll be lucky to get a
carton of milk out of the deal.

SOL VANG
Location: Solvang, CA; 45
miles north of Santa Barbara
Cost: Varies

Set against the blue Southern California sky
of the Santa Ynez Valley 45 miles north of San
ta Barbara, the thatched roofs of Solvang recre
ate a page out of Hans Christian Anderson.
Though far from being exclusively Danish,
Solvang is laid out like a 19th century Danish
village. Windmills turn lazily in the bree/.e.
Plaster and timber houses with gables and

steeply pitched roofs and Copenhagen gas
lights line the streets. Storks guard the chim
neys Aromas from the town's famous bakeries
which produce breads and pastries from cen
tury-old recipes filter into where visitors and
residents — many of them speaking Danish —
stroll.
Three Danish-horn educators and clergymen
founded Solvang seventy years ago, intending
to use the town as a site for a folk school pat
terned after the Danish College of Grand View
in Des Moines. Atterdag College opened its
doors to students in 1914.
The early settlers were almost exclusively
D;inish-born or of Danish extraction and fol
lowed such trades as farming and carpentry.
Solvang soon became the economic center of
the Santa Yne/ Valley and native Americans
began to settle there. But the Scandinavian trad
ition has been reinforced by a steady influx of
first-generation Danes. Danish is taught in the
schools and most families attend the Danish ru
ral-styled Bethania Lutheran Church.
The annual "Danish Days" festival, usually
held the third weekend in September, accents
the town's heritage. Groups of traditional
singers and dancers rove the streets; and the Vil
lage Band plays atop the Carlsberg beer wagon.
Villagers dressed in Danish costumes, serve an
aebleskiver breakfast on the streets.
During the summer, a company of 200, the
Solvang Theatrefest, performs seven open-air
productions in rotating repertory. Construc
tion of an indoor theatre will be finished some
time this year, and plays will then be offered
year-round.
Other notable Solvang festivals include the
July 4th and Christmas parades.

Samuel Clemens has been blamed for the
whole craziness held annually during the third

After a trip to the Mother Lode in the days
when '49ers kept the area a wild country,
Clemens heard a tale of a man named Jim
Smiley, a jumping frog named "Dan'l Webster"
and some Bowery Boys from New York. He re
turned to his cabin and wrote "The Celebrated
Jumping Frog of Calaveras County," a short
story which firmly established him as a humor
ist under the pen name of Mark Twain.
This was all the fable of Mark Twain until the
citizens of Calaveras County reenacted the first
frog jump to celebrate the paving of the Angel's

Camp streets in 1928. There were 51 frogs en
tered that first day; S(XX) people attended.
The frog jumping contest has since grown to
he full-scale extravaganza with a fair atten
dance of over 50.000. Frogs from South Ameri
ca. England, Germany. Australia and Canada
enter. Many preliminary contests around the
world qualify frogs to participate at the interna
tional championships in Angel's Camp. "E.
Davy Croakett," who jumped 20 feet, three in
ches now holds the world record for the longest
leap.
Frogs are best caught at night by momentari
ly blinding them with a flashlight. Frogs may
also be rented at Angel's Camp.
