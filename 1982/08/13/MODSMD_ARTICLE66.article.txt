## San Francisco scenes and points of interest 
### Heather Millar 
49 Mile Drive — This half-day
tour is a planned drive through
the most famous landmarks of
"The City." An excellent in
troduction to San Francisco, the
route starts on Van Ness Avenue
at the Civic Center and is clearly
marked by blue and white seagull
signs.
Alcatraz— Known by inmates
as "The Rock," Alcatraz claims
most of its fame from the time
when it was a Devil's Isle-style
federal penitentiary housing such
notable criminals as The Bird
Man. The island has also been
used as a fortification, a U.S. mil
itary prison, an army disciplinary
barracks, and an American Indi
an stronghold. The Bay Area's
39,000-acre Golden Gate Recre
ation Area now claims the 135
foot crag: and the National Park
Service runs two-hour conducted
tours from the San Francisco wa
terfront. Reservations required.
Transamerica Pyramid — The
tallest building in the San Fran
cisco skyline, the 48 stories of the
Transamerica Pyramid slant sky
ward to form an unusual "sky
saving" wedge. This design, a
company symbol for the Trans
america Corporation, and the

building's juxtaposition to the
low-rise Jackson Square caused
widespread controversy.
Bank of America World Head
quarters — The Bank of America
complex occupies an entire
downtown block, complete with
a formal plaza dominated by a
black granite sculpture known
locally as 'The Banker's Heart.
Completed in 1969, thousands of
movie audiences thought they
saw the early demise of the Bank
of America building in the movie
The Towering Inferno.
Ghirardelli Square — Where
19th century laborers once made
chocolate, packaged spices and
wove woolens, 20th century vis
itors to Ghirardelli Square now
browse in the Mustard Building,
watch street performers in the
plaza next to the (Woolen) build
ing and buy Ghirardelli (pro
nounced GEAR'-ar-delly) choc
olate in the old Chocolate Build
ing. The brick buildings of the
old factory were restored in 1962,
setting an example for urban
reclamation efforts all over the
world.
The Cannery — A defunct Del

Monte cannery transformed into
a galleria of shops and restau
rants, The Cannery continued
the Ghirardelli tradition of urban
redevelopment. Mime and musi
cians regularly give per
formances in the complex's
square.
Fisherman's Wharf — Salty
Italian fisherman, seagulls, and
the ripe smell of gutted fish once
dominated San Francisco's
wharf. Although the nearby slips
still berth trawlers, wax
museums, carnival rides and
tourist shops have taken over the
surrounding area. Yet the 19th
century museum ship
"Balclutha" harks back to old
days and some of the city's best
restaurants are still to be found
along Fisherman's Wharf.
Palace of Fine Arts — Created
as the diadem of the 1915 Pan
ama Pacific Exposition, a central
rotunda embracing a Corinthian
colonnade ornamented with
freizes and statuary comprised
the Palace. By the 1950'5, these
original plaster structures had

been reduced to ruins by the
weather sweeping through the
Golden Gate. During the '60s, a
sentimental movement mobilized
to have the monument restored
in pre-cast concrete. The sup
porting buildings now house the
Exploratorium, a "hands-on"
science museum.
Chinatown — An long-time
resident of Hong Kong once said
that San Francisco's Chinatown
reminded him of home ... the
rush-hour traffic jams on-
Chinatown's main drag, Grant
Avenue, rivaled any bicycled, au
tomobiled tie-up the Chinese city
could muster! But Grant Avenue
also offers a kaliedescope of
Asian delights — restaurants,
dim sum bars, pharmacys display
ing pickled snake, housewives in
specting the Chinese cabbage dis
played in front of groceries with
pressed ducks hanging in the win
dow. The streets radiating out
from Grant Avenue house one of
the largest Chinese populations
outside of China and plenty of

'After the 1906
Earthquake and Fire, the
lity planners wanted to
remake the town into a
modern Athens. The City
Hall is but a small part of
[his plan that reached
fruition/

opportunities for exploring.
Union Square — Union Square
is San Francisco's Fif k *: Avenue,
Miracle Mile, Place Vendome.
Some of The City's most swank
shops and hotels — I. Magin's
(complete with a marble-pan
elled, gold fixtured bathroom), '
Sak's Fifth Avenue, the Hotel St.
Francis, Elizabeth Arden's —
front the Square or the nearby
streets.
Civic Center — After the 1906
Earthquake and Fire, the city
planners wanted to remake the
town into a modern Athens. The
Civic Center is only a small part
of the elaborate complex
planned. San Franciscans boast
that City Hall, with its or
namented dome, gargoyled
finials and marble balustrade is
the finest example of French Ro
manesque architecture outside of
France. The elaborate Federal
and State office buildings. Civic
Auditorium and Brooks Exhibit
Hall, Public Library and Per
forming Art Center echo this
traditional theme. The newly
completed glass and white con
crete Louise M. Davies Sym
phony Hall is a modern de
parture.
Twin Peaks — A cliche neck
ing and drinking teenage hang
out Friday and Saturday nights,
Twin Peaks offer an intoxicating
vista of the Bay Area from the
Marin headlands to the San
Francisco skyline to San Jose.
During the day, a drive around
the figure eight road that collars
the peaks is an excellent way to
get your bearings on a first trip to
San Francisco. At night the glit
tering skyline is a perfect top-off
to a night on the town.
Japan Town/Center — Japan
Center and the revitalized Japan
Town join to create a mecca for
the thousand? of 'apancsc busi
nessmen who visit San Francisco
to make financial deals and have
their picture taken in front of the
Golden Gate Bridge. The com
plex of hotels, theatres, shops,
restaurants offer some of the best
saimen noodles and electronic
goods this side of the Pacific.
Polk Street — In the pre-su
permarket era, this avenue once
supported a posh shopping dis
trict catering to the well-to-do
residents of Russian Hill and
Nob Hill. Bath houses and gay
activists have since supplanted
the fur-coated housewives and
chic shops. Though the shops
have changed with the local

tastes and demands, many fash
ionable boutiques still front Polk
Street.
Washington Square —
Schoolgirls coming out of con
fession in the adjacent Church of
Sts. Peter grandfather
feeding the pigeons, and huckers
from the Broadway red-light dis
trict a couple of blocks away,
circulate through this piazza of
San Francisco's "Little Italy,"
the North Beach District. After
gorging on pasta in one of the ex
cellent cafes in the area, Wash
ington Square is a great place to
digest your meal and soak in the
local color.
California Palace of the Legion
of Honor — The Palace, perched
close to Land's End in the
western part of the city, houses
an extensive collection of Rodin
bronzes including The Thinker.
Fort Point — This three-tiered
brick fort used to hold vigil
against invaders passing through
the Golden Gate. Now dwarfed
by the Golden Gate Bridge, the
building has been made a Na
tional Historic Site and tours are
conducted between 10 a.m. and 5
p.m..
Golden Gate Bridge — Visitors
are often disappointed to dis
cover the bridge is not so named
because it is painted gold but be
cause the sun sets in the Golden
Gate . . . but not always. The
Gate is often "socked in" by fog,
to the dismay of tourists dressed
for California sun.
Lombard Street — This twister
descends Russian Hill from
Hyde, with 10 hairpin turns in a
single block. Constructed —
some say by a mischievous city
planner others say to aid horses
in climbing the steep incline —
the street now terrifies student
drivers all over the city.
Mission Delores — Father
Serra founded this mission in
1776 as part of Spain's co
lonization effort in the New
World. During his lifetime, this
Franciscan missionary started a
whole string of missions
stretching along the El Camino
Real or "King's Highway" all the
way to Baja.
Ferry Building — In the days
before rush hour traffic clogged
the Bay and Golden Gate
Bridges, the Ferry building an
nually processed more than 50
million commuters from the East
Bay and Marin County. Today, a
Bay Bridge approach obscures
this monument at the foot of
Market Street. Most of the build
ing is used now as office space, al
though the Golden Gate Ferry
operates out of the south side of
the building.
Colt Tower/Telegraph Hill —
The bohemian section of San
Francisco, the circuitous streets
and cliff-hanging houses of Tele
graph Hill have been inhabited
by successive generations of
Flower Children, artists and lit
erati. The upper area around
Coit Tower, a monument to the
city's early volunteer firemen,
has developed into a patchwork

of posh apartments.
Nob Hill — The exclusive
Commonwealth Club, the lavish
Fairmont Hotel, the Huntington
Hotel, four-star restaurant Alex
is, Grace Cathedral, apartments
with rents as high as their views
— all these attract San Francis
co's glitterati to Nob Hill, one of
the city's most elegant spots.
George R. Moscone Convention
Center — A 5126 million dollar
affirmation that San Francisco is
indeed a tourist town, Moscone
Center houses a a 216,000-
square-foot exhibit hall, 41 meet
ing rooms seating from 30 to
3000 people, a 30,000 square-foot
ballroom, and accommodates
20,000 special events theatre
style. The facility is named for the
late Mayor George R. Moscone
who was assassinated in the late
'70s by a San Francisco super
visor.
Pier 39 — Pier 39 surrounds its
mall of shops and restaurants
with the trappings of a turn-of
the-century street scene. Built on
a 1000 foot long pier, the mall of
fer sweeping views of the Bay and
the City.
Old Mint — Though it was
phased out of operation in 1937,

A $126 million
affirmation that San
Francisco is indeed a
tourist town,
Moscone Center
houses a 216,000
square-foot exhibit
hall, 41 meeting
rooms seating from
30 to 3000 people, a
30,000 square-foot
ballroom...

the Old Mint was revamped and
reopened as a museum in 1973.
The exhibits include period
rooms, a pyramid of gold bars,
Old West artifacts, Mint's Spe
cial Coins and Metals Division,
and monetary treasures of all
kinds.
Golden Gate Park — It is said
that botanist John McLaren
planted one of almost every kind
of known plant within the three
mile by one mile parameters of
Golden Gate Park. The park also
includes a Museum complex, a
Conservatory of Flowers, a buf
falo paddock, a playground, a
stadium, and numerous lakes.
Bay Area Rapid Transit System
(BART) — On a good day, fleets
of Monorail-like BART trains
glide over 71 miles of track on
both sides of the Bay. The
network of 34 stations and a
transbay tube was activated in
1974, and is considered one of the
most ambitious transit projects
in U.S. history. Unfortunately
the smooth exterior fails to cover
some bugs in the system, and
commuters often suffer the in
convenience of delays.
