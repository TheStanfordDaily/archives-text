## San Francisco scenes and points of interest 
### Heather Millar 
49 Mile Drive — This half-day
tour is a planned drive through
the most famous landmarks of
"The City." An excellent in
troduction to San Francisco, the
route starts on Van Ness Avenue
at the Civic Center and is clearly
marked by blue and white seagull
signs.
Alcatraz— Known by inmates
as "The Rock," Alcatraz claims
most of its fame from the time
when it was a Devil's Isle-style
federal penitentiary housing such
notable criminals as The Bird
Man. The island has also been
used as a fortification, a U.S. mil
itary prison, an army disciplinary
barracks, and an American Indi
an stronghold. The Bay Area's
39,000-acre Golden Gate Recre
ation Area now claims the 135
foot crag: and the National Park
Service runs two-hour conducted
tours from the San Francisco wa
terfront. Reservations required.
Transamerica Pyramid — The
tallest building in the San Fran
cisco skyline, the 48 stories of the
Transamerica Pyramid slant sky
ward to form an unusual "sky
saving" wedge. This design, a
company symbol for the Trans
america Corporation, and the

building's juxtaposition to the
low-rise Jackson Square caused
widespread controversy.
Bank of America World Head
quarters — The Bank of America
complex occupies an entire
downtown block, complete with
a formal plaza dominated by a
black granite sculpture known
locally as 'The Banker's Heart.
Completed in 1969, thousands of
movie audiences thought they
saw the early demise of the Bank
of America building in the movie
The Towering Inferno.
Ghirardelli Square — Where
19th century laborers once made
chocolate, packaged spices and
wove woolens, 20th century vis
itors to Ghirardelli Square now
browse in the Mustard Building,
watch street performers in the
plaza next to the (Woolen) build
ing and buy Ghirardelli (pro
nounced GEAR'-ar-delly) choc
olate in the old Chocolate Build
ing. The brick buildings of the
old factory were restored in 1962,
setting an example for urban
reclamation efforts all over the
world.
The Cannery — A defunct Del

Monte cannery transformed into
a galleria of shops and restau
rants, The Cannery continued
the Ghirardelli tradition of urban
redevelopment. Mime and musi
cians regularly give per
formances in the complex's
square.
Fisherman's Wharf — Salty
Italian fisherman, seagulls, and
the ripe smell of gutted fish once
dominated San Francisco's
wharf. Although the nearby slips
still berth trawlers, wax
museums, carnival rides and
tourist shops have taken over the
surrounding area. Yet the 19th
century museum ship
"Balclutha" harks back to old
days and some of the city's best
restaurants are still to be found
along Fisherman's Wharf.
Palace of Fine Arts — Created
as the diadem of the 1915 Pan
ama Pacific Exposition, a central
rotunda embracing a Corinthian
colonnade ornamented with
freizes and statuary comprised
the Palace. By the 1950'5, these
original plaster structures had

been reduced to ruins by the
weather sweeping through the
Golden Gate. During the '60s, a
sentimental movement mobilized
to have the monument restored
in pre-cast concrete. The sup
porting buildings now house the
Exploratorium, a "hands-on"
science museum.
Chinatown — An long-time
resident of Hong Kong once said
that San Francisco's Chinatown
reminded him of home ... the
rush-hour traffic jams on-
Chinatown's main drag, Grant
Avenue, rivaled any bicycled, au
tomobiled tie-up the Chinese city
could muster! But Grant Avenue
also offers a kaliedescope of
Asian delights — restaurants,
dim sum bars, pharmacys display
ing pickled snake, housewives in
specting the Chinese cabbage dis
played in front of groceries with
pressed ducks hanging in the win
dow. The streets radiating out
from Grant Avenue house one of
the largest Chinese populations
outside of China and plenty of
