# The 						Grateful Dead to come to Frost
## 
### Karen Springen 
'We've been working
on it (the concert) for
over a year. .. We
want to get a concert
back on campus. The
Dead really want to
play here.'

In the first on-campus rock
concert since ASSU Special
Events disbanded two years ago,
the Grateful Dead will perform
in Frost Amphitheater Oct. 9 and
10.
The Chaparral, one of the na
tion's oldest campus humor mag
azines, and Bill Graham Pres
ents, which holds a virtual
monopoly in Bay Area concert
promoting, will co-promote the
event. The concert will be the first
here since the Jefferson Starship
appeared in 1980. At that time,
declining attendance and the ris
ing cost of producing concerts
caused ASSU Special Events to
lose about $125,000.
According to Vinny Freda,

business manager of The Chapar
ral', the Dead last performed here
a decade ago in Maples Pavilion.
Chris Walters, editor of the
Chaparral, said, "We've been
working on it (the concert) for
over a year. . .We want to get a
concert back on campus. The
Dead really want to play here."
He called the concert "the event
of the quarter."
The Grateful Dead gained na
tional recognition during the
1967 Monterey Pop Festival and
at Woodstock in 1969. Gold
albums include American Beau
ty, Terrapin Station, and Work
ingman's Dead.
Walters said the Dead concert
should complement rather than
compete with the Kenny Loggins
concert which will come to Frost
October 24th. "I don't think it's
competition. (Loggins) is a com
pletely different concert. . .The
more the merrier, as far as I'm
concerned."
Walters said the Chaparral's
main purpose in promoting the
concert is "to bring concerts back
and get some kind of organiza
tion to keep concerts." While
profits are secondary, Walters
said the Chaparral hopes to make

money unless it encounters cost
over-runs.
According to Walters, Bill
Graham Presents is paying the
Chaparral a flat fee of 520,000.
The Chaparral is responsible for
producing and advertising the
concert, paying for security and
box office privileges from the
$20,000 fee. The Chaparral will
receive no percentage of the prof
its, except from concessions.
Walters said the humor maga
zine plans to pay off some of its

... profit 'won't be
more than $10,000
... Most of our
money is being eaten
up by the box office.'

long-standing debts with any
profits it makes from the concert.
"We're also going to try to get a
new typewriter," he added.
Because of costs involved in
paying people out of the fixed fee,
said Walters, "We might not
even break even."

Freda said the profit "won't be
more than $10,000. . .Most of
our money is being eaten up by
the box office."
The Tresidder ticket office is
one of the most expensive in the
Bay Area, said Freda. But be
cause they have a monopoly as
the main office , the Chaparral
must work through them.
The ticket office charge, which
Freda estimated at about $4000
for this concert, comes out of the
$20,000 flat fee. Although the
charge is generally 30 cents a
ticket, negotiations are in process
to set a maximum fee.
Tickets will be available Sept.
12 at local box offices and Sept.
28-29 only at the Tresidder ticket
office. A block of 1000 tickets
will be held for each concert and
reserved for students who return
for fall quarter after ticket sales
start. Tickets will be $12 in ad
vance and $13.50 at the door.
Students will receive a $1 dis
count.
Security arrangements will ban
liquor and drugs from the am
phitheatre. Walters does not pre
dict security problems with the
audience. "There's going to be
lots of 'Dead heads' there (Frost
Amphitheatre can hold 9500) but
there should be a lot of students
there, too," he said.
