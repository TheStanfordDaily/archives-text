# DIVERSIONS
## To build a loft — how some students rise above their piers 
### 
For the love of lofts and for
those of you who passed wood
shop (do they still have that in
high school?): With the side be
nefit of making maximum use of
your undoubtedly too small Uni
versity housing quarters, here's a
diversion of sorts for craftsmen
and homebodies.
In case you're not familiar
with the term, lofts are beds on
stilts so to speak, they may be
very simple structures designed
to enhance storage space or
finely crafted pieces of furniture
adding a touch of class to your
modest accomodations.
It shouldn't take too long to
build one, really, and then vou'll
have more space for other diver
sions like yoga or a stereo sys
tem.
By far the dorm which has the
most lofts is Toyon, due to its
cathedralesque ceilings which
tend to give loftless residents the
"closing in walls" feeling.
They're actually a fairly recent
invention — only becoming
popular in the past ten years or
so.
Lofts come in all shapes and
sizes: single lofts for one bed,
double lofts for two,"L-shaped"
lofts with a mezzanine for study
ing and reading, split level lofts,
and lofts with built-in bars, stair
cases and even waterbeds.
If you don't want to spend the
money to buy a ready-made loft,
it's not that difficult to build one
yourself. Lumber and tools are
available from local merchants,
and tools like power saws and
drills can be rented.
Before you plunge headlong
into the world of loft ownership,
you should know the University
safety regulations concerning
lofts, or you may end up doing a
nose-dive.
According to Robert Mibach,
residence hall facilities manager,
student lofts should be:
— free-standing
— easily dismantled
— supported by at least 4x4
uprights
— built of lumber that con

forms to uniform types and code
(Douglas Fir of grade one or bet
ter)
— braced to prevent sway
— topped with at least Vh inch
plywood.
Hal Wilson, University health
officer adds, "The law requires
'adequate ventilation' for rooms
based on occupancy and room
size. When the livable area in a
room increases, or when lofts
block off access to windows, they
become a health hazard."
Peter Irish, deputy county fire
marshall says lofts are a "gray
area" as far as his office is con
cerned.
He has no jurisdiction in pri
vate rooms, provided that lofts
do not obstruct the sprinkler pat
tern. "Lofts built up into the attic
are clearly illegal," he says, "be
cause they break the separation
between two stories, undermin
ing code regulations for fire

retardant attic walls." For his
purposes, lofts are ""really only
elaborate furniture."
Authorities all agreed that any
sort of electrical alteration is out.
Students should not try to wire in
ceiling light switches or tamper
with electrical boxes. One in
stance 5 years ago where stu
dents had wired an attic room
resulted in a fire. Even an elec
trical contractor cannot alter
dorm wiring without University
approval.
Also, students should not bolt
their lofts into the wall. Doing so
makes the loft a permanent
structure requiring a building
permit and compliance with the
Uniform Building Code's re
quirement that ceiling height in
Santa Clara County be a
minimum of IVi feet.
According to Mibach, the re
sident manager's office (RMO)
policy is that "II a loft is to be

constructed within the residence
halls, a plan or drawing must he
submitted for review to RMO so
it can be reviewed as to its struc
tural integrity."
"Students are more than wel
come to come by the Resident
Manager's Office in Crothers
Memorial Hall room 308 for
building assistance," he said.
"So how do I build a loft?"
The basic ingredients of a one
story, single bed loft are:
— a 4xB sheet of plywood Vs
inch thick or thicker (fibre board
is heavy and cumbersome)
— 4x4 posts cut to the desired
height
— 2x4 or 2x6 boards to sup
port the plywood, Ix 4 or 2x4
boards to use as cross-bracing to
prevent sway
— joist hangers
— nails (or wood screws) and
lag bolts
— carpet to finish off the plat
form.
The first thing to build is the
frame to support the platform.
There are two basic frames to
choose from: (A) a frame of
2x4's with outside dimensions of
4xB ft. or (B) a 2x6 or 2xB outer
frame with inside dimensions
4xB ft.
The advantage to B is that the
plywood may be set inside the
outer frame, leaving a rim
around the platform which not
only keeps the mattress from
sliding off but precludes the use
of nails to anchor the plywood to
the frame. This saves set-up and
tear-down time.
For both frames (A and B), cut
the corners so the shorter 2x4's
fit inside the long ones. The ni
cest and easiest way to secure the
outside corners, though slightly
more expensive is to use lag bolts
(not bolts from Lagunita Court
— ask at a hardware store for a
description).
At each end of the long boards
drill two holes into the face.
Make the diameter of the holes
smaller than that of the bolt.
Make sure the lag bolts are long

enough to extend into the end of
the shorter boards and provide a
strong joint.
The next step for both A and B
is to install joists at 20-inch in
tervals to support the platform.
Be sure to leave at least four in
ches clear at each end for the loft
legs.
Joists are usually 2x4's sup
ported by joist hangers anchored
to the long boards of the frame.
The joists must provide a level
surface for the plywood plat
form.
For a 2x4 outer frame (A),
make sure the joist hangers are
nailed in so that the inner 2x4
joists will fit flush with the top of
the frame. First, measure and
mark position of the joist han
gers with a small 2x4 block.
Now cut the 2x4 joists to fit
snugly within the outer frame,
resting on the joist hangers. As
long as the corners are secure,
the joists need not be nailed.
On frames with top-flush
joists (A), plywood platforms
must be nailed or screwed down.
For a loft with a wide outer frame
(B), the plywood platform may
be set on top of the joists inside
the frame.
Next, the legs must be instal
led and braced. Use 4x4 posts.
Set them inside the frame at the
corners, with the top of the posts
on the same level as the joists.
You could lean the platform
against the wall for this step.
Drill holes for at least two lag
bolts per leg, or use at least four
" 16 inch penny" nails.
Braces should run diagonally
from the top of one leg to the
bottom of the opposite leg. From
the long side, use a 2x4 for the
diagonal brace; on the ends, a
1 x 4 is fine.
If you want built-in shelves,
cut a 2x4 or 2x6 to fit between

the legs and nail or bolt it in. This
will also give added support.
For a ladder, cut several
blocks of equal length for stairs
(wider stairs are nicer). Cut two
more 2x4's for ladder uprights

(avoid splintery wood) ancJ mark
oft stops at regular inters als. I he
ladder can be nailed together
since it's small enough to store.
Now your loft should he ready
to sand, stain, carpet and enjoy.
