## Commentary/Glen and Shearer Life changes with onset of computers 
### 
Washington — At this point
each summer, we've usually at
tained that golden bronze look.
This season, however, we're as
pale as Dubliners in March.
Our new home computer is
the reason. The best sunning
hours pass, Friday nights go by,
and we're still glued to our ter
minal. Ann Landers, what to do?
Not everyone, of course, gets
a kick out of Afghan updates
from the British Broadcasting
Corporation, or tomorrow's
Senate hearings schedule. Nor
mal folks get the news they need
from Dan Rather or their local
newspaper.

... children could
be spending more
of their learning
hours at home in
front of a screen
and far from any
semblance of the
natural world.

But our subscription to The
Source, one of a variety of elec
tronic home-information sys
tems now available, provides us
with much more — in fact, 1200
services in all. We can play
backgammon, make restaurant
reservations or find out which
airlines connect through Tripoli,
Libya. We can even key-punch
conversations with other sub
scribers to The Source.
It's unclear how long we'll
take to adjust to this new addi
tion to our lives. Until now,
we've been able to sidestep the
computer revolution, leaving
data processors and television
game attachments to the trend
setting few.
But as part of a growing popu
lation of Americans who work at
home, we've had to accept the
inevitable. If we don't think
computer information systems
are vital to our line of work,
we're finding them terribly ad
vantageous.
Unfortunately, we're also find
ing that computerized Inde
pendence can be a zero-sum
game: for all its benefits, it
eliminates one's healthy reliance
on direct human contact. Pre
viously, we were already meet

ing a miserably low quota for
people through the telephone
system. Now there's no reason to
call up someone for an answer;
The Source has them all.
Meanwhile, the computer
seems to be changing the very
definition of the home. As termi
nals enable more white-collar
workers to make a living at
home, our traditional place of
refuge could vanish in a maze of
coaxial cables. Some say that, in
time, children could be spend
ing more of their learning hours
at home in front of a screen and
far from any semblance of the
natural world.
While drastic, such changes
are a long way off. They presume
eventual and widespread af
fordability of microcomputer
hardware, which now ranges in
price from $250 to $12,000 per
unit. By 1985, in fact, between
two and five percent of all Amer
ican households are likely to
have two-way videotext systems
such as ours.
More importantly, the home
information revolution will rely
on a nation's ability to manage
responsibly the computer's
powers. Hoards of data — some
good, some bad — will be filter
ing into homes; meanwhile,
medical records and other per
sonal data may stream out into
relatively anonymous hands. On
the bright side, the Big Brother
might be a local pharmacist who
receives and stores information
that could prove relevant to a
personal health need. On the
down side, Big Brother could
also be a criminal computer whiz
who's gained access to another's
bank codes, stock listings and
other programmable assets.
Finally, computerized change
may hinge on public willingness
to place its information under
the control of a few powerful
system owners and program
mers. It's this possibility that has
underlain the government's ef
forts to give American Tele
phone & Telegraph a more lim
ited role in the home-informa
tion market.
So, as we sign off, we're trying
to compensate for our lost tans
by coming to terms with this in
formation-rfch world. Whether
currently computerized or not,
no one really can afford to ig
nore the future any longer.
