# Senior Elway ambivalent about contest
## 
### LISA STERN 
San Jose State head coach Jack
Elway described today's Stan
ford-Spartan game by saying,
"It's a unique situation and a
unique experience, but I'll be
glad when it's over."

When the final seconds tick off
the game clock in Stanford Stadi
um later this afternoon, so too
will end four years of competi
tion between the Spartan coach
and his son John, the Cardinal's
starting quarterback.
Coach Elway explained that
his feelings about the competi
tion in each of the previous meet
ings could be best expressed by
the word ambivalent.
"John has a commitment to
Stanford and I have a commit
ment to San Jose State. We both
will honor and fulfill these com
mitments."

Jack Elway has proven his
level dedication to the Spartan
football program since taking the
reins in 1979. In his past three
seasons as head coach he has
compiled a 23-11-1 record includ
ing last weeks victory over Ore
gon. Last year his team finished
with a 5-0 conference record in
the Pacific Coast Athletic As
sociation and earned a berth in
the California Bowl.

Elway attributes his success at
San Jose State to the attidude
which he attempts to instill in his
players. "We want our young
guys to get their college degrees,"
he said, "and to live up to their
potential. We urge the players to
have fun but to excel at the same
time'.
Elway is also proud of the

good recruiting season he has
had the past three years. "I see
my job as 80 percent recruiting
and 20 percent coaching," Elway
revealed, "but of course you have
to do your best at both. For
tunately I've had a great area to
recruit in. San Jose State is a
great university and we've been
able to attract the talent.
Elway admitted that the one
major drawback of the Spartan
football program is the size of the
stadium facility. San Jose State
will play seven of their 11 regular
season games on the road and
won't play at home untill Octo
ber 16.

"Without the seating capacity,
it is difficult to create a positive
home field situation even though
we have great fans," Elway ex
plains.
In the last meeting between the
Cardinal and the Spartans, Stan
ford's home field advantage did
meant little as Elway's squad
crushed the Card for only the
fifth time in the history of the Bay
Area rivalry. The 28-6 margin of
victory was the largest ever com
piled against the Stanford by a
San Jose State team.
Coach Elway attributed the
win to a number of factors. "As a
team we were peaking at that
time. Defensively, we had an out

standing game because we took
away the run and put pressure on
John.

"On special teams," he con
tinued, "we punted and kicked
well and we were improving on
offense."
The San Jose State offense
which averaged 32.3 points per
game in 1981 (sixth in the nation)
will be regrouping after the grad
uation of Gerald Willhite, a No.
1 draft pick last spring.
"Gerald was very flexible," he
said, "and we featured him on of
fense, so we'll have to adjust.
We'll now use more running
backs and continue to pass the

ball an awful lot."
Elway said that he is pleased
with the pre-season predictions
which forecast another con
ference title for the Spartans.
"It's good that they pick us to
win, but we still take it one game
at a time."
Like his team which plays one
game at a time, Elway em
phasized that he will take one
season at a time as head coach of
San Jose State. After his name
was mentioned as a candidate for
the head coaching position at
California vacated by Roger
Theder last fall, Elway chose to
remain with the Spartan pro
gram.
"It was an emotional de
cision," Elway recalled, "because
I received such a postive reaction
from the university. People were
so excited about San Jose State. I
worked darn hard to make this a
program San Jose State can be
proud of.
"But I'm glad that I looked
into the possibility," he con
tinued, "and although I'm not
job hunting, if another op
portunity comes up, I'll have to
investigate it also."
Elway is 1-2 against Stanford
and hopes to even the series with
a win today. "This game is ex
tremely important to our football
team because it's a challenge ev
ery young guy looks for," he said.
"For me, it's obviously a spe
cial event because my son is the
quarterback on the other team,"
he explained, jokingly adding,
"but I alway have said that the
most important win will be the
one just before I die.

Elway described today's Stan
ford-Spartan game by saying,
"It's a unique situation and a
unique experience, but I'll be
glad when it's over."

When the final seconds tick off
the game clock in Stanford Stadi
um later this afternoon, so too
will end four years of competi
tion between the Spartan coach
and his son John, the Cardinal's
starting quarterback.
Coach Elway explained that
his feelings about the competi
tion in each of the previous meet
ings could be best expressed by
the word ambivalent.
"John has a commitment to
Stanford and I have a commit
ment to San Jose State. We both
will honor and fulfill these com
mitments."

Jack Elway has proven his
level dedication to the Spartan
football program since taking the
reins in 1979. In his past three
seasons as head coach he has
compiled a 23-11-1 record includ
ing last weeks victory over Ore
gon. Last year his team finished
with a 5-0 conference record in
the Pacific Coast Athletic As
sociation and earned a berth in
the California Bowl.

Elway attributes his success at
San Jose State to the attidude
which he attempts to instill in his
players. "We want our young
guys to get their college degrees,"
he said, "and to live up to their
potential. We urge the players to
have fun but to excel at the same
time'.
Elway is also proud of the

good recruiting season he has
had the past three years. "I see
my job as 80 percent recruiting
and 20 percent coaching," Elway
revealed, "but of course you have
to do your best at both. For
tunately I've had a great area to
recruit in. San Jose State is a
great university and we've been
able to attract the talent.
Elway admitted that the one
major drawback of the Spartan
football program is the size of the
stadium facility. San Jose State
will play seven of their 11 regular
season games on the road and
won't play at home untill Octo
ber 16.

"Without the seating capacity,
it is difficult to create a positive
home field situation even though
we have great fans," Elway ex
plains.
In the last meeting between the
Cardinal and the Spartans, Stan
ford's home field advantage did
meant little as Elway's squad
crushed the Card for only the
fifth time in the history of the Bay
Area rivalry. The 28-6 margin of
victory was the largest ever com
piled against the Stanford by a
San Jose State team.
Coach Elway attributed the
win to a number of factors. "As a
team we were peaking at that
time. Defensively, we had an out

standing game because we took
away the run and put pressure on
John.

"On special teams," he con
tinued, "we punted and kicked
well and we were improving on
offense."
The San Jose State offense
which averaged 32.3 points per
game in 1981 (sixth in the nation)
will be regrouping after the grad
uation of Gerald Willhite, a No.
1 draft pick last spring.
"Gerald was very flexible," he
said, "and we featured him on of
fense, so we'll have to adjust.
We'll now use more running
backs and continue to pass the

ball an awful lot."
Elway said that he is pleased
with the pre-season predictions
which forecast another con
ference title for the Spartans.
"It's good that they pick us to
win, but we still take it one game
at a time."
Like his team which plays one
game at a time, Elway em
phasized that he will take one
season at a time as head coach of
San Jose State. After his name
was mentioned as a candidate for
the head coaching position at
California vacated by Roger
Theder last fall, Elway chose to
remain with the Spartan pro
gram.
"It was an emotional de
cision," Elway recalled, "because
I received such a postive reaction
from the university. People were
so excited about San Jose State. I
worked darn hard to make this a
program San Jose State can be
proud of.
"But I'm glad that I looked
into the possibility," he con
tinued, "and although I'm not
job hunting, if another op
portunity comes up, I'll have to
investigate it also."
Elway is 1-2 against Stanford
and hopes to even the series with
a win today. "This game is ex
tremely important to our football
team because it's a challenge ev
ery young guy looks for," he said.
"For me, it's obviously a spe
cial event because my son is the
quarterback on the other team,"
he explained, jokingly adding,
"but I alway have said that the
most important win will be the
one just before I die.
