# The
						Official Pacijic-10 Conference Preview

I. Stanford So have a litt.v.
imagination. Maybe Stanford
didn't rank higher than fifth in
the conference in any of the r>>\ -
season football polls, but >-o;.
have to dream a little. Stanrord
has the nation's top quarterback
in John Elway and has an offense
which is a scoring threat from
anywhere on the field. Running
back Vincent White should pick
up the slack left by Darrin
Nelson and could be the nations
most underrated runner. He's al
ready convinced KSFO sports
caster Ron Barr that he's really
Darrin Nelson in disguise as Barr
repeatedly referred to White as
Nelson in his remarkable per
formance last Saturday. Unlike
last year, the receivers are both
experienced and deep. Both
Emile Harry and Mike Tolliver
should make All-Conference.
The only question this year is de
fense. Last year the Cardinal
ranked last in the conference
against the pass and gave up
touchdowns faster than Elway
and company could score. This
year, new defensive coordinator
Larry Mac Duff. moved All-

America candidate Vaughn Wil
liams from stone to free safety
and it seems to have payed
di\ idends. Last Saturday, Stan
ford held Purdue quarterback
Scott Cambell, who ranked sixth
nationally in passing last year, to
)ust 12 completions in 29 at
tempts and three interceptions. If
the Purdue game was no fluke
and the defense keeps improving
it could be a rosy season on the
farm. Unfortunately, Stanford is
victimized by one of the nations
most difficult schedules and lacks
depth, especially in the offensive
line. If everybody stays healthy,
however, the Cardinal will defi
nitely go to some bowl game.
2. Washington The Huskies
seem to have it all this year. With
17 starters returning from last
seasons victorious Rose Bowl
team, Washington is everyones
pick to win the Pac-10 and is
ranked No. 1 nationally by the
Associated Press. Don James has
consistently proven that he is one
of the best coaches in the game
today and has depth at all posi
tions. Tailbacks Ron Jackson
(623 yards, 3.9 average in 1981)
returns along with Rose Bowl

MVP Jacque Robinson. Junior
quarterback Steve Pelluer will be
throwing to the talented wide re
ceiver tandem of Anthony Allen
and Aaron Williams. Washing
ton is also aided by an easy sched
ule. Their non-conference oppo
nents are a less than formidable
crew San Diego State, Texas-
El Paso and Texas Tech and
the Huskies also don't have to
play USC this year.
3. USC The Trojans once
again field a talented crew but
lack motivation due to their re
cent NCAA suspension. USC did
not look sharp in their first game
against Florida and sorely missed
Heisman Trophy winner Marcus
Allen. They hope to make up for
it this year by relying on the arm
of sophomore quarterback Sean
Salisbury. The Trojans return
nine offensive starters and seven
on defense and many feel could
have five legitimate All-America
candidates. Their strenth again
should be its offensive line with
massive guard Bruce Matthews
(6-foot-5, 260), tackle Don
Mosebar (6-7, 275), and center
Tony Slaton (6-4, 250) leading
the way. â–  > .

4. UCLA UCLA returns 16
starters from a team that was just
one game away from going to the
Rose Bowl. Led by running back
Kevin Nelson Darrin's
brother the Bruins again will
field a top quality team. De
fensive tackle Irv Eatman leads
an excellent defensive line, while
cornerbacks Jimmy Turner and
Lupe Sanchez are part of a stand
out secondary. UCLA will be vic
timized, however, but a tough
schedule, missing Oregon State
in the Pac-10 while meeting
Michigan and Wisconsin in non
conference action.
5. Washington State Not
taking away anything from the
Cougars Cinderella season last
year when they went 8-3-1, but
they did sneak up on a lot of peo
ple. This year their opponents
will be ready for coach Jim
Waldens multiple offense and
two quarterback shuffle system
with Clete Casper and Ricky
Turner alternating duties. Run
ning back Tim Harris (931 yards
in 1981) returns along with six
other offensive starters but the
defense was decimated by gradu
ation.. Only four of last years
starters, are . returning., .Like,,

Washington, the Cougars do
have the advantage of a fairly
easy schedule, avoiding both
USC and Arizona State in con
ference plav.
The bottom five The Arizo
na Slate offense was hurt by
graduation and only returns
three starters this season. Gone is
quarterback Mike Pagel and run
ning backs Robert Weathers and
Gerald Riggs. Although the de
fensive unit will be solid with
eight starters returning, it will
take the Sun Devils several games
to gel offensively. Neither Arizo
na nor Oregon is partiuclarly in
teresting and both should finish
in the bottom half of the con
ference. That leaves Calfomia
and Oregon State. Bear coach
Joe Kapp has gotten more ink re
cently than President Reagan but
that does not mean he can coach.
Even if he can work miracles,
with Cal's talent, the Bears won't
break the top five. Finally there's
old, predictable Oregon State.
Maybe the Beavers should work
a trade with San Jose State and
get out of the Pac-10. They don't
belong in the conference and will
be lucky to. win a single con
. . . fierence-game.... .\
