# Jekyll becomes Hyde in Card secondary
## 
### MARK ZEIGLER 
At a slight 6-3, 190 pounds,
Vaughn Williams appears to be
just another student at Stanford.
His calm, reserved demeanor
draws a mental picture of any
- thing but a hard-hitting free safe
ty on the football team.
Put him in a pair of pads and
it's a different story.
Williams, Stanford's leading
tackier last season, has literally
caused nightmares for opposing
receivers to the tune of "No
coach, not another slant pat
tern."
The hard-hitting junior is one
of the kevs to Stanford's de
fensive success this year. As a
sophomore, Williams was Stan
ford's first defensive First Team
All-Pac-10 player since Gordy
Ceresino in 1978 and is undoub
tedly an All-American candidate
in 1982. The Associated Press
named him Honorable Mention
All-America last vear.
Williams is of such importance
to the Cardinal's defense not be
cause he intimidates, but because
he reacts so quickly to the ball.
To make room for junior strong
safety Charles Hutchings, Wil
liams has been moved to free
safety from strong saftey, where
he has started for the last two
vears.

Although reducing his op
portunities to tackle, "force
plays," and blitz, Williams suc
cessfully applied his excellent re-
Ilexes to the pass in his debut at
free safety last Saturday an in
terception, a fumble recovery
and superb pass coverage.
"When you play against the
run (at strong safety), you get
used to people coming at you.
But at free safety, vou can't go
and get them," he said, pointing
out the difference between the
two positions.
"When vou're in that position
of being the last line of defense (at
free safety), there is extra em
phasis on vour open field tackl
ing," he continued.
Head coach Paul Wiggin
speaks highly of Williams as a
natural plaver at his position:
"He's a tvpical moster man at

safety. He can hit like a line-'
backer and move like a defensive
back and that's what makes
him a great one."
Though some opposing re
ceivers might have ideas of their
own, Williams does not look
upon himself as an intimidating
force on the gridiron. He is quick
to separate himself from the Jack
Tatum headhunting school of de
fensive backs, noting that he nev
er seriouslv hurt a player in his
career.
"If you go out to hurt players,
you're not playing football,"
Williams said, who is adamantly
opposed to illegal tackling tech-'
niques. When tackling, "I put my
pads on his pads and my number
on his number."
What's amazing about Wil
liams, majoring in business and
engineering, is how he can be so
collected off the field and so in
tense on it a true Jekyll-and-
Hvde story. "When you put the
pads on, you don't put them on
for nothing," he said.
Before putting them on, Wil
liams does nothing special to
psyche up. "I don't bang mv head
against lockers or anvthing," he
explained. "1 put mv uniform on,
stretch out, drink some liquids
and when the damn whistle
blows. . . ."
The Cardinal free safety at
tributes the marked improve
ment of the youthful secondary
(two juniors and two
sophomores start) from last year
to practice and exposure. Al
though the Card defense held its
own against the run last season, it
ranked last stopping the pass,
giving up an average of 219.2
yards a game through the air.
In last weekend's opener, Wii
liams and Co. allowed
Boilermaker quarterbacks to
complete just 17 of 37 passes for
194 vards and one touchdown
while intercepting three Scott
Campbell passes; Hutchings had
a fourth pick-off that was called
back due to a roughing the passer
penalty. Campbell ranked sixth
in the nation among passers in
1981.
Coming off an excellent first

game, Williams said the secon
dare would not prepare specially
for San Jose State, a team known
for its short, imaginative passing
attack.
"We know thev are going to
throw, thev know thev are going
to throw and evervone in the sta
dium knows thev are going to
throw." Williams said.

Looking ahead into the free
safety's career, Ail-American sta
tus is highlv likely. But what
about pro ball? "I definitely have
to get stronger. But that's a sub
ject I've given little thought to"
he explained. "Four and seven is
a big distraction to thinking
about the future."
In fact, Williams doesn't even

like to predict Stanford's chances
this season. "I believe we will get
what we earn. If we play well
enough we deserve the best." But
for now. it's just one game at a
time. That simple.
"Evervbodv gets the same
treatment. Evervbodv gets the
same amount of intensity on a
hit."

NICE GUY VAUGHN WILLIAMS: Around campus, free safety Vaughn Williams is known as
a quiet person and serious student, but on the football field, the monster comes out. An All-Ameri
ca candidate, Williams did nothing to live down his reputation last week against Purdue, intercept
ing a pass, recovering a fumble, and making big plays all over the field.
