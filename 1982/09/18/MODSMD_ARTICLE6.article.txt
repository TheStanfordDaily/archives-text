# Elways conclude final chapter on farm
## 
### ADAM BERNS 
The fourth and final chapter of
the Jack and John Elway show
ends today as father goes against
son for the last time. San Jose
State coach Jack Elway who has
gone 1-2 against Stanford would
like to even the score and prove
that father knows best but
Cardinal quarterback John
Elway and Stanford's vastly im
proved defense are coming off a
big win and would like nothing
better than to avenge last seasons
28-6 loss its worst ever against
the Spartans.
In the last three years the Stan
ford-San Jose State game has had
special significance because of
the often overplayed rivalry of
father going against son. Because
of the awkward nature of the
game some might think that
Stanford coach Paul Wiggin is
glad that the rivalry is finally
coming to an end, but in fact its
just the opposite.

"The bad news is that I still
have (Jack) Elway to coach
against but don't have John to
play against him," Wiggin joked
earlier this week.
Last week Stanford entered the
season as something of an un
known quantity. Sure they ended
the 1981 season with three
straight victories, but would the
momentum carry through this
year? Even more important,
would Stanford finally find a de
fense to go along with Elway and
friends on offense?
If last week is any indication,
the Cardinal not only proved that
last season's end of the year wins
were not only legitimate, but that
it has found a defense as well.
Last year against San Jose
State, John Elway had the worst
outing of his collegiate career
completing just six of 22 passes
for 72 yards while hobbling on an
ankle injury and ruining his
Heisman Trophy chances.
"I'm not going to say my bad
leg had anything to do with it,"
Elwav said last week. We came
out flat and I don't want to take
anv credit awav from San Jose

State."
Against Purdue last week,
Elwav not only completed 29 of
36 passes for 333 yards and four
touchdowns but also escaped the
game unscathed. Wiggin feels
that Elway, chosen as the Pac-10
player of the week, put in the best
performance of his collegiate ca
reer.
"John did everything he does
so well," Wiggin said about last
weeks performance. "Not only
was he using the audible but he
was also recognizing things on
the field. His use of the audible
was incredible. The total per
formance of a quarterback was
the best we've seen from John."
Although Elway was superb,
there is more to the offense.
Before Stanford fans could pull
out their handkerchiefs to mourn
the loss of Darrin Nelson, run
ning back Vincent White proved
that reincarnation can indeed
happen. White rushed for 97
yards on 14 carries and caught 11
passes for 124 yards moving
himself to seventh on the
Cardinal career rushing list and
eight in pass receiving.
Last weeks 35-14 victory at
Purdue was Stanford's fourth
straight. In that time, the offense
has averaged 582.5 yards of of
fense a game and 41.5 points.
"Saturday was a real big win,"
Elwav said this past week. "It
was the biggest win "for us since
I've been here because what hap
pened last year. It was important
for us to get off on the right
foot."
The big surprise, however, was
defense where Stanford stymied
highly regarded Scott Campbell
who was just 12 of 29 for 139
yards and three interceptions.
The secondary which last year
ranked last in the Pac-10 is vastly
improved and the switch of
Vaughn Williams from strong to
free safety seems to have paid off.
"Our secondary in general was
outstanding," Wiggin said earlier
this week. "It's one game, but
one helacious game."
Today's game against San Jose

State poses different problems
than last week. While Stanford
was able to shut down Campbell
by its big pass rush and often sent
linebacker Garin Veris in on
blitzes, such a stategy would be
ineffective against the Spartans.
"It will be more difficult put
ting on a big pass rush because of
San Jose State's quick passing
game," Wiggin explains. " He
(Jack Elway) is a master of the
quick game and of divergenary
football. I don't think you'll see
many sacks."
Last Saturday San Jose State
beat Oregon 19-13 in a game
which should not have been as
close as the score indicated. The
Spartan defense did not allow a
single point with both Oregon
scores coming on special teams
a blocked punt and punt re
turn.
Unlike Purdue's untested sec
ondary, the Spartans boast two
of the best cornerbacks in college
football in All-America can
didates Ken Thomas and Gill
Bvrd and are one of the only team
in the country that can con
sistently play man-to-man cov
erage.

On offense, although the
Spartans will certainly miss the
talents of running back Gerald
Wilhite, Jack Elway's offense is
always full of surprises.
The Stanford secondary will
get one of its most difficult test of
the season against Spartan quar
terback Steve Clarkson. Last
week against Oregon, Clarkson
went 21 -of-36 for 197 yards as is
one of the best quarterbacks in
the nation, finishing last season
fifth in total offense.
Perhaps even more important
for the Stanford defense is how it
deals with the quick passes to the
backs. Last year Gerald Wilhite
consistently burned the Cardinal
on those types of plays and its im
portant for the Stanford line
backing crew to do a better job
against it this year.
Jack Elway would like to have
a repeat of last seasons success
against Stanford but admits that

it will be more difficult this time
around.
"They have a balanced at
tack," Elway explains about the
Cardinal offense. "Defensively
they are flying all over the foot
ball field. There isn't any ques
tion that overall they are a better
football team."
Family Feuds
In this last chapter of the
Elway versus Elway saga, neither
Jack nor John has lost their sense
of humor.
"It seems like it is getting easier

every year because my wife (Jan)
is still talking to me," Jack Elway
quipped at a press conference last
Tuesday.
John responds by lamenting
the loss of support by his two sis
ters Lee Ann is a recent San
Jose State graduate while Jana
currently attends the school. He
believes, however, that everyone
in the family is not against him.
"I've lost two sisters but
gained a mom," Elways says in
analyzing this family affair.

Elwav said this past week. "It
was the biggest win "for us since
I've been here because what hap
pened last year. It was important
for us to get off on the right
foot."
The big surprise, however, was
defense where Stanford stymied
highly regarded Scott Campbell
who was just 12 of 29 for 139
yards and three interceptions.
The secondary which last year
ranked last in the Pac-10 is vastly
improved and the switch of
Vaughn Williams from strong to
free safety seems to have paid off.
"Our secondary in general was
outstanding," Wiggin said earlier
this week. "It's one game, but
one helacious game."
Today's game against San Jose

State poses different problems
than last week. While Stanford
was able to shut down Campbell
by its big pass rush and often sent
linebacker Garin Veris in on
blitzes, such a stategy would be
ineffective against the Spartans.
"It will be more difficult put
ting on a big pass rush because of
San Jose State's quick passing
game," Wiggin explains. " He
(Jack Elway) is a master of the
quick game and of divergenary
football. I don't think you'll see
many sacks."
Last Saturday San Jose State
beat Oregon 19-13 in a game
which should not have been as
close as the score indicated. The
Spartan defense did not allow a
single point with both Oregon
scores coming on special teams
a blocked punt and punt re
turn.
Unlike Purdue's untested sec
ondary, the Spartans boast two
of the best cornerbacks in college
football in All-America can
didates Ken Thomas and Gill
Bvrd and are one of the only team
in the country that can con
sistently play man-to-man cov
erage.

On offense, although the
Spartans will certainly miss the
talents of running back Gerald
Wilhite, Jack Elway's offense is
always full of surprises.
The Stanford secondary will
get one of its most difficult test of
the season against Spartan quar
terback Steve Clarkson. Last
week against Oregon, Clarkson
went 21 -of-36 for 197 yards as is
one of the best quarterbacks in
the nation, finishing last season
fifth in total offense.
Perhaps even more important
for the Stanford defense is how it
deals with the quick passes to the
backs. Last year Gerald Wilhite
consistently burned the Cardinal
on those types of plays and its im
portant for the Stanford line
backing crew to do a better job
against it this year.
Jack Elway would like to have
a repeat of last seasons success
against Stanford but admits that

it will be more difficult this time
around.
"They have a balanced at
tack," Elway explains about the
Cardinal offense. "Defensively
they are flying all over the foot
ball field. There isn't any ques
tion that overall they are a better
football team."
Family Feuds
In this last chapter of the
Elway versus Elway saga, neither
Jack nor John has lost their sense
of humor.
"It seems like it is getting easier

every year because my wife (Jan)
is still talking to me," Jack Elway
quipped at a press conference last
Tuesday.
John responds by lamenting
the loss of support by his two sis
ters Lee Ann is a recent San
Jose State graduate while Jana
currently attends the school. He
believes, however, that everyone
in the family is not against him.
"I've lost two sisters but
gained a mom," Elways says in
analyzing this family affair.

NO CIRCUS FOR JOHN: Sports Information Director Bob
Rose insists that he will not allow Heisman Trophy candidate
John Elway to become the subject of a "circus-type" of media
promotion.
The fourth and final chapter of
the Jack and John Elway show
ends today as father goes against
son for the last time. San Jose
State coach Jack Elway who has
gone 1-2 against Stanford would
like to even the score and prove
that father knows best but
Cardinal quarterback John
Elway and Stanford's vastly im
proved defense are coming off a
big win and would like nothing
better than to avenge last seasons
28-6 loss its worst ever against
the Spartans.
In the last three years the Stan
ford-San Jose State game has had
special significance because of
the often overplayed rivalry of
father going against son. Because
of the awkward nature of the
game some might think that
Stanford coach Paul Wiggin is
glad that the rivalry is finally
coming to an end, but in fact its
just the opposite.

"The bad news is that I still
have (Jack) Elway to coach
against but don't have John to
play against him," Wiggin joked
earlier this week.
Last week Stanford entered the
season as something of an un
known quantity. Sure they ended
the 1981 season with three
straight victories, but would the
momentum carry through this
year? Even more important,
would Stanford finally find a de
fense to go along with Elway and
friends on offense?
If last week is any indication,
the Cardinal not only proved that
last season's end of the year wins
were not only legitimate, but that
it has found a defense as well.
Last year against San Jose
State, John Elway had the worst
outing of his collegiate career
completing just six of 22 passes
for 72 yards while hobbling on an
ankle injury and ruining his
Heisman Trophy chances.
"I'm not going to say my bad
leg had anything to do with it,"
Elwav said last week. We came
out flat and I don't want to take
anv credit awav from San Jose

State."
Against Purdue last week,
Elwav not only completed 29 of
36 passes for 333 yards and four
touchdowns but also escaped the
game unscathed. Wiggin feels
that Elway, chosen as the Pac-10
player of the week, put in the best
performance of his collegiate ca
reer.
"John did everything he does
so well," Wiggin said about last
weeks performance. "Not only
was he using the audible but he
was also recognizing things on
the field. His use of the audible
was incredible. The total per
formance of a quarterback was
the best we've seen from John."
Although Elway was superb,
there is more to the offense.
Before Stanford fans could pull
out their handkerchiefs to mourn
the loss of Darrin Nelson, run
ning back Vincent White proved
that reincarnation can indeed
happen. White rushed for 97
yards on 14 carries and caught 11
passes for 124 yards moving
himself to seventh on the
Cardinal career rushing list and
eight in pass receiving.
Last weeks 35-14 victory at
Purdue was Stanford's fourth
straight. In that time, the offense
has averaged 582.5 yards of of
fense a game and 41.5 points.
"Saturday was a real big win,"
Elwav said this past week. "It
was the biggest win "for us since
I've been here because what hap
