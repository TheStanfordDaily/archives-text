# Heisman approach kept low – key
## 
### LISA STERN 
How does a university or col
lege campaign for its Heisman
Trophy candidate? Should it
campaign at all? These are the
questions which sports informa
tion director Bob Rose will face
this Fall as senior Cardinal quar
terback John Elway becomes a
candidate for the Heisman hon
or.
Stanford is taking a cautious
but optimistic approach in pro
moting Elway. Much of the cam
paigning will be done later this
season providing that the team as
a whole is successful.
As Rose explains, "We don't
plan to put out any brochures on
John unless the team is doing
well. They must get off to a good
start."
. The Stanford athletic depart
ment will follow this strategy ibe

cause it believes that the team's
record has substantial influence
on the voters. A candidate on a
team which does not post a win
ning record is at a distinct disad
vantage in the balloting.
"Last year," Rose said, "John
was hurt by the team's general in
experience. "For John to win,
other players must also have
good seasons."
Should the Card turn around
last year's disappointing 4-7
mark, Rose said that he envisions
a brochure which would focus
primarily on Elway's ac
complishments on the football
field.
"There is no way to justify a
circus type of promotional cam
paign," Rose maintained, "and
we will not blow this Heisman
thing out of proportion,
i * i i'Of .course,?'• h« 'oontinuedp *

"we will provide and distribute
information which will undoub
tedly indicate that John should
be placed in the Heisman can
didate category."
Rose also indicated that he
would use quotes from coaches,
pro scouts, the media, and other
football personnel in a press
guide and other releases. He said
that he believes these remarks
will best emphasize Elway's tal
ent.
"I would hope to create a me
dia which is well-versed on the
subject of John Elway. Many
have called him the top quarter
back prospect in the country and
he is expected to be the No. 1
draft choice next year in the
NFL. I want the press to be famil
iar with these impressions of
John." f

DARRIN?: Senior running back Vincent White looked like
Darrin Nelson last Saturday as he ran for 97 yards on 14 carries
and caught 11 passes for 124 yards. White currently leads the
nation in receiving, and coach Paul Wiggin expects great things
from his 5-foot-8,190 pound halfback.
