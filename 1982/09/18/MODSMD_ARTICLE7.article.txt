# Heisman approach kept low – key
## 
### LISA STERN 
How does a university or col
lege campaign for its Heisman
Trophy candidate? Should it
campaign at all? These are the
questions which sports informa
tion director Bob Rose will face
this Fall as senior Cardinal quar
terback John Elway becomes a
candidate for the Heisman hon
or.
Stanford is taking a cautious
but optimistic approach in pro
moting Elway. Much of the cam
paigning will be done later this
season providing that the team as
a whole is successful.
As Rose explains, "We don't
plan to put out any brochures on
John unless the team is doing
well. They must get off to a good
start."
. The Stanford athletic depart
ment will follow this strategy ibe

cause it believes that the team's
record has substantial influence
on the voters. A candidate on a
team which does not post a win
ning record is at a distinct disad
vantage in the balloting.
"Last year," Rose said, "John
was hurt by the team's general in
experience. "For John to win,
other players must also have
good seasons."
Should the Card turn around
last year's disappointing 4-7
mark, Rose said that he envisions
a brochure which would focus
primarily on Elway's ac
complishments on the football
field.
"There is no way to justify a
circus type of promotional cam
paign," Rose maintained, "and
we will not blow this Heisman
thing out of proportion,
i * i i'Of .course,?'• h« 'oontinuedp *

"we will provide and distribute
information which will undoub
tedly indicate that John should
be placed in the Heisman can
didate category."
Rose also indicated that he
would use quotes from coaches,
pro scouts, the media, and other
football personnel in a press
guide and other releases. He said
that he believes these remarks
will best emphasize Elway's tal
ent.
"I would hope to create a me
dia which is well-versed on the
subject of John Elway. Many
have called him the top quarter
back prospect in the country and
he is expected to be the No. 1
draft choice next year in the
NFL. I want the press to be famil
iar with these impressions of
John." f

DARRIN?: Senior running back Vincent White looked like
Darrin Nelson last Saturday as he ran for 97 yards on 14 carries
and caught 11 passes for 124 yards. White currently leads the
nation in receiving, and coach Paul Wiggin expects great things
from his 5-foot-8,190 pound halfback.
The last college quarterback to
receive the Heisman Trophy,
which recognizes the most out
standing collegiate player, was
Auburn's Pat Sullivan who won
the honor in 1971. Former Stan
ford quarterback Jim Plunkett,
who received the trophy in 1970,
is the only Cardinal to ever bring
the Heisman back to the farm.
Rose said that he believes that
this vear dubbed by the media
as the "Year of the Quarterback"
the Heisman Trophy voters
might be inclined to cast their
votes for a quarterback prospect.
"In the past decade, it was eas
ier to be successful as a running
back because the great football
programs around the country ran
powerful rushing offenses," Rose
explained.
Recently, however, many col
lege offenses have begun to in
corporate a more balanced of
fensive approach in their game

stategies. "The time is now for a
quarerback to win the award,"
Rose said, "because America is
once again becoming intrigued
with the quarterback. John
Elwav is definitely the prototype
quarterback."
Elway has -been portrayed by
the media as the "Ail-American
Kid" an athlete who possesses
not only the size, speed, and arm
of an outstanding quarterback
but also the character and in
telligence of an outstanding lead
er.
"The quarterback is viewed in
a different context from the run
ning back because he is the team
leader," Rose explains. "The
quarterback receives the credit
for a good season or the blame
for a bad season."
But how will the media pres
sure and attention that surrounds
a Heisman candidate affect
Elwav's performance on the
field?
"John has experienced pres
sure before," Rose notes, "and
his senior year will be no dif
ferent. As a junior he was bom

barded by the media and this
summer (playing baseball for a
New York Yankees farm club) he
was again exposed to a lot of
press coverage. Bv now John is a
seasoned veteran of publicity. He
can put it awav when he walks
onto the football field."
Rose did emphasize that any
promotion for Elway as a
Heisman candidate would be
toned down to suit the Card
quarterback's personality.
"John is a private, shy individ
ual," Rose said. "He does not en
joy all the media hype. He chose
this university because he be
lieved it would offer him a happy
college experience. We therefore
do not want to lose sight of John
as an athlete or as a person by
creating a huge promotional
campaign."
But will this stategy pay off?
"I may be naive," Rose an
swered, "but if the Heisman vot
ers cast their ballots for the merit
of each player, as 1 believe they
do, John has a great chance of
winning."

"John has experienced pres
sure before," Rose notes, "and
his senior year will be no dif
ferent. As a junior he was bom

barded by the media and this
summer (playing baseball for a
New York Yankees farm club) he
was again exposed to a lot of
press coverage. Bv now John is a
seasoned veteran of publicity. He
can put it awav when he walks
onto the football field."
Rose did emphasize that any
promotion for Elway as a
Heisman candidate would be
toned down to suit the Card
quarterback's personality.
"John is a private, shy individ
ual," Rose said. "He does not en
joy all the media hype. He chose
this university because he be
lieved it would offer him a happy
college experience. We therefore
do not want to lose sight of John
as an athlete or as a person by
creating a huge promotional
campaign."
But will this stategy pay off?
"I may be naive," Rose an
swered, "but if the Heisman vot
ers cast their ballots for the merit
of each player, as 1 believe they
do, John has a great chance of
winning."
How does a university or col
lege campaign for its Heisman
Trophy candidate? Should it
campaign at all? These are the
questions which sports informa
tion director Bob Rose will face
this Fall as senior Cardinal quar
terback John Elway becomes a
candidate for the Heisman hon
or.
Stanford is taking a cautious
but optimistic approach in pro
moting Elway. Much of the cam
paigning will be done later this
season providing that the team as
a whole is successful.
As Rose explains, "We don't
plan to put out any brochures on
John unless the team is doing
well. They must get off to a good
start."
. The Stanford athletic depart
ment will follow this strategy ibe

cause it believes that the team's
record has substantial influence
on the voters. A candidate on a
team which does not post a win
ning record is at a distinct disad
vantage in the balloting.
"Last year," Rose said, "John
was hurt by the team's general in
experience. "For John to win,
other players must also have
good seasons."
Should the Card turn around
last year's disappointing 4-7
mark, Rose said that he envisions
a brochure which would focus
primarily on Elway's ac
complishments on the football
field.
"There is no way to justify a
circus type of promotional cam
paign," Rose maintained, "and
we will not blow this Heisman
thing out of proportion,
i * i i'Of .course,?'• h« 'oontinuedp *

"we will provide and distribute
information which will undoub
tedly indicate that John should
be placed in the Heisman can
didate category."
Rose also indicated that he
would use quotes from coaches,
pro scouts, the media, and other
football personnel in a press
guide and other releases. He said
that he believes these remarks
will best emphasize Elway's tal
ent.
"I would hope to create a me
dia which is well-versed on the
subject of John Elway. Many
have called him the top quarter
back prospect in the country and
he is expected to be the No. 1
draft choice next year in the
NFL. I want the press to be famil
iar with these impressions of
John." f

DARRIN?: Senior running back Vincent White looked like
Darrin Nelson last Saturday as he ran for 97 yards on 14 carries
and caught 11 passes for 124 yards. White currently leads the
nation in receiving, and coach Paul Wiggin expects great things
from his 5-foot-8,190 pound halfback.
The last college quarterback to
receive the Heisman Trophy,
which recognizes the most out
standing collegiate player, was
Auburn's Pat Sullivan who won
the honor in 1971. Former Stan
ford quarterback Jim Plunkett,
who received the trophy in 1970,
is the only Cardinal to ever bring
the Heisman back to the farm.
Rose said that he believes that
this vear dubbed by the media
as the "Year of the Quarterback"
the Heisman Trophy voters
might be inclined to cast their
votes for a quarterback prospect.
"In the past decade, it was eas
ier to be successful as a running
back because the great football
programs around the country ran
powerful rushing offenses," Rose
explained.
Recently, however, many col
lege offenses have begun to in
corporate a more balanced of
fensive approach in their game

stategies. "The time is now for a
quarerback to win the award,"
Rose said, "because America is
once again becoming intrigued
with the quarterback. John
Elwav is definitely the prototype
quarterback."
Elway has -been portrayed by
the media as the "Ail-American
Kid" an athlete who possesses
not only the size, speed, and arm
of an outstanding quarterback
but also the character and in
telligence of an outstanding lead
er.
"The quarterback is viewed in
a different context from the run
ning back because he is the team
leader," Rose explains. "The
quarterback receives the credit
for a good season or the blame
for a bad season."
But how will the media pres
sure and attention that surrounds
a Heisman candidate affect
Elwav's performance on the
field?
"John has experienced pres
sure before," Rose notes, "and
his senior year will be no dif
ferent. As a junior he was bom

barded by the media and this
summer (playing baseball for a
New York Yankees farm club) he
was again exposed to a lot of
press coverage. Bv now John is a
seasoned veteran of publicity. He
can put it awav when he walks
onto the football field."
Rose did emphasize that any
promotion for Elway as a
Heisman candidate would be
toned down to suit the Card
quarterback's personality.
"John is a private, shy individ
ual," Rose said. "He does not en
joy all the media hype. He chose
this university because he be
lieved it would offer him a happy
college experience. We therefore
do not want to lose sight of John
as an athlete or as a person by
creating a huge promotional
campaign."

"I may be naive," Rose an
swered, "but if the Heisman vot
ers cast their ballots for the merit
of each player, as 1 believe they
do, John has a great chance of
