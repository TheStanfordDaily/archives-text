# Stanford recruits for depth
## 
### MARK ZEIGLER 
Though not landing as many
recruits in the national limelight
as in 1981, Stanford gathered a
promising bunch of "local kids"
for its 1982 football team.
Eight of 20 freshmen played
their high school ball just a short
car ride away from Stanford Sta
dium. Topping the list of
Northern California players is
wide receiver Kenny Williams
and NorCal Co-Defensive
Players of the Year George
Ebertin and Michael Noble, a
pair of linebackers.
Ebertin, of San Jose's Belle
rmine Prep, and Noble, from
Monta Vista High School in
Danville will help the Card fill its
biggest void linebacker a
position dessimated by gradu
ation. In all, head coach Paul
Wiggin and defensive coordi
nator Larry McDuff coaxed six
backers to attend Stanford this
fall.
"We had a better (recruiting)
year in numbers as far as line
backers. Last vear we recruited

some quality linebackers, but this
year we recruited in numbers,"
McDuff explained. He also noted
that the new crew of backers is
fast, improving the Card's over
all defensive team speed.
The most successful of the
frosh linebackers so far, how
ever, is an out-of-stater David
Wvman, Nevada's 1981 Player of
the Year and brother of
sophomore defensive tackle
Mike Wyman. The 6-foot-3, 235
pound Reno product is listed sec
ond on the depth chart at right in
side linebacker and saw con
siderable playing time in the
opener.
"We think he is going to be an
excellent college linebacker,"
McDuff said. "He has all the
physical tools."
Another freshman defender
who saw action against Purdue is
6-3, 225 pound noseguard Bob
Jansen, who tallied 93 tackles at
Pueblo South HS in Pueblo, Co.
as a All-State linebacker his sen
ior year. A former wrestler as
well, Jansen is learning the

noseguard position for the first
time and stands second behind
sophomore Terry Jackson in the
charts.
On offense, look to see frosh
receiver Kenny Williams in ac
tion; that is, if you can see him at
all. The speedster from Mt.
Pleasant HS in San Jose, has
clocked a 9.4 hundred and could
very well test the accuracy of
John Elway's distance tosses
before the season's out.
Offensive lineman Tom
Prukot, though not as fast as Wil
liams at 6-3, 220, may figure
quickly in the Card's scheme of
things considering the Card's
depth problem in that position.
The very physical Prukot was re
cruited as a linebacker, but was
switched to an offensive tackle
and has progressed during Au
gust to the point where he made
the traveling squad to Purdue.
Running back Stan Gill from
Flagstaff, Arizona could also
contribute this year. As a senior
the star back ran for 2000 plus
yards including 35 touchdowns.

YEAR OF THE LINEBACKER: Although Stanford's
freshman class does not include as many prep All-Americas as
last year, Cardinal coaches are impressed with its depth. No
where is this more evident than at linebacker, where Dave
Wyman (shown here) leads a talented crew.
