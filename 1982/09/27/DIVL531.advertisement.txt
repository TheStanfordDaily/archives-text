AAAS 105 Introduction to African
And Afro-American Studies
«- t MWF 11 Drake, Gibbs, Jackson, Wynter 60-61F
A new lecture course introducing African and Afro-American Studies as an
interdisciplinary field by exploring contrasting and contradictory interpretations of
several key, representative aspects of African and Afro-American social and cultural
institutions. Topics covered this quarter are:
1) the question of African survivals in the New World, - s
2) interpretations of slavery in the New World, j
3) contrasting interpretations of the Black family, I| I I J
4) the Afro-American as artist, *■■■■■■■ w
5) the Afro-American identity.
The course also considers why particular ideas developed at particular times and
examines the relationship between African and Alro-American Studies and other
academic disciplines.
Taught by a team of four Black faculty from varied departments, this collective
teaching approach should prove to be an exciting experience for majors and
non-majors alike.
