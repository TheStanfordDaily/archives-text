## The 						Stanford Daily Editor's introduction 
### 
This issue begins the 182 nd volume of the Daily,
and more than 90 years of publication have
prompted editors in first issues to invoke different
great gods of journalism. And so it is again: our
pages will, we hope, be fair and comprehensive
while reflecting what affects the University, and we
will strive in our writing to be intelligent, pro
vocative and informative.
Trying to achieve these goals, however, occupies
the days and, often, nights of scores of under
graduate and graduate students working for the
Daily. Yet because the Daily is a student-run, inde
pendent newspaper serving a university area, it has
a dual function unique among types of publica
tions: serving an incredibly complicated and di
verse community and training hundreds of students
interested in reporting, commentary, photography,
advertising and other management and journalistic
skills.
The newspaper's failings, which we are the first to
recognize, stem from this tension between educat
ing and informing, but this balance also prompts
the newspaper's great strength of your partici
pation. You — with ideas of what best serves Stan
ford — have the opportunity and, perhaps, obliga
tion to discuss with us how the Daily is run and es
pecially to participate in its operation.
We staff members never forget that the Daily is
your newspaper. Many of us work here to launch
journalistic careers, to meet personal challenges, to
learn or to find a sense of camaraderie, but working
to provide our readers with a paper of the highest
quality subsumes all these impulses. Put to use your
interest in any facet of the University: the news
paper is small enough to benefit from your sugges
tions and large enough to give you more work than
you might imagine.
One reason your participation matters is that the
great challenge of a college paper — or on a broader
level, any paper — is linking, synthesizing and re
porting the area's various policies and activities.
Only a few groups are similarly charged with ex
amining the community and providing the means
to evaluate forces and events affecting the Univer
sity: the board of trustees and administration, of
course, the ombudsman's office and, in its finer mo
ments, student and faculty government. Our writ
ing succeeds to the extent it describes the communi
ty and allows the reader to give meaning to the local
issues of the day. The process of evaluating and

analyzing those issues is then extended by the in
terpretive pieces appearing on these pages.
As suits a university area's newspaper, the Daily
succeeds when it links ideas and presents conse
quences of decisions. Our reporting attempts to
place immediate subjects within a broader realm of
University policies or activities and whenever pos
sible to show how those policies affect and reflect
national and international issues. We fail when we
leave an event in isolation or provide a conclusive
portrayal of a necessarily complex subject, and we
need your help to broaden our presentation of the
Stanford area.
What appears in the newspaper, then, is to a large
degree an attempt to define and, by defining, shape
our immediate world. If that motivation leads us to
define what is newsworthy by what is failure or dis
appointment, that description only occurs because
we are idealists at heart; we expect achievement
here to be the norm and are better able to see the
significance of sudden failure than of quiet
strengths. But these pages will, we hope, also reflect
what is entertaining or provoking and the successes
that shape the University as well as the disappoint
ments that mold its future.
With greater attention and resources directed
toward news coverage, critical reviews and our
opinions page, the Daily has a better chance than
ever of fulfilling these admittedly broad goals. Al
though financial problems restrict the newspaper as
they do other institutions, the Daily enters the new
volume with the most experienced and competent
staff I have seen in my time here. We will do our
damnedest.
As you read through the Daily this year, you will
be watching the efforts of students -who have
thrown themselves into participating in their sur
roundings. Your participation, or only ideas, can
redress any failings you believe exist in our cov
erage, commentary, humor or tone. You see the re
sults of our efforts each day. Our work, even at its
finest, can always be improved tremendously, and
we count upon you to help us with that improve
ment.
