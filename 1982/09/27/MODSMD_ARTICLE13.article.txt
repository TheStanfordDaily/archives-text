## Beirut massacre must be seen in historical context 
### 
The world shivered to learn that hun
dreds, perhaps 1000 or more Palesti
nians, unarmed and defenseless and in
cluding women and children, were
gunned down by so-called Christians in
Beirut refugee camps. The murderers
seem i j have been close, ethnically and
culturally, to their victims. They dif
fered only in politics, and the only
motive was hatred.
This wanton brutality comes atop
man: thrr inctd«;n*r 'n Central Amer
ica, 'i «;rs g ct *'V the customary
pace, odds arc that someone has been
destroyed during the time one spends
watching the television news. Many
thousands of persons have "disap
peared' 1 in such countries as Argentina
and Chile. Soviet troops or their Af
ghan helpers are reported to have an
nihilated villages not only by im
personal bombings but by personally
shooting the inhabitants. Boat people
are still being pushed out of Vietnam by
the thousands, mostly to die miserably
at sea. A few years ago, about a million
Cambodians were slaughtered because
they seemed inconvenient to their "rev
olutionary" masters — to have had a
modest education was a death warrant.
Many other mass killings arc hardly re
membered; for example, the some
200,000 people who were slaughtered in
Burundi in 1972 for belonging to the
wrong trible.

Modern humanity is inhumane.
Massacre is old hat, however. We have
to go back to World War II for gen
ocide on the grand scale, recalling that
the Nazis systematically did away with
some 6,000,000 persons. Less system
atically and over a longer period, Stalin
accounted for about four times as many
of his compatriots. Before modern to
talitarian ideologies were invented, the
Turks did away with about 600,000
Armenians in 1915. For really
grotesque behavior, perhaps the cham
pions were the armies of Genghis Khan,
which liked to build pyramids of hun
dreds of thousands of heads of persons
who failed to submit promptly, piles
that soon weathered into pyramids of
skulls.
It is an old custom, and one should
not be surprised that it goes on. Human
instincts do not necessarily change be
cause people live in the age of com
puters and satellites. We are not more
civilized in our inner nature than our
ancestors of thousands of years ago,
and we are just as capable of acting the
beast even if we wear jackets and ties.
There has been a change, however.
We of the advanced industrial countries
can congratulate ourselves that
massacre has become very largely a
Third World activity. The worst atroci
ty perpetrated by a Western power in

this generation was the My Lai killing
in 1968 in Vietnam, when American sol
diers liquidiated a hundred-odd per
sons — a paltry killing by world stan
dards. War also has been limited to the
poorer regions of earth for the last sev
eral decades, for the same general rea
son: greater instability along with a
multitude of territorial and political is
sues to be settled by violence. Although
humans have not changed, society has,
at least in some areas; and we would
presumably see no more wholesale
murders if only all countries could be
affluent and democratic.
That millennium is far away, but the
situation has improved in the Third
World as well as the First. We are im
pressed with the quantity of brutality
going on, but that is in large part be
cause the morning paper may bring
news of evil deeds from most of the
lands inhabited by the 4.5 billion in
habitants of this globe. We might re
main unaware of a holocaust some
where in the interior of the Soviet
Union or China, but even from such
countries reports would surely filter out
one day. The fact that the world
watches is doubtless a major reason
that the Soviet Union now deals quietly
with dissidents and avoids mass arrests
and outright murder. The detention of
an outspoken scientist is likely to re

ceive more attention today than the
death of a million people in Stalin's
time.
Publicity is the best enforcer of mo
rality. The frequency with which per
sons are taken away to be tortured and
then disposed of has dropped markedly
in Argentina, probably mostly because
of what was happening to the Argentine
reputation. Continual reporting has at
least put a damper on killings in El
Salvador, if only because the govern
ment must convince the U.S. Congress
that it is mending its way. After the
cameramen and reporters sent back the
sensational news of the Beirut
massacre, the Israeli government quick
ly registered acute pain and embarass
ment for the deeds of their Lebanese al
lies. The image of Israel, which had
gone into Beirut allegedly to keep or
der, has been blemished as never before;
even at home, thousands of Jews have
demanded the resignation of the Begin
government. The latter has promised to
prevent a repetition of the tragedy, and
we can well believe that it will do ev
erything possible to keep that promise.
Humans remain capable of all
manner of dastardly things, but human
ity suffers fewer gruesome massacres as
it sees more of them. This is one of the
few ways the world is getting better.
