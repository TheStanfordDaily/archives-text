## Social science restricts policy 
### 
Policy-makers, particularly since the
19305, have called on social scientists to
be social engineers, to tell them how to
accomplish their objectives. This de
mand has subjected social science to
evaluations of its ability to anticipate
specific outcomes. Social science can
not poseibly meet these expectations.
To evaluate the Findings of social sci
entists, we must recognize that the logic
and methods of their disciplines are like
those of the natural sciences. Both seek
to find general laws. But social science
hypotheses are commonly tested in our
complex world. Natural science
hypotheses usually are not. The social
scientists' efforts to project rela
tionships are more like those of an engi
neer, who can test his theory by isolat
ing the relevant factors in an ex
perimental setting.
The engineer, in building a bridge, a
plane or a rocket predicts the outcomes
of many different interactions. When he
calculates what has to be done, he adds
a "safety factor" which may involve
making a wall or other structure two or
three times as strong as the theory and
estimates require. Social scientists,
however, cannot add safety factors.
They can only point to a range of prob
ably errors in which they may be ac
curate. This range often involves the
difference between the success or failure
of a policy, or costs the outcome of an
election.
Political tension between social sci
entists and conservatives is inherent in
the different views each holds about the
extent to which social processes are sub
ject to deliberate manipulation. Be
cause social scientists assume that re
liable scientific knowledge of society is
possible, they believe it is possible to
remedy social problems and injustices.
Hence, social scientists as a group tend
to support social planning.
Though social scientists, like all other
scholars, pride themselves on their ob
jectivity, there can be little doubt that
the changing emphasis in these dis
ciplines are affected by the larger politi
cal scene, particularly by what happens
within, and to, the left-liberal intellec
tual community.
The period since World War II until
the early years of the Johnson adminis
tration was marked intellectually by a

broad consensus for liberal social re
forms; the second period — from the
mid-'6os to the early '70s — was a time
of campus turmoil and the rise of the
New Politics, coincident with a conser
vative backlash in the country; the third
— the mid-'7os to the early '80s — is
characterized by the rise of the new con
servatism in the mid-'7os to its trium
phal presence in Washington in the ear
ly '80s.
The liberal political, theoretical and
methodoligical consensus of social sci
entists during the first two postwar dec
ades disintegrated with the protest era
of the '60s. From a political standpoint,
the liberal dominance within academe
was threatened from both the left and
right. Affected by the new radicalism,
some older scholars turned — or, more
commonly, returned — to leftist orien
tation. Others, perceiving a challenge to
democratic norms and academic values

The conservative reaction has been
strongest in economics, where Milton
Friedman's monetarism, neo-classical
microeconomics associated with Rob
ert Lucas, and most recently, supply
side economics identified with Arthur
Laffer, have secured considerable in
fluence as alternatives to Keynesian ap
proaches. The latter lost influence, not
only because liberalism declined in
tellectually, but also because the econo
my of the late sixties and seventies did
not conform to Keynesian approaches.

but also because the economy of the late

The most influential younger econo
mists of the 1970s are largely supporters
of varying forms of anti-statist free
market, doctrines. They include, among
others, scholars such as Martin Felds
tein, Michael Boskin, Gary Becker,
Dale Jorgensen, Robert Hall and
Thomas Sargent. Their leading role
prompted one older recent president of
the American Economic Association to
complain that his field was now domi
nated by "young fogies."
Emphasizing the political orien
tations of social scientists and the ways
these are reflected in their research is
not meant to imply that they do not en
gage in rigorous scholarship, nor that
their empirical methods do not produce
objective findings, i.e., results that are
reproducible by other researchers using
comparable techniques. The over
whelming majority — left, center or
right in political outlook — are as ob
jective as natural scientists id thei|
scholarship.
If social scientists can deliver objec-3
tive answers to the questions thejl
analyze, does this mean that policy'
makers of diverse orientations can
make use of them? The answers given
by administrations from Roosevelt to
Reagan is "yes." All of them have made
extensive use of social scientists. Close
to half of Richard Nixon's cabinet
members were social scientists. Jimmy
Carter, as an engineer who believes in
"solutions" to problems based on sci
entific knowledge, turned to the experts
for scientific answers. The domestic
policies of the Reagan Administration
are influenced by the conclusions of ac
ademic publications, in this case of vari
ous monetarist and supply-side econo
mists oriented toward the free market.
The administration's policies on gov
ernment regulation of industry, school
busing, affirmative action and the pov

search of relatively conservative social
scientists. Given the magnitude of the
changes in government policy initiated
by Ronald Reagan, he is clearly staking
the future of his administration and the
Republican Party on the belief that
these scholars are right.

Emphasizing the political orien

these are reflected in their research is
not meant to imply that they do not en

If social scientists can deliver objec-3
tive answers to the questions thejl
analyze, does this mean that policy'
makers of diverse orientations can
make use of them? The answers given
by administrations from Roosevelt to
Reagan is "yes." All of them have made
extensive use of social scientists. Close
to half of Richard Nixon's cabinet
members were social scientists. Jimmy
Carter, as an engineer who believes in
"solutions" to problems based on sci
entific knowledge, turned to the experts
for scientific answers. The domestic
policies of the Reagan Administration
are influenced by the conclusions of ac
ademic publications, in this case of vari
ous monetarist and supply-side econo
mists oriented toward the free market.
The administration's policies on gov
ernment regulation of industry, school
busing, affirmative action and the pov
erty program are sustained by the re
search of relatively conservative social
scientists. Given the magnitude of the
changes in government policy initiated
by Ronald Reagan, he is clearly staking
the future of his administration and the
Republican Party on the belief that
these scholars are right.

Policy-makers, particularly since the
19305, have called on social scientists to
be social engineers, to tell them how to
accomplish their objectives. This de
mand has subjected social science to
evaluations of its ability to anticipate
specific outcomes. Social science can
not poseibly meet these expectations.
To evaluate the Findings of social sci
entists, we must recognize that the logic
and methods of their disciplines are like
those of the natural sciences. Both seek
to find general laws. But social science
hypotheses are commonly tested in our
complex world. Natural science
hypotheses usually are not. The social
scientists' efforts to project rela
tionships are more like those of an engi
neer, who can test his theory by isolat
ing the relevant factors in an ex
perimental setting.
The engineer, in building a bridge, a
plane or a rocket predicts the outcomes
of many different interactions. When he
calculates what has to be done, he adds
a "safety factor" which may involve
making a wall or other structure two or
three times as strong as the theory and
estimates require. Social scientists,
however, cannot add safety factors.
They can only point to a range of prob
ably errors in which they may be ac
curate. This range often involves the
difference between the success or failure
of a policy, or costs the outcome of an
election.
Political tension between social sci
entists and conservatives is inherent in
the different views each holds about the
extent to which social processes are sub
ject to deliberate manipulation. Be
cause social scientists assume that re
liable scientific knowledge of society is
possible, they believe it is possible to
remedy social problems and injustices.
Hence, social scientists as a group tend
to support social planning.
Though social scientists, like all other
scholars, pride themselves on their ob
jectivity, there can be little doubt that
the changing emphasis in these dis
ciplines are affected by the larger politi
cal scene, particularly by what happens
within, and to, the left-liberal intellec
tual community.
