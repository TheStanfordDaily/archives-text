## Kennedy encourages entering frosh, suggests intellectual exploration 
### KATHY OLMSTED 
Some aspects of freshmen orientation
never change.
Like Field Day. Like dorm parties. And
like University President Donald Ken
nedy's and Dean of Admissions Fred
Hargadon's speeches in Memorial
Auditorium.
Kennedy greeted the overwhelmingly
enthusiastic crowd of freshmen Thursday
night with some sage words on enjoying
life in general and Stanford in particular.
Kennedy urged the students to syn
thesize the academic and social aspects of
their lives, saying that he feared students
here often narrow their scope of intellec
tual exploration to the classroom and fail
to apply their knowledge to other pursuits.
"If I have anything to criticize about
Stanford's style,"it is that even some of the
most conscientious and devoted students
here fail to exteqti intellectual exploration
to the life they lead outside the classroom
and the library," he said.
Stanford is a school geared toward resi
dential education, Kennedy reminded the
crowd, and that means learning also
should take place outside the libary.

'Ifl have anything to
criticize about Stanford*s
style, it is that even some of
the most conscientious and
devoted students here fail to
extend intellectual
exploration to the life they
lead outside the classroom
and the library'

"The best parts of what you do here
may entail the sharing with others of new
insights and understandings. That should
go on in the residences as much as it goes
on in the seminar room," he said.
Stanford students should enjoy the

challenge of encountering differences,
Kennedy said. Noting that the entering
class has a larger proportion of blacks and
chicanos than ever before, Kennedy urged
the freshmen to confront differences in
other cultures, values and beliefs. He en
couraged them to "avoid the comfort of
the familiar" by occasionally taking risks.
"At Stanford," he said, "we believe that
confronting difference is valuable even —
perhaps especially — when it is painful."
But this confrontation of differences
doesn't always bring absolute results,
Kennedy said. Students must develop a
"tolerance for ambiguity."
Quoting from his Commencement
speech written for the graduation ceremo
nies last June, Kennedy stressed that life is
not always a confrontation between good
and evil, but more often between compet
ing goods — and that anyone who insists
he knows the only correct way is often

wrong. Even professors are susceptible to
error, Kennedy said.
"Remember one of the great Stanford
lessons: the textbook may be wrong, even
if the professor teaching the course did
write it,"he said.
Kennedy also urged the class of 1986 to
be self-reliant and to unabashedly commit
itself to causes it believes in.
"Being cool is really not so great .. .
there are all sorts of things in the world
that are much worse than being con
demned for overenthusiasm," he said.
Kennedy called the group of frosh "the
most remarkable freshman class ever to

enter Stanford," citing their higher test
scores and greater geographic diversity
than last year's freshmen class.
Kennedy also invited the members of
the audience to run and talk with him on
his daily jog. Realizing that some students
might feel hesitant about taking him up on
his offer, he encouraged them to join him
in front of his house one morning "if only
to win a bet."
The president advised the students to
read carefully the leaflets put out by both
the University and by the United Stanford
Workers (USW) on the USW strike here,
"I hope nobody will react strongly yet
to that situation," he said.

'The best parts of what you
do here may entail the
sharing with others of new
insights and
understandings. That
should go on in the
residences as much as it
goes on in the seminar
room.'

Dean of Admissions Fred Hargadon
preceded Kennedy with his standard
speech for orienting frosh.
Greeted with his annual standing ova
tion, Dean Fred launched into his custom
ary speech about how the freshmen were
admitted and what they could expect from
Stanford.
Noting that the newly admitted stu
dents often have differing reactions to the
news of their acceptance, Hargadon com
mented, "Some of you no doubt wondered
why it took us so long to do the obvious,
some of you may have wondered if we
made a mistake."
Hargadon assured the entering class
that everything written on their applica
tions was not taken literally. If it was, he
said, the Admissions Office would have to
believe that the university had "cornered
the market on saints."
