# Services for physically limited increase
## 
### KAREN SPRINGEN 
This year the University experienced a "quantum
leap in students who identified themselves as physi
cally limited," said Thomas Massey, associate dean
of student affairs coordinator for the committee of
services to physically limited students.
About 43 students, twice as many as last year, re
ceive individual assistance from the Dean of the Of
fice of Student Affairs (DOSA). Â»
Massey's committee, which consists of about 10
members from DOSA departments such as the Reg
istrar's Office, Residential Education and Cowell.
The committee began about five years ago, ac
cording to Massey. "It came together as a group to
react to what was going on on campus relative to
physically limited people." He said the group con
sists of everyone who is interested. "We make sure
that some of the representatives are from each unit
(such as the CPPC and Tresidder)," he said.

Campus ramps are designed for
more than bicycling
convenience. These "bike"
ramps were almost nonexistent
as recently as five years ago.

Massey stressed the individual attention given to
physically limited students, based on "what they
feel they need rather than a large bureaucracy.
"We will modify.. . When there's a particular
need we've done that," he added.
Mr.ssey said the quick increase in the number of
students requesting help is causing "some dif
ficulties in continuing quick services." But he
stressed, "We have enough to fulfill the needs of our
student population."
Physical limitations include hearing and seeing
impairments, food allergies, diabetes, arthritis and
respiratory ailments. The DOSA committee helps
the temporarily disabled in addition to the per
manently disabled.
Jan Lahr, a Cowell representative, said the com
mittee is investigating the image which the Univer
sity presents and pushing for more community
awareness. For example, the committee publishes a
guide for the physically limited here.
But perhaps the largest change in recent years has
been increased wheelchair access.
Campus ramps are designed for more than bicy
cling convenience. These "bike" ramps, and many
other special considerations for the physically lim
ited, were almost nonexistent as recently as five
years ago, according to Dana Bunnett, student co
ordinator of services to physically limited students.

Wheelchair access to dormitories is increasing
gradually, said Bunnett.
New residences were designed for wheelchair ac
cess. Storey House and the first floor of the new
housing will be accessible to wheelchairs.
Special additions for students restricted to wheel
chairs include showers with rails, equipped
restrooms and elevators.
Bunnett expressed disappointment with the lack
of elevators in the new houses. Without elevators,
students confined to wheelchairs are unable to visit
fellow dorm members on other floors.
The committee also helps reschedule classes on
the first floor to accommodate students in wheel
chairs.
Massey said the committee is looking beyond the
guidelines set by the federal legislature and setting
its own guidelines.
The admissions policy deserves credit for its
openness to the physically limited he said.
Physically limited students now seem "more easy
about identifying themselves," Massey concluded.
