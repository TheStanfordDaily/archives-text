# New application essay designed to exhibit creativity, priorities

Pretend for a moment that the dreaded earth
quake measuring 7.9 on the Richter scale finally
hits. You have a few minutes to leave your home —
just enough time to grab a few belongings. What do
you bring along?
As hypothetical as the situation seems, nearly
15,000 high school students will take this question
seriously in the coming months, since it may in
fluence their chances for acceptance to Stanford
next fall.
"If you were given sudden notice that you would
need to evacuate your home in minutes, what two or
three items would you first think to take with you?"
will be one of two essay questions on Stanford's ap
plication for undergraduate admission.
The second question, which has been a mainstay
on the Stanford application for the last few years,
asks the applicant to descibe tjje most influential
person or event in his life.
According to Fred Hargadon, dean of under
graduate admissions, coming up with effective
questions is not an easy chore. The question can't
sound tricky or superficially intellectual and must
not be the type that will be answered routinely. Tens
of thousands of similar responses to an application
essay can wreak havoc on an admission officer's
brain.
"What we hunt for is a question that doesn't have
a right or wrong answer and that's fun to write
about," Hargadon said.
Dean Fred didn't have to look far for the newest
question — not past his own television set, in fact.
"It occurred to me last January while watching
the flooding in Marin County and Santa Cruz (on
TV)," he explained. "And I thought to myself, what

would you do if you were in a similar situation?"
The "disaster" question will replace last year's
"historical" topic, where the applicant was asked
who he or she would most like to meet if they could
go back in history.
Although the essay questions are changed every
few years so that the admissions staff reading them
won't go "stale," removing the "historical" essay
after just one year was a bit premature.
"A lot (of applicants) would use the question to
almost remind us of their academic interests,"
Hargadon said. A person interested in physics, for
example, would single out Einstein as the person
with whom he would like to meet.

"They didn't relax on that question as much as
we thought they would," he continued. "They
tended to be fairly routine about the people they
mentioned."
Too many Einsteins, in other words.
The so-called adjective essay was used before the
historical essay. It asked the applicant to chose the
adjective that best described him. Variety was ob
viously not a problem considering the myriad of
words in the English language.
"The adjective question originally came from
The New Yorker magazine," Hargadon said.
Another objective Hargadon and company strive
for when creating the questions is to relax the appli
cant Hargadon pointed out that the application
itsel f takes a short time to complete, but a long time
to worry about.
"It gives the student a chance to write a short es
say," Hargadon said. "It's a hook, but an open
ended one."
