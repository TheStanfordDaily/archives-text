# Strike disrupts University life
## 
### JULIE KAUFMANN Senior staff writer 
Students can expect a lot of making
do this week, as management personnel
struggle to operate University services
at greatly reduced levels.
The 18-day-old strike of about 850
members of United Stanford Workers
has nearly shut down dormitory food
service, halted construction projects,
slowed deliveries and put Stanford po
lice on 12-hour shifts.
A skeleton crew at Operations and
Maintenance is responding to emer
gency repair calls only and trying to
jkeep the sewers unplugged and the
lawns and flowers watered, a spokes
man said.
"We have coordinators acting as
plumbers and electricians and watering
plants," he said. There are 35 managers
and office staff still at work in the de
partment, "but it seems like only four
. . . some people have been working sev
en-day weeks."
All 29 independent Row houses
opened on schedule Sept. 20, said Row
House Director Diana Conklin, but
some small projects were left un
finished. "They may not be beautiful,
but they will be open," she said.
Perl.aps hardest hit by the strike is
University Food Service. Food Service
Manager Maxine Anderson and 18 co
workers fed more than 1700 new stu
dents, RA's and orientation volunteers
during four days of orientation pro
gramming by "working long, long, long
hours," Anderson said.
Beginning today and continuing until
the strike ends, students on University
meal plans will receive weekly cash re
funds. Refunds for the 19 meal-per
week "A" plan, for example, will be $60
a week. Students can spend $1.50 for
breakfast and $3 for lunch at Wilbur,
where food service will operate four
serving lines, Anderson told the Daily.
Dinner will not be served.
"We hope people won't be too disap
pointed," she said. "We're doing the
best we can."

During the strike, food service can't
feed everyone, so Anderson is counting
on campus eateries and independent
student houses to help lake up the slack.
"The fraternities are being really great.
They'll be having lots of guests and tak
ing people in. Students are pretty good
survivors," Anderson said.
Tresidder Union Director Ellie Op
penheim expects to serve about 9500
meals, 2000 more than usual, during the
strike. "We have beefed up our services
in all areas," she said.
The Union Crossroads, Tresidder's
main dining facility, will feature pre
wrapped sandwiches and an extra cash
register to speed up service, Oppenheim
said, and pizza production at the Cor
ner Pocket will nearly double.
A grill on the Tresidder front patio
and a snack annex of the Store on the
back patio will operate at lunchtime.
Encina Station will operate with ex
tended hours, serving a $3.25 dinner
special Monday through Saturday, she
said.
"I would love to see the strike end
tomorrow," said Coffee House Man
ager Steve Weiss. "It's been a very dif
ficult situation, especially this time of
year when we're short on student staff."
Since the strike began, Weiss and his
staff have been starting early and
staying late. They've had to pick up
food and supplies which are usually de
livered, and, until Tresidder hired an
outside custodial service late last week,
they did their own cleanup as well.
Now, Weiss is gearing up to handle
the extra business the strike is expected
to bring. "We've talked to many RAs
(about) filling out order sheets in ad
vance. We will try to pre-make and pre
do everything," Weiss said.
He said he fears the Coffee House
may get too much of a good thing.
"Thousands of people have to go some
where to eat . . . It's going to be hairy.
Monday and Tuesday are going to be
14- and 15-hour days."
For dinner, some freshman dorms
have devised elaborate "eating group"

schemes. "We've divided them up into
five groups," said Trancos Resident
Fellow Ronald Rebholz. One group
will cook in the English professor's
kitchen, two groups will bike into Palo
Alto with an R.A. and two groups will
eat in co-ops.
The plan calls for the groups to ro
tate, so students will eat at a different
place each evening for a week.
Whitman House, a Cowell cluster
self-op, will serve a chicken dinner to
about 25 Twain and Trancos freshmen
and 60 house residents tonight. "We're
just going to spread out on picnic
tables," Food Manager Tina Bunch
said. "I guess most of the freshman
dorms are making it part of the
freshman experience."
The frosh will pay $4, approximately
the amount of their food service refund,
for dinner.
Visiting freshmen will get an authen
tic taste of co-op life at Phi Psi, where
they'll help co-op members with cook
ing or cleanup, said Food Manager
Maggie Prieto.
Although construction work on the
new housing project has resumed after a
short delay, several smaller projects

scheduled to be completed by the begin
ning of school remain unfinished be
cause of the strike, according to Con
struction Manager Don Hoppe.
Alvarado Row and Mayfield Avenue
are still torn up awaiting the installation
of new underground sewers; and the in
stallation of a water line at Florence
Moore Hall has been halted due to the
strike.
Path lighting projects at Wilbur Hall,
near Lasuen Mall and at Escondido Vil
lage have also been delayed by the
strike.
Campus police have posted guards at
the steam plant and the Center for In
formation and Technology, sites of
heavy picketing, said Stanford Police

Chief Marvin Herrington. "We've had
some incidents that may be connected
with the strike. There's been some tire
slashing and Aajls in the road, but main
ly we've had to go and make sure
pickets would part so trucks could get
through," he said.
Pickets have slowed deliveries to the
Stanford Medical Center and the Stan
ford Linear Accelerator, but both in
stallations are operating.
Another effect of the strike has been
to make students go off-campus for
phoneservice. Instead of the customary
on campus trailer, Pacific Telephone
has opened a temporary phone center at
420 Cowper St., Palo Alto. "All of the
dorms and row houses are already
equipped to plug in phones. If the
phone doesn't work, we have man
agement employees that will take care
of any problems," Community Rela
tions Manager Frank Riddle said.
