# Frosh interests varied

### MARK ZEIGLER 
If you're a freshman from the
East Coast interested in engineer
ing, you're not in as much a mi
nority at Stanford as you would
have been a year ago.
An annual survey by the Aca
demic information Center shows
that more students entering Stan
ford this fall have interests in nat
ural sciences, mathematics, tech
nology and engineering than in
recent years.
Conducted last spring, the sur
vey also shows an increase in
Eastern students â€” up four per
centage points from last year to
15 percent. The percentage of
Stanford freshmen residing in
California declined slightly, from
46 to 43 percent.
The freshmen class includes a
record number of blacks (141)
and chicanos (137), according to
the questionnaire.
The AIC administered the sur
vey last May, asking the then
high school seniors to return a
card indicating their preliminary
academic interest. All but 33 of
the 1617 freshmen expected to
enroll responded to the question
naire.
Though it reaps interesting re
sults. the survey indeed serves a
purpose other than curiosity.
"We match the freshmen to
advisors on the basis of academic
interest," Anne Coxon, director
of the AIC, said. But she is quick

to point out that the question
naire is "very informal" and that
students' interests can and do
change over the summer or dur
ing their stay at Stanford.
The AIC has conducted the
survey since 1972. In the last five
years, freshmen's interest in the
social sciences has dropped to
22.7 percent in 1982 from 29.5 in
1977. The Class of '86 contains a
much larger percentage of pros
pective engineers (22.7) than did
the Class of '77 (13.4).
The general trend away from
social sciences and humanities to
engineering, natural sciences,
math and technology is one that
Fred Hargadon, dean of under
graduate admissions, has ob
served closely.
"A lot of it (the trend) has to
do with the quality of courses
taught in high school,"
Hargadon ventured.
Hargadon also feels "signals
about jobs later on" help explain
this shift from letters to numbers.
"Humanities and social sciences
have to fight this uphill battle.
Parents ask their kids, what are
you going to do with an English
degree (when you graduate)?," he
continued.
As for the increased per
centage of Easterners, Hargadon
said, "it probably means that the
East Coast is beeoming a little
less provincial about the West
Coast."
