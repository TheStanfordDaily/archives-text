# Roommate pairing not just matching heights
## 
### KATHY OLMSTED 
Knowledgeable up
perclassmen often tell naive
freshmen that roommates are
matched according to height.
They say that the little white
card about academic interests
doesn't matter, that the questions
about extracurricular activities
don't matter — in fact, they say,
all that counts is that little nota
tion of feet and inches.
But like many rumors, this one
apparently has little basis in fact,
according to Norm Robinson,
dean of residential education.
Robinson said two students
hired by the Academic Informa
tion Center and by Residential
Education spent the summer por
ing over the housing preference
cards and information cards sent
in by freshmen, first assigning the
students to residences, then pair
ing roommates within the resi
dences according to academic
and personal characteristics.
Robinson said the.two workers
tried to match roommates who
could learn from and bu
challenged by one,another —
rather than to pair individuals
who appeared to be potential
best friends.
Stressing that living with an

other person should be a "broad
ening rather than a narrowing ex
perience," Robinson said that he
didn't believe in pairing room
mates who are "carbon copies"
of one another.
One of the students hired to
match roommates was Maggi
Keep, a recent Stanford gradu
ate. Keep and her partner, Dayna
Goldfine, put freshman in dorms
according to the preferences
listed on the housing preference

card. All-freshmen, co-ed-by
room dorms were the most popu
lar choices, Keep said, so many
students requesting this com
bination had to be content with a
second or third choice.
After assigning residences,
Keep and Goldflne set about
matching roommates within the
dorms.
Robinson said the two workers
principally tried to match Cali
fornians with non-Californians,

to pair people from a large urban
area with those from a more rural
background, to match students
with similar (but not too similar)
outside interests and to group
roommates with different aca
demic inclinations.
Keep stressed that these
criteria could not be met all the
time, but that she and Goldfine
kept these goals as a general ob
jective while making personal
judgments about specific pair
ings. She said they did take the
height and weight measurements
into consideration, but that vital
statistics were not primary con
cerns.
According to Keep, the time
spent on each dorm varied, but
she said a couple of hours per av
erage-sized dorm were necessary
for them to feel they had done a
good job.
Keep said it was "kind of a
scary feeling" making decisions
that will affect the quality of stu
dents' years here, but that she
thought it was a better and "more
personal" method than the mul
tiple choice scantron sheets used
by other schools.
It's definitely a better method
than matching by height.
