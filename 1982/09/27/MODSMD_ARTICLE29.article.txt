## Harry cradles game's clutch catch in waning moments Elway shells fatigued Buckeye defense 
### SID SPAETH 
Columbus, Ohio — John Elway
hammered 63 passes at a tiring
Ohio State defense, the finale a
17-yard floater to a wide open
Emile Harry in the end zone with
40 seconds remaining, giving
Stanford a 23-20 come-from-be
hind upset victory over the No.
12-ranked Buckeyes here Satur
day.
The touchdown pass high
lighted a seven-play drive in the
final two minutes after Ohio
State shocked Stanford with a
pass into the end zone from Stan
ford's 25-yard line. The ball was
tipped by Kevin Baird and
Charles Hutchings snatched the
ball and fell in the end zone.
It was the second interception
Ohio State threw in the final
minutes as they tried to run the
clock out with a four-point lead.
Elway reciprocated the first
time throwing a pass into the
arms of a linebacker he never saw
— Rowland Tatum.
"I was watching Dot (running
[ back Mike Dotterer)," Elway
said. "The tight end stayed in to
block so he (Tatum) was sup
posed to rush. My peripheral vi
sion didn't pick him up at all."

'Ididn't tell them
anything, but if you
heard a chant from
our bench, it was
"believe"'
— Paul Wiggin

'■■■: Stanford players began chant
ing "Believe" on the sideline
before the final chance.
|| Elway wheeled the final drive,
rifling shots to an array of re
ceivers in the unprotected middle
of a fatiguing Buckeye defense
that had been on the field nearly
the entire second half.
"We were able to pick up big
chunks," Elway said. "We didn't
think we'd be able to."
Coach Paul Wiggin said he was
surprised the Cardinal could
wear out the physical Buckeyes.
' "Usually Ohio State pounds
you for three quarters and then
destroys you in the fourth," Wig
gin said. "But we played them
tough and didn't give them the
drives."
Senior linebacker Gary Wim
mer led the defense with 15
tackles. The Cardinal intercepted
four passes, giving them two
more seasonal interceptions than
they had all of last year, and re
covered two fumbles.
Sophomore linebacker Garin
Veris forced Ohio State passes
late in the game with key
backfield sacks on first downs,

guards, blasting into the line in a
classic Big-10, three yards and a

rushed for 138 yards in the first
half, but improved on that by
only 38 yards for the game.
Keyed by a pair of portable
pillars at middle linebacker —
two-time All-Americas Marcus
Marek and Glenn Cobb — Ohio
State shut out the Stanford of
fense in the first half for the first
time since the 1979 USC game.
Marek finished with 20 tackles
and an interception.
But Elway, who was 35-for-63
for 407 yards and two touch
downs after a meak first half,
drove the Cardinal to two early
second half field goals by Mark
Harmon.
Ohio State, crippled by turn
overs in the second half, could
not get the ball, and their defense
repeatedly trudged back onto the
field after a short exchange.

When Elway hit Dotterer with
a 12-yard scoring strike to tie the
game with 3:35 remaining in the
third quarter, the Buckeyes had
run only four offensive plays in
the half.
Ohio State quickly regrouped,
however, and reclaimed the lead
midway in the fourth quarter
with a 63-yard flea flicker that set
up a touchdown.
Tomczak fired a screen to
flanker Vince Williams who was
recruited as a quarterback but
moved to flanker when he
popped up in the same recruiting
class as Art Schlichter. Williams
pulled up and lofted an ugly but
accurate pass to Cedric An
derson behind a startled Stanford
secondary.
Mark Harmon narrowed the
lead with a 47-yard field goal mo
ments later, his third after two
misses, and set the stage for
Hutchings's interception and the

dramatic final drive.
Neither Elway nor Wiggin
would speculate why Ohio State
opted to pass twice in the final
minutes when they had three ex
plosive backs to kill the clock.
"I told the defense they weren't
going to pass," Wiggin said. "1
told them to close in and try and
plug all the gaps."
The final touchdown came off
of an "improvisation," Dotterer
said.
"The way the touchdown
turned out wasn't the way it was
planned," Elway said. "It was a
waggle where I roll left. The
back, who was Dotterer, was
supposed to go to the corner, but
he brought it inside where Emile
was supposed to go. Emile saw it
and pivoted outside. I was sure
happy to see him."
"I'm supposed to go to the cor
ner and Emile's dropping
through the middle," Dotterer

explained. "The D back (de
fensive back Garcia Lane) must
have known it was coming so I
cut inside. When I go inside, ev
eryone follows me and Emile
drifts out there."
Wiggin said he did not tell his
team anything before the game
winning drive, but "if you heard
a chant from our bench, it was
'believe.' "
Trip Hardin, a walk-on who,
according to Wiggin, "had never
punted before," took over the
kicking duties from Greg Topp
who was averaging barely 34
yards a punt. Hardin shored up
the field position problem
averaging 41.3 yards on three
punts.
The nationally-televised game
was played in front of 89,436 fans
— the largest crowd ever to see a
game at Ohio Stadium — and
was the Buckeyes's 85th straight
sellout at home.
