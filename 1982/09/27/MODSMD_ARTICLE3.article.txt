Israel reveals pullback plans
Tel Aviv, Israel — Israeli troops will withdraw next Wednesday from
Moslem West Beirut and the international airport south of the Lebanese cap
ital, the military command announced yesterday.
The Foreign Ministry said the pullback from Christian East Beirut would
take a bit longer.
It was the first time Israel had set a date for a pullout from the Moslem
sector of Beirut. The announcement came a day after 400,000 Israelis at
tended the largest anti-government demonstration in Israel's 34-year his
tory.
Speakers at the rally called for full troop withdrawal from Beirut, the res
ignations of Prime Minister Menachem Begin and Sharon and a judicial in
quiry into the recent massacre of hundreds of Palestinian refugees in camps
guarded by Israelis.
An estimated 800 U.S. Marines had been scheduled to land in Beirut Sun
day to join French and Italian peacekeeping troops in an effort to help the
Lebanese government iwsert its authority. But U.S. special envoy Philip
Habib told Defense Minister Ariel Sharon on Saturday that the Marines
would not go ashore until Israel withdrew its forces from all of Beirut.
The White House issued a statement later saying, "We expect the U.S.
contingent to land soon after the Israelis complete their withdrawal follow
ing the intervening Yom Kippur holiday.
Israel's military command announced the withdrawal timetable a few
hours before the Jewish state shut down at sunset for the Day of Atonement,
the holiest day on the Hebrew calendar. Israel radio and television went off
the air in mid-afternoon, traffic cleared from the streets, Ben-Gurion airport
closed and devout Jews went to synagogue and began a day-long fast.
Begin agrees to massacre inquiry
Jerusalem — Amid deepening political trouble for his
defense minister, Ariel Sharon, Prime Minister Men
achem Begin was reported yesterday to be ready to give in
to demands that a state judicial board of inquiry be estab
lished to investigate the massacre of Palestinian refugees
in Israeli-occupied West Beirut.
Some of Begin's political associates, including the lead
ers of three parties in his government coalition, are de
manding such an investigation, and Justice Minister
Moshe Nissim said yesterday it appears the Cabinet will
have no choice but to agree to the high-level inquiry when
it meets tomorrow.
Begin was quoted yesterday as saying he had opposed
the convening of a state judicial board of inquiry, the
most powerful investigative panel allowed under Israeli
law, because such a panel should be reserved for "only
the most serious wrongdoing." He denies Israel bears any
responsibility for the massacre, but he was said today by
Israel radio to be on the verge of proposing a judicial
board of inquiry himself because of the dissension within
the Cabinet and the public pressure.
Meanwhile, speculation increased here that a judicial
board of inquiry could spell the beginning of the end for
Sharon, who is under renewed attack for recent com
ments that offended his subordinates in the military, the
political opposition and colleagues in the Begin Cabinet.
Sharon set off the uproar during a parliamentary de
bate last week when he asserted that when the opposition
Labor Party was in power in 1976 the Israeli Army played
some unspecified role in a massacre of Palestinian refu
gees by Lebanese Christian militia units at the Tal Zaatar
refugee camp in Beirut.
The accusation was vehemently denied by Labor Party
leaders who headed the government at the time and
prompted a retired Army general who was responsible
for contacts with the Christian militias also to deny it.
Reagan shelves summit plans
Washington — The Reagan administration, contend
ing that Soviet "mischief-making" is continuing in Po
land, Afghanistan and elsewhere, has all but written off a
summit meeting with Soviet President Leonid Brezhnev

in the near future.
Earlier this year, U.S. and Soviet leaders expressed
their interest in a summit. President Reagan invited
Brezhnev to meet with him in New York in June, and the
Soviet leader responded with a call for a summit in Eu
rope in October.
But now, U.S. officials said, talk of a summit within the
administration has all but vanished. The precondition set
by the White House in May — improvement in Soviet be
havior — has simply not developed, in the U.S. view, said
the officials, who asked not to be identified.
"The situation hasn't changed a lot," said one top of
ficial. He said the Soviets were still engaged in "mischief
making in Ethiopia, Angola, Central America, Afghan
istan, Poland, Vietnam and Kampuchea."
Hesse elections encourage Schmidt
Bonn, West Germany — Voters in the state of Hesse
gave strong support yesterday to the Social Democratic
Party in an election seen as a test for Chancellor Helmut
Schmidt, whose national coalition collapsed nine days
ago.
Schmidt's Social Democrats blocked the conservative
Christian Democratic Party from a predicted absolute
majority. The liberal Free Democrats, who quit
Schmidt's coalition Sept. 17, were left out of the state Par
liament for the first time since 1970.
Official results showed the Christian Democrats won
45.6 percent of the vote, or 52 seats, compared with 42.8
percent and 49 seats for the Social Democrats in the 110-
seat Parliament.
The environmentalist Greens received 8 percent, put
ting them into the Hesse legislature for the first time with
nine seats. The Free Democrats had only 3.1 percent, well
below the 5 percent required for parliamentary represen
tation.
Minor parties shared the remainder of the vote.
In the outgoing Parliament, the Christian Democrats
had 53 seats, the Social Democrats 50 and the Free Dem
ocrats seven.
Despite the strong showing for Schmidt's party —
some 10 percentage points higher than predicted in opin
ion polls — Christian Democrat leader Helmut Kohl and
Free Democrat Party chief Hans-Dietrich Genscher said
they would meet today to continue their effort to form a

new national coalition.
Franz-Josef Strauss, head of the Bavarian Christian
Social Union that is crucial to the plan to unseat Schmidt
through a vote Friday in the federal Parliament, said his
party leaders also would meet today to review the Hesse
results.
Gemayei appeals for free Lebanon
Washington — Lebanese President Amin Gemayei ex
pressed hope yesterday that all foreign forces would be
withdrawn from his country within a few weeks so that
Lebanon could get on with the task of rebuilding from the
devastation of war.
"Lebanon needs to recover its sovereignty and inde
pendence," said Gemayei, who was sworn into office last
week as Lebanon's new president. "You can't reach this
goal without obtaining the withdrawal of the Palesti
nians, the Syrians and the Israelis from Lebanon."
Gemayei said that the first step in any withdrawal
should be the pullback of foreign troops now in Beirut.
"The capital is actually an occupied land," he said. "We
have to recover our sovereignty in our capital and from
the capital we could begin discussions for the withdrawal
from all territory."
In a televised interview from Beirut on ABC-TV's
"This Week With David Brinkley," Gemayei also said
that he opposes any "artificial peace treaty" with Israel
although he is for "real peace" with all Middle Eastern
countries.
But, he said, it is premature to talk about a peace treaty
with Israel now because such a move would first have to
be considered by Lebanese government leaders and then
approved by the Lebanese parliament.
"For this reason, it is early to talk about this point," he
said. "But what I can assure you is that I am for the real
peace. We need to reach real peace, not an artificial
peace."
Gemayei said that President Reagan sent him a
message last week expressing his support for the sov
ereignty and independence of Lebanon and the with
drawal of foreign troops from that country.
"I hope he will succeed in giving us the real backing,"
Gemayei added. "It will be a major help and major effort
behind the Lebanese government and the new regime in
Lebanon."

Asked how long a total withdrawal of foreign forces
would take, Gemayel said, "I hope few weeks. 1 hope that
it will take few weeks."
Rainfall bursts dam in Sierras
Bishop, Calif. — At least eight homes washed away
when rains swelled creeks and streams in the Big Pine
area yesterday, and some 800 Bishop area residents were
allowed to return to their homes after being evacuated
when a dam burst at North Lake, officials said.
John Ferguson, of the state Department of Forestry
confirmed that eight houses and mobile homes had been
taken by flood waters, "and there could be a lot more" in
Big Pine, 14 miles south of Bishop.
Officials said early reports that flooding from North
Lake had swept houses away apparently were un
founded. But heavy rains did cause a breach in the
earthen Southern California Edison Co. dam that vir
tually emptied the small 13-acre lake located 25 miles
west of Bishop, Ferguson said.
"It took all of the dam. The lake is dry," he said.
About 200 homes, housing about 800 people, were
evacuated by police with bullhorns after word of the dam
rupture came about 9 a.m. yesterday morning, said Larry
Schwab of the U.S. Forest Service.
By 5 p.m. those people has been told they could return
home when it appeared the flood waters from the lake
would not endanger city residents and those in the outly
ing communities, officials said.
"We feel that highest part of crisis is over," Schwab
said early last evening. "Floodwaters have peaked and
are starting to recede." He said that North Lake was shal
low enough to walk across in most areas, perhaps per
mitting a more wide-ranging crisis to be averted.
The dam, built during World War I, had eroded gradu
ally during three days of mountain rains, emanating from
the hurricane Olivia out of Mexico, said U.S. Forest Ser
vice spokesman Ray Schaff.
