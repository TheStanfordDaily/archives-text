The Foreign Ministry said the pullback from Christian East Beirut would

It was the first time Israel had set a date for a pullout from the Moslem

guarded by Israelis.
An estimated 800 U.S. Marines had been scheduled to land in Beirut Sun
day to join French and Italian peacekeeping troops in an effort to help the
Lebanese government iwsert its authority. But U.S. special envoy Philip
Habib told Defense Minister Ariel Sharon on Saturday that the Marines
would not go ashore until Israel withdrew its forces from all of Beirut.

contingent to land soon after the Israelis complete their withdrawal follow

Israel's military command announced the withdrawal timetable a few
hours before the Jewish state shut down at sunset for the Day of Atonement,
the holiest day on the Hebrew calendar. Israel radio and television went off
the air in mid-afternoon, traffic cleared from the streets, Ben-Gurion airport
closed and devout Jews went to synagogue and began a day-long fast.
