## Bruce's blunder 
### 
Columbus, Ohio — Th row it
again Earle Bruce. Th row it
again because it might work.
Throw it again because they
don't expect it. Paul W iggin
said so.
Forget Tim Spencer.
Forget Vaughn Broadnax and
Jimmy Gayle. Forget y our
ramrod backs who had pun
ished Stanford tacklers all af
ternoon.

Sports analysis

Paul Wiggin told his tea; m
you are not going to throv /.
He said, "Try and plug th e
holes." He said "try."
And you threw, Earle
Bruce. And they hate you.
Ohio State's coach Earle
Bruce had only to run the
clock out to beat Stanford
Saturday. Run the clock out,
anyone will tell you that.

He had 2:46 to play and a
20-16 lead. He threw on sec
ond down and it was tipped.
Stanford's Kevin Baird
caught the tip and Stanford
could win.
But John Elwav didn't see
Rowland Tatum on the next
play and Tatum intercepted.
"I was watching Dot (run
ning back Mike Dotterer),"
Elway said. "He (Tatum) was
supposed to rush. My per
ipheral vision didn't pick him
up."
Earle Bruce had been saved
by a reserve junior linebacker.
Ohio State had the ball on
Stanford's 25-yard line with
1:50 to play. A field goal
should be plenty, but Ohio
States's running backs are
strong and can blast tacklers
and can get six.
Throw it again Earle Bruce.
Throw it again because they
don't expect it. Paul Wiggin
said so.
And he threw.
Ohio State threw the ball
into the end zone and Kevin
Baird tipped the pass and
Charles Hutchings in
tercepted.
John Elway drove Stanford
to victory at the other end
polishing off the coup de
grace with a lob to a lonesome
Emile Harry in the far corner
of the end zone.
Ohio State fans were mad
and they hated Earle Bruce.

Football games are big here in
Columbus.
"I can't believe it," Les the
cab driver said. "I ne'er seen
anything so dumb in my life.
But I'm happy. I bet the
spread. I won 500 bucks.
Jack, a salesman from
Houston was more personal.
"I've never seen anyone as
dumb as Earle Bruce," he
said. "You don't mind seeing
a team lose when it's execu
tion. They (Ohio State) played
a good game. But when it's
stupidity, it makes you sick.
Earle Bruce made me sick."
Stanford fans loved Earle
Bruce. Thanks they said.
"We couldn't believe it," a
1979 grad said. "Earle the
Pearl. That's what the Ohio
State fans were calling him.
They want him out."
Which brings us to the
point. He made a bad call. He

sail i so.
" It was a bad play call," he
said
So v vhy the fuss on Earle. He
mad e a mistake. Why do they
want him out.
Be cause football is big in
Columbus and people had
bettei • perform. Everything in
volve* d with football is big.
Oni; Bay Area sportswriter
commenting on the OSU
band s aid the tuba section was
as big as the Stanford band.
The t> sam, more than 100
players \ decked out in Buckeye
gray ar id red like so many tin
soldiers;, certainly was. The
town d ressed its shops and
squares in red and gray. Even
the sky turned gray for the
game.
And ti here was excitement.
The 85th i straight sell-out at
home. A i record crowd in
Ohio Stadium even though
tickets we re available shortly
before gar ne time.
And e: <citement on the
field. A c heerleader with a
Buckeye n task the size of an
air conditi oner on his head
did cartwh leels without his
hands. The million or so band
members w rote Ohio at half
time. In big i letters.
And they \ hink Earle Bruce
let them down. And that hurts
a lot of people.
And Stanf< ird won and was
happy. But E larle Bruce may
never recover . They want him
out.
