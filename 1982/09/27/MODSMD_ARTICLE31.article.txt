USC slams door on Sooners
Norman, Okla. — The end of

thing you want to happen against
good teams.
"The last team that shut us out
was Notre Dame, and now USC.
All losses hurt, but it hurts more
when you lose to teams that are
not so good."
Saturday's matchup brought
together two of the nation's
stronger defensive teams, accord
ing to Switzer and Trojan Coach
John Robinson.
"Our defense is to be con
gratulated in the extreme," Rob
inson said. "And Oklahoma has
one of the better defenses in thf:
country; they swarmed all over
us.
"The best against the best is
always what you want, and US C
against Oklahoma is a gre :at
thing."
But the greatest thing on the
field was the Souihern Cal de
fense.

USC slams door on Sooners
Norman, Okla. — The end of
an era came Saturday when
Southern Cal shut out Oklahoma
12-0. No team had held the
Sooners scoreless for 181 games
— since a 38-0 thrashing by
Notre Dame in 1966.
"We knew it would happen
sometime," said Sooner Coach
Barry Switzer. "It's the kind of
thing you want to happen against
good teams.
"The last team that shut us out
was Notre Dame, and now USC.
All losses hurt, but it hurts more
when you lose to teams that are
not so good."
Saturday's matchup brought
together two of the nation's
stronger defensive teams, accord
ing to Switzer and Trojan Coach
John Robinson.
"Our defense is to be con
gratulated in the extreme," Rob
inson said. "And Oklahoma has
one of the better defenses in thf:
country; they swarmed all over
us.
"The best against the best is
always what you want, and US C
against Oklahoma is a gre :at
thing."
But the greatest thing on the
field was the Souihern Cal de
fense.
