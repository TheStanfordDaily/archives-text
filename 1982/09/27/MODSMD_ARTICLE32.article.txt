# McEnroe drives to Trans-Am triumph
## 
### Associated Press 
San Francisco — John
McEnroe won a small meas
ure of revenge for his defeat in
the Wimbledon finals by
thrashing a listless Jimmy
Connors 6-1, 6-3 Sunday
night to capture the 5250,000
Transamerica Open tennis
championship.
McEnroe, who lost to Con
nors in five sets the last time
they met on the grass at
Wimbledon, had no trouble
on the blue carpet at the Cow
Palace. McEnroe charged the
net repeatedly, catching Con
nors either flat-footed or
going the wrong way.
Connors, who regained the
world's top-ranking this year
at age 30 with his triumph at
the U.S. Open two weeks ago,
was in a hole the entire match
because of a poor serve.
Connors was broken on the
first five games he served,
each time falling behind by
losing the first two points of
the game. After losing on
service in the third game of the
match, Connors slammed the
ball angrily into the wall be
hind the baseline, cursing
himself for his sloppy play.

McEnroe's performance
wasn't very inspired but it
didn't have to be. It was only
the second Grand Prix
triumph this year for the
world's third-ranked player
from Douglaston, N.Y.
It was McEnroe's ninth win
in his 20 meetings with Con
nors since 1977. Connors won
the last two matches, played
in June at the Queens tour
nament and Wimbledon.
McEnroe beat Connors twice
in January, at the Philadel
phia Grand Prix and at the
Masters Grand Prix in New
York. "This was different
from Wimbledon and ob
viously not as important,"
McEnroe said. "But 1 played
as well as I have in a while. He
definitely wasn't up for it. It's
not that he really wasn't
trying, but it's harder to push
yourself sometimes.
"I played well and he was
rushing the points a little, giv
ing me the chance to win
them."
McEnroe needed only one
hour, 20 minutes to close out
the match and had six aces to
none for Connors.
