# Fans mourn first silent Sunday in 63 years
## No progress in NFL talks 
### Associated Press 
Hempstead, N.Y. — While the
nation's pro football fans found
alternative ways of spending
their game-less Sunday, Ed Gar
vey, Jack Donlan and their as
sociates resumed negotiations in
the player union's first regular
season strike in the 63-year his
tory of the National Football
League.
But even before the talks began
for the first time since they broke
off Sept. 17, there were signs that
more than just this third regular
season weekend (14 games)
would be affected.
Gene Upshaw, pr;sidentofthe
union, said on one TV program
both sides were "* ;ry, very far
apart" and that th : strike could
be prolonged because of the
league's contract with the three
television networks. They will
pay the NFL about $30 million
for this weekend's games and an
other $30 million for next week
end's, the money to be refunded
next year only if the games are

eventually canceled.
And on another program,
NFL Commissioner Pete Rozelle
said the strike would have to be
settled by Thursday in order to
rescue next Sunday's and Mon
day night's games.
Donlan, the executive director
of the Management Council, the
owners' negotiating team, and
Garvey, his counterpart with the
union, met at about 5.
PDT at the faculty board room
of Hofstra University in this New
York City suburb. The building
is adjacent to Weeb Ewbank
Hall, the training facilities of the
New York Jets.
Upshaw, also a guard for the
Los Angles Raiders, and Garvey
arrived from New York, tailed by
a caravan of media people, after
Upshaw had appeared on "Face
The Nation," a CBS public-af
fairs program. Donlan was to
have appeared but he withdrew,
citing the negotiations.
Also at the bargaining session
were Chip Yablonski and Dick

Berthelsen, counsel for the
union, and executive board mem
bers Mark Murphy (Washing
ton), Tom Condon (Kansas
City). Dan Jiggetts (Chicago),
James Lofton (Green Bay), Jeff
Van Note (Atlanta), John Bunt
ing (Philadelphia) and Stan
White (Detroit). Jimmy Cefalo
(Miami) was delayed when his
tlight from Florida was fogged
in.
Guards kept everyone but the
negotiators out of the building —
and for a moment, they kept Gar
vey out, too. He had to show a
credit card to prove his identity
before the guards would let him
pass.
At about 6 p.m., Jiggetts left
the building for a moment and
when asked how the talks were
going said, "No progress."
Jiggetts, a 270-pound tackle,
Condon, a 275-pound guard, and
Murphy, a 210-pound safety, re
ported they took a taxi from New
York City to the site of the talks.
