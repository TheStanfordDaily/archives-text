# Northwestern wins!

That's one down — the biggest one — arid seven to go.
"We're convinced," Northwestern Coach Dennis Green said
Saturday after his Wildcats put the longest major college losing
streak on record behind them with a 31-6 win over Northern
Illinois. "Now we have to convince some of the guys we're
playing against."
Northwestern has seven football g?mts remaining this sea
son, all against Big Ten teams.
The win was Northwestern's first after 34 straight losses, dat
ing back to a September 1979 victory over Wyoming. The Wild
cats took the futility title in 1981, passing Virginia and Kansas
State which jointly held the losing standard at 28 games.
But Green, a former Stanford offensive coordinator and line
man from lowa hired in 1981 to salvage Northwestern's declin
ing program, put all that behind him on Saturday.
"It was not that much of a load," said Green of "The Streak,"
which drew television crews and reporters from the major pa
pers and national sports magazines to the Wildcats games as the
record lengthened. "I've got big shoulders and the burden never
really became too much.
The Wildcats' decline began after the 1971 season, the next to
last of Alex Agase's reign at the Big Ten school. The Wildcats
went 7-4 in 1971, 2-9 in 1972, Agase's last season, and failed to
win more than four games through 1975.
In 1976, John Pont won just one game, repeated the feat in
1977 and with the exception of the victory over Wyoming in
1979, Northwestern hadn't won until Saturday since the last
game of the 1977 season.
"Anytime you try to turn something of this magnitude
around, you've got to make changes — in the players, in the fa
cilities and in the approach," said Green.
One of Green's personnel changes paid off in diamonds Sat
urday. Ricky Edwards, who returned to the backfield after
spending most of last season as a receiver, shredded the NIU
defense for four touchdowns, three of them coming on the
Wildcats' first three possessions. The 5-foot-9, 175-pound sen
ior, rushed 177 yards and in 29 attempts scored ofur times to tie
the school record shared by Otto Graham and Mike Adamle. It
also was the first scoring in his career at Northwestern.
Elsewhere in the world of college football, losers included
second-ranked Nebraska, which bowed to No.B Penn State
27-24 on Todd Blackledge's 2-yard pass to Kirk Bowman with
four seconds remaining; No. 19 Illinois, which ran afoul of
third-ranked Pitt's mighty defense and lost 20-3.
All the major powers, however, must share the spotlight with
Grambling's 63-year-old Eddie Robinson, the veteran coach at
the little predominantly black school in Louisiana, whose rec
ord is a glittering 300-98-13 following a 43-21 victory over Flori
da A&M. The only other coaches to win 300 games are Bear
Bryant (318 and counting), Amos Alonzo Stagg (314) and Pop
Warner (313).
