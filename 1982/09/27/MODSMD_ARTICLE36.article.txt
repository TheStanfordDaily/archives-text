### Associated Press Giants 3, Dodgers 2 
Los Angeles — Darrell Evans
says Sunday just happened to be
his time to be a hero for the San
Francisco Giants.
The Giants' infielder ripped a
two-run homer in a three-run
fifth inning and San Francisco
held on for a 3-2 victory over the
Los Angeles Dodgers in a game
played at Dodger Stadium.
"Every player on this club has
been a hero at one time or anoth
er for us," Evans said after the
Giants completed a three-game
sweep in Los Angeles.
The victory pulled San Fran
cisco into a second-place tie with
the Atlanta Braves, one game
back of the National League
West-leading Dodgers.
"I've been with the Giants for
seven years now," Evans said,
"and I've wanted badly to be a
part of a Giant team like this one.
"We've got something in our
grasp we've never had before,
and we're hungry."
Although the Dodgers are
slumping, Los Angeles Manager
Tom Lasorda remained confi
dent.
"We're still in first place; it's
that simple," Lasorda said. "I'd
rather be where we are than
where they are."
The triumph in the rain-de
layed contest, which began
almost three hours after its
scheduled 1:05 p.m. start,
marked the first time the Giants
had swept a three-game series at
Dodger Stadium since 1967.
Evans' homer, his 16th of the
season, came off Los Angeles
starter Burt Hooton, 3-7. With
one out in the fifth, Joe Morgan
walked, Jack Clark doubled him
home, then Evans hit a shot deep
into the left field seats.
San Francisco's Fred Breining,
11-5, held Los Angeles scoreless
until the sixth inning, when he

walked Dusty Baker and gave up
a singles to Pedro Guerrero and
Steve Garvey.
After Breining walked Ron
Cey, Giants' reliever Al Holland
came on with the bases loaded
and one out and got pinch-hitters
Jose Morales and Mike Marshall
on fly outs to end the inning.
Holland collected his fifth save
of the season, giving up just two
hits over the final 3 2/3 innings as
the Giants won their fifth straight
and 10th in 12 games.
Orioles 5, Brewers 2
Milwaukee — Dennis
Martinez and Tippy Martinez
teamed on a six-hitter and Eddie
Murray homered and knocked in
two runs, leading Baltimore to a
5-2 victory over the Milwaukee
Brewers Sunday as the Orioles
closed within two games of the
American League East-leading
Brewers.
Baltimore, which lost the
opener of this three-game series
with Milwaukee, won the final
two games. Each team has seven
games remaining, and the
Brewers and Orioles finish the
regular season with a four-game
series in Baltimore.
Dennis Martinez, 15-12, car
ried a 3-1 lead and a three-hitter
into the eighth inning, but
Charlie Moore led off with a sin
gle and pinch-hitter Bob Scuby,
batting for only the second time
in the majors, singled. Moore
raced to third when right fielder
Dan Ford bobbled the ball for an
error.
Scuby advanced to second and
Moore held third on a sacrifice
by Paul Molitor. An RBI single
by Yount finished Dennis
Martinez.
Tippy Martinez got Cecil Co
oper to hit a soft fly to short cen
ter. Rookie John Shelby caught
the ball coming on at full speed
and managed an accurate peg to
the plate that cut down Scuby.
