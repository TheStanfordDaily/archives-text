## My team would've won yesterday and would be in first 
### 
Apologies to Joe
Soucheray, but I want to own
a football team.
My team will be the Oak
land Raiders and will play in
Oakland long after San Fran
cisco crumbles in the quake.
My team will play in the
Oakland Coliseum on real
grass. Nobody pulls me down
south. Nobody buys my foot
ball team.
My team will hate the San
Francisco 49ers. My team will
hate everyone.
My team will wear black
and gray. My team will not

wear silver and black. My
team will wear black shoes.
Marc Wilson will be my
back-up quarterback. Jim
Plunkett will be my quarter
back.

The Sporting Muse

I want John Madden.
1 will be general manager. I
will do what John Madden
tells me to. Pete Rozelle will
not tell me what to do. No
body will, except John Mad
den.
My kicker will kick with his

toe and will wear the lone-bar
mask.
I want Mark Moseley.
My team will not play on
Thursday, Friday or Satur
day. My team will not polish
their helmets before Monday
night games.
Tickets to see my team will
be $5. Parking will be free. I'll
make my money from tele
vision and concessions.
I want John Riggins.
I want characters on my
team. I want my players to
drink beer with John Riggins.
I want my players to drink

beer together.
Everyone will hate my
team. Our fans will love my
team. My team will love our
fans and will always play in
Oakland.
I want Hacksaw Reynolds.
Joe Montana will not play
for my team. My team will
spit on Joe Montana.
1 will pay my players fairly
and they will not discuss con
tract negotiations in the press.
My players will talk football
to the press.
I want Joe Senser.
My team will love to play

on grass and love it even more
when it rains.
I want Ronnie Lott.
My team will not have
scantily-clad cheerleaders
named Bambi. My team will
not have a video-game
scoreboard. If you want to see
them, stay home.
Julie Andrews or Linda
Ronstadt will sing the na
tional anthem at all home
games.
I want Ray Ciuy.
There will not be an or
ganist at my Held. There will
not be a mascot for my team.

Raiders are too distinguished
to be imitated by a clown.
I don't want Earl
Campbell, Walter Payton or
Joe Cribbs. I want Tony
Dorsett.
Gene Upshaw and Art
Shell will start on my team.
Bill King will be my television
man and Lindsay Nelson will
be my radio man. Brent
Musberger will not set up a
studio in my stadium. He can
stay in New York.
I want Darrin Nelson.
My team will beat up on
teams that play indoors or on

carpet or both. My team will
hate sissies.
I want Lester Hayes.
My team will not shake
hands with the other team un
til after the game. My team
will not hold hands in the hud
dle. My team will eat quiche
and address all questions
about it individually.
I want Joe Kapp to teach
my quarterbacks.
My team will not strike.
It's early fall and my team is
in first place. My team is
always in first place.
