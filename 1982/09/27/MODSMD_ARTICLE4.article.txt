# USW walkout enters 18th day
## Strike talks to resume this week 
### DAVID AZRIN Senior staff writer 
United Stanford Workers and University officials agreed
last Friday to meet with a federal mediator on Wednesday in
order to reach a new contract agreement and end the union's
18-day-old strike.
"We're going to the table to bargain, but the bottom line is
that the University has to move," said Michael Baratz, ex
ecutive secretary of USW and head of the union negotiating
team.
"We're certainly prepared to study with the union any
counter proposal that represents significant movement,"
said University President Donald Kennedy, "but we don't
feel as if it's our obligation to put forth the next proposal."
Though pressure has mounted for both sides to reach an
agreement, no real progress is expected because both jid>ss
plan no significant changes in their positions.
"Both sides are very dug into their positions," said
Dorothy Christiansen, federal mediator for the Federal Me
diation Service. "It's just a matter of time."
USW, Local 715 of Service Employees International
Union, AFL-CIO, consists of 1350 life-science technicians,
carpenters, plumbers, painters, machinists, custodians,
food-service workers, delivery personnel, gardeners and
storekeepers.
The union membership voted to strike, 4b5 to 172, at a
meeting on Sept. 10. Negotiations to replace the old contract
that expired Aug. 31 broke off Sept. 8 after the union re
jected the University's final proposal put forth the day
before.
Since then, the University has not offered any new pro
posals. The union has offered two.
The total increase of the union's proposal during the next
two years would be 24.1 percent, according to USW. How
ever, the University estimates the increase to be 26.75 per
cent.
The University's proposal will amount to 14.5 to 17 per
cent increases during the next two years.

The union proposal does not include any provisions for a
third year because USW would prefer to negotiate a two
year contract.
Baratz caller' for a mediation session with a federal medi
ator Sept. 17 where he presented a new union proposal. The
University rejected this proposal because it represented "no
significant change." The negotiations were suspended.
The union plans to hold a full membership meeting today
at noon, but they do not plan to draw up any new proposals
there, Baratz said.
The union claims that the University has been inflexible.
The University makes the same charge against the union.
"The union bargained high. We chose to bid close to what
they wanted. From now on we can only make small moves,"
said University Counsel John Schwartz.
"We had made a series of moves and proposals before the
strike. Nonetheless, the union made no significant moves,"
Kennedy said.
Baratz said that even if the union's original proposals were
high the University has to continue bargaining.
"Even when there's a stalemate there's always got to be
people in the background moving. But these people, they
don't move," said Baratz.
"It's strictly power bargaining. They say, 'yeh, we've got
your numbers, fuck you, no," he said. "Why don't they
move just a little and show good faith?"
"We presented them with our best and last offer," said
Priscilla Wheeler, staff counsel and head of the University
negotiating team. She said it was, "a fair offer, what we
viewed as reasonable for what the University could afford to
offer."
"The union started out with just an astronomical package.
They are the ones who are not budging. They took about 10
minutes to reject our offer without even asking any ques
tions. We presented an offer and they rejected it," Wheeler
said.
