# USW walkout enters 18th day
## Strike talks to resume this week 
### DAVID AZRIN Senior staff writer 
United Stanford Workers and University officials agreed
last Friday to meet with a federal mediator on Wednesday in
order to reach a new contract agreement and end the union's
18-day-old strike.
"We're going to the table to bargain, but the bottom line is
that the University has to move," said Michael Baratz, ex
ecutive secretary of USW and head of the union negotiating
team.
"We're certainly prepared to study with the union any
counter proposal that represents significant movement,"
said University President Donald Kennedy, "but we don't
feel as if it's our obligation to put forth the next proposal."
Though pressure has mounted for both sides to reach an
agreement, no real progress is expected because both jid>ss
plan no significant changes in their positions.
"Both sides are very dug into their positions," said
Dorothy Christiansen, federal mediator for the Federal Me
diation Service. "It's just a matter of time."
USW, Local 715 of Service Employees International
Union, AFL-CIO, consists of 1350 life-science technicians,
carpenters, plumbers, painters, machinists, custodians,
food-service workers, delivery personnel, gardeners and
storekeepers.
The union membership voted to strike, 4b5 to 172, at a
meeting on Sept. 10. Negotiations to replace the old contract
that expired Aug. 31 broke off Sept. 8 after the union re
jected the University's final proposal put forth the day
before.
Since then, the University has not offered any new pro
posals. The union has offered two.
The total increase of the union's proposal during the next
two years would be 24.1 percent, according to USW. How
ever, the University estimates the increase to be 26.75 per
cent.
The University's proposal will amount to 14.5 to 17 per
cent increases during the next two years.

The union proposal does not include any provisions for a
third year because USW would prefer to negotiate a two
year contract.
Baratz caller' for a mediation session with a federal medi
ator Sept. 17 where he presented a new union proposal. The
University rejected this proposal because it represented "no
significant change." The negotiations were suspended.
The union plans to hold a full membership meeting today
at noon, but they do not plan to draw up any new proposals
there, Baratz said.
The union claims that the University has been inflexible.
The University makes the same charge against the union.
"The union bargained high. We chose to bid close to what
they wanted. From now on we can only make small moves,"
said University Counsel John Schwartz.
"We had made a series of moves and proposals before the
strike. Nonetheless, the union made no significant moves,"
Kennedy said.
Baratz said that even if the union's original proposals were
high the University has to continue bargaining.
"Even when there's a stalemate there's always got to be
people in the background moving. But these people, they
don't move," said Baratz.
"It's strictly power bargaining. They say, 'yeh, we've got
your numbers, fuck you, no," he said. "Why don't they
move just a little and show good faith?"
"We presented them with our best and last offer," said
Priscilla Wheeler, staff counsel and head of the University
negotiating team. She said it was, "a fair offer, what we
viewed as reasonable for what the University could afford to
offer."
"The union started out with just an astronomical package.
They are the ones who are not budging. They took about 10
minutes to reject our offer without even asking any ques
tions. We presented an offer and they rejected it," Wheeler
said.
"Their proposal does not com
pare with the wage increases of
other workers on campus. It is 10
to 30 percent lower than the real
market levels off campus. It
didn't provide protection from
inflationary increases in medical
premiums, and it didn't address
the unfair labor practice charge.
She (Wheeler) could have pre
dicted our response. She forced
us to strike." Baratz said.
"They just want to bust the
union," Baratz said.
Kennedy denied attempting to
break the union. According to
Kennedy, busting the union
"would be the furthest thing
from our minds. It would be a
thing that we would not like to
have happen."
"The union was in a weak ne
gotiating position in the past
years of the negotiations," said
Baratz. "Priscilla jammed them
and the union ate things they dis
liked. Now Priscilla has tried the

same strategy, but it didn't work.
This is a different rank and file
and they're very united on the
bottom line issues."
The University charges that
the strike is illegal because the
union failed to tell the Federal
Mediation and Conciliation Ser
vice of the dispute in advance of
the Aug. 31 expiration. The Uni
versity also charges that the
union failed to give the Stanford
University Clinics and Medical
School 10-day notice of the
strike.
The union claims that the
strike is based on unfair labor
practice and therefore does not
require the advance notice. They
charge that the University's re
fusal to provide information on
temporary and non-union work
ers and contractors is an unfair
labor practice.
The National Labor Relations
Board (NLRB) is now consider
ing whether the strike is actu?HÂ«
an unfair labor practice strike or
an economic strike. The strike
would be illegal if the courts
ruled it was economic. The Uni

versity would have the right to
fire the workers, and workers
would have the right to sue the
union.
In a previous ruling in June the
NLRB ruled that the University
was required to supply the union
with information concerning the
hiring of temporary workers,
non-union employees and con
tractors. The University has re
fused to comply with that ruling
and is appealing to the Federal
Court of Appeals.
The union wants the Univer
sity to give them 10-days prior
notice before hiring temporary or
non-union members to perform
union work "whenever pos
sible." The University claims
that this plan would be imprac
tical.
"The union sees all bargaining
unit work as their province and
we don't see it their way. We

want to provide work for stu
dents and we want to manage ef
ficiently. That's a philosophical
difference," said Wheeler. "They
have not shown a demonstrable
need for this information," she
added.
Kennedy said the University
will not fire workers if the NLRB
rules in their favor "under any
conditions that I can now for
see."
The University claims the un
fair labor practice charges were
never mentioned at the bargain
ing table and were only men
tioned at the last minute to sup
port the unfair labor practice
charge.
"The union's demands before
the strike were only over the con
tract. They never discussed that
information (on non-union
workers) at the bargaining
table," said Wheeler.

Baratz flatly disagreed.
"Priscilla Wheeler is a liar. Our
attorney came to the bargaining
table and talked about those
practices (the hiring of tem
porary workers)," Baratz said.
On Sept. 8, the union leader
ship received a letter from its at
torneys assuring them that a
si rikc w i hi Id be leaal based on the
unfair labor practice charge.
Baratz said that this letter "wiped
out the fears of the member
ship."
Union members voted to strike
at a meeting in Dinkelspiel
Auditorium Sept. 10. After the
meeting, a group of more than
300 USW workers marched to
the President's Office where they
chanted "strike, strike, strike,"
according to Stanford Police
Chief Marvin Herrington.
