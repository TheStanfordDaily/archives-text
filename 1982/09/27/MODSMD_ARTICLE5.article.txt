# Fees hiked, P/NC rules stiffened
## Registration process changes this year 
### STEVE TROUSDALE Staff writer 
Students returning from summer
vacation this year will have to cope with
new alterations in the University's al
ready-complex registration process.
The changes, though not radical, will
affect a large proportion of students
here.
The biggest change affects the defer
ment program. This vcar, instead of a
$1 charge for every $100 of deferred
charges for the first month and a $2
charge for every SIOO for the second
month after registration, there is a $20
application fee to defer and a I percent
per month interest charge on deferred

amounts.
Deferred tuition payments will be
due on one date each quarter. This
quarter they are due on Dec. 6. In future
quarters they will be due 45 days after
the start of classes in future quarters.
After these deadlines pass, an adci
tional late fee will be assessed.
According to University Registrar
Sallv Mahonev, the changes in the de
ferment schedule are being made so that
the University will comply with a new
federal regulation.
Administrators said this new pro
gram was not instituted to make more
money for the University. "I do not be
lieve the University will collect any

more money," Bursar Joseph Jedd said
"fn fact, it may collect less."
In order to prevent students from reg
istering late, registration fees have in
creased this year. Fees for students reg
istering on Wednesday and Thursday,
will be $30, compared with a 52 charge
last year. The registration fee between
Oct. I and Oct. 5 will be S4O and after
Oct. 5, it will go up to $50. Last year the
charges for those time periods were $5
and SIO.
According to Jedd, some Eastern
schools charge SlOO for late registration
and in comparison. Stanford's late fees
are relatively little.
