# Fees hiked, P/NC rules stiffened
## Registration process changes this year 
### STEVE TROUSDALE Staff writer 
Students returning from summer
vacation this year will have to cope with
new alterations in the University's al
ready-complex registration process.
The changes, though not radical, will
affect a large proportion of students
here.
The biggest change affects the defer
ment program. This vcar, instead of a
$1 charge for every $100 of deferred
charges for the first month and a $2
charge for every SIOO for the second
month after registration, there is a $20
application fee to defer and a I percent
per month interest charge on deferred

amounts.
Deferred tuition payments will be
due on one date each quarter. This
quarter they are due on Dec. 6. In future
quarters they will be due 45 days after
the start of classes in future quarters.
After these deadlines pass, an adci
tional late fee will be assessed.
According to University Registrar
Sallv Mahonev, the changes in the de
ferment schedule are being made so that
the University will comply with a new
federal regulation.
Administrators said this new pro
gram was not instituted to make more
money for the University. "I do not be
lieve the University will collect any

more money," Bursar Joseph Jedd said
"fn fact, it may collect less."
In order to prevent students from reg
istering late, registration fees have in
creased this year. Fees for students reg
istering on Wednesday and Thursday,
will be $30, compared with a 52 charge
last year. The registration fee between
Oct. I and Oct. 5 will be S4O and after
Oct. 5, it will go up to $50. Last year the
charges for those time periods were $5
and SIO.
According to Jedd, some Eastern
schools charge SlOO for late registration
and in comparison. Stanford's late fees
are relatively little.
Mahoney added that late fees had not
increased since 1975.
While registering for classes, students
will note several changes from last year,
according to Assistant Registar Bob
Houghton. Permits to Register will be
given out in Maples Pavilion instead of
Memorial Auditiorium because Mem
Aud is being used for religious services.
Also, instead of having to sign course
lists and wait in different lines for lim
ited enrollment classes in different de
partments, students will have their
names entered for these classes via com
puter terminals that have been set up in
Maples. Students will only have to wait
in one line because each terminal can be
used to sign class lists in every depart

ment.
The University has also increased
late study list fees. Study lists not turned
in by the Oct. 8 deadline will be assessed
a$ 10 fee for the first week and a $20 fee
after that.
In addition, this year students must
declare the pass/no credit option for a
course by the third Friday of the quar
ter. Any course with stars next to it in
the time schedule can only be taken
either for a grade or pass/no credit. No
option is available.
The United Stanford Workers strike
on campus will have little effect on the
registration process, according to vari
ous people queried by the Daily.
Houghton said that security had been
arranged in Maples to protect the
equipment there, but added that this
had been done in previous years.
