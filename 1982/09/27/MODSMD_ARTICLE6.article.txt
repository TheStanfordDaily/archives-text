# Summer update: Jobs dominate local news
## 
### MIKE HALE Senior staff writer 
Jobs dominated the news in a
Stanford summer that began with
the installation of a University pro
fessor as secretary of state and ended
in the third week of a strike by cam
pus technical, maintenance and food
service workers.
George Shultz, a campus resident
and part-time Business School pro
fessor, was nominated by President
Reagan for secretary of state June
25, the same day Alexander Haig's
resignation was made public. Shultz
was confirmed overwhelmingly by
the Senate three weeks later, and he
jokingly told the Senate Foreign Re
lations Committee he was prepared
to take on his new duties if the Uni
versity board of trustees granted him
a leave of absence.
Shortly after Shultz's confirma
tion, hiscampus home was visited by
former Secretary of State Henry
Kissinger, West German Chancellor
Helmut Schmidt and Singapore Pre
mier Lee Kuan Yew.
* ♦ *
Later in the summer walking off
the job became news when contract
negotiations between the University
and the United Stanford Workers
broke down and union members
voted on Sept. 10 to strike. That af
ternoon workers marched on Uni
versity President Donald Kennedy's
office, and pickets sprung up around
campus, concentrating on current
construction projects and the en
trance to the Stanford Linear Ac
celerator Center. The pickets re
main, and more than half the
union's 1350 workers remain off the
job (see related story this page).
In August, the National Labor
Relations Board certified the defeat
of the 1981 attempt to unionize Uni
versity clerical and library workers.

The NI.RB overruled the last of 16
objections filed by USW (12 of
which were withdrawn by the
union), a charge that the University
unfairly influenced the election by
announcing a change in non-exempt
employee wages two months before
the vote. The Office Staff Organiz
ing Committee, which led the ori
ginal organization drive, continues
to hold meetings; a Universitv task
force formed to address the workers'
concerns was to report to Kennedy
this month.

A final decision regarding tenure
for Asst. History Prof. Estelle
Freedman was again delayed during
the summer and still has not been
reached. In early July Norman
Wessells, dean of humanities and
sciences, and two associate deans de
cided on the procedure that would
be employed in reviewing their
earlier, controversial decision not to
grant Freedman tenure. It requires
the History department to solicit ad
ditional letters evaluating Freedman
written by scholars outside the Uni
versity. The department is still wait
ing for some of these to arrive, ac
cording to Prof. Carl Degler, chair
man ofthe History department com
mittee handling Freedman's case,
but Degler hopes the department
will be ready to proceed within sev
eral weeks.
Once the department is ready to
act, the case will be reviewed by the
Committee on Appointments and
Promotions, which will then advise
the deans of humanities and sciences
regarding the new decision
* * •
In a final job-related story. Busi
ness School Dean Rene McPherson
resigned early this summer for
health and personal reasons.

McPherson, former chief ex
ecutive of the Dana Corporation,
will remain in the post until a suc
cessor is named. In December 1979,
two months after he was selected to
be the Business School dean,
McPherson was involved in a seri
ous auto accident, the effects of
which caused him to be hospitalized
again this year.

The trial of University graduate
Robert Simon on charges of vehicu
lar manslaughter and drunken driv
ing in connection with a campus
auto accident last fall was held dur-

ing the summer in Santa Clara
County Court. Simon drove his car
into an oak tree near Campus Drive
last Oct. 30 in an accident which
claimed the lives of juniors Michael
Becker and Kevin MacMillan. He
pleaded not guilty to all charges. On
August 3, Simon was found guilty
on two counts of misdemeanor ve
hicular manslaughter (rather than
the felony vehicular manslaughter
charges requested by the prose
cution) and one count of felony
drunk driving.

Simon, who faced a maximum of
three years in prison, v\as sentenced
last Friday to one vear in jail and a
$10,000 line bv Superior Court
Judge William Harris. Currently
free on his own recognizance and
working for a local management
consulting firm. Simon has been or
dered to report to the county jail
Nov. 2.
* * *
As usual, the summer was a time
for major and minor facelifts around
campus. Two changes in lhe physi
cal plant were not planned on: a
June flood in Roble Hall, caused by
a collapsing sink, did about $2500 in
water damage to 15 rooms, and in
August there was a minor explosion
in the Stauffer Chemical Engineer
ing labs.
Another, more premeditated
change may eventually cause more
of a stir, however: earlier ihis month,
the University painted bike paths in
White Plaza complete with lanes,
crossings, and vteld signs. The lanes
run from Tresidder Union through
White Plaza to the Engineering Cor
ner in the Quad, and among other
restrictions prohibit bicvcle traffic
along the north side of Dinkelspiel
Auditorium (the area generally oc
cupied by the flower stall and other
vendors).
Construction proceeded over the
summer on such major projects as
the new music building. Building
120 in the Quad, and the new
dormitories (which at last report
were still on schedule) The Memori
al Church altar was without a roof
for a short time this summer while
work was done on the church's inner
ceiling; installation of a new organ,
which necessitated the rebuilding of
the church's north wall last spring, is
set for November 1983.


George Shultz
In what was probably the most impressive sin
gle project of the summer, Ventura Hall, home
of the Institute for Mathematical Studies in the
Social Sciences, was moved in four sections —
one per day — from its old location at Via Palou
and Serra Street to a new foundation at Panama
Street and Campus Drive.
* * *
In a move sure to cheer up those tired of wait
ing in computer queues, the Low Overhead Time
Sharing (LOTS) system was to add a new com
puter the second week of this month. The DEC
2060 replaces LESS, which was on loan to LOTS
from the Business School last year. In addition,
63 new terminals will be installed on campus
during the year.
♦ * *
In late July, an agreement to merge was
reached between the Children's Hospital at
Stanford and the pediatrics department of the
Stanford University Hospital (SUH). The com
bined operation will be housed in a new, $40 mil
lion facility. While the new facility will be physi
cally attached to SUH, it will retain its own cor
porate identity and board of directors and the
name Children's Hospital at Stanford.
* * *
Earlier this month, SUH agreed to a settle
ment of a lawsuit filed on behalf of an infant de

livered at the hospital in 1980 that may even
tually cost it three times more than the new
pediatrics facility. Anna Younger, a spastic
quadriplegic child who according to the suit
"sustained severe and permanent brain dam
age" because she stopped breathing for a few
minutes shortly after birth, will be supported for
life as a result of the settlement.
The first yearly support payment, due Oct. 1,
will be for $81,960, and payments will increase
according to a formula that will put them at
more than $275,000 by 2002. The current cash
value of the settlement was estimated by the
plaintiffs to be at least $8.1 million; estimates of
the eventual total payments have run as high as
$122 million.
* * *
Effective Sept. I, the University minimum
wage for student employees went up from $3.85
an hour to $4.30. The 11.5 percent increase coin
cided with the increase given to University staff
each fall.
* * *
Finally, hard on the heels of the controversy
over the installation of the sculpture Mozart I
near Meyer Library last spring, another large
piece of outdoor sculpture went up on campus
during the summer. Oakland sculptor Bruce
Beasley's stainless steel, 28 by 14 feet piece Van
guard now sits on the lawn outside the Law
School's Kresge Auditorium. It is on loan from
the artist under a program funded by a gift from
Donald and Doris Fisher, founders of The Gap
stores, and will remain on campus at least two
years.

In what was probably the most impressive sin
gle project of the summer, Ventura Hall, home
of the Institute for Mathematical Studies in the
Social Sciences, was moved in four sections —
one per day — from its old location at Via Palou
and Serra Street to a new foundation at Panama
Street and Campus Drive.
* * *
In a move sure to cheer up those tired of wait
ing in computer queues, the Low Overhead Time
Sharing (LOTS) system was to add a new com
puter the second week of this month. The DEC
2060 replaces LESS, which was on loan to LOTS
from the Business School last year. In addition,
63 new terminals will be installed on campus
during the year.

In late July, an agreement to merge was
reached between the Children's Hospital at
Stanford and the pediatrics department of the
Stanford University Hospital (SUH). The com
bined operation will be housed in a new, $40 mil
lion facility. While the new facility will be physi
cally attached to SUH, it will retain its own cor
porate identity and board of directors and the
name Children's Hospital at Stanford.
* * *
Earlier this month, SUH agreed to a settle
ment of a lawsuit filed on behalf of an infant de

livered at the hospital in 1980 that may even
tually cost it three times more than the new
pediatrics facility. Anna Younger, a spastic
quadriplegic child who according to the suit
"sustained severe and permanent brain dam
age" because she stopped breathing for a few
minutes shortly after birth, will be supported for
life as a result of the settlement.
The first yearly support payment, due Oct. 1,
will be for $81,960, and payments will increase
according to a formula that will put them at
more than $275,000 by 2002. The current cash
value of the settlement was estimated by the
plaintiffs to be at least $8.1 million; estimates of
the eventual total payments have run as high as
$122 million.
* * *
Effective Sept. I, the University minimum
wage for student employees went up from $3.85
an hour to $4.30. The 11.5 percent increase coin
cided with the increase given to University staff
each fall.

Finally, hard on the heels of the controversy
over the installation of the sculpture Mozart I
near Meyer Library last spring, another large
piece of outdoor sculpture went up on campus
during the summer. Oakland sculptor Bruce
Beasley's stainless steel, 28 by 14 feet piece Van
guard now sits on the lawn outside the Law
School's Kresge Auditorium. It is on loan from
the artist under a program funded by a gift from
Donald and Doris Fisher, founders of The Gap
stores, and will remain on campus at least two
years.
Jobs dominated the news in a
Stanford summer that began with
the installation of a University pro
fessor as secretary of state and ended
in the third week of a strike by cam
pus technical, maintenance and food
service workers.
George Shultz, a campus resident
and part-time Business School pro
fessor, was nominated by President
Reagan for secretary of state June
25, the same day Alexander Haig's
resignation was made public. Shultz
was confirmed overwhelmingly by
the Senate three weeks later, and he
jokingly told the Senate Foreign Re
lations Committee he was prepared
to take on his new duties if the Uni
versity board of trustees granted him
a leave of absence.
Shortly after Shultz's confirma
tion, hiscampus home was visited by
former Secretary of State Henry
Kissinger, West German Chancellor
Helmut Schmidt and Singapore Pre
mier Lee Kuan Yew.

Later in the summer walking off
the job became news when contract
negotiations between the University
and the United Stanford Workers
broke down and union members
voted on Sept. 10 to strike. That af
ternoon workers marched on Uni
versity President Donald Kennedy's
office, and pickets sprung up around
campus, concentrating on current
construction projects and the en
trance to the Stanford Linear Ac
celerator Center. The pickets re
main, and more than half the
union's 1350 workers remain off the
job (see related story this page).
In August, the National Labor
Relations Board certified the defeat
of the 1981 attempt to unionize Uni
versity clerical and library workers.

The NI.RB overruled the last of 16
objections filed by USW (12 of
which were withdrawn by the
union), a charge that the University
unfairly influenced the election by
announcing a change in non-exempt
employee wages two months before
the vote. The Office Staff Organiz
ing Committee, which led the ori
ginal organization drive, continues
to hold meetings; a Universitv task
force formed to address the workers'
concerns was to report to Kennedy
this month.

A final decision regarding tenure
for Asst. History Prof. Estelle
Freedman was again delayed during
the summer and still has not been
reached. In early July Norman
Wessells, dean of humanities and
sciences, and two associate deans de
cided on the procedure that would
be employed in reviewing their
earlier, controversial decision not to
grant Freedman tenure. It requires
the History department to solicit ad
ditional letters evaluating Freedman
written by scholars outside the Uni
versity. The department is still wait
ing for some of these to arrive, ac
cording to Prof. Carl Degler, chair
man ofthe History department com
mittee handling Freedman's case,
but Degler hopes the department
will be ready to proceed within sev

Once the department is ready to
act, the case will be reviewed by the
Committee on Appointments and
Promotions, which will then advise
the deans of humanities and sciences
regarding the new decision

The trial of University graduate
Robert Simon on charges of vehicu
lar manslaughter and drunken driv
ing in connection with a campus
auto accident last fall was held dur-

ing the summer in Santa Clara
County Court. Simon drove his car
into an oak tree near Campus Drive
last Oct. 30 in an accident which
claimed the lives of juniors Michael
Becker and Kevin MacMillan. He
pleaded not guilty to all charges. On
August 3, Simon was found guilty
on two counts of misdemeanor ve
hicular manslaughter (rather than
the felony vehicular manslaughter
charges requested by the prose
cution) and one count of felony
drunk driving.

Simon, who faced a maximum of
three years in prison, v\as sentenced
last Friday to one vear in jail and a
$10,000 line bv Superior Court
Judge William Harris. Currently
free on his own recognizance and
working for a local management

As usual, the summer was a time
for major and minor facelifts around
campus. Two changes in lhe physi
cal plant were not planned on: a
June flood in Roble Hall, caused by
a collapsing sink, did about $2500 in
water damage to 15 rooms, and in
August there was a minor explosion
in the Stauffer Chemical Engineer
ing labs.
Another, more premeditated
change may eventually cause more
of a stir, however: earlier ihis month,
the University painted bike paths in
White Plaza complete with lanes,
crossings, and vteld signs. The lanes
run from Tresidder Union through
White Plaza to the Engineering Cor
ner in the Quad, and among other
restrictions prohibit bicvcle traffic
along the north side of Dinkelspiel
Auditorium (the area generally oc
cupied by the flower stall and other
vendors).
Construction proceeded over the
summer on such major projects as
the new music building. Building
120 in the Quad, and the new
dormitories (which at last report
were still on schedule) The Memori
al Church altar was without a roof
for a short time this summer while
work was done on the church's inner
ceiling; installation of a new organ,
