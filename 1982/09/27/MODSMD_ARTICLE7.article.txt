## Lebanon standoff Israeli withdrawal delayed 
### 
Compiled from news reports and wire ser
vices.
U.S. Marines and Italian in
fantrymen, intended to be part of
a 3000-member multinational
peacekeeping force deployed to
Lebanon following the massacre
of hundreds of Palestinians in the
nation's capital, were left waiting
at the docks Saturday, the result
of a breakdown in arrangements
for the exodus of Israeli forces.
Though Israel agreed to the re
turn of a trinational peace
keeping force, ironing out the de
tails has not been an easy task.
Crucial to the deployment of
the three-nation force is the with
drawal of Israeli troops. Secre
tary of Defense Caspar Wein
berger, at a news conference Fri
day, reiterated the U.S. position
that Israel must be totally out of
Beirut if the Lebanese govern
ment is to reassert control of its
capital. "The presence of such
armed Israeli bands," Wein
berger said, "are potential prob
lems and could easily spark a re
newal of violence."
Washington doesn't want Is
raeli soldiers crossing lines of
multinational forces and plans to
use the Beirut airport for resup

plying the tri-nation troops.
Israel, however, wants to re
tain a small military presence in
Beirut and to be able to send pa
trols into the city if necessary. In
addition, Israelis want to con
tinue to use the airport which
they currently occupy.
The 350 French troops that
landed in Beirut Friday, just one
day after Amin Gemayel was
sworn in as president of Leba
non, have refused to leave the
French embassy compounds un
til Israeli forces pull out of the
Lebanese capital. According to
reports from Beirut, Italian of
ficials had joined the French and
Americans in refusing to deploy
their troops until the Israelis were
out of the way.
The original timetable called
for Israel to be out of West Beirut
sometime yesterday. The missed
deadline which resulted in the
holdup of U.S. and Italian troops
involved Israeli withdrawal only
from the city of Beirut. Syrian
and Palestinian Liberation Army
allies are entrenched in east and
north Lebanon while Israel holds
much of the south.
Now Israeli officials are pre
dicting a pullout to be completed

during the latter half of this week.
One Israeli ministry official said,
"The handing over of all posi
tions in the city to the Lebanese
army will be completed after
Beirut is completely cleared of
terrorists and their arms." U.S.
presidential envoy Philip Habib
reportedly received the timetable
for Israeli withdrawal during a
five-hour meeting with Israeli
Defense Minister Ariel Sharon
over the weekend. According to a
White House official, Habib
again told Sharon that the 800
Marines wuld not go ashore until
the Israelis had left Beirut.
In the twisting, turning tide of
Mideast events, news of the
massacre signaled yet another
challenge to U.S. Mideast policy.
Administration officials are re
luctant to apply pressure on Is
rael for fear of causing Prime
Minister Menachem Begin'sgov
ernment to bolt from any ap
pearance of bowing to outside
political pressure.
At the same time, President
Reagan and Mideast policy ad
visers realize the threat to U.S.
credibility in the Arab world.
During U.N. Security Council
debates following the massacre,
Hazem Nuseibeh of Jordan ques
tioned U.S. ability to convince Is
rael to adhere to cease fire agree
ments, which, according to
Nuseibeh, guaranteed a halt to
further Israeli movement into the
Lebanese capital. "Israel,"
Nuseibeh said, "has chosen to lay
bare either the ability or credibili
ty of the U.S., a guarantor of that
agreement. It is an enormous
challenge involving the honor of
a superpower. It is up to the U.S.
to redeem its word."
Despite the delicate balance of
the U.S. position, the Reagan ad
ministration remains optimistic
about establishing peace in the
Mideast and improving the
strained realtions with Israel. In a
press conference last Friday, Vice
President George Bush admitted
"clouds" hanging overhead, but
said they will eventually dissolve.
Bush stressed that the adminis
tration view of the Israelis "as
friends for strategical and moral
reasons is strong and won't be
diminished in the long run."
As an indication of continued
U.S. commitment to the Jewish
nation, the Senate Appropria
tions Committee Friday ap

proved a foreign aid bill effective
through December 15 which in
cludes assistance to Israel at the
rate of $2.2 billion per year. A
second apparent vote of con
fidence came when the United
States joined Israel Friday in a
vote against the U.N. General
Assembly's overall resolution to
condemn Israel for the Lebanese
massacres and demand an inde
pendent investigation of the inci
dent.
With Israel's delayed with
drawal. it remains to be seen
whether or not U.S. efforts to in
fluence the Begin government
will be successful. The coming
week promises to be a period of
extreme tension as the Israelis
cling to their strategic strong
holds in West Beirut, and the
multinational forces, reluctant to
be drawn into any conflict, refuse
to aid the Lebanese army until Is
raeli troops leave the area.
