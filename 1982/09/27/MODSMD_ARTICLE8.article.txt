# Israelis confused, angered by govt. action

Compiled from news reports and wire services.
News of the Beirut massacre came late
to most of the Israeli nation, but the three
day delay did little to ease the horror and
shock expressed by Israelis at the reports
of mass executions of Palestinian refugees
in an area supposedly under the super
vision of the Jewish state.
Like floods after a torrential rainfall,
news of hundreds of deaths in the Shatila
and Sabra camps of the Lebanese capitol
at the hands of Christian Phalangist
Militiamen overwhelmed the unknowing
Israeli nation which had shut down over
the weekend to observe Rosh ha-Shanah,
a Jewish holiday. Almost immediately fol
lowing first reports of the incident, mem
bers of the opposing Labor Party called
for an investigation and the removal of
Minister of Defense Ariel Sharon.
By Sunday following the killings, Israeli
Prime Minister Menachem Begin's admin
istration had denied guilt or responsibility
for the slayings and disclaimed knowledge
of Phalangist activities within the camps.
Information released in the aftermath,
however, has raised serious questions
about Israel's claim to ignorance of the
Phalangist militia's movements. Evidence
presented by an Israeli war correspondent,
Zeev Shiff, indicated that Israeli forces
knew about the mass executions 36 hours
before taking action to stop the
militiamen. And during a cabinet meeting
Communications Minister Mordechai

Zippori contradicted Foreign minister
Shamir's account of events. When Shamir
tried to say he had not heard of the execu
tions until Saturday, Zippori interjected
that he had told Shamir about the deaths
on the second morning of the two day
Phalangist raid.
Last Thursday, Sharon admitted that
Israeli forces were aware that Phalangist
militiamen had entered the Palestinian
camps, but said they believed it was only
to rout out remaining PLO guerrillas. The
Defense Minister contended that, "when
the picture became clear, when we saw the
enormity of the tragedy, it was too late to
do anything, although we intervened at
the first suspicions."
Though Sharon's revelation to Par
liament did not account for the time ele
ment presented earlier by Communica
tions Minister Zippori, Begin led the gov
erning coalition into voting down, 48-42,
an opposition effort to have an inquiry
commission named to investigate the
massacre. The commission would be inde
pendent from the government and army
and have the power to subpoena informa
tion.
Begin, whose promise to devise a means
of investigating the matter in "a suitable
manner" at a later date had done little to
quell the furor sparked by the massacre,
last Friday asked the chief justice of Is
rael's Supreme Court to head an inquiry
into the slaughter. But Chief Justice

Yitzhak Kahan declriied because of two
pending court cases asking the court to or
der an investigation in compliance with a
law providing for independent inquiry
commissions. It is not known whether Be
gin's plan would permit the issuing of sub
peonas.
Already Energy Minister Yitzhak
Berman, Menachem Milson, the civilian
administrator of the West Bank, a general
and several aides have resigned in protest
of Government handling of the massacre.
Rabbi David Saperstein, the Washing
ton representative for the Union of the
American Hebrew Congregations, sought
to explain the delicate position Israel
holds as a result of the massacre in a recent
interview with The New York Times. "If
the government of Israel persists in actions
that appear to obstruct truthfinding, Is
rael will lose the moral high ground, make
innocence look like guilt, and tarnish the
perception of Israel's position . . .
Meanwhile anger which cuts across po
litical lines resulted in organized demon
strations Saturday night. Termed the larg
est in Israel's history by security officials
the crowd more than 300,000 demonstrat
ors rallied in Tel Aviv on the eve of Yom
Kippur to demand a full investigation of
the Israeli army's involvement in the
massacre and to call for the resignations of
Begin and Sharon.
