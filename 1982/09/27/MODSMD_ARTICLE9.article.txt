## Both union, University seek to gain community sympathy during strike 
### DAVID AZRIN Senior staff writer 
As the University comes alive again with
the arrival of thousands of students, parents
and alumni for the orientation and regis
tration activities, both the University and
United Stanford Workers are particularly
anxious to gain the sympathies of the Stan
ford community.
The strike has caused minor inconve
niences for almost all members of the Stan
ford community, and pressure is mounting
for both sides to reach an agreement in the
18-day old strike.
"Whenever there's a work stoppage,"
University President Donald Kennedy told
the Daily, "there is work that is not done so
you look a little unkempt around the edges.
There's an atmosphere that is less than har
monious and we don't particularly like that.
The union has to take into account that
they are displaying before a large audience
their willingness to use other peoples incon
venience as a bargaining device."
The union has made a much stronger ef
fort than the University to present their
views by distributing leaflets and picketing
across campus.
The union has urged students to join in the
picketing and to wear green ribbons as a sign
of their support for the union.
"There seems to be a lot of interest," said
Baratz, executive secretary of United Stan
ford Workers and head of the union nego
tiating team. "People are taking leaflets.
We're starting to get people generating let

ters and wearing green ribbons."
"I hope the students will realize that we
are not unreasonable and that both sides
must bargain. We hope students will under
stand what the workers' role in their school
ing is," Baratz said.
"We have not put as strong an effort in,"
Kennedy said in an interview with the Daily.
"We think the bargaining table is the place
to settle these issues and not flyers and
leaflets and strike rhetoric.
"But there is more need for us to explain
our position," he said.
Priscilla Wheeler, head of the University
negotiating team, has sent two letters since
the strike began to faculty and staff explain
ing the University's position. Both letters
were published in the Campus Report.
The Stanford Progressive Alliance (SPA)
has asked the heads of both negotiating
teams to meet in a forum on Wednesday eve
ning. The union has agreed while the Uni
versity has refused, according to Larry Aus
ubel, a member of SPA.
Reactions by the Stanford community to
the strike appear to be mixed.
The union claims that student support for
the union is particluarly strong.
Kennedy said that he has received mixed
reactions to the strike by the Stanford com
munity, 'ranging from 'why are you such
bastards' to 'why don't you starve them.' "
Kennedy said he has received a number of
letters from faculty with differing points of
view.
The Daily obtained unsigned copies of

two letters sent to Kennedy urging the Uni
versity to resume negotiations and conclude
the strike. Informed sources told the Daily
that the letters received by Kennedy was
signed by 14 resident fellows, and the other
was signed by 22 teachers in the Western
Culture program.
According to the letters, students and resi
dent fellows will miss important social and
intellectual interactions at mealtimes, and
students will be distracted from their studies
trying to find meals.
The letter from resident fellows also ex
pressed concern about students turning their
existing negative class attitudes against
cooks and janitors into racially negative at
titudes because of the strike.
The Western Culture faculty letter raised
the possibility that the University's wage
proposal may be setting a bad example of so
cial justice for students and that it may be
difficult for the teachers in the Western Cul
ture program to prevent students' hostility
towards workers from quickly becoming ra
cial hostility as the strike continues.
Referring to the letter's sentence about the
class prejudices of Stanford students, Ken
nedy said,"l think that part of it is so un
fortunate that I hope we would not have to
have a public discussion of it. ..
"Insofar as the letters deal with matters
directly relating to the strike they are not un
reasonable and I intend to answer them ...
"I wouldn't think for a minute that having
a preponderance of minority workers on a
picket line is going to prejudice Stanford stu

dents," Kennedy said. "I give them much
more credit or good sense than that. I think
that the suggestion that Stanford students
somehow tend to have class prejudices
against workers is a wholly offensive idea.
"It is an unfortunate fact that some of the
occupations represented in the bargaining
unit that are lower paying also have a dis
proportionate representation of minorities.
"One of our objectives at Stanford has
been increasing minority representation at
all levels. And we've been more successful at
some levels than at others," he said.
Kennedy said that other letters he has re
ceived from faculty members have "said that
essentially, that in this economy, you don't
want to go too far. So I would say we've had
both kinds of faculty views."
"This strike is an absolute pain," said
Ronald Rebholz, professor of English, resi
dent fellow at Wilbur.
"My inclination is to go knock on Ken
nedy's door and ask him to come run Tranc
os," Rebholz said.
Vandalism has been widespread across
campus during the strike, and both sides are
worried about how the University com
munity will perceive these incidents.
During the first week of the strike, hinge
pins were removed from doors and cabinets
at Tresidder Union, locks were glued with

epoxy at the labor shop, water damage was
reported near Stauffer Auditorium in Hoo
ver Tower and 37 tires were slashed at
Bonair Siding.
In other acts of vandalism in the first week
of the strike toilets were plugged in the Press
Building, a stink bomb was dropped in the
lobby of Encina Hall, a bomb threat oc
curred at the Medical School, a windshield
was cracked near a picket line and spikes
were thrown under cars at the Stanford
Linear Accelerator.
Most of the vandalism has been centered
at the areas most affected by the strike, ac
cording to the Stanford Police Dept. o
Numerous scuffles have also occurred at
the picket lines. Six pickets have been ar
rested and charged with vandalism, accord
ing to Police Chief Marvin Herrington.
The number of incidents has tapered off
slightly since the first week of the strike but
remains steady, according to Herrington.
"If we find out who is doing the van
dalism, we're going to turn them in. It's sick.
Those people are misguided," said Baratz.
"We don't know who's doing it. But I'm
not going to rule out the possibility of some
hot-headed manager flattening tires or drop
ping stink bombs to make the union look
bad," he added.

curred at the Medical School, a windshield
was cracked near a picket line and spikes
were thrown under cars at the Stanford
Linear Accelerator.
Most of the vandalism has been centered
at the areas most affected by the strike, ac
cording to the Stanford Police Dept. o
Numerous scuffles have also occurred at
the picket lines. Six pickets have been ar
rested and charged with vandalism, accord
ing to Police Chief Marvin Herrington.
The number of incidents has tapered off
slightly since the first week of the strike but
remains steady, according to Herrington.
"If we find out who is doing the van
dalism, we're going to turn them in. It's sick.
Those people are misguided," said Baratz.
"We don't know who's doing it. But I'm
not going to rule out the possibility of some
hot-headed manager flattening tires or drop
ping stink bombs to make the union look
bad," he added.
As the University comes alive again with
the arrival of thousands of students, parents
and alumni for the orientation and regis
tration activities, both the University and
United Stanford Workers are particularly
anxious to gain the sympathies of the Stan
ford community.
The strike has caused minor inconve
niences for almost all members of the Stan
ford community, and pressure is mounting
for both sides to reach an agreement in the
18-day old strike.
"Whenever there's a work stoppage,"
University President Donald Kennedy told
the Daily, "there is work that is not done so
you look a little unkempt around the edges.
There's an atmosphere that is less than har
monious and we don't particularly like that.
The union has to take into account that
they are displaying before a large audience
their willingness to use other peoples incon
venience as a bargaining device."
The union has made a much stronger ef
fort than the University to present their
views by distributing leaflets and picketing
across campus.
The union has urged students to join in the
picketing and to wear green ribbons as a sign
of their support for the union.
"There seems to be a lot of interest," said
Baratz, executive secretary of United Stan
ford Workers and head of the union nego
tiating team. "People are taking leaflets.
We're starting to get people generating let

ters and wearing green ribbons."
"I hope the students will realize that we
are not unreasonable and that both sides
must bargain. We hope students will under
stand what the workers' role in their school
ing is," Baratz said.
"We have not put as strong an effort in,"
Kennedy said in an interview with the Daily.
"We think the bargaining table is the place
to settle these issues and not flyers and
leaflets and strike rhetoric.
"But there is more need for us to explain
our position," he said.
Priscilla Wheeler, head of the University
negotiating team, has sent two letters since
the strike began to faculty and staff explain
ing the University's position. Both letters
were published in the Campus Report.
The Stanford Progressive Alliance (SPA)
has asked the heads of both negotiating
teams to meet in a forum on Wednesday eve
ning. The union has agreed while the Uni
versity has refused, according to Larry Aus
ubel, a member of SPA.
Reactions by the Stanford community to
the strike appear to be mixed.
The union claims that student support for
the union is particluarly strong.
Kennedy said that he has received mixed
reactions to the strike by the Stanford com
munity, 'ranging from 'why are you such
bastards' to 'why don't you starve them.' "
Kennedy said he has received a number of
letters from faculty with differing points of
view.
The Daily obtained unsigned copies of

two letters sent to Kennedy urging the Uni
versity to resume negotiations and conclude
the strike. Informed sources told the Daily
that the letters received by Kennedy was
signed by 14 resident fellows, and the other
was signed by 22 teachers in the Western
Culture program.
According to the letters, students and resi
dent fellows will miss important social and
intellectual interactions at mealtimes, and
students will be distracted from their studies
trying to find meals.
The letter from resident fellows also ex
pressed concern about students turning their
existing negative class attitudes against
cooks and janitors into racially negative at
titudes because of the strike.
The Western Culture faculty letter raised
the possibility that the University's wage
proposal may be setting a bad example of so
cial justice for students and that it may be
difficult for the teachers in the Western Cul
ture program to prevent students' hostility
towards workers from quickly becoming ra
cial hostility as the strike continues.
Referring to the letter's sentence about the
class prejudices of Stanford students, Ken
nedy said,"l think that part of it is so un
fortunate that I hope we would not have to
have a public discussion of it. ..
"Insofar as the letters deal with matters
directly relating to the strike they are not un
reasonable and I intend to answer them ...
"I wouldn't think for a minute that having
a preponderance of minority workers on a
picket line is going to prejudice Stanford stu

dents," Kennedy said. "I give them much
more credit or good sense than that. I think
that the suggestion that Stanford students
somehow tend to have class prejudices
against workers is a wholly offensive idea.
"It is an unfortunate fact that some of the
occupations represented in the bargaining
unit that are lower paying also have a dis
proportionate representation of minorities.
"One of our objectives at Stanford has
been increasing minority representation at
all levels. And we've been more successful at
some levels than at others," he said.
Kennedy said that other letters he has re
ceived from faculty members have "said that
essentially, that in this economy, you don't
want to go too far. So I would say we've had
both kinds of faculty views."
"This strike is an absolute pain," said
Ronald Rebholz, professor of English, resi
dent fellow at Wilbur.
"My inclination is to go knock on Ken
nedy's door and ask him to come run Tranc
os," Rebholz said.
Vandalism has been widespread across
campus during the strike, and both sides are
worried about how the University com
munity will perceive these incidents.
During the first week of the strike, hinge
pins were removed from doors and cabinets
at Tresidder Union, locks were glued with

epoxy at the labor shop, water damage was
reported near Stauffer Auditorium in Hoo
ver Tower and 37 tires were slashed at
Bonair Siding.
In other acts of vandalism in the first week
of the strike toilets were plugged in the Press
Building, a stink bomb was dropped in the
lobby of Encina Hall, a bomb threat oc
curred at the Medical School, a windshield
was cracked near a picket line and spikes
were thrown under cars at the Stanford
Linear Accelerator.
