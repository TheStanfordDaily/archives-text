# Reaction to computer registration mixed
## 
### STEVE KAUFMAN 
Students already used to the long lines in the Coffee
House and the Bookstore yesterday had to contend
with vet another queue as a result of an experiment by
the registrar's office.
Among several changes in the registration process,
the familiar gray binders containing class sign-up
sheets have been replaced by IBM computer terminals
positioned yesterday in Maples Pavilion.
According to Registrar Sally Mahoney, this is the
outgrowth of a pilot project implemented last year:
"We first began using computers last year to help or
ganize the freshman English and Western Culture
programs and it met with considerable success. Sever
al departments, especially those which handle large
classes of students, contacted us about the possibility
of doing the same with their courses."
Mahoney consulted with Bill Witscher, man
agement associate for the Office of Management and
Financial Planning. With the technical help of CIT,
the new class list system was created.
The computer terminals replace the old class lists,
which students signed in order to reserve a spot in
courses with restricted enrollment. Rather than wait
in several different lines to enroll in classes offered in
various departments, the new computer system allows
the student to register for all classes at one time.
"The idea behind this one-stop registraton is to

eliminate excess waiting," explained Mahoney. "In
addition, we can provide departments with clean
alphabetical lists of their students, thereby eliminating
the process of xeroxing and organizing the old class
sign-up sheets."
The new system is meant to save time and eliminate
excess confusion from the registration process, ac
cording to Mahoney. Yet the scene at Maples Pavilion
yesterday was nothing short of horrific for some. Es
pecially during the morning crunch, several students
reported waiting nerly an hour and a half to make
class reservations. This, combined with new defer
ment procedures and pass/no credit guidelines,
created confusion for many students.
"This is the worst registration I have ever seen,"
commented sophomore Jim Myers. "With the old sys
tem, you had a short wait in a department line and
then then onro anothir. This way, you have t.<? wait
forever just to register for one class." Supporting this
idea was junior Marina Picciotto. "It was easier to reg
ister for classes by department," she said. "This way
takes longer seems much more confused than before."
The slowest time for the new system was between
9:30 and 10:30. Mahoney said this was due to pro
cedural problems, not system slow-down or failure.
"After investigating why things were taking so long,
we discovered there were many students standing in
line who didn't need to," she said. Mahoney explained

that many were under the impression that the com
puters were a replacement for turning in one's study
list, and not simply registration for restricted classes.
She also added that many students didn't consult the
time schedule.
During lunch, Mahoney briefed ushers to explain to
students in line about who should be there, as well as
bringing an additional four terminals on line. This,
( said Mahoney, brought the waiting time down to un
der a half-hour by afternoon.
"The queue is much shorter now," Witscher ob
served later in the afternoon. "Like with any Monday
registration, things between 9 and 11 are always the
slowest. The operators are more used to what's going
on and the students are more oriented as to our pro
cedure. It's been a learning process for everyone to
day."
If the system in fact proves to be more time effec
tive, one-stop class sign-ups will become a permanent
part of the registration process. Mahoney emphasized
the experimental nature of the project and is unsure as
to its luture. "We have to look if it was cost effective
as well as time saving. We plan on getting written stu
dent input about how they felt about this and will then
evaluate its performance in a few weeks, when we
have completed registration.
"Overall, though, I'd say things have gone quite
smoothly."

REGISTRATION WAIT:
Thousands of disgruntled students
faced lons lines yesterday when they
registered for classes in Maples
Pavillion. Problems and confusion
caused by a new computer regis
traion system seemed to be respon
sible for much of the delay.
