## Priscilla Wheeler USW's demands are excessive; pay must compete with market 
### 
The University says that it has
bargained in good faith and placed a
fair offer on the table. The union says
that the University can afford to pay
much more, that the offer is less than
other staff at Stanford are receiving and
that the University is refusing to nego
tiate. Such differences in perception re
sult from misunderstandings about two
things: the nature of the economic
forces now acting on universities, and
the character of the collective bargain
ing process.
Stanford is often thought of as a
"rich" university. It does indeed have a
larger endowment than many schools
— but as a charitable trust, it must ex
ercise fiscal responsibility to keep that
endowment intact and maintain a bal-

competitive with those
provided to similar
employees by
comparable employers.

anced budget. In that budget, the signif
icant income sources are tuition, funds
given by the government for the general
support of research and earnings on its
endowment. Of those the University
can only control tuition. Thus the ma
jor annual increases in expenses, such as
salaries and energy, must come primari
ly from sources such as tuition increases
or reduction in the expenses for items
such as academic programs and student
aid. Obviously, though, there are limits
as to the amount of tuition increase and
program and financial aid cuts. Last
year the University made substantial
expense reductions, partly so that facul
ty and staff salaries would move up with
inflation. This past spring improve
ments in salaries for faculty and clerical

workers were announced to make their
pay competitive with that offered by
outside employees.
The union has claimed it should re
ceive a wage increase that exactly
matches or betters these. In fact exact
comparability is neither fair nor reason
able. University faculty and staff do dif
ferent jobs, are comparable with dif
ferent "markets " and have different
compensation structures and histories.
The total offer made to the union would
provide wages and benefits very com
petitive with those provided to similar
employees by comparable employers,
including the University Hospital; it is
substantially above the current infla
tion rate; and it is about twice about the
national average for negotiated new
contract agreements in this year.
The-University's offer was developed
through negotiations at the bargaining
table. In collective bargaining there are
two quite different approaches — a par
ty may start with proposals far from
any reasonable goal at which it ul
timately wishes to arrive, or it may start
fairly close to that ultimate point. The
first approach subsequently allows
large and seemingly dramatic moves by
the party but places the party in the in
itial position of making proposals that
are not particularly credible. ("We have
reduced our demands by one-half— we
now want only a 50 percent increase.")
The second approach provides
credibility because the proposals are
close to an ultimate reasonable goal,
but restricts the party's ability to move
significantly further.
In this case, the union has used the
first bargaining approach, and the Uni
versity the second. Thus, the union was
able to make many moves away from its
proposals because the proposals were
excessive to begin with, while the Uni
versity has been able to make only small
moves, because it chose to make pro
posals that were reasonable and
credible to begin with. The University's

negotiating team advised the union at
the time of its proposals that the Uni
versity was not holding back significant
amounts, but was making proposals
very close to the University's ultimate
goal.

Thus, the union was able
to make many moves
away from its proposals
because the proposals
were excessive to begin
with...

Where have these efforts led? The
University made a final offer because
the union had stopped making signifi
cant moves. A final offer, as the union is
aware, does not mean that the union
must accept that proposal precisely as it
was structured by the University. The
purpose of the offer was to alert the
union to the fact that the University's
ability to make further major com
promise was exhausted and to provide
the union with a clear and candid in
dication of the University's viewpoint.
Obviously the University was signaling
that it would accept anything reason
ably close to its offer. Equally obvious,
the University would not accept pro
posals that are as excessive as those the
union has been making during the
strike.
At this point the union continues to
strike and to claim its decision was
forced by the University. Yet, the
choice to strike was USW's. Strikes are
not necessary to the resolution of con
tract disputes. The University would
have continued negotiating in good
faith and would have worked hard to
reach agreement with or without a
strike; and it will settle only on terms
that it believes it can responsibly ap
prove, with or without a strike.

credibility because the proposals are
close to an ultimate reasonable goal,
but restricts the party's ability to move
significantly further.
In this case, the union has used the
first bargaining approach, and the Uni
versity the second. Thus, the union was
able to make many moves away from its
proposals because the proposals were
excessive to begin with, while the Uni
versity has been able to make only small
moves, because it chose to make pro
posals that were reasonable and
credible to begin with. The University's

negotiating team advised the union at
the time of its proposals that the Uni
versity was not holding back significant
amounts, but was making proposals
very close to the University's ultimate
goal.

Thus, the union was able
to make many moves
away from its proposals
because the proposals
were excessive to begin
with...

Where have these efforts led? The
University made a final offer because
the union had stopped making signifi
cant moves. A final offer, as the union is
aware, does not mean that the union
must accept that proposal precisely as it
was structured by the University. The
purpose of the offer was to alert the
union to the fact that the University's
ability to make further major com
promise was exhausted and to provide
the union with a clear and candid in
dication of the University's viewpoint.
Obviously the University was signaling
that it would accept anything reason
ably close to its offer. Equally obvious,
the University would not accept pro
posals that are as excessive as those the
union has been making during the
strike.
At this point the union continues to
strike and to claim its decision was
forced by the University. Yet, the
choice to strike was USW's. Strikes are
not necessary to the resolution of con
tract disputes. The University would
have continued negotiating in good
faith and would have worked hard to
reach agreement with or without a
strike; and it will settle only on terms
that it believes it can responsibly ap
prove, with or without a strike.
