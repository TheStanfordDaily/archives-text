## Bargaining stances must be justified 
### 
The Stanford Progressive Alliance
has scheduled an open forum on "Stu
dents and the Strike" for tomorrow eve
ning, and has invited negotiators for
both the University and the union to
participate.
Michael Baratz, the chief union ne
gotiator, has accepted our invitation;
unfortunately, our response from
Priscilla Wheeler, the top University
negotiator, has thus far been negative.
Students, without food service, and
workers, without paychecks, are bear
ing the brunt of a strike which has al
ready gone too long. All parties in the
dispute ought to be willing to publicly
justify their positions, particularly the
University administrators who would
appear to be personally suffering the
least of any members of the Stanford
community.
It is incumbent upon both the union
and the University to keep the campus
community informed of the progress of
the negotiations, to justify their
bargaining positions and to answer our
questions. An open dialogue on the is
sues can only speed the dispute to settle
ment; any less represents an abdication
of responsibility.
