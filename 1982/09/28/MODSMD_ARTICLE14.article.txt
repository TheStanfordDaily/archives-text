## Ultimatum forced stalemate

United Stanford Workers, Local 7IS,
Service Employees International Union
members are on strike to protest the
University's unfair labor practices and
because management is bargaining in
bad faith.
We have been negotiating for a new
contract for more than two months
with management negotiator Priscilla
Wheeler. On Sept. 7, we were presented
with a take-it-or-leave-it final proposal
by Wheeler. We were left without an
opportunity to counter the proposal.
Since the proposal did not resolve the
major issues involved, we were left with
no alternative but to reject it.
The University has been ordered by
the National Labor Relations Board
(NLRB) to provide the union with in
formation about contracting union
work to temporary non-union mem
bers. This information is required to be
provided to the union so we can bargain

effectively for our members. The Uni
versity has refused to provide the in
formation and now the NLRB is suing
in Federal Court to enforce its order.
The University has repeatedly con
tended that the union is proposing to re
strict students and scientists from work
ing. This is completely untrue. The
union has no proposals on the bargain
ing table regarding students and scien
tists that would change existing prac
tices.
In fact, the union has proposed that it
receive information about contractors,
temporaries and job-shoppers concern
ing what work they are preforming and
why union members can't do the work.
The University continues to refuse to
provide this information despite a rul
ing by a labor judge and despite the
union's strike.
The University is also trying to force
the union to accept a three-year con
tract with raises of 9.5 percent in the

first year and 5 percent in the second
and third years. In addition, a new
fourth step was proposed for the step
plan. The step would begin in the sec
ond year of the contract with 2.5 per
cent paid in the second year and 2.5 per
cent paid in the third year. This would
mean that a worker on step 3, depend
ing on how long they were on that step,
could get a raise over the five percent
wage increase of up to 2.5 percent more
in the second year (total of 7.5 percent),
in addition, the offer includes a cost of
living adjustment in the third year that
would only go into effect if the cost of
living rose more than 20 percent in the
next two years. Even if that happened,
we would only realize an additional one
cent per hour raise. Priscilla Wheeler
has said that we have been offered from
24.5 percent to 29.5 percent over three
years. The actual offer is a maximum of
24.5 percent and could be as low as 22
percent. Wheeler is lying.
Most of our membership is 10 to 30
percent behind outside rates for similar
work. While 9.5 percent sounds good,
the length of the contract and the
smaller raises in the second and third
years are clearly inadequate; ,*
University President Donald Hen-,
nedy describes his pay offer as "gener
ous," yet other University employees,
like clericals, faculty, and management,
have all received higher pay raises than
we are being offered. In the past three
years, clericals have received up to
40.25 percent in raises while union
members have received 27.5 percent in
raises. Faculty and managers have also
revived, or are eligible for, higher
raises than we have received.
Medical and dental benefits for Stan
ford employees are substandard as well
when compared to the major employers
in Santa Clara County. Workers are
currently paying up to $82 per month
for dependent medical coverage.
Health premiums will probably go up
severely over the term of a three-year
contract. Workers taking home $800
per month will have to pay $400 to $800
per year more for health care.
Thus, a good portion of the pros
pective pay raises will disappear. The
University refuses to avert this by offer
ing help to protect the union from medi
cal premium increases.
Kennedy and Vice Presidents Wil
liam Massy and A 1 Hastorf are direct

ing Wheeler in these negotiations.
These men do not like the idea that
bargaining is a two-way street. All of
Wheeler's offers are ultimatums, not
compromises.
The University's strategy is clear.
They offer higher raises to employees
who are not represented by the union
and lower raises to union workers.
Raises of 10 percent or more have been
agreed to or announced for non-exempt
staff (clerical workers/associates etc.)
and for security personnel and 10.5 per
cent for faculty. The operating budget
for 1982-83 has increased by 14.5 per
cent. Stanford is not the financially
troubled Chrysler Corporation, but one
of the richest universities in the world.
Wheeler has admitted in negotiations
that the University is able to pay more
than they are offering. It is a planned
decision to offer us less. This is not "fair
and reasonable," as Wheeler has char
acterized management's position. This
is union-busting.

Bargaining involves
movement on both sides.
That is not part of the
UniversityV
management style.
They have decided to
force us on strike and
then break our union,
just like the famous
union-buster, J.P.
Stevens.

We arc asking to be treated at least as
fairly as other University employees.

Clerical workers have tried to or
ganize and Stanford Hospital workers
will be voting on union representation
soon. Management has forced us into
this strike to teach a lesson to anyone
who would dare to expect to be treated
with dignity and respect. I cannot let
this happen to our union.
