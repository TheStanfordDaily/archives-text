## Talented directors in strange spaces 'Tempest' 
### STEVE VINEBERG 
In his best films — Bob and Carol and Ted and
Alice, Blume in Love, Harry and Tonto and Next
Stop, Greenwich Village — Paul Mazursky got
even closer to the hip lifestyles he satirized than
Woody Allen did in Annie Hall, but his over
blown, overlong Tempest, like Allen's A Mid
summer Night's Sex Comedy, harkens back to
Shakespeare. This is Mazursky's Big Personal
Movie, and he couldn't have timed it worse: he
lost his sense of humor in An Unmarried Wom
an, his sense of drama in Willie and Phil, and he
hasn't recovered either. In fact, in Tempest he
appears to have lost his mind; rather than in
spiring us with awe for the audacity of attempt
ing a modern American retelling of
Shakespeare's last play, the movie is more apt
to make moviegoers throw up their hands in de
spair. The irony of pictures like Tempest and
Francis Coppola's similarly lunatic One from
the Heart is that there's nothing really personal
about them: perhaps partly because of the pres
ence of John Cassavetes and Gena Rowlands in
the cast, much of Tempest has the lumpy im
provisational style of Cassavetes' own psy
chodramas rather than the quirky warmth one
associates with Mazursky.
Shakespeare's The Tempest has been recast in
the mold of a western (Yellow Sky) and, most

cleverly, a science fiction fantasy (Forbidden
Planet but converting it into a tale of a New
York architect in the throes of a midlife crisis
belongs to the realm of truly terrible ideas.
has worked out an intricate scheme
to transpose all of Shakespeare's characters:
Phil/Prospero (Cassavetes), his 14-year-old
daughter Miranda (Molly Ringwald) and his
mistress Aretha/Ariel (Susan Sarandon) take
refuge on a remote Greek island so that Phil can
be free of his gangster boss Alonzo (VUtorio
Gassman), now the lover of Phil's wife An
tonia/Antonio (Rowlands), and so that Miran
da won't have to be remanded to her mother's
custody. The only other inhabitant of the island
is a crazy goatherd, Kalibanos/Caliban (Raul
Julia), who lives in a cave and lusts after Miran
da — until the arrival of Alonzo's storm-tossed
yacht,., depositing Alonzo, his son
Freddy/Ferdinand (Sam Robards), his en
tourage (including a doctor and a stand-up
comic — variations on Shakespeare's Stephano
and Trinculo) and Antonia on Phil's island
shores.
Mazursky employs a scrambled flashback
structure, shuttling back and forth between the
island paradise and New York, and shifting
styles with the same maddening arbitrariness.
It's an improvised slapstick quest parody filled
with soliloquies and spontaneous songs and
dances. I'm not sure why he thought having ac

tors dance Zorba-like on the sand to a chorus of
"Loony tunes, loony-toony-toony tunes," or
training his camera on the heads of goats while
piping in Liza Minnelli's rendition of "New
York, New York," would work. The only musi
cal interlude that takes off is a duet of "Why Do
Fools Fall in Love?" sung by Susan Sarandon
and Molly Ringwald at the ocean's edge. Per
haps the secret ingredient in this scene is that de
spite all the theatrical gladhanding in this movie
(nearly everyone who ventures onto the island
seems to suffer from terminal heartiness), only
Sarandon and Ringwald offer appealing per
formances.
Molly Ringwald is the film's real find: her
dark hair clipped short and her intelligence
smoldering in her eyes — a pixie with a genius
IQ — she gives Miranda soft, modest spirit and
an automatic defense system against the on
slaught of a world full of bickering parents.
Ringwald is so geniune that she even sails
through a soliloquy on a hillside without em
barassing herself. She and Susan Sarandon,
whose body glows as if she carried the Mediter
ranean sun around inside her, are the only is
lands of sanity in Mazursky's whole crazy mov
ie.
'A Midsummer Night's
Sex Comedy'
The title of Woody Allen's latest picture, A
Midsummer Night's Sex Comedy, points in the
direction of Shakespeare and Ingmar Bergman.
When Bergman made his great romantic com
edy Smiles of a Summer Night in 1955, he was
thinking of Shakespeare too: he built the second
half around a country idyll that effects ir
revocable changes on the characters' love lives,
as in A Midsummer Night's Dream. Allen's Sex
Comedy emerges from a rich heritage that also
includes Chekhov's The Sea Gull and two of the
best Renoir films, A Day in the Country and The
Rules of the Game, and he draws on all of these
sources — the movie bustles with homages.
In a bucolic setting, Andrew (Allen) and his
sexually reticent wife Adrian (Mary Steen
burgen) gather together a small party of friends:
a pompous professor, Leopold (Jose Ferrer);
his fiancee, Ariel (Mia Farrow), an old flame of
Andrew's; Maxwell (Tony Roberts), a randy
physician who falls for Ariel and conceives a
correspondingly speedy distaste for Leopold;
and Maxwell's weekend companion, Dulcy
(Julie Hagerty), a delectable sexy nurse whose
advice Adrian seeks in an effort to please her
frustrated husband. Audiences familiar with
Smiles or the musical based on it, A Little Night
Music, will see that each of these characters and
each plot entanglement has its origin in
Bergman. Allen has further provided a coun
terpart to the fairies and the love potion in Mid
summer Night's Dream: Andrew keeps a "spirit

ball" that conjurcs up spcctcrs on which each of
the characters imposes his own interpretations.
If Woody Allen had made this movie six or
seven years ago, we would have know just what
to expect of it — a parody, probably in the style
of Love and Death — and it might have been
hilarious and a little snobbish, like the burles
ques of literature, painting and dance in his
books Getting Even and Without Feathers. But
Allen no longer makes simple comedies; he
passed the point of no return with Annie Hall
(his last good film, I think). Since then, his mov
ies have become less funny and more obsessive
and self-serious. You can't return to Love and
Death after you've made something like In
teriors, which tries to imitate the "art" pictures
sent up in the early comedies, or after a self-con
gratulatory confessional jag like Manhattan or
Stardust Memories. Few movies have ever de
clared war on an audience the way Stardust
Memories did; moviegoers had to run for cover
under their seats to avoid the showers of venom
being rained from the screen. No wonder Sex
Comedy is such a difficult movie to get a handle

on — for Allen as well as for us. He's back in
Bergman territory, but this time he's lost there,
as if he wanted to have fun but couldn't shake
off the authority of Interiors. The result is a
bizarrely ill-at-ease movie — a sex farce for
anhedonics.
This confusion accounts for the complex of
stylistic and emotional puzzles in the film. Allen
chose an early-twentieth-century setting, but as
an actor he has a distinctly contemporary per
sona, and his philosophical dialogues with
