# The 						resurfacing of Paul Desmond
## 
### TED GIOIA 
For much of his 26-year career,
saxophonist Paul Desmond
found his musical skills over
shadowed by the work of his
long-time friend and col
laborator Dave Brubeck.
Brubeck, who studied with the
classical composer Darius
Milhaud in the late '40s, was a
pioneer in the synthesis of jazz
and classical music — his piano
work was an amalgam of a
number of elements seemingly al
ien to jazz: dense harmonies, a
studied sense of rhythm and odd
time signatures.
Brubeck was, and still is, much
maligned by jazz critics who saw
his musical experiments as being
pretentious rather than daring
and who resented his status as an
academically trained musician (a
reputation which was more the
product of journalistic hype than
of anything Brubeck himself ever
said). To a certain extent the
critics were justified in their
caustic evaluations: Brubeck is,
in fact, only a mediocre pianist,
and his choice of odd-time signa
tures often served only to further
expose his own rhythmic prob
lems. But at the same time post
erity will undoubtedly justify
many of Brubeck's apparent ex
cesses — most notably his har
monic innovations which pre
figure the later work of such dis
parate individuals as Cecil Tay
lor and Bill Evans (both, unlike
Brubeck, much-praised darlings
of jazz critics) and which are, in
their own way, building blocks of
modern jazz piano.
Yet Paul Desmond, who
passed away in 1977 after a long

bout with cancer, was the unsung
hero of the Brubeck Quartet;
even more than the group's lead
er, Desmond was instrumental in
shaping the ensemble's dis
tinctive sound. His lyrical alto
tone is immediately identifiable
and his ingenious compositions
(which include "Take 5" — the
group's biggest hit) were an im
portant part of the band's reper
toire.
Althought not a student of
Milhaud's, Desmond was in
volved with Brubeck's ex
perimental work almost from the
start. His affinity for an academ
ically refined approach to jazz
was also revealed in other ways
— most markedly in his intona
tion, which was remarkably pure,
especially when contrasted with
the "dirtier" sound favored by
many of his contemporaries.
Coming to prominence amidst
the Dionysian excesses of bebop,
Desmond exemplified Apollo
nian restraint. In retrospect, the
innovations which Charlie
Parker and Dizzy Gillespie
brought to jazz after World War
II must be viewed as initiating
jazz's period of romanticism; this
era — which spanned less than 20
years from, roughly, the early
recordings of John Coltrane —
saw the musician emerge as a
charismatic type of guru/artist
who would push self-expression
to its physical and emotional lim
its. Yet the music was seen by
many as almost incidental in
comparison with the symbolic
quality of the lifestyles practiced
by the music's most noted expo
nents.
Viewed in this perspective,

Desmond's playing appears pe
culiar if not actually
anachronistic. To those weaned
on stronger brews, Desmond's
self-effacing melodicism often
appears to be a tepid attempt to
create a type of "highbrow"
background music. Yet in cases
such as these Desmond proves
only that he is too subtle for the
casual listener. Upon closer in
spection, his solos reveal a con
struction which is almost com
positional in nature — indeed he

treats his music with a reflective
care which almost defies the im
provisational process. Yet be
cause of this hidden depth to his
music, Desmond is not only
criticized unjustly, but is also ad
mired for the wrong reasons —
essentially for the "prettiness" of
his playing, rather than for its
substance.
The Fantasy reissue Dave
Brubeck/Paul Desmond makes
available the long out-of-print
recordings made shortly after the

quartet's formation. Desmond
was only 27 when the first of
these sessions took place, yet far
from showing any musical im
maturity (which for most musi
cians is exemplified by the ten
dency to copy slavishly the
playing of their predecessors) the
saxophonist was already showing
the essential features of his own
distinctive style.
A comparison between
Desmond and his contemporary
Charlie Parker is illuminating.

Parker, the most celebrated sax
ophonist of modern jazz, was at
his best when the tempos were
fast and the chord structures
were complex: his virtuosity de
lighted in musical obstacle
courses such as Ko-Ko (available
on Savoy) or The Hymn (avail
able on Warner Brothers).
Desmond, in contrast, seldom
played at very fast tempos, and
when he did one sensed that it


was done unwillingly — not that
his technique was not equal to the
tasks; rather it was Desmond's
overriding concern with creating
a melodic and thematically or
ganized improvisation that led
him to eschew the facile glibness
of many of the beboppers. Unlike
those players of less talent who
follow a credo of "let your fingers
do the walking," Desmond
played a thinking man's jazz with
solos that often made punning
reference to other compositions
and improvisations. A case in
point is Desmond's solo in "You
Go To My Head," included in
the Fantasy reissue, in which he
inserts a quote from Parker's
"Cool Blues" (giving the lie to
those who claim that Desmond
was oblivious to that musician's
work) in the midst of a most un-
Parker-like passage.
Brubeck also contributes some
of his most inspired work in these
early recordings. His debts to
twentieth century classical music,

which were often obscured in his
later work and have virtually dis
appeared from his playing today,
come to the fore in these per
formances. His solo piano work
on "Over the Rainbow" is full of
shifting, on-the-beat, 11th and
13th chords and sharps dis
sonances, and in the recapitula
tion of the melody, Brubeck
moves into the minor mode, giv
ing this children's song a strange
dirge-like quality.
Despite the obvious virtues of
most of the album, a few of the
pieces seem strikingly out of
place. The quartet's work on
numbers such as "Jeepers
Creepers" and "Blue Moon"
takes us from the concert hall to
the cocktail lounge with its use of
stock musical effects which must
have been old hat even in the ear
ly '50s.
During their more adven
turous moments, however, the
group was able to create music
that sounds fresh and vibrant a
generation later. In the two ver
sions of "Trolley Song" found on
the album, for example, Brubeck
is able to revitalize the standard
with his use of a repeated
rhythmic riff which is more remi

niscent of Stravinsky than it is of
anything in the jazz repetoire.
The first version was obviously
never intended for release as
Brubcck repeatedly stops the mu
sic to exhort his fellow musicians
on to a more rhythmically sure
performance; at one point he re
marks: "Listen, if I'm going to
play this" — referring to an espe
cially complex rhythmic motif —
"Boy, I want you guys in on the
beats you're gonna play as hard
as you can play." Comparing the
two versions, one gains an en
lightening sense of the intricacies
involved in constructing a jazz
arrangement. In this case the ar
rangement is ably assisted by an
ingenious Desmond solo.
These initial recordings by the
Brubeck Quartet were the first in
a long line of over forty albums
featuring Brubeck and
Desmond. Two years after these
sides were made the band entered
its long period of commercial
success when Brubeck was fea
tured on the cover of Time maga
zine. The later works, however,
were highly polished examples of
quartet jazz which, despite their
other merits, lacked the probing
excitement of the early attempts

cially complex rhythmic motif —
"Boy, I want you guys in on the
beats you're gonna play as hard
as you can play." Comparing the
two versions, one gains an en
lightening sense of the intricacies
involved in constructing a jazz
arrangement. In this case the ar
rangement is ably assisted by an
ingenious Desmond solo.
These initial recordings by the
Brubeck Quartet were the first in
a long line of over forty albums
featuring Brubeck and
Desmond. Two years after these
sides were made the band entered
its long period of commercial
success when Brubeck was fea
tured on the cover of Time maga
zine. The later works, however,
were highly polished examples of
quartet jazz which, despite their
other merits, lacked the probing
excitement of the early attempts

For much of his 26-year career,
saxophonist Paul Desmond
found his musical skills over
shadowed by the work of his
long-time friend and col
laborator Dave Brubeck.
Brubeck, who studied with the
classical composer Darius
Milhaud in the late '40s, was a
pioneer in the synthesis of jazz
and classical music — his piano
work was an amalgam of a
number of elements seemingly al
ien to jazz: dense harmonies, a
studied sense of rhythm and odd
time signatures.
Brubeck was, and still is, much
maligned by jazz critics who saw
his musical experiments as being
pretentious rather than daring
and who resented his status as an
academically trained musician (a
reputation which was more the
product of journalistic hype than
of anything Brubeck himself ever
said). To a certain extent the
critics were justified in their
caustic evaluations: Brubeck is,
in fact, only a mediocre pianist,
and his choice of odd-time signa
tures often served only to further
expose his own rhythmic prob
lems. But at the same time post
erity will undoubtedly justify
many of Brubeck's apparent ex
cesses — most notably his har
monic innovations which pre
figure the later work of such dis
parate individuals as Cecil Tay
lor and Bill Evans (both, unlike
Brubeck, much-praised darlings
of jazz critics) and which are, in
their own way, building blocks of
modern jazz piano.
Yet Paul Desmond, who
passed away in 1977 after a long

bout with cancer, was the unsung
hero of the Brubeck Quartet;
even more than the group's lead
er, Desmond was instrumental in
shaping the ensemble's dis
tinctive sound. His lyrical alto
tone is immediately identifiable
and his ingenious compositions
(which include "Take 5" — the
group's biggest hit) were an im
portant part of the band's reper
toire.
Althought not a student of
Milhaud's, Desmond was in
volved with Brubeck's ex
perimental work almost from the
start. His affinity for an academ
ically refined approach to jazz
was also revealed in other ways
— most markedly in his intona
tion, which was remarkably pure,
especially when contrasted with
the "dirtier" sound favored by
many of his contemporaries.
Coming to prominence amidst
the Dionysian excesses of bebop,
Desmond exemplified Apollo
nian restraint. In retrospect, the
innovations which Charlie
Parker and Dizzy Gillespie
brought to jazz after World War
II must be viewed as initiating
jazz's period of romanticism; this
era — which spanned less than 20
years from, roughly, the early
recordings of John Coltrane —
saw the musician emerge as a
charismatic type of guru/artist
who would push self-expression
to its physical and emotional lim
its. Yet the music was seen by
many as almost incidental in
comparison with the symbolic
quality of the lifestyles practiced
by the music's most noted expo
nents.
Viewed in this perspective,

Desmond's playing appears pe
culiar if not actually
anachronistic. To those weaned
on stronger brews, Desmond's
self-effacing melodicism often
appears to be a tepid attempt to
create a type of "highbrow"
background music. Yet in cases
such as these Desmond proves
only that he is too subtle for the
casual listener. Upon closer in
spection, his solos reveal a con
struction which is almost com
positional in nature — indeed he

treats his music with a reflective
care which almost defies the im
provisational process. Yet be
cause of this hidden depth to his
music, Desmond is not only
criticized unjustly, but is also ad
mired for the wrong reasons —
essentially for the "prettiness" of
his playing, rather than for its
substance.
The Fantasy reissue Dave
Brubeck/Paul Desmond makes
available the long out-of-print
recordings made shortly after the

quartet's formation. Desmond
was only 27 when the first of
these sessions took place, yet far
from showing any musical im
maturity (which for most musi
cians is exemplified by the ten
dency to copy slavishly the
playing of their predecessors) the
saxophonist was already showing
the essential features of his own
distinctive style.
A comparison between
Desmond and his contemporary
Charlie Parker is illuminating.

Parker, the most celebrated sax
ophonist of modern jazz, was at
his best when the tempos were
fast and the chord structures
were complex: his virtuosity de
lighted in musical obstacle
courses such as Ko-Ko (available
on Savoy) or The Hymn (avail
able on Warner Brothers).
Desmond, in contrast, seldom
played at very fast tempos, and
when he did one sensed that it


was done unwillingly — not that
his technique was not equal to the
tasks; rather it was Desmond's
overriding concern with creating
a melodic and thematically or
ganized improvisation that led
him to eschew the facile glibness
of many of the beboppers. Unlike
those players of less talent who
follow a credo of "let your fingers
do the walking," Desmond
played a thinking man's jazz with
solos that often made punning
reference to other compositions
and improvisations. A case in
point is Desmond's solo in "You
Go To My Head," included in
the Fantasy reissue, in which he
inserts a quote from Parker's
"Cool Blues" (giving the lie to
those who claim that Desmond
was oblivious to that musician's
work) in the midst of a most un-
Parker-like passage.
Brubeck also contributes some
of his most inspired work in these
early recordings. His debts to
twentieth century classical music,

which were often obscured in his
later work and have virtually dis
appeared from his playing today,
come to the fore in these per
formances. His solo piano work
on "Over the Rainbow" is full of
shifting, on-the-beat, 11th and
13th chords and sharps dis
sonances, and in the recapitula
tion of the melody, Brubeck
moves into the minor mode, giv
ing this children's song a strange
dirge-like quality.
Despite the obvious virtues of
most of the album, a few of the
pieces seem strikingly out of
place. The quartet's work on
numbers such as "Jeepers
Creepers" and "Blue Moon"
takes us from the concert hall to
the cocktail lounge with its use of
stock musical effects which must
have been old hat even in the ear
ly '50s.
During their more adven
turous moments, however, the
group was able to create music
that sounds fresh and vibrant a
generation later. In the two ver
sions of "Trolley Song" found on
the album, for example, Brubeck
is able to revitalize the standard
with his use of a repeated
rhythmic riff which is more remi

niscent of Stravinsky than it is of
anything in the jazz repetoire.
The first version was obviously
never intended for release as
Brubcck repeatedly stops the mu
sic to exhort his fellow musicians
on to a more rhythmically sure
performance; at one point he re
marks: "Listen, if I'm going to
play this" — referring to an espe
cially complex rhythmic motif —
"Boy, I want you guys in on the
beats you're gonna play as hard
as you can play." Comparing the
