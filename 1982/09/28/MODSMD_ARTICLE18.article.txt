# The resurfacing of Paul Desmond
## 
### TED GIOIA 
For much of his 26-year career,
saxophonist Paul Desmond
found his musical skills over
shadowed by the work of his
long-time friend and col
laborator Dave Brubeck.
Brubeck, who studied with the
classical composer Darius
Milhaud in the late '40s, was a
pioneer in the synthesis of jazz
and classical music — his piano
work was an amalgam of a
number of elements seemingly al
ien to jazz: dense harmonies, a
studied sense of rhythm and odd
time signatures.
Brubeck was, and still is, much
maligned by jazz critics who saw
his musical experiments as being
pretentious rather than daring
and who resented his status as an
academically trained musician (a
reputation which was more the
product of journalistic hype than
of anything Brubeck himself ever
said). To a certain extent the
critics were justified in their
caustic evaluations: Brubeck is,
in fact, only a mediocre pianist,
and his choice of odd-time signa
tures often served only to further
expose his own rhythmic prob
lems. But at the same time post
erity will undoubtedly justify
many of Brubeck's apparent ex
cesses — most notably his har
monic innovations which pre
figure the later work of such dis
parate individuals as Cecil Tay
lor and Bill Evans (both, unlike
Brubeck, much-praised darlings
of jazz critics) and which are, in
their own way, building blocks of
modern jazz piano.
Yet Paul Desmond, who
passed away in 1977 after a long

bout with cancer, was the unsung
hero of the Brubeck Quartet;
even more than the group's lead
er, Desmond was instrumental in
shaping the ensemble's dis
tinctive sound. His lyrical alto
tone is immediately identifiable
and his ingenious compositions
(which include "Take 5" — the
group's biggest hit) were an im
portant part of the band's reper
toire.
Althought not a student of
Milhaud's, Desmond was in
volved with Brubeck's ex
perimental work almost from the
start. His affinity for an academ
ically refined approach to jazz
was also revealed in other ways
— most markedly in his intona
tion, which was remarkably pure,
especially when contrasted with
the "dirtier" sound favored by
many of his contemporaries.
Coming to prominence amidst
the Dionysian excesses of bebop,
Desmond exemplified Apollo
nian restraint. In retrospect, the
innovations which Charlie
Parker and Dizzy Gillespie
brought to jazz after World War
II must be viewed as initiating
jazz's period of romanticism; this
era — which spanned less than 20
years from, roughly, the early
recordings of John Coltrane —
saw the musician emerge as a
charismatic type of guru/artist
who would push self-expression
to its physical and emotional lim
its. Yet the music was seen by
many as almost incidental in
comparison with the symbolic
quality of the lifestyles practiced
by the music's most noted expo
nents.
Viewed in this perspective,

Desmond's playing appears pe
culiar if not actually
anachronistic. To those weaned
on stronger brews, Desmond's
self-effacing melodicism often
appears to be a tepid attempt to
create a type of "highbrow"
background music. Yet in cases
such as these Desmond proves
only that he is too subtle for the
casual listener. Upon closer in
spection, his solos reveal a con
struction which is almost com
positional in nature — indeed he

treats his music with a reflective
care which almost defies the im
provisational process. Yet be
cause of this hidden depth to his
music, Desmond is not only
criticized unjustly, but is also ad
mired for the wrong reasons —
essentially for the "prettiness" of
his playing, rather than for its
substance.
The Fantasy reissue Dave
Brubeck/Paul Desmond makes
available the long out-of-print
recordings made shortly after the

quartet's formation. Desmond
was only 27 when the first of
these sessions took place, yet far
from showing any musical im
maturity (which for most musi
cians is exemplified by the ten
dency to copy slavishly the
playing of their predecessors) the
saxophonist was already showing
the essential features of his own
distinctive style.
A comparison between
Desmond and his contemporary
Charlie Parker is illuminating.

Parker, the most celebrated sax
ophonist of modern jazz, was at
his best when the tempos were
fast and the chord structures
were complex: his virtuosity de
lighted in musical obstacle
courses such as Ko-Ko (available
on Savoy) or The Hymn (avail
able on Warner Brothers).
Desmond, in contrast, seldom
played at very fast tempos, and
when he did one sensed that it
