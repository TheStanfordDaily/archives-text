Azymuth
Great American Music Hall
San Francisco
Tuesday, Sept. 18
It was a different show last
Tuesday night at the Great
American Music Flail.
Not different because the
band, Azymuth, played unusual
sounding tunes, but different be
cause of the way they played
them.
Azymuth is from Brazil and
has incorporated little American
culture into either its songs or its
live performances. The trio, with
bass, drums and keyboards,
plays smooth, mellow
jazz/fusion with a heavy Latin
influence. That influence is not
displayed in the form of heavy
percussion, however, but in the
way each of the three play their
individual instruments.
The bassist, though he pops
and slaps, does so with his index

finger instead of his thumb. The
drummer plays Latin-influenced
beats, but with the "wrong" end
of the drum sticks. The key
boardist produces slow, un
complicated piano chords, but
interjects them at almost unex
pected times.
Another interesting note about
Azymuth is, although the band
has released several albums, last
week's GAMH show was its first
ever in San Francisco. It wasn't
even done as part of a tour, but as
a sidestep to a recording date
with Milestone Records and
Fantasy Studios in Berkeley.
The biggest problem Azymuth
is going to face in the coming
years is that only three people —
drummer Ivan Conti, bassist
Alex Malheiros and keyboardist
Jose Bertrami — compose the
basis of the group. In today's
jazz/fusion world, it is extremely
difficult to create a full enough
sound while retaining diversity in

songs and imagination in solos to
satisfy an audience with just three
band members. A four- or even
five-piece group has no problem
when it comes time to solo, as
there are many instruments to
choose from for soloing honors.
And although groups like
Pieces of a Dream have proven
that three can survive playing
jazz/fusion, Azymuth is going to
have to do some improving to
prove that as well.
If Azymuth had an American
producer (keyboardist Jose
Bertrami has present honors),
they would probably be already
into jazz/fusion stardom. But
that doesn't seem to be
Azymuth's style. They play like
Brazilians, they talk like Brazil
ians, they are Brazilians. They
produce like them, too.
That is all well and good, but it
seemed somewhat startling to an
almost exclusively American au
dience at their first ever San

Francisco concert. Questions like
"Why does Alex Bertrami play
his bass without using his
thumb?" or "What are those
weird percussion instruments
they use, where are the bongos
and congos?" or even "Why can't
these guys speak English?" were
probably whizzing through the
heads of those in the crowd dur
ing the group's first of two 45-
minute sets.
Another part of the game plan
Azvmuth is going to have to
practice is soloing. Because there
are only three of them, each per
son has plenty of opportunities to
"strut his stuff." But by the sec
ond set, all three had run dry on
ideas for solos and consequently
their turns in the spotlight were
dull. Because Azymuth's songs
are usually of the slower variety,
slow solos can become boring
very quickly.
The trio's most popular tunes
come from their most recent LP,
Telecommunications — especial
ly those songs that possess defi
nite melodies and do not rely
heavily on solos. Both sets began
with slower numbers and ended
with some of AyZmuth's more in
tense pieces.
If nothing else, the GAMH
show was a cultural experience.
After each song, the three Brazil
ians clapped with the audience.
Since the songs were generally
long (10 minutes plus) and there
was no percussionist, drummer
Conti had to work double time to
keep up and therefore was ex
hausted after each tune. When a
song ended, he would get up and
raise his clasped hands into the
air.
At the conclusion of each set,
the trio gathered at the front of
the stage and hugged one anoth
er, demonstrating much more af
fection towards each other than
in most ail-American bands.
The songs themselves might
have besn ragged at the edges,
and the solos a bit long and labo
rious, but Azymuth's charm and
enthusiasm made up for these de
ficiencies.
