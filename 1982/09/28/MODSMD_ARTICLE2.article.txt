# Union tables motion for membership vote
## 
### DAVID AZRIN Senior Staff Writer 
In a fiery meeting of 400 striking
union workers yesterday, a motion that
would have required the union nego
tiating team to get union membership
approval before they accept any new
University proposals that are lower
than the union current demands was
tabled on a voice vote.
"A lot of us feel that they (the union
negotiating team members) have come
down too fast and that they've come too
close to the University's last proposal,"
said Chris Young, sponsor of the tabled
motion and a Wilbur food-service
worker, after the meeting at Mitchell
Park Community Center.
"It (the motion) was basically a
method of regaining control," Young
said.
Young denied that the tabling of the
motion signals a weakening in the
union's bargaining stance.
"There's a large ground swell to firm
up the demands. A lot of people just
didn't understand the tabling and
parlimentarv procedure. When the
voice count came up, they just stood
there," he said.
United Stanford Workers, Local 715
of Service Employees International

Union, AFL-CIO, and the University
are scheduled to meet with a federal me
diator tomorrow in an effort to end the
19-dav-old strike. Whatever the out
come of the meeting, and indeed, any
negotiations, the union membership as
a whole will vote on any new contract
after the negotiating teams reach a set
tlement.
Michael Baratz, executive secretary
of USW and head of the union nego
tiating team, urged workers to table the
motion before he called the voice vote.
Baratz told the membership at the
closed door meeting that the motion
would be "too restrictive" for the union
negotiating team when they sit down at
the bargaining table tomorrow morn
ing.
"In a way it was a vote of confidence
for me and the people who are nego
tiating. It does not mean we are not as
determined," Baratz said.
The meeting yesterday was filled with
other lively debates between angry
union workers. Workers discussed the
fact that some workers are not partici
pating in the strike and the importance
of gaining public support.
"We've got to try to talk to people.
We've got to try to win people over,"
