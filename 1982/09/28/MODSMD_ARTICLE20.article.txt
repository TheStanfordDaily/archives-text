"It is a fact that the union likes to pre
vail and organize more people," said
Priscilla Wheeler, head of the Univer

with the Daily. "To the extent that they
could use a settlement to say to the hos

only makes us wonder whether the real
issue is a fair and realistic settlement for
current workers or a settlemenet which
can be used as an organizing stategy for
