# New independent houses well-received
## 
### KRISTEN CHRISTOPHER Senior staff writer 
To the students who moved in to the new dorm complex
Sunday, the red pennants that used to mark the construction
site seemed like welcoming flags.
"So far, it's one of the nicest houses on campus I've seen,"
said sophomore Karl Johnsen, admiring the view of Lake
Lagunita out his window.
Indeed, the three houses that opened on time were not
only ready for the crew of about 165 relieved and en
thusiastic occupants, they also had brand new names.

Houses li and 111 are now officially named Treat, Murray
and Yost Houses respectively, in honor of people who made
significant contributions to the University in the early part
of the centurv.
Jan Van Houten, director of "Governor's Corner," as the
dorm complex will now be called, said, "things went in
credibly well," on check-in day and that she was particularly
pleased that students were greeted at the door by their resi
dent fellows.
Two resident fellows praised the work that was done to get
the dorms readv: Professor John Kaplan of Yost House said
it was a "heroic job", while Murray House's Harumi Befu

complimented his staff for working " 100 percent overtime."
Residents will have to cope with bare windows, empty
lounges and rented dining room furniture for a few weeks,
but they say the attractiveness of the houses makes those
things easv to overlook.
Junior Anne Semans' reaction upon seeing her new quar
ters was typical: she shouted to friends in Yost House, "Can
you handle these things, they're so nice."
Curtains and dining room and lounge furniture will be
placed in the houses as soon as they arrive, according to Ter
rence McGovern, the University's housing facility manager.
"No matter how much lead time you have, and we had six to
seven months lead time, things happen even under the best of
circumstances," he said.
One factors said their delivery is late because of a case of
the flu, McGoveru said, chuckling. Meanwhile, the firm that
is preparing the dining room furniture had a fire but will
temporarily provide tables and chairs for Treat and Yost
Houses, and chairs for Murray House, which already re
ceived its tables. The metal and black-leather furnishings
now in the dining rooms look out of place in the bright, airy,
wood-trimmed interiors, but will soon be replaced by the

furniture originally ordered for the
space.
Tik floors, wooden staircases and
large windows give the houses a country
feeling, but the many modernistic fea
tures are not easily missed. The light
wood furniture in the bedrooms is remi
niscient of Lego toys — it can be ar
ranged in a variety of ways, and lofts
can be constructed in less than half an
hour by placing ready-made screws
through existing holes in the bedframe
and wardrobe.
Each house has a paging system
which allows important announce
ments to be made quickly and efficient
ly; each bedroom is equipped with
hook-ups for a computer terminal.
However, the actual cables for com
puters and the terminals, themselves,
will not be installed for another year or
two. Van Houten said, because the Uni
versity has not yet finalized its plan
Another strickingly modern feature
of the new houses is the lighting in the
dining rooms. When the light switch is
turned on, the bulbs provide normal il
lumination but glow bright pink — the
only bold color in the houses.
The stark white walls and empty bul
letin boards will undoubtedly soon be

filled. Residents of Treat have already
begun decorating with posters from
Hast Asian countries.
Presently, the atmosphere in Treat is
different from the ones found in Mur
ray and Yost, since many of the stu
dents and staff there have been working
together since last spring, and some of
them lived together in Storey House
during spring quarter. The theme at
Treat on Sunday was 'Samurai on the
roof and each incoming student was
greeted by a loud gong sounded by Jun
ior Phil Yang, standing on one of the
house's many balconies.
The students seemed only mildly con
cerned about living next door to a con
struction site. Sophmore Todd Oha
nian, who lived in Storey House last
spring while working on the EAST
House committee, said he does not ex
pect the construction noise to be as an
noying as the sounds that came from
work on the new music building.
Van Houten said she expects the rest
of Governor's Corner — the new name
for the complex — to be completed on
time and under the predicted budget.
The name 'Governor's Corner' was
chosen because the complex is built in
the middle of a eucalyptus grove
planted by Governor Leland Stanford's
family.

INDEPENDENT HOUSES OPEN: Lugging suit
cases and carrying boxes, students pick their way across
what is soon to be a lawn near Governor's Grove, the new

Kevin Casey/Daily
dorm complex. Despite the lack of completed ac
comodations, students said they were happy with their
new living quarters.
furniture originally ordered for the
space.
Tik floors, wooden staircases and
large windows give the houses a country
feeling, but the many modernistic fea
tures are not easily missed. The light
wood furniture in the bedrooms is remi
niscient of Lego toys — it can be ar
ranged in a variety of ways, and lofts
can be constructed in less than half an
hour by placing ready-made screws
through existing holes in the bedframe
and wardrobe.
Each house has a paging system
which allows important announce
ments to be made quickly and efficient
ly; each bedroom is equipped with
hook-ups for a computer terminal.
However, the actual cables for com
puters and the terminals, themselves,
will not be installed for another year or
two. Van Houten said, because the Uni
versity has not yet finalized its plan
Another strickingly modern feature
of the new houses is the lighting in the
dining rooms. When the light switch is
turned on, the bulbs provide normal il
lumination but glow bright pink — the
only bold color in the houses.
The stark white walls and empty bul
letin boards will undoubtedly soon be

filled. Residents of Treat have already
begun decorating with posters from
Hast Asian countries.
Presently, the atmosphere in Treat is
different from the ones found in Mur
ray and Yost, since many of the stu
dents and staff there have been working
together since last spring, and some of
them lived together in Storey House
during spring quarter. The theme at
Treat on Sunday was 'Samurai on the
roof and each incoming student was
greeted by a loud gong sounded by Jun
ior Phil Yang, standing on one of the
house's many balconies.
The students seemed only mildly con
cerned about living next door to a con
struction site. Sophmore Todd Oha
nian, who lived in Storey House last
spring while working on the EAST
House committee, said he does not ex
pect the construction noise to be as an
noying as the sounds that came from
work on the new music building.
Van Houten said she expects the rest
of Governor's Corner — the new name
for the complex — to be completed on
time and under the predicted budget.
The name 'Governor's Corner' was
chosen because the complex is built in
the middle of a eucalyptus grove
planted by Governor Leland Stanford's
family.
