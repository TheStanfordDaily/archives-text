# New independent houses well-received

### KRISTEN CHRISTOPHER Senior staff writer 
To the students who moved in to the new dorm complex
Sunday, the red pennants that used to mark the construction
site seemed like welcoming flags.
"So far, it's one of the nicest houses on campus I've seen,"
said sophomore Karl Johnsen, admiring the view of Lake
Lagunita out his window.
Indeed, the three houses that opened on time were not
only ready for the crew of about 165 relieved and en
thusiastic occupants, they also had brand new names.

Houses li and 111 are now officially named Treat, Murray
and Yost Houses respectively, in honor of people who made
significant contributions to the University in the early part
of the centurv.
Jan Van Houten, director of "Governor's Corner," as the
dorm complex will now be called, said, "things went in
credibly well," on check-in day and that she was particularly
pleased that students were greeted at the door by their resi
dent fellows.
Two resident fellows praised the work that was done to get
the dorms readv: Professor John Kaplan of Yost House said
it was a "heroic job", while Murray House's Harumi Befu

complimented his staff for working " 100 percent overtime."
Residents will have to cope with bare windows, empty
lounges and rented dining room furniture for a few weeks,
but they say the attractiveness of the houses makes those
things easv to overlook.
Junior Anne Semans' reaction upon seeing her new quar
ters was typical: she shouted to friends in Yost House, "Can
you handle these things, they're so nice."
Curtains and dining room and lounge furniture will be
placed in the houses as soon as they arrive, according to Ter
rence McGovern, the University's housing facility manager.
"No matter how much lead time you have, and we had six to
seven months lead time, things happen even under the best of
circumstances," he said.
One factors said their delivery is late because of a case of
the flu, McGoveru said, chuckling. Meanwhile, the firm that
is preparing the dining room furniture had a fire but will
temporarily provide tables and chairs for Treat and Yost
Houses, and chairs for Murray House, which already re
ceived its tables. The metal and black-leather furnishings
now in the dining rooms look out of place in the bright, airy,
wood-trimmed interiors, but will soon be replaced by the

cases and carrying boxes, students pick their way across
what is soon to be a lawn near Governor's Grove, the new

dorm complex. Despite the lack of completed ac
comodations, students said they were happy with their
new living quarters.
