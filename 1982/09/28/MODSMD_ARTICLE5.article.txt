Peace force deployment begins in Beirut
Beirut — French and Italian paratroopers of the multinational peace
keeping force began to deploy yesterday inside the Palestinian refugee camps
on the southern outskirts of West Beirut despite the continued token pres
ence of Israeli troops at the port and airport that has kept U.S. Marines from
landing so far.
Palestinian residents, some with tears in their eyes, gave the peace-keeping
forces a warm welcome as the first patrols spread out in the dirty, twisting
streets of Sabra and Shatila camps where Lebanese civil defense workers
were still hunting for bodies from the massacre there 10 days ago.
Meanwhile, newspapers here reported that the Lebanese government is
considering a plan to reduce the number of Palestinian refugees in the coun
try by making arrangements for them to move to other countries, and even
tually closing all the refugee camps.
The 3000-man peace-keeping force, made up of U.S., French and Italian
paratroopers and Marines, has been sent back here, after departing abruptly
in mid-September, to help the Lebanese Army maintain order and protect
the camps from any further attack by rightist Christian militiamen.
The last units of the French and Italian contingents arrived yesterday,
bringing the total presence in West Beirut to about 2200, with 800 U.S.
Marines scheduled to join them today or tomorrow.
(Secretary of State George Shultz, at the United Nations, told Secretary
General Javier Perez de Cuellar that the United States favors extending the
mandate of the U.N. force in southern Lebanon, which expires Oct. 19. for
two months. A senior U.S. official told reporters last week that the United
States believes the force could be the best instrument for overseeing a de
militarized buffer zone to prevent attacks against northern Israel after an
Israeli withdrawal.
