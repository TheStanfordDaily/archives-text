Peace force deployment begins in Beirut
Beirut — French and Italian paratroopers of the multinational peace
keeping force began to deploy yesterday inside the Palestinian refugee camps
on the southern outskirts of West Beirut despite the continued token pres
ence of Israeli troops at the port and airport that has kept U.S. Marines from
landing so far.
Palestinian residents, some with tears in their eyes, gave the peace-keeping
forces a warm welcome as the first patrols spread out in the dirty, twisting
streets of Sabra and Shatila camps where Lebanese civil defense workers
were still hunting for bodies from the massacre there 10 days ago.
Meanwhile, newspapers here reported that the Lebanese government is
considering a plan to reduce the number of Palestinian refugees in the coun
try by making arrangements for them to move to other countries, and even
tually closing all the refugee camps.
The 3000-man peace-keeping force, made up of U.S., French and Italian
paratroopers and Marines, has been sent back here, after departing abruptly
in mid-September, to help the Lebanese Army maintain order and protect
the camps from any further attack by rightist Christian militiamen.
The last units of the French and Italian contingents arrived yesterday,
bringing the total presence in West Beirut to about 2200, with 800 U.S.
Marines scheduled to join them today or tomorrow.
(Secretary of State George Shultz, at the United Nations, told Secretary
General Javier Perez de Cuellar that the United States favors extending the
mandate of the U.N. force in southern Lebanon, which expires Oct. 19. for
two months. A senior U.S. official told reporters last week that the United
States believes the force could be the best instrument for overseeing a de
militarized buffer zone to prevent attacks against northern Israel after an
Israeli withdrawal.
Western diplomatic sources here said the United
States was still holding talks with Israel over its de
mand for continuing access to the Beirut airport,
where U.S. Marines are expected to set up their
headquarters.
The two sides appeared headed for a com
promise that would allow Israeli civilian, but not
military, aircraft to land at the airport, and an Is
raeli air controller to be in the airport tower.
Israeli militarv spokesmen said Sunday the
Army would officially complete its withdrawal
from the western sector by tomorrow and from "all
of Beirut," including the Christian eastern sector,
bv the end of the week.
Italy's Ambassador Franco Ottieri said the
French and Italians had decided to go ahead with
deploving their forces at the urging of newly
elected President Amin Gemayel who was eager
for a demonstration of the peace-keeping force's
presence in the camps.
Fiscal 1983 brings cutbacks
Washington — The nation's 22 million food
stamp recipients will get an average 8.5 percent
benefit increase — their first in two years — on Fri
day as the government begins a new fiscal year.
But the start of fiscal 1983 will also usher in cut
backs and economv measures in other welfare pro
grams and Medicare, the health insurance pro
gram for 28 million elderly and disabled Ameri
cans.
Many adults seeking Aid to Families with De
pendent Children will be required to look for work
first.
Medicare will no longer pay for private rooms in
hospitals or skilled nursing facilities, unless the pa
tient's condition requires seclusion. The health in
surance program will only pay for semi-private
rooms, saving $54 million.
Food stamp benefits have not risen since 1980.
The boost Friday will raise the average monthly
benefits for a family of four by $20 from $233 to
$253.
Congress skipped last year's normal annual ad
justment in the so-called "thrifty food plan" for
food stamp recipients as part of President Rea

gan's first round of budget cuts.
Networks involved in NFL talks
New York — Before Sunday's NFL strike settle
ment talks resumed at Hofstra University, Upshaw
and NFL Commissioner Pete Rozelle, who has
stayed awav from the negotiating sessions, gave
generally bleak outlooks in television interviews.
Upshaw said on CBS' "Face The Nation" that
ihe strike "may go on a lot longer than anticipated
because the networks are involved."
The three networks have said they will pay the
NFL about $30 million for this weekend's games
and another $30 million for next weekend's, the
inonev to be refunded next year only if the games
are eventually canceled.
Upshaw also said the union, which has threat
ened legal action because of what he termed the
networks' "funding of the strike," would testify
next Thursday before Rep. Peter Rodino (D-N.J.),
chairman of the House Judiciary Committee.
Schmidt opposition set back
Bonn, West Germany — Plans to topple Chan
cellor Helmut Schmidt's minority government
were thrown into doubt yesterday as a result of
Sunday's stunning upset in the Hesse state election.
West Germany appeared to be heading into a
time of political and economic uncertainty, ob
servers said.
The biggest selloff in 20 years hit the West Ger
man stock market yesterday and the deutschemark
slid to a 13-month low.
Still, for the moment at least, leaders of the anti-
Schmidt drive insisted that the election in Hesse
will not affect their efforts to bring down Schmidt's
Social Democratic government.
The heads of the conservative Christian Demo
cratic Union, its Bavarian ally, the Christian Social
Union, and the Free Democratic Party said they
will go ahead with plans to try to remove Schmidt
by means of a no-confidence vote Friday in Par
liament, then seek to replace him with the Chris
tian Democrats' Helmut Kohl as head of a new
coalition government.

Near panic greets Thatcher visit
Hong Kong — British Prime Minister Margaret
Thatcher came here to calm concerns about Chi
na's claims to this town of fast-shifting fortunes,
and she was about as reassuring as a weatherman
in the middle of a storm. She reported the in
clemency, promised umbrellas, but failed to fore
cast sunny skies.
So, just as Thatcher, in a televised address yes
terday, was assuring this British colony of her
"moral responsibility" for its well-being, a wealthy
wholesale jeweler suddenly decided on a stronger
hedge against the future: he dispatched an assistant
to the Australian mission for an application to emi
grate.
As a result, uncertainty burst into fear, which
hits this gold-plated city where it hurts the hardest
— the financial solar plexus.
Before her 2 p.m. speech, the stock market al
ready had tumbled 67 points, reflecting the un
resolved nature of her visit last week to Peking. An
hour later, it slipped another 17 points, closing
about 8 percent lower for the day, which is one of
the worst falls in recent years.
Hong Kong land values did even worse, drop
ping 10 percent for the day, while local currency
came within I cent of suffering its lowest exchange
rate ever.
Merger provides mixed trading
New York — A late rally in blue-chip issues
helped turn a stock-market slide into a narrowly
mixed performance yesterday in the lightest trad
ing in six weeks.
The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials, which
fell 15.27 points from its 13-month high over the
three previous sessions, reversed course late in the
dav to post a gain of 1.38 points and finish at
920.90.
Today's weather
Sunny and breezy. Highs in the 60s to mid 70s.
Winds northwest 15 to 25 mph mainly in the after
noon. Tonight and tomorrow fair. Lows in the 50s.

Western diplomatic sources here said the United
States was still holding talks with Israel over its de
mand for continuing access to the Beirut airport,
where U.S. Marines are expected to set up their
headquarters.
The two sides appeared headed for a com
promise that would allow Israeli civilian, but not
military, aircraft to land at the airport, and an Is
raeli air controller to be in the airport tower.
Israeli militarv spokesmen said Sunday the
Army would officially complete its withdrawal
from the western sector by tomorrow and from "all
of Beirut," including the Christian eastern sector,
bv the end of the week.
Italy's Ambassador Franco Ottieri said the
French and Italians had decided to go ahead with
deploving their forces at the urging of newly
elected President Amin Gemayel who was eager
for a demonstration of the peace-keeping force's
presence in the camps.
Fiscal 1983 brings cutbacks
Washington — The nation's 22 million food
stamp recipients will get an average 8.5 percent
benefit increase — their first in two years — on Fri
day as the government begins a new fiscal year.
But the start of fiscal 1983 will also usher in cut
backs and economv measures in other welfare pro
grams and Medicare, the health insurance pro
gram for 28 million elderly and disabled Ameri
cans.
Many adults seeking Aid to Families with De
pendent Children will be required to look for work
first.
Medicare will no longer pay for private rooms in
hospitals or skilled nursing facilities, unless the pa
tient's condition requires seclusion. The health in
surance program will only pay for semi-private
rooms, saving $54 million.
Food stamp benefits have not risen since 1980.
The boost Friday will raise the average monthly
benefits for a family of four by $20 from $233 to
$253.
Congress skipped last year's normal annual ad
justment in the so-called "thrifty food plan" for
food stamp recipients as part of President Rea

gan's first round of budget cuts.
Networks involved in NFL talks
New York — Before Sunday's NFL strike settle
ment talks resumed at Hofstra University, Upshaw
and NFL Commissioner Pete Rozelle, who has
stayed awav from the negotiating sessions, gave
generally bleak outlooks in television interviews.
Upshaw said on CBS' "Face The Nation" that
ihe strike "may go on a lot longer than anticipated
because the networks are involved."
The three networks have said they will pay the
NFL about $30 million for this weekend's games
and another $30 million for next weekend's, the
inonev to be refunded next year only if the games
are eventually canceled.
Upshaw also said the union, which has threat
ened legal action because of what he termed the
networks' "funding of the strike," would testify
next Thursday before Rep. Peter Rodino (D-N.J.),
chairman of the House Judiciary Committee.
Schmidt opposition set back
Bonn, West Germany — Plans to topple Chan
cellor Helmut Schmidt's minority government
were thrown into doubt yesterday as a result of
Sunday's stunning upset in the Hesse state election.
West Germany appeared to be heading into a
time of political and economic uncertainty, ob
servers said.
The biggest selloff in 20 years hit the West Ger
man stock market yesterday and the deutschemark
slid to a 13-month low.
Still, for the moment at least, leaders of the anti-
Schmidt drive insisted that the election in Hesse
will not affect their efforts to bring down Schmidt's
Social Democratic government.
The heads of the conservative Christian Demo
cratic Union, its Bavarian ally, the Christian Social
Union, and the Free Democratic Party said they
will go ahead with plans to try to remove Schmidt
by means of a no-confidence vote Friday in Par
liament, then seek to replace him with the Chris
tian Democrats' Helmut Kohl as head of a new
coalition government.

Near panic greets Thatcher visit
Hong Kong — British Prime Minister Margaret
Thatcher came here to calm concerns about Chi
na's claims to this town of fast-shifting fortunes,
and she was about as reassuring as a weatherman
in the middle of a storm. She reported the in
clemency, promised umbrellas, but failed to fore
cast sunny skies.
So, just as Thatcher, in a televised address yes
terday, was assuring this British colony of her
"moral responsibility" for its well-being, a wealthy
wholesale jeweler suddenly decided on a stronger
hedge against the future: he dispatched an assistant
to the Australian mission for an application to emi
grate.
As a result, uncertainty burst into fear, which
hits this gold-plated city where it hurts the hardest
— the financial solar plexus.
Before her 2 p.m. speech, the stock market al
ready had tumbled 67 points, reflecting the un
resolved nature of her visit last week to Peking. An
hour later, it slipped another 17 points, closing
about 8 percent lower for the day, which is one of
the worst falls in recent years.
Hong Kong land values did even worse, drop
ping 10 percent for the day, while local currency
came within I cent of suffering its lowest exchange
rate ever.
Merger provides mixed trading
New York — A late rally in blue-chip issues
helped turn a stock-market slide into a narrowly

The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials, which

three previous sessions, reversed course late in the
dav to post a gain of 1.38 points and finish at
920.90.

Peace force deployment begins in Beirut
Beirut — French and Italian paratroopers of the multinational peace
keeping force began to deploy yesterday inside the Palestinian refugee camps
on the southern outskirts of West Beirut despite the continued token pres
ence of Israeli troops at the port and airport that has kept U.S. Marines from
landing so far.
Palestinian residents, some with tears in their eyes, gave the peace-keeping
forces a warm welcome as the first patrols spread out in the dirty, twisting
streets of Sabra and Shatila camps where Lebanese civil defense workers
were still hunting for bodies from the massacre there 10 days ago.
Meanwhile, newspapers here reported that the Lebanese government is
considering a plan to reduce the number of Palestinian refugees in the coun
try by making arrangements for them to move to other countries, and even
tually closing all the refugee camps.
The 3000-man peace-keeping force, made up of U.S., French and Italian
paratroopers and Marines, has been sent back here, after departing abruptly
in mid-September, to help the Lebanese Army maintain order and protect
the camps from any further attack by rightist Christian militiamen.
The last units of the French and Italian contingents arrived yesterday,
bringing the total presence in West Beirut to about 2200, with 800 U.S.
Marines scheduled to join them today or tomorrow.
(Secretary of State George Shultz, at the United Nations, told Secretary
General Javier Perez de Cuellar that the United States favors extending the
mandate of the U.N. force in southern Lebanon, which expires Oct. 19. for
two months. A senior U.S. official told reporters last week that the United
States believes the force could be the best instrument for overseeing a de
militarized buffer zone to prevent attacks against northern Israel after an
Israeli withdrawal.
