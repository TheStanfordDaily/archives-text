# But lawsuit may block Loggins show
## Promoters gear up for upcoming concerts 
### KAREN SPRINGEN 
The Grateful Dead and Kenny Log
gins are set to perform in the first on
campus rock concerts since ASSU Spe
cial Events disbanded two years ago.

The concerts will be held in the 9500-
person capacity Frost Amphitheater,
with the Grateful Dead performing on
Oct. 9 and 10 and Kenny Loggins set for
Oct. 24.
The 16,500 Grateful Dead tickets
available on Sept. 12 sold out from Bass
outlets in nine hours, according to Vin
nv Freda, business manager of the
Chaparral, the campus group that is co
promoting the concert with Bill
Graham Presents. Meanwhile, more
than 2000 Kennv Loggins tickets have
been sold to date.
A block of 1000 tickets for each con
cert is being held for students until
tomorrow at 10 a.m. One ticket may be
purchased per student at Tresidder. ID
cards will be punched.
Police will patrol the box office area
tonight. Students may stand in line, but
will not be allowed to lie down or have
sleeping bags before 6 a m. tomorrow

"We're not dealing with normal, ra
tional people here. We're dealing with
dead heads," said a box office employ
ee.
The Chaparral based the decision to
reserve onlv 2000 tickets on past
statistics indicating that a concert au
dience rarelv consists of more than 20 to
25 percent students, said Freda. The re
maining 500 tickets are complimentary
tickets.
The concerts will be the first here
since the Jefferson Starship appeared in
1980. During that vear, declining atten
dance and the rising cost of producing
concerts caused ASSU Special Events
to lose about $125,000.
The Graham organization is the lead
ing rock promoter in the Bay Area and
will co-promote the Grateful Dead con
cert with the Chaparral and the Loggins
concert with the Delta Upsilon (DU)
fraternity.
As on-campus promoters have found
in the past, however, unexpected prob
lems often thwart even the best laid pro
grams. Nederlander Productions, a
competitor of Bill Graham Presents,

which is presenting Loggins in Concord
Oct. 9 and 10, is trving to get a court in
junction to stop that concert here. A
ruling is expected today in Marin Coun
ty-
According to Nederlander Produc
tions, its contract stipulates that Log
gins is not permitted to play within 100
miles of Concord in the month of Octo
ber. The Frost show, claims
Nederlander, is hurting Concord ticket
sales. But Danny Scher, vice-president
of Bill Graham Presents, said "it's a
clear case" that the show should go on.
Bill Graham Presents presented
sworn declarations to the judge that
Loggins had a deal to play at Stanford
and that Concord Pavilion was aware
of that deal, said Scher. The two con
tracts were made simultaneously, he
said.
According to Walters, Bill Graham
Presents is paving the Chaparral a flat
fee of $20,000. The Chaparral is respon
sible for producing and advertising the
concert, paving for security and box of
fice privileges from the $20,000 fee. The
Chaparral will receive no percentage of

the profits, except for 20 percent from
concessions.
Walters said the humor magazine
plans to pav off some of its longstand
ing debts with any profits it makes from
the concert.
Freda said the profit "won't be more
than S 10,000 . . . Most of our money is
being eaten up by the box office."
The Tresidder ticket office is one of
the most expensive in the Bay Area, said
Kreda. But because they have a
monopoly as the main office, the
Chaparral must work through them.
The ticket office charge, which Freda
estimated at about $4000 for this con
cert, comes out of the $20,000 flat fee.

The DU fraternity signed its contract
for Loggins only after the Student
Alumni Network (STAN) rejected a si
miliar contract. Doug Hansen, DU fi
nancial manager, said the fraternity
chose the Loggins concert when STAN
"seemed to not be coming through."
He explained that the groundwork had
been laid by STAN and that the
fraternity took over late in the nego
tiating process.
According to Margot Nelson, direc
tor of STAN, the alumni-assomtion
based group's concert contract did not
guarantee sufficient profit. STAN
member Dave Stuckv said the contract
did not include a "worst case" clause in
the event the concert failed to take
place.
Hansen said STAN, unlike the DUs,
did not have enough manpower to low
er the cost of putting on the concert.
Hansen said profits "depend on how
much work we get done with people in
the house."
The Committee on Contemporary
Entertainment (COCE), created to help
student organizations co-produce con
certs with professional promoting com
panies in order to avoid financial prob
lems, appointed Vicky Holt, director of
events and services, to negotiate all con
cert contracts with Scher.
Holt declined to reveal the concert
fees that she and Scher agreed upon.
"In this particular business it's not wise
(to reveal financial terms)," she said.
"It's a very flexible business .. . each
time can be completely different."

According to Ben Wilson, one of four
DUs in charge of the Loggins concert,
the DUs settled for a $10,000 flat fee.
Bill Graham Presents agreed to deposit
$5000 of this fee in the DU account by
Oct. I. $1500 of this is considered a
"non-refundable facilities fee," Wilson
said.
Holt said STAN rejected its contract
because of limiting financial and or
ganizational provisions. "It's not really
as much what was in the contract. It's
what the organizations wanted to get
out of the concert. Each student or
ganization has different goals," she
said.
Holt said Bill Graham's financial ar
rangements with STAN and the DU's
were similar but that "STAN wanted
more."

The Chaparral and the Band are

network to the COCE this week, ac

consist of the Band, the Chaparral,
STAN and the ASSU.
Membership on the part of these in

the house."
The Committee on Contemporary
Entertainment (COCE), created to help
student organizations co-produce con
certs with professional promoting com
panies in order to avoid financial prob
lems, appointed Vicky Holt, director of
events and services, to negotiate all con
cert contracts with Scher.
Holt declined to reveal the concert
fees that she and Scher agreed upon.
"In this particular business it's not wise
(to reveal financial terms)," she said.
"It's a very flexible business .. . each
time can be completely different."

According to Ben Wilson, one of four
DUs in charge of the Loggins concert,
the DUs settled for a $10,000 flat fee.
Bill Graham Presents agreed to deposit
$5000 of this fee in the DU account by
Oct. I. $1500 of this is considered a
"non-refundable facilities fee," Wilson
said.
Holt said STAN rejected its contract
because of limiting financial and or
ganizational provisions. "It's not really
as much what was in the contract. It's
what the organizations wanted to get
out of the concert. Each student or
ganization has different goals," she
said.
Holt said Bill Graham's financial ar
rangements with STAN and the DU's
were similar but that "STAN wanted
more."

The Chaparral and the Band are
proposing a four-group concert
network to the COCE this week, ac
cording to Freda. The network would
consist of the Band, the Chaparral,
STAN and the ASSU.
Membership on the part of these in
itial four members requires a $750 in
vestment. To date, only the Chaparral
and the Band have made the invest
ment. The idea of the network is ex
pected to be proposed to the ASSU to
night, and it must be approved by
STAN members as well.
The Grateful Dead and Kenny Log
gins are set to perform in the first on
campus rock concerts since ASSU Spe
cial Events disbanded two years ago.

The concerts will be held in the 9500-
person capacity Frost Amphitheater,
with the Grateful Dead performing on
Oct. 9 and 10 and Kenny Loggins set for
Oct. 24.
The 16,500 Grateful Dead tickets
available on Sept. 12 sold out from Bass
outlets in nine hours, according to Vin
nv Freda, business manager of the
Chaparral, the campus group that is co
promoting the concert with Bill
Graham Presents. Meanwhile, more
than 2000 Kennv Loggins tickets have
been sold to date.
A block of 1000 tickets for each con
cert is being held for students until
tomorrow at 10 a.m. One ticket may be
purchased per student at Tresidder. ID
cards will be punched.
Police will patrol the box office area
tonight. Students may stand in line, but
will not be allowed to lie down or have
sleeping bags before 6 a m. tomorrow

"We're not dealing with normal, ra
tional people here. We're dealing with
dead heads," said a box office employ
ee.
The Chaparral based the decision to
reserve onlv 2000 tickets on past
statistics indicating that a concert au
dience rarelv consists of more than 20 to
25 percent students, said Freda. The re
maining 500 tickets are complimentary
tickets.
The concerts will be the first here
since the Jefferson Starship appeared in
1980. During that vear, declining atten
dance and the rising cost of producing
concerts caused ASSU Special Events
to lose about $125,000.
The Graham organization is the lead
ing rock promoter in the Bay Area and
will co-promote the Grateful Dead con
cert with the Chaparral and the Loggins
concert with the Delta Upsilon (DU)
fraternity.
As on-campus promoters have found
in the past, however, unexpected prob
lems often thwart even the best laid pro
grams. Nederlander Productions, a
competitor of Bill Graham Presents,

which is presenting Loggins in Concord
Oct. 9 and 10, is trving to get a court in
junction to stop that concert here. A
ruling is expected today in Marin Coun
ty-
According to Nederlander Produc
tions, its contract stipulates that Log
gins is not permitted to play within 100
miles of Concord in the month of Octo
ber. The Frost show, claims
Nederlander, is hurting Concord ticket
sales. But Danny Scher, vice-president
of Bill Graham Presents, said "it's a
clear case" that the show should go on.
Bill Graham Presents presented
sworn declarations to the judge that
Loggins had a deal to play at Stanford
and that Concord Pavilion was aware
of that deal, said Scher. The two con
tracts were made simultaneously, he
said.
According to Walters, Bill Graham
Presents is paving the Chaparral a flat
fee of $20,000. The Chaparral is respon
sible for producing and advertising the
concert, paving for security and box of
fice privileges from the $20,000 fee. The
Chaparral will receive no percentage of

the profits, except for 20 percent from
concessions.
Walters said the humor magazine
plans to pav off some of its longstand
ing debts with any profits it makes from
the concert.
Freda said the profit "won't be more
than S 10,000 . . . Most of our money is
being eaten up by the box office."
The Tresidder ticket office is one of
the most expensive in the Bay Area, said
Kreda. But because they have a
monopoly as the main office, the
Chaparral must work through them.
The ticket office charge, which Freda
estimated at about $4000 for this con
cert, comes out of the $20,000 flat fee.

The DU fraternity signed its contract
for Loggins only after the Student
Alumni Network (STAN) rejected a si
miliar contract. Doug Hansen, DU fi
nancial manager, said the fraternity
chose the Loggins concert when STAN
"seemed to not be coming through."
He explained that the groundwork had
been laid by STAN and that the
fraternity took over late in the nego
tiating process.
According to Margot Nelson, direc
tor of STAN, the alumni-assomtion
based group's concert contract did not
guarantee sufficient profit. STAN
member Dave Stuckv said the contract
did not include a "worst case" clause in
the event the concert failed to take
place.
Hansen said STAN, unlike the DUs,
did not have enough manpower to low
er the cost of putting on the concert.
Hansen said profits "depend on how
much work we get done with people in
the house."
