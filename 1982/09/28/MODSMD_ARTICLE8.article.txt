# Prof. Berman recounts impressions of summer travels in Mideast
## 
### DAVID AZRIN Senior staff writer 
Condemning Israel's recent ac
tions in Lebanon, Lawrence
Berman, an associate professor
of religious studies here, told a
group of newly arrived freshmen
on Friday that it was "unneces
sary" for the security of Israel to
go into West Beirut.
"I believe that Israel is under
taking too much in the Mideast,
that they could have been more
modest in their goals."
Referring to the number of ci
vilian casualities that have oc
curred so far, Berman added,
"We've seen where megalomania
can lead."
The Israelis need to re-examine
their general strategy, Berman
said.
"I think Begin and the Arabs
are locked into a sort of ideology
that may have been developed in
response to previous situations
and there is a need to look at
things afresh."
Berman described the political
turmoil he witnessed during his
two-month stay in Israel this
summer.

7 would condemn
their (the Israelis)
going into West
Beirut. I think that it
was unnecessary for
the security of Israel.'

Much of the Israeli public
criticized the Israeli invasion of
Lebanon, Berman said.
'There was much questioning
of Israel's role in the incursion
into Lebanon and the fact that ci
vilians were affected," he said.
According to Berman, the
members of the Israeli cabinet
asked to justify their actions in
Lebanon.

"(Israeli Defense Minister
Ariel) Sharon was highly
criticized and grilled by reporters
onT.V. and asked to justify Is
rael's actions," he said. "But
(Prime Minister Menachem) Be
gin does have a very broad based
constituency, especially after the
departure of the Palestinian Lib
eration Organization from Leba
non."

'I believe Israel is
undertaking too much
in the Mideast, that
they could have been
more modest in their
goals. 9

The members of the Israeli
cabinet defended their stance,
Berman said.
"Sharon said that there were
civilians in the area and that the
killings were unavoidable. They
were arguing that the ends justi
fied the means and that they took
all precautions," he said.
"But where do you call a
stop?" he asked.
The massacre of Palestinian
refugees by Christian Phalangists
was responsible for the renewed
criticism, Berman said. The trag
edy, he said, caused the Israeli
public to question actions under
taken by their leaders.
"One doesn't want these inci
dents to happen, but they can be
used in a positive manner as a
tool for soul-searching. This inci
dent has caused people to really
think about this."
Fluent in both Hebrew and

Arabic, Berman was able to read
the daily Israeli and Arabic news
papers and listen to the Israeli tel
evision and radio reports.
Berman's study of the issues con
vinced him to personally con
demn Israel's actions in Leba
non.
One student asked Berman
about claims that the media pre
sented a distorted view of the in
cidents in Lebanon.
Berman replied that while he
was unable to read the reports in
the American press, "I was sur
prised to see how close to the AP
and UPI press releases the
Ha'eretz (an independent Israeli
newspaper) was. It was fairly ac
curate."
Berman emphasised that much
of the turmoil in the Mideast is
caused by a lack of separation of
church and state in Arab coun
tries.
"This distinction between

church and state does not exist in
Lebanon. It is not a part of the
social scheme of things."
In Israel, the separation of
church and state has been kept
fairly distinct, Berman said. But

7 think Begin and the
Arabs are locked into
a sort of ideology that
may have been
developed in response
to previous situations
and there is a need to
look at things afresh.'

he said some groups would like to
change this.
"Certain groups in Israel
would like to turn Israel into a
sort of Iran, without a separation
of church and state," Berman

said. "At the same time, there is a
very large group that is interested
in maintaining this separation
and in reining in the extremist
right."
Berman said a separation of
church and state is essential for
orderly government.
"The separation between
church and state allows people to
cooperate in a political realm
which is nuetral or quasi-neu
tral."
"But the religious quali
fication for political offices in
Lebanon tend to accentuate the
differences rather than trying to
create some common ground for
understanding so that the only
resort to settling their differences
is taking up arms."
Berman explained that the
only way a religious state can
"work" is if there is a
"homogeneous society."

"If you had one religious
group then you could set up a so
ciety where the basis was for re
ligion. But it could only work as
long as you had a homogeneous
society."
Berman commended former
Egyptian pffesident Anwar Sadat
for trying to rise above these re
ligious differences.

Berman explained that the
only way a religious state can
"work" is if there is a
"homogeneous society."

"If you had one religious
group then you could set up a so

long as you had a homogeneous
society."

Egyptian pffesident Anwar Sadat
for trying to rise above these re

MIDEAST SPEAKER: Prof. Lawrence Berman, back from a
recent trip to Israel, spoke to approximately 25 freshmen in the
Soto lounge in Wilbur last Friday on his impressions of the Mid-
Condemning Israel's recent ac
tions in Lebanon, Lawrence
Berman, an associate professor
of religious studies here, told a
group of newly arrived freshmen
on Friday that it was "unneces
sary" for the security of Israel to
go into West Beirut.
"I believe that Israel is under
taking too much in the Mideast,
that they could have been more
modest in their goals."
Referring to the number of ci
vilian casualities that have oc
curred so far, Berman added,
"We've seen where megalomania
can lead."
The Israelis need to re-examine
their general strategy, Berman
said.
"I think Begin and the Arabs
are locked into a sort of ideology
that may have been developed in
response to previous situations
and there is a need to look at
things afresh."
Berman described the political
turmoil he witnessed during his
two-month stay in Israel this
summer.

7 would condemn
their (the Israelis)
going into West
Beirut. I think that it
was unnecessary for
the security of Israel.'

Much of the Israeli public
criticized the Israeli invasion of
Lebanon, Berman said.
'There was much questioning
of Israel's role in the incursion
into Lebanon and the fact that ci
vilians were affected," he said.
According to Berman, the
members of the Israeli cabinet
asked to justify their actions in
Lebanon.

"(Israeli Defense Minister
Ariel) Sharon was highly
criticized and grilled by reporters
onT.V. and asked to justify Is
rael's actions," he said. "But
(Prime Minister Menachem) Be
gin does have a very broad based
constituency, especially after the
departure of the Palestinian Lib
eration Organization from Leba
non."

'I believe Israel is
undertaking too much
in the Mideast, that
they could have been
more modest in their
goals. 9

The members of the Israeli
cabinet defended their stance,
Berman said.
"Sharon said that there were
civilians in the area and that the
killings were unavoidable. They
were arguing that the ends justi
fied the means and that they took
all precautions," he said.
"But where do you call a
stop?" he asked.
The massacre of Palestinian
refugees by Christian Phalangists
was responsible for the renewed
criticism, Berman said. The trag
edy, he said, caused the Israeli
public to question actions under
taken by their leaders.
"One doesn't want these inci
dents to happen, but they can be
used in a positive manner as a
tool for soul-searching. This inci
dent has caused people to really
think about this."
Fluent in both Hebrew and

Arabic, Berman was able to read
the daily Israeli and Arabic news
papers and listen to the Israeli tel
evision and radio reports.
Berman's study of the issues con
vinced him to personally con
demn Israel's actions in Leba
non.
One student asked Berman
about claims that the media pre
sented a distorted view of the in
cidents in Lebanon.
Berman replied that while he
was unable to read the reports in
the American press, "I was sur
prised to see how close to the AP
and UPI press releases the
Ha'eretz (an independent Israeli
newspaper) was. It was fairly ac
curate."
Berman emphasised that much
of the turmoil in the Mideast is
caused by a lack of separation of
church and state in Arab coun
tries.
"This distinction between

church and state does not exist in
Lebanon. It is not a part of the
social scheme of things."
In Israel, the separation of
church and state has been kept
fairly distinct, Berman said. But

7 think Begin and the
Arabs are locked into
a sort of ideology that
may have been
developed in response
to previous situations
and there is a need to
look at things afresh.'

he said some groups would like to
change this.
"Certain groups in Israel
would like to turn Israel into a
sort of Iran, without a separation
of church and state," Berman

said. "At the same time, there is a
very large group that is interested
in maintaining this separation
and in reining in the extremist
right."
Berman said a separation of
church and state is essential for
orderly government.
"The separation between
church and state allows people to
cooperate in a political realm
which is nuetral or quasi-neu
tral."
"But the religious quali
fication for political offices in
Lebanon tend to accentuate the
differences rather than trying to
create some common ground for
understanding so that the only
resort to settling their differences
is taking up arms."
Berman explained that the
only way a religious state can
"work" is if there is a
"homogeneous society."

"If you had one religious
group then you could set up a so
ciety where the basis was for re
ligion. But it could only work as
long as you had a homogeneous
society."
