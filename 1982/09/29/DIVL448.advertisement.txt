VMjF Performing Arts
i is an interdisciplinary program supporting the presence of Black art forms on
campus. Starting as a student project in 1968, the Committee has developed
into an official university program with three major functions. It serves as 1) a
liaison with departments in hiring faculty and devising courses in Black
performing arts; 2) a producer of shows in dance, drama and music; and 3) a
resource for students' organizations promoting artisitic expression in the
Black community. In addition, the Committee hosts guest artists such as
Alvin Ailey Dance Theater and the African American Drama Company, as
well as sponsoring theatre parties to Bay Area performances. For
information on courses consult the Time Schedule under the following
departments African and Afro-American Studies, Drama, Music,
