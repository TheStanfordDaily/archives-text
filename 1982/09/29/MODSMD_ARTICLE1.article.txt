# Loggins show survives court challenge
## Concert Network plan emerges 
### KAREN SPRINGEN 
A newly-formed student group may eventually produce
concerts here and eliminate the need for University or
ganizations to co-promote with professionals such as Bill
Graham Presents (BGP).
The group the Concert Network will present its fin
ished charter to the University Committee on Contem
porary Entertainment (COCE) today, according to Vinnie
Freda, COCE intern and business manager of the Chaparral
The Network hopes to act as a co-promoter with other
student organizations in the future, Freda said.
The group is tentatively composed of the ASSU, the
Chaparral, the Leland Stanford Junior University Marching
Band (LSJUMB) and the Student Alumni Network
(STAN).
Other student groups are eligible to join but must be voted
in by the founding members. However, the Network will
work with non-member student groups, Freda said.
"It's one thing if (a group such as) SPA wants to co-pro
mote with us, it's another if they want to join us," Freda said.
To date, the Chaparral is the only group which has paid
the $750 investment required for membership. The Band has
Aet to transfer officially funds into the Network's ASSU ac
count. STAN needs official approval from its steering com
mittee Oct. 6 and the ASSU must get senate approval.

Freda said the network will begin as soon as it gets a no
risk (percentage-based), one-year contract.
"We know what we want, and what we want is a multi
concert contract," said Freda. He cited UC-Berkeley's suc
cessful summer concert series.
The network should give continuity, expertise and some
advance notice to the concerts here, Freda said.
"Right now it's as if Sunday Flicks just came out with the
movie a week in advance," said Freda. "We want to come
out with the whole poster in the beginning."
The network will have two accounts an operating
budget and a reserve account. In two or three years the re
serve account may be large enough to end the need for co
promoting concerts with professional promoters such as
BGP, said LSJUMB manager John Howard.
"It's hard to get a contract without a co-promoter because
they have the contacts we do not have at present," he said.
Cvnthia Mathewson, ASSU council of presidents mem
ber, called the Concert Network "the best way to bring con
certs back to campus." Mathewson announced the network
at the first ASSU Senate meeting last night. She said the
ASSU should vote on the proposal in two weeks.
Vicky Holt, director of events and
services, will continue to negotiate with
BGP on behalf of the University. Holt
said the Concert Network should work
"if they can pool together the financial
resources."
STAN member Barrett Cowan said
the network wants to work with several
promoters instead of "at the mercy of
Bill Graham."
"Perhaps the concert network is the
right way to go about it," he said.

A temporary restraining order which
would have prevented Kenny Loggins
from performing here on Sunday, Oct.
24 was denied yesterday by a Marin
County judge, allowing the concert to
take place as originally scheduled, ac
cording to Vicky Holt, the concert ne
gotiator appointed by the University
Committee on Contemporary Enter
tainment.
Nederlander Productions, a rival of
Bill Graham Presents, the agency co
promoting the concert with the Delta
Upsilon fraternity, claimed that the
Frost concert was hurting its ticket

sales. Nederlander Productions is pro
moting a Loggins concert Oct. 9 at the
Concord Pavilion.
According to a BGP spokesman, the
Marin County judge called
Nederlander's lawsuit estimated at
about $250,000 "a waste of tax
payers' money."
Danny Scher, vice-president of Bill
Graham Presents said the DUs would
not have lost money even if
Nederlander Productions had won its
case. "This was our battle. Why should
they lose because we're fighting a bat
tle?" he said.
