# Overseas scholarships open to 'real people'
## 
### MARK ZEIGLER 
Kris Kristofferson or Pat Haden you may
be not, but that doesn't rule out your chances
to win a Rhodes, Marshall or Fulbright
Scholarship for study abroad.
Both celebrities won prestigious awards in
their college days granting them at least two
years study at British universities. But as
Cathy Gamon of the Bechtel International
Center's Overseas Resource Center points
out, "real people win them, too."
Though each scholarship and fellowship
has its own qualifications, any college-aged
U.S. citizen with a bachelor's degree is
eligible for consideration.
An informational meeting will be held to
night for Rhodes/Marshall candidates and
Thursdav evening for Fulbright and related
awards. Both meetings will be at 7:30 p.m. at
the International Center.
Perhaps the most prestigious and highly
publicized of the accolades is the Rhodes
Scholarship, allowing the 32 U.S. winners at
least two years of all-expenses-paid study at
England's Oxford University. The Rhodes
Trustees also award a yearly "maintenance
allowance" of nearly $6OOO "to meet neces
sary expenses for term-time (quarter break)
and vacations" to the scholarship holders.
The Marshall Scholarship differs from the
Rhodes in that the two years of study may
lead to a degree at any British university, in
cluding Oxford. The Marshall requires its ap
plicants to have a 3.7 or higher grade point

average excluding their freshman year.
"With the Rhodes and the Marshall, aca
demic excellence comes first," Gamon noted,
" but review committees are looking for a lot
of other qualifications as well."
For the Rhodes, those "other quali
fications" include such things as "truthful
ness, courage, devotion to duty, sympathy for
and protection of the weak, kindness, un
selfishness and fellowship." according to a
section of Cecil Rhodes's will.
A broad academic background and a clear
statement of proposed study is looked highly
upon as well, Gamon said. Gamon sits on the
campus Rhodes/Marshall panel that reviews
Stanford applicants and has worked with the
various scholarships for the past four years.
Although only one or two Stanford stu
dents win either a Rhodes or Marshall, 15 to
20 receive Fulbright or the related grants in a
given year, Gamon said.
There are two basic types of Fulbright
awards one for a year of graduate study
and another for six to 12 months of doctoral
dissertation research abroad. The latter
grant, called the Fulbright-Hays Fellowship
is exclusively for those planning a teaching
career at the college level in the United States.
According to a brochure outlining the
Fulbright program, the purpose of the grants
is "to enable the government of the United
States to increase mutual understanding be
tween the people of the United States and the
people of other countries."

A total of 524 grants are available in the'
1983-84 competition, with the bulk of those
coming from the Federal Republic of Germa-;
nv (185). Each of the nearly 50 countries in-;
volved designates the number of grants it
wishes to award.
Fulbright and related scholarships are ad-f
ministered by the Institute of International .
Education (HE). The applicant proposes a!
self-designed course of study and in some'
cases presents a budget of expenses. After a
campus committee screens the candidates, '
the applications are fowarded to Washing
ton, where the HE makes the Final decision.
Gamon noted that with the Fulbright-type;
awards, "it is more of a matching process (be/
tween applicant and country)" than with the;
Rhodes or Marshall Scholarships.
To call the use of Fulbright grants diverse
would be a gross understatement. The 15-
Stanford Fulbright recipients are spending'
this year in such places as Togo, New Guinea*
and the Soviet Union studying subjects like
molecular biology, nutrition/demography"
and anthropology.
"These are really excellent
not only for academic development, but for
personal development," Gamon said. She
also stressed that it is never too late to apply;
although deadlines for the various scholar
ships are as soon as October 7.
Recent Rhodes Scholarship winner Mark
Kramer decided to apply "literally a week
before the deadline," Gamon said.
