## Massacre a part of Israeli policy 
### 
During the negotiations preceeding the departure of PLO
fighters from Beirut, the Palestinian leadership insisted upon
U.S. guarantees that the Israeli army would not enter the
western sector of the city. The PLO was explicit in stating
that Israel's right-wing allies would use the opportunity pro
vided by an Israeli presence in West Beirut to stage a
massacre there, and it received a commitment from Philip
Habib that Israeli forces would not enter that portion of the
citv. Indeed, the 30-day mandate of the multinational peace
keeping force was to protect the civilian population of Beirut
and to assist the Lebanese army in reestablishing its control
there.
The PLO exodus from Beirut was completed ahead of
schedule and the Lebanese government expressed satisfac
tion that the leftist militia was cooperating with the army.
But then the peacekeeping force was withdrawn before its
mission had been accomplished, with two weeks left to its
mandate, and this occurred despite the request from the Leb
anese government that the force remain for the full period.
On Sept. 14, Lebanese president-elect Bashir Gemayel
was killed in an explosion at the Phalangist headquarters
while discussing arrangements for dissolving his party's
militia. The rumor in Lebanon is that Israel was behind the
assassination, and it appears that Gemayel's family agrees.
What is certain is that the next day the Israeli army
launched a three-pronged offensive on West Beirut, os
tensibly because the PLO had violated the departure agree
ment by leaving behind "2000 terrorists." But once in Beirut,
Israeli officers admitted that there were actually very few
PLO fighters there. Israel's other reason for attacking West
Beirut was to maintain "order and security." Israeli soldiers
carried out complete searches, shooting their way into many
homes and arresting hundreds of Lebanese and Palestinians.
Fires burnt out of control across the city. Lebanese took to
the streets to protest the occupation of their capital and were
met by Israeli gunfire. Then the ghastly process of "purify
ing" the refugee camps began.
The Israeli government's dissimulation in the wake of the
slaughter of the unprotected civilians in Sabra and Chatilla
is clear to all but the most prejudiced. One would have hoped
that those who offered tortuous rationalizations of Israel's
actions in Lebanon this summer might have the decency to
remain silent at this time of mourning. Instead one is sub
jected to new heights of hypocrisy by apologists for the
saturation bombing of refugee camps by Israeli pilots (risk
ing their lives to save civilians). An American doctor de
scribed the effects of U.S.-supplied phosphorus bombs on
five dav-old twins from one of the Beirut camps, saying: "I
had to take the babies and put them in buckets of water to
put out the flames. When I took them out half an hour later
they were still burning. Even in the mortuary they smoldered
for hours." It is more than symbolic that the bomb craters in
the camps were later to be used by Israel's allies to conceal
the bodies of their victims.

Israel's daunting propaganda apparatus has been so suc
cessful that it now appears immoderate to demand an in
quiry into why in an elementary school in the city of Sidon
"the bodies lay on top of each other to a depth of perhaps six
feet, their arms and legs around each other, well over one
hundred of them," according to The London Times. After all,
that newspaper reported that it was with "surgical accuracy"
that Israel bombarded Sidon from land, sea and air, leaving
it as if "a tornado had torn through residential buildings and
blocks of flats, ripping off balconies and roof supports, turn
ing massive walls and collapsing whole blocks. There are still
dead in these buildings."
Just three weeks into the invasion the Catholic Relief
Agency (CARITAS) released its "minimum established fig
ures" of the casualties as 14,000 dead and 25,000 wounded.
Last week was not the first time bulldozers dug mass graves
in Lebanon. And this was not the first time Israel invaded
Lebanon. A 1978 dress rehearsal caused "a broad path of
death and destruction" with "hardly a town left undamaged.
Some have been all but flattened by air strikes and explosive
shells throughout most of southern Lebanon, the over
whelming impression is of silence and desolation," accord
ing to The Washington Post. Then too, in the words of the
Israeli Chief of Staff A1 Hamishot, homes were destroyed
with "even no sign that they had been occupied by ter
rorists." All in the name of security.
But the primary objective of this rape of a country and its
capital remains the annihilation of the Palestinian national
identity. It is now clear that Israel perceived a grave threat to
its ongoing annexation of Gaza and the West Bank in the
PLO's expressed willingness to accept a two-state arrange
ment. The desire of the Palestinians for an end to the 15-year
military occupation and for the creation of an independent
Palestine poses problems the Israeli state has decided to re
solve bv shooting demonstrators and blitzing cities.
The Israeli people have for the most part denied the fact
that their country was created at the expense of another soci
ety and culture. Over the decades they have endorsed a
chauvinist ideology which, taken to its logical conclusion,
makes it reasonable to arrange and observe a pogrom. The
issue of Israel's "security" has been exposed for the myth it
has always been. What is needed at this critical stage is a
clear break with policies that can only bring further horrors
to the Mideast.
But Israel does not act in isolation. Without U.S. willing
ness to allow Israel to violate commitments to which the
United States is itself a party, and without massive U.S. mili
tary and economic aid, the carnage in Lebanon would not
have been possible. Even after Israeli troops had entered
West Beirut, President Reagan was requesting that Israel
"withdraw courageously." The role of the United States in
the suffering in Lebanon is little different from Israel's in
Sabra and Chatilla.

hundred of them," according to The London Times. After all,
that newspaper reported that it was with "surgical accuracy"
that Israel bombarded Sidon from land, sea and air, leaving
it as if "a tornado had torn through residential buildings and
blocks of flats, ripping off balconies and roof supports, turn
ing massive walls and collapsing whole blocks. There are still
dead in these buildings."
Just three weeks into the invasion the Catholic Relief
Agency (CARITAS) released its "minimum established fig
ures" of the casualties as 14,000 dead and 25,000 wounded.
Last week was not the first time bulldozers dug mass graves
in Lebanon. And this was not the first time Israel invaded
Lebanon. A 1978 dress rehearsal caused "a broad path of
death and destruction" with "hardly a town left undamaged.
Some have been all but flattened by air strikes and explosive
shells throughout most of southern Lebanon, the over
whelming impression is of silence and desolation," accord
ing to The Washington Post. Then too, in the words of the
Israeli Chief of Staff A1 Hamishot, homes were destroyed
with "even no sign that they had been occupied by ter
rorists." All in the name of security.
But the primary objective of this rape of a country and its
capital remains the annihilation of the Palestinian national
identity. It is now clear that Israel perceived a grave threat to
its ongoing annexation of Gaza and the West Bank in the
PLO's expressed willingness to accept a two-state arrange
ment. The desire of the Palestinians for an end to the 15-year
military occupation and for the creation of an independent
Palestine poses problems the Israeli state has decided to re
solve bv shooting demonstrators and blitzing cities.
The Israeli people have for the most part denied the fact
that their country was created at the expense of another soci
ety and culture. Over the decades they have endorsed a
chauvinist ideology which, taken to its logical conclusion,
makes it reasonable to arrange and observe a pogrom. The
issue of Israel's "security" has been exposed for the myth it
has always been. What is needed at this critical stage is a
clear break with policies that can only bring further horrors
to the Mideast.
But Israel does not act in isolation. Without U.S. willing
ness to allow Israel to violate commitments to which the
United States is itself a party, and without massive U.S. mili
tary and economic aid, the carnage in Lebanon would not
have been possible. Even after Israeli troops had entered
West Beirut, President Reagan was requesting that Israel
"withdraw courageously." The role of the United States in
the suffering in Lebanon is little different from Israel's in
Sabra and Chatilla.

During the negotiations preceeding the departure of PLO
fighters from Beirut, the Palestinian leadership insisted upon
U.S. guarantees that the Israeli army would not enter the
western sector of the city. The PLO was explicit in stating
that Israel's right-wing allies would use the opportunity pro
vided by an Israeli presence in West Beirut to stage a
massacre there, and it received a commitment from Philip
Habib that Israeli forces would not enter that portion of the
citv. Indeed, the 30-day mandate of the multinational peace
keeping force was to protect the civilian population of Beirut
and to assist the Lebanese army in reestablishing its control
there.
The PLO exodus from Beirut was completed ahead of
schedule and the Lebanese government expressed satisfac
tion that the leftist militia was cooperating with the army.
But then the peacekeeping force was withdrawn before its
mission had been accomplished, with two weeks left to its
mandate, and this occurred despite the request from the Leb
anese government that the force remain for the full period.
On Sept. 14, Lebanese president-elect Bashir Gemayel
was killed in an explosion at the Phalangist headquarters
while discussing arrangements for dissolving his party's
militia. The rumor in Lebanon is that Israel was behind the
assassination, and it appears that Gemayel's family agrees.
What is certain is that the next day the Israeli army
launched a three-pronged offensive on West Beirut, os
tensibly because the PLO had violated the departure agree
ment by leaving behind "2000 terrorists." But once in Beirut,
Israeli officers admitted that there were actually very few
PLO fighters there. Israel's other reason for attacking West
Beirut was to maintain "order and security." Israeli soldiers
carried out complete searches, shooting their way into many
homes and arresting hundreds of Lebanese and Palestinians.
Fires burnt out of control across the city. Lebanese took to
the streets to protest the occupation of their capital and were
met by Israeli gunfire. Then the ghastly process of "purify
ing" the refugee camps began.
The Israeli government's dissimulation in the wake of the
slaughter of the unprotected civilians in Sabra and Chatilla
is clear to all but the most prejudiced. One would have hoped
that those who offered tortuous rationalizations of Israel's
actions in Lebanon this summer might have the decency to
remain silent at this time of mourning. Instead one is sub
jected to new heights of hypocrisy by apologists for the
saturation bombing of refugee camps by Israeli pilots (risk
ing their lives to save civilians). An American doctor de
scribed the effects of U.S.-supplied phosphorus bombs on
five dav-old twins from one of the Beirut camps, saying: "I
had to take the babies and put them in buckets of water to
put out the flames. When I took them out half an hour later
they were still burning. Even in the mortuary they smoldered
for hours." It is more than symbolic that the bomb craters in
the camps were later to be used by Israel's allies to conceal
the bodies of their victims.

Israel's daunting propaganda apparatus has been so suc
cessful that it now appears immoderate to demand an in
quiry into why in an elementary school in the city of Sidon
"the bodies lay on top of each other to a depth of perhaps six
feet, their arms and legs around each other, well over one
hundred of them," according to The London Times. After all,
that newspaper reported that it was with "surgical accuracy"
that Israel bombarded Sidon from land, sea and air, leaving
it as if "a tornado had torn through residential buildings and
blocks of flats, ripping off balconies and roof supports, turn

dead in these buildings."
