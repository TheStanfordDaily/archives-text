## Book banning and burning precursors of fascism 
### 
Well, 1 try. I know that morals and manners are in a
rotten way. But every time I try to find something sen
sitive and caring in the people who are banning books,
1 end up in despair. 1 am appalled by their tactics and
saddened by their ignorance. My friend Sally, who
used to teach high school English, is similarly dis
tressed.
"The big problem is that these people have no com
mon sense," she said. "They do not understand that
banning 'The Catcher in the Rye' isn't going to im
prove the moral tone of the community. And censor
ing TV isn't going to keep their kids out of trouble if
that's the kind of kids they've got."
The more children read, she added, the better
equipped they are to cope with the changing patterns
moral and social of these difficult years.
Sally even ventured to suggest that it was parents of
trouble-prone children who were most likely to blame
the deviant behavior bred in their own homes on
the books, films and TV shows favored by young peo
ple.
Without books, the mind contracts. Fear replaces
reason. And it is this fear, above all, that has parents
tearing apart the school curriculum and demanding
that Mark Twain and Walt Whitman be removed
from public-library shelves.
Book banning and other forms of censorship
are high on the agenda of the religious right. The Rev.
Jerry Falwell of the Moral Majority has issued a long
list of books he considers dirty, subversive or both.
These books, he tells his followers, must be removed

from their local libraries. On the list are "The Great
Gatsbv," "The Rights of Man" and that charming
children's book, "Charlotte's Web." Falwell sees no
danger in censorship. It's all part of the far right's
"family protection" crusade.
In a forthcoming book, "The New Subversives:
Anti-Americanism of the Religious Right," theologi
an Daniel Magquire comes straight out and calls this
allegedly "protected" family fascist.

"The core of fascism is the fear of freedom," he
writes. "The Family Protection Act (legislation which
would facilitate censorship) would inhibit the freedom
of all who disagree" with the dogma of the religious
right. The act would also "inhibit the protection of
abused children and battered wives while giving legal
standing to spanking and school prayer."
What sort of people would while cloaked in
righteousness abrogate the Bill of Rights and turn
our schools into propaganda mills for their own phi
losophy? What sort of people are bringing us mind
control in the name of Jesus?
Well, you can see one unforgettable example of a
New Right scourge with a holy mission on a Public

Broadcasting session ("Crisis to Crisis") Friday night.
He's a meek little man in a brown suit and he has
brought a little list to a school-board meeting in Aus
tin, Texas.
"1 am embarrassed to read this list," he begins. The
delicate-minded, he announces, may leave if they
wish. Nobody moves. And so, clearing his throat and
apologizing to God Almighty, the nameless man reads
his list. The list consists of all the "dirty" words listed
in a dictionary the God-fearing citizens of Austin are
proposing to remove from the school libraries.
Some are ancient words from the lavatory walls of
the world. Others are of recent coinage, born of war
and black rage and the audacity of the sexual revolu
tion. Not a single word, including the hyphenated
forms, is new to anv person over 12. I happen to dis
like obscenity on esthetic grounds. But admitting ob
scene words to the dictionary hardly seems likely to
corrupt the book or the readers thereof.
Jimmy Walker, a colorful mayor of New York in
the roaring '2os, once told the Watch & Ward Society
that "no nice girl was ever ruined by a book."
What could easily ruin boys and girls, however, is
growing up in a society that sanctions the banning
and, yes, the burning of books cultivated people
have been reading for years. In the interests of con
formity, Thomas Jefferson noted, millions have been
"burnt, tortured, Fined and imprisoned." And the
only effect has been "to make half the world fools and
the other half hypocrites."
