Painted bike paths ridiculous

I don't understand why the Univer
sity seems to feel we need those ridicu
lous bike paths that were painted this
summer in and around White Plaza and
Tresidder Union.
Frankly, there is no way that their
imposition will add to the safety of ev
eryone moving about on campus. There
are just too many bikers too many to
funnel into these 4-foot wide, single-File
lanes during any between-class passing
time. Trying to enter one of these lanes
when it is crowded will be worse than
rush-hour traffic, plus it will happen ev
ery hour, before every class. If pedestri
ans dare to cross one, they're more like
ly to be clipped than every before, as
ibikers will not be allowed to swerve
around them outside of their lanes. And
people will inevitably go the wrong
way, either inadvertently or deliberate
ly, causing a far worse mess than the
free, easy flow that has existed.

Attacks not justified

Since most of us have managed to re
tain our loyal alliance with the Germa
ny of Goethe and Brahms despite
Hitler, we'll manage, after a decent
atonement (already begun), to make up
with the Israel of Isaiah and Buber.
Five years ago in the Daily I cau
tioned against exaggerating the "pas
sionate Hebrew love of justice" (Eins
tein), saying "That is not what strikes
one first in the Middle East today."
Those who have turned, sometimes
viciously, against the Jews wholesale
because of this one hideous episode (not
remotely comparable to the Nazi
murder of millions) are simply on the
side of the dark forces of life.
