## University must set just example? 
### 
Many of mv colleagues have told me
they do not understand the issues at
stake in the current labor dispute be
tween the University administration
and the United Stanford Workers, Lo
cal 715, and the implications of the
strike and the stalled negotiations. Per
haps their uncertainties result from the
adversarial character of most material
published bv bothsidesandthedifficul
ty of reading between and under the
printed lines. While not pretending to
complete understanding of the in
tricacies of the dispute, 1 think I have
some insights worth sharing with the
community. My first purpose is there
fore informative. But I have a second
purpose: to urge the University admin
istration to resume the negotiations
which it stopped with its "final offer" to
the union of September 7.
The United Stanford Workers, num
bering about 1300, are a heterogeneous
group, with membership ranging from
carpenters, electricians, plumbers and
skilled technicians at SLAC and
elsewhere to gardeners, food-service
workers in the dormitory kitchens and
custodial and janitorial workers. Their
contract with the administration ex
pired on August 31 After negotiations
lasting more than two months, the ad
ministration made its "final offer" on
September 7 and the union went out on
strike September 10.
There are three stated issues: the
union's demand for information about
temporary workers, job-shoppers and
workers that are contracted for with
non-union agencies; wages; and medi
cal and dental benefits. The first issue is
the union's legal justification for the
strike because it failed, apparently, to
give the required thirty days notice of a
strike for economic causes to the Na
tional Labor Relations Board (NLRB).

Tor two years the union has been de
manding this information, presumably
because they believe that these workers
do the kind of work that ought to be
done bv union members and they want
the opportunity to ogranize them. The
NLRB has ruled in the union's favor on
this issue, but the University has ap
pealed that ruling in the courts, on the
grounds that it needs these non-union
workers for "flexibility." One of the
union's early demands in this area
might have had an impact on working
hours available to students because the
union sought a redefinition of part-time
work from 19.9 hours per week to 14.5
hours per week. But the union has
dropped that demand, so nothing re
lated to the first issue threatens the part
time jobs of students.
The second issue, wages, is the most
difficult to describe because of its in
trinsic complexity and the intricacies of
the language in which demands and of
fers are stated. The administration's
"final offer" includes four components:
a three-year contract, a 9.5 percent
across the board increase in the first
year, a 5 percent across the board in
crease in the second and third years,
and new "fourth steps" of 2.5 percent in
the second year and 2.5 percent in the
third year. The "step system" involves
graduated increased in pay related to
length of service in the job; the expired
contract had three "steps."
On Sept. 17 the union made a major
reduction in its wage demands. The lat
ter now have three components: a two
year contract; in the first year an in
crease of 10.25 percent or $l4O per
week, which is higher (the union esti
mates this increase, designed to give
particular help to its lower paid mem
bers, as averaging out at 10.75 percent);
in the second year an across-the-board
increase of five percent plus the in
troduction of a new fourth step of five
percent; and "realignment" or upward
reclassifications of the jobs of about 50
percent of the workers, involving in
creases of up to 15 percent for some
workers. The union and administration
agree that the realignments would in
crease the wage base about three per
cent.
The third issue is medical and dental
benefits. The administration has of
fered no improvements in this area. The
union is making three demands: that
the administration pay for any in
creases in the cost of medical insurance;
that in the second year the adminis
tration pay for full coverage for depen
dents in the cheapest plan (probably
Kaiser); and that in the second year the
deductible for dental insurance be re
duced from $l5O for a family of three or
more to $5O for a family of any size.
On wages, the two sides seem so

close, apart from the differences over
length of contract, that they should be
able to settle the matter quickly if the
administration would budge from its
"final offer." Priscilla Wheeler, the ad
ministration's negotiator, stated, in her
memorandum to the University com
munity of Sept. 21, that the union's de
mand is "of such magnitude" as to be
"simply not reasonable." Surely this is
an instance of managerial hyperbole.
Medical and dental benefits cry out
for improvement, not only for members
of the union, but for members of
faculty and staff as well, especially with
respect to coverage for dependents. It is
ironic that Wheeler boasts of the con
tract's including a provision "requiring
the University to offer to USW any ben
efit improvements made for other Uni
versity employees." If the union had
not won a dental plan for its members,
it is highly unlikely that faculty and
staff would have even the inadequate
one they have now.
Now we must consider the implica
tions of the strike's continuation, dus,
so far as we can tell, to the adminis
tration's refusal to bargain, for mem
bers of the faculty, for our students and
for the University community. For
many teachers, especially in the human
ities, social sciences and programs
VTS and Western Culture, the nature o™
justice is a central issue in their courses,
and most instructors, we believe, hope
that our students come to admire and
strive for a just society. But a university
community in which members of the
faculty are receiving raises of up to 11
percent and secretaries about as much,
but in which technical and service
workers are offered raises of 9.5 per
cent, strikes us as setting before stu-,
dents an example of an unjust society,;
especially when some of those workers, - ;
like cooks and janitors, are trying tc&
support families in the Bay Area 0™
about $6 per hour. Similar pef
centage-raises mask the injustices
created by the different wages on which
those raises are calculated. And even
Plato, that great admirer of hierarchy,
might have balked at Wheeler's argu
ment that the setting of wages must be
"dominated by consideration of the
'markets' " for employees outside the
University.
The conclusion is simple: the strike
must be ended quickly, and the admin
istration must move from its "final of
fer" of Sept. 7 and bargain in good faith
to end it.

across the board increase in the first
year, a 5 percent across the board in
crease in the second and third years,
and new "fourth steps" of 2.5 percent in
the second year and 2.5 percent in the
third year. The "step system" involves
graduated increased in pay related to
length of service in the job; the expired
contract had three "steps."
On Sept. 17 the union made a major
reduction in its wage demands. The lat
ter now have three components: a two
year contract; in the first year an in
crease of 10.25 percent or $l4O per
week, which is higher (the union esti
mates this increase, designed to give
particular help to its lower paid mem
bers, as averaging out at 10.75 percent);
in the second year an across-the-board
increase of five percent plus the in
troduction of a new fourth step of five
percent; and "realignment" or upward
reclassifications of the jobs of about 50
percent of the workers, involving in
creases of up to 15 percent for some
workers. The union and administration
agree that the realignments would in
crease the wage base about three per
cent.
The third issue is medical and dental
benefits. The administration has of
fered no improvements in this area. The
union is making three demands: that
the administration pay for any in
creases in the cost of medical insurance;
that in the second year the adminis
tration pay for full coverage for depen
dents in the cheapest plan (probably
Kaiser); and that in the second year the
deductible for dental insurance be re
duced from $l5O for a family of three or
more to $5O for a family of any size.
On wages, the two sides seem so

close, apart from the differences over
length of contract, that they should be
able to settle the matter quickly if the
administration would budge from its
"final offer." Priscilla Wheeler, the ad
ministration's negotiator, stated, in her
memorandum to the University com
munity of Sept. 21, that the union's de
mand is "of such magnitude" as to be
"simply not reasonable." Surely this is
an instance of managerial hyperbole.
Medical and dental benefits cry out
for improvement, not only for members
of the union, but for members of
faculty and staff as well, especially with
respect to coverage for dependents. It is
ironic that Wheeler boasts of the con
tract's including a provision "requiring
the University to offer to USW any ben
efit improvements made for other Uni
versity employees." If the union had
not won a dental plan for its members,
it is highly unlikely that faculty and
staff would have even the inadequate
one they have now.
Now we must consider the implica
tions of the strike's continuation, dus,
so far as we can tell, to the adminis
tration's refusal to bargain, for mem
bers of the faculty, for our students and
for the University community. For
many teachers, especially in the human
ities, social sciences and programs
VTS and Western Culture, the nature o™
justice is a central issue in their courses,
and most instructors, we believe, hope
that our students come to admire and
strive for a just society. But a university
community in which members of the
faculty are receiving raises of up to 11
percent and secretaries about as much,
but in which technical and service
workers are offered raises of 9.5 per
cent, strikes us as setting before stu-,
dents an example of an unjust society,;
especially when some of those workers, - ;
like cooks and janitors, are trying tc&
support families in the Bay Area 0™
about $6 per hour. Similar pef
centage-raises mask the injustices
created by the different wages on which
those raises are calculated. And even
Plato, that great admirer of hierarchy,
might have balked at Wheeler's argu
ment that the setting of wages must be
"dominated by consideration of the
'markets' " for employees outside the
University.
The conclusion is simple: the strike
must be ended quickly, and the admin
istration must move from its "final of
fer" of Sept. 7 and bargain in good faith
to end it.

Many of mv colleagues have told me
they do not understand the issues at
stake in the current labor dispute be
tween the University administration
and the United Stanford Workers, Lo
cal 715, and the implications of the
strike and the stalled negotiations. Per
haps their uncertainties result from the
adversarial character of most material
published bv bothsidesandthedifficul
ty of reading between and under the
printed lines. While not pretending to
complete understanding of the in
tricacies of the dispute, 1 think I have
some insights worth sharing with the
community. My first purpose is there
fore informative. But I have a second
purpose: to urge the University admin
istration to resume the negotiations
which it stopped with its "final offer" to
the union of September 7.
The United Stanford Workers, num
bering about 1300, are a heterogeneous
group, with membership ranging from
carpenters, electricians, plumbers and
skilled technicians at SLAC and
elsewhere to gardeners, food-service
workers in the dormitory kitchens and
custodial and janitorial workers. Their
contract with the administration ex
pired on August 31 After negotiations
lasting more than two months, the ad
ministration made its "final offer" on
September 7 and the union went out on
strike September 10.
There are three stated issues: the
union's demand for information about
temporary workers, job-shoppers and
workers that are contracted for with
non-union agencies; wages; and medi
cal and dental benefits. The first issue is
the union's legal justification for the
strike because it failed, apparently, to
give the required thirty days notice of a
strike for economic causes to the Na
tional Labor Relations Board (NLRB).

Tor two years the union has been de
manding this information, presumably
because they believe that these workers
do the kind of work that ought to be
done bv union members and they want
the opportunity to ogranize them. The
NLRB has ruled in the union's favor on
this issue, but the University has ap
pealed that ruling in the courts, on the
grounds that it needs these non-union
workers for "flexibility." One of the
union's early demands in this area
might have had an impact on working
hours available to students because the
union sought a redefinition of part-time
work from 19.9 hours per week to 14.5
hours per week. But the union has
dropped that demand, so nothing re
lated to the first issue threatens the part
time jobs of students.
The second issue, wages, is the most
difficult to describe because of its in
trinsic complexity and the intricacies of
the language in which demands and of
fers are stated. The administration's
"final offer" includes four components:
a three-year contract, a 9.5 percent
across the board increase in the first
year, a 5 percent across the board in
crease in the second and third years,
and new "fourth steps" of 2.5 percent in
