## A 						PG afternoon of good clean fun and Linda 
### KAREN SPRINGEN 
Linda Ronstadt
Greek Theater
Berkeley
Sunday, Sept. 27

If Linda Ronstadt's concert at
Berkeley's Greek Theater last
Sunday afternoon were a movie,
it would have been rated PG
(good family entertainment),
would have been expensive
($ 12.50) and would have been av
erage length (less than two
hours).
Fortunately, Ronstadt is not a
movie, for the dynamic female
vocalist excels as a live per
former. She puts more energy
than most artists into her num
bers, relying on her vocal cords
more than her mike.
From the minute she entered
center stage after her band was
already positioned, of course
Ronstadt established herself as
an all-American diva and crowd
pleaser (a far cry from her days of
speaking to Rolling Stone about
drug use).
Talking and giggling between
sets, Ronstadt instantly achieved
a personal rapport with the laid
back, white, middle-class au
dience. The not-quite-sold-out
crowd was one of the tamest con
cert groups imaginable: news
paper magnate William Ran
dolph Hearst, who donated the
Greek Theater, would have been
proud.
The topics of her conversa
tions with the audience ranged
from the ribs she had consumed
backstage before the concert to
her road trip with Jackson
Browne some eight years ago in a
far from luxurious bus.
Ronstadt is apparently con
cerned with raising the social

consciousness of her audience
these days. She urged the crowd
to get out and vote in November.
She said voting for a nuclear
freeze is imperative but sur
prisingly didn't mention much
publicized honey Gov. Brown.
Wearing an army green
knickers jumpsuit with a red belt
and red pumps, the sultry song
stylist. filled the stage with her
presence, and the Greek Theater
with her ample voice: Ronstadt
knows how to belt out a song.
Occasionally, though, she goes
beyond that of a sultry songstress
and approaches the level of a
screaming shrew.
Ronstadt, unfortunately, over
did ballads at the expense of her
superior rock 'n roll numbers.
She must not have realized that
the Greek Theater seating
concrete does not lend itself to
comfortable concert-watching.
As a result, our bottoms and
those of our neighbors suf
fered during the many slow
songs.
Ronstadt's eight-member
back-up band consists of the best
musicians in the business. But
rarely did the audience see or
hear all eight members
guitarists, keyboardists and

back-up vocalists rushed on and
off stage between each set,
switching instruments and taking
breathers during ballad numbers.
It's a wonder they never got con
fused.
Ronstadt herself seemed to fa
vor the wood block, hitting it en
thusiastically at the end of several
numbers.
She favored oldies but goodies
bv Heart, Elvis Costello and
Warren Zevon. And Ronstadt
left no one saying "poor, poor
pitiful me" because she sang just
about every top 40 song she's
ever recorded. She also per
formed the sure-hit single off her
new album, Get Closer, which
will be out this week. This
number not a ballad! re
quired all eight musicians (in
cluding two vocalists).
Joe Ely, a self-proclaimed Tex
as rock 'n roller, opened the noon
concert. A cross between Elvis

Costello, Elvis Presley and Bud
dy Holly, he belted out rock fa
vorites by the likes of Holly and
company.
His songs were fun and funny,
including lyrics such as "I wish

hard living didn't come so easy to
me."
Both Ronstadt and Ely pro
vided an afternoon of good clean
family fun in the sunny at
mosphere of the Greek Theater.
