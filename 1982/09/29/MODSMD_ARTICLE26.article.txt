						Stanford Daily: a 'headline' act
## 
### 
What does the Daily have to offer you f Serving the University area,
the newspaper is made up of more than 100 editorial and business
staff members and offers valuable educational and pre
professional experience in addition to happy hours and staff
lunches with guest speakers.
Wasn't the Daily in a famous court case once? Yes. In 1971 Palo
Alto police officers searched the Daily offices for photographic
negatives to identify demonstrators. The Daily sued and the case
went to the Supreme Court, where in 1978 the high court ruled
against the paper.
Is the Daily affiliated with the Department of Communication or
the University? No. In 1973 the Daily became independent of the
University and became an unaffiliated corporation.
Do you have to try out to join the Daily staff ?No! Everyone is wel
come. Remember NO EXPERIENCE IS NECESSARY, but
experience does, of course, help.
So how can you get involved? Easy \ Just come to one of our orien
tation meetings during registration week or drop by anytime dur
ing the year. And watch for our special workshops during the fall.
