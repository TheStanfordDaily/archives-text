## Cardinal booters top B YU; face Sacramento St. today 
### ADAM BERNS 
The Stanford soccer team went out to lunch in the
first half but came back with vigor in the second to
defeat Bngham Young University 3-0 on Monday.
The Cardinal scored all three goals in the second
half and recorded its first shutout of the season in
the win. Junior striker Jorge Titinger led the Stan
ford attack, scoring the first two goals of the game
with freshman striker Todd Rafalovich scoring the
third. Sophomore midfielder Angel Vasquez had
two assists while Rafalovich had the other.
"We had to wait until the second half to do any
thing but it was our first shutout," soccer coach
Nelson Lodge said after the victory.
The Cardinal thoroughly dominated the contest,
taking 25 shots compared with 12 for BYu!
Sophomore goalie Willie Burkhardt had five saves'
The Cardinal has already posted a 5-1 -1 record
its only loss coming to fifth-ranked Indiana and
seems well on its way to a successful season. The
only question marks Lodge has this early in the sea
son regard injuries and inexperience.
Stanford has already lost freshman midfielder
Tom Rafalovich for the season with a broken leg.
"He (Rafalovich) was really shoring up our de
fense," Lodge said. "At this moment, the loss of
Tom has really changed our strategy.
"The other question mark is the maturity factor.
We're made up primarily of freshmen and
sophomores with some juniors and seniors."
Lodge feels that the sky is the limit for his team
this year, but he won't be looking for any specific
stars to carry the team.
Last year the team relied heavily some would
say too heavily on striker Willie Guicci who led
the team with 22 goals and 47 points. This season
Lodge is looking for a more balanced attack.

"Last year 85 percent of our scoring came from
one person," Lodge explains. "This year the scoring
is more evenly distributed so that is a plus. The rea
son it's a plus is because when the chips get down,
teams have a tendency to rely on the one person
who has been doing all the scoring, but he's only hu
man and can't always come through. This year they
aren't looking to any one person."
Stanford's only loss this season came to Indiana
(4-2), and Lodge said he feels the game was a prime
example of how his team can be hurt by its youth
and inexperience.
Indiana scored in the first minute and a half but
the Cardinal came right back and evened the score
five minutes later. Later in the game, however, there
were some breakdowns in the Stanford defense and
Lodge said he felt the Cardinal was tentative
throughout the game.
"We just made some big blunders in our de
fense," Lodge explained. "We are within reach of a
team like that and we'd love to play them again."
The most costly victory for the Cardinal was
against UC-Davis. In that game, freshman mid
fielder Tom Rafalovich broke his leg while trying to
make a tackle. Tom's twin brother Todd is also on
the team and is one its best strikers.
With the loss of Guicci to graduation, Lodge has
been looking for a team effort on offense and has
been getting it. Titinger, the team's second leading
scorer last season, and Vasquez are two of the
players that Lodge is counting on this season.
Although Lodge is always hesitant to single out
individuals, he feels that senior stopper Doug Clark
could be the key to the Cardinal defense this season.
"Doug seems to be our team leader," Lodge said,
"and he epitomizes the type of play we like to see. In
