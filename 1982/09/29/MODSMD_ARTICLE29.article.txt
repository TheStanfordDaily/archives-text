Oakland Oakland A's Man
ager Billy Martin says he's been
approached by the New York
Yankees and the Cleveland Indi
ans about managing those teams,
but isn't looking for away out of
his job with the fifth-place A's.
"I'm not soliciting jobs. I have
three more years on my contract
with Oakland," Martin said
Monday night as his team's rec
ord fell to 66-90 with a loss in
Texas.
"There are only two clubs that
have called, New York and
Cleveland," Martin added.
"Other than that I have no com
ment."
Before leaving Oakland for the
road trip that also will take the
A's to Kansas City, Martin said:
"I want to stay here. My home is
here."
Martin, whose A's won the
American League West last sea
son, was raised in Berkeley. He
reportedly is receiving more than
$200,000 a year under his five

year contract with Oakland.
He said Oakland President
Roy Eisenhart gave Yankees
owner George Steinbrenner and
Cleveland president Gabe Paul
permission to talk to him about
managing jobs.
Martin, 54, managed the Yan
kees during five seasons. He
started in August 1975, replacing
Bill Virdon. Steinbrenner fired
Martin in July 1978, rehired him
the next spring and refired him in
October 1979.
Martin has also managed De
troit and Texas, for three years
each, and was in Minnesota for
one season.
Clyde King has been managing
the sixth-place Yankees on an in
terim basis since replacing Gene
Michael on Aug. 4. Michael had
taken over for Bob Lemon on
April 27.
Bill Bergesch, the Yankees vice
president for baseball opera
tions, said King's status will not
be discussed until the season
ends.
