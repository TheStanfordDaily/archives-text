# Of pickets and scabs: USW adjusting to strike conditions
## Employees working at maintaining picket lines 
### KATHERINE HUTT Senior staff writer 
As the semi rolled slowly toward
Jhem, the strikers straightened the signs
Riey carried and formed several lines
blocking the road. They began to stroll
casually back and forth, some with their
heads down and set expressions on their
faces, some talking and joking with
their friends. The truck inched forward,
forcing the men to give ground slightly.

"Are you a member of the union?
Would you like to join?" one of the
strikers asked the driver. "No, I didn't
ihink so," he added as the driver did not
Tespond. Then he and the others drifted
off to the side of the road, allowing the
semi to pass.
This scene has been repeated many
times in the 20 days of the strike by the
United Stanford Workers. While the
union negotiating team and University
officials have not been meeting at the

bargaining tables, Stanford workers
have been maintaining picket lines on a
daily basis.
What motivates them? Most of the
reasons given fall into one of two cate
gories. "Sure we like Stanford. But
they're not supporting us. They're not
giving us living wages," said Roth
house cook Bob Byerly. Other strikers,
including highly-skilled, long-term em
ployees of the University, want better
medical and dental benefits for their
families, according to Mike Starek, a
Stanford Linear Accelerator Center
technician.
Most pickets seem ideologically com
mitted as well. "I picket because I think
that what 1 picket for is right and, be
cause I'm all for the union," declared
painter Manny Sanchez.
"If you're a union member, you
should abide by the union," Starek
agreed.
Of the approximately 850 USW
workers on strike, nearly 500 are active

ly involved on the picket lines or
at strike headquarters, according
to Michael Baratz, executive sec
retary of USW. Coordinating
this pumber of people requires a
certain amount of expertise, but
the workers of AFL-CIO Local
715,i0f which USW is a part, have
held eight strikes in the past 13
years. "We know how to or
ganize strikes," said Baratz.
Between 30 and 40 people are
in the headquarters in Palo Alto
at .all times, answering phone
calls, from the press and handling
requests from the pickets, ac
cording to Baratz. Tables lining
the walls are covered with sand
wich materials and coffee urns,
whiqh are distributed to the peo
ple on the lines every few hours.
On the wall is a map of the
Stanford campus with the picket
locations marked, and next to it a
roster of picket duty. The days
are divided into blocks of four
hours including the "owl" shift
from midnight to 8 a.m., which
ensures that certain strategic lo
cations on the University campus
are continuously manned. There
are also lists for people on phone
duty and food duty and those re
sponsible for childcare.
Each week, workers who have
helped with the strike effort for
twenty hours or more are paid
$ 100 from the union's emergency
fund. For many USW members,
this is currently their only source

of income. "But your grocery bill
goes on, your rent bill goes on,
and the people with the large
families, they're really in a bind,"
observed Starek.
Many strikers do only four
hour shifts, during the early
morning or night hours, and
work in temporary jobs during
the day to pick up extra money.
So far the strikers have not been
very successful at finding other
jobs, according to electrician Bob
Elmore, but "no one has totally
gone under yet."
Although the strike has gone
on for 20 days, morale remains
high among USW members.

"Most people are still hanging in
there. They're pretty confident
that it's going to get settled," said
Elmore.
"I'm not going to give up for a
long time vet," said Byerly.
Sanchez has faith in the power
of the union. "If we keep united,
we can accomplish what we want.
The more time goes on, the more
united we get," he said.
Although they are protesting
the "unfair labor practices" of
the University, the strikers have
no hard feelings against the
school. "It's an ironic situation.

Stanford is considered a really
good place to work," said Starek.
"It's hard to think that there's
lot of antagonism, because most
of the people out here are model
employees," he added.
The strikers speak highly of the
University. "The working condi
tions at Stanford are better than
on the outside," according to
Elmore. And the reason that the
University has not given in to the
union's demands, said electrician
A1 Common, is that "they're
trying to save money, just like
anvone else."
