# Of pickets and scabs: USW adjusting to strike conditions
## Employees working at maintaining picket lines 
### KATHERINE HUTT Senior staff writer 
As the semi rolled slowly toward
Jhem, the strikers straightened the signs
Riey carried and formed several lines
blocking the road. They began to stroll
casually back and forth, some with their
heads down and set expressions on their
faces, some talking and joking with
their friends. The truck inched forward,
forcing the men to give ground slightly.

"Are you a member of the union?
Would you like to join?" one of the
strikers asked the driver. "No, I didn't
ihink so," he added as the driver did not
Tespond. Then he and the others drifted
off to the side of the road, allowing the
semi to pass.
This scene has been repeated many
times in the 20 days of the strike by the
United Stanford Workers. While the
union negotiating team and University
officials have not been meeting at the

bargaining tables, Stanford workers
have been maintaining picket lines on a
daily basis.
What motivates them? Most of the
reasons given fall into one of two cate
gories. "Sure we like Stanford. But
they're not supporting us. They're not
giving us living wages," said Roth
house cook Bob Byerly. Other strikers,
including highly-skilled, long-term em
ployees of the University, want better
medical and dental benefits for their
families, according to Mike Starek, a
Stanford Linear Accelerator Center
technician.
Most pickets seem ideologically com
mitted as well. "I picket because I think
that what 1 picket for is right and, be
cause I'm all for the union," declared
painter Manny Sanchez.
"If you're a union member, you
should abide by the union," Starek
agreed.
Of the approximately 850 USW
workers on strike, nearly 500 are active

CROSSING THE LINE: Striking University employees attempt to dissuade
a truck driver from making a delivery on Stanford grounds. The union
feels that deliveries on campus are in violation of the picket line and supportive
of the University.
