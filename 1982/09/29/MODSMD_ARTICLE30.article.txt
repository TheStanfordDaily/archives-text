## Ed Garvey can be head hasher 
### 
Sunday never seemed so lonely.

There was no Phyllis George picking the Cow
boys to win for the umpteenth time. There was
no Brent Musberger stumbling through the
day's scores and highlights. There weren't even
any Lite beer commercials.
Oh sure, the networks found some dust-cov
ered reels in the closet to fill up airtime with, but
the fact remains the same: the National Football
League strike has hit with staggering force and
unvielding ruthlessness.
It didn't really hit me on Monday night when
Gene Upshaw and his pals declared they were
walking out. It didn't even sink in after Thurs
day night's game was canceled. But Sunday, it
was like a sledge hammer in the crotch. It hit me
hard, and it hurt.
I felt like the little girl in Poltergeist , sitting in
front of the television and watching the snow fill
up the screen. And waiting for something to hap
pen. At 3 a.m., however, I realized there would
be no football. Downtrodden, I slithered into
bed.
From the depths of my depression, I have de
cided to send to both sides some viable solutions
to end this dilemma and bring some sunshine
back to Sunday afternoons. One "Black Sun
day" is enough.
Dear Sirs: There has been much discussion re
garding the playing of All-Star games. Nobody
even watches the "official" Pro Bowl. No, in
stead we should have All-Owner games. Ai
Davis would be the hardest-hitting safety since
Jack Tatum, especially since he will be hitting
the other owners. Georgia Rosenbloom-Fron
tiere: stick her at noseguard. Let Art Rooney

handle punt returns from his iron lung. This
would allow the owners to get a feel for the value
of their players and the physical tasks they carry
out.
And, if we run out of owners, get the coaches
into the act. Ray Malavasi can play the left side
of the offensive line if we can find a uniform that
will fit him.
As for the players, simply switch places with
the striking Stanford employees. Ed Garvey can
be head hasher at Stern and the rest of the
players can fill in as needed. It would mean a
great deal to a freshman to see Conrad Dobler in
food service slinging hash. "I'd like two scoops
of the macaroni and raisin salad. Please. Mr.
Dobler. Sir."
As for television viewers, the networks can
keep turning the public's stomachs by giving us
assorted bits of video garbage. These include the
United States vs. the World in soap carving, the
Senior Citizen Lawn Bowling championships,
and the world's strongest chimpanzee competi
tion, to name a few.
The strategem here is that if you keep feeding
these to the public long enough, they'll forget all
about football. Then the owners can invest their
capital in Chrysler and the players can all be
come liquor store owners or real estate salesmen.
Of course, there is always the most obvious al
ternative of solving the stupid thing before the
fans get hurt any more. Both sides can chain
themselves to the bargaining table until reaching
a fair and equitable settlement.
Naw, scratch that last one, Jack and Ed. It
makes too much sense. I'd rather watch kick
boxing anyway.
Sincerely yours, The Odes Factor
