# Judge rules for union in effort to see books
## 
### Associated Press 
Washington A labor law
judge yesterday ruled in favor of
the National Football League
Players Association in its effort
to force the NFL to open some of
its records to union negotiators
seeking a new contract.
Administrative Law Judge
Julius Cohn held that the NFL
Management Council, the
league's bargaining agent, had vi
olated the National Labor Rela
tions Act by refusing to furnish
the players' union with individ
ual player contracts and the non
monetary provisions of TV and
network radio contracts.
The 14-page ruling, released
today, stems from three days of
hearings that Cohn held in June,
approximately three weeks
before the players' association
contract with the NFL expired.
In ruling that the league has vi
olated the law, Cohn thus upheld
the player association's unfair la
bor practice charge and has rec
ommended to the full five-mem
ber National Labor Relations
Board that the league be ordered
to turn over the documents to the
union.
The decision by Cohn may be
appealed by management to the
full NLRB for review and a final
decision.
The league's 1500 players
the NFL on Sept. 21,

claiming the owners' failure to
bargain in good faith had forced
the strike.
"It's only a recommendation.
The board didn't seek an order to
turn over the financial arrange
ments in the television contract
that players sought. Certainly,
that's the major thing the players
were after," said Jim Miller, a
spokesman for the NFL Man
agement Council, which handles
the league's negotiations with the
union. "These things are routine
ly overruled all the time. We feel
confident it will be overruled this
time.
"This is not such a major
thing. The timing seems bad be
cause we are ready to go into an
other negotiating session. The
players already have examined
player contracts, which they've
been given the right to see again
by the board."
But Ed Garvey, executive di
rector of the N FLPA, felt it was a
significant decision.
"We were extremely pleased,"
Garvey said of the decision.
"It's important because we are
alleging that this is an unfair la
bor practice strike and we think
this is the first step in proving this
allegation. It's a nice, clear signal
to all the owners . . . that this is a
serious step toward establishing
this as an unfair labor practice
strike," Garvey said.
