Terry Harper's bases-loaded,
three-run third-inning double
triggered a 13-hit Atlanta attack
Tuesday night as the Braves
downed San Francisco 8-3 to
vault into first place in the Na
tional League West.
Coupled with Los Angeles'
4-3, 10-inning loss to Cincinnati,
the Braves took over sole
possesion of first place for the
first time since Sept. 12. The
Dodgers are second, one game
back, while the Giants trail by
two.
Milwaukee increased their
lead in the American League East
to three games over Baltimore
with a 9-3 win over Boston. De
troit beat Baltimore 9-6.
California's magic number re
mained at two as they fell to the
second place Kansas City Royals
5-4.
Reliever Pascual Perez, 3-4,
came on for starter Rick Mahler
to put down a third-inning San
Francisco uprising and shut out
the Giants the rest of the way. He
scattered three hits over 6 2-3 in
nings of work.
Atlanta erupted for five runs in
the third. Bruce Benedict led off
with a single, went to second on
Rick Mahler's sacrifice and
scored on Claudell Washington's
single to give the Braves a 2-1

lead.
After Rafael Ramirez beat out
an infield hit, Rich Gale relieved
starter Bill Laskey, 13-12, and
walked Dale Murphy to load the
bases. A1 Holland relieved and
got Chris Chambliss to pop up
for the second out. Harper then
ripped a double into the left field
corner, the ball hitting the chalk
on the foul line, clearing the bases
for a 5-1 Atlanta lead.
In Los Angeles, Rafael Land
estoy's pinch single drove in Ron
Oesterinthe 10th inning Tuesday
night, then Joe Price pitched out
of a bases-loaded, no-out jam as
the last-place Cincinnati Reds
defeated Los Angeles 4-3, giving
the reeling Dodgers their seventh
straight loss.
Oester began the tenth by
drawing a walk off reliever Dave
Stewart, 9-8. Larry Biittner sacri
ficed Oester to second and Land
estoy bounced a 2-2 pitch just out
of the reach of shortstop Bill
Russell to score Oester.

George Brett and the Kansas
City Royals made certain the
California Angels didn't sip any
champagne Tuesday night in
Kansas City.
Brett drove in the winning run
with a two-out single to right
field in the seventh inning, and
the Royals defeated Angels 5-4 to

keep the Angels' magic number
for winning the American
League West Championship at
two.
"It's too late to give up now,"
said Brett after Kansas City
trimmed California's division
lead to m games. The Royals
have five games left, and the
Angels have four.
The Angels could still clinch
their second AL West title in four
years with a victory over the
Royals in the series finale
Wednesday
Elsewhere, Lance Parrish
slapped a two-run homer and
Mike Ivie and John Wockenfuss
added solo shots to power the
Detroit Tigers to a 9-6 victory
over Baltimore Tuesday night,

dampening the Orioles' playoff
hopes.

son set a single-season American
League record for home runs by a
catcher, breaking the mark held
by Yogi Berra of the 1956 New
York Yankees and Gus Triandos
of the 1958 Orioles.
In Boston, Robin Yount
belted a two-run homer in the
first inning, becoming the first
American League player to reach
200 hits this season and trigger
ing the Milwaukee Brewers to a
9-3 victory over the Boston Red
Sox behind Doc Medich and re
liever Moose Haas Tuesday
night.
