### JULIE KAUFMANN Senior staff writer 
Singer Kris Kristofferson and comic Andy Kauf
man joined several lesser luminaries on Gov. Brown's
"Whistle Stop Celebrity Tour" fundraiser in Palo
Alto last night.
Singers, piano players, television actresses and the
governor's mother took turns on the Spangenberg
Theater stage, performing and stumping for the Sen
ate candidate.
The last act on this political variety show was the
governor himself. "1 hope you're having a good time,"
Brown greeted the audience of about 300, who had
paid $lO each to attend the event at Gunn High
School. -
Calling computers "the pencils of the 1980s,"
Brown praised a bill he will sign into law today provid
ing tax credits to companies which donate computers
to schools. These new pencils belong "in the hand of
every student in every school," he said.
"I'll be voting to keep the department of education,
not abolish it," Brown said, emphasizing that his sup
port of funding for education is stronger than that of
his Republican opponent, San Diego Mayor Pete
Wilson.
Brown reiterated his support for a nuclear arms
freeze.
"The nuclear arms race has away of getting away

from you. It's like an addiction," Brown said in the 10-
minute speech. "When, when do you £top taking away
vital resources of this country chasing this elusive goal
of having more nuclear armaments?"
Kristofferson, backed up by singer/guitarist Billy
Swan and a three-piece band, opened his act with "Me
and Bobby McGee."
"This is the high school my son goes to," the singer
said, laughing. "I hope he's not embarrassed."
Three songs later Kristofferson said, "Here's a po
litical campaign promise" and passed the mike to
Swan. Swan sang his hit "1 Can Help."
Comic Kaufman, a surprise guest* danced, played
congo drums and sang to the crowd.
The young audience giggled and hooted as the star
of "Taxi", dressed only in white, diaper-like
bloomers, a dirty turban, Watlabeesand brown socks,
had four members of the audience mouth the words to
"Old McDonald Had a Farm" to a scratchy rec
ording.
Bernice Brown introduced her son, the governor
with a play on his campaign slogan "Take another
look at Jerry Brown.
"I'm the first one to look at Jerry," she said, and
after all this time "I think I'll keep him."
Before the show, the theater lobby resembled a
carnival, with crepe paper decorations, balloons,
signs, a voter registration table and
booths for Rep. Tom Lantos, the Dem
ocratic candidate for the 13th con
gressional district, and sheriff can
didate Phil Crawford.
Crawford's supporters sold choco
late bars in front of a nearly life-sized
photo of the candidate and the voter
registrars hawked their wares: "Reg
ister to vote. Are you registered to
vote?"
The "Celebrity Tours" began in San
Diego and will end in Eureka.
