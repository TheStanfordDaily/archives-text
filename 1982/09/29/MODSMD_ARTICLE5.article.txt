Reagan will send marines to Lebanon

Washington President Reagan said last night that American Marines
will re-enter Beirut today to take up a peacekeeping mission that will last
until the Lebanese government is in full control and "able to preserve or
der."
Reagan told a White House news conference the Marines will return this
morning to the Beirut mission from which they were withdrawn on Sept. 10,
and "I can't tell you what the time element will be" on the duration of their
stay.
"The Lebanese government will be the ones to tell us when they feel that
they're in charge, and we can go home," Reagan said. He said he believes all
Israeli and Syrian forces will be withdrawn "rapidly," with the U.S., French
and Italian peacekeeping contingent back on the job.
He said the Marines will go ashore when Israeli forces are withdrawn to a
line south of the Beirut airport. Reagan said Syria also has said it is willing to
pull back its forces.
On other points, Reagan:
Said he "never has had any thought" of undermining the Israeli govern
ment of Prime Minister Menachem Begin because of its resistence to his
Middle East peace proposals. He said he does not believe the Israelis are
trying to undermine his plan, despite their rejection of his call for a Palesti
nian autonomy under Jordanian supervision on the West Bank and in the
Gaza Strip. . _
— Again defended his economic program, saying that
there are signs of recovery soon, and blaming Democrats
for problems of recession and unemployment. "We still
have a long way to go but together we pulled America
back from the brink of disaster," he said.
Reagan was asked what he would do if new fighting
should erupt, and embroil American forces in Lebanon.
He said he does not expect that, then declined to discuss
further a question he called hypothetical.
In what has become a news conference pattern, Reagan
began with a prepared statement defending his economic
program and blaming the Democrats. He said inflation
has been cut in half, interest rates are declining and "there
are other signs that we're heading toward a good re
covery."
Reagan acknowledged that there is a long way to go,
with economic indicators pointing to a continuing slump
and with unemployment at 9.8 percent. But he said
"we're better off than we were."
He urged Congress to act before its campaign recess on
economic bills including appropriations to fit his budget,
a constitutional amendment to require balanced budgets
in the long-term future and the administration job train
ing bill.
PLO commander slain in ambush
Beirut, Lebanon — The Palestine Liberation Organiza
tion's top military commander was reported killed yester
day in an ambush in eastern Lebanon's Bekaa Valley, the
right-wing Christian Voice of Lebanon radio said.
A broadcast quoting the Palestinian news agency
WAFA said Brig. Saad Sayel, the PLO's chief of staff,
was killed while inspecting guerrilla positions near the
city of Baalbeck overlooking the Bekaa, where both Is
raeli and Syrian forces' are deployed. The broadcast
quoted WAFA as blaming Israel for Sayel's death.
Earlier, the British Broadcasting Corp. said Sayel was
ambushed by 30 men with rifles and grenade launchers
but did not further identify the attackers. It said Sayel
died later at a Syrian hospital.
The reported death came as the Israeli Parliament in
Jerusalem opened a special debate on whether to launch a
full-scale judicial probe into Israel's conduct during the
Beirut massacre of Palestinians earlier this month.
Israeli Prime Minister Menachem Begin's Cabinet
members, bowing to intense public pressure, were re
ported ready to support such a probe, and Begin himself
was reported as saying it was needed.
1200 U.S. Marines were poised off Beirut's shore,
ready to move into the war-torn Lebanese capital as part
of a tri-national peacekeeping force after Israeli soldiers
leave. They will join 1100 French soldiers and 1100 Ital

ian troops.
In Tel Aviv, Israel's military command said its forces
would be out of the Moslem West Beirut by today, but
said it will take longer to pull back from the Christian
eastern section of the city.
French and Italian troops Monday moved into Sabra
and Chatilla refugee camps where the Lebanese govern
ment said about 600 Palestinians were slaughtered Sept.
16-18 by Lebanese Christian militiamen. The camps were
under Israeli control.
Israel television reported Monday all Cabinet mem
bers at yesterday's meeting were ready to back a com
mission inquiry with full subpoena powers and the right
to force witnesses to testify under oath.
The state television also said Begin himself decided
that failure to establish a full inquiry was damaging Is
rael's image.
Last week, the Cabinet adopted Begin's proposal that
Israel's chief justice conduct an investigation, but
without subpoena powers.
Many Isralis who supported the country's June 6 drive
into Lebanon to rout the PLO are now demanding the
resignation of Defense Minister Ariel Sharon.
In Lebanon, a massacre investigative committee ap
pointed by newly elected President Amin Gemayel met
Monday and decided to ask survivors to testify in the mil
itary court yesterday, Lebanese radio said. Gemayel is a
leader in the Phalange Party, whose militiamen have been
blamed bv Israel for the killings.
Israeli troops had the two camps surrounded during
the massacre, and Sharon said the assault was mounted
with Israeli planning and support to rout diehard PLO
Fighters reported in the camps.
Morgan loses $lO million palimony
Los Angeles A judge threw out most of Vicki
Morgan's $lO million suit against the estate of the late
Alfred Bloomingdale yesterday, saying their relationship
was "no more than that of a wealthy, older, married para
mour and young, well-paid mistress."
Superior Court Judge Christian Markey discarded
Miss Morgan's "palimony" claims based on unwritten
contracts between her and the Diner's Club founder.
But he said the 30-year-old former model had the right
to sue the estate for breach of written contract, which she
claims Bloomingdale signed on her behalf.
In the part of the suit rejected by Markey, Morgan had
sought $5OOO a month for life and a home befitting
Bloomingdale's lifestyle. That claim was based on an al
leged unwritten contract along the lines of the pact given
legal sanction by the California Supreme Court in
Michelle Marvin's palimony against actor Lee Marvin.
"It was never the intent of the Supreme Court in

Marvin to establish 'a Mistress Recovery Act,'" Markey
wrote in granting the request for summary judgment by
the Bloomingdale estate and Bloomingdale's widow,
Betsy Bloomingdale.
The judge let stand two counts of action in which Miss
Morgan claimed that on Feb. 12, 1982, Bloomingdale en
tered into a written agreement promising to pay her
$ 10,000 a month for two years beginning March 1982, for
a total of $240,000.
Regarding the alleged oral agreements, the judge said
that in the Marvin case the court had recognized "the
need to provide to those who desired to live together
without marriage the legal framework within which to
structure their relationships and order their economic af
fairs."
However, he said Morgan and Bloomingdale "never
lived together for any purpose." At all relevant times,
plaintiff (Miss Morgan) knew that decedent (Bloom
ingdale) was married, had been for many years and had
no intention of living with her."
In a deposition released Monday, Morgan had de
scribed sadistic sexual sessions during which the million
aire beat naked women and drooled while sitting on their
backs.
Prime rate drops to 13 percent
New York A major New York bank cut its prime
lending rate to 13 percent yesterday, the lowest level in
two years. No other big banks followed.
Economists attributed the reluctance of other banks to
match the lower rate to heightened uncertainty about the
direction of the Federal Reserve Board's monetary poli
cy.
Some economists said banks' concern about losses on
loans to Financially strapped corporations and govern
ments also may partly explain their hesitance in cutting
rates.
Bankers Trust Co., the nation's lOth-largest com
mercial bank by deposits, said it lowered its prime rate
from the 13.5 percent level prevailing in the banking in
dustry because its cost of acquiring funds for lending had
declined recently.
Bankers Trust's break with the rest of the industry
marked the First change in the prime rate by any major
bank since Aug. 20, when most banks moved to 13.5 per
cent from 14 percent.
The prime rate is a base from which commercial banks
calculate interest charges on short-term loans to business
customers. Companies with top-notch credit ratings
often can arrange loans at rates lower than the prime rate,
while smaller, less creditworthy companies often are
charged rates higher than the prime.

The prime rate is not applied to consumer loans, but it
usually points to the direction of interest rates in general.
W. Lee Hoskins, an economist at Pittsburgh National
Bank, said he did not expect other major banks to quickly
follow the lead of Bankers Trust because they fear the
Federal Reserve may tighten its grip on the availability of
funds in the banking system. That would tend to force up
banks' cost of acquiring money.
Computer theft defendants acquitted
San Jose, Calif. A federal judge dismissed indict
ments yesterday against three defendants in an interna
tional computer spying case after governnment prose
cutors refused to turn over documents sought by defense
attorneys.
U.S. District Judge Robert Aguilar dismissed federal
indictments against Raymond Cadet, Barry Saffaie and
Tabassom Ayazi, who had been accused of receiving
computer secrets allegedly stolen from International
Business Machines.
The case involves an alleged conspiracy by Hitachi
Ltd. and Mitsubishi Electric Corp. to steal computer
trade secrets.
Assistant U.S. Attorney Gregory Ward said the gov
ernment would appeal the dismissal.
Federal indictments were issued in July against 21 peo
ple including nine in Japan and the two giant
Japanese electronic companies, Hitachi and Mitsubishi,
on charges of conspiring to steal IBM secrets.
Aguilar's order came on the heels of efforts by Hitachi
lawyers to pry information from IBM to show that their
clients are innocent in the secrets conspiracy case.
Market down after early surge
The stock market turned in a mixed performance yes
terday, reversing course late in the session after rising for
most of the day.
The first cut in the prime lending rate since Aug. 20
failed to stop the late selloff, with high technology issues
among the big losers.
The Dow Jones average of 30 industrial stocks, up 1.38
points Monday, closed off 1.57 points at 919.33. The
blue-chip average had been up as much as 5.52 points af
ter three hours of trading and did not show a loss until the
final 30 minutes of the session.
Today's weather

60s to upper 70s. Winds westerly 10 to 25 mph afternoon
and evening. Fair tonight and tomorrow. Lows in the 50s.
