Reagan will send marines to Lebanon

Washington President Reagan said last night that American Marines
will re-enter Beirut today to take up a peacekeeping mission that will last
until the Lebanese government is in full control and "able to preserve or
der."
Reagan told a White House news conference the Marines will return this
morning to the Beirut mission from which they were withdrawn on Sept. 10,
and "I can't tell you what the time element will be" on the duration of their
stay.
"The Lebanese government will be the ones to tell us when they feel that
they're in charge, and we can go home," Reagan said. He said he believes all
Israeli and Syrian forces will be withdrawn "rapidly," with the U.S., French
and Italian peacekeeping contingent back on the job.
He said the Marines will go ashore when Israeli forces are withdrawn to a
line south of the Beirut airport. Reagan said Syria also has said it is willing to
pull back its forces.
On other points, Reagan:
Said he "never has had any thought" of undermining the Israeli govern
ment of Prime Minister Menachem Begin because of its resistence to his
Middle East peace proposals. He said he does not believe the Israelis are
trying to undermine his plan, despite their rejection of his call for a Palesti
nian autonomy under Jordanian supervision on the West Bank and in the
Gaza Strip. . _
