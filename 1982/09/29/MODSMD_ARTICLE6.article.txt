# $18,000 loss at ASSU Recycling
## 
### STEVETROUSDALE Staff writer 
In an otherwise uneventful meeting,
the ASSU Senate met last night to hear
Student Financial Manager Robert
Brodv discuss possible cutbacks in, or
even the dropping of, the ASSU recycl
ing service.
In his report Brody discussed the
profits and losses of the various ASSU
programs last year. In this presentation
he stated that the recycling program
had lost over $lB,OOO in 1981-82. He
then suggested that the senate consider
cutting certain aspects of the program
or even dropping it altogether, but
added that outside sources of funding,
such as fee assessments, were being ex
plored in an effort to subsidize the pro
gram.
Brody also mentioned that, in an
economy measure, the recycling center
had already stopped collecting mixed

papers from dorms and instead was tak
ing only newspapers.
Frederick Beddall, the manager of
the recycling program, said after the
meeting that the program did need to
find a new source of funding for future
years. He said that fee assessments were
obviously one solution in future years,
but said that in thtf current year,
without a fee assessment, recycling will
face serious funding problems.
However, he said the abolition of the
program was improbable and political
ly sillv.
In other business. Vlichae! Reeds,
rules committee chanman said that
change is needed in the ASSU election
procedure.
After the meeting, he said that one of
these changes has already taken place:
the rules committee has developed an
election timetable. In the past, he said,
the elections commissioner had de

signed the timetable. When "the elec
tions commissioner was competent," he
said, "we had competently run elec
tions." But inept commissioners, he
said, have led to badly run elections.
With the new schedule, he explained,
the basic format of elections is unchang
ing, and he said that this would lead to
better-run elections.
In the only new business discussed,
one bill and one resolution were sub
mitted to the senate, both by graduate
senator James McGrath.
The proposed bill would change the
way thi se ate and other bodies of the
ASSU < > iduct their meetings.
The resolution, which recognized
University President Donald Ken
nedy's approval of the four amend
ments to tfcte ASSU Constitution ap
proved by students last spring, com
pletes the formal amendment process.
