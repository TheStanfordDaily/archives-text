# Union workers bitter toward temporary help

### SETH ZUCKERMAN 
Although the current strike by the
United Stanford Workers (USW) has
been considerably calmer than violent
clashes of labor's turbulent past, many
elements of past disputes are present in
the current strike. Members of USW
are faced with the familiar striker's
problem of having the work they are
leaving behind done by union members
who refuse to strike or by temporary
workers brought in by management.
"Scab," the union term for these
workers, is perhaps the harshest epithet

clerical worker and strike supporter
Victoria Baker.
Many of the people crossing union
lines in the current strike are students
who hold part-time jobs at such places
as the Faculty Club and Food Service.
Many of these students say they have
some sympathy for the strikers, but
they don't feel an obligation to express
that sympathy by walking off their jobs.
"We don't have a union to protect us
we'd just be Fired," said Kelly Black, a
co-terminal student in East Asian Stud
ies who works at the Faculty Club.
"People come in here every day looking
for jobs."
Black points out, too, that students'
wages will not be affected whether
the union is victorious or not.
Sara Rostane, a junior who was
hashing at Stern Hall during freshman
orientation, said, "I really don't think
of it as mattering that much to me."
Several of the student part-timers said
