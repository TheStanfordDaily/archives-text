# Union workers bitter toward temporary help
## 
### SETH ZUCKERMAN 
Although the current strike by the
United Stanford Workers (USW) has
been considerably calmer than violent
clashes of labor's turbulent past, many
elements of past disputes are present in
the current strike. Members of USW
are faced with the familiar striker's
problem of having the work they are
leaving behind done by union members
who refuse to strike or by temporary
workers brought in by management.
"Scab," the union term for these
workers, is perhaps the harshest epithet
in the union lexicon. Since the begin
nings of the labor movement, workers'
hostility has been directed most bitterly
not against management but against fel
low workers who have broken ranks
with them.
"It's the people that have a choice (to
work or not) that we're upset with,"
said Roth House Cook Bob Byerly, re
ferring to those union members who
choose to ignore the strike and continue
to work. "There's nothing worse a per

son can be" than a scab, according to
clerical worker and strike supporter
Victoria Baker.
Many of the people crossing union
lines in the current strike are students
who hold part-time jobs at such places
as the Faculty Club and Food Service.
Many of these students say they have
some sympathy for the strikers, but
they don't feel an obligation to express
that sympathy by walking off their jobs.
"We don't have a union to protect us
we'd just be Fired," said Kelly Black, a
co-terminal student in East Asian Stud
ies who works at the Faculty Club.
"People come in here every day looking
for jobs."
Black points out, too, that students'
wages will not be affected whether
the union is victorious or not.
Sara Rostane, a junior who was
hashing at Stern Hall during freshman
orientation, said, "I really don't think
of it as mattering that much to me."
Several of the student part-timers said
they did not understand why the
strike had been called.
Most of the students did not
feel they were harming the union
bv crossing picket lines, because
the strike was still disrupting the
University's services. "They're
still crippling the way the Univer
sity runs, which is what they in
tended," said Patsy White, a
sophomore at Stern Hall Food
Service. Added Black, "They
don't do any of the jobs I do, so I
don't feel guilty in that respect."
Union members staffing the
picket line outside the Faculty
Club were much more under
standing of the students' position
than of fellow workers who had
gone back to work. "Every stu
dent who has crossed the picket
line has been sympathetic to us,"
said Wayne Schaefer, a cook at
the club. "They're just not in
volved in it," he added.
Schaefer's comments about
the full-time club workers who
returned to their posts were much

more bitter: "They had some
cockamamie excuse for going
back to work," he said. "We're
all in the same boat. We all have
bills to pay, we're all falling be
hind. But we still won't get down
on our knees and grovel for a few
nickels and dimes."
One of the Faculty Club staf
fers who quit the union and went
back to her job would say only
that she had resigned from the
union for personal reasons. The
other could not be contacted.
Student staffers at the Faculty
Club said they had felt some
hostility from picketers when
they came to work during the
first few days of the strike. "They
said, 'What are you doing here?
Go home,' " Black said.
Student Tamara Millis, an
other Faculty Club employee,
added, "It's pretty bad because
we have to work with them when
they come back."
Other jobs are being filled by
people who are not union mem
bers or are hired through tem
porary employment agencies.
Most of these workers cite their
economic situations to explain

why they are working. One 21-
year-old Cupertino woman at
Stern Hall said, "To make the
money is the only reason I'm
doing it."
She said that not having this
job would pose no hardship for
her because she lives with her
family; she will use the $3.75 per
hour she is earning to paint and
fix her car and to pay a few bills,
she said.
Gordon Baker was hired at
Tresidder Recreation Center to
work on the bowling machines
just as the strike was starting. He
was appointed temporarily be
cause his predecessor quit, he
said, and as a temporary worker
he would not be eligible to join
the union. "I'm not doing a job
that someone out on strike would
be doing," he explained.
Everardo Magana washes
dishes and pots at Stern Hall
Food Service. Not a union mem
ber, Magana said through an in
terpreter, "This job is my sole
means of support. I have to sup
port mv family."
