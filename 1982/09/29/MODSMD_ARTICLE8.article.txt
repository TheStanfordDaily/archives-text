# Food at Flo Mo
## 
### JULIE KAUFMANN Senior staff writer 
University Food Service will open
the kitchen at Florence Moore Hall to
day, as restaurants and houses not af
fected by the 20-day-old strike of 850
United Stanford Workers brace for a
third day of large crowds of hungry stu
dents.
Two meal lines at Flo Mo and four at
Wilbur Hall will serve breakfast and
lunch on a cash-only basis from 7 a.m.
to 2 p.m., said Food Service Manager
Maxine Anderson.
Around campus, fraternities, self-ops
dnd co-ops joined forces to help feed
hungry dorm residents. Many houses
have opened their doors to 15 or 20
paying guests each night most from
freshman dorms.
Theta Chi voted Monday to have five
dinner guests every day, but Stanford's

smallest co-op won't take any money.
"They'll really be guests," said resident
Mark Adolph.
One resourceful Roble RA took 40
housemates to his fraternity backyard
for an impromptu barbeque, alfresco.
Some local restaurants welcomed the
extra business. "We had 70 people from
Serra in here last night," said Chris
Bott, Mountain Mike's assistant man
ager. They told Bott that until the strike
ends, they'll take advantage of his Mon
day night pizza special every week.
"It's been great for our store," said
McDonald's Marketing Representative
Steve Bravo of the strike. The Stanford
Shopping Center restaurant plans to
put extra people to work this week, he
added.
On campus, however, the Monday
dinner rush at the Coffee House lasted
too long for Manager Steve Weiss.
"From 6:30 to almost 10 the line was
out the door and we only had five peo
ple working," Weiss said. "I feel bad
because we can't do justice to our cus
tomers," he added.
The Coffee House crew filled about
50 dinner orders from one dorm Mon
day afternoon. "Others asked, but I had
to say no," he said.
Staffed mostly by students, the Cof
fee House is hiring and training new
employees as quickly as possible, he
said. "We'll have a full staff by Friday."
Inside Tresidder, the Union
Crossroads reported heavy crowds,
"but not as heavy as we expected," said
Tresidder Union Director Ellie Op
penheim. "1 think (students) are still
getting settled."
"I asked a couple of students what
they were doing about meals and they
said they weren't eating," Oppenheim
said. "1 encouraged them not to skip
too many meals."
Corner Pocket Manager Steve Fran
cis said business doubled or tripled
Monday, and that most people weren't
complaining about the 10-minute wait
for pizza orders. "Given tnat we're not
set up to handle this kind of business,
we're getting by," he said.
