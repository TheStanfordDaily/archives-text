## Emergency training, self awareness part of RA prep 
### KATHY CHRISTIE Staff writer 
The school year began early for the approx
imately 170 Resident Assistants here who
came to attend training workshops sponsored by
Residential Education.
"The purpose of RA training workshops is to
help people get to know each other and share
ideas," said Alice Supton, assistant dean of stu
dent affairs. She said RAs are "put in a situation
where will be established the network of support
they'll be using during the year." In addition, the
workshops serve to help RAs "prepare for and
anticipate" situations which may arise in the
dorm during the year.
Although some came as early as Sept. 14 to at
tend retreats with their own residence's staff, the
formal Res Ed training program began Sept. 19
with kickoff speeches bv Norman Robinson, as
sociate dean of residential education, James
Lyons, dean of student affairs, and President

Donald Kennedy.
While these speeches gave a broad outline for
what is expected of RAs, those that followed
were much more specific. On Monday the RAs
heard several more talks, including one by Rob
inson and Harvey Weinstein of Counseling and
Psychological Services (CAPS) about how to re
spond to emergencies.
CA PS also provided small groups of RAs with
case studies to evaluate. Cardenal RA Frank
Moreno especially enjoyed the case studies be
cause through them he was able to "learn about
how to help problems, how to talk to people."
He also thought that following the case studies
through on a week-to-week basis helped to make
them seem more realistic.
Tuesday brought with it both programming
planning tips and small group discussions on ev
erything from sexualitv to depression. These dis
cussions were led by, among others, resident fel
lows, people from Res Ed , and representatives
from the Rape Education Project.
The RAs spoken to found nearly all of the ses

sions valuable, but in particular several pointed
to one entitled "Unlearning Racist Attitudes
and encouraging Cross-Cultural Exchange"
taught bv Jim Cadena of Res Ed and Drama
Prof. Helen Schrader as exceptional. In this dis
cussion the group was divided into whites and
"people of color" and each participant discussed
the differences between his own self-perception,
his perception of those in the other group and his
feelings about how those in the other group per
ceived him. "It lasted an hour longer than it was
supposed to," said Mark Netherda, an Otero
RA. "People came away with a better idea of
how they felt about minority issues." Netherda's
view matched those of Naomi Hirahara, a
Cardenal RA, when she said that she learned
that "We do have negative stereotypes, but we
have to realize that they are there and go on
not to gloss over them or be idealistic."
RAs were also provided with printed materi
als about counseling, alcohol use, the fundamen
tal standard, academic advising and resources at
Stanford.
Even with all of this, RA training is still not
over: throughout the next few weeks there will be
more training sessions dealing with such topics
as programs, first aid and stress.
One complaint that several of the RAs spoken
to had was that some of the material presented
during the training sessions was redundant and
repetitive. "Most of this stuff that was covered at
the informational meetings were already cov
ered in the books," said Netherda. Eric
Wendlandt, a Madera RA, agreed, adding that
the Madera staff had already covered much of
the material at their staff retreat. Both also felt
that maybe the redundancy was planned so that
the material covered would be ingrained in
them.
Moreno summarized the feelings of many in
saying that the RA training helped him in
"building up confidence . . . and letting you
know you can do it and not take it so seriously."
"You realized that you were a person too,"
said Netherda, "and that there were people to
supprt you as an RA." He and Hirahara also
pointed to the contacts made with other RAs as
invaluable, not only for support but for planning
inter-dorm events.
As all-encompassing as it was, the training did
not prepare the RAs for the one problem most
are facing now after orientation: fatigue. As
Wendlandt said, "Lack ofsleepisthe major con
cern now."

'You realized that you were
a person too, and that there
were people to suport you
as an RA.'
