Alto LSAT Program"""*™ - " 1-111^^
LSAT and GRE Preparation
Courses start OCTOBER 9 for
December 4 LSAT and December 18 GRE
The Palo Alto LSAT Program offers intensive instruction, taught by a former Stanford faculty
member who is a Stanford J.D. and a practicing attorney, in all phases of the LSAT and the
GRE. Courses include 32-40 hours of classroom work, with copious test-taking homework
using ETS-calibre materials. Our classes meet an average of once a week — there will be
some doubling up during each course — for four hours, sometimes on weekends, and
sometimes on midweek evenings. Each course is based on carefully monitored incremental
learning: no tapes, no fancy office suites, and no long-distance franchise preparation of
materials. The LSAT course fee is $175; the GRE course fee is $200. Both courses taken
simultaneously cost $325 —recommended only for the superdisciplined person with substan
■ tial time availably.
Please do not inquire about either course unless you are a serious student of any age, willing
to sign a contract obliging you to perform assignments on time and able to spend six hours per
week outside of class working on this course.
Students who want to prepare for one of the exams but who cannot schedule a class may take
a tutorial, which will cover all aspects of each of these courses, for $350.
The Program especially welcomes those students who take their work seriously while
retaining a sense of humor. Look at what some of our past students have said about their
exam preparation (brush up on Western Culture if you miss the allusions):
Plato: "I ripped off a 99+ on the PKAT*. This Marquis de Sade: "These guys use whips and
program is pure gold." chains to make you work. I loved it."
Alexander the Great: "I learned right away I had Bushrod Washington: "A pity — I worked so hard
no aptitude for figures — don't tell Roxanna — an ? even 9°t to the Supreme Court. But people
and that I was aggressive, so I dropped plans for on 'y remember my brother George,
the Macedonian GSB and went to work on my Louis Brandeis: "I learned to be concise in this

Aquinas: "Helped me get deductive logic down Clarence Darrow: "Didn't learn a thing about law
