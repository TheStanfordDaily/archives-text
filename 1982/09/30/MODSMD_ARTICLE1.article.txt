Igestion has been a prob
.. :

lem at the University for the past few
years, according to Herrington. Not
only have there been "a number of acci
dents," but Herrington reports that he
has received a steady stream of com
plaints from faculty, students and vis
itors about the chaotic bicycle traffic
patterns. In past years, "there were peo
ple who refused to go out at class time,"
because of the danger, he said.
Obviously, a system is needed for
"some kind of rational traffic control,"
observes Mac Donald. The police de
partment has tried a variety of solutions
over the years — having officers patrol
the congested areas on foot, on bikes
and in cars and getting student volun
teers to ticket illegally parked bicycles
— but nothing has worked.
Herrington is also a member of the
Bicycle Safety Committee, which has
considered the possibility of creating
traffic lanes for several years. Finally,
last spring two members of the bicycle
committee from the planning office
conducted a traffic survey of the White
Plaza area.
The two planners, Mazenko and
Judy Chen, recruited both student and
staff members from the bicycle commit
tee to help with the study. For one
week, vehicle counters were posted at
10 locations where traffic could enter
and exit the survey area. From these
tallies, the planners identified the prob
lem areas, became familiar with the
traffic volume and patterns, and the ra
tio of pedestrians to bicyclists.
Using this data the planners de
veloped three solutions to the traffic
problem. The committee adopted the
present plan of signs and painted lanes,
and vetoed proposals for a roundabout
and blockades. The accepted plan had
to pass through several higher levels of
approval before it was implemented.
The budget for the entire project was
$7000, to cover the cost of paint, signs
and management work. The money
came from the Parking and Transporta
tion Fund.
The police department's enforcement
of the new system of lanes will take the
form of tickets for mopeds and motor
cycles, and "frequent reminders" for
disobedient bikers, according to Her
rington. He notes that the policemen
will be trying to educate the bicyclists
that the bicycle warnings may later have
to be replaced bv citations.
The matter of the student body's re
action to the lanes remains to be seen.
"I don't think that it'll be a big issue.
It's obvious that they're doing it to
help," said Amy Mar, a fifth-year elec
trical engineering student.
The biggest problem. Mar feels, is
not the width of the lanes, but the
"yield" signs. They seem to be, she
jokes, "just one more thing to run
into."
