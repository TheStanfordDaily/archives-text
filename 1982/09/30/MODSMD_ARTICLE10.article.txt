# New coalition begins, faces grim economy

Compiled from news reports and wire

Helmut Kohl, the 52-year
old Christian Democratic
leader who is expected to re
place current chancellor
Helmut Schmit, still faces a
plethora of economic prob
lems including high un
employment and the threat of
continued recession.
Though leaders of the new
coalition have yet to outline a
completed economic outlook,
indications are that the con
tent of Bonn's economic poli
cy will be more closely aligned
to conservative policies of
Britain and the United States.
The formation of a Chris
tian Democrat and Free Dem
ocrat coalition, considered as
signaling the shift in West
Germany's economic policy,
sparked a stock exchange ral
ly last Friday in the nation's
Commerzbank. A brief
respite from West Germany's
worst postwar recession, the
rally was one of the strongest
in recent years raising the
Commerzbank share index
7.7 points, to 704.9.
Speaking before the Ger
man parliament last Friday,
Kolh pledged the coalition's
committment to reducing,
"the unacceptable level of un
employment and reviving the
failing economy." According
to recent figures 7.4 percent or
1.7 million Germans are cur
rently unemployed while the
gross national product has al
tered little since the end of
1980.
Another dark spot on West
Germany's economic picture
has been the steady decrease
in the volume of industrial or
ders. Current indicators pre
dict a continued slump.
As the economy came to a
standstill, factions of the So
cial Democratic coalition
argued about how to reverse
the down trend. Such dis
agreement contributed to the
eventual split with the Free
Democrats and their subse
quent realignment with the
Christian Democrats. Social
Democrats calling for more
government spending to be fi

minced bv additional taxation
of upper-income groups met
with opposition from the Free
Democrats who had de
manded tax benefits for cor
porations and government in
vestments designed to boost
industry. The Free Democrats
hoped to finance the invest
ment by slashing welfare
spending.
The rift deepened as un
employment approached a
record 2 million. The FDPop
posed Chancellor Schmidt's
$700 million job-creating pro
gram and fought against in
creases in the West German
social security system, the an
nual cost of which has risen
markedly from $15 billion in
1960 to about $250 billion last
year. The program accounts
for 38 percent of all govern
ment spending.
The final break came dur
ing disputes between
Schmidt's Social Democrats
and the Free Democrats over
how to a cut a $100 billion ex
pected deficit in the proposed
1983 budget. Schmidt con
tinued his bid to tax the
wealthy while the FDP in
sisted on the social service
cuts.
The newly formed coalition
reached an agreement Tues
day on the issue which some
say ended Schmidt's 13-year
reign as chancellor. The eco
nomic policy plan calls for
cuts in public spending, an in
crease in the value-added
(sales) tax, from 13 percent to
14 percent starting next July,
and compulsory loans from
people in the higher income
brackets. Single persons earn
ing more than $20,000 a year
and married persons earning
more than $40,000 a year will
be required to make an in
terst-free loan to the state
equal to 5 percent of their tax
liability. The money would be
used in part to finance public
housing. The program also
calls for tax incentives for
businessmen and private
home builders.
