## Conservation measures on November ballot: bottles, water and Lake Tahoe 
### VICKI MOORE 
Three environmentally focused iniatives on
the November ballot will give California voters
.• a chance to choose the direction of the state's
/environmental policy over the next few years.
j Proposition 11 (the Can and Bottle Recycling
Initiative), Proposition 13 (the Water Re
sources Conservation and Efficiency Initiative),
• and Proposition 4, (the Tahoe Bond Act), are
all conservation referenda placed on the state
ballot by public advocacy groups striving to im
plement stricter conservation measures.
Bottle bills similar to Proposition 11 have
been introduced in every session of the Califor
nia legislature since 1975, but this year a state
- wide coalition called California for Recycling
• and Litter-Clean Up (CRLC) has presented its
• bill directly to the voter after collecting more
' than a half-million signatures in 99 days.
If passed, Proposition would:
• "require a five-cent deposit on beer and soft
• drink containers.
• "require stores to redeem emptv containers of
• • the brands they sell by requiring distributors to
r > pick up cans and bottles of a single brand.
'• "require that distributors pay one additional
> cent to retailers to reimburse the retailer for
- handling fee.
The pro-Proposition 11 forces claim that the
initiative will conserve energy and raw materi
als bv recycling, save the state government
money used for litter and landfill costs, greatly
«■' reduce litter, and even provide a net gain in em
•' plovment. The CI.RC backs up its claims with
studies concluding that refillable bottles use less
•' than half the energy of disposable bottles, and
• that recycling would reduce the demand for im
*'■ ported bauxite and aluminum ore, both of
-which are used in aluminum can manufac
* turing.
Matt Couzins, executive director of the
CRLC, states that Proposition II would save
•' the state of California money in garbage collec
tion and disposal as well as litter clean-up. Cali
fornians throw away 13,000 beverage con
tainers every minute, or about seven billion a
' year, said Couzins, making up almost a quarter
'■ of all litter bv volume and six percent of munici
-1 pal solid waste.
*' "Statewide bv 1987, over one-half of current
' Iv usable landfill space will be unusable," said
■ Couzins. Returnable cans and bottles would re
• ' duce the amount of solid waste, lowering waste
collection and disposal costs and reducing the
•' need for the rapidlv vanishing landfill space, ac
»' cording to the CRLC.
r 1 In Michigan, since a bottle bill went into ef
•' feet in 1979, taxpayers have saved over $15 mil
' lion in roadside clean-up costs per year, and the
bill reduced the need for additional solid waste
iandfills. In addition, in the six states where a
" bottle law has gone into effect, the California
"• League of Women Voters report that total litter
' volume has dropped 40 percent and over 90per
cent of beer and softdrink containers have been
" returned. v . .
Pro-Proposition 11 groups also claim-that the
_ _ bottle bill will create a net gain in jobs in retails
_ . stores, truck driving and recycling. The Michi
gan bottle bill created 4684 jobs, many more

than it eliminated, the CRLC says.
Members of the coalition against Proposition
11, called Californians for Sensible Laws, in
clude the California Chamber of Commerce
and the California AFL-CIO as well as grocery
chains, beverage industries and container man
ufacturers. They say that the initiative would
raise the price of beer and soft drinks, cause the
loss of container industry jobs, be a sanitation
problem for stores handling used containers,
and hurt the recycling industry and charitable
groups who bring in recyclable containers while
not significantly reducing litter.
Many beverage plants built in the age of
throw-away bottles don't have the machinery to

clean glass bottles. Members of Californians for
Sensible Laws claim that building or adding
new warehouses, changing production equip
ment, and buying new trucks will cost the
beverage industry extra money which would be
passed on to consumers.
Gilbert Moore, spokesman for Californians
for Sensible Laws, said that the bottle bill which
has been in effect in Michigan since 1979 has
caused a bootlegging problem with Michigan
residents crossing the state line into Indiana to
buy beer and soft drinks where they are less ex
pensive.
The CR LC's Couzins, however, disputes this
and points to a 1980 General Accounting Office
study which shows that the initial costs for re
tooling would be covered in about three years
and afterwards the beverage industry would
save money since refillable bottles are much less
expensive thai? pj«djjcin£ ,
Proposition 11 opponents also cite Michigan
as an exampld of a bottle bill state having sani
tation problems. They quote a 1980 Michigan
State report which found there were "serious

widespread cockroach and rodent problems in
stores directly related to the return of beverage
containers that contained foreign matter."
Moore asserted that only about 11 percent of
urban litter and 20 percent of rural litter con
sists of beverage containers, leaving the bulk of
litter to stay if Proposition 11 is passed.
"Sixty percent of aluminum cans are already
recycled in California," Moore continued,
"and charitable groups and the more than 900
recycling programs in California who make a
profit from recycling will not be hurt by the in
itiative. The total amount of recycling will not
be affected much, but rather there will be a shift
in who recycles."

In addition, Moore quoted a Chapman Col
lege Center for Economic Research study which
concludes that for every dollar in benefits Cali
fornians will receive from Proposition 11, they
would lose six dollars because of higher
beverage prices and the inconvenience of retur
ing deposit cans and bottles.
Similar bottle bills have passed in nine states
and are currently pending in 15 others. A Sep
tember 1982 Los Angeles Times poll showed the
Californians favoring the measure 61 to 32 per
cent. However, Moore said "the more people
know about Proposition 11, the more likely
they are to vote against it."

If passed. Proposition 13, the Water Re
source Conservation and Efficiency Act, would
affect every Californian who uses water.
, * that:
•those receiving water from a water project
rriust piiv their full proportionate phare of the
costs of developing and delivering that water
and attempt to minimize the use ot property

taxes to pay for these costs;
•large water users must develop and imple
ment cost-effective water conservation pro
gams before new sources of water are tapped;
•water may be appropriated for wildlife and
recreational, aesthetic, scientific, scenic and wa
ter quality uses. This gives greater legal footing
to environmental recreational, and commercial
fishing groups seeking to prevent parts of rivers
and streams from being diverted for irrigation,
flood control, and other purposes.
•water user applicants, whose proposed
projects may have an adverse impact on in
steam uses, must implement measures to offset
those impacts;

•special safeguards will be provided to re
strict the filling of the New Melones Reservoir
on the Stanislaus River until the project opera
tor has entered into contracts for at least 75 per
cent of the New Melones project yield;
•local groundwater management plans must
be adopted to avoid the water overdraft and wa
ter qualitv degredation;
•the 11 critical groundwater overdraft areas
must establish locally controlled groundwater
management authorities. In these regions —
most of them in the San Joaquin Valley — wells
are being pumped so dry that underground
basins have sunk or collapsed in about half of
the San Joaquin Valley, according to the
Western Water Education Foundation.
Farmers have historically been getting feder
ally subsidized water at prices must lower than
state water. Proposition 13 would push federal
water prices several times higher so that they
reach paritv with state prices by requiring
farmers to pav their proportionate costs of wa
ter development. Currently, residential proper
ty owners are paving property taxes to provide
water price subsidies for large corporate agri

cultural water users.
Since agriculture uses about 85 percent of all
available water in the state, Stanford Civil Engi
neering Prof. David Frevberg calls such water
pricing "irrational and economically un
sound." He stated that this section of the in
itiative provided a major economic incentive
for farmers to conserve water. Environmental
and fishing groups among others are aligned
with the California Water Resources Protection
Council supporting Proposition 13.
Jack King, spokesman for the California
Farm Bureau, said that Proposition 13 would
give the Water Resources Control Board, who
is given authority to construe the provision of
the initiative, too much authority at the state
level at the expense of local decision making.
"(Proposition 13) could mean that the state
could dictate which crops will be grown. For in
stance, cotton and alfalfa would be deemed as
not needed in California because they require
too much water," King said.
"We have the water we need in California; we
simply must give its allocation a prudent course
of direction," he continued. King also said that
cost incentives for water conservation are al
ready working in California.
Most of the agricultural sector, Southern
California water agencies, the league of Califor
nia Cities and the State Chamber of Commerce,
oppose it.

Proposition 4, The Tahoe Bond Act, is an at
tempt to prevent further environmental
degredation of Lake Tahoe. It provides $85 mil
lion to purchase 5000 environmentally sensitive
parcels of land around Lake Tahoe, on which
construction has been restricted. The funds will
be used to compensate property owners pre
cluded bv government regulation from building
on their land bv purchasing parcels from willing
sellers.
According to Californians for Responsible
Resource Management, erosion from highway
and building construction, logging and other
activities wash sediment and nutrients into the
lake. They state that erosion rates have in
creased 20-fold over natural levels and algae
growth has increased 100 percent during the
past 20 years.
The parcels affected are located in
streamzones and meadows, or one steep slopes,
on which construction would accelerate erosion
and send additional nutrients and sediments
into the Lake and stimulate the growth of algae.
Californians for Responsible Resource Man
agement back their case by referring to the
May, 1982 Tahoe Research Group study which
states that unless corrective action is taken,
Lake Tahoe's water will lose its transparency in
only 40 years.
Tom Roth of Californians for Responsible
Resource Management claims that Proposition
4 "will help the 7100 land owners vctimized by
previous government regulation whloh • pro
hibited them from building on their land."
Supporters of the initiative vary from the Cal
ifornia AFL-CIO to the California Taxpayers
Association to the Sierra Club.
