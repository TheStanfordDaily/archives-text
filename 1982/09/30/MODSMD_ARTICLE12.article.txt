## Joe Walder U.S. media minimize Israeli guilt

"The ambassador from the Bechtel
Group Incorporated, Philip Habib, has
returned from the shuttle flyways to re
ceive his due for brokering the Palestine
Liberation Organization pullout from
Beirut. A fter bowing his head to receive a
Medal of Honor from President Reagan,
Habib will look to Norway for the more
coveted Nobel Peace Prize. Republican
Senator Charles Percy has submitted
Habib's name to the Nobel Committee.
"And why not? If the committee could
wash the blood of Southeast Asia off
Henry Kissinger's hands in 1973, certain
ly it can award Habib the same prize for
umpiring the Israeli destruction of the
Lebanese capital on the president's
behalf." —commentary in The
Progressive. Oct. 1982
The massacre of hundreds of Palesti
nians in Beirut's squalid and bombed
out refugee camps might lead, one
would think, to a serious reappraisal of
Israel's goals in Lebanon, as well as of
the U.S. role in backing Israel. Analysis
and commentary on these matters seem
to be curiously lacking in the major
American media, however. This bit of
circumspection deserves some atten
tion.
Let's consider the current stream of
revelations about the activities of the Is
raeli Army and the Lebanese
Phalangists during the massacre. Israeli
forces surrounded the refugee camps,
with posts only hundreds of yards from
the camps dwellings. Phalangist troops
— and perhaps others, we will learn —
were allowed into the camps; recall that
the Phalange had staged a massacre in
another Palestinian refugee camp sever
al years ago, a fact well-known to the Is
raelis. Using their Israeli-supplied
arms, and with the darkness of night
broken by Israeli-launched flares, the
Phalangist troops proceeded to shoot
any living creatures they encountered,
often mutilating their victims.
The general tone of U.S. press
analysis of the massacre is typified by a
sub-headline in the San Francisco
Chronicle on the day the story broke:
"Israeli troops accused of just standing
by." Other interpretations, of course,
do suggest themselves. One might ques
tion whether Israel's active supplying to
the Phalange of arms, logistical sup
port, and access to the refugee camps is
adequately described as "just standing
by." There has also been a report in the
Christian Science Monitor, with sur
vivors in the camps and with foreign
medical personnel and Lebanese Army
officers who were neat the scene of the
massacre, that forces of renegade Ma
jor Saad Haddad took part in the
slaughter. Haddad's troops, based in
southern Lebanon, would have had to
somehow pass through many miles of
Israeli-occupied territory to reach
Beirut: not a bad feat. In this context, it
is interesting to note the description by

National Public Radio's correspondent
William Drummond of Haddad's Is
raeli-equipped troops as "totally inte
grated" into the Israeli command, "vir
tually a foreign regiment" of the Israeli
Army.
We also hear commentary from vari
ous quarters that the Israeli command
committed a "grave error" by giving
the Phalangists access to the camps for
purposes of rooting out "terrorists."
Perhaps there would have been no "er
ror" had onlv the targets of the
Phalangists' bullets been more clearly
designated, or had the Israeli Army
itself entered the camps. In anv case, the
Israeli/Phalangist assertion that the
camps housed thousands of "ter
rorists" has never been critically ex
amined. Palestinians in the camps have
long been a source of trouble to both
the Phalange and its Israeli patrons.

The massacre of
hundreds of
Palestinians in Beirut's
squalid and bombed-out
refugee camps might
lead, one would think, to
a serious reappraisal of
Israel's goals in
Lebanon, as well as of
the U.S. role in backing
Israel. Analysis and
commentary on these
matters seem to be
curiously lacking in the
American media,
however.

Labeling these people as "terrorists" —
or, for the American audience, "lef
tists" or "Communists" — is a conve
nient way to excuse their murder; after
all, who can sympathize with such semi
human scum? One man's terrorist is an
other's freedom fighter, but these com
plex possibilities are beyond the pale of
"responsible" debate in most U.S. me
dia.
It is instructive to consider the
manner in which atrocities similar to
those in Beirut, but occurring elsewhere
in the world, might be reported in the
U.S. press. Imagine, if you will, that the
Soviet-supplied and -trained Ethiopian
Army invaded neighboring Somalia
(this once actually happened), occupy
ing disputed territory and displacing
thousands of Somali refugees into
camps surrounded bv Ethiopian forces.
Suppose that local indigenous forces —
perhaps minority ethnic Ethiopians —

armed by Ethiopia were allowed to
enter the camps, nominally in search of
"terrorists," and then massacred the
Somali occupants. One wonders wheth
er the Ethiopian Army would be
chastised in the U.S. press for "just
standing by" and for its "grave error"
that led to the massacre, or whether re
sponsibility would be assigned to the
"brutal Marxist regime" ruling Ethio
pia. The reader mav draw his own con
clusions.
Another fantastic bit of reporting in
the U.S. media involves the latest dis
patch of U.S. Marines to Beirut as part
of a "peacekeeping force." As supposed
evidence of friction between the United
States and Israel, the United States was
reported to have delivered to Israel an
"ultimatum": namely, that the Marines
would not land until the Israeli Army
left West Beirut. Exactly why this
statement constitutes an ultimatum has
never been explained. What would have
been the dire consequences to Israel had
it stayed in West Beirut? Not the cost of
occupation — U.S. economic aid and
inflation at home pay for that. Not a
cutoff of U.S. arms shipments — the
Reagan administration long ago re
jected that idea.
In all likelihood, the U.S. "ul
timatum" and Israel's acceptance are
two sides of a political ploy intended to
manipulate U.S. public opinion, which
is no longer so overwhelmingly pro-Is
rael. By issuing the "ultimatum," the
administration appears to be "getting
tough" with a recalcitrant ally. By ac
cepting, the Israeli government appears
to be acting contrite and somewhat rea
sonable. We can expect U.S. public
opinion to then swing behind continued
Israeli occupation of southern Lebanon
and massive U.S. arms shipments to Is
rael, many of which are outright grants,
that is, paid for bv U.S. taxpayers; the
profits, of course, accrue to the arms
manufacturers regardless of who pays
the bill. The possibility that U.S *>olicy
in the Mideast is influenced by
pecuniary interests — particularly
those of weapons manufacturers — will
be rejected as irresponsible speculation
by "serious" scholars, however.
The single hope for positive change to
arise from the ashes of Beirut is the cur
rent turmoil in Israeli society regarding
the ultimate Israeli role in the
massacres. If the ensuing investigation
is truly complete and does not balk at
examining the underlying nature of Is
rael's policy towards Lebanon —
which, the diary of former Prime Min
ister Moshe Sharett shows, can only be
called annexationist — then perhaps a
rattled Israeli public will demand of its
government a sane, noninterventionist
foreign policy, something no U.S. ad
ministration would dream of asking of
its ally.
