## No matter what the context, Beirut massacre inexcusable 
### 
Editors Note: The following is a re
sponse to Robert Wesson's "Beirut
massacre must be seen in historical con
text" (Daily, Sept. 27).
Stanford massacre must
be seen in academic context.
A massacre of 500 people took place
at Stanford, a well-known American
university. The perpetrators of this act
are unknown as they were wearing
masks and helmets. At the scene of the
tragic event we interviewed Prof. R. Es
swan, a senior research fellow in
speculative ornithology at the Hoover
Institution. Wiping the lenses of his
binoculars, Prof. Esswan said that in his
opinion the mass media have become
"more and more the vultures of this
planet," instead of being "the exposers
of wrongdoing." Mr. I.E. Sharp, a visit
ing war correspondent, remarked,
"There is no length to which some peo
ple will go to get into those boxes,"
evidently referring to television sets.
Esswan said that he does not think
that racial tension had anything to do
with the massacre, adding that he
thinks both the perpetrators and vic
tims (but not the instigators) are of the
"same ethnic and cultural background

as birds of a feather." He said there
were indications the massacre had been
carried out by women and children pro
testing inequality.
Esswan denied reports that the vam
pire bats kept in the upper stories of his
research tower had anything to do with
the tragedy. He emphasized that re
search is being done on the aforesaid
mammals to determine how they ac
quire the clusters of eggs found in their
environs and how these night-flyers
maintain defensive aerial superiority.
"They are stationed there solely for ob
servation," he said. The distinguished
bird watcher said in grim conclusion
that higher education is "no defense
against losing one's head."
The local population and the public
in general are eagerly awaiting the re
sults of the autopsies to be conducted
by Surgeon General J. Ripper to de
termine the cause of the deaths. Ripper
is well known for his impartiality.
Meanwhile the pofice department has
issued a statement that a thorough in
vestigation is underway, but that the
outrage being expressed it out of place
as there is nothing new under the sun.
