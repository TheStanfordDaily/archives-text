## Taxation fuels spending growth 
### 
Taxing ourselves more to reach projected federal govern
ment spending levels is like using gasoline to put out a fire.
The recent tax increase, while reducing the projected fed
eral budget deficit from horrendous to merely large, does
nothing to correct the basic underlying pressures for more
and more spending.
Forces favoring spending have become so strong and are
so firmly imbedded in our behavior patterns that basic

There are several restraints that we
can adopt to control our federal
spending spree. One is a
constitutional amendment to force
future budgets to be in balance* The
main advantage of this scheme is to
require more than a simple majority
vote to create deficits. This solution
would at least provide some discipline
to control the compassionate (vote
getting) impulses of 435
representatives and 100 senators Who
all want to do maximum good for each
of us — and for their re-election.

changes in our system may be required. We have federal
budgetary problems because:
It's easier to spend than to tax. Our elected representatives
win their positions by promising to assist (to spend tax
payers' money for) carefully selected groups of constituents.
It took 186 years for our nation to reach a $100 billion
budget in 1962 and just nine more years to reach $200 billion.
We added subsequent $100 billions in four-, three-, two- and
one-vear periods.
Federal spending is out of control. Congress passes laws
which stipulate that certain people are "entitled" to certain
benefits if they meet certain criteria. No one knows what to
tal costs will be because the number applying for benefits, as
well as economic and other factors which determine actual
revenue and spending levels, cannot be accurately predicted.
The Fed can print money. The national government is the
only level which can print money to make up the deficit be
tween revenues and expenditures. Public borrowing to fi
nance the shortfall crowds out private capital needs and
pushes up interest rates. (Total federal borrowing in 1981
took three out of every four dollars saved in the U.S.)
The U.S. government lacks discipline. Twenty-one un
balanced budgets in 22 years is proof that our federal budg
etary system needs fundamental reform.

We now need more guns. Because of the Soviet military
buildup (15 percent of their annual gross product), we need
to increase our defense spending (to 7 percent of our GNP).
In order to accomodoate the three-year tax-cut programs,
non-defense spending needs to be frozen or reduced. v
The carrying charges on the national debt are skyrocketing.
Because of the $1 trillion national debt and high interest
rates, theannual interest alone is over $100 billion, or 15per
cent of the total budget. Without the debt burden, Our
budget would be in balance. .V
National debt ceiling legislation does not work. Every time
the debt level reaches the "ceiling" previously set by tTie
Congress, our elected representatives merely vote a higher
ceiling. The Congress just voted another large increase in the
national debt ceiling.
Our compassion is limitless. We want to help everybody in
need without regard to the resources available. Half of
year's budget involves spending for social programs. The re
sult is a channeling of resources toward the ailing auto in
dustry and unemployed steel workers rather than rewarding
success and providing incentives to get our economy back'on
the growth path.
Special interest groups are effective. The strength of lob
byists in favor of more spending exceeds the strength of the
anti-spending forces. Vested bureaucrats add considerable
strength to the pro-spending alliance of benefit-recipienis
and vote-seeking legislators.
Everybody's on the take. One out of every seven dollars »•
ceived by the average person represents a governm«flt
payment. The anti-spending forces are increasingly being
bought out by public largesse. In addition to the huge re
distribution of wealth from rich to poor, there is also ottbg
SISO billion in the budget which represents an upward m
distribution: federal playments to recipients who earn mtvii
than the poor average taxpayer!

There are several restraints that we can adopt to control

This solution would at least provide some discipline {to

representatives and 100 senators who all want to do max
imum good for each of us — and for their re-election.
A better long-term solution is President Reagan's "New
Federalism" proposal: transfer social entitlement programs
from the federal government to the state and local level.
Since local government cannot print money and run deficits;
we will either increase taxes or cut benefit levels to match
available revenues.
Another solution is to elect representatives who promise
to cut existing programs by an equivalent amount of any new
programs they propose.
The best course is probably to take any and all actions
which have any prospect of helping to develop the disciplines
which have so obviously atrophied over the past 15 years.

revenue and spending levels, cannot be accurately predicted.
The Fed can print money. The national government is the
only level which can print money to make up the deficit be
tween revenues and expenditures. Public borrowing to fi
nance the shortfall crowds out private capital needs and
pushes up interest rates. (Total federal borrowing in 1981
took three out of every four dollars saved in the U.S.)
The U.S. government lacks discipline. Twenty-one un
balanced budgets in 22 years is proof that our federal budg
etary system needs fundamental reform.

We now need more guns. Because of the Soviet military
buildup (15 percent of their annual gross product), we need
to increase our defense spending (to 7 percent of our GNP).
In order to accomodoate the three-year tax-cut programs,
non-defense spending needs to be frozen or reduced. v
The carrying charges on the national debt are skyrocketing.
Because of the $1 trillion national debt and high interest
rates, theannual interest alone is over $100 billion, or 15per
cent of the total budget. Without the debt burden, Our
budget would be in balance. .V
National debt ceiling legislation does not work. Every time
the debt level reaches the "ceiling" previously set by tTie
Congress, our elected representatives merely vote a higher
ceiling. The Congress just voted another large increase in the
national debt ceiling.
Our compassion is limitless. We want to help everybody in
need without regard to the resources available. Half of
year's budget involves spending for social programs. The re
sult is a channeling of resources toward the ailing auto in
dustry and unemployed steel workers rather than rewarding
success and providing incentives to get our economy back'on
the growth path.
Special interest groups are effective. The strength of lob
byists in favor of more spending exceeds the strength of the
anti-spending forces. Vested bureaucrats add considerable
strength to the pro-spending alliance of benefit-recipienis
and vote-seeking legislators.
Everybody's on the take. One out of every seven dollars »•
ceived by the average person represents a governm«flt
payment. The anti-spending forces are increasingly being
bought out by public largesse. In addition to the huge re
distribution of wealth from rich to poor, there is also ottbg
SISO billion in the budget which represents an upward m
distribution: federal playments to recipients who earn mtvii
than the poor average taxpayer!

There are several restraints that we can adopt to control
our federal spending spree. One is a constitutional amend
ment to force future budgets to be in balance. The main a(cf
vantage of this scheme is to require more than a simple nla
jority vote to create deficits.
This solution would at least provide some discipline {to
control the compassionate (vote-getting) impulses of 4-&
representatives and 100 senators who all want to do max
imum good for each of us — and for their re-election.
A better long-term solution is President Reagan's "New
Federalism" proposal: transfer social entitlement programs
from the federal government to the state and local level.
Since local government cannot print money and run deficits;
we will either increase taxes or cut benefit levels to match
available revenues.
Another solution is to elect representatives who promise
to cut existing programs by an equivalent amount of any new
programs they propose.
The best course is probably to take any and all actions
which have any prospect of helping to develop the disciplines
which have so obviously atrophied over the past 15 years.
