# Hopes pinned on button business
## 
### KATHY OLMSTED 
There's not a whole lot you can
do with a psychology major.
You can go on to graduate
school, you can become one of
the educated unemployed. Or
you might become the marketing
director of an up-and-coming un
usual button business. At least
that's what Jim Buser (Psych —
'73) did.
Buser recently bought into a
company that deals with with
creating and manufacturing
"consciousness raising" buttons
designed to shock and amuse just
about anyone.
"We have something to offend
everyone," Buser said.
Pithy slogans ranging from
"We'd be better off with Bonzo,"
"Being weird isn't enough," and
"Mv karma ran over my
dogma," decorate thfe buttons
which are marketed in 500 stores
in almost every state, Buser said.
As a buyer for a comic book
store in Palo Alto, Buser came
across the button catalogue of a
company named Ephemera. The
company had been founded by a
bytton salesman, Jeff Errick,
who expanded his sidewalk dis-
in the Haight-Ashbury dis

trict of San Francisco to encom
pass a national market. Errick
was later joined by another part
ner, and finally by Buser.
The company markets about
400 to 500 buttons, 200 of which
are listed in their catalogue. Ac
cording to Buser, the buttons are
sold wherever there's a "clientele
that's open-minded."

Buser recently bought

and manufacturing

raising * buttons.

The buttons retail for $1 and
wholesale for 50 cents — which
means a sizeable profit for the
button creators.
Thinking up the button
slogans is a collective enterprise,
Buser said.
"All three of us come up with
the button ideas," he said.
The group has no set pattern

on which ideas are selected for
manufacture, however.
"If we all like 'em (the button
ideas), we use 'em," Buser said.
But even if the three men are
divided on the potential funni
ness of the slogan, the company
might go ahead and test market
the button, Buser said.
The three originators come up
with the ideas by reading news
papers and keeping up on current
terms, Buser said. They will pay
$25 for each button idea they get
from outsiders, he said.
But keeping the company the
sole owner of the button slogans
is a tough task, according to
Buser.
Ephemera buttons have re
cently been on cover of Mother
Jones magazine and on the inside
pages of Time magazine, without
acknowledgement for the slogan
creators.
Buser said he didn't mind the
magazines' use of their ideas —
that it might in fact "translate
into better sales."
But he does mind other button
companies ripping off their ideas.
"There's a lot of bootlegging
going on," he said. "It's kind of
hard to copywrite a slogan."
