# Medical Center malpractice suit settled
## 
### KRISTEN CHRISTOPHER Senior staff writer 
In the largest reported U.S. medical
malpractice settlement, Stanford Univer
sity Hospital must pay for the lifetime sup
port of quadraplegic Anna Younger, an
expenditure that may exceed 5122 million
over several decades.
Hospital administrators, however, esti
mate the actual cost to SUH will be only
52.3 million.
Carole Price, an assistant hospital direc
tor, said the money will be generated from
interest on a 52.3 million annuity to be es
tablished with insurance funds.
The agreement, reached Sept. 17, calls
for lifetime care of the two-year-old
Younger, a quadraplegic resulting from
brain damage that occurred when her
heart and breathing stopped for several
minutes shortly after her birth. The suit
was filed by the child's mother, Jocelyn
Cunningham, against SUH, Dr. Joseph
Hopkins, Cunningham's physician, and
Hopkins' member-owned health care
firm, Mid-Peninsula Health Services, Inc.
Cunningham and her husband, Charles
Younger, claimed that Hopkins and a
nurse who remained with Anna and the
couple in the delivery room did not re
spond to Younger's requests that someone
examine the baby when she appeared to be
experiencing breathing difficulties.

Although the hospital does not have
records of Younger's requests for help and
denied allegations of negligence, Pamela
Stevens, a plaintiff attorney listed on the
case, said thev were fairly well
documented in Hopkins' records, and the
nurse who was present had some recollec
tion of them.
SUH, Hopkins, and Mid-Peninsula will
pay 51.2 million for Anna's current medi
cal expenses, personal and financial dam
ages to her parents, and plaintiff legal and
court costs, and vearly support payments
for the child will begin on Oct. I. This
vear's sum is $81,960, but a complicated
formula prescribes annual increases.
Surprisingly, the hospital's insurance
costs will most likely not increase because
of "reinsurance", according to Andy
Duncan, a broker for Farmer's Insurance,
one of SUH's primary insurers. He said
that insurance companies reinsure them
selves with other companies for
catastrophes, "so this type of settlement
should not.affect rates." With many insur
ance companies being affected, however,
there may be a very slight increase in insur
ance costs for doctors throughout the
state.
Thaddeus John Whalen, professor of
economics at the University of Santa
Clara, stated in a court document that the
settlement's present cash value is at least
$8.1 million. That Figure makes the agree

ment the largest of its type ever reported in
this country. However, Stevens said that
the San Francisco law firm she works for
handled a larger medical-malpractice set
tlement that had an agreement of no pub
licity.
The settlement does not damage the
hospital's reputation, Medical Center
Goodkind said, because the actual inci
dent happened two years ago, and"it was
just an unfortunate occurrence?
Anna apparently stopped breathing be
cause she was fatigued after Cun
ningham's stressful labor which lasted
from 9 p.m. on April 5, 1980 to 5 a.m. on
April 7, 1980. She was resuscitated after
Younger inquired if his daughter was still
living, and was then transferred to the in
tensive care nursery. A CAT scan done
there indicated that some brain tissue had
died as a result of oxygen deficiency.
While Anna is not able to use any of her
limbs, she may have normal intelligence.
Presently she knows several words and has
been taught to kiss.
Anna attends a school for handicapped
children in Gilroy and lives in Morgan
Hill with Pat Appleby, her foster mother.
Appleby is experienced in raising handi
capped children.
Cunningham and Younger lived in Los
Altos when Anna was born but now reside
in Cupertino with their 11-month-old son.
