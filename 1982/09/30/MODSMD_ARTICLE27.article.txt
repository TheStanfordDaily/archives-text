### CHRIS BUTCHKO Joe Jackson Night Day 
Joe Jackson is the music in
dustry's equivalent of strip-min
ing. Defining, say, Bruce Spring
steen, as intelligently planned
lumbering, whereby the material
is produced from an evolving and
regenerating — but basically
confined — source, or, say,
AC/DC as nuclear power, an
eternally stagnant, continually
decaying field that brings hor
rible, slow death to those exposed
to it, there is no other wavofclas
sifving Jackson's generic rapine.
Just as strip miners are forced
to leave an exhausted site, so has
Jackson wreaked havoc on the
musical stvles he has visited.
Look Sharp was a masterful pop
album, so well conceived that
even the rough edges seem
polished to a high gloss. Still,
having exhausted his affection
for pop music, he moved out of
the field, producing a complex
but immature album (I'm the
Man), with a title song that was a
thinly disguised mockery of the
suckers who followed fads —
even those who jumped on his
bandwagon.
I'm the Man was an attempt at
adult pop. Its ambition, as would
later become the case with Beat
Crazy, was its downfall. The
most superficial of the songs,
from the self-consciously dopey
"Kinda Kute." cynically sub
titled "A pop song," to the

satirically vitriolic "On Your Ra
dio," were the best-sounding. Se
rious songs, like "Geraldine and
John" and "Amateur Hour,"
were excruciatingly difficult to sit
through. It took an album and a
half, but Joe Jackson had finally
outgrown pop.
Not vet willing to break with
the whole tradition, he moved
into the nebulous area of rock
and roll, dragging along his ver
sion of reggae. "This is an at
tempt to make some sense out of
rock and roll," he wrote in the
liner notes. "Deep in our hearts
we knew it was doomed to fail
ure. The question remains: Why
did we trv?"
Why indeed? Jackson had no
great love or attachment for any
aspect of rock and roll, from his
role as rock star to the form itself,
clearly preferring reggae and the
big band sound, which became
his next haven.
About that time. Bob Geldof
of the Boomtown Rats, in his
time of glory and attention, pro
claimed that Joe Jackson's career
was over, and Bob blamed the
press for this. Jackson did little to
refute, following Beat Crazy,
which he later referred to as "the
album that time forgot," with Joe
Jackson's Jumping Jive, sort of an
English version of the Blues
Brothers. A cute concept, but
basically ridiculous and about as
marketable as an Elvis Costello
album of country music.
It was a fine way for Jackson to
sink from sight. A last defiant
thumbing of his nose at the music

biz, Jumping Jive would stand as
an odd tombstone for an eccen
tric pop star. I did not expect to
hear from him again.
Still, that was reckoning
without account for the wide
range of available stvles to play
with. Having burned his bridges
to pop. rock, reggae, and his au
dience, Jackson came out with
Night And Day — his finest
album, and one of the year's best.
A cunning production, this
album quietlv enters the fover of
your mind, then, as you turn your
back, skitters and clatters deep
into the half of vour memory un
til it finds some empty room,
where it encamps itself, refusing
to leave or lessen its demands
upon vou.
The arrangements are all of a
type, a sort of hybridization of
mambo, bossa nova, and salsa,
very nicely retaining Jackson's
trademark piano embellish
ments. Graham Maby, the only
carryover from the pop-rock
days, plavs much less often,
notes-per-song, than he used to
do, but plavs to much better ef
fect. He plavs backing patterns
here, rather than the carrying
leads of vore, and only occasion
ally breaks into small runs or
flourishes. It is the percussion
that stars here.
The beat is the heart of the
album; the complex, interweav
ing backbeats and the steady sup
port of the rhythms mold each of
the songs, giving the album con
tinuity but stopping just short of
fatal similarity. Melody is still
evident on Night and Day. but it
rests mostly in Jackson's singing
and the bass patterns.
Beyond the music, Jackson has
written his best lyric pieces. With
two exceptions — one

themuticaliy jolting, the other
probably a song too fun to ex
clude — all the songs are in the
first person, and none are written
just to some anonvmous "Baby"
from whom the singer wants
more love or reassurance. Jack
son is singing to a character with
more dimension than often
found in music.
In "Stepping Out," he sings of
being "so tired of all the darkness
in our lives, with no more angry
words to say." Nightlife has be
come his refuge, and, no matter

Joe Jackson mines hisown business

how damaged the relationship
may be, that night out is a release
from care, a chance to forget ev
erything and relax. In the taxi, his
date turns to him and smiles, the
song expressing a hope too
strongly felt to be denied.
Here is an interesting reversal
of the night and dav theme. The
album starts at "night," and that
bit of optimism about the night
out closes the side. On the day
side, however, the album ends
with "A Slow Song," which tells
of that hope betrayed. Here Jack
son and his date are strangers
meeting on the dance floor, look
ing for a comfort or release after
a hard dav. When she gets closer,
to touch his hand and whisper in
his ear, the spell ends — he can't
hear her over the music. Isolated
by their loneliness and buffeted
bv the music, their closeness
seems doomed, and Jackson
plangently pleads for a slow
song, for "just one more dance,
to leave here with an under
standing."
On this album Jackson's music
more expressive than ever
before, and the same is true of his
singing. It is almost galling to
speak of "conviction" and "sin
cerity" in reference to Joe Jack
son, but those are the only just
words here. On "Breaking Us In
Two" he sings of confusion, the
paradox of needing some room in

his relationship without sacri
ficing that relationship. "You
and I could never live alone, but
don't feel like breaking out just
one dav on vour own? Whv does
what I'm saving hurt vou — I
didn't sav that we were through
. . . " Trving to express a "rea
sonable" viewpoint, his voice
loses conviction through the song
and ends fearful, almost
pessimistic.
The two exceptions on this
album are "Cancer" and "TV
Age," the former a throwawav.

the latter a disturbance.
"Cancer" is written in the third
person, and hinges on the refrain
"Everything gives vou cancer"
intoned over a smooth, catchy
backing. "TV Age," however, is
more suited to Beat Crazy, just a

nasiv song about how much ev
ervone is ruled bv TV. Although
the music is interesting, the lyrics
are there just to set up a chance
for Jackson to voice-over and say
"The force has got a lot of power
— but what makes vou think it
gives a shit about vou? Who are
you, anvwav?" In such a well
crafted. moving album cheap
thrills are out of place.
As a whole. Night and Day is
excellent, ranging in subject mat
ter from the feeling of alienation

from humanity one feels in big
cities — "Chinatown" — to con
fused sexual roles — "Real Men"
— to the real dangers of just liv
ing — "Target." Unfortunately,
I personally like this album a
great deal, because Joe the Strip
miner has exhausted this lode.
There doesn't seem to be much
else he can do with his style
without losing freshness or in
spiration, and I dread another
Jumping Jive in his next gospel or
disco album. Yet, I've been badly
wrong before.

There doesn't seem to be much

wrong before.


Joe Jackson is the music in
dustry's equivalent of strip-min
ing. Defining, say, Bruce Spring
steen, as intelligently planned
lumbering, whereby the material
is produced from an evolving and
regenerating — but basically
confined — source, or, say,
AC/DC as nuclear power, an
eternally stagnant, continually
decaying field that brings hor
rible, slow death to those exposed
to it, there is no other wavofclas
sifving Jackson's generic rapine.
Just as strip miners are forced
to leave an exhausted site, so has
Jackson wreaked havoc on the
musical stvles he has visited.
Look Sharp was a masterful pop
album, so well conceived that
even the rough edges seem
polished to a high gloss. Still,
having exhausted his affection
for pop music, he moved out of
the field, producing a complex
but immature album (I'm the
Man), with a title song that was a
thinly disguised mockery of the
suckers who followed fads —
even those who jumped on his
bandwagon.
I'm the Man was an attempt at
adult pop. Its ambition, as would
later become the case with Beat
Crazy, was its downfall. The
most superficial of the songs,
from the self-consciously dopey
"Kinda Kute." cynically sub
titled "A pop song," to the

satirically vitriolic "On Your Ra
dio," were the best-sounding. Se
rious songs, like "Geraldine and
John" and "Amateur Hour,"
were excruciatingly difficult to sit
through. It took an album and a
half, but Joe Jackson had finally
outgrown pop.
Not vet willing to break with
the whole tradition, he moved
into the nebulous area of rock
and roll, dragging along his ver
sion of reggae. "This is an at
tempt to make some sense out of
rock and roll," he wrote in the
liner notes. "Deep in our hearts
we knew it was doomed to fail
ure. The question remains: Why
did we trv?"
Why indeed? Jackson had no
great love or attachment for any
aspect of rock and roll, from his
role as rock star to the form itself,
clearly preferring reggae and the
big band sound, which became
his next haven.
About that time. Bob Geldof
of the Boomtown Rats, in his
time of glory and attention, pro
claimed that Joe Jackson's career
was over, and Bob blamed the
press for this. Jackson did little to
refute, following Beat Crazy,
which he later referred to as "the
album that time forgot," with Joe
Jackson's Jumping Jive, sort of an
English version of the Blues
Brothers. A cute concept, but
basically ridiculous and about as
marketable as an Elvis Costello
album of country music.
It was a fine way for Jackson to
sink from sight. A last defiant
thumbing of his nose at the music

biz, Jumping Jive would stand as
an odd tombstone for an eccen
tric pop star. I did not expect to
hear from him again.
Still, that was reckoning
without account for the wide
range of available stvles to play
with. Having burned his bridges
to pop. rock, reggae, and his au
dience, Jackson came out with
Night And Day — his finest
album, and one of the year's best.
A cunning production, this
album quietlv enters the fover of
your mind, then, as you turn your
back, skitters and clatters deep
into the half of vour memory un
til it finds some empty room,
where it encamps itself, refusing
to leave or lessen its demands
upon vou.
The arrangements are all of a
type, a sort of hybridization of
mambo, bossa nova, and salsa,
very nicely retaining Jackson's
trademark piano embellish
ments. Graham Maby, the only
carryover from the pop-rock
days, plavs much less often,
notes-per-song, than he used to
do, but plavs to much better ef
fect. He plavs backing patterns
here, rather than the carrying
leads of vore, and only occasion
ally breaks into small runs or
flourishes. It is the percussion
that stars here.
The beat is the heart of the
album; the complex, interweav
ing backbeats and the steady sup
port of the rhythms mold each of
the songs, giving the album con
tinuity but stopping just short of
fatal similarity. Melody is still
evident on Night and Day. but it
rests mostly in Jackson's singing
and the bass patterns.
Beyond the music, Jackson has
written his best lyric pieces. With
two exceptions — one

themuticaliy jolting, the other
probably a song too fun to ex
clude — all the songs are in the
first person, and none are written
just to some anonvmous "Baby"
from whom the singer wants
more love or reassurance. Jack
son is singing to a character with
more dimension than often
found in music.
In "Stepping Out," he sings of
being "so tired of all the darkness
in our lives, with no more angry
words to say." Nightlife has be
come his refuge, and, no matter

Joe Jackson mines hisown business

how damaged the relationship
may be, that night out is a release
from care, a chance to forget ev
erything and relax. In the taxi, his
date turns to him and smiles, the
song expressing a hope too
strongly felt to be denied.
Here is an interesting reversal
of the night and dav theme. The
album starts at "night," and that
bit of optimism about the night
out closes the side. On the day
side, however, the album ends
with "A Slow Song," which tells
of that hope betrayed. Here Jack
son and his date are strangers
meeting on the dance floor, look
ing for a comfort or release after
a hard dav. When she gets closer,
to touch his hand and whisper in
his ear, the spell ends — he can't
hear her over the music. Isolated
by their loneliness and buffeted
bv the music, their closeness
seems doomed, and Jackson
plangently pleads for a slow
song, for "just one more dance,
to leave here with an under
standing."
On this album Jackson's music
more expressive than ever
before, and the same is true of his
singing. It is almost galling to
speak of "conviction" and "sin
cerity" in reference to Joe Jack
son, but those are the only just
words here. On "Breaking Us In
Two" he sings of confusion, the
paradox of needing some room in

his relationship without sacri
ficing that relationship. "You
and I could never live alone, but
don't feel like breaking out just
one dav on vour own? Whv does
what I'm saving hurt vou — I
didn't sav that we were through
. . . " Trving to express a "rea
sonable" viewpoint, his voice
loses conviction through the song
and ends fearful, almost

album are "Cancer" and "TV
