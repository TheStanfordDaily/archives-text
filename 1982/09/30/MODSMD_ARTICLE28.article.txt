# Aging American style
## 
### MARC FAJER 
Aging is a carefully avoided subject
in our society. American culture, with
its emphasis on youth, vigor and com
petition, leaves little room for those
who are unlucky enough to finish their
games before they finish their lives. D.
L. Cobum's Pulitzer Prize-winning
play, The Gin Game, examines aging in
the context of winning and losing, and
brings up disturbing questions about
the manner in which Americans treat
their senior citizens. The American
Conservatory Theatre's production,
which opened Tuesday night at the
Gearv Theatre in San Francisco, does
an excellent job of raising these ques
tions and provides an entertaining and
moving evening of theatre.
ACT opens its 1982-83 season with
major financial problems. The acting
company has been cut back and there
will be just eight plays produced, each
smaller in scale than those presented in
the past. The consequences of the mon
ey crunch are immediately obvious
upon entering the theatre. The set is not
the imposing, stage-filled edifice that
has been the trademark of so many
ACT productions. Instead, the sun
porch of the home for the aged which
constitutes the setting of the play is rep
resented by a relatively small unit at the
very front of the stage. Because of this,
the focus of the show is squarely on the
actors. Director James Edmondson
takes advantage of this by using two
ACT veterans in a fine production in
which the many very funny moments
are carefully balanced with the poign
ant revelations about the characters
and their lives.

William Paterson and Marrian
Walters are superb as Weller and
Fonsia, two seniors who have to cope
with loneliness, age and the luck of the
cards. Paterson plays an obstreperous,
foul-mouthed, retired businessman
who teaches Walters the "accepted

way" to plav gin. She proceeds to
arouse his wrath by winning every game
they plav.
Fonsia is a former apartment man
ager. She has come to the home for
"constant care" and, as Weller points

wonderful as the rigid, somewhat self
righteous woman, especially since
Fonsia is very different from the over
bearing harridans she often portrays. A
series of small quirks enliven her per
formance to create a verv memorable
character. She crunches snacks loudly,
and intermittently hums to herself as
she somewhat sheepishly wins game af
ter game. At one point, she puts a card
in her mouth as she sorts her hand and
spends a confused minute trying to lo
cate it again. She quickly gains the af
fection of the audience, and when she
has a dizzv spell late in the second scene,
tension breaks through the laughter for
the first time as we wonder if she is all
right and are reminded of the frailty of
the body that houses her still strong
mind.
Weller is, in many ways, a less sympa
thetic character. He has been pushed
out of his business and has lost his re
maining wealth because he "made the
mistake of getting sick" and after he
paid his bills "made the mistake of get
ting well." He can be nasty and
sarcastic and his apoplectic fury at los
ing is frightening and disarming, dis
playing a violence that appears unseem
ly in an older man. Paterson's per
formance is not without its touching
moments, however. Toward the end of
the show, after bullying Fonsia into
confessing lies that she has made, he
stands watching her cry in the growing
cold of the evening. He removes his
sweater and offers it to her. When she
does not look up, he gently places it on
her shoulders. This seems to show the
sort of person he might be if the game
were not going against him. He plays
cards because, in his words, "what the

out, because "you do have to go some
where." She is frustrated, as is he, be
cause she is more mobile and cognizant
than most of the people in the home,
and because she does not receive vis
itors. She needs "constant care" less
than occasional attention. Walters is

hell else is there to do?" Despite the rec
ognition of this, he becomes incensed
when the children of one of the other
residents use him as an example: "That
nice man amuses himself playing
cards."
The game itself (which certainly does
not "amuse" him) brings up an impor
tant discussion of luck and skill. Weller
starts out bv stating that luck is certain
ly not the onlv factor in gin, yet he is not
willing to attribute Fonsia's victories to
any ability on her part. He insists some
"force" is at work. They argue about
whether the various disappointments
thev have experienced are due to bad
luck or their own weaknesses. At this
point in their lives, however, luck and
skills are perhaps irrelevant, for there is
a "force" at work upon them.
Fonsiu eventually begins to match
Weller's intensity while playing, and he
remarks that she is getting tough. She
replies that she is not tough, "just
tired." Resignation to the vagaries of
the game have set in. His frustration
with losing again and again is an ex
tension of his frustration with the "ac
cepted way" to play in our culture. He
has been forced to sit out and watch at
the end of the game. These feelings of
resignation and frustration, and the rec
ognition that somehow every hand
from now on will be a loser make The
Gin Game a moving piece of theatre.
The show plavs through October 28,
and if it is representative of what a
scaled down ACT has to offer, this
should be a good season for them de
spite their financial difficulties. For thd'
fine performances, and for the in
telligent consideration of the problems
of the elderly in America, this produc

sweater and offers it to her. When she
does not look up, he gently places it on
her shoulders. This seems to show the
sort of person he might be if the game
were not going against him. He plays
cards because, in his words, "what the

out, because "you do have to go some
where." She is frustrated, as is he, be
cause she is more mobile and cognizant
than most of the people in the home,
and because she does not receive vis
itors. She needs "constant care" less
than occasional attention. Walters is

hell else is there to do?" Despite the rec
ognition of this, he becomes incensed
when the children of one of the other
residents use him as an example: "That
nice man amuses himself playing
cards."
The game itself (which certainly does
not "amuse" him) brings up an impor
tant discussion of luck and skill. Weller
starts out bv stating that luck is certain
ly not the onlv factor in gin, yet he is not
willing to attribute Fonsia's victories to
any ability on her part. He insists some
"force" is at work. They argue about
whether the various disappointments
thev have experienced are due to bad
luck or their own weaknesses. At this
point in their lives, however, luck and
skills are perhaps irrelevant, for there is
a "force" at work upon them.
Fonsiu eventually begins to match
Weller's intensity while playing, and he
remarks that she is getting tough. She
replies that she is not tough, "just
tired." Resignation to the vagaries of
the game have set in. His frustration
with losing again and again is an ex
tension of his frustration with the "ac
cepted way" to play in our culture. He
has been forced to sit out and watch at
the end of the game. These feelings of
resignation and frustration, and the rec
ognition that somehow every hand
from now on will be a loser make The
Gin Game a moving piece of theatre.
The show plavs through October 28,
and if it is representative of what a
scaled down ACT has to offer, this
should be a good season for them de
spite their financial difficulties. For thd'
fine performances, and for the in
telligent consideration of the problems
of the elderly in America, this produc
tion is worth seeing.

Aging is a carefully avoided subject
in our society. American culture, with
its emphasis on youth, vigor and com
petition, leaves little room for those
who are unlucky enough to finish their
games before they finish their lives. D.
L. Cobum's Pulitzer Prize-winning
play, The Gin Game, examines aging in
the context of winning and losing, and
brings up disturbing questions about
the manner in which Americans treat
their senior citizens. The American
Conservatory Theatre's production,
which opened Tuesday night at the
Gearv Theatre in San Francisco, does
an excellent job of raising these ques
tions and provides an entertaining and
moving evening of theatre.
ACT opens its 1982-83 season with
major financial problems. The acting
company has been cut back and there
will be just eight plays produced, each
smaller in scale than those presented in
the past. The consequences of the mon
ey crunch are immediately obvious
upon entering the theatre. The set is not
the imposing, stage-filled edifice that
has been the trademark of so many
ACT productions. Instead, the sun
porch of the home for the aged which
constitutes the setting of the play is rep
resented by a relatively small unit at the
very front of the stage. Because of this,
the focus of the show is squarely on the
actors. Director James Edmondson
takes advantage of this by using two
ACT veterans in a fine production in
which the many very funny moments
are carefully balanced with the poign
ant revelations about the characters
and their lives.

William Paterson and Marrian
Walters are superb as Weller and
Fonsia, two seniors who have to cope
with loneliness, age and the luck of the
cards. Paterson plays an obstreperous,
foul-mouthed, retired businessman
who teaches Walters the "accepted

way" to plav gin. She proceeds to
arouse his wrath by winning every game
they plav.
Fonsia is a former apartment man
ager. She has come to the home for
"constant care" and, as Weller points

wonderful as the rigid, somewhat self
righteous woman, especially since
Fonsia is very different from the over
bearing harridans she often portrays. A
series of small quirks enliven her per
formance to create a verv memorable
character. She crunches snacks loudly,
and intermittently hums to herself as
she somewhat sheepishly wins game af
ter game. At one point, she puts a card
in her mouth as she sorts her hand and
spends a confused minute trying to lo
cate it again. She quickly gains the af
fection of the audience, and when she
has a dizzv spell late in the second scene,
tension breaks through the laughter for
the first time as we wonder if she is all
right and are reminded of the frailty of
the body that houses her still strong
mind.
Weller is, in many ways, a less sympa
thetic character. He has been pushed
out of his business and has lost his re
maining wealth because he "made the
mistake of getting sick" and after he
paid his bills "made the mistake of get
ting well." He can be nasty and
sarcastic and his apoplectic fury at los
ing is frightening and disarming, dis
playing a violence that appears unseem
ly in an older man. Paterson's per
formance is not without its touching
moments, however. Toward the end of
the show, after bullying Fonsia into
confessing lies that she has made, he
stands watching her cry in the growing
cold of the evening. He removes his
sweater and offers it to her. When she
does not look up, he gently places it on
her shoulders. This seems to show the
sort of person he might be if the game
were not going against him. He plays
cards because, in his words, "what the

out, because "you do have to go some
where." She is frustrated, as is he, be
cause she is more mobile and cognizant
