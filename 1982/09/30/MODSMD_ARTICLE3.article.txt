jet crash kills 10
l Luxembourg — A Soviet jetliner with 77 people aboard skidded off a run
lay at Luxembourg's airport yesterday, crashed into a grove of trees and
urst into flames. Police said as many as 10 people were killed and the others
jiffered burns and fractures.
Witnesses said the Aeroflot Ilyushin 62 suddenly veered to the right, shot
Ato the woods and caught fire.
SjMc Spokesman said the cause of the crash was not immediately de-
Jplined end that casualty tolls were being revised as searchers combed the
foods for victims of the crash, which occurred at 8:23 p.m. (12:23 p.m.
Police initially told reporters at the scene that 53
people died and that 24 were injured. The figure
was altered after survivors, including the pilot,
were taken to hospitals.
He said a precise count would not be possible
until the Soviet Embassy in Luxembourg provided
a passenger list and the number of injured in sever
al hospitals was compared to the list.
Manv of the injured suffered severe burns and
were taken to a burn center in Metz, France, 37
miles to the south. The other survivors were taken
to five hospitals in the city.
Passengers scrambled out of the burning jet as a
series of explosions rocked it and flames engulfed
the fuselage, witnesses said.
Officials said those on board were from several
countries, but did not provide details.
"We heard an extremely loud engine noise that
lasted for a few seconds," said a man w ho lives next
to Kindel Airport.
"Then there was silence," he said, followed by a
series of explosions that continued for about 20
minutes.
Airport officials said the aircraft landed at 8:23
p.m. (4:23 p.m. EDT), and appeared to have made
a proper landing until it suddenly turned to the
right and skidded about 1000 yards.
It shot over a small pond and plunged into some
woods, knocking down trees for about 100 yards
before it came to a halt at the end of a small valley,
according to airport officials and television re
ports. The explosions followed and the plane
caught fire.
About 250 members of emergency medical and
rescue teams were at the scene. The Soviet am
bassador and other embassy personnel also were at
the airport.
Rescue workers brought powerful lights to the
scene of the crash and called out for survivors in
several languages, including Russian.
House defeats 'embarrassing' bill
Washington — The Reagan administration
staved off a potentially embarrassing foreign poli
cy setback vesterday when the House narrowly de

leated a bill to repeal economic sanctions against
the Soviet Union's natural gas pipeline to Western
Kurope.
The 206-to-203 vote, however, was indicative of
widespread congressional dissatisfaction about
sanctions imposed by President Reagan after im
position of martial law in Poland. The sanctions
forbid export of equipment for the pipeline bv U .S.
companies or European companies using U.S.
technology.
The timing of the vote contributed in part to its
defeat. Secretary of State George Shult* is engaged
in delicate negotiations in New York City this
week with foreign ministers of Western European
countries that have defied the sanctions.
In a splintering of Republican unity. House
(i()P leader Robert Michel, whose Peoria, 111., dis
trict has been hurt by the export embargo, led the
light to repeal the sanctions.
Hquallv unusual was the fact that the Democrat
ic leader. Speaker Thomas "Tip" O'Neill (D-
Mass.) relaved in a speech Shultz's argument that
the bill would embarrass the administration.
Michel's bill, which would have lifted the sanc
tions, was replaced on the 206-to-203 vote by a sub
stitute sponsored bv William Broomfield (Mich.)
ranking Republican on the Foreign Affairs Com
mittee.
Broomfield's bill cancels the sanctions after 90
davs, "providing the president certifies to Con
gress that the Soviet Union is not employing . . .
forced labor" in constructing the pipeline.
Deukmejian, Bradley debate
Sacramento — Gubernatorial candidates
George Deukmejian and Tom Bradley attacked
what thev called each other's "distortions" in their
first face-to-face debate last night.
Republican Deukmejian, the state attorney gen
eral. objected vociferously to Bradley commercials
linking Deukmejian with Watergate, calling it an
"unconscionable" attempt to smear him.
"Watergate means corruption. I think that is
despicable . . . That is the grossest violation" of
campaign ethics, Deukmejian said during the
hour-long debate.

Bradlcv, the Democratic major of Los Angeles,
castigated his opponent in turn for what he culled
distortions of Bradlev's farm record and Deu
kmejian's opposition to higher taxes.
" The lact is that one candidate, at least, is going
to put words in inv mouth . . . (and) engage in the
kind ol" distortions we have seen for many years in
politics," Bradlev said.
Neither candidate committed a major blunder
or scored a political knockout in the debate. But
Bradlev was the more aggressive debater, putting
Dcukmcjian on the defensive by contrasting Deu
kmejian commercials portraying himself as a tax
cutterwith Deukcmjian'sauthorshipofaSl billion
state tax increase in 1%7.
The debate, broadcast statewide bv 12 Califor
nia public television stations and one commercial
station, was the first of two sponsored by the
League of Women Voters. The second is scheduled
Oct. 26. The two also plan a joint television ap
pearance Sunday in Los Angeles.
Deukmejian scored his most effective points
voicing outrage to Bradley*s "Watergate" com
mercial, which Bradley never fully explained.
Bradlev defended his new Watergate com
mercial, saving Watergate was "a series of events
that so turned off people" and he wanted to "seek
some means of elevating this campaign so as not to
further plant in the minds of people that this is just
another political campaign."

jet crash kills 10
l Luxembourg — A Soviet jetliner with 77 people aboard skidded off a run
lay at Luxembourg's airport yesterday, crashed into a grove of trees and
urst into flames. Police said as many as 10 people were killed and the others
jiffered burns and fractures.
Witnesses said the Aeroflot Ilyushin 62 suddenly veered to the right, shot
Ato the woods and caught fire.
SjMc Spokesman said the cause of the crash was not immediately de-
Jplined end that casualty tolls were being revised as searchers combed the
foods for victims of the crash, which occurred at 8:23 p.m. (12:23 p.m.
Police initially told reporters at the scene that 53
people died and that 24 were injured. The figure
was altered after survivors, including the pilot,
were taken to hospitals.
He said a precise count would not be possible
until the Soviet Embassy in Luxembourg provided
a passenger list and the number of injured in sever
al hospitals was compared to the list.
Manv of the injured suffered severe burns and
were taken to a burn center in Metz, France, 37
miles to the south. The other survivors were taken
to five hospitals in the city.
Passengers scrambled out of the burning jet as a
series of explosions rocked it and flames engulfed
the fuselage, witnesses said.
Officials said those on board were from several
countries, but did not provide details.
"We heard an extremely loud engine noise that
lasted for a few seconds," said a man w ho lives next
to Kindel Airport.
"Then there was silence," he said, followed by a
series of explosions that continued for about 20
minutes.
Airport officials said the aircraft landed at 8:23
p.m. (4:23 p.m. EDT), and appeared to have made
a proper landing until it suddenly turned to the
right and skidded about 1000 yards.
It shot over a small pond and plunged into some
woods, knocking down trees for about 100 yards
before it came to a halt at the end of a small valley,
according to airport officials and television re
ports. The explosions followed and the plane
caught fire.
About 250 members of emergency medical and
rescue teams were at the scene. The Soviet am
bassador and other embassy personnel also were at
the airport.
Rescue workers brought powerful lights to the
scene of the crash and called out for survivors in
several languages, including Russian.
House defeats 'embarrassing' bill
Washington — The Reagan administration
staved off a potentially embarrassing foreign poli
cy setback vesterday when the House narrowly de

leated a bill to repeal economic sanctions against
the Soviet Union's natural gas pipeline to Western
Kurope.
The 206-to-203 vote, however, was indicative of
widespread congressional dissatisfaction about
sanctions imposed by President Reagan after im
position of martial law in Poland. The sanctions
forbid export of equipment for the pipeline bv U .S.
companies or European companies using U.S.
technology.
The timing of the vote contributed in part to its
defeat. Secretary of State George Shult* is engaged
in delicate negotiations in New York City this
week with foreign ministers of Western European
countries that have defied the sanctions.
In a splintering of Republican unity. House
(i()P leader Robert Michel, whose Peoria, 111., dis
trict has been hurt by the export embargo, led the
light to repeal the sanctions.
Hquallv unusual was the fact that the Democrat
ic leader. Speaker Thomas "Tip" O'Neill (D-
Mass.) relaved in a speech Shultz's argument that
the bill would embarrass the administration.
Michel's bill, which would have lifted the sanc
tions, was replaced on the 206-to-203 vote by a sub
stitute sponsored bv William Broomfield (Mich.)
ranking Republican on the Foreign Affairs Com
mittee.
Broomfield's bill cancels the sanctions after 90
davs, "providing the president certifies to Con
gress that the Soviet Union is not employing . . .
forced labor" in constructing the pipeline.
Deukmejian, Bradley debate
Sacramento — Gubernatorial candidates
George Deukmejian and Tom Bradley attacked
what thev called each other's "distortions" in their
first face-to-face debate last night.
Republican Deukmejian, the state attorney gen
eral. objected vociferously to Bradley commercials
linking Deukmejian with Watergate, calling it an
"unconscionable" attempt to smear him.
"Watergate means corruption. I think that is
despicable . . . That is the grossest violation" of
campaign ethics, Deukmejian said during the
hour-long debate.

Bradlcv, the Democratic major of Los Angeles,
castigated his opponent in turn for what he culled
distortions of Bradlev's farm record and Deu
kmejian's opposition to higher taxes.
" The lact is that one candidate, at least, is going
to put words in inv mouth . . . (and) engage in the
kind ol" distortions we have seen for many years in
politics," Bradlev said.
Neither candidate committed a major blunder
or scored a political knockout in the debate. But
Bradlev was the more aggressive debater, putting
Dcukmcjian on the defensive by contrasting Deu
kmejian commercials portraying himself as a tax
cutterwith Deukcmjian'sauthorshipofaSl billion
state tax increase in 1%7.
The debate, broadcast statewide bv 12 Califor
nia public television stations and one commercial
station, was the first of two sponsored by the
League of Women Voters. The second is scheduled
Oct. 26. The two also plan a joint television ap
pearance Sunday in Los Angeles.
Deukmejian scored his most effective points
voicing outrage to Bradley*s "Watergate" com
mercial, which Bradley never fully explained.
Bradlev defended his new Watergate com
mercial, saving Watergate was "a series of events
that so turned off people" and he wanted to "seek
some means of elevating this campaign so as not to
further plant in the minds of people that this is just
another political campaign."
