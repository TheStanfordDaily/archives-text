# Deadlock prompts meetings in SF today
## 
### DAVID AZRIN Senior staff writer 
The heads of the University and
United Stanford Workers negotiating
teams are scheduled to meet in San
Fransisco today with two federal medi
ators after a meeting between the full
negotiating teams yesterday proved un
productive.
Priscilla Wheeler, head of the Uni
versity negotiating team, and Michael
Baratz, executive secretary of USW,
met with mediators yesterday for about
one-half hour after the hour-long meet
ing between the negotiating teams was
called off by the two federal mediators.
Baratz, head of the union negotiating
team, said he and Wheeler were asked
bv federal mediators to meet alone in
the hope that "in that format we'll be
able to get some communications
going."
Baratz said the face-to-face meetings
with Wheeler were off the record, at

the request of the federal mediators.
Neither side presented any new pro
posals in the meeting between the full
negotiating teams and no progress was
made towards ending the 21-day-old
strike.
"We just went over old ground and
rehashed old stories," said Anne
Schlagenhaft, a member of the union
negotiating team.
The negotiations between the full ne
gotiating teams were called off, accord
ing to Schlagenhaft, because "we had
talked about everything there was to
talk about. Neither side had anvthing
more to sav."
Both sides have charged the other
with being "inflexible." The University
has continued to stick by its Sept. 7 pro
posal, describing this as their "best and
last offer." The University's proposal
would give workers a 14.5 to 17 percent

nedy's office. Others took their protest to Kennedy's lawn where they
staged an all-night vigil.

union's Sept. 17 proposal of 24.1 per
cent two-year wage and benefit in
crease.
"We've recognized that we could im
prove our competitive position in the
market at the maximum ranges and
we've made some proposals to do that,"
said John Schwartz, a member of the
University negotiating team and Uni
versity counsel, referring to the Univer
sity's Sept. 7 proposal.
The union claims that the University
forced the workers on strike in order to
bust the union.
"We're dealing with people with an
incredible amount of arrogance,"
Baratz said last night in a forum spon
sored bv the Stanford Progressive Al
liance (SPA).
"Nine hundred people have left their
jobs, their livelihood, their homes and
their families. Some are working during
the dav and helping out with the strike
at night, all to demonstrate how they
feel and the University does not feel
that that's important enough."
"That's about as cold and cruel a
position I could imagine anybody
would ever be put in," said Baratz. He
added that he has no idea when the
strike will end.
"It's hard to end the strike when they
keep telling us that they've given us the

last proposal and whv don't we just go
hack and vote on it again."
University officials declined an in
vitation to attend last night's forum, be
cause, according to SPA member Larry
Ausubel. they felt "a debate of the is
sues is very difficult."
"Michael Baratz will give you a pres
entation on the union's position which
he is willing to publicly defend," sa'id
Ausubel. chiding the University for not
attending the forum.
The union voted 465-172 to strike pn
Sept. 8 after the University presented jts
latest proposal.
Meanwhile, about 50 University
food-service and Tresidder Memorial
Union workers marched in front of the
Office of the President and around cam

banging them on the pavement.
Organizers of the march had in
