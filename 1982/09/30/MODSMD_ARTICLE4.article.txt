# Deadlock prompts meetings in SF today

### DAVID AZRIN Senior staff writer 
The heads of the University and
United Stanford Workers negotiating
teams are scheduled to meet in San
Fransisco today with two federal medi
ators after a meeting between the full
negotiating teams yesterday proved un
productive.
Priscilla Wheeler, head of the Uni
versity negotiating team, and Michael
Baratz, executive secretary of USW,
met with mediators yesterday for about
one-half hour after the hour-long meet
ing between the negotiating teams was
called off by the two federal mediators.
Baratz, head of the union negotiating
team, said he and Wheeler were asked
bv federal mediators to meet alone in
the hope that "in that format we'll be
able to get some communications
going."
Baratz said the face-to-face meetings
with Wheeler were off the record, at

the request of the federal mediators.
Neither side presented any new pro
posals in the meeting between the full
negotiating teams and no progress was
made towards ending the 21-day-old
strike.
"We just went over old ground and
rehashed old stories," said Anne
Schlagenhaft, a member of the union
negotiating team.
The negotiations between the full ne
gotiating teams were called off, accord
ing to Schlagenhaft, because "we had
talked about everything there was to
talk about. Neither side had anvthing
more to sav."
Both sides have charged the other
with being "inflexible." The University
has continued to stick by its Sept. 7 pro
posal, describing this as their "best and
last offer." The University's proposal
would give workers a 14.5 to 17 percent


IRATE STRIKERS PROTEST: Striking USW members continue
their protest of University policies in front of President Donald Ken
nedy's office. Others took their protest to Kennedy's lawn where they
staged an all-night vigil.
