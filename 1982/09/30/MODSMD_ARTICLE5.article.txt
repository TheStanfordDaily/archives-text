# CIT plans to terminate Context Computer System
## 
### KRISTEN CHRISTOPHER Senior staff writer 
Users of the University's Context Computer Sys
tem were told yesterday that the 18-month-old system
has not financially sustained itself and will be termi
nated by Dec. 1.
While the advanced text-processing system serves
more than 350 users — including the Stanfoid Law
Review and the Departments of Communications and
English — the Context system has not attracted
enough users to meet the expense of operation, ac
cording to the Center for Information Technology,
which announced the termination.
The number of Context users has grown since the
system's installation in 1981, but the rate of growth
has not been high enough, said Jean Seigman, assis
tant director of ClT's text network program. The lack

of users "has largely to do with the financial climate,"
rather than the features of the system, she said.
Context's survival depended upon the recruitment
of users paving either subscriptions or hourly fees. In a
letter to present users, ( IT Director Edward Shaw
said, "With the increasingly difficult financial condi
tion of the University in general, it is simply not pos
sible to allocate the several hundreds of thousands of
dollars necessary to retain the services."
Those University users dependent upon the effi
ciency of the word-processing system have already
begun looking for alternatives.
Law Review President Walter Kamiat said, "For
our purposes, a sophisticated word-processing system
is essential. . . unless we want to multiply the work we
do by great magnitudes, so it is essential to find an al
ternative." Whether or not there will be a delay in pub
lication of the next issue depends on the storing capac

itv of the system the Law School decides to acquire, he
said.
Betty Kaplan, administrative assistant for the De
partment of Communication, said the department re
grets losing the system and is considering replacing it
with a microcomputer.
"A number of plans are being laid to assist people
(in finding replacements)," Seigman said. There are
many alternatives forms of service on campus, but
which one is chosen and its viability as a substitute de
pends upon the specific needs of the user, she added.
Context users, one-third of them students, receive
the services through 47 public terminals located on
campus or privately owned terminals. Seigman
pointed out that several of the public terminals, in
cluding 10 at CER AS, have the capability for Context
but are not used exclusively for that system.
