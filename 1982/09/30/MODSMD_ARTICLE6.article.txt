# Alumni voting participation up
## 
### JOAN O'CONNELL 
It is a rare blessing when U.S. Supreme Court justices give
personal endorsements, and thanks in part to the support of
alumna, former trustee and Justice Sandra Day O'Connor,
the Stanford Alumni Association reports a turnaround in a
12-vear trend of declining participation in trustee elections.
John Dit/., president of the Foremost McKesson Property
Co. in San Francisco, received more than 51 percent of the
19,6(X) ballots returned to the association, making him the
top vote-getter in the July election which added four new
trustees to the University's board.
Ditz and Martin Anderson, a Honolulu attorney not to be
confused with Hoover Fellow Martin Anderson, were the
two alumni-elected trustees in the 36 and older group.
Daniel Brenner, a legal assistant to the chairman of the Fed
eral Communications Commission, and Katherine Heard
Hanson, the executive director of Boston's Consortium of
Financing Higher Education, were the two winners in the 35
and under category.
Alumni Association Director William Stone attributed
the 16 percent response rate â€”the highest since 1976 but still
significantly lower than the 26 percent reponses typical in the

late'6os - to the association's increased publicity effort for a
privilege he feels mav be overlooked by some alumni.
A note from O'Connor which was included in a
five-piece direct mailing to all alumni was a major factor in
this effort, according to Stone. In it, she urged alumni to
vote, saying that as an alumni-elected trustee herself, she had
felt "a greater sense of purpose and usefulness having been
elected bv the alumni." O'Connor served as a trustee from
1976 to 1980.
University President Donald Kennedy also encouraged
alumni to vote and even a "bonus gift," a Stanford sticker,
was included as a voting incentive with every ballot.
The alumni have the right to name eight members to the
board, which may have a maximum of 35 members; poor re
sponses to the expensive elections in the recent past, how
ever. had jeopardized the future of that right.
"There was some concern over whether it was worth it,"
Stone said.
This year the direct mailings cost the association more
than $12,000. In addition, the group advertised extensively
in Stanford publications and even consulted direct mail ex-
perts for tips on preparing readable, in
formative pamphlets.
Stone says he thinks the effort and ex
pense are worthwhile.
"I think it's an important vehicle to
have in place because it's a kind of safe
ty valve. If people are dissatisfied with
the way the University is being run, it's
a chance to register that by voting... or
running."
The alumni-elected trustees enjoy the
full privileges and responsibilities of
trustees elected by the board. They are
elected four at a time, with the next elec
tion set for 1985.
