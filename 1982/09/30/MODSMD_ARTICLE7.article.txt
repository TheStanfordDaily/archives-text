# Res Ed urges choices in drinking decisions
## 
### LISA TSENG 
As the undergraduate dorms once
again take in their student residents, al
coholic beverages will also enter these
University domains.
Statistics show, however, that more
than the 80 percent of those in univer
sity dorms nationwide are under 21
years old. For these students, Califor
nia state law makes the consumption of
alcohol illegal, as is supplying alcohol
to those underage. But the number of
underaged drinkers at Stanford events
suggests that the California State law is
often ignored here.

News analysis

Concerns about the transgression of
the state law and the use of dorm funds
for alcohol prompted residential au
thorities at the University of California,
Berkeley this vear to restrict alcohol
consumption to the students* individual
rooms. According to The Daily Califor
nian. an old rule banning the dorms
from sponsoring events where alcohol
is present is now being enforced.
Stanford's policv on alcohol holds
each individual responsible for his or
her own conduct in this area. In keeping
with the general principle that students
are treated as adults and expected to
"act responsibly and with considera
tion for others," the University policy
on drinking states, "In order to provide
maximum opportunity for effective
self-regulation which will protect the in
terests of all members of the Stanford

community, each residence shall adopt
and maintain regulations pertaining to
the use of alcoholic beverages within
the residence and shall be responsible
for compliance with them. In doing so,
each residence shall seriously take into
account the age distribution of its mem
bers so that the legal status ol those stu
dents who are not vet 21 shall be ac
corded recognition and appropriate
protection."
Stanford currently does not enforce
rigid policies over drinking in the dorm
environment; there are no ID checks at
campus events where alcohol is served.
The Office of Residential Education at
Stanford has maintained the regulation
of "individual decision" for all students
and will continue doing so. said Alice
Supton, assistant dean of residential
education.
Norm Robinson, associate dean of
student affairs for residential educa
tion. said he lelt th.it. generally, licjutir
is not a large scale problem in resi
dences. He added that R from sever
al dorms noticed lelt over liquor and
partially tilled kegs after parties.
Robinson said the state liquor law is
not strictlv enforced because campus
social events are often considered
private parties, unlike a restaurant en
vironment where liquor is sold
"The law isn't strictly enforced unless
behavior turns public." he said.
