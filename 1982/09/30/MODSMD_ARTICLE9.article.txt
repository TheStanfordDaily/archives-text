## West German coalitions shift Chancellor Schmidt faces no-confidence vote 
### 
Compiled from news reports and wire services

In a major coalition shift in West Germany's par
liament Tuesday, the Free Democrat Party joined the po
litical opposition and decided to try to topple Chancellor
Helmut Schmidt with a no-confidence vote in Par
liament.
If all goes as expected, the Parliamentary vote planned
for tomorrow will mark the end of a 13-year alliance be
tween Schmidt's Social Democrat Party (SPD) and the
FDP, following the pull-out of four Free Democrat de
puties over a long running economic feud.
The past years of rule by Social Democratic-led gov
ernments have guided West Germany to an un
precedented level of prosperity and international stature,
only to falter because of economic problems and internal
dissent.
The vote is expected to end the government crisis that
began Sept. 17 when the Free Democrat Party bolted
Schmidt's coalition government to join Helmut Kohl's
Christian Democratic Union and its Bavarian affiliate,
the Christian Social Union, in an effort to form a new
coalition. Schmidt remained in office as head of a minor
ity government.
The two conservative parties decided Tuesday to pro
ceed with the no-confidence vote after they were assured
of getting enough Free Democratic votes to ensure suc
cess.
• * •
The assurance came when 34 of the 53 Free Democratis
Parliament pledged in a party caucus to support the no
confidence vote. Those 34 votes, added to the 174 Chris
tian Democratic votes and the 52 Christian Social Union
votes, would be more than enough to topple Schmidt. A
simple majoritv of the 497 votes in the Bundestag, the
lower house of Parliament, is required.
No debate will be permitted. The constitution provides
that no chancellor may be removed by this means unless
the Bundestag chooses a successor. Thus, the motion will
specify that the Bundestag expresses no confidence in

Social Democrat Party (SPD): Chan
cellor Helmut Schmidt; presently the left
liberal ruling coalition.
Free Democrat Party (FDP): Hans-
Dietrich Genscher; a small liberal party
previously aligned with the SPD.
Christian Democrat Party (CDP):
Helmut Kohl; the conservative opposition
party.
Green Party: a loose collection of environ
mentalists and antinuclear activists that
received 8 percent of the vote.
Bavarian Christian Social Union (CSU):
I Premier Franz Josef Strauss; the rightest

Schmidt and elects Kohl as his successor, and at the same
time asks President Karl Carstens to dismiss Schmidt.
If the effort to remove Schmidt succceds, it will be the
first time in West German history that a chancellor has
been replaced in this manner. The only previous attempt
was in 1972, when the Christian Democrats failed by two
votes in an effort to unseat Schmidt's predecessor, Willy
Brandt.
I he decision to go ahead with the no-confidence vote
represents in itself a defeat for Schmidt. In announcing
the breakup of his coalition, Schmidt appealed to the op
position to forgo naming a successor so that early elec
tions could enable the voters to choose a new govern
ment.
Schmidt intends to make a strong bid for support
tomorrow with a speech detailing his policies before the
Bundestag vote is taken, according to reliable sources in
the government.
If the opposition succeeds, Schmidt would be removed
from office after eight years as chancellor — two years
before his term is officially up — despite the fact that
polls show he is West Germany's most popular politician.
A high-ranking member of the Social Democratic Par
ty blasted the decision be Schmidt's opponents, saying
they were "frivolously riding over their voters," who
elected Schmidt's coalition government in 1980.
"These voters without doubt wanted a Social Demo
cratic coalition for the duration of this term under the
leadership of Social Democratic Chancellor Helmut
Schmidt," said Herbert Wehner, head of the Social Dem
ocratic parliamentarv deputies.
Schmidt met with his party's deputies Tuesday and
called on them to do everything possible to block the no
confidence vote, saving Free Democrat leader Hans-
Dietrich Genscher and Kohl had no mandate from the
voters to behave as they have, West German television re
ported.
# r\
Genscher, who has been denounced by left-wing party
members for bolting the Schmidt coalition, is expected to
become foreign minister as he was under Schmidt. The
party would also get back the ministries of economics and
agriculture, plus the Justice Ministry in place of the In
terior Ministry, which it had in the Schmidt government.
A Christian Democratic spokesman said Kohl expects
to announce his full Cabinet Monday.
The end of the Schmidt era marks months of intrpparty
struggle, mostly due to opposition form the left-wing fac
tion led bv Willy Brandt, who recently stated his dream of
forming an alliance with the environmental-pacifist
Green Part v.
Since mid-1981, Schmidt's policies of unyielding sup
port for NATO's defense pol : cy in Western Europe and
his low-keyed reaction to the Soviet-backed imposition
.'of mari'mi ,taw in Poland provoked opposition both
abroad and within his party. In one instance, some 58
members of Schmidt's parliamentary delegation publica-

Ilv supported the 300,000 demonstrators protesting his
pro-NATO stand. Even though Schmidt defeated an lef
tist attempt at the SPD conference in Munich last April to
approve a moratorium on deployment of the new mis
siles, the intrapartv quarrels were seen as a sign that the
government was weakening.
Speculation has it that the new government's policies
will be moderate, in that most experts consider Kohl just
as committed as Schmidt to detente and East-West trade,
though the United States administration hopes that a
more conservative government in Bonn will be more re
ceptive to issues such as sanctions against the Soviet
Union. Whereas Schmidt annoyed the Americans with
his often abrasive manner, Kohl is predicted to be more
accommodating toward the U.S.
For the moment, West Germans are expectant and
ready to support the new Christian Democrat-Free Dem
ocrat coalition, and hope the changeover process will be
quickly effected. Otherwise, West Germans will face po
litical and economic uncertainty until new elections are
held.

Helmut Schmidt
Compiled from news reports and wire services

In a major coalition shift in West Germany's par
liament Tuesday, the Free Democrat Party joined the po
litical opposition and decided to try to topple Chancellor
Helmut Schmidt with a no-confidence vote in Par
liament.
If all goes as expected, the Parliamentary vote planned
for tomorrow will mark the end of a 13-year alliance be
tween Schmidt's Social Democrat Party (SPD) and the
FDP, following the pull-out of four Free Democrat de
puties over a long running economic feud.
The past years of rule by Social Democratic-led gov
ernments have guided West Germany to an un
precedented level of prosperity and international stature,
only to falter because of economic problems and internal
dissent.
The vote is expected to end the government crisis that
began Sept. 17 when the Free Democrat Party bolted
Schmidt's coalition government to join Helmut Kohl's
Christian Democratic Union and its Bavarian affiliate,
the Christian Social Union, in an effort to form a new
coalition. Schmidt remained in office as head of a minor
ity government.
The two conservative parties decided Tuesday to pro
ceed with the no-confidence vote after they were assured
of getting enough Free Democratic votes to ensure suc
cess.
• * •
The assurance came when 34 of the 53 Free Democratis
Parliament pledged in a party caucus to support the no
confidence vote. Those 34 votes, added to the 174 Chris
tian Democratic votes and the 52 Christian Social Union
votes, would be more than enough to topple Schmidt. A
simple majoritv of the 497 votes in the Bundestag, the
lower house of Parliament, is required.
No debate will be permitted. The constitution provides
that no chancellor may be removed by this means unless
the Bundestag chooses a successor. Thus, the motion will
specify that the Bundestag expresses no confidence in

Social Democrat Party (SPD): Chan
cellor Helmut Schmidt; presently the left
liberal ruling coalition.

party.
