"HERE IS THE WORK OF A MAJOR FILM
MAKER AT THE PEAK OF HIS FORM.
A bitter, brisk, sometimes abruptly moving satire.
Miss Sukowa is smashing. Mr. Mueller-Stahl,
Mr. Adorf and everyone else in the large jtpt||j2
cast are excellent. Unexpectedly
rich...'Lola' should be enjoyed for JG
the sheer, joyous effrontery of it!' Jfj Jrj|
-Vincent Canby, New York Timet ™ t&jnF I
"'LOLA* MUST BE SEEN! Pr
More intuitive and more sHilj
pragmatic than much of
Fassbinder's previous work. I was
somewhat surprised by the film,
and yet it helped me understand
more clearly the distinctive
qualities of his art!' ■!
