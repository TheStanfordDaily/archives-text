# Bill to end forced retirement would affect tenured profs here
## 
### SID ATKINS 
Congress is currently considering a
bill that would eliminate mandatory re
tirement for tenured professors and
may pose serious recruiting and budg
etary problems for universities, includ
ing Stanford.
The bill would make it impossible for
any employer to force retirement on
employees who wish to continue work
ing, regardless of their age. The current
law sets the mandatory retirement age
at 70, raised from 65 a few years ago.
Universities were exempt from this
raise until July, 1982, when they too
were forced to comply. Under the new
bill, there would be no exemption for
universities.
University President Donald Ken
nedy wrote to Senator Donald Nickles
(R-Okla.) last month, urging that an ex
emption from this bill for universities
be considered. In that letter, he said,
"At Stanford, we estimate that there
would be a 20 percent decrease in open
ings (on the faculty) between 1985 and
1990 if two-thirds of the eligible faculty
chose to stay for life." He cited the
proper balance between seasoned facul
ty and those recently appointed as "a
principal contributor to the advance
ment of knowledge in this country."
Under the new proposal, Kennedy
argued, this balance would be difficult
to maintain.
Kennedy also warned that this legis
lation would prompt a significant de
crease in the number of appointment
openings for women and minorities on
the University's faculty: "Our data in
dicate that 62 percent of the women and
40 percent of the minority faculty do
not have tenure. These people comprise
about 32 percent of all nontenured fac
ulty at Stanford."
Princeton University President Wil
liam Bowen joined Kennedy in oppos
tion to the bill. In a letter to Senator
Nicholas Brady (R-N.J.), Bowen ex
plained, "There is an important societal
need for a constant influx into educa
tion of fresh ideas and the most recently

developed skills, especially in new and
developing disciplines."
Robert Freelen, associate vice presi
dent for public affairs, pointed out that
there are more issues surrounding this
proposal than just the dignity of elders.
He said, "Congress is pushing this bill
because it takes significant pressure off
the Social Security System. People over
70 who are working add money to the
system. It's not just a civil rights ques
tion."
Indeed, because the bill would in
crease the average age of all professors
and because older professors generally
earn more money, universities could be
forced to change their salary payment
plans in order to keep costs down.
Nevertheless, as Physics Professor
Alexander Fetter, chairman of the Fac
ulty Senate, said, "The University may
just have to accept the fact that they
can't force retirements."
Engineering Professor Bernard Roth
told the Daily he thinks this piece of leg
islation is "terrific" and "long over
due." Yesterday, Roth cautioned the
Faculty Senate not to get into the "pan
ic mode," in response to concerns
voiced by Provost Albert Hastorf about
the legislation.
"The world has not collapsed when
retirement ages have been uncapped" in
other parts of the country, he said.
"Retiring people early is unfair. It's
called 'agism' and it's a prejudice just
like racism," he said. Roth added, how
ever, that he does not believe the bill
will have much effect at Stanford. "A
lot of people here retire early anyway,"
he said.
The two largest teaching unions in
the nation, the American Federation of
Teachers (AFT) and the American As
sociation of University Professors
(AAUP), disagree on whether univer
sity faculty should be exempted.
The AFT, whose membership in
cludes 80,000 college professors across
the nation, supports the bill. According

to Robert Nielson, assistant to the pres
ident of the AFT, "We don't think that
tenured college faculty should be sin
gled out from other capable elderly
workers.
"An older faculty member's income
needs are comparable to a younger
scholar's, and his desire to achieve is the
same." Nielson added, "There is a myth
of a senile old professor using the same
notes he had 40 years ago. We simply
don't believe this."
The AAUP, which has 178 members
on campus here, feels that the proposal
would reduce the ability of colleges "to
reward promising junior faculty with
promotion to tenure," according to a
report recently released. The organiza
tion fears that if the bill becomes law, it
might force university officials to
change the structure of the tenure sys
tem, long recognized for its success in
promoting freedom of thought and
speech among professors.
The AAUP's position represents a
significant change. In 1978, when uni
versities were exempted from the pre
vious retirement age change, the as
sociation considered the exemption a
"seeming inequity that would conflict
with employees' rights to choose retire
ment dates." Because the consequences
of the latest proposals would be more
serious, they have reversed their posi
tion.
According to Anne Gilespie of the
Special Committee on Aging in Wash
ington, it may be premature to worry
too much about the consequences of
eliminating mandatory retirement,
since the bill stands a good chance of
not making it through Congress.
"We're under a lot of time pressure
here now and I'm not sure we'll get this
bill on the floor before the end of this
congressional session." She added,
however, that some legislation of this
kind certainly will pass through Con
gress in the near future even if this par
ticular bill dies.
