## Pipeline issue threatens survival of NATO alliance 
### 
Although in 1981 we were reminded of the danger
to the cohesion of the Atlantic Alliance posed by the
deployment of American missiles on European soil, it
is perhaps a tragic commentary on the nature of the
alliance that the present debate over the trans-
Siberian pipeline has proved even more dangerous to
the survival of NATO than the Theater Nuclear Force
(TNF) debate. The current crisis, unlike the TNF is
sue, has clearly placed the Europeans and the Soviets
on the same side, dividing NATO into two camps. An
analysis of the pipeline issue from the perspectives of
all three parties involved will clearly reveal that this
division of NATO did not occur out of any great Eu
ropean-Soviet affection, but rather out of calculated
policies based on national self interest.
For the Soviets the concept of a pipeline carrying oil
or gas to Western Europe is neither innovative nor il
logical; in fact it makes the best possible sense. The
Eastern European satellites have for long been depen
dent on Soviet oil and gas and it was many years ago
that neutral countries such as Sweden, Finland and
Austria began purchasing substantial portions of their
energy requirements from the Communist Bloc.
Soviet support of the present trans-Siberian
pipeline is not primarily motivated by foreign policy
designs such as making the West Europeans depen
dent on Soviet energy or driving a wedge between the
United States and its allies. While foreign policy bene
fits may develop, the pipeline is first seen as a way of
meeting the Soviet Union's own domestic needs.
It is crucial to remember that the pipeline which
would be constructed with American technology and
Western European credit would be built across the
vast regions of Siberia until it connected to an already
existing pipeline network which reaches all the way
from the Soviet Union to France and Italy. One must
not think that President Reagan is somehow prevent
ing the construction of a pipeline across Germany! In
addition, 8S percent of the gas travelling through the
proposed pipeline would be destined for the in
dustrialized, western Soviet Union, not Europe.
Not only arc the Soviets attempting to provide
energy for their domestic industry and urban needs,
they are also seeking to improve their position in the
international economic order. The Soviet economy is
in crisis: labor shortages combined with overpopula
tion, food shortages, an inadequate transporation and
energy infrastructure, an almost total lack of quality
consumer goods and perhaps most important of all —
a lack of hard (i.e. Western) currency with which to
trade with the West. About the only things there are
plenty of in the USSR are guns and energy resources.
The proposed pipeline would allow the Soviets to
trade something they have (gas) for something they do
not have (hard currency), a most logical proposal.
• From the European point of view, the pipeline
makes sound energy and economic sense also. Since
the 1973 OPEC embargo the European Economic
Community (EEC) has pursued a policy of diver

sifying sources of supply. While "security of supply"
for Americans means energy self-sufficiency, for Eu
ropeans lacking in natural resources it means relying
to no great degree on unstable suppliers such as
OPEC. Since only an estimated 15 percent of Western
European energy requirement would be met by the
proposed pipeline, Europeans rightly dismiss argu
ments that it would lead to too much dependence on
the Soviet Union in light of the much greater both
American and European dependence on the unstable
Mideast.
The second reason our allies seem to be willing to
endanger NATO in pursuit of trade with the Soviet
Union stems from the current tremendous recession
the EEC finds itself in. The pipeline in its construction
and in its completion will means jobs — thousands of
them — for sensitive economies often with higher un
employment rates than our own.

Since only an estimated 15
percent of Western European
energy requirements would be
met by the proposed pipeline,
Europeans rightly dismiss
arguments that it would lead to
too much dependence on the
Soviet Union...

The third reason for the division in NATO arises
from a philosphical rather than economic difference.
When he spoke to Houston businessmen recently,
West German Chancellor Helmut Schmidt said, "gen
uine security, particularly for us Europeans, cannot be
achieved in opposition to the Soviet Union." Europe
ans believe their safety depends on cooperation, not
confrontation. Whether this is evidence of "pacifism"
or "neutralism" is doubtful it is however, clear testi
mony to the fears of those who must live within sight
of the Soviet tanks, not thousands of miles "safely"
across the Atlantic ocean.
All the talk about fulfilling contracts, however,
means very little; and even if the United States placed
a grain embargo on the Soviet Union, I believe the Eu
ropeans would go ahead with the pipeline because it is
in their self-interest; it is as simple as that.
The Reagan administration's strong stand against
the pipeline has been called unfair, misguided and self
contradictory. To evaluate these criticisms we must
determine exactly what U.S. interests are and then de
cide to what degree, if any, Reagan is pursuing those
interests. American interests with respect to the
pipeline are threefold:
I) If the United States is to deter Soviet misbehavior
some sort of "linkage" must be maintained. While it

might be right to decouple nuclear arms control from
Soviet actions in Afghanistan and in Poland, some
sort of punishment must follow. It was with this
"linkage" in mind that Reagan sought to stop the
pipeline after the martial law crackdown last year.
2) In spite of the European belief that security is at
tained through cooperation and "detente," the last Fif
teen or so years have constantly showed us that the So
viet Union has only continued to increase military ex
penditures at the expense of decreased quantities of
consumer goods and agricultural products. It can only
be in the U.S. interest to force the Soviets to reevaluate
their priorities, causing them to reduce their military
spending and to stop the arms race. The United States
must pursue and course which will drain the Soviet
Union of hard currency in order to force the kind of
budget changes which the Soviet economy requires.
By agreeing to sell grain on a cash basis to the Sovi
ets and by opposing a pipeline which would earn addi
tional hard currency for the Soviets, Reagan has
chosen a policy which will not allow the Soviets to
build up their military might with western technology
and credits.
3) The Reagan administration should recognize
that U.S.-Soviet relations cannot be governed in a
strictly bilateral, "tit for tat'' manner. Just as Reagan
realized that the Carter grain embargo had hurt Amer
icans more than the Soviets, he should also recognize
that unilateral opposition to the trans-Siberian
pipeline might hurt the United States and its allies
more than the Soviet Union, especially in light of Eu
ropean and Soviet determination to go through with
the project. In this regard it is also in the U.S. interests
to seek an economically strong Europe — free of
energy blackmail from any source.
It would be hoped, however, that the unity of the
alliance is as important to the Europeans as it is to the
United States. It if is not, and no compromise can be
reached, some critical re-thinking of U.S. troop com
mitments to NATO is in order.
While sympathy for European proximity to the So
viet Union and the overwhelming European depen
dence on imported energy cannot be neglected, it is
clearly in the U.S. interests to deter Soviet mis
behavior in Poland, to force decreases in Soviet mili
tary expenditures and to maintain a unified alliance
against Soviet expansionism. The present policy of
opposition clearly satisfies the first two interests but
appears to be undermining the third by weakening the
alliance and driving the Europeans closer to the Sovi
ets. It is equally clear that no easy, mutually accep
table solution can be found. Perhaps conflicts among
allies are inevitable, but we can only hope at this point
that the common need for security which binds the At
lantic Alliance together will prove strong and will al
low NATO to endure.

meeting the Soviet Union's own domestic needs.
It is crucial to remember that the pipeline which
would be constructed with American technology and
Western European credit would be built across the
vast regions of Siberia until it connected to an already
existing pipeline network which reaches all the way
from the Soviet Union to France and Italy. One must
not think that President Reagan is somehow prevent
ing the construction of a pipeline across Germany! In
addition, 8S percent of the gas travelling through the
proposed pipeline would be destined for the in
dustrialized, western Soviet Union, not Europe.
Not only arc the Soviets attempting to provide
energy for their domestic industry and urban needs,
they are also seeking to improve their position in the
international economic order. The Soviet economy is
in crisis: labor shortages combined with overpopula
tion, food shortages, an inadequate transporation and
energy infrastructure, an almost total lack of quality
consumer goods and perhaps most important of all —
a lack of hard (i.e. Western) currency with which to
trade with the West. About the only things there are
plenty of in the USSR are guns and energy resources.
The proposed pipeline would allow the Soviets to
trade something they have (gas) for something they do
not have (hard currency), a most logical proposal.
• From the European point of view, the pipeline
makes sound energy and economic sense also. Since
the 1973 OPEC embargo the European Economic
Community (EEC) has pursued a policy of diver

sifying sources of supply. While "security of supply"
for Americans means energy self-sufficiency, for Eu
ropeans lacking in natural resources it means relying
to no great degree on unstable suppliers such as
OPEC. Since only an estimated 15 percent of Western
European energy requirement would be met by the
proposed pipeline, Europeans rightly dismiss argu
ments that it would lead to too much dependence on
the Soviet Union in light of the much greater both
American and European dependence on the unstable
Mideast.
The second reason our allies seem to be willing to
endanger NATO in pursuit of trade with the Soviet
Union stems from the current tremendous recession
the EEC finds itself in. The pipeline in its construction
and in its completion will means jobs — thousands of
them — for sensitive economies often with higher un
employment rates than our own.

The third reason for the division in NATO arises
from a philosphical rather than economic difference.
When he spoke to Houston businessmen recently,
West German Chancellor Helmut Schmidt said, "gen
uine security, particularly for us Europeans, cannot be
achieved in opposition to the Soviet Union." Europe
ans believe their safety depends on cooperation, not
confrontation. Whether this is evidence of "pacifism"
or "neutralism" is doubtful it is however, clear testi
mony to the fears of those who must live within sight
of the Soviet tanks, not thousands of miles "safely"
across the Atlantic ocean.
All the talk about fulfilling contracts, however,
means very little; and even if the United States placed
a grain embargo on the Soviet Union, I believe the Eu
ropeans would go ahead with the pipeline because it is
in their self-interest; it is as simple as that.
The Reagan administration's strong stand against
the pipeline has been called unfair, misguided and self
contradictory. To evaluate these criticisms we must
determine exactly what U.S. interests are and then de
cide to what degree, if any, Reagan is pursuing those
interests. American interests with respect to the
pipeline are threefold:
I) If the United States is to deter Soviet misbehavior
some sort of "linkage" must be maintained. While it

might be right to decouple nuclear arms control from
Soviet actions in Afghanistan and in Poland, some
sort of punishment must follow. It was with this
"linkage" in mind that Reagan sought to stop the
pipeline after the martial law crackdown last year.
2) In spite of the European belief that security is at
tained through cooperation and "detente," the last Fif
teen or so years have constantly showed us that the So
viet Union has only continued to increase military ex
penditures at the expense of decreased quantities of
consumer goods and agricultural products. It can only
be in the U.S. interest to force the Soviets to reevaluate
their priorities, causing them to reduce their military
spending and to stop the arms race. The United States
must pursue and course which will drain the Soviet
Union of hard currency in order to force the kind of
budget changes which the Soviet economy requires.
By agreeing to sell grain on a cash basis to the Sovi
ets and by opposing a pipeline which would earn addi
tional hard currency for the Soviets, Reagan has
chosen a policy which will not allow the Soviets to
build up their military might with western technology
and credits.
3) The Reagan administration should recognize
that U.S.-Soviet relations cannot be governed in a
strictly bilateral, "tit for tat'' manner. Just as Reagan
realized that the Carter grain embargo had hurt Amer
icans more than the Soviets, he should also recognize
that unilateral opposition to the trans-Siberian
pipeline might hurt the United States and its allies
more than the Soviet Union, especially in light of Eu
ropean and Soviet determination to go through with
the project. In this regard it is also in the U.S. interests
to seek an economically strong Europe — free of
energy blackmail from any source.
It would be hoped, however, that the unity of the
alliance is as important to the Europeans as it is to the
United States. It if is not, and no compromise can be
reached, some critical re-thinking of U.S. troop com
mitments to NATO is in order.
While sympathy for European proximity to the So
viet Union and the overwhelming European depen
dence on imported energy cannot be neglected, it is
clearly in the U.S. interests to deter Soviet mis
behavior in Poland, to force decreases in Soviet mili
tary expenditures and to maintain a unified alliance
against Soviet expansionism. The present policy of
opposition clearly satisfies the first two interests but
appears to be undermining the third by weakening the
alliance and driving the Europeans closer to the Sovi
ets. It is equally clear that no easy, mutually accep
table solution can be found. Perhaps conflicts among
allies are inevitable, but we can only hope at this point
that the common need for security which binds the At
lantic Alliance together will prove strong and will al
low NATO to endure.

Although in 1981 we were reminded of the danger
to the cohesion of the Atlantic Alliance posed by the
deployment of American missiles on European soil, it
is perhaps a tragic commentary on the nature of the
alliance that the present debate over the trans-
Siberian pipeline has proved even more dangerous to
the survival of NATO than the Theater Nuclear Force
(TNF) debate. The current crisis, unlike the TNF is
sue, has clearly placed the Europeans and the Soviets
on the same side, dividing NATO into two camps. An
analysis of the pipeline issue from the perspectives of
all three parties involved will clearly reveal that this
division of NATO did not occur out of any great Eu
ropean-Soviet affection, but rather out of calculated
policies based on national self interest.
For the Soviets the concept of a pipeline carrying oil
or gas to Western Europe is neither innovative nor il
logical; in fact it makes the best possible sense. The
Eastern European satellites have for long been depen
dent on Soviet oil and gas and it was many years ago
that neutral countries such as Sweden, Finland and
Austria began purchasing substantial portions of their
energy requirements from the Communist Bloc.
Soviet support of the present trans-Siberian
pipeline is not primarily motivated by foreign policy
designs such as making the West Europeans depen
dent on Soviet energy or driving a wedge between the
United States and its allies. While foreign policy bene
fits may develop, the pipeline is first seen as a way of
meeting the Soviet Union's own domestic needs.

Community (EEC) has pursued a policy of diver

sifying sources of supply. While "security of supply"
for Americans means energy self-sufficiency, for Eu
ropeans lacking in natural resources it means relying
to no great degree on unstable suppliers such as
OPEC. Since only an estimated 15 percent of Western
European energy requirement would be met by the
proposed pipeline, Europeans rightly dismiss argu
ments that it would lead to too much dependence on
the Soviet Union in light of the much greater both
American and European dependence on the unstable
Mideast.
The second reason our allies seem to be willing to
endanger NATO in pursuit of trade with the Soviet
Union stems from the current tremendous recession
the EEC finds itself in. The pipeline in its construction
and in its completion will means jobs — thousands of
them — for sensitive economies often with higher un
employment rates than our own.

Since only an estimated 15
percent of Western European
energy requirements would be
met by the proposed pipeline,
Europeans rightly dismiss
arguments that it would lead to
too much dependence on the
Soviet Union...

The third reason for the division in NATO arises
from a philosphical rather than economic difference.
When he spoke to Houston businessmen recently,
West German Chancellor Helmut Schmidt said, "gen
uine security, particularly for us Europeans, cannot be
achieved in opposition to the Soviet Union." Europe
ans believe their safety depends on cooperation, not
confrontation. Whether this is evidence of "pacifism"
or "neutralism" is doubtful it is however, clear testi
mony to the fears of those who must live within sight
of the Soviet tanks, not thousands of miles "safely"
across the Atlantic ocean.
All the talk about fulfilling contracts, however,
means very little; and even if the United States placed
a grain embargo on the Soviet Union, I believe the Eu
ropeans would go ahead with the pipeline because it is
in their self-interest; it is as simple as that.
The Reagan administration's strong stand against
the pipeline has been called unfair, misguided and self
contradictory. To evaluate these criticisms we must
determine exactly what U.S. interests are and then de
cide to what degree, if any, Reagan is pursuing those
interests. American interests with respect to the
pipeline are threefold:
I) If the United States is to deter Soviet misbehavior
some sort of "linkage" must be maintained. While it

might be right to decouple nuclear arms control from
Soviet actions in Afghanistan and in Poland, some
sort of punishment must follow. It was with this
"linkage" in mind that Reagan sought to stop the
pipeline after the martial law crackdown last year.
2) In spite of the European belief that security is at
tained through cooperation and "detente," the last Fif
teen or so years have constantly showed us that the So
viet Union has only continued to increase military ex
penditures at the expense of decreased quantities of
consumer goods and agricultural products. It can only
be in the U.S. interest to force the Soviets to reevaluate
their priorities, causing them to reduce their military
spending and to stop the arms race. The United States
must pursue and course which will drain the Soviet
Union of hard currency in order to force the kind of
budget changes which the Soviet economy requires.
By agreeing to sell grain on a cash basis to the Sovi
ets and by opposing a pipeline which would earn addi
tional hard currency for the Soviets, Reagan has
chosen a policy which will not allow the Soviets to
build up their military might with western technology
and credits.
3) The Reagan administration should recognize
that U.S.-Soviet relations cannot be governed in a
strictly bilateral, "tit for tat'' manner. Just as Reagan
realized that the Carter grain embargo had hurt Amer
icans more than the Soviets, he should also recognize
that unilateral opposition to the trans-Siberian
pipeline might hurt the United States and its allies
more than the Soviet Union, especially in light of Eu
ropean and Soviet determination to go through with
the project. In this regard it is also in the U.S. interests
to seek an economically strong Europe — free of
energy blackmail from any source.
It would be hoped, however, that the unity of the
alliance is as important to the Europeans as it is to the
United States. It if is not, and no compromise can be
reached, some critical re-thinking of U.S. troop com
mitments to NATO is in order.
While sympathy for European proximity to the So
viet Union and the overwhelming European depen
dence on imported energy cannot be neglected, it is
clearly in the U.S. interests to deter Soviet mis
behavior in Poland, to force decreases in Soviet mili
tary expenditures and to maintain a unified alliance
against Soviet expansionism. The present policy of
opposition clearly satisfies the first two interests but
appears to be undermining the third by weakening the
alliance and driving the Europeans closer to the Sovi
ets. It is equally clear that no easy, mutually accep
table solution can be found. Perhaps conflicts among
allies are inevitable, but we can only hope at this point
that the common need for security which binds the At
lantic Alliance together will prove strong and will al
low NATO to endure.
