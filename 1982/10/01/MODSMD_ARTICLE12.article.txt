## U.S. Mideast policies need revision 
### 
Israel's brutal invasion of Lebanon
has exposed the bankruptcy of Ameri
ca's Mideast policies. Americans must
take a hard look at our own responsi
bility for this tragedy.
The Israeli military is highly depen
dent upon American weapons. Two
thirds of this year's $2.2 billion aid al
lotment to Israel consists of military
equipment. These weapons are, os
tensibly, meant for Israel's defense.
Yet, Israel's invasion is clearly a case of
outright aggression, and Israel's re
peated use of American made cluster
and phosphorus bombs against civilian
targets openly flouted U.S. arms sale re
strictions. Yet, rather than cut off arms
sales to Israel as required by law, the
Reagan administration still hopes to
raise American aid to $2.5 billion next
year.
America's huge aid commitment to
Israel has done nothing to promote
peace and stability in the region. In
stead, American arms have whetted Is
rael's appetite for aggression, and the
United States has shown no serious
willingness to restrain the flow of weap
ons or the purposes to which they are
put.
George Ball, former undersecretary
of state, has aptly described the routine
pattern of U.S.-Israeli relations. "First,
Israel embarks secretly on some mili
tary adventure ... Second, the U.S.
government responds, if at all, by mild
threats that both sides know will never
be carried out; Third, when the Israeli
government expresses anger at those
threats, we appease it with more guns
and planes."
This pattern has become com
monplace over the past year. In the
summer of 1981, Israeli bombs fell on
an Iraqui nuclear reactor as well as
West Beirut (killing 300 people). In De
cember, Israel annexed the Golan
Heights. In each case, mild and ineffec

tual American chastisements were fol
lowed by public statements reasserting
U.S. support for Israel.
As for Israel's push into Lebanon, Is
raeli Defense Minister Ariel Sharon as
serted on Israeli radio that the United
States approved of Israel's invasion
beforehand. President Jimmy Carter
has stated that Israeli sources provided
him with similar information. Stepped
up arms deliveries early this year and an
unusual U.S. naval buildup off the Leb
anese coast prior to the invasion pro
vide further support for these claims.
Once the invasion began, President
Reagan, unlike European leaders, re
fused to condemn Israeli aggression.
The United States, against 14 yes votes,
vetoed a U.N. Security Council resolu
tion which threatened sanctions if Israel
did not withdraw immediately. By June
14, the United States was openly en
dorsing Israel's intention of forcing the
PLO and the Syrians from Lebanon.
The New York Times reported that
"Haig and other officials... seemed in
agreement with the Israelis on the need
for a significant political shift in Leba
non first."
The quarrels between the United
States and Israel over Sharon's ruthless
bombing of West Beirut were blown out
of proportion by the press. Only
belatedly, when the United States felt
that Israeli aims had been achieved, did
Reagan intervene with a cynical at
tempt to portray the United States as a
peacemaker. Indeed, Israeli Foreign
Minister Yitzhak Shamir stated at the
time that America's differences with Is
rael were over tactics, not aims.
American actions suggest a general
unwillingness to use American in
fluence to curb Israeli aggression and,
in the case at hand, actual complicity
with Israeli aims.
The United States has had a long
standing policy of unbalanced support
for Israel. The United States has never
recognized the Palestinians' right to a
sovereign state. Unlike more than 100
other nations, the United States has not
seen fit to recognize or deal with the
PLO.
The Camp David Accords, rejected
by Arabs everywhere outside of Egypt,
have only added to this dismal record.
These agreements have not stopped Is
rael from expanding Jewish settlements
in the West Bank in a policy of creeping
annexation, or stepping up repression
of Palestinians. Israel's recent attempt
to destroy the PLO not only followed
logically from these policies but was
made possible by the neutralization of
Egypt achieved through Camp David.
Reagan's recent objections to Israeli
annexation of the West Bank and the
expansion of Jewish settlements there
are welcome. Overall, however, his pro
posals are inadequate. Since Reagan's
proposal rejects Palestinian statehood,

West Bank Palestinians would, unwill
ingly, be placed under the control of
King Hussein, the conservative,
Bedouin monarch of Jordan. Reagan's
proposals also ignore the plight* of
Palestinian refugees outside of the oc
cupied territories, reject dismantlement
of existing Israeli settlements built on
Palestinian land, and exclude any role
for the PLO which, according to a Time
magazine poll, is seen by 86 percent of
West Bank Palestinians as their legit
imate representative (Time. May 24).
Three factors explain America's
heavy bias toward Israel. First, U.S.
planners view Israel as a strategic asset
serving as a bulwark against both Sovi
et influence and Moslem fundamen
talism as well as a potential protector of
American oil interests.
Secondly, a strong Israeli lobby has
helped to stifle intelligent debate over
U.S. policies. The special relationship
between pro-Israeli Jews and liberal
Democrats has made liberals who
speak out against injustice in places like
South Africa or El Salvador blind to the
plight of the Palestinians.
Finally, sympathy flowing from
memories of the Holocaust and cultural
affinity attract many Americans to Is
rael. Many, however, do not realize that
the founding of a Jewish state trans
formed many Palestinians into refugees i
or second class citizens within Israel. \
Despite the bankruptcy of past poli
cies and the political obstacles to
change, the United States can and
should begin to play a constructivejole
in building a just peace in the Mideast.
The United States should abancfon
the Camp David framework and sfc<je a
comprehensive settlement involving all
parties to the conflict. First, the United
States must recognize and deal with the
PLO as the legitimate representative jtf
the Palestinian people. Second,"tjie
United States must demand that Israel
withdraw to its pre-1967 borders.
Third, a Palestinian state should be es
tablished on the West Bank and the
Gaza Strip, and Israel should be pro
vided with international security guar
antees. Fourth, peace treaties between
Israel and the surrounding Arab statjes
should serve as a first step toward tyH
normalization of relations. - . j

The recent massacre of Palestiniahs
in Lebanon underscores the urgency of
initiating a peace process based
respect for Palestinian rights. The Unit
ed States must use its massive leverage
over Israel to press for a just pea<£.
Such a scenario is in the long-run in
terests of Israelis as well as Palestinians.
