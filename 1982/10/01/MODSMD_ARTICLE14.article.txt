skilled and competitive fall under
"A" class, while "C" class teams
will be the least skilled and com
petitive, and "B" class teams
should be of average skill.
Limits of about 180 football
teams, 230 basketball teams and
120 volleyball teams will be set.
All interested participants are
normally accommodated, but
immediate sign-up is essential to
ensure a team's place.
