## High-flying Card to battle 'sack patrol' 
### SID SPAETH 
Oregon State would like to use
its improved defense to end
its 13-game losing streak this
weekend at the Farm.
But Stanford, the last con
ference team to lose to the
Beavers, has produced a con
sistently powerful offense that
will not quit.
Capped by John Elway's 35-
for-63, 407-yard throwing last
week over Ohio State, the Stan
ford offense has averaged 37.9
points and 554 yards in their last
eight games dating back to last
year.
Oregon State will not be able
to top that. But can the Cardinal,
overwhelmingly favored after the
stunning upset over Ohio State
on national television last week,
avoid a letdown against an Ore
gon State team that has become
svnonomous with losing?
While Oregon State has lost
its first three games, including
a 17-13 loss last week to San Jose
State, Stanford coach Paul Wig
gin saw something in their last
loss.
"Oregon State looks like a very
young team," Wiggin said, "but
one that is progressing in a
positive way. I think their per
formance against a good San
Jose State team is a good in
dicator of OSU's ability."
Wiggin mainly fears the
Beavers's "sack patrol" that has
ambushed offenses 13 times in
the last two games — six times
against Louisiana State and sev
en against San Jose's highly com
plex multiple offense.
Elway escaped Ohio State
clutches completely last week,
but some of that was due to his
own scrambling.

"We went into the game think
ing we couldn't go deep," Wiggin
said after last weekend's win. We
thought we would have to run a
lot of timing patterns. Short,
quick passes. If you saw Elway in
the pocket for five seconds, it
wasn't by design."
Elway's mobility has also
enabled the Cardinal to abandon
the pocket-throwing approach if
it does not work.
Oregon State would like to use
its improved defense to end its
13-game losing streak this week
end at the Farm.
"It is cerainly exciting to watch
and I believe it is a mental aspect
along with some defensive align
ments that are giving us some dif
ferent pictures," Oregon State
coach Joe Avezzano said. "A
four-man line is also giving us a
better rush, plus just an overall
mental attitude of getting to the
quarterback.
"Now we feel we are supposed
to and capable of getting to the
quarterback. That is a difference
from the past," Avzzano con
tinued. "I am very pleased to see
these guys cranking up an oppos
ing quarterbacks."
Wiggin said that concerns him.
"They played San Jose State
real tough," Wiggin said. "They
have some big strong players.
They did a good job dealing with
the San Jose multiple offense."
The Stanford offensive line
kept Ohio State off of Elway, but
defenders had hands in Elway's
face all afternoon and batted
away several passes.
"It was not a letter perfect
game in execution," Wiggin said.
"But it was a winning effort."
Stanford's offense has re
volved around a receiving corps

anchored by running back Vin
cent White. White bruised a
shoulder against Ohio State and
probably will not play unless
needed.
Tight end Chris Dressel be
came the main cog in Stanford's
important second half last week
pulling in seven second half
passes — mainly over the middle.
"Chris had an incredible day,"
Wiggin said. "He was continual
ly called upon in critical situ
ations and he delivered."
Emile Harry, who caught the
game winner last week, has 16 re
ceptions, but is hobbling on a
bruised and sprained ankle.
Flanker Mike Tolliver has seven
receptions.
Elwav, who stunned the Big 10
press with 63 passes last week,
told reporters after the game he
will continue to throw.
"That's the most I've ever
thrown in my life," Elway said.
"There are people back home
who still say we don't throw
enough."
The Stanford defense, which
prevented last week's game from
becoming a blowout early and
kept the sputtering offense in
striking distance, is perhaps the
most balanced the Cardinal has
had in years.
The defense has already in
tercepted 10 times — twice that
of all last year. Kevin Baird in
tercepted once in the waning mo
ments and then tipped the key
pass to Charles Hutchings, set
ting up the final drive.
Garin Veris netted several key
sacks forcing Ohio State to pass.
Gary Wimmer leads the team in
tackles from inside linebacker.

positive way. I think their per
formance against a good San
Jose State team is a good in
dicator of OSU's ability."
Wiggin mainly fears the
Beavers's "sack patrol" that has
ambushed offenses 13 times in
the last two games — six times
against Louisiana State and sev
en against San Jose's highly com
plex multiple offense.
Elway escaped Ohio State
clutches completely last week,
but some of that was due to his
own scrambling.

"We went into the game think
ing we couldn't go deep," Wiggin
said after last weekend's win. We
thought we would have to run a
lot of timing patterns. Short,
quick passes. If you saw Elway in
the pocket for five seconds, it
wasn't by design."
Elway's mobility has also
enabled the Cardinal to abandon
the pocket-throwing approach if
it does not work.
Oregon State would like to use
its improved defense to end its
13-game losing streak this week
end at the Farm.
"It is cerainly exciting to watch
and I believe it is a mental aspect
along with some defensive align
ments that are giving us some dif
ferent pictures," Oregon State
coach Joe Avezzano said. "A
four-man line is also giving us a
better rush, plus just an overall
mental attitude of getting to the
quarterback.
"Now we feel we are supposed
to and capable of getting to the
quarterback. That is a difference
from the past," Avzzano con
tinued. "I am very pleased to see
these guys cranking up an oppos
ing quarterbacks."
Wiggin said that concerns him.
"They played San Jose State
real tough," Wiggin said. "They
have some big strong players.
They did a good job dealing with
the San Jose multiple offense."
The Stanford offensive line
kept Ohio State off of Elway, but
defenders had hands in Elway's
face all afternoon and batted
away several passes.
"It was not a letter perfect
game in execution," Wiggin said.
"But it was a winning effort."
Stanford's offense has re
volved around a receiving corps

anchored by running back Vin
cent White. White bruised a
shoulder against Ohio State and
probably will not play unless
needed.
Tight end Chris Dressel be
came the main cog in Stanford's
important second half last week
pulling in seven second half
passes — mainly over the middle.
"Chris had an incredible day,"
Wiggin said. "He was continual
ly called upon in critical situ
ations and he delivered."
Emile Harry, who caught the
game winner last week, has 16 re
ceptions, but is hobbling on a
bruised and sprained ankle.
Flanker Mike Tolliver has seven
receptions.
Elwav, who stunned the Big 10
press with 63 passes last week,
told reporters after the game he
will continue to throw.
"That's the most I've ever
thrown in my life," Elway said.
"There are people back home
who still say we don't throw
enough."
The Stanford defense, which
prevented last week's game from
becoming a blowout early and
kept the sputtering offense in
striking distance, is perhaps the
most balanced the Cardinal has
had in years.
The defense has already in
tercepted 10 times — twice that
of all last year. Kevin Baird in
tercepted once in the waning mo
ments and then tipped the key
pass to Charles Hutchings, set
ting up the final drive.
Garin Veris netted several key
sacks forcing Ohio State to pass.
Gary Wimmer leads the team in
tackles from inside linebacker.

NO LOOSE ENDS: Stanford tight end Chris Dressel caught a
career-high eight passes for 104 yards — seven in the pivotal sec
ood half — in the Cardinal's come-from-behind 23-20 upset vic
tory over Ohio State.
Oregon State would like to use
its improved defense to end
its 13-game losing streak this
weekend at the Farm.
But Stanford, the last con
ference team to lose to the
Beavers, has produced a con
sistently powerful offense that
will not quit.
Capped by John Elway's 35-
for-63, 407-yard throwing last
week over Ohio State, the Stan
ford offense has averaged 37.9
points and 554 yards in their last
eight games dating back to last
year.
Oregon State will not be able
to top that. But can the Cardinal,
overwhelmingly favored after the
stunning upset over Ohio State
on national television last week,
avoid a letdown against an Ore
gon State team that has become
svnonomous with losing?
While Oregon State has lost
its first three games, including
a 17-13 loss last week to San Jose
State, Stanford coach Paul Wig
gin saw something in their last
loss.
"Oregon State looks like a very
young team," Wiggin said, "but
one that is progressing in a
positive way. I think their per
formance against a good San
Jose State team is a good in
dicator of OSU's ability."
