### STEPHEN STRENG 
With the most difficult part of
the 1982 conference season fast
approaching, Stanford coach
Fred Sturm and the Cardinal
women's volleyball team have
their work cut out for them de
spite an 8-3 start. The Cardinal
has played two conference
matches, beating Cal State-Full
erton and losing to San Diego
State.
Stanford will get one last tune
up this weekend at the Berkeley
Invitational before further com
petition in their new conference,
the West Coast Athletic Associa
tion. The WCAA is considered to
be the toughest volleyball con
ference in the nation, containing
five of the country's top-eleven
ranked teams.
"Getting through the con
ference schedule is the hard
part," admitted assistant coach
Don Shaw.
Shaw went on to say, however,
that he feels Stanford has an ad
vantage because it started prac
tice later than most teams.
"Some teams will have already
peaked so we'll know what to ex
pect from them," said Shaw.
"But they won't know what to
expect from us."
The Cardinal will have to peak
sky-high themselves with their
last five conference games com
ing on the road.
The coaching staff has been
satisfied with the team's progress

so far. "We're farther along !at
this point than we were Ust
year," Shaw said. "Because of pll
our returning players we've been
able to put in new stuff and teach
them new things."
Leading the Cardinal in the
Berkeley tournament will be sen
iors J.J. Gearhart at middle
blocker and Deanna Boyette
from her outside hitter pcjitiqn.
Boyette is starting her fourth
consecutive year. Another key
player is senior backcourt spe
cialist Kisi Haine.
i
After that, the leadership re
sponsibility falls on junior setter
Kari Rush and sophomore setter
Deidra Dvorak and highly
touted freshman middle blocker
Kim Oden.
Also seeing action will be jun
ior Julie Baker and sophomore
Susan Compton, both at outside
hitter. The coaches havbe also
been impressed with the progress
of sophomore Karen Lysaght
and freshman Terri Bryson.
Going into the Berkeley tour
nament the Cardinal will be seek
ing revenge for a hotly contested
early seasopn loss to Cal Poly-
San Luis Obispo, a five-game
match in which each game was
decided bv two points.
Shaw was realistic when
assessing his team's chances for
post-season play this season.
"We'll do as well as we can and
let the winning and losing take
care of itself."
