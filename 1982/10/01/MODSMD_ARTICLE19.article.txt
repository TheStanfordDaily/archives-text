# 'Great Race' billed as run for everyone
## 
### 
As many as 3000 runners will
be on hand this Sunday, October
3, for the fifth running of the an
nual Great Race at Stanford.
Proceeds from the race go to the
Cardinal Club and are used to
fund women's athletic scholar
ships at the University.
The 10-kilometer (6.2 mile)
race, being billed as "Great Race
V", will begin at 9 a.m. and will
start and finish at Stanford Stadi
um.
There will also be a 2.5 kilo
meter (1.6 mile) fun run, com
mencing at 8:30 a.m. The entry
fee is $10 and includes payment
for a Great Race t-shirt. In
terested parties can register on
the day of the race at Stanford
Stadium between 7:30 and 8:30
a.m. Advance registration can be
completed at the Stanford Ath
letic Department.
Race director Oz Crosby as
serted that the race is not de
signed just for the elite runner.
"This is a race for the ordinary
runner, too," he said. "It's a
mostly flat course and it gives or
dinary runners the chance to run
with manv well-known athletes."

Stanford graduate and 1980
U.S. Olympic trials marathon
champ Tony Sandoval is in
cluded in the field, as is former
marathon world record holder
Derek Clayton.
Dr. Duncan McDonald, a
member of the 1976 Olympic
track squad will run, as will Con
gressman Pete McCloskey (R-
Menlo Park). University Presi
dent Donald Kennedy will be at
tempting to better his third-place
finish in the 50-and-older
division in last vear's race.
The race will have a novel in
novation this year, with
videotape playbacks of the win
ners being shown while the re
sults are being compiled.
"Almost all the runners in the
race wouldn't get a chance to see
the finish of the race because
they're back in the pack," Crosby
said. "Now they will be able to
see it all."
The Great Race has featured
five national age group records
over the past three years and has
raised over $25,000 to date for
women's athletic scholarships.
The race is sponsored by Western
Federal Savings.
