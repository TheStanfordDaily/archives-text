# University faced $2.2 million loss
## Research grants reinstated 
### KATHY CHRISTIE Staff writer 
The government will probably continue to provide in
direct recovery costs for research projects, saving the Uni
versity $2.2 million dollars, University President Donald
Kennedy told the Faculty Senate yesterday.
This, and the approval of a proposed masters program in
International Policy Studies, were principal topics of dis
cussion during the meeting.
The dispute over indirect cost recovery on research grants
arose in March when the Department of Health and Human
Services proposed in its 1983 budget to pay only 90 percent
of indirect costs. Indirect costs are the overhead costs of re
search projects and will account for 69 percent of the total
research costs in the University's 1982-1983 fiscal year
budget. A 10 percent cut in indirect cost funding would cost
the University more than $2.2 million out of the general
fund.
"It now appears that 10 percent cut will not be im
plemented," said Kennedy. "The Congress has included in
the continuing resolution additional funds to the Depart
ment of HHS to cover full payment of indirect costs and lan
guage requiring the department to continue supporting re
search under current terms and conditions. In addition, the
House Appropriations Committee yesterday, in its 1983

HHS appropriations bill, explicitly directed the department
to pay full indirect cost."
Kennedy also made it clear that caution must be taken in
evaluating the situation. "The continuing resolution is in
conference today; it could be vetoed by the president. The
appropriations process is still underway and will not be com
plete before the lame duck session, if then. We cannot be sure
of the final decision until we receive written confirmation
from the department."
Although Kennedy had little progress to report on strike
negotiations, he emphasized to the senate that the University
was in no way responsible for the strike. "We began our ne
gotiation from a realistic level and made improvements in
our offer in such a way as to signal clearly what our final
zone of settlement would be," he said, adding that the Uni
versity has very little flexibility left and that "a significant
move by USW now is required to get the bargaining process
out of its present impasse.
"It is said to be about an unfair labor practice, yet actually
deals with contract terms; and the union leadership, instead
of using the process of collective bargaining seriously, has
sought to settle it in every other way possible: on the picket
line, in the media, by political pressure and now finally by
personal harassment.
