# University faced $2.2 million loss
## Research grants reinstated 
### KATHY CHRISTIE Staff writer 
The government will probably continue to provide in
direct recovery costs for research projects, saving the Uni
versity $2.2 million dollars, University President Donald
Kennedy told the Faculty Senate yesterday.
This, and the approval of a proposed masters program in
International Policy Studies, were principal topics of dis
cussion during the meeting.
The dispute over indirect cost recovery on research grants
arose in March when the Department of Health and Human
Services proposed in its 1983 budget to pay only 90 percent
of indirect costs. Indirect costs are the overhead costs of re
search projects and will account for 69 percent of the total
research costs in the University's 1982-1983 fiscal year
budget. A 10 percent cut in indirect cost funding would cost
the University more than $2.2 million out of the general
fund.
"It now appears that 10 percent cut will not be im
plemented," said Kennedy. "The Congress has included in
the continuing resolution additional funds to the Depart
ment of HHS to cover full payment of indirect costs and lan
guage requiring the department to continue supporting re
search under current terms and conditions. In addition, the
House Appropriations Committee yesterday, in its 1983

HHS appropriations bill, explicitly directed the department
to pay full indirect cost."
Kennedy also made it clear that caution must be taken in
evaluating the situation. "The continuing resolution is in
conference today; it could be vetoed by the president. The
appropriations process is still underway and will not be com
plete before the lame duck session, if then. We cannot be sure
of the final decision until we receive written confirmation
from the department."
Although Kennedy had little progress to report on strike
negotiations, he emphasized to the senate that the University
was in no way responsible for the strike. "We began our ne
gotiation from a realistic level and made improvements in
our offer in such a way as to signal clearly what our final
zone of settlement would be," he said, adding that the Uni
versity has very little flexibility left and that "a significant
move by USW now is required to get the bargaining process
out of its present impasse.
"It is said to be about an unfair labor practice, yet actually
deals with contract terms; and the union leadership, instead
of using the process of collective bargaining seriously, has
sought to settle it in every other way possible: on the picket
line, in the media, by political pressure and now finally by
personal harassment.


MEETING OF MINDS: Faculty Senate members, in
cluding University President Donald Kennedy, met yes-

Paul Ainslie/Daily
terday to discuss, among other things, the University's
position on strike negotiations.
"It's not going to be settled in any of
those places, but will be settled only at
the table — and only through the in
troduction, by USW's representatives,
of a note of realism."
When asked bv English Prof. Ronald
Rebholz why the University would not
comply in giving the union a list of non
union workers, Kennedy replied by
saying that such a list would require "so
much commitment of institutional time
and energy and to include so much in
formation that was not relevant to any
thing that we could foresee as a legit
imate purpose" that the University de

emed such a list unnecessary.
A new master of arts program in In
ternational Policy Studies was also ap
proved at the meeting after much dis
cussion. Designed as an in
terdisciplinary major with such ele
ments as foreign languages, economies,
political systems and societies, Interna
tional Policy Studies is different from
international Relations in that it is
more specific and does not require stu
dying abroad. Although it can require
up to 117 units of coursework, students
can still go abroad, especially for in
ternships that the University hopes to
make available.
Assoc. Prof, of Philosophy Michael

Bratman was particularly dissatisfied
with the structure of the major because
of its apparent absence of any sort of
philosophy course. Political Science
Prof. Robert Ward, who was explaining
the program to the senate, conceded
that although it would be better to in
clude a philosophy course, ethics were
covered in other coursework and there
were already too many units required to
expect more work done. These objec
tions, in addition to objections to the
extensive requirements of the program,
caused the senate to vote on whether
they would even vote to approve the
major. Not only'did they vote to vote,
but in the second voting they approved
it.

negotiations, he emphasized to the senate that the University
was in no way responsible for the strike. "We began our ne
gotiation from a realistic level and made improvements in
our offer in such a way as to signal clearly what our final
zone of settlement would be," he said, adding that the Uni
versity has very little flexibility left and that "a significant
move by USW now is required to get the bargaining process
out of its present impasse.
"It is said to be about an unfair labor practice, yet actually
deals with contract terms; and the union leadership, instead
of using the process of collective bargaining seriously, has
sought to settle it in every other way possible: on the picket
line, in the media, by political pressure and now finally by
personal harassment.


MEETING OF MINDS: Faculty Senate members, in
cluding University President Donald Kennedy, met yes-

Paul Ainslie/Daily
terday to discuss, among other things, the University's
position on strike negotiations.
"It's not going to be settled in any of
those places, but will be settled only at
the table — and only through the in
troduction, by USW's representatives,
of a note of realism."
When asked bv English Prof. Ronald
Rebholz why the University would not
comply in giving the union a list of non
union workers, Kennedy replied by
saying that such a list would require "so
much commitment of institutional time
and energy and to include so much in
formation that was not relevant to any
thing that we could foresee as a legit
imate purpose" that the University de

emed such a list unnecessary.
A new master of arts program in In
ternational Policy Studies was also ap
proved at the meeting after much dis
cussion. Designed as an in
terdisciplinary major with such ele
ments as foreign languages, economies,
political systems and societies, Interna
tional Policy Studies is different from
international Relations in that it is
more specific and does not require stu
dying abroad. Although it can require
up to 117 units of coursework, students
can still go abroad, especially for in
ternships that the University hopes to
make available.
Assoc. Prof, of Philosophy Michael

Bratman was particularly dissatisfied
with the structure of the major because
of its apparent absence of any sort of
philosophy course. Political Science
Prof. Robert Ward, who was explaining
the program to the senate, conceded
that although it would be better to in
clude a philosophy course, ethics were
covered in other coursework and there
were already too many units required to
expect more work done. These objec
tions, in addition to objections to the
extensive requirements of the program,
caused the senate to vote on whether
they would even vote to approve the
major. Not only'did they vote to vote,
but in the second voting they approved
it.
The government will probably continue to provide in
direct recovery costs for research projects, saving the Uni
versity $2.2 million dollars, University President Donald
Kennedy told the Faculty Senate yesterday.
This, and the approval of a proposed masters program in
International Policy Studies, were principal topics of dis
cussion during the meeting.
The dispute over indirect cost recovery on research grants
arose in March when the Department of Health and Human
Services proposed in its 1983 budget to pay only 90 percent
of indirect costs. Indirect costs are the overhead costs of re
search projects and will account for 69 percent of the total
research costs in the University's 1982-1983 fiscal year
budget. A 10 percent cut in indirect cost funding would cost
the University more than $2.2 million out of the general
fund.
"It now appears that 10 percent cut will not be im
plemented," said Kennedy. "The Congress has included in
the continuing resolution additional funds to the Depart
ment of HHS to cover full payment of indirect costs and lan
guage requiring the department to continue supporting re
search under current terms and conditions. In addition, the
House Appropriations Committee yesterday, in its 1983

HHS appropriations bill, explicitly directed the department
to pay full indirect cost."
Kennedy also made it clear that caution must be taken in
evaluating the situation. "The continuing resolution is in
conference today; it could be vetoed by the president. The
appropriations process is still underway and will not be com
plete before the lame duck session, if then. We cannot be sure
of the final decision until we receive written confirmation
from the department."
Although Kennedy had little progress to report on strike
negotiations, he emphasized to the senate that the University
was in no way responsible for the strike. "We began our ne
gotiation from a realistic level and made improvements in
our offer in such a way as to signal clearly what our final
