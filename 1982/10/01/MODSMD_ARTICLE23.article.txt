# Giants pull to within one with 9th-inning win
## 
### Associated Press 
Pinch-hitter Ron Pruitt drove
in two runs with a bases-loaded
bloop single to center field — his
first hit of the season — climax
ing the San Francisco Giants'
second comeback of the game
and giving them a vital 7-6 vic
tory over the Houston Astros last
night.
The Giants trail first-place At
lanta by one game in the Na
tional League West race, and San
Francisco has just three games
remaining — all here against the
Dodgers, who are tied with San
Francisco.
Elsewhere, Los Angeles beat
the Braves 10-3. Baltimore
moved three games behind Mil
waukee edging Detroit 6-5 while

Boston ripped the Brewers 9-4.
Pruitt hit a 3-1 pitch from re
liever Dave Smith, scoring Dar
rell Evans and Jeff Leonard.
Pruitt was the second batter to
face Smith, who relieved Dan
Boone, 1-1, with two out and
runners at first and second.
Evans had walked and
Leonard had singled. Smith then
walked pinch-hitter Jim
Wohlford before facing Pruitt.
The win went to Gary Lavelle,
10-7, the sixth Giants' pitcher.
Dusty Baker's two-run single
highlighted a four-run outburst
in the seventh inning last night as
the Los Angeles Dodgers pulled
away for a 10-3 victory over At
lanta that put them within one
game of the Braves in the Na

tional League West.
The triumph snapped an eight
game losing streak for the
Dodgers, who would have been
all but mathematically
eliminated from the race if they
had lost. Both the Braves and the
Dodgers have three games re
maining, as do the still-contend
ing San Francisco Giants.

Diego this weekend, while the
Dodgers and Giants square off in
San Francisco to close out the
