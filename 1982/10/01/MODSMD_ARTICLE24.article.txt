# Official Daily, KZSU picks with guest greek
## 
### 
Guest Greek is a weekly feature of the Daily,
where we find some unsuspecting soul to put his
predictive powers on the line against the greek
gods, sports editors Steve Odell and Sid Spaeth.
Also on the weekly slate is KZSU sports director
Tom Kohn and the Latest Line from Las Vegas.

Today's games
OSU at Stanford
San Jose St. at Cal

This week's Guest Greek is Tom Eggers, sports
editor of the Oregon State Daily Barometer.
Eggers's winless Beavers invade Stanford Stadium
tomorrow, but he is the first to admit they are
heavy underdogs. (He picks the Cardinal by 26.)
See his other picks, as well as ours below.
