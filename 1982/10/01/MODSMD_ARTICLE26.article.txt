CASA REAL
721 El Camino Real
326-0959
No one with a true California
culinary palate can resist a visit
south of the border. And no true
college student can resist the in
expensive faire offered at the
many Mexican restaurants in the
area.
Probably the closest, yet one of
the best less-expensive restau
rants around would have to be
Casa Real. Sitting right on El
Camino Real between University
and Embarcadero, Casa Real
provides a quick getaway for
those taco and enchilada lovers.
Mexican tunes from an out
door speaker greet dinner guests
as they enter from the back park
ing lots. The restaurant offers
both indoor and patio dining.
Though located right along busy
El Camino Real, the patio still of
fers a pleasant respite to enjoy a
delicious dinner.
Entrees may be purchased as
combination plates which come
with refried beans and a salad or
just ala carte. Prices range from
$6.25 to $6.75 for combination
plates and from $2 to $3.95 for
ala carte dishes. Free nachos and
hot sauce are also served but the
guacamole appetizer is a must for
those who enjoy such delicacies.

As for the main course, all of
the expected Mexican dishes are
included on Casa Real's menu of
"authentic homemade Mexican
food." Tacos and enchiladas are
great for the not-so-daring but a
personal favorite is the
chimichanga. This crisp, deep
fried burrito includes a choice of
pork or beef as well as sour
cream, guacamole, cheese, let
tuce and tomato.
Service is always above aver
age at Casa Real and can be ex
ceptional when the owner, Mario
Raddavero, waits on your table.
Always recommending the best
dishes — which usually turn out
to be higher-priced as well —
Mario gives advice which should
be well taken. A dinner always
seems to taste better when it
comes with exceptional service.
While the meal is always en
joyable at Casa Real, probably
the best part of the evening is
when the check comes. Though
the dinners are moderately
priced, students can also receive a
25 percent discount if they have a
green Consolidated Students As
sociation savings cards available
from the ASSU.
Casa Real is open for lunch
and dinner from 11:30 a.m. until
9 p.m.
