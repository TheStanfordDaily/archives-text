# Pizza anyone?

MOUNTAIN MIKE'S 2000
El Camino Real Palo Alto
857-0877
Mountain Mike's attracts a va
riety of people for lunch — at one
time, a group of businessmen, a
few bikers, a group of 11-year
olds who must have an "open
campus" policy at their elemen
tary school and three Stanford
students.
We decided to try their lunch
eon special (served until 5 p.m.),
the Pizza Sandwich. For only
$2.50 each we received our choice
of three pizza items atop an open
face french roll. We all agreed
that the sandwich was as good as,
or even better than, their pizza.
Aside from pizza (ranging
from $4.50 for a small, one-item
pizza to $10.95 for a large com
bination pizza), Mountain
Mike's also offers a large selec
tion of grilled and oven-baked
sandwiches for less than $3 each.
If you go for dinner (or after
the football game) you're sure to
Find more Stanford students than
we did at lunch. You may also
find more friends at all-you-can
eat night every Wednesday from
6 to 9 p.m. for only $3.50 per per
son.
Mountain Mike's, located at
the corner of El Camino Real and
Stanford Avenue, is within easy
biking distance. Thev are open
until 12:30 a.m. on weeknights
and I a.m. on weekends. (And be
sure to bring extra change for the
jukebox.)

RAMONA'S
541 Ramona Street
Palo Alto
326-2220
Ramona's, the forefather of
Ramona's Too, has long been a

Stanford tradition. Taking
Ramona's out of Palo Alto
would be just as bad (well,
almost) as taking the cable cars
out of San Francisco.
Fortunately, though,
Ramona's is still alive and well in
Palo Alto.
/
So much has been written
about Ramona's in the past that
anything I could say would be re
dundant. And if you haven't read
about Ramona's in the paper
before, you'll surely hear about it
from one of your neighbors
before long.
However, I will just remind
you to get there early to avoid the
wait. But, if you happen to be one
of those waiting in the foyer,
don't worry — it's worth the
wait.
We ordered our usual strom
boli pizza ($6.34 for a small)
topped with salami, pepperoni,
sausage and mushrooms. It was
delicious as usual, and piled so
high with topping that we had to
eat it with a fork.
If pizza alone is not enough for
you, Ramona's also has an ample
salad bar which is $2.11 for a very
small bowl and $3.05 for a larger
bowl.
Ramona's also has a full range
of submarine-style sandwiches
and hamburgers — each for less
than $4.
Ramona's is open until 10 p.m.
on Sunday and Monday, 11 p.m.
on Tuesday through Thursday,
and midnight on Friday and Sat
urday.
