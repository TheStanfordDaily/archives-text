## Bike to an ice creamery 
### KAREN SPRINGEN 
What's the "scoop" on ice cream parlors
within biking distance? The Palo Alto area
boasts several parlors featuring many varieties
of the frozen delicacy.
A random sampling of some local ice
creameries indicates that single dip cones run
just less than $1 and oreo seems to be the most
popular flavor — but the similarities among
parlors end there.
