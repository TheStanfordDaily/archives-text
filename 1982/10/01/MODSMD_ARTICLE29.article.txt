One of Stanford's many cul
tural advantages is the choice of
two pizza delivery services: Dom
ino's (anvone remember Pizza
Express?) and Ramona's Too,
the take-out sidekick of the ori
ginal Ramona's in downtown
Palo Alto. However, the choice
also means (especially for you
rookies) the often-agonizing de
cision: which pizza?
Which service is cheaper de
pends on the size you order. It
works out that for the 12-inch
(small) size, Ramona's is actually
less expensive, while on the other

end of the scale, Domino's large
pizzas are cheaper by a long shot.
Be warned, however, that
Ramona's prices are going up 50
cents across the board in a week
or so ("It's been a long time,"
they said), which means the small
pies will cost more or less the
same.
Remember the good old days
when Domino's came with free
Pepsi? No more. This year you'll
have to buy a 12-ounce plastic
tub (suitable for entertaining) for
25 cents. Ramona's paper cups
cost a quarter more.
Saturday night we called up
Ramona's and Domino's simul
taneously, and ordered two "test
pizzas." Domino's promise
they'll get to you in less than thir
ty minutes ("fastest delivery in
town!" the manager said), and
they came through in style: a

mere 21 minutes later a young
ladv in that familiar but tacky
red-white-and-blue uniform was
at the door.
Ramona's entree didn't arrive
for another half-hour. Ordering
from them requires the skill of es
timating (about an hour in ad
vance) when those "munchies"
are going to strike. Otherwise,
look forward to a long wait. Also
be prepared to meet them in the
street outside vour dorm — they
don't deliver to vour door. They
don't wear uniforms either.
So it was well past 7 p.m. when
we finally got to judge the two
products. Ramona's Too calls
theirs "New York Style" — the
restaurant said that meant
"thicker around the edges" (sort
of like a lot of New Yorkers, I
suppose).
Anyone who's been around

Stanford for even a little while
will probably tell you that
Ramona's is generally regarded
as the better pizza. The crust is
thick and a little doughy, plus the
folks here tend to be far more lib
eral with theirs than their cross
town rivals. Frankly, we couldn't
see the cheese (both restaurants
use mozzarella, by the way) for
all the sausage and mushrooms
piled on top. The mushrooms
were in such great numbers, in
fact, that they were almost over
powering. All their ingredients
were fresh, whereas we were fair
ly convinced that those a half
hour earlier had been of the
canned variety. Both arrived
steaming hot.
I've long been of the opinion
that it's next to impossible to
make a bad pizza. With that in
mind, Domino's certainly isn't
bad — just sort of, well, "un

inspiring." On the other hand,
Ramona's can be a little too rich
for some people. It can fill you up
rather quickly, and a lot of pizza
veterans genuinely prefer the
standard, thin-crust fare of Dom
inos.
So there you have it. I've inten
tionally avoided committing my
self to which is the better overall,
because we all have our individ
ual tastes, and besides, sooner or
later (if you haven't already)
you'll probably establish a per
sonal favorite. Until then, my
best advice is to pick up your tele
phone and judge for yourself.
Domino's takes orders until 2
a.m. on the weekends, and I a.m.
during the week. Ramona's Too
closes up shop at one and mid
night respectively.
