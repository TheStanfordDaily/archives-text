# Strike talks break off; no end in sight
## 
### JULIE KAUFMANN Senior staff writer 
There is no settlement in sight for the strike of University
technical, maintenance and service workers after a meeting
with chief negotiators and federal mediators broke off yes
terday afternoon.
"The mediators explored a number of directons" with
University Counsel Priscilla Wheeler and Michael Baratz,
United Stanford Workers executive secretary, but at meet
ing's end, "there was no indication of a possibility of settle
ment," Federal Mediator Clarence Washington said last
night.
No further meetings are scheduled.
Washington said he and mediator Dorothy Christianson
would continue to touch base with Wheeler and Baratz.
"Both sides are subject to recall by the mediators at a later
time," he said.
"It was a confidential meeting to explore avenues of reso
lution," Wheeler said after the two-and-a-half-hour con
ference. "None was attractive to the University or the
union."
The San Francisco meeting was "a failure," Union Field
Representative K jthv McKennan told the Daily last night as
Baratz relayed the same news to his 12-member negotiating
team. "It just became clear that Stanford is out to bust the

union."
The union hoped to block University deliveries early this
morning with rallies at Bonair Siding, the Medical Center
and the Stanford Linear Accelerator, McKennan said. "It
will be a a show of unity and force to show that we are serious
about our demands," she said. "There are going to be be
tween 60 and 100 people at each site."
The round-the-clock vigil in front of University President
Donald Kennedy's campus home is continuing, she said.
Union plans call for two to eight members to camp out on
the Kennedv lawn until the strike is settled.
The strike entered its 22nd day today, becoming the long
est ever against the University. A 1974 strike by USW's pred
ecessor United Stanford Employees lasted 21 days — from
May 13 to June 4. Mediator Washington, on duty at yester
day's meeting, was involved in that strike's settlement.
Stanford police settled an argument between strikers and
a delivery truck driver near Tresidder Union yesterday after
noon. "It was a minimum disturbance," said Patrol Capt.
Marvin Moore. No arrests were made.
The number of strike-related incidents varies daily,
Moore said. "It goes up and down. A couple of days will pass
with no problems, then it will tie us up all day." All officers
are working 12-hour shifts to handle the extra calls.
