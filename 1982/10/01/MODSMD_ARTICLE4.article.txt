Marine killed at Beirut airport
Beirut, Lebanon — An unexploded part of a cluster bomb blew up at
Beirut airport yesterday, killing one U.S. Marine and wounding three others
who tripped on it. U.S. military spokesmen said.
The casualties were reported after several hundred Marines waded ashore
to help guard the field just reopened by President Amin Gemayel.
One of the survivors was in serious condition with groin injuries and the
other two were slightly wounded, the spokesmen said.
The casualties were the first suffered by the Marines since they deployed in
Beirut this summer to help oversee the evacuation of Palestine Liberation
Organization guerrillas from the Israeli-ringed city. The Marines returned
Wednesday on their second peacekeeping mission.
President Reagan reacted with "shock and sorrow," but said the casual
ties would have no effect on the U.S. commitment to remain in Lebanon un
til Israeli and Syrian troops are out and the government is in control, White
House Deputy Press Secretary Larry Spcakes said in Washington.
Gemayel officially opened the airport after a nearly four-month shutdown
following a ceremony before U.S., Italian and French peacekeeping forces in
which he proclaimed Lebanon's capital a "unified city," free of Israeli troops
in both the Moslem western sector and the Christian east.
A red and white Middle East Airlines jet, with Lebanon's flag flying from
the cockpit window, landed at the airport to the applause and cheers of
about 300 bystanders, who tearfully embraced relatives setting foot on their
native soil for the first time since Israel invaded June 6.
Hours after the jet touched down, an explosion rocked the southwest end
of the runway nearest the Mediterranean. The blast occurred at about 4:45
p.m. (7:45 a.m. PDT).
Marine Lt. Gregory van Houten said the explosion occurred when the
men tripped on part or parts of a cluster bomb, an anti-personnel weapon.
Vote scheduled for budget amendment
Washington — House Democratic leaders, scrambling to avoid giving Re
publicans a hot campaign issue, scheduled a showdown vote for today on a
constitutional amendment mandating a balanced federal budget.
The tally was expected to be close.
