Marine killed at Beirut airport
Beirut, Lebanon — An unexploded part of a cluster bomb blew up at
Beirut airport yesterday, killing one U.S. Marine and wounding three others
who tripped on it. U.S. military spokesmen said.
The casualties were reported after several hundred Marines waded ashore
to help guard the field just reopened by President Amin Gemayel.
One of the survivors was in serious condition with groin injuries and the
other two were slightly wounded, the spokesmen said.
The casualties were the first suffered by the Marines since they deployed in
Beirut this summer to help oversee the evacuation of Palestine Liberation
Organization guerrillas from the Israeli-ringed city. The Marines returned
Wednesday on their second peacekeeping mission.
President Reagan reacted with "shock and sorrow," but said the casual
ties would have no effect on the U.S. commitment to remain in Lebanon un
til Israeli and Syrian troops are out and the government is in control, White
House Deputy Press Secretary Larry Spcakes said in Washington.
Gemayel officially opened the airport after a nearly four-month shutdown
following a ceremony before U.S., Italian and French peacekeeping forces in
which he proclaimed Lebanon's capital a "unified city," free of Israeli troops
in both the Moslem western sector and the Christian east.
A red and white Middle East Airlines jet, with Lebanon's flag flying from
the cockpit window, landed at the airport to the applause and cheers of
about 300 bystanders, who tearfully embraced relatives setting foot on their
native soil for the first time since Israel invaded June 6.
Hours after the jet touched down, an explosion rocked the southwest end
of the runway nearest the Mediterranean. The blast occurred at about 4:45
p.m. (7:45 a.m. PDT).
Marine Lt. Gregory van Houten said the explosion occurred when the
men tripped on part or parts of a cluster bomb, an anti-personnel weapon.
Vote scheduled for budget amendment
Washington — House Democratic leaders, scrambling to avoid giving Re
publicans a hot campaign issue, scheduled a showdown vote for today on a
constitutional amendment mandating a balanced federal budget.
The tally was expected to be close.
President Reagan, who helped recruit signatures on a
House petition that forced the Democrats to end their
stalling tactics, made a trip to Capitol Hill yesterday af
ternoon to appeal for adoption of the Senate-passed
amendment. He expressed unhappiness that Democrats
"may try to sabotage" the amendment "by an 11 th-hour
sleight of hand."
"This is no time to subvert the will of the Congress and
the vast majority of the people," Reagan told a group of
about 100 House supporters of the amendment.
Reagan was referring to an effort by Democratic lead
ers to drain crucial votes from the amendment by offering
a less-restrictive substitute measure. The Democratic
substitute was expected to be proposed constitutional
amendment, that would aim for a balanced federal
budget but include more escape hatches than the Reagan
backed plan.
The substitute would serve the key political purpose of
allowing House members who oppose the constitutional
amendment — but are fearful of voting against a bal
anced budget in the face of soaring deficits — to tell con
stituents thev voted for an alternative that carried a bal
anced-budget label.
House Speaker Thomas "Tip" O'Neill (D-Mass.) an
grily called Reagan's involvement in the issue "a blatant
political act." He indicated that he had scheduled the
vote for today to deny the president the opportunity to
call Congress into a special pre-election session after
criticizing Democratic inaction. Congress plans to ad
journ today until after the Nov. 2 elections.
Sharon foresaw potential massacre
Jerusalem — Israeli Defense Minister Ariel Sharon ex
pressed grave concern that Christian Phalangist
militiamen would massacre Palestinian civilians shortly
before he ordered the Israeli army to send the Phalange
militia units into the Shatila and Sabra refugee camps in
West Beirut, it was learned yesterday.
The predictions of a potential bloodbath were de
scribed as having been made while Sharon and other sen
ior Israeli officials were pressing for the dispatch of regu
lar Lebanese army units into the refugee neighborhoods
to root out the remaining armed Palestinian guerrillas.
They argued that the assassination of the Phalangist lead
er, Lebanese President-elect Bashir Gemayel, greatly in
creased the danger that the Christian militiamen would
renew their attacks on the Palestinians.
The expression of concern by Sharon was disclosed to
The Washington Post on condition that the precise details
of the conversation including the defense minister would
hot be disclosed. The account was authoritative, how

ever.
Sharon has publicly maintained that he and other Is
raeli officials never dreamed that the Phalange's militia
units would go on a rampage of indiscriminate killing
once they were inside the camps. But well-informed
sources said the defense minister and Chief of Staff
Rafael Eitan raised the prospect of just such a slaughter
the night of Sept. 16.
On that night, with the blessing of Prime Minister
Menachem Begin and the Israeli Cabinet, Israeli army
units in West Beirut were ordered to assist the Phalangist
militiamen in entering Shatila and Sabra.
Sharon's spokesman, Uri Dan, did not return phone
calls about Sharon's and Eitan's warnings.
Sources said Lebanese army commanders were willing
to order their own units into the camps but said that they
could not do so without authorization from their govern
ment. Thev said the chief impediment to allowing the reg
ular army into the refugee areas was Lebanese Prime
Minister Shafik Wassan, who apparently feared an ad
verse reaction in Lebanon's Moslem community if the
army units, generally commanded by Christian officers,
were to take over the Palestinian neighborhoods.
Congress delays spending action
Washington — Opting instead for an evening of politi
cal partying. Congress abandoned its race against the
clock yesterday to keep the government from going broke
upon the midnight start of the new fiscal year.
But negotiators for the House and Senate said they ex
pected a compromise spending measure would be ready
for swift approval today morning, and a Reagan adminis
tration spokesman said there probably would be no inter
ruption of regular government operations.
Congressional leaders decided against a late-night ses
sion to pass the measure on an evening when major social
events wert: scheduled for both Democrats and Re
publicans.
The Democratic party had a $1000-per-person fun
draising dinner that many members of Congress were ex
pected to attend. And President Reagan invited the entire
Congress to a barbecue at the White House in what
amounted to a counter-event dominated by Republicans.
House Speaker Thomas "Tip" O'Neill (D-Mass) did
not mention either social function when he told reporters
that negotiators for the two houses estimated that no
compromise bill would be ready for floor action until
shortly after the midnight deadline.
Edwin Dale, a spokesman at the Office of Man
agement and Budget, said no disruptions in operations
were likely, as long as the compromise that is reached is

acceptable to Reagan.
Dale said all government agencies were notified earlier
in the day to prepare to begin "shutdown" operations to
dav.
But he said that if the compromise measure appears to
merit Reagan's approval, agencies will be told today to
continue business as usual. In any event, he said, all feder
al workers are expected to be on the job today.
This measure is needed because Reagan has not yet re
ceived any of the 13 regular money bills needed to finance
the government's operations for the new fiscal year,
which begins today.
Shultz calls for action in Lebanon
United Nations — Secretary of State George Shultz
called on Israel and Arab nations yesterday to accept
President Reagan's proposal to join in peace negotiations
and end the Middle East conflict that is "a searing wound
on our consciousness."
He also told the General Assembly the Palestinian peo
ple have an "undeniable" claim to a homeland, "a place
with which they can truly identify."
Shultz did not directly criticize Israel, which rejected
the Reagan initiative. But he said there can be no peace
for Israel until the "legitimate rights" of the Palestinians
are met.
"Of the nations in the world which need and deserve
peace, Israel surely holds a pre-eminent place," Shultz
said. "Of the peoples of the world who need and deserve a
place with which they can truly identify, the Palestinian
claim is undeniable."
The secretary said there is "no contradiction between
permanent peace for Israel and the legitimate rights of the
Palestinian people. Neither can be achieved without the
other."
Shultz devoted a major part of his first speech to the
General Assembly to the Mideast crisis. He spoke after
Israel's foreign minister, Yitzhak Shamir, voiced new
criticism of the Reagan plan.
Five die of cyanide poisoning
Arlington Heights, 111. — Five people in suburban Chi
cago died after swallowing capsules of Extra-Strength
Tylenol, and cyanide poisoning was known or strongly
suspected as the cause, authorities said yesterday.
The manufacturer recalled nearly 4.7 million of the
capsules and authorities said the case was being in
vestigated as "possible homicide."
A sixth person was near death from cyanide poisoning.
The series began with the deaths Wednesday of two

brothers in the western suburb of Arlington Heights and
a 12-vear-old girl in the neighboring community of Elk
Grove Village.
The wife of one of the brothers was hospitalized in ex
tremely critical condition after taking a capsule of the
medication, which is the nation's best-selling over-the
counter pain reliever. Doctors said her brain had suffered
"a great deal of damage" and she was not expected to I
live. 2;
In nearby Downers Grove, Mary McFarland, 31, of
Elmhurst, was dead on arrival last afternoon at Good
Samaritan Hospital, where she was rushed after taking •»'
Extra-Strength Tvlenol. Hospital spokeswoman Donna
Hartigan said the symptoms resembled cyanide poison
ing but coroner's tests were under way.
To the southwest in the suburb of Winfield, Mimi
Stewart, a spokeswoman at Central DuPage Hospital,
said Mary Reiner, 27, who had taken Extra-Strength 2;
Tylenol, died last morning of symptoms resembling
cyanide poisoning. She said a definite cause would have
to await the coroner's report.
Authorities said the cyanide was probably introduced
sometime after the capsules left the plant in Fort Wash- >
ington, Pa., where they are manufactured by McNeil
Consumer Products Co. The poison is not used in pro- *
duction of the medicine.
Stocks nose downward
The stock market suffered its second broad loss in a
row yesterday, leaving the Dow Jones industrial average
below 900 for the first time in four weeks.
Analysts said the declines appeared to reflect waning
hopes for any impending recovery from the recession.
The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials, which fell
13.06 Wednesday, dropped 10.02 to 896.25. Since Sept.
21 the average has fallen more than 38 points.
Volume on the New York Stock Exchange totaled
62.61 million shares, against 62.55 million Wednesday.
Stock prices began to slide Wednesday in selling at
tributed to second thoughts among many traders about
their hopes for a business recovery in the next few
months.
Today's weather
Sunny and a little warmer today. Highs in the mid-to
upper 70s. Northwest winds to 15 mph in the afternoon.
Tonight and tomorrow fair. Lows in the upper 40s and
50s. Warmer tomorrow with highs from the mid-70s to

Marine killed at Beirut airport
Beirut, Lebanon — An unexploded part of a cluster bomb blew up at
Beirut airport yesterday, killing one U.S. Marine and wounding three others
who tripped on it. U.S. military spokesmen said.
The casualties were reported after several hundred Marines waded ashore
to help guard the field just reopened by President Amin Gemayel.
One of the survivors was in serious condition with groin injuries and the
other two were slightly wounded, the spokesmen said.
The casualties were the first suffered by the Marines since they deployed in
Beirut this summer to help oversee the evacuation of Palestine Liberation
Organization guerrillas from the Israeli-ringed city. The Marines returned
Wednesday on their second peacekeeping mission.
President Reagan reacted with "shock and sorrow," but said the casual
ties would have no effect on the U.S. commitment to remain in Lebanon un
til Israeli and Syrian troops are out and the government is in control, White
House Deputy Press Secretary Larry Spcakes said in Washington.
Gemayel officially opened the airport after a nearly four-month shutdown
following a ceremony before U.S., Italian and French peacekeeping forces in
which he proclaimed Lebanon's capital a "unified city," free of Israeli troops
in both the Moslem western sector and the Christian east.
A red and white Middle East Airlines jet, with Lebanon's flag flying from
the cockpit window, landed at the airport to the applause and cheers of
about 300 bystanders, who tearfully embraced relatives setting foot on their
native soil for the first time since Israel invaded June 6.
Hours after the jet touched down, an explosion rocked the southwest end
of the runway nearest the Mediterranean. The blast occurred at about 4:45
p.m. (7:45 a.m. PDT).
Marine Lt. Gregory van Houten said the explosion occurred when the
men tripped on part or parts of a cluster bomb, an anti-personnel weapon.
Vote scheduled for budget amendment
Washington — House Democratic leaders, scrambling to avoid giving Re
publicans a hot campaign issue, scheduled a showdown vote for today on a
constitutional amendment mandating a balanced federal budget.
The tally was expected to be close.
President Reagan, who helped recruit signatures on a
House petition that forced the Democrats to end their
stalling tactics, made a trip to Capitol Hill yesterday af
ternoon to appeal for adoption of the Senate-passed
amendment. He expressed unhappiness that Democrats
"may try to sabotage" the amendment "by an 11 th-hour
sleight of hand."
"This is no time to subvert the will of the Congress and
the vast majority of the people," Reagan told a group of
about 100 House supporters of the amendment.
Reagan was referring to an effort by Democratic lead
ers to drain crucial votes from the amendment by offering
a less-restrictive substitute measure. The Democratic
substitute was expected to be proposed constitutional
amendment, that would aim for a balanced federal
budget but include more escape hatches than the Reagan
backed plan.
The substitute would serve the key political purpose of
allowing House members who oppose the constitutional
amendment — but are fearful of voting against a bal
anced budget in the face of soaring deficits — to tell con
stituents thev voted for an alternative that carried a bal
anced-budget label.
House Speaker Thomas "Tip" O'Neill (D-Mass.) an
grily called Reagan's involvement in the issue "a blatant
political act." He indicated that he had scheduled the
vote for today to deny the president the opportunity to
call Congress into a special pre-election session after
criticizing Democratic inaction. Congress plans to ad
journ today until after the Nov. 2 elections.
Sharon foresaw potential massacre
Jerusalem — Israeli Defense Minister Ariel Sharon ex
pressed grave concern that Christian Phalangist
militiamen would massacre Palestinian civilians shortly
before he ordered the Israeli army to send the Phalange
militia units into the Shatila and Sabra refugee camps in
West Beirut, it was learned yesterday.
The predictions of a potential bloodbath were de
scribed as having been made while Sharon and other sen
ior Israeli officials were pressing for the dispatch of regu
lar Lebanese army units into the refugee neighborhoods
to root out the remaining armed Palestinian guerrillas.
They argued that the assassination of the Phalangist lead
er, Lebanese President-elect Bashir Gemayel, greatly in
creased the danger that the Christian militiamen would
renew their attacks on the Palestinians.
The expression of concern by Sharon was disclosed to
The Washington Post on condition that the precise details
of the conversation including the defense minister would
hot be disclosed. The account was authoritative, how

ever.
Sharon has publicly maintained that he and other Is
raeli officials never dreamed that the Phalange's militia
units would go on a rampage of indiscriminate killing
once they were inside the camps. But well-informed
sources said the defense minister and Chief of Staff
Rafael Eitan raised the prospect of just such a slaughter
the night of Sept. 16.
On that night, with the blessing of Prime Minister
Menachem Begin and the Israeli Cabinet, Israeli army
units in West Beirut were ordered to assist the Phalangist
militiamen in entering Shatila and Sabra.
Sharon's spokesman, Uri Dan, did not return phone
calls about Sharon's and Eitan's warnings.
Sources said Lebanese army commanders were willing
to order their own units into the camps but said that they
could not do so without authorization from their govern
ment. Thev said the chief impediment to allowing the reg
ular army into the refugee areas was Lebanese Prime
Minister Shafik Wassan, who apparently feared an ad
verse reaction in Lebanon's Moslem community if the
army units, generally commanded by Christian officers,
were to take over the Palestinian neighborhoods.
Congress delays spending action
Washington — Opting instead for an evening of politi
cal partying. Congress abandoned its race against the
clock yesterday to keep the government from going broke
upon the midnight start of the new fiscal year.
But negotiators for the House and Senate said they ex
pected a compromise spending measure would be ready
for swift approval today morning, and a Reagan adminis
tration spokesman said there probably would be no inter
ruption of regular government operations.
Congressional leaders decided against a late-night ses
sion to pass the measure on an evening when major social
events wert: scheduled for both Democrats and Re
publicans.
The Democratic party had a $1000-per-person fun
draising dinner that many members of Congress were ex
pected to attend. And President Reagan invited the entire
Congress to a barbecue at the White House in what
amounted to a counter-event dominated by Republicans.
House Speaker Thomas "Tip" O'Neill (D-Mass) did
not mention either social function when he told reporters
that negotiators for the two houses estimated that no
compromise bill would be ready for floor action until
shortly after the midnight deadline.
Edwin Dale, a spokesman at the Office of Man
agement and Budget, said no disruptions in operations
were likely, as long as the compromise that is reached is

acceptable to Reagan.
Dale said all government agencies were notified earlier
in the day to prepare to begin "shutdown" operations to
dav.
But he said that if the compromise measure appears to
merit Reagan's approval, agencies will be told today to
continue business as usual. In any event, he said, all feder
al workers are expected to be on the job today.
This measure is needed because Reagan has not yet re
ceived any of the 13 regular money bills needed to finance
the government's operations for the new fiscal year,
which begins today.
Shultz calls for action in Lebanon
United Nations — Secretary of State George Shultz
called on Israel and Arab nations yesterday to accept
President Reagan's proposal to join in peace negotiations
and end the Middle East conflict that is "a searing wound
on our consciousness."
He also told the General Assembly the Palestinian peo
ple have an "undeniable" claim to a homeland, "a place
with which they can truly identify."
Shultz did not directly criticize Israel, which rejected
the Reagan initiative. But he said there can be no peace
for Israel until the "legitimate rights" of the Palestinians
are met.
"Of the nations in the world which need and deserve
peace, Israel surely holds a pre-eminent place," Shultz
said. "Of the peoples of the world who need and deserve a
place with which they can truly identify, the Palestinian
claim is undeniable."
The secretary said there is "no contradiction between
permanent peace for Israel and the legitimate rights of the
Palestinian people. Neither can be achieved without the
other."
Shultz devoted a major part of his first speech to the
General Assembly to the Mideast crisis. He spoke after
Israel's foreign minister, Yitzhak Shamir, voiced new
criticism of the Reagan plan.
Five die of cyanide poisoning
Arlington Heights, 111. — Five people in suburban Chi
cago died after swallowing capsules of Extra-Strength
Tylenol, and cyanide poisoning was known or strongly
suspected as the cause, authorities said yesterday.
The manufacturer recalled nearly 4.7 million of the
capsules and authorities said the case was being in
vestigated as "possible homicide."
A sixth person was near death from cyanide poisoning.
The series began with the deaths Wednesday of two

brothers in the western suburb of Arlington Heights and
a 12-vear-old girl in the neighboring community of Elk
Grove Village.
The wife of one of the brothers was hospitalized in ex
tremely critical condition after taking a capsule of the
medication, which is the nation's best-selling over-the
counter pain reliever. Doctors said her brain had suffered
"a great deal of damage" and she was not expected to I
live. 2;
In nearby Downers Grove, Mary McFarland, 31, of
Elmhurst, was dead on arrival last afternoon at Good
Samaritan Hospital, where she was rushed after taking •»'
Extra-Strength Tvlenol. Hospital spokeswoman Donna
Hartigan said the symptoms resembled cyanide poison
ing but coroner's tests were under way.
To the southwest in the suburb of Winfield, Mimi
Stewart, a spokeswoman at Central DuPage Hospital,
said Mary Reiner, 27, who had taken Extra-Strength 2;
Tylenol, died last morning of symptoms resembling
cyanide poisoning. She said a definite cause would have
to await the coroner's report.

Five die of cyanide poisoning
Arlington Heights, 111. — Five people in suburban Chi
cago died after swallowing capsules of Extra-Strength
Tylenol, and cyanide poisoning was known or strongly
suspected as the cause, authorities said yesterday.
The manufacturer recalled nearly 4.7 million of the
capsules and authorities said the case was being in
vestigated as "possible homicide."
A sixth person was near death from cyanide poisoning.
The series began with the deaths Wednesday of two

brothers in the western suburb of Arlington Heights and
a 12-vear-old girl in the neighboring community of Elk
Grove Village.
The wife of one of the brothers was hospitalized in ex
tremely critical condition after taking a capsule of the
medication, which is the nation's best-selling over-the
counter pain reliever. Doctors said her brain had suffered
"a great deal of damage" and she was not expected to I
live. 2;
In nearby Downers Grove, Mary McFarland, 31, of
Elmhurst, was dead on arrival last afternoon at Good
Samaritan Hospital, where she was rushed after taking •»'
Extra-Strength Tvlenol. Hospital spokeswoman Donna
Hartigan said the symptoms resembled cyanide poison
ing but coroner's tests were under way.
To the southwest in the suburb of Winfield, Mimi
Stewart, a spokeswoman at Central DuPage Hospital,
said Mary Reiner, 27, who had taken Extra-Strength 2;
Tylenol, died last morning of symptoms resembling
cyanide poisoning. She said a definite cause would have
to await the coroner's report.
Authorities said the cyanide was probably introduced
sometime after the capsules left the plant in Fort Wash- >
ington, Pa., where they are manufactured by McNeil
Consumer Products Co. The poison is not used in pro- *
duction of the medicine.

Marine killed at Beirut airport
Beirut, Lebanon — An unexploded part of a cluster bomb blew up at
Beirut airport yesterday, killing one U.S. Marine and wounding three others
who tripped on it. U.S. military spokesmen said.
The casualties were reported after several hundred Marines waded ashore
to help guard the field just reopened by President Amin Gemayel.
One of the survivors was in serious condition with groin injuries and the
other two were slightly wounded, the spokesmen said.
The casualties were the first suffered by the Marines since they deployed in
Beirut this summer to help oversee the evacuation of Palestine Liberation
Organization guerrillas from the Israeli-ringed city. The Marines returned
Wednesday on their second peacekeeping mission.
President Reagan reacted with "shock and sorrow," but said the casual
ties would have no effect on the U.S. commitment to remain in Lebanon un
til Israeli and Syrian troops are out and the government is in control, White
House Deputy Press Secretary Larry Spcakes said in Washington.
Gemayel officially opened the airport after a nearly four-month shutdown
following a ceremony before U.S., Italian and French peacekeeping forces in
which he proclaimed Lebanon's capital a "unified city," free of Israeli troops
in both the Moslem western sector and the Christian east.
A red and white Middle East Airlines jet, with Lebanon's flag flying from
the cockpit window, landed at the airport to the applause and cheers of
about 300 bystanders, who tearfully embraced relatives setting foot on their
native soil for the first time since Israel invaded June 6.
Hours after the jet touched down, an explosion rocked the southwest end
of the runway nearest the Mediterranean. The blast occurred at about 4:45
p.m. (7:45 a.m. PDT).
Marine Lt. Gregory van Houten said the explosion occurred when the
men tripped on part or parts of a cluster bomb, an anti-personnel weapon.
Vote scheduled for budget amendment
Washington — House Democratic leaders, scrambling to avoid giving Re
publicans a hot campaign issue, scheduled a showdown vote for today on a
constitutional amendment mandating a balanced federal budget.
The tally was expected to be close.
President Reagan, who helped recruit signatures on a
House petition that forced the Democrats to end their
stalling tactics, made a trip to Capitol Hill yesterday af
ternoon to appeal for adoption of the Senate-passed
amendment. He expressed unhappiness that Democrats
"may try to sabotage" the amendment "by an 11 th-hour
sleight of hand."
"This is no time to subvert the will of the Congress and
the vast majority of the people," Reagan told a group of
about 100 House supporters of the amendment.
Reagan was referring to an effort by Democratic lead
ers to drain crucial votes from the amendment by offering
a less-restrictive substitute measure. The Democratic
substitute was expected to be proposed constitutional
amendment, that would aim for a balanced federal
budget but include more escape hatches than the Reagan
backed plan.
The substitute would serve the key political purpose of
allowing House members who oppose the constitutional
amendment — but are fearful of voting against a bal
anced budget in the face of soaring deficits — to tell con
stituents thev voted for an alternative that carried a bal
anced-budget label.
House Speaker Thomas "Tip" O'Neill (D-Mass.) an
grily called Reagan's involvement in the issue "a blatant
political act." He indicated that he had scheduled the
vote for today to deny the president the opportunity to
call Congress into a special pre-election session after
criticizing Democratic inaction. Congress plans to ad
journ today until after the Nov. 2 elections.
Sharon foresaw potential massacre
Jerusalem — Israeli Defense Minister Ariel Sharon ex
pressed grave concern that Christian Phalangist
militiamen would massacre Palestinian civilians shortly
before he ordered the Israeli army to send the Phalange
militia units into the Shatila and Sabra refugee camps in
West Beirut, it was learned yesterday.
The predictions of a potential bloodbath were de
scribed as having been made while Sharon and other sen
ior Israeli officials were pressing for the dispatch of regu
lar Lebanese army units into the refugee neighborhoods
to root out the remaining armed Palestinian guerrillas.
They argued that the assassination of the Phalangist lead
er, Lebanese President-elect Bashir Gemayel, greatly in
creased the danger that the Christian militiamen would
renew their attacks on the Palestinians.
The expression of concern by Sharon was disclosed to
The Washington Post on condition that the precise details
of the conversation including the defense minister would
hot be disclosed. The account was authoritative, how

ever.
Sharon has publicly maintained that he and other Is
raeli officials never dreamed that the Phalange's militia
units would go on a rampage of indiscriminate killing
once they were inside the camps. But well-informed
sources said the defense minister and Chief of Staff
Rafael Eitan raised the prospect of just such a slaughter
the night of Sept. 16.
On that night, with the blessing of Prime Minister
Menachem Begin and the Israeli Cabinet, Israeli army
units in West Beirut were ordered to assist the Phalangist
militiamen in entering Shatila and Sabra.
Sharon's spokesman, Uri Dan, did not return phone
calls about Sharon's and Eitan's warnings.
Sources said Lebanese army commanders were willing
to order their own units into the camps but said that they
could not do so without authorization from their govern
ment. Thev said the chief impediment to allowing the reg
ular army into the refugee areas was Lebanese Prime
Minister Shafik Wassan, who apparently feared an ad
verse reaction in Lebanon's Moslem community if the
army units, generally commanded by Christian officers,
were to take over the Palestinian neighborhoods.
Congress delays spending action
Washington — Opting instead for an evening of politi
cal partying. Congress abandoned its race against the
clock yesterday to keep the government from going broke
upon the midnight start of the new fiscal year.
But negotiators for the House and Senate said they ex
pected a compromise spending measure would be ready
for swift approval today morning, and a Reagan adminis
tration spokesman said there probably would be no inter
ruption of regular government operations.
Congressional leaders decided against a late-night ses
sion to pass the measure on an evening when major social
events wert: scheduled for both Democrats and Re
publicans.
The Democratic party had a $1000-per-person fun
draising dinner that many members of Congress were ex
pected to attend. And President Reagan invited the entire
Congress to a barbecue at the White House in what
amounted to a counter-event dominated by Republicans.
House Speaker Thomas "Tip" O'Neill (D-Mass) did
not mention either social function when he told reporters
that negotiators for the two houses estimated that no
compromise bill would be ready for floor action until
shortly after the midnight deadline.
Edwin Dale, a spokesman at the Office of Man
agement and Budget, said no disruptions in operations
were likely, as long as the compromise that is reached is

acceptable to Reagan.
Dale said all government agencies were notified earlier
in the day to prepare to begin "shutdown" operations to
dav.
But he said that if the compromise measure appears to
merit Reagan's approval, agencies will be told today to
continue business as usual. In any event, he said, all feder
al workers are expected to be on the job today.
This measure is needed because Reagan has not yet re
ceived any of the 13 regular money bills needed to finance
the government's operations for the new fiscal year,
which begins today.
Shultz calls for action in Lebanon
United Nations — Secretary of State George Shultz
called on Israel and Arab nations yesterday to accept
President Reagan's proposal to join in peace negotiations
and end the Middle East conflict that is "a searing wound
on our consciousness."
He also told the General Assembly the Palestinian peo
ple have an "undeniable" claim to a homeland, "a place
with which they can truly identify."
Shultz did not directly criticize Israel, which rejected
the Reagan initiative. But he said there can be no peace
for Israel until the "legitimate rights" of the Palestinians
are met.
"Of the nations in the world which need and deserve
peace, Israel surely holds a pre-eminent place," Shultz
said. "Of the peoples of the world who need and deserve a
place with which they can truly identify, the Palestinian
claim is undeniable."
The secretary said there is "no contradiction between
permanent peace for Israel and the legitimate rights of the
Palestinian people. Neither can be achieved without the
other."
Shultz devoted a major part of his first speech to the
General Assembly to the Mideast crisis. He spoke after
Israel's foreign minister, Yitzhak Shamir, voiced new
criticism of the Reagan plan.

But he said that if the compromise measure appears to
merit Reagan's approval, agencies will be told today to
continue business as usual. In any event, he said, all feder
al workers are expected to be on the job today.
This measure is needed because Reagan has not yet re
ceived any of the 13 regular money bills needed to finance
the government's operations for the new fiscal year,
which begins today.
Shultz calls for action in Lebanon
United Nations — Secretary of State George Shultz
called on Israel and Arab nations yesterday to accept
President Reagan's proposal to join in peace negotiations
and end the Middle East conflict that is "a searing wound
on our consciousness."
He also told the General Assembly the Palestinian peo
ple have an "undeniable" claim to a homeland, "a place
with which they can truly identify."
Shultz did not directly criticize Israel, which rejected
the Reagan initiative. But he said there can be no peace
for Israel until the "legitimate rights" of the Palestinians
are met.
"Of the nations in the world which need and deserve
peace, Israel surely holds a pre-eminent place," Shultz
said. "Of the peoples of the world who need and deserve a
place with which they can truly identify, the Palestinian
claim is undeniable."
The secretary said there is "no contradiction between
permanent peace for Israel and the legitimate rights of the
Palestinian people. Neither can be achieved without the
other."
Shultz devoted a major part of his first speech to the
General Assembly to the Mideast crisis. He spoke after
Israel's foreign minister, Yitzhak Shamir, voiced new
criticism of the Reagan plan.
Five die of cyanide poisoning
Arlington Heights, 111. — Five people in suburban Chi
cago died after swallowing capsules of Extra-Strength
Tylenol, and cyanide poisoning was known or strongly
suspected as the cause, authorities said yesterday.
The manufacturer recalled nearly 4.7 million of the
capsules and authorities said the case was being in
vestigated as "possible homicide."
A sixth person was near death from cyanide poisoning.
The series began with the deaths Wednesday of two

brothers in the western suburb of Arlington Heights and
a 12-vear-old girl in the neighboring community of Elk
Grove Village.
The wife of one of the brothers was hospitalized in ex
tremely critical condition after taking a capsule of the
medication, which is the nation's best-selling over-the
counter pain reliever. Doctors said her brain had suffered
"a great deal of damage" and she was not expected to I
live. 2;
In nearby Downers Grove, Mary McFarland, 31, of
Elmhurst, was dead on arrival last afternoon at Good
Samaritan Hospital, where she was rushed after taking •»'
Extra-Strength Tvlenol. Hospital spokeswoman Donna
Hartigan said the symptoms resembled cyanide poison
ing but coroner's tests were under way.
To the southwest in the suburb of Winfield, Mimi
Stewart, a spokeswoman at Central DuPage Hospital,
said Mary Reiner, 27, who had taken Extra-Strength 2;
Tylenol, died last morning of symptoms resembling
cyanide poisoning. She said a definite cause would have
to await the coroner's report.
Authorities said the cyanide was probably introduced
sometime after the capsules left the plant in Fort Wash- >
ington, Pa., where they are manufactured by McNeil
Consumer Products Co. The poison is not used in pro- *
duction of the medicine.
