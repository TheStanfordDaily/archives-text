# Stanford grad sentenced to 1 year
## Prison for Simon provokes strong reactions 
### MIKE HALE Senior staff writer 
Last Friday's sentencing of University graduate
Robert Simon to a year in jail was a victory, of sorts,
for those who demand the incarceration of drunk
drivers, but no one is celebrating it.
Simon, who was also sentenced to three years'
probation and fined $10,000, was the driver in a
campus auto accident last October in which two oth
er students were killed. Following a nine-day trial in
Santa Clara, Simon was convicted Aug. 4 on two
counts of misdemeanor vehicular manslaughter and
one count of felony drunk driving.
Prosecutor Lane Liroff said after the conviction,
"I think the jurv was quite satisfied that when you
drink excessive amounts of alcohol and strike your
car into a tree, that's not the type of activity that will
be tolerated." Liroff argued for a jail sentence at last
Fridav's hearing, citing the statistic that 26,000 peo
ple are killed bv drunken drivers each year and
saying, "We've developed a socially acceptable form
of murder."
But there was also strong feeling against in
carceration. In the time between the Aug. 4 convic
tion and the Sept. 24 sentencing, nine of the jurors in
the case wrote letters to Superior Court Judge Wil
liam Harris requesting leniency for Simon. In his
closing statement Harris referred to the "extremely
unusual situation" and said that in 20 years on the
bench he had never seen its like.
Peter Bernstein of Sunnyvale, one of the jurors
who wrote to Harris, said he was moved to write be
cause he felt Simon had already been punished
enough. He said the "daily reminder he (Simon) had
been instrumental in the deaths of his two best

friends" was "sufficient, even gruesome pun
ishment." He also feels Simon should be spared the
damage a jail sentence would do to his reputation
and future options, saving, "He is now regarded a
felon; I can't consider him as that."
At the hearing Harris said he was "mindful" of
the jurors' letters, calling the jury "in one sense of
the word, the ultimate conscience of the communi
ty." But he went on to say that while a jail sentence
would "dislocate" Simon's life, Simon "is, in fact,
alive. His friends are dead."
Simon's attorney, William Keogh, when asked
whether he had expected a suspended sentence, said
"I expected the judge to recognize the extenuating
circumstances," but that what shape that takes he
couldn't have predicted. "One can only hope."

News analysis

One point that came out during the trial and again
in Harris's closing statement was that Simon was
not wholly responsible for the tragedy. Harris dist
inguished between the person who "wantonly and
recklessly drives while drunk" and "runs down a
child in a crosswalk" and Simon's case, in which
"youthful exuberance resulted in a tragedy" where
the victims were "co-participants" and to some
degree responsible.
Jurv member Bernstein said, "I think the three
young people were equally guilty, they were all
doing something they shouldn't have done ... he
was just the survivor."
Liroff allowed that Simon "was not a murderer,"
hut said, "saving he shouldn't go to jail because he
didn't intend to kill anyone stretches the law to a

large degree." Calling the act of driving while drunk
"entirely criminal," Liroff said "he is a criminal and
that's certainly reflected in the jury's verdict."
From the start, the Simon case attracted much
more media attention than the charges involved
would normaliv warrant. Simon's status as a Stan
ford student and a fraternity member, and the
specter of the student drinking issue, led to coverage
of the accident, trial and sentencing by most of the
major Bay Area media.
According to Keogh, while the case "intrigued the
media," their attention was "wholly irrelevant" to
the trial's outcome and the sentencing. "Robert
came through (in the trial) as a fine young man,"
Keogh said.
But the Simon case was different. Liroff admitted,
"I went through a lot of turmoil because I had never
met anyone like Robert Simon in criminal court
before." But he remained firm in his belief that there
should be incarceration for every drunken driving
conviction and said at the hearing, "If we can even
save one life through this, then we've done some
thing noble." Speaking to the Daily earlier this
week, Liroff said he was about to prosecute another
drunken driving case and would say the same thing.
Simon was given 60 days from the date of the sen
tencing to appeal the sentence. Contacted Wednes
day, Keogh said no decision had yet been made re
garding whether or not to appeal.
At the hearing, Harris granted Keogh's request
for a stay of the jail sentence until Nov. 2, giving Si
mon time to arrange to be placed in a work furlough
program. According to Liroff, Simon will be placed
in the program automatically if he secures a job he
can perform while returning to the jail
at night and on weekends. Simon had
been offered a $2041-a-month research
associate position with the San Francis
co consulting firm Booz, Allen & Ham
ilton, but said before the sentencing in
a letter to Harris "1 have been told that
I will not be employed if I am jailed or
even put on work furlough, because
either would prevent my traveling."
Liroff also said that Simon's one year
jail sentence will probably be completed
in eight months, one-third of the sen
tence being removed for "good time"
credits.

Before granting the stay of sentence,
Harris denied a petition to have the fel
ony drunken driving conviction re
duced to a misdemeanor, but said the
motion could be re-entered after the
sentence and probation have been
served.
Peter Bernstein, for one, hopes the
petition will be re-entered. He said that
removing the felony conviction "would
be an extremely good act." For the time
being, though, Bernstein feels the less
that is said about the matter, the better.
After 11 months of a case that Keogh
said "raised an enormous cross-current
of emotions," Bernstein thinks "it's
time to bury this and try to give Robert
a chance to forget it."

closing statement Harris referred to the "extremely
unusual situation" and said that in 20 years on the
bench he had never seen its like.
Peter Bernstein of Sunnyvale, one of the jurors
who wrote to Harris, said he was moved to write be
cause he felt Simon had already been punished
enough. He said the "daily reminder he (Simon) had
been instrumental in the deaths of his two best

friends" was "sufficient, even gruesome pun
ishment." He also feels Simon should be spared the
damage a jail sentence would do to his reputation
and future options, saving, "He is now regarded a
felon; I can't consider him as that."
At the hearing Harris said he was "mindful" of
the jurors' letters, calling the jury "in one sense of
the word, the ultimate conscience of the communi
ty." But he went on to say that while a jail sentence
would "dislocate" Simon's life, Simon "is, in fact,
alive. His friends are dead."
Simon's attorney, William Keogh, when asked
whether he had expected a suspended sentence, said
"I expected the judge to recognize the extenuating
circumstances," but that what shape that takes he
couldn't have predicted. "One can only hope."

News analysis

One point that came out during the trial and again
in Harris's closing statement was that Simon was
not wholly responsible for the tragedy. Harris dist
inguished between the person who "wantonly and
recklessly drives while drunk" and "runs down a
child in a crosswalk" and Simon's case, in which
"youthful exuberance resulted in a tragedy" where
the victims were "co-participants" and to some
degree responsible.
Jurv member Bernstein said, "I think the three
young people were equally guilty, they were all
doing something they shouldn't have done ... he
was just the survivor."
Liroff allowed that Simon "was not a murderer,"
hut said, "saving he shouldn't go to jail because he
didn't intend to kill anyone stretches the law to a

large degree." Calling the act of driving while drunk
"entirely criminal," Liroff said "he is a criminal and
that's certainly reflected in the jury's verdict."
From the start, the Simon case attracted much
more media attention than the charges involved
would normaliv warrant. Simon's status as a Stan
ford student and a fraternity member, and the
specter of the student drinking issue, led to coverage
of the accident, trial and sentencing by most of the
major Bay Area media.
According to Keogh, while the case "intrigued the
media," their attention was "wholly irrelevant" to
the trial's outcome and the sentencing. "Robert
came through (in the trial) as a fine young man,"
Keogh said.
But the Simon case was different. Liroff admitted,
"I went through a lot of turmoil because I had never
met anyone like Robert Simon in criminal court
before." But he remained firm in his belief that there
should be incarceration for every drunken driving
conviction and said at the hearing, "If we can even
save one life through this, then we've done some
thing noble." Speaking to the Daily earlier this
week, Liroff said he was about to prosecute another
drunken driving case and would say the same thing.
Simon was given 60 days from the date of the sen
tencing to appeal the sentence. Contacted Wednes
day, Keogh said no decision had yet been made re
garding whether or not to appeal.
At the hearing, Harris granted Keogh's request
for a stay of the jail sentence until Nov. 2, giving Si
mon time to arrange to be placed in a work furlough
program. According to Liroff, Simon will be placed
in the program automatically if he secures a job he
can perform while returning to the jail
at night and on weekends. Simon had
been offered a $2041-a-month research
associate position with the San Francis
co consulting firm Booz, Allen & Ham
ilton, but said before the sentencing in
a letter to Harris "1 have been told that
I will not be employed if I am jailed or
even put on work furlough, because
either would prevent my traveling."
Liroff also said that Simon's one year
jail sentence will probably be completed
in eight months, one-third of the sen
tence being removed for "good time"
credits.

Before granting the stay of sentence,
Harris denied a petition to have the fel
ony drunken driving conviction re
duced to a misdemeanor, but said the
motion could be re-entered after the
sentence and probation have been
served.
Peter Bernstein, for one, hopes the
petition will be re-entered. He said that
removing the felony conviction "would
be an extremely good act." For the time
being, though, Bernstein feels the less
that is said about the matter, the better.
After 11 months of a case that Keogh
said "raised an enormous cross-current
of emotions," Bernstein thinks "it's
time to bury this and try to give Robert
a chance to forget it."
Last Friday's sentencing of University graduate
Robert Simon to a year in jail was a victory, of sorts,
for those who demand the incarceration of drunk
drivers, but no one is celebrating it.
Simon, who was also sentenced to three years'
probation and fined $10,000, was the driver in a
campus auto accident last October in which two oth
er students were killed. Following a nine-day trial in
Santa Clara, Simon was convicted Aug. 4 on two
counts of misdemeanor vehicular manslaughter and
one count of felony drunk driving.
Prosecutor Lane Liroff said after the conviction,
"I think the jurv was quite satisfied that when you
drink excessive amounts of alcohol and strike your
car into a tree, that's not the type of activity that will
be tolerated." Liroff argued for a jail sentence at last
Fridav's hearing, citing the statistic that 26,000 peo
ple are killed bv drunken drivers each year and
saying, "We've developed a socially acceptable form
of murder."
But there was also strong feeling against in
carceration. In the time between the Aug. 4 convic
tion and the Sept. 24 sentencing, nine of the jurors in
the case wrote letters to Superior Court Judge Wil
liam Harris requesting leniency for Simon. In his
closing statement Harris referred to the "extremely
unusual situation" and said that in 20 years on the
bench he had never seen its like.
Peter Bernstein of Sunnyvale, one of the jurors
who wrote to Harris, said he was moved to write be
