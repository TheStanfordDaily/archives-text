## Art Museum offers students taste of culture 
### KEILA DIEHL 
Each year, Stanford stu
dents voyage to the far cor
ners of the world to visit art
collections in such reknowned
institutions as the Louvre, the
Vatican and the Tate. Iron
ically, and regrettably, rela
tively few students here ever
take the time to venture past
the Oval to their own Stan
ford University Museum of
Art, where a prestigious and
diverse collection of works of
art is housed.
More than ISO Rodin
sculptures — one of the larg
est Rodin collections in the
country — are located in the
museum. Works by masters
such as Joshua Reynolds and
Thomas Gainsborough also
decorate the walls of the
building located on Lomita
Drive at Museum Way.
But few students who are
not directly involved in the art
department take advantage of
all the museum has to offer.
Carol Osborne, assistant di
rector of the museum, said
that although approximately
75,000 people visit the
museum each year, too few
students seem to realize the
benefits the museum can of
fer.
"I don't think they visit it
enough by any means," she
said.
The art department is the
primary link between the
museum and the rest of the
University. Several art pro
fessors take their students to
the museum to sketch, carry
out research or simply
browse.
The museum was founded
in 1891 as part of the original
Stanford campus. The im
pressive building houses an
extensive permanent collec
tion comprised largely of
donations from the Stanford

family. The permanent collec
tion includes Egyptian,
Greek, Roman, Oriental,
African, Oceanic, pre-Colum
bian, Native American, Eu
ropean and American art.
Of significant interest are
the large collections of Rodin
sculpture and Stanford family
memorabilia. The latter in
cludes such item as little
Leland's own woodcarvings
and sketches, his belongings
and a lifesize painting of Jane
Stanford's entire jewelry col
lection.
Since the '60s the museum
has concentrated on collect
ing works of art from the 18th
and 19th centuries. Bequests
are constantly being added to
the collection. Certain ac
quisitions are purchased with
funds raised by the Commit
tee for Art at Stanford.
This committee is an im
portant link beween the Uni
versity and the immediate
community. Its primary func
tion is to raise money for the
museum and the art depart
ment. Volunteers for the
Committee for Art are in
charge of the Treasure Mar
ket — a biennial sale of art,
antiques, silver and unusual
objects. Last year, this high
class antiques sale brought in
$250,000 for the museum.
Revenue for the museum is
also provided by membership
dues. Full-time student mem
berships is 10 dollars per
year. This fee entitles one to
attend previews, receptions,
the annual Christmas party,
tours and lectures. Members
also receive a monthly calen
dar covering activities in the
arts at Stanford and are al
lowed a 10 percent discount at
the Gallery Bookshop.
Besides the large per
manent collection, which
takes up most the museum,

there is a small gallery in f he
museum for rotating exnibi
tions. The museum is current
ly closed because of the strike,
but when it resumes its usual
hours the gallery will feature
the works of contemporary
sculptor Paul Harris. Twenty
three bronze and twenty
pastel still-lifes are included in
the show. These pieces take
their departure from simple
everyday objects such as cups
and saucers, or knives and
forks. However, as Phyllis
Diebenkorn put it in her 1981
essay on Harris' work, "the
objects seem to have an
almost human relationship to

one another."
Future exhibits in this gal
lery will include Printmaking
Techniques and the History of
Photography.
Perhaps more familiar to
Stanford students than the
museum is the Art Gallery lo
cated adjacent ot the Cum
mings Art Building, across
from the History Corner. On
October 5, an exhibit titled
"Venice in the 18th century"
will be opening in the gallery.
It will be a diverse exhibition,
featuring painting and draw
ings, painted furnititure, veni
tian mirrors, lace and glass.

Future exhibits in this gal
lery will include Printmaking
Techniques and the History of
Photography.
Perhaps more familiar to
Stanford students than the
museum is the Art Gallery lo
cated adjacent ot the Cum
mings Art Building, across
from the History Corner. On
October 5, an exhibit titled
"Venice in the 18th century"
will be opening in the gallery.
It will be a diverse exhibition,
featuring painting and draw
ings, painted furnititure, veni
tian mirrors, lace and glass.

MUSEUM EXHIBIT: Window, by Richard Diebenkorn,
is one of the many notable paintings located in the Stanford
University Museum of Art. The museum's collection also in
cludes paintings by Reynolds and Gainsborough and more
than 150 sculptures by Rodin.
Each year, Stanford stu
dents voyage to the far cor
ners of the world to visit art
collections in such reknowned
institutions as the Louvre, the
Vatican and the Tate. Iron
ically, and regrettably, rela
tively few students here ever
take the time to venture past
the Oval to their own Stan
ford University Museum of
Art, where a prestigious and
diverse collection of works of
art is housed.
More than ISO Rodin
sculptures — one of the larg
est Rodin collections in the
country — are located in the
museum. Works by masters
such as Joshua Reynolds and
Thomas Gainsborough also
decorate the walls of the
building located on Lomita
Drive at Museum Way.
But few students who are
not directly involved in the art
department take advantage of
all the museum has to offer.
Carol Osborne, assistant di
rector of the museum, said
that although approximately
75,000 people visit the
museum each year, too few
students seem to realize the
benefits the museum can of
fer.
"I don't think they visit it
enough by any means," she
said.
The art department is the
primary link between the
museum and the rest of the
University. Several art pro
fessors take their students to
the museum to sketch, carry
out research or simply
browse.
The museum was founded
in 1891 as part of the original
Stanford campus. The im
pressive building houses an
extensive permanent collec
tion comprised largely of
donations from the Stanford

family. The permanent collec
tion includes Egyptian,
Greek, Roman, Oriental,
African, Oceanic, pre-Colum
bian, Native American, Eu
ropean and American art.
Of significant interest are
the large collections of Rodin
sculpture and Stanford family
memorabilia. The latter in
cludes such item as little
Leland's own woodcarvings
and sketches, his belongings
and a lifesize painting of Jane
Stanford's entire jewelry col
lection.
Since the '60s the museum
has concentrated on collect
ing works of art from the 18th
and 19th centuries. Bequests
are constantly being added to
the collection. Certain ac
quisitions are purchased with
funds raised by the Commit
tee for Art at Stanford.
This committee is an im
portant link beween the Uni
versity and the immediate
community. Its primary func
tion is to raise money for the
museum and the art depart
ment. Volunteers for the
Committee for Art are in
charge of the Treasure Mar
ket — a biennial sale of art,
antiques, silver and unusual
objects. Last year, this high
class antiques sale brought in
$250,000 for the museum.
Revenue for the museum is
also provided by membership
dues. Full-time student mem
berships is 10 dollars per
year. This fee entitles one to
attend previews, receptions,
the annual Christmas party,
tours and lectures. Members
also receive a monthly calen
dar covering activities in the
arts at Stanford and are al
lowed a 10 percent discount at
the Gallery Bookshop.
Besides the large per
manent collection, which
takes up most the museum,

there is a small gallery in f he
museum for rotating exnibi
tions. The museum is current
ly closed because of the strike,
but when it resumes its usual
hours the gallery will feature
the works of contemporary
sculptor Paul Harris. Twenty
three bronze and twenty
pastel still-lifes are included in
the show. These pieces take
their departure from simple
everyday objects such as cups
and saucers, or knives and
forks. However, as Phyllis
Diebenkorn put it in her 1981
essay on Harris' work, "the
objects seem to have an
almost human relationship to

one another."
