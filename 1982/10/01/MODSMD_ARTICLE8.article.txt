1 • This is many people's favorite
western, and consequently it's sur
vived some pretty fearful interpreta
tions. Howard Hawks' best pictures
.have such enormous popular appeal
•that critics have often twisted them
selves into knots trying to find ex
cuses for loving them, as if entertain
ment value weren't sufficient. The
subject here is the transportation of
cattle, which allows Hawks the op
portunity to shoot a fantastic cattle
stampede; the other subject is the re
lationship between a tough cattleman
(John Wayne) and his son (Mont
gomery Clift, in an early, sensuous
performance). With Joanne Dru as
the love interest. (1948)
r Plavs through Wednesday with

Three Brothers ★★★★
Fox, Redwood City
• Francesco Rosi's warm, poetic
film is mostly about connection: in-
Hfrgenerational, marital, fraternal,
severed, rejoined. In rural southern
Italy, Donato (Charles Vanel), hav
ing lost his wife, telegraphs his three
grown-up sons to return to mourn
ijvith him. In leaving the place of their
birth, the sons have sacrificed their
connection to their roots and there
_fore to each other; in the grand tradi
tion of Italian agrarian movies, this
movie tells us that the farther one
-travels from the earth, the more pre
■ various the balance of one's existence
■ in the world. The life experiences of
the brothers are perhaps too cons
cientiously fitted together, and the
,agting (except for Vanel and Marta
Zoffoli as his granddaughter) is just
' adequate, but it's an astonishing film
"nonetheless.

Steven Spielberg's film begins
Where Close Encounters of the Third
Kind peaked — with the descent of an
.Tliien craft — and gets better and bet
.ter from there. Like The Black
Stallion, to which screenwriter

Melissa Mathison also contributed,
E.T. offers emotional compensation
in the form of a special, blessed
friendship to a young protagonist
who has lost a father. Elliott (Henry
Thomas), whose father has run off
with his mistress, establishes a bond
with a sweetly benevolent extrater
restrial. The domestic scenes are ex
traordinary, and flawlessly acted by
Thomas, Robert MacNaughton as
his brother, Drew Barrymore as his
kid sister and Dee Wallace as his
childish-spacev mother. It's an
absolutely entrancing movie, per
fectly expressing Spielberg's unique
brand of romanticism and cul
minating in one of the most strangely
moving denouements a director has
ever brought off.
Forbidden Planet ★★★'A
New Varsity, Palo Alto
One of the cleverest sci-fi films of
the '50s. It's Shakespeare's The Tem
pest transposed to a futuristic setting,
with Walter Pidgeon as the Prospero
figure, the lone male survivor of a
pioneer community on a distant
planet, Anne Francis as his daughter,
and a witty, efficient robot named
Robbv in lieu of Ariel. Leslie Nielsen
is the Ferdinand, a spaceship com
mander on an exploratory journey,
and Caliban finds his equivalent in
the "monsters from the id" that
plague the planet. (They are also a
clever reversal on the line, "We are
such stuff as dreams are made on . .
.") The dialogue and acting are un
fortunately banal, as in most films in
this genre and of this period, but the
idea redeems almost everything, and
so do the niftv special effects.
Plavs through Sunday, with Star
Wars.
The Long Good Friday
New Varsity, Palo Alto
It's The Godfather in reverse:
Harold Shand (Bob Hoskins) has
thrust himself up from his slum roots
to captain the biggest gangster-run
network in London. As he is about to
clinch the most ambitious deal of his
career — a translatlantic corporation

that allies him with the American
Mafia — his associates begin to be
killed off and his property destroyed
by an unknown enemy. Not all of the
acting is as good as Hoskins' and
Helen Mirren'sand Dave King's, and
one or two of the violent sequences
are excessivelv gaudv, but this offbeat
gangster picture with political over
tones is consistentlv intelligent. Bar
rie Keeffe, who wrote the screenplay,
and John Mackenzie, who directed,
have provided a portrait of England
on the wane.
Plays Tuesday and Wednesday
with Body Heat.
The World According to Garp
Palo Alto Square, Palo Alto
Inevitably any film of John Irv
ing's dense, fulfilling novel would
seem thin, and so despite the clear
headedness of Steve Tesich's script
and the seamless manner in which
George Roy Hill has assembled it,
this movie doesn't fill you up. But it is
admirably intelligent, and a lot of se
quences stick with vou. Unfortunate
ly, Robin Williams doesn't offer us a
Garp with much depth; with his
marvellous baby face and endearing
apple-cheeked grin, he's often very
funny, and he's terribly good at con
veying childlike hurt, but he can't
convince us that he's really a writer.
However, the supporting cast is im
pressive: John Lithgow, Glenn Close,
Marv Beth Hurt, Swoosie Kurtz, and
in cameos, Amanda Plummer,
Jessica Tandy and Hume Cronyn.
Pink Floyd: The Wall
Palo Alto Square, Palo Alto
The subjects are education, war,
loveless sex, anomie and mob psy
chology, but this film — a sight and
sound orgv for junior high school
mushroom heads — contains not a
single original thought on any of
them. Alan Parker, who directed,
presents an endless parade of re
hashed fifth-rate '60s imagery while
that thick, derivative music screams
at us in Dolbv Stereo.

Tempest
Old Mill, Mountain View
A Big Personal Film from Paul
Mazurskv with nothing really per
sonal about it; perhaps because of the
presence of John Cassavetes and
Ciena Rowlands in the cast, much of
it seems to have been forged in the
lumpy improvisational style of
Cassavetes' own psvehodramas.
Mazurskv has converted
Shakespeare's last plav into a tale of a
New York architect (Cassavetes) in
the throes of a midlife crisis and em
ployed a scrambled flashback struc
ture and four or five styles in the
process. It's an improv slapstick
quest parodv with soliloquies and
spontaneous songs and dances, and
with a large cast but only two appeal
ing performances; Susan Sarandon's
and 14-vear-old Molly Ringwald's
(as, respectively, ArethaAriel and
Miranda).

Fox, Redwood City
The writer-director, Blake Ed
wards, attempts both a satire on the
erotic fantasies of a post-40-year-old
male and a serious examination of
male menopause — with mixed re
sults. Dudley Moore, the pixieish
British comic, is practically a genius
at extremely complicated physical
comedy, and the monomania of his
charcter's search for his sexual dream
(Bo Derek, perfect as hilariously,
blissfully vacuous Jennifer) provides
Edwards with all the excuse he needs
to spin out a wonderful string of
slapstick routines. However, the
movie sermonizes interminably and
inexplicably about how misguided
Moore is because he prefers Derek to
Julie Andrews (acting in her crisp
WAC style). (1979)
Plavs tonight and Monday with
A rthur.
Blade Runner ★★
Park, Menlo Park
The Los Angeles of this film — set
in 2019 — is a neon-dotted landscape
with electric fires flashing out of
chimneys and aircraft soaring over-

head like hallucinatory bubbles; from
below, you see enormous advertising
images projected on floating screens
and unceasing rain. Some of the ex
teriors evoke memories of the burnt
out Vienna of The Third Man. while
the interiors are baroque, cavernous
and mustv, as in the Xanadu scenes of
Citizen Kane But it's a cold, repellent
movie. Ridlev Scott, whose last film
was Alien, seems chiefly concerned
with staging violence in freshly
shocking, abstractly beautiful ways;
he lets the narrative become muddy,
and he doesn't know what to do with
the actors. Harrison Ford stars.

Fox, Redwood City
Steve Gordon's uneven comedy,
cast in the mold of the long-extinct
Depression comedy with the im
probably rich hero who falls in love
with a plebe. One may be puzzled by
(iordon's time-warp sensibility, and
as the poor girl, Liza Minnelli is an
anachronism within an anachronism;
she's also too emphatic for such a
small movie. But, as everyone has
said, the scenes between Dudley
Moore (in the title role) and John
Gielgud (as his valet) are worth the
price of admission.
Plays tonight and Monday, with
10.
On Golden Pond
Memorial Auditorium
The two central characters are a re
tired professor approaching his 80th
birthday (Henry Fonda, who man
ages to retain his dignity) and his wife
(Katharine Hepburn), who is 10
years his junior. He is ornery and
foxv; she is affectionate and sage.
This is the kind of movie in which
loons and sunsets and trout and Jane
Fonda's backflip are used as
emblems of survival and longevity
and marital bliss and familial recon
ciliation. To be avoided at all costs.
Plavs Sunday.

New Varsity, Palo Alto
One of the cleverest sci-fi films of
the '50s. It's Shakespeare's The Tem
pest transposed to a futuristic setting,
with Walter Pidgeon as the Prospero
figure, the lone male survivor of a
pioneer community on a distant
planet, Anne Francis as his daughter,
and a witty, efficient robot named
Robbv in lieu of Ariel. Leslie Nielsen
is the Ferdinand, a spaceship com
mander on an exploratory journey,
and Caliban finds his equivalent in
the "monsters from the id" that
plague the planet. (They are also a
clever reversal on the line, "We are
such stuff as dreams are made on . .
.") The dialogue and acting are un
fortunately banal, as in most films in
this genre and of this period, but the
idea redeems almost everything, and
so do the niftv special effects.

New Varsity, Palo Alto
It's The Godfather in reverse:
Harold Shand (Bob Hoskins) has
thrust himself up from his slum roots
to captain the biggest gangster-run
network in London. As he is about to
clinch the most ambitious deal of his
career — a translatlantic corporation

that allies him with the American
Mafia — his associates begin to be
killed off and his property destroyed
by an unknown enemy. Not all of the
acting is as good as Hoskins' and
Helen Mirren'sand Dave King's, and
one or two of the violent sequences
are excessivelv gaudv, but this offbeat
gangster picture with political over
tones is consistentlv intelligent. Bar
rie Keeffe, who wrote the screenplay,
and John Mackenzie, who directed,
have provided a portrait of England
on the wane.
Plays Tuesday and Wednesday
with Body Heat.
The World According to Garp
Palo Alto Square, Palo Alto
Inevitably any film of John Irv
ing's dense, fulfilling novel would
seem thin, and so despite the clear
headedness of Steve Tesich's script
and the seamless manner in which
George Roy Hill has assembled it,
this movie doesn't fill you up. But it is
admirably intelligent, and a lot of se
quences stick with vou. Unfortunate
ly, Robin Williams doesn't offer us a
Garp with much depth; with his
marvellous baby face and endearing
apple-cheeked grin, he's often very
funny, and he's terribly good at con
veying childlike hurt, but he can't
convince us that he's really a writer.
However, the supporting cast is im
pressive: John Lithgow, Glenn Close,
Marv Beth Hurt, Swoosie Kurtz, and
in cameos, Amanda Plummer,
Jessica Tandy and Hume Cronyn.

A Big Personal Film from Paul
Mazurskv with nothing really per
sonal about it; perhaps because of the
presence of John Cassavetes and
Ciena Rowlands in the cast, much of
it seems to have been forged in the
lumpy improvisational style of
Cassavetes' own psvehodramas.
Mazurskv has converted
Shakespeare's last plav into a tale of a
New York architect (Cassavetes) in
the throes of a midlife crisis and em
ployed a scrambled flashback struc
ture and four or five styles in the
process. It's an improv slapstick
quest parodv with soliloquies and
spontaneous songs and dances, and
with a large cast but only two appeal
ing performances; Susan Sarandon's
and 14-vear-old Molly Ringwald's
(as, respectively, ArethaAriel and
Miranda).

The writer-director, Blake Ed
wards, attempts both a satire on the
erotic fantasies of a post-40-year-old
male and a serious examination of
male menopause — with mixed re
sults. Dudley Moore, the pixieish
British comic, is practically a genius
at extremely complicated physical
comedy, and the monomania of his
charcter's search for his sexual dream
(Bo Derek, perfect as hilariously,
blissfully vacuous Jennifer) provides
Edwards with all the excuse he needs
to spin out a wonderful string of
slapstick routines. However, the
movie sermonizes interminably and
inexplicably about how misguided
Moore is because he prefers Derek to
Julie Andrews (acting in her crisp
WAC style). (1979)

The Long Good Friday
New Varsity, Palo Alto
It's The Godfather in reverse:
Harold Shand (Bob Hoskins) has
thrust himself up from his slum roots
to captain the biggest gangster-run
network in London. As he is about to
clinch the most ambitious deal of his
career — a translatlantic corporation

that allies him with the American
Mafia — his associates begin to be
killed off and his property destroyed
by an unknown enemy. Not all of the
acting is as good as Hoskins' and
Helen Mirren'sand Dave King's, and
one or two of the violent sequences
are excessivelv gaudv, but this offbeat
gangster picture with political over
tones is consistentlv intelligent. Bar
rie Keeffe, who wrote the screenplay,
and John Mackenzie, who directed,
have provided a portrait of England
on the wane.
Plays Tuesday and Wednesday
with Body Heat.
The World According to Garp
Palo Alto Square, Palo Alto
Inevitably any film of John Irv
ing's dense, fulfilling novel would
seem thin, and so despite the clear
headedness of Steve Tesich's script
and the seamless manner in which
George Roy Hill has assembled it,
this movie doesn't fill you up. But it is
admirably intelligent, and a lot of se
quences stick with vou. Unfortunate
ly, Robin Williams doesn't offer us a
Garp with much depth; with his
marvellous baby face and endearing
apple-cheeked grin, he's often very
funny, and he's terribly good at con
veying childlike hurt, but he can't
convince us that he's really a writer.
However, the supporting cast is im
pressive: John Lithgow, Glenn Close,
Marv Beth Hurt, Swoosie Kurtz, and
in cameos, Amanda Plummer,
Jessica Tandy and Hume Cronyn.

A Big Personal Film from Paul
Mazurskv with nothing really per
sonal about it; perhaps because of the
presence of John Cassavetes and
Ciena Rowlands in the cast, much of
it seems to have been forged in the
lumpy improvisational style of
Cassavetes' own psvehodramas.
Mazurskv has converted
Shakespeare's last plav into a tale of a
New York architect (Cassavetes) in
the throes of a midlife crisis and em
ployed a scrambled flashback struc
ture and four or five styles in the
process. It's an improv slapstick
quest parodv with soliloquies and
spontaneous songs and dances, and
with a large cast but only two appeal
ing performances; Susan Sarandon's
and 14-vear-old Molly Ringwald's
(as, respectively, ArethaAriel and
Miranda).

The writer-director, Blake Ed
wards, attempts both a satire on the
erotic fantasies of a post-40-year-old
male and a serious examination of
male menopause — with mixed re
sults. Dudley Moore, the pixieish
British comic, is practically a genius
at extremely complicated physical
comedy, and the monomania of his
charcter's search for his sexual dream
(Bo Derek, perfect as hilariously,
blissfully vacuous Jennifer) provides
Edwards with all the excuse he needs
to spin out a wonderful string of
slapstick routines. However, the
movie sermonizes interminably and
inexplicably about how misguided
Moore is because he prefers Derek to
Julie Andrews (acting in her crisp
WAC style). (1979)

The Los Angeles of this film — set
in 2019 — is a neon-dotted landscape
with electric fires flashing out of
chimneys and aircraft soaring over-

head like hallucinatory bubbles; from
below, you see enormous advertising
images projected on floating screens
and unceasing rain. Some of the ex
teriors evoke memories of the burnt
out Vienna of The Third Man. while
the interiors are baroque, cavernous
and mustv, as in the Xanadu scenes of
Citizen Kane But it's a cold, repellent
movie. Ridlev Scott, whose last film
was Alien, seems chiefly concerned
with staging violence in freshly
shocking, abstractly beautiful ways;
he lets the narrative become muddy,
and he doesn't know what to do with
the actors. Harrison Ford stars.

Steve Gordon's uneven comedy,
cast in the mold of the long-extinct
Depression comedy with the im
probably rich hero who falls in love
with a plebe. One may be puzzled by
(iordon's time-warp sensibility, and
as the poor girl, Liza Minnelli is an
anachronism within an anachronism;
she's also too emphatic for such a
small movie. But, as everyone has
said, the scenes between Dudley
Moore (in the title role) and John
Gielgud (as his valet) are worth the
price of admission.

This is the kind of movie in which

selves into knots trying to find ex

• Francesco Rosi's warm, poetic

Hfrgenerational, marital, fraternal,

grown-up sons to return to mourn
ijvith him. In leaving the place of their
birth, the sons have sacrificed their
connection to their roots and there
_fore to each other; in the grand tradi

movie tells us that the farther one

One of the cleverest sci-fi films of
the '50s. It's Shakespeare's The Tem
pest transposed to a futuristic setting,
with Walter Pidgeon as the Prospero
figure, the lone male survivor of a
pioneer community on a distant
planet, Anne Francis as his daughter,
and a witty, efficient robot named
Robbv in lieu of Ariel. Leslie Nielsen
is the Ferdinand, a spaceship com

and Caliban finds his equivalent in
the "monsters from the id" that
plague the planet. (They are also a
clever reversal on the line, "We are
