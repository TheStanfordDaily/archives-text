## Jim Tassopulos Courts must not be politicized 
### 
The most important decisions facing the voters of Califor
nia in next month's elections involve people and issues about
which most citizens, even most Stanford students, know very
little. The cynical will say with some truth that the political
choices do not make any difference — Senate candidates
Gov. Brown or Pete Wilson, gubernatorial candidates Tom
Bradley or George Deukmejian. Some individuals, especial
ly students at Stanford, may not bother to vote for this very
reason.
However, anyone who takes this course must also realize
that he may be allowing a most dangerous intrusion into our
civil liberties and a drastic change in the balance of power
among our branches of government. The names Rose Bird,
Cruz Reynoso, Otto Kaus and Alvin Broussard may not
evoke strong feelings in most people, but what some are at
tempting to do to them should be known and fought by all.
A number of conservative action groups are attempting to
oust the four Brown-appointed justices of the California Su
preme Court because of the court's so-called liberal rulings.
This attempt to politicize the court is a direct challenge to the
constitutional base of the United States.
The new justices must be approved by the populace be
cause this is the first state election since they were appointed
and approved by a three-man committee. In the case of Bird,
who was approved by the populace after her appointment
and who is not scheduled to come up for approval again for
another six years, a recall petition was necessary.

Recently, Wilson stated that he would
support the recall of Bird and voter
rejection of the other Brown
appointees if the California court
overturned the so-called Victims 9 Bill
of Rights.

The personalities of the justice are not the main issue in the
argument for or against removal; politicization is wrong in
any case. However, it is interesting to note that the justices
being attacked compromise the only woman, the only
Latino, the only black and the only foreign-born member of
the Court. The attempt to recall Bird is the most blatant ex
ample of the conservative attempt to remove a justice solely
because of specific decisions and general judicial philoso
phy. There is no question concerning judicial or adminis
trative competence.
The attacks on all four justices have centered on their in
terpretation of the law and the Constitution, especially in the
area of defendants' rights. It is true that Bird has been at the
forefront of the court's rulings protecting the individual
rights of the accused from illegal, unconstitutional law en
forcement practices.
The three new justices also possess some of the same per
spectives as Bird, although there are some differences. How
ever, none of these justices has strayed outside the parame
ters of case law and the Constitution, and their legal de
cisions should not be subject to immediate, direct popular
scrutiny. The people vote for the governor every four years;
they can make their wishes or opinions known at this time.
— "One role of the judiciary is and should be to remove the
protection of basic individual rights from the precarious,
emotional hands of the general populace. If a judge were
forced to consider popular opinion when faced with a crucial
decision, he would not decide the issues based on case law or
the Constitution, but out of fear of the next election and in
accordance with majority views. As Anthony Murray, Cali
fornia state bar president, stated, "We must make it clear
that judges cannot be removed because the politicians dis
agree with their judicial philosophies or with specific de
cisions. Any other rule would replace judges with pollsters."

The majority did not desire equal rights for blacks; the ma
jority in some states throughout history has shown in
tolerance for certain minority religious or political ideas, but
only the majority has power in the legislative and executive
branches of government. Religious or ideological minorities
can have no power in the political system, but they deserve
the same rights to develop their lives as they see fit.
The duty to protect these rights is inherent in the judiciary
because of its function as sole and final interpreter of the Bill
of Rights, and more generally of what the law is. As political
trends change and tolerance of those who are different
wavers, the courts must prevent the destruction of basic indi
vidual rights. Without an independent judiciary, this simply
cannot be done, and eventually the erosion of rights would
affect everyone.
In West Virginia Board of Education v. Barnette, a flag
salute case, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled that Jehovah's
Witnesses did not have to salute the flag even though a ma
jority of people thought they should be forced to do so. In his
opinion, Justice Robert Jackson stated, "The very purpose
of the Bill of Rights was to withdraw certain subjects from
the vicissitudes of political controversy, to place them
beyond the reach of majorities and to establish them as legal
principles to be applied by the courts."
In the area of criminal cases, where most of the present
popular complaints exist, the court must decide what is con
stitutional in the pursuit of bringing lawbreakers to justice.
Basic rights such as representation by a lawyer, the prohibi
tion of mandatory self-incrimination, and the protection of
privacy from unreasonable searches and seizures are rooted
in the Constitution, but have been won in the courts. Even
the most ardent of hardliners would not wish for a society
void of these protections.
In troubled times like the present, with rising crime rates
causing a climate of fear, the populace is very tempted to
solve the problem by eroding constitutional protections. In
the long run, however, this would be disastrous, leading on
the road to an Orwellian nightmare. Again, an independent
judiciary is necessary to preserve freedom.
In Olmstead, a wiretapping case of the 19205, justice Louis
Brandeis stated, "To declare that in the administration of
the criminal law, the end justifies the means — to declare
that government may commit crimes in order to secure the
conviction of a private criminal would bring terrible retribu
tion. Against that pernicious doctrine this court should reso
lutely set its face."
Recently, Wilson stated that he would support the recall
of Bird and voter rejection of the other Brown appointees if
the California Court overturned the so-called Victims' Bill
of Rights. With this statement, Wilson revealed the degree to
which the drive to oust the judges is based on political reac
tions to specific decisions.
Later, Wilson aggravated his own questionable view by
stating that all judges, federal as well as state, including the
U.S. Supreme Court justices, should be elected. This plan
would completely destroy the concept of separation of
powers and turn all decision-making, including legal in
terpretation of the Constitution over to the political, legisla
tive sphere of government.
As it turned out, the Court upheld Proposition 8, at
least for the present, with Bird, Broussard and Mosk in dis
sent, and the drive against the justices died down somewhat.
However, just recently Wilson said again he supported the
recall of Bird because of her dissent.
An uninformed populace and a low voter turnout could
still lead to victory for the conservative groups who are still
fighting hard to oust the justices. If this happens, freedom as
cherished by both conservatives and liberals, Democrats and
Republicans, will soon be lost. We must always remember
that the last time courts were stripped of their power in order
to create a tougher, more orderly society, the result was Nazi
Germany.

Witnesses did not have to salute the flag even though a ma
jority of people thought they should be forced to do so. In his
opinion, Justice Robert Jackson stated, "The very purpose
of the Bill of Rights was to withdraw certain subjects from
the vicissitudes of political controversy, to place them
beyond the reach of majorities and to establish them as legal
principles to be applied by the courts."
In the area of criminal cases, where most of the present
popular complaints exist, the court must decide what is con
stitutional in the pursuit of bringing lawbreakers to justice.
Basic rights such as representation by a lawyer, the prohibi
tion of mandatory self-incrimination, and the protection of
privacy from unreasonable searches and seizures are rooted
in the Constitution, but have been won in the courts. Even
the most ardent of hardliners would not wish for a society
void of these protections.
In troubled times like the present, with rising crime rates
causing a climate of fear, the populace is very tempted to
solve the problem by eroding constitutional protections. In
the long run, however, this would be disastrous, leading on
the road to an Orwellian nightmare. Again, an independent
judiciary is necessary to preserve freedom.
In Olmstead, a wiretapping case of the 19205, justice Louis
Brandeis stated, "To declare that in the administration of
the criminal law, the end justifies the means — to declare
that government may commit crimes in order to secure the
conviction of a private criminal would bring terrible retribu
tion. Against that pernicious doctrine this court should reso
lutely set its face."
Recently, Wilson stated that he would support the recall
of Bird and voter rejection of the other Brown appointees if
the California Court overturned the so-called Victims' Bill
of Rights. With this statement, Wilson revealed the degree to
which the drive to oust the judges is based on political reac
tions to specific decisions.
Later, Wilson aggravated his own questionable view by
stating that all judges, federal as well as state, including the
U.S. Supreme Court justices, should be elected. This plan
would completely destroy the concept of separation of
powers and turn all decision-making, including legal in
terpretation of the Constitution over to the political, legisla
tive sphere of government.
As it turned out, the Court upheld Proposition 8, at
least for the present, with Bird, Broussard and Mosk in dis
sent, and the drive against the justices died down somewhat.
However, just recently Wilson said again he supported the
recall of Bird because of her dissent.
An uninformed populace and a low voter turnout could
still lead to victory for the conservative groups who are still
fighting hard to oust the justices. If this happens, freedom as
cherished by both conservatives and liberals, Democrats and
Republicans, will soon be lost. We must always remember
that the last time courts were stripped of their power in order
to create a tougher, more orderly society, the result was Nazi
Germany.

The most important decisions facing the voters of Califor
nia in next month's elections involve people and issues about
which most citizens, even most Stanford students, know very
little. The cynical will say with some truth that the political
choices do not make any difference — Senate candidates
Gov. Brown or Pete Wilson, gubernatorial candidates Tom
Bradley or George Deukmejian. Some individuals, especial
ly students at Stanford, may not bother to vote for this very
reason.
However, anyone who takes this course must also realize
that he may be allowing a most dangerous intrusion into our
civil liberties and a drastic change in the balance of power
among our branches of government. The names Rose Bird,
Cruz Reynoso, Otto Kaus and Alvin Broussard may not
evoke strong feelings in most people, but what some are at
tempting to do to them should be known and fought by all.
A number of conservative action groups are attempting to
oust the four Brown-appointed justices of the California Su
preme Court because of the court's so-called liberal rulings.
This attempt to politicize the court is a direct challenge to the
constitutional base of the United States.
The new justices must be approved by the populace be
cause this is the first state election since they were appointed
and approved by a three-man committee. In the case of Bird,
who was approved by the populace after her appointment
and who is not scheduled to come up for approval again for
another six years, a recall petition was necessary.

Recently, Wilson stated that he would
support the recall of Bird and voter
rejection of the other Brown
appointees if the California court
overturned the so-called Victims 9 Bill
of Rights.

The personalities of the justice are not the main issue in the
argument for or against removal; politicization is wrong in
any case. However, it is interesting to note that the justices
being attacked compromise the only woman, the only
Latino, the only black and the only foreign-born member of
the Court. The attempt to recall Bird is the most blatant ex
ample of the conservative attempt to remove a justice solely
because of specific decisions and general judicial philoso
phy. There is no question concerning judicial or adminis
trative competence.
The attacks on all four justices have centered on their in
terpretation of the law and the Constitution, especially in the
area of defendants' rights. It is true that Bird has been at the
forefront of the court's rulings protecting the individual
rights of the accused from illegal, unconstitutional law en
forcement practices.
The three new justices also possess some of the same per
spectives as Bird, although there are some differences. How
ever, none of these justices has strayed outside the parame
ters of case law and the Constitution, and their legal de
cisions should not be subject to immediate, direct popular
scrutiny. The people vote for the governor every four years;
they can make their wishes or opinions known at this time.
— "One role of the judiciary is and should be to remove the
protection of basic individual rights from the precarious,
emotional hands of the general populace. If a judge were
forced to consider popular opinion when faced with a crucial
decision, he would not decide the issues based on case law or
the Constitution, but out of fear of the next election and in
accordance with majority views. As Anthony Murray, Cali
fornia state bar president, stated, "We must make it clear
that judges cannot be removed because the politicians dis
agree with their judicial philosophies or with specific de
cisions. Any other rule would replace judges with pollsters."

The majority did not desire equal rights for blacks; the ma
jority in some states throughout history has shown in
tolerance for certain minority religious or political ideas, but
only the majority has power in the legislative and executive
branches of government. Religious or ideological minorities
can have no power in the political system, but they deserve
the same rights to develop their lives as they see fit.
The duty to protect these rights is inherent in the judiciary
because of its function as sole and final interpreter of the Bill
of Rights, and more generally of what the law is. As political
trends change and tolerance of those who are different
wavers, the courts must prevent the destruction of basic indi
vidual rights. Without an independent judiciary, this simply
cannot be done, and eventually the erosion of rights would
affect everyone.
