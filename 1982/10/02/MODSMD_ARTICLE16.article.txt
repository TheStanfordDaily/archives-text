# Experience prompts defensive success

### LISA STERN 
It could be this season's best
selling instructional book:
"From Powder Puff to Power
Pack: The Stanford Defense
Comes to Life."

Well, defensive coordinator
Larrv Mac Duff isn't writing a
success story vet, but since taking
over the responsibility from Jack
Harbaugh last spring, Mac Duff
has made some changes which
have noticeably increased Stan
ford's effectiveness.
The area of most outstanding
improvement is in the passing de
fense. Last year the Card ranked
dead last in the Pac-10 giving up
an average of 219 aerial yards per
game while managing to nab only
eight interceptions all season. In
only three games this year, the
secondary has already picked off
ten passes two more than all
last year and has deflected a
total of 16 opponent tosses.
Although the Cardinal is still
giving up an average of 232 yards
per game in the air, Mac Duff said
that he is encouraged by last
week's performance against the
Buckeyes. Stanford held quarter
back Mike Tomczak to only 71
yards passing while forcing four
interceptions.
Mac Duff noted three factors
which he said he believes are re
sponsible for his squad's im
proved play in the secondary.
"The players are first and fore
most one year older," he ex
plained, "and that year of ex
perience is very important in the
secondary.
"But we also really em
phasized work on the pass de
fense during the spring drills.
Finally, we changed some
schematic things and some as
signments, which I've been very
happy with," Mac Duff noted.

One of Mac Duffs schematic
changes was to have the line
backers move further off the line
of scrimmage when they line up.
He insisted that the benefits
accrued from making this alter
ation are two-fold in nature.
"The linebackers really get a
better angle on the outside run
plays," he said, "and so they have
better flow angles to the football.
But, more than that, this change
has improved our passing de
fense because the linebackers are
able to clear out sooner and as
sume a better attack posture.

"We have also placed a great
deal of emphasis on getting
around the football, because
good things happen when you get
close initially and react to the
ball."
Mac Duff made a notable as
signment change in the Card sec
ondary when he moved junior
Vaughn Williams from strong to
free safety. The position move, he

said, was prompted by a closer
analysis of the defensive back's
skills.
"It is Vaughn's own skills
which are best related to the free
safety position," Mac Duff
stated. "He has great range and
can cover both sides of the field.
He is better able to do this at free
safety.

"But Vaughn is also a very in
stinctive player, and he has very
quick reactions. By placing him
in the middle of the field at free
safety, we are capitalizing on his
talent."

Mac Duff is satisfied with this
change, but he feels that his All-
America candidate is still im
proving at his new position.
"It, has been an effective
change for us, and Vaughn is very
active in run support. He is in
volved in a lot of plays, but he is
still learning about the position,"
Mac Duff explained.
The coach also said that he was

impressed with the Card de
fensive unit's play against the
very potent Ohio State rushing
offense. After the Buckeyes pene
trated deep into Stanford territo
ry in the first half, the Cardinal
held runningback Tim Spencer
and Co. to only 38 yards on the
ground in 17 carries in the third
and fourth quarters.
Mac Duff insisted that no dra
matic changes were made at half
time which enabled his squad to
virtually shut down the Buckeye
ground game. "The guys made
up their own minds," he em-

phasized, "and we stayed with
the things that we thought we
should use at the beginning of the
game.
"In the first half, we weren't
getting off our blocks fast
enough, but then we began to ex
ecute better. I was very pleased
with the second half effort."
The coordinator noted that he
was impressed with the physical

condition of his defensive unit.
This conditioning, he believes,
was another important factor
leading to Stanford's second half
containment of the Buckeyes.
"We always condition with a
purpose," he said, "and it really
paved off against Ohio State be
cause they are a very physical
team that usually blows out op
ponents in the fourth quarter.
But we continued to compete
throughout the entire game, even
when we could have quit or relax
ed.
"We responded well to the
pressure when we were behind
13-0, and that effort demon
strated a lot of courage."
Turning to the preparation for
today's Oregon State matchup,
Mac Duff said that he wants to
concentrate on taking away the
Beaver's most effective weapons:
the outside runs, the option and
the four-man drop back passing
patterns.
"I'm going to look for con
sistency," he explained, "because
we'll be using the same defenses
and the same players. I want to
improve on trick plays especial
ly."

Perhaps the biggest change in
the Card defense is one which
Mac Duff need not affect at all
the confidence which comes with
time and experience. "We are still
a young football team with a lot
of growth to go through. But we
are capable of an outstanding
year if we continue to improve.
"The responsibility actually
rests on the players themselves.
We can call the plays, but they
make things happen because they
keep believing."
And if they believe hard
enough, maybe Larry Mac Duff
will sit down and write that book
next January.
