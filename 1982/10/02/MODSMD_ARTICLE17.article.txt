# Cardinal Today talks candidly with John Elway
## 
### ADAM BERNS 
This week in an exclusive in
terview with Cardinal Today,
John Elway talks about Stanford
football, the NFL strike and the
Heisman Trophy. Thus far, Elway
has compiled some amazing
statistics. He is first in the nation
in total offense, averaging 377.7
yards a game 70 yards higher
than his nearest competitor and
has completed 88 of 135 passes for
1122 yards and eight touchdowns
in only three games.
CT: In the past three weeks
you have been getting a lot of at
tention from the media. Have
you found the attention to be any
problem?
Elway: This year its been a lot
less than it was last year so it's
been pretty easy for me to handle
because they haven't been
around, and we've really filtered
a lot of the interviews that we've
been keeping
CT: Earlier this season you
joked about passing the ball on
every down this year rather than
every other down. Last week you
came awful close to doing that,

putting the ball in the air 63
times. Is this something you are
planning on doing more of in the
future or did in happen more by
accident than design?
Elway: I think that our main
weapon is passing the football,
and that is how we are going to
score points and keep them
honest with the run. We can hurt
people if they're not concerned
with it and if they totally dis
regard the running game then
we'll run the ball, but our main
weapon is throwing the ball.
We've got Mike Tolliver, Emile
Harry, Chris Dressel, Greg
Hooper, Rob Moore and Vin
cent White all on our football
team, so it's really tough to stop
any one of those guys.
CT: At the moment you are
probably the leading candidate
for the Heisman Trophy. Do you
feel that this puts any added pres
sure on you?
Elway: I try not to let it, but it
could if I really thought about it.
I try to let that control itself be
cause you can't control it. You
just go ojat and do the best you
cam and try to win. %

CT: At this juncture in the sea
son what are the parts of your
game that you are most pleased
with and what do you feel needs
improvement?
Elway: Well, you always can
improve on everything, and I'm
always trying to improve all parts
of my game. Right now I'm hap
py with the way I've been moving
in the pocket. Our offensive line
is doing a great job, and I have
time to pass the ball without hav
ing to scramble as much.
CT: This year your receivers
seem to be adjusting their pat
terns more when your in trouble
and have to scramble like
Emile Harry did last week
against Ohio State. Is this some
thing you've been working on in
practice or has it kind of just
evolved while playing together
for so long?
Elway: I think that just comes
from experience because it's
tough to work on a situation like
that in practice. When you get ex
perience during a game you get
.better and better all the time, and
they have. They are doing a great
job finding the open areas just

like Emile did on that last play
against Ohio State. I think that it
is something which just comes
from experience.
CT: You have been asked
thousands of times whether you
are going to play in the NFL or
with the Yankees but there is now
a unique twist to the situation.
This year the NFL players in
their strike are demanding salary
scales which would be disadvan
tageous to a standout rookie
prospect like yourself. How will
the outcome of the stike affect
your decision one way or the oth
er?
Elway: I haven't really thought
about that. 1 really don't think
that it is going to happen with the
pro strike anyway. It't tough to
say what is going to happen with
that anyway. You ask me what is
going to weigh in my decision
right now, but 1 don't know what
is going to affect my decision be
cause I haven't been thinking
about that. Pro football is a year
off and pro baseball is a year off
even though 1 played this Surrim
mer. Right now I'm just thinking .
a&out college football and Stan-

ford football and doing what I
can to get us a win. I'm not wor
ried about the decision or the
strike altering my decision either,
but I'll have to deal with that
when the season's over and I
know a lot of the unknowns
about the decision.
CT: In the four seasons you've
played here you have not yet been
able to go to a bowl game. Has
that been a big disappointment
for you, and what do you feel are
your chances of going to a bowl
game this year?
Elway: Well, that's been my
biggest disappointment since I've
been here, that we haven't been
able to go to a bowl game with
the talent that we have had here.
All the years we've been disap
pointed because we've lost to
people that we should have beat,
and we just haven't been a real
consistent football team. This
year our chances are probably
the best that we've ever had, al
though my sophomore year we
started out 4-1 and ended up 6-5.
lf£ tough. We've got to take this
. year game bv game and make ev
ery game important.

prospect like yourself. How will
the outcome of the stike affect
your decision one way or the oth
er?
Elway: I haven't really thought
about that. 1 really don't think
that it is going to happen with the
pro strike anyway. It't tough to
say what is going to happen with
that anyway. You ask me what is
going to weigh in my decision
right now, but 1 don't know what
is going to affect my decision be
cause I haven't been thinking
about that. Pro football is a year
off and pro baseball is a year off
even though 1 played this Surrim
mer. Right now I'm just thinking .
a&out college football and Stan-

ford football and doing what I
can to get us a win. I'm not wor
ried about the decision or the
strike altering my decision either,
but I'll have to deal with that
when the season's over and I
know a lot of the unknowns
about the decision.
CT: In the four seasons you've
played here you have not yet been
able to go to a bowl game. Has
that been a big disappointment
for you, and what do you feel are
your chances of going to a bowl
game this year?
Elway: Well, that's been my
biggest disappointment since I've
been here, that we haven't been
able to go to a bowl game with
the talent that we have had here.
All the years we've been disap
pointed because we've lost to
people that we should have beat,
and we just haven't been a real
consistent football team. This
year our chances are probably
the best that we've ever had, al
though my sophomore year we
started out 4-1 and ended up 6-5.
lf£ tough. We've got to take this
. year game bv game and make ev
ery game important.
This week in an exclusive in
terview with Cardinal Today,
John Elway talks about Stanford
football, the NFL strike and the
Heisman Trophy. Thus far, Elway
has compiled some amazing
statistics. He is first in the nation
in total offense, averaging 377.7
yards a game 70 yards higher
than his nearest competitor and
has completed 88 of 135 passes for
1122 yards and eight touchdowns
in only three games.
CT: In the past three weeks
you have been getting a lot of at
tention from the media. Have
you found the attention to be any
problem?
Elway: This year its been a lot
less than it was last year so it's
been pretty easy for me to handle
because they haven't been
around, and we've really filtered
a lot of the interviews that we've
been keeping
CT: Earlier this season you
joked about passing the ball on
every down this year rather than
every other down. Last week you
came awful close to doing that,

putting the ball in the air 63
times. Is this something you are
planning on doing more of in the
future or did in happen more by
accident than design?
Elway: I think that our main
weapon is passing the football,
and that is how we are going to
score points and keep them
honest with the run. We can hurt
people if they're not concerned
with it and if they totally dis
regard the running game then
we'll run the ball, but our main
weapon is throwing the ball.
We've got Mike Tolliver, Emile
Harry, Chris Dressel, Greg
Hooper, Rob Moore and Vin
cent White all on our football
team, so it's really tough to stop
any one of those guys.
CT: At the moment you are
probably the leading candidate
for the Heisman Trophy. Do you
feel that this puts any added pres
sure on you?
Elway: I try not to let it, but it
could if I really thought about it.
I try to let that control itself be
cause you can't control it. You
just go ojat and do the best you
cam and try to win. %

CT: At this juncture in the sea
son what are the parts of your
game that you are most pleased
with and what do you feel needs
improvement?
Elway: Well, you always can
improve on everything, and I'm
always trying to improve all parts
of my game. Right now I'm hap
py with the way I've been moving
in the pocket. Our offensive line
is doing a great job, and I have
time to pass the ball without hav
ing to scramble as much.
CT: This year your receivers
seem to be adjusting their pat
terns more when your in trouble
and have to scramble like
Emile Harry did last week
against Ohio State. Is this some
thing you've been working on in
practice or has it kind of just
evolved while playing together
for so long?
Elway: I think that just comes
from experience because it's
tough to work on a situation like
that in practice. When you get ex
perience during a game you get
.better and better all the time, and
they have. They are doing a great
job finding the open areas just

like Emile did on that last play
against Ohio State. I think that it
is something which just comes
from experience.
CT: You have been asked
thousands of times whether you
are going to play in the NFL or
with the Yankees but there is now
a unique twist to the situation.
This year the NFL players in
their strike are demanding salary
scales which would be disadvan
tageous to a standout rookie
prospect like yourself. How will
the outcome of the stike affect
your decision one way or the oth
er?
Elway: I haven't really thought
