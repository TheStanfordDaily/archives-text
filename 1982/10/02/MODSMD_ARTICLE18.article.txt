# Crafty Harry seeks and finds the open spots
## 
### LISA STERN 
It was a classic scenario: The
good guys (read Stanford) are be
hind bv four points. They have
two minutes to drive 80 yards to
the opposite end of the field and
beat the bad guys (read Ohio
State). Of course the hero (read
quarterback John Elway) man
ages to lead his team down the
grid iron to (gasp) the Buckeye
17-vard line. With just 40 seconds
to go in the contest, Elway, look
ing left and then right, throws a
lofty pass into the endzone for
the winning touchdown.

Much has been written about
our hero, the quarterback. But
who was that other "masked
man" who, standing by himself
in the endzone, caught the float
ing ball?
The "lone receiver" was
sophomore Emile Harry. Harry,
a self-proclaimed shy person who
dislikes predictions, has been on
the receiving end of 16 Elway
passes this year. The split end,
who has amassed 273 yards in
pass receptions in only the first
three games of this season, is the
Card second leading receiver be
hind senior runningback Vincent
White.
Considered by many as one of
Stanford's top recruits in 1981,
Harry attended Fountain Valley
H.S., a school which may also
boast about alumnus Ken
Margerum, now a Chicago Bear.
Harrv, who has never attended
school with Margerum, is fre
quently compared to the former
Stanford All-America. In fact,
Fountain Valley Head coach
Mike Milner, who tutored both
receivers, has called Harry "a
better receiver than Margerum at
this stage in his career."
Harry is proud of such com
parisons, but he insists that he
holds the utmost respect for
Margerum. "I have a great deal

of admiration for him," Harry
explained, "because he is such a
fine receiver. I am always de
lighted when people compare
us."
Yet, Harry insists that
Margerum has not influenced his
style of receiving. "I've never had
any idols. Here at Stanford, all
the receivers are bent on helping
each other to improve. Just as
Andre (Tyler), Mike (Tolliver),
(Don) Lonzinger, and (Eric)
Mullins really went out of their
way to help me. We are all work
ing to help Kenny Williams.
"We all realize that we're all in
the same boat. It's almost an un
written law."
Harry, who started in two
games last season, flagged down
only 10 passes for 196 yards in his
freshman year. His top rookie ef
forts, however, came in the last
two games of the fall campaign,
when he caught three passes for
55 yards against Oregon St. and
nabbed a 37-yard Elway toss in
the Big Game against Cal.
"At the end of last year I got to
plav more," Harry recalled, "and
I really benefited from the game
experience."
In addition to this increase in
playing time, Harry attributes his
improvement this season to an
active summer conditioning pro
gram. "I really worked out on the
weights, but I also put myself
through some strenuous running
workouts. Usually I'd run five or
more miles everyday, and I did
sprint work, also."

Harry further noted some dif
ferences in the Stanford passing
game which have enabled him to
become more successful at what
he does best catching the ball.
"Usually there have been one or
two good receivers, and they've
come out of the backfield. This
year, though, everybody can
catch the ball. We are all very

capable, and we can usually get
open.
"Now, John knows he can go
to each of us, and our offense is
geared for many receivers,"
Harry continued. "When John
throws to me, 1 get more confi
dent, and 1 improve."
As a receiver, Harry said that
he could not be happier to be at
Stanford. "The program is well
suited to any receiver because-
Stanford will pass until the cows
come in. John throws both to
backs and wide outs, so you can't
go wrong as a receiver if you
come here to play. And 1 don't
know of any receiver who
wouldn't rather catch the foot
ball than throw stock blocks. 1
sure wouldn't."
Yet, like almost every receiver
before him, Harry had to adapt
to catching the John Elway pass,
which is traditionally thrown
hard and fast. "When I first got
here, I couldn't believe how hard
John threw the ball. 1 had a lot of
problems seeing it. Now that I've
adjusted, it's like catching a piece
of paper tossed from across the
room.
"The secret," he added, "is to
keep your eve on the ball, relax,
and just catch it."
As an athelete and a student,
Harrv believes that the key to
survival during the football sea
son is time managerrfent. He in
sists, however, that he finds time
at lunch to watch his favorite
soap opera, "All My Children."
"We are ordinary students, but
with the responsibility of playing
football. If you don't organize
your time, though, that's it."
Although Harry is a serious
student aiming for a law school
acceptance, he hinted that he also
would be interested in playing in
the NFL. "For me, it's a long
way off. I play football because
it's fun, and when it ceases to be

fun, I won't play.
"But if I continue to improve
and am chosen in the draft," he
added, "I'd probably jump at the
chance. I'll probably play foot
ball until I get too old and tired."
Harry, who bruised his right
foot in Stanford's 23-20 win last
weekend, expects to be ready for
today's contest against Oregon
St. He explained that the most
important factor in the game will
be concentration.

"We will beat them," he in
sisted, "but we can't take them
lightly. We must concentrate on
throwing and catching the foot
ball. This is a special game be
cause all games are special when
you have the opportunity to win.
"We have not reached our
potential," he concluded, "but
this team can be great and we will
be great."
But of course, the "lone re
ceiver" doesn't like to make pre
dictions.

ball than throw stock blocks. 1
sure wouldn't."
Yet, like almost every receiver
before him, Harry had to adapt
to catching the John Elway pass,
which is traditionally thrown
hard and fast. "When I first got
here, I couldn't believe how hard
John threw the ball. 1 had a lot of
problems seeing it. Now that I've
adjusted, it's like catching a piece
of paper tossed from across the
room.
"The secret," he added, "is to
keep your eve on the ball, relax,
and just catch it."
As an athelete and a student,
Harrv believes that the key to
survival during the football sea
son is time managerrfent. He in
sists, however, that he finds time
at lunch to watch his favorite
soap opera, "All My Children."
"We are ordinary students, but
with the responsibility of playing
football. If you don't organize
your time, though, that's it."
Although Harry is a serious
student aiming for a law school
acceptance, he hinted that he also
would be interested in playing in
the NFL. "For me, it's a long
way off. I play football because
it's fun, and when it ceases to be

fun, I won't play.
"But if I continue to improve
and am chosen in the draft," he
added, "I'd probably jump at the
chance. I'll probably play foot
ball until I get too old and tired."
Harry, who bruised his right
foot in Stanford's 23-20 win last
weekend, expects to be ready for
today's contest against Oregon
St. He explained that the most
important factor in the game will
be concentration.

"We will beat them," he in
sisted, "but we can't take them
lightly. We must concentrate on
throwing and catching the foot
ball. This is a special game be
cause all games are special when
you have the opportunity to win.
"We have not reached our
potential," he concluded, "but
this team can be great and we will
be great."
But of course, the "lone re
ceiver" doesn't like to make pre

HARRY THE HERO: Although Stanford receiver Emile
Harry is a quiet person, his heroics on the field have spoken loud
ly. He's already caught 16 passes for 273 yards this year and the
sophomore from Fountain Valley seems well on his way to great
ness.
It was a classic scenario: The
good guys (read Stanford) are be
hind bv four points. They have
two minutes to drive 80 yards to
the opposite end of the field and
beat the bad guys (read Ohio
State). Of course the hero (read
quarterback John Elway) man
ages to lead his team down the
grid iron to (gasp) the Buckeye
17-vard line. With just 40 seconds
to go in the contest, Elway, look
ing left and then right, throws a
lofty pass into the endzone for
the winning touchdown.

Much has been written about
our hero, the quarterback. But
who was that other "masked
man" who, standing by himself
in the endzone, caught the float
ing ball?
The "lone receiver" was
sophomore Emile Harry. Harry,
a self-proclaimed shy person who
dislikes predictions, has been on
the receiving end of 16 Elway
passes this year. The split end,
who has amassed 273 yards in
pass receptions in only the first
three games of this season, is the
Card second leading receiver be
hind senior runningback Vincent
White.
Considered by many as one of
Stanford's top recruits in 1981,
Harry attended Fountain Valley
H.S., a school which may also
boast about alumnus Ken
Margerum, now a Chicago Bear.
Harrv, who has never attended
school with Margerum, is fre
quently compared to the former
Stanford All-America. In fact,
Fountain Valley Head coach
Mike Milner, who tutored both
receivers, has called Harry "a
better receiver than Margerum at
this stage in his career."
Harry is proud of such com
parisons, but he insists that he
holds the utmost respect for
Margerum. "I have a great deal

of admiration for him," Harry
explained, "because he is such a
fine receiver. I am always de
lighted when people compare
us."
Yet, Harry insists that
Margerum has not influenced his
style of receiving. "I've never had
any idols. Here at Stanford, all
the receivers are bent on helping
each other to improve. Just as
Andre (Tyler), Mike (Tolliver),
(Don) Lonzinger, and (Eric)
Mullins really went out of their
way to help me. We are all work
ing to help Kenny Williams.
"We all realize that we're all in
the same boat. It's almost an un
written law."
Harry, who started in two
games last season, flagged down
only 10 passes for 196 yards in his
freshman year. His top rookie ef
forts, however, came in the last
two games of the fall campaign,
when he caught three passes for
55 yards against Oregon St. and
nabbed a 37-yard Elway toss in
the Big Game against Cal.
"At the end of last year I got to
plav more," Harry recalled, "and
I really benefited from the game
experience."
In addition to this increase in
playing time, Harry attributes his
improvement this season to an
active summer conditioning pro
gram. "I really worked out on the
weights, but I also put myself
through some strenuous running
workouts. Usually I'd run five or
more miles everyday, and I did
sprint work, also."

Harry further noted some dif
ferences in the Stanford passing
game which have enabled him to
become more successful at what
he does best catching the ball.
"Usually there have been one or
two good receivers, and they've
come out of the backfield. This
year, though, everybody can
catch the ball. We are all very

capable, and we can usually get
open.
"Now, John knows he can go
to each of us, and our offense is
geared for many receivers,"
Harry continued. "When John
throws to me, 1 get more confi
dent, and 1 improve."
As a receiver, Harry said that
he could not be happier to be at
Stanford. "The program is well
suited to any receiver because-
Stanford will pass until the cows
come in. John throws both to
backs and wide outs, so you can't
go wrong as a receiver if you
come here to play. And 1 don't
know of any receiver who
wouldn't rather catch the foot
ball than throw stock blocks. 1
sure wouldn't."
