# Hardin walks into starting role
## 
### MARK ZEIGLER 
You won't see his name in the
press guide or in the stadium pro
gram. You couldn't even locate
him on the Cardinal Today roster
two weeks ago. But you won't
find him on the bench either.
One place you'll find senior
Trip Hardin, No. 12, is on the
field dropped back in punt for
mation. The 6-foot-2, 195 pound
walk-on replaced sophomore
Greg Topp as the Cardinal's
starting punter last week against
Ohio State. It was the first time
Hardin had punted in a Stanford
uniform.
Actually, Hardin had punted
in a Card garb plenty of times
before last Saturday, but only on
the practice field. The Thursday
before the Ohio State game, the
St. Louis resident found out he'd
be kicking away for real, in an
honest-to-god game.
Hardin trotted out on the field
in the first quarter and stood
deep in Stanford territory. One
the other side of the Cardinal's
Blockers were ten Ohio State
Buckeyes, hungry for a blocked

punt. In the stands 89,436 fans
began to rise from their seats in
anticipation of an aborted effort.
Hut, hut,. . .
"I'd be lying if I told you I
wasn't nervous," Hardin said, re
calling the split second before the
snap. But once the ball was in his
hands, Hardin managed to get
the punt off, though admittedly 44
it wasn't really great."
All in all, he punted three times
and averaged 41.3 yards a kick,
an improvement over Topp's 34-
vard average. He seems destined
to finish out the season as a
starter if he keeps up a 40 yard av
erage per kick.
Hardin's football career, how
ever, hasn't always been so clear
cut. The industrial engineering
major has overcome a series of
athletic setbacks since his high
school days.
A highly recruited
punter/place kicker for most of
his senior year at Country Day
high school in St. Louis, he tore
cartilage in his right or kicking
knee in 1 the eighth game of tfr€ T ' ; '
season. End of recruiting.

After coming to Stanford for
"academic reasons," Hardin de
cided to try to make the team as a
walk-on. Although he indeed
landed a spot on the team, he
kicked behind Ken Naber, who
would eventually become the No.
1 punter and second most prolific
scorer in Cardinal history. End of
playing time.
Hardin made the team again
his sophomore year, but was
forced to have a second
operatation on his right knee and
consequently was sidelined for
the entire 1981 season as a result.
End of opportunity to start.
When the Card senior went to
1982 spring workouts, he did so
with a new frame of mind.
"There wasn't so much pressure.
Lots of my friends urged me to
come out and so I just wanted to
have fun and play football with
my friends." Beginning of a
"new" career.
Though Hardin punted well in
spring ball,Topp started the 1982
season. "What was in my mind
was to inherit the job," Hardin

said, "but it just didn't work out
that way. What it did was force
me to improve."
And improve he did. "I be
lieved in myself, I thought I was
the best punter," he explained. "I
started coming on in the last cou
ple weeks."
Hardin said Stanford practices
were helpful to his recent im
provement. Besides punting from
an automatic snapper (the
equivalent of a pitching ma
chine), Cardinal kickers also
have game-simulation practice
sessions.
Hardin, who has never had a
punt blocked in his life, thinks his
hang-time and accuracy have im
proved in the last year. "I feel re
ally confident in my coffin corner
ability, but I haven't had a
chance to use it yet.

"A lot of it (punting) is just
mental," he continued. "It's con
centrating and getting the proper
drop."
One interesting anecdote
about Hardin is his grandfather,
Hord Hardin. (Trip's official
name is actually Hord Hardin,
111, but has shortened Triple to
Trip.) Hord Hardin, Sr., used to
be the President of the United
States Golf Association (USGA)
and now presides as the chairman
of the Master's Golf Tour
nament.

"He's (Hord, Sr.) the guy that
presents the green jacket (to the
winner) at the end," grandson
Hardin said.

The best part about the new
Card punter is that, although a
senior academically, he still has a
season of athletic elgibility re
maining. "If all goes well, I antic
ipate coming back," he said.

unhappy with this Guest Greek

he complained. While CT

me to improve."
And improve he did. "I be
lieved in myself, I thought I was
the best punter," he explained. "I
started coming on in the last cou
ple weeks."
Hardin said Stanford practices
were helpful to his recent im
provement. Besides punting from
an automatic snapper (the
equivalent of a pitching ma
chine), Cardinal kickers also
have game-simulation practice
sessions.
Hardin, who has never had a
punt blocked in his life, thinks his
hang-time and accuracy have im
proved in the last year. "I feel re
ally confident in my coffin corner
ability, but I haven't had a
chance to use it yet.

"A lot of it (punting) is just
mental," he continued. "It's con
centrating and getting the proper
drop."
One interesting anecdote
about Hardin is his grandfather,
Hord Hardin. (Trip's official
name is actually Hord Hardin,
111, but has shortened Triple to
Trip.) Hord Hardin, Sr., used to
be the President of the United
States Golf Association (USGA)
and now presides as the chairman
of the Master's Golf Tour
nament.

"He's (Hord, Sr.) the guy that
presents the green jacket (to the
winner) at the end," grandson
Hardin said.

The best part about the new
Card punter is that, although a
senior academically, he still has a
season of athletic elgibility re
maining. "If all goes well, I antic
ipate coming back," he said.

JUMPING FOR JOY: Stanford receiver Mike Toilliver does
not have his head in the ground. He's just making a leaping catch
against Purdue. Tolliver has caught 19 passes this year for 138
yards and is averaging 19.7 yards a catch.
You won't see his name in the
press guide or in the stadium pro

him on the Cardinal Today roster

find him on the bench either.

Trip Hardin, No. 12, is on the
field dropped back in punt for
mation. The 6-foot-2, 195 pound
walk-on replaced sophomore
Greg Topp as the Cardinal's
starting punter last week against
Ohio State. It was the first time
Hardin had punted in a Stanford
uniform.
Actually, Hardin had punted
in a Card garb plenty of times
before last Saturday, but only on
the practice field. The Thursday
before the Ohio State game, the
St. Louis resident found out he'd
be kicking away for real, in an
honest-to-god game.
Hardin trotted out on the field
in the first quarter and stood
deep in Stanford territory. One
the other side of the Cardinal's
Blockers were ten Ohio State
Buckeyes, hungry for a blocked

punt. In the stands 89,436 fans
began to rise from their seats in
anticipation of an aborted effort.
Hut, hut,. . .
"I'd be lying if I told you I
wasn't nervous," Hardin said, re
calling the split second before the
snap. But once the ball was in his
hands, Hardin managed to get
the punt off, though admittedly 44
it wasn't really great."
All in all, he punted three times
and averaged 41.3 yards a kick,
an improvement over Topp's 34-
vard average. He seems destined
to finish out the season as a
starter if he keeps up a 40 yard av
erage per kick.
Hardin's football career, how
ever, hasn't always been so clear
cut. The industrial engineering
major has overcome a series of
athletic setbacks since his high
school days.
A highly recruited
punter/place kicker for most of
his senior year at Country Day
high school in St. Louis, he tore
cartilage in his right or kicking
knee in 1 the eighth game of tfr€ T ' ; '
season. End of recruiting.

After coming to Stanford for
"academic reasons," Hardin de
cided to try to make the team as a
walk-on. Although he indeed
landed a spot on the team, he
kicked behind Ken Naber, who
would eventually become the No.
1 punter and second most prolific
scorer in Cardinal history. End of
playing time.
Hardin made the team again
his sophomore year, but was
forced to have a second
operatation on his right knee and
consequently was sidelined for
the entire 1981 season as a result.
