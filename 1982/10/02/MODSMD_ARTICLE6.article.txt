# Wiggin afraid of letdown against OSU
## 
### ADAM BERNS 
Stanford head coach Paul
Wiggin is worried. Coming off an
emotional 23-20 upset of No. 11
ranked Ohio State, how does one
get a team psyched up for Oregon
State. To make matters worse,
the Beavers are coming off a nar
row 17-13 loss to San Jose State
a game they should have won
and seem to have gained con
fidence from the narrow loss.
"They are a dramatically im
proved team from the first game
of the season," Wiggin explained
at his weekly press conference.
"I'm a little concerned about it.
They really aren't that bad and
have some big strong players.
"They played San Jose State
real tough," Wiggin added. I
think they did a good job dealing
with San Jose State's multiple of
fense. They should should have
won the game."
Wiggin isn't the only one who
thinks Oregon State should not
have lost last week.
"We should have won the foot
ball game," Beaver coach Joe
Avezzano said about last week's
game with the Spartans. "It's the
most complete game that we've
played. I anticipate before the
season is out, and when our inex
perience catches up with our ex
perience, we'll have a real good
football team."

While Wiggin might think he
has problems, it's nothing com
pared to what Beaver coach
Avezzano is faced with in trying
to find away to stop John Elway.
"He's the finest quarterback in
college football," Avezzano said
of the Stanford quarterback. "I
don't think you can stop the
young man. Your offense has to
stop him by staying on the field. I
don't think anybody can shut
him down when he is healthy."
One thing which has bothered
Wiggin thus far are the slow
starts Stanford has been getting,
even in its victories.
"We need to come out and es
tablish on the first play of the
game who we are and what we
are," Wiggin said.
The Beavers air attack proba

blv won't be confused with Elway
and Company, but Oregon State
has the ability to hurt teams
which disregard its air threat.
Last week, senior quarterback
Ed Singler completed 11 of 23
passes for 183 yards against a
highly regarded Spartan secon
dary.
Oregon State's running game
is led by running back Lucius
High. High has rushed for 102
yards this season for a 3.3 yard
average. Fullback BryceOglesby
is also a threat, rushing for 83
yards thus far and averaging 8.3
yards per carry.

The Beavers also have a vi
cious pass rush and that could be
the key to its upset potential.
Last year Oregon State had
only two sacks the entire season,
but this year it has turned things
around, burying opposing quar
terbacks 13 times in the last two
games including seven against
San Jose State.
" "It is certainly exciting to
watch and I believe it is the men
tal aspect along with some de
fensive alignments that are giving
us some different pictures,"
Avezzano said about the new
found pass rush. "Now we feel
we are suppose to and are
capable of getting to the quarter
back. That is different from the
past."

Although there were some
breakdowns, and from a techni
cal point of view it was not a
perfect game, Wiggin felt that the
offensive line did a good job of
protecting Elway last week. The
unit must again give Elway pro
tection if the Cardinal scoring
machine is to get on the right
track.
Although all the elements
might be there for an upset by the
Beavers, Stanford guard Matt
Moran said that he will make it
his personal job to make sure that
doesn't happen.
"I don't want to see any let
down," Moran explained. "I've
seen it happen before and I don't
want to see it happen again."
A pleasant surprise for Wiggin

in last week's victory over Ohio
State was the play of tight end
Chris Dressel. Last year he
caught only 19 passes all season
and was something of a mystery.
Against the Buckeyes, Dressel re
turned to the offense. Catching
eight passes for 104 yards, he had
his best day in a Cardinal uni
form.
"The performance of Chris
Dressel in the game was outstan
ding," Wiggin said. "He was con
tinually called upon in critical sit
uations and he delivered. We're
very encouraged by the effective
ness we had going to our tight
end because Chris plays an im
portant role in our multi-faced
offense."
Although the offense played
well, it was the defense that
sealed last Saturday's victory.
The Cardinal defense allowed
only seven second half points but
stopped Ohio State's potent run
ning game in the second half of
last week's game. The secondary
which has picked off 10 passes
this year two more than all of
last season saved the game
with two interceptions late in the
fourth quarter.
Cornerback Kevin Baird, who
deflected the pass that safety
Charles Hutchings intercepted in
the final minutes of last week's
game, played his finest collegiate
game according to Wiggin.
"I would question if there was
anyone in the Fac-10 who played
better than Baird in this game,"
Wiggin said.
Avezzano was also impressed
by the Stanford defense.
"The most impressive thing in
the Ohio State game was the way
the defense came out and domi
nated the second half,"
Avezzano said last Tuesday,
"and the secondary is unlike any
we've seen so far this year.
"Barring a turnover, Stanford
is 3-0. They're a fine football
team."
It has often been said that a
punter is a defense's best friend.
In the first two weeks of the sea
son, sophomore Greg Topp per
formed the punting duties and

was averaging only 34 yards a
punt. Last week, Wiggin handed
over the punting chores to senior
walk-on Trip Hardin, and its
seems to have paid dividends.
Hardin, who isn't even listed in
the press guide, averaged 41.3
yards a punt against the Buck
eyes, including one 46-yarder
that hung in the air for nearly five
seconds.
The injury report
Card senior halfback Vincent
White the nation's leading re
ceiver with 31 catches in three
games is extremely doubtful
for today's game. White is still
suffering from a bruised shoulder
and will be replaced by senior

Mike Dotterer.
Sophomore receiver Emile
Harry is still bothered by a
bruised and sprained ankle but is
expected to start today.
The most significant injury for
Stanford occurred last week in
practice when freshman de
fensive lineman David Wyman
fractured his foot. Wyman, who
had logged significant playing
time for a freshman, is expected
to be out for four weeks.
For Oregon State, starting
noseguard Angelo Dilulo will not
play due to an injured knee.
Beaver weakside linebacker De
rek Warren is also not expected
to play.


Greg Webb/Daily
BITE THE BULLET: The Oregon State Beavers fear Stanford
quarterback John Elway's passes more than any gun around. In
the last two games with the Beavers, Elway has completed 41 of
53 passes for 559 yards and nine touchdowns.
