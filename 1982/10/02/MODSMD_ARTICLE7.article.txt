# Kenny Taylor shores up Beaver secondary
## 
### STEVE ODELL 
The Oregon State Beavers' rec
ord for ineptitude is hard to
match. The perennial doormat of
the Pacific-10 Conference, the
Beavers bring a 13-game losing
streak into today's game with
Stanford.
They are 0-3 thus far this year
and have not had a winning sea
son in recent generations.
The last two times these teams
met, Stanford steamrolled OSU
63-9 (last year) and 54-13 (1980).
John Elway is a combined 41-
for-53 (.774) for 559 yards and
nine TD's in these last two ob
literations disguised as football
games alone.
The betting line on
match-up'is 26 points.
So what chance do the Beavers

have for winning today, let alone
crawling out of their seemingly
bottomless pit and returning to
mediocrity before the year 2000?
Not a whole bunch, most
would say. But after last week's
semi-respectable 17-13 loss to
San Jose State, and with some of
the young talent OSU coach Joe
Avezzano has coerced into join
ing him in Corvallis, the light at
the end of the Beavers' tunnel
could be more than the one on
the front of Steve Harvey's Bot
tom Ten locomotive.
Kenny Taylor is one of the
youthful wonders that Avezzano
is counting on to help turn the
program around. A sophomore
starter at cornerback, Taylor is
returning home this weekend.-
Taylor attended Yerba Buena

High School in San Jose.
Elway will be out to spoil Tay
lor's personal homecoming, but
the six-foot, 174-pounder more
than held his own against one of
the other top quarterbacks in the
nation, the Spartans's Steve
Clarkson. Taylor was assigned to
touted SJS receiver Eric Rich
ardson, and he limited Rich
ardson to just one pass reception
for 16 yards.
"We were fresh and excited
and ready to play in that game,"
Taylor said in analyzing the
Beavers' performance against
San Jose (a team which also beat
the Cardinal by four, 35-31.) "It
helps your confidence but I think
we have always had the con
fidence. We just have to keep giv
ing a little more individually. To

go from 100 percent to 105 per
cent."
Taylor also realizes that it will
take more than effort, however,
to try and keep Heisman Trophy
candidate Elway, who is coming
off a 35-for-63 and 400-plus yard
national televison performance
from duplicating his feats.
"We've made changes in the
defense," Taylor said. "The
philosophies are good, but it's
the execution that is the most im
portant. It's just a matter of
doing it."
Some optimism creeped into
the Beaver camp this time about
a year ago after Oregon State
came back to nip Fresno State in
the final minutes. What followed
was 10' straight losses, so Taylor
is trying to keep the season in per-

spective.
"It looked like we could turn it
around right away," remem
bered Taylor. "But we had some
problems after that first game. I
didn't think about the losing but
rather about improving as an
individual player. I tried to help
by encouraging teammates be
cause I know we have the poten
tial to win."
Taylor will likely match up
against Emile Harry, who cor
ralled three passes against the
Beavers for 65 yards last season,
and who caught the two clutch
receptions on the game-winning
drive in last week's 23-20 victory
over Ohio State.
Still Taylor is confident. "It
doesn't matter who I take on,"
Taylor said. "1 just look forward
to playing."
