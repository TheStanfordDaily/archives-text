# Size no problem for Veris

### ADAM BERNS 
People around Columbus,
Ohio are still wondering how
Ohio State head coach Earle
Bruce ever let him get away. You
see, Bruce has a safety net around
the state, and he rarely allows a
premier high school player to get
away.
The stand out they are refer
ring to is Stanford outside line
backer Garin Veris. The 6-foot-6,
250 pound sophomore runs a 4.7
40-yard dash and could be one of
the most physically talented line
backers in college football.
Veris, from Chillicothe, Ohio,
got a chance to return home last
Saturday to play in front of his
parents and friends. Before a na
tional television audience, and in
front of nearly a hundred friends
and relatives, Veris recorded 10
tackles, one sack and one fumble
recovery as the Stanford defense
shut down Ohio State's highly re
garded rushing attack.
"I don't think there was any
added pressure for that game,"
Veris said last week. "You just
have to go out there and do your
job."
At 6-6, Veris is big for his posi
tion, but he feels that it isdefinite
lv an asset. "Being as big as I am
helps me out when I have to go
against those big fullbacks," Ver
is explained. "The disadvantage,

however, is that you are more
vulnerable to blocks at your
knees because there is so much
more leg area."
Last year Veris' freshman sea
son was marred by a nagging
shoulder bruise. Even with the in
jury, however, Veris made 36
tackles, including four sacks.
In high school, Veris earned
Parade, Football News and Na
tional Coaches All-America hon
ors. Although he missed four
games with a broken ankle, Veris
made 61 tackles as a defensive
end and caught 16 passes for 276
yards at the tight end position.
When he was recruited by
Stanford, he had high hopes of
playing tight end and catching
passes from John Elway. In fact,
the switch of Veris from tight end
to outside linebacker was one of
the most difficult ones that Wig
gin has had to make.
With three year starter Chris
Dressel firmly established at tight
end, Wiggin felt that Veris could
be more useful to the team on de
fense. Does Veris ever regret the
switch?
"It's always in the back of my
mind," Veris replied. "Next year
the coaches and I will re-evaluate
the situation but for now outside
linebacker is my position."
Veris also made his presence
known on the Stanford track

team last fall where he ranked
first in the shot put at 52-7 and
fourth in discus at 153-7. These
distances, however, were far
short of Veris' high school rec
ord, in a large part because of the
wrist injury Veris sustained last
spring during track season.
In high school, Veris was both
the state shot put and discus
champion with throws of 64-9
and 191-4.
"Coming out of high school I
had definite aspirations of com
peting in the 1984 Olympics,"
Veris said. "However, the wrist
injury which I sustained last
spring slowed my progress."

Next year the offensive and de
fensive coaches will battle it out
over who will get Veris, but in the
meantime, he is impressing peo
ple in everything he does. Last
year when he was learning the
position of outside linebacker,
Wiggin was amazed at Veris 1 nat
ural ability. Although he still had
not mastered the proper tech
nique, Veris was doing things in
practice that Wiggin had a hard
time believing.
"Garin is one of the finest ath
letes that I've ever coached,"
Wiggin said last year. "Just wait
until he starts to pick up some
technique."
This year the technique is there
and people are believing.

games with a broken ankle, Veris
made 61 tackles as a defensive
end and caught 16 passes for 276
yards at the tight end position.
When he was recruited by
Stanford, he had high hopes of
playing tight end and catching
passes from John Elway. In fact,
the switch of Veris from tight end
to outside linebacker was one of
the most difficult ones that Wig
gin has had to make.
With three year starter Chris
Dressel firmly established at tight
end, Wiggin felt that Veris could
be more useful to the team on de
fense. Does Veris ever regret the
switch?
"It's always in the back of my
mind," Veris replied. "Next year
the coaches and I will re-evaluate
the situation but for now outside
linebacker is my position."
Veris also made his presence
known on the Stanford track

team last fall where he ranked
first in the shot put at 52-7 and
fourth in discus at 153-7. These
distances, however, were far
short of Veris' high school rec
ord, in a large part because of the
wrist injury Veris sustained last
spring during track season.
In high school, Veris was both
the state shot put and discus
champion with throws of 64-9
and 191-4.
"Coming out of high school I
had definite aspirations of com
peting in the 1984 Olympics,"
Veris said. "However, the wrist
injury which I sustained last
spring slowed my progress."

Next year the offensive and de
fensive coaches will battle it out
over who will get Veris, but in the
meantime, he is impressing peo
ple in everything he does. Last
year when he was learning the
position of outside linebacker,
Wiggin was amazed at Veris 1 nat
ural ability. Although he still had
not mastered the proper tech
nique, Veris was doing things in
practice that Wiggin had a hard
time believing.
"Garin is one of the finest ath
letes that I've ever coached,"
Wiggin said last year. "Just wait
until he starts to pick up some
technique."
This year the technique is there
and people are believing.

THE CRUNCH IS ON: Stanford outside linebacker Garin
Veris likes opposing quarterbacks, but only when they are on
their backs. Veris leads the Cardinal with three sacks and loves
to blitz. He is also fifth on the team in tackles with 17.
People around Columbus,
Ohio are still wondering how
Ohio State head coach Earle
Bruce ever let him get away. You
see, Bruce has a safety net around
the state, and he rarely allows a
premier high school player to get
away.
The stand out they are refer
ring to is Stanford outside line
backer Garin Veris. The 6-foot-6,
250 pound sophomore runs a 4.7
40-yard dash and could be one of
the most physically talented line
backers in college football.
Veris, from Chillicothe, Ohio,
got a chance to return home last
Saturday to play in front of his
parents and friends. Before a na
tional television audience, and in
front of nearly a hundred friends
and relatives, Veris recorded 10
tackles, one sack and one fumble
recovery as the Stanford defense
shut down Ohio State's highly re
garded rushing attack.
"I don't think there was any
added pressure for that game,"
Veris said last week. "You just
have to go out there and do your
job."
At 6-6, Veris is big for his posi
tion, but he feels that it isdefinite
lv an asset. "Being as big as I am
helps me out when I have to go
against those big fullbacks," Ver
is explained. "The disadvantage,

however, is that you are more
vulnerable to blocks at your
knees because there is so much
more leg area."
Last year Veris' freshman sea
son was marred by a nagging
shoulder bruise. Even with the in
jury, however, Veris made 36
tackles, including four sacks.
In high school, Veris earned
Parade, Football News and Na
tional Coaches All-America hon
ors. Although he missed four
games with a broken ankle, Veris
made 61 tackles as a defensive
end and caught 16 passes for 276
yards at the tight end position.
