EVERYONE WANTS A JOB, RIGHT?
WRITE.
Daily writers have joined the staffs of such publications as The
New. York Times, The Washington Post, The Wall Street Journal,
The Los Angeles Times, Newsweek and Sports Illustrated — as
well as scores of smaller publications.
Your time at the Daily doesn't, of course, have to lead to a career
in journalism. There are plenty of other reasons to drop by to help
out your newspaper. It's never too late to sign up for photography,
night staffing, wire editing and night editing or to pick up a story
assignment from the news, features, entertainment or sports
departments.
And thanks to everyone who has stopped by already.
