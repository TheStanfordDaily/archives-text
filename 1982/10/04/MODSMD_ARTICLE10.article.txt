## Panel with McCloskey discusses U.S. press coverage of Lebanon hostilities 
### CHITRA SUBRAMANIAM 
They talked about Beirut and bombs, bias
and Begin. There was candor and controversy
as issues came to the fore and sentiments were
polarized. With each passing moment it became
increasingly clear that every member on the
panel had come armed with facts to face the
barrage of questions, expecting to be de
molished by counter-arguments, and all set to
spring back with a systematic statement about
their respective positions.
Organized by the El Camino Real (South
Bay) Chapter of Sigma Delta Chi, a pro
fessional journalists' society, the four-member
panel composed of a congressman, a journalist
and representatives from the Arab and Jewish
communities met Thursday night in Sunnyvale
to discuss the American press coverage of
events in Israel and Lebanon.
Panelist and retiring Congressman Paul
"Pete" McCloskey (R-Menlo Park), who
stirred waves of controversy recently with his
remarks about the Jewish community in the
United States, caused further ripples when he
said that politicians and the press alike were
frightened of the Jewish community and their
lobby.
Quoting. Israeli Prime Minister Menachem
Begin, McCloskey said, "Begin told Reagan,
'Don't worry about the Congress, we'll deliver
the Congress.'
"The organized Jewish lobby in this country
wants Israel to survive and prosper and that is
all right, but to say that there is no lobby is like
saying that the emperor has clothes when he is
naked," McCloskey said.
In response, panelist and Regional Director
of the B'nai B'rith Anti-Defamation League
Rhonda Abrams said that the congressman had
overstated his case.
"The organized Jewish community in the
United States takes an active part in the demo
cratic process of the country; the Jews vote out
side of their strength, and are actively involved
in community events — I would like to give the
congressman a lesson in democracy," Abrams
said, adding that it was unfair to look upon the
Jewish community as a negative force.

"We dp not get our marching orders from Is
rael as the congressman would like to believe,"
she said.
Not to be outdone, McCloskey pointed to
what he called "double standards" in her argu
ments and said that it was precisely this kind of
activity — community meetings, letter-writing
campaigns to congressmen and the media —
that constituted the lobby.
"Why not accept it instead of denying that it
exists?" he said.
Abrams took issue with the media's place
ment of stories.
"CBS in its morning news programs showed
pictures of the Lebanese people welcoming the
Israeli army, and these were not shown in the
more important evening news programs," she
said.
In response to that remark, Nawfal Umari, a
panel member and a graduate student in eco
nomics at the University, said it was somewhat
difficult to imagine the Lebanese people wel
coming the Israelis after they had bombed their
cities, and that the pictures might have been
those taken in East Beirut.
"I think it is relevant to ask why the media for
so long accepted Israel's official reconstruction
of what was taking place," Umari said. "What
has been characteristic of media coverage of the
war in Lebanon is the weight given to official Is
raeli accounts for their actions. In terms of
sheer space or time, as the case may be, Israeli
spokesmen have been permitted to fully ration
alize their actions at every step," Umari said.
He continued, "In contrast, when a CBS cor
respondent in Beirut was taken on a tour of
bombed-out buildings by a PLO representative,
he felt incumbent upon himself to remind
viewers that the PLO was attempting to sway
public opinion in the West. It is not usually felt
necessary to remind audiences that Israeli
spokemen are engaged in a propagandist ex
ercise."
A corollary to this, Umari said, was the effort
to belittle events which might encourage public
opinion to take a favorable view of the PLO.
"The prime example is of course Yasser
Arafat's meeting with the pope, which was
qualified as 'controversial.' Actually it was con

iroversial onlv in the United States primarily
because the media chose to make it so. An NBC
correspondent described the Pope's reception
of Arafat as a meeting with 'this former Muslim
gunrunner' — apparently it is a crime to be a
Muslim and illegitimate to use force when you
are stateless," Umari said.
"Here one comes up against the problem that
what is rightly denounced as anti-Semitism
when directed against the Jews is tolerable when
directed against Arabs," he added.
Umari said he felt that now for the first time
Israeli public statements were not taken at face
value, and this manifested itself in subtle
changes in the media. Citing an example from
the San Jose Mercury, Umari said, "This morn
ing's Mercury had a story on the Palestinians
that said, 'These are an angry people, dis
possessed again' and this reference is a con
firmation that the homelessness of the Palesti
nians is finally being seen for what it is, the core

of the conflict in the Middle East."
Jerry Ceppos, associate editor of the
Mercury, and the only panelist representing the
journalistic community, said that many stories
appearing biased to the reader did so mainly be
cause of constraints that were inherent in the
media.
"I believe that the coverage of events in Israel
and Lebanon bv and large has been fair — if I
had to do it again, I might do some things dif
ferently, but those who feel that stories were im
balanced should attribute that more to ig
norance and limited resources rather than to
any journalistic bias," Ceppos said.
Ceppos, who prefaced his remarks by saying
that editors got "flak" from both sides, no mat
ter what they did, said that the question of im
balance in news reporting was something that
concerned all journalists.
"There certainly is no nefarious plot to
portray events in a particular manner," he said.

In replv, McCloskey said while there was no
"nefarious plot," there were more Jewish re
porters and editors than Arab ones.
"Hence news coverage was favorable to Is
rael," he concluded.
Umari also suggested that bias came through
in what the journalists chose to report and what
they ignored.
"However, I would liketoemphasizethatitis
ultimately the media which has brought about
the change in the public's perceptions of the
Palestinians," he said.
Returning to the question of democracy,
Abrams said she was very pleased to see that
400,000 people had turned out in Tel Aviv to
protest the massacre of Palestinian and Leba
nese refugees in the their camps.
"This tells me that people in Israel are al
lowed to express their opinions freely," she
said.
