## Kevin Gross Freeze will give Soviets the edge 
### 
"Nuclear war can't be won. Everyone loses." Thus begins
a brochure from the Califomians for a Bilateral Nuclear
Weapons Freeze, which is pushing for votes for Proposition
12 on the November ballot. Unfortunately, the brochure
suggests that a nuclear arms freeze is a simple, clear issue:
"choose life."
Actually, a freeze is one of the most dangerous ideas ever
to receive publicity in recent years. Smear tactics and gross
simplification bv the "Yes on 12" Committee have distorted
the real issue of American safety with wild exaggerations
about the possibility of a nuclear holocaust.
The truth of the matter is that the danger of nuclear war
(or any war) is higher today than ever before, due to the mili
tary superiority of the Soviet Union. The Soviet Union has a
6:1 advantage in missile power, a 2:1 naval advantage, a 4:1
tank and artillery advantage and an incredible 47:1 advan
tage in defensive strategic weapons, according to the movie
"The Salt Syndrome." Clearly, a weapons freeze of any kind
would leave the United States in an inferior position.
It is irrelevant to sav that each country has the power to
blow each other up 30 times. The facts indicate that the Sovi
et's do not subscribe the MAD (Mutual Assured De
struction) theorv, upon which Prop. 12 rests. The Soviet
Union has an active civil defense program that includes
schools, industry, and housing plans. They are preparing for
war, not peace. Thus, Moscow supports a nuclear freeze,
which would leave them with a clear advantage in any future
war.
A freeze won't eliminate the possibility of nuclear war.

Moscow will still be able to kill 50 percent of the U.S. popu
lation, while losing only 10 percent of its country to nuclear
missiles. The Soviets believe they can win a nuclear war. A
freeze gives them added incentive to reach their goal of world
communism.
Should one trust a country that uses yellow rain (chemical
warfare â€” Outlawed since World War I) to kill thousands of
innocent civilians? Should one trust a country that sup
presses all peace movements within its borders? Should one
trust a country that rejects nuclear arms reductions and trea
ty verification?
Obviously, a nuclear freeze is not the solution to arms con
trol. Why ij the freeze so popular? For one, there is reason to
believe that secret Soviet money is being pumped into the
campaign, through innocent-looking sources. Second, liber
als like the issue because it could reduce defense appropria
tions and increase the amounts available for expensive social
programs. And third, the freeze movement has been boosted
by frightening films and publications which portray massive
destruction, emphasizing the horror of nuclear war.
The freeze is, however, a dangerous idea that stays with us
despite those who espouse realistic policies. It is tragic that
so many liberal politicians have put ideology before safety
(i.e., welfare before national defense) and have deluded mil
lions of people. Don't be fooled by liberal politicians such as
tdward Kennedy (D-Mass.) and Gov. Brown. Proposition
12 will send the wrong signal.
