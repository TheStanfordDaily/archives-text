## Mexico, with intelligent planning, could have avoided controls 
### 
On September 1, 1982, Mexican Pres
ident Lopez Portillo, seeing the peso
fallen to a quarter of its value in dollars
in half a year, denounced the "looting"
of the economy and announced un
precedented currency controls and the
nationalization of private banks.
On September 1, 1981, Portillo de
rided skeptics who doubted the sound
ness of the Mexican economy, said that
foreign reserves were abundant and the
financial position of the country had
never been sounder and pointed to the
great achievements of his adminis
tration and its oil-based prosperity.
There had been five years of un
precedented boom. The peso seemed
stable at 26.5 to the dollar. Oil and gas
export revenues had risen steadily and
sharply from near nothing in 1976 to
about $14 billion in 1981, a bonanza un
paralleled in Mexican history. Mexico
boasted that it, unlike other major pe
troleum producers, was using its reven
ues judiciously to build up the econo
my; and over.a million new jobs were
created annually, checking the chronic
unemployment of the ever-growing la
bor force. The GNP grew annually,
propelling Mexico rapidly toward the
status of an economically developed na
tion.
Indeed, Mexico had, as of a year ago,
a very fine record. From 1940 to 1981,
the economy grew about 6 percent per
year, possibly the greatest growth in the
world for that period. Moreover, Mexi
co seemed a political model, apparently
the most stable countrv of the Third
World. The constitution adopted at the
close of the revolutionary turmoil in

1917 has never been set aside, and the
sequence of elected presidents has been
almost completely orderly since 1920 —
entirely so since 1934. There have been
regular elections and appearances of
democracy along with firm control by a
single party during these many decades.
Since the '30s, the Mexican military
forces have been politically less influen
tial than in any other Latin American
countrv except Costa Rica. Many per
sons elsewhere in Latin America have
admired Mexico's ability to manage
democratic institutions and yet avoid
dictatorship.
The key elements of Mexican stabil
ity are the governing Institutional Rev
olutionary Party, which integrates all
sectors of society with the state, and the
prohibition of presidential reelection.
Through the partv apparatus, the presi
dent is a virtual dictator for six years. It
is testimony to his power that Portillo
could simply announce currency con
trols and nationalization of banks
without a word of consultation outside
his intimates. But after six years, the
president places the sash on the man he
has picked as his successor. Hope
springs ever green, and the people
always believe the new boss will really
improve things, and the outs can always
dream their turn will come. Unlike such
decadent dictatorships as those of
Somoza in Nicaragua or the late shah of
Iran, the Mexican system gets a fresh
start every six years with new people
and new policies.
, But a new president brings some
50,000 hungrv followers to high posi

tions. In their six years, they have little
time to achieve anything, as the first
couple of years are spent-getting or
ganized and the last two are dedicated
to preparing for the next job-hunting
season. But the six years can be effec
tively used to promote personal for
tunes. It is an opportunity that may not
be repeated, and many an official has
emerged a millionare from his stint. Of
fice-holding has become the greatest
means of personal advancement — and
corruption — from policemen who set
tle a real or imaginary traffic violation
for a few pesos to a host of inspectors
and paper pushers and clerks who hold
multiple jobs and share the extra

salaries with the boss, up to the people
around the president. Such personal ad
vancement is the curse of the Mexican
state. It is probably the biggest single
factor in the current crisis.
Since appointments are made by per
sonal favor, political relations are all
important; and Mexico is governed by a
host of intermeshing cliques. At the top
are a few hundred persons of the "Rev
olutionary Family." Despite the popu
list talk resulting from long-past revolu
tionary upheaval, corruption creates in
equality, and the gap between the rich
and the poor in Mexico is among the
widest in the world.
The poor, consequently, have bene
fited little from the growth of the econo

my; and discontents were rising in the
'70s, especially in the countryside, be
cause of land shortage. Meanwhile,
Mexico City acquired the hemisphere's
(if not the world's) biggest slums as the
poor drifted to the center of power and
wealth. Meanwhile, the costs of govern
ment continued to rise several times
faster than the growth of the economy,
deficits grew and inflation followed, in
juring the poor especially. Mexico was
headed for trouble by the beginning of
Portillo's government in 1976. It got a
reprieve from the black tide of oil, as

ever-new discoveries raised estimates of
reserves to rival those of Saudi Arabia.
Mexico was suddenly and happily rich,
and enough wealth trickled out of the
oilfields or down from the corporate
and government offices to give the
whole country a new glow.
But .it was too much to expect the
petrobillions to be well-managed. The
government built costly public works,
and impractical industrial projects be
came white elephants. Worse, the intox
ication of big money raised the thirst for
more. Confident in ever-rising oil prices
and revenues, the government bor
rowed huge sums abroad to make
dreams come true, incidentally to en
rich the bureaucrats. Looking at Mexi
co's resources, the big banks were natu

rally eager to lend. Spending speeded
up inflation (to 30 percent in 1981) and
caused pressure on the peso, but the
government resisted devaluation. Then,
in mid-1981 came the notorious oil glut.
Prices actually declined only 10 percent
to 20 percent from their peak, but rev
enues fell far behind optimistic expecta
tions. The deficit reached 14 percent of
GNP. Rather than painfully reducing
expenditures, the government increased
borrowing, and the international banks
• kept cheerfully lending. In 1981, the
foreign debt rose from $34 billion to $52
billion.
By the beginning of 1982, debt
payments were consuming most of the
decreased export earnings, and insiders
seem to have begun taking their assets
to more secure climates. The avalanche
began. The peso was devalued by 40
percent in February, but government
spending continued to soar, the deficit
rising to about 18 percent of GNP. In
flation, exacerbated by wage increases
amounting to 70 percent in the first
months of the year, surged on. The
flight from the peso accelerated. Price
controls instituted in March only in
creased difficulties, and inflation was
heading toward 100 percent by Septem
ber. Businesses that had expanded by
borrowing dollars could not repay
dollars at the new rates, and many had
to close. Unemployment shot up to
about 50 percent bv the common esti
mate. In August a new exchange con
trol system was established, and the
peso sank like a stone in water. The gov
ernment reneged on the promise that
those who held dollar accounts in Mexi
can banks could get dollars back. Then
Portillo instituted exchange controls of
the kind usually applied by communist
countries, while blaming the private
banks for facilitating the loss to Mexico
in tens of billions of dollars, and in re
venge nationalizing them.
This seems to have been a popular
move. It looked decisive and provided a
scapegoat. The leftists applauded on
ideological grounds, and it opened up a
new gravy pot for the politicians. But it
cannot change much. Half of Mexico's
banking system was already govern
ment-held, and the private banks were
closely controlled by regulations and

political pressures. The confidence of
foreign investment will be lost, and new
loans to tide Mexico over a read
justment period will be harder to get.
The exchange regulations can only in
crease the desirability of dollars, which
were reported to cost as much as 150
pesos on the black market. Currency
speculation cannot be prevented
without controls which Mexico is too
inefficient and corrupt to make effec
tive. The to\irist trade, a big dollar
earner, wil be hard hit by any attempt to
check all money taken in or out of the
country.
It may be a major step toward social
ism. Mexico has already gone so far in
that direction, with half of the GNP in
government hands before the na
tionalization of the banks. Not only are
Pemex, electricity, much transporation
and so forth nationalized, but govern
ment corporations control much or all
of many branches, from fishing to for
est products and airlines. The sad ex
perience of many Third World coun
tries with socialism, from Burma to
Tanzania, is not encouraging; and the
corruption and inefficiency endemic in
the Mexican economy can only be in
creased by its further politicization.
The crisis has come to a country with
good resources for no real reason other
than the weakness and foolishness of
the government. The steps taken do not
seem likely to halt the decline of the
standard of living, and discontents are
likely to rise. In the past, the Mexican
system has handled discontents by
dividing the opposition, co-opting
some and repressing others. It may
prove difficult in the future to maintain
the good order of the past.
In similar circumstances elsewhere in
Latin America, soldiers have taken
charge. In Mexico, this alternative has
been ruled out. But military forces have
grown from 80,000 in 1978 to about
120,000, and their equipment has much
improved. They tend to be strictly an
ticommunist, and if they come to feel
the system is hopelessly corrupt or per
ceive a danger of leftist radicalism, they
might well feel called upon to assume
responsibility.
