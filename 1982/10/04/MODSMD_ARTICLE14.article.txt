## Criticism of inadequate picture caption voiced 
### 
Considering the lofty tone of your
editor's essay in the inaugural issue
(Daily, Sept. 27), I find it particularly
offensive to see a serious disregard for
journalistic ethics seven pages later. Ac
companying two stories of Stanford
football victory against Ohio State last
week are two pictures: one of John
Elway passing, the other of Emile
Harry catching a football. These are
purported to be pictures of the winning
catch from the game, one imagines.
They are not. Stanford wore their vis
iting white uniforms in Columbus;
these pictures show Elway and Harry in
their home, i.e., dark, uniforms.
Is this trivial objection? I don't think
so. Simply, the Daily lied to us in its
presentation of a news story. This vio
lates our trust, without which any news
organization is worthless. Reporters
have been fired for exactly the breach of
ethics you committed on September 27.
Although you may believe that a college
daily may be run by more lax principles
than commercial papers require, it is a
part of your legacy that your predeces

sors fought all the way to the Supreme
Court of the United States to protect
the integrity of the Daily. We should be
able to expect as much of you.
I think you owe the University com
munity an apology.

U.S. must share
blame for Beirut
It is astounding that Robert Wesson,
in his commentary on the Beirut
massacre, should state that "massacre
has become very largely a Third World
activity." I hope that few of us in the
"advanced industrial countries" feel
this is something we can "congratulate

ourselves" on. Whether a massacre
takes place in Central America, the
Mideast, Southeast Asia or southern
Africa, as Americans we must share the
blame. Our misguided foreign policy
and avaricious pursuit of arms sales
directly and indirectly cause and ex
acerbate such conflicts.
As to the purported affluence of this
country as a deterrent to war, we should
perhaps pay more attention to the tur
moil in our own urban areas and won
der about its roots. Then we might take
at look at those "poorer regions of the
earth" to which "war has been limited"
and wonder not only how they became
poor but also who benefits by the wits
waged there.
Finally, I will grant that publicity has
at times been an enforcer of morality.
But then I ask why the media seems to
ignore of play down selected im
moralities, such as the treatment of
native Americans in this country, of
blacks in South Africa, or of Palesti

nians in their native land.

Headline misleading
Regarding my article of Sept. 29, I
would like to clarify the following:
Your choice of the headline
"Massacre a Part Of Israeli Policy" was
misleading as to the content of the arti
cle. My purpose was to describe the
broad sweep of Israel's aggression
against Lebanon and the Palestinians.
The text of my article was also con
fusing so that it appeared that the Lon
don Times had reported that the de
struction of blocks of residential build
ings in Sidon were carried out with
"surgical accuracy." On the contrary,
this phrase has been used by Israeli
spokesmen to describe the blitz on Leb
anon. It also was confused regarding a
quotation from Al Hamishmar, an Is
raeli newspaper.

at look at those "poorer regions of the
earth" to which "war has been limited"
and wonder not only how they became
poor but also who benefits by the wits
waged there.
Finally, I will grant that publicity has
at times been an enforcer of morality.
But then I ask why the media seems to
ignore of play down selected im
moralities, such as the treatment of
native Americans in this country, of
blacks in South Africa, or of Palesti

nians in their native land.

Headline misleading
Regarding my article of Sept. 29, I
would like to clarify the following:
Your choice of the headline
"Massacre a Part Of Israeli Policy" was
misleading as to the content of the arti
cle. My purpose was to describe the
broad sweep of Israel's aggression
against Lebanon and the Palestinians.
The text of my article was also con
fusing so that it appeared that the Lon
don Times had reported that the de
struction of blocks of residential build
ings in Sidon were carried out with
"surgical accuracy." On the contrary,
this phrase has been used by Israeli
spokesmen to describe the blitz on Leb
anon. It also was confused regarding a
quotation from Al Hamishmar, an Is
raeli newspaper.
