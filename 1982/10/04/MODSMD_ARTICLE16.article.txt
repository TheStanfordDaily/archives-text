# Full moon tradition continues in the Quad
## 
### DANA RATLIFF 
Last night's full moon pro
vided the first opportunity this
academic year for the hundreds
of freshman females who will be
transformed into Stanford wom
en by senior men.
According to Stanford lore,
the moonlit kiss in the Quad in
front of Memorial Church by a
senior man has been a steadfast
requirement for those females
wishing to become full-fledged
Stanford women.
Many students of all classes
routinely gather each lunar
month for their chance to do
their part to keep Stanford's sa
cred tradition alive.
Taking advantage of the op
portunity, many senior men tote
identification signs to inform
frosh women of their availability
to participate in the evening's fes
tivities.
This origin of this tradition is
unclear: even longtime alumni of
the Farm cannot pinpoint exactly
when this midnight event began,
and written records are almost
non-existent. Bright senior
pranksters may have started the
entire event as a joke.
One Stanford song written in

1945 by C.K. Fields, "Poor Little
Indian Maid," does make a rare
historic reference to the midnight
occasion, suggesting that, this
tradition has been going on for at
least 37 years.
The song first describes the
new freshman woman: "She had
never seen the quad by moon
light/ By the stock farm she had
never strayed/ She had never
seen the mausoleum/ Poor little
Indian maid."
Involving a freshman instead
of the traditional senior man, the
song continues: "So the
freshman lent his aid/ Just to in
troduce the maid, to the glories of
the farm/ And he spent his
monthly ration on an ice cream
dissipation/ Now he damns his
coeducation on the Stanford
farm." Subtle references to in
troducing the young maiden to
Stanford suggest the present mid
night kiss transforming the
freshman females into real Stan
ford women.
Who knows whether the song
or the tradition came first? At
any rate, the Quad will remain
the most popular hang-out under
a full moon for years to come .
