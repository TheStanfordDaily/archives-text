# University rejects arbitration offer
## 
### DAVID AZRIN Senior staff writer 
The University rejected a United Stanford Workers
(USW) proposal last week that would have sent strik
ing workers back to their jobs before a final settlement
was agreed upon.
Under the union's proposal, presented during
Thursday's unsuccessful negotiations, the workers
would have returned to their jobs while an advisory
arbitration team considered the issues involved in the
dispute.
Both negotiating teams would then have had the
chance to accept or reject the advisory team's recom
mendations. The union membership would also have
been able to vote whether to accept the proposal or to
return to the picket lines.
In an effort to pressure the University into changing
their hard-line bargaining stance, the union on Friday
released a confidential report written by the Univer
sity's compensation department. The report recom
mended first-year wage increases more than 3.5 per
cent higher than the University's most recent offer.
The report recommended the University increase
union wages by at least 13 to 15 percent in the first year
in order to make them competitive with wages paid by
area employers. The University's last proposal would
give workers a 9.5 percent across-the-board increase
in the first year.
According to Michael Baratz, executive secretary of
USW, the University's rejection of his proposal for an
advisory arbitration team "just proves what we've
been saying, that they're trying to break the union and
to scare workers in the face of the hospital organizing
drive.
"I made a thousand different proposals and low
ered almost all of my demands. My last straw was to
present them with the advisory proposal and when

they still said 'no' that's when we knew that we had to
go public with this report (from the University's com
pensation department)," said Baratz.
Baratz said his proposal to return workers to their
jobs was "just as radical a proposal as any labor leader
could ever make at this point in this kind of situation."
The University rejected the union's proposal be
cause they did not want a third party entering into the
collective bargaining process, according to Clarence
Washington, one of two federal mediators who has
participated in the negotiations.
Felix Barthelemy, manager of employee relations,
refused to comment on the union's proposal late last
night. Priscilla Wheeler, head of the University nego
tiating team, could not be reached for comment.
The confidential report by the University's com
pensation department substantiates the union's claim
that the University's latest proposal will not bring the
wages of Stanford workers up to the level of area em
ployers in the first year.
"Their own compensation department recom
mended pretty much what we're asking for and they
are just ignoring their own compensation depart
ment," said Kathy McKennan, a member of the union
negotiating team.
Barthelemy dismissed the significance of the recom
mendations, claiming that the University took into
consideration the recommendations before they pre
sented their latest proposal.
Referring to the recommendations, Barthelemy
said, "That is not much unlike what we did (in the
most recent University proposal), except that we
didn't do it all in the first year."
Barthelemy also said the compensation depart
ment's recommendations did not take into considera
tion other important factors that affect any final pro
posal presented by the University.

"Norma Starr (author of the recommendations) is a
compensation analyst. Her job is to look at the market
and make recommendations purely from what the
market says. She doesn't deal with other factors. She
doesn't look at what the University's budgets are,
what the University is doing or what they are plan
ning," he said.
"It's a bombshell," said Baratz. "It just proves that
our proposals have been reasonable."
The University's last proposal presented Sept. 17
which offered only a 9.5 percent across-the-board in
crease in union wages in the first year falls short of the
report's recommendations.
The report states: "We recommend an eight to 10
percent range adjustment for all classifications. In ad
dition we recommend adding a five percent Step 4 to
increase the range spread to 15 percent. This would re
sult in a total program of 13 to 15 percent the first year
in addition to the proposed reallocations . . .
Barthelemy confirmed that these compensation de
partment recommendations were made.
The University's second year proposal would in
crease wages across-the-board 5 percent and add a
new step of 2.5 percent.
The confidential report, based on a survey of area
employers conducted by the University, reported that
the University's average salaries lagged behind the
market by 6 to 12 percent and that maximum salaries
lagged by 10 to 18 percent. Barthelemy confirmed
these figures.
Data released by the union claims that University
maximum wages lag behind area competitors by 10 to
30 percent. Barthelemy said the figures were "fairly
accurate," but emphasized that they do not provide an
accurate comparison of average salaries.
"Most of our data shows that we are paying ex
cessive wages at the minimums," he said.

Felix Barthelemy, manager of employee relations,
refused to comment on the union's proposal late last
night. Priscilla Wheeler, head of the University nego
tiating team, could not be reached for comment.
The confidential report by the University's com
pensation department substantiates the union's claim
that the University's latest proposal will not bring the
wages of Stanford workers up to the level of area em
ployers in the first year.
"Their own compensation department recom
mended pretty much what we're asking for and they
are just ignoring their own compensation depart
ment," said Kathy McKennan, a member of the union
negotiating team.
Barthelemy dismissed the significance of the recom
mendations, claiming that the University took into
consideration the recommendations before they pre
sented their latest proposal.
Referring to the recommendations, Barthelemy
said, "That is not much unlike what we did (in the
most recent University proposal), except that we
didn't do it all in the first year."
Barthelemy also said the compensation depart
ment's recommendations did not take into considera
tion other important factors that affect any final pro
posal presented by the University.

"Norma Starr (author of the recommendations) is a
compensation analyst. Her job is to look at the market
and make recommendations purely from what the
market says. She doesn't deal with other factors. She
doesn't look at what the University's budgets are,
what the University is doing or what they are plan
ning," he said.
"It's a bombshell," said Baratz. "It just proves that
our proposals have been reasonable."
The University's last proposal presented Sept. 17
which offered only a 9.5 percent across-the-board in
crease in union wages in the first year falls short of the
report's recommendations.
The report states: "We recommend an eight to 10
percent range adjustment for all classifications. In ad
dition we recommend adding a five percent Step 4 to
increase the range spread to 15 percent. This would re
sult in a total program of 13 to 15 percent the first year
in addition to the proposed reallocations . . .
Barthelemy confirmed that these compensation de
partment recommendations were made.
The University's second year proposal would in
crease wages across-the-board 5 percent and add a
new step of 2.5 percent.
The confidential report, based on a survey of area
employers conducted by the University, reported that
the University's average salaries lagged behind the
market by 6 to 12 percent and that maximum salaries
lagged by 10 to 18 percent. Barthelemy confirmed
these figures.
Data released by the union claims that University
maximum wages lag behind area competitors by 10 to
30 percent. Barthelemy said the figures were "fairly
accurate," but emphasized that they do not provide an
accurate comparison of average salaries.
"Most of our data shows that we are paying ex
cessive wages at the minimums," he said.
The University rejected a United Stanford Workers
(USW) proposal last week that would have sent strik
ing workers back to their jobs before a final settlement
was agreed upon.
Under the union's proposal, presented during
Thursday's unsuccessful negotiations, the workers
would have returned to their jobs while an advisory
arbitration team considered the issues involved in the
dispute.
Both negotiating teams would then have had the
chance to accept or reject the advisory team's recom
mendations. The union membership would also have
been able to vote whether to accept the proposal or to
return to the picket lines.
In an effort to pressure the University into changing
their hard-line bargaining stance, the union on Friday
released a confidential report written by the Univer
sity's compensation department. The report recom
mended first-year wage increases more than 3.5 per
cent higher than the University's most recent offer.
The report recommended the University increase
union wages by at least 13 to 15 percent in the first year
in order to make them competitive with wages paid by
area employers. The University's last proposal would
give workers a 9.5 percent across-the-board increase
in the first year.
According to Michael Baratz, executive secretary of
USW, the University's rejection of his proposal for an
advisory arbitration team "just proves what we've
been saying, that they're trying to break the union and
to scare workers in the face of the hospital organizing
drive.
"I made a thousand different proposals and low
ered almost all of my demands. My last straw was to
present them with the advisory proposal and when

they still said 'no' that's when we knew that we had to
go public with this report (from the University's com
pensation department)," said Baratz.
Baratz said his proposal to return workers to their
jobs was "just as radical a proposal as any labor leader
could ever make at this point in this kind of situation."
The University rejected the union's proposal be
cause they did not want a third party entering into the
collective bargaining process, according to Clarence
Washington, one of two federal mediators who has
participated in the negotiations.
