## Elway eclipses career yardage mark Stanford hammers OSU again 
### SID SPAETH 
Masterful John Elway, who
handles what is thrown at him as
well as he throws, stared down a
nine-man Oregon State defensive
line yesterday and fired for his
fourth straight 300-yahi game,
directing Stanford to a 45-5 rout
of lowly Oregon State.
Elway's 23-for-29, 381-yard
performance moved him into
first place on the Stanford career
passing ladder with 7610 yards.
He also broke Jack Thomp
son's Pacific-10 career comple
tion record. He now has thrown
623 complete passes.
Elway riddled the Oregon
State secondary for five touch
downs despite leaving the game
after one offensive series in the
second half.
"He (coach Paul Wiggin)
could have left me in to try and
run up the stats," Elway said,
"but it doesn't do anything for
your confidence or your ego.
There are plenty of guys who go
out and work five days a week
just like I do and can do the job."
But it was obvious no one was
to be as effective as Elway.
Last year Oregon State threw a
three-man rush and eight de
fensive backs at Elway. Yester
day, they put nine men on the line
of scrimmage and managed to get
at Elway five times, but Wiggin
said that is not enough.
"They brought all nine guys up
to the line of scrimmage and
created blocking scheme prob
lems for us," Wiggin explained.
"It was a clever plan. They'd

eventually back out and we
would have to re-establish our
call and declare who was going to
stay there and who was going to
back out.
"They lived by the sword and
died by it," Wiggin continued.
"Elway picked them to pieces.
No. 7 (Elway) can move in the
pocket like no one else. If you are
going to be fooling around up
there, you better get him on the
grass every time."
Oregon State's plan worked
for exactly one play. Elway saw
the alignment on the first play
and tried to audible, but was
called for delay of game. After
that, it was a 10-play, 74-yard
drive climaxed by a 34-yard
touchdown pass to Shaun Avant
— his first reception as a
Cardinal.
Defensive end Maurice Porter
led a one-man crusade against
Elway with eight tackles, includ
ing four sacks.
"I'm going to nominate that
(number) 74 (Porter) for de
fensive player of the week," Wig
gin said.
Elway fired two touchdown
passes to flanker Mike Tolliver,
who dropped that many touch
down passes against Ohio State
last week.
"Today was a great confidence
builder," Tolliver said. "It (last
week's dropped passes) was
heavy on my mind all week. To
drop two touchdown passes .. .
that's my strong point. I was wor
ried about it."

ELWAY ERASES MARK: Stanford quarterback John Elway
passed for 381 yards Saturday to become the all-time Cardinal
passing yardage leader. He also passed for five TDs, giving him
14 career touchdown passes against Oregon State.
Emile Harry split the middle of
the Oregon State secondary for a
43-vard touchdown reception
and Eric Mullins capped Stan
ford's touchdowns outracing ev
eryone with a 51-yarder in Stan
ford's first series of the second
half.
Elway completely tied up the
Beaver secondary, completing
passes to nine Stanford players
from every eligible position and
pass route imaginable.
112 "They couldn't stay with
Emile (Harry) or Tolliver or Eric
Mullins," Elway said. "It was
just a matter of time before we
got our blocking straightened
out. They were trying to play
man-under and they just couldn't
do it."
-"The man (Elway) is in
credible," OSU free safety Terry
Harris said. "I've never played
against a better quarterback. No
matter what we tried, he some
how found his receivers. I
thought we played real wejl, but
he's uncanny. He has my vote for
all the honors."
Oregon State Joe Avezzano,
frustrated with his offense,
agreed.
"I'll be damned if anybody is

better than Elway," Avezzano
said. "He docs that to any team.
Without Elway, Stanford is a
completely different team. With
him, they can win against any
team. We tried to disguise our de
fense, but he has the uncanny
knack of getting the ball to his re
ceiver. Stanford has some pretty
good receivers."
Mike Dotterer bulled over for
a five-yard touchdown and
kicker Mark Harmon booted a
48-yard field goal and mailed in
six extra points to give him 46
straight without a miss to con
clude Stanford scoring.
Defensively, the Cardinal
shined in the morass of Oregon
State ineptitude. Five muffed
snaps and three illegal procedure
calls resulted from Oregon State
centers's inability to snap the ball
in the prescribed chronological
order.
"We were constantly plagued
bv (quarterback) Jeff Seay and
the center with bad snaps," Ore
gon State coach Joe Avezzano
said. "We changed centers, but
he forgot to snap the ball. The
mental edge was not there.
"Overall, our offensive play
was incredibly bad," Avezzano
continued. "We had no killer in

stinct. We could very easily have
scored 25 or more points, but we
didn't have the fortitude to do
it."
Oregon State scored on a 45-
yard Chris Mangold field goal
and when Stanford's long snap
per rifled a punt snap over the
head of punter Tripp Hardin and
out of the end zone for a safety.
The Cardinal intercepted three
Seay passes, giving them 13 for
the season.
"We have emphasized that (in
terceptions) from the first day,"
Wiggin said. "We've gotten bet
ter pressure and coverage under
neath and we are breaking for the
ball better. We create the per
centages for an interception be
cause we have more people there
than do."
Wjggin was loathe to celebrate
the wide-margin victory. "We
have a big game next week and
we had too many people limping
up the hill," he said.
Stanford had 14 injuries, but
none appear to be serious.

Masterful John Elway, who
handles what is thrown at him as
well as he throws, stared down a
nine-man Oregon State defensive
line yesterday and fired for his
fourth straight 300-yahi game,
directing Stanford to a 45-5 rout
of lowly Oregon State.
Elway's 23-for-29, 381-yard
performance moved him into
first place on the Stanford career
passing ladder with 7610 yards.
He also broke Jack Thomp
son's Pacific-10 career comple
tion record. He now has thrown
623 complete passes.
Elway riddled the Oregon
State secondary for five touch
downs despite leaving the game
after one offensive series in the
second half.
"He (coach Paul Wiggin)
could have left me in to try and
run up the stats," Elway said,
"but it doesn't do anything for
your confidence or your ego.
There are plenty of guys who go
out and work five days a week
just like I do and can do the job."
But it was obvious no one was
to be as effective as Elway.
Last year Oregon State threw a
three-man rush and eight de
fensive backs at Elway. Yester
day, they put nine men on the line
of scrimmage and managed to get
at Elway five times, but Wiggin
said that is not enough.
"They brought all nine guys up
to the line of scrimmage and
created blocking scheme prob
lems for us," Wiggin explained.
"It was a clever plan. They'd

eventually back out and we
would have to re-establish our
call and declare who was going to
stay there and who was going to
back out.
"They lived by the sword and
died by it," Wiggin continued.
"Elway picked them to pieces.
No. 7 (Elway) can move in the
pocket like no one else. If you are
going to be fooling around up
there, you better get him on the
grass every time."
Oregon State's plan worked
for exactly one play. Elway saw
the alignment on the first play
and tried to audible, but was
called for delay of game. After
that, it was a 10-play, 74-yard
drive climaxed by a 34-yard
touchdown pass to Shaun Avant
— his first reception as a
Cardinal.
Defensive end Maurice Porter
led a one-man crusade against
Elway with eight tackles, includ
ing four sacks.
"I'm going to nominate that
(number) 74 (Porter) for de
fensive player of the week," Wig
gin said.
Elway fired two touchdown
passes to flanker Mike Tolliver,
who dropped that many touch
down passes against Ohio State
last week.
"Today was a great confidence
builder," Tolliver said. "It (last
week's dropped passes) was
heavy on my mind all week. To
drop two touchdown passes .. .
that's my strong point. I was wor
ried about it."

ELWAY ERASES MARK: Stanford quarterback John Elway
passed for 381 yards Saturday to become the all-time Cardinal
passing yardage leader. He also passed for five TDs, giving him
14 career touchdown passes against Oregon State.
Emile Harry split the middle of
the Oregon State secondary for a
43-vard touchdown reception
and Eric Mullins capped Stan
ford's touchdowns outracing ev
eryone with a 51-yarder in Stan
ford's first series of the second
half.
Elway completely tied up the
Beaver secondary, completing
passes to nine Stanford players
from every eligible position and
pass route imaginable.
112 "They couldn't stay with
Emile (Harry) or Tolliver or Eric
Mullins," Elway said. "It was
just a matter of time before we
got our blocking straightened
out. They were trying to play
man-under and they just couldn't
do it."
-"The man (Elway) is in
credible," OSU free safety Terry
Harris said. "I've never played
against a better quarterback. No
matter what we tried, he some
how found his receivers. I
thought we played real wejl, but
he's uncanny. He has my vote for
all the honors."
Oregon State Joe Avezzano,
frustrated with his offense,
agreed.
"I'll be damned if anybody is

better than Elway," Avezzano
said. "He docs that to any team.
Without Elway, Stanford is a
completely different team. With
him, they can win against any
team. We tried to disguise our de
fense, but he has the uncanny
knack of getting the ball to his re
ceiver. Stanford has some pretty
good receivers."
Mike Dotterer bulled over for
a five-yard touchdown and
kicker Mark Harmon booted a
48-yard field goal and mailed in
six extra points to give him 46
straight without a miss to con
clude Stanford scoring.
Defensively, the Cardinal
shined in the morass of Oregon
State ineptitude. Five muffed
snaps and three illegal procedure
calls resulted from Oregon State
centers's inability to snap the ball
in the prescribed chronological
order.
"We were constantly plagued
bv (quarterback) Jeff Seay and
the center with bad snaps," Ore
gon State coach Joe Avezzano
said. "We changed centers, but
he forgot to snap the ball. The
mental edge was not there.
"Overall, our offensive play
was incredibly bad," Avezzano
continued. "We had no killer in

stinct. We could very easily have
scored 25 or more points, but we
didn't have the fortitude to do
it."
Oregon State scored on a 45-
yard Chris Mangold field goal
and when Stanford's long snap
per rifled a punt snap over the
head of punter Tripp Hardin and
out of the end zone for a safety.
The Cardinal intercepted three
Seay passes, giving them 13 for
the season.
"We have emphasized that (in
terceptions) from the first day,"
Wiggin said. "We've gotten bet
ter pressure and coverage under
neath and we are breaking for the
ball better. We create the per
centages for an interception be
cause we have more people there
than do."
Wjggin was loathe to celebrate
the wide-margin victory. "We
have a big game next week and
we had too many people limping
up the hill," he said.
Stanford had 14 injuries, but
none appear to be serious.

Masterful John Elway, who
handles what is thrown at him as
well as he throws, stared down a
nine-man Oregon State defensive
line yesterday and fired for his
fourth straight 300-yahi game,
directing Stanford to a 45-5 rout
of lowly Oregon State.
Elway's 23-for-29, 381-yard
performance moved him into
first place on the Stanford career
passing ladder with 7610 yards.
He also broke Jack Thomp
son's Pacific-10 career comple
tion record. He now has thrown
623 complete passes.
Elway riddled the Oregon
State secondary for five touch
downs despite leaving the game
after one offensive series in the
second half.
"He (coach Paul Wiggin)
could have left me in to try and
run up the stats," Elway said,
"but it doesn't do anything for
your confidence or your ego.
There are plenty of guys who go
out and work five days a week
just like I do and can do the job."
But it was obvious no one was
to be as effective as Elway.
Last year Oregon State threw a
three-man rush and eight de
fensive backs at Elway. Yester
day, they put nine men on the line
of scrimmage and managed to get
at Elway five times, but Wiggin
said that is not enough.
"They brought all nine guys up
to the line of scrimmage and
created blocking scheme prob
lems for us," Wiggin explained.
"It was a clever plan. They'd

eventually back out and we
would have to re-establish our
call and declare who was going to
stay there and who was going to
back out.
"They lived by the sword and
died by it," Wiggin continued.
"Elway picked them to pieces.
No. 7 (Elway) can move in the
pocket like no one else. If you are
going to be fooling around up
there, you better get him on the
grass every time."
Oregon State's plan worked
for exactly one play. Elway saw
the alignment on the first play
and tried to audible, but was
called for delay of game. After
that, it was a 10-play, 74-yard
drive climaxed by a 34-yard
touchdown pass to Shaun Avant
— his first reception as a
Cardinal.
Defensive end Maurice Porter
led a one-man crusade against
Elway with eight tackles, includ
ing four sacks.
"I'm going to nominate that
(number) 74 (Porter) for de
fensive player of the week," Wig
gin said.
Elway fired two touchdown
passes to flanker Mike Tolliver,
who dropped that many touch
down passes against Ohio State
last week.
"Today was a great confidence
builder," Tolliver said. "It (last
week's dropped passes) was
heavy on my mind all week. To
drop two touchdown passes .. .
that's my strong point. I was wor
ried about it."

ELWAY ERASES MARK: Stanford quarterback John Elway
passed for 381 yards Saturday to become the all-time Cardinal
passing yardage leader. He also passed for five TDs, giving him
14 career touchdown passes against Oregon State.
Emile Harry split the middle of
the Oregon State secondary for a
43-vard touchdown reception
and Eric Mullins capped Stan
ford's touchdowns outracing ev
eryone with a 51-yarder in Stan
ford's first series of the second
half.
Elway completely tied up the
Beaver secondary, completing
passes to nine Stanford players
from every eligible position and
pass route imaginable.
112 "They couldn't stay with
Emile (Harry) or Tolliver or Eric
Mullins," Elway said. "It was
just a matter of time before we
got our blocking straightened
out. They were trying to play
man-under and they just couldn't
do it."
-"The man (Elway) is in
credible," OSU free safety Terry
Harris said. "I've never played
against a better quarterback. No
matter what we tried, he some
how found his receivers. I
thought we played real wejl, but
he's uncanny. He has my vote for
all the honors."
Oregon State Joe Avezzano,
frustrated with his offense,
agreed.
"I'll be damned if anybody is

better than Elway," Avezzano
said. "He docs that to any team.
Without Elway, Stanford is a
completely different team. With
him, they can win against any
team. We tried to disguise our de
fense, but he has the uncanny
knack of getting the ball to his re
ceiver. Stanford has some pretty
good receivers."
Mike Dotterer bulled over for
a five-yard touchdown and
kicker Mark Harmon booted a
48-yard field goal and mailed in
six extra points to give him 46
straight without a miss to con
clude Stanford scoring.
Defensively, the Cardinal
shined in the morass of Oregon
State ineptitude. Five muffed
snaps and three illegal procedure
calls resulted from Oregon State
centers's inability to snap the ball
in the prescribed chronological
order.
"We were constantly plagued
bv (quarterback) Jeff Seay and
the center with bad snaps," Ore
gon State coach Joe Avezzano
said. "We changed centers, but
he forgot to snap the ball. The
mental edge was not there.
"Overall, our offensive play
was incredibly bad," Avezzano
continued. "We had no killer in

stinct. We could very easily have
scored 25 or more points, but we
didn't have the fortitude to do
it."
Oregon State scored on a 45-
yard Chris Mangold field goal
and when Stanford's long snap
per rifled a punt snap over the
head of punter Tripp Hardin and
out of the end zone for a safety.
The Cardinal intercepted three
Seay passes, giving them 13 for
the season.
"We have emphasized that (in
terceptions) from the first day,"
Wiggin said. "We've gotten bet
ter pressure and coverage under
neath and we are breaking for the
ball better. We create the per
centages for an interception be
cause we have more people there
than do."
Wjggin was loathe to celebrate
the wide-margin victory. "We
have a big game next week and
we had too many people limping
up the hill," he said.
Stanford had 14 injuries, but
none appear to be serious.
