## Elway eclipses career yardage mark Stanford hammers OSU again 
### SID SPAETH 
Masterful John Elway, who
handles what is thrown at him as
well as he throws, stared down a
nine-man Oregon State defensive
line yesterday and fired for his
fourth straight 300-yahi game,
directing Stanford to a 45-5 rout
of lowly Oregon State.
Elway's 23-for-29, 381-yard
performance moved him into
first place on the Stanford career
passing ladder with 7610 yards.
He also broke Jack Thomp
son's Pacific-10 career comple
tion record. He now has thrown
623 complete passes.
Elway riddled the Oregon
State secondary for five touch
downs despite leaving the game
after one offensive series in the
second half.
"He (coach Paul Wiggin)
could have left me in to try and
run up the stats," Elway said,
"but it doesn't do anything for
your confidence or your ego.
There are plenty of guys who go
out and work five days a week
just like I do and can do the job."
But it was obvious no one was
to be as effective as Elway.
Last year Oregon State threw a
three-man rush and eight de
fensive backs at Elway. Yester
day, they put nine men on the line
of scrimmage and managed to get
at Elway five times, but Wiggin
said that is not enough.
"They brought all nine guys up
to the line of scrimmage and
created blocking scheme prob
lems for us," Wiggin explained.
"It was a clever plan. They'd

eventually back out and we
would have to re-establish our
call and declare who was going to
stay there and who was going to
back out.
"They lived by the sword and
died by it," Wiggin continued.
"Elway picked them to pieces.
No. 7 (Elway) can move in the
pocket like no one else. If you are
going to be fooling around up
there, you better get him on the
grass every time."
Oregon State's plan worked
for exactly one play. Elway saw
the alignment on the first play
and tried to audible, but was
called for delay of game. After
that, it was a 10-play, 74-yard
drive climaxed by a 34-yard
touchdown pass to Shaun Avant
â€” his first reception as a
Cardinal.
Defensive end Maurice Porter
led a one-man crusade against
Elway with eight tackles, includ
ing four sacks.
"I'm going to nominate that
(number) 74 (Porter) for de
fensive player of the week," Wig
gin said.
Elway fired two touchdown
passes to flanker Mike Tolliver,
who dropped that many touch
down passes against Ohio State
last week.
"Today was a great confidence
builder," Tolliver said. "It (last
week's dropped passes) was
heavy on my mind all week. To
drop two touchdown passes .. .
that's my strong point. I was wor
ried about it."
