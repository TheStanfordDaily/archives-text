## Saturday's painful game 
### 
There was pain in Joe
Avezzano's face Saturday as
he entered the locker room
where the post-game in
terview was taking place. It

The Odes Factor

was hard for him to grasp the
right words he wanted to say,
but somehow the atmosphere
of total dejection that con
tinued to fill the room as
Avezzano sipped on his Pepsi
said it all.
Stanford had just humil
iated his team 45-5.
Oregon State has won one
football game in the two and
one-half years of Avezzano's
tenure in Corvallis.
By nature an optimistic
coach, Avezzamo seemed hit
by the futility of the Beavers
situation Saturday.
"To play in this league,
you've got to grow up quick,"
he said, "and we're just not
growing up fast enough."
OSU's ineptness was no
more obvious than in the fact
that they fumbled the center
snap five times. And then,
when Avezzano inserted sec
ond string center Bob
Kornmann into the line-up,
Kornmann forgot to snap the
ball on three occasions, result
ing in procedure penalties.
Avezzano's deep and husky
voice reverberated off the cold
steel lockers. "As an offensive

football coach, as I have been
all my career, I am just total
ly ... disgusted."
"I just can't express how
upset I am," Avezzano said.
"I really don't think it would
be too classy to, either."
The Beavers are suffering
from an inferiority complex,
brought on by 12 consecutive
losing seasons.

Somewhere during the
middle of a rousing rendition
of "Fat Bottomed Girls" by
the Stanford and Oregon
State bands Saturday, the
Beavers had a chance to get in
the end zone.
There was 10:15 remaining
and the Beavers had a fourth
and five on the Stanford sev
en.
Ed Singler, the Beavers'
back-up quarterback,
dropped back to pass (after
nearly fumbling the snap) and

threw over the middle some
where in the vicinity of one of
his receivers. The ball, re
sembling a one-winged duck
nearing the end of an around
the-world flight, fell to the
turf. It was indicative of the
Beavers' offensive per
formance all day.
The Orange and Bleak's
deepest offensive penetration
of the game had ended. And it
appeared that nobody cared.
The sun was hot and the
beer was flowing freely. Elway
showed he is as good or better
than everyone thinks he is.
The Beavers showed they are
as bad or worse than everyone
thinks they are. There is a lit
tle over ten minutes left in a
game in which Stanford leads
by forty points.
But somewhere underneath
all of the partying and
statistics and scoring Satur
day, there was pain in Joe
Avezzano's face.
When Singler dropped
back for that fourth down
pass in the fourth quarter, 1
think everyone in the stadium
suspected OSU would fail to
get the first down. More im
portantly, Singler and his
teammates knew they
wouldn't get the first down.
They didn't, and it really
wouldn't have changed the
game if they had.
But don't think it didn't
matter.
