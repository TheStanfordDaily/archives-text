# Tolliver regains confidence with two touchdowns in Cardinal win
## 
### ADAM BERNS 
Mike Tolliver, it seems, can smell the end zone from a mile away.
The senior receiver who led the Cardinal with seven touchdown re
ceptions last year (he has three in four games this year) paced Stanford
in its rout of Oregon State, catching two passes in the endzone in the
45-5 drubbing.
Most people feel that it is more difficult to get open in the end zone
because the receivers have less room to work with. Conventional wis
dom has often said that while passing teams may move the ball well,
they have a hard time scoring points. For Tolliver, it is just the op
posite. When the catches really matter, he feels that he is at his best.
"I just kind of concentrate more," Tolliver said about his knack for
getting open when it really counts. "A lot of times when you make
hard fakes in the end zone, the DBs (defensive backs) bite more.
The two touchdown catches served sort of a dual purpose Saturday.
Besides being instrumental in building Stanford's 35-3 halftime lead, it
also helped to re-establish Tolliver's confidence after he dropped two
touchdown passes last week against Ohio State. "This was a con
fidence-building day for me," he said after the game.
On the day, Tolliver caught four passes for 50 yards. All of the
catches came in the first half before Stanford started giving some of its
second stringers game experience.
The first touchdown catch came with 7:30 left in the first quarter.
With the ball on the Oregon State six-yard line, Elway hit Tolliver with
a short pass in the corner of the end zone for the Cardinal score.
"It was just basic man-under coverage," Tolliver explained. "They
were trying to funnel me to the middle, but I jumped inside of him
(thedefensive back) which he was not supposed to let me do. He then
overreacted to get back in position and I was able to get back outside."
T olli ver's second touchdown catch came at the end of the half. With
only 26 seconds left and the ball on the Beaver eight yard-line, Elway
rolled right and hit Tolliver on a down-and-out pattern.
"That pass was a simple out," said Tolliver. "When 1 made my cut
to the outside, he (the cornerback) pushed me right into the pattern.
"A lot of times things like that happen when you're in the end zone.
The defensive back is just sitting there waiting for you. If you get on
the side of the break, he pushes you into your cut."

Oregon State was using a Jot of different looks, trying to confuse
Elway. The Beavers would show a nine-man front and then often drop
off into coverage. Their biggest mistake, according to Tolliver, was
trying to use man-under coverage all day.
In man-under coverage, the two cornerbacks follow both the wide
receivers with the safeties taking the receivers deep. The key for the
success of this coverage is to have a good pass rush. Although the
Beavers sacked Elway five times, it was not enough to stop Stanford's
potent attack.
"If you don't get to the quarterback when you play man-under,
you're in trouble," Tolliver explained. "Because it's a man-to-man
coverage, you have to get the backs to turn the wrong way. This type of
pattern, however, takes time. If you can't get to the quarterback in
time, the DBs are going to be in trouble.
"The other problem with man-under coverage," Tolliver added, "is
that you are wasting four defensive backs on only two people. That
often leaves the middle open which is why (Chris) Dressel was hurting
them."
Because of Dressel's effectiveness and the pass receiving ability of
the running backs, Tolliver feels that teams cannot continue to play
strictly man-under coverage against Stanford in the future. This
should open up the passing lanes even more for Tolliver and
sophomore split end Emile Harry in upcoming games.
"In the future, I see teams trying to mix up a lot of different types of
zones and then putting in an occasional man-to-man to try to confuse
us," Tolliver said.
While Saturday's game seemed more like a Cakewalk than a football
game, the Cardinal will be in for a real test next week against the Ari
zona State Sun Devils.
"They have the best defense in the nation," Tolliver said after Satur
day's aerial circus. "They might try to man us (use man-to-man cov
erage) because they have great defensive backs.
"Next week is the biggest game so far this year," Tolliver added. "If
we win next week, people will have to start to watch out for us. Once
we do that we should also gain a lot more confidence."
Which is what Tolliver was busy doing himself Saturday

time, the DBs are going to be in trouble.
"The other problem with man-under coverage," Tolliver added, "is
that you are wasting four defensive backs on only two people. That
often leaves the middle open which is why (Chris) Dressel was hurting
them."
Because of Dressel's effectiveness and the pass receiving ability of
the running backs, Tolliver feels that teams cannot continue to play
strictly man-under coverage against Stanford in the future. This
should open up the passing lanes even more for Tolliver and
sophomore split end Emile Harry in upcoming games.
"In the future, I see teams trying to mix up a lot of different types of
zones and then putting in an occasional man-to-man to try to confuse
us," Tolliver said.
While Saturday's game seemed more like a Cakewalk than a football
game, the Cardinal will be in for a real test next week against the Ari
zona State Sun Devils.
"They have the best defense in the nation," Tolliver said after Satur
day's aerial circus. "They might try to man us (use man-to-man cov
erage) because they have great defensive backs.
"Next week is the biggest game so far this year," Tolliver added. "If
we win next week, people will have to start to watch out for us. Once
we do that we should also gain a lot more confidence."
Which is what Tolliver was busy doing himself Saturday

TWO FOR TOLLIVER: Stanford flankerback Mike Tolliver hauls in one of his two touchdown
grabs against OSU Saturday. He now has three for the season.
Mike Tolliver, it seems, can smell the end zone from a mile away.
The senior receiver who led the Cardinal with seven touchdown re
ceptions last year (he has three in four games this year) paced Stanford
in its rout of Oregon State, catching two passes in the endzone in the
45-5 drubbing.
Most people feel that it is more difficult to get open in the end zone
because the receivers have less room to work with. Conventional wis
dom has often said that while passing teams may move the ball well,
they have a hard time scoring points. For Tolliver, it is just the op
posite. When the catches really matter, he feels that he is at his best.
"I just kind of concentrate more," Tolliver said about his knack for
getting open when it really counts. "A lot of times when you make
hard fakes in the end zone, the DBs (defensive backs) bite more.
The two touchdown catches served sort of a dual purpose Saturday.
Besides being instrumental in building Stanford's 35-3 halftime lead, it
also helped to re-establish Tolliver's confidence after he dropped two
touchdown passes last week against Ohio State. "This was a con
fidence-building day for me," he said after the game.
On the day, Tolliver caught four passes for 50 yards. All of the
catches came in the first half before Stanford started giving some of its
second stringers game experience.
The first touchdown catch came with 7:30 left in the first quarter.
With the ball on the Oregon State six-yard line, Elway hit Tolliver with
a short pass in the corner of the end zone for the Cardinal score.
"It was just basic man-under coverage," Tolliver explained. "They
were trying to funnel me to the middle, but I jumped inside of him
(thedefensive back) which he was not supposed to let me do. He then
overreacted to get back in position and I was able to get back outside."
T olli ver's second touchdown catch came at the end of the half. With
only 26 seconds left and the ball on the Beaver eight yard-line, Elway
rolled right and hit Tolliver on a down-and-out pattern.
"That pass was a simple out," said Tolliver. "When 1 made my cut
to the outside, he (the cornerback) pushed me right into the pattern.
"A lot of times things like that happen when you're in the end zone.
The defensive back is just sitting there waiting for you. If you get on
the side of the break, he pushes you into your cut."

Oregon State was using a Jot of different looks, trying to confuse
Elway. The Beavers would show a nine-man front and then often drop
off into coverage. Their biggest mistake, according to Tolliver, was
trying to use man-under coverage all day.
In man-under coverage, the two cornerbacks follow both the wide
receivers with the safeties taking the receivers deep. The key for the
success of this coverage is to have a good pass rush. Although the
Beavers sacked Elway five times, it was not enough to stop Stanford's
potent attack.
"If you don't get to the quarterback when you play man-under,
you're in trouble," Tolliver explained. "Because it's a man-to-man
coverage, you have to get the backs to turn the wrong way. This type of
pattern, however, takes time. If you can't get to the quarterback in
