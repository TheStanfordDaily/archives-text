# Water poloists win weekend tourney

### CHRIS ADDINGTON 
The No. 3 ranked Cardinal wa
ter polo team emerged unscathed
from this weekend's Nor-Cal wa
ter polo tournament at DeGuerre
pool to improve its record to 10-2
for the season. Many people
questioned whether this year's
team of redshirts, transfers,
sophomores and a few regulars
could once again capture the
NCAA crown, but in the words
of Cardinal coach Dante Det
tamanti, "These games have got
to make believers of us that we
can win the NCAA's."
Stanford opened up Friday
morning against the Air Force
Academy. Aided by five goals
from sophomore Tom Lampert,

and three apiece from seniors
James Bergeson, John Tanner
and Kirk Jensen, the Cardinal
pounded the cadets 17-3.
The Cardinal's second opening
round game against Fresno State
proved to be more of a contest.
The Bulldogs held on to trail
Stanford by a single goal at half
time. However, Stanford found
its mark eight times in the second
half to bring the final score to
Stanford 12, Fresno 6.
These two victories advanced
the Cardinal into Saturday's win
ner's bracket as Stanford took on
the No. 2-ranked Berkeley Bears
in the tournament's most-highly
touted matchup. Cal r eached its
spot in the winner's division by

defeating UC-San Diego and
UC-Davis in opening round ac
tion.
Berkeley jumped to a quick
two goal lead before Bergesen
evened the score with two of his
own in the middle of the second
quarter. Once again Cal scored
twice, and the Cardinal found
itself down 4-2 at the beginning
of the third period.
And then it started. Goals by
Jeff Stiling, Lampert, Curtis
Hanst, Bergeson and two by
Tanner, with no answer from Cal
left the score at 8-4 in the middle
of the final period. The Bears had
two pride-saving goals in the
closing seconds and the final
scoreboard showed Stanford 8,

California 6.
Dettamanti added his own
thoughts to the Cal game. "We
are really starting to mature as a
team," he said. "We just slowly
chipped away at their lead and
didn't panic."
Dettamanti praised the play of
Bergeson and Lampert, who is
starting for the injured Greg
Lambert. "Tom (Lampert) con
trolled his shots and played great
defense. I was really pleased,"
Dettamanti said.
Stanford's final game of the
tourney came three hours later
against the University of the Pa
cific. The Tigers showed some
tenacity after many years of

four of its matches.
cellar-dwelling in the national
rankings, but it wasn't enough to
upset the Cardinal.
UOP struck twice early in the
game, but Stanford fought back
to lead 4-2 at the half, and 6-4 at
the end of the third period. UOP
closed to within one, but Stan

ford's Stiling scored his third
goal of the match as the Cardinal
squeezed out a 7-5 victory.
In a later afternoon game, Cal

tough time this upcoming week
end as two teams travel to De-
Guerre pool to take on the
Cardinal.
