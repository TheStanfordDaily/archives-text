### SHAILENDRA BHUMRALKAR 
The Stanford women's cross
country team scored an im
pressive victory this weekend at
the Cal Women's Invitational.
The Cardinal finished with 19
points, beating out Oregon with
40, California with 75, and Ne
vada-Reno with 99.
Stanford placed the top three
finishers in the 5000 meter event.
Senior team captain Kim
Schnurpfeil set a course record of
16:46, edging sophomore stand
out Ceci Hopp, who had a time of
16:49. Finishing third was

sophomore Regina Jacobs with a
time of 17:01. Ellen Lyons and
Anne Locke ran sixth and sev
enth overall with times of 17:35
and 17:37, respectively.
The victory was notable be
cause Coach Brooks Johnson
held out two of his top runners,
Alison Wiley and PattiSue
Plumer because Oregon had two
people out and Johnson wanted
to test his team by forcing them
to run even against Oregon.
Johnson said he was pleased
with Schnurpfeil race because she
was "coming back Tokyo
and was suffering from a case of

jet lag as well as the flu."
Johnson also said, "Regina
(Jacobs) was our biggest surprise.
She has come from oblivion to be
a solid person in our top five."
Saturday's win was significant
because Stanford was able to de
feat Oregon. Both teams had
been ranked evenly before the
meet, but Johnson said, "Stan
ford's biggest competitor is Stan
ford."
Johnson expected to be a top
contender because many of his
top runners return from last
year's team that finished third
nationally. But he cautions, "We

are a good team, but we are not
yet the best team. First we have to
joust with our own windmills and
get those licked."
Johnson listed among the top
teams in the nation Stanford,
Virginia, Oregon, North Caroli
na State, Clemson and "some
team that will get it together and
come out of nowhere." He said
that the Cardinal must be on the
lookout for such a team because
"that's what we did last year."
Stanford will host the Stanford
College Invitational Saturday at
10 a.m. at the Stanford Golf
Course.
