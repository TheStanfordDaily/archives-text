It may not have been picture
perfect, but the Cardinal wom
en's volleyball team captured top
honors at the Berkeley Invita
tional this weekend.
Four teams participated in the
round robin tournament: Stan
ford, California, Cal Poly, San
Luis Obispo and the University
of San Diego.
Cal, Cal Poly and Stanford
.tied at the finish of the tour
ornament with 2-1 records, but the
.Cardinal won the tournament
wjth the the fewest total game
losses. The Card lost only three
games to Cal and Cal Poly's four.
The Card's lone defeat was to
Cal which led Head Coach Fred
Sturm to term the tournament

win "not completely satisfying."
Deanna Boyette and Kim
Oden were named to the All-
Tournament team, and Sturm
commented that their honors
were "well-deserved."
Thursday the Card takes on
conference-leading San Diego
State at 7:30 p.m. at Maples
Pavillion. Coach Sturm ex
pressed confidence about the up
coming match even though the
Cardinal lost to SDSU
once already. "The girls have
been working hard to improve,"
said Sturm, "and I've been
pleased with their effort. The last
time we played them ... we beat
ourselves just as much as they did
us. This time we'll be better pre
pared."
