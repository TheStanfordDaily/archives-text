The arrest of union leader Michael
Baratz and two others and a paint
throwing "melee" at a campus con
struction site punctuated heavy pick
eting Friday by striking members of
United Stanford Workers (USW).
After a quiet weekend, the union
planned reiififwetf'ttctivity around con
struction sites today.
Stanford police are readying war
rants for the arrest of strikers and con
struction workers involved in a melee at
the Braun Music Center site, Sgt. Rick
Enberg told the Daily last night. Red
paint was thrown on construction
workers' cars after a shouting match be
tween the two groups, he said.
USW Executive Secretary Baratz and
negotiating team member Charles
Lacy, a Stanford Linear Accelerator
Center (SLAC) employee, were ar
rested on charges of blocking traffic at
the SLAC entrance Friday morning.
Both were released from the San Mateo
County Jail on their own recognizance.
Linda Crouse, a laborer at Tresidder
Union, was arrested on similar charges
at Bonair Siding Friday afternoon.

Baratz said he believed San Mateo
County Sheriffs officers singled him
out for arrest. "It was a set-up. They
were looking for me to intimidate the
rest of the members."
Shortly after his release, Baratz was
back on the line. "These people don't
intimidate me," he said. He will be ar
raigned Oct. 18.
About 20 pickets from US Wand oth
er area unions delayed construction at
the new housing project Friday morn
ing by blocking a secondary gate which
had been set up expressly for non-Stan
ford employees.
"As far as I'm concerned there's no
main gate and no reserve gate," said a
union field representative as the group
tried to convince arriving workers to
honor their picket line.
A skeleton crew of laborers and
bricklayers was scheduled to work Fri
day. Those first on the scene had found
themselves shut out by an unfamiliar
chain and lock. Police cut the gate open
about 7 a.m.
Plasterer Lou Olivier wasn't happy
about the pickets blocking his path to
work. "I don't think this thing is legal
under the two-gate system. This is the

second time they've pulled this," he
said.
Picketing began before dawn Friday
at Bonair Siding, where about 50
strikers gathered around a fire, sipping
coffee, chanting slogans and chatting.
"The University won't negotiate.
That's what it's all about," said long
time labor leader Julia Harvey, a re
search assntMt retired from the Medi
cal School. "I worked at Stanford for
many years. I always looked on the
University as very paternalistic. If
someone was sick, gee, they'd keep
them on for a year without firing them.
"But it's become a big business. It's
become more famous. The attitude
toward its workers has changed,"
Harvey said.
Harvey said the upcoming vote on
unionization at Stanford Hospital is
one of the University's concerns. "With
the hospital election coming up the
University is trying to convince ev
eryone 'We'll give you more of a pay in
crease if you stay out of a union. You
don't need a union.'
"You can see that just isn't true. They
wouldn't have even talked to us if we
didn't have a union," she said.
