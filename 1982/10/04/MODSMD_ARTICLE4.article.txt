# National ratings of faculty not expected to affect departments
## 
### KRISTEN CHRISTOPHER Senior staff writer 
Stanford's faculty received the highest rating in computer
science and shared the top score in statistics-biostatistics in a
recent national survey of math and science professors. The
results, however, may not have much effect on those depart
ments or others which did not fareas well, according to some
department heads here.
The rankings were constructed by the media from re
ported figures. The figures which led to the media rankings
were based on a survey of approximately eight percent of the
country's math and science professors.
Along with the top rankings in computer science and
statistics-biostatistics, the University received ratings of
sixth in chemistry, geosciences and mathematics and tied for
seventh in physics.
While professors from some of those departments ex
pressed pleasure or disappointment with their rankings, they
cited a variety of factors which deem the survey less crucial
than it might appear.

"They (the rankings) have some measure of gratification
... but that was not the aim of the study," said Lincoln
Moses, professor of statistics here and a member of the com
mittee which conducted the survey.
The rankings were generated from figures representing the
quality of the faculty based on ratings from a survey of pro
fessors. However, that survey was only "a part of a much
larger study," according to Pepper Leeper, a spokesman for
the National Academy of Sciences which aided in financing
the the studv.
When other factors such as department size or publishing
record of the faculty are taken into account, the rankings be
come less significant, according to Leeper.
Stanley Wojcicki, chairman of the Physics Department,
said he was not pleased with the ranking they received but
suspects that Stanford's smaller department adversely af
fected their ranking. It is difficult to compare Stanford's de
partment of 25 faculty members with Berkeley or MlT's
which have 60 or 70 members, he said.
That the data was collected during the past academic year

is another factor which affects the significance of the rank
ings.
John Brauman, chairman of the Chemistry Department,
said, "At that time, we were in the process of a number of
resignations and we had a couple of retirements — a fairly
critical problem." He said he feels his department is stronger
now that several appointments have been made.
While the timing of the survey worked against the
Chemistry Department, it was beneficial for the Computer
Science Department, according to Chairman Gene Golub.
"A couple of faculty members left in the last year" so their
ranking might not be as high now, he said.
The study was done, according to Leeper, to help students
select a graduate school and to replace a 1970 American
Council on Education report. The rankings from that report
had been criticized because they were based on reputation.
While the new study provides a broad spectrum of in
formation for prospective graduate students, it is not in
tended to affect the number of applications schools receive,
and most likely will not do so.

"People go to a place for a very specific field or for a par
ticular person, so it shouldn't make much difference," Wo
jcicki said. He predicted that the study's effect on applica
tions may be a slight dip comparable in numbers to the slight
boost which occurs after a Stanford physicist receives a
Nobel Prize. The interest fades quickly, he said, and"the
number of applications has remained pretty constant over
the years."
The number of applications received by the Computer Sci
ence Department next year will probably not be greatly in
creased by the survey results, because Stanford has already
established an outstanding reputation in that field, accord
ing to Golub. He said there may be some increase "if (the
study) is widely publicized where people do not have as
much knowledge about which universities are good." He
added that the study "might also be detrimental because
when people hear Stanford is good in this area, we might get
calls from 'head-hunters' in New York or Missouri."
Golub, Wojcicki and Brauman all
stressed the strength of their depart
ments but indicated they are always
working toward improvement regard
less of distinctions, which they feel are
difficult to make.
"I think we have an extremely strong
department, but it is hard to make com
parisons," Brauman said of the
Chemistry Department. "Obviously,

Td like to see it number one."
Wojcicki remarked of the Physics
Department, "In some aspects we are as
good as any department in the country
... and I think we can do better than
(number seven)."
"We are in the process of making the
(Computer Science) department even
better," Golub said. "Even being
number one, there are improvements
that can be made."
Although the University's computer
science faculty received the survey's
highest rating, an undergraduate degree

is not offered by that department, nor
are there plans to begin one. Golub said
that is because of the "tremendous
shortage of people for academic posi
tions."
Stanford instead concentrates on
training computer science teachers, he
said, and currently "produces about 10
percent of the Ph.D. s in the U.S." An
undergraduate interested in computer
science can get "fairly good training"
by majoring in mathematical sciences,
he added.

John Brauman, chairman of the Chemistry Department,
said, "At that time, we were in the process of a number of
resignations and we had a couple of retirements — a fairly
critical problem." He said he feels his department is stronger
now that several appointments have been made.
While the timing of the survey worked against the
Chemistry Department, it was beneficial for the Computer
Science Department, according to Chairman Gene Golub.
"A couple of faculty members left in the last year" so their
ranking might not be as high now, he said.
The study was done, according to Leeper, to help students
select a graduate school and to replace a 1970 American
Council on Education report. The rankings from that report
had been criticized because they were based on reputation.
While the new study provides a broad spectrum of in
formation for prospective graduate students, it is not in
tended to affect the number of applications schools receive,
and most likely will not do so.

"People go to a place for a very specific field or for a par
ticular person, so it shouldn't make much difference," Wo
jcicki said. He predicted that the study's effect on applica
tions may be a slight dip comparable in numbers to the slight
boost which occurs after a Stanford physicist receives a
Nobel Prize. The interest fades quickly, he said, and"the
number of applications has remained pretty constant over
the years."
The number of applications received by the Computer Sci
ence Department next year will probably not be greatly in
creased by the survey results, because Stanford has already
established an outstanding reputation in that field, accord
ing to Golub. He said there may be some increase "if (the
study) is widely publicized where people do not have as
much knowledge about which universities are good." He
added that the study "might also be detrimental because
when people hear Stanford is good in this area, we might get
calls from 'head-hunters' in New York or Missouri."
Golub, Wojcicki and Brauman all
stressed the strength of their depart
ments but indicated they are always
working toward improvement regard
less of distinctions, which they feel are
difficult to make.
"I think we have an extremely strong
department, but it is hard to make com
parisons," Brauman said of the
Chemistry Department. "Obviously,

Td like to see it number one."
Wojcicki remarked of the Physics
Department, "In some aspects we are as
good as any department in the country
... and I think we can do better than
(number seven)."
"We are in the process of making the
(Computer Science) department even
better," Golub said. "Even being
number one, there are improvements
that can be made."
Although the University's computer
science faculty received the survey's
highest rating, an undergraduate degree

is not offered by that department, nor
are there plans to begin one. Golub said
that is because of the "tremendous
shortage of people for academic posi
tions."
Stanford instead concentrates on
training computer science teachers, he
said, and currently "produces about 10
percent of the Ph.D. s in the U.S." An
undergraduate interested in computer
science can get "fairly good training"
by majoring in mathematical sciences,
he added.
Stanford's faculty received the highest rating in computer
science and shared the top score in statistics-biostatistics in a
recent national survey of math and science professors. The
results, however, may not have much effect on those depart
ments or others which did not fareas well, according to some
department heads here.
The rankings were constructed by the media from re
ported figures. The figures which led to the media rankings
were based on a survey of approximately eight percent of the
country's math and science professors.
Along with the top rankings in computer science and
statistics-biostatistics, the University received ratings of
sixth in chemistry, geosciences and mathematics and tied for
seventh in physics.
While professors from some of those departments ex
pressed pleasure or disappointment with their rankings, they
cited a variety of factors which deem the survey less crucial
than it might appear.

"They (the rankings) have some measure of gratification
... but that was not the aim of the study," said Lincoln
Moses, professor of statistics here and a member of the com
mittee which conducted the survey.
The rankings were generated from figures representing the
quality of the faculty based on ratings from a survey of pro
fessors. However, that survey was only "a part of a much
larger study," according to Pepper Leeper, a spokesman for
the National Academy of Sciences which aided in financing
the the studv.
When other factors such as department size or publishing
record of the faculty are taken into account, the rankings be
come less significant, according to Leeper.
Stanley Wojcicki, chairman of the Physics Department,
said he was not pleased with the ranking they received but
suspects that Stanford's smaller department adversely af
fected their ranking. It is difficult to compare Stanford's de
partment of 25 faculty members with Berkeley or MlT's
which have 60 or 70 members, he said.
That the data was collected during the past academic year

is another factor which affects the significance of the rank
ings.
