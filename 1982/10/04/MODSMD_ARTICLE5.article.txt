Six Israelis die in ambush

Beirut — Gunmen ambushed an Israeli troop bus southeast of Beirut yes
terday in Israeli-controlled territory near Syrian lines, killing six soldiers and
injuring 16, Israeli army officials said.
There was no indication last night who the gunmen were, but Palestinian
guerrillas previously have carried out several ambushes and laid mines on
roads in areas occupied by Israel in southern and eastern Lebanon.
The number of Israeli casualties in the attack was believed to be the
highest in any incident since the end of the fighting in Beirut and the evac
uation of Palestinian guerrillas from the city in late August. There was im
mediate concern here last night that Israel would retaliate with a raid on Syr
ian positions in Lebanon's eastern Bekaa Valley, as it has on similar occa
sions in the past. Israel repeatedly has said that it holds the Syrians respon
sible for any Palestinian guerrillas who infiltrate Israeli lines and stage at
tacks.
In Beirut, Lebanese newspapers reported that President Amin Gemayel
wants to form an interim Cabinet, headed by Lebanon's security chief and
including other military men, that would have wide powers to impose law
and order.
Several dailies quoted official sources as saying Gemayel would announce
his choice for prime minister by today.
The French-language L'Orient-Le Jour quoted sources
close to President Gemayel as saying it appeared almost
certain that his choice for prime minister would be the se
curity chief, Brig. Gen. Ahmed El-Hajj. It said El-Hajj
docs not belong to any "political clans."
An-Nahar did not mention El-Hajj by name, but said
Gemayel most likely will choose someone from outside
"the club of former prime ministers." Under Lebanon's
power-sharing agreement, Gemayel, a Christian, must
appoint a Sunni Moslem as prime minister.
U.S. special envoy Philip Habib met with Syrian Presi
dent Hafez Assad in Damascus yesterday to discuss the
American-proposed plan for a simultaneous withdrawal
of Syrian and Israeli troops from Lebanon. Afterward
Habib left for Rome on his way back to Washington.
Israeli helicopters arrived almost immediately to evac
uate the wounded, while other soldiers aided by Christian
militamen set up roadblocks and began to hunt for the
assailants.
Following the incident, Israel was expected to insist
even more firmly on the withdrawal first of the remaining
Palestinian guerrillas fromn Lebanon as part of any over
all agreement on the removal of foreign troops.
Marines may stay in Lebanon
Washington — The 1200 U.S. Marines in Lebanon
could remain there for a minimum of four to six months,
according to government officials who say Americans
should be braced for further casualties like the death of
one Marine and wounding of three others last week when
an artillery shell exploded during mine-clearing opera
tions.
President Reagan has said the Marines must stay as
part of a multinational force until re-establishment of a
Lebanese government with real authority and removal of
Israeli and Syrian troops from the country. By all
assessments, these are the prerequisites for pushing the
president's stalled Middle East peace initiative beyond
the talking stage.
Reagan and other U.S. officials have stressed repeated
ly that the Marines' mission is meant to be a short oiW.
They used phrases such as "of limited duration" and "a
few weeks."
Behind the scenes, however, officials speak about a
minimum stay of four to six months — for the Lebanese
government and army to re-establish authority in Beirut
and then for that authority to spread in stages into areas
vacated by withdrawing Israelis and Syrians. As more
than one policy-maker noted, little seems to go as sched
uled in Lebanon.
This would not preclude an agreement being reached
more quickly on the framework for withdrawal of foreign
forces. U .S. special envoy Philip Habib spoke in terms of
a few weeks during a visit to Cairo late last week, accord
ing to Egyptian officials, and Israeli Foreign Minister

Yitzhak Shamir said Sunday that Habib has told Israel
that Syria is "ready in principle" to withdraw.
Such progress on withdrawal, U.S. officials say, may
be enough to give the "considerable ferment" in the Arab
world an opportunity to coalesce on the Reagan peace in
itiative. A meeting between Jordan's King Hussein and
Yasser Arafat of the Palestine Liberation Organization is
said to be imminent, and Saudi Arabian Foreign Minister
Prince Saud has canceled a scheduled trip to the United
Nations, possibly to be on call for the Hussein-Arafat
talks.
The scenario, as charted by administration officials
and longtime observers of U.S. Mideast policy, is not
particularly complicated on paper.
Syria and Israel have legitimate security concerns in
the region — Israel about its northern border and Syria
about the fact that Israeli troops are poised along two
Syrian bonders.
LA loses pennant race
San Francisco — The San Francisco Giants, knocked
out of the National League West race a day earlier, took
the Los Angeles Dodgers down with them yesterday.
"All that people would have been talking about, if we
hadn't won this game, was how we folded and lost the last
three games to the Dodgers," said Joe Morgan, whose
two-out, seventh-inning homer gave the Giants a 5-3 vic
tory yesterday.
The Dodgers, who had an opportunity to tie for first
place with the Atlanta Braves, a 5-1 loser at San Diego,
finished one game behind, failing in their bid to force a
divisional playoff.
"It's difficult. We had our chance to win," said Tom
Lasorda, manager of baseball's defending champions.
Tylenol laced in Chicago home?
Chicago — A killer who poisoned seven people by put
ting cyanide in Extra-Strength Tylenol bottles is believed
to have filled the capsules with poison at home and then
placed the bottles prominently in stores, authorities said
yesterday.
The form of cyanide that killed the seven random vic
tims is available in school chemistry labs and metal
plants, the Illinois attorney general said as chemists and
detectives searched for clues to the seven killings.
Authorities were checking on several leads in the in
vestigation, including a shoplifter arrested in late August
for stealing Tylenol and reports of suspicious customers
at stores where the poison was found on shelves. At
torney General Tyrone Fahner said yesterday. Police ar
tists were sent out to interview employees.
Also, two police officers who picked up what are be
lieved to have been Tylenol capsules in a parking lot be
came ill the next day, and authorities ran tests to see if the
capsules contained cyanide.

Fahner said authorities believe the poison was placed
on shelves "probably the day before" the first three
deaths were reported Wednesday.
"It is an act of a random murderer who filled the
capsules with cyanide and then placed them in the
stores," said Fahner, who is heading a Task Force of
some 75 investigators from 15 state, federal and local
agencies including the FBI. Forty-three state chemists
were working around-the-clock in the investigation.
Fahner said evidence indicates a single person "went
around the Chicago area salting the store shelves with
one bottle of contaminated Tyelonol (at a time)." The
stores were as much as 40 miles apart in Chicago and its
northern and western suburbs.
"Tylenol is as much a victim as those who died," he
said. "Somebody just picked on this product."
There have been no ransom demands. Fahner said in
vestigators believe the killer bought or stole Tylenol from
a store, took it home, filled the capsules with cyanide and
placed the bottles in the front of store displays so they
would be bought quickly.
Israelis refuse to leave Beirut
Washington — Israeli Foreign Minister Yitzhak
Shamir said yesterday that Israeli troops would remain in
position around the Lebanese presidential palace in
Baabda, southeast of Beirut, and on the outskirts of the
airport south of the city until the general withdrawal of
all foreign forces from Lebanon.
Shamir rejected suggestions that keeping Israeli troops
in those places violated the terms under which the United
States agreed to join Italy and France in a multinational
peacekeeping force in Lebanon.
"I know only that thee were negotiations about leaving
all of Beirut and we agreed to do it, including the air
port," he said. "If the (Israeli) forces are in Baabda oh
other places, they must be included in this scheme of the
general withdrawal of all foreign forces.
"It must be the logical conclusion, because I cannot see
any other reasons for a different kind of handling of this
situation," he added in an interview oh CBS-TV's "Face
the Nation."
Shamir, who is in the United States for a two-week visit
that includes a meeting with Secretary of State George
Shultz, said there are "bright chances" that the with
drawal of foreign forces in Lebanon could be ac
complished by the end of the year.
Iranians hijack plane
Dubai, United Arab Emirates — Two Iranians seeking
political asylum in the United States hijacked an Iranian
military plane with 79 passengers aboard last night but
later freed them in Dubai and forced the pilot to fly to an
unknown destination, police reported.

They said the Hercules C-130 was commandeered last
night, when its pilot requested emergency landing per
smission in Dubai because of what he said was fuel short
age. Police said they learned two hijackers, who were not
further identified, were aboard holding 79 passengers,
mostly women and children.
It was not immediately clear where the plane came
from in Iran or why women and children were aboard a
military aircraft.
The hijackers told authorities they were defecting from
Iran and asked for political asylum in the United States,
police said. But the government refused to act as an in
termediary between the U.S. government and the hi
jackers.
The United Arab Emirates news agency said at one
point the hijackers "threatened violence against the
plane's 79 passengers, most of them women and children.
Authorities managed to talk the hijackers into releasing .
all passengers about 4 p.m. PDT.
It said "the plane refuelled and took off to an unknown
destination." .
Amerasian children arrive in LA
Los Angeles — Eleven "strung out" but smiling
Amerasian children arrived in Los Angeles yesterday
enroute to meeting the Americans who fathered them
during the Vietnam War.
The youngsters were headed for new homes in or near
Seattle, Atlanta, Portland, Oregon, San Diego, Sacra
mento, Tucson, Arizona and Dallas.
Six children and several of their escorts — volunteers
from the six relief agencies that coordinated the emigra
tion — held an impromptu news conference at Los An
geles International Airport, where the group touched
down about 2:30 p.m. None of the children spoke Eng
lish.
"Once they got on the plane, they took all the soap
from the lavatory and they got headsets from first class,
slip-on shoes and coloring books," said Gary Nebeker, a
member of the Pearl Buck Foundation of Thailand.
"They were raiding the lavatory and raiding the kitchen."
Gary Larsen of another participating relief agency,
Operation California, accompanied the children from
Ho Chi Minh City, known as Saigon before the South
Vietnamese government collapsed in 1975.
"They're all very strung out," Larsen said of the seven
boys and four girls. "Many were subject to airsickness
and headaches, but they loved it. They have no idea of
what it means to be in America."
Today's weather
The Bay Area forecast for today calls for fair weather.
Highs in the 60s to mid-70s. Westerly winds 15 to 20 miles
per hour in the afternoon.

Amerasian children arrive in LA
Los Angeles — Eleven "strung out" but smiling
Amerasian children arrived in Los Angeles yesterday
enroute to meeting the Americans who fathered them
during the Vietnam War.
The youngsters were headed for new homes in or near
Seattle, Atlanta, Portland, Oregon, San Diego, Sacra
mento, Tucson, Arizona and Dallas.
Six children and several of their escorts — volunteers
from the six relief agencies that coordinated the emigra
tion — held an impromptu news conference at Los An
geles International Airport, where the group touched
down about 2:30 p.m. None of the children spoke Eng
lish.
"Once they got on the plane, they took all the soap
from the lavatory and they got headsets from first class,
slip-on shoes and coloring books," said Gary Nebeker, a
member of the Pearl Buck Foundation of Thailand.
"They were raiding the lavatory and raiding the kitchen."
Gary Larsen of another participating relief agency,
Operation California, accompanied the children from
Ho Chi Minh City, known as Saigon before the South
Vietnamese government collapsed in 1975.
"They're all very strung out," Larsen said of the seven
boys and four girls. "Many were subject to airsickness
and headaches, but they loved it. They have no idea of
what it means to be in America."

Six Israelis die in ambush

Beirut — Gunmen ambushed an Israeli troop bus southeast of Beirut yes
terday in Israeli-controlled territory near Syrian lines, killing six soldiers and
injuring 16, Israeli army officials said.
There was no indication last night who the gunmen were, but Palestinian
guerrillas previously have carried out several ambushes and laid mines on
roads in areas occupied by Israel in southern and eastern Lebanon.
The number of Israeli casualties in the attack was believed to be the
highest in any incident since the end of the fighting in Beirut and the evac
uation of Palestinian guerrillas from the city in late August. There was im
mediate concern here last night that Israel would retaliate with a raid on Syr
ian positions in Lebanon's eastern Bekaa Valley, as it has on similar occa
sions in the past. Israel repeatedly has said that it holds the Syrians respon
sible for any Palestinian guerrillas who infiltrate Israeli lines and stage at
tacks.
In Beirut, Lebanese newspapers reported that President Amin Gemayel
wants to form an interim Cabinet, headed by Lebanon's security chief and
including other military men, that would have wide powers to impose law
and order.
Several dailies quoted official sources as saying Gemayel would announce
his choice for prime minister by today.
The French-language L'Orient-Le Jour quoted sources
close to President Gemayel as saying it appeared almost
certain that his choice for prime minister would be the se
curity chief, Brig. Gen. Ahmed El-Hajj. It said El-Hajj
docs not belong to any "political clans."
An-Nahar did not mention El-Hajj by name, but said
Gemayel most likely will choose someone from outside
"the club of former prime ministers." Under Lebanon's
power-sharing agreement, Gemayel, a Christian, must
appoint a Sunni Moslem as prime minister.
U.S. special envoy Philip Habib met with Syrian Presi
dent Hafez Assad in Damascus yesterday to discuss the
American-proposed plan for a simultaneous withdrawal
of Syrian and Israeli troops from Lebanon. Afterward
Habib left for Rome on his way back to Washington.
Israeli helicopters arrived almost immediately to evac
uate the wounded, while other soldiers aided by Christian
militamen set up roadblocks and began to hunt for the
assailants.
Following the incident, Israel was expected to insist
even more firmly on the withdrawal first of the remaining
Palestinian guerrillas fromn Lebanon as part of any over
all agreement on the removal of foreign troops.
Marines may stay in Lebanon
Washington — The 1200 U.S. Marines in Lebanon
could remain there for a minimum of four to six months,
according to government officials who say Americans
should be braced for further casualties like the death of
one Marine and wounding of three others last week when
an artillery shell exploded during mine-clearing opera
tions.
President Reagan has said the Marines must stay as
part of a multinational force until re-establishment of a
Lebanese government with real authority and removal of
Israeli and Syrian troops from the country. By all
assessments, these are the prerequisites for pushing the
president's stalled Middle East peace initiative beyond
the talking stage.
Reagan and other U.S. officials have stressed repeated
ly that the Marines' mission is meant to be a short oiW.
They used phrases such as "of limited duration" and "a
few weeks."
Behind the scenes, however, officials speak about a
minimum stay of four to six months — for the Lebanese
government and army to re-establish authority in Beirut
and then for that authority to spread in stages into areas
vacated by withdrawing Israelis and Syrians. As more
than one policy-maker noted, little seems to go as sched
uled in Lebanon.
This would not preclude an agreement being reached
more quickly on the framework for withdrawal of foreign
forces. U .S. special envoy Philip Habib spoke in terms of
a few weeks during a visit to Cairo late last week, accord
ing to Egyptian officials, and Israeli Foreign Minister

Yitzhak Shamir said Sunday that Habib has told Israel
that Syria is "ready in principle" to withdraw.
Such progress on withdrawal, U.S. officials say, may
be enough to give the "considerable ferment" in the Arab
world an opportunity to coalesce on the Reagan peace in
itiative. A meeting between Jordan's King Hussein and
Yasser Arafat of the Palestine Liberation Organization is
said to be imminent, and Saudi Arabian Foreign Minister
Prince Saud has canceled a scheduled trip to the United
Nations, possibly to be on call for the Hussein-Arafat
talks.
The scenario, as charted by administration officials
and longtime observers of U.S. Mideast policy, is not
particularly complicated on paper.
Syria and Israel have legitimate security concerns in
the region — Israel about its northern border and Syria
about the fact that Israeli troops are poised along two
Syrian bonders.
LA loses pennant race
San Francisco — The San Francisco Giants, knocked
out of the National League West race a day earlier, took
the Los Angeles Dodgers down with them yesterday.
"All that people would have been talking about, if we
hadn't won this game, was how we folded and lost the last
three games to the Dodgers," said Joe Morgan, whose
two-out, seventh-inning homer gave the Giants a 5-3 vic
tory yesterday.
The Dodgers, who had an opportunity to tie for first
place with the Atlanta Braves, a 5-1 loser at San Diego,
finished one game behind, failing in their bid to force a
divisional playoff.
"It's difficult. We had our chance to win," said Tom
Lasorda, manager of baseball's defending champions.
Tylenol laced in Chicago home?
Chicago — A killer who poisoned seven people by put
ting cyanide in Extra-Strength Tylenol bottles is believed
to have filled the capsules with poison at home and then
placed the bottles prominently in stores, authorities said
yesterday.
The form of cyanide that killed the seven random vic
tims is available in school chemistry labs and metal
plants, the Illinois attorney general said as chemists and
detectives searched for clues to the seven killings.
Authorities were checking on several leads in the in
vestigation, including a shoplifter arrested in late August
for stealing Tylenol and reports of suspicious customers
at stores where the poison was found on shelves. At
torney General Tyrone Fahner said yesterday. Police ar
tists were sent out to interview employees.
Also, two police officers who picked up what are be
lieved to have been Tylenol capsules in a parking lot be
came ill the next day, and authorities ran tests to see if the
capsules contained cyanide.

Fahner said authorities believe the poison was placed
on shelves "probably the day before" the first three
deaths were reported Wednesday.
"It is an act of a random murderer who filled the
capsules with cyanide and then placed them in the
stores," said Fahner, who is heading a Task Force of
some 75 investigators from 15 state, federal and local
agencies including the FBI. Forty-three state chemists
were working around-the-clock in the investigation.
Fahner said evidence indicates a single person "went
around the Chicago area salting the store shelves with
one bottle of contaminated Tyelonol (at a time)." The
stores were as much as 40 miles apart in Chicago and its
northern and western suburbs.
"Tylenol is as much a victim as those who died," he
said. "Somebody just picked on this product."
There have been no ransom demands. Fahner said in
vestigators believe the killer bought or stole Tylenol from
a store, took it home, filled the capsules with cyanide and
placed the bottles in the front of store displays so they
would be bought quickly.
Israelis refuse to leave Beirut
Washington — Israeli Foreign Minister Yitzhak
Shamir said yesterday that Israeli troops would remain in
position around the Lebanese presidential palace in
Baabda, southeast of Beirut, and on the outskirts of the
airport south of the city until the general withdrawal of
all foreign forces from Lebanon.
Shamir rejected suggestions that keeping Israeli troops
in those places violated the terms under which the United
States agreed to join Italy and France in a multinational
peacekeeping force in Lebanon.
"I know only that thee were negotiations about leaving
all of Beirut and we agreed to do it, including the air
port," he said. "If the (Israeli) forces are in Baabda oh
other places, they must be included in this scheme of the
general withdrawal of all foreign forces.
"It must be the logical conclusion, because I cannot see
any other reasons for a different kind of handling of this
situation," he added in an interview oh CBS-TV's "Face
the Nation."
Shamir, who is in the United States for a two-week visit
that includes a meeting with Secretary of State George
Shultz, said there are "bright chances" that the with
drawal of foreign forces in Lebanon could be ac
complished by the end of the year.
Iranians hijack plane
Dubai, United Arab Emirates — Two Iranians seeking
political asylum in the United States hijacked an Iranian
military plane with 79 passengers aboard last night but
later freed them in Dubai and forced the pilot to fly to an
unknown destination, police reported.

They said the Hercules C-130 was commandeered last
night, when its pilot requested emergency landing per
smission in Dubai because of what he said was fuel short
age. Police said they learned two hijackers, who were not
further identified, were aboard holding 79 passengers,
mostly women and children.
It was not immediately clear where the plane came
from in Iran or why women and children were aboard a
military aircraft.
The hijackers told authorities they were defecting from
Iran and asked for political asylum in the United States,
police said. But the government refused to act as an in
termediary between the U.S. government and the hi
jackers.
The United Arab Emirates news agency said at one
point the hijackers "threatened violence against the
plane's 79 passengers, most of them women and children.
Authorities managed to talk the hijackers into releasing .
all passengers about 4 p.m. PDT.
It said "the plane refuelled and took off to an unknown

Iranians hijack plane
Dubai, United Arab Emirates — Two Iranians seeking
political asylum in the United States hijacked an Iranian
military plane with 79 passengers aboard last night but
later freed them in Dubai and forced the pilot to fly to an
unknown destination, police reported.

They said the Hercules C-130 was commandeered last
night, when its pilot requested emergency landing per
smission in Dubai because of what he said was fuel short
age. Police said they learned two hijackers, who were not
further identified, were aboard holding 79 passengers,
mostly women and children.
It was not immediately clear where the plane came
from in Iran or why women and children were aboard a
military aircraft.
The hijackers told authorities they were defecting from
Iran and asked for political asylum in the United States,
police said. But the government refused to act as an in
termediary between the U.S. government and the hi
jackers.
The United Arab Emirates news agency said at one
point the hijackers "threatened violence against the
plane's 79 passengers, most of them women and children.
Authorities managed to talk the hijackers into releasing .
all passengers about 4 p.m. PDT.
It said "the plane refuelled and took off to an unknown
destination." .
Amerasian children arrive in LA
Los Angeles — Eleven "strung out" but smiling
Amerasian children arrived in Los Angeles yesterday
enroute to meeting the Americans who fathered them
during the Vietnam War.
The youngsters were headed for new homes in or near
Seattle, Atlanta, Portland, Oregon, San Diego, Sacra
mento, Tucson, Arizona and Dallas.
Six children and several of their escorts — volunteers
from the six relief agencies that coordinated the emigra
tion — held an impromptu news conference at Los An
geles International Airport, where the group touched
down about 2:30 p.m. None of the children spoke Eng
lish.
"Once they got on the plane, they took all the soap
from the lavatory and they got headsets from first class,
slip-on shoes and coloring books," said Gary Nebeker, a
member of the Pearl Buck Foundation of Thailand.
"They were raiding the lavatory and raiding the kitchen."
Gary Larsen of another participating relief agency,
Operation California, accompanied the children from
Ho Chi Minh City, known as Saigon before the South
Vietnamese government collapsed in 1975.
"They're all very strung out," Larsen said of the seven
boys and four girls. "Many were subject to airsickness
and headaches, but they loved it. They have no idea of
what it means to be in America."

Six Israelis die in ambush

Beirut — Gunmen ambushed an Israeli troop bus southeast of Beirut yes
terday in Israeli-controlled territory near Syrian lines, killing six soldiers and
injuring 16, Israeli army officials said.
There was no indication last night who the gunmen were, but Palestinian
guerrillas previously have carried out several ambushes and laid mines on
roads in areas occupied by Israel in southern and eastern Lebanon.
The number of Israeli casualties in the attack was believed to be the
highest in any incident since the end of the fighting in Beirut and the evac
uation of Palestinian guerrillas from the city in late August. There was im
mediate concern here last night that Israel would retaliate with a raid on Syr
ian positions in Lebanon's eastern Bekaa Valley, as it has on similar occa
sions in the past. Israel repeatedly has said that it holds the Syrians respon
sible for any Palestinian guerrillas who infiltrate Israeli lines and stage at
tacks.
In Beirut, Lebanese newspapers reported that President Amin Gemayel
wants to form an interim Cabinet, headed by Lebanon's security chief and
including other military men, that would have wide powers to impose law
and order.
Several dailies quoted official sources as saying Gemayel would announce
his choice for prime minister by today.
The French-language L'Orient-Le Jour quoted sources
close to President Gemayel as saying it appeared almost
certain that his choice for prime minister would be the se
curity chief, Brig. Gen. Ahmed El-Hajj. It said El-Hajj
docs not belong to any "political clans."
An-Nahar did not mention El-Hajj by name, but said
Gemayel most likely will choose someone from outside
"the club of former prime ministers." Under Lebanon's
power-sharing agreement, Gemayel, a Christian, must
appoint a Sunni Moslem as prime minister.
U.S. special envoy Philip Habib met with Syrian Presi
dent Hafez Assad in Damascus yesterday to discuss the
American-proposed plan for a simultaneous withdrawal
of Syrian and Israeli troops from Lebanon. Afterward
Habib left for Rome on his way back to Washington.
Israeli helicopters arrived almost immediately to evac
uate the wounded, while other soldiers aided by Christian
militamen set up roadblocks and began to hunt for the
assailants.
Following the incident, Israel was expected to insist
even more firmly on the withdrawal first of the remaining
Palestinian guerrillas fromn Lebanon as part of any over
all agreement on the removal of foreign troops.
Marines may stay in Lebanon
Washington — The 1200 U.S. Marines in Lebanon
could remain there for a minimum of four to six months,
according to government officials who say Americans
should be braced for further casualties like the death of
one Marine and wounding of three others last week when
an artillery shell exploded during mine-clearing opera
tions.
President Reagan has said the Marines must stay as
part of a multinational force until re-establishment of a
Lebanese government with real authority and removal of
Israeli and Syrian troops from the country. By all
assessments, these are the prerequisites for pushing the
president's stalled Middle East peace initiative beyond
the talking stage.
Reagan and other U.S. officials have stressed repeated
ly that the Marines' mission is meant to be a short oiW.
They used phrases such as "of limited duration" and "a
few weeks."
Behind the scenes, however, officials speak about a
minimum stay of four to six months — for the Lebanese
government and army to re-establish authority in Beirut
and then for that authority to spread in stages into areas
vacated by withdrawing Israelis and Syrians. As more
than one policy-maker noted, little seems to go as sched
uled in Lebanon.
This would not preclude an agreement being reached
more quickly on the framework for withdrawal of foreign
forces. U .S. special envoy Philip Habib spoke in terms of
a few weeks during a visit to Cairo late last week, accord
ing to Egyptian officials, and Israeli Foreign Minister

Yitzhak Shamir said Sunday that Habib has told Israel
that Syria is "ready in principle" to withdraw.
Such progress on withdrawal, U.S. officials say, may
be enough to give the "considerable ferment" in the Arab
world an opportunity to coalesce on the Reagan peace in
itiative. A meeting between Jordan's King Hussein and
Yasser Arafat of the Palestine Liberation Organization is
said to be imminent, and Saudi Arabian Foreign Minister
Prince Saud has canceled a scheduled trip to the United
Nations, possibly to be on call for the Hussein-Arafat
talks.
The scenario, as charted by administration officials
and longtime observers of U.S. Mideast policy, is not
particularly complicated on paper.
Syria and Israel have legitimate security concerns in
the region — Israel about its northern border and Syria
about the fact that Israeli troops are poised along two
Syrian bonders.
LA loses pennant race
San Francisco — The San Francisco Giants, knocked
out of the National League West race a day earlier, took
the Los Angeles Dodgers down with them yesterday.
"All that people would have been talking about, if we
hadn't won this game, was how we folded and lost the last
three games to the Dodgers," said Joe Morgan, whose
two-out, seventh-inning homer gave the Giants a 5-3 vic
tory yesterday.
The Dodgers, who had an opportunity to tie for first
place with the Atlanta Braves, a 5-1 loser at San Diego,
finished one game behind, failing in their bid to force a
divisional playoff.
"It's difficult. We had our chance to win," said Tom
Lasorda, manager of baseball's defending champions.
Tylenol laced in Chicago home?
Chicago — A killer who poisoned seven people by put
ting cyanide in Extra-Strength Tylenol bottles is believed
to have filled the capsules with poison at home and then
placed the bottles prominently in stores, authorities said
yesterday.
The form of cyanide that killed the seven random vic
tims is available in school chemistry labs and metal
plants, the Illinois attorney general said as chemists and
detectives searched for clues to the seven killings.
Authorities were checking on several leads in the in
vestigation, including a shoplifter arrested in late August
for stealing Tylenol and reports of suspicious customers
at stores where the poison was found on shelves. At
torney General Tyrone Fahner said yesterday. Police ar
tists were sent out to interview employees.
Also, two police officers who picked up what are be
lieved to have been Tylenol capsules in a parking lot be
came ill the next day, and authorities ran tests to see if the
capsules contained cyanide.

Fahner said authorities believe the poison was placed
on shelves "probably the day before" the first three
deaths were reported Wednesday.
"It is an act of a random murderer who filled the
capsules with cyanide and then placed them in the
stores," said Fahner, who is heading a Task Force of
some 75 investigators from 15 state, federal and local
agencies including the FBI. Forty-three state chemists
were working around-the-clock in the investigation.
Fahner said evidence indicates a single person "went
around the Chicago area salting the store shelves with
one bottle of contaminated Tyelonol (at a time)." The
stores were as much as 40 miles apart in Chicago and its
northern and western suburbs.
"Tylenol is as much a victim as those who died," he
said. "Somebody just picked on this product."
There have been no ransom demands. Fahner said in
vestigators believe the killer bought or stole Tylenol from
a store, took it home, filled the capsules with cyanide and
placed the bottles in the front of store displays so they
would be bought quickly.
Israelis refuse to leave Beirut
Washington — Israeli Foreign Minister Yitzhak
Shamir said yesterday that Israeli troops would remain in
position around the Lebanese presidential palace in
Baabda, southeast of Beirut, and on the outskirts of the
airport south of the city until the general withdrawal of
all foreign forces from Lebanon.
Shamir rejected suggestions that keeping Israeli troops
in those places violated the terms under which the United
States agreed to join Italy and France in a multinational
peacekeeping force in Lebanon.
"I know only that thee were negotiations about leaving
all of Beirut and we agreed to do it, including the air
port," he said. "If the (Israeli) forces are in Baabda oh
other places, they must be included in this scheme of the
general withdrawal of all foreign forces.
"It must be the logical conclusion, because I cannot see
any other reasons for a different kind of handling of this

on shelves "probably the day before" the first three
deaths were reported Wednesday.
"It is an act of a random murderer who filled the
capsules with cyanide and then placed them in the
stores," said Fahner, who is heading a Task Force of
some 75 investigators from 15 state, federal and local
agencies including the FBI. Forty-three state chemists
were working around-the-clock in the investigation.
Fahner said evidence indicates a single person "went
around the Chicago area salting the store shelves with
one bottle of contaminated Tyelonol (at a time)." The
stores were as much as 40 miles apart in Chicago and its
northern and western suburbs.
"Tylenol is as much a victim as those who died," he
said. "Somebody just picked on this product."
There have been no ransom demands. Fahner said in
vestigators believe the killer bought or stole Tylenol from
a store, took it home, filled the capsules with cyanide and
placed the bottles in the front of store displays so they
would be bought quickly.
Israelis refuse to leave Beirut
Washington — Israeli Foreign Minister Yitzhak
Shamir said yesterday that Israeli troops would remain in
position around the Lebanese presidential palace in
Baabda, southeast of Beirut, and on the outskirts of the
airport south of the city until the general withdrawal of
all foreign forces from Lebanon.
Shamir rejected suggestions that keeping Israeli troops
in those places violated the terms under which the United
States agreed to join Italy and France in a multinational
peacekeeping force in Lebanon.
"I know only that thee were negotiations about leaving
all of Beirut and we agreed to do it, including the air
port," he said. "If the (Israeli) forces are in Baabda oh
other places, they must be included in this scheme of the
general withdrawal of all foreign forces.
"It must be the logical conclusion, because I cannot see
any other reasons for a different kind of handling of this
situation," he added in an interview oh CBS-TV's "Face
the Nation."
Shamir, who is in the United States for a two-week visit
that includes a meeting with Secretary of State George
Shultz, said there are "bright chances" that the with
drawal of foreign forces in Lebanon could be ac
complished by the end of the year.

political asylum in the United States hijacked an Iranian
military plane with 79 passengers aboard last night but
later freed them in Dubai and forced the pilot to fly to an
unknown destination, police reported.

They said the Hercules C-130 was commandeered last
night, when its pilot requested emergency landing per
smission in Dubai because of what he said was fuel short
age. Police said they learned two hijackers, who were not
further identified, were aboard holding 79 passengers,
mostly women and children.
It was not immediately clear where the plane came
from in Iran or why women and children were aboard a
military aircraft.
The hijackers told authorities they were defecting from
Iran and asked for political asylum in the United States,
police said. But the government refused to act as an in
termediary between the U.S. government and the hi
jackers.
The United Arab Emirates news agency said at one
point the hijackers "threatened violence against the
plane's 79 passengers, most of them women and children.
Authorities managed to talk the hijackers into releasing .
all passengers about 4 p.m. PDT.
It said "the plane refuelled and took off to an unknown
destination." .
Amerasian children arrive in LA
Los Angeles — Eleven "strung out" but smiling
Amerasian children arrived in Los Angeles yesterday
enroute to meeting the Americans who fathered them
during the Vietnam War.
The youngsters were headed for new homes in or near
Seattle, Atlanta, Portland, Oregon, San Diego, Sacra
mento, Tucson, Arizona and Dallas.
Six children and several of their escorts — volunteers
from the six relief agencies that coordinated the emigra
tion — held an impromptu news conference at Los An
geles International Airport, where the group touched
down about 2:30 p.m. None of the children spoke Eng
lish.
"Once they got on the plane, they took all the soap
from the lavatory and they got headsets from first class,
slip-on shoes and coloring books," said Gary Nebeker, a
member of the Pearl Buck Foundation of Thailand.
"They were raiding the lavatory and raiding the kitchen."
Gary Larsen of another participating relief agency,
Operation California, accompanied the children from
Ho Chi Minh City, known as Saigon before the South
Vietnamese government collapsed in 1975.
"They're all very strung out," Larsen said of the seven
boys and four girls. "Many were subject to airsickness
and headaches, but they loved it. They have no idea of
what it means to be in America."
