Six Israelis die in ambush

Beirut — Gunmen ambushed an Israeli troop bus southeast of Beirut yes
terday in Israeli-controlled territory near Syrian lines, killing six soldiers and
injuring 16, Israeli army officials said.
There was no indication last night who the gunmen were, but Palestinian
guerrillas previously have carried out several ambushes and laid mines on
roads in areas occupied by Israel in southern and eastern Lebanon.
The number of Israeli casualties in the attack was believed to be the
highest in any incident since the end of the fighting in Beirut and the evac
uation of Palestinian guerrillas from the city in late August. There was im
mediate concern here last night that Israel would retaliate with a raid on Syr
ian positions in Lebanon's eastern Bekaa Valley, as it has on similar occa
sions in the past. Israel repeatedly has said that it holds the Syrians respon
sible for any Palestinian guerrillas who infiltrate Israeli lines and stage at
tacks.
In Beirut, Lebanese newspapers reported that President Amin Gemayel
wants to form an interim Cabinet, headed by Lebanon's security chief and
including other military men, that would have wide powers to impose law
and order.
Several dailies quoted official sources as saying Gemayel would announce
his choice for prime minister by today.
