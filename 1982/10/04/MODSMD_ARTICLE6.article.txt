# Newly opened center to research economic issues
## 
### LISA LYNCH 
The headquarters of the University's new Center
for Economic Policy Research may not seem particu
larly impressive. A sheet of paper taped to a door in
Encina Commons proclaims "CEPR" in a crooked
scrawl.
Inside, a glance at the directory reveals that the of
fice has been the yictim of a prankster. The letters on
the pegboard list the offices of the "Center for Comic
Research" as those for "Awful" and "Dismal" con
cerns. The offices themselves are mostly empty.
But beneath the surface scatter, CEPR boasts a
well-structured and energetic program for research.
The brainchild of Economics Professors Michael Bos
kin and Paul David, the center was founded to pro
mote research on economic concerns of far-reaching
importance. After two years of planning and develop
ment, CEPR formally opened Sept. 1.
The center, which is fully supported by private
donations, provides funds to members of the Stanford
faculty who submit proposals detailing studies on
"newly developed and recurring issues" in relevant
areas. The uncommitted budget for 1982-83 is approx
imately $200,000,

CEPR part-time staffers and consultants include
Director Jim Rosse, Assistant Director Carol Sher
wood and the steering committee composed of Eco
nomics Profs. Kenneth Arrow, Boskin, David and
John Pencavel; Business Prof. Jim March, Law Prof.
Mitchell Polinsky, Engineering Prof. Jim Sweeney as
well as Rosse. Administrator Jean Barnes is the only
full-time employee.
Also, an advisory board meets annually and is con
tinually available for advice on policy. The members
include Thomas Schelling, economist at Harvard Uni
versity: Arjay Miller, former dean of the Stanford
Business School; William Hewlett of Hewlett-Pack
ard; Joseph Califano, Health Education and Welfare
Secretary under President Jimmy Carter; William
Hoadly of the Hoover Institution and other noted in
dividuals such as Frank Lodato, P. Anthony Ridder,
Franklin Johnson and Chairman Edmund Littlefield.
Past members of the advisory board include Kenneth
Dam and George Shultz, who left the board when he
was appointed U.S. Secretary of State.
Johnson and Lodato also serve on the CEPR As
sociates, a fundraising committee. Mid-peninsula
businessmen Reid Dennis, Herb Dwight and Tom

Ford also serve as associates.
Through the efforts of the staff, CEPR awards re
search grants to University faculty members. Those
interested in monies submit proposals including a de
scription of their project, a budget, a discussion of
other funds they will acquire and their own academic
credentials. Proposals are considered by the steering
committee.
Rosse explained that the center was primarily in
terested in providing seed monies for projects rather
than allocating long-term funding. He also stated that
because of the apolitical nature of CEPR, con
tributors were advised that the center could not en
courage research promoting a particular political fac
tion. Rosse maintained that although the CEPR staff
interacts closely with the University's Public Policy
Department, the center has no particular political
commitment.
"It would be very hard to categorize the politics of
the Economics Department," he explained.
Pencavel also stressed that the University's Eco
nomics Department was unusually diverse politically.
This political diversity and the support of the center
