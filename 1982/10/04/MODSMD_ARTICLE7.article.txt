## End of session yields election issue, compromise Balanced-budget plan defeated 
### 
Compiled from news reports and wire services
Angered by the failure of his proposed constitu
tional amendment requiring a balanced federal
budget to pass through Congress last Friday, Presi
dent Reagan pledged to continue the battle and
urged voters to defeat those who voted against the
measure in the coming elections.
"In November, we must elect representatives
who will support the amendment when we propose
it again in the spring," Reagan said during a White
House press conference held Friday afternoon.
The proposed amendment, defeated 236-187, fell
46 votes short of the two-thirds majority needed to
send the amendment to the states for ratification
during the last session of Congress before the Nov.
2 elections.
The Republican-backed plan called for a bal
anced budget except in wartime or when three-fifths
of both houses of Congress decided a deficit was
necessary. Presumably, that three-fifths rule would
make it extremely difficult to win approval for a def
icit except in unusual circumstances. Though a simi
lar proposal passed through the Republican-con
trolled Senate earlier this year, the measure met
with bitter resistance from the Democratic leader
ship which controls the House.
House Speaker, Thomas "Tip" O'Neill, one of
Reagan's most ardent critics, said the amendment
was being used to detract public attention from the
economic picture and that it would not solve budget
problems or end unemployment. "I do not dispute
that huge budget deficits and record unemployment
have this nation in the worst economic crisis since
the the Great Depression," O'Neill said in prepared
remarks not delivered when debate cut short, "but I
do dispute that this amendment will end the crisis.
On the contrary, it is bound to add to it by making
us choose betwen gutting national defense and gut
ting Social Security, between gutting Medicare and
gutting aid to education." he added.
White House officials deeply concerned that Re
publicans will suffer sizable losses in races for Con
gress and governorships if voters focus too much on
rising unemployment and the stalled economy have
welcomed the budget amendment issue for Reagan
because it underscores his promise to slash the size
of government regardless of deficits. Even as Rea
gan lamented the amendment's defeat, White
House officials rejoiced. "It's going to be a damn
good campaign issue," said one senior adminis
tration official.
Though many Democrats rejoiced at news of the
defeat, Rep. Norman Mineta (D-Calif.), a member
of the House budget committee, realized the politi

cal edge Reagan has gained. "Reagan still wins.
This whole excercise is to take the focus away from
unemployment and the economy. He can keep the
focus off his own shortcomings and blame it all on
the Democrats."
And Reagan has intensified this theme, refusing
to take any blame for the economy's performance.
"It was," Reagan said, "year after year of govern
ment living beyond its means that plunged our na
tion into a deep, painful mess."
White House officials expressed satisfaction with
the results of last-minute maneuvering that began
earlier in the week when Vice President George
Bush convinced IS House members, including four
Democrats, to join in a petition that freed the amen
ment from a hostile judiciary committee. This
startled the House leadership, which in turn sur
prised the Reagan administration by rapidly clear
ing the way for a vote.
Reagan brushed aside Democrat contentions
that the amendment would force a drastic reorder
ing of the federal budget. Had it passed, he said,
there would be "plenty of time to bring it under con
trol without devastating a number of worthwhile
programs that people are dependent on."
Asked if he would try and balance the budget by
1986 on his own, he added, "I would be willing to go
at it." However, Reagan pledged last week not to
raise taxes again next year, a decision that some ad
ministration officials think will swell federal deficits
even further.
According to the non-partisan Congressional
Budget Office, the deficit for fiscal 1982, which
ended Thursday, will be $1 IS million and the 1983
deficit will rise to $155 million.
