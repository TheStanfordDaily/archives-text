# Stopgap measure bails out govt.
##

Compiled from news reports and wire services
In an effort to keep most of the federal
government afloat for the 1983 fiscal year
which began Friday, Congress passed a
massive stopgap measure late that evening
allowing it to delay until its lame-duck ses
sion, Nov. 29, the spending decisions in 12
pending appropriations bills.
Anxious to adjourn for a month of cam
paigning, Congress approved the com
promise spending bill in order to pull the
government out of a day of technical
bankruptcy. The temporary spending bill
will keep money flowing to government
operations and programs until Dec. 17.
After a 290-123 vote in the House and a
voice vote in the Senate, the measure went
to President Reagan for his signature. The
action is necessary because only one of 13
regular annual appropriations bills for the
government has been signed into law.
Outraged by the consolidation of so
many measures, Rep. Bill Frenzel (R-
Minn.) condemned the measure as a "sub
stitute for honest work."
While no precise figures are available,
the compromise measure generally holds
spending for domestic programs within
the limits imposed by the budget blueprint
Congress approved earlier this year.
The measure calls for defense spending
on an annual basis 0f5228.7 billion, which
is more than $6 billion below the amount
approved in the budget and about $17
billion less than Reagan requested from
Congress last winter.
Temporarily, the continuing resolution
prohibits purchase of the first five MX,
missiles that the admininstration wants to
buy, and bars any constfuction activity on
the second of two new nuclear aircraft car
riers that the president is hoping to build.
Construction of the B1 bomber may pro

ceed. The defense allocation is expected to
change when the actual appropriations
bill is passed.
The $9.7 billion in the measure for for
eign aid is far below the $11.6 billion Rea
gan requested, and well below the $11.1
billion the Senate voted earlier.
The temporary measure did not include
$296.5 million in community service em
ployment for older Americans or $50 mil
lion for vocational education grants, both
priorities set by Democratic members.
While $800 million was allotted ior Medi
care contractors, the overall effect of legis
lation is to reduce the growth of the pro
gram by limiting the amount reimbursed
to participating hospitals and physicians.
As a result of the hurried compromise
some cuts will not be felt immediately.
Reagan's proposals would have been

more severe in reducing or ending benefits
for more than 700,000 families, but for the
time being the resolution curtailed the re
ductions.
In vet another temporary move, Con
gress approved only $342 million worth of
cuts to the main welfare program, Aid to
Families with Dependent Children. Rea
gan had requested budget cuts totaling
$3.3 billion over three years.
A spokesman for the Office of Man
agement and Budget, however, stressed
that the preliminary estimates outlined by
the compromise resolution would have to
be corrected in the course of the fiscal
year. The $2 billion more provided for
domestic programs and the $2 billion less
allocated for defense spending are ex
pected to undergo reevaluation.
