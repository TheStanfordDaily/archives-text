# Public jobs program replaced
## New bill encourages private training

Compiled from news reports and wire services
A bill intended to spur the construction of a federal job training pro
gram and encourage private industry to establish training programs is
expected to be signed by President Reagan today. The bill, over
whelmingly approved by Congress last Friday, will replace the now
defunct CETA public jobs program.
The only major labor legislation to come before this congressional
session passed in the House by a vote of 339-12, after being approved
95-0 by the Senate earlier last week.
Last week, the president urged Congress to enact the legislation be
cause, he said, it would provide "real hope by serving as a hand up
rather than a handout to our disadvantaged citizens."
The once-popular CETA program, created in 1973, provided mil
lions of federally subsidized jobs to the hard-core disadvantaged, but
was assailed in recent year by political conservatives as plagued by
waste, fraud and abuse. The present measure would not pay for what
Reagan called "make-work," public-service jobs, which inspired
scandal and made CETA unpopular.
The new program requires that 70 percent of the nearly $4 billion it
provides be devoted to actual training of more than a million poor and
jobless annually. That was about the percentage absorbed by stipends
to participants and administrative costs of CETA.

Co-sponsored by Senators Dan Quayle (R-Ind.) and Edward Ken
nedy (D-Mass.), the bipartisan effort was the result of more than a
month of bitter wrangling over wide differences between the House
and Senate versions, and a threat of presidential veto because a part of
the funds may be allotted to financial aid for some trainees.
The overall compromise, however, was praised by both sides. Sena
tor Paula Hawkins (R-Fla.) said in a The Afew York Times interview,
"Both parties shared in this legislation, the most significant labor
measure to come before us. It is a vast improvement on CETA because
it increases the involvement of private industry in the training pro
grams, it emphasizes training rather than public works jobs, and un
like CETA, it does not train people for jobs that did not exist. ..
Essentially, the legislation would fold the remnants of CETA into
$3.8 billion of job training block grants to the states. The adminis
tration had proposed only $2.4 billion for job training.
The 10-year CETA program ended on the eve of fiscal year 1983,
having spent over $66 billion in providing millions of subsidized jobs
for the disadvantaged.
