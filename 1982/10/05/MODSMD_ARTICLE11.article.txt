# Profile of a USW striker
## 
### KATHERINE HUTT Senior staff writer 
Before the strike. Bob Elmore led a comfortable
life. His salary as head electrician for University
Plant Services provided him and his fiancee with all
the traditional trappings of the American dream —
a house of their own in a nice suburb, a new car and
weekly trips to the movies.
But after being out of work for over three weeks
like some 850 other members of the striking United
Stanford Workers (USW), "It's come to the point
now where we've had to cut corners in every pos
sible way," Elmore said.
Twenty-five days of no income has taught him
which expenses are really necessary: food and rent.
"I figure as long as I've got a roof over my head and
food to eat, I'll be all right."
While these essentials may keep him going physi
cally, Elmore is not mentally satisfied with his cur
rent situation. "It's just not my nature not to
work," he said.
Elmore described himself as "a very hard-work
ing, loyal employee" of Stanford and his job history
bears out this statement. He started at the Univer
sity two-and-a-half years ago as an electrician in
Plant Services. Four years later he was promoted to
head electrician — "the position I still hold, when
I'm working."

Elmore's opinion of Stanford
has not been changed by the
strike. Rat her, he places the
blame for the ordeal on the
stubbornness of two people —
University President Donald
Kennedy and head of the
University negotiating team
Priscilla Wheeler: 'I believe
they We just trying to bust the
Union.'

Stanford, Elmore said , is "a wonderful environ
ment to work in. We have our own little city here."
He continued, "Until now I've had a great deal of
respect for the University — the whole communi
ty."

pie — President Donald Kennedy and head of the

believe thev're just trying to bust the Union."
Elmore added that he "would like to make a per
sonal appeal to Donald Kennedy" to end the strike.
"Everyone of us here (on the picket lines) would like
to work."

Elmore characterized the
Union, which contains various
types of blue-collar workers,
as 'made up of people who
have many different goals and
needs.'

Elmore said that he was approached about join
ing USW within a week or two of starting work at
Stanford, and that he became a member immediate
ly. He is now on the executive board of the Union,
and chairman of strike headquarters and opera
tions.
Elmore characterized the Union, which contains
various types of blue-collar workers, as "made up
of people who have many different goals and
needs." This disparity of interests does not create a
problem when organizing a strike, he added, but
rather when trying to negotiate a settlement.
For example, he said, a highly paid technical
worker would be interested in improved medical
benefits, whereas a worker earning less money
would be far more concerned with a salary increase.
This is not Elmore's first experience on the picket
lines. While in college at the University of Houston
he participated in a retail clerks' strike, and when he
was a member of the International Brotherhood of
Electrical Workers in Texas he was out on the
picket lines for five weeks. Both of these strikes were
successful, he noted.
The current strike, according to Elmore, is
"much the same" as his first two, because the work
ers have similar demands. He also noted that the
group dynamics are identical for all strikes.
"There's a lot of camaraderie here. A lot of people
depend on each other."
He added, "I'm happy to see one thing. The
camaraderie is really increasing." Proof of this, he
says, can be found in the fact that last week 500
strikers were eligible to collect hardship money giv
en by the union to those members who work 20
hours a week or more.

"much the same" as his first two, because the work
ers have similar demands. He also noted that the
group dynamics are identical for all strikes.
"There's a lot of camaraderie here. A lot of people
depend on each other."
He added, "I'm happy to see one thing. The
camaraderie is really increasing." Proof of this, he
says, can be found in the fact that last week 500
strikers were eligible to collect hardship money giv
en by the union to those members who work 20
hours a week or more.
Before the strike. Bob Elmore led a comfortable
life. His salary as head electrician for University
Plant Services provided him and his fiancee with all
the traditional trappings of the American dream —
a house of their own in a nice suburb, a new car and
weekly trips to the movies.
But after being out of work for over three weeks
like some 850 other members of the striking United
Stanford Workers (USW), "It's come to the point
now where we've had to cut corners in every pos
sible way," Elmore said.
Twenty-five days of no income has taught him
which expenses are really necessary: food and rent.
"I figure as long as I've got a roof over my head and
food to eat, I'll be all right."
While these essentials may keep him going physi
cally, Elmore is not mentally satisfied with his cur
rent situation. "It's just not my nature not to
work," he said.
Elmore described himself as "a very hard-work
ing, loyal employee" of Stanford and his job history
bears out this statement. He started at the Univer
sity two-and-a-half years ago as an electrician in
Plant Services. Four years later he was promoted to
head electrician — "the position I still hold, when
I'm working."

Elmore's opinion of Stanford
has not been changed by the
strike. Rat her, he places the
blame for the ordeal on the
stubbornness of two people —
University President Donald
Kennedy and head of the
University negotiating team
Priscilla Wheeler: 'I believe
they We just trying to bust the
Union.'

Stanford, Elmore said , is "a wonderful environ
ment to work in. We have our own little city here."
He continued, "Until now I've had a great deal of
respect for the University — the whole communi
ty."
Elmore's opinion of Stanford as a whole has not
been changed by the strike. Rather, he places the
blame for the ordeal on the stubborness of two peo

pie — President Donald Kennedy and head of the
University negotiating team Priscilla Wheeler: "I
believe thev're just trying to bust the Union."
Elmore added that he "would like to make a per
sonal appeal to Donald Kennedy" to end the strike.
"Everyone of us here (on the picket lines) would like
to work."

Elmore characterized the
Union, which contains various
types of blue-collar workers,
as 'made up of people who
have many different goals and
needs.'

Elmore said that he was approached about join
ing USW within a week or two of starting work at
Stanford, and that he became a member immediate
ly. He is now on the executive board of the Union,
and chairman of strike headquarters and opera
tions.
Elmore characterized the Union, which contains
various types of blue-collar workers, as "made up
of people who have many different goals and
needs." This disparity of interests does not create a
problem when organizing a strike, he added, but
rather when trying to negotiate a settlement.
For example, he said, a highly paid technical
worker would be interested in improved medical
benefits, whereas a worker earning less money
would be far more concerned with a salary increase.
This is not Elmore's first experience on the picket
lines. While in college at the University of Houston
he participated in a retail clerks' strike, and when he
was a member of the International Brotherhood of
Electrical Workers in Texas he was out on the
picket lines for five weeks. Both of these strikes were
successful, he noted.
The current strike, according to Elmore, is
"much the same" as his first two, because the work
ers have similar demands. He also noted that the
group dynamics are identical for all strikes.
"There's a lot of camaraderie here. A lot of people
depend on each other."
He added, "I'm happy to see one thing. The
camaraderie is really increasing." Proof of this, he
says, can be found in the fact that last week 500
strikers were eligible to collect hardship money giv
en by the union to those members who work 20
hours a week or more.
