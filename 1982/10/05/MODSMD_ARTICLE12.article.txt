## The 						Stanford Daily Students suffer effects of strike 
### 
While the longest-running strike in the history of
the University continues, it is now clear that United
Stanford Workers and the University are not the
only ones suffering in the wake of the strike. Stu
dents too are now finding themselves caught in the
middle of the dispute.
The whole question of how students should be
dealing with the strike is a confusing one. At first,
maybe it was easy to make do. Going out for each
meal was fun for awhile, but with homework piling
up and schedules getting full, the strike is causing
real difficulties.
The strike's effects are numerous: construction
delays at the new dorms and Braun Auditorium,
construction blockades at unfinished repair sites
(especially on Alvarado Row and Mayfield Ave
nue), trash bins piling up, campus restrooms not
supplied, slow or no response to maintenance calls.
And nowhere have students felt the strike more
than in their stomachs.
The search for food has raised the ire of many stu
dents — some who in the past may have been strong
supporters of unions — who now find themselves
resenting the union for interrupting their daily rou
tines. Students arriving back from their leisurely
summer vacations suddenly have been thrust into
the center of a hostile, sometimes violent, strike.
Some students are discovering that they can take
a side on the issue and vocalize their opinions
through discussions or actions. Students are free to
aid the University by accepting a temporary job
during the strike or to aid the union by picketing,
distributing leaflets or wearing a green ribbon of

support.
Or students can try to ignore the entire episode,
as the union has accused the University of doing.
But is it really possible to remain neutrally uncon
cerned about something which is such a central is
sue on campus?
A recent union newsletter states that by eating at
Tresidder Union, picking up food supplies at the
University commissary, or just having packages
sent bv the United Parcel Service, students are
knowingly or unknowingly siding with the Univer
sity. What about crossing picket lines to attend
classes? Does that too constitute support for the
University?
Each day frustrated students here face the conse
quences of the strike. Since students are every bit as
much involved in the strike and its effects as the
University and USW, they should be responsible
enough to become informed about the issues at
hand. How many students have actually stopped
and talked to the USW members on the picket lines
or discussed the strike with University adminis
trators?
Most students do hope for a settlement as soon as
possible so that things can return to normal once
again. Many fear the list of the strike's victims
could grow to include academics if the strike lasts
much longer. The concern is real, but unfortunately
as vet, has not been addressed by either the union or
the University. It is something that both the Uni
versity, USW and students themselves must recog
nize before the strike drags on much further.
