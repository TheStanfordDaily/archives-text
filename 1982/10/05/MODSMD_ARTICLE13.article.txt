## Prerequisite for U.S. aid is progress 
### 
Indignation, outrage, a sense of betrayal and sadness fill
the mind when one tries to understand the recent Beirut
massacre. Even though thorough investigations have not yet
been conducted, people are holding Israel responsible for the
incident and are questioning the aid that the United States
sends to Israel.
The Mideast, though, holds no monopoly on death. While
the killing of approximately 600 Palestinian refugees in
Beirut attracted national attention, the hundreds of political
killings each month in El Salvador go virtually unnoticed.
Perhaps the United States should not try to parent and act as
world guardian to nations like El Salvador. Still, as long as
the United States continues to send aid to El Salvador, more
attention should be given to social problems in that nation.
An attempt must be made to ensure that U.S. aid leads to
meaningful change in the Salvadoran nation.
Late in July the U.S. government received indications that
progress was being made in El Salvador. Human rights were
improving and a program of land reform designed to give
Salvadoran peasants parcels of land was moving along at a
healthy pace. News of these advances resulted in the Reagan
administration's certification and the approval of Congress
in the form of a new aid package.
Only eight weeks have passed since El Salvador's progress
was lauded and rewarded. In that time, the country has seen
a tremendous increase in the number of political killings by
government troops and rightist death squads. Land reform
has slowed to a snail's pace. Overall, it looks like the small
progress in El Salvador from May through July was staged
with the intention of fooling the United States so that El
Salvador could receive further aid.
Ostensibly, the aid will help improve the living conditions
in a nation impoverished by fighting. El Salvador can man
age to distribute land, if it wishes to, but outside aid is re
quired for seed and tools needed to work the land itself.
Besides humanitarian reasons, the United States certainly
has strategic reasons for supporting El Salvador. Only a few
years ago, the domino theory was applied to Latin American
countries. If El Salvador received aid, then the United States
could hope to cement one of the dominos and possibly keep
other nations from leaning towards communism.
Despite the United States' other interests, aid should not
continue to flow into El Salvador if progress falters in land
reform and human rights. While a demand that another na
tion conform to our morality and sense of equality appears

imperialistic, our aid symbolizes an approval of conditions
within the recipient nation, and as such, the United States
deserves assurance that aid be used for its intended purposes.
One only need consider Iran to realize that U.S. aid has the
potential of creating a military state which is so socially un
acceptable to its inhabitants that radical change is bound to
occur.
Any hope for permanent stability in El Salvador lies in
land reform. It was not only complex political problems, but
simple and unrelenting structural poverty that led to vio
lence and an eventual change in government in 1979. At that
time 2 percent of El Salvador's population managed to rake
in more than half of the nation's earnings. As a result, a
three-part land redistribution program was put into effect in
an effort to expropriate land from wealthy landowners and
to parcel it out to peasants in packages of up to 17 acres.
A division in the government is holding up the effort to
redistribute land. Although the right, which opposes land
reform, only holds half of the seats in the Constituent As
sembly, it has taken control of the land distribution pro
gram. The cliche of the fox guarding the chicken coup most
definitely applies; land reform progressed only until El
Salvador secured U.S. aid.
The most recent aid package to El Salvador has already
received congressional approval, but before aid is renewed,
the United States should insist on continuing progress in re
turn for continuing aid. The current package was awarded
because El Salvador had managed to show an improvement
in human rights. For three months El Salvador kept the av
erage number of political deaths to 309. For such a small
country the room for improvement is still great. That three
month record is only evidence that proves the magnitude of
its difficulties
Possibly U.S. demands for reform in return for aid would
be met by a Salvadoran rejection of any U.S. intervention at
all. El Salvador's economic difficulties, though, tend to sug
gest that aid would not be passed up that quickly. The issues
of land distribution and human rights, on the other hand,
have already proven their capability of leading to sudden vi
olence and rapid change in the political and social at
mosphere of El Salvador. If the United States isn't careful to
ensure that it supports an increasingly peaceful and
progressive government in El Salvador, a sudden upheaval
may result in yet another government hostile to any Ameri
can ideas.

progressive government in El Salvador, a sudden upheaval

Indignation, outrage, a sense of betrayal and sadness fill
the mind when one tries to understand the recent Beirut
massacre. Even though thorough investigations have not yet
been conducted, people are holding Israel responsible for the
incident and are questioning the aid that the United States
sends to Israel.
The Mideast, though, holds no monopoly on death. While
the killing of approximately 600 Palestinian refugees in
Beirut attracted national attention, the hundreds of political
killings each month in El Salvador go virtually unnoticed.
Perhaps the United States should not try to parent and act as
world guardian to nations like El Salvador. Still, as long as
the United States continues to send aid to El Salvador, more
attention should be given to social problems in that nation.
An attempt must be made to ensure that U.S. aid leads to
meaningful change in the Salvadoran nation.
Late in July the U.S. government received indications that
progress was being made in El Salvador. Human rights were
improving and a program of land reform designed to give
Salvadoran peasants parcels of land was moving along at a
healthy pace. News of these advances resulted in the Reagan
administration's certification and the approval of Congress
in the form of a new aid package.
Only eight weeks have passed since El Salvador's progress
was lauded and rewarded. In that time, the country has seen
a tremendous increase in the number of political killings by
government troops and rightist death squads. Land reform
has slowed to a snail's pace. Overall, it looks like the small
progress in El Salvador from May through July was staged
with the intention of fooling the United States so that El
Salvador could receive further aid.
Ostensibly, the aid will help improve the living conditions
in a nation impoverished by fighting. El Salvador can man
age to distribute land, if it wishes to, but outside aid is re
quired for seed and tools needed to work the land itself.
Besides humanitarian reasons, the United States certainly
has strategic reasons for supporting El Salvador. Only a few
years ago, the domino theory was applied to Latin American
countries. If El Salvador received aid, then the United States
could hope to cement one of the dominos and possibly keep
other nations from leaning towards communism.
Despite the United States' other interests, aid should not
continue to flow into El Salvador if progress falters in land
reform and human rights. While a demand that another na
tion conform to our morality and sense of equality appears

imperialistic, our aid symbolizes an approval of conditions
within the recipient nation, and as such, the United States
deserves assurance that aid be used for its intended purposes.
One only need consider Iran to realize that U.S. aid has the
potential of creating a military state which is so socially un
acceptable to its inhabitants that radical change is bound to
occur.
Any hope for permanent stability in El Salvador lies in
land reform. It was not only complex political problems, but
simple and unrelenting structural poverty that led to vio
lence and an eventual change in government in 1979. At that
time 2 percent of El Salvador's population managed to rake
in more than half of the nation's earnings. As a result, a
three-part land redistribution program was put into effect in
an effort to expropriate land from wealthy landowners and
to parcel it out to peasants in packages of up to 17 acres.
A division in the government is holding up the effort to
redistribute land. Although the right, which opposes land
reform, only holds half of the seats in the Constituent As
sembly, it has taken control of the land distribution pro
gram. The cliche of the fox guarding the chicken coup most
definitely applies; land reform progressed only until El
Salvador secured U.S. aid.
The most recent aid package to El Salvador has already
received congressional approval, but before aid is renewed,
the United States should insist on continuing progress in re
turn for continuing aid. The current package was awarded
because El Salvador had managed to show an improvement
in human rights. For three months El Salvador kept the av
erage number of political deaths to 309. For such a small
country the room for improvement is still great. That three
month record is only evidence that proves the magnitude of
its difficulties
Possibly U.S. demands for reform in return for aid would
be met by a Salvadoran rejection of any U.S. intervention at
all. El Salvador's economic difficulties, though, tend to sug
gest that aid would not be passed up that quickly. The issues
of land distribution and human rights, on the other hand,
have already proven their capability of leading to sudden vi
olence and rapid change in the political and social at
mosphere of El Salvador. If the United States isn't careful to
ensure that it supports an increasingly peaceful and
progressive government in El Salvador, a sudden upheaval
may result in yet another government hostile to any Ameri
can ideas.
