## University should 'yield' to bike sign protest 
### 
Painting bike lanes on the pavement
between Tresidder and the History Cor
ner is an excellent step toward getting
both bicyclists and pedestrians where
they're going with a minimum of incon
venience, terror and danger. Painted
lines arc one thing, but the new yield
signs are something else entirely.
The apparent purpose of the yield
signs is to prevent collisions at busy in
tersections. That's a worthy goal, but
signposts are a self-defeating means of
achieving it. Erecting rigid metal
signposts in the middle of traffic on
campus makes as much sense as anchor
ing stop light poles in the middle of traf
fic on El Camino Real. Those posts will
cause five bike/pole collisions for every
bike/bike collision they prevent. Why
would the Bicycle Safety Committee de
feat its own purpose by erecting fla
grant hazards just where they are most
likely to do the most damage?
I wonder if the ink on this page will be
dry before bikes start getting wrapped
around the signposts. I wonder how
many pedestrians, deep in thought as
Stanford pedestrians tend to be, will get
bloody noses and dented foreheads
from running into them. 1 wonder how
many injury-related lawsuits the unnec

essarv signposts will generate.
Max Mazenko of the Bicycle Safety
Committee says the whole program is
an experiment. That presumably means
the committee intends to learn from its
mistakes. The yield signposts are a dan
gerous mistake and should be taken
down immediately — this morning —
before they cause any serious injuries.
Even painting them bright colors Avill
not remove the hazard — people do
walk and ride at night when colors
wouldn't show.
The posts can be replaced by the
word "yield" painted on the pavement
or — if there really is some intelligent
reason why a sign has to be above the
line of sight — by hanging a horizontal,
boom-type arm out from the side like a
stop light, well out of harm's way.
As both a bicyclist and a pedestrian, I
welcome the bike paths and am happy
to keep my appointed path whether
walking or riding. But those rigid yield
signposts have got to go and they have
got to go today. The University can ill
afford the lawsuits it is setting itself up
for.

Israel not at fault
"Massacre a part of Israeli Policy"
(Daily, Sept. 29) was so fantastic in its
bold fiction that I find myself totally at
a loss to counter such a massive array of
lies and distortions. Perhaps a good
start would be to invite Nawfal Umari
to respond by finding two consecutive
sentences in his own article which do
not contain at least one explicit or im
plicit untruth. If he can do so, I will re
tract this rebuttal with a formal
apology.
Now, let's expose some of the more
blatant and treacherous tales Umari
would have us swallow. He has the gall
to imply that Israel was behind the as
sassination of Bashir Gemayel. He
wants us to believe that all Arab groups
that hate the Palestinians are "Israel's
right-wing allies." He rewrites history
and asserts that the PLO left Beirut with
order and "ahead of schedule" (whose
schedule?) and that the "leftist militia
was cooperating with the army" — you
see, since the PLO entered Lebanon and
butchered the population and army in
the '70s, they've understood the necessi
ty of working with the authorities.
Next we are treated to the first of four
jaundiced descriptions of the field of
battle. About the only thing he left out

was the man with his legs shot off run
ning, on the jagged edges of his femurs,
into the Israeli flamethrower.
Of course Umari manages to imply
that the Israelis were responsible for the
actual act of the massacre. He quotes
figures accurately but forgets, quite
conveniently, that they were readjusted
to fractions of these unofficial esti
mates.
The entire article was rife with much
more factual and conceptual deception
than I can possibly discuss here. One
statement does stand out, however.
Umari refers to "Israeli's daunting
propaganda apparatus." After living in
Israel for the past thirteen months, two
thoughts came to mind when I read this:
first, there is quite obviously an anti-Is
raeli propaganda machine running
most of the media coverage here (or
ganized terrorists hold a country of in
nocents virtually hostage and come out
looking like the poor, oppressed he
roes?!). Second, although I came into
contact with PLO members in Israel
and have read almost humorous anti-
Israeli propaganda in this country and
abroad, I have seldom read a piece as
imaginative or as rancid as "Massacre a
part of Israeli policy."
