## The 						changing face of Stanford: 2082? 
### 
Hello, and welcome to Stanfordland
'82. On behalf of all of us in the admin
istration, let me thank you for travelling
so far away from civilization just to visit
us, and special thanks to those of you
who drove through those treacherous
South Bay Wastelands.
We're very excited about our newest
attraction, the Lake Lag Submarine!
Climb aboard and explore the lake's
mysterious bottom, where we've recre
ated the Coral Reef, the Titanic and the
Lost Colony of Atlantis! You won't
want to miss the Lag Submarine — it
opens sometime this winter — and
you'll also want to buy the souvenir T
shirts and drinking cups on sale at the
Boathouse.
Of course, all our old favorites are
back this year, like the Western Culture
Extravaganza. Housed in what used to
be Green Library, the Extravaganza's
moving benches plunge you down the
mouth of Dante's inferno and into the
splendor of Voltaire's El Dorado.
You'll cheer as John Locke builds
the framework for democracy, chirp
along as St. Francis preaches to the
birds and laugh out loud when
Cardinal Richelieu falls down and gets
his red suit dirty. No other university
has Western Culture as we have it, so
we think it's worth those long, long
lines. Afterwards, don't forget such
standbys as the Hoover Tower Space
Needle, the Once-Around-The-Quad
Roller Coaster, and Seeley G. Mudd's

House of Horrors.
I also urge you to check our Stan
fordland's original attractions: our aca
demic departments. Every hour on the
hour, you can see economics and politi
cal science professors battle it out at
Maples Pavilion — reigning champ is
Tom "Knockout" Lantos 111, who
boasts a strong command of fiscal in
tricacies and a vicious left hook. There
is also the magic show and comedy rou
tine at the Physics Tank, and the "Lib
eral Arts Show," where an English pro
fessor dives from 60 feet while a philos
ophy professor tries to prove that the
bucket of water does not exist.
Finally, be sure to visit Old Stan
fordland, located next to the fraternity
ruins on Campus Drive, where Stan
ford's history is recreated before our
eyes. See Leland clear away the trees
while Jane makes lemonade. See David
Starr Jordan at Stickney's capturing the
first students. See the early settlers froth
at the mouth about mascots. Your
hosts for these exhibits are robot
replicas of Herbert Hoover, Lucie
Stern and Darrin Nelsion.
While I have the chance, I'd like to
briefly address some of the complaints
we've been hearing here at Stan
fordland. Recently, we've been receiv
ing many complaints about our prices,
which range from $12.95 for a cherry
slurpee to $187.95 for one night at the
Wilbur Hotel to our "whatever we

think you'll cough up" entrance fee at
the Milton Friedman Memorial. Well,
folks, we're doing our best to keep costs
down, but we aren't going to com
promise any of the high standards that
make Stanfordland so special. So, to
keep providing you with the best in
quality entertainment, you're just going
to have to keep paying through the nose
for it.
Last, many of you are worried about
that pesky worker's strike, which is cel
ebrating its 100 th anniversary this year.
I'm glad to report, though, that
progress is at hand. We've agreed on the
shape of the negotiating table (it's going
to be rectangular) and it's been decided
that the union, not the administration,
will provide the Hi-C and cold cuts. In
the meantime, I hope the strike does not
inconvenience you. Please refrain, how
ever, from begging for food scraps from
passing motorists; it is neither sanitary
nor nutritious.
Once again let me, as president of this
university, welcome you to Stan
fordland '82. I know it's going to be a I
great year for all of us.
Yours sincerely,
Joseph Berman 111
