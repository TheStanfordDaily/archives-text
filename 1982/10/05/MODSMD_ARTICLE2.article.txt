# University police arrest 13 strikers
## 
### JULIE KAUFMANN Senior staff writer 
Escalating strike activity led to the arrest of 13 pickets
yesterday, but University figures show employees are trickl
ing back to work.
About 36 percent of the 1321 maintenance, service and
technical employees in the bargaining unit were on the job
yesterday — the highest number since the walkout began,
said University representative Karen Bartholomew.
Sept. 10, the first day of the strike, 27 percent of the United
Stanford Workers membership reported to work, she said,
and the number has been increasing ever since.
Stanford police arrested 10 people — five USW members
and five local union leaders — as strikers tried to keep con
struction workers off the student housing project site early
yesterday morning.
Three more arrests later in the day brought the strike total
to at least 24.
An especially determined picket line prompted the large
scale arrest, said Stanford Police Capt. Marvin Moore. "We
don't want to arrest these people, we have to work with them
after the s{ri.kf is oven But we were pushed into a corner and
we had to react," Moore said.
At least three pickets sat down in front of vehicles and had
to be carried away, he added.
University workers arrested on charges of unlawful as

sembly and obstructing traffic were Wouter Broers, Stan
ford Linear Accelerator Center welder; William Devita,
SLAC employee, Rhoda Love, glass washer at the Medical
School; John Quesada, maintenance worker; and Manuel
Quesada, interdepartmental mail worker.
Arrested on similar charges were William Callahan, a field
representative for the American Federation of State, County
and Municipal Employees; Peter Cervantes-Gautschi, busi
ness manager of the Santa Clara County Central Labor
Council; John Listinsky, senior field representative; James
Potterton, director of the labor studies program at San Jose
Citv College; and William Twohey, executive board member
of the Santa Clara County Central Labor Council.
Spider-shaped spikes made from sharpened nails flattened
six or seven tires at Bonair Siding about noon yesterday. Po
lice said they found several of the devices and arrested equip
ment operator Enrique Bustamonte on vandalism charges.
About 11:30 a.m., SLAC welder Edward Guthrie was ar
rested on a vandalism charge stemming from a broken car
headlight. Utilities maintenance worker Alfonso Dillard
was arrested at the construction site and charged with ob
structing a police officer.
There are still no negotiations scheduled in the longest
strike ever against the University. Union and University of
ficials last met Oct. I with federal mediators, but no
progress was made.
