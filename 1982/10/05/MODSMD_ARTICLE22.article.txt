## Richard Gere battles narcissism in 'Officer' 'An Officer and a Gentleman' Richard Gere and Debra Winger, trying to ignore Gere's past image 
### 
The film is archaic and schematic,
with appalling platitudes clocked in
right on schedule.

Richard Gere gives a polished,
accomplished performance in An
Officer and a Gentleman — and
that's precisely what's wrong
with it. We never see him arrive at
even his emotional, revelatory
moments; he has so obviously
worked out every detail in ad
vance that what we see looks like
packaging rather than acting.
Brando once said that he pre
ferred to use cue cards on a set be
cause not knowing his next line
enabled him to show the camera
those few seconds before we
speak, when we flounder and
gather our wits. Gere's acting
functions like clockwork,
without pauses — an admirable
feat, but he frustrates our efforts
to make a human connection
with any character he plays.
Furthermore, he seems smilingly
conscious of his own adeptness.
This narcissistic quality is built
into most of his roles, but whe'
— in American Gigolo, on stage
in Bent, and now in An Officer
and a Gentleman — the cool, ego
centric bastard hero is supposed
to break down and become a
sympathetic human being,
Gere's self-amusement continues
to repel us slightly.
This new picture, which treats
the metamorphosis of a selfish
loner, Zack Mayo, in the course
of a naval officer training pro
gram near Seattle, furnishes a
striking contrast between Gere's
slick actorishness and the real
thing. Debra Winger plays Paula,
a worker at the local paper fac
tory who falls for Zack, with a
direct, clear-eyed sexiness that
seems elemental, and the convic
tion she brings to their scenes in
bed makes them genuinely erotic.
Nothing Paula does feels wrong
or tricked up. At one point, Zack
and Paula share confidences —
she talks about her mother's life
long employment in the factory,
he tells her that his mother com
mitted suicide — and though his
confession has more dramatic
weight and ought to carry the
scene, Winger reveals so many
layers of hurt and determination
that Gere simply fades away.
It's lucky for the movie that
Winger plays the girl friend,
David Keith the best buddy and
Lou Gossett the drill instructor,
and that Taylor Hackford
directed it and Donald Thorin
shot it, because they all work
hard (and, according to the box
office receipts, successfully) at
persuading audiences that what
they're seeing is fresh. It isn't.
The closer one gets to An Officer
and a Gentleman, the more clearly
one sees that what lies beneath its
warm, lively surface is nothing
but old movies — specifically, the
World War II and Korean War
era movies that showed anti-so
cial jerks (like John Garfield in
Air Force) being shaped into
brave soldiers and upstanding
members of the greater American
community. The screenwriter,
Douglas Day Stewart, works
from a compendium of Holly
wood cliches: Zack, abandoned
after his mother's death to the
laissez-faire society of his pro
miscuous sailor dad (Robert
Loggia), is redeemed by both the

love of a faithful woman and the
unflagging prodding of a hard
assed DI with faith in Zack's
potential. Almost every scene
carries its own mini-movie his
tory with it: the one in which the
drill sergeant saves a panicked
candidate from drowning, the
one in which the mercenary re
cruit proves how much he's
grown by polishing his
bunkmate's belt buckle for free,
the one about his sacrificing the
glorv of completing an obstacle
course in record time in order to

Gere*s acting functions like clockwork,
without pauses — an admirable feat, but he
frustrates our efforts to make a human
connection with any character he plays.
Furthermore, he seems smilingly conscious

quality is built into most of his roles...

help a discouraged fellow recruit
over a wall. Stewart even gets
away with backtracking and re
peating ideas — Zack comes of
age three or four times — and
with occasional glaring errors.
For instance, Zack fights with a
townie in a bar who calls him a
warmonger, surely a label few
young men in uniform have had
to endure since Vietnam (and
never the kind of insult thrown
around barrooms by locals).
The film is archaic and
schematic, with appalling
platitudes clocked in right on
schedule. Zack's pal Sid Worley
(David Keith, who does wonders

with his role) has a fling with
Paula's best friend Lynette (Lisa
Blount), who pretends to be preg
nant to keep him. Paula has too
much integrity to play that sort of
game, but we learn that her
mother tried a similar ploy by
getting pregnant (with Paula),
though her Navy man deserted
her anyway. In one particularly
deplorable tete-a-tete, she warns
her daughter not to run after
Zack, who has stopped calling
her, because if she does, she'll end
up lying or resorting to trickery

to hold on to him. All the women
in the factory appear to be in
volved full time in the business of
finding Navy lovers and dream
ing up ways to turn them into
husbands; it's a dismaying group
portrait. The only woman in the
movie who doesn't work at the
factory is Seeger (Lisa
Eilbacher), one of the recruits,
but Stewart and Hackford don't
allow us to learn much about her
— like what motivated her to
throw herself into such a tradi
tionally male-dominated pro
fession. She exists purely as a
contrast to Zack, so that Foley,
the D I , can compare him un

favorably to someone with
"heart and guts".
Considering that Foley, Lou
Gossett's role, is even more firm-
Iv grounded in other movies than
evervone else's, he deserves all
the praise he's received for the wit
and style of his performance, and
more for his restraint. He wisely
chose to play Foley as a comic
creation, who delights in how
much more clever he is than any
of his recruits and how relentless
ly accurate he is at sizing each of
them up. But despite Gossett, the
training camp episodes manipu
late us as efficiently as Foley ma
nipulates his crew, and I don't
think we're better people as a re
sult of the experience. This is only
Taylor Hackford's second fea
ture; his first, The Idolmaker, set
in the pre-Beatles rock 'n' roll
world, displayed the kind of as
surance most directors take years

to acquire. An Offiter anda'Gen
tleman isn't schlock, but it is a
snowjob — for a young director
of Hackford's talent, it could be
the first mile on the primrose
path.

'The Chosen'

I think 1 would have enjoyed
The Chosen more if I'd been al
lowed to use my own emotions
on it, but the director, Jeremy
Paul Kagan, who keeps his actors
in a close-up vise during the
climactic scenes, has done all the
feeling for us. The story of the
friendship between the Hassidic
rabbi's son who wants to study
psychology and the Jewish liberal
scholar's son who decides to be
come a rabbi carried con
siderable power in the Chaim
Potok novel, and a fair amount
of it remains in the film, which
Edwin Gordon adapted, even
though the screenplay is even
more pedantic than the book.
And the gloomy photography
(by Arthur Ornitz) and ersatz
eastern Jewish score (by Elmer
Bernstein) aren't estimable ob
stacles, really. One can even for
give Kagan for the scenes he
blows completely — the baseball
game fiasco, when Danny, the

/Hassid, hits a ball right at Re
uven's forehead, or the college
party at Reuven's when he finds
that his father has collapsed from
a stroke — because the Hassidic
scenes demonstrate that Kagan
has done his homework and he
has some authentic feeling for the
material. What wrecks the film is
i that it denies us the pleasure of
making our own discoveries.
The showpiece part in the pic
ture is Reb Saunders, Danny's
father, who has raised his son in
silence in order to teach him com
passion (a poetic conceit that, I
suspect, is far from foolproof in
practice). Rod Steiger gives an

entertaining performance in the
role, and he certainly suggests the
comfort of a man accustomed to
wielding great personal power,
hut his approach is so familiar to
moviegoers bv now — his habit
of taking his speeches away from
any actor he's addressing, his
fondness for underplaying a big

moment, only to swing back with
a bigger one — that it tends to un
dercut the seriousness of his
work. Besides, he hardly seems
ideally cast as a man who com
municates with silence.
In fact, the casting is generally
on the bizarre side. Perhaps the
filmmakers imagined that Robby
Benson would be right for Danny
because he always acts like a ju
venile in a silent film (his eyes
have one setting for anger, anoth
er for annoyance, and so on), but
he looks absurd in forelocks and
his stab at a Yiddish New York
accent is pathetic — and oddly
self-satisfied. He plays Danny as

sweet, open and friendly, while
Barry Miller makes Reuven
brooding, closed and distant;
didn't Kagan get these roles in re
verse? Miller does the best sus
tained acting in The Chosen, but
(as in Fame) he seems unduly
sour. He'd probably be a better
actor if his mood improved.
