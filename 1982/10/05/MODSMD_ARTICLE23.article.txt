The Who
It's Hard
Warner Bros. Records
Pete Townshend of The Who
has finally faced up to the im
plications of writing "I hope I die
before I get old." Following
through on the hints contained in
his two recent solo albums (Emp
ty Glass and All the Best Cowboys
Have Chinese Eyes), Townshend
has finally broken through the
barriers implied by that brash
youthful velp of rebellion and de
fiance. Surely the line may still
hold true to Townshend and The
Who, but now it does so only as a
metaphor as to what the possi
bilities of growing old have to of
fer. Instead of copping out and
resting on one's laurels (the ma
jor fault of The Who's previous
album, Face Dances),
Townshend is not only confront- -

ing growing old, but confronting
it with a burning vengeance.
It's Hard, the Who's new LP, is
an album full of powerful
statements. It concerns itself with
one's growing responsibilities in
the face of growing older. It is an
album full of statements of
purpose, and its major theme is
that although things may be
hard, it is one's duty to fight and
demand the freedom to live. The
Who takes on nuclear war,
starvation, deprivation of human
rights and the lies inherent in the
world (and in rock and roll) with
a determined passion. Here
Townshend is living down his
past because he really isn't going
to be fooled again. As he says,
"Let you tears flow; Let your
past go."
Musically, The Who is as
forceful as ever. There is an aura
of militant urgency that per

meates this album. The album at
tacks the lies of the past and
leaves open the possibility of
hope for the future. It attacks
itself, too. to get at the problems
inherent in the outer world. In
"Crv If You Want," Townshend
writes of the implications found
in his own "Who" past: "Once it
was just innocence, brash ideas
and insolence, but you will never
pet away with the things you say
today." It is a realist's point of
view as Townshend tears down
the walls of falsehoods one has
built to protect oneself from the
fears of life — "Don't you get
embarassed when you read the
precious things you said many
many years ago when life ap
peared rosy red ... Don't you
want to hide your face . .. and
read the crap you wrote about
"Ban the Bomb."
Again and again, Townshend

cuts down others (and himself,
for becoming complacent with
the hardships and wrongs of life
— "The sun shines and people
forget... the girls smile and peo
ple forget ... the drinks flow,
people forget, forget they're hid
ing." He points out the hypocrisy
of our so called peace talks and
peace forces (as in the United Na
tions) bv equating a figure of war
(Athena) with one of love (a girl)
— "Athena, I had no idea how
much I'd need her; In peaceful
times I hold her close and I feed
her. . . She's just a girl — she's a
bomb."
The Who are not letting the lis
tener forget or hide behind any
vague statements. There is no
beating around the bush. No
longer are The Who asking
"Who are you?" They are telling
you exactly who you are and
what is happening around you —

"People are suffering, I'll say it
again .. . People are hungry, I'll
say it again . . . People are bleed
ing, I'll say it again." The tone is
so harsh and to the point.
Townshend is cruel an d condem
ning. He puts the blame on us
and himself — "So many rash
promises sincerely made by peo
ple who believe that we were
being saved, they made us believe
that we were acting white but the
truth is we've forgotten how to
fight.. . Why did I fall for that?"
Townshend can offer no hope
in rectifying the promises that
turn to lies. As he says, "Maybe if
we smile the clock'll fade away;
maybe we can force the hands to
just reverse. Maybe is a word,
maybe maybe is a curse!" How
ever, although he cannot help
change the misconceptions of
people and promises overnight,
he realizes the potential inherent
in people to use their energies in a
positive manner. He admits "it's
a hard hard hand to hold; it's a
hard land to control," but he also
allows for hope — "Anyone can
do anything if they hold the right
card .. . Deal me another hand
Lord, this one's very hard."
The final statement of purpose
is in a song reminiscent in style
and sound to "Won't Get Fooled
Again." In this song, "I've
Known No War," Townshend
states the horrors of nuclear war
("I know I'll never know war,
and if I ever do, the glimpse will
be short, fireball in the sky. no

front line battle cries"), and he
condemns the false hopes of peo
ple to disregard and forget the is
sue ("There's no point pretend
ing that knowing will help us
abort").
The Who's intentions on this
album are heartfelt and relevant.
The music and playing is as pow-






erful as anything they've ever
done. The band has never
sounded so convincing and yet so
desperate. They face up to the
harsh issues of the world with a
frenzied urgency. It's Hard is an
album of facing the challenges.
It's a hard album to accept, and
an even harder album to follow.
