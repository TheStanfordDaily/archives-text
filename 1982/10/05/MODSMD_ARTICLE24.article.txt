### TONY KELLY 
Elvis Costello
Imperial Bedroom
Columbia Records
History repeats the old con
ceits/The glib replies, the same
defeats.
OK, so forget about Nick
Lowe. Forget about James
Brown, the Motown sound, and
especially "Watching the Detec
tives". George Jones, who's he?
Elvis Costello doesn't want to be
like any of those folks.
Elvis. Costello wants to grow
< up to be just like his dear old dad.
For those of you too hip to
read Rolling Stone, here's a little
history. Ross McManus, father
of Declan (aka EC), was a
cabaret singer in England for
about 20 years. Hell, he may still
be around, for all it matters to
you and me. But for dutiful son
Elvis, following in his father's
footsteps in the slightly more
profitable world of rock music,
the past matters a lot. On Im
perial Bedroom, his latest album,
Costello begs, borrows and steals
from a whole field of musical
straws, mostly remnants of his

own career. The result isn't bad,
after you factor in some style
points for sheer diversity. But at
the same time, the album seems
malnourished, especially in the
light of a bunch of well-fed pre
vious albums.
Giving you more of what for
always worked for me before.

If Elvis Costello's career
hadn't seemed curiously self-de
feating to you before, then you're
the kind of person who bets on
Sisyphus. From his notorious
early days as the Angry Young
Wimp of skinny-tie English rock
to his later whirls in the Fat,
Dumb and Happy school of
country music, Costello has rare
- ly been content with playing to an
audience's taste. Even a relatively

tame song like "Clubland" on
1981 's Trust has a particular res
onance to him, and apparently to
himself alone. The last three
times Costello has visited this
coast, he used the same arrange
ment and lighting effects for the
song, altering it only to heighten
the smoky barroom drama of the
piece. This consistency, rare for
Costello, is a hint to the ambi
tions revealed on Bedroom — a
sometimes awkward, but steady
progression away from rock
raveups and toward a dramatic,
piano-laden style somewhere be
tween Tin Pan Alley and Danny
Marona at the local Marriott.
Almost blue/Almost doing
things we used to do/There's a girl
here and she's almost you.
Of course, there are some
heavy prices to be paid for the
heavy poses Elvis strikes in Im
perial Bedroom. To begin with,
the torrents of words flung at the
listener from the recesses of Cos
tello's mouth, tantalizingly in
coherent in many earlier works,
are now spelled out a little too
clearly. Despite all the passion

and vocal gymnastics of the
songs — and make no mistake,
the record is beautifully sung — it
seems that Costello is no longer
singing about anything, least of
all himself. "Tears Before Bed
time," a fun song with an unstop
pable Temptations
chorus/fadeout, points out the
necessity in Costello's songs to
fill up available rhythms with
words, regardless of their pro
priety. "The Long Honeymoon"
is the worst offender, combining
a cheesy Wurlitzer "jazz" rhythm
line with a pseudo-George Jones

dramatic sense. Both styles leave
me cold.
Perhaps the key to the mystery
lies in the lack of mystery; the lyr
ic sheet (a first on a Costello
album) is too precise, typed out
to catch every pun, every word
play that individually seems
catchy but adds up to a general
malaise on Imperial Bedroom.
So what if this is a man's
world/1 want to be a kid again
about it.
The lack of interest in the
words of Elvis Costello is re
doubled by the surprising pro
duction on the album. Back when
Nick Lowe and Costello had a
mutual admiration society going,
the former's pop sensibilities
kept a lid on things going too far

afield. And Costello seems to
have learned his share from the
alliance; "Man Out of Time" has
been getting some airplay on AM
radio (KFRC, no less), and
you've got to love a song about
murder and espionage with
"Cruel to Be Kind" tambourines
in the background.
But by and large, there's a heck
of a lot of piano tinkling on
Bedroom, and the threat of losing
a bottom end to the mix is
averted only by Bruce Thomas'
agile bass playing. In fact, this
album marks the best playing by
the Attractions in at least a cou
ple of years, possibly their best
work yet; unfortunately, the out
standing moments are all buried
in the introductions and the
fadeouts to the songs. "Beyond
Belief," "Shabby Doll," "Man
Out of Time," "The Loved
Ones," and "Pidgin English" all
have terrific riffs in them some
where, but producer Geoff Emer
ick and Costello couldn't have
done a better job of stamping
them out with a sledgehammer,
throwing little production effects
and gimmickry to distance them
selves from the songs. All of a
sudden, we're back to the Sis
yphus syndrome.

Other boys use the splendor of
their trembling lip/ They're so ted
dy bear tender and tragically hip.
Of course, it's far from reason
able to assume that Elvis and the
boys should spend their time
trying to be sincere in a business
that rates about a 9.7 on the
Fake-O- Meter. And for Costello,
this type of artifice is probably a
more personal form of ex
pression than any single song he's
written; he clearly loves the form
of music he's performing right
now, and he certainly has a load
of musical tradition behind him
(regardless of old Papa
McManus). What's more, the
record seems to be a bona fide
hit, currently sitting in the Top 10
of most record bins. However,
there's a definite feeling of
fatigue lurking around the end of
Imperial Bedroom; not from the
expense of too much energy, but
from tiring of a game that's gone
on too long. Elvis Costello is
clearly settled into Long-Term-
Artist-land, and that's alright —
the problem is that in doing so,
the fog that surrounds him seems
to have stagnated.




If Elvis Costello's career
hadn't seemed curiously
4 self-defeating to you
before, then you're the
kind of person who bets
on Sisyphus.
