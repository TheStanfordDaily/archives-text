# CLASS loan program may start soon

A new California loan program de
signed to help students bridge the gap
between rising tuition costs and cut
backs in federal student loans could be
gin as soon as December, according to
the director of the California Student
Aid Commission.
The program, called California Loan
Assistance for Students (CLASS), will
provide loans to parents of under
graduates as well as to graduate stu
dents, Director Art Marmaduke told a
California assembly subcommittee in a
Palo Alto hearing yesterday.
Though confident, Marmaduke
warned that the program still faces the
obstacle of attracting enough lending
organizations to participate.
"It's not going to be a success until
large lenders become involved," he
said. Marmaduke said that 13 lenders
had agreed to participate in the pro
gram but that seven of the smaller or
ganizations had withdrawn because
they feared they would be innundated
with more loan requests than they could
handle.
The CLASS program will be just like
the federal Parent Loan for Under
graduate Students (PLUS) program.
The PLUS program provides loans up
to a maximum of $3000 to parents of
college students.
"It is interesting that CLASS is a
state program under the aegis of a fed
eral program, because the state is taking
an active role," said Tim Warner, assis
tant provost in the University's Office
of Management and Budget.
Unlike guaranteed student loans
(GSLs) which have a consistent seven
or nine percent interest rate, PLUS loan
rates fluctuate and are dependent upon
the 90-day federal treasury bill rate. The
interest rate for a PLUS loan would be
12 percent if the program were current
ly in effect.
CLASS is also similar to the Univer
sity's Parent Loan Program. However,
Stanford is only one of a handful of
schools which can afford its own loan
programs, according to Warner. The
current interest rate for Stanford Parent
loans is 14.25 percent.
"At a place like Stanford or another
independent institution where tuition is
high, it is advantageous to have addi
tional funds available for students," he
said.
Warner said it would be difficult to
predict how many students would take
advantage of the CLASS program
when it starts. "It could well be a popu
lar program, but what's hard to tell is
just how popular it will be," he said.
