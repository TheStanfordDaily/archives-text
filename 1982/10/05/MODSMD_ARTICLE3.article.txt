# Recycling program seeks new funding
## 
### BILL AINSWORTH 
In the wake of an $18,000 loss last
year and a predicted $16,000 loss this
year, the ASSU Recycling Project is
currently exploring options that will al
low the project to remain a viable oper
ation, including a fee assessment.
Project Manager Fred Beddall ex
ressed disappointment that the Univer
sity has not yet offered to finance part
of the costs of running the program. "I
think we are directly saving the Univer
sity money," Beddall said. "Stanford
should pay us for diverting 700 tons of
waste from the Palo Alto dump and sav
ing them waste disposal costs," he
added.
However, the University contends
that if the 700 tons diverted by the re
cycling effort were added to the garbage
the University presently disposes of at
the Palo Alto City Dump, the extra
waste would not add to the disposal
costs because of the way those costs are
computed.
Meanwhile, negotations are current
ly underway between the Council of
Presidents (COP) and the University
obtain funding for a litter prevention
program. But, according to Student Fi

nancial Manager Bob Brody, that pro
gram — even if it were entirely funded
bv the University — would not replace
the current project.
Beddall said that the project would
seek a fee assessment as a last avenue of
funding. He said, though, that before
the project will attempt to get a fee
assessment, "There are lots of creative
fund-raising options that could be ex
plored." Included among these, he said,
would be grants from different levels of
government or funding from alumni or
corporations.
If the fee assessment option is chosen,
Beddall said the project would seek a
two-quarter assessment. The first quar
ter assessment would cover operating
expenses and the second would be used
to build up an endowment.
When the Recycling Project was
founded in 1978, it received a three
quarter fee assessment, but it has not re
ceived an assessment since that time.
Beddall cited the lowered cost of re
cvlced material as one of the major rea
sons for the project's large losses last
year. According to Beddall, in the last
15 to 18 months prices for cardboard
dropped by around 67 percent,

aluminum prices fell about 33 percent
and glass, newspaper and white ledger
prices all recorded substantial de
creases.
Other reasons for the loss include a
lost Comprehensive Employment
Training Act (CETA) position and a
loss of about half of its work study fi
nancing due to federal cutbacks, Bed
dall said.
In 1981, Beddall said, the project lost
around $8000.
In order to save money on sorting,
the project has instituted a policy this
year of not accepting paper products
other than newspapers from
dormitories.
"If people left stuff in barrels like we
wanted it, our labor costs would be cut
in half," he said.
The savings from the reduced sorting
costs this year will be offset partially by
higher labor costs which will result
from the increase in the University min
imum wage from 53.85 t054.30, accord
ing to Brody. This is one of the reasons,
Brody said, that he predicted a $16,000
loss for the project this year.
Another measure being taken to cut
costs is an attempt to reduce the
number of non-student employess, ac
cording to Beddall. Last year the
project paid $1000 in federal taxes for
non-student employees, he said.
ASSU Senate Deputy Chair Roc
Blumenthal said, "Nobody around
here wants to close the project it's just a
question of whether or not we can foot
the bill."
According to Blumenthal, the main
reason the senate is even considering
dropping the project is not last year's
$18,000 loss but rather this year's pre
dicted loss.

added.
However, the University contends
that if the 700 tons diverted by the re
cycling effort were added to the garbage
the University presently disposes of at
the Palo Alto City Dump, the extra
waste would not add to the disposal
costs because of the way those costs are
computed.
Meanwhile, negotations are current
ly underway between the Council of
Presidents (COP) and the University
obtain funding for a litter prevention
program. But, according to Student Fi

nancial Manager Bob Brody, that pro
gram — even if it were entirely funded
bv the University — would not replace
the current project.
Beddall said that the project would
seek a fee assessment as a last avenue of
funding. He said, though, that before
the project will attempt to get a fee
assessment, "There are lots of creative
fund-raising options that could be ex
plored." Included among these, he said,
would be grants from different levels of
government or funding from alumni or
corporations.
If the fee assessment option is chosen,
Beddall said the project would seek a
two-quarter assessment. The first quar
ter assessment would cover operating
expenses and the second would be used
to build up an endowment.
When the Recycling Project was
founded in 1978, it received a three
quarter fee assessment, but it has not re
ceived an assessment since that time.
Beddall cited the lowered cost of re
cvlced material as one of the major rea
sons for the project's large losses last
year. According to Beddall, in the last
15 to 18 months prices for cardboard
dropped by around 67 percent,

aluminum prices fell about 33 percent
and glass, newspaper and white ledger
prices all recorded substantial de
creases.
Other reasons for the loss include a
lost Comprehensive Employment
Training Act (CETA) position and a
loss of about half of its work study fi
nancing due to federal cutbacks, Bed
dall said.
In 1981, Beddall said, the project lost
around $8000.
In order to save money on sorting,
the project has instituted a policy this
year of not accepting paper products
other than newspapers from
dormitories.
"If people left stuff in barrels like we
wanted it, our labor costs would be cut
in half," he said.
The savings from the reduced sorting
costs this year will be offset partially by
higher labor costs which will result
from the increase in the University min
imum wage from 53.85 t054.30, accord
ing to Brody. This is one of the reasons,
Brody said, that he predicted a $16,000
loss for the project this year.
Another measure being taken to cut
costs is an attempt to reduce the
number of non-student employess, ac
cording to Beddall. Last year the
project paid $1000 in federal taxes for
non-student employees, he said.
ASSU Senate Deputy Chair Roc
Blumenthal said, "Nobody around
here wants to close the project it's just a
question of whether or not we can foot
the bill."
According to Blumenthal, the main
reason the senate is even considering
dropping the project is not last year's
$18,000 loss but rather this year's pre
dicted loss.
