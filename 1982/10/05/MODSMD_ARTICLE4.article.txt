Israel attacks in response to ambush
Jerusalem — Israeli jets attacked Syrian troops and missile concentrations
in the mountains east of Beirut yesterday, a day after the ambush of an Israeli
troop-carrying bus in which six soldiers were killed and 22 wounded. There
was no report of casualties in the air strike.
A Defense Ministry spokesman said jet fighter-bombers hit Syrian SAM-9
sites along the Beirut-Damascus highway, near the site of the ambush Sun
day.
No group has claimed responsibility for the ambush but Defense Ministry
officials here blame the Palestine Liberation Organization.
Witnesses in Lebanon said four jets attacked the troop and missile sites,
whiie four other planes flew cover.
The Israeli Defense Ministry said Syrian jets were airborne at the time but
did hot engage the Israeli planes. The defense spokesman added that several
surface-to-air missiles were fired, but scored no hits.
The air attack came shortly after an emergency meeting of the Israeli Cabi
net was held to determine the government's response to the ambush.
There was no comment from stern-faced ministers after the meeting, and
the military did not say the air strike was retaliation for the ambush. But
there was a cause-and-effect pattern: a guerrilla attack on Israeli forces fol
lowed by an Israeli air strike.
The Cabinet session also reported to have discussed the scheduled visit
here today of Morris Draper, deputy to U.S. special envoy Philip Habib,
with details of the American weekend diplomatic mission to Damascus. The
United States is attempting to devise a formula to the withdrawal of Israeli
and Syrian troops from Lebanon.
A number of unconfirmed reports from Damascus suggested
that the Syrians were willing to withdraw their 25,000 troops
from Lebanon if the Israelis did the same with their 70,000 men.
The reports said both sides would withdraw simultaneously in
phases.
Israeli officials indicated that they had not yet received any de
tails of the Habib plan but expected to learn them from Am
bassador Draper.
Veterans administrator Nimmo resigns
Washington — Embattled veterans administrator Robert
Nimmo resigned yesterday just ahead of the scheduled publica
tion this month of a Government Accounting Office report that
is expected to criticize his use of a chartered military aircraft,
first-class air travel and a personal chauffeur in violation of the
law.
A spokesman for Nimmo, who was not available for comment
late yesterday, said the Veterans Administration chief had not
seen the report. But a source close to the GAO probe said that
Frank Sato, the inspector general for the VA, had been fully
briefed on its contents last Thursday.
White House counselor Edwin Meese said Nimmo called him
the same day to tell him of his plans for resignation. Meese said
Nimmo mentioned the forthcoming GAO report, but contended
that it was not "the controlling factor" in Nimmo's decision.
"This was totally self-initiated by Bob," Meese said of Nim
mo's action. "He felt that he had done as much as he could for
the president and that it was time to step down."
Nimmo, a 60-vear-old World War !l veteran who has been un
der constant fire from Vietnam veterans for purported in
sensitivitv to their problems, told The Associated Press earlier
yesterday that his finances were the chief reason for quitting and
that "compelling personal reasons" dictated his return to Cali
fornia.
Nimmo's government financial disclosure statement shows
that he and his wife, Pat, own property valued at more than
$750,000.
The resignation of Nimmo closes what has been a painful
chapter for the Reagan administration in its dealings with veter
ans.
Nimmo has been a constant target of Vietnam veterans on
substantive issues, such as the cutback of funding for veterans
counseling centers, and on symbolic ones, such as his refusal to
allow Vietnam veterans to attend groundbreaking ceremonies
for the Vietnam Veterans Memorial.
On one occasion he compared the effects of the defoliation
Agent Orange to the effects of "teen-age acne."
Two Vietnam veterans resigned successively as deputy admin
istrators because of their differences with Nimmo.
R. Jack Powell, executive director of the Paralyzed Veterans of
America and a paralyzed Green Beret veteran of the Vietnam
war, said that at a luncheon meeting last winter with seven lead
ers of veterans groups, including blind, disabled and paralyzed
veterans, Nimmo referred to military service as "mere inconve
nience."
Powell said this remark was typical of a series of "unfortunate
remarks" made by Nimmo during his tenure.
Bill seriously threatens Solidarity
Warsaw, Poland — A new law on trade unions expected to be
passed by the Polish Parliament Saturday will dissolve the inde
pendent trade union Solidarity, and ensure that, though nomi
nally self-governing, any new unions will be virtually powerless.
A draft copy of the 20-page bill was obtained by the Los An
geles Times. It discloses that the new law. will rule out use of the
name Solidarity and bar any new national unions until 1984.
It will also sharply restrict the right to strike, and will give the
authorities power to eliminate any union they say is guilty of car
rying out "activities contrary to the interest of the People's Re
public of Poland."
The draft bill has already cleared two parliamentary commit
tees. It is considered certain to be approved by Poland's rubber
stamp legislature. The Sejm (Parliament) is scheduled to open a
two-day session Friday.
Underground Solidarity leaders have pledged in the past that
they would order a nationwide general strike if the government
tried to dissolve the union. But there is serious question among
most observers here whether they can make good on that threat.
However, localized strikes and street demonstrations against
the action are considered a distinct possibility. Poland's Roman
Catholic primate, Archbishop Jozef Glemp, told a group of visit
ing American editorial writers late last week that "major dis
turbances can be expected" if Solidarity is banned.
Glemp, who was scheduled to visit Rome and the United
States later this month, canceled the trip yesterday because of
this latest development, according to church sources.
The church has consistently called for restoration of Solidar
ity, which has been suspended by the government. Polish bishops
reportedly stressed that demand in a strongly worded message to
the government last month.
Party and government officials have indicated that they are
not certain how strong the reaction to formal dissolution of Soli
darity will be. But they have made clear that they are more con
cerned about strikes than street demonstrations.
Navy agrees to buy F-18 fighters
Washington — The Navy and McDonnell Douglas Corp. an
nounced agreement yesterday on a bitterly disputed $1.14 billion
contract to produce F-18 fighter planes.
Secretary of the Navy John Lehman threatened to cancel out
right the entire $40 billion F-18 program last month unless
McDonnell Douglas and its subcontractors significantly low
ered the price of each aircraft from about $24 million.
Under the one-year, fixed-price contract announced yester
day, Lehman said, the Navy will pay $18.1 million for each air
craft. Adding in the cost of General Electric-built engines, the
cost of each F-18 will be $22.5 million.

Ironically, the agreement that saved the program requires
McDonnell Douglas and its subcontractors to tighten produc
tion procedures and achieve other economies that may result in
their employing fewer workers for the F-18 project than had been
anticipated.
In order to reach the lower price demanded by the Navy, the
contractors will need to "do things more efficiently with fewer
people," McDonnell Douglas Chairman Sanford McDonnell
said at a press conference.
McDonnell indicated that the price reduction had been ham
mered out ip negotiations between McDonnell Douglas and its
subcontractors.
"Meeting the Navy's objections was not easy," McDonnell
said. "I'm glad to have the negotiations behind us."
Under the terms of the new contract, McDonnell Douglas will
deliver the sophisticated twin-tail jets at the same unit price at
which it sold II F-18s to the Navy last year.
But McDonnell Douglas had estimated that this year the same
aircraft, with the cost of new design changes and inflation added
in, would cost about $24 million each.
In effect, the contractors "swallowed" the increased costs of
inflation and the design changes, McDonnell said.
He refused to divulge how much profit his company would
make on the contract, saying it was long-standing policy not to
disclose such information. But he said that "with an ex
traordinary effort, we still are going to make reasonable earn
ings."
Unlike many Pentagon contracts that allow contractors some
cost overrun, the F-18 contract is fixed, with no allowances made
for unforeseen contractor expenses.
"There is no cost overrun possibility in this thing," Lehman
said. However, the one-year contract allows the possibility of a
higher price for the aircraft to be negotiated next year.
The Navy plans to buy about 1377 F-18s, with final deliveries
to be made early in the 19905.
Supreme Court looks into new cases
Washington — The Supreme Court, opening its 1982 term,
yesterday agreed to rule on the constitutionality of Minnesota's
program of state income tax deductions for private and parochi
al school tuition, a case targeted by civil liberties lawyers as a test
of the Reagan administration's own national tuition tax credit
proposal.
The court also said it would take up cases involving the liabil
ity of cities for medical expenses of people injured by police, the
authority of the federal government to recover grant money mis
spent bv the states and the constitutionality of tax exemptions for
veterans organizations that lobby Congress.
In other actions among the hundreds yesterday, the court:
— Said it would allow the Reagan administration to partici
pate in the oral arguments in defense of one of the most con
troversial abortion laws in years: Akron's ordinance requiring,
among other things, that a woman wait 24 hours before becom
ing eligible for an abortion at any stage of pregnancy, and that a
doctor read her a statement declaring that the fetus is a human
life and describing its anatomical features in detail. The court's
decision was in doubt because the government is not a party to
the case, only a "friend of the court."
— Laid to final rest the ruling of a federal judge in Idaho last
year that allowed states to rescind ratification of the Equal
Rights Amendment. The same judge also ruled that Congress did
not have the right to extend the ratification deadline. The court,
without comment and without dissent, wiped out the case as
moot, apparently agreeing with the government's contention
that the lower court should have avoided the controversy entirely
until and unless the ERA were ratified.
— Declined to consider a Boston federal court ruling that
white teachers could be laid off before black teachers with less
seniority as a way of maintaining court-ordered racial balance
during layoffs. The case, watched closely by teachers' unions,
civil rights organizations and school districts under court or
dered desegregation plans, was Local 66, Boston Teachers
Union vs. Boston School Committee, et al.
— Let stand an appeals court decision from California allow
ing a college faculty member pursuing a sex discrimination com
plaint access to confidential evaluations used in the decision to
deny her tenure. The University of California had argued (in Re
gents of the University of California vs. Therese Ballet Lynn)
that this information had to remain privileged to maintain the
peer review system that is part of the tenure process in colleges
and universities.
Reagan maintains emphasis on inflation
Columbus, Ohio — President Reagan said yesterday that the
"main target" of his administration still must be controlling in
flation, despite a nagging recession and the highest unemploy
ment rate in 41 years.
He also told an estimated 3000 veterans that the nuclear weap
ons freeze movement is being "inspired not by sincere, honest
people who want peace, but by some who want the weakening of
America, and so are manipulating many honest and sincere peo
ple."
Kicking off a monthlong drive for Republican candidates,
who are being forced to defend his economic policies, Reagan
acknowledged that voters now are primarily concerned about
unemployment, contrasted with their overriding fear of inflation
when he took office.
The reason for the change, he noted, is that since his inaugura
tion, inflation has dropped to less than 6 percent from more than
12 percent. Unemployment, however, has risen from 7.4 percent
when he took office to 9.8 percent in August, and many experts
predict it will climb into double digits when September figures
are announced Friday. In Ohio, unemployment in August was
12.7 percent second highest in the nation.
But Reagan, speaking in a downtown hotel to several veterans'
organizations, said there is only one cause of unemployment; in
flation. "And that is why inflation must be the main target so
that we can reduce unemployment," he said.
Reagan explained his thesis by recalling that inflation rose

from 4.8 percent in 1976 to 18 percent at one point in 1980. The
prime interest rate "had to keep pace," he said, and climbed from
7 percent to 21.5 percent. This caused automobile and housing
sales to slump triggering layoffs in these and such related in
dustries as steel, rubber and construction.
"We have brought inflation down and interest rates are fol
lowing. We intend to stay on this course," Reagan said, echoing
an administration campaign theme now being sounded in Re
publican television commercials across the country.
Reagan said the choice for American voters on Nov. 2 is be
tween the Democratic Party, which "puts its faith in pipe
dreamers and margin scribblers in Washington,"and the GOP,
which "believes in the collective wisdom of the people and their
commitment to the American dream."
Kohl appoints German Cabinet
Bonn, West' Germany — Chancellor Helmut Kohl named a 17-
meinber Cabinet y esterday that reflects the wide range of views
in the three political parties that make up West Germany's new
center-right coalition government.
The new Cabinet is composed of nine other members of Kohl's
Christian Democratic Union, four from its Bavarian ally, the
Christian Social Union, and four from the Liberal Free Demo
cratic Party.
Kohl was named chancellor in last Friday's parliamentary
vote of no confidence that unseated former chancellor Helmut
Schmidt and brought down his Social Democrat Party minority
government. The governmental crisis was triggered last month
when the Free Democratic Party bolted from Schmidt's coalition
government in a controversy over economic and other matters
The new Cabinet was immediately installed in office in a brief
ceremonv in which Kohl praised Schmidt for his "patriotic
achievements for the fatherland."
Schmidt said that Kohl, who was 15 when World War II ended
in 1945, was the first member of the post war generation to be
come chancellor.
"This means you look at history differently from those of us
who fought and suffered," said Schmidt, who had served as an
enlisted man and an officer on both the Eastern and Western
fronts in the war. "This could mean new opportunities," he
added.
Kohl held his first cabinet meeting before he was to depart for
Paris for a meeting with French President Francois Mitterrand
to reassure him of continued close German cooperation.
Kohl's most significant cabinet appointments, political ana
lysts here said, were the selection of Christian Social Union right
winger Friedrich Zimmermann as interior minister, and Rainer
Barzel, one of the CSU's top leaders, as minister for inter Ger
man affairs.
The remaining appointments were considered routine. They
included the return of Free Democratic Party leader Hans-
Dietrich Genscher, 55. As vice chancellor and foreign minister,
the posts he held in the Schmidt coalition.
Shultz, Gromyko complete talks
New York — Secretary of State George Shultz met for
hours yesterday with Soviet Foreign Minister Andrei Gromyko
to complete an exhaustive exchange of views on issues dividing
the superpowers.
Closely following the script of last week, when the two spoke
for three hours and explored issues that have disrupted U.S.-So
viet relations for years, the session ended without any significant
agreement on any subject.
At the same time, a senior official told reporters after the meet
ing, "There were no polemics, no raised voices, no inflammatory
language. The talks were serious and businesslike."
i The question of a summit between President Reagan and Sovi
et President Leonid Brezhnev — a subject of speculation earlier
this year — did not even come up, either yesterday or at the
earlier meeting last Tuesday. No time was set for another meet
ing between Shultz and Gromyko.
The main unfinished business discussed this time was the Mid
east, a sore point in U.S.-Soviet relations that has been ag
gravated by the dominant American role in trying to ease the
Lebanon crisis while the Soviets, mostly on the sidelines, have
been reduced to polemics blaming Washington for every Israeli
military action.
The senior official, who briefed reporters on condition he not
be named, said Shultz and Gromyko discussed the Lebanon
crisis in detail, as well as Reagan's Sept. 1 Middle East peace in
itiative. He added that these detailed talks, while time-consum
ing, revealed no policy position on either side that could have
been a surprise to the other.
On one point only was there a glimmer of agreement, the of
ficial said. Both sides agreed that the Iran-Iraq war is a menace to
regional peace and should be ended. But there were no specific
ideas advanced on how to end the fighting there.
Rally reverses, stocks down
The stock market turned downward yesterday, abruptly re
versing its rally of late last week as hopes dimmed for further de
clines in interest rates.
The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials, off more than 11
points at its midsession low, closed with a 4.13 loss at 903.61.
Volume on the New York Stock Exchange slowed to 55.65
million shares from 65 million on Friday.
There were about four declines for every three stocks that rose
in price on the Big Board, and the exchange's composite index
dropped .24 to 69.77.
Today's weather
Fair today and tonight. Highs in the 60s to mid-70s. Overnight
lows in the 50s. Westerly winds 15 to 25 mph afternoon.
