Israel attacks in response to ambush
Jerusalem — Israeli jets attacked Syrian troops and missile concentrations
in the mountains east of Beirut yesterday, a day after the ambush of an Israeli
troop-carrying bus in which six soldiers were killed and 22 wounded. There
was no report of casualties in the air strike.
A Defense Ministry spokesman said jet fighter-bombers hit Syrian SAM-9
sites along the Beirut-Damascus highway, near the site of the ambush Sun
day.
No group has claimed responsibility for the ambush but Defense Ministry
officials here blame the Palestine Liberation Organization.
Witnesses in Lebanon said four jets attacked the troop and missile sites,
whiie four other planes flew cover.
The Israeli Defense Ministry said Syrian jets were airborne at the time but
did hot engage the Israeli planes. The defense spokesman added that several
surface-to-air missiles were fired, but scored no hits.
The air attack came shortly after an emergency meeting of the Israeli Cabi
net was held to determine the government's response to the ambush.
There was no comment from stern-faced ministers after the meeting, and
the military did not say the air strike was retaliation for the ambush. But
there was a cause-and-effect pattern: a guerrilla attack on Israeli forces fol
lowed by an Israeli air strike.
The Cabinet session also reported to have discussed the scheduled visit
here today of Morris Draper, deputy to U.S. special envoy Philip Habib,
with details of the American weekend diplomatic mission to Damascus. The
United States is attempting to devise a formula to the withdrawal of Israeli
and Syrian troops from Lebanon.
