# His reaction: 'I expected it'
## Sasway sentenced to 30 months 
### SID ATKINS Staff writer 
Benjamin Sasway, the nation's sec
ond convicted draft registration re
sister, was sentenced yesterday to two
and-pne-half years in a federal prison
camp in San Diego.
Sasway, 21, who has been in jail for
five weeks, was expected to be released
yesterday on $10,000 bail. The bail, plus
adherance to a special plan drawn up by
Saswav's attorney, Charles Burner, are
conditions for his freedom while he
awaits an appeal of his case. Federal
Judge Gordon Thompson of San Diego
approved the plan.
Sasway must hold a full-time job or
attend school while he awaits his ap
peal. In addition, he may not leave the
country and must report once a month
to a probation officer.
Burner said that he was satisfied with
the conditions of the plan that allows
Sasway to be released. "The interim
plan is pretty good. We got what we
wanted out of Judge Thompson in that.
But we're still going to appeal both the
sentence and the decision," he said.
Burner said that the deterrent effect
of the government's increased legal ac
tion against registers recently will be
minimal. "I got calls from shocked peo
ple around the nation this August when
he was refused bail. Still, if there's a les
son in this case, it's that the government
isn't interested in non-vocal resisters. If
anything, I think more people will resist
now and just remain quiet about it,"
Burner said.
U.S. Attorney Robert Rose, who
prosecuted the case, warned that it was
too early to judge the deterrent effects
of Saswav's sentence, which was one
half the maximum five year penalty.
"We're pleased with the sentence,"-
Rose said. "It's different from a normal
prison term in that the parole board will
have the right to terminate Saswav's
. sentence at any tnpe. They won Lhave
to wait for him to complete one third of
his term if they don't want to."
Sasway told The Associated Press,

"It was OK, I expected it. It could have
been worse."
Judge Thompson would not com
ment on the penalty he issued, but ac
cording to Rose, he feels that "all argu
ments for appeal of the case are frivo
lous."
On the Stanford campus, several reg
istration resisters said that they were
scared by the prison term issued, but
that it certainly would not force them to
register.
Will Barnes, a 22-year-old senior,
said, "I felt really emotional about Ben
Sasway. The thought of going to jail is
frightening. I can imagine what he has
been going through. I don't feel in
timidated though. This will not change
how I feel." Barnes said that he did not
register and has no plans to do so.

Another member of the Stanford
community who has not registered is
Steve Fuller, a 22-year-old graduate
student in German studies. "Of course
this scares me," Fuller said. "It scares
everyone in the movement. The govern
ment is sending Ben to prison
"ToT"somefKTng tney say ts not impor
tant." Fuller says that he hasn't re
considered his position in a long time,
though, and doesn't plan to "just be-

cause the government is starting to take
resisters more seriously."
When asked about the fairness of
Sasway's sentence, graduate student
Larry Ausubel, said "That's a longtime
to send someone to prison for just fol
low ing his conscience.
"If the United States did not have
anv political prisoners before, it does
now," Ausubel added.
Barnes, Fuller, Ausubel and other
members of Stanford Against Con
scription (SAC), will hold a candlelight
vigil tonight in honor of Sasway. Ac
cording to SAC member Paul Baer,
"the purpose of the vigil is to show the
people here who have refused the draft
that they are not alone. There is still a
strong community of people who are
not registering." Baer said that there
are 700,000 people or more nationwide
who have not registered.
Though the thought of going to jail
scares most youth of registration age,
members of SAC think the harsh ac
tions of the government could bring the
non-registers together. Dana Price, one
of three active female members in SAC,
noted, "If they massively increase the
amount of their indictments, it will in
crease the resistance. Look what hap
pened in San Diego â€” the people gelled
behind Ben Sasway."
In fact, Sasway's attorney Burner
presented the judge with 1000 letters
and a petition signed by 1100 people
urging leniency for Sasway. Burner had
hoped that the judge would impose a
penalty equal only to the time that
Sasway had already spent in jail: five
weeks.
Throughout his trial, Sasway insisted
that he was not a pacifist. He said that
he is opposed to registering for the draft
because the draft is subject to the
"capricious whim of government."
Sasway reportedly told the court
before his sentencing that he disagreed
with government' policies "which are
leading us to the brink of nuclear war."
He also said the decision to register for
the draft is a moral one.
