# Campus police patrolling congested areas
## Motorcycles now used to enforce bike rules 
### STEVE TROUSDALE Staff writer 
Due to the frequency of bicycle acci
dents in the Quad and other parts of
campus, the Stanford Police Depart
ment has begun using motorcycles to
patrol highly congested areas.
Police Capt. Raoul Neimeyer said
that because of problems in the Quad
with illegal motorcycles, the police mo
torcycles add a "new dimension in
being able to respond to places." He ex
pects they will be especially useful for
going from point to point in the Quad,
which is often hard, if not impossible,
for regular police vehicles.
John Harbaugh, an applied earth sci
ences professor here who is head of the
oicvcle safetv committee, says the prob
lems in the Quad result from "un
authorized power vehicles ridden at
substantial speeds." His committee
made several suggestions this vear, in
cluding the idea for the new bike lanes,
because of the concern expressed by
various members of the Stanford com
munity. To illustrate this concern.

Harbaugh described a petition sub
mitted bv members of both the art and
physics departments that was signed by
more than 900 students, faculty and
staff asking the University to do some-

thing about the bike problem.
The petition started because of the
congestion near the art department and
other parts of campus, explained Joan
Coppock, the department's adminis
trative manager. She said that concern
for the problem was increased by an ac
cident in which one graduate student

was seriously injured and by another in
cident in which one staff member was
jostled. She said the petition was signed
bv many departments on campus, in
cluding Tresidder Union, the Law
School and the Medical School.
"It was impossible to walk safely on
campus because bicyclists were riding
so inconsiderately and so fast that pe
destrians didn't seem to have a chance,"
Coppock said.
Although his committee did not spe
cifically recommend the use of motor
cycles bv the police, Harbaugh did say
that he "heartily approved" of this
method of enforcement because, he
said, the motorcycles were needed to
chase fast-moving bikes and motor
cycles, especially those in vehicle ex
clusion areas.
Neimever called the motorcycle used
"basicallv a dirt bike." He said mopeds
would not hold up under the strains of
being used in off-road areas.
The Stanford Police bought two mo
torcvlces and trained three officers to
use them, according to Police Chief

Marvin Herrington. He also said that
the bikes were primarily used in the
davtime, hut that they were sometimes
used for special events at night.
Another Stanford program has also
received new equipment this year. The
SURE escort service has added a golf
cart which will be used for four weeks
on an experimental basis as a shuttle
service, according to SURE Director
Andy Cargile. The cart will make stops
every hour on the hour from 8 p.m. to
11 p.m. at the courtyard between Meyer
and Green Libraries, and every other
half hour at Tresidder Union on the
White Plaza side. The shuttle will pick
up the first three female students at
these stops and take them anywhere on
campus and then return to the next stop
and pick up more people. However,
only SURE's bike escorts will be avail
able for off-campus escort duty.
Cargile also added that SURE in
tends to use the golf cart on Friday and
Saturday nights and that it will be the
onlv service that SURE will provide on
these nights.
