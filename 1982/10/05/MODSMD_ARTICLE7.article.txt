## Domestic violence not just in 'real' world 
### KAREN SPRINGEN 
Whether it's strikes or domestic violence,
the University is not isolated from problems
that hit the outside world.
Domestic violence does occur here.
"There's no barrier around the Silicon Val
ley," said a Rape Crisis Center volunteer who
wished to remain anonymous.
Domestic violence affects men, women and
children, and has no socio-economic barriers.
In fact, a studv completed seven years ago
found physical abuse more prevalent in fami
lies whose members had graduated from high
school and college than in families with little
or no high school education, according to
Anne Wuri, community educator at the Mid-
Peninsula Support Network, which serves
domestic violence victims in Santa Clara
county.
Because it is a sensitive issue, statistics and
information on domestic violence are often
scarce. Rape and crisis centers may not col;
lect data to avoid subpoena. Victims them
selves tend to disappear.
Some figures are available, however. As
semblyman Bvron Sher (D-Palo Alto) has
said that 3.8 million cases of domestic vio
lence went on record in the United States in
1981.
And a recent survey indicated that one out
of five people has been involved in a violent
dating relationship, said Wuri. The center
does receive calls from Stanford, she added.
Claudia Hezeol, director of the Mid-Penin
sula Support Network, said the majority of
domestic violence victims neither get the po
lice involved nor get medical assistance.
"Those institutions have not been very sym
pathetic to the problem," she said.
Wuri said only one battering out of 100
comes to the attention of the police. Un
surprisingly, Stanford Police Detective
Kathv Miller said she does not recall any re
ports from battered women in two years here.
Victims suffer feelings of guilt and shame,
said Hezeol. "They don't want to get him (the
abuser) in trouble."

According to Melinda Alves, clinical nurs
ing coordinator at the Stanford emergency
room, not manv admit they have been bat
tered. "A lot of them won't just come in and
say, 'I've been battered,' " she said. For ex
ample, patients may say they have fallen or
tripped.
Emergency room procedures call for the
woman to fill out a violent injury report,
though she is not required to press charges. If
the woman admits she was battered, said
Alves, emergency room personnel fill out a
iorm and notify the police jurisdiction.
Alves said, "You have to believe your pa
tient." But when nurses suspect that a patient
is a victim of domestic violence, they notify
her of availableoptions. They give'victims a
card with the names and numbers of centers,
shelters and support groups. Social workers
can arrange one night in a Palo Alto hotel if
regular shelters are filled.
The decision to seek help is up to the indi
vidual patient, said Alves, "but we highly rec
ommend that thev seek some help."
Social worker Mary Jean Barry, now at the
obstetrics and gynecology clinic, said, "It is a
minority that actually go to shelters." She
said many women drop charges or refuse
shelters. Battering is often a recurring prob
lem, she added, in which one partner does not
want to leave the other person. Problems
arise from "feeling like a victim so long," she
said.
Men may also be the victims. But Alves
said most men are reluctant to admit they are
being beaten bv their wives.

Help centers include the Mid-Peninsula
Support Center (964-6503), geared toward
battered women and their families; Brandon
House, an emergency shelter in San Jose
(408-258-6146); La Casa de las Madres, a ref
uge for women and children (585-2844); and
La Casa de San Mateo (342-0850).
The Santa Clara County Victim Witness
Assistance Program (295-2656) helps all types

of crime victims make claims and offers an ef
fective compensation program.
The Victim Witness Assistance Program
helps at the time of the crime and after the
crime. The program helps victims file for state
victim crime assistance (up to $23,000) and
get through court.
Joe Yomtov, director of the center, said the
countv-wide, private, 24-hour service re
solves all emergency needs. He said assault is
the number one crime.
"The cross-section of victims is exactly the
cross-section of the population," he said.
Thus young adults, representing the largest
group in the county, are the most common
victims.
Yomtov said many students choose not to
report crimes because they lack trust in the
system. He also cited the stigma of public tes
timony.
Victims tend to blame themselves rather
than the circumstances, he said. They may
think, "This always happens to me. I really
am unlucky," or, "I don't want to relive the
ordeal."
Recent legislation, effective Jan. 1, 1983,
will help funding of shelters, terms of child
custody and length of restraining orders.
Presently, general harassment restraining or
ders are effective for up to three years while
domestic violence orders last 90 days.

Domestic violence may involve rape, an
other crime of assault which occurs here.
A volunteer at the Rape Crisis Center (493-
RAPE), who wished to remain anonymous,
said the center receives 40 to 45 calls per
month. About five to 10 calls are from males
and about 25 are crisis calls, she said.
Rape victims are generally referred to the
emergency room at Stanford.
The volunteer said the center does not keep
statistics or records for two reasons: they
not concerned with statistics and they do
want to be subpoenaed. "We're there for â€¢
tims," she said, "not statistics."

Founded in 1978, it is one of three counseling centers in Santa Clara County.
