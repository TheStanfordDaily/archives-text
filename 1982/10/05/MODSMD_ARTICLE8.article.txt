# Long-haired days of 1960s coming to a close: short hair takes over in So Cal
## 
### Los Angeles Times 
Balboa, Calif. — He breezed through the
barbershop door, wasting no time in telling
the barber what he wanted done with his
shoulder-length hair.
"I want a skin head," said 12-year-old
Vince Ceci, settling into the barber chair
here in Balboa. "Well, not too short,
though."
"What about a half inch?" asked barber
Wayne Moses.
"Yeah," agreed the boy.
Moses draped a red cloth around the boy,
revved up his clippers and went to work,
Ceci's long brown hair cascading to the
floor. He did not even wince.
It was bound to happen sooner of later: be
it a buzz, a crop, a crew cut or a flattop, short
hair on men — really short hair — is making
a comeback.
After nearly two decades, Southern Cali
fornia barbers are beginning to witness a re
turn to the glory days of the 19505, a time
when men wore their hair short enough for
their scalps to get sunburned in the summer.
Remember astronaut John Glenn's close
cropped head, quarterback Johnny Unitas'
flattop or George Gobel's crew cut?
It has been only in the last three months
that many barbers have noticed the demand
for crew cuts and flattops. And like the long
hair craze of the '60s, it is the young who are
on the cutting edged of the short-hair trend.

Veteran barber Evelyn Johnson now aver
ages about 12 crew cuts and flattops a week
and could not be happier: "I've put up with
15 years of this long hair, this awful-looking
stuff."
No less an arbiter of men's fashion than
Gentlemen's Quarterly, which featured
"Fall's New Shorter Haircut" in its August
issue, acknowledges that "currently, the
widespread influence of the '50s and the mil
itary is bringing service-inspired changes - to
the cut of civilians' hair."
Vidal Sassoon's Salon in Beverly Hills
does an updated variation of the flattop —
about one inch on top and longer in the back
and sides than a true '50$ flattop — but gen
eral manager David McCann sees a future
for the closer-cropped original.
"I think in six months you'll be seeing
more people wearing that look," he said. "It
takes time for everyone to accept what is new
in fashion."
For now, it looks as though the neighbor
hood barbers are the avant-garde.
"I have a lot of people coming in getting
short haircuts," said Frank Brincho of
Frank's Barber Shop in Orange, Calif.
"Kids come in and say, 'Hdw about a
butch?' I say, 'Are you sure you want a
butch?' It's getting back to the old times
again." .
. "I'm glad to see it come back," said

barber John Hamm, who cut four flattops
and innumerable crew cuts in the last month.
"The barbers around here I've talked to all
say they're experiencing the same thins."
Barbers say the close-cropped trend began
first with high school students, some saying
they wanted their hair short for football and
other sports. But now even five- and six
year-old boys are asking for butches and
crew cuts.
"Most of them say they want it cut be
cause other guys are doing it, it's the 'in'
thing now and that it's more comfortable,"
says Wayne Moses. "I think a lot of them
want to try it in the summer to make sure
that's what they want before they go buck to
school."
Then there are the rockabilly fans, whose
passion for the '50s-style blend of country
and rhythm and blues music extends to the
era's clothes and hair styles, particularly the
flattop.
"It's a very heavy trend right at the mo
ment," said Seth Myers, instructor at
Rosston Schools of Men's Hair Design in
Anaheim, Calif. "It initially started out with
new wave, then punk rock and now it's
spreading to high school campuses."
Myers first began noticing the short hair
cuts last November, he said, "but it was
spotty. Then when summer hit in June and
school was out, everyone got on it."

In fact, he said, 30 percent of the barber
college's customers now ask for the flattops
and crew cuts. A few years ago, "you
couldn't pay anybody to take a crew cut or a
flattop."
Myers pointed out that hair styles, like tie
widths and hemlines, are cyclical.
"There's really nothing new in the field of
hair," he said. "This group of youngsters
think they've got something new and excit
ing. The time has come to cycle back."
Seth Myers said the barber college never
gave up teaching its students how to cut flat
tops and crew cuts. The problem was, he
said, finding customers for the students to
PGftctjce on. ,
"The only ones we had would be an older
person who had a crew cut and everybody
would gang around to see what it looked
like," he said. "All you had were carryovers
from the war."
Most barbers, in fact, have kept their
short-haircutting skills honed with a handful
of regular customers, usually World War II
veterans who refused to succumb to long
hair.
Perhaps the crew cut's best friend during
the long-haired days of the '60s and '70s is
comedian George Gobel.
Like millions of American men during
World War 11, Gobel had his hair shorn
courtesy of Uncle Sam: "Right up the side

and straight across the top — zip, zip, zip,"
he recalled.
Once out of aviation cadet school, Gobel
said, "I just kept the crew cut but started let
ting it grow on the sides (corners) so I didn't
look like a skinned onion."
When the war ended, Gobel recalled,
"some (Gls) couldn't wait to get out and
grow their hair; others felt, 'What the hell,
this is easy to keep, so I'll keep it.' "
Gobel kept it, and by the '60s his crew cut
had become so much a part of him that
neither he nor his audiences could imagine
him looking any other way.
"When Garry Moore let his hair grow he
the way you were, said Gobel. "They were
nice putdowns. I just figured maybe I'd go
through the same thing."
Barber Evelyn Johnson, who has tapered
many a head of hair, said she always knew
short hair would return — even while she
watched nearly a dozen nearby barbershops
go out of business in the '60s.
"I've lived through it all to see it and I'm
glad I have; it's really a pleasure," she
rhapsodized. "You should have been here
Tuesday: Four high school boys came in and
wanted flattops. One had really long, flow
ing blond hair, and when I got through cut
ting his hair he looked so handsome."

new wave, then punk rock and now it's
spreading to high school campuses."
Myers first began noticing the short hair
cuts last November, he said, "but it was
spotty. Then when summer hit in June and
school was out, everyone got on it."

In fact, he said, 30 percent of the barber
college's customers now ask for the flattops
and crew cuts. A few years ago, "you
couldn't pay anybody to take a crew cut or a
flattop."
Myers pointed out that hair styles, like tie
widths and hemlines, are cyclical.
"There's really nothing new in the field of
hair," he said. "This group of youngsters
think they've got something new and excit
ing. The time has come to cycle back."
Seth Myers said the barber college never
gave up teaching its students how to cut flat
tops and crew cuts. The problem was, he
said, finding customers for the students to
PGftctjce on. ,
"The only ones we had would be an older
person who had a crew cut and everybody
would gang around to see what it looked
like," he said. "All you had were carryovers
from the war."
Most barbers, in fact, have kept their
short-haircutting skills honed with a handful
of regular customers, usually World War II
veterans who refused to succumb to long
hair.
Perhaps the crew cut's best friend during
the long-haired days of the '60s and '70s is
comedian George Gobel.
Like millions of American men during
World War 11, Gobel had his hair shorn
courtesy of Uncle Sam: "Right up the side

and straight across the top — zip, zip, zip,"
he recalled.
Once out of aviation cadet school, Gobel
said, "I just kept the crew cut but started let
ting it grow on the sides (corners) so I didn't
look like a skinned onion."
When the war ended, Gobel recalled,
"some (Gls) couldn't wait to get out and
grow their hair; others felt, 'What the hell,
this is easy to keep, so I'll keep it.' "
Gobel kept it, and by the '60s his crew cut
had become so much a part of him that
neither he nor his audiences could imagine
him looking any other way.
"When Garry Moore let his hair grow he
the way you were, said Gobel. "They were
nice putdowns. I just figured maybe I'd go
through the same thing."
Barber Evelyn Johnson, who has tapered
many a head of hair, said she always knew
short hair would return — even while she
watched nearly a dozen nearby barbershops
go out of business in the '60s.
"I've lived through it all to see it and I'm
glad I have; it's really a pleasure," she
rhapsodized. "You should have been here
Tuesday: Four high school boys came in and
wanted flattops. One had really long, flow
ing blond hair, and when I got through cut
ting his hair he looked so handsome."
Balboa, Calif. — He breezed through the
barbershop door, wasting no time in telling
the barber what he wanted done with his
shoulder-length hair.
"I want a skin head," said 12-year-old
Vince Ceci, settling into the barber chair
here in Balboa. "Well, not too short,
though."
"What about a half inch?" asked barber
Wayne Moses.
"Yeah," agreed the boy.
Moses draped a red cloth around the boy,
revved up his clippers and went to work,
Ceci's long brown hair cascading to the
floor. He did not even wince.
It was bound to happen sooner of later: be
it a buzz, a crop, a crew cut or a flattop, short
hair on men — really short hair — is making
a comeback.
After nearly two decades, Southern Cali
fornia barbers are beginning to witness a re
turn to the glory days of the 19505, a time
when men wore their hair short enough for
their scalps to get sunburned in the summer.
Remember astronaut John Glenn's close
cropped head, quarterback Johnny Unitas'
flattop or George Gobel's crew cut?
It has been only in the last three months
that many barbers have noticed the demand
for crew cuts and flattops. And like the long
hair craze of the '60s, it is the young who are
on the cutting edged of the short-hair trend.

Veteran barber Evelyn Johnson now aver
ages about 12 crew cuts and flattops a week
and could not be happier: "I've put up with
15 years of this long hair, this awful-looking
stuff."
No less an arbiter of men's fashion than
Gentlemen's Quarterly, which featured
"Fall's New Shorter Haircut" in its August
issue, acknowledges that "currently, the
widespread influence of the '50s and the mil
itary is bringing service-inspired changes - to
the cut of civilians' hair."
Vidal Sassoon's Salon in Beverly Hills
does an updated variation of the flattop —
about one inch on top and longer in the back
and sides than a true '50$ flattop — but gen
eral manager David McCann sees a future
for the closer-cropped original.
"I think in six months you'll be seeing
more people wearing that look," he said. "It
takes time for everyone to accept what is new
in fashion."
For now, it looks as though the neighbor
hood barbers are the avant-garde.
"I have a lot of people coming in getting
short haircuts," said Frank Brincho of
Frank's Barber Shop in Orange, Calif.
"Kids come in and say, 'Hdw about a
butch?' I say, 'Are you sure you want a
butch?' It's getting back to the old times
again." .
. "I'm glad to see it come back," said

barber John Hamm, who cut four flattops
and innumerable crew cuts in the last month.
"The barbers around here I've talked to all
say they're experiencing the same thins."
Barbers say the close-cropped trend began
first with high school students, some saying
they wanted their hair short for football and
other sports. But now even five- and six
year-old boys are asking for butches and
crew cuts.
"Most of them say they want it cut be
cause other guys are doing it, it's the 'in'
thing now and that it's more comfortable,"
says Wayne Moses. "I think a lot of them
want to try it in the summer to make sure
that's what they want before they go buck to
school."
Then there are the rockabilly fans, whose
passion for the '50s-style blend of country
and rhythm and blues music extends to the
era's clothes and hair styles, particularly the
flattop.
"It's a very heavy trend right at the mo
ment," said Seth Myers, instructor at
