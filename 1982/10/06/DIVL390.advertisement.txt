368 CASTRO ST., MOUNTAIN VIEW
PIZZA OF THE STARS j
Bob Anderson, Mt. View, Calif. "During the spring when our team is p.actlc
ing for the corporate Cup Relays we practice together twice a week and always
hit a pizza parlor afterwards Right in Runner World 1 shome town there are two
exceptional pizza places. One is Boswell's and the other is Frankle, Johnny <
and Luigi Too Boswell's Is a quiet sedate place with excellent pizza. Each one
is a work of art. The sides are built up like the walls of a fortress and the middle
does not droop so that all the toppings slide to the middle. The crust (the part
people usually leave lying on the plate) tastes like those softpretzel* they sell '
on Manhatten 's streets. Frankie johnny and Lugi Too is a madhouse You have
to get Into line to get in and you have to wait for maybe a half hour. It'* soft of
macho pizza, because it takes a very, very hungry person to do damage to H.
