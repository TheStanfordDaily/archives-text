# Marguerite system changes course as patronage drops
## 
### MIKE HALE Senior staff writer 
The Marguerite-SP Shuttle transit system recorded a 45
percent drop in its ridership last year when its service hours
were reduced by 43 percent, according to a recently com
pleted survey of the campus transit system.
The survey, conducted by a private firm, is part of a report
from the University Committee on Parking and Transporta
tion (CPT) which was presented to University President
Donald Kennedy yesterday.
The committee's report included several suggested rout
ing changes for the Marguerite, one of which went into effect
last week. In that change two-way service was reinstated
along Serra Street between the Medical Center and Escon
dido Village, while the "Tresidder loop" was eliminated and
a shorter, one-way loop around Wilbur Hall and the Cowell
Student Health Center was put in its place.
Another important find of the survey was that only 3 per
cent of the campus community uses the service more than
once a week.
Last year, Marguerite service was made one-way along a
campus-loop route which previously had two-way service.
This reduction in service hoar* led to a 32 percent drop in
operating costs from the year before (from 5250,000 to
SI 19,400) but also cost the Marguerite an estimated 45 per
cent of its riders (from 334,500 in 1980-81 to an estimated
185,000 last year).
During the same period, ridership on the SP Shuttle be
tween the Palo Alto train ftation and the Quad dropped only
I percent. The survey called the one-way loop a "significant
deterrent" to ridership, particularly for intra-campus trips.
The new route provides for Marguerite service at the same
budget level as last year. According to Robin Hamill, hous

ing program director for the ths vice president for business
and finance's office, this year's Marguerite budget is set at
$198,097. Of this, 71.5 percent will come from University
parking sticker fees, 5 percent from Stanford Shopping Cen
ter levies and the balance from the University's general fund.
Physics Prof. Mason Yearian, chairman of the CPT, em
phasized that budget levels are set for this academic year
only, and must be reviewed every year by the University. He
said that while costs are "continuously monitored," he for
sees no budgetary problems for the bus service in the near
future. The CPT is committed to "some kind of inter-transit
sysi .n on campus," he said.
The survey found that as operated last year, the system
was cost-effective compared to similar systems elsewhere,
and that only minor improvements in coverage and ridership
could be made without "substantially higher expenditure."
It also concluded that a takeover of transit services by the
University, while it would give the University more control
over operations, would not guarantee cost savings. The bus
service is currently operated by Peninsula Charters, Inc.
Two other CPT recommendations designed to increase
Marguerite ridership and decrease campus auto use will
probably not be implemented due to budgetary limitations,
said Ha mi 11. According to Yearian, the committee suggested
extending service along Serra Street to HI Camino at the
Escondido Village end of the route, to improve connections
with Santa Clara County Transit buses.
Increasing service to the Stanford Shopping Center so that
connections could be made with Southern Pacific commuter
trains and SamTrans buses was another recommendation
made by the survey. Hamill said extending service to the
Serra-El Camino intersection would require building a turn-

as ridership declines and routes are curtailed.
