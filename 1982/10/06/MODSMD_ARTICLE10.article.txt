## Honor Code deserves student respect 
### 
A few years ago an Eastern school, in
an uncharacteristic display of en
lightened thinking, placed in each
classroom a sign imploring students to
follow the school's honor code. Within
months, nearly all of the signs were
either stolen or hopelessly mangled.
Perhaps this display of student opinion
is an isolated instance, but it does raise a
few important questions for our own
community. What are student attitudes
towards Stanford's Honor Code? How
well does the code operate? Should
changes be made to adapt the Honor
Code to an increasingly competitive
University environment?
The statement that students "will not
give or receive aid in examinations" is
perhaps the best understood and most
respected aspect of the Honor Code.
Despite the competitive environment ol
the University, I would venture to say
that the Honor Code is remarkably suc
cessful in this respect, and that cheating
on examinations is a very uncommon
occurrence.
I'm sure, however, that there are stu
dents who snicker quietly to themselves
as their professor reluctantly walks out
the door. In fact, with such a creative
student body, I imagine some methods
of cheating here have been no less than
fascinating. Nonetheless, such behavior
is certainly not condoned by the student
population, nor will it be in the near
future by all appearances.
While the prohibition on exam cheat
ing is well-heeded, it is my experience
that other aspects of the Honor Code
are in serious trouble. Look very
carefully at the bottom of your blue

book on your next exam. You'll notice
that there is more to the Honor Code
than just examination rules.
Out-of-class assignments are a case in
point. In many classes, especially in en
gineering and the sciences, problem sets
are counted towards the final grade.
Often students will work these prolv
lems together, which is usually con
doned or even encouraged by the pro
fessor. Fine. All too often, however, a
student will find a friend and copy the
material right from the paper with no
more effort than pushing a pencil. Re
place the word "copy" with
"plagiarize" and you begin to under
stand why this is a flagrant violation of
the Honor Code â€” a violation that
both the copier and his friend share to
gether.
That is merely one example of the in
consistent enforcement of the Honor
Code. Another concern is (what else?)
test-taking, specifically the surrender
ing of tests when the allotted time has
expired or, more accurately, the refusal
to surrender tests. It is not unheard of in
some classes for test to be out a full 10
minutes after fime has been called, a
time advantage of 15 percent or more.
This is an unfair burden on the cons
cientious student, especially when deal
ing with a curve, where extra points for
some students results in lower grades
for others.
Why are these violations so com
monplace when students are in basic
agreement with the principle of the
Honor Code? In my opinion, the Honor
Code is well-written and concise, and
not difficult to understand. The fault

lies with students: all of us. It is one
thing to pay lip service to honor and
ideals. It is quite another to take re
sponsibility to uphold those ideals.
To be more specific, Stanford stu
dents themselves must take responsi
bility for the enforcement of the Honor
Code. In fact, in accepting the code, stu
dents pledge to "do their share and take
an active part in seeing to it that others
as well as themselves uphold the spirit
and letter of the Honor Code."
I'm not advocating a rigid West
Point-style order, or a system of un
signed notes to professors. Often a vio
lation can be corrected by politely
pointing out to an individual that he or
she is in violation. I am advocating a
system in which students themselves
create a spirit, indeed, an atmosphere,
where people can adhere to the Honor
Code without putting themselves at a
disadvantage, however slight, by doing
so. A student should be able to refuse a
request to have his problem set
plagiarised without feeling guilty about
letting down a friend. A professor
should be able to receive tests within a
given time period, or if not, should have
the courage to refuse late tests as a
courtesy to conscientious students.
Above all, everyone should at least be
able to point out to someone that he or
she is in violation of the Honor Code.
The Honor Code was created by stu
dents in the interests of students, and its
success depends upon the responsibility
of students. Many feel the Honor Code
is worth preserving. Do you?
