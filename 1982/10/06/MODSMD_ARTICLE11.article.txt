## Diversity not seriously encouraged by Residential Education 
### 
My eye was caught by a recent
statement by James Lyons, dean of stu
dent affairs. He is reported to have said
that "few universities so deliberately try
and so obviously succeed in having a
student body as diverse as at Stanford.
There is an underlying assumption here
that students learn and grow better if
they learn about, confront and come to
terms with social, religious and ethical
differences that abound in our society.
(These) will show up repeatedly in the
informal curriculum of residential life
at Stanford."
The ideal of diversity is one I whole
heartedly endorse, but it is simply not
true that such diversity is seriously en
couraged as a universal principle in the
"residential life at Stanford." Perhaps
lip service is given to that ideal in the
"informal curriculum" of the houses,
but the structure of those houses
bespeaks a different, and antagonistic,
ideal.
First of all, we have the fraternity and
sorority system. Any university that
wanted students to "confront and come
to terms with" students of different
ethnic, religious and social groups
would never permit fratemites and
sororities to exist in their midst. To al
low any group of students the power of

saying to other students: "We accept
you in our midst but reject you" has not,
in my opinion, any place in an institu
tion that purports to disbelieve in so
cial, racial or religious discrimination.
The fraternities and sororities will no
doubt reply: "We used to discriminate
against Catholics, Jews, blacks, Asians,
poor kids and others, but that is all be
hind us; we now let all those people in
— when they meet our standards for ad
mission." But such an argument is spec
ious.
The power of "dinging," of rejection,
is still in their hands, and if discrimina
tion is not so gross today as it was yes
terday, it is still practiced and is still the
basis of the whole structure of these
private clubs. Blacks may now be ad
mitted, but what about the wimps and
ths nerds, the fat woman or short guy
with acne, the people who "don't fit in"
or wouldn't enhance the house's "im
age"? Discrimination goes on and on —
unless the principle of discrimination is
eliminated. That can be done by mak
ing fraternities and sororities subject to
the draw, just like any other living
group. Will that destroy them as
fraternities and sororities? If so. then
fraternities and sororities have no place
at Stanford. Will it alienate alumni who

contribute good money to Stanford?
Maybe so, but Harvard had the guts to
throw the clubs off campus, and to
educate their alumni to the possibility
that snobbery and exlusion were not the
noblest ideals of man. Stanford should
do as much.
The creation of the house system at
Harvard was the statement of a demo
cratic ideal — an ideal that tried to
make the university a melting pot, a lit
tle "universe." Of course that change in
structure did not make that ideal a reali
ty, but it did announce to students that
Harvard thought it good for all races,
creeds and colors to rub shoulders, live
together, talk together. That, in my
opinion, should be an inescapable con
dition in a university like Stanford. But,
some will argue, such mixing will lead
to conflicts. Maybe so, but such con
flicts would afford a realistic glimpse of
the human condition, and out of such
abrasion can arise friendships as well as
antagohisms. It is certainly better than
a state of semi-quarantine where the
student never has to cross a difficult cul
tural borderline.
Then what about the "ethnic houses"
where Chicanos, native Americans and
others have found isolated havens? I
think thev too should go, for the same

reasons. It seems to me that a "theme
house," a house organized around
some intellectual purpose — like Casa
Italiana or Maison Francaise or Ameri
can Studies House — has a reason for
being in a university, so long as mem
bership is determined by draw and evi
dence of some serious intellectual
purpose. But any house organized on
social or ethnic or religious lines that
takes unto itself the right to decide who
lives there is, in my opinion, simply il
legitimate on the campus.
Some years ago I was involved in an
attempt to establish a "house system"
at Stanford. We have, in operation, in
part of our community, an attempt to
put into practice the principle that
Lyons extolled; but in another part we
have allowed a system based on ex
clusion, discrimination, and cultural
withdrawal from the main community
of Stanford students. I have always dis
approved of this double standard.
Students should not put up with this
double standard any longer, and, what
is more critical, the Stanford adminis
tration should no longer tolerate this
unfair and immoral situation.
