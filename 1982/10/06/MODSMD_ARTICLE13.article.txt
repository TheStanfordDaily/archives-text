## Reagan policies aid Soviet cause 
### 
On their evening television news program "Vremiya"
(Time), Muscovites watched a Lebanese battle scene —
bombing and destruction. As the camera moved, corpses
could be seen amid the rubble of fallen buildings. A Soviet
voiced-over gave a description of the past day's fighting:
"part of the brutal Israeli invasion of Lebanon supported by
U.S. weapons and the foreign policy of American President
Reagan."
This scene and the announcer's theme were commonplace
on Soviet television this summer. The Soviet propaganda
and news network, fueled by the Reagan administration's re
fusal to condemn the Israeli attack, increases in military
shipments to Central America and sluggishness in the SALT
negotiations in Geneva ran rampant over the Soviets with a
portrayal of the United States as the worldwide perpetrator
of imperialism and war.
The situation for Americans living in Moscow was at best
uncomfortable, as Soviets sought answers to what they saw
each night. What could one say about this clear inconsisten
cy with our allegedly peace-loving and democratically
minded principles as a nation?
The knowledge that the Soviet government was at the
same time committing perhaps even worse offenses in Af
ghanistan was not comforting, if offering some fodder for
meeting Soviet questions of our national morality.
The point of mentioning these experiences is the effect
they had among Soviet friends in turning them to condemn
the United States and rally behind their own government,
despite their complaints with aspects of Soviet life. As seen in
conversations with Muscovites, the very system that the
Reagan administration is seeking to weaken by increased
U.S. militarism and Cold War rhetoric is being ironically
bolstered by these policies.
This self-defensive reaction of the Soviet people is under
standable given that each increment in U.S. "defensive"
weaponry is seen in Soviet perspective as a war-minded, of
fensive threat. Admittedly, the attitude of the Soviet popu
lation does not necessarily affect the behavior of the leader
ship. But, it is reasonable to assume that Soviet leaders are
moving further away from the trust necessary for SALT I
and the detente era.
Pood shortages are evident in the Soviet Union today, but
past experience shows that it will take more than consumer
hardship to prevent incremental government expenditure to
meet a perceived gap in military preparedness.
A program on Soviet television in July brought the hor
rors of the political violence in El Salvador home to Soviets
with the airing of clips from a Western-made film, "El
Salvador, a Second Vietnam?" The propaganda effect of the
program was strong, the same as would be true in the United
States if footage of alleged chemical warfare by Soviet troops
in Afghanistan were to be shown.
It is undeniable that while our present administration is
backing several belligerents, the Soviets support numer
ous unsavory regimes (with crimes unbeknownst to Soviet
citizens) and are also conducting the brutal Afghan war.
However, the goal of U.S. foreign policy is not (or should
not be) to match the evils of our opponents in the world
arena. Rather, we should have enough faith in the strength
of our own doctrines to seek informed policies that fit local
conditions while maintaining consistency with democracy
and basic human rights.
To the frustration of our allies in Europe, armed support

has become our calling card in Latin America. Under the
Reagan government, we have extended arms to any non
communist government regardless of reservations about hu
man rights. Justifiably, Reagan policies are meeting opposi
tion within NATO and contempt from within the bloc, leav
ing little to question about the meaning of "U.S. de
mocracy" beyond our borders. Sadly, these policies are
proving as ineffective as they are distasteful. As earlier in
Somoza's Nicaragua, U.S.-backed militarist and right-wing
elements in Latin America are working counter to the estab
lishment of domestic peace and political freedom.
Events recently in the Mideast and Central America have
shown the pitfalls of our open-ended arms policies. If the
United States is to condemn Soviet actions effectively (i.e. in
the eyes of our allies), we must ourselves pursue a credible
and consistent foreign policy. We must neither conduct nor
condone blind interventionism.
As T.S. Montgomery wrote in a column in New York
Times last week about her recent trip to Honduras,"... the
electorate's hopes have been derailed as the Reagan adminis
tration pursues a policy in Central America that is helping to
turn Hondura's democratic government into little more than
a facade for a new military dictatorship."
What does all this mean in terms of the Reagan adminis
tration's stated aim of stopping the spread of Soviet-style
communist regimes? Put simply, U.S. decision-makers have
not learned that U.S. guns do not simply breed democracy.
In the wrong hands, they merely serve to make more effec
tive dictatorships.
On a theoretical level, we might look at Reagan's expecta
tion that our authoritarian "friends" will someday become
democratic as we might the Soviets suddenly sending money
JSlid arms to the United States. According to their dialectic, ,
we will eventually become socialist. However, I doubt that
the Soviets put much faith in the time in between. Should w/d?.
On the superpower level, the Reagan administration's em
phasis on arms over ideology and on force over negotiation
is alienating Europeans while lending support to long-time
Soviet propaganda claims about U.S. intentions in world af
fairs. The Soviets have reason now to believe their govern
ment, rather than question that authority.
Given its ideology, the Reagan administration ("our"
government) should not be expected to abandon all arms
sales and interest in supporting democratic regimes abroad.
But one does expect that these policies be responsible ones
and not the flagrant squandering of money, human life and
U.S. reputation that we are seeing as an excuse for "Ameri
can policy" at present. In attempting to out-maneuver the
Soviet Union, have we forgotten that British imperialism
brought us to radicalism and revolution in 1776 to gain our
own independence?
One final point should be evident from this discussion.
Our country is weakest in this bi-polar world when the Sovi
et people and their government are firmly united in opposi
tion to our country and our system. On the other hand, the
strongest position we could hope to attain would be when
the Soviet people are not forced to the defensive by our poli
cies and rhetoric and realize that their own government is
simply making wind.

each night. What could one say about this clear inconsisten
cy with our allegedly peace-loving and democratically
minded principles as a nation?
The knowledge that the Soviet government was at the
same time committing perhaps even worse offenses in Af
ghanistan was not comforting, if offering some fodder for
meeting Soviet questions of our national morality.
The point of mentioning these experiences is the effect
they had among Soviet friends in turning them to condemn
the United States and rally behind their own government,
despite their complaints with aspects of Soviet life. As seen in
conversations with Muscovites, the very system that the
Reagan administration is seeking to weaken by increased
U.S. militarism and Cold War rhetoric is being ironically
bolstered by these policies.
This self-defensive reaction of the Soviet people is under
standable given that each increment in U.S. "defensive"
weaponry is seen in Soviet perspective as a war-minded, of
fensive threat. Admittedly, the attitude of the Soviet popu
lation does not necessarily affect the behavior of the leader
ship. But, it is reasonable to assume that Soviet leaders are
moving further away from the trust necessary for SALT I
and the detente era.
Pood shortages are evident in the Soviet Union today, but
past experience shows that it will take more than consumer
hardship to prevent incremental government expenditure to
meet a perceived gap in military preparedness.
A program on Soviet television in July brought the hor
rors of the political violence in El Salvador home to Soviets
with the airing of clips from a Western-made film, "El
Salvador, a Second Vietnam?" The propaganda effect of the
program was strong, the same as would be true in the United
States if footage of alleged chemical warfare by Soviet troops
in Afghanistan were to be shown.
It is undeniable that while our present administration is
backing several belligerents, the Soviets support numer
ous unsavory regimes (with crimes unbeknownst to Soviet
citizens) and are also conducting the brutal Afghan war.
However, the goal of U.S. foreign policy is not (or should
not be) to match the evils of our opponents in the world
arena. Rather, we should have enough faith in the strength
of our own doctrines to seek informed policies that fit local
conditions while maintaining consistency with democracy
and basic human rights.
To the frustration of our allies in Europe, armed support

has become our calling card in Latin America. Under the
Reagan government, we have extended arms to any non
communist government regardless of reservations about hu
man rights. Justifiably, Reagan policies are meeting opposi
tion within NATO and contempt from within the bloc, leav
ing little to question about the meaning of "U.S. de
mocracy" beyond our borders. Sadly, these policies are
proving as ineffective as they are distasteful. As earlier in
Somoza's Nicaragua, U.S.-backed militarist and right-wing
elements in Latin America are working counter to the estab
lishment of domestic peace and political freedom.
Events recently in the Mideast and Central America have
shown the pitfalls of our open-ended arms policies. If the
United States is to condemn Soviet actions effectively (i.e. in
the eyes of our allies), we must ourselves pursue a credible
and consistent foreign policy. We must neither conduct nor
condone blind interventionism.
As T.S. Montgomery wrote in a column in New York
Times last week about her recent trip to Honduras,"... the
electorate's hopes have been derailed as the Reagan adminis
tration pursues a policy in Central America that is helping to
turn Hondura's democratic government into little more than
a facade for a new military dictatorship."
What does all this mean in terms of the Reagan adminis
tration's stated aim of stopping the spread of Soviet-style
communist regimes? Put simply, U.S. decision-makers have
not learned that U.S. guns do not simply breed democracy.
In the wrong hands, they merely serve to make more effec
tive dictatorships.
On a theoretical level, we might look at Reagan's expecta
tion that our authoritarian "friends" will someday become
democratic as we might the Soviets suddenly sending money
JSlid arms to the United States. According to their dialectic, ,
we will eventually become socialist. However, I doubt that
the Soviets put much faith in the time in between. Should w/d?.
On the superpower level, the Reagan administration's em
phasis on arms over ideology and on force over negotiation
is alienating Europeans while lending support to long-time
Soviet propaganda claims about U.S. intentions in world af
fairs. The Soviets have reason now to believe their govern
ment, rather than question that authority.
Given its ideology, the Reagan administration ("our"
government) should not be expected to abandon all arms
sales and interest in supporting democratic regimes abroad.
But one does expect that these policies be responsible ones
and not the flagrant squandering of money, human life and
U.S. reputation that we are seeing as an excuse for "Ameri
can policy" at present. In attempting to out-maneuver the
Soviet Union, have we forgotten that British imperialism
brought us to radicalism and revolution in 1776 to gain our
own independence?
One final point should be evident from this discussion.
Our country is weakest in this bi-polar world when the Sovi
et people and their government are firmly united in opposi
tion to our country and our system. On the other hand, the
strongest position we could hope to attain would be when
the Soviet people are not forced to the defensive by our poli
cies and rhetoric and realize that their own government is
simply making wind.

On their evening television news program "Vremiya"
(Time), Muscovites watched a Lebanese battle scene —
bombing and destruction. As the camera moved, corpses
could be seen amid the rubble of fallen buildings. A Soviet
voiced-over gave a description of the past day's fighting:
"part of the brutal Israeli invasion of Lebanon supported by
U.S. weapons and the foreign policy of American President
Reagan."
This scene and the announcer's theme were commonplace
on Soviet television this summer. The Soviet propaganda
and news network, fueled by the Reagan administration's re
fusal to condemn the Israeli attack, increases in military
shipments to Central America and sluggishness in the SALT
negotiations in Geneva ran rampant over the Soviets with a
portrayal of the United States as the worldwide perpetrator
of imperialism and war.
