# South African draft resister sentenced to one year imprisonment
## 
### Washington Post 
PRETORIA, South Africa — The first
South African to refuse to be drafted into his
country's armed forces on the grounds that
they are fighting unjust wars was sentenced
to one year's imprisonment by a court
martial here yesterday.
William Paddock, a 31-year-old former
candidate for the priesthood in the Anglican
Church, told the court:"I cannot enter the
Defense Force because of the role it plays in
defending the structural violence of the
South African system."
It was half the sentence Paddock might
have received under a defense law that pre
cludes any form of conscientious objection.
Associates of Paddock and other ob
servers sympathetic to him were surprised by
the relative leniency of the sentence. They
speculated that it might reflect a desire by
military chiefs not to make a martyr of Pad
dock or highlight his case and a concern that
dvaft dodging could snowball among politi
cal opponents of the government's strict seg
regations! policies, called apartheid. The
media here are under some pressure not to
publicize the case.
The Defense Force's chief of personnel,
Lt. Gen R. F. Holtzhausen, expressed some
of this concern when he told a society of stu

dent counselors Sept. 30, there was a grow
ing movement against the draft on most
South African university campuses.
"There is increasing pressure on our
young men to dodge national service or to
question the underlying motive,"
Holtzhausen said.

Paddock argued that the
South African government
lacked legitimacy at home
too because the African
population, 70 percent of the
total, has no vote and is
excluded from consultation
on the country's
constitutional structure.

Under South Africa's conscription sys
tem, every white youth on leaving school or
university has to do an initial two years in
the Defense Force, followed by 720 days
spread over 12 years.
After five years on reserve, when he is
liable for call-up to active service in an "op

erational area" like Namibia, the citizen-sol
dier then has to do 12 days a year in a local
"Commando," similiar to a National Guard
unit, until he is 60. It adds up to nearly
years' soldiering if he starts when he is 17.
A small but growing number have left the
country to avoid the draft, some seeking po
litical asylum abroad, mostly in Europe.
A number of Jehovah's Witnesses have
been imprisoned for refusing to do military
service on religious grounds. Apart from
them, only five other men have refused dur
ing the past year on the grounds that they are
pacifists. All were imprisoned for one year.
Paddock is the first to make a stand of
public defiance on overtly political grounds.
He looked conspicuously unmilitary
when he appeared at the court martial Tues
day, with a bushy beard and a casual cor
duroy jacket, among the heavily braided
army officers. The president of the court
martial was Col. Elias de Villiers.
Paddock conducted his own case, refusing
the help of an army lawyer, and called
Bishop Desmond Tutu, the black general
secretary of the South African Council of
Churches, as his only supporting witness.

In a lengthy statement, Paddock cited
eight criteria for a just war drawn up by St.
Augustine and argued that the South

African Defense Force failed all of them.
He said the war being fought in Namibia,
also known as South-West Africa, against
guerrillas of the South-West Africa People's
Organization (SWAPO) is unjust because
the South African army is an illegal occupy
ing foce in a foreign country.
South Africa's continued presence in
Namibia has been declared illegal by the In
ternational Court of Justice, he said, and the
court's opinion had been endorsed by the
U.N. Security Council.
Paddock argued that the South African

government lacked legitimacy at home too
because the African population, 70 percent
of the total, has no vote and is excluded from
consultation on the country's constitutional
structure.
Moreover, said Paddock, the government
had passed "a plethora of unjust and ex
ploitative laws and has stopped adminis
tering for the common good."
While the war in Namibia is illegal, that
against black guerrillas within South Africa
is unjust. Paddock said.
"The Defense Force is engaged in a war
against blacks who have fled this country's
oppressive and exploitative system, many of
them school pupils who fled after clashes
with tht police in 1976 and 1977.
"Thus the war is a civil war and not a war
of defense against some external oppressor."
In this civil war, said Paddock, the De
fense Force was fighting for the defense of
apartheid, which the Catholic church among
other Christian bodies had described as in
defensible because it was an unjust and ex
ploitative system.
Tutu agreed with Paddock's assessment
that the Defense Force is engaged in unjust
wars, and said a devout Christian was
obliged to obey his conscience in deciding
whether he could serve in it or not.

media here are under some pressure not to
publicize the case.
The Defense Force's chief of personnel,
Lt. Gen R. F. Holtzhausen, expressed some
of this concern when he told a society of stu

dent counselors Sept. 30, there was a grow
ing movement against the draft on most
South African university campuses.
"There is increasing pressure on our
young men to dodge national service or to
question the underlying motive,"
Holtzhausen said.

Paddock argued that the
South African government
lacked legitimacy at home
too because the African
population, 70 percent of the
total, has no vote and is
excluded from consultation
on the country's
constitutional structure.

Under South Africa's conscription sys
tem, every white youth on leaving school or
university has to do an initial two years in
the Defense Force, followed by 720 days
spread over 12 years.
After five years on reserve, when he is
liable for call-up to active service in an "op

unit, until he is 60. It adds up to nearly
years' soldiering if he starts when he is 17.
A small but growing number have left the
country to avoid the draft, some seeking po

A number of Jehovah's Witnesses have

the help of an army lawyer, and called

African Defense Force failed all of them.
He said the war being fought in Namibia,
also known as South-West Africa, against
guerrillas of the South-West Africa People's
Organization (SWAPO) is unjust because
the South African army is an illegal occupy
ing foce in a foreign country.
South Africa's continued presence in
Namibia has been declared illegal by the In
ternational Court of Justice, he said, and the
court's opinion had been endorsed by the
U.N. Security Council.
Paddock argued that the South African

government lacked legitimacy at home too
because the African population, 70 percent
of the total, has no vote and is excluded from
consultation on the country's constitutional
structure.
Moreover, said Paddock, the government
had passed "a plethora of unjust and ex
ploitative laws and has stopped adminis
tering for the common good."
While the war in Namibia is illegal, that
against black guerrillas within South Africa
is unjust. Paddock said.
"The Defense Force is engaged in a war
against blacks who have fled this country's
oppressive and exploitative system, many of
them school pupils who fled after clashes
with tht police in 1976 and 1977.
"Thus the war is a civil war and not a war
of defense against some external oppressor."
In this civil war, said Paddock, the De
fense Force was fighting for the defense of
apartheid, which the Catholic church among
other Christian bodies had described as in
defensible because it was an unjust and ex
ploitative system.
Tutu agreed with Paddock's assessment
that the Defense Force is engaged in unjust
wars, and said a devout Christian was
obliged to obey his conscience in deciding
whether he could serve in it or not.
PRETORIA, South Africa — The first
South African to refuse to be drafted into his
country's armed forces on the grounds that
they are fighting unjust wars was sentenced
to one year's imprisonment by a court
martial here yesterday.
William Paddock, a 31-year-old former
candidate for the priesthood in the Anglican
Church, told the court:"I cannot enter the
Defense Force because of the role it plays in
defending the structural violence of the
South African system."
It was half the sentence Paddock might
have received under a defense law that pre
cludes any form of conscientious objection.
Associates of Paddock and other ob
servers sympathetic to him were surprised by
the relative leniency of the sentence. They
speculated that it might reflect a desire by
military chiefs not to make a martyr of Pad
dock or highlight his case and a concern that
dvaft dodging could snowball among politi
cal opponents of the government's strict seg
regations! policies, called apartheid. The
