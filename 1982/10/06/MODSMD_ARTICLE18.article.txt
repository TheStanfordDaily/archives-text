Associate law dean chosen
The Stanford Law School has selected a
new associate dean of administration.Thom
as Mcßride, 53, will begin work Oct. 18.
Mcßride fills the office left empty by the
death of Joseph Leininger on June 3.
"We are enormously lucky to get him. His
qualifications really are quite spectacular for
this kind of job," said Dean John Ely, who
announced the appointment.
Mcßride, inspector general of the U.S.
Department of Labor and former associate
Watergate special prosecutor, currently ov
ersees a computer matching project under
the Reagan administration. He manages a
staff of 440 auditors and investigators with a
$34 million annual budget, working to dec
tect fraud in such areas as welfare payments,
loans, veterans' benefits and government
contracting.
During 1973-75, he directed the largest of
the Watergate special prosecutor's task
forces, examining campaign contributions.
More than 30 individuals and 20 major cor
porations were prosecuted as a result of the
task force's work.
Now Mcßride will leave the public sector
to be in charge of the Law School's budget,

facilities and non-faculty personnel, Ely
said. The existing budget office and per
sonnel officer will come under his authority.
Although Mcßride will not be teaching,
Ely said, "It is conceivable he would give a
seminar sometime in the future."
Mcßride will also have a special responsi
bility for foreign visitors, because he has
such extensive international experience. Ely
noted Mcßride had served as deputy direc
tor of the Peace Corps' Latin American re
gion.
In addition, Mcßride has "a special in
terest and expertise in computers," Ely
noted. These abilities will be useful as the
Law School adopts computerization for
more and more tasks, Ely said.
"He is an excellent lawyer, has had in
teresting and prestigious jobs and has the
scrupulous honesty his government jobs
have required," Ely remarked, "and he's
somebody I felt I could work with."
Born February 8, 1929 in Elgin, 111., he at
tended the University of lowa, then gradu
ated from New York University (B.A. Eng
lish, 1952) and Columbia Law School
(LL.B , J.D., 1956).
