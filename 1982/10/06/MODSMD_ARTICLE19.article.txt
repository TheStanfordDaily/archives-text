# Scholars discuss crisis
## Lebanon should lead to negotiations 
### LINDEN BLUE 
The outcome of the Lebanon conflict
should actually help to alleviate Arab-Israeli
tensions by demanding moderated stances
from all the embroiled forces involved there,
Hoover Fellow Seymour Martin Lipset sug
gested last night.
"From the point of view of negotiation
possibilities, the situation is now better than it
has been in years," Lipset told Roble Hall res
idents.
Initial Arab interest in President Reagan's
Sept. 1 peace proposal should be seen as a
positive sign, according to Lipset.
"Maybe it's just an inch, but it's an inch in
the right direction," he said.
Lipset and Hoover Visiting Scholar James
Noyes described the Lebanon situation and
its effect on U.S.-Israeli relations in the first
of a series of six discussions sponsored by the
Roble Political Action Committee (RPAC).
Noyes, who was deputy assistant secretary
of defense from 1970-76, said he believed the
U.S.-Israeli tensions caused by the Lebanon
invasion would make for a "more normal na
tion-to-nation relationship with haggling and
the usual types of things that take place be
tween friendly states."
Prior to the Lebanon conflict, Israel viewed
its role as the protector of U.S. security con
cerns in the Mideast and expected "open
ended support", Noyes said. However, Is

rael's image has been significantly damaged
during the Beirut invasion and especially af
ter the West Beirut massacre last month.
According to Lipset, the massacre "has
changed the political implications and the
larger political situation and has further
isolated Israel with respect to other countries
and has considerably reduced its support in
the United States.
"And actually as The New York Times to
day suggested, this should significantly en
hance the chances of the Reagan (peace)
plan."
The Reagan peace initiative suggests the
founding of a self-governing Palestinian state
on the West Bank in association with Jordan.
Israeli Prime Minister Menachem Begin has
rejected the proposal on security grounds,
and many fear his government is moving
toward annexation of the territory.
Noyes called the security argument
"bogus" because Israel has a large
technological and military advantage over its
neighbors. For the United States to support
the annexation would be "unreasonable and
unrealistic," he said.
According to Lipset, the current U.S. pres
sure on the Israeli government is un
precedented. "In the past when push came to
shove the United States generally backed
down," he said.
Lipset said he believed that in the short run,

the U.S. pressure might increase domestic
support for the hard-line Begin government
"because no country likes external dicta
tion." However, after talking with Israelis,
Lipset said he now believes that the threat of
losing the "American connection" could
eventually change Israeli public opinion.
Both Noyes and Lipset agreed that the
Reagan administration has improved its per
ception of the sensitive problems within the
Mideast. The administration's initial posi
tion, said Noyes, "was somewhat naive."
He said Reagan tended to view Mideastern
problems in the context of a larger U.S. anti-
Soviet policy.
In addition, some of the administration's
first statements regarding the Mideast
strained earlier peace efforts, Noyes said. As
examples, Noyes described how the United
States didn't object to Israeli bombing at
tacks in Lebanon or to continuing settlements
on the West Bank. Part of this stance Noyes
attributed to former Secretary of State Alex
ander Haig's reluctance to criticize Israel.
The appointment of George Shultz as sec
retary of state this summer is a positive de
velopment since he seems more ambivalent
than Haig, Noyes explained. Being neither
pro nor anti-Israel is ar*asset in Washington,
D.C, today because it mitigates criticism,
Noyes said.

on the West Bank. Part of this stance Noyes
attributed to former Secretary of State Alex
ander Haig's reluctance to criticize Israel.
The appointment of George Shultz as sec
retary of state this summer is a positive de
velopment since he seems more ambivalent
than Haig, Noyes explained. Being neither
pro nor anti-Israel is ar*asset in Washington,
D.C, today because it mitigates criticism,
Noyes said.

velopments in Lebanon in Roble Hall last
night. The presentation was sponsored by

as one its six-part series.
The outcome of the Lebanon conflict
should actually help to alleviate Arab-Israeli
tensions by demanding moderated stances
from all the embroiled forces involved there,
Hoover Fellow Seymour Martin Lipset sug
gested last night.
"From the point of view of negotiation
possibilities, the situation is now better than it
has been in years," Lipset told Roble Hall res
idents.
Initial Arab interest in President Reagan's
Sept. 1 peace proposal should be seen as a
positive sign, according to Lipset.
"Maybe it's just an inch, but it's an inch in
the right direction," he said.
Lipset and Hoover Visiting Scholar James
Noyes described the Lebanon situation and
its effect on U.S.-Israeli relations in the first
of a series of six discussions sponsored by the
Roble Political Action Committee (RPAC).
Noyes, who was deputy assistant secretary
of defense from 1970-76, said he believed the
U.S.-Israeli tensions caused by the Lebanon
invasion would make for a "more normal na
tion-to-nation relationship with haggling and
the usual types of things that take place be
tween friendly states."
Prior to the Lebanon conflict, Israel viewed
its role as the protector of U.S. security con
cerns in the Mideast and expected "open
ended support", Noyes said. However, Is

rael's image has been significantly damaged
during the Beirut invasion and especially af
ter the West Beirut massacre last month.
According to Lipset, the massacre "has
changed the political implications and the
larger political situation and has further
isolated Israel with respect to other countries
and has considerably reduced its support in
the United States.
"And actually as The New York Times to
day suggested, this should significantly en
hance the chances of the Reagan (peace)
plan."
The Reagan peace initiative suggests the
founding of a self-governing Palestinian state
on the West Bank in association with Jordan.
Israeli Prime Minister Menachem Begin has
rejected the proposal on security grounds,
and many fear his government is moving
toward annexation of the territory.
Noyes called the security argument
"bogus" because Israel has a large
technological and military advantage over its
neighbors. For the United States to support
the annexation would be "unreasonable and
unrealistic," he said.
According to Lipset, the current U.S. pres
sure on the Israeli government is un
precedented. "In the past when push came to
shove the United States generally backed
down," he said.
Lipset said he believed that in the short run,

the U.S. pressure might increase domestic
support for the hard-line Begin government
"because no country likes external dicta
tion." However, after talking with Israelis,
Lipset said he now believes that the threat of
losing the "American connection" could
eventually change Israeli public opinion.
Both Noyes and Lipset agreed that the
Reagan administration has improved its per
ception of the sensitive problems within the
Mideast. The administration's initial posi
tion, said Noyes, "was somewhat naive."
He said Reagan tended to view Mideastern
problems in the context of a larger U.S. anti-
Soviet policy.
In addition, some of the administration's
first statements regarding the Mideast
strained earlier peace efforts, Noyes said. As
examples, Noyes described how the United
States didn't object to Israeli bombing at
tacks in Lebanon or to continuing settlements
on the West Bank. Part of this stance Noyes
attributed to former Secretary of State Alex
ander Haig's reluctance to criticize Israel.
The appointment of George Shultz as sec
retary of state this summer is a positive de
velopment since he seems more ambivalent
than Haig, Noyes explained. Being neither
pro nor anti-Israel is ar*asset in Washington,
D.C, today because it mitigates criticism,
Noyes said.
