Lebanese army cracks down in Beirut
Beirut, Lebanon — The Lebanese army arrested hundreds of people in
Moslem West Beirut yesterday in its biggest show of force since the 1975-76
civil war.
Hidden arms also were confiscated in the former stronghold of the
Palestine Liberation Organization and its leftist militia allies. The operation
was part of a government crackdown on PLO remnants and leftist militia in
the Moslem sector in an attempt to reassert control over the war-torn coun
try.
The state television said some of those arrested might be deported, and a
Saudi Arabian magazine quoted President Amin Gemayel as saying Palesti
nians who entered Lebanon illegally must leave.
Military officials refused to say how many people were rounded up, but
reporters saw trucks filled with people, some blindfolded, being driven away.
Security sources said 450 people had been seized during the army sweeps.
Soldiers closed streets in the central shopping district of west Beirut and
checked documents of pedestrians and people in automobiles. They blocked
street corners with armored personnel carriers as soldiers with bullhorns
warned residents to cooperate.
Palestinian refugees said the move was aimed at intimidating them and
forcing them out of the country. Western diplomatic sources said those ar
rested included Palestinians — some whose papers were in order — as well as
Asians and other foreigners without residency permits or with permits that
had expired.
There are an estimated 300,000 to 500,000 Palestinians in Lebanon, fol
lowing withdrawal of the main body of PLO fighters in August.
Other sources said Lebanese with illegal weapons also were rounded up as
part of the government's campaign to capture the weapons of leftist militias.
Police sources said those arrested were being questioned by the Lebanese
intelligence agency. There was no information on where the suspects were
taken.
Israel moderates demands
United Nations — Israel is willing to settle for a simultaneous withdrawal
of Israeli, Syrian and Palestinian troops from Lebanon, Foreign Minister
Yitzhak Shamir said yesterday.
His position was more moderate than the stand taken by some officials in
Jerusalem, who have been calling for the departure of the estimated 8000
Palestine Liberation Organization troops from the Syrian occupation zones
before the withdrawal of Israeli and Syrian forces.
'.-This demand was strengthened after Sunday's ambush of a bus carrying
Israeli troops in the mountains east of Beirut. Six soldiers were killed and 22
wounded, and Israel blamed the PLO.
But Shamir, in an interview here yesterday, made clear that the call for a
prior PLO withdrawal was not a firm demand.
It is something "we are asking," he said, "because they (the PLO) are ac
tive and there is no cease-fire with them. They have to be removed as soon as
possible. But simultaneous? Why not? It's a matter for discussion."
In Jerusalem. U.S. special envoy Morris Draper met for 90 minutes with
Prime Minister Menachem Begin and Defense Minister Ariel Sharon amid
reports that the United States was opposing the Israeli position on prior
PLO withdrawal. An Israeli Foreign Ministry spokesman said the subject of
which forces should leave Lebanon first did not come up in the meeting,
Washington Post correspondent Edward Walsh reported.
But an Israeli spokesman said later that "the prime minister and defense
minister emphasized the necessity for the immediate withdrawal of all
Palestinian terrorists still in Lebanon," Reuter reported.
According to accounts in Israeli newspapers,
Walsh reported, Syria has told American nego
tiators that it is not responsible for the Palestinian
guerrillas and that if Israel wants them out of Leba
non it should deal with them directly.
Last week. President Reagan said U.S. Marines
now in Lebanon as part of the international peace
keeping force would not leave "until all foreign
forces are withdrawn." He referred specifically to
Syrian and Israeli forces at his news conference,
making no mention of PLO troops.
Shamir also confirmed that Israel is no longer
demanding a peace treaty with Lebanon before the
withdrawal of its occupation troops, or as part of a
security arrangement for the area of southern Leb
anon near the Israeli border.
"Our political aim is a treaty, but one thing does
not depend on the other," he said.
If there is "a will to leave Lebanon by all
parties," Shamir said, "it could be done without
complications — it is a question of technicalities."
As for the security zone, he went on, it would not
require either an Israeli presence or an interna
tional peace force.
Shamir said he was aware that France had
shown a willingness to move its troops from Beirut
to the southern sector as part of a permanent guar
antee, but insisted that "an international force
would not be the best answer."
Instead, he said, security can be guaranteed
through "cooperation" between Israel and the
Lebanese.
The foreign minister, who will visit Washington
next week for the first high-level American-Israeli
talks since the Beirut massacre, maintained yester
day that the "basic friendship" between the two
nations had not been damaged by the events in
Lebanon or differences over the comprehensive
peace plan advanced by Reagan.
Shamir was harshly questioned Monday by
American Jewish leaders at a closed meeting in
New York, participants said. In particular, the rep
resentatives of the Jewish community were critical
of the Begin government's blunt rejection of the
Reagan plan.
He repeated in the interview wjiat he told them:
"We have such close relations with the U.S. that we
have to be sincere, and speak with Washington in
full candor."
Poisoned Tylenol hits California
Ororille, Calif. — A 27-year-old Oroville
butcher went into convulsions after taking Extra-
Strength Tylenol capsules laced with strychnine,
and two bottles of poisoned pills and a third bottle
which had been tampered with were recovered, of
ficials said yesterday.
State officials ordered Tylenol capsules and
tablets removed from retail shelves in a 25-mile ra
dius around Oroville, said Raymond Wilson, a
pharmacology specialist with the state Department
of Health Services.
Larry Lawson, public relations director for
Medical Center Hospital of Oroville, identified the
victim as Greg Blagg.
"His condition upon discharge from the emer
gency department was satisfactory. He was re
leased to the care of his own physician," Lawson
said.
Blagg, who could not be reached for comment,
became ill on Thursday after taking the capsules, a
day after similar capsules tainted with cyanide
began turning up in the Chicago area. Seven people
died after taking the poisoned pills there.
William Hill, district director for the Food and
Drug Administration, told reporters yesterday
that the FDA was not notified of the Oroville case
until Monday afternoon, although the maker,
McNeil Consumer Products, was alerted on Fri
day, the day after the man fell ill.
The question of whether Blagg fell victim to a
"copy-cat" poisoner was unresolved. As Hill
pointed out, "If the man took the capsules Thurs
day and got sick, that would indicate the con
tamination took place before Thursday," when the
Chicago case first was publicized.
Hill said eight federal investigators were in
Oroville, a town of 10,000 about 150 miles north
east of San Francisco.
"We were advised late (Monday) afternoon. We
dispatched investigators last night (Monday) and
they hooked up with a representative of McNeil,"
Hill said.
Hill said three bottles, all from Lot No. 1766 M A
and purchased at a Longs Drug Stores outlet in
Oroville, were found to be tampered with. They in
cluded the original bottle; one of two which the vic
tim's wife purchased later at Longs at the request
of her husband's doctor; and a third bottle found
Monday night by investigators.
The tainted bottle Mrs. Blagg purchased was

shipped to McNeil, and they confirmed it con
tained strychnine. Hill said.
"I understand (Blagg) did suffer some con
vulsions," Hill said. "He is reported to have re
covered, and he's back at work now.
Lawrence Foster, a spokesman for Johnson &
Johnson, which owns McNeil, said the company
got a call on Friday from Blagg's doctor about pos
sible strychnine poisoning. He was instructed to
send samples to the McNeil lab. Tests on Monday
confirmed the pills had been poisoned and the
FDA was immediately alerted.
Tom Matthews, supervisor for the Sacramento
FBI office, said agents were assisting the FDA with
the investigation in Oroville.
GOP leaders optimistic
Washington — The two top congressional Re
publicans, seeking to dispel the pessimism cloud
ing GOP chances in next month's general election,
predicted yesterday that Republicans would lose
only 10 to 12 House seats in scattered races na
tionwide.
Despite the recession and continued high un
employment, Senate Majority Leader Howard
Baker (R-Tenn.) said he does not expect that any
GOP Senate incumbents will be defeated. Depend
ing on what he called the "breaks of the cam
paign," Republicans could increase their 54-seat
majority in the Senate by one or two, Baker said.
House Minority Leader Robert Michel (D-Ill.)
said that, while there may be problems holding to
gether the "fragile coalition" of House Re
publicans and conservative Democrats who have
voted for President Reagan's programs, he does
not believe Republicans will lose more than 10 to
12 of their 192 seats.
"We find through our polling and through the
candidates themselves we're really in much better
shape than what we would have dreamed of earlier
this year," Michel said.
Baker and Michel discussed their optimistic out
look after a meeting with Reagan. Their upbeat
predictions contrast with private forecasts of presi
dential advisers and exceed assessments considered
realistic by many GOP strategists.
While few believe that Republicans will lose con
trol of the Senate, pessimistic GOP strategists have
begun telling reporters privately that they fear Re
publicans could lose as many as 40 House seats.
News stories reporting these views have clearly
caused consternation among Republicans on
Capitol Hill.
"I suspect that what the White House is doing is
trying to build up expectations of a huge loss so it
doesn't look like a huge loss," Rep. Guy Vander
Jagt (R-Mich.) said yesterday. "What they're
trying to do is to paint a dismal picture so that, no
matter what we do, it will look like a victory. I
don't like to play psychological games like that."
The party in power traditionally loses seats in
Congress in the first off-year elections after win
ning the White House. Over the last 60 years, such
losses have averaged about 35 seats. Since 1954,
however, those losses have averaged only about 12
seats.
Michel, expressing concern about the potential
collapse of Reagan's ideological majority in the
House, forecast two years of "confrontation and
stalemate" between the House and White House if
that were to happen. But he said he thinks the GOP
will lose seats only in "isolated instances, in
pockets of high unemployment."
Baker said he believes that the economy "cuts
both ways" as a campaign issue. While joblessness
is up, he said, people are grateful that the Re
publicans have been able to reduce interest rates
and stem the rise in inflation.
Vice President Bush made similar claims yester
day in a campaign swing through Michigan, which
has the nation's highest level of unemployment.
Bush said he is confident that the public will re
main patient as Reagan deals with economic prob
lems because they realize "Rome wasn't built in a
day."
U.S. sent bomb team to Beirut
Washington — The United States sent a team of
military demolition experts to Beirut in mid-Au
gust to work with the Lebanese army despite Pen
tagon assurances at the time that no such action
had been taken, Defense Department officials have
conceded.
An American military spokesman in Beirut dis
closed the presence of the team Saturday. He said
the team had been operating in the Beirut area
identifying and defusing or destroying hundreds of
unexploded shells and bombs from the summer
long fighting.
That disclosure took Pentagon officials aback,

since they had been insisting for two months that
the question of sending such teams into Beirut was
premature and was not under consideration.
Asked specifically last month whether the Unit
ed States had given Lebanon any military as
sistance other than the 1200 Marines in the coun
try, Secretary of Defense Caspar Weinberger said
that no military aid had been requested by Leba
non or offered other than some communications
gear.
Weinberger said that the United States had not
given Lebanon any military assistance because "we
haven't seen any formal request" for such aid.
However, Defense Department officials said
yesterday that the 11-man explosive ordnance
demolition team was sent to Lebanon at the specif
ic request of the Lebanese government.
The Military Training Team, led by a Navy lieu
tenant commander, includes Navy, Marine, Army
and Air Force explosives experts. The team mem
bers are unarmed, according to the officials, even
though they have worked in east and west Beirut
and in the surrounding areas where heavy street
fighting has taken place since mid-August.
"My understanding is that they are teaching the
Lebanese how to deal with all this unexploded ord
nance," said Maj. Robert O'Brien, a Pentagon
spokesman. He said the only way to teach bomb
disposal is to "show them how it's done — disarm
or explode the devices themselves."
In addition to Weinberger's denial that Lebanon
had asked for military assistance, the Pentagon has
consistently maintained that no military training
teams would be sent there until a Defense Depart
ment team had reviewed the specific military needs
of the Lebanese armed forces.
Normally the Pentagon does not announce the
dispatch of a Military Training Team to a foreign
country. However, Pentagon officials acknowl
edged yesterday that sending a military team into
war-torn Beirut at the height of hostilities was not
routine. They also agreed that the team's presence
had been officially denied before Saturday's dis
closure.
Draft resister convicted
Cleveland — A federal court jury yesterday con
victed Mark Schmuckcr, a Mennonite college stu
dent, of failing to register for the military draft. He
was the third person convicted of the charge in
trials this year.
The eight women and four men on the panel de
liberated one hour and four minutes before return
ing the verdict in the courtroom of U.S. District
Judge Ann Aldrich.
Schmucker, a 22-year-old student at Goshen
College, was allowed to remain free on the same
$2000 bond set at the time of his arraignment.
Sentencing was set for Oct. 19. The maximum
penalty is five years in prison and a $10,000 fine.
He testified he could not register for the draft be
cause his religious convictions and upbringing con
flicted with the law.
The Mennonite church, which came to the Unit
ed States in 1870, historically has been known as
the "peace church," Schmucker said. Mennonites
are pacifists who do not believe in military service.
Part of his motivation in not registering was to
impair the government's ability to prepare for mili
tary involvement, Schmucker said.
A student at Goshen College, a Mennonite liber
al arts school in northern Indiana, Schmucker is
the third man in the nation to be tried for failing to
register for the military draft.
Stocks rebound slightly
New York — The stock market rebounded from
Monday's decline with a moderate advance yester
day.
But the stock of Johnson & Johnson dropped
again as the Tylenol poisoning mystery widened.
The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials, off
4.13 Monday, recovered 3.58 to 907.19.
Volume on the New York Stock Exchange
picked up to 69.77 million shares from 55.65 mil
lion Monday.
Johnson & Johnson dropped 2 to 39Vi, and trad
ing was halted in the stock for almost two hours in
the afternoon until just before the close. The com
pany said it was notifying retailers nationwide to
stop selling Tylenol capsules after strychnine
poison was found in some extra-strength capsules
in an Oroville, Calif., drug store.
Today's weather
Mostly sunny with high temperatures in the six
