Lebanese army cracks down in Beirut
Beirut, Lebanon — The Lebanese army arrested hundreds of people in
Moslem West Beirut yesterday in its biggest show of force since the 1975-76
civil war.
Hidden arms also were confiscated in the former stronghold of the
Palestine Liberation Organization and its leftist militia allies. The operation
was part of a government crackdown on PLO remnants and leftist militia in
the Moslem sector in an attempt to reassert control over the war-torn coun
try.
The state television said some of those arrested might be deported, and a
Saudi Arabian magazine quoted President Amin Gemayel as saying Palesti
nians who entered Lebanon illegally must leave.
Military officials refused to say how many people were rounded up, but
reporters saw trucks filled with people, some blindfolded, being driven away.
Security sources said 450 people had been seized during the army sweeps.
Soldiers closed streets in the central shopping district of west Beirut and
checked documents of pedestrians and people in automobiles. They blocked
street corners with armored personnel carriers as soldiers with bullhorns
warned residents to cooperate.
Palestinian refugees said the move was aimed at intimidating them and
forcing them out of the country. Western diplomatic sources said those ar
rested included Palestinians — some whose papers were in order — as well as
Asians and other foreigners without residency permits or with permits that
had expired.
There are an estimated 300,000 to 500,000 Palestinians in Lebanon, fol
lowing withdrawal of the main body of PLO fighters in August.
Other sources said Lebanese with illegal weapons also were rounded up as
part of the government's campaign to capture the weapons of leftist militias.
Police sources said those arrested were being questioned by the Lebanese
intelligence agency. There was no information on where the suspects were
taken.
Israel moderates demands
United Nations — Israel is willing to settle for a simultaneous withdrawal
of Israeli, Syrian and Palestinian troops from Lebanon, Foreign Minister
Yitzhak Shamir said yesterday.
His position was more moderate than the stand taken by some officials in
Jerusalem, who have been calling for the departure of the estimated 8000
Palestine Liberation Organization troops from the Syrian occupation zones
before the withdrawal of Israeli and Syrian forces.
'.-This demand was strengthened after Sunday's ambush of a bus carrying
Israeli troops in the mountains east of Beirut. Six soldiers were killed and 22
wounded, and Israel blamed the PLO.
But Shamir, in an interview here yesterday, made clear that the call for a
prior PLO withdrawal was not a firm demand.
It is something "we are asking," he said, "because they (the PLO) are ac
tive and there is no cease-fire with them. They have to be removed as soon as
possible. But simultaneous? Why not? It's a matter for discussion."
In Jerusalem. U.S. special envoy Morris Draper met for 90 minutes with
Prime Minister Menachem Begin and Defense Minister Ariel Sharon amid
reports that the United States was opposing the Israeli position on prior
PLO withdrawal. An Israeli Foreign Ministry spokesman said the subject of
which forces should leave Lebanon first did not come up in the meeting,
Washington Post correspondent Edward Walsh reported.
But an Israeli spokesman said later that "the prime minister and defense
minister emphasized the necessity for the immediate withdrawal of all
Palestinian terrorists still in Lebanon," Reuter reported.
