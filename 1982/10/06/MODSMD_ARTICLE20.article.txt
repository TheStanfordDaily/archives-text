## Raise record to 7-1-1 Card hooters record third straight shutout: whip Santa Cruz 7-0 
### STEVE ODELL 
! Rolling to its third straight
shutout, the Stanford men's soc
cer team blanked visiting UC
Santa Cruz 7-0 yesterday after
noon at Maloney Field.
The win propelled the
Cardinal to a 7-1-1 record, and
affirmed their status as one of the
• top teams on the West coast.
I Stanford's only loss came to
! Top-10 ranked Indiana earlier
J this fall.
| Junior Jorge Titinger scored
; two goals for the Card and five
« players got one goal apiece. The
spread-out scoring was what im
pressed Stanford coach Nelson
Lodge the most.
"Our potential this year lies
not with stars, but in the fact that
; we have so many players who can
• contribute," Lodge said. "Ev
• erybody's scoring this year.
! We're scoring from everywhere,
! all over the field."
Stanford, ranked as the No. 7
J team in the West going into this
| week's action, put the blank on
Santa Cruz with excellent play

from the fullbacks. UCSC had
only two shots on goal the entire
game.
The Cardinal led 2-0 at half,
and the outcome of the contest
was never really in doubt. It was
an opportunity for Lodge to play
his second team, which re
sponded well, pouring it on in
stead of letting up.
"Another thing that impressed
me with the win today was the
fact that we really put it to them,"
he said.
"In the past, Stanford has had
problems with the teams they can
and should beat," Lodge con
tinued. "Certainly that is a Stan
ford syndrome that is typified not
only by the soccer team. But to
day, wc beat a team and mauled
them, and when the final whistle
blew, we were still striking. I like
that."
Another reason for Stanford's
recent excellent defensive efforts
is due to the emergence of
sophomore goalie Willie
Burkhardt.
"It was really interesting to me

the first five games, where we
were primarily playing teams
that probably shouldn't have
scored on us, they did," said
Lodge. "Lately, though, Willie
has just taken charge out there
and is giving us commanding
goalie play. He had a great game
against Sacramento State" (an
other Cardinal shutout victim).
Other goal scorers for Stan
ford against Santa Cruz were
Todd Rafalovich, Giancarlo Fer

ruzzi, recent walk-on Rob West,
Albert Jordan and Doug Clark.
Senior Steve Moe also per
formed well, and exemplifies the
leadership half of the delicate
youth-experience blend the
Cardinal relies on. "Today's vic
tory gave us confidence," he said.
"And it gave everyone a chance
to play. We'll be ready for San
Jose State."
The Spartans present the first
bona fide challenge in league play

for Stanford. Ranked in the pre
season Top 20, SJS is composed
primarily of junior college
transfers who are "just starting to
gel," according to Moe.
San Jose State beat Santa
Clara a week ago, and SC was
coming off a 1-0 victory over No.
1 ranked San Diego State. So, the
Spartans have the capability to
play with the big boys.
Stanford will try to prove that
it is a little bigger.

J this fall.
| Junior Jorge Titinger scored
; two goals for the Card and five
« players got one goal apiece. The
spread-out scoring was what im
pressed Stanford coach Nelson
Lodge the most.
"Our potential this year lies
not with stars, but in the fact that
; we have so many players who can
• contribute," Lodge said. "Ev
• erybody's scoring this year.
! We're scoring from everywhere,
! all over the field."
Stanford, ranked as the No. 7
J team in the West going into this
| week's action, put the blank on
Santa Cruz with excellent play

from the fullbacks. UCSC had
only two shots on goal the entire
game.
The Cardinal led 2-0 at half,
and the outcome of the contest
was never really in doubt. It was
an opportunity for Lodge to play
his second team, which re
sponded well, pouring it on in
stead of letting up.
"Another thing that impressed
me with the win today was the
fact that we really put it to them,"
he said.
"In the past, Stanford has had
problems with the teams they can
and should beat," Lodge con
tinued. "Certainly that is a Stan
ford syndrome that is typified not
only by the soccer team. But to
day, wc beat a team and mauled
them, and when the final whistle
blew, we were still striking. I like
that."
Another reason for Stanford's
recent excellent defensive efforts
is due to the emergence of
sophomore goalie Willie
Burkhardt.
"It was really interesting to me

the first five games, where we
were primarily playing teams
that probably shouldn't have
scored on us, they did," said
Lodge. "Lately, though, Willie
has just taken charge out there
and is giving us commanding
goalie play. He had a great game
against Sacramento State" (an
other Cardinal shutout victim).
Other goal scorers for Stan
ford against Santa Cruz were
Todd Rafalovich, Giancarlo Fer

ruzzi, recent walk-on Rob West,
Albert Jordan and Doug Clark.
Senior Steve Moe also per
formed well, and exemplifies the
leadership half of the delicate
youth-experience blend the
Cardinal relies on. "Today's vic
tory gave us confidence," he said.
"And it gave everyone a chance
to play. We'll be ready for San
Jose State."
The Spartans present the first
bona fide challenge in league play

for Stanford. Ranked in the pre
season Top 20, SJS is composed
primarily of junior college
transfers who are "just starting to
gel," according to Moe.
San Jose State beat Santa
Clara a week ago, and SC was
coming off a 1-0 victory over No.
1 ranked San Diego State. So, the
Spartans have the capability to
play with the big boys.
Stanford will try to prove that
it is a little bigger.
