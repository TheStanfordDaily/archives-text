Sports Illustrated will name quarterback John Elway as their
Offensive Player of the Week in their Oct. 11 issue, the magazine
reported to the Daily.
Elway, the all-time passing leader at quarterback-rich Stan
ford, is also a leading candidate for the Heisman Trophy given
annually to college football's most valuable player.
The Sports Illustrated item reads: "Quarterback John Elway
became Stanford's all-time passing leader, with 7610 yards,
picking up 381 as the Cardinal beat Oregon State 45-5. Among
his 23 completions were five touchdowns."
Earlier this year, Elway was named ABC-TV's offensive
player of the game in the Cardinal's 23-20 upset win over Ohio
State last month.
