## 
### Associated Press 
Anaheim, Calif. — Don Baylor
tied a playoff record by driving in
five runs, and the California
Angels outslugged the Milwau
kee Brewers 8-3 last night in the
opening game of the American
League championship series.
The series was billed as a battle
of two teams with bats of
redwood proportion, and the
Angels won the first game by sw
inging the bigger sticks and get
ting a seven-hitter from lefty
Tommy John.
The second game of the best
of-five series will be played today
with Pete Vuckovich, 18-6,
scheduled to start for Milwaukee
and Bruce Kison, 10-5, getting
the call for California.
Brewers' left-hander Mike
Caldwell sputtered after three in
nings, finally leaving in the
fourth, while John just got better.
Milwaukee held a 3-1 lead af
ter 2Vi innings as John yielded a
second-inning, two-run homer to
Gorman Thomas, and gave up
another run in the third.
However, the Angels got their
offense in gear in the bottom of
the third, scoring four runs, two
coming on Baylor's two-run tri
ple.
California, champion of the
West, took a 1-0 lead in the first
on a sacrifice fly by Baylor before
a crowd of 64,406, the largest

ever to sec an American League
playoff game.
Brian Downing led off with a
single and Doug DeCinces then
hit a grounder back to Caldwell.
The pitcher's throw to second,
however, pulled Jim Gantner off
the bag for an error as both
runners were safe. Downing
wound up on third and DeCinces
on second on a wild pitch, and
one out later, Baylor drove in his
first run with a fly to deep center
field.
In the Milwaukee second, Ted
Simmons led off with a single and
Thomas, who shared the major
league leiid with 39 homers with
California's Reggie Jackson,
lofted a 1-0 delivery from John
into the left field seats, just barely
fair.
In the third, Milwaukee scored
again on a fielder's choice
grounder by Cecil Cooper. Paul
Molitor started it with a one-out
single and Robin Yount then hit
a grounder deep to the hole at
shortstop. Tim Foli fielded the
ball and when he threw to first,
Molitor scampered to third,
barely beating the throw from
Angels' first baseman Rod
Carew.
Cooper then hit a bouncer to
second, beating the relay to first
as Molitor scored.
That put the Brewers ahead
3-1, and it looked like the team

which had the best record in
baseball and hit a major league
leading 216 home runs during the
season, was on its way to winning
Game I. It looked that way only
briefly, though.
Caldwell walked Downing to
start the third inning, and a soft
single to right by DeCinces sent
Downing to second. Bobby
Grich singled past the out
stretched glove of Milwaukee
shortstop Yount, scoring Down
ing and sending DeCinces to sec
ond.
It then was Baylor's turn. The
Angels designated hitter, re
sponding to the cheers of the
huge crowd, ripped one of
Caldwell's many mistakes off the
fence in deep right-center field.
Baylor wound up at third easi
ly as DeCinces and Grich scored.
Baylor scored on a high bouncer
to second by Reggie Jackson.
Leading 5-3, the Angels added
two more run in the fourth and
another in the fifth.
John, who was acquired from
the New York Yankees on Aug.
31, kept the Brewers off balance
with his sinkerball. He retired the
side in order in the sixth and sev
enth innings, and was never
threatened the rest of the way.
John finished with five
strikeouts and walked just one.

kee Brewers 8-3 last night in the
opening game of the American
League championship series.
The series was billed as a battle
of two teams with bats of
redwood proportion, and the
Angels won the first game by sw
inging the bigger sticks and get
ting a seven-hitter from lefty
Tommy John.
The second game of the best
of-five series will be played today
with Pete Vuckovich, 18-6,
scheduled to start for Milwaukee
and Bruce Kison, 10-5, getting
the call for California.
Brewers' left-hander Mike
Caldwell sputtered after three in
nings, finally leaving in the
fourth, while John just got better.
Milwaukee held a 3-1 lead af
ter 2Vi innings as John yielded a
second-inning, two-run homer to
Gorman Thomas, and gave up
another run in the third.
However, the Angels got their
offense in gear in the bottom of
the third, scoring four runs, two
coming on Baylor's two-run tri
ple.
California, champion of the
West, took a 1-0 lead in the first
on a sacrifice fly by Baylor before
a crowd of 64,406, the largest

ever to sec an American League
playoff game.
Brian Downing led off with a
single and Doug DeCinces then
hit a grounder back to Caldwell.
The pitcher's throw to second,
however, pulled Jim Gantner off
the bag for an error as both
runners were safe. Downing
wound up on third and DeCinces
on second on a wild pitch, and
one out later, Baylor drove in his
first run with a fly to deep center
field.
In the Milwaukee second, Ted
Simmons led off with a single and
Thomas, who shared the major
league leiid with 39 homers with
California's Reggie Jackson,
lofted a 1-0 delivery from John
into the left field seats, just barely
fair.
In the third, Milwaukee scored
again on a fielder's choice
grounder by Cecil Cooper. Paul
Molitor started it with a one-out
single and Robin Yount then hit
a grounder deep to the hole at
shortstop. Tim Foli fielded the
ball and when he threw to first,
Molitor scampered to third,
barely beating the throw from
Angels' first baseman Rod
Carew.
Cooper then hit a bouncer to
second, beating the relay to first
as Molitor scored.
That put the Brewers ahead
3-1, and it looked like the team

which had the best record in
baseball and hit a major league
leading 216 home runs during the
season, was on its way to winning
Game I. It looked that way only
briefly, though.
Caldwell walked Downing to
start the third inning, and a soft
single to right by DeCinces sent
Downing to second. Bobby
Grich singled past the out
stretched glove of Milwaukee
shortstop Yount, scoring Down
ing and sending DeCinces to sec
ond.
It then was Baylor's turn. The
Angels designated hitter, re
sponding to the cheers of the
huge crowd, ripped one of
Caldwell's many mistakes off the
fence in deep right-center field.
Baylor wound up at third easi
ly as DeCinces and Grich scored.
Baylor scored on a high bouncer
to second by Reggie Jackson.
Leading 5-3, the Angels added
two more run in the fourth and
another in the fifth.
John, who was acquired from
the New York Yankees on Aug.
31, kept the Brewers off balance
with his sinkerball. He retired the
side in order in the sixth and sev
enth innings, and was never
threatened the rest of the way.
John finished with five
strikeouts and walked just one.
