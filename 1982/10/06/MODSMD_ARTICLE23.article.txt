### Associated Press 
Washington — Negotiators for
striking National Football
League players indicate they
would consider dropping their
demand for a minimum wage
scale if club owners would accept
a maximum wage with incentive
and performance bonuses.
But Ed Garvey, executive di
rector of the NFL Players As
sociation, insisted Monday that
talk of the union moving away
from its minimum wage should
not be construed as a major
break from its last financial pro
posal. The Sept. 17 financial
package, calling for $1.6 billion
spread over four years, included
a minimum wage scale and incen
tive and performance bonuses.
"This is not a major break
through. The financial package
of Sept. 17 . .. has not been re
moved," Garvey said. "We have
not retreated from that position
and are still waiting for a reply
from management to that offer."
Management's last offer, de
livered Sept. 8, was for a five
year, $ 1,6-billion contract. It in
cluded cash bonuses based on
longevity in the league.
Earlier Monday, union presi
dent Gene Upshaw told the As
sociated Press, "I think we could
get the membership to swallow
giving up the minimum wage."
Later, Upshaw said, "I don't re
member ever saying that."
Garvey said he discussed the
idea of a maximum wage scale
with Jack Donlan, executive di
rector of the NFL Management
Council, during a telephone call
Friday night.
"Signals were received during

that conversation to lead us to be
lieve the owners could be
agreeable to an annual cap on
wages," Garvey said. Repeated
efforts to reach Donlan by tele
phone were unsuccessful.
In another conciliatory move,
Garvey backed off on his earlier
opposition to some form of medi
ation.
Garvey said the union would
consider "private mediation" as
a means of getting some move
ment in the talks. Previously,
union officials have rejected
management's pleas for third
party intervention saying the
talks had not progressed to a
stage where a mediator could
solve their differences.
As a result of continued op
position to the Federal Medi
ation and Conciliation Service,
both sides now admit interven
tion by a federal mediator is un
likely. J39P!!
Negotiations broke off Satur
day following three days of futile
bargaining. No new talks have
been scheduled.
The strike, which has resulted
in the postponement of two
weeks of the 16-week regular sea
son, has moved into its 15th day.
Meanwhile, union attorneys
were in federal court Monday in
an effort to head off club at
torneys in their efforts to block
players from participating in the
first of a series of union-spon
sored all-star games,
The first game, pitting players
from the eastern divisions of the
AFC and NFC, is scheduled for
Sunday, Oct. 10 at Robert F.
Kennedy Stadium in Washing
ton.
