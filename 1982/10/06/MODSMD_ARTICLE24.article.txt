## Victim appears in mad scramble for Heisman Trophy 
### 
Paul Wiggin had spoken
and introduced the victim.
"This is the greatest col
legiate football player in the
nation," he said.

The Sporting Muse

The victim stepped through
and over the tangled legs of re
porters crowding the front of
the interview room waiting to
get a piece of this wonderkid;
waiting to rob him of more of
his four years at Stanford.
Sadly, the victim had be
come used to it — the atten
tion, the lights, the interviews,
the Heisman hype — all
grotesquely damaging the
base of equality of fellow
wonderkids at Stanford.
The victim sat down alone,
desperately alone, at the front
of the room, sweat already

dried into his t-shirt, and he
fielded questions as gracefully
as he chased fly balls or
rubbed elbows with football
immortals.
Interviewers lobbied for the
victim's attention, sometimes
talking football, usually ask
ing pesky items about what
'makes the wonderkid tick.
The victim did not flinch,
answering questions about
man-under zone coverage fol
lowed by inane jabber of his
classes and what he studies.
Rush parties should be so
good.
The victim had broken
more records only moments
earlier and carved his name
deeper into history, climbing
rungs higher than Plunkett,
Schonert, Dils, Brodie, Ben
jamin and Albert.
"It is a great honor for me
to have the all-time passing
yardage mark," the victim an

swered, "especially with the
quarterback tradition at Stan
ford."
He had become the best and
it was time to pay.
A reporter found out he is
taking 18 units — who, what,
where, when, why and how.
A reporter found out his
dad coaches at San Jose —
who, what, where, when, why
and how.
A reporter found out he
played baseball for the Yan
kees — who, what, etc.
There is not a question that
has not been asked.

A Newsweek photographer
has spent the last weeks on a
guided tour of the victim. Re
porters flock wherever he
goes. Privacy is a luxury af
forded to others.
And each week it is on to a
new city and the same ques
tions ali over again.
The race for the Heisman
continues and more questions
will be asked.
What about it?
"Personal records are
always nice, but I'd rather win
games," the victim said,
trying to make them believe

the team counts.
"There are plenty of guys
who go out and work five days
a week just like me and can do
the job," the victim said.
The team, the team, that's
what it's about. Ask me about
the team.
No. How's baseball, how's
the social life, on and on.
But the team sticks in the
victim's mind because he has
known defeat.
"We're off to a great start,
but next week is a big game,"
the victim said, delighted by
the question. "We know what

it's like to be 1-7 and finish
4-7. This season has been a lot
of fun so far."
Football questions ended
and it was back to the victim's
life.
The comfort portrayed by
the victim's responses was
astonishing, but so is his ease
on the football field amid
giants.
Steve Cottrell and Greg
Topp appropriately finished
Stanford's game Saturday.
Cottrell, a relief pitcher in
the spring, unofficially holds
the same title in the fall: a
qualified backup to the me
dia's man-of-the-year.
Topp, a punter, gets his
calls more sporadically than
when on special team duty.
Both play behind the vic
tim, who admits maybe Stan
ford is going to slip away too
soon — much of it in the claws
of this Heisman hype.

"I'm just trying to be a reg
ular student," the victim said.
"I'm having so much fun just
being a kid. Next year, heck,
I'm going to be an adult."
The ranting and raving will
follow the victim into either
football or baseball and this
time there will be less escape.
"I take a lot of classes be
cause I figure it is all the less
time I have to spend doing in
terviews," the victim rea
soned, outwardly joking, but
perhaps serious.
After thousands of in
terviews, I suppose you can
learn to speak in parables, or
give hints.
But lessons will not be
learned as the war over the
victim continues.
Whatever the Heisman is or
stands for, it better be ex
pensive.
John Elway deserves some
thing.

A reporter found out he is
taking 18 units — who, what,
where, when, why and how.
A reporter found out his
dad coaches at San Jose —
who, what, where, when, why
and how.
A reporter found out he
played baseball for the Yan
kees — who, what, etc.
There is not a question that
has not been asked.

A Newsweek photographer
has spent the last weeks on a
guided tour of the victim. Re
porters flock wherever he
goes. Privacy is a luxury af
forded to others.
And each week it is on to a
new city and the same ques
tions ali over again.
The race for the Heisman
continues and more questions
will be asked.
What about it?
"Personal records are
always nice, but I'd rather win
games," the victim said,
trying to make them believe

the team counts.
"There are plenty of guys
who go out and work five days
a week just like me and can do
the job," the victim said.
The team, the team, that's
what it's about. Ask me about
the team.
No. How's baseball, how's
the social life, on and on.
But the team sticks in the
victim's mind because he has
known defeat.
"We're off to a great start,
but next week is a big game,"
the victim said, delighted by
the question. "We know what

it's like to be 1-7 and finish
4-7. This season has been a lot
of fun so far."
Football questions ended
and it was back to the victim's
life.
The comfort portrayed by
the victim's responses was
astonishing, but so is his ease
on the football field amid
giants.
Steve Cottrell and Greg
Topp appropriately finished
Stanford's game Saturday.
Cottrell, a relief pitcher in
the spring, unofficially holds
the same title in the fall: a
qualified backup to the me
dia's man-of-the-year.
Topp, a punter, gets his
calls more sporadically than
when on special team duty.
Both play behind the vic
tim, who admits maybe Stan
ford is going to slip away too
soon — much of it in the claws
of this Heisman hype.

"I'm just trying to be a reg
ular student," the victim said.
"I'm having so much fun just
being a kid. Next year, heck,
I'm going to be an adult."
The ranting and raving will
follow the victim into either
football or baseball and this
time there will be less escape.
"I take a lot of classes be
cause I figure it is all the less
time I have to spend doing in
terviews," the victim rea
soned, outwardly joking, but
perhaps serious.
After thousands of in
terviews, I suppose you can
learn to speak in parables, or
give hints.
But lessons will not be
learned as the war over the
victim continues.
Whatever the Heisman is or
stands for, it better be ex
pensive.
John Elway deserves some
thing.

Paul Wiggin had spoken
and introduced the victim.
"This is the greatest col
legiate football player in the
nation," he said.

The Sporting Muse

The victim stepped through
and over the tangled legs of re
porters crowding the front of
the interview room waiting to
get a piece of this wonderkid;
waiting to rob him of more of
his four years at Stanford.
Sadly, the victim had be
come used to it — the atten
tion, the lights, the interviews,
the Heisman hype — all
grotesquely damaging the
base of equality of fellow
wonderkids at Stanford.
The victim sat down alone,
desperately alone, at the front
of the room, sweat already

dried into his t-shirt, and he
fielded questions as gracefully
as he chased fly balls or
rubbed elbows with football
immortals.
Interviewers lobbied for the
victim's attention, sometimes
talking football, usually ask
ing pesky items about what
'makes the wonderkid tick.
The victim did not flinch,
answering questions about
man-under zone coverage fol
lowed by inane jabber of his
classes and what he studies.
Rush parties should be so
good.
The victim had broken
more records only moments
earlier and carved his name
deeper into history, climbing
rungs higher than Plunkett,
Schonert, Dils, Brodie, Ben
jamin and Albert.
"It is a great honor for me
to have the all-time passing
yardage mark," the victim an

swered, "especially with the
quarterback tradition at Stan
ford."
He had become the best and
it was time to pay.
