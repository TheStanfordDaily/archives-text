The Stanford women's field
hockey team returns to the Farm
for its first home game Saturday
at 11 a.m. at Roble Field against
Long Beach State.
The Cardinal is 3-1-1 going
into Saturday's game against a
Long Beach State team that was
national champion three years
ago.
Stanford coach Onnie Killefer
said Long Beach remains fairly
poweffUT. "

The Cardinal lost its first game
of the season Saturday at
Berkeley 1-0.
California's Sheryl Swanson
scored the only goal of the game
on a corner shot. Renee Chatas
picked up an assist on the play.
Killefer said she was pleased
with the game despite the con
ference loss.
"Cal is one of the strongest
teams I've seen in a long time,"
Killefer said. "We played well. It

was a good team effort, but Cal
was very strong."
Killefer lauded the play of
goaltender Bonnie Warner, who
is also an American Olympic rec
ord holder in the women's luge.
Killefer also credited Kathy
Nicholson with a fine effort, but
said their success so far has been
mainly a "team effort."
Stanford picked up two wins
after tying for first in a tour
nament in Washington last week.
