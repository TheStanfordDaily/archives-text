# Athletes prepare for Ironman test Saturday in Hawaii
## 
### 
At the blast of a cannon on
the Kailua-Kona Pier, 850 top
athletes from all over the
world will plunge into the Pa
cific Ocean for the start of the
Ironman Triathlon World
Championship Saturday.
The 7 a.m. start is some
thing these triathletes have
been waiting and training for
for nearly a year. Among the
contestants will be four of the
five former winners of pre
vious Ironman Triathlons —
Scott Tinley, Dave Scott,
Tom Warren and Gordon
Haller; the top six women
from the February 1982 Iron
man — Kathleen McCartney,
Julie Moss, Lyn Brooks, Sally
Edwards, Cheryl Lloyd and
Claire McCarty; 25 couples
participating together, a man
with steel braces on both legs,
a former paraplegic and a 14-
year-old boy.
After the 2.4 mile rough
water swim, the contestants
will shower, change and jump
on their bikes to begin the
112-mile bike course. After
pedaling across miles of
sweltering lava fields, rolling
country roads into stiff
tradewinds, the athletes leave
their bikes, don running shoes
and begin the 26.2-mile mara
thon course through the
oceanside town of Kailua-
Kona.
The record time for the
grueling course is 9:19:41 set
by Scott Tinley, a 25-year-old
fitness coordinator from San
Diego in February.
The women's record is held
by McCartney, a 23-year-old
student from San Diego. She
set the 11:09:40 record in Feb
ruary.
The logistics of planning,
coordinating and operating a

race in which 850 athletes cov
er over 140 miles of land and
sea is staggering.
"Without the coordinators,
who volunteer their tremen
dous efforts, talents and time
and their enthusiastic volun
teers, the race simply would
not be possible," said Valerie
Silk, the race director.
On race day, some 2,000
volunteers are responsible for
dispensing 4,400 bicycle bot
tles filled with liquid re
freshment, over 20,000 or
anges, 40,000 cookies, 7000
pounds of bananas, nearly
5000 gallons of water, 975
gallons of coke, all cooled
down by 37,000 pounds of ice.
Most contestants train 30
to 40 hours a week for the
competition and compete in it
because they have achieved a
level of physical fitness that
makes the Ironman Triathlon
the only event they feel is fully
challenging.
"We're a goal-oriented so
ciety, so the Ironman is a per
sonal challenge," Wayne
Hawley from San Jose said.
"But when people who don't
understand kept asking me
'why are you doing this?' I an
swer, 'Well, they've got this
real neat t-shirt.' "
For the top contenders,
training for and participating
in Triathlons is a way of life.
"The public thinks this
sport is for an elite group of
nuts," said 1980 winner Dave
Scott. "But it's not like Evel
Knievel crashing into cars.
Training for it is a real science.
There will be a real boom in
public participation in the
next three years. And who
knows, maybe in 10 or 15
years, we'll see it in the Olym
pics."
