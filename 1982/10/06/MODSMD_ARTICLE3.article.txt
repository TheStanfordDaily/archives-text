# Important stumbling block removed from University strike negotiations
## 
### DAVID AZRIN Senior Staff Writer 
United Stanford Worker's (USW)
negotiating team announced late last
night that they will accept the Univer
sity's latest proposal concerning in
formation about hiring temporary
workers when they sit down at the
bargaining table tomorrow.
The union's move represents an im
portant change from the union's most
recent proposal, and may resolve the
unfair labor practice dispute which the
union has claimed to be the basis for the
strike. The University's refusal to give
out information on hiring temporary
workers led to the union's claim that the
University was engaging in unfair labor
practices.

With that issue out of the way, the ne
gotiations called yesterday by federal
mediators will now focus primarily on
wages and benefits.
"We are hereby making a significant
proposal to once again display our in
tent to bargain realistically and in good
faith," a union press release stated.
Priscilla Wheeler, head of the Uni
versity negotiating team, would not
commcnt on the union's latest proposal
because she had not officially received
the proposal.
"I cannot comment or speculate on
any matter that has not been officially
communicated," Wheeler said. "We
can't bargain in the press," she added.
The iinion had previously requested
that the University give the union five

days notice before hiring any tem
porary, non-union workers. In addi
tion, the union had requested that the
University meet to discuss the tem
porary hirings within 10 days.
University administrators had re
jected these proposals as "impractical."
Instead they had proposed that the Uni
versity supply the union with informa
tion in specific instances where the
union showed that USW work was
being done by non-union workers.
The University's position, now ac
cepted in the USW negotiating team's
latest proposal, places the burden on
the union to show a need for specific in
formation rather than requiring the
University to supply all information on
temporary, non-union workers.
"The major nature of this proposal
has to do with the fact that this is an un
fair labor practice strike due specifically
to the issues covered in this sideietter.
While we remain in need of the in
formation .. . this significant proposal
should be made to ultimately resolve
this dispute," the USW press release
stated.
Earlier yesterday, Wheeler said of the
planned negotiations, "We've placed
ourselves very close to where the agree
ment should finally be. We feel like the
union has to make some significant
moves."
University President Donald Ken
nedy stated in a Sept. 30 speech to the
Faculty Senate that "a significant move
by USW now is required to get the
bargaining process out of its present im
passe."
Because the speech emphasized eco
nomic issues, the University may not
view the move as significant to the
bargaining process because the move
deals only with non-economic issues.
The hiring information is important
to the union so members can make sure
the University is not permanently hir
ing non-union workers to perform jobs
covered under the contract, according
to USW leaders.
The National Labor Relations Board
(NLRB) ruled last June that the Uni
versity was, in fact, required to supply
the union with information concerning
the hiring of temporary, non-union
workers. The University has refused to
comply with that ruling and is appeal
ing to the Federal Court of Appeals to
reverse the decision.
The University has branded the
strike illegal because the union failed to
give the Federal Mediation and Con
ciliation Service 30-days notice of the
strike as required by law for any eco
nomic strike. The union also failed to
give the Stanford University Clinic and
Medical School 10-days notice of the
strike.
The union is not required to give
these notices if the strike is an unfair la
bor practice strike.
The NLRB is now considering
whether the strike is actually an unfair
labor practice strike or an economic
strike. If the courts rule the strike to be

economic, the University would have
the right to fire the workers, and work
ers would have the right to sue the
union. '
Even if the strike is settled, both sides
could pursue the charges that the strike
was illegal.
"They could perhaps argue some
where down the line that because of our
settlement of these issues that this
weakens our position on the unfair la
bor practice charge and justifies the fir
ing the workers," said USW executive
secretary Michael Baratz.
University officials could not be
reached to comment on this possibility,
Baratz said he believed the Univer
sity would only pursue these charges "if
they were intent on breaking the
union." He added that he hoped this is
sue would be dropped.
"If you really want to settle it and
wipe the slate clean then you'll settle all
these issues in the agreement," he said.
