# Braves and Cards prepared for continued fight in NL
## 
### Associated Press 
St. Louis — The Atlanta
Braves, winding down their cele
bration of a West Division title,
say they're ready to play the St.
Louis Cardinals for a National
League pennant.
"It's going to be something,"
said first baseman Bob Watson,
looking toward the 12:15 p.m.,
PDT, opener today to the league
championship series. "They play
the same type of ball we play —
aggressive."
A 50 percent chance of show
ers in the game-day forecast rep
resented the only blot on the
horizon as the two clubs worked
out yesterday at Busch Stadium.
Not since June 1979 has a game
on the stadium's artificial surface
been rained out.
Today's high is expected to be
a balmy 80 degrees. The second
game of the best-of-five series
will be tomorrow at 5:25 p.m.,
PDT.
While right-handers Joaquin
Andujar, 15-10, and Phil Niekro,
17-4, were preparing to pitch the
opener for St. Louis and Atlanta,
respectively, a second-game pair
ing was uncertain.
Braves Manager Joe Torre had
a choice to make between Rick
Camp, 13-10, or Rick Mahler,
9-10. The second-game pitcher
for the Cardinals will be right
hander Bob Forsch, 15-9.
Herzog plans to use rookies
John Stuper, 9-7, and Dave La
Point, 9-3, in games three and
four against the Braves in Atlan
ta.
Also less than certain was the
status of Atlanta slugger Bob
Horner, whose three home runs

and 11 RBIs helped the Braves
compile a 7-5 edge over St. Louis
during the regular season.
The Braves hold a 4-2 edge
over the Cards in St. Louis.
Horner, sidelined since Sept.
18 by a hyperextended elbow he
suffered in a rundown against
Cincinnati, swung freely in the
batting cage Monday. "He
looked good," said Atlanta
pitching coach Bob Gibson.
"It hurts, it's a little tender, but

something. They
play the same type
of ball we play —
aggressive." —

you've got to bear with it,"
Horner said of the injury. "I
didn't play all year just to miss
the playoffs."
If Horner is back in the Braves
lineup at third base, it will mean a
double bonus for the club that
locked up its West Division title
on the season's last day.
Not only will it add his 32
homers to Atlanta power, but it

will add to the pitches teammate
Dale Murphy can expect to re
ceive. Without Horner in the
lineup, Murphy — who has 36
home runs and 109 RBI — has hit
less than .200.
"I'm looking forward to going
against (Cards' Manager)
Whitey (Herzog) again," said At
lanta's Torre, the NL's Most Val
uable Player in 1971 while St.
Louis' third baseman. "There
wasn't a better series in the league
this year."
An advantage by the Braves in
power, reflected by their league
leading 146 home runs to a mere
67 by the Cards, could be offset
by St. Louis' superior speed.
With shortstop Ozzie Smith
back in the lineup, the Cards
have a defensive edge. Their
starting pitching also has an
edge, thanks largely to nine-vic
tory contributions from Stuper
and LaPoint.
The bullpens are comparable.
Rookie Steve Bedrosian with 11
saves has backed Gene Garber,
who has 30 for Atlanta, while
Bruce Sutter has 36 and veteran
Doug Bair eight for St. Louis.
Postseason experience is about
equal for the two clubs. In addi
tion to Watson, the Atlanta
players who have been in World
Series are first baseman Chris
Chambliss, outfielder Claudell
Washington and right-hander
Bob Walk. Cards with similar
contests under their belts are
catchers Darrell Porter and Gene
Tenace, outfielder George Hen
drick and left-hander Jim Kaat.
