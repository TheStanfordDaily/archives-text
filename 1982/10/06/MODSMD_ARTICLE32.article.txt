# Horseracing betting increases with strike
## 
### Associated Press 
Tom Rivera, director of mar
keting for Arlington Park in sub
urban Chicago, might just as well
have been speaking for the entire
industry. "I wish the football
players would stay on strike all
year," Rivera said.
Since the National Football
League players walked out last
month, business at race tracks
open on Sundays has shown in
creases ranging from 17 percent
to 19 percent. Several track oper
ators, anticipating that gamblers,
who usually bet illegally on NFL
games would turn their attention
to legal wagering on horses, pre
dicted an increase as the strike
started, but the last two Sundays
have exceeded the forecasts.
On Sept. 19, the last Sunday
the NFL played, 13 tracks to
taled 108,288 in attendance and
$14,785,976 in handle. The fol
lowing Sunday, Sept. 26, the
same 13 tracks showed an 11.9
percent increase in attendance, to
122,982, and wagering was up
10.1 percent, to $16,464,747.
This last Sunday, the second
week of NFL inactivity, the rac
ing increases were more dramat
ic. Attendance rose 19.3 percent
and wagering increased 17 per
cent.
At Off Track Betting in New
York City, where betting is con
ducted on races at Belmont Park,
the handle this last Sunday was
$3.2 million, an increase of about
$500,000 more than the Sunday
two weeks previous. Harry Mc-
Cabe, president of OTB, had pre
dicted an increase of about

$150,000 a Sunday, adding that
"anything more than that would
be gravy."
There is gravy all over the
place. At Belmont Sunday, the
attendance was 25,000, a jump of
5000 more than Sept. 19, and the
handle increased more than
$600,000. Gerry McKeon, presi
dent of the New York Racing As
sociation, which operates Bel
mont, had expected Sunday in
creases in the $500,000 range.
The first Sunday of the Oak
Tree meeting at Santa Anita in
Arcadia, Calif., accounted for a
crowd of 46,000 and handle of
$6.1 million. The attendance was
the second largest in Oak Tree's
14-year history and the handle
was almost $1 million more than
the comparable Sunday from
1981.
"We had a well-received pro
motion, a drawing with a $10,000
first prize," said Ray Rogers,
general manager at Santa Anita,
"but I don't think there's any
question that the absence of foot
ball helped us."
Football gamblers still have
the college games to bet on, of
course, but their Sundays have
been mostly empty, except for
small schools that switched their
game to Sunday for television.
Even small tracks, some of
which have been struggling most
of the year, showed increases in
play the last two Sundays.
Waterford Park, which can
celed its West Virginia Derby this
summer because, of economic
conditions, drew 2,333 fans Sun
day and they bet $267,765.


IMs ARE HERE: The
Stanford intramural foot
ball season started this past
Sunday with over 150 teams
signed up for action. The
regular season consists of
five games, before the play
offs start. Shown above is
"B" Champ SLR (Soto) in
their upset win over the Phi
Delts last season.There are
six teams in 26 different
leagues competing this
year, according to As
sociate Intramural Director
Tony Lautman.
