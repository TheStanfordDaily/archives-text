Happy hour
It may seem like the week is just dragging on and on, but then there is always
Friday. And this Friday at 5 p.m. will witness the return of Volume 182's famous
(or is that infamous?) happy hours. All new and old Daily staffers are strongly en
couraged to stop by. Fearless leader Richard "JD" Klingler promises that you
won't be disappointed. Who knows? ... he may even share some of his favorite
elixir with you.
