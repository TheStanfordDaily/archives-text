# Fire alarm hotlines 'deliberately' slashed
## 
### JULIE KAUFMANN Senior staff writer 
Vandals hit the campus fire alarm system Monday
night, knocking out five dormitories' automatic link
to the Fire Department, said Stanford Police Chief
Marvin Herrington.
The damage to an underground alarm loop was
"deliberately done, I'm sure," Herrington said. "Sev
eral wires were cut in at least two places," he added.
According to Herrington, the vandalism created "a
potentially life-threatening situation ... in case some
one was trapped in their room or overcome by
smoke." Without the loop, a fire would set off local
alarms but the fire department would not be auto
matically notified.
Service to more than 30 buildings on the loop was

restored by 3:30 p.m. yesterday. Herrington told the
Daily his staff will double-check the entire system to
day. "We're testing out all the other loops to make
sure there aren't any problems we aren't aware of," he
said. <•
Until the system passes inspection, fires should be
reported by dailing 911, he added.
All campus buildings are on one of five main alarm
loops. When a box alarm sounds, the underground
loop transmits a signal back to the main panel at the
Fire Department, indicating the location of the fire.
Repair crews were called out Monday night when
the system showed a short-circuit in the loop. The po
lice notified the affected dormitories and "we
searched, thinking it was some sort of malfunction."

Herrington said.
But by yesterday afternoon, cut wires were dis
covered at two system boxes located near Plant Ser
vices and Encina Hall. The vandals may have been fa
miliar with the system, Herrington said. "Anyone
could randomly pick up a box and cut wires (but) the
boxes knocked out are on the same system and quite a
ways apart. You draw your own conclusions."
Police have no suspects in the criminal investiga
tion, he said.
Dormitories on the affected loop include Toyon,
Branner, Crothers, Wilbur and Stern.
Many other campus buildings were affected as
well.
