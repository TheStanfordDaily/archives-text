# New faculty condos help reduce housing shortage
## 
### KATHERINE HUTT Senior staff writer 
Of the 140 units in Peter Coutts Hill
Condominiums, the University's new
faculty housing along Page Mill Road,
42 have already been sold, and all of the
completed structures have been oc
cupied by either the owners or renters.
"That's a remarkable statistic in view
of the fact that there are 300 unsold con
dominiums between Palo Alto and
Menlo Park," said Director of Stanford
Housing Programs Robin Hamill.
The main reason for the sluggish con
dominium sales in the greater Stanford
area, according to Hamill, is that "Palo
Alto has the highest priced housing
market in the country for comparable
housing." She cited the current re
cession and high interest rates as addi
tional deterrents to buyers.
The Peter Coutts Condominiums
have sold well mainly because of their
low price, according to Hamill, who
said they are priced at "very low, rock
bottom market rates," from $150,000
to $260,000. In contrast, the going area
rHtes are from $260,000 to $380,000, she
added.
Two more elements which make
these condominiums attractive are the
University's second mortgage co-in
vestment (COIN) program, and its
housing allowance program, both open

only to certain categories of faculty and
staff.
Those eligible are faculty on the
tenure track and some senior staff
members, such as presidents, vice presi
dents and directors of campus offices
and institutions.
The COIN program, Hamill said, is a
second mortgage offered by Stanford,
with a low interest rate in the early years
of the loan in exchange for the Univer
sity's sharing in the appreciation rate
when the house is sold.
The value of this program was ex
pressed by a recent Peter Coutts Hill
customer. Classics Prof. Susan Treg
giari. "It makes it possible to own a
house," she said. Treggiari added that
the concept of residential education,
which Stanford endorses, requires that
faculty live close to their students.
The housing allowance program
amounts to an additional salary for sev
en years, commencing with the
purchase of a home and declining on a
linear basis.
Aside from purely financial con
siderations. the Peter Coutts con
dominiums are selling better than their
competition, according to Hamill, be
cause "ours are better built and better
designed."
The residences have shingled wood

walls, with black and white window
frames and red doors and trim. There
are both one and two-story configura
tions, and all are staggered in height so
that each has a view of the foothills, the
bay or the campus.
Special features include parquet
flooring in the entries, wood-burning
fireplaces, double-glazed windows and
sliders, tiled kitchen counters and
marble vanity tops.
"We're enthusiastic about the design.
The house is very well planned. It's
spacious," said Treggiari.
The idea for the Peter Coutts project
started four years ago, "in response to a
faculty housing problem" felt strongly
in the University community, said
Hamill. The University found itself
being turned down by young professors
who liked the school but feared the
absence of affordable housing in the
community.
The new condominiums were in
tended to fill a gap, both in size and in
price, between the Pierce Mitchell Con
dominiums on the one hand, which are
small and prohibit children, and the sin
gle family houses on campus on the oth

er.
Because the University wants the Pe
ter Coutts residences available for re
cruiting new faculty, they intend to sell
the units over a period of three years,
letting only one-third go each year, said
Hamill. Several residents of the housing
project noted that their neighbors were
all recent arrivals to the community.
Those residences not currently up for
sale will be available to renters, said
Hamill. People eligible to rent fall into
10 categories, including faculty, all
staff, visitors and graduate students.
The leasing will be done on a monthly
basis, and the residents can be asked to
leave on 30 days notice if their unit is
sold.
The University anticipates a profit of
approximately S7 million from the Pe
ter Coutts project, according to Hamill.
Some of the money is already allocated,
she added, to pay off the construction
loan, resurface roads in the faculty
ghetto on campus, expand the Stanford
Children's Center and start the new
Stanford West housing project. The
balance will be returned to the Univer
sity's endowment.
Of the 13 clusters of residences
planned for the project, four are fin
ished and nine are still under construc
tion, with a projected completion date
of April 1, 1983.

walls, with black and white window
frames and red doors and trim. There
are both one and two-story configura
tions, and all are staggered in height so
that each has a view of the foothills, the
bay or the campus.
Special features include parquet
flooring in the entries, wood-burning
fireplaces, double-glazed windows and
sliders, tiled kitchen counters and
marble vanity tops.
"We're enthusiastic about the design.
The house is very well planned. It's
spacious," said Treggiari.
The idea for the Peter Coutts project
started four years ago, "in response to a
faculty housing problem" felt strongly
in the University community, said
Hamill. The University found itself
being turned down by young professors
who liked the school but feared the
absence of affordable housing in the
community.
The new condominiums were in
tended to fill a gap, both in size and in
price, between the Pierce Mitchell Con
dominiums on the one hand, which are
small and prohibit children, and the sin
gle family houses on campus on the oth

er.
Because the University wants the Pe
ter Coutts residences available for re
cruiting new faculty, they intend to sell
the units over a period of three years,
letting only one-third go each year, said
Hamill. Several residents of the housing
project noted that their neighbors were
all recent arrivals to the community.
Those residences not currently up for
sale will be available to renters, said
Hamill. People eligible to rent fall into
10 categories, including faculty, all
staff, visitors and graduate students.
The leasing will be done on a monthly
basis, and the residents can be asked to
leave on 30 days notice if their unit is
sold.
The University anticipates a profit of
approximately S7 million from the Pe
ter Coutts project, according to Hamill.
Some of the money is already allocated,
she added, to pay off the construction
loan, resurface roads in the faculty
ghetto on campus, expand the Stanford
Children's Center and start the new
Stanford West housing project. The
balance will be returned to the Univer
sity's endowment.
Of the 13 clusters of residences
planned for the project, four are fin
ished and nine are still under construc
tion, with a projected completion date
of April 1, 1983.
Of the 140 units in Peter Coutts Hill
Condominiums, the University's new
faculty housing along Page Mill Road,
42 have already been sold, and all of the
completed structures have been oc
cupied by either the owners or renters.
"That's a remarkable statistic in view
of the fact that there are 300 unsold con
dominiums between Palo Alto and
Menlo Park," said Director of Stanford
Housing Programs Robin Hamill.
The main reason for the sluggish con
dominium sales in the greater Stanford
area, according to Hamill, is that "Palo
Alto has the highest priced housing
market in the country for comparable
housing." She cited the current re
cession and high interest rates as addi
tional deterrents to buyers.
The Peter Coutts Condominiums
have sold well mainly because of their
low price, according to Hamill, who
said they are priced at "very low, rock
bottom market rates," from $150,000
to $260,000. In contrast, the going area
rHtes are from $260,000 to $380,000, she
added.
Two more elements which make
these condominiums attractive are the
University's second mortgage co-in
vestment (COIN) program, and its
housing allowance program, both open

only to certain categories of faculty and
staff.
Those eligible are faculty on the
tenure track and some senior staff
members, such as presidents, vice presi
dents and directors of campus offices
and institutions.
The COIN program, Hamill said, is a
second mortgage offered by Stanford,
with a low interest rate in the early years
of the loan in exchange for the Univer
sity's sharing in the appreciation rate
when the house is sold.
The value of this program was ex
pressed by a recent Peter Coutts Hill
customer. Classics Prof. Susan Treg
