# New faculty condos help reduce housing shortage
## 
### KATHERINE HUTT Senior staff writer 
Of the 140 units in Peter Coutts Hill
Condominiums, the University's new
faculty housing along Page Mill Road,
42 have already been sold, and all of the
completed structures have been oc
cupied by either the owners or renters.
"That's a remarkable statistic in view
of the fact that there are 300 unsold con
dominiums between Palo Alto and
Menlo Park," said Director of Stanford
Housing Programs Robin Hamill.
The main reason for the sluggish con
dominium sales in the greater Stanford
area, according to Hamill, is that "Palo
Alto has the highest priced housing
market in the country for comparable
housing." She cited the current re
cession and high interest rates as addi
tional deterrents to buyers.
The Peter Coutts Condominiums
have sold well mainly because of their
low price, according to Hamill, who
said they are priced at "very low, rock
bottom market rates," from $150,000
to $260,000. In contrast, the going area
rHtes are from $260,000 to $380,000, she
added.
Two more elements which make
these condominiums attractive are the
University's second mortgage co-in
vestment (COIN) program, and its
housing allowance program, both open

only to certain categories of faculty and
staff.
Those eligible are faculty on the
tenure track and some senior staff
members, such as presidents, vice presi
dents and directors of campus offices
and institutions.
The COIN program, Hamill said, is a
second mortgage offered by Stanford,
with a low interest rate in the early years
of the loan in exchange for the Univer
sity's sharing in the appreciation rate
when the house is sold.
The value of this program was ex
pressed by a recent Peter Coutts Hill
customer. Classics Prof. Susan Treg
giari. "It makes it possible to own a
house," she said. Treggiari added that
the concept of residential education,
which Stanford endorses, requires that
faculty live close to their students.
The housing allowance program
amounts to an additional salary for sev
en years, commencing with the
purchase of a home and declining on a
linear basis.
Aside from purely financial con
siderations. the Peter Coutts con
dominiums are selling better than their
competition, according to Hamill, be
cause "ours are better built and better
designed."
