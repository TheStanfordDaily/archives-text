# Aikido
## A 						different kind of martial art 
### JOHN IKEDA 
Although highly trained
martial artists stood ready to
attack, Frank Doran seemed
peaceful and relaxed. An ex
pert in the martial art of
aikido, Doran met his at
tackers with the grace of a
dancer and felled each of them
with apparent ease.
"When my students attack
me they go all out," Doran
said. "They also trust me not
to hurt them."
Doran, a fifth-dan black
belt, is the founder and chief
instructor of the Stanford
Aikido club, which uses the
Stanford Wrestling room as
its dojo, or training hall. The
club, celebrating its tenth
birthday this year, is one of
the oldest of its kind in
Northern California.
Aikido is the outgrowth of
older self-defense arts and
martial sciences. Morihei
Ueshiba developed this type
of martial art in Japan during

the early 20th century. The
graceful art form differs sub
stantially from the more pop
ular martial arts in that
aikidoists don't grapple or
wrestle like in judo.
The moment of contact, or
even the instant before con
tact is the time for action in
aikido, which emphasizes
circular and spherical mo
tions designed to move the
practitioner out of the path of
attack.
But physical techniques are
not the true essence of aikido,
Doran points out. "Aikido is
a philosophy with a physical
expression," he said. "You're
not studying how to beat
someone up."
Doran said harmony is the
central theme of aikido since
the physical techniques are
designed to resolve conflict
and restore harmony.
Aikidoists do not fight against
an attacker, but instead re
direct that attacker's energy in
order to neutralize and estab

lish control over him, he
added.
"Aikido is meant to create
personal and social harmo
ny," Doran said, noting that
the martial art's training
methods reflect such an at
titude. There is no competi
tion, sparring or fighting in
aikido.
Doran also claimed that
aikido training can be applied
to day-to-day life. He said
emotional and psychological
conflicts, such as arguing with
a friend, are easier to resolve
because the mind is already
conditioned by aikido to
create harmony.
"Aikido is a highly effective
martial art. The capability to
kill is very real," he com
mented. Doran went a step
further in saying that the goal
of aikido is developing one's
character to the point "where
no one would think of attack
ing you because you're too
good."
