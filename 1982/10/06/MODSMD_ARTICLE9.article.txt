## The 						Stanford Daily Mem Funnel a summer lark 
### 
Usually, the University's planning commission is
pretty good about weeding out ridiculous pro
posals. Planners are polite but firm: "It sounds like
a good idea," say the men who make sure buildings
have red roofs when ludicrous ideas cross their
desks, "but it doesn't quite fit with the Master
Plan."
They must have been a little preoccupied this
summer, though, when they considered the pro
posed bicycle lanes in the Quad. Certainly, had the
aesthetes in the planning office thought twice about
it, they would have concluded that painted bike
lanes weren't quite Stanford material. They might
have even had a sense of humor about it: "Bike
lanes belong at schools where the band marches in
formation," one of them might have said, "but not
at Stanford."
And they would have realized that the same Stan
ford cyclists who haughtily breeze through stop
signs and casually cut off motorists would hardly be
likely to pay much attention to arrows on the pave
ment or to the cute little yield signs.
But somehow, the safety commission's bright no
tion that $7000 worth of white paint and signposts
would do wonders for bike safety gained accep
tance and now we have it: the Quad highway.

There is no doubt that the problem of bicycle
traffic on this campus is one that has long needed to
be addressed. Nearly every day last year, it seemed,
one could see yet another heap of tangled body and
machine, the result of too many people going too
fast in too many different directions as they hurried
on their way to and from classes in the Quad.
It is understandable, then, why the planning com
mission was somewhat careless in examining the
safety commission's plan. Likely, planners failed to
give sufficient scrutiny to the proposal because they
knew it was for a worthy cause. Putting proponents
of a bike safety plan through the third degree is a

little like checking up on your favorite charity:
when you know it's for a good purpose, you're
loath to ask questions.
But while we're glad that the University tried to
solve the problem, we think it was too quick to em
brace a plan bound to fail. Not only are the new
bike lanes ugly, but they also are far too narrow to
control the volume of traffic that comes to and
from the Quad at peak hours. They are especially
useless at lunchtime, when virtually all the traffic is
headed toward White Plaza.
Already, "Mem Funnel" has become something
to poke fun at. And it has become something to ig
nore: every bookstore-bound cyclist we have seen
has taken the illegal shortcut rather than ride all the
way around the Claw, as is correct. As the first week
of classes has shown, not even the moderately in
timidating (and slightly ridiculous) presence of mo
torcycle cops in full garb can persuade cyclists in a
hurrv that they should stay in their proper lane
when there is plenty of room elsewhere.
And this is what makes the new lanes almost as
dangerous as the old free-flow traffic pattern. At
least when there weren't lanes people were alert be
cause they never knew where the next bike was com
ing from. Now they think they know — but they are
more than likely to be surprised by a renegade com
ing from the other direction, in brazen but typical
violation to Stanford traffic signs.
We don't feel any safer with the bike lanes than
we did without them. We don't suggest a return to
the old system: while the challenge of picking one's
way through the noontime frenzy had a certain
thrill for some, the chaotic atmosphere made acci
dents inevitable and a new plan necessary. But there
is no reason to keep the experimental bike lanes
when they don't work.
What we recommend is that planners find a per
manent and practical solution to the bicycle traffic
problem, a solution that will leave the campus free
of both the ugliness and impracticality of bike lanes
and the danger of an anarchic traffic-flow system.

safety commission's plan. Likely, planners failed to
give sufficient scrutiny to the proposal because they
knew it was for a worthy cause. Putting proponents
of a bike safety plan through the third degree is a

little like checking up on your favorite charity:
when you know it's for a good purpose, you're
loath to ask questions.
But while we're glad that the University tried to
solve the problem, we think it was too quick to em
brace a plan bound to fail. Not only are the new
bike lanes ugly, but they also are far too narrow to
control the volume of traffic that comes to and
from the Quad at peak hours. They are especially
useless at lunchtime, when virtually all the traffic is
headed toward White Plaza.
Already, "Mem Funnel" has become something
to poke fun at. And it has become something to ig
nore: every bookstore-bound cyclist we have seen
has taken the illegal shortcut rather than ride all the
way around the Claw, as is correct. As the first week
of classes has shown, not even the moderately in
timidating (and slightly ridiculous) presence of mo
torcycle cops in full garb can persuade cyclists in a
hurrv that they should stay in their proper lane
when there is plenty of room elsewhere.
And this is what makes the new lanes almost as
dangerous as the old free-flow traffic pattern. At
least when there weren't lanes people were alert be
cause they never knew where the next bike was com
ing from. Now they think they know — but they are
more than likely to be surprised by a renegade com
ing from the other direction, in brazen but typical
violation to Stanford traffic signs.
We don't feel any safer with the bike lanes than
we did without them. We don't suggest a return to
the old system: while the challenge of picking one's
way through the noontime frenzy had a certain
thrill for some, the chaotic atmosphere made acci
dents inevitable and a new plan necessary. But there
is no reason to keep the experimental bike lanes
when they don't work.
What we recommend is that planners find a per
manent and practical solution to the bicycle traffic
problem, a solution that will leave the campus free
of both the ugliness and impracticality of bike lanes
and the danger of an anarchic traffic-flow system.
