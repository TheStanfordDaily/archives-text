						Welcome From The New CPPC Director
## 
### Christopher Shinkman 
Along with its other obvious at
tractions, the Career Faire this
week offers me an opportunity to "

welcome freshmen and transfers
to Stanford, and to greet continu
ing students. As the new Director
of the Career Planning and
Placement Center, I am particu
larly eager to extend to all un
dergraduates and graduate stu
dents an invitation to visit and
make use of the Center.
The CPPC is intentionally lo
cated at White Plaza, near the
center of the campus, in order to
make it as easily accessible as pos
sible. What kinds of services does
the CPPC provide?
The career planning and
placement process, to be most
successful, generally occurs in
the following four steps or stages,
to be followed in sequence:
Step 1: Self Assessment.
Gaining a rather specific under
standing of one's interests, val

ues, goals, attitudes, skills and
abilities.
Step 2: Understanding the
Options. Acquiring information
about the full range of employ
ment options available to degree

holders. Publications available in
the CPPC, such as the Occupa
tional Outlook Handbook, can
be very helpful here.
Step 3: Field Testing Pre
liminary Choices. Through in
ternships, part-time jobs, sum
mer jobs, talks with alumni,
courses at Stanford, extra
curricular activities and other
means it is possible to get a first
hand, though temporary look at
one or more occupations.
Step 4: Placement. Writing
resumes, filling out applications,
taking interviews, and conduct
ing an effective job search are all
part of the placement stage.
The CPPC schedules a number
of activities each quarter, and has
a variety of resource materials
designed to help students at all of
the four stages of the process. We
feel that the career planning pro
cess is an on-going one, not one
that involves once-and-forever

decision making. The process is
best begun early in your career at
Stanford. All too often students
who are about to be graduated
wait until that final quarter to
begin looking to the future.
Skipping steps one through
three, or completing them very
quickly, often leads to decision
making without adequate infor
mation.
While it is not our job to place
you, we do look forward to help
ing you place yourself. In the
short period of time I have spent
at the CPPC, I have become well
aware that we have a staff of en
thusiastic and skillful counselors.
All of us are eager to assist you
during and after your stay at
Stanford. Enjoy the Career Faire
tomorrow. . . and please follow it
up with a visit to the CPPC soon.
