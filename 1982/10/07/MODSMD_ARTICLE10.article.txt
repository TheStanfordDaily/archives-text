# Engineers â€“ How To Find The Best Job
## 
### 
You have spent a great deal of
time and effort, not to mention
money, on your Stanford educa
tion. Now what? Well, consider
the following:
- In the closing decades of the
20th century there will be five to
seven job changes and three to
five career changes in a typical
person's lifetime. Certain
specialized occupations even now
have a life of only three to five
years.

- By 1995 an estimated 75 per
cent of our labor force will be
producing services or goods that
haven't even been invented or
aren't yet generally available.
- In a recent survey published
in Neu> Engineer Magazine, only 56
percent of the engineers re
sponding indicated that they
were getting what they wanted
from their careers.
If your goal is not simply to
find a job, but to obtain the best
possible job, one that takes into
consideration both your short
and long-term objectives, then
you will have to start managing
your career with the same dedica
tion you have shown in managing
your education.
To aid you in achieving this ob
jective, a specialized presentation
on career planning, resume writ
ing, creative interviewing, and
the services of the Career Plan
ning and Placement Center will
be given in a number of depart
ments in October and November.
Check early with the Engineering
and Science section of the CPPC
or with your department secre
tary for exact date and time.
