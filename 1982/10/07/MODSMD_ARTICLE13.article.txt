# Alumni Discuss Career Ideas
## 
### 
The Stanford Alumni Associa
tion's Student-Alumni Network
(STAN) has several programs
with an emphasis on careers. The
oldest of these, the Alumni Con
tact Service, gives students an
opportunity to talk with profes
sionals about prospective career
fields. This is not a job contact
service, but a unique chance for
students to learn from, and ex
change ideas with, Stanford
alumni.
Thus far, the ACS includes list
ings of alums in the Bay Area,
Los Angeles, San Diego,
Washington, Oregon, New York,
Boston, Texas, Washington D C,,

Illinois, and Colorado. Each
geographical area is sub-divided
by professional interests. The
files, located at Bowman Alumni
House and in the CPPC career
library, are updated every two
years.
A number of alumni in the Bay
Area have volunteered to par
ticipate in a "Day-On-The-Job"
program. Offering students the
opportunity to spend a day with
an alum at the alum's place of
work, the program provides
first-hand information about a
particular career, field of work,
or individual business. Day-on

the-Job contact information, re
ferenced by career field, can be
found at Bowman.

STAN's Experience-by-
Degrees program offers a series
of receptions that bring together
students and former majors for
informal discussions about
careers and work experience.
Some departments that will be
featured in 1982-83 are Art,
Psychology, Economics, History,
and Human Biology. Watch
OATQ for dates and times.

All of these programs are open
to students in all classes. For
more information, call the
Alumni Association at 497-2021.
