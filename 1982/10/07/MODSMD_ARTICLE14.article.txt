# Resume Do's & Don't's
## 
### 
Here are some common ques
tions students ask about resume ob
jective statements.
1. What is the importance of an ob
jective?
An objective shows an employer
that you have a career focus. You
are telling an employer, through
your objective, that you know
how your skills and abilities will
apply to a job.
2. How should 1 structure my ob
jective?
An objective should be one or
two short, concise sentences that
state an interest in a specific
career field. It is also appro
priate to state some of the skills
you hope to use in a position oi
lfield.
3. How can the rest of my resume
support my objective?
It is important when describing
education, previous jobs, and ex
tracurricular activities, to em
phasize the skills that support
your objective. Research the
career field in which you are in
terested so you'll know which
skills to highlight.
4. Won't I be limiting my chances
of employment by including an
objective on my resume?
On the contrary, you are increas
ing your chances of obtaining
employment by showing an
employer that you have definite
career plans. Employers are
more interested in people with a
career focus. In fact, a represen
tative from a large corporation
has said that when reviewing a
large number of resumes he
immediately puts all those with
out objectives on the bottom of
the stack.
5. Can't my cover letter serve to de
scribe my career objective?
If you can be certain that your
cover letter and resume will at no
time become separated, this can
be another option. However,
rather than take the risk, it is
wiser to include an objective
statement on your resume.
6. I'm interested in a couple of dif
ferent career areas. How would I
write my objective?
If you have two or three very
different career interests, you
should consider writing two or

three separate resumes. Each
would have an objective that fo
cuses on a specific career in
terest. Then, you can change the
body of the resume so that diffe
rent skills are emphasized with
different objectives.
