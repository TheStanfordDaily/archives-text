# New System Helps Allot Interviews
## 
### 
A new system for scheduling
liberal arts seniors for job inter
views at the Career Planning and
Placement Center has proven an
effective solution to the problem
of early-morning lines.
During the 1981-1982 school
year, for the first time, seniors
were able to arrange interviews
through a.relatively simple pro
cess the bid system. The sys
tem will be continued for 1983
graduates.
Students are allotted 1,000
points to bid for space on inter

view schedules of their choice.
Those placing the highest bids
are able to sign up to talk with
that particular organization. The
number of points bid are de
ducted from each student's total
when he or she is successful in
getting an interview.
An ad appears every Friday in
the Stanford Daily which lists
upcoming interviews and bid
deadlines. If students use this
guide, along with information
available on previous successful
bids, they should be able to gain

access to those on-campus re
cruiters in which they have the
greatest interest.
This process requires that stu
dents be more selective about
their interviews. Under the old
system it was possible for one
student to talk with almost every
organization that sounded in
triguing, as long as he or she was
willing to line up early.
Since many students were not
willing to go to such lengths to get
an interview, their opportunities
to talk with employers were very

limited. Now that access to inter
views is spread more evenly
among students, all who want to
participate are able to talk with at
least some of their preferred or
ganizations.
The need for students to better
focus their career interests has
had other benefits. Campus in
terviews have become a more
productive time, as students are
better prepared and more cer
tain about their reasons for talk
ing with a particular employer.
Hence, these interviews are
rarely being used for practice or
informational purposes, as was
often the case with the first come,
first served system.

In addition, students have
been better about keeping their
scheduled appointments with re
cruiters. There are fewer "no
shows." These improvements,
along with the support received
from many students, attest to the
overall success of the bid system.
Students who have exhausted
their supply of points can con
tinue to sign up on any open
schedules those not com
pletely filled through the bid sys
tem. Students are also welcome to
submit their resumes to the
CPPC for any organization visit
ing campus. The Center will pass
them along to the recruiter on
the interview date.
