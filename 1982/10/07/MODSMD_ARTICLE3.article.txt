# Focus Your Future At CPPC

### 
□ What can I do with a major
in. . . .?
□My parents (roommates/
friends) say you can't go wrong
preparing for a career in busi
ness, but I really don't think
that's where my interest is.
□ This is my last year, and now I
think I've been on the wrong
track.
□ I have no idea what I want to
do when I leave here.

Probably more than ever be
fore, Stanford students feel the
pressure personal, peer, pa
rental to be solidly grounded

in and totally dedicated to some
particular career path. To be
fuzzy about your future is consi
dered not okay. "Everyone else
seems to know what they want.
They're pre-med, engineers,
pre-business. I'm pre-nothing."
Despite the prevailing "everyone
else" myth, the dilemma of what -
I - want - to - be - when -1 - grow -
up is not uncommon among
Stanford students.
That's where we come in.
While we cannot guarantee that
an hour or two spent with one of
our counselors will produce a
path of career certainty, we can
help you sort out your values,

feelings, skills, and interests as
these pertain to you and the
world of work. We can guide you
in exploring options, identifying
strengths, increasing your sen
sitivity to career possibilities, and
clarifying your personal
priorities for the rewards and
satisfactions you hope to obtain
in your future work.
If you would like some help in
bringing your future into focus,
please stop by the CPPC and
make an appointment with one
of the members of our counsel
ing staff. We look forward to
working with you.
