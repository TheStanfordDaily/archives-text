# How To Take Advantage Of The Career Faire
## 
### 
Where can you talk informally
with representatives from air
lines, genetic-engineering firms,
banks, retail stores, television sta
tions, magazines, high-tech com
panies, and manufacturers?
From government, non-profit
organizations, and the Peace
Corps?

At the Stanford Career Faire.
Formerly the Stanford Job Faire,
this fifth-annual extravaganza
will bring representatives from
over 70 organizations to White
Plaza on Friday, October 8, from
10 until 3 to talk with students
about careers. This year will also
feature special tables on five
career-interest areas advertis
ing, law, media, health and en
trepreneurship.
You needn't be planning on
graduating this year to take ad
vantage of the Faire. Many stu
dents have found summer jobs
and internships as well as infor
mation about full-time jobs
through contacts made at the

Faire.
Do plan on spending at least an
hour visiting with employer rep
resentatives. Start off at the
CPPC Information booth, where
you can pick up a map and a list
of all the participants, including
the types of jobs each has to dis
cuss. (For a quick review of each
participating organization and
also of its interest in liberal arts
students, save the Career Faire
ad from the Daily.)

Similar types of employers
have been grouped together at
the Faire. Don't be shy about talk
ing with representatives from or
ganizations or fields you may not
previously have considered.
Working for an insurance
company doesn't have to mean
selling insurance, and a bank
training program can give you
management experience in many
areas. You may have your heart
set on working for a certain com
pany, but the representatives at
the next booth may be able to tell

you about an equally exciting
career. Shop around.
If you will be in the job market
soon and have a resume, take
several copies with you. If you
don't have one, be sure to ask for
business cards from employers
with whom you'd like to follow up
when you do have your resume
put together.

This is your time to ask ques
tions. Ask what a typical college
graduate would be doing after a
year on the job; what kinds of
opportunities for advancement a
big company like IBM could
offer one employee; what an ac
countant really does. Give these
recruiters a work-out they're
here for you.
Some of these representatives
will be back for scheduled inter
views at the CPPC, but many will
not. This is your one chance this
year to get, in one day, a good
idea of the types of job oppor
tunities that are available to Stan
ford students. Take advantage of
it.
