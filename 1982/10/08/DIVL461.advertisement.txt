368 CASTRO ST., MOUNTAIN VIEW
PIZZA OF THE STARS
Bob Anderson, Mt. View, Calif. "During the spring when our team is practic
ing for the corporate Cup Relays we practice together twice a week and always
hit a pizza parlor afterwards. Right in Runner World's home town there are two
exceptional pizza places. One is Boswell's and the other is Frankie, Johnny
and Luigi Too. Boswell's is a quiet sedate place with excellent pizza. Each one
is a work of art. The sides are built up like the walls of a fortress and the middle
does not droop so that all the toppings slide to the middle. The crust (the part
people usually leave lying on the plate) tastes like those soft pretzels they sell
on Manhatten's streets. Frankie Johnny and Lugi Too is a madhouse. You have
to get into line to get in and you have to wait for maybe a half hour. It's sort of
macho pizza, because it takes a very, very hungry person to do damage to it.
