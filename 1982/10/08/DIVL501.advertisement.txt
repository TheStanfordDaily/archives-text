Yesterday's Pace isn't
Good Enough
For Today's Technology...
Or Your Career
m
Yesterday, GOULD S.E.L. developed the world's most powerful super
minicomputer. Today, GOULD S.E.L. introduced one better. Now we've
shattered our own performance records with our new CONCEPT 32/8780, a
32-bit minicomputer with the extraordinary processing power of 17.4 million
instructions per second. That's 570% better than the closest competition!
Dominance in today's dynamic real-time arena takes resources few
companies are willing to match and a professional team that regards
accomplishment as merely the beginning. Electrical Engineering and
Computer Science graduates who join our team can anticipate working in
an environment in which creativity is a requisite for problem-solving and
opportunity for significant personal contribution is expansive.
Ft. Laudeidale, Florida has it all. Year-round vacation living on the Sun
Coast. Tax advantages. A high-technology climate. And excellent career
opportunities with GOULD S.E.L. a company committed to technical
superiority in the international minicomputer marketplace and to the people
who make that achievement possible.
