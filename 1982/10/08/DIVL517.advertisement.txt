W.cancer of the larynx
voice box i. He's now
cured and talking again.
And helping other
people who had the
same cancer learn how
to talk again.
Cancer of the
larynx is one of the
most treatable cancers.
If discovered in time,
9 out of 10 patients are
curable. Of these, two
thirds learn to speak
again, thanks to a
rehabilitation program
of the A.C.S. Early
detection and prompt
treatment can save your
life and your voice.
