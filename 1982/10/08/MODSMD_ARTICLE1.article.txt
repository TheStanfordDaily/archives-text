# USW strike talks remain deadlocked; Negotiations continue into wee hours
## Strike jeopardizes Grateful Dead concert 
### DAVID AZRIN Senior staff writer 
Negotiations between United Stan
ford Workers (USW) and the Univer
sity continued into early this morning
with "some signs of progress," accord
ing to Federal Mediator Dorothy
Christiansen.
"We're still here," Christiansen said
late last night after nearly 12 hours of
negotiation. "The process is going for
ward and there are some signs of
progress."
Christiansen added that there was
"no chance" that a settlement would be
reached before this morning. "The fact
that we're here is progress."
Union officials were also less than
optimistic. "The University is still up to
its tricks," said Frank Kommer, a
member of the USW negotiating team.
"We are proceeding in the same good
faith and we are trying our best to bring
this to a timely end for the benefit of
all," said Patrick Smith, another union
negotiating team member.
University officials refused to com
ment on the progress of negotiations.
Meanwhile, delicate negotiations are
also proceeding between members of
the USW and the Grateful Dead rock
group concerning the group's planned
performances this weekend. The Grate
ful Dead members are members of the

musicians union.
"It's delicate going at this point be
cause there is a lot of money involved,"
said John Listinsky, member of the
USW negotiating team."Hopefully
we'll be settled by then and we won't
have to stop the concert."

According to Vicky Holt, University
director of events and services, the
Dead will perform. "They have a con
tract to perform. Contracts are very
powerful to performers. It should not
be a problem," Holt said late last night.
Holt said that though the union had
"put on lots of pressure," musician
union members have "crossed picket
lines for many, many years."
Union officials said that though they
picketed today at Frost Amphitheater
where the concert is to be held, they
were not trying to block workers setting
up the concert. •
Holt agreed. "They picketed. We
continued to work. They didn't slow it
up at all."
Negotiating teams talked throughout
the day and night yesterday at Rickey's
Hyatt House in Palo Alto. According to
Christiansen, the negotiators only took
one break for lunch.
Christiansen shuttled up and down
the stairs between the two separate ho
tel rooms where two members of each
negotiating team were staying. Michael

Baratz, executive secretary of USW,

headed the union negotiating team
while Priscilla Wheeler, University
counsel, and Felix Barthelemy, man
