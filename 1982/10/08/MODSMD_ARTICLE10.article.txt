## Garfield: Where's my lasagna?... 
### 
The point of view is the direction
from which the details emanate. Dif
ferent points of view create different
perspectives and thus lead to different
opinions. Such is the case withthe USW
strike.
George Bernard Shaw once said
"The lack of money is the root of all
evil." Garfield would be more prone to
say "Where's my lasagna?" Because of
the support services strike, Stanford
students are saying both.
Not that strikes are always bad.
Southern Californians saw the Los An
geles Dodgers win the World Series be
cause of a strike. Now, a year later,

baseball fever is once again contagious.
But, for the moment, imagine a dif
ferent situation. What if the beer, food
and other assorted concession stands in
every baseball stadium shut down?
Clearly, a dramatic decline in atten
dance would result.
Back at the Farm, however, it ap
pears that potential applicants are re
questing information in near record
numbers. Some unfounded rumors
speculate that the applications form has
an extra essay question inserted, "If you
had $6O to buy a week's food, how
would you spend it?"
A lot of students seem to like the

strike. Most of them go to Cal
("Taco√üell stopped serving!"). After
ail, one of Stanford's distinct advan
tages is its so-called residential educa
tion. Part of this includes the op
portunity to eat with the various com
ponents of the Stanford community.
Somehow I think $6O can't make that
up.
Not to worry. If the strike endures
much longer, we can always find a rea
son to get together and chat. I've got it.
Let's sit around and watch NFL Foot
ball on Sunday afternoons . . .
