## Letter by Rebholz et. al. underestimates students' intelligence 
### 
Professors Ronald Rebholz, Sandra
Drake, Lucio Ruotolo, Arturo Islas,
William Todd and John Winkler have
done us a great service, in their recent
letter to you, by publicizing the results
of their "reading between and under the
printed lines" of the current Stan
ford/USW dispute. The possibility that
there might be, in this "informative"
letter, an underlying presumption of
Stanford's malicious designs on the
union could certainly occur to no rea
sonable reader.
Even with a remarkable investigation
to their credit, however, Rebholz et al.
manage to outdo themselves in a
fascinating discourse on "the nature of
justice" and their professional obliga
tion as teachers to wean the typical
Stanford student away from his natural
and graceless state of indifference to in
justice. Indeed, having now this vivid
display of injustice poised before them
(i.e., their own Stanford's unjust treat
ment of the union), it is all too clear that
even those few remaining good Stan
ford students will certainly "cease to
admire and strive for a just society" just

as surely as night follows day. That, un
fortunately, is their nature.
But the most profound insight in this
remarkable letter lies in its analysis of
the grim racial implications of the USW
strike. Knowing as we do that the aver
age Stanford student is an uneducated,
uneducable, prejudiced, weak-willed
and self-indulgent ninny, we can only
agree that he will, as a result of the
strike, have drawn the necessary con
clusions about minorities. It is alarm
ingly obvious: "Services are being de
nied to me by striking workers; many of
these workers belong to minorities; ipso
facto these minorities are to blame for
my problems." The notorious suscep
tibility of Stanford students to racism,
to injustice and to many other un
fortunate tendencies almost makes one
wish that it were possible to completely
isolate them from the real world to
shelter them lovingly from all bad ex
amples and enfold them instead only in
good influences in a kind of warm and
prolonged love-bombing. That would
be true education.

Undoubtedly the grave questions
raised by the writers of this letter will
have already persuaded University of
ficials (however belatedly and
shamefaced) into finally bargaining in
good faith. Certainly many in the Stan
ford community at large have benefited
from a number of revealing insights. I
should imagine, too, that at least a few
of the students who have read this letter
will be carefully examining their plans
for course selection in the coming quar
ters.

Right Israeli wrongs
The display of Jewish breast-beating
at the media wailing wall in the past few
days has not been entirely easy to take,
for it seems to be dominated by a worry
over Israeli "guilt" and hardly at all by
a concern to right the wrongs Israel has
done. That sensitive Jews would feel
guilty over the Begin/Sharon war
crimes is, of course, entirely under

standable and commendable; no
moral correction is possible without a
recognition that a wrong has been done.
But a commentator like French Pro
fessor Robert Cohn seems more
agitated over whether or not the rest of
the world will think Israel guilty than
with the evil itself.
It would be refreshing to hear the
apologists for Israel express some
heartbreak over the diaspora of the
Palestinians, and show some de
termination to right that collossal
wrong which they should understand
and pity more than most peoples by
arguing for specific steps to give the
Palestinians a homeland. But when
such apologists seem to say that the suf
fering of their consciences is more pain
ful and more needful of attention than
the physical wounds that Israelis have
so wantonly inflicted on others, then
they should not be surprised when some
of their erstwhile friends become
Palestinian sympathizers.

fortunately, is their nature.
But the most profound insight in this
remarkable letter lies in its analysis of
the grim racial implications of the USW
strike. Knowing as we do that the aver
age Stanford student is an uneducated,
uneducable, prejudiced, weak-willed
and self-indulgent ninny, we can only
agree that he will, as a result of the
strike, have drawn the necessary con
clusions about minorities. It is alarm
ingly obvious: "Services are being de
nied to me by striking workers; many of
these workers belong to minorities; ipso
facto these minorities are to blame for
my problems." The notorious suscep
tibility of Stanford students to racism,
to injustice and to many other un
fortunate tendencies almost makes one
wish that it were possible to completely
isolate them from the real world to
shelter them lovingly from all bad ex
amples and enfold them instead only in
good influences in a kind of warm and
prolonged love-bombing. That would
be true education.

Undoubtedly the grave questions
raised by the writers of this letter will
have already persuaded University of
ficials (however belatedly and
shamefaced) into finally bargaining in
good faith. Certainly many in the Stan
ford community at large have benefited
from a number of revealing insights. I
should imagine, too, that at least a few
of the students who have read this letter
will be carefully examining their plans
for course selection in the coming quar
ters.

Right Israeli wrongs
The display of Jewish breast-beating
at the media wailing wall in the past few
days has not been entirely easy to take,
for it seems to be dominated by a worry
over Israeli "guilt" and hardly at all by
a concern to right the wrongs Israel has
done. That sensitive Jews would feel
guilty over the Begin/Sharon war
crimes is, of course, entirely under

standable and commendable; no
moral correction is possible without a
recognition that a wrong has been done.
But a commentator like French Pro
fessor Robert Cohn seems more
agitated over whether or not the rest of
the world will think Israel guilty than
with the evil itself.
It would be refreshing to hear the
apologists for Israel express some
heartbreak over the diaspora of the
Palestinians, and show some de
termination to right that collossal
wrong which they should understand
and pity more than most peoples by
arguing for specific steps to give the
Palestinians a homeland. But when
such apologists seem to say that the suf
fering of their consciences is more pain
ful and more needful of attention than
the physical wounds that Israelis have
so wantonly inflicted on others, then
they should not be surprised when some
of their erstwhile friends become
Palestinian sympathizers.
