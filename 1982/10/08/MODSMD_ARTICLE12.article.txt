## Reagan style masks lack of substance 
### 
You might have seen President Rea
gan at his Sept. 28 press conference,
where he asked all good Americans to
"take down the names" of those
anachronistic, big-spending liberals
who managed to shoot the beloved bal
anced budget constitutional amend
ment down in flames. Presumably,
those television viewers with pencils
handy would remember the identities of
the profligate Congressmen and vote
them out of their $60,000-a-year jobs on
November 2.
Now, no matter where you stand on
the Laffer Curve, the president's emo
tional performance must have stirred
your heart. The leader of the Free
World gripped the presidential podium

and appeared to be visibly shaken as he
described the wicked deed committed
bv his political foes. Moments later, as
ABC correspondent Sam Donaldson
subsequently reported, Reagan
cheerfully smiled and waved as he
trotted off to his waiting helicopter,
even before the television commen
tators completed their review of his per
formance.
Unlike any president before him,
Reagan is judged solely on the smooth
ness of his style rather than on the sub
stance of his remarks. Subconsciously,
since we know this man once played the
"Gipper" ( Knute Rockne All Ameri
can)l, we adopt the analytical posture of
film critics: "The president conveyed
great strength." "The president dis
played his anger." Lost in the afterglow
of the political drama, we tend to forget
the substantive event that just tran
spired. To wit: a president, whose
cumulative budget deficits projected for
1981 -85 will exceed the total cumulative
budget deficits for 1960-80, denounced
the failure of Congress to require him to
balance the budget.
There is a word in Webster's Dic
tionary for individuals who promulgate
one course of behavior and then do the
opposite, but few have labeled the presi
dent's call for a balanced budget "hypo
critical." Back in the ice age of the 1980
New Hampshire Primary, Republican
candidate John Anderson tartly ob
served that Reagan could indeed cut
taxes, raise defense spending (to 7.1 per
cent of GNP by 1985) and balance the
budget. . . but only if he used mirrors to
accomplish the trick. No longer is it
newsworthy to examine incisively the
contradictions within the adminis
tration's economic policy, for it is sim-

ply regarded as the president's "politi
cal strategy" to win over a gullible elec
torate.
The failure to challenge the president
on his facts reflects the hidden senti
ment that Reagan, in his role as "The
Great Communicator," does not re
quire even passing acquaintance with
the details of running the government;
that friends and advisers Jim Baker, Ed
Meese and Bill Clark are really running
the show and it would be uncivil to ask
our leader to reconcile his rhetoric with
his record-setting deficits. Unfortunate
ly, the knowledge gap extends to the
second echelon of the administration.
In his confirmation hearings for the
post of National Security Advisers,

Clark failed to locate the geographic
position of several of our strategic al
lies. This raises the question: "Who's
briefing the briefer?"
In part, our current attitude toward
Reagan was engendered by the track
record of the previous resident of the
Oval Office, who seemed to believe that
if he only woke up early enough in the
morning he could exercise thorough
control over the activities of every fed
eral agency while he simultaneously

kept the appointment book for the
White House tennis court. Admittedly,
efficiency in the executive branch would
be best served if some lower-ranking of
ficeholder, perhaps the vice president,
were to maintain the daily calendar for
the tennis court. However, Reagan's
managerial style errs on the other ex-

treme. The times demand a leader who
keeps abreast of current events and the
internal affairs of government. In the
presidential campaign, Reagan's
bloopers such as the remark that
trees cause pollution were occasions
for humor. In office, the gaffes seem a|
bit stale.
The notion persists that Reagan is
not "well-informed." We can trace this,
perhaps, to his tendency to surround
himself with old cronies Meese,
Clark and Attorney General William
French Smith rather than the best
and the brightest his party has to offer.
(Jim Baker and Philip Habib are
notable exceptions.)
The Cuban Missile Crisis and the
Vietnam War taught us that a multi
plicity of opinion within the White
House and an apparatus designed to as
sure that the president receives the most
accurate and recent information makes
for the best presidential decision mak
ing. The Reagan administration ap
parently rejects this approach. It views
the White House as a gigantic television 4
studio for a president who seldom ven
tures into the confusing back lot where
the federal agencies are stored. This
perspective helps explain the gap be
tween Reagan's emotional appeal to
balance the budget and the fact that his
government is running deeply into the
red.

A well-financed Republican tele
vision campaign now asks voters to
"stay the course," presumably to con
tinue to entertain the notion that the
supply-side theory is a practical eco
nomic option. Are we to be persuaded (
by Reagan's Oscar-winning press con-

ferences or by the cold economic in
dicators conveniently missing from the
commercials brought to us by the Re
public National Committee? Stay
tuned.

taxes, raise defense spending (to 7.1 per
cent of GNP by 1985) and balance the
budget. . . but only if he used mirrors to
accomplish the trick. No longer is it
newsworthy to examine incisively the
contradictions within the adminis
tration's economic policy, for it is sim-

ply regarded as the president's "politi
cal strategy" to win over a gullible elec
torate.
The failure to challenge the president
on his facts reflects the hidden senti
ment that Reagan, in his role as "The
Great Communicator," does not re
quire even passing acquaintance with
the details of running the government;
that friends and advisers Jim Baker, Ed
Meese and Bill Clark are really running
the show and it would be uncivil to ask
our leader to reconcile his rhetoric with
his record-setting deficits. Unfortunate
ly, the knowledge gap extends to the
second echelon of the administration.
In his confirmation hearings for the
post of National Security Advisers,

Clark failed to locate the geographic
position of several of our strategic al
lies. This raises the question: "Who's
briefing the briefer?"
In part, our current attitude toward
Reagan was engendered by the track
record of the previous resident of the
Oval Office, who seemed to believe that
if he only woke up early enough in the
morning he could exercise thorough
control over the activities of every fed
eral agency while he simultaneously

kept the appointment book for the
White House tennis court. Admittedly,
efficiency in the executive branch would
be best served if some lower-ranking of
ficeholder, perhaps the vice president,
were to maintain the daily calendar for
the tennis court. However, Reagan's
managerial style errs on the other ex-

treme. The times demand a leader who
keeps abreast of current events and the
internal affairs of government. In the
presidential campaign, Reagan's
bloopers such as the remark that
trees cause pollution were occasions
for humor. In office, the gaffes seem a|
bit stale.
The notion persists that Reagan is
not "well-informed." We can trace this,
perhaps, to his tendency to surround
himself with old cronies Meese,
Clark and Attorney General William
French Smith rather than the best
and the brightest his party has to offer.
(Jim Baker and Philip Habib are
notable exceptions.)
The Cuban Missile Crisis and the
Vietnam War taught us that a multi
plicity of opinion within the White
House and an apparatus designed to as
sure that the president receives the most
accurate and recent information makes
for the best presidential decision mak
ing. The Reagan administration ap
parently rejects this approach. It views
the White House as a gigantic television 4
studio for a president who seldom ven
tures into the confusing back lot where
the federal agencies are stored. This
perspective helps explain the gap be
tween Reagan's emotional appeal to
balance the budget and the fact that his
government is running deeply into the
red.

A well-financed Republican tele
vision campaign now asks voters to
"stay the course," presumably to con
tinue to entertain the notion that the
supply-side theory is a practical eco
nomic option. Are we to be persuaded (
by Reagan's Oscar-winning press con-

ferences or by the cold economic in
dicators conveniently missing from the
commercials brought to us by the Re
public National Committee? Stay
tuned.

You might have seen President Rea
gan at his Sept. 28 press conference,
where he asked all good Americans to
"take down the names" of those
anachronistic, big-spending liberals
who managed to shoot the beloved bal
anced budget constitutional amend
ment down in flames. Presumably,
those television viewers with pencils
handy would remember the identities of
the profligate Congressmen and vote
them out of their $60,000-a-year jobs on
November 2.
Now, no matter where you stand on
the Laffer Curve, the president's emo
tional performance must have stirred
your heart. The leader of the Free
World gripped the presidential podium

and appeared to be visibly shaken as he
described the wicked deed committed
bv his political foes. Moments later, as
ABC correspondent Sam Donaldson
subsequently reported, Reagan
cheerfully smiled and waved as he
trotted off to his waiting helicopter,
even before the television commen
tators completed their review of his per
formance.
Unlike any president before him,
Reagan is judged solely on the smooth
ness of his style rather than on the sub
stance of his remarks. Subconsciously,
since we know this man once played the
"Gipper" ( Knute Rockne All Ameri
can)l, we adopt the analytical posture of
film critics: "The president conveyed
great strength." "The president dis
played his anger." Lost in the afterglow
of the political drama, we tend to forget
the substantive event that just tran
spired. To wit: a president, whose
cumulative budget deficits projected for
1981 -85 will exceed the total cumulative
budget deficits for 1960-80, denounced
the failure of Congress to require him to
balance the budget.
There is a word in Webster's Dic
tionary for individuals who promulgate
one course of behavior and then do the
opposite, but few have labeled the presi
dent's call for a balanced budget "hypo
critical." Back in the ice age of the 1980
