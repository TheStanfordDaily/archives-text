# Sukkah: a Jewish harvest on the farm
## 
### BOB ORTTUNG 
While standing in line to get a meal plan re
fund you might have noticed a rather strange,
not to mention huge, contraption in the Old
Union courtyard. To the casual observer it
might appear to be a piece of modern art gone
wild, created by deranged madmen.
It's not. The contraption is actually a Super
Sukkah, and the mad artists are a few dedi
cated members of Hillel.
The Sukkah is used in the celebration of the
Jewish holiday of Sukkot. Sukkot represents
|two things; a harvest festival and a time to re
member the 40 years the Jews spent in the Si
nai.
During the journey to Canaan the Jews
lived in huts or booths which they hastily put
together. Although similar in design, those
Super Sukkah probably were not made of
2x4s, bedsheets with spray painted designs
and parachutes for roofs.
This particular Sukkah was built by a di
verse collection of people. A few engineers
volunteered their time and architectural re
sources to put up the main part of the struc
ture. Since the booth is traditionally deco
rated with fruits from the harvest, Hillel
member Danny Gunther decided to con
tribute some palm fronds.
But he encountered a problem the Biblical
Jews never had to face. Some USW strikers
explained to him that he was breaking the
strike by cleaning up the fallen fronds.
Gunther explained that he was actually "rip
ping off the University." Taken in this light,
the strikers didn't object.
Another major problem was how to cover
the 30-foot by 50-foot booth. David Ross did
so with his parachute, making this, as one ob
server pointed out, the first "high-tech" suk
kah.
In previous years Hillel has built many
booths all over campus. The Super
is an attempt to bring everyone to
gether in one place. It also symbolizes hospi
tality which Rabbi Ari Cartun says is a com
mandment for the Jews.
To remember the Sinai trip, many Jews try
to spend some time in the Sukkah. This idea

inspired Hillel member Faye Bresler to eat
lunch in it Monday afternoon.
"I helped make it and I feel comfortable
here," she said. "It is also a good place to
bump into people." Bresler pointed out that
Jewish holidays like this are mainly unknown
to most people whereas most Christian
holidays are no longer so novel.
On Monday night Hillel sponsored a
kosher wine tasting party in the Sukkah. They
served various kinds of Manischewitz, a Jew
ish favorite, and a few lables imported from
Israel.
A videotape of Neil Diamond's The Jazz
Singer highlighted the activities Wednesday
night.
Hillel planned an all-night slumber party
for last night, including as activities Israeli
singing and dancing. To ensure the comfort
of the party goers, Hillel asked the custodians
to keep the sprinklers turned off.
Sukkot has many traditions in addition to

the building of the Sukkah. One is the waving
of the Etrog and Lulav. The Etrog is similar
to a lemon while the Lulav consists of one
palm frond, two willow branches and three
myrtle branches. These are waved in six ways,
the four directions of the compass, and up
and down.
The waving is a commandment in the
Bible. It is usually done as a psalm is sung.
When God is mentioned the waving stops for
a second because God is not in any one direc
tion, so there is nowhere to wave.
The Bible does not say what the Etrog and
Lulav represent. Rabbi Ari Cartun put for
ward a few possible interpretations. One is
that each of the branches and the Etrog repre
sent a part of the body and the waving har
nesses them to heaven. Another is that the
Etrog represents the sun and the sound of the
Lulav being waved is the rain. Both are neces
sary for a good harvest.

event the festival of the Sukkah. Old Union Courtyard plays host to this festival.
While standing in line to get a meal plan re
fund you might have noticed a rather strange,
not to mention huge, contraption in the Old
Union courtyard. To the casual observer it
might appear to be a piece of modern art gone
wild, created by deranged madmen.
It's not. The contraption is actually a Super
Sukkah, and the mad artists are a few dedi
cated members of Hillel.
The Sukkah is used in the celebration of the
Jewish holiday of Sukkot. Sukkot represents
|two things; a harvest festival and a time to re
member the 40 years the Jews spent in the Si
nai.
During the journey to Canaan the Jews
lived in huts or booths which they hastily put
together. Although similar in design, those
Super Sukkah probably were not made of
2x4s, bedsheets with spray painted designs
and parachutes for roofs.
This particular Sukkah was built by a di
verse collection of people. A few engineers
volunteered their time and architectural re
sources to put up the main part of the struc
ture. Since the booth is traditionally deco
rated with fruits from the harvest, Hillel
member Danny Gunther decided to con
tribute some palm fronds.
But he encountered a problem the Biblical
Jews never had to face. Some USW strikers
explained to him that he was breaking the
strike by cleaning up the fallen fronds.
Gunther explained that he was actually "rip
ping off the University." Taken in this light,
the strikers didn't object.
Another major problem was how to cover
the 30-foot by 50-foot booth. David Ross did
so with his parachute, making this, as one ob
server pointed out, the first "high-tech" suk
kah.
In previous years Hillel has built many
booths all over campus. The Super
is an attempt to bring everyone to
gether in one place. It also symbolizes hospi
tality which Rabbi Ari Cartun says is a com
mandment for the Jews.
To remember the Sinai trip, many Jews try
to spend some time in the Sukkah. This idea

inspired Hillel member Faye Bresler to eat
lunch in it Monday afternoon.
"I helped make it and I feel comfortable
here," she said. "It is also a good place to
bump into people." Bresler pointed out that
Jewish holidays like this are mainly unknown
to most people whereas most Christian
holidays are no longer so novel.
On Monday night Hillel sponsored a
kosher wine tasting party in the Sukkah. They
served various kinds of Manischewitz, a Jew
ish favorite, and a few lables imported from
Israel.
A videotape of Neil Diamond's The Jazz
Singer highlighted the activities Wednesday
night.
Hillel planned an all-night slumber party
for last night, including as activities Israeli
singing and dancing. To ensure the comfort
of the party goers, Hillel asked the custodians
to keep the sprinklers turned off.
Sukkot has many traditions in addition to

the building of the Sukkah. One is the waving
of the Etrog and Lulav. The Etrog is similar
to a lemon while the Lulav consists of one
palm frond, two willow branches and three
myrtle branches. These are waved in six ways,
the four directions of the compass, and up
and down.
The waving is a commandment in the
Bible. It is usually done as a psalm is sung.
When God is mentioned the waving stops for
a second because God is not in any one direc
tion, so there is nowhere to wave.
The Bible does not say what the Etrog and
Lulav represent. Rabbi Ari Cartun put for
ward a few possible interpretations. One is
that each of the branches and the Etrog repre
sent a part of the body and the waving har
nesses them to heaven. Another is that the
Etrog represents the sun and the sound of the
Lulav being waved is the rain. Both are neces
sary for a good harvest.
