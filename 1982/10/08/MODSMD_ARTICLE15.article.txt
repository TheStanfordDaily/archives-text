# Peace Corps attracts students
## 
### KATHRYN MATTHEWS 
Twenty-two years ago, in
his inaugural address, Presi
dent John Kennedy asked the
nation to "ask not what your
country can do for you, but
what you can do for your
country."
This became the rallying
cry for the Peace Corps during
the 19605.
Stanford students quite fre
quently ask the same ques
tions of themselves today, ac
cording to Peace Corps area
manager Michael Burning.
Stanford ranks third in the
California-Nevada-Hawaii
area in numbers of Peace
Corp recruits, behind the UC-
Berkeley and UC-Davis. UC-
Berkeley ranks first in the na
tion.
The motivation of students
to seek a Peace Corps assign
ment after graduation varies
from person to person. Ideal
ism and a sincere interest in
helping others is highly im
portant, as is a sense of adven
ture.
"The Corps sends volun
teers to remote sections of the
world to live with different
peoples and do unique jobs.
To take that risk, one has to
have a spirit of adventure and
a love of travel and the un
known," Burning explained.
Many students also view a
Peace Corp assignment as
part of gaining practical ex
perience. Not only does one
reap the well-known benefits
of personal growth through
cultural exchange and a $4500
adjustment allowance, but a
Peace Corps reference may

help many volunteers sell
themselves to employers or
graduate schools.
"The idea that a person has
challenged himself, adjusted
to varying situations and as
sumed responsibility for a
commitment can be highly at
tractive," Burning explained.
Peace Corps recruiter Rick
Mead said he finds Stanford
students highly attractive ap
plicants. Mead and another
recruiter will be on campus to
day at the Career Day Fair.

Mead cited Stanford's
strong liberal arts program
and especially the new lan
guage requirement as a sharp
competitive edge for a student
seeking a Peace Corps assign

ment. Burning added that an
experience with the Univer
sity's overseas program en
hances an application as well.
On the whole, Burning feels
Stanford produces a high
caliber applicant with strong
academic and extra-curricular
references. "Many show a
trend of volunteer ex
periences, organizational abil
ities and people skills," he
added.
Last year 43 Stanford grad
uates applied for a Peace
Corps assignment. According
to Burning, approximately 70
percent were accepted into the
program and roughly 50 per
cent will actually go overseas.
The Corps considers 15
Stanford volunteers a good
year. In order to get that
number, Burning estimates
that they need to talk to ap
proximately 50 students seri
ously.
According to recruiter
Mead, the Corps has recently
gone to extra lengths to re
cruit math, science and engi
neering majors into the pro
gram because of the increase
in technical openings. "We've
asked the cooperation of pro
fessors in those departments
in making students aware of
the Peace Corps as an op
portunity to test out a career
field," Mead explained.
Burning particularly sin
gled out the human biology
major as a good category of
person for the Peace Corps.
"However, any degree is
fine," he said. "The Corps has
an extensive training pro
gram."

According to recruiter
Mead, the Corps has recently
gone to extra lengths to re
cruit math, science and engi
neering majors into the pro
gram because of the increase
in technical openings. "We've
asked the cooperation of pro
fessors in those departments
in making students aware of
the Peace Corps as an op
portunity to test out a career
field," Mead explained.
Burning particularly sin
gled out the human biology
major as a good category of
person for the Peace Corps.
"However, any degree is
fine," he said. "The Corps has
an extensive training pro
gram."

'The Corps sends
volunteers to
remote sectins of
the world to live
with different
peoples and do
unique jobs. To
take that risk, one
has to have a spirit
of adventure and a
love of travel and
the unknown.
