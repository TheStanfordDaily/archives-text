# Stanford challenge .atmosphere spur transfers
## 
### LIBBY LEONARD 
Moving to a farm doesn't appeal to
everyone. The idea seemed enticing,
however, to the 100 new Stanford stu
dents who transferred to the Farm this
quarter.
Reasons for transferring varied
among these students who represent
about 70 different schools.
According to Teodoro Limcaoco,
the University of the Philippines
"wasn't challenging and lacked facil
ities." He further explained that in the
Philippines, "schools can't offer
enough to every student, because it is a
poor country."
Transfer student Iris Cheng turned
down Stanford two years ago and
opted to attend the Massachusetts In
stitute of Technology. After changing
her mind about an engineering career,
Cheng decided that she "wanted to be
on the West Coast and get a liberal arts
education as opposed to a technical
one."
Several factors influenced the de
cision of sophomore Leslie Bottomly
to leave Pomona College. "I didn't re
ally like the small, claustrophobic at
mosphere at Pomona," Bottomly said.
In addition, she complained that her
former school was "too homogeneous
and too smoggy."

Junior James Carlin transferred
from Berkeley because he "was tired of
feeling just average."
"I was one of the masses struggling
to rise to the top of the heap," Carlin
explained. "At Stanford, however,
there's a feeling you're already at the
top."
To help transfer students make a
smooth and painless transition, the
University offered a specially-designed
transfer orientation prior to regis
tration. Transfer Orientation Coordi
nator Paula Brazil organized various
activities which included a reception
with University President Donald
Kennedy, an Academic Fair, a field
day and a trip to San Francisco.
"Stanford's orientation is special be
cause other transfers run it, and they
know what it's like to be in our posi
tion," said Cheng.
"Everyone went out of their way to
make us feel at home when we ar
rived," Carlin commented.
Just as transfer orientation is unique,
so is Stanford's transfer admissions
policy. Stanford is one of the few uni
versities to reserve space each quarter
for transfers. The Registrar's Office de
termines how many spaces are avail
able after evaluating the anticipated
enrollment.

According to Parker Beverage, as
sociate dean and director of transfers,
the number of openings fluctuates. He
said it depends on how many freshmen
enroll and on how many students take
advantage of Stanford's liberal stop
out plan and overseas programs.
The largest number of transfer stu
dents is admitted for autumn quarter.
In recent years the ratio of transfer ap
plicants to available places has been
about 10 to one. The Transfer Ad
missions Office received about 1800
applications from students who
wanted to enter Stanford as
sophomores or juniors this quarter.
Almost 75 percent of the transfer stu
dents who were admitted decided to at
tend Stanford.
Transfer applications are reviewed
by the same nine adminissions officers
who admit freshmen. College tran
scripts "are probably the most impor
tant component of the application,"
said Beverage. "We take a close look at
the quality of courses pursued as well
as grades," he added.
Beverage said it is important to re
serve spaces for transfers because "they
make a valuable contribution to the di
versity of Stanford.
"Transfers bring with them a dif
ferent perspective because they've been

at another school," Beverage con
tinued.
Cheng, like many transfers, praised
Stanford students. "At my other
school (MIT) people were very serious
and intense, but here they seem more
warm and fun-loving," she remarked.
Carlin agreed. "There's a lot less
competition among students here," he
said. "Actually, I'm a little worried be
cause I haven't felt any pressure yet."
Several transfers commented on
Stanford's curriculum. The large
number and wide range of electives im
pressed many of the students who were
interviewed.
"I am a little surprised at the number
of mick classes," confessed Bot
tomlv. "At Pomona there weren't
any."
Although most transfers seem to be
feeling comfortable and content at
Stanford, many still feel sentimental
about their old schools.
"It's hard to leave friends and break
off all your old ties," said Carlin, who
insists he'-ll remain loyal to both Stan
ford and Berkeley.
Who is Carlin going to cheer for at
the Big Game?
"I intend to sit in the end zone and
wear both red and blue," he joked.

"wasn't challenging and lacked facil
ities." He further explained that in the
Philippines, "schools can't offer
enough to every student, because it is a
poor country."
Transfer student Iris Cheng turned
down Stanford two years ago and
opted to attend the Massachusetts In
stitute of Technology. After changing
her mind about an engineering career,
Cheng decided that she "wanted to be
on the West Coast and get a liberal arts
education as opposed to a technical
one."
Several factors influenced the de
cision of sophomore Leslie Bottomly
to leave Pomona College. "I didn't re
ally like the small, claustrophobic at
mosphere at Pomona," Bottomly said.
In addition, she complained that her
former school was "too homogeneous
and too smoggy."

Junior James Carlin transferred
from Berkeley because he "was tired of
feeling just average."
"I was one of the masses struggling
to rise to the top of the heap," Carlin
explained. "At Stanford, however,
there's a feeling you're already at the
top."
To help transfer students make a
smooth and painless transition, the
University offered a specially-designed
transfer orientation prior to regis
tration. Transfer Orientation Coordi
nator Paula Brazil organized various
activities which included a reception
with University President Donald
Kennedy, an Academic Fair, a field
day and a trip to San Francisco.
"Stanford's orientation is special be
cause other transfers run it, and they
know what it's like to be in our posi
tion," said Cheng.
"Everyone went out of their way to
make us feel at home when we ar
rived," Carlin commented.
Just as transfer orientation is unique,
so is Stanford's transfer admissions
policy. Stanford is one of the few uni
versities to reserve space each quarter
for transfers. The Registrar's Office de
termines how many spaces are avail
able after evaluating the anticipated
enrollment.

According to Parker Beverage, as
sociate dean and director of transfers,
the number of openings fluctuates. He
said it depends on how many freshmen
enroll and on how many students take
advantage of Stanford's liberal stop
out plan and overseas programs.
The largest number of transfer stu
dents is admitted for autumn quarter.
In recent years the ratio of transfer ap
plicants to available places has been
about 10 to one. The Transfer Ad
missions Office received about 1800
applications from students who
wanted to enter Stanford as
sophomores or juniors this quarter.
Almost 75 percent of the transfer stu
dents who were admitted decided to at
tend Stanford.
Transfer applications are reviewed
by the same nine adminissions officers
who admit freshmen. College tran
scripts "are probably the most impor
tant component of the application,"
said Beverage. "We take a close look at
the quality of courses pursued as well
as grades," he added.
Beverage said it is important to re
serve spaces for transfers because "they
make a valuable contribution to the di
versity of Stanford.
"Transfers bring with them a dif
ferent perspective because they've been

at another school," Beverage con
tinued.
Cheng, like many transfers, praised
Stanford students. "At my other
school (MIT) people were very serious
and intense, but here they seem more
warm and fun-loving," she remarked.
Carlin agreed. "There's a lot less
competition among students here," he
said. "Actually, I'm a little worried be
cause I haven't felt any pressure yet."
Several transfers commented on
Stanford's curriculum. The large
number and wide range of electives im
pressed many of the students who were
interviewed.
"I am a little surprised at the number
of mick classes," confessed Bot
tomlv. "At Pomona there weren't
any."
Although most transfers seem to be
feeling comfortable and content at
Stanford, many still feel sentimental
about their old schools.
"It's hard to leave friends and break
off all your old ties," said Carlin, who
insists he'-ll remain loyal to both Stan
ford and Berkeley.
Who is Carlin going to cheer for at
the Big Game?
"I intend to sit in the end zone and
wear both red and blue," he joked.
Moving to a farm doesn't appeal to
everyone. The idea seemed enticing,
however, to the 100 new Stanford stu
dents who transferred to the Farm this
quarter.
Reasons for transferring varied
among these students who represent
about 70 different schools.
According to Teodoro Limcaoco,
the University of the Philippines
"wasn't challenging and lacked facil
ities." He further explained that in the
Philippines, "schools can't offer
enough to every student, because it is a
poor country."
