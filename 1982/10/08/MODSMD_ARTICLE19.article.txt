Vittorio de Sica on
Miracle in Milan

★ Highly recommended

Miracle in Milan *
New Varsity, Palo Alto
The director, Vittorio De Sica,
and the screenwriter, Cesare
Zavattim, were famous for shat
tering neo-realist pictures like
Shoeshine and The Bicycle Thief
when they took a holiday with
this enchanting fantasy, based on
Zavattini's novel Toto the Good.
De Siea's humanism and his keen
eye for social injustice are still in
evidence, but the style is a wild
blend of slapstick magic and so
cial satire: fur-collared rich men
bicker over land like bulldogs
growling and yapping at each oth
er, lovers swing from poles and
turn somersaults, a balloon seller
in danger of floating away with
his wares is fed bread by His neigh
bors to weigh him down. This
movie achieves what Jean
Giraudoux attempted in The
Madwoman of Chaillot. Fran
cesco Golissano plays Toto, the
saintly idiot who saves his com
munity, Brunella Bovo plays the
girl he loves, and Emma Gram
matica gives a joyous per
formance as the merry, magical
old woman who raises Toto.
Plays Thursday only with La
Strada.
The 400 Blows (1959) ★
Kresge Auditorium
Francois Truffaut's film,
which ends with the most famous
freeze frame in movie history, is a
melancholy study of an unhappy
adolescence. It touched the im
agination of audiences not only in
France but here as well, and even
today directors who attempt stud
ies of teenage rites of passage in
variably risk comparisons with
The4oo Blows. The hero, Antoine
Doinel, is played by 15-year-old
Jean-Pierre Leaud; Truffaut re-

turned to Doinel in four subse
quent pictures ( Love at Twenty,
Stolen Kisses, Bed and Board,
Love on the Run, but they were ro
mantic comedies that seem trivial
when you watch the original.
Leaud has never again equaled his
acting here.
Plays Monday night.
La Strada (1956) ★
New Varsity, Palo Alto
Federico Feliini's most hon
ored and beloved movie. The title
means "the road," and the story
deals, superficially, with the rela
tionship between a travelling
strong man. Zampano (Anthony
Quinn), and an innocent waif he
adopts and brutalizes (Giulietta
Masina). The third character in
this fable about the interplay be
tween brute force and innocence,
body and soul, is an acrobat
(Richard Basehart), a fool who is
also an artist. All three per
formers are magnificent, and the
film represents, along with the fol
lowing year's Nights of Cabiria,
the peak of Feliini's powers as a
filmmaker, before he began to
sacrifice real sensitivity for the
patented, self-adoring kind that
corrupts his later films. Be fore
warned: the final image is a re
markably pure expression of de
spair that you won't be able to
shake off when you leave the thea
ter.
Plavs Thursday only with Mir
acle in Milan.
The Man Who Would Be King
(1975)
Fox, Redwood City *
John Huston and Gladys Hill
adapted Rudyard Kipling's su
perb short story, omitting many
of its ambiguities and neutralizing
its controversial political content,

but it's a handsome, highly enter
taining movie nonetheless, and it
contains what is likely Huston's
best sustained direction since the
early 'sos (though his work in be
tween was often fascinating). In a
triumph of casting, Michael
Caine plays the con man adven
turer who sets out to become rich
in a mountain area of India, and
Sean Connery plays his less swift
pal, whose part of the scheme is to
become king of the local tribe. At
first Connerv, with his dark,
bewhiskered balloon face, seems
too big, physically and vocally,
for his role, but as the film pro
ceeds he finds uses for his frame
and his deep, resonant voice: he
takes on the look and sound of the
king. Christopher Plummer is
stuck playing Kipling.
Plavs tomorrow and Monday
Lost Horizon (1937)
Festival, Palo Alto
James Hilton's enormously
popular Utopian novel was
filmed by Frank Capra, from a
screenplay by Robert Riskin. The
movie's notion of an ideal ex
istence is fairly excruciating: the
inhabitants of a Tibetan moun
tain community, assured of lon
gevity, dodder about in smiling
lethargy while their leader, the
High Lama, intones lethal
platitudes. But the film has pas
sages of suspense and fantasy that
cling to the memory for decades;
Capra was nothing if not a master
craftsman. Ronald Colman,
speaking in that unearthly cul
tivated voice, stars as the questing
outsider, and the cast also in
cludes H. B. Warner, Sam Jaffe,
Isabel Jewell, Thomas Mitchell,
Edward Everett Horton, Jane
Wyatt, John Howard, and in
the haunting transformation

scene—- Margo. ■
Plavs through Wednesday with
Morocco.
The Producers
Kresge Auditorium
There's one classic number: the
stultifvingly tasteless opening of
Springtime for Hitler, which para
lyzes its first-night audience. The
problem is that most people who
have seen the entire movie usually
remember this sequence with such
fondness that they've forgotten
how dreadful most of the rest of it
is. Zero Mostel plays a producer
who peddles 25.000 percent of a
new play he is certain will flop,
and naturally it becomes a smash
hit. Mostei's performance goes
way beyond broad to elephantine,

and Mel Brooks' direction (he
also wrote the script) in this, his
debut picture, makes early
Woody Allen look like Renoir.
Luckily, Gene Wilder and Dick
Shawn put their considerable
comic skills to use; Kenneth
Mars, Estelle Winwood and Re
nee Taylor are featured.
Plays tonight.
My Favorite Year i
Park,Menio Park
Peter O'Toole's portrayal of
Alan Swann, an Errol Flynn type
notorious for his drunken and
amorous hijinks, begins with the
longest, thinnest wheeze you've

ever heard arid expands from
there. His brilliant performance is
one-half John -Barrymore and
one-half Noel Coward a full
length theatrical send-up, the best
moments of which occur when
he's standing perfectly still. He
provides the ideal contrast to all
the uproarious nervous activity in
this picture, which is set in the
days of live TV comedy. Norman
Steinberg and Dennis Palumbo
wrote the script, which at its best
suggests the Comden and Green
of Singin' in the Rain, and Rich
ard Benjamin, on his first time
out, directed in a wacky, hyper
bolic style. It's an immensely
likable movie, with estimable
contributions from Joseph
Bologna, Bill M'acy, Lainie
Kazan, Cameron Mitchell, Selma
Diamond and, as the junior com
edy writer who worships Swann
and is assigned to keep him out of
trouble, Mark Linn-Baker, a tal
ented young comic with a rubbery
babv face.
Star Wars (1977) ★
Memorial Auditorium
Top-flight entertainment,
made (by George Lucas) with im
agination and great charm. This
science-fiction fantasy about kid
naped princesses, initiations into
mystical knighthoods, and the
struggle for supremacy between
the forces of good and evil, sug
gests a fusion of Tolkien and
Marvel Comics, though Lucas'
major source was clearly the mov
ie version of The Wizard of Oz.
Lucas is not an artist, but in Star
Wars he seems to have found out
how good an entertainer he can
be. With Mark Hamill, Carrie
Fisher, Alec Guinness and (best
of all) Harrison Ford.
Plays Sunday.

Five Easy Pieces (1970)
Kresge Auditorffim
Bob Rafelson directed this fa
mous study in end-of-the-'6os al
ienation, from a screenplay by
Adrien Joyce. It was the movie to
see when it came out: Rafelson
and Joyce made the fury and tor
ment of the hero, a gifted pianist
who has turned his back on his
aristocratic family and the prom
ise of a career, extremely roman
tic, and many at that time shared
his cynical vision of America.
Jack Nicholson's embodiment of
this new kind of angry young man
made him a star. With Susan
Anspach and Karen Black as the
two women who can't make him
happy, and Lois Smith, Billy
Green Bush and Fannie Flagg.
Plays tomorrow night.

Close Encounters of the Third
Kind (1977)
New Varsity, Palo Alto *
Steven Spielberg made this in
effably sweet-natured sci-fi dream
picture with the eye of a child
enchanted by fantasy. It has a
generous spirit; despite his techni
cal mastery, Spielberg com
municates a wide-eyed innocence,
a sense of wonder of his own. One
may complain about the domestic
comedy, which doesn't quite
come off, and about the lumpy
structure, but on the whole the
film is wondrous. Richard
Drevfuss and Melinda Dillon
play two of the chosen who en
counter a party of benevolent ex
traterrestrials. The score by John
Williams is easily his best.
Plays through Sunday with
Raiders of the Lost Ark.

ored and beloved movie. The title
means "the road," and the story
deals, superficially, with the rela
tionship between a travelling
strong man. Zampano (Anthony
Quinn), and an innocent waif he
adopts and brutalizes (Giulietta
Masina). The third character in
this fable about the interplay be
tween brute force and innocence,
body and soul, is an acrobat
(Richard Basehart), a fool who is
also an artist. All three per
formers are magnificent, and the
film represents, along with the fol
lowing year's Nights of Cabiria,
the peak of Feliini's powers as a
filmmaker, before he began to
sacrifice real sensitivity for the
patented, self-adoring kind that
corrupts his later films. Be fore
warned: the final image is a re
markably pure expression of de
spair that you won't be able to
shake off when you leave the thea
ter.

The Man Who Would Be King
(1975)
Fox, Redwood City *
John Huston and Gladys Hill
adapted Rudyard Kipling's su
perb short story, omitting many
of its ambiguities and neutralizing
its controversial political content,

but it's a handsome, highly enter
taining movie nonetheless, and it
contains what is likely Huston's
best sustained direction since the
early 'sos (though his work in be
tween was often fascinating). In a
triumph of casting, Michael
Caine plays the con man adven
turer who sets out to become rich
in a mountain area of India, and
Sean Connery plays his less swift
pal, whose part of the scheme is to
become king of the local tribe. At
first Connerv, with his dark,
bewhiskered balloon face, seems
too big, physically and vocally,
for his role, but as the film pro
ceeds he finds uses for his frame
and his deep, resonant voice: he
takes on the look and sound of the
king. Christopher Plummer is
stuck playing Kipling.

Lost Horizon (1937)
Festival, Palo Alto
James Hilton's enormously
popular Utopian novel was
filmed by Frank Capra, from a
screenplay by Robert Riskin. The
movie's notion of an ideal ex
istence is fairly excruciating: the
inhabitants of a Tibetan moun
tain community, assured of lon
gevity, dodder about in smiling
lethargy while their leader, the
High Lama, intones lethal
platitudes. But the film has pas
sages of suspense and fantasy that
cling to the memory for decades;
Capra was nothing if not a master
craftsman. Ronald Colman,
speaking in that unearthly cul
tivated voice, stars as the questing
outsider, and the cast also in
cludes H. B. Warner, Sam Jaffe,
Isabel Jewell, Thomas Mitchell,

Kresge Auditorium
There's one classic number: the
stultifvingly tasteless opening of
Springtime for Hitler, which para
lyzes its first-night audience. The
problem is that most people who
have seen the entire movie usually
remember this sequence with such
fondness that they've forgotten
how dreadful most of the rest of it
is. Zero Mostel plays a producer
who peddles 25.000 percent of a
new play he is certain will flop,
and naturally it becomes a smash
hit. Mostei's performance goes
way beyond broad to elephantine,

and Mel Brooks' direction (he
also wrote the script) in this, his
debut picture, makes early
Woody Allen look like Renoir.
Luckily, Gene Wilder and Dick
Shawn put their considerable
comic skills to use; Kenneth
Mars, Estelle Winwood and Re

My Favorite Year i
Park,Menio Park
Peter O'Toole's portrayal of
Alan Swann, an Errol Flynn type
notorious for his drunken and
amorous hijinks, begins with the
longest, thinnest wheeze you've

ever heard arid expands from
there. His brilliant performance is
one-half John -Barrymore and
one-half Noel Coward a full
length theatrical send-up, the best
moments of which occur when
he's standing perfectly still. He
provides the ideal contrast to all
the uproarious nervous activity in
this picture, which is set in the
days of live TV comedy. Norman
Steinberg and Dennis Palumbo
wrote the script, which at its best
suggests the Comden and Green
of Singin' in the Rain, and Rich
ard Benjamin, on his first time
out, directed in a wacky, hyper
bolic style. It's an immensely
likable movie, with estimable
contributions from Joseph
Bologna, Bill M'acy, Lainie
Kazan, Cameron Mitchell, Selma
Diamond and, as the junior com
edy writer who worships Swann
and is assigned to keep him out of

Star Wars (1977) ★

Top-flight entertainment,
made (by George Lucas) with im

science-fiction fantasy about kid
naped princesses, initiations into
mystical knighthoods, and the
struggle for supremacy between
the forces of good and evil, sug
gests a fusion of Tolkien and
Marvel Comics, though Lucas'
major source was clearly the mov

Lucas is not an artist, but in Star

how good an entertainer he can
be. With Mark Hamill, Carrie

who has turned his back on his

Close Encounters of the Third

New Varsity, Palo Alto *
Steven Spielberg made this in
effably sweet-natured sci-fi dream
picture with the eye of a child
enchanted by fantasy. It has a
generous spirit; despite his techni
cal mastery, Spielberg com
municates a wide-eyed innocence,
a sense of wonder of his own. One
may complain about the domestic
comedy, which doesn't quite
come off, and about the lumpy
structure, but on the whole the
film is wondrous. Richard
Drevfuss and Melinda Dillon
play two of the chosen who en
counter a party of benevolent ex
traterrestrials. The score by John
Williams is easily his best.
Plays through Sunday with

The director, Vittorio De Sica,
and the screenwriter, Cesare
Zavattim, were famous for shat
tering neo-realist pictures like
Shoeshine and The Bicycle Thief
when they took a holiday with
this enchanting fantasy, based on
Zavattini's novel Toto the Good.
De Siea's humanism and his keen
eye for social injustice are still in
evidence, but the style is a wild
blend of slapstick magic and so
cial satire: fur-collared rich men
bicker over land like bulldogs
growling and yapping at each oth
er, lovers swing from poles and
turn somersaults, a balloon seller
in danger of floating away with
his wares is fed bread by His neigh
bors to weigh him down. This
movie achieves what Jean
Giraudoux attempted in The
Madwoman of Chaillot. Fran
cesco Golissano plays Toto, the

today directors who attempt stud

The4oo Blows. The hero, Antoine

Kresge Auditorium
There's one classic number: the
stultifvingly tasteless opening of
Springtime for Hitler, which para
lyzes its first-night audience. The
problem is that most people who
have seen the entire movie usually
remember this sequence with such
fondness that they've forgotten
how dreadful most of the rest of it
is. Zero Mostel plays a producer
who peddles 25.000 percent of a
new play he is certain will flop,
and naturally it becomes a smash
hit. Mostei's performance goes
way beyond broad to elephantine,

and Mel Brooks' direction (he
also wrote the script) in this, his
debut picture, makes early
Woody Allen look like Renoir.
Luckily, Gene Wilder and Dick
Shawn put their considerable
comic skills to use; Kenneth
Mars, Estelle Winwood and Re
nee Taylor are featured.
Plays tonight.
My Favorite Year i
Park,Menio Park
Peter O'Toole's portrayal of
Alan Swann, an Errol Flynn type
notorious for his drunken and
amorous hijinks, begins with the
longest, thinnest wheeze you've

ever heard arid expands from
there. His brilliant performance is
one-half John -Barrymore and
one-half Noel Coward a full
length theatrical send-up, the best
moments of which occur when
he's standing perfectly still. He
provides the ideal contrast to all
the uproarious nervous activity in
this picture, which is set in the
days of live TV comedy. Norman
Steinberg and Dennis Palumbo
wrote the script, which at its best
suggests the Comden and Green
of Singin' in the Rain, and Rich
ard Benjamin, on his first time
out, directed in a wacky, hyper
bolic style. It's an immensely
likable movie, with estimable
contributions from Joseph
Bologna, Bill M'acy, Lainie
Kazan, Cameron Mitchell, Selma
Diamond and, as the junior com
edy writer who worships Swann
and is assigned to keep him out of
trouble, Mark Linn-Baker, a tal
ented young comic with a rubbery
babv face.
Star Wars (1977) ★
Memorial Auditorium
Top-flight entertainment,
made (by George Lucas) with im
agination and great charm. This
science-fiction fantasy about kid
naped princesses, initiations into
mystical knighthoods, and the
struggle for supremacy between
the forces of good and evil, sug
gests a fusion of Tolkien and
Marvel Comics, though Lucas'
major source was clearly the mov
ie version of The Wizard of Oz.
Lucas is not an artist, but in Star
Wars he seems to have found out
how good an entertainer he can
be. With Mark Hamill, Carrie
Fisher, Alec Guinness and (best
of all) Harrison Ford.
Plays Sunday.

Five Easy Pieces (1970)
Kresge Auditorffim
Bob Rafelson directed this fa
mous study in end-of-the-'6os al
ienation, from a screenplay by
Adrien Joyce. It was the movie to
see when it came out: Rafelson
and Joyce made the fury and tor
ment of the hero, a gifted pianist
who has turned his back on his
aristocratic family and the prom
ise of a career, extremely roman
tic, and many at that time shared
his cynical vision of America.
Jack Nicholson's embodiment of
this new kind of angry young man
made him a star. With Susan
Anspach and Karen Black as the
two women who can't make him
happy, and Lois Smith, Billy
Green Bush and Fannie Flagg.

Close Encounters of the Third
Kind (1977)
New Varsity, Palo Alto *
Steven Spielberg made this in
effably sweet-natured sci-fi dream
picture with the eye of a child
enchanted by fantasy. It has a
generous spirit; despite his techni
cal mastery, Spielberg com
municates a wide-eyed innocence,
a sense of wonder of his own. One
may complain about the domestic
comedy, which doesn't quite
come off, and about the lumpy
structure, but on the whole the
film is wondrous. Richard
Drevfuss and Melinda Dillon
play two of the chosen who en
counter a party of benevolent ex
traterrestrials. The score by John
Williams is easily his best.
Plays through Sunday with
Raiders of the Lost Ark.

★ Highly recommended

Miracle in Milan *
New Varsity, Palo Alto
The director, Vittorio De Sica,
and the screenwriter, Cesare
Zavattim, were famous for shat
tering neo-realist pictures like
Shoeshine and The Bicycle Thief
when they took a holiday with
this enchanting fantasy, based on
Zavattini's novel Toto the Good.
De Siea's humanism and his keen
eye for social injustice are still in
evidence, but the style is a wild
blend of slapstick magic and so
cial satire: fur-collared rich men
bicker over land like bulldogs
growling and yapping at each oth
er, lovers swing from poles and
turn somersaults, a balloon seller
in danger of floating away with
his wares is fed bread by His neigh
bors to weigh him down. This
movie achieves what Jean
Giraudoux attempted in The
Madwoman of Chaillot. Fran
cesco Golissano plays Toto, the
saintly idiot who saves his com
munity, Brunella Bovo plays the
girl he loves, and Emma Gram
matica gives a joyous per
formance as the merry, magical
old woman who raises Toto.
Plays Thursday only with La

The 400 Blows (1959) ★
Kresge Auditorium
Francois Truffaut's film,
which ends with the most famous
freeze frame in movie history, is a
melancholy study of an unhappy
adolescence. It touched the im
agination of audiences not only in
France but here as well, and even
today directors who attempt stud
ies of teenage rites of passage in
variably risk comparisons with
The4oo Blows. The hero, Antoine
Doinel, is played by 15-year-old
Jean-Pierre Leaud; Truffaut re-

turned to Doinel in four subse
quent pictures ( Love at Twenty,
Stolen Kisses, Bed and Board,
Love on the Run, but they were ro
mantic comedies that seem trivial
when you watch the original.
Leaud has never again equaled his
acting here.
Plays Monday night.
La Strada (1956) ★
New Varsity, Palo Alto
Federico Feliini's most hon
ored and beloved movie. The title
means "the road," and the story
deals, superficially, with the rela
tionship between a travelling
strong man. Zampano (Anthony
Quinn), and an innocent waif he
adopts and brutalizes (Giulietta
Masina). The third character in
this fable about the interplay be
tween brute force and innocence,
body and soul, is an acrobat
(Richard Basehart), a fool who is
also an artist. All three per
formers are magnificent, and the
film represents, along with the fol
lowing year's Nights of Cabiria,
the peak of Feliini's powers as a
filmmaker, before he began to
sacrifice real sensitivity for the
patented, self-adoring kind that
corrupts his later films. Be fore
warned: the final image is a re
markably pure expression of de
spair that you won't be able to
shake off when you leave the thea
ter.

The Man Who Would Be King
(1975)
Fox, Redwood City *
John Huston and Gladys Hill
adapted Rudyard Kipling's su
perb short story, omitting many
of its ambiguities and neutralizing
its controversial political content,

but it's a handsome, highly enter
taining movie nonetheless, and it
contains what is likely Huston's
best sustained direction since the
early 'sos (though his work in be
tween was often fascinating). In a
triumph of casting, Michael
Caine plays the con man adven
turer who sets out to become rich
in a mountain area of India, and
Sean Connery plays his less swift
pal, whose part of the scheme is to
become king of the local tribe. At
first Connerv, with his dark,
bewhiskered balloon face, seems
too big, physically and vocally,
for his role, but as the film pro
ceeds he finds uses for his frame
and his deep, resonant voice: he
takes on the look and sound of the
king. Christopher Plummer is
stuck playing Kipling.
