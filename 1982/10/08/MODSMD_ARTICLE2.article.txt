Market hits record high

New York Wall Street exploded into a record-breaking trading frenzy
yesterday, a buying spree that was fed by falling interest rates and which
swept stock, bond and gold prices sharply higher.
The rally powered the Dow Jones industrial average 21.71 points higher to
965.97. That came on the heels of a 37.07-point gain Wednesday, which was
the second-largest daily increase ever for the closely watched average.
Trading volume totaled a record 147.07 million shares at the New York
Stock Exchange, a level that kept the tape that reports stock trades running
behind throughout the day. The previous record was 137.33 million set Aug.
26.
And rates were falling throughout the day in the money markets. The val
ue of long-term Treasury bonds to jumped by nearly $4O for each $lOOO in
face value, one of the largest increases in a single day. The yield on one-year
Treasury bills was down two-thirds of a percentage point.
In the stock market, four issues gained in price for each that fell on the
NYSE. And 407 of the 1966 issues on the Big Board hit individual highs for
the year. Six fell to new lows.
The NYSE's most-active list was topped by American Telephone & Tele
graph, which rose 1 to 59Vi. International Business Machines was up 1% to
80%,-General Motors rose P/2 to 50, Tandy Corp. 1% to 32V4 and Warner
Communications 17/8t045.l 7 /8to45.
Johnson & Johnson, whose subsidiary makes Extra-Strength Tylenol, was
the third most-heavily traded stock. It fell 1 3 /s to 40%. Seven people have died
from cyanide-contaminated Tylenol capsules.
Many analysts were baffled by the market's rally, saying that the econom
ic indicators pointed to continued recession, a situation that does not justify
rising stock prices. '
The drop in interest rates undercut the U.S. dollar in foreign exchange
trading around the world as speculators sought higher yields by investing in
other currencies.

Lebanese unveil PLO tunnels

Beirut An elaborate tunnel network under West Beirut served as a "city
within a city" for Palestinian guerrillas complete with an amusement cen
ter and torture chamber, security sources said yesterday.
They also said that the international terrorist Carlos used the tunnels to
meet with Palestine Liberation Organization guerrillas.
The sources said the four-mile network ran from the Sabra and Chatilla
refugee camps to Bourj el-Barajneh next to the airport, and was packed with
arms, forged passports and stolen cars.
The tunnels were discovered late last month, the sources said.
In other Lebanese developments:
—U.S. envoy Philip Habib met in Washington with top Rea
gan administration officials to refine a plan for the phased with
drawal of Israeli, Syrian and Palestinian forces from Lebanon,
followed by the recall of the 1200 U.S. Marines in the peace
keeping force.
—lsraeli officials in Jerusalem, in an apparent softening of
earlier positions, said the Palestine Liberation Organization
could pull out in stages with the Syrian army, but that all PLO
fighters must be out before the last phase of the Syrian and Israeli
pullout.
—Lebanese army troops arrested 175 more people in West
Beirut, bringing to more than 1000 the number seized since last
week in what the military calls a campaign to pacify the Moslem
sector of the capital. The Palestinians fear the drive is to terrorize
them and' force them to leave the country.
Israel invaded Lebanon June 6 to rout the Palestinian guer
rillas, and thousands of PLO fighters were evacuated from west
Beirut in August. Thousands remained, however, in northern
Tripoli and behind Syrian lines in eastern Lebanon's Bekaa Val
ley.
The Syrians have been in Lebanon for six years, ostensibly
policing the armistice that ended the 1975-76 Moslem-Christian
civil war.
Federal Reserve lowers interest rates
Washington The Federal Reserve, seeing no recovery ahead
for a desperately weak economy, has decided to ease credit con
ditions and force interest rates down in a significant shift of poli
cy, sources said yesterday.
The Fed's decision, at a private meeting of its policy group on
Tuesday, came just ahead of today's unemployment report,
which is expected to show the jobless rate at 10 percent or higher
for the first time since World War 11. Based on an extraordinarily
gloomy assessment of the economy for the next three to six
months, the Federal Reserve decided it must administer a shot in
the arm to end the recession with lower interest rates and more
cash at least for the immediate future.
The Fed is also increasingly worried about dangers to the
banking system if the economy stays weak and interest rates stay
high.
Despite the dismal outlook for the economy, stocks and bonds
soared yesterday amid record-breaking volume, on hopes that
the Fed will back off from strict monetarism and let interest rates
fall further.
The Fed's action comes a month before the congressional
midterm elections, which have become a referendum on Presi
dent Reagan's economic policies. Many members of Congress
and private economists have been pushing for a policy shift by
the Fed which, they say, could revive the battered economy. Al
though the Reagan administration will likely claim credit if in
terest rates do fall and spark a recovery, the president has gener
ally supported the Fed's tight money policy.
The Fed believes that its M 1 money measure, which includes
cash and all checking accounts, is going to be heavily distorted in
coming weeks with a flood of money into people's accounts as
the popular All-Savers Certificates expire and banking changes
in the wake of a new law just passed by Congress.
It has thus decided effectively to abandon its Ml money
targets for the next few weeks and concentrate policy on interest
rates and the broader M 2 measure, which includes passbook sav
ings accounts and money market funds, sources said.

The Federal Reserve was faced this week with deciding wheth
er to tighten credit conditions in order to bring money supply
growth back on target or whether to allow money to continue to
overshoot its targets and attempt to bring interest rates down to
aid the economy. The central bank's adherence to tight control
of the money supply has been blamed for the persistent high in
terest rates that have pushed the economy into recession and
kept it there.
More seek jobless benefits
Washington Nearly 700,000 more Americans sought jobless
benefits late last month, the government said yesterday. This
came on the eve of the expected release of figures showing the
highest unemployment level since the waning days of the Great
Depression.
For the seventh consecutive week, first-time claims for un
employment checks surpassed the 600,000-level considered by
economists as a clear signal of a pending rise in the overall jobless
rate.
That rate was 9.8 percent of the work force in August, so a
fractional 0.2 percent rise would produce double-digit un
employment.
The latest Claims Figures, reported by the Labor Department,
revealed that 697,000 people completed forms at local em
ployment offices to test their eligibility for 26 weeks of govern
ment checks.
The claims filings for the week ending Sept. 25 fell 6000 short
of the record-setting 703,000 first-time claims placed the pre
vious week, according to the Employment and Training Admin
istration.
Tylenol extortion plot investigated
Chicago Authorities are investigating an alleged $1 million
extortion plot in connection with seven Chicago-area deaths
from cyanide-laced Extra-Strength Tylenol, published reports
said today.
The Chicago Sun-Times said the FBI was investigating a man
who allegedly mailed a letter to the manufacturers of Tylenol de
manding $ 1 million and implying that more poisonings might oc
cur if the ransom was not paid.
The newspaper reported that unidentified sources said the
man was a Chicago businessman and former successful stock
broker who had suffered financial "reverses."
The letter was reportedly mailed to Johnson & Johnson in Pa
terson, N.J., but it was not disclosed if it was mailed before seven
people died after taking cyanide-contaminated Extra-Strength
Tylenol capsules last week.
The Sun-Times said the letter threatened a "repeat" of the
Tylenol poisonings unless $1 million was sent to a postal box at
Continental Illinois National Bank & Trust Co. of Chicago.
Israel changes stance
Jerusalem The Israeli government, in an apparent sharp
switch of policy, indicated yesterday that it would not insist that
Palestinian guerrilla forces be withdrawn from Lebanon before
its own troops leave.
The change appeared to increase sharply the chances for a suc
cessful conclusion to the negotiations now underway to arrange
the pullout of Israeli, Syrian and Palestine Liberation Organiza
tion forces from Lebanon.
A Foreign Ministry official said yesterday that Israel will set

"no preconditions" on the negotiations.
U.S. envoy Morris Draper, came to Israel Tuesday to relay to
Prime Minister Menachem Begin and other senior officials the
results of his preliminary talks in Damascus with Syrian Presi
dent Hafez Assad and others on the withdrawal question.
Until now, most Israeli officials have insisted that PLO units
based in northern and eastern Lebanon depart before any evac
uation of Israeli troops takes place.
Draper met here Tuesday evening with Begin, Defense Min
ister Ariel Sharon and officials of the Foreign Ministry. After
wards, sources said that Begin had been adamant that the PLO
forces had to leave Lebanon before the phased withdrawal of
Syrian and Israeli troops could start.
Sub still eludes Swedes
Berga, Sweden Sweden's efforts to capture a foreign sub
marine thought to be trapped underwater in a military zone seem
no closer to success now than six days ago when the search
began, the naval officer directing the hunt-conceded yesterday.
"We are under pressure to do something spectacular, and the
conditions are very difficult," said Vice Adm. Bror Steffenson,
chief of the defense staff. As to whether the hunt might ever suc
ceed, Steffenson said softly, "In my heart I'm very uncertain."
The expectations of early success in capturing what spokes
men still believe is probably some kind of Soviet submarine arose
from several factors. When the vessel was spotted last Friday it
was so close to the country's most sensitive naval installation
that resources were quickly mobilized to block its movement.
Western diplomats who generally are kept fully informed by
the Swedes on matters such as this say they have found their
sources increasingly reticent. "It is possible they are preparing
the people for disappointment," said one diplomat, noting that
after the buildup the letdown would be a big one.
Another possibility is that the Swedish military is seeking a
major new commitment to anti-submarine defenses from the in
coming Socialist government of Olof Palme and hopes to use this
incident toward that goal no matter how it comes out.
Soviet theft thwarted
Washington Defense Secretary Caspar Weinberger said yes
terday the Soviets attempted to steal a device vital to air and sat
ellite reconnaissance, but the equipment was intercepted before
leaving the United States.
Weinberger mentioned this briefly in a speech in which he ac
cused the Soviets of using both legal and illegal methods "to raid
our technological base."
"They tried to steal a multispectral scanner, which is in
dispensable to military air and satellite reconnaissance," Wein
berger said in a speech prepared for the American League for Ex
ports and Assistance.
Experts said the scanner is used to monitor voice communica
tions.
Weinberger gave no other details, but Pentagon sources said
the incident occurred early this year and that the shipment was
prevented by agents working under a Treasury Department op
eration called "Exodus."
Today s weather
Fair and warmer today. Temperatures should range in the up
per 60s to low 70s. Northwest winds around 20 mph.
