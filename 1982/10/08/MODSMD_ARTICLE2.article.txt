Market hits record high

New York Wall Street exploded into a record-breaking trading frenzy
yesterday, a buying spree that was fed by falling interest rates and which
swept stock, bond and gold prices sharply higher.
The rally powered the Dow Jones industrial average 21.71 points higher to
965.97. That came on the heels of a 37.07-point gain Wednesday, which was
the second-largest daily increase ever for the closely watched average.
Trading volume totaled a record 147.07 million shares at the New York
Stock Exchange, a level that kept the tape that reports stock trades running
behind throughout the day. The previous record was 137.33 million set Aug.
26.
And rates were falling throughout the day in the money markets. The val
ue of long-term Treasury bonds to jumped by nearly $4O for each $lOOO in
face value, one of the largest increases in a single day. The yield on one-year
Treasury bills was down two-thirds of a percentage point.
In the stock market, four issues gained in price for each that fell on the
NYSE. And 407 of the 1966 issues on the Big Board hit individual highs for
the year. Six fell to new lows.
The NYSE's most-active list was topped by American Telephone & Tele
graph, which rose 1 to 59Vi. International Business Machines was up 1% to
80%,-General Motors rose P/2 to 50, Tandy Corp. 1% to 32V4 and Warner
Communications 17/8t045.l 7 /8to45.
Johnson & Johnson, whose subsidiary makes Extra-Strength Tylenol, was
the third most-heavily traded stock. It fell 1 3 /s to 40%. Seven people have died
from cyanide-contaminated Tylenol capsules.
Many analysts were baffled by the market's rally, saying that the econom
ic indicators pointed to continued recession, a situation that does not justify
rising stock prices. '
The drop in interest rates undercut the U.S. dollar in foreign exchange
trading around the world as speculators sought higher yields by investing in
other currencies.

Lebanese unveil PLO tunnels

Beirut An elaborate tunnel network under West Beirut served as a "city
within a city" for Palestinian guerrillas complete with an amusement cen
ter and torture chamber, security sources said yesterday.
They also said that the international terrorist Carlos used the tunnels to
meet with Palestine Liberation Organization guerrillas.
The sources said the four-mile network ran from the Sabra and Chatilla
refugee camps to Bourj el-Barajneh next to the airport, and was packed with
arms, forged passports and stolen cars.
The tunnels were discovered late last month, the sources said.
