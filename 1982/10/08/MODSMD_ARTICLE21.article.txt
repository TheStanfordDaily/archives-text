## Spyro Gyra goes Incognito and loses its way

Spyro Gyra just blew it.
On the verge of establishing
themselves as a true power in the
jazz/fusion world, Spyro Gyra
tried too hard.
They went a-recruiting and re
cruited too well. Though they
ended up with some of fusion's
top stars, the strong teamwork

evident on past LPs was lost in
the process. The players that
don't have the big names, but did
the "little things" no one noticed,
have been relegated to the bench.
Consequently, Spyro Gyra's
newest album, Incognito, is by far
their worst effort, and for all
practical purposes a musical dis
aster.
But Spyro Gyra is kind of like
the New York Yankees of late in
their marketing techniques. They

have the big names and will draw
the large crowds; in this case,
they will sell albums.
The two most recent additions
to Spyro Gyra are drummer
Steve Gadd and bassist Marcus
Miller, both of whom are the top
studio musicians at their respec
tive instruments in today's fusion
industry. Both are capable of
doing just about anything with
their instruments and both are
fine concert players. Both are hu

man, too.
The problem with acquiring
personnel like Gadd and Miller is
that they incorporate their own
styles into the music they are
playing, for better or for worse.
In the case of Spyro Gyra, it is the
latter.
Gadd and Miller have played
as studio musicians on umpteen
other albums this past year,
something all too audible. The
fusion industry is suffering from
blandness because Gadd and
Miller play on everybody's damn
album the same damn way every
damn time. Miller insists on
"popping" his bass on every song
while Gadd uses his high hat and
snare with little or no imagina
tion.

In fact, so similar do Miller's
basslines in his recent per
formance on David Sanborn's
latest LP (As We Speak) sound to
his efforts on Incognito that it
would not be surprising if he sim
ply had recorded identical
basslines for the two albums.
Perhaps the real reason that
Spyro Gyra used such famous
studio musicians is for their
names. A person is more likely to
purchase an album with identi
fiable names like Gadd and
Miller as opposed to Will Lee or
Eli Konikoff, the group's trav
eling bassist amd drummer. And
Spyro Gyra makes sure the con
sumer is aware that Steve Gadd
and Marcus Miller are on In
cognito they placed the line-up
of musicians on the back of the
LP, something that was solely re
served for the inner sleeve on past
albums. The idea before was to
sell Spyro Grya the group, not
Spyro Gyra featuring Steve
Gadd and Marcus Miller, as is
too obviously the case in 1982.
The biggest problem with In
cognito is not the songs them
selves, but the way they are
played. In Spyro Gyra's Great

American Music Hall concert
this summer, they unveiled three
of the new tunes from Incognito
with relative success. But one has
to realize that the personnel that
played in concert did so in a way
that made the songs more appeal
ing and less like Gadd and Miller
wrote them. With proper treat
ment, Incognito had the chance to
become Spyro Gyra's best record
on record. But somewhere be
tween the concert hall and the
studio, something went wrong.
Actually, what went wrong
was in the studio or, more specifi
cally, who was in the studio. Only
four of the LP's eight tracks even
barely resemble a typical Spyro
Gyra song. The four that don't
could be legit Sypro Grya tunes,
but feature extremely static
basslines laid down by Gadd and
Miller that prevent soloists Jay
Beckenstein (saxophone) and
Tom Schuman (keyboards) from
going anywhere.
Miller's "pops" bring out the
bass too prominently, a charac
teristic that has no place in the
group's music. No longer do the
songs climax in a guitar solo with
intense horns; instead the funky,
though boring, beat goes on and
on. And on. When the songs
finally end, it is more of a blessing
than a pity.
Incognito has its bright spots,
however. The LP's best-tune is
"Old San Juan," written by band
leader and saxophone regular
Beckenstein, as it sets the Puerto
Rican scene with keyboards and
a realistic sax melody. Guitarist
Steve Love, another Incognito
only addition, plays perhaps the
best Sypro Gyra guitar solo ever,
blending into the flavor of the
song magnificently while keeping
his notes and riffs simple.
"Old San Juan" is followed by
another Beckenstein composi
tion, "Harbor Lights," a slower
song, but one that flows in away

similar to Spyro Gyra tunes of
old. Another excellent song on
the otherwise dull album is
"Sueno," written by keyboardist
Jeremy Wall. The song is the only
one on Incognito that includes the
heavy Latin percussion and
marimbas that made Spyro Gyra
famous. The LP's closing piece,
"Soho Mojo," is the type that
will be an fine concert tune and is
reminiscent of "String Soup"

from Freetime, the group's 1981
release.
Nevertheless, at first listening,
one honestly believes the wrong
record was placed inside a Spyro
Gyra cover it takes you by sur
prise. And if Spyro Grya doesn't
make a 180 degree turn from
where they presently stand, the
unemployment line may take
them by surprise.
