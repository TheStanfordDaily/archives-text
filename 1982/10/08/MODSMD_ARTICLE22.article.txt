## Women spikers surprise No. 1 San Diego State 
### STEPHEN STRENG 
The Stanford women's vol
leyball team pulled off a major
upset last night, stunning No. 1-
ranked San Diego State at
Maples Pavilion. The Cardinal
defeated the Aztecs in convincing
fashion, winning 15-9, 13-15,
15-8 and 16-14.
In the final game, Stanford
jumped to a quick 6-2 lead, and
eventually increased it to 12-5.
Fearing defeat, the Aztecs came
roaring back to take the lead at
14-13.
Stanford regained momentum
when the Cardinal's junior setter,
Kari Rush, scored an impressive
side-out down the length of the
net to give the Cardinal the serve
and an eventual 15-14 lead.

The Aztecs had one last chance
to stave off defeat, regaining the
serve, but Deanna Boyette scored
a side-out to give the Card the
ball and set up the following
16-14 win.
After the match the coaching
staff was elated. "It was our
night," said Don Shaw, Stanford
assistant coach. "On any given
night, through the top nine
(ranked teams), any team can
beat any other."
Shaw admitted that Stanford
had made a defensive adjustment
since the Cardinal's last meeting
with SDSU, a 3-1 defeat. The
Cardinal also appeared to much

more inspired for this match.
The win lifted the fifth-ranked
Cardinal to 2-1 in league play,
tying them for second in the West
Coast Athletic Association. It
was San Diego State's first league
loss, dropping the Aztecs to 15-2
overall.
The first game was close all the
way when, with Stanford leading
10-8, Cardinal freshman middle
blocker Kim Oden ripped off
four straight points. Oden played
well all night for Stanford despite
being listed as doubtful before
the game due to a sprained foot.
At the outset, the second game
imitated the first, with
sophomore outside hitter Susan
Compton launching killers from
midcourt. San Diego, however,
sparked by the play of junior
middle blocker Vicki Cantrell,
took the lead at 11-10 and never
looked back.
In the crucial third game, the
Cardinal jumped out to a 3-0 lead
and then erupted to a 14-2 advan
tage as Oden and senior outside
hitter Boyette dominated the
Aztecs.
Stanford faltered momentari
ly, however, as SDSU reeled off
six straight points, led by outside
hitter Sue Hegerle. The Aztec
junior ranged from side-to-side,
retrieving everything hit to the
backcourt. But the Cardinal re
covered in enough time to secure
the win.
Tonight the Cardinal takes on
Long Beach State in a conference
match at Maples Pavilion at 7:30
p.m. "Hopefully, we won't have
a psychological letdown," said
Shaw, "but we don't know any
thing about this team (Long
Beach) and maybe the girls will
be expecting the best."
Last night, the Cardinal defi
nitely played its best
