# ASU 5-0, ranked 11th nationally
## Stanford journeys to desert to face nation's top defense 
### SID SPAETH 
The Stanford aerial circus
challenges the nation's stingiest
defense in Pacific-10 conference
play in Tempe, Arizona tomor
row.
John Elway's aerial spraying
has peppered defenses for more
than 1500 yards in just four 1982
games while the Arizona State
defense has allowed only 512
yards passing in five games.
The Sun Devils lead the Pacif
ic-10 Conference in every de
fensive category. The Cardinal
ranks eighth in total defense, but
has shown marked improvement
each week.
Conversely, Stanford leads the
Pac-10 in total offense by a wide
margin while Arizona State
ranks seventh.
Stanford's biggest worry, how
ever, is its injuries.
"We were lucky coming off the
Ohio State win when we had a lot
of guys banged up to be able to
come back and play Oregon
State," Elway said.
But injuries mounted against
Oregon State and coach Paul
Wiggin lamented, "We had too
many guys limping up the hill."
The Cardinal incurred 14 in
juries, but none were serious.
Injured players included Garin
Veris, Chris Dressel, Tom Briehl,
Tripp Hardin, Jeff Deaton, Jim
Clymer, Vaughn Williams, Barry
Cromer, Rod Gilmore, Dennis
Engel, Mike Teeuws, Dave
Marohnic, Bob Jansen and Vic

tor Mowatt. Vincent White also
sat out Saturday's game. All are
expected to be able to play
tomorrow.

Oregon State sacked Elway
five times last weekend and Ari
zona State will put on a potential
ly better frontal assault.
The Sun Devil defense has am
bushed quarterbacks 30 times
and is led by All-America safety
Mike Richardson, pre-season
All-America linebacker Vernon
Maxwell, end Jim Jeffcoat, line
backer Jimmy Williams and end
Bryan Caldwell.
The Sun Devils, ranked 11th
nationally by The Associated
Press and fourth by The New
York Times poll, are also
bolstered by two-time all-Pac-10
punter Mike Black and
placekicker Luis Zendejas.

The Stanford offense has
rolled up 480 yards and 33.5
points per game this season. They
will probably be less fortunate
tomorrow.
The Arizona State offense was
decimated by graduation after
their 62-36 blowout over Stan
ford last year, but retain a pow
erful running game with tailback
Willie Gittens and fullback
Dwaine Wright.
The passing combination of
quarterback Todd Hons and split
end Doug Allen has been medi
ocre, but carries big-play poten
tial.
The Cardinal defense has im
proved with age.

After stumbling into only eight
interceptions last year, Stan
ford's starting secondary of
Kevin Baird, Eric Price, Charles
Hutchings and Vaughn Williams
has combined for 10 of the team's
conference-leading 13 intercep
tions.
Gary Wimmer has led the
tackling detail with 43 followed
by nose guard Terry Jackson
with 30.
"I think our defense has played
excellently," Wiggin said.
"We've been drastically im
proved all over. It's kind of a no
name defense, but we're faster
and playing better."
Wiggin also said he was glad
Oregon State put a lot of pressure
on Elway.
"I think it was to our advan
tage that Oregon State played
well defensively," he said. "It was
a tough week for us. A transition
week. We know they (ASU) are a
blitzing team and we had to pre
pare for that."
Wiggin said he is looking for
"quite a battle" between "the na
tion's best defense" and "one of
the nation's best offenses."
Last year, Arizona State and
Stanford set five NCAA and 11
conference marks in their contest
at Stanford.
Former ASU quarterback
Mike Pagel threw for 466 yards
and seven TD's while a combined
Elway-Steve Cottrell effort am
massed 581 passing yards in the
losing effort.

The Stanford aerial circus
challenges the nation's stingiest
defense in Pacific-10 conference
play in Tempe, Arizona tomor
row.
John Elway's aerial spraying
has peppered defenses for more
than 1500 yards in just four 1982
games while the Arizona State
defense has allowed only 512
yards passing in five games.
The Sun Devils lead the Pacif
ic-10 Conference in every de
fensive category. The Cardinal
ranks eighth in total defense, but
has shown marked improvement
each week.
Conversely, Stanford leads the
Pac-10 in total offense by a wide
margin while Arizona State
ranks seventh.
Stanford's biggest worry, how
ever, is its injuries.
"We were lucky coming off the
Ohio State win when we had a lot
of guys banged up to be able to
come back and play Oregon
State," Elway said.
But injuries mounted against
Oregon State and coach Paul
Wiggin lamented, "We had too
many guys limping up the hill."
The Cardinal incurred 14 in
juries, but none were serious.
Injured players included Garin
Veris, Chris Dressel, Tom Briehl,
Tripp Hardin, Jeff Deaton, Jim
Clymer, Vaughn Williams, Barry
Cromer, Rod Gilmore, Dennis
Engel, Mike Teeuws, Dave
Marohnic, Bob Jansen and Vic

tor Mowatt. Vincent White also
sat out Saturday's game. All are
expected to be able to play
tomorrow.

Oregon State sacked Elway
five times last weekend and Ari
zona State will put on a potential
ly better frontal assault.
The Sun Devil defense has am
bushed quarterbacks 30 times
and is led by All-America safety
Mike Richardson, pre-season
All-America linebacker Vernon
Maxwell, end Jim Jeffcoat, line
backer Jimmy Williams and end
Bryan Caldwell.
The Sun Devils, ranked 11th
nationally by The Associated
Press and fourth by The New
York Times poll, are also
bolstered by two-time all-Pac-10
punter Mike Black and
placekicker Luis Zendejas.

The Stanford offense has
rolled up 480 yards and 33.5
points per game this season. They
will probably be less fortunate
tomorrow.
The Arizona State offense was
decimated by graduation after
their 62-36 blowout over Stan
ford last year, but retain a pow
erful running game with tailback
Willie Gittens and fullback
Dwaine Wright.
The passing combination of
quarterback Todd Hons and split
end Doug Allen has been medi
ocre, but carries big-play poten
tial.
The Cardinal defense has im
proved with age.

After stumbling into only eight
interceptions last year, Stan
ford's starting secondary of
Kevin Baird, Eric Price, Charles
Hutchings and Vaughn Williams
has combined for 10 of the team's
conference-leading 13 intercep
tions.
Gary Wimmer has led the
tackling detail with 43 followed
by nose guard Terry Jackson
with 30.
"I think our defense has played
excellently," Wiggin said.
"We've been drastically im
proved all over. It's kind of a no
name defense, but we're faster
and playing better."
Wiggin also said he was glad
Oregon State put a lot of pressure
on Elway.
"I think it was to our advan
tage that Oregon State played
well defensively," he said. "It was
a tough week for us. A transition
week. We know they (ASU) are a
blitzing team and we had to pre
pare for that."
Wiggin said he is looking for
"quite a battle" between "the na
tion's best defense" and "one of
the nation's best offenses."
Last year, Arizona State and
Stanford set five NCAA and 11
conference marks in their contest
at Stanford.
Former ASU quarterback
Mike Pagel threw for 466 yards
and seven TD's while a combined
Elway-Steve Cottrell effort am
massed 581 passing yards in the
losing effort.

Maxwell pulls down Stanford fullback Greg Hooper in the
Sun Devils' 62-36 victory last year at Stanford Stadium. Maxwell

now a senior, is a main reason why ASU-is ranked No. 1 in
the nation in defense. The Cardinal will face Maxwell and his
undefeated Sun Devil teammates tomorrow night in Tempe, Ariz.
