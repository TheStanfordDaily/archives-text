# Cards' For sch tosses shutout in first game
## 
### Associated Press 
St. Louis Veteran Bob Forsch pitched a three-hitter and the St.
Louis Cardinals staged a record-breaking rally that produced a 7-0
victory over the Atlanta Braves in last night's opening game of the
best-of-five National League Championship Series.
Forsch, who is the senior member of this Cardinal club, was
brilliant in mowing the Braves down, striking out six while walking
none, and protecting an early one-run lead built on the blazing speed
of rookie Willie McGee. The pitcher, who retired the last 11 batters in
a row, also contributed a sacrifice fly in a five-run St. Louis rally in the
sixth that wrapped up the victory, and scored in the eighth inning after
his second single of the game.
Atlanta will try to even the series tonight with 43-year-old knuck
leballer Phil Niekro coming back after pitching 4'/3 innings in the
rained-out opener of the series Wednesday. The Cardinals will start
rookie John Stuper.
McGee got the Cards started, opening the third inning with a shot
past first baseman Chris Chambliss and into the right field corner.
McGee turned on his afterburners when he saw the ball rattling into
the corner.

What the youngster did not see was right fielder Claudell Washing
ton slip chasing the hit and Coach Chuck Hiller waving frantically to
go for the inside-the-park homer. Instead, he pulled up at third and
when he realized what had happened, it was too late to change his
mind.
It was a rookie mistake but it didn't hurt because Ozzie Smith fol
lowed with a sacrifice fly that brought McGee streaking home with the
game's first run.
The score by the Cardinals, who had 14 hits, came a half inning after
the Braves had their best shot at Forsch.
With one out in the Atlanta third, Bruce Benedict reached on an
error by third baseman Ken Oberkfell. But pitcher Pascual Perez was
unable to execute the sacrifice and struck out bunting foul on the,final
strike. It was a costly failure because Washington followed with At
lanta's first hit of the game. Benedict advanced to third, but was
stranded when Rafael Ramirez forced Washington at second.
