# Second-ranked Cardinal to host 'Big Splash' tomorrow
## Poloists face Berkeley, SF State this weekend

By CHRIS ADDINGTON
. The national college water
polo rankings came out on Mon
day, and with its placing, Stan
ford asserted that it is in definite
contention for another NCAA ti
tle. The 11-2 Cardinal moved
into second place in the country
after a resounding victory over
UC-Berkeley in last weekend's
NorCal tourney. Stanford's first
true test, however, awaits them
this weekend.
The Cardinal faces San Fran
cisco State this afternoon at 3
p.m., and then tomorrow at 11
a.m. hosts the Bears in Stanford's
first league game. Both games are
at deGuerre Pool.
"This is our most important
game of the year so far," said
Card head coach Dante Det
tamanti, referring to the Berkeley
rematch. "The league record is
an important factor in de
termining who goes to the
NCAAs."
The Cardinal split its last two
games with Cal, losing in the
Irvine tournament and winning
last weekend's match. Dettaman
ti, however, said he feels confi
dent of his team's ability.
"Cal's strdng point is their de
fense," he said. "They really
don't have a strong two-meter

man, and they don't score many
goals on their set offense."
When asked about the
Cardinal game plan, Dettamanti
added, "We have to stay out of
ejection situations while capital
izing on any Berkeley man
downs."
Dettamanti's analysis is well
taken, and judging from past re
sults, appears valid. In the Nor-
Cal game, Berkeley scored on
only two of five man-up situ
ations, while the Cardinal found
the mark on four of five. Those
two goals made the difference in
the 8-6 final score.
Besides having to deal with the
pressure associated with such an
important game, Stanford also
has a nagging list of injuries to
their starters. Senior Greg Lam
bert has been out with a
punctured ear drum. Junior two
meter man Curtis Hanst has re
curring shoulder problems, and
senior James Bergeson has been
fighting the flu. Both Hanst and
Bergeson are expected to start in
tomorrow's confrontation, how
ever.
The undefeated Stanford jun
ior varsity will open tomorrow's
action with a 9:30 game against
the Cal JV s.
