# Official Daily, KZSU picks with guest greek
## 
### 
Guest Greek is a weekly feature of the Daily
sports section, where we find some unsuspecting
soul to put his predictive powers on the line against
the greek gods themselves, Daily sports editors
Steve Odell and Sid Spaeth. Also on the slate is
KZSU sports director Tom Kohn and the latest
line from Las Vegas.

This week's Guest Greek is Stanford sports in
formation director and Elway-Heisman pusher
Bob Rose. The only upset this week will be if Rose
doesn't go 10-0, what with his diminutive ex
perience in the field. For his picks, as well as the
others, see below.
