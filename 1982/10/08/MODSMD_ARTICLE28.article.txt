# Angels try for sweep

### Associated Press 
Milwaukee Slugger Reggie
Jackson says it's time to stop us
ing the term "suspect" to de
scribe California's pitching staff.

In what had been billed as a
showdown of two of the most ex
plosive lineups in baseball, the
Angels have made it a mismatch
so far, taking a 2-0 lead over the
Milwaukee Brewers in the best
of-five American League cham
pionship series. *
The Brewers, who led the ma
jor leagues in home runs, runs
scored, runs batted in and total
bases during the regular season,
have been held to 12 hits and a
â€¢ 182 batting average by Angel
veterans Tommy John and Bruce
Kison.
Geoff Zahn, 18-8 during the
regular season, will pitch for the
Angels against Milwaukee's Don
Sutton, 4-1, in the thifd game
here Friday afternoon. Since in
traleague playoffs began in 1969,
no team has won a championship
series after having lost the first

two games.
Games 4 and 5, if needed,
would be played here Saturday
and Sunday.
"I think you should remember
that the guys on the mound get
paid, too, said Jackson, who
homered in the Angels' 4-2 vic
tory in Anaheim on Tuesday
night. "This series isn't over yet,
but we shouldn't be talking about
being surprised by our pitching."
John neutralized Milwaukee's
power with his sinker pitches,
forcing Brewer batters to pound
the ball into the ground. Kison's
three-quarter sidearm delivery
had much the same effect. Kison
held the third through sixth hit
ters in the Brewer lineup Cecil
Cooper, led Simmons, Ben
Oglivie and Gorman Thomas
hitless in 15 at bats.
"Whenever you start the
playoffs in your home city it's im
portant to take the first two
games," Angels' catcher Bob
Boone said. "It doesn't surprise
me that we were able to do that.
