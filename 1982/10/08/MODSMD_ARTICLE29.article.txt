# More of the same in the NFL strike

### Associated Press 
Washington Efforts to end the National Football League players
strike continued yesterday with no signs of apparent progress.
For the second time in as many days, the NFL Management Coun
cil rejected a proposal from the union for a private mediator to end the
17-dav players' strike. It also said it saw no point to even resuming
negotiations.
Late yesterday morning, Ed Garvey, executive director of the Na
tional Football League Players union, released a list of nine private
citizens the union would accept as mediators. It included former Su
preme Court Justice Arthur Goldberg; the Rev. Theodore Hesburgh,
president of Notre Dame University; Archibald Cox, the former Wa
tergate special prosecutor, and three former secretaries of labor.
But Jack Donlan, Garvey's counterpart with the Management
Council, rejected the proposal two hours later, saying the owners
would only accept federal mediation. Jim Miller, the council's spokes
man, said Garvey's call for private mediating was "injecting another
issue into the dispute. Who should mediate becomes an issue."
The management council also stuck to the position it enunciated
Wednesday that no further talks would be held until the unioâ„¢
dropped its demand for a minimum wage scale. Miller said the council
saw no point to meeting even to discuss non-economic issues, as Gar
vey had proposed.
