Research on the last phase of the Stanford Shopping Cen
ter renovation project will continue as a decision on the
plans' approval was postponed by the Palo Alto Architec
tural Review Board yesterday. Plans for this last phase of the
renovation project include the construction of a Neiman-
Marcus store and a car parking deck.
In two weeks, the plans will again come before the board
for review. The plans are the last of a four-phase renovation
project begun by the City of Palo Alto in 1976.
If negotiations with Neiman-Marcus proceed favorably,
the store will be added to the west end of the main shopping
center mall. With all plans approved, construction could be
gin next summer, with the store opening in the fall of 1984,
said Frank Morrow, director of real estate at Stanford.
The parking deck, able to hold a maximum of 423 cars,
has been approved by Stanford and is presently under review
by the board. The deck will both maintain floor-space-to
parking ratios stipulated in contracts with major tenants and
replace parking that will be lost with the expected addition of
Neiman-Marcus.

This one-level structure will be built in the existing shop
ping center parking lot at the corner of Quarry and
Arboretum Roads. In addition, the construction plans in
clude building the car deck around a 29,000 square-foot
atrium that will preserve three large oak trees. Construction
of the deck could begin in January and be completed by July,
1983.
We have estimated that we need an additional 780
spaces," Morrow said. "Construction of a 400-car deck and
restriping the existing lots will go far toward closing the
gap."
Questions about the structure's design were broached by
the group of architects. Allowing more natural light into the
structure, adding more landscaping and disposing of a
porthole-archway type entrance to the parking area were
some of the suggestions raised. Some members of the board
discussed whether the night lighting systems were too bright
for the outlying areas, and whether a decrease of lighting
would create unsafe conditions.
Work for this project will be funded by revenues from the
shopping center. Drawn from a com
bination of land leases, shopping center
sales and rental of University-owned
buildings in the center, the revenues are
an estimated $3.6 million a year.
Since the renovation project was pro
posed in 1976, planners have sought to
invest the dollars in those renovations
that promise the best return, said Andy
Doty, director of community relations.
In 1976 it was estimated that retail sales
at the shopping center would
by $l9 to $23 million as a result of the
proposed development, according to
Palo Alto's Environmental Impact Re
port on the Stanford Shopping Center.
