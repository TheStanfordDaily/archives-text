# Drug arrest report to go to DA
## 
### KRISTEN CHRISTOPHER Senior staff writer 
The police report concerning
Wednesday's drug-related arrest of
Stanford junior Neil MacAvoy will
probably be sent to the Santa Clara
County district attorney's office today
so that charges can be finalized, accord
ing to Stanford Police.
Illegal importation and possession of
hashish for sale, possession of mari
juana and cocaine for sale and
possession of marijuana comprise five
possible charges against MacAvoy, said
Police Capt. Raoul Niemeyer.
However, Niemeyer said that the
final charges will be determined
through the district attorney's office.
"What's really important now is what
charges the DA decides on."

The value of the marijuana found in
MacAvoy's room was small in com
parison with the value of the cocaine
and hashish. Though the drugs found in
MacAvoy's room were "being officially
weighed" yesterday, Niemeyer esti
mated the amount of cocaine is "some
where around an ounce," with a street
value of between $2OOO and $2400. The
40 to 45 grams of hashish, which had
been sent to MacAvoy from China, are
worth $4OO or $5OO, Niemeyer said. The
marijuana found is worth "a few hun
dred dollars," he said.
David Chenevert, president of
MacAvoy's fraternity, Alpha Delta
Phi, said police visiting the fraternity in
dicated he may be subpoenaed when
court proceedings in the case begin.
The return of police to the Alpha
Delts yesterday did not worry residents

of the house, according to Chenevert.
He said he views it as part of the foilow
up to the arrest, which has involved
phone calls and visits from newspaper
and television reporters.
"After the third or fourth follow-up
person comes through, it gets a little
blase," Chenevert said. "The situation
is not changing it changed when Neil
was arrested.
"There was a very large disturbance
and it has been very slowly settling . . .
emotionally, the house is getting over
the shock," he added.
MacAvoy returned to the Alpha
Delts late Wednesday after bail was
posted and was "around the house"
yesterday, according to Chenevert.
MacAvoy, 20, is from Corning, New-
York.
