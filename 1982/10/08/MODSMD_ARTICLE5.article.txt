# Stanford Stables restorations considered

### BOB COHN 
Plans for the restoration of the once-illustrious
Stanford Stables are slated for discussion today in a
meeting of University officials. Complaints con
cerning the stables' poor condition have multiplied
in the past year and have brought the problem to the
attention of Stanford residents and University of
ficials.

Raymond Bacchetti, vice-provost of the Office of
Management and Budget, said the meeting would
focus on taking "stock of the questions that need to
be answered," especially those concerning the physi
cal restoration and new management of the stables.

The University has already committed itself to re
pairing the Stanford Barn, a registered national
landmark, and has also promised to preserve the
stables as an educational and recreational facility.
He estimates that the restoration of the main barn
plagued with a dangerously sagging and leaking
roof, unstable walls and external decay will cost
between $500,000 and $750,000.
The cost of completely restoring the 52-acre stable
grounds would exceed $1 million, according to
Richard Cassin, a graduate student in biology and
chairman of the Stanford Equestrians, a newly
formed organization.

Bacchetti said, "we don't know where the money
will come from," making the extent of the stables'
restoration currently undetermined.
"We want to keep that area (the stables) for
horses and the kinds of activities that Senator
(Leland) Stanford used it for back when he ran the
place," Bacchetti said.

The issue of the stables' restoration was first pub
licized last year by a group of stable users who later
called themselves the Stanford Equestrians. Cassin
said, "Our principal goal was to do what we could to
see that the barn was restored as a building and to
improve horse care and facilities for students."
In a year, the group has grown to include 126 fac
ulty, staff, students and alumni, with an 11-member
board.

The first official University act concerning the
stables was the release of Lois Melville as director of

the Stanford riding school and overseer of the
stables. After Melville found her lease terminated
(by the Stanford Real Estate Office) following more
than 16 years of service, she began to seek some an
swers.

"I'd like an explanation," she said. "I've called,
I've gone over there (to the Real Estate Office). No
body will give you a straight answer." Frank Mor
row, director of real estate, declined to speak to the
Daily.

Cassin maintains that the termination of the
Melville lease is a sensible move that will expedite
the restoration sought by the Stanford Equestrians.

"We felt the interests of the students were not
even being reasonably served by Mrs. Melville's
presence," he said. "She had not held up her end of
the deal in regard to maintenance of the facility." He
added that "the quality of horse care is really poor
the feed is lousy, the stalls don't get cleaned prop
erlv ..."

Janet Lynch, a sophomore board member of the
Stanford Equestrians and afrequent stable-user,
agrees with Cassin. The condition of the stables last
year "was pretty shoddy," especially during the win
ter, she said. Lynch noted that "everyone recognized
that something had to be done, and that's when the
Stanford Equestrians became a serious group."
Cassin said if the Stanford Equestrians could ac
quire the responsibility for management of the
stables, the top priority (besides the already prom
ised barn restoration) would be to build a strong
educational and competitive program. "The idea
was to develop a full-blown Stanford equestrian
team," he said.

Under the leadership of Cassin and three other of
ficers, the organization submitted a detailed pro
posal to the University last spring which included
plans for turning over the lease of the stables to the
Stanford Equestrians who would manage them on a
non-profit basis. The proposal.also outlined plans
for the expansion and improvement of equestrian
classes through the Department of Athletics.
The delay between last spring's proposal and the
action taken last month reflects the complexity of
the issue. Because of the numerous factors relevant

to the decision, members of the Offices of the Prov
ost, Planning, Real Estate and Business, the Depart
ment of Athletics and the board of trustees, as well
as University President Donald Kennedy must be
consulted, Cassin s^id.

On Oct. 31, Melville's lease will expire officially;
the University must soon decide whether or not to
operate the stables during the restoration construc
tion. Members of the Stanford Equestrians, Univer
sity officials and boarders agree that the most de
sirable choice is to keep the stables Open, even if the
facilities are partially out of use. This option, how
ever, requires appointing an interim or permanent
manager before the end of this month.

Cassin stressed the importance of keeping the
stables open, even for a short interim period. In the
event of a closure, boarders would have to find an
other facility in which to keep their horses and
equipment. Some boarders have been using the
stables for more than 20 years, and Cassin said he
fears that "the reputation of the place is already de
teriorating, and once we lose the boarders it will be
difficult to get them back."

The stables, once the Palo Alto Stock Farm, "was
one of the largest and most sophisticated horse
breeding and training facilities in history," Cassin
said.

Furthermore, a closure would force Melville to
sell her 17 school horses and stable equipment to an
outside agency, instead of to the University. The dif
ficult task of locating new animals and equipment at
the stables reopening could be avoided if the stables
are kept open and management is appointed soon to
negotiate for the possible purchase of the team, he
said.

Cassin maintains that there is enough room in the
outside stalls to board horses and restore the barn at
the same time. "The place can operate while the
barn is being rebuilt," he said.

Bachetti said he, too, hopes the stables can remain
open. "We'd like to have some kind of continuity,
but we do have construction and planning to do,"
Bacchetti said. "My judgment is that not closing is
the more desirable way to go."
