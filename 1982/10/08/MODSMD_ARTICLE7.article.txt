## Ring bell for service? Hoover Tower carillonneur does for a hobby 
### CHRISTIE WOOD 
It is 5 p.m. and the afternoon
sun has settled into its soft eve
ning dusk; from 280 feet in the
sky, the chimes of Hoover Tower
float down across the University
campus. The music is almost
wistful, perhaps conjuring up im
ages of excited schoolboys, sw
inging from tower ropes to ring
out the hour.

Of course there aren't any sw
inging ropes or excited
schoolboys. Instead, a larger
than-life conglomeration of
wooden knobs, levers and foot
pedals are used to manipulate the
35-bell carillon on the 14th level
of Hoover Tower.
But when the tall, graying, 57-

vear-old carillonneur pauses to
look out from behind his "key
board," there is something of the
schoolboy in his grin. "Isn't that
a neat sound?" he says, "I love to
ham it up with those trills."

James Angell is the assistant
chairman of the Electrical Engi
neering Department, in charge of
graduate admissions for that de
partment and an expert in solid
state electronic circuitry. He

teaches both lecture and lab
classes and supervises graduate
research. And when he escapes
from the maze of electronic
gadgets in his laboratories, he
displays his skill and sense of mu
sic appreciation as the Univer
sity's only carillonneur.
It appears that, for Angell,
pounding a wooden board and
pumping pedals in a dingy, fairly
cramped room is pure exhilara
tion.
"Music is very, very much a
part of my life," he said, "I would
not have come to Stanford if they
didn't have a carillon."
Angell first came to the Uni
versity in September of 1960, a
time when Hoover Tower's
carillon was the only one of its
kind in California. It was
donated to the University in 1941
by Belgium in honor of President
Herbert Hoover's war relief
work. There are now approx
imately 150 in North America,
about half of which are situated
in university bell towers.
Each lever or foot connects to
a mechanism which rings the cor
responding bell. Rather than
playing a single tone, however,
each bell is tuned so that it plays
an entire chord, thus creating a
full and harmonious sound.

" You have to be a little careful
about the way you choose to play
bells together," Angell ex
plained. "If you're not careful,
you'll have quite a clash of the
tones of one bell and those of an

other."
Angell holds bachelor, masters
and doctorate degrees from the
Massachusetts Institute of Tech
nology. After leaving MIT in

1952, he worked with the re
search division of the Philco Cor
poration in Philadelphia, where
he was manager of Solid-State

Circuit Research and led a group
studying the basic circuit applica
tion and evaluation of transistors
and other solid-state devices,
particularly for computers and
high-frequency functions.
Appointed in 1960 by Univer
sity President Wallace Sterling,
Angell has remained an active
faculty member for 22 years. In
1969, he was named associate
chairman of the Department ot
Electrical Engineering. His re
search recently has been con
cerned with the application of in
tegrated circuits technology to
the fabrication of sensors for
biomedical instrumentation.

Angell began music lessons on
the piano at the age of four; later
he studied on the organ, which is
his "true love," and supported
himself during graduate school
as a church accompanist. By the
time Angell learned to play the
carillon, he was considering a ca
reer in music.
Angell's extensive musical
background allows him to trans

pose much of his own music
since popular arrangements for
the carillon might be somewhat
hard to come by. He has quite a
large repetoire, consisting of ev
erything from traditional carillon
arrangements to the music of the
classical composers and from
popular modern musicals such as
"Fiddler on the RooF' and "The
Sound of Music" to the Beatles'
"Yesterday."
Angell gets plenty of op
portunities to display this re
petoire of tunes, too. He often
travels as a guest performer as
well as attending the annual
meeting of the North American
branch of the Guild of Carillon
neurs. In fact, the engineer has
enough bell-ringing associates in
the United States and Europe
that he has a carillon to play vir
tually anywhere he goes.
Over the years Angell has
taught numerous students on the
carillon three of his students
are now playing on other college

campuses in California, includ
ing UC-Berkeley.
According to Angell, Stan
ford's carillon is not the first-rate
set that it could be, and he is cur
rently involved in a fund raising
project to renovate and augment
the existing bells now in Hoover
Tower.
"This is acoustically an ideal
location," Angell said, "I would
like to see the set increased to 50
bells, and a full four octaves."
In support of this project,
Angell is presently in Washing
ton, D.C., to attending a recep
tion held by the Stanford Alumni
Club of Washington at the
Belgian Embassy. He sees this as
a preliminary effort which he
hopes will culminate in enough
money to endow the Stanford
carillon and perhaps establish
a fund to pay for a carilloneur, a
position currently without com
pensation.
Said Angell, "I want to make
darn sure that it's played after I
retire."

ham it up with those trills."

James Angell is the assistant
chairman of the Electrical Engi
neering Department, in charge of
graduate admissions for that de
partment and an expert in solid
state electronic circuitry. He

teaches both lecture and lab
classes and supervises graduate
research. And when he escapes
from the maze of electronic
gadgets in his laboratories, he
displays his skill and sense of mu
sic appreciation as the Univer
sity's only carillonneur.
It appears that, for Angell,
pounding a wooden board and
pumping pedals in a dingy, fairly
cramped room is pure exhilara
tion.
"Music is very, very much a
part of my life," he said, "I would
not have come to Stanford if they
didn't have a carillon."
Angell first came to the Uni
versity in September of 1960, a
time when Hoover Tower's
carillon was the only one of its
kind in California. It was
donated to the University in 1941
by Belgium in honor of President
Herbert Hoover's war relief
work. There are now approx
imately 150 in North America,
about half of which are situated
in university bell towers.
Each lever or foot connects to
a mechanism which rings the cor
responding bell. Rather than
playing a single tone, however,
each bell is tuned so that it plays
an entire chord, thus creating a
full and harmonious sound.

" You have to be a little careful
about the way you choose to play
bells together," Angell ex
plained. "If you're not careful,
you'll have quite a clash of the
tones of one bell and those of an

other."
Angell holds bachelor, masters
and doctorate degrees from the
Massachusetts Institute of Tech
nology. After leaving MIT in

1952, he worked with the re
search division of the Philco Cor
poration in Philadelphia, where
he was manager of Solid-State

Circuit Research and led a group
studying the basic circuit applica
tion and evaluation of transistors
and other solid-state devices,
particularly for computers and
high-frequency functions.
Appointed in 1960 by Univer
sity President Wallace Sterling,
Angell has remained an active
faculty member for 22 years. In
1969, he was named associate
chairman of the Department ot
Electrical Engineering. His re
search recently has been con
cerned with the application of in
tegrated circuits technology to
the fabrication of sensors for
biomedical instrumentation.

Angell began music lessons on
the piano at the age of four; later
he studied on the organ, which is
his "true love," and supported
himself during graduate school
as a church accompanist. By the
time Angell learned to play the
carillon, he was considering a ca
reer in music.
Angell's extensive musical
background allows him to trans

pose much of his own music
since popular arrangements for
the carillon might be somewhat
hard to come by. He has quite a
large repetoire, consisting of ev
erything from traditional carillon
arrangements to the music of the
classical composers and from
popular modern musicals such as
"Fiddler on the RooF' and "The
Sound of Music" to the Beatles'
"Yesterday."
Angell gets plenty of op
portunities to display this re
petoire of tunes, too. He often
travels as a guest performer as
well as attending the annual
meeting of the North American
branch of the Guild of Carillon
neurs. In fact, the engineer has
enough bell-ringing associates in
the United States and Europe
that he has a carillon to play vir
tually anywhere he goes.
Over the years Angell has
taught numerous students on the
carillon three of his students
are now playing on other college

campuses in California, includ
ing UC-Berkeley.
According to Angell, Stan
ford's carillon is not the first-rate
set that it could be, and he is cur
rently involved in a fund raising
project to renovate and augment
the existing bells now in Hoover
Tower.
"This is acoustically an ideal
location," Angell said, "I would
like to see the set increased to 50
bells, and a full four octaves."
In support of this project,
Angell is presently in Washing
ton, D.C., to attending a recep
tion held by the Stanford Alumni
Club of Washington at the
Belgian Embassy. He sees this as
a preliminary effort which he
hopes will culminate in enough
money to endow the Stanford
carillon and perhaps establish
a fund to pay for a carilloneur, a
position currently without com
pensation.
Said Angell, "I want to make
darn sure that it's played after I
retire."

A larger-than-life conglomeration of
wooden knobs, levers and foot pedals are
used to manipulate the 35-bell carillon on
the 14th level of Hoover Tower.

Each lever or foot
connects to a
mechanism which
rings the
corresponding bell.
Rather than playing a
single tone, however,
each bell is tuned so
that it plays an entire
chord, thus creating a
full and harmonious
sound.

It is 5 p.m. and the afternoon
