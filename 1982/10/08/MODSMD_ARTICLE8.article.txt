## THE 						STANFORD DAILY Refusal requires explanation 
### 
It's the end of another week, and the United Stan
ford Workers strike against the University is still at
a stalemate. Sure, while it seems that some move
ment is now being made, it's hard to say whether
that shift signifies real progress or simple fatigue on
the part of the bargaining teams. The last real at
tempt at a settlement appears to have occurred last
Thursday, when the union proposed a return to
work while an advisory arbitration team con
sidered the issues involved in the dispute. Not that
the arbitration would necessarily bring a settle
ment; both teams, along with the USW member
ship, would have to approve any proposal offered
bv the advisers.
If anything, the proposal seems a little tame.
With non-binding arbitration, the chance of a tem
porary peace exists, with employees returning to
work only to march out again in a couple of weeks,
leading to more disruption and more frustration all
around the University community.
But we won't have a chance to find out. The Uni
versity turned the arbitration proposal down.
Moreover, the negotiators for the University aren't
willing to defend their reasoning adequately.
It's fairly easy to understand the union's motives
for offering the possibility of arbitration, and also
to interpret those motives as not entirely generous.
Currently, 36 percent of USW bargaining unit
members have returned to work despite the strike,
steadily climbing from 27 percent at the strike's
outset. As the walkout continues, pressure grows
on the union to settle; strike funds begin to dwindle,
workers become disenchanted at the prospect of
prolonged unemployment and the act of making
one's presence (or lack of a presence) known leads
to more hostility from students and others recently

returned to the campus. At this point, the union
members' interests coincide with the community's:
they want to go back to work, and we want a return
to normal University operation.
The University doesn't see things that way.
Priscilla Wheeler, chief negotiator for the Univer
sity, has said the University doesn't want to use the
services of a third party in solving the dispute. That
would be acceptable, if there were a chance of a
solution through conventional collective bargain
ing. But the most significant aspect of the strike cur
rently is the intransigence of both the union and the
University. If the two sides involved in negotiations
cannot reach an agreement, it stands to reason that
a third party of advisers is not only desirable, but
necessary.
The University, then, must give a fuller defense of
its motives in its refusal to submit to arbitration.
Otherwise, one has no choice but to ask what bene
fit the University seeks to gain through a prolonged
disruption of operations. Can it get a better deal
through bargaining on its own? If so, why hasn't
that happened yet? Does the University have other
motives in its plans than simply settling the strike?
Is there a desire to weaken or bust the union?
These are uncomfortable questions to ask. But
the reason they exist is because of the University's
apparent tunnel vision on the matter of arbitration.
It's not that the University negotiators are silent,
but that what they are saying is unsatisfactory at
this stage of the strike. If the University is not will
ing to reconsider its view on advisory arbitration,
then it should explain more fully its reluctance
toward the procedure. Maybe then we'll be able to
see some real progress in the dispute, rather than
the endless circling of the picket lines.
