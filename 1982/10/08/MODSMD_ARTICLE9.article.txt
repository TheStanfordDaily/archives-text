# Bill G. Presents: Monopoly?
## 
### 
Tomorrow, for the first time in two years, stu
dents will be able to see and listen to a big-name
rock group on the Stanford campus when The
Grateful Dead performs the first of two weekend
concerts. Instead of having to drive to San Francis
co or Oakland or Berkeley, students will merely
have to walk over to the Frost Amphitheatre to see
this Bay Area favorite. That's right, our very own
concert here.
But is it our own concert? Well, some students are
working during the two concert dates and others la
bored for many hours in doing the advance work
required of bringing a major event here. These ef
forts should be appreciated by concert-goers when
they bask in the predicted sun and absiorb the'sub
dued rock music of the Dead.
XBut, even though much student effort was neces
sary to arrange and stage the two concerts, a large
amount of control was retained by co-promoter Bill
Graham Presents (BGP). By putting up the money
for the two concerts BGP is insuring the Chaparral,
, the campus humor magazine co-promoting the
event, against losses. With this arrangement BGP
holds the responsibility for promotion and man
agement of the concerts and has an opportunity to
make a substantial profit while it also takes the
risk of losses. The Chaparral, on the other hand, has
no risk of losses and is expected to turn a healthy
profit.

We recognize the need for campus organizations
to be insulated from risks to avoid the plight of the
ill-fated ASSU Special Events, a concert organiza
tion which folded two years ago after losing

$125,000. Still, the memory of that loss should not
leave campus groups entirely dependent on BGP,
which holds a virtual monopoly over Bay Area con
cert promoting.
The new Concert Network, composed of the
ASSU, the Chaparral, the Leland Stanford Junior
University Marching Band and the Student Alumni
Network may eventually eliminate the need for co
promotion by building up a reserve fund large
enough to cover promotion risks.
To groups interested in bringing concerts to cam
pus the network offers a number of advantages in
cluding continuity and experience in arranging con
certs, which should make it easier for more concerts
to be scheduled here. But in order to obtain that ex
perience the organizations in the network need to
take greater responsibility in managing the con
certs.
Another possible problem with the network is its
limited membership. While we understand the need
for the groups involved to meet certain criteria
before joining the network, this exclusiveness could
lead to the network's becoming another concert
promoter's monopoly. Chaparral Business Man
ager Vinnie Freda, one of the organizers of the con
cert network, said, "It's one thing if (a group such
as) SPA wants to co-promote with us, it's another
thing if they want to join us."
It would be a shame if the network, conceived for
the purpose of loosening the grip of outsider con
cert promoter BGP, ended up supplanting that or
ganization's monopoly on concert promotion at
Stanford.
