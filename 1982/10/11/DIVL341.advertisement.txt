For twenty years now Tresidder Union has been serving the Stanford
community. Many improvements have taken place over this time as
we have attempted to respond to the changing needs of the campus.
Some of the improvements of the last few years include:
• Reinstitution of the Union Board
• Expansion of STARTS (Student Arts at Stanford) through active
student volunteer participation
• Creation of student entrepreneurial opportunities
• Remodeling of the Transition to Union Crossroads
• Addition of the Corner Pocket with frozen yogurt and pizza
• Creation of STOPS (Stanford-Tresidder Outdoor Programs)
• Addition of the Coffee House Patio with outdoor beer & wine
service
• Increased student employment opportunities
• Addition of the Pub at Encina Station, open 6 nights a week
• Publishing of "Run the Foothills to the Bay," a Stanford Runner's
Guide
• Development of a long-term space use plan.
Watch for announcements of new improvements and special
anniversary programs, especially during Winter Quarter.
WE'RE NOT JUST GETTING OLDER, WE'RE GETTING BETTER!
