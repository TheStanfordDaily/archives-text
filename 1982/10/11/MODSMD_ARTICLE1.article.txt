At the end of their 30-day strike
against the University, the United Stan
ford Workers gained no overall in
creases in wages above the University's
original proposal, and may have saved
the University at least $1.23 million in
unpaid wages.
The final settlement, approved
420-100 by union members Saturday,
differs little from the University's pro
posal offered Sept. 7. The new contract
provides workers with a 7 percent wage
and a 3 percent additional step increase
as well as an additional $5 a month
towards medical coverage in the first
year.
The University's Sept. 7 proposal of
fered a 9.5 percent across-the-board
wage increase and no additional medi
cal benefits in the first year.

News analysis

The additional $5 a month in medical
benefits will cost the University an esti
mated $250,000 during the next three
years.
Although the University saved an es
timated $1.23 million in unpaid wages
because of the strike, the University in
curred other additional costs, accord
ing to University spokesman Robert
Beyers. These included overtime paid
for policeman and other workers, van
dalism repairs, delays in construction,
legal costs and other "hidden costs"
such as the inconveniences suffered.
The 30-day-long strike, the longest in
University history, has created deep
divisions between labor and man
agement here. Throughout the strike,
both sides exchanged personal accusa
tions and charges of misconduct.
"The University continued to
bargain in bad faith, they continued to
lie all the way through the process,"
USW Executive Secretary Michael
Baratz told union members at the
closed-door meeting Saturday.
The University has also made per
sonal charges against union members.
In a Sept. 17 letter to Stanford facul
ty, University President Donald Ken

nedy forewarned of violent union work
ers at the pre-game festivities of the
Stanford-San Jose State football game.
"This strike continues to be marred
by personal threats to non-striking em
ployees, by vandalism of personal and
University property, and by a number
of incidents of physical violence. I can
not in good conscience encourage em
ployees and their families to come to an
event at which they may be subjected to
harassment, intimidation or unsafe
conditions," the letter stated.
Felix Barthelemy, manager of em
ployee relations, denied that the Uni
versity's hard-line bargaining stance
had enabled the University to prevail
over the union.
"The proposals reflect some com
promises by both sides," he said. "The
University didn't gain anything from
the strike. We weren't looking to win
anything. It really didn't do us any
good. It had a serious impact on
eveyone, students, workers, their fami
lies, and the institution."
Kennedy said that the University's
bargaining strategy was not effective
"in the sense that we failed to com
municate the level of our final settle
ment in a way that the union leadership
could understand it."
"You can't call a bargaining process
a complete success when it results in a
strike," Kennedy added.
Both University and union officials
have said publicly that they hope work
ers and management can now establish
better relations.
"We're just thinking of what we can
dc tomorrow to try to minimize and
diminish any bad feelings and that's
going to take time and effort on the part
of both sides," Barthelemy said yester
day.
"We are on the brink of starting a
new working relationship with the Uni
versity and the strike has provided the
foundation for that. The University and
the union have always been adversaries
and there is no reason we can't be
friends," said Patrick Smith, union ne
gotiating team member.
