At the end of their 30-day strike
against the University, the United Stan
ford Workers gained no overall in
creases in wages above the University's
original proposal, and may have saved
the University at least $1.23 million in
unpaid wages.
The final settlement, approved
420-100 by union members Saturday,
differs little from the University's pro
posal offered Sept. 7. The new contract
provides workers with a 7 percent wage
and a 3 percent additional step increase
as well as an additional $5 a month
towards medical coverage in the first
year.
The University's Sept. 7 proposal of
fered a 9.5 percent across-the-board
wage increase and no additional medi
cal benefits in the first year.

The additional $5 a month in medical
benefits will cost the University an esti
mated $250,000 during the next three
years.
Although the University saved an es
timated $1.23 million in unpaid wages
because of the strike, the University in
curred other additional costs, accord
ing to University spokesman Robert
Beyers. These included overtime paid
for policeman and other workers, van
dalism repairs, delays in construction,
legal costs and other "hidden costs"
such as the inconveniences suffered.
The 30-day-long strike, the longest in
University history, has created deep
divisions between labor and man
agement here. Throughout the strike,
both sides exchanged personal accusa
tions and charges of misconduct.
"The University continued to
bargain in bad faith, they continued to
lie all the way through the process,"
USW Executive Secretary Michael
Baratz told union members at the
closed-door meeting Saturday.
The University has also made per
sonal charges against union members.
In a Sept. 17 letter to Stanford facul
ty, University President Donald Ken

nedy forewarned of violent union work
ers at the pre-game festivities of the
Stanford-San Jose State football game.
"This strike continues to be marred
by personal threats to non-striking em
ployees, by vandalism of personal and
University property, and by a number
of incidents of physical violence. I can
not in good conscience encourage em
ployees and their families to come to an
event at which they may be subjected to
harassment, intimidation or unsafe
conditions," the letter stated.
Felix Barthelemy, manager of em
ployee relations, denied that the Uni
versity's hard-line bargaining stance
had enabled the University to prevail
over the union.
"The proposals reflect some com
promises by both sides," he said. "The
University didn't gain anything from
the strike. We weren't looking to win
anything. It really didn't do us any
good. It had a serious impact on
eveyone, students, workers, their fami
lies, and the institution."
Kennedy said that the University's
bargaining strategy was not effective
"in the sense that we failed to com
municate the level of our final settle
ment in a way that the union leadership
could understand it."
"You can't call a bargaining process
a complete success when it results in a
strike," Kennedy added.
Both University and union officials
have said publicly that they hope work
ers and management can now establish
better relations.
"We're just thinking of what we can
dc tomorrow to try to minimize and
diminish any bad feelings and that's
going to take time and effort on the part
of both sides," Barthelemy said yester
day.
"We are on the brink of starting a
new working relationship with the Uni
versity and the strike has provided the
foundation for that. The University and
the union have always been adversaries
and there is no reason we can't be
friends," said Patrick Smith, union ne
gotiating team member.

WAITING TO VOTE: Members of the United Stanford Workers union
studv new contract proposals before casting their votes at Dinkelspiel
Auditorium Saturday afternoon. The terms of the contract they approved
were reached early Friday following an all-night bargaining session.
Inside the closed-door meeting Sat
urday, union leaders were lees cordial.
"Priscilla Wheeler is a very difficult
person to work with and in the course of
the next three years we can drive her out
of her mind," said Smith.
Union leaders claimed the strike has
served as a show of the union's strength.
"They have clearly gotten the signal
that we exist and that we are a force and
that we have to be dealt with. And come
the next contract period, they will take
us more seriously," Smith said.
Kennedy admitted that he was some
what surprised by the strength of the
strike. "I was a little surprised at its
duration."
Barthelemv denied that the strike has
affected labor-management relations in
any way. "I don't think that the Univer
sity does not take the union seriously or
did not take them seriously during the
negotiations or over the contract peri
od," he said.
"Their decision to strike does not
change our decision to work coopera
tively with them," he added.
Union leaders hope their display of
strength will draw other non-union
workers into the union, particularly
hospital workers who are scheduled to
vote whether to join the union very
soon.
"If the hospital workers really want a
union, what they'll see now is that this is
a good, responsible, militant union and
we'll promise we'll fight with them,"
Baratz said.
"I really think that the effectiveness
of this strike will show more when the
hospital workers vote," said Stanford
Linear Accelerator Center worker Joe
Humphries after Saturday's meeting.
The strike also created deep divisions
between workers within in the union.
Many strikers were angered by the fact
that more than one-third of the union
members returned to their jobs during
the strike. Many blamed these workers
for the lack of a more favorable settle
ment.
"It's shit," said Faye Williams, a
worker at SLAC, of the final contract.
"The majority of the people did not go
out on strike. It was nobody's fault but
the workers. If everybody had been out
there on the lines, we probably could
have gotten more."
One scab worker said he voted to ac
cept the new contract because he
thought his wages were fair.
"I'm very happy with the money I
make," the gardener said. He asked not
to be identified.
Union officials agreed that a more fa
vorable settlement was not reached be
cause of the lack of support by union
members.
"If you want more, you have to have
eight or nine hundred people willing to
stay out for an indefinite period," said
union lawyer Paul Supton.
According to Baratz, the union nego

tiating team acccpted the final proposal
largely because many workers were
planning to return to work today
anyway.
"There isn't anybody on the nego
tiating committee who is happy with the
specifics. The team negotiated with the
sense we had gotten from the pickets,"
said Baratz. "We had to do it on the
basis of the ability we had, the number
of people we had out on strike, and how
many people said 'we're going back to
work no matter what.' The overriding
feeling was that it was more important
to have a union than not to have a
union," he added.
Most workers after the meeting said
they voted to accept the proposal be
cause they could not afford to miss an
other paycheck.
"It's purely a lack of money," said
Williams of SLAC.
According to Plant Services worker,
John Brown, Baratz assured union
members who attended a Thursday
meeting that he would "go in there (to
negotiations) and try to come out with
something."
The strike began after weeks of nego
tiating this summer. The University
presented its final proposal Sept. 7
which they characterized as "fair and
reasonable." The union voted 465 to
172 to reject the proposal the next day.
The union made one counter pro
posal and two important moves toward
a settlement during the strike. These in
cluded an offer to submit the outstand
ing issues to a third-party arbitration
team and the acceptance of the Univer
sity's proposal concerning information
on temporary workers
Throughout the duration of the
strike, the University took a hard-line
bargaining stance, refusing to make any
counter proposals or to accept advisory
arbitration.
A damaging confidential report re
leased by the union revealed that the
University's first-year proposal was at
least 3 percent lower than the increase
recommended by the University's com
pensation department in order to make
union wages competitive with area em
ployers.
The two sides settled their dispute
concerning the hiring of temporary
workers in the University's original
side-letter proposal.
According to University Counsel
Priscilla Wheeler, neither side has yet
withdrawn its unfair labor practice
charges with the National Labor Rela
tions Board (NLRB). Wheeler said
both sides discussed disposing of the
charges in the negotiations and that
both sides will soon meet to discuss the
issue.
The union had claimed that the Uni
versity's refusal to supply information
on temporary workers was an unfair la
bor practice. The University claimed
the strike was not based on the unfair
practice charge and was, therefore, il
legal.
