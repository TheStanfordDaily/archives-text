Outdoor sculpture is a part of daily life at
Stanford; students walk to classes among the
works of internationally-known artists. There
are 18 outdoor sculptures on campus: some are
hidden in groves of trees, and others are very
visible.
Artists who create sculptures to be exhibited
outdoors face a unique challenge. They must
express themselves to a large audience who will
live among the works, not just encounter them
in a museum.
Much of the sculpture here is contemporary:
it deals with the present, and with the artist's
feelings. Sculptors today are more "bound up"
with their works, and their messages are more
subjective than those of classical sculptors.
In the past year, three new sculptures have
been added to the Stanford collection: Bruce
Beasley's Vanguard near Kresge Auditorium,
Kenneth Snelson's Mozart I near Meyer library
and Dimitri Hadzi's Pillars of Hercules 111 in
front of the Business School. All three artists

are well-known and their work is shown in gal
leries and museums across both Europe and the
United States.
Beasley wants the viewer to feel his Vanguard
directly, as an emotion, and not to put it into
words. The sculpture is based on crystal shapes
in nature with triangular spaces inside it. Van
guard's "fishscale pattern" catches and reflects
light day and night, and these reflections change
as the viewer moves around it. The sculpture
weighs 4000 pounds, but appears weightless
and "poised" on the grass. Beasley wants it to
seem dynamic and "creature-like" even at
night, when the moon plays on its burnished
pattern.
Snelson's Mozart /, like Beasley's Vanguard
has a light, transparent quality. Snelson's goal
is to "relate to all aspects of sculpture at once"
by seeing through it. Mozart I sits between the
Bookstore and Meyer Library; it is a giant
network of threads and cables which both bal
ance each other and create tension. These me
chanical forces are "frozen events" taken
directly from the motions of the universe, and
made visible to the public. Snelson sees his work
as "imagining and building sculptures from
physical forces"; he is a "visionary artist"
which, he feels, is a kind of "speculative scien
tist." Mozart / is interesting because of this
blend of engineering and imagination.
Dimitri Hadzi's Pillars of Hercules 111 is
heavier and more rugged-looking than the oth

er two new sculptures. Hazi, of Greek parent
age, lived and worked in Rome for 25 years; he
assimilates the architecture of Greece and
Rome in his sculpture. The austere, basic, arch
like qualities of Pillars remind us of ancient art.
The spaces between the bronze pillars form dra
matic shapes. The silhouettes of the pillars are
also dramatic; strong, solid blocks with tex
tured edges. Hadzi describes Pillars-. "The work
demonstrates one of the problems I like to set
up for myself: massive forms which are still
both light and penetrable; offering a sense of
strength and authority, yet inviting and inspir
ing."
The White Memorial Fountain by Aristides
Demetrios in White Plaza (the Claw) was the
winning entry of a competition in 1964. De
metrios, a San Franciscan, submitted three
pieces to the 1963 competition for the fountain.
He built the sculptures in a stage-set of White
Plaza so they would complement the landscape,
architecture and ethos of Stanford.
The Claw is placed exactly at the junction of
the two main axes of campus, one from the Old
Union to the Bookstore and the other from
Hoover Tower up to the Post Office. The Claw's
spiral, spherical shape contrasts with the ver
tical narrow trees around it. Demetrios had to
imagine these trees full-grown in order to vis
ualize the sculpture.
The Claw is dedicated to two brothers who
died at age 20 while undergraduates at Stan
ford. The sculpture's ever-completing helix
shape is a symbol of the men's tragically un
fulfilled lives, and the continual affirmation of
life at Stanford. The jets of water continue the
arcs of metal and lead the viewer through the

sculpture. The inner spaces also are important
to the curvilinear motion. The forms of the
Claw remind us of fire and water motions.
Like Vanguard, the Claw changes as we pass
it; its inner spaces and water spray take on dif
ferent shapes. Demetrios wants the viewer to in
teract with his sculpture; to touch and play in its
water.
Le Faucon (the Falcon) by Alexander Calder,
in the Law School patio, was donated in 1979 by
Mr. Richard Lang, who graduated from the
Law School in 1929. Calder is known for his
mobiles, and large steel sculptures that seem
mobile.
The Falcon is composed of clean, simple
shapes, partly because Calder cuts the metal
and pieces together the shapes separately. The
clean lines of the wings make the sculpture look
like it could take off at any time. The Falcon is
placed in the Law school because it "... is a
symbol of creativity in our society. The protec
tion of creativity is one of the great functions of
the law."
The Henry Moore Large Torso: Arch stands
outside the Cummings Art Building at the in
tersection of four paths, allowing it maximum
exposure to students. Moore himself chose the
site from plans and drawings of Stanford. The
sculpture recalls both an ancient gateway and a
pelvis bone.
Moore does not want to define his sculpture's
significance; he wants to move away from his
more traditional reclining and seated figures.
The sculptor likes bone and stone forms be
cause they are natural "metaphors" for the hu
man form. These primitive shapes are part of
Moore's interest in myth and ancient tradition,

man and nature.
The Cummings Art building also exhibits an
untitled bronze relief by Arnaldo Pomodoro.
Pomodoro was an artist-in-residence at Stan
ford in 1966-67. His studio was on campus, and
students could easily learn about his work. The
relief has an industrial feeling; grills and ma
chinery parts form the surface of the sculpture.
Pomodoro's Cube sits in front of the Stanford
museum, and it balances on one pointed corner.
The inner structure of the cube is revealed to the
viewer, showing grids and machine-type parts.
Francois Stahly's Les Oiseau Flammes in the
courtyard of the Business School is a melting
cluster of "flame-bird" shapes. Its organic, nat
ural form opposes the severe architecture and
atmosphere of the Business School. Stahly, like
Pomodoro, was also an artist-in-residence here
in 1964-65. His sculptures came to the campus
when he left. Stahly's La Licorrte, his second
sculpture on campus, is in front of the Faculty

Club.
Shadows of the Future by Benjamin Bufano
sits in the Tresidder Patio behind the Coffee
House, a gift to Stanford from the Bufanos. The
glossy black granite looks cool, and the simple
curves of the two figures give a calmness to the
sculpture.
The Albers Wall, in front of the Physics
Tank, was a cer-.ter of controversy among stu
dents. It was dedicated in August, 1980. Its un
usual shape and diagram-like designs
challenged the public. The horizontal lines re
mind us of coded language or computer sym
bols, and the unfolded boxes on the opposite
side look like revolving, compacting cubes.
Carla Lavatelli's One-and-a-half\ in the Law
School courtyard, is a giant industrial cog. One
circle is sliced in half, and the other has circular
spaces. The sculpture was given to Stanford by
her son, a student at the Business School. It
was placed there in 1975. Lavatelli is an Italian
sculptor who has U.S. citizenship. The edges
and interior space set the work in motion; the
viewer's perspective determines its appearance.
Antoin Poncet's Retrofutee is hidden in the
redwood grove next to the Art gallery. From
one side the white marble seems to rotate and
spiral, like a horizontal arrow. From the other
side, it looks like stacked discs, or softened ver
tebrae.
