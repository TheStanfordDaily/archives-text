## The 						Stanford Daily Strike settlement settles little 
### 
Only minutes after the final vote was cast and the
USW's approval of the University's offer made
known, the news flashed across campus: the strike's
over!
Everyone seems relieved. Students now eagerly
await the return of toilet paper to campus
restrooms and food service to residence dining
rooms. University President Donald Kennedy an
ticipates a quiet night at home sans the customary
front-yard candlelight vigil. USW members are
looking forward to paying off a few bills as a result
of their decision to return to work today.
Any celebration of Saturday's settlement is a
hollow one, however. Neither the University nor
the USW "won" the strike. And not only they but
the students and the University community as a
whole have suffered a great loss.
It would be difficult to determine exactly who
was responsible for the way in which the University
and the USW confronted each other during nego
tiations and the strike period. What became clear
almost immediately was that there is nothing sacred
to labor-management negotiations simply because
they are held on the campus of a major university.
When it came down to the bottom line — money —
idealism went out the window and pure power-poli
tics came to dominate the situation. The confronta
tion developed into a gigantic game of hardball in
which the contestants lost perspective, believing
that victory was only possible through a decisive
defeat of the other side.

It is unfortunate that both the University and the
USW chose to deal with each other in this manner.
The apparent intrarisigence of the University's
bargaining position and the final terms of the settle
ment only give credence to those who associate
Stanford with the "robber-baron" image of its
founder.
As for the USW, the violence and vandalism of
the past weeks as well as the union's confronta
tional orientation toward management hark back
to the early days of organized labor. Broken wind
shields, punctured tires and threats of bodily harm
will not soon be forgotten.
Particularly distressing is the fact that the Uni
versity failed to show much concern for the effect
that the strike had on students. The University's ne
gotiators were willing to wait just as long as it took
to bring the USW to the University's terms. After
all, the students had no food and workers had no
paychecks but the University saved over a million
dollars in unpaid payroll during the strike.
As USW members return to work today, it will be
hard to expect much in the way of enthusiasm or
diligence. Despite claims of newly consolidated
strength, the workers are disgruntled and dis
unified. Similarly, conflicts have surfaced between
faculty and administration members over the treat
ment of the strike, and they could prove damaging.
Last but not least, students are far from satisfied
with a settlement that cannot be celebrated and a
victory that belongs to no one.
