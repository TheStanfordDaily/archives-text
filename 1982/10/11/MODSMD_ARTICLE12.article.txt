# Education not just vocational
## 
### 
If the entering class's first choice of academic in
terest is any indication, the prospect of having to re
pay thousands of dollars of loans upon graduation
and an economy that gives scant hope to students
seeking jobs have again taken their toll on the
pursuit of a liberal education.
The Class of '86 contains a much higher per
centage of prospective engineers (22.2 percent) than
did the class entering five years before (13.4 per
cent), and this shift has come largely at the expense
of students who plan to study within the humanities
(9.7 percent, down from 12.1 percent five years ago)
and social sciences (a drop from 29.5 percent to 23.9
percent). While this initial choice may change as
some students find they prefer Shakespeare or po
litical analysis over vectors and concrete's stress
factors, the general trend is nevertheless disturbing.
Although engineering can be intellectually
fascinating, the impulse behind the shifting figures
remains a desire to graduate from Stanford into a
well-paying, secure job — and to avoid the insecuri
ty, soul-searching and slimmer job prospects typi
cal of students majoring in the humanities and so
cial sciences.
Yet it is partly these very reasons that make the
humanities and social sciences such a crucial part of
a Stanford education. There is tremendous value in
studying one's world from different perspectives, in
taking full advantage of the resources of the Uni
versity and in spending four years in dialogue
through reading and writing with great minds of the

past and present — before embarking on whatever
career for which that eclectic and humanistic train
ing has excellently prepared.
These are the only four years most students will
have to sample the intellectual products of cen
turies, to be surrounded by the brightest professors
in an array of disciplines and to master reading and
writing skills necessary to further inquiry after col
lege; there is something pathetic in this time being
treated as vocational education restricted to nar
row disciplines.
There is, too, hope for the humilities or social
science major after graduation. A broad, liberal
arts education has provided challenging careers
and the opportunity for almost any type of job for
thousands of Stanford graduates. Tales of waiting
tables following completion of an English degree
no more determine class choice than the
equally illusory notion that a political science
degree makes you presidential timber, yes, both
happen, but there are plenty of other choices.
We hope, too, that this shift in interest caused by
economic anxiety does not weaken the University's
commitment to its social science and humanities
programs. Education cannot respond only to mar
ket pressures: the principles of a liberal arts educa
tion remain the basis of the University, and the shift
demands, if anything, greater funding and atten
tion for programs threatened by unnecessarily in
secure entering classes.
