## An alternative to the regressive flat-rate tax 
### 
President Reagan, who in 1970 law
fully used our complicated tax system
to avoid paying any state and all but a
few hundred dollars in federal income
taxes, recwhy announced his support
for the so-called simplified "fiat tax." A
flat-tax system could shrink the
phonebook-thick tax code to the size of
a Daily football issue by eliminating all
deductions, shelters and special prefer
ences, while imposing a single tax rate
on all taxpayers.
Unfortunately, Reagan is interested
in a fiat-tax proposal authored by Alvin
Rabushka and Robert Hall of the Hoo
ver Institution. In essence, the Hoover
proposal is anti-working person and
very regressive, a characterization that
should come as no surprise to those fa
miliar with Hoover's collection of right
wing publicists masquerading as
"scholars." There is, however, an alter
native "Simple Tax" plan which is not
designed, like the Hoover/Reagan pro
posal, to shift the income tax burden
from the wealthiest of private capital to
the middle-class.
One need not look hard to unearth
the glaring inequities of Rabushka's
and Hall's single-rate tax.
The primary reason for opposition to
a fiat tax without any progressive tax
brackets — the Hoover/Reagan pro
posal — is that social security "taxes"
fall far more heavily on low and middle
income individuals. A worker earning
$30,000 or less pays 6.7 percent of his
income in social security taxes while the
typical senior tax attorney in a Wash
ington law firm, who earns more than
$200,000, contributes less than 1 per
cent of his earnings. Most state sales
and property taxes are similarly regres
sive. Thus, in the absence of some
progressive rates, low and middle in
come persons will be taxed at a higher
aggregate rate than the wealthy.
Under the Hoover Institution's re
gressive flat tax proposal, individuals
earning $30,000 would pay an effective
rate (assuming an 18 percent flat rate)
of almost 25 percent while wealthy cor

porate lawyers would pay only 19 per
cent.
Even ignoring Social Security taxes,
the tax shift onto the middle class and
working poor under the Hoo
ver/Reagan plan is enormous. Accord
ing to Henry Aaron of the Brookings
Institution, income taxes for persons in
all tax brackets below 550,0 CX) would in
crease, while taxpayers with incomes
between $100,000 and $500,000 would
enjoy cuts averaging 40percent.
Although Reagan's support for a flat
tax may be anchored in his old rhetoric
that "there can be no moral justifi
cation for the progressive income tax,"
neither is there justification for a pat
ently regressive tax system. The real is
sue is whether the current tax system
which openly invites fraud and is under
stood by only a handful of tax attorneys
and Stanford law professors, should be
simplified. We agree the system should
be radically simplified, but a solution
must take Social Security payments
into account.
In order to deal with the inequities of
the regressive 6.7 percent social security
tax (remember that only the first
$32,400 in earned income is subject to
any social security taxes) we propose a
two-tier rax rate: 18 percent for individ
uals with income less than $50,000 and
25 percent for those with income more
than $50,000. The other provisions, in
what we refer to as the Simple Tax, are
as follows:
• An exclusion from tax of the firlt
$7500 of income per individual and
$ 15,000 for a married couple.
• A $200 tax credit per dependent
(equivalent ofsl 100 tax deduction at 18
percent rate).
• No other exclusions, exemptions or
preferences of any kind, no matter how
meritorious.
• All income, from whatever source,
should be taxed. For example, all capi
tal gains should be fully included.
Without reform, the entire tax
burden may one day be borne exclusive
ly by the poor and the middle class. For

example, no corporate lobbyist has
dared present the undisputed Treasury
data demonstrating the quiet but radi
cal shift of the tax burden over the last
three decades from the wealthy to the
middle class.
Specifically, 30 years ago (1950) so
cial security taxes contributed only $3
billion to the federal Treasury while
corporate and individual taxes each
contributed $17 billion.
Today, this relationship has been to
tally reversed, despite an absence of any
public discussion. Social security's
highly regressive taxes will contribute
almost four times as much as corpo
rations ($lB6 billion versus $47 billion).
And individuals will pay in nearly $300
billion, six times the corporate share.
As a first step to remedy this virtual
repeal of the corporate income tax, and
to correspond to our Simple Tax, we fa
vor lowering of the present 46 percent
corporate tax to a maximum of 25 per
cent. However, all tax preferences and
special credits for corporations should
be eliminated. The only exception
would be the exclusion of the first
$50,000 in income from all but a nomi
nal 10 percent corporate tax.
In 1982, corporations will pay taxes
of only $47 billion. It is estimated that
true corporate income, after elimina
tion of all special preferences and cred
its is probably between $400 and $500
billion. A 25 percent tax on $400 billion
would produce revenue of $100 billion,
or twice the present amount achieved
from the nominal 46 percent tax rate
which, for example, permits many
banks to pay no corporate income tax
whatsoever.
Whatever simplified tax system pre
vails, the general public's benefit is not
an immediate reduction in taxes. The
advantages are long-range and more
fundamental to a participatory, self
sufficient democracy.
The debate about who pays how
much to support their government
should be right out in front of the peo
ple, not hidden behind an incom

prehensible labyrinth of code clauses.
The majority of Americans would no
longer be dependent on outside as
sitance to understand and complete
their most important annual document
(last year 52 percent sought such as
sistance to complete their tax forms.
Those who can afford to hire Wash
ington, D.C.'s 14,000 lobbyists to ma
nipulate our system, without scruples
or public scrutiny, would no longer
have an advantage over the 99 percent
of Americans who cannot.
The Internal Revenue Code consists
of 1764 pages and has 110 major catego
ries of tax exemptions. In addition,
there are at least 44 separate forms that
can be filed regarding individual taxes.
As a result of such complexity,
billionaire Bunker Hunt, according to
Fortune magazine, paid less than 10
dollars in federal taxes during the years
1975-1977. Similarly, Reagan
paid no federal tax in 1970 and his at
torney general recently secured tax
shelter deductions three times the value
of his actual investment.
Like the patriots who attended the
Boston Tea Party, the general public is
fed up with "taxation without represen
tation." A tax code infested with special
interest loopholes and too complicated
for public comprehension, let alone de
bate, is oppressive and intolerable in a
democracy.
Most Americans hunger to have faith
in a strongly desire to deal honestly with
their government. The Simple Tax sys
tem in which all pay an understood and
agreed-upon fair share and in which no
one is able to carve out special, ine
quitable preferences may be a first step
in restoring this faith and integrity.
Shakespeare's popular remedy for
the ills of society, as expressed in Henry
VI, was, "The first thing we do, let's kill
all the lawyers." The Simple Tax could
go well beyond this by knocking off a
few thousand accountants as well.
