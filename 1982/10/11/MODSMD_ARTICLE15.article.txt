## Another strikes no-win result 
### 
Once upon a time, a long time ago, in
a land far, far away, across the moun
tains and the plains in a town of ivy
covered Gothic towers, there erupted a
great battle, memories of which still
evoke bitterness and tears.
There, in the fall of 1977, at Yale Uni
versity, maintenance and dining hall
workers went out on strike, leaving a
peaceful community of scholars
without basic services for four months.
"The university is trying to break the
union," the union leaders cried.
"The union is making unreasonable
demands on a financially strapped uni
versity," the administration returned.
At first it seemed almost a carnival:
strikers paraded with placards, students
stocked their refrigerators with donuts
supplied by the university every morn
ing by the hundreds.
And then the donuts began to attract
ants and turn stale as they piled up on
students' dressers. Hotplates became as
common as textbooks in student
rooms, despite the fire hazards and the
stern protestation of university of
ficials. Hallways became cluttered with
garbage in overflowing hefty bags
which spilled onto stairways. New spec
ies of microorganisms multiplied in
bathroom corners. Students sat on their
Salvation Army furniture, eating
donuts and take-out pizzas.
Both the union and the university
stood firmly by their principles, con
vinced of their righteousness.
And then finally, it was over.

Union members claimed the settle
ment as a great victory. Yet, when they
finally did gain some of the salary in
crease that they had been seeking, the
newspapers grimly reported that it
would be years before their additional
earnings would compensate them for
the four months of salary that they had
lost.
The university laughed its way to the

would break out between students
crossing picket lines and angry strikers
standing outside all day in the cold.
They didn't expect the conflicts be
tween students who crossed picket lines
to buy meals in university dining halls
run by the managerial staff or who took
it upon themselves to clean the bath
rooms, and students who wouldn't
break the strike, many believing that
only the deterioration of student health

But, like a great many other business analysts, the
university administration failed to include the
intangible costs in their equations: the costs that

bank with hundreds of thousands of
dollars in tuition paid but not dis
tributed in salaries, and with the smug
belief that it had saved even more over a
long term. But, like a great many other
business analysts, the university admin
istration failed to include the intangible
costs in their equations: the costs that
don't show up on a balance sheet.
They didn't calculate the wear and
tear on university buildings and equip
ment which went unmaintained for four
months.
They didn't consider the effect on
student morale, for they didn't see un
dernourished students huddled in their
rooms or crowded in restaurants with
the same people day after day.
They didn't anticipate the fights that

and university buildings would force an
end to the strike. I
They didn't anticipate having to call
the police to arrest students who would
lie down outside the physical plant one
morning before sunrise to prevent the
delivery of fuel to the university.
Nor did they really expect that even
five years later, some students wouldfe
main bitter, choosing to do their gradu
ate work elsewhere and never really
feeling a part of that supposedly great
university. ;
After four months, everything was
the same again, except for one thing. It
just never really was the same again.
