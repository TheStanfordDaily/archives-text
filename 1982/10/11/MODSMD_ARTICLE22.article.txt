# Hons drives ASU by Stanford in final minute
## 
### SID SPAETH 
Tempe, Ark. — The heralded
match-up of the Stanford offense
and Arizona State defense faded
into the background as an inex
perienced and unlikely hero
drove Arizona State to a final
minute, 80-yard touchdown
drive and a 21-17 win over Stan
ford here Saturday night.
Arizona State junior quarter
, back Todd Hons negated an 80-
;yard Stanford drive moments
-earlier, and steered his much ma
ligned Sun Devil offense to the
-winning touchdown over a
stunned Stanford defense in front
of 70,823 delirious fans at Sun
Devil Stadium.
"I won't sleep tonight," a
l teary-eyed ASU coach Darryl
Rogers said. "I'm emotionally
drained."
; After John Elway had picked
_ his way over the nation's best and
* blitzingest defense for a go-ahead
•touchdown with 48 seconds re
maining, Hons set off on the
r'"heartbreaker".

'I won't sleep

Darryl Rodgers

Stanford went into its prevent
defense and Hons began attack
- ing the unprotected middle of the
'Cardinal secondary.
i A swing pass to running back
Willie Gittens picked up 14
yards, a pass over the middle to
i Doug Allen netted 16 and the
J Sun Devils were at midfield.
"They were extra-conscious of
' the sideline, so I took what they
j gave me," Hons said. "The
| middle was open."
The Sun Devil front line easily
I shut down Stanford's three-man
r pass rush and Hons hit Jerome
£ Weatherspoon over the middle
j? for 22 yards.
"Even though our two-minute
offense hadn't produced any
thing all year, I was confident,"
*"*Hons said. "I could feel that the
! dther guys were confident.
!. "We started out just trying to
it close for a field gosl. A tie is
fetter than a loss. But then we re
alized we had a chance for a
- touchdown."
Hons's next pass fell in
complete, but with 20 seconds re
maining he hit a streaking
j Weatherspoon on a post pattern
I in front of cornerback Kevin
| Baird before being hauled down
—at the one-vard line.
"The last catch by Jerome
* (Weatherspoon) was heroic,"
| Rodgers said. "Todd Hons was
| absolutely super and the kids
| caught the ball. The first few
I plays we took what they gave us,
| but the last two catches were
112 more than we could've asked
i Fullback Dwaine Wright
slammed over right tackle for the
touchdown on the next play,
j - The touchdown brought re
" demption to Wright, who had
fumbled into the end zone on the
x same play call in Arizona State's
drive earlier in the quarter.
Stanford safety Vaughn Wil
liams pounced on the ball and it

set up the Cardinal's go-ahead
touchdown drive.
"I was just hoping I wasn't
going to cost us the game,"
Wright said. "Gittens came onto
the field with the play — five
wedge. He said 'Tex, they're
going to give you another
chance.' That's what I wanted to
hear."
Rodgers said he called the play
to get the touchdown, not to re
deem Wright.
"If we had come up short, we
would have used our last time
out and made a decision," Rog
ers said. "We probably would
have thrown one quick fade
(pass). If that was incomplete, I
imagine we would have said,
'OK, let's take the field goal.' "
But Wright said he would have
none of that.
"When 1 took my stance, I
said, *OK Tex, put it in there.' I
knew there was no way they were
going to stop me."
Hons's drive shocked most of
the sell-out crowd, but not Stan
ford coach Paul Wiggin.
"It was a heartbreaker of a
game to lose," Wiggin said. "But
it was the type of game we
couldn't stop. If ASU can drive
(for a touchdown) in 45 seconds,
they deserve to win.
"We had more respect for their
offense than what the press wrote
about. So many people em
phasize that defense and forget
they have an offense."
The top-ranked ASU defense
held Elway to 209 yards passing
— the first defense to hold the
Heisman Trophy candidate un
der 300 yards passing all season.
Double safety blitzes by Paul
Moyer and Mike Richardson
gave fits to Stanford blockers and
dumped Elway four times.
"It was the best defense we've
played (against) since I've been
here," Wiggin said. "The safety
blitzes gave us the most trouble.
They sent two safeties up the
middle putting pressure on John
(Elway) and we didn't have time
to get downfield."
Elway said the highly touted
Sun Devil linebackers and
linemen were not a factor, but
Moyer and Richardson were.
"(All-America linebacker Ver
non) Maxwell was not a factor,"
Elway said. "It was just a matter
of picking up the safeties. Rich
ardson and Moyer were getting
through.''- r. <
And when they were not get
ting through, Stanford was hold
ing them and getting caught.
Numerous Stanford "big
plays" were walked back because
of holding calls. "It was frustrat
ing," Elway said. "Every time
we'd get something going, there
would be a holding penalty or (il
legal) procedure or something
stupid like that. We seemed to be
working against ourselves."
Stanford finally put it together
on its go-ahead drive.
A defensive holding penalty on
a fourth-and-eight incomplete
pass to Chris Dressel gave Stan
ford an automatic first down at
the ASU 45-yard line.
Flanker Emile Harry took the
ball on an end-around, dodged a
tackier and lofted an ugly, but
complete pass to a sprawling
Dressel at the 15. Dressel rolled
completely over before cradling
the ball in his chest for the recep
tion.
The Sun Devils blitzed nine

men on the next play and Mike
Tolliver beat cornerback Duane
Galloway in the left corner of the
end zone before Elway found him
for the 15-yard touchdown strike
— the first touchdown pass
against Arizona State this sea
son.

from the one-yard line moments before he handed off to fullback Dwaine Wright for the winning
touchdown. The scoreboard explains the situation.
Tempe, Ark. — The heralded
match-up of the Stanford offense
and Arizona State defense faded
into the background as an inex
perienced and unlikely hero
drove Arizona State to a final
minute, 80-yard touchdown
drive and a 21-17 win over Stan
ford here Saturday night.
Arizona State junior quarter
, back Todd Hons negated an 80-
;yard Stanford drive moments
-earlier, and steered his much ma
ligned Sun Devil offense to the
-winning touchdown over a
stunned Stanford defense in front
of 70,823 delirious fans at Sun
Devil Stadium.
"I won't sleep tonight," a
l teary-eyed ASU coach Darryl
Rogers said. "I'm emotionally
drained."
; After John Elway had picked
_ his way over the nation's best and
* blitzingest defense for a go-ahead
•touchdown with 48 seconds re
maining, Hons set off on the
r'"heartbreaker".

Stanford went into its prevent
defense and Hons began attack
- ing the unprotected middle of the
'Cardinal secondary.
i A swing pass to running back
Willie Gittens picked up 14
yards, a pass over the middle to
i Doug Allen netted 16 and the
J Sun Devils were at midfield.
"They were extra-conscious of
' the sideline, so I took what they
j gave me," Hons said. "The
| middle was open."
The Sun Devil front line easily
I shut down Stanford's three-man
r pass rush and Hons hit Jerome
£ Weatherspoon over the middle
j? for 22 yards.
"Even though our two-minute
offense hadn't produced any
thing all year, I was confident,"
*"*Hons said. "I could feel that the
! dther guys were confident.
!. "We started out just trying to
it close for a field gosl. A tie is
fetter than a loss. But then we re
alized we had a chance for a
- touchdown."
Hons's next pass fell in
complete, but with 20 seconds re
maining he hit a streaking
j Weatherspoon on a post pattern
I in front of cornerback Kevin
| Baird before being hauled down
—at the one-vard line.
"The last catch by Jerome
* (Weatherspoon) was heroic,"
| Rodgers said. "Todd Hons was
| absolutely super and the kids
| caught the ball. The first few
I plays we took what they gave us,
| but the last two catches were
112 more than we could've asked
i Fullback Dwaine Wright
slammed over right tackle for the
touchdown on the next play,
j - The touchdown brought re
" demption to Wright, who had
fumbled into the end zone on the
x same play call in Arizona State's
drive earlier in the quarter.
Stanford safety Vaughn Wil
liams pounced on the ball and it

set up the Cardinal's go-ahead
touchdown drive.
"I was just hoping I wasn't
going to cost us the game,"
Wright said. "Gittens came onto
the field with the play — five
wedge. He said 'Tex, they're
going to give you another
chance.' That's what I wanted to
hear."
Rodgers said he called the play
to get the touchdown, not to re
deem Wright.
"If we had come up short, we
would have used our last time
out and made a decision," Rog
ers said. "We probably would
have thrown one quick fade
(pass). If that was incomplete, I
imagine we would have said,
'OK, let's take the field goal.' "
But Wright said he would have
none of that.
"When 1 took my stance, I
said, *OK Tex, put it in there.' I
knew there was no way they were
going to stop me."
Hons's drive shocked most of
the sell-out crowd, but not Stan
ford coach Paul Wiggin.
"It was a heartbreaker of a
game to lose," Wiggin said. "But
it was the type of game we
couldn't stop. If ASU can drive
(for a touchdown) in 45 seconds,
they deserve to win.
"We had more respect for their
offense than what the press wrote
about. So many people em
phasize that defense and forget
they have an offense."
The top-ranked ASU defense
held Elway to 209 yards passing
— the first defense to hold the
Heisman Trophy candidate un
der 300 yards passing all season.
Double safety blitzes by Paul
Moyer and Mike Richardson
gave fits to Stanford blockers and
dumped Elway four times.
"It was the best defense we've
played (against) since I've been
here," Wiggin said. "The safety
blitzes gave us the most trouble.
They sent two safeties up the
middle putting pressure on John
(Elway) and we didn't have time
to get downfield."
Elway said the highly touted
Sun Devil linebackers and
linemen were not a factor, but
Moyer and Richardson were.
"(All-America linebacker Ver
non) Maxwell was not a factor,"
Elway said. "It was just a matter
of picking up the safeties. Rich
ardson and Moyer were getting
through.''- r. <
And when they were not get
ting through, Stanford was hold
ing them and getting caught.
Numerous Stanford "big
plays" were walked back because
of holding calls. "It was frustrat
ing," Elway said. "Every time
we'd get something going, there
would be a holding penalty or (il
legal) procedure or something
stupid like that. We seemed to be
working against ourselves."
Stanford finally put it together
on its go-ahead drive.
A defensive holding penalty on
a fourth-and-eight incomplete
pass to Chris Dressel gave Stan
ford an automatic first down at
the ASU 45-yard line.
Flanker Emile Harry took the
ball on an end-around, dodged a
tackier and lofted an ugly, but
complete pass to a sprawling
Dressel at the 15. Dressel rolled
completely over before cradling
the ball in his chest for the recep
tion.
The Sun Devils blitzed nine

men on the next play and Mike
Tolliver beat cornerback Duane
Galloway in the left corner of the
end zone before Elway found him
for the 15-yard touchdown strike
— the first touchdown pass
against Arizona State this sea
son.

THE FINAL CONFRONTATION: Arizona State quarterback Todd Hons screams signals
from the one-yard line moments before he handed off to fullback Dwaine Wright for the winning
touchdown. The scoreboard explains the situation.
Tempe, Ark. — The heralded
match-up of the Stanford offense
and Arizona State defense faded
into the background as an inex
perienced and unlikely hero
drove Arizona State to a final
minute, 80-yard touchdown
drive and a 21-17 win over Stan
ford here Saturday night.
Arizona State junior quarter
, back Todd Hons negated an 80-
;yard Stanford drive moments
-earlier, and steered his much ma
ligned Sun Devil offense to the
-winning touchdown over a
stunned Stanford defense in front
of 70,823 delirious fans at Sun
Devil Stadium.
"I won't sleep tonight," a
l teary-eyed ASU coach Darryl
Rogers said. "I'm emotionally
drained."
; After John Elway had picked
_ his way over the nation's best and
* blitzingest defense for a go-ahead
•touchdown with 48 seconds re
maining, Hons set off on the
r'"heartbreaker".

Darryl Rodgers

Stanford went into its prevent
defense and Hons began attack
- ing the unprotected middle of the
'Cardinal secondary.
i A swing pass to running back
Willie Gittens picked up 14
yards, a pass over the middle to
i Doug Allen netted 16 and the
J Sun Devils were at midfield.
"They were extra-conscious of
' the sideline, so I took what they
j gave me," Hons said. "The
| middle was open."
The Sun Devil front line easily
I shut down Stanford's three-man
r pass rush and Hons hit Jerome
£ Weatherspoon over the middle
j? for 22 yards.
"Even though our two-minute
offense hadn't produced any
thing all year, I was confident,"
*"*Hons said. "I could feel that the
! dther guys were confident.
!. "We started out just trying to
it close for a field gosl. A tie is
fetter than a loss. But then we re
alized we had a chance for a
- touchdown."
Hons's next pass fell in
complete, but with 20 seconds re
maining he hit a streaking
j Weatherspoon on a post pattern
I in front of cornerback Kevin
| Baird before being hauled down
—at the one-vard line.
"The last catch by Jerome
* (Weatherspoon) was heroic,"
| Rodgers said. "Todd Hons was
| absolutely super and the kids
| caught the ball. The first few
I plays we took what they gave us,
| but the last two catches were
112 more than we could've asked
i Fullback Dwaine Wright
slammed over right tackle for the
touchdown on the next play,
j - The touchdown brought re
" demption to Wright, who had
fumbled into the end zone on the
x same play call in Arizona State's
drive earlier in the quarter.
Stanford safety Vaughn Wil
liams pounced on the ball and it

set up the Cardinal's go-ahead
touchdown drive.
"I was just hoping I wasn't
going to cost us the game,"
Wright said. "Gittens came onto
the field with the play — five
wedge. He said 'Tex, they're
going to give you another
chance.' That's what I wanted to
hear."
Rodgers said he called the play
to get the touchdown, not to re
deem Wright.
"If we had come up short, we
would have used our last time
out and made a decision," Rog
ers said. "We probably would
have thrown one quick fade
(pass). If that was incomplete, I
imagine we would have said,
'OK, let's take the field goal.' "
But Wright said he would have
none of that.
"When 1 took my stance, I
said, *OK Tex, put it in there.' I
knew there was no way they were
going to stop me."
Hons's drive shocked most of
the sell-out crowd, but not Stan
ford coach Paul Wiggin.
"It was a heartbreaker of a
game to lose," Wiggin said. "But
it was the type of game we
couldn't stop. If ASU can drive
(for a touchdown) in 45 seconds,
they deserve to win.
"We had more respect for their
offense than what the press wrote
about. So many people em
phasize that defense and forget
they have an offense."
The top-ranked ASU defense
held Elway to 209 yards passing
— the first defense to hold the
Heisman Trophy candidate un
der 300 yards passing all season.
Double safety blitzes by Paul
Moyer and Mike Richardson
gave fits to Stanford blockers and
dumped Elway four times.
"It was the best defense we've
played (against) since I've been
here," Wiggin said. "The safety
blitzes gave us the most trouble.
They sent two safeties up the
middle putting pressure on John
(Elway) and we didn't have time
to get downfield."
Elway said the highly touted
Sun Devil linebackers and
linemen were not a factor, but
Moyer and Richardson were.
"(All-America linebacker Ver
non) Maxwell was not a factor,"
Elway said. "It was just a matter
of picking up the safeties. Rich
ardson and Moyer were getting
through.''- r. <
And when they were not get
ting through, Stanford was hold
ing them and getting caught.
Numerous Stanford "big
plays" were walked back because
of holding calls. "It was frustrat
ing," Elway said. "Every time
we'd get something going, there
would be a holding penalty or (il
legal) procedure or something
stupid like that. We seemed to be
working against ourselves."
Stanford finally put it together
on its go-ahead drive.
A defensive holding penalty on
a fourth-and-eight incomplete
pass to Chris Dressel gave Stan
ford an automatic first down at
the ASU 45-yard line.
Flanker Emile Harry took the
ball on an end-around, dodged a
tackier and lofted an ugly, but
complete pass to a sprawling
Dressel at the 15. Dressel rolled
completely over before cradling
the ball in his chest for the recep
tion.
The Sun Devils blitzed nine

men on the next play and Mike
Tolliver beat cornerback Duane
Galloway in the left corner of the
end zone before Elway found him
for the 15-yard touchdown strike
— the first touchdown pass
against Arizona State this sea
son.
