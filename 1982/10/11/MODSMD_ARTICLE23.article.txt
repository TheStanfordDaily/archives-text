Tempe, Ariz. — Todd Hons
stood for a lot of things when
he led his Arizona State of
fense on their 80-yard, 38-sec
ond victory march Saturday.
But mostly he stood for
himself.
The Arizona press, student
body and alumni had resigned
themselves to not liking Hons.
Hons, after all, stumbled
into the starting role when
Tom Onofrio was injured at
the outset of the season, fans
would say.

The Sporting Muse

Darryl Rodgers didn't
think he stumbled in. He
knew the quarterback battle
was piping hot. Hons lost, but
not by much.
Paul Wiggin didn't think he
stumbled either.
"We had more respect for
their offense than what the
press wrote about " Wiggin
said.
Hons is not a bad quarter
back.
He has completed nearly 50
percent of his passes for 848
yards and four touchdowns,
but the important statistic is
6-0 — his record.
Before the season started,
he had thrown one forward
pass as a college quarterback.
Now, thrust upon the scene as
the leader of the one of the na
tion's best teams, he rides the
back seat to a remarkable de
fense.
The first time in his career
he had to score a touchdown
he was given 48 seconds to do
it.
Stanford had a three-point
lead and kicked off. The
crowd wanted a good return

so the Sun Devils could get a
field goal and tie. They didn't
get one and (groan) Hons
came on.
Calm, stoic and confident,
he ran onto the same field
John Elway had just trotted
off. College football's king
would watch the rat catcher
scratch at his throne.
Only a few people thought
of Hons at the time — both
coaches, Elway and Hons.*
He shouted signals amid deaf
ening cheers, standing tall —
standing for himself. Some
one had to.
"I was confident," Hons
said. "Even though our two
minute offense hadn't pro
duced anything all year."
It never had to.
Some of the 70,823 fans
were skeptical, others
hopeful; but at least two peo
ple on Stanford's bench were
worried. Hons alone stood
confident.
And then Hons did it, and
there was celebration, and
people trying to remember
games that were as good.
"The year J.J. (John Jef
ferson) made 'the catch'
against Arizona," one man
offered. Another disagreed.
And then Hons became, at
least until his next intercep
tion, "a great quarterback."
Fans and writers were
saying he beat Elway and won
the dual of the drives. He did.
Fans and writers were com
paring him to Elway. Emo
tion is powerful stuff.
Todd Hons is not a great
quarterback.
Saturday, he was a good
quarterback, but more impor
tant, he was a winner as he has
been all year.
6-0 is a pretty important
statistic.
