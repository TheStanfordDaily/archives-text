### STEPHEN STRENG 
In a contest between two unevenly matched teams, the Stanford
women's volleyball team easily handled the weaker Long Beach State
49ers 15-3, 13-4, 15-6, in a Western Collegiate Athletic Association
match Friday night at Maples Pavilion.
The Cardinal showed signs of relaxing after rolling to wins in the
first two games, missing several serves and committing numerous er
rors. This allowed the 49 ers to jump to only their second lead of the
match in the third game, 3-2.
Long Beach was also aided by their key player, six-foot-four junior
middle blocker, Michele Aguirre, who had not played much of a fac
tor up to that point in the match. Nonetheless, Stanford managed to
take the lead at 4-3 and went on to win the match-deciding game.
The win raised Stanford's league record to 3-1 and 12-5 overall.
Long Beach is now 0-5 in conference play and 6-14 for the season.
In the first game, the Cardinal played to an 11-1 lead, showing no
hint of a letdown from the previous night's emotional upset of
number-one ranked San Diego State. The 49ers posed no threat
throughout the game and the Card went on to win it easily.
Again, in the second game, the Cardinal jumped to a quick advan
tage, 8-0. In the game Long Beach was able to score only four points,
most of those coming on line net violations by Stanford. The Cardinal
was able to substitute freely throughout the match.
Only two injured players, senior backcourt specialist Kisi Haine
and sophomore outside hitter Karen Lysaght, did not see action. Most
notable of the substitutes were junior outside hitter Julie Baker and
sophomore middle blocker Brandace Hope, who both had several
kills to keep the 49ers at bay.
The Cardinal next plays California at Maples at 7:30 on Wednesday
night. Stanford will be seeking revenge for an earlier, hotly-contested
loss at the Berkeley Invitational.
