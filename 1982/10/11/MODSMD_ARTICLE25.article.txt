# SJS edges Cardinal in OT
## 
### JOHN KELLY 
The Stanford men's soccer
team dominated the flow of play
and almost pulled off a surprise,
but nationally-ranked San Jose
State clamped down for a 2-1 ov
ertime win at Maloney Field Sat
urday.
It was a bitter loss for the
Cardinal, not only because this
was the first Pacific Coast Athlet
ic Association Conference
match, and a crucial game for
postseason playoff hopes, but be
cause they seemed to have the
game won down to the final
minutes of play.
The pace for the game was set
early in the first half as Stanford
began to control the ball in mid
field and attacked the SJS goal
with long penetrating passes.
Chances came quickly for the
Cardinal, but the strikers could
not find the net. Angel Vazquez
nearly opened the scoring with a
corner kick that cracked off the
post and Todd Rafalovich
pushed a shot past the goal
keeper, but just outside of the
post.
The quickness of the SJS for
wards began to show. The

Spartans relied on goalkeeper
Kvan Moore to pass the ball up
and engineer quick coun
terattacks upon the Stanford
goal. Yet the Stanford defenders
easily contained them, and the
only difficult save Stanford goal
keeper Willie Burkhardt had to
make was on a head pass back
from one of his own fullbacks.
Senior Doug Clark continually
got above the SJS forwards to
head away all long balls.
The second half began in the
same mold as the first as Stanford
again came close to breaking the
scoreless deadlock. First it was a
crossing pass from Vazquez that
Giancarlo Ferruzzi pushed just
bv the goalpost, and then Vas
quez headed a chipped ball by
Fred Ueland over the bar.
Stanford finally broke the tie
when Bruce Finley pushed a ball
through the SJS defense to Todd
Rafalovich, who beat a defender
and slipped the ball between the
goalkeeper and the post for the
goal.
It seemed certain that Stanford
would be able to hold on for the
win as the clock ran down,
though the Spartans pressed ev

eryone forward to get the equal
izer. Scrambling tackles by the
fullbacks and saves by goal
keeper Willie Burkhardt re
peatedly turned the rush away.
But fatigue and the speed of
the SJS forwards proved too
much and with one minute left in
the game, a defensive error left a
man open in front of the goal wth
the ball. In an effort to save a
goal, Burkhardt fouled the
Spartan. The ensuing penalty
kick was scored by SJS's Matt
McDowell, tying the game at 1-1
and sending it into overtime.
"It was just too bad ... we
have a way of getting those penal
ties at the wrong time â€” with one
minute left," said Coach Nelson
Lodge. "We're young, and we
need to work on our poise. After
the goal, we let them come. Mis
takes like that in the goal are dev
astating ... then they were on a
roll."
The Spartans scored the win
ning goal early in the overtime
against a fatigued Cardinal
squad.
Stanford will play Santa Clara
Wednesday at 2 p.m.
