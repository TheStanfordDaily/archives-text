### SHAILENDRA BHUMRALKAR 
Both of Stanford's cross
country teams ran fine races
this weekend at the Stanford
College Invitational. The
women had an easy victory,
collecting 20 points in finish
ing ahead of Cal Poly-
Pomona with 61 and Idaho
with 118. The men placed
third with 127 points, behind
winner UCLA with 46 and
BYU with 105.
The women placed the top
three finishers in this 20-team
meet. Sophomore Ceci Hopp
set a meet record of 16:41,
Alison Wiley ran a close sec
ond with 16:45, and Kim
Schnurpfeil finished in 16:56.
Regina Jacobs and Anne
Locke had times of 17:07 and
17:20, finishing fifth and
sixth, respectively.
Coach Brooks Johnson
said the women "did what
they had to do." He found
"nothing spectacular" in the
race because "we have a much
better team than the others."
Johnson said he thought it
was gratifying to have three
different winners in three
meets. But he stated that his
team is far from its potential.
"We still haven't been able to
get our seven best people
healthy," Johnson said.
The men recorded their best
finish ever in the 29-team
meet. Jim Smith ran 15th with
a time of 31:18, Brian Pet
tinger ran 20th in 31:25, and

Rvan Stoll placed 23rd in
31:27. Bill Graham was 33rd
with 31:53 and Ed Callaway
finished 39th in 31:58.
Coach MikeTomasello was
"pleased with the per
formance." He said that even
though co-captain Bill
Graham was ill, "the rest of
the guvs picked up the slack,
and that's the mark of a good
team."

'They did what they
had to do 9
â€” Stanford coach
Brooks Johnson

Tomasello felt that
freshman Stoll and junior
Callaway were the bright
spots of the race. "Stoll ran
his second consecutive out
standing race," he said. "He is
a bonus that we didn't count
on.
"It was a strong per
formance for our second
meet," Tomasello continued.
"The upperclassmen are giv
ing us strong leadership. We
have a lot more things to ac
complish, but we're on our
way to becoming a con
tender."
Both teams will head south
next weekend for the Cal
Poly-San Luis Obispo Invita
tional.
