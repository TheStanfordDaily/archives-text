# Stanford water poloists thrash California in 'Big Splash'
## 
### CHRIS ADDINGTON 
The number-two ranked Stanford water polo
team was nothing less than spectacular this week
end, running its record to 13-2 with impressive wins
over San Francisco State and UC-Berkeley at de-
Guerre Pool.
Saturday's 11-7 win over number-three Califor
nia was Stanford's first league game of the year.
Berkeley came into the game with its own im
pressive record, having lost only twice this season,
but this matchup was to be all Stanford's.
The Cardinal jumped to a quick lead on goals by
James Bergeson and Curtis Hanst and led 3-1 at the
end of the first quarter.
Cal came back with a tally by Peter Cutino at the
beginning of the second period, but the Cardinal re
fused to let its lead slip away. Jeff Stiling scored on a
Cal ejection, and then Kirk Jensen found the mark
on a razzle-dazzle hole shot and a long one from 10
meters. John Thompson squeezed one in for Cal
during the closing seconds to make it Stanford 6,
Berkeley 4 at the half.
Anyone who follows Stanford water polo knows
that the third quarter is Stanford's most prolific on
offense and its most tenacious on defense. The
Cardinal has outscored its opponents 45-17 in the
third period so far this year. This trend was to be
Berkeley's demise.

Two goals bv Bergeson and one by Stiling within
two minutes accelerated Stanford to a comfortable
five-goal margin, which proved too much for Cal to
overcome.
"So many times we get behind and have to play
catch up," commented Stanford coach Dante Det
tamanti. "This game, every time Cal got close we
widened the gap."
But the real key to Stanford's victory was exactly
what Dettamanti had predicted last week: the man
up situation. Stanford converted on five of its six
man-up situations. Berkeley had the opportunity
eight times but found the goal only twice.
Dettamanti praised the play of both Bergeson
and Jensen, who scored three and four goals respec
tively. "I've never seen Jensen shoot this well," Det
tamanti said.
The Cardinal began its double-header on Friday
afternoon by whipping the squad from San Francis
co 16-2 at deGuerre Pool. Stanford swept to a 6-0
first quarter lead and increased that to 14 before SF
State put one on the scoreboard. Bergeson, Jensen,
Greg Lambert and freshman John Woodberry
came up with double goal efforts, in addition to sin
gles from just about everyone else.
In the opening game Saturday the Stanford JVs
extended their unbeaten string to six for the season
with a 10-7 defeat of the Berkeley junior varsity.
