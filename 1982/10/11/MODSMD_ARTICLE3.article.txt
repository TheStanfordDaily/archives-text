University service, maintenance and
technical workers are back on the job
today, after voting overwhelmingly to
end the longest strike in Stanford his
tory.
University kitchens will begin serving
lunch today, according to Food Service
Manager Maxine Anderson.
In a sometimes raucous, closed meet
ing Saturday afternoon, the United
Stanford Workers accepted a new
three-year contract by a vote of
420-100. But union negotiators — and
many rank-and-file members — were
unhappy with the final settlement
which provides a 10 percent raise to
most workers this year.
"I'm no happier than anybody and I
can assure you of that," Union Ex
ecutive Secretary Michael Baratz told
the vocal Dinkelspiel audience. "There
isn't anybody on the negotiating com
mittee who is happy with the specifics."
During more than 16 hours of nego
tiation Thursday and Friday, the union
juggled numbers "to try to get more
money for more people earlier," Baratz
said. "About 85 percent will get a 10
percent raise the first year."
Baratz praised the group's unity.
"We gave them more than they ever ex
pected; 470 people voted to strike, 900
did. That's really good. You need to
have everyone working in the strike.
That's how you get more power right
away."
Union lawyer Paul Supton detailed
the amnesty agreement included in the
settlement. "The amnesty agreement
embodies the no on« will
be punished for striking," he explained.
"Everyone, regardless of whether or
not discipline is contemplated, will re
turn to work." Any discipline will be
imposed within 30 days of the worker's
return to work, he said.
Supton said the University indicated
that it does not intend to retaliate, al
though it would not put it in writing at
this time.
"I believe that the 30-days require

ment for the University to take action is
a signal to us of their intention not to
discipline on any large scale, but rather
an attempt to hold a small club over us
to make us be cool for that first month
back.
"That is," Supton continued, "the
University is still somewhat fearful that
we are going to retaliate against scabs
and supervisors who acted improper
ly."
Supton said he thought the Univer
sity would attempt disciplinary action
for gross misconduct only, "something
on the level of theft or assault ... we
have an agreement that insults and
namecalling are not subject to dis
cipline."
The amnesty agreement is better than
most, he said, but "it is not, however, a
blanket amnesty. We could get that
kind of agreement if we could have 1000
people stay out for a few more weeks
. . . you could probably get total amnes
ty sometime in April."
Supton, too, praised the union's ef
forts. "We were up against the largest
employer in this part of the country and
you held fast. You scared them and they
know you will strike if you have to
stand up for your rights."
To a chorus of cheers, Supton com
pared the Stanford dispute with the
strike of National Football League
players. "It (the NFL) has the ability to
shut off their employer's gate receipts.
Well, Mommy and Daddy paid tuition
long in advance . . . you can't cut off the
gate receipts."
Before the vote, negotiating team
members took turn's'aTlhe mTcJfophdne,
echoing Baratz's disappointment in the
tentative agreement.
"We fought as much as we could,"
SLAC worker Patrick Smith told the
group. "We have no choice but to ask
you to accept this."
"Stanford is going to pay a helluva
price for (its) labor policies," Tresidder
employee Linda Crouse said. "Donald
