# Grateful Dead fans turned away
## Counterfeit tickets sold 
### KAREN SPRINGEN 
Several hundred ticket-carrying fans were turned away from the Frost
Ampitheatre gates before Saturday's sold-out Grateful Dead concert be
cause their tickets, which they had purchased from scalpers, were coun
terfeit.
Two Oakland men were arrested at about noon Saturday on suspicion of
the sale, possession and forgery of the tickets. A blue van, believed to contain
the ticket supply and several more suspects, got away, according to Stanford
Police Chief Marvin Herrington. The suspects were booked at North Coun
ty jail.
Box office workers had immediately detected "several hundred" of the
forged tickets Saturday by checking serial numbers, said Shirley
Wasserman, box office manager for Bill Graham Presents.
Yesterday, in an effort to discourage fans from buying scalped tickets,
BGP placed "a couple hundred" guest tickets on sale at the gate yesterday,
Wasserman said.
Herrington said the forgery operation looked well-organized. "They
would have to have had access to fancy printing gear," he said.
The forged tickets were made with blank paper stock stolen from
Ticketron offices in the East Coast and in San Diego, Herrington said.
About 16,000 blanks were stolen.
"We had many people approach us saying they had bought tickets at the
gate. We had a bunch of very angry fans," said Stanford Police Sergeant
Philip Love. "These people had come from many states."
The Grateful Dead played to sold-out crowds Saturday and yesterday in
Frost in the first major concerts at the University in two years. Each after
noon, 9500 spectators attended the Dead's four-hour show.
