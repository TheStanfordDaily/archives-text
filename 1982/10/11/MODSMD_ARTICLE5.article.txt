Brush fires sweep Southern California
Los Angeles — Brush fires fanned by hot, dry Santa Ana winds rushed
from ridge to ridge across Southern California during the weekend, injuring
147 people and destroying 122 homes before dying down yesterday, accord
ing to officials who blamed arson in at least four of the cases.
Thousands of people fled choking smoke and red ash blown by screaming,
gale-force winds. Property damage was put at $36 million.
At least four of the seven fires were set and a fifth — the largest — was of
suspicious origin, authorities said.
The fires crackled through more than 74,000 acres of brush-covered hills
and tinder-dry valleys in five counties and sent blankets of smoke and soot
across the sky all weekend.
At least a half-dozen firefighters were among the injured. Several horses
were killed by motorists racing from fires, officials said.
Firefighters, battling the blazes on the ground 1000 strong, got a break
yesterday when the winds dropped off to 20 mph from their high of 60 mph.
That allowed 13 planes and seven helicopters equipped with water tankers to
take to the sky for the first time.
The largest fire which began in Dayton Canyon, about 35 miles northwest
of Los Angeles, charred 52,000 acres and caused an estimated $20 million
damage in its sweep to the Pacific Ocean.
