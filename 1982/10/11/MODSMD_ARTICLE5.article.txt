Brush fires sweep Southern California
Los Angeles — Brush fires fanned by hot, dry Santa Ana winds rushed
from ridge to ridge across Southern California during the weekend, injuring
147 people and destroying 122 homes before dying down yesterday, accord
ing to officials who blamed arson in at least four of the cases.
Thousands of people fled choking smoke and red ash blown by screaming,
gale-force winds. Property damage was put at $36 million.
At least four of the seven fires were set and a fifth — the largest — was of
suspicious origin, authorities said.
The fires crackled through more than 74,000 acres of brush-covered hills
and tinder-dry valleys in five counties and sent blankets of smoke and soot
across the sky all weekend.
At least a half-dozen firefighters were among the injured. Several horses
were killed by motorists racing from fires, officials said.
Firefighters, battling the blazes on the ground 1000 strong, got a break
yesterday when the winds dropped off to 20 mph from their high of 60 mph.
That allowed 13 planes and seven helicopters equipped with water tankers to
take to the sky for the first time.
The largest fire which began in Dayton Canyon, about 35 miles northwest
of Los Angeles, charred 52,000 acres and caused an estimated $20 million
damage in its sweep to the Pacific Ocean.
The blaze moved into Latigo Canyon and de
stroyed 60 homes in McEwan's neighborhood.
Blackened foundations dotted both sides of the
road where houses had been.
It also claimed at least 40 beachfront mobile
homes in Paradise Cove on the coast north of
Malibu.
With a firefighter inside with them, they
stamped out sparks that crept inside the house.
The Dayton Canyon fire was 80 percent con
tained yesterday and was "at a standstill" and not
spreading much, Los Angeles County Fire Depart
ment spokesman K.R. Trout said.
The other big fire burned 16,800 acres and de
stroyed 22 homes in Gypsum Canyon, 35 miles
southeast of Los Angeles.
Its advance was mostly stopped and was 90 per
cent contained yesterday, spokeswoman Sheri Ann
Erlewine said. She put damage at 516 million.
She said 530 residents were evacuated to three
high school gyms Saturday and were back home by
yesterday.
The other fires claimed more than 1000 acres, of
ficials said.
Solidarity protests dissolution
Warsaw — Underground Solidarity leaders
called yesterday for strikes and demonstrations
early next month to protest the outlawing of their
independent union, and Poland's Roman Catholic
primate and other priests told churchgoers that the
Solidarity ideals cannot die.
In Rome, meanwhile, Pope John Paul II told a
crowd of 150,000 in St. Peter's Square that the dis
solution of Solidarity "violates the basic rights of
man and society."
Speaking at the canonization ceremony for
Maximilian Kolbe, a Polish priest who sacrificed
his life to save another man in the Nazi's Aus
chwitz concentration camp, the pope asked "all
men of good will to pray for the Polish nation."
The call for new strikes was the first reaction
from underground Solidarity leaders since the
Polish Parliament on Friday enacted a trade union
law that dissolved Solidarity and all other unions
that existed here before martial law was declared
last December.
The strike call, distributed in leaflets signed by
four underground leaders, also urged Solidarity
members to boycott the new, factory-level trade
unions that are to be established under the new
union.
The leaflets echoed a letter smuggled out of War
saw's Bialoleka Prison in which nine interned Soli
darity leaders said that joining the new unions
"would imply sanctioning the outlawing of Soli
darity and constitute an ignoble act of collabora
tion."
The four underground unionists called for pro
tests on Nov. 10, the anniversary of the legal regis
tration of Solidarity as the Soviet Bloc's first inde
pendent trade union in a Warsaw court in 1980.
They called for a one-hour strike starting at noon
and said that Solidarity's future strategy would de
pend on the response.
The leaflets quoted a remark made by interned
Solidarity leader Lech Walesa at the union's na
tional congress a year ago: "Solidarity exists and
will exist, whether people like it or not."
Walesa, who has been held in near-total isola
tion since martial law was imposed, has been un
able to make his views known on the dissolution of
the union. His wife Danuta was refused per
mission to visit him last week, sources said.
The call for a boycott by both the internees and
the underground unionists is expected to ensure
that the new government-authorized factory level
unions will attract only minimal support. Polish
officials have said privately that they could func
tion with only 20 percent to 25 percent of the work
force as members, although that low a percentage
would damage the credibility of the new unions.
Baker downplays unemployment
Santa Barbara — White House Chief of Staff
James Baker predicted yesterday that last week's
announcement of rising double-digit unemploy

ment would not greatly affect the way Americans
vote Nov. 2.
He reasoned that much of the political impact
from the announcement already had been blunted
by the public's expectation of soaring unemploy
ment. The final figure for September wound up at
10.1 percent, the highest since 1940, the last year of
the Great Depression. A total of 11.3 million per
sons were reported out of work.
Another reason the potential sting was soothed,
Baker said, is that the 90 percent of those who hold
jobs "arc considerably better off then they were
two years ago," because of President Reagan.
"They've got far greater purchasing power because
of reduction in inflation and the cut in taxes," he
said.
Reagan's top advisers, including Baker, had
been worried for several days about the political
impact of Friday's unemployment announcement
— the last jobs report before the elections. The
president therefore began talking about unemploy
ment and defending his economic record in several
speeches leading up to the announcement.
"I don't think that the 10.1 percent unemploy
ment figure will be a dramatic event insofar as this
election is concerned. I do not think it will be a wa
tershed event," Baker said during an interview on
ABC-TV's "This Week With David Brinkley."
"This increase in unemployment was largely dis
counted in advance. Everyone has expected it."
The president's biggest political concern is the
potential loss of Republican seats in Congress. The
party in power traditionally has lost House seats
during the first off-year election after the president
assumes office, and recent estimates among White
House advisers about House seat losses have
focused on the mid-20s.
In another interview yesterday, on CBS-TV's
"Face the Nation," AFL-CIO President Lane
Kirkland said he hopes the elections will produce a
"clear message" from the voters that "we have got
to do something about this critical problem of un
employment." He said Reagan "promised us a
boom and brought us a bust."
"This administration has tested and tried and
had its way in trying out two erratic cultist theo
ries," Kirkland said. "Never before in history have
two crack brain theories like supply-side economics
and cultist monetarism had a more extensive trial
and been proved so wrong to the great harm of so
many people so quickly."
Meanwhile, former Vice President Walter Mon
dale, interviewed separately on the same show with
Baker, offered his solution for economic recovery:
reduce the federal budget deficit by cutting defense
spending by $10 billion and by eliminating, for per
sons earning more than 560,000 a year the third
year of a tax cut scheduled for next July 1. Mondale
said he also would forbid hospital costs to rise
faster than inflation and would urge the Federal
Reserve Board to loosen the nation's money supp
ly over a long period.
Israel insists PLO leave first
Jerasulem — The Israeli Cabinet yesterday out
lined a six-point plan for the withdrawal of foreign
forces from Lebanon, including its own, and of
ficially insisted that Palestine Liberation Organiza
tion units leave first.
The position announced by the cabinet, which
met for four hours under Prime Minister Men
achem Begin, ended several days of confusion on
whether Israel would demand an initial PLO with
drawal. Twice last week senior Israeli officials gave
differeing views.
Yesterday's formal statement that a PLO with
drawal must precede a Syrian-Israeli pullout will
make American mediation efforts more difficult.
Israeli officials have insisted that the Syrians can
control the PLO units and force their withdrawal.
But the Syrians have said that the PLO is an inde
pendent organization and that the mediators will
have to deal directly with the Palestinians.
Israeli forces have been in Lebanon since the
June 6 invasion and forced the evacuation of the
PLO leadership and guerrillas from Beirut in Au
gust. But thousands of PLO guerrillas remain be
hind Syrian lines in Lebanon's Bekaa Valley and
around the northern Lebanese city of Tripoli. The

Syrians have had a large army in Lebanon since the
1975-76 civil war.
In other points, the Cabinet statement said the
Israeli government wanted Syrian and Israeli
forces to leave simultaneously, that security ar
rangements must be made to keep Lebanon from
becoming a base for military action against Israel
again and that Syria and the PLO must return Is
raeli prisoners and the bodies of Isreli dead before
a withdrawal can begin.
The statement said that Israel would continue to
seek a peace treaty with the Lebanese government,
but cabinet spokesman Dan Meridor said a treaty
was not a requirement for withdrawal.
Bolivia inaugurates populist
La Paz, Bolivia — Bolivia launched a new effort
at democratic government yesterday as veteran
populist leader Hernan Siles Zuazo was in
augurated president, marking the beginning nf the
first popularly elected government here in 18 years.
In a three-hour ceremony at the National Con
gress yesterday afternoon, Siles accepted the presi
dency he had almost won in a 1980 election and
vowed to build a "broad-based and fertile" de
mocracy that would end the cycle of coups that
have repeatedly prevented democratic government
in this poor, land-locked Andean nation.
The presidents of Peru, Ecuador and Colombia
and a host of foreign delegations attended the in
auguration, which made Bolivia the third South
American country to return to democratic govern
ment in the last three years after a period of mili
tary domination in the 19705.
In his inauguration speech, Siles declared that
"we have much to detain us in the analysis of past
pains and guilt. What is important is that we de
feated the dictatorship."
He added, "We are extending the frontiers of de
mocracy toward the south in an uncontainable ad
vance."
The new president was greeted with cheers in the
cramped, marble Congress chambers and in the
plaza outside, where many supporters waited
through a rainstorm holding banners or wrapped
in traditional rainbow-striped alpaca ponchos.
As the country approached democracy, tens of
thousands of students, miners and party militants
spent the past week happily parading through the
mountain-encircled capital and unfurling flags and
banners from its small cluster of skyscrapers.
Brewers, Cards reach Series
The Milwaukee Brewers capped baseball's
greatest, playoff turnaround while the St. Louis
Cardinals completed a three-game sweep over the
Atlanta Braves yesterday. Both teams advanced to
the World Series, which begins tomorrow.
Spurred by Cecil Cooper's clutch hit and the
hustle of Paul Molitor, the Brewers staged a come
from-behind, 4-3 victory over the California
Angels in the fifth and final game of the American
League Championship Series.
In Atlanta, rookie Willie McGee drilled a two
run triple and a home run as St. Louis charged into
the 1982 World Series with a 6-2 decision over the
Braves, clinching their 13th National League pen
nant.
The Brewers' victory earned them their first-ever
World Series berth. It also was the first time in the
13 years of league championship play that a team
has been able to win a best-of-five series after an
0-2 deficit.
Atlanta's triumph, with the help of another
door-shutting relief job by Bruce Sutter, put them
in the World Series for the first time since 1968.
Winning pitcher Joaquin Andujar, the National
League's pitcher of the month in September, throt
tled the Braves on just two hits over the first six in
nings. But he tired in the seventh, surrendering
both Braves runs on four hits before Sutter, who
led the league with 36 saves, came on to nail down
the victory and the pennant for the Cardinals.

Israel insists PLO leave first
Jerasulem — The Israeli Cabinet yesterday out
lined a six-point plan for the withdrawal of foreign
forces from Lebanon, including its own, and of
ficially insisted that Palestine Liberation Organiza
tion units leave first.
The position announced by the cabinet, which
met for four hours under Prime Minister Men
achem Begin, ended several days of confusion on
whether Israel would demand an initial PLO with
drawal. Twice last week senior Israeli officials gave
differeing views.
Yesterday's formal statement that a PLO with
drawal must precede a Syrian-Israeli pullout will
make American mediation efforts more difficult.
Israeli officials have insisted that the Syrians can
control the PLO units and force their withdrawal.
But the Syrians have said that the PLO is an inde
pendent organization and that the mediators will
have to deal directly with the Palestinians.
Israeli forces have been in Lebanon since the
June 6 invasion and forced the evacuation of the
PLO leadership and guerrillas from Beirut in Au
gust. But thousands of PLO guerrillas remain be
hind Syrian lines in Lebanon's Bekaa Valley and
around the northern Lebanese city of Tripoli. The

Syrians have had a large army in Lebanon since the
1975-76 civil war.
In other points, the Cabinet statement said the
Israeli government wanted Syrian and Israeli
forces to leave simultaneously, that security ar
rangements must be made to keep Lebanon from
becoming a base for military action against Israel
again and that Syria and the PLO must return Is
raeli prisoners and the bodies of Isreli dead before
a withdrawal can begin.
The statement said that Israel would continue to
seek a peace treaty with the Lebanese government,
but cabinet spokesman Dan Meridor said a treaty
was not a requirement for withdrawal.
Bolivia inaugurates populist
La Paz, Bolivia — Bolivia launched a new effort
at democratic government yesterday as veteran
populist leader Hernan Siles Zuazo was in
augurated president, marking the beginning nf the
first popularly elected government here in 18 years.
In a three-hour ceremony at the National Con
gress yesterday afternoon, Siles accepted the presi
dency he had almost won in a 1980 election and
vowed to build a "broad-based and fertile" de
mocracy that would end the cycle of coups that
have repeatedly prevented democratic government
in this poor, land-locked Andean nation.
The presidents of Peru, Ecuador and Colombia
and a host of foreign delegations attended the in
auguration, which made Bolivia the third South
American country to return to democratic govern
ment in the last three years after a period of mili
tary domination in the 19705.
In his inauguration speech, Siles declared that
"we have much to detain us in the analysis of past
pains and guilt. What is important is that we de
feated the dictatorship."
He added, "We are extending the frontiers of de
mocracy toward the south in an uncontainable ad
vance."
The new president was greeted with cheers in the
cramped, marble Congress chambers and in the
plaza outside, where many supporters waited
through a rainstorm holding banners or wrapped
in traditional rainbow-striped alpaca ponchos.
As the country approached democracy, tens of
thousands of students, miners and party militants
spent the past week happily parading through the
mountain-encircled capital and unfurling flags and
banners from its small cluster of skyscrapers.
Brewers, Cards reach Series
The Milwaukee Brewers capped baseball's
greatest, playoff turnaround while the St. Louis
Cardinals completed a three-game sweep over the
Atlanta Braves yesterday. Both teams advanced to
the World Series, which begins tomorrow.
Spurred by Cecil Cooper's clutch hit and the
hustle of Paul Molitor, the Brewers staged a come
from-behind, 4-3 victory over the California
Angels in the fifth and final game of the American
League Championship Series.
In Atlanta, rookie Willie McGee drilled a two
run triple and a home run as St. Louis charged into
the 1982 World Series with a 6-2 decision over the
Braves, clinching their 13th National League pen
nant.
The Brewers' victory earned them their first-ever
World Series berth. It also was the first time in the
13 years of league championship play that a team
has been able to win a best-of-five series after an
0-2 deficit.
Atlanta's triumph, with the help of another
door-shutting relief job by Bruce Sutter, put them
in the World Series for the first time since 1968.
Winning pitcher Joaquin Andujar, the National

both Braves runs on four hits before Sutter, who

Brush fires sweep Southern California
Los Angeles — Brush fires fanned by hot, dry Santa Ana winds rushed
from ridge to ridge across Southern California during the weekend, injuring
147 people and destroying 122 homes before dying down yesterday, accord
ing to officials who blamed arson in at least four of the cases.
Thousands of people fled choking smoke and red ash blown by screaming,
gale-force winds. Property damage was put at $36 million.
At least four of the seven fires were set and a fifth — the largest — was of
suspicious origin, authorities said.
The fires crackled through more than 74,000 acres of brush-covered hills
and tinder-dry valleys in five counties and sent blankets of smoke and soot
across the sky all weekend.
At least a half-dozen firefighters were among the injured. Several horses
were killed by motorists racing from fires, officials said.
Firefighters, battling the blazes on the ground 1000 strong, got a break
yesterday when the winds dropped off to 20 mph from their high of 60 mph.
That allowed 13 planes and seven helicopters equipped with water tankers to
take to the sky for the first time.
The largest fire which began in Dayton Canyon, about 35 miles northwest
of Los Angeles, charred 52,000 acres and caused an estimated $20 million
damage in its sweep to the Pacific Ocean.
The blaze moved into Latigo Canyon and de
stroyed 60 homes in McEwan's neighborhood.
Blackened foundations dotted both sides of the
road where houses had been.
It also claimed at least 40 beachfront mobile
homes in Paradise Cove on the coast north of
Malibu.
With a firefighter inside with them, they
stamped out sparks that crept inside the house.
The Dayton Canyon fire was 80 percent con
tained yesterday and was "at a standstill" and not
spreading much, Los Angeles County Fire Depart
ment spokesman K.R. Trout said.
The other big fire burned 16,800 acres and de
stroyed 22 homes in Gypsum Canyon, 35 miles
southeast of Los Angeles.
Its advance was mostly stopped and was 90 per
cent contained yesterday, spokeswoman Sheri Ann
Erlewine said. She put damage at 516 million.
She said 530 residents were evacuated to three
high school gyms Saturday and were back home by
yesterday.
The other fires claimed more than 1000 acres, of
ficials said.
Solidarity protests dissolution
Warsaw — Underground Solidarity leaders
called yesterday for strikes and demonstrations
early next month to protest the outlawing of their
independent union, and Poland's Roman Catholic
primate and other priests told churchgoers that the
Solidarity ideals cannot die.
In Rome, meanwhile, Pope John Paul II told a
crowd of 150,000 in St. Peter's Square that the dis
solution of Solidarity "violates the basic rights of
man and society."
Speaking at the canonization ceremony for
Maximilian Kolbe, a Polish priest who sacrificed
his life to save another man in the Nazi's Aus
chwitz concentration camp, the pope asked "all
men of good will to pray for the Polish nation."
The call for new strikes was the first reaction
from underground Solidarity leaders since the
Polish Parliament on Friday enacted a trade union
law that dissolved Solidarity and all other unions
that existed here before martial law was declared
last December.
The strike call, distributed in leaflets signed by
four underground leaders, also urged Solidarity
members to boycott the new, factory-level trade
unions that are to be established under the new
union.
The leaflets echoed a letter smuggled out of War
saw's Bialoleka Prison in which nine interned Soli
darity leaders said that joining the new unions
"would imply sanctioning the outlawing of Soli
darity and constitute an ignoble act of collabora
tion."
The four underground unionists called for pro
tests on Nov. 10, the anniversary of the legal regis
tration of Solidarity as the Soviet Bloc's first inde
pendent trade union in a Warsaw court in 1980.
They called for a one-hour strike starting at noon
and said that Solidarity's future strategy would de
pend on the response.
The leaflets quoted a remark made by interned
Solidarity leader Lech Walesa at the union's na
tional congress a year ago: "Solidarity exists and
will exist, whether people like it or not."
Walesa, who has been held in near-total isola
tion since martial law was imposed, has been un
able to make his views known on the dissolution of
the union. His wife Danuta was refused per
mission to visit him last week, sources said.
The call for a boycott by both the internees and
the underground unionists is expected to ensure
that the new government-authorized factory level
unions will attract only minimal support. Polish
officials have said privately that they could func
tion with only 20 percent to 25 percent of the work
force as members, although that low a percentage
would damage the credibility of the new unions.
Baker downplays unemployment
Santa Barbara — White House Chief of Staff
James Baker predicted yesterday that last week's
announcement of rising double-digit unemploy

ment would not greatly affect the way Americans
vote Nov. 2.
He reasoned that much of the political impact
from the announcement already had been blunted
by the public's expectation of soaring unemploy
ment. The final figure for September wound up at
10.1 percent, the highest since 1940, the last year of
the Great Depression. A total of 11.3 million per
sons were reported out of work.
Another reason the potential sting was soothed,
Baker said, is that the 90 percent of those who hold
jobs "arc considerably better off then they were
two years ago," because of President Reagan.
"They've got far greater purchasing power because
of reduction in inflation and the cut in taxes," he
said.
Reagan's top advisers, including Baker, had
been worried for several days about the political
impact of Friday's unemployment announcement
— the last jobs report before the elections. The
president therefore began talking about unemploy
ment and defending his economic record in several
speeches leading up to the announcement.
"I don't think that the 10.1 percent unemploy
ment figure will be a dramatic event insofar as this
election is concerned. I do not think it will be a wa
tershed event," Baker said during an interview on
ABC-TV's "This Week With David Brinkley."
"This increase in unemployment was largely dis
counted in advance. Everyone has expected it."
The president's biggest political concern is the
potential loss of Republican seats in Congress. The
party in power traditionally has lost House seats
during the first off-year election after the president
assumes office, and recent estimates among White
House advisers about House seat losses have
focused on the mid-20s.
In another interview yesterday, on CBS-TV's
"Face the Nation," AFL-CIO President Lane
Kirkland said he hopes the elections will produce a
"clear message" from the voters that "we have got
to do something about this critical problem of un
employment." He said Reagan "promised us a
boom and brought us a bust."
"This administration has tested and tried and
had its way in trying out two erratic cultist theo
ries," Kirkland said. "Never before in history have
two crack brain theories like supply-side economics
and cultist monetarism had a more extensive trial
and been proved so wrong to the great harm of so
many people so quickly."
Meanwhile, former Vice President Walter Mon
dale, interviewed separately on the same show with
Baker, offered his solution for economic recovery:
reduce the federal budget deficit by cutting defense
spending by $10 billion and by eliminating, for per
sons earning more than 560,000 a year the third
year of a tax cut scheduled for next July 1. Mondale
said he also would forbid hospital costs to rise
faster than inflation and would urge the Federal

At least a half-dozen firefighters were among the injured. Several horses
were killed by motorists racing from fires, officials said.
Firefighters, battling the blazes on the ground 1000 strong, got a break
yesterday when the winds dropped off to 20 mph from their high of 60 mph.
That allowed 13 planes and seven helicopters equipped with water tankers to
take to the sky for the first time.
The largest fire which began in Dayton Canyon, about 35 miles northwest
of Los Angeles, charred 52,000 acres and caused an estimated $20 million
damage in its sweep to the Pacific Ocean.
The blaze moved into Latigo Canyon and de
stroyed 60 homes in McEwan's neighborhood.
Blackened foundations dotted both sides of the
road where houses had been.
It also claimed at least 40 beachfront mobile
homes in Paradise Cove on the coast north of
Malibu.
With a firefighter inside with them, they
stamped out sparks that crept inside the house.
The Dayton Canyon fire was 80 percent con
tained yesterday and was "at a standstill" and not
spreading much, Los Angeles County Fire Depart
ment spokesman K.R. Trout said.
The other big fire burned 16,800 acres and de
stroyed 22 homes in Gypsum Canyon, 35 miles
southeast of Los Angeles.
Its advance was mostly stopped and was 90 per
cent contained yesterday, spokeswoman Sheri Ann
Erlewine said. She put damage at 516 million.
She said 530 residents were evacuated to three
high school gyms Saturday and were back home by
yesterday.
The other fires claimed more than 1000 acres, of
ficials said.
Solidarity protests dissolution
Warsaw — Underground Solidarity leaders
called yesterday for strikes and demonstrations
early next month to protest the outlawing of their
independent union, and Poland's Roman Catholic
primate and other priests told churchgoers that the
Solidarity ideals cannot die.
In Rome, meanwhile, Pope John Paul II told a
crowd of 150,000 in St. Peter's Square that the dis
solution of Solidarity "violates the basic rights of
man and society."
Speaking at the canonization ceremony for
Maximilian Kolbe, a Polish priest who sacrificed
his life to save another man in the Nazi's Aus
chwitz concentration camp, the pope asked "all
men of good will to pray for the Polish nation."
The call for new strikes was the first reaction
from underground Solidarity leaders since the
Polish Parliament on Friday enacted a trade union
law that dissolved Solidarity and all other unions
that existed here before martial law was declared
last December.
The strike call, distributed in leaflets signed by
four underground leaders, also urged Solidarity
members to boycott the new, factory-level trade
unions that are to be established under the new
union.
The leaflets echoed a letter smuggled out of War
saw's Bialoleka Prison in which nine interned Soli
darity leaders said that joining the new unions
"would imply sanctioning the outlawing of Soli
darity and constitute an ignoble act of collabora
tion."
The four underground unionists called for pro
tests on Nov. 10, the anniversary of the legal regis
tration of Solidarity as the Soviet Bloc's first inde
pendent trade union in a Warsaw court in 1980.
They called for a one-hour strike starting at noon
and said that Solidarity's future strategy would de
pend on the response.
The leaflets quoted a remark made by interned
Solidarity leader Lech Walesa at the union's na
tional congress a year ago: "Solidarity exists and
will exist, whether people like it or not."
Walesa, who has been held in near-total isola
tion since martial law was imposed, has been un
able to make his views known on the dissolution of
the union. His wife Danuta was refused per
mission to visit him last week, sources said.
The call for a boycott by both the internees and
the underground unionists is expected to ensure
that the new government-authorized factory level
unions will attract only minimal support. Polish
officials have said privately that they could func
tion with only 20 percent to 25 percent of the work
force as members, although that low a percentage
would damage the credibility of the new unions.
Baker downplays unemployment
Santa Barbara — White House Chief of Staff
James Baker predicted yesterday that last week's
announcement of rising double-digit unemploy

ment would not greatly affect the way Americans
vote Nov. 2.
He reasoned that much of the political impact
from the announcement already had been blunted
by the public's expectation of soaring unemploy
ment. The final figure for September wound up at
10.1 percent, the highest since 1940, the last year of
the Great Depression. A total of 11.3 million per
sons were reported out of work.
Another reason the potential sting was soothed,
Baker said, is that the 90 percent of those who hold
jobs "arc considerably better off then they were
two years ago," because of President Reagan.
"They've got far greater purchasing power because
of reduction in inflation and the cut in taxes," he
said.
Reagan's top advisers, including Baker, had
been worried for several days about the political
impact of Friday's unemployment announcement
— the last jobs report before the elections. The
president therefore began talking about unemploy
ment and defending his economic record in several
speeches leading up to the announcement.
"I don't think that the 10.1 percent unemploy
ment figure will be a dramatic event insofar as this
election is concerned. I do not think it will be a wa
tershed event," Baker said during an interview on
ABC-TV's "This Week With David Brinkley."
"This increase in unemployment was largely dis
counted in advance. Everyone has expected it."
The president's biggest political concern is the
potential loss of Republican seats in Congress. The
party in power traditionally has lost House seats
during the first off-year election after the president
assumes office, and recent estimates among White
House advisers about House seat losses have
focused on the mid-20s.
In another interview yesterday, on CBS-TV's
"Face the Nation," AFL-CIO President Lane
Kirkland said he hopes the elections will produce a
"clear message" from the voters that "we have got
to do something about this critical problem of un
employment." He said Reagan "promised us a
boom and brought us a bust."
"This administration has tested and tried and
had its way in trying out two erratic cultist theo
ries," Kirkland said. "Never before in history have
two crack brain theories like supply-side economics
and cultist monetarism had a more extensive trial
and been proved so wrong to the great harm of so
many people so quickly."
Meanwhile, former Vice President Walter Mon
dale, interviewed separately on the same show with
Baker, offered his solution for economic recovery:
reduce the federal budget deficit by cutting defense
spending by $10 billion and by eliminating, for per
sons earning more than 560,000 a year the third
year of a tax cut scheduled for next July 1. Mondale
said he also would forbid hospital costs to rise
faster than inflation and would urge the Federal
Reserve Board to loosen the nation's money supp
ly over a long period.
Israel insists PLO leave first
Jerasulem — The Israeli Cabinet yesterday out
lined a six-point plan for the withdrawal of foreign
forces from Lebanon, including its own, and of
ficially insisted that Palestine Liberation Organiza
tion units leave first.
The position announced by the cabinet, which
met for four hours under Prime Minister Men
achem Begin, ended several days of confusion on
whether Israel would demand an initial PLO with
drawal. Twice last week senior Israeli officials gave
differeing views.
Yesterday's formal statement that a PLO with
drawal must precede a Syrian-Israeli pullout will
make American mediation efforts more difficult.
Israeli officials have insisted that the Syrians can
control the PLO units and force their withdrawal.
But the Syrians have said that the PLO is an inde
pendent organization and that the mediators will
have to deal directly with the Palestinians.
Israeli forces have been in Lebanon since the
June 6 invasion and forced the evacuation of the
PLO leadership and guerrillas from Beirut in Au
gust. But thousands of PLO guerrillas remain be
hind Syrian lines in Lebanon's Bekaa Valley and
around the northern Lebanese city of Tripoli. The

Syrians have had a large army in Lebanon since the
1975-76 civil war.
In other points, the Cabinet statement said the
Israeli government wanted Syrian and Israeli
forces to leave simultaneously, that security ar
rangements must be made to keep Lebanon from
becoming a base for military action against Israel
again and that Syria and the PLO must return Is
raeli prisoners and the bodies of Isreli dead before
a withdrawal can begin.
The statement said that Israel would continue to
seek a peace treaty with the Lebanese government,
but cabinet spokesman Dan Meridor said a treaty
was not a requirement for withdrawal.
Bolivia inaugurates populist
La Paz, Bolivia — Bolivia launched a new effort
at democratic government yesterday as veteran
populist leader Hernan Siles Zuazo was in
augurated president, marking the beginning nf the
first popularly elected government here in 18 years.
In a three-hour ceremony at the National Con
gress yesterday afternoon, Siles accepted the presi
dency he had almost won in a 1980 election and
vowed to build a "broad-based and fertile" de
mocracy that would end the cycle of coups that
have repeatedly prevented democratic government
in this poor, land-locked Andean nation.
The presidents of Peru, Ecuador and Colombia
and a host of foreign delegations attended the in
auguration, which made Bolivia the third South
American country to return to democratic govern
ment in the last three years after a period of mili
tary domination in the 19705.
In his inauguration speech, Siles declared that
"we have much to detain us in the analysis of past
pains and guilt. What is important is that we de
feated the dictatorship."
He added, "We are extending the frontiers of de
mocracy toward the south in an uncontainable ad
vance."
The new president was greeted with cheers in the
cramped, marble Congress chambers and in the
plaza outside, where many supporters waited
through a rainstorm holding banners or wrapped
in traditional rainbow-striped alpaca ponchos.
As the country approached democracy, tens of
thousands of students, miners and party militants
spent the past week happily parading through the
mountain-encircled capital and unfurling flags and
banners from its small cluster of skyscrapers.
Brewers, Cards reach Series
The Milwaukee Brewers capped baseball's
greatest, playoff turnaround while the St. Louis
Cardinals completed a three-game sweep over the
Atlanta Braves yesterday. Both teams advanced to
the World Series, which begins tomorrow.
Spurred by Cecil Cooper's clutch hit and the
hustle of Paul Molitor, the Brewers staged a come
from-behind, 4-3 victory over the California
Angels in the fifth and final game of the American
League Championship Series.
In Atlanta, rookie Willie McGee drilled a two
run triple and a home run as St. Louis charged into
the 1982 World Series with a 6-2 decision over the
Braves, clinching their 13th National League pen
nant.
The Brewers' victory earned them their first-ever
World Series berth. It also was the first time in the
13 years of league championship play that a team
has been able to win a best-of-five series after an
0-2 deficit.
Atlanta's triumph, with the help of another
door-shutting relief job by Bruce Sutter, put them
in the World Series for the first time since 1968.
Winning pitcher Joaquin Andujar, the National
League's pitcher of the month in September, throt
tled the Braves on just two hits over the first six in
nings. But he tired in the seventh, surrendering
both Braves runs on four hits before Sutter, who
led the league with 36 saves, came on to nail down
the victory and the pennant for the Cardinals.

Brush fires sweep Southern California
Los Angeles — Brush fires fanned by hot, dry Santa Ana winds rushed
from ridge to ridge across Southern California during the weekend, injuring
147 people and destroying 122 homes before dying down yesterday, accord
ing to officials who blamed arson in at least four of the cases.
Thousands of people fled choking smoke and red ash blown by screaming,
gale-force winds. Property damage was put at $36 million.
At least four of the seven fires were set and a fifth — the largest — was of
suspicious origin, authorities said.
The fires crackled through more than 74,000 acres of brush-covered hills
and tinder-dry valleys in five counties and sent blankets of smoke and soot
across the sky all weekend.
At least a half-dozen firefighters were among the injured. Several horses
were killed by motorists racing from fires, officials said.
Firefighters, battling the blazes on the ground 1000 strong, got a break
yesterday when the winds dropped off to 20 mph from their high of 60 mph.
That allowed 13 planes and seven helicopters equipped with water tankers to
take to the sky for the first time.

reduce the federal budget deficit by cutting defense
spending by $10 billion and by eliminating, for per
sons earning more than 560,000 a year the third
year of a tax cut scheduled for next July 1. Mondale
said he also would forbid hospital costs to rise
faster than inflation and would urge the Federal
Reserve Board to loosen the nation's money supp
ly over a long period.
Israel insists PLO leave first
Jerasulem — The Israeli Cabinet yesterday out
lined a six-point plan for the withdrawal of foreign
forces from Lebanon, including its own, and of
ficially insisted that Palestine Liberation Organiza
tion units leave first.
The position announced by the cabinet, which
met for four hours under Prime Minister Men
achem Begin, ended several days of confusion on
whether Israel would demand an initial PLO with
drawal. Twice last week senior Israeli officials gave
differeing views.
Yesterday's formal statement that a PLO with
drawal must precede a Syrian-Israeli pullout will
make American mediation efforts more difficult.
Israeli officials have insisted that the Syrians can
control the PLO units and force their withdrawal.
But the Syrians have said that the PLO is an inde
pendent organization and that the mediators will
have to deal directly with the Palestinians.
Israeli forces have been in Lebanon since the
June 6 invasion and forced the evacuation of the
PLO leadership and guerrillas from Beirut in Au
gust. But thousands of PLO guerrillas remain be
hind Syrian lines in Lebanon's Bekaa Valley and
around the northern Lebanese city of Tripoli. The

Syrians have had a large army in Lebanon since the
1975-76 civil war.
In other points, the Cabinet statement said the
Israeli government wanted Syrian and Israeli
forces to leave simultaneously, that security ar
rangements must be made to keep Lebanon from
becoming a base for military action against Israel
again and that Syria and the PLO must return Is
raeli prisoners and the bodies of Isreli dead before
a withdrawal can begin.
The statement said that Israel would continue to
seek a peace treaty with the Lebanese government,
but cabinet spokesman Dan Meridor said a treaty
was not a requirement for withdrawal.
Bolivia inaugurates populist
La Paz, Bolivia — Bolivia launched a new effort
at democratic government yesterday as veteran
populist leader Hernan Siles Zuazo was in
augurated president, marking the beginning nf the
first popularly elected government here in 18 years.
In a three-hour ceremony at the National Con
gress yesterday afternoon, Siles accepted the presi
dency he had almost won in a 1980 election and
vowed to build a "broad-based and fertile" de
mocracy that would end the cycle of coups that
have repeatedly prevented democratic government
in this poor, land-locked Andean nation.
The presidents of Peru, Ecuador and Colombia
and a host of foreign delegations attended the in
auguration, which made Bolivia the third South
American country to return to democratic govern
ment in the last three years after a period of mili
tary domination in the 19705.
In his inauguration speech, Siles declared that
"we have much to detain us in the analysis of past
pains and guilt. What is important is that we de
feated the dictatorship."
He added, "We are extending the frontiers of de
mocracy toward the south in an uncontainable ad
vance."
The new president was greeted with cheers in the
cramped, marble Congress chambers and in the
plaza outside, where many supporters waited
through a rainstorm holding banners or wrapped
in traditional rainbow-striped alpaca ponchos.
As the country approached democracy, tens of
thousands of students, miners and party militants
spent the past week happily parading through the
mountain-encircled capital and unfurling flags and
banners from its small cluster of skyscrapers.
Brewers, Cards reach Series
The Milwaukee Brewers capped baseball's
greatest, playoff turnaround while the St. Louis
Cardinals completed a three-game sweep over the
Atlanta Braves yesterday. Both teams advanced to
the World Series, which begins tomorrow.
Spurred by Cecil Cooper's clutch hit and the
hustle of Paul Molitor, the Brewers staged a come
from-behind, 4-3 victory over the California
Angels in the fifth and final game of the American
League Championship Series.
In Atlanta, rookie Willie McGee drilled a two
run triple and a home run as St. Louis charged into
the 1982 World Series with a 6-2 decision over the
Braves, clinching their 13th National League pen
nant.
The Brewers' victory earned them their first-ever
World Series berth. It also was the first time in the
13 years of league championship play that a team
has been able to win a best-of-five series after an
0-2 deficit.
Atlanta's triumph, with the help of another
door-shutting relief job by Bruce Sutter, put them
in the World Series for the first time since 1968.
Winning pitcher Joaquin Andujar, the National
League's pitcher of the month in September, throt
tled the Braves on just two hits over the first six in
nings. But he tired in the seventh, surrendering
both Braves runs on four hits before Sutter, who
led the league with 36 saves, came on to nail down
the victory and the pennant for the Cardinals.

Brush fires sweep Southern California
Los Angeles — Brush fires fanned by hot, dry Santa Ana winds rushed
from ridge to ridge across Southern California during the weekend, injuring
147 people and destroying 122 homes before dying down yesterday, accord
ing to officials who blamed arson in at least four of the cases.
Thousands of people fled choking smoke and red ash blown by screaming,
gale-force winds. Property damage was put at $36 million.
At least four of the seven fires were set and a fifth — the largest — was of
suspicious origin, authorities said.
The fires crackled through more than 74,000 acres of brush-covered hills
and tinder-dry valleys in five counties and sent blankets of smoke and soot
across the sky all weekend.
At least a half-dozen firefighters were among the injured. Several horses
were killed by motorists racing from fires, officials said.
Firefighters, battling the blazes on the ground 1000 strong, got a break
yesterday when the winds dropped off to 20 mph from their high of 60 mph.
That allowed 13 planes and seven helicopters equipped with water tankers to
take to the sky for the first time.
The largest fire which began in Dayton Canyon, about 35 miles northwest
of Los Angeles, charred 52,000 acres and caused an estimated $20 million
damage in its sweep to the Pacific Ocean.
The blaze moved into Latigo Canyon and de
stroyed 60 homes in McEwan's neighborhood.
Blackened foundations dotted both sides of the
road where houses had been.
It also claimed at least 40 beachfront mobile
homes in Paradise Cove on the coast north of
Malibu.
With a firefighter inside with them, they
stamped out sparks that crept inside the house.
The Dayton Canyon fire was 80 percent con
tained yesterday and was "at a standstill" and not
spreading much, Los Angeles County Fire Depart
ment spokesman K.R. Trout said.
The other big fire burned 16,800 acres and de
stroyed 22 homes in Gypsum Canyon, 35 miles
southeast of Los Angeles.
Its advance was mostly stopped and was 90 per
cent contained yesterday, spokeswoman Sheri Ann
Erlewine said. She put damage at 516 million.
She said 530 residents were evacuated to three
high school gyms Saturday and were back home by
yesterday.
The other fires claimed more than 1000 acres, of
ficials said.
Solidarity protests dissolution
Warsaw — Underground Solidarity leaders
called yesterday for strikes and demonstrations
early next month to protest the outlawing of their
independent union, and Poland's Roman Catholic
primate and other priests told churchgoers that the
Solidarity ideals cannot die.
In Rome, meanwhile, Pope John Paul II told a
crowd of 150,000 in St. Peter's Square that the dis
solution of Solidarity "violates the basic rights of
man and society."
Speaking at the canonization ceremony for
Maximilian Kolbe, a Polish priest who sacrificed
his life to save another man in the Nazi's Aus
chwitz concentration camp, the pope asked "all
men of good will to pray for the Polish nation."
The call for new strikes was the first reaction
from underground Solidarity leaders since the
Polish Parliament on Friday enacted a trade union
law that dissolved Solidarity and all other unions
that existed here before martial law was declared
last December.
The strike call, distributed in leaflets signed by
four underground leaders, also urged Solidarity
members to boycott the new, factory-level trade
unions that are to be established under the new
union.
The leaflets echoed a letter smuggled out of War
saw's Bialoleka Prison in which nine interned Soli
darity leaders said that joining the new unions
"would imply sanctioning the outlawing of Soli
darity and constitute an ignoble act of collabora
tion."
The four underground unionists called for pro
tests on Nov. 10, the anniversary of the legal regis
tration of Solidarity as the Soviet Bloc's first inde
pendent trade union in a Warsaw court in 1980.
They called for a one-hour strike starting at noon
and said that Solidarity's future strategy would de
pend on the response.
The leaflets quoted a remark made by interned
Solidarity leader Lech Walesa at the union's na
tional congress a year ago: "Solidarity exists and
will exist, whether people like it or not."
Walesa, who has been held in near-total isola
tion since martial law was imposed, has been un
able to make his views known on the dissolution of
the union. His wife Danuta was refused per
mission to visit him last week, sources said.
The call for a boycott by both the internees and
the underground unionists is expected to ensure
that the new government-authorized factory level
unions will attract only minimal support. Polish
officials have said privately that they could func
tion with only 20 percent to 25 percent of the work
force as members, although that low a percentage
would damage the credibility of the new unions.
Baker downplays unemployment
Santa Barbara — White House Chief of Staff
James Baker predicted yesterday that last week's
announcement of rising double-digit unemploy

ment would not greatly affect the way Americans
vote Nov. 2.
He reasoned that much of the political impact
from the announcement already had been blunted
by the public's expectation of soaring unemploy
ment. The final figure for September wound up at
10.1 percent, the highest since 1940, the last year of
the Great Depression. A total of 11.3 million per
sons were reported out of work.
Another reason the potential sting was soothed,
Baker said, is that the 90 percent of those who hold
jobs "arc considerably better off then they were
two years ago," because of President Reagan.
"They've got far greater purchasing power because
of reduction in inflation and the cut in taxes," he
said.
Reagan's top advisers, including Baker, had
been worried for several days about the political
impact of Friday's unemployment announcement
— the last jobs report before the elections. The
president therefore began talking about unemploy
ment and defending his economic record in several
speeches leading up to the announcement.
"I don't think that the 10.1 percent unemploy
ment figure will be a dramatic event insofar as this
election is concerned. I do not think it will be a wa
tershed event," Baker said during an interview on
ABC-TV's "This Week With David Brinkley."
"This increase in unemployment was largely dis
counted in advance. Everyone has expected it."
The president's biggest political concern is the
potential loss of Republican seats in Congress. The
party in power traditionally has lost House seats
during the first off-year election after the president
assumes office, and recent estimates among White
House advisers about House seat losses have
focused on the mid-20s.
In another interview yesterday, on CBS-TV's
"Face the Nation," AFL-CIO President Lane
Kirkland said he hopes the elections will produce a
"clear message" from the voters that "we have got
to do something about this critical problem of un
employment." He said Reagan "promised us a
boom and brought us a bust."
"This administration has tested and tried and
had its way in trying out two erratic cultist theo
ries," Kirkland said. "Never before in history have
two crack brain theories like supply-side economics
and cultist monetarism had a more extensive trial
and been proved so wrong to the great harm of so
many people so quickly."
Meanwhile, former Vice President Walter Mon
dale, interviewed separately on the same show with
Baker, offered his solution for economic recovery:
reduce the federal budget deficit by cutting defense
spending by $10 billion and by eliminating, for per
sons earning more than 560,000 a year the third
year of a tax cut scheduled for next July 1. Mondale
said he also would forbid hospital costs to rise
faster than inflation and would urge the Federal
Reserve Board to loosen the nation's money supp
ly over a long period.
