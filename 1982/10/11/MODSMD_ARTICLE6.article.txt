# Lantos, Royer clash over economic policy
## 
### BILL AINSWORTH 
Although Rep. Tom Lantos (D-San
Mateo) and Republican challenger Bill
Rover agreed in a debate last Friday
night that the ailing economy is the
most important issue in the upcoming
election, they differed sharply regard
ing the path to economic recovery.
Lantos blamed the Reagan adminis
tration for the highest unemployment
rates in the United States since 1941
(figures released last week put the na
tional rate at more than 10 percent). He
also criticized the current adminis
tration for increased spending which he
said it caused by "forcing people on
welfare and food stamps."
In contrast, Royer credited the Rea
gan administration for reducing the
rate of inflation from 12 percent in 1980
to about 5 percent for the first eight
months of! 982.
He added that interest rates are "the

big issue now." To lower interest rates,
Rover advocated further spending cuts
in all areas of the federal government,
including defense.
According to Royer, the key to eco
nomic productivity is to allow the free
enterprise system to remain productive
by providing personal incentives, such
as the tax reductions and tax credits al
ready enacted by the Reagan adminis
tration.
Lantos, however, claimed that the
tax program sponsored by Reagan gave
"the most unconscionable tax breaks to
multi-national corporations."
Lantos agreed that federal spending
"has to be brought under control" and
cited his record of voting against in
creased defense expenditures — such as
the B-l Bomber, the MX missile and
chemical weapons — as evidence of his
determination to reduce federal spend
