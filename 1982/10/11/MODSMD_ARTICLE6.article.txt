# Lantos, Royer clash over economic policy
## 
### BILL AINSWORTH 
Although Rep. Tom Lantos (D-San
Mateo) and Republican challenger Bill
Rover agreed in a debate last Friday
night that the ailing economy is the
most important issue in the upcoming
election, they differed sharply regard
ing the path to economic recovery.
Lantos blamed the Reagan adminis
tration for the highest unemployment
rates in the United States since 1941
(figures released last week put the na
tional rate at more than 10 percent). He
also criticized the current adminis
tration for increased spending which he
said it caused by "forcing people on
welfare and food stamps."
In contrast, Royer credited the Rea
gan administration for reducing the
rate of inflation from 12 percent in 1980
to about 5 percent for the first eight
months of! 982.
He added that interest rates are "the

big issue now." To lower interest rates,
Rover advocated further spending cuts
in all areas of the federal government,
including defense.
According to Royer, the key to eco
nomic productivity is to allow the free
enterprise system to remain productive
by providing personal incentives, such
as the tax reductions and tax credits al
ready enacted by the Reagan adminis
tration.
Lantos, however, claimed that the
tax program sponsored by Reagan gave
"the most unconscionable tax breaks to
multi-national corporations."
Lantos agreed that federal spending
"has to be brought under control" and
cited his record of voting against in
creased defense expenditures — such as
the B-l Bomber, the MX missile and
chemical weapons — as evidence of his
determination to reduce federal spend


Bill Royer

ing.
Lantos said the House nuclear freeze
bill, which he supported, but which was
defeated last summer, would have
saved the federal government $100
billion in three years.
Royer said he supports an amend
ment which would require a balanced
budget and legislation that would tie
the amount of tax revenue the federal
government could receive to some per
centage of the Gross National Product.
Lantos said he opposed the balanced

budget amendment.
Regarding Social Security, one of the
leading issues of the current campaign,
Rover blamed Congress for not taking
steps to make the fund more financially
sound several years ago when it first
began showing large deficits.
"We need to get social security back
to its orginal intent and eliminate pro
grams that have crept in there over the
years," Royer said. "Some of the pro
grams which do not go under social se
curity should be picked up by the gener
al fund," he added.
Lantos said in the short run, Social
Security could maintain its viability by
intra-fund borrowing from one of its
three funds. He said one of last year's

congressional victories was to defeat
"Reagan's onslaught against the social
security system."
Lantos assailed Royer for voting,
when he served in the House, in favor of
legislation that would have reduced
benefits to permanently injured work
ers.
Royer later defended his vote by
saying the bill would have brought ben
efit payments in line with the degree of
disability suffered by individual clai
mants.
Both candidates voiced support of
the California Nuclear Freeze in
itiative, which calls for the governor to
write a letter requesting the president to

negotiate a verifiable freeze on nuclear
arms.
Both candidates said they opposed
the draft. Royer said while in the House
he voted for increases in military
salaries as a means of upgrading the
volunteer system.
Lantos said he opposed a bill that
would have withheld financial aid from
students who failed to register for the
draft bccause it penalized students who
come from low-income families. He
called the bill "a pernicious piece of leg
islation."
More than a hundred people at
tended the debate held at the Palo Alto
Women's Club and sponsored by the
Palo Alto Jaycees.

as the tax reductions and tax credits al
ready enacted by the Reagan adminis
tration.
Lantos, however, claimed that the
tax program sponsored by Reagan gave
"the most unconscionable tax breaks to
multi-national corporations."
Lantos agreed that federal spending
"has to be brought under control" and
cited his record of voting against in
creased defense expenditures — such as
the B-l Bomber, the MX missile and
chemical weapons — as evidence of his
determination to reduce federal spend

ing.
Lantos said the House nuclear freeze
bill, which he supported, but which was
defeated last summer, would have
saved the federal government $100
billion in three years.
Royer said he supports an amend
ment which would require a balanced
budget and legislation that would tie
the amount of tax revenue the federal
government could receive to some per
centage of the Gross National Product.
Lantos said he opposed the balanced

budget amendment.
Regarding Social Security, one of the
leading issues of the current campaign,
Rover blamed Congress for not taking
steps to make the fund more financially
sound several years ago when it first
began showing large deficits.
"We need to get social security back
to its orginal intent and eliminate pro
grams that have crept in there over the
years," Royer said. "Some of the pro
grams which do not go under social se
curity should be picked up by the gener
al fund," he added.
Lantos said in the short run, Social
Security could maintain its viability by
intra-fund borrowing from one of its
three funds. He said one of last year's

congressional victories was to defeat
"Reagan's onslaught against the social
security system."
Lantos assailed Royer for voting,
when he served in the House, in favor of
legislation that would have reduced
benefits to permanently injured work
ers.
Royer later defended his vote by
saying the bill would have brought ben
efit payments in line with the degree of
disability suffered by individual clai
mants.
Both candidates voiced support of
the California Nuclear Freeze in
itiative, which calls for the governor to
write a letter requesting the president to

negotiate a verifiable freeze on nuclear
arms.
Both candidates said they opposed
the draft. Royer said while in the House
he voted for increases in military
salaries as a means of upgrading the
volunteer system.
Lantos said he opposed a bill that
would have withheld financial aid from
students who failed to register for the
draft bccause it penalized students who
come from low-income families. He
called the bill "a pernicious piece of leg
islation."
More than a hundred people at
tended the debate held at the Palo Alto
Women's Club and sponsored by the
Palo Alto Jaycees.
