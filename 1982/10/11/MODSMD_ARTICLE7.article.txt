## In transition: Mexico faces economic, political strains Reagan pledges cooperation 
### 
Compiled from news reports and wire services
Pledging cooperation and tolerance, Presi
dent Reagan and Mexican president-elect
Miguel de la Madrid met last Friday in San
Diego to discuss the two nations' economic
difficulties.
Though the meeting was touted as falling
during a critical time in Mexico's develop
ment, it was billed as an informal session for
the two leaders to get acquainted.
De la Madrid will take office Dec. 1, when
current president Jose Lopez Portillo ends his
six-year term. Since Reagan took office in
1981, he and Lopez Portillo have enjoyed a
congenial relationship. It is this personal
friendship that is credited for helping to ease
strained relations between the two countries
over such issues as bilateral trade and the
United States' role in Central America.
But the most immediate problem de la Ma
drid must face is Mexico's current economic
situation. With two currency devaluations in
one year and an inflation rate approaching
100 percent, Mexico is undergoing its worst
financial crisis in half a century, the country
has a foreign debt of $81 billion, the world's
largest for a developing country and is having
difficulty meeting the payments following an
unexpected crude oil glut which undermined
Mexican market prospects.
Prompted by concern that the Mexican
position has been misunderstood by the Unit
ed States, de la Madrid made guarded refer
ences to Reagan about the leftward turn in
Mexican rhetoric and emergency economic
measures under outgoing 'President Lopez
Portillo. The 47-year-old, former budget di
rector assured Reagan that Mexico is not
moving toward socialism.
Neither of the two leaders revealed what de
la Madrid may do when he takes office about
exchange controls or other drastic economic
steps, including the nationalization of Mexi
can banks, Lopez Portillo recently took to
cope with the plummeting value of the peso
and Mexico's huge foreign debt.
About $12 billion of American money, in
cluding $5 billion belonging to U.S. citizens
and corporations, has been frozen in Mexican
bank accounts. American banks also are
owed about $25 billion of Mexico's debt.
Mexico might find $8.3 billion during the
next year to cover an expected income gap, in
cluding that from its growing oil production
and payments due on its loans.
The United States has helped the nation ar
range a $1.85 billion credit package from the
Bank for International Settlements. The Rea

gan administration also has paid in ad
vance for $1 billion in cheap credits for
purchase of U.S. agricultural products. Rea
gan, however, did not indicate offering addi
tional financial aid to Mexico during the
meeting. Any further money would have to
involve Congress, either through foreign-aid
appropriations, which are always con
troversial, or legislation to change trade and
tariff arrangements, also not easy.
The two men were silent about Central
America, a thorn in diplomatic relations be
tween the United States and Mexico. The
Reagan administration hopes to divert Mexi
co from its previously sympathetic response
to Nicaragua left-wing insurgent movements.
But Mexico may not adopt a stance in line
with U.S. views. Mexico has been an out
spoken supporter of Nicaragua's leftist gov
ernment, in power since a July 1979 revolu
tion. Last week Mexico and Nicaragua signed
a new scientific and technical agreement in
livestock, agriculature and forestry. The
agreement, signed by Nicaraguan Agricul
ture Minister Jaime Wheelock and Mexican
Agriculture Secretary Francisco Merino
Rabago, calls for exchange of scientists, tech

nicians, specialists and researchers as well as
information and research material.
The Reagan administration is also con
sidering a Mexican-Venezuelan proposal for
negotiations to relieve tensions in Central
American concerning border disputes be
tween Nicaragua and Honduras. The pro
posal suggests that current low-level contacts
between Washington and Nicaragua be up
graded to facilitate negotiation prospects.
Reagan, however, is hesitant to consider any
plan that might force it into formal talks with
Nicaragua's Sandista government.
Though the administration wants to guard
against further criticism in Congress that its
Central America policy is frozen in an un
compromisingly anti-communist mold it is
determined to turn back what it sees as a com
munist-led drive to win control of the region.
Criticism of the administration's motives
could rekindle the controversies of recent
months about how genuinely the adminis
tration is supporting political and social re
form within the region and create new op
position in Congress to U.S. military aid for
El Salvador and Honduras.

1981, he and Lopez Portillo have enjoyed a
congenial relationship. It is this personal
friendship that is credited for helping to ease
strained relations between the two countries
over such issues as bilateral trade and the
United States' role in Central America.
But the most immediate problem de la Ma
drid must face is Mexico's current economic
situation. With two currency devaluations in
one year and an inflation rate approaching
100 percent, Mexico is undergoing its worst
financial crisis in half a century, the country
has a foreign debt of $81 billion, the world's
largest for a developing country and is having
difficulty meeting the payments following an
unexpected crude oil glut which undermined
Mexican market prospects.
Prompted by concern that the Mexican
position has been misunderstood by the Unit
ed States, de la Madrid made guarded refer
ences to Reagan about the leftward turn in
Mexican rhetoric and emergency economic
measures under outgoing 'President Lopez
Portillo. The 47-year-old, former budget di
rector assured Reagan that Mexico is not
moving toward socialism.
Neither of the two leaders revealed what de
la Madrid may do when he takes office about
exchange controls or other drastic economic
steps, including the nationalization of Mexi
can banks, Lopez Portillo recently took to
cope with the plummeting value of the peso
and Mexico's huge foreign debt.
About $12 billion of American money, in
cluding $5 billion belonging to U.S. citizens
and corporations, has been frozen in Mexican
bank accounts. American banks also are
owed about $25 billion of Mexico's debt.
Mexico might find $8.3 billion during the
next year to cover an expected income gap, in
cluding that from its growing oil production
and payments due on its loans.
The United States has helped the nation ar
range a $1.85 billion credit package from the
Bank for International Settlements. The Rea

gan administration also has paid in ad
vance for $1 billion in cheap credits for
purchase of U.S. agricultural products. Rea
gan, however, did not indicate offering addi
tional financial aid to Mexico during the
meeting. Any further money would have to
involve Congress, either through foreign-aid
appropriations, which are always con
troversial, or legislation to change trade and
tariff arrangements, also not easy.
The two men were silent about Central
America, a thorn in diplomatic relations be
tween the United States and Mexico. The
Reagan administration hopes to divert Mexi
co from its previously sympathetic response
to Nicaragua left-wing insurgent movements.
But Mexico may not adopt a stance in line
with U.S. views. Mexico has been an out
spoken supporter of Nicaragua's leftist gov
ernment, in power since a July 1979 revolu
tion. Last week Mexico and Nicaragua signed
a new scientific and technical agreement in
livestock, agriculature and forestry. The
agreement, signed by Nicaraguan Agricul
ture Minister Jaime Wheelock and Mexican
Agriculture Secretary Francisco Merino
Rabago, calls for exchange of scientists, tech

nicians, specialists and researchers as well as
information and research material.
The Reagan administration is also con
sidering a Mexican-Venezuelan proposal for
negotiations to relieve tensions in Central
American concerning border disputes be
tween Nicaragua and Honduras. The pro
posal suggests that current low-level contacts
between Washington and Nicaragua be up
graded to facilitate negotiation prospects.
Reagan, however, is hesitant to consider any
plan that might force it into formal talks with
Nicaragua's Sandista government.
Though the administration wants to guard
against further criticism in Congress that its
Central America policy is frozen in an un
compromisingly anti-communist mold it is
determined to turn back what it sees as a com
munist-led drive to win control of the region.
Criticism of the administration's motives
could rekindle the controversies of recent
months about how genuinely the adminis
tration is supporting political and social re
form within the region and create new op
position in Congress to U.S. military aid for
El Salvador and Honduras.

Compiled from news reports and wire services
Pledging cooperation and tolerance, Presi
dent Reagan and Mexican president-elect
Miguel de la Madrid met last Friday in San
Diego to discuss the two nations' economic
difficulties.
Though the meeting was touted as falling
during a critical time in Mexico's develop
ment, it was billed as an informal session for
the two leaders to get acquainted.
De la Madrid will take office Dec. 1, when
current president Jose Lopez Portillo ends his
six-year term. Since Reagan took office in
1981, he and Lopez Portillo have enjoyed a

friendship that is credited for helping to ease
