# Mexican gov't negotiates IMF loan
## 
### 
Compiled from news reports and wire services
In the grip of a severe recession and pos
sible labor disputes, Mexican President Jose
Lopez Portillo is on the verge of signing a
$3.92 billion, three-year loan agreement with
the International Monetary Fund.
The move signals the swallowing of na
tionalistic pride that has blocked resort to the
IMF in the past.
American bankers are particularly nervous
because $25 billion of that debt is owed to
them, and 90 percent of the total debt is in
dollars. A Mexican default would rock the
world financial system, and would leave U.S.
lenders such as BankAmerica, Chase Man
hattan and Citicorp holding bad loans of over
$10 billion.
Meanwhile, the peso was devalued twice
this year — from 27 to the dollar to its current

70 — making Mexican goods cheaper on the
international market but fueling inflation as
imports became more expensive.
Not only does the international front look
grim, but domestic tensions are also mount
ing. Along the U.S.-Mexico border, Mexican
supermarket shelves were stripped of necessi
ties by Americans with dollars worth three
times as many pesos as a year ago. For Ameri
can-side merchants whose chief patronage is
Mexican, business is off by as much as 65 per
cent.
To stop this flow of foods from Mexican
markets, Portillo's government issued a food
export ban forbidding the transfer of certain
items such as eggs and meat across the border
into the U.S. But neither shoppers nor cus
tom officials seem to know specifically what
foods are restricted, or what happens to those

who are caught with too much.
Portillo also instituted currency controls
which limit the amount of money that anyone
may take out of Mexico. The central bank,
which has the sole authority to hold or trade
foreign currencies, is keeping all U.S. dollars
to pay off the national debt, despite having es
tablished an official exchange rate.
As a result, foreign-owned businesses may
have trouble sending profits home; many
Mexican companies are unable to obtain for
eign currencies to pay off outside debts; and
local banks are not releasing dollars for
checks or credits.
The crisis stems from the government's
frantic food and currency measures, which
lack planning and specific enforcement pro
cedures.
