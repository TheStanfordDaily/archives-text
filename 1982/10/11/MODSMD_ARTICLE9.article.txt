# Labor federation seeks wage increase
## 
### 
Compiled from news reports and wire services
In the midst of nationwide economic uncertainty, Mexican labor
groups are scheduled to meet today in the hopes of negotiating a re
covery of purchasing power eroded by the devalued peso and mount
ing inflation.
The meeting is a prelude to upcoming wage talks between the na
tional labor union and Mexican industry.
Citing the cost-of-living increase as the basis for negotiations, Fidel
Velasquez, secretary-general of Mexico's major labor federation told
reporters last Thursday that member unions may ask for a 50 percent
salary hike. In an earlier letter to regional and state offices of the Con
federation of Mexican Workers, Velasquez said the wage increases are
necessary because inflation for the year through September was
clocked at 66 percent and could soar to 100 percent by the time Presi
dent-elect Miguel de la Madrid takes office in December.
If demands are not met, the labor union is prepared to launch a na
tionwide strike. Velasquez, who said businesses wanting to avoid
strikes should make sure tht workers' lost purchasing power is re

stored explained that each union will make its demand based on the
economic capacity of each business. Wages, said Velasquez, "barely
represent 3 percent of the cost of production."
Because union members comprise roughly 20 percent of a Mexican
labor force numbering 18 million, the effect of a strike could be far
reaching. Minimum wage is four dollars a day. If negotiations arc un
successful, strikes could begin within three weeks.
While unable to refute the possibility of widespread strikes, Mexi
co's Labor Secretary, Sergio Garcia Ramirez, told reporters last week
that the labor sector has been reasonable. It "has not made requests
for impossible things, it has moderated its demands, it has asked for
what is just and should obtain what is just," Garcia Ramirez said. He
also denied that the talks will take place in an atmosphere of confron
tation. "There is a process of economic adjustment — difficult and
painful — in which the sectors of production are participating," the
labor secretary said.
