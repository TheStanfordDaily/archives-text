The
NUCLEAR
DISARMAMOTTA
PLACIDLY AMID THE SCORCHED
CITIES AND THE BURNING BODIES
AND REMEMBER WHAT PEACE
there once was on this Earth. A As far as possible
open up your eyes to the alarming rate of arms buildup
and try to think of alternatives, for we pass this way
but once. A The arms race is becoming absurd if not
statistically insane, a We are all sisters and brothers
of this fragile planet with its nation-states and their
devastating armaments, and nuclear war will only
mean one thing: mutiially-assured-destruction (MAD).
March peacefully in large united groups to protest this
insanity and send messages to those who represent you
in Congress, Parliament or the Politburo, A Write
also to your representatives in the United Nations and
tell them of your fears and your tremblings, A When
you see the arms race proliferate, counsel the nations
of the world to spend their monies more wisely and for
human benefit, A GO out among your fellow citizens
and cross borders and boundaries to spread the word
of disarmament, A There is no reason under the sun
for nations to frighten other nations and a war will
solve nothing although it might end everything, A
There can be no victor in the holocaust that is so
possible, A
With your determination and your love of life, strive to
convince others of the need for worldwide dis
armament and be true to your own convictions and
insights. Believe in the future and work for peace, A
You are not alone.
