# Name changed, terminals added at LOTS

### BILL BEY DA 
The University's Low Overhead Timesharing
System (LOTS) is presently undergoing major
changes to meet the high demand for computer facil
ities, which should shorten the queues that students
have come to expect from what they joke is really a
"Largely Overcrowded Timesharing System."
"Our goal is to provide greater flexibility in the
deployment of our scarce resources," said Ralph
Gorin, director of LOTS.
Last year there were two computers: LOTS and
LESS. The LESS computer system, which was on
loan from the Graduate School of Business, has
been replaced by the same model computer, a DEC
2060, and named LOTSB. However, the new com
puter has more memory, which will allow for addi
tional terminals. The original LOTS computer has
been renamed LOTSA.
Gorin said the new DEC 2060 is operating rela
tively successfully- -- Tf; -,nrrr .
LOTSiias also acquired several new terminals to
allow more students to use the computers at one
time, and to cut down on the long queues that have

plagued students in the past. The terminals will be
installed as soon as LOTS can find space for them.
"We're a little bit tight on space right now," Gorin
said.
A few terminals will be added in CERAS and
Terman near the current terminals, wherever space
permits. However, the bulk of the new terminals
cannot be installed until more space is made avail
able to LOTS by the School of Education. LOTSB
currently has 48 terminals and the additional
purchase will increase this number to 96. LOTSA
will continue to operate with 80 terminals.
The new terminals replace some of the older
models, and these will be made available for
purchase to the Stanford community in the future,
Gorin said. The terminals, made by ADM and Ha
zeltine, can connect to LOTS via "dial-in" lines. The
user simply calls either system using a standard tele
phone and a modem (modulator-demodulator),
which allows the terminal and the computer to com? .
municate; the number of these "dial-in" lines is ex
pected to increase.
Presently, 16 terminals can call-up and connect to

LOTSA from a distance, and four can connect to
LOTSB. Soon, 24 terminals will be able to connect
to LOTSA by phone, while 20 terminals will be able
to connect to LOTSB.
LOTS will also supply Residential Education
with 15 terminals and modems for use in campus res
idences, Gorin said. The location of these terminals
will be determined by Res Ed.
The new computer and additional terminals are
only the beginning of the upgrading of the LOTS fa
cilities. The Ethernet, which would allow any termi
nal to connect to either LOTSA or LOTSB, will be
implemented on a small scale at CERAS this quar
ter, and will probably be expanded to include all
LOTS terminals in winter quarter, Gorin said.
When in operation, Ethernet will allow the users
to "sit down at any terminal and ask for the ap
propriate computer," Gorin said. This would be a
large advantage, especially in Terman, where cur
rently there arejanly LOTSA terminals.
"We are trying to distribute the use of computers
across campus through the use of Ethernet," Gorin
said.
