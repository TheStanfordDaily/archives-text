## Of snakes and rocks in Nevada 
### JENNIFER SEYMOUR 
A dirt-floored work tent in
Stawberry Creek, Nevada, is a
far cry from the cozy classrooms
of Stanford's History Corner.
But Strawberry Creek and many
flimsy tents were as much a part
of Stanford this summer as the
! History Corner.
Here, in east Nevada's Snake
Ranges, the Stanford Geology
Department set base camp for its
notorious Field mapping course,
Geology 103.
This intensive program is de
signed to provide actual Field ex
perience for geology under
graduate students. Required as
part of the geology major, the
venture unites 20 to 30 students,
four teaching assistants (TAs)
1 and seven to eight weeks of tent
living. It is currently organized
and taught by Geology Prof.
Elizabeth Miller.
Geology 103 is unique for rea
sons beyond its concentrated na
ture and removed setting, for it
offers students the chance to de
velop their Field skills in hotly de
bated or misinterpreted areas.
For the past few years, different
problem areas in the Snake
Range have received the atten
tion of the Stanford Geological
Survey (SGS).
' "It (summer Field mapping) is a
great opportunity for TAs and
students to get a good bit of Field
experience and learn about an
important area of Western Unit
ed States geology. It's also a good
time it's a relaxed educational
experience, as opposed to the
structured format of a
classroom," Bill Whiteford said.
Whiteford, a masters student in
geology, was a TA in 1982's sum
mer group.
Geology 103, conducted as
part of the SGS, is notorious to
geology undergraduates. "The
students from years before paint
a hard-assed picture of Field
camp," recalls one veteran 103
student. "We approached the
course with very much trepida
tion, because we had been told
tales of snake dodging, incredible
heat and a lot of hard work."
h The reputedly substantial rat
tlesnake population (from which
the Snake Range derives its

name) is one aspect students were
especially aware of before this
summer's Field course began, be
cause SGS 1981 had met with
snakes in suitcases and tents reg
ularly.
SGS 1982 students heard very
few rattles during their Snake
Range sojourn, however. "I was
surprised by the lack of the prob
lem," said Whiteford. "And even
last year, when the lower eleva
tion of camp exposed the group
to more snakes, there was never a
danger of someone being bit."
No one has ever been bit on a
summer geology course.
How does teaching occur in so
vast a classroom as Nevada's
Snake Range? Hot breakfasts,
rain gear and sturdy vans and
teaching assistants are crucial in
gredients. Initially divided into
groups of four students, mapping
days meant 6:15 a.m. breakfasts,
van rides from base camp to the
map areas and an eight to nine
hour day of trailing rock units
and faults.
A jump in the creek or the
nearby reservoir capped
scorching days, while stormy
ones found students huddled in
the kitchen tent, hands warming
over the burners.
At first, one TA joined each
group each day to demonstrate
mapping techniques or share in
the befuddlement if the geology
became overwhelming. Later,
students mapped alone, or in
pairs, with TAs assisting in prob
lem areas only.
"The hardest part of TAing
was that the Snake Range is a
controversial place, and it in
volves extensive knowledge of
the regional geology to be an ef
fective teacher. It was as much
learning for the TAs as the stu
dents at first, which made it hard
to help students sometimes," said
Whiteford.
On days off once a week ex
cept for a three-day respite over
the Fourth of July students
ventured to nearby Baker, Ne
vada (population 400) or to the
larger Ely (60 miles away) for
laundry-washing and a shower.
For the three-day weekend, some
students fled as far as Lake
Tahoe, or Salt Lake City, anx

ious for "a movie," "junk food"
or "an escape." More relaxing
trips to Moriah's, the local bar
and restaurant, were also popu
lar.

Field work continued for seven
weeks, during which time stu
dents mapped and wrote Field re
ports on almost 200 square miles
of Nevada mountains and high
desert geology. Reactions by the
end of summer Field camp ranged
from despair at even one more
day out there to despair at having
to return to 'civilization'.
The weeks of tents and jeans
were followed by desk work back
at Stanford. Aside from in-Field
reports written by each group in
Nevada, each student also pro
duces their own comprehensive
paper on the geology of the
mapped area.
Though this aspect of the Field
experience is most bemoaned by
students, Miller offers careful
guidance, as well as inspiration:
"We know more about the geolo
gy of this area than basically any
one else right now. That should
feel pretty good to you all."
The paper reflects this knowl
edge: each one incorporates 30 to
40 pages of rock descriptions
produced as a group, and indi
vidual manuscripts range from
30 to 60 pages.
"I thought that although it re
quired too much work, writing
the paper was well worth it. It
made you look at and synthesize
a vast amount of data," says Jeff
Lee, a Ph.D. student in geology
who attended summer Field trip
this year.
"The paper was a really hairy
project," said another student.
"But we learned a lot about sci
entiFic writing and the geology. I
felt like a competent geologist af
ter the whole experience was
over. A few people were still
bewildered by the whole thing, I
guess."
The course earns under
graduates 12 units altogether. "It
probably isn't enough," says Lee.
"But I had so much fun that I'd
have done it for less. The low
point of 103 was having to ever
come back from it. is
beautiful, and the geology was
great."

This intensive program is de
signed to provide actual Field ex
perience for geology under
graduate students. Required as
part of the geology major, the
venture unites 20 to 30 students,
four teaching assistants (TAs)
1 and seven to eight weeks of tent
living. It is currently organized
and taught by Geology Prof.
Elizabeth Miller.
Geology 103 is unique for rea
sons beyond its concentrated na
ture and removed setting, for it
offers students the chance to de
velop their Field skills in hotly de
bated or misinterpreted areas.
For the past few years, different
problem areas in the Snake
Range have received the atten
tion of the Stanford Geological
Survey (SGS).
' "It (summer Field mapping) is a
great opportunity for TAs and
students to get a good bit of Field
experience and learn about an
important area of Western Unit
ed States geology. It's also a good
time it's a relaxed educational
experience, as opposed to the
structured format of a
classroom," Bill Whiteford said.
Whiteford, a masters student in
geology, was a TA in 1982's sum
mer group.
Geology 103, conducted as
part of the SGS, is notorious to
geology undergraduates. "The
students from years before paint
a hard-assed picture of Field
camp," recalls one veteran 103
student. "We approached the
course with very much trepida
tion, because we had been told
tales of snake dodging, incredible
heat and a lot of hard work."
h The reputedly substantial rat
tlesnake population (from which
the Snake Range derives its

name) is one aspect students were
especially aware of before this
summer's Field course began, be
cause SGS 1981 had met with
snakes in suitcases and tents reg
ularly.
SGS 1982 students heard very
few rattles during their Snake
Range sojourn, however. "I was
surprised by the lack of the prob
lem," said Whiteford. "And even
last year, when the lower eleva
tion of camp exposed the group
to more snakes, there was never a
danger of someone being bit."
No one has ever been bit on a
summer geology course.
How does teaching occur in so
vast a classroom as Nevada's
Snake Range? Hot breakfasts,
rain gear and sturdy vans and
teaching assistants are crucial in
gredients. Initially divided into
groups of four students, mapping
days meant 6:15 a.m. breakfasts,
van rides from base camp to the
map areas and an eight to nine
hour day of trailing rock units
and faults.
A jump in the creek or the
nearby reservoir capped
scorching days, while stormy
ones found students huddled in
the kitchen tent, hands warming
over the burners.
At first, one TA joined each
group each day to demonstrate
mapping techniques or share in
the befuddlement if the geology
became overwhelming. Later,
students mapped alone, or in
pairs, with TAs assisting in prob
lem areas only.
"The hardest part of TAing
was that the Snake Range is a
controversial place, and it in
volves extensive knowledge of
the regional geology to be an ef
fective teacher. It was as much
learning for the TAs as the stu
dents at first, which made it hard
to help students sometimes," said
Whiteford.
On days off once a week ex
cept for a three-day respite over
the Fourth of July students
ventured to nearby Baker, Ne
vada (population 400) or to the
larger Ely (60 miles away) for
laundry-washing and a shower.
For the three-day weekend, some
students fled as far as Lake
Tahoe, or Salt Lake City, anx

ious for "a movie," "junk food"
or "an escape." More relaxing
trips to Moriah's, the local bar
and restaurant, were also popu
lar.

Field work continued for seven
weeks, during which time stu
dents mapped and wrote Field re
ports on almost 200 square miles
of Nevada mountains and high
desert geology. Reactions by the
end of summer Field camp ranged
from despair at even one more
day out there to despair at having
to return to 'civilization'.
The weeks of tents and jeans
were followed by desk work back
at Stanford. Aside from in-Field
reports written by each group in
Nevada, each student also pro
duces their own comprehensive
paper on the geology of the
mapped area.
Though this aspect of the Field
experience is most bemoaned by
students, Miller offers careful
guidance, as well as inspiration:
"We know more about the geolo
gy of this area than basically any
one else right now. That should
feel pretty good to you all."
The paper reflects this knowl
edge: each one incorporates 30 to
40 pages of rock descriptions
produced as a group, and indi
vidual manuscripts range from
30 to 60 pages.
"I thought that although it re
quired too much work, writing
the paper was well worth it. It
made you look at and synthesize
a vast amount of data," says Jeff
Lee, a Ph.D. student in geology
who attended summer Field trip
this year.
"The paper was a really hairy
project," said another student.
"But we learned a lot about sci
entiFic writing and the geology. I
felt like a competent geologist af
ter the whole experience was
over. A few people were still
bewildered by the whole thing, I
guess."
The course earns under
graduates 12 units altogether. "It
probably isn't enough," says Lee.
"But I had so much fun that I'd
have done it for less. The low
point of 103 was having to ever
come back from it. is
beautiful, and the geology was
great."
A dirt-floored work tent in
Stawberry Creek, Nevada, is a
