## THE
						STANFORD DAILY October may prove 'surprising' 
### 
One of the great American political traditions is
"October Surprise." This technique permits a flag
ging partisan cause to produce a sudden miracle or
spectacular achievement in the last two or three
weeks of October, thus impressing the electorate
with the expertise of the magician/politician. As a
result, the economy, or the stock market, usually
takes some form of upswing during the "Indian
summer" doldrums of election years. Is this mere
pump-priming, or is it the real McCoy? One never
knows until after the November elections.
When the stock market first began to rocket into
the stratosphere, President Reagan was quick to
jump onto its soaring tail by claiming credit for his
supply-side policies. By Filling the airwaves with his
brash boasting, the president diverted attention
from the dismal 9.8 percent unemployment then ex
tant.
When the Federal Reserve made a desperation
move and lowered the discount rate, the president
was not shy in proclaiming the links between declin
ing interest rates and prosperity, and between pros
perity and Reaganomics.
Then the boom was lowered on Friday. The Bu
reau of Labor Statistics announced that the un
employment rate had reached the awesome heights
of 10.1 percent, the worst level since the Great De
pression year of 1940, with the following results:
11.3 million people are unemployed, 6.6 million
people are subsisting with only part-time jobs and
1.6 million "discouraged workers" have given up
any hope of Finding a job. The total picture is un
believably bleak: 19.5 million Americans have been
unable to achieve the "American dream" goal of
full-time employment, thus placing tremendous
strains upon the social fabric of the country.
Speaking in Long Beach on Friday, Reagan ap
peared to have been caught on his blind side. The
president admonished the crowd to "guard against
the people who will try to make a political football
out of this cruel tragedy." Interesting and ironic ad
vice from the chief executive, especially since the
Gipper has been carrying the political football
across the economic playing Fields for some weeks
now.

When the smoke has cleared, certain sane and ra
tional principles will be accepted by the public. A
tone of skepticism is appropriate for the shorten
ing, multi-hued days of autumn.
The stock market is only one indicator of eco
nomic performance; high-flying speculation does
not necessarily guarantee successful job-creation
programs. Beneficiaries of the soaring stock prices
may not choose to reinvest their windfall gains in
the American economy. Foreign investors who
have participated in the Wall Street Follies may
simply cash-in their chips and walk home, leaving
behind only broken promises and cigar butts in
their wake.
Dropping interest rates do not necessarily guar
antee increasing consumer confidence and lavish
spending patterns. A simple interest rate drop may
not inspire a credit-stretched public to risk personal
financial disaster through the "overextended"
purchase of homes and "large ticket" durable
goods. A brief interest rate drop in the middle of the
Carter administration did not produce the deeply
desired buying spree.
Even the unemployment statistics cannot be
taken at face value. Comparisons with Depression
era figures must be taken with a grain of salt. More
Americans are working today than ever before in
our history: 99.6 million. On the other hand, many
experts believe that the president's war on inflation
has been fought on the backs of young people just
entering the job market and workers in small and
marginal industries.
The conclusion? Don't base your vote in Novem
ber on any single economic factor or indicator:
stock market performance or declining interest
rates. Many different factors have shaped the econ
omy's performance; many other factors may mod
ify, mitigate or reverse its direction.
Nevertheless, the Reagan administration and its
policies should be judged harshly, for the responsi
bility still resides in the Oval Office. Like the World
Series, October Surprise is just another American
autumn classic.
