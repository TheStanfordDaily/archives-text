## Kresge's 'Mem Pest' bugs residents 
### 
Call it "Mem Pest." Resembling two
giant mosquitos mating in a position
known only to mosquitos, the new
metal sculpture which recently landed
behind Kresge Auditorium is a shock
ing addition to Stanford's otherwise
pleasant landscape.
The sculptor has achieved his ap
parent objective: to create a grotesque,
indeed shocking, art work capable of
grabbing the attention of every half
sober passerby, if not scaring to death
the poor soul who glances at it in a
drunken stupor.
Maybe students will gain from the
traumatic art experience this jagged
hunk of steel seems to demand of its

viewers.
Yet there was a day when students
frolicked in the grass field where the
pest has landed, diving for frisbees or
footballs, blowing off steam the pres
sures of academics create. The grass
area had a definite and important func
tion, unlike the obscure purpose of this
new masterpiece.
"But this area wasn't designed as an
athletic field," administrators will say.
The area wasn't made for a foul-look
ing metal monster either. Someone who
doesn't live in the area declared that if
you can't bring Stanford students to the
museum, bring the museum to them.
Ambition of such magnitude is ad-

mirable.
Yet students, while perhaps lacking
cultural sophistication, can do without
metal monstrosities on every small plot
of grass, especially ones that are often
played on. For proof of this, one need
only to ask residents in the area what
they think of this eyesore.
The Pest is here to stay; there's no
taking this exhibit to a different
museum. But in the future the Univer
sity should give second thoughts to
placing strange beasts on once-useful
areas of grass.
