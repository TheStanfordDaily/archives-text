## Nuclear freeze opinion falls prey to dangerous simplification 
### 
In his farewell address to the Ameri
can people, President George Washing
ton advised that "the nation which in
dulges toward another in habitual ha
tred, or an habitual fondness, is in some
degree a slave. It is a slave to its
animosity or to its affection, either of
which is sufficient to lead it astray from
its duty and its interest." Kevin Gross,
in his essay {Daily, Oct. 4) condemning
the Nuclear Freeze Initiative, has fallen
prey to such an habitual hatred that he
not only stands far astray of our ul
timate national duty and interest (the
prevention of nuclear war), but does so
through far more misleading "smear
tactics and gross simplification" than
he asserts that the "Yes on 12 Commit
tee" employs.
Gross somehow feels he has mastered
sufficient wisdom and insight to de
lineate clearly "the military superiority
of the Soviet Union" at a time most in
formed observers agree with Richard
Allen, President Reagan's former na
tional security adviser, who stated in
September 1981 that the United States
and the Soviet Union are "equal in
almost every meaningful measure of
military power." The figures Gross re
lates as facts derive from an eminently
questionable, if not unbelievable
source: the movie, "The Salt Syn
drome." The editorial board of the Dai
ly might provide a valuable service to
the Stanford community with the pro
vision of a critical, unbiased appraisal
of the figures Gross presents. Yet, to
consider nuclear superiority and the
threat of nuclear war in the type of a
vacuous calculations in which Gross
engages trivializes the assuredly
catastrophic outcome of a nuclear ex
change.

I would posit that rather than the
freeze being "one of the most danger
ous ideas ever to receive publicity in re
cent year," it is the belief, to which
Gross evidently subscribes, that a nu
clear conflict is fightable, survivable
and winnable. Such a conclusion is
medically, socially, ecologically and
morally bankrupt. With just two U.S.

Poseidon submarines, carrying pay
loads of 320 nuclear weapons (with the
destructive potential of 1000
Hiroshima-size weapons), capable of
destroying all the 200 major Soviet
cities and immune to counter-attack,
one can understand Soviet President
Leonid Brezhnev's position that "only
he who has decided to commit suicide
can start a nuclear war in the hope of
emerging a victor from it. No matter
what, the attacker might possess, no
matter what method of unleashing nu
clear war he chooses, he will not attain
his aims. Retribution will ensue ineluc
tably." That Gross may not want to be
lieve the inevitable "massive destruc
tion" and the "horror of nuclear war"
does not make these outcomes any less
certain. The magnitude of the ensuing
destruction can scarcely be imagined,
but it cannot be denied.
An escalated arms race will not make
us more secure, and with Gross so con
vinced of the Soviets' unyielding
malevolence, I doubt he would suggest
that they would capitulate in such a
contest. Deterrence may not be the
most elegant defensive strategy, but it
is, at present, the only one we have. We
are not more secure if the Soviets feel
mote threatened, just as they must find
no comfort in the paranoia so popular
in Washington these days. More weap
ons, particularly those intended for war
fighting (like the MX missile) greatly
threaten the stability of a balance upon
which our security delicately rests. A
freeze on nuclear weapons production
and deployment can provide that stabil
ity and enable us to nurture the good
will and understanding necessary to
pursue future mutual, verifiable arms
reductions. Gross does not feel that the
Soviets can be trusted to accompany us
along this course, but I am far more in
clined to agree with William Colby,
former Director of the CIA and early
supporter of the Nuclear Freeze con
cept. I am also proud to be counted
among the millions of Americans from
all political, religious and social back
grounds who are exercising their demo

cratic rights and responsibilities in the
pursuit of freedom from the threat of
nuclear holocaust.
I am appalled by Gross' suggestion
that "secret Soviet money is being
pumped into the campaign" and dis
turbed that the Daily permits the publi
cation of such malignant aspersions in
an entirely unsubstantiated form.
Gross rightly condemns "a country that
suppresses all peace movements within
its borders," but does his essay not ad
vocate a similar approach to the peace
movement in this country? John Ken
neth Galbraith has suggested that in the
aftermath of a nuclear exchange "com
munist ashes and capitalist ashes will be
indistinguishable." Gross is apparently
having difficulty with the discrimina
tion during the prelude.
Informed, rational discussion of
these issues must be encouraged as we,
as a nation, examine the most mean
ingful path of national security, but
paranoid, inaccurate and hostile ma
chinations must be abhorred. I regret
that Gross' column has elicited a far
more angry response from me than I
would have liked. It is clear that we all
have much to learn about how to live
amicably together, and that is our only
viable alternative. One observer has
proposed that we "must avoid becom
ing a community of dreadful fear and
hate, and be, instead, a proud con
federation of mutual trust and respect.
Disarmament, with mutual honor and
confidence, is a continuing imperative.
Together we must learn how to com
pose differences, not with arms, but
with intellect and decent purpose." No
communist he. I think that President
Dwight Eisenhower's insights point us
in the right direction.

The collection of photographs en
titled "Lebanon: The Scars of War" by
Jeff Rosenschein {Daily, Oct. 6) de
serves a double take. Strangely, it

showed none of the devastation caused
by Israel's air, sea and land assault last
June. Nor did it show the damage from
ten years of Israeli bombing before that.
Instead, the pictures were of two un
damaged streets in Beirut, a PLO am
munition bunker and a church in
Damour attacked by the PLO in 1977.
Rosenchein's photographs suggest
that only the PLO is responsible for any
war damage in Lebanon. This is a cruel
ly misleading message. There were no
pictures of the victims of Israel's attack,
yet the Lebanese government has of
ficially reported that at least 8000 peo
ple were killed and 20,000 wounded
90 percent of them civilians. Still un
counted are those who died in the
massive bombing of refugee camps and
were shoved by bulldozers into mass
graves.
Rosenchein's choice of subjects may
have been influenced by the strict
censorship regulations Israel has im
posed in the areas it controls. If his ex
pedition was subject to such controls
the Daily should have noted that fact.
If, on the other hand, Rosenschein
made his own choice of subjects, then
he is guilty of slanted journalism.

grounds who are exercising their demo

cratic rights and responsibilities in the
pursuit of freedom from the threat of
nuclear holocaust.
I am appalled by Gross' suggestion
that "secret Soviet money is being
pumped into the campaign" and dis
turbed that the Daily permits the publi
cation of such malignant aspersions in
an entirely unsubstantiated form.
Gross rightly condemns "a country that
suppresses all peace movements within
its borders," but does his essay not ad
vocate a similar approach to the peace
movement in this country? John Ken
neth Galbraith has suggested that in the
aftermath of a nuclear exchange "com
munist ashes and capitalist ashes will be
indistinguishable." Gross is apparently
having difficulty with the discrimina
tion during the prelude.
Informed, rational discussion of
these issues must be encouraged as we,
as a nation, examine the most mean
ingful path of national security, but
paranoid, inaccurate and hostile ma
chinations must be abhorred. I regret
that Gross' column has elicited a far
more angry response from me than I
would have liked. It is clear that we all
have much to learn about how to live
amicably together, and that is our only
viable alternative. One observer has
proposed that we "must avoid becom
ing a community of dreadful fear and
hate, and be, instead, a proud con
federation of mutual trust and respect.
Disarmament, with mutual honor and
confidence, is a continuing imperative.
Together we must learn how to com
pose differences, not with arms, but

The collection of photographs en
titled "Lebanon: The Scars of War" by
Jeff Rosenschein {Daily, Oct. 6) de
serves a double take. Strangely, it

showed none of the devastation caused
by Israel's air, sea and land assault last
June. Nor did it show the damage from
ten years of Israeli bombing before that.
Instead, the pictures were of two un
damaged streets in Beirut, a PLO am
munition bunker and a church in
Damour attacked by the PLO in 1977.
Rosenchein's photographs suggest
that only the PLO is responsible for any
war damage in Lebanon. This is a cruel
ly misleading message. There were no
pictures of the victims of Israel's attack,
yet the Lebanese government has of
ficially reported that at least 8000 peo
ple were killed and 20,000 wounded
90 percent of them civilians. Still un
counted are those who died in the
massive bombing of refugee camps and
were shoved by bulldozers into mass
graves.
Rosenchein's choice of subjects may
have been influenced by the strict
censorship regulations Israel has im
posed in the areas it controls. If his ex
pedition was subject to such controls
the Daily should have noted that fact.
If, on the other hand, Rosenschein
made his own choice of subjects, then
he is guilty of slanted journalism.

In his farewell address to the Ameri
can people, President George Washing
ton advised that "the nation which in
dulges toward another in habitual ha
tred, or an habitual fondness, is in some
degree a slave. It is a slave to its
animosity or to its affection, either of
which is sufficient to lead it astray from
its duty and its interest." Kevin Gross,
in his essay {Daily, Oct. 4) condemning
the Nuclear Freeze Initiative, has fallen
prey to such an habitual hatred that he
not only stands far astray of our ul
timate national duty and interest (the
prevention of nuclear war), but does so
through far more misleading "smear
tactics and gross simplification" than
he asserts that the "Yes on 12 Commit
tee" employs.
Gross somehow feels he has mastered
sufficient wisdom and insight to de
lineate clearly "the military superiority
of the Soviet Union" at a time most in
formed observers agree with Richard
Allen, President Reagan's former na
tional security adviser, who stated in
September 1981 that the United States
and the Soviet Union are "equal in
almost every meaningful measure of
military power." The figures Gross re
lates as facts derive from an eminently
questionable, if not unbelievable
source: the movie, "The Salt Syn
drome." The editorial board of the Dai
ly might provide a valuable service to
the Stanford community with the pro
vision of a critical, unbiased appraisal
of the figures Gross presents. Yet, to
consider nuclear superiority and the
threat of nuclear war in the type of a
vacuous calculations in which Gross
engages trivializes the assuredly
catastrophic outcome of a nuclear ex
change.

I would posit that rather than the
freeze being "one of the most danger
ous ideas ever to receive publicity in re
cent year," it is the belief, to which
Gross evidently subscribes, that a nu
clear conflict is fightable, survivable
and winnable. Such a conclusion is
medically, socially, ecologically and
morally bankrupt. With just two U.S.

Poseidon submarines, carrying pay
loads of 320 nuclear weapons (with the
destructive potential of 1000
Hiroshima-size weapons), capable of
destroying all the 200 major Soviet
cities and immune to counter-attack,
one can understand Soviet President
Leonid Brezhnev's position that "only
he who has decided to commit suicide
can start a nuclear war in the hope of
emerging a victor from it. No matter
what, the attacker might possess, no
matter what method of unleashing nu
clear war he chooses, he will not attain
his aims. Retribution will ensue ineluc
tably." That Gross may not want to be
lieve the inevitable "massive destruc
tion" and the "horror of nuclear war"
does not make these outcomes any less
certain. The magnitude of the ensuing
destruction can scarcely be imagined,
but it cannot be denied.
An escalated arms race will not make
us more secure, and with Gross so con
vinced of the Soviets' unyielding
malevolence, I doubt he would suggest
that they would capitulate in such a
contest. Deterrence may not be the
most elegant defensive strategy, but it
is, at present, the only one we have. We
are not more secure if the Soviets feel
mote threatened, just as they must find
no comfort in the paranoia so popular
in Washington these days. More weap
ons, particularly those intended for war
fighting (like the MX missile) greatly
threaten the stability of a balance upon
which our security delicately rests. A
freeze on nuclear weapons production
and deployment can provide that stabil
ity and enable us to nurture the good
will and understanding necessary to
pursue future mutual, verifiable arms
reductions. Gross does not feel that the
Soviets can be trusted to accompany us
along this course, but I am far more in
clined to agree with William Colby,
former Director of the CIA and early
supporter of the Nuclear Freeze con
cept. I am also proud to be counted
among the millions of Americans from
all political, religious and social back
grounds who are exercising their demo

cratic rights and responsibilities in the
