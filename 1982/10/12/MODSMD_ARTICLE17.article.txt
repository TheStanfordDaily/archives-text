## Mill and the exclusionary rule 
### 
Legal doctrine presently insists that
evidence collected in violation of legal
procedures is not admissable. Under
this "exclusionary rule" many brutal
criminals whom we know to be guilty
escape prosecution. It is infuriating to
let these criminals go free and there is
strong pressure to overturn the ex
clusionary rule. But the principle en
forces restrictions on police actions that

are necessary in free society. Is there
some way to modify the rule that does
not throw the baby out with the bath
water?
One highly visible argument for re
strictions on police actions is to main
tain the rule of law, defend our political
liberties and generally to keep our liber
alism from succumbing to tyranny. But
it is not clear that securing our ability to
resist tyranny requires us to be ineffec
tive in prosecution of criminals.

Indeed, if this were all there was to it,
confidence in our character and ability
might alone compel us to relax the ex
lusionary rule. It would then be possible
for evidence to be admiss i ble so long as
enforcement officers are not found to
have intentionally violated the law.

But there is another, far more person
al, reason for enforcing restrictions on
police action. That is the right to
privacy.
John Stuart Mill's celebrated dictum
on liberty advocates "liberty of tastes
and pursuits; of doing what we like,
subject to such consequences as may
follow: without impediment from our
fellow-creatures, so long as what we do

does not harm them, even though they
should think our conduct foolish, per
verse, or wrong."
I have long lamented that Mill's dic
tum is not explicitly a part of our Con
stitution, but a right to privacy can be
viewed as a rough and ready way to se
cure Mill's liberalism. So long as one is
discreet one can reasonably expect to
live free from prosecution, without hav-

ing to bend to the dictates of an illiberal
"tyranny of the majority."
If restrictions on police action are
viewed as pursuant, in part, to a right to
privacy, then excessive freedom for the
police is not what we want. Suppose a
policeipan enters my house in an honest
case of mistaken identity and finds me
with a joint. Mill's dictum is not served
if 1 can then be prosecuted with that evi
dence.
Rather, a different modification of
the exclusionary rule is suggested. To
secure Mill's dictum, police actions
need be restricted only concerning "vic
timless" crimes. The dictum would not

be undermined by allowing the murder
weapon found in an improper search to
be admissable as evidence.
Since our legal system has never de
lineated the different reasons for re
strictions on police action, it is even
possible that restrictions applying to
non-victimless crimes are too strong,
being held back by our fear of laws that
violate Mill's dictum.
Perhaps the easiest way to sort out
the various considerations would be to
have two sets of legal procedures for
victimless and non-victimless crimes.
There could be less restraint on fighting
non-victimless crimes, but evidence ob
tained under these procedures would be
strictly excluded in the prosecution of
victimless crimes. £
This change of legal doctrine, based
on Mill's interpretation of the right to
privacy, would most naturally come
about through court opinion. Doctrine
might also be affected by legislation,
and the Reagan administration could
take the lead in this area.
One fear raised by interpreting the
right to privacy as pursuant to Mill's
dictum is whether abortion, which is
presently protected under the right to
privacy, might get classified a non-vic-

timless crime. I do not think this is a
problem. Note that the ability to plan
one's life is prominent in Mill's dictum.
If accordingly we accept planning as
our context, then abortion becomes
neutral.
It is different, of course, if one be
lieves that a special humanity inhabits
the future child at conception, a soul if
you like. But this is a religious distinc
tion, and, however strongly one is
moved by it, one must recognize
our Constitution demands separation
of church and state.
