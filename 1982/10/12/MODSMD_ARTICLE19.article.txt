## CANDIDATE STANCES COMPARED 
### 
The Draft
LANTOS Totally committed to a volunteer army
what he called "a free and open draft" at a recent debate.
Lantos voted against recent legislation which would have
denied student loans to individuals who failed to register,
claiming it favored the wealthy.
ROYER Voted against President Jimmy Carter's reg
istration bill in the 96th Congress. Opposes both the draft
and registration, saying that less money could be spent by
providing an upgrade mechanism to reduce mobilization
time from 60-90 days to 7-10 days.
Nuclear Freeze
LANTOS Co-sponsored and voted for the nuclear
freeze in Congress. "The proliferation of nuclear arms is
the greatest single threat to our planet," claims a cam
paign brochure.
ROYER Supports Proposition 12, the nuclear freeze
initiative.
Balanced Budget
LANTOS Voted against both the Democratic and Re
publican proposals to balance the budget.
ROYER Supports a constitutional amendment to bal
ance the budget. "Changed county accounting practices
to zero-based budgeting, saving tax dollars," his cam
paign literature states.
Illegal Aliens
LANTOS Supports amnesty for all current illegal al
iens. Says the Simpson-Mazzoli bill needs amendments
so that we don't penalize the wrong people.

The following comparison of how 11th congressional district candidates
Tom Lantos and Bill Royer stand on controversial issues draws upon a varie
ty of sources, including interviews, printed statements from the candidates,
campaign forums and recent articles.

ROYER Calls for more dollars for border patrol and
for penalties for employers who hire illegals. "We need to
enforce the existing laws," Royer said recently adding
that he might support limited amnesty.
Gun Control
LANTOS Has not taken a stand on the issue.
ROYER Opposes Proposition 15 (Registration and
freeze on existing number of guns in California).
National Defense
LANTOS Voted to cut the B-l bombef and the MX
missile programs, which he labeled "Pentagon boondog
gles."
ROYER Supports the MX missile and B-l bomber,
but favors spreading out the Reagan 5-year buildup to 7
years.
Economy
LANTOS Says the Reagan program has "bankrupted
the economy," and calls for increased domestic spending
to put people back to work. Sees mismanagement as a
major cause of the country's current economic woes.
Voted against Reagan's tax cuts in 1981, and against tax
increases in 1982.
ROYER Supports the Reagan program of tax reduc
tions and expenditure cuts. Believes the government must
be more responsible with tax dollars.
