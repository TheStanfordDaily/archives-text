# Mondale lends support to Lantos' bid for Congress

### BILL AINSWORTH 
Hillsborough The campaign of
Rep. Tom Lantos (D-San Mateo) for
the U.S. Congress received a boost yes
terday when former Vice President
Walter Mondale, a leading contender
for the 1984 Democratic presidential
nomination, appeared on his behalf
before Lantos' top individual campaign
contributors in a posh residence here.
About 60 members of the Lantos
Capitol Club, which requires a $250
minimum contribution to join, listened
to Mondale attack the Reagan adminis
tration on all fronts and support the ef
forts of Lantos, who is running for re
election in the 11th Congressional Dis
trict against Republican Bill Royer.
"On the things that really count in
our future education, competition,
the environment, energy, the question
of nuclear arms control, a sensible de
fense, social justice in every respect
this administration is either going no
where or backward and our generation
has no right to deal with our children
and our future in that way," Mondale
said.
Mondale criticized Reagan for the in
sensitivty toward the unemployed he
said was apparent in a recent statement
made by a Reagan administration
spokesman. In the statement, according
to Mondale, a Reagan spokesman said
"sure unemployment is bad but 90 per
cent of the work force is employed."
He said,"what (the Reagan spokes
man) seemed to be saying is this: if
you've got a job don't worry about
those who don't."
"I don't consider that to be the way
this country ticks. We've made progress
more than any other country because
we're a generous people," he added.
The former vice president called the
present economic conditions "the worst
I've seen in my professional career."
Predicting that the Democrats will
gain more than 11 seats in Congress in
the upcoming election, but not more

than 40, Mondale said the Democrats'
efforts will be hampered by a disadvan
tage in fundraising. He added that spe
cial interest groups' spending favors
Republicans over Democrats by more
than five to one.
Another factor which Mondale said
will hurt the Democrats' chances in the
election are the efforts of political ac
tion committees such as the National
Conservative Political Action Commit
tee (NCPAC), because these groups
"are trying to get off the issues."
Because the Democrats have been de
ficient in fund-raising, Mondale said
they "will be lucky to hold their own in
the Senate" in the next election.
He assailed Reagan's position on nu
clear arms control. "Every effort of ev
ery president of both political parties
for over 20 years to control nuclear
arms has been opposed by Mr. Rea
gan," Mondale said.
Among these were the test ban treaty
proposed by President John Kennedy,
the SALT I and Anti-ballistic Missile
treaties negotiated by the Nixon admin-
