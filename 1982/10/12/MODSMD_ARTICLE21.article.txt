## Dead getaway in Frost 
### CHRIS KOONS 
I remember coming to visit Stanford
in the spring of 1980 for thice days, and
while I was here I saw two major con
certs on campus. I came back that fall as
a freshman, with the idea that concerts
were a part of life at Stanford. Two
and-a-half years and only one concert
later (Greg Kihn at that) I was resigned
to the fact that the powers that be had
given up on concerts at Stanford. One
could hardly fault such an attitude; the
concert series in 1979-80 was just one
money-loser after another.
When the rumours started going
.around last spring that the Chaparral
was negotiating to bring the Grateful

Dead to Frost, I was excited what
better group, what better place? But it
was sort of like being at a Stanford foot
ball game; don't bother getting your
hopes up until the last second.
But the day and the Dead finally
came, in spite of ominous headlines in
the Daily about "musicians' union"
and "Stanford picket lines" (they set
tled that one just in time). Deadheads
and other curious types from all over
the Bay Area and the country de
scended on Stanford for the first com
cert in almost three years. I was a
nervous for the Chappie and for the
future of concerts at Stanford, but
things were destined to go well con
sidering the weather, the crowd, the lo
cation and the group.

The Dead began Saturday's concert
with "Alabama Getaway," not one of
the band's better songs, and I had a feel
ing they were uncomfortable with the
crowd and setting, but when they
started in on "The Greatest Story Ever
Told," they were as Dead as ever for the
rest of the set.
The second set began with two new
songs; "Ashes, Ashes" and "I Will Sur
vive," which were the only songs played
both days. The crowd responded well to
both, especially "Ashes, Ashes," which
was reminiscent of the older rock and
roll Dead. If "Ashes, Ashes" was any
indication of their next album, it will be
a refreshing change from their mediocre
performance on the Go to Heaven
album.
Drifting out of "Space" and into

"Truckin'," the Dead had the entire
crowd (not just the regulars!) on its feet
and dancing. They Finished the set with
"The Other One," "Morning Dew,"
and a rousing rendition of "Saturday
Night." Returning for a brief encore,
they finished up with "U,S, Blues."
Sunday's performance included
"New Minglewood Blues," followed by
"Sugaree," "Little Red Rooster," and
"Tennessee fed." The second set began
with "Playin' in the Band," "Crazy Fin
gers" and "Black Peter," and the per
ennial favorite "Sugar Magnolia." All
in all, it was a day of vintage Dead.
I'm not sure what 1 like so much

about Dead concerts ma>be it's that
they don't feel a need
movies or fireworks, which in the end
only distract the crowd. They come and
ttie > r
just there for the music, I'd be disap
pointed. The Orateful Dead is not the
most musically talented band around,
but there isn't any other group with a
following as unique or intense in its de
votion. Maybe that's it; maybe it's the
uninhibited-but-harmless dancing tie
aw

most over the weekend. The day in the
sun wouldn't be the same without them.
It is hard to be critical of an anomaly
such as the Dead; they are good because
their followers think they are good.
There is no similar group to compare
them with, no standards to set them
against. Measuring them against them
selves, which is all I am left with, the
Dead, in the perfect setting of Frost
Amphitheater, were superb.

given up on concerts at Stanford. One
could hardly fault such an attitude; the
concert series in 1979-80 was just one
money-loser after another.
When the rumours started going
.around last spring that the Chaparral
was negotiating to bring the Grateful

Dead to Frost, I was excited what
better group, what better place? But it
was sort of like being at a Stanford foot
ball game; don't bother getting your
hopes up until the last second.
But the day and the Dead finally
came, in spite of ominous headlines in
the Daily about "musicians' union"
and "Stanford picket lines" (they set
tled that one just in time). Deadheads
and other curious types from all over
the Bay Area and the country de
scended on Stanford for the first com
cert in almost three years. I was a
nervous for the Chappie and for the
future of concerts at Stanford, but
things were destined to go well con
sidering the weather, the crowd, the lo
cation and the group.

The Dead began Saturday's concert
with "Alabama Getaway," not one of
the band's better songs, and I had a feel
ing they were uncomfortable with the
crowd and setting, but when they
started in on "The Greatest Story Ever
Told," they were as Dead as ever for the
rest of the set.
The second set began with two new
songs; "Ashes, Ashes" and "I Will Sur
vive," which were the only songs played
both days. The crowd responded well to
both, especially "Ashes, Ashes," which
was reminiscent of the older rock and
roll Dead. If "Ashes, Ashes" was any
indication of their next album, it will be
a refreshing change from their mediocre
performance on the Go to Heaven
album.
Drifting out of "Space" and into

"Truckin'," the Dead had the entire
crowd (not just the regulars!) on its feet
and dancing. They Finished the set with
"The Other One," "Morning Dew,"
and a rousing rendition of "Saturday
Night." Returning for a brief encore,
they finished up with "U,S, Blues."
Sunday's performance included
"New Minglewood Blues," followed by
"Sugaree," "Little Red Rooster," and
"Tennessee fed." The second set began
with "Playin' in the Band," "Crazy Fin
gers" and "Black Peter," and the per
ennial favorite "Sugar Magnolia." All
in all, it was a day of vintage Dead.
I'm not sure what 1 like so much

about Dead concerts ma>be it's that
they don't feel a need
movies or fireworks, which in the end
only distract the crowd. They come and
ttie > r
just there for the music, I'd be disap
pointed. The Orateful Dead is not the
most musically talented band around,
but there isn't any other group with a
following as unique or intense in its de
votion. Maybe that's it; maybe it's the
uninhibited-but-harmless dancing tie
aw

most over the weekend. The day in the
sun wouldn't be the same without them.
It is hard to be critical of an anomaly
such as the Dead; they are good because
their followers think they are good.
There is no similar group to compare
them with, no standards to set them
against. Measuring them against them
selves, which is all I am left with, the
Dead, in the perfect setting of Frost
Amphitheater, were superb.
