## Dead getaway in Frost 
### CHRIS KOONS 
I remember coming to visit Stanford
in the spring of 1980 for thice days, and
while I was here I saw two major con
certs on campus. I came back that fall as
a freshman, with the idea that concerts
were a part of life at Stanford. Two
and-a-half years and only one concert
later (Greg Kihn at that) I was resigned
to the fact that the powers that be had
given up on concerts at Stanford. One
could hardly fault such an attitude; the
concert series in 1979-80 was just one
money-loser after another.
When the rumours started going
.around last spring that the Chaparral
was negotiating to bring the Grateful

Dead to Frost, I was excited what
better group, what better place? But it
was sort of like being at a Stanford foot
ball game; don't bother getting your
hopes up until the last second.
But the day and the Dead finally
came, in spite of ominous headlines in
the Daily about "musicians' union"
and "Stanford picket lines" (they set
tled that one just in time). Deadheads
and other curious types from all over
the Bay Area and the country de
scended on Stanford for the first com
cert in almost three years. I was a
nervous for the Chappie and for the
future of concerts at Stanford, but
things were destined to go well con
sidering the weather, the crowd, the lo
cation and the group.
