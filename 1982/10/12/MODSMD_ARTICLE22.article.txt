# Futures, not just jobs, on display at fair
## 
### TIM GRIEVE 
Hundreds of students look
ing for jobs and career in
formation crowded White
Plaza Friday for Stanford's
Fifth annual Career Faire.
The Career Planning and
Placement Center sponsored
the event, which was intended
to be an opportunity for stu
dents and employers repre
sentatives to talk informally
about careers.
Representatives from over
70 companies, ranging from
Atari Incorporated to the Boy
Scouts of America, attended
the fair. Some of the com
panies had job openings avail
able, but many others were
there to familiarize students
with the opportunities that
will be available in the future.
Larry Britts, representing
Allstate Insurance Company,
admitted that his Firm's actual
job openings were "at a min
imum. But we're here plan
ning for the future, just as
we're sure the students are
planning for theirs."

Some companies, however,
came to the fair looking ac
tively for prospective employ
ees.
Marketing and Com
munications Manager Susan
Dahle-Fuller of Software
Publishing Corporation said
her company sent her to the
Career Faire looking for soft
ware engineers and project
managers.
"We're here looking for the
best students to give them an
opportunity to work for one
of the best Firms in the Silicon
Valley," Dahle-Fuller said.
This was Software Publish
ing Corporation's First year at
Stanford's Career Faire.
"Last year we only had eight
employees. Now we have 43.
So the opportunities in this
area are about boundless,"
she explained.

But the emphasis of the Ca
reer Faire is not just im
mediate job opportunities for
Stanford students, stressed
Deborah Duncan of the
CPPC.

Duncan said that represent
atives were encouraged to talk
about careers that may be
available "one, two or three
years down the road."
Because of the de-emphasis
on jobs, the CPPC changed
the name of the event this year
from Job Faire to Career
Faire.
But some students went to
the Career Faire Friday hop
ing to Find immediate job pos
sibilities. At least one of those
students left somewhat disap
pointed.
"I'm looking for a job for
this summer, but no one has
given me job prospects," com
plained Joe Berman, a senior
pre-med.
"Someone told me 1 could
apply for an internship, but
the market seems tight,"
Berman said.
But senior Jeff Flibbard had
a different opinion.
"It's (The Career Faire) a
helpful introduction to com
panies I might not otherwise
get a chance to see," Hibbard

said.
"I didn't come out here
looking for a job. I came out
looking to see what was avail
able," he said. "Too many
people come out looking for a
job, and I think that's the
wrong attitude to take."
In addition to the specific
company reprsentatives, gen
eral topic panels were set up
for students to find out about
careers in fields such as law,
health, advertising, en
trepreneurship and the media.
Another exhibition, this
one not planned by the CPPC,
went on during the Career
Faire. A handful of demon
strators quietly held signs and
distributed literature, mostly
protesting the presence of mil
itary suppliers, like Lockheed
Aircraft.
But the demonstrators'
signs, one reading "Nuclear
superiority means no nego
tiations Lockheed Cruise
Missile, Trident I and II,"
drew little attention from the
students and representatives.
