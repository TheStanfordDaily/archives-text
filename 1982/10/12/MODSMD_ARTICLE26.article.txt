# Dashiell would have done better â€” Hammett lacks suspense
## 
### STEVE VINEBERG 
The pre-release publicity for Ham
mett began two years ago with Tim
Hunter's long article in New West
about the turmoil the movie had gone
through since Francis Ford Coppola
bought the rights to Joe Gores' novel
six years ago. When you know that a
movie has taken more than half a dec
ade to make, that at least three
screenwriters have had a hand in it
ptoss Thomas, Denis O'Flaherty and
Thomas Pope are all listed in the cred
its), that the first director (Nicolas
Roeg) withdrew and the second (Wim
Wenders) was fired, and that some
where in the vaults of Zoetrope Studios
footage exists of Brian Keith, Ronee
Blakley and Sylvia Miles that you'll
never see in any theater (all three were
completely cut from the release print),
then the story of the struggle to put it all
together may well overshadow the final
product. Indeed, Hammett, a medium
detective thriller located in
Pnematic space somewhere between
Chinatown and Julia, turns out to be a
great deal less interesting than the mov
ie someone should make about the pro
duction of Hammett.
Apparently Wenders wanted to ex
plore the ways in which a writer trans
forms the life he sees around him into
prose. The film, set in San Francisco in
1928, is a fictitious account of the most
productive period of Dashiell Ham
mett's career, when the former
Pinkerton detective was slamming out

the novels and short stories that would
define a new, tough, existential kind of
mystery writing. Joe Gores' book, and
the movie, set up a lure to draw Ham
miett (Frederic Forrest) back into the
Pvorld of the professional gumshoe
his former mentor (now a character
named Jimmy Ryan, played by Peter
Boyle) enlists his aid in tracking down a
Chinese girl named Crystal (Lydia Lei)
who seems to link a whoremaster, a
pornographer, a wealthy suicide and a
collection of the most influential men in
the city; Hammett can't refuse. In the
process of unraveling the case, he en
counters characters who, as Hammett

readers know, will turn up in his writ
ing; the most quickly recognizable are a
jjowerful fat man named English Eddie
lhagedorn (Roy Kinnear) and his lover
(David Patrick Kelly), who of course
parallel Caspar Gutman and Wilmer in
The Maltese Falcon (Elisha Cook, who
played Wilmer in the most famous of
the three film versions of The Maltese
Falcon, shows up in a bit as a cabbie).
I'm not sure how much of the fin
ished film is actually Wenders' and how
much was shot after he left, but we see
enough of a flirtation with the old life
into-art theme to understand what must
have prompted Coppola to get rid of
him. Hammett's typewriter overlays
other images or is cut in between loca
tion shots; the seductive click of keys
provides a kind of background music;

other characters ask Hammett point
edly whether he's a writer or a detective.
Although Frederic Forrest gives an
amiable performance, and is the only
actor in the picture to suggest both
depth and style, no one seems to have
been much concerned with developing
his character so that the idea he repre
sents might have some edge; tepid and
passive, this Hammett may be the only
title character ever conceived as an af
terthought. His relationship with Kit
(Marilu Henner), a sort-of girl friend
who inspires the heroines of his stories,
is an unexplained given of the movie;
one can imagine the poor actress pacing
the set, trying to figure out how the hell
to play a woman who is less a woman
than a notion, and not even a whole no
tion.
Hammett lacks suspense any kind
of momentum, really but it certainly
looks impressive: the photography (by
Philip Lathrop and Joseph Biroc) and
the production design (by Dean
Tavoularis) have the garish, baroque
flavor of old San Francisco or rather,
old San Francisco as only Hollywood
could render it. Was Wenders too over
whelmed by the glamor of directing a
big-budget American picture to realize
how all this extravagance would under
cut his precious concept? Whenever Pe
ter Boyle or Marilu Henner tells Ham
mett that real life isn't like his stories,
you want to laugh not because you
can see that Hammett is using real life as
fuel for his fiction (the irony we're in-

tended to appreciate) but because no
one's life looks as gorgeous as this. The
Chinatown scenes, with teenage whores
languishing in opium den-cathouses,
are too elaborately designed and shot
with too self-conscious an eye for film
noir excesses to be shocking or upset
ting; they have as little to do with reality
as the great "Shanghai Lil" number in
Busby Berkeley's Footlight Parade,
which had a similar setting. In the entire
film, I saw only one image with any res
onance: in the twilight, as he is climbing
the stairs to his apartment, Hammett
sees a child, bundled up in an overcoat
that makes him appear like a middle
aged midget, his face solemn and a fin
ger pressed to his lips. He is, we learn,
playing hide and seek; two other chil
dren lurk about the yard, also intensely
engrossed in their game and also per
fectly still and silent. Tied in with what
we have seen of some of the whores in
Chinatown, virtual children them
selves, and with the plot about corrupt
millionaires with a predilection for
child pornography, this scene has un
usual power, and it suggests the direc
tion in which the whole sad, sagging
movie might have gone.

Rainer Werner Fassbinder's Lola is a
clever allegory about postwar Germa
ny, in which the most important men in
town run or frequent a nightclub
brothel; and, inevitably, the voice of re

spectability, the progressive new build
ing commissioner (Mario Adorf), allies
himself with the most scandalous of the
prostitutes (Lola, played by Barbara
Sukowa), and, by implication, with all
that is corrupt. The presentational act
ing style emphasizes the performance
nature of the characters, a crew of hyp
ocrites (and Adorf employs a realistic
approach to his role in some scenes,
creating a tension between his public
mask and his private sincerity), and so
does the theatrical lighting, which
Fassbinder does not restrict to the club
scenes. Fassbinder has worked ev
erything out in visual terms (the walls of
the conference room where the building
commission meets have holes gouged in
them, etc.), and he and his co-writers,
Peter Marthesheimer and Pea Frohlich,
have accounted for every plot detail;
even the title extends his point. (Lola
was also the heroine of Von Sternberg's
The Blue Angel, an earlier study of the
corruption of respectability set in an
earlier period of moral decay in Germa
ny Weimar.) But despite all the care
and intelligence that have gone into

making Lola, you may grow impatient
with it if, like me, you want something
more out of a movie like a little hu
manity or a few spontaneous moments.
Lola isn't inventive enough to get away
with being so schematic: the idea of a
whorehouse attended by every major
figure in town is out of Jean Genet's The
Balcony, and the image of the bearded,
cigar-smoking industrialist who tries to
buy everyone he meets goes all the way
back to the heyday of the German Ex
pressionists. Besides, the political
iconography is familiar from other
Fassbinder pictures, notably The Mar
riage of Maria Braun. AdorFs acting is
often admirable, and there's a lovely
scene in which he and Barbara Sukowa
sing a hymn together, in canon, as they
stand at the back of an empty church;
otherwise, you don't come away from
the film with anything.

Wayne Wang's first feature Chan Is
Missing has received charitable reviews
from critics who either haven't noticed
or have pretended not to notice that the

camera is always in the wrong place, the
editing is haphazard, the sound rec
ording is occasionally opaque and the
lighting is so poor that in some shots
sunlight streaming through a window
whites out the actors. Is it a virtue to
make a movie this badly on less than
$20,000? Perhaps they were carried
away by the Chinese flavor of the mys
tery, though the seductive riddling na
ture of the film (the whereabouts of
Chan are never discovered, but we're
lectured about the presence of absence
and the use of negatives to emphasize
the positive) doesn't stray very far from
that of the puzzle pictures Antonioni
and others released in the '6os. It's an
intellectual mystery (the only violence
in it is performed by Wang's camera on
actors' heads, shoulders, arms and legs)
played in an improvised style that fails
miserably because the actors with the
exception of Marc Hayashi, in the role
of Steve, a cab driver so assimilated into
an American lifestyle that he sounds
like a Chinese Richard Pryor aren't
good enough and Wang doesn't know
how to keep their energy going. The ti

tie has fascinating politico-cultural im
plications about the discrepancy be
tween our vision of Chinese-Ameri
cans, based on the role they have played
in movies and radio and TV (an allusion
to Charlie Chan?) and the way in which
they see themselves, but the movie
doesn't explore that avenue, at least not
comprehensibly. The only thing I liked
about it, besides Marc Hayashi, was the
opening sequence, in which Jo (Wood
Moy), Steve's older partner and the
man who eventually tries to track down
the elusive Chan, drives his cab through
San Francisco's Chinatown, the re
flection of skyscrapers sliding up his
windshield like curtains rising on a pro
scenium arch stage set, while a Chinese
version of "Rock Around the Clock"
plays on the soundtrack. Wang keeps
returning to this image, however, until
it has lost its magic. Chan Is Missing is a
terribly frustrating experience: after
you've struggled for 90 minutes just to
see the characters' faces, to hear their
words and to follow the plot, you feel
that you're entitled at least to an end
ing.

1928, is a fictitious account of the most
productive period of Dashiell Ham
mett's career, when the former
Pinkerton detective was slamming out

the novels and short stories that would
define a new, tough, existential kind of
mystery writing. Joe Gores' book, and
the movie, set up a lure to draw Ham
miett (Frederic Forrest) back into the
Pvorld of the professional gumshoe
his former mentor (now a character
named Jimmy Ryan, played by Peter
Boyle) enlists his aid in tracking down a
Chinese girl named Crystal (Lydia Lei)
who seems to link a whoremaster, a
pornographer, a wealthy suicide and a
collection of the most influential men in
the city; Hammett can't refuse. In the
process of unraveling the case, he en
counters characters who, as Hammett

readers know, will turn up in his writ
ing; the most quickly recognizable are a
jjowerful fat man named English Eddie
lhagedorn (Roy Kinnear) and his lover
(David Patrick Kelly), who of course
parallel Caspar Gutman and Wilmer in
The Maltese Falcon (Elisha Cook, who
played Wilmer in the most famous of
the three film versions of The Maltese
Falcon, shows up in a bit as a cabbie).
I'm not sure how much of the fin
ished film is actually Wenders' and how
much was shot after he left, but we see
enough of a flirtation with the old life
into-art theme to understand what must
have prompted Coppola to get rid of
him. Hammett's typewriter overlays
other images or is cut in between loca
tion shots; the seductive click of keys
provides a kind of background music;

other characters ask Hammett point
edly whether he's a writer or a detective.
Although Frederic Forrest gives an
amiable performance, and is the only
actor in the picture to suggest both
depth and style, no one seems to have
been much concerned with developing
his character so that the idea he repre
sents might have some edge; tepid and
passive, this Hammett may be the only
title character ever conceived as an af
terthought. His relationship with Kit
(Marilu Henner), a sort-of girl friend
who inspires the heroines of his stories,
is an unexplained given of the movie;
one can imagine the poor actress pacing
the set, trying to figure out how the hell
to play a woman who is less a woman
than a notion, and not even a whole no
tion.
Hammett lacks suspense any kind
of momentum, really but it certainly
looks impressive: the photography (by
Philip Lathrop and Joseph Biroc) and
the production design (by Dean
Tavoularis) have the garish, baroque
flavor of old San Francisco or rather,
old San Francisco as only Hollywood
could render it. Was Wenders too over
whelmed by the glamor of directing a
big-budget American picture to realize
how all this extravagance would under
cut his precious concept? Whenever Pe
ter Boyle or Marilu Henner tells Ham
mett that real life isn't like his stories,
you want to laugh not because you
can see that Hammett is using real life as
fuel for his fiction (the irony we're in-

tended to appreciate) but because no
one's life looks as gorgeous as this. The
Chinatown scenes, with teenage whores
languishing in opium den-cathouses,
are too elaborately designed and shot
with too self-conscious an eye for film
noir excesses to be shocking or upset
ting; they have as little to do with reality
as the great "Shanghai Lil" number in
Busby Berkeley's Footlight Parade,
which had a similar setting. In the entire
film, I saw only one image with any res
onance: in the twilight, as he is climbing
the stairs to his apartment, Hammett
sees a child, bundled up in an overcoat
that makes him appear like a middle
aged midget, his face solemn and a fin
ger pressed to his lips. He is, we learn,
playing hide and seek; two other chil
dren lurk about the yard, also intensely
engrossed in their game and also per
fectly still and silent. Tied in with what
we have seen of some of the whores in
Chinatown, virtual children them
selves, and with the plot about corrupt
millionaires with a predilection for
child pornography, this scene has un
usual power, and it suggests the direc
tion in which the whole sad, sagging
movie might have gone.

Rainer Werner Fassbinder's Lola is a
clever allegory about postwar Germa
ny, in which the most important men in
town run or frequent a nightclub
brothel; and, inevitably, the voice of re

spectability, the progressive new build
ing commissioner (Mario Adorf), allies
himself with the most scandalous of the
prostitutes (Lola, played by Barbara
Sukowa), and, by implication, with all
that is corrupt. The presentational act
ing style emphasizes the performance
nature of the characters, a crew of hyp
ocrites (and Adorf employs a realistic
approach to his role in some scenes,
creating a tension between his public
mask and his private sincerity), and so
does the theatrical lighting, which
Fassbinder does not restrict to the club
scenes. Fassbinder has worked ev
erything out in visual terms (the walls of
the conference room where the building
commission meets have holes gouged in
them, etc.), and he and his co-writers,
Peter Marthesheimer and Pea Frohlich,
have accounted for every plot detail;
even the title extends his point. (Lola
was also the heroine of Von Sternberg's
The Blue Angel, an earlier study of the
corruption of respectability set in an
earlier period of moral decay in Germa
ny Weimar.) But despite all the care
and intelligence that have gone into

making Lola, you may grow impatient
with it if, like me, you want something
more out of a movie like a little hu
manity or a few spontaneous moments.
Lola isn't inventive enough to get away
with being so schematic: the idea of a
whorehouse attended by every major
figure in town is out of Jean Genet's The
Balcony, and the image of the bearded,
cigar-smoking industrialist who tries to
buy everyone he meets goes all the way
back to the heyday of the German Ex
pressionists. Besides, the political
iconography is familiar from other
Fassbinder pictures, notably The Mar
riage of Maria Braun. AdorFs acting is
often admirable, and there's a lovely
scene in which he and Barbara Sukowa
sing a hymn together, in canon, as they
stand at the back of an empty church;
otherwise, you don't come away from
the film with anything.

Wayne Wang's first feature Chan Is
Missing has received charitable reviews
from critics who either haven't noticed
or have pretended not to notice that the

camera is always in the wrong place, the
editing is haphazard, the sound rec
ording is occasionally opaque and the
lighting is so poor that in some shots
sunlight streaming through a window
whites out the actors. Is it a virtue to
make a movie this badly on less than
$20,000? Perhaps they were carried
away by the Chinese flavor of the mys
tery, though the seductive riddling na
ture of the film (the whereabouts of
Chan are never discovered, but we're
lectured about the presence of absence
and the use of negatives to emphasize
the positive) doesn't stray very far from
that of the puzzle pictures Antonioni
and others released in the '6os. It's an
intellectual mystery (the only violence
in it is performed by Wang's camera on
actors' heads, shoulders, arms and legs)
played in an improvised style that fails
miserably because the actors with the
exception of Marc Hayashi, in the role
of Steve, a cab driver so assimilated into
an American lifestyle that he sounds
like a Chinese Richard Pryor aren't
good enough and Wang doesn't know
how to keep their energy going. The ti

tie has fascinating politico-cultural im
plications about the discrepancy be
tween our vision of Chinese-Ameri
cans, based on the role they have played
in movies and radio and TV (an allusion
to Charlie Chan?) and the way in which
they see themselves, but the movie
doesn't explore that avenue, at least not
comprehensibly. The only thing I liked
about it, besides Marc Hayashi, was the
opening sequence, in which Jo (Wood
Moy), Steve's older partner and the
man who eventually tries to track down
the elusive Chan, drives his cab through
San Francisco's Chinatown, the re
flection of skyscrapers sliding up his
windshield like curtains rising on a pro
scenium arch stage set, while a Chinese
version of "Rock Around the Clock"
plays on the soundtrack. Wang keeps
returning to this image, however, until
it has lost its magic. Chan Is Missing is a
terribly frustrating experience: after
you've struggled for 90 minutes just to
see the characters' faces, to hear their
words and to follow the plot, you feel
that you're entitled at least to an end
ing.


The pre-release publicity for Ham
mett began two years ago with Tim
Hunter's long article in New West
about the turmoil the movie had gone
through since Francis Ford Coppola
bought the rights to Joe Gores' novel
six years ago. When you know that a
movie has taken more than half a dec
ade to make, that at least three
screenwriters have had a hand in it
ptoss Thomas, Denis O'Flaherty and
Thomas Pope are all listed in the cred
its), that the first director (Nicolas
Roeg) withdrew and the second (Wim
Wenders) was fired, and that some
where in the vaults of Zoetrope Studios
footage exists of Brian Keith, Ronee
Blakley and Sylvia Miles that you'll
never see in any theater (all three were
completely cut from the release print),
then the story of the struggle to put it all
together may well overshadow the final
product. Indeed, Hammett, a medium
detective thriller located in
Pnematic space somewhere between
Chinatown and Julia, turns out to be a
great deal less interesting than the mov
ie someone should make about the pro
duction of Hammett.

ished film is actually Wenders' and how
much was shot after he left, but we see
enough of a flirtation with the old life
into-art theme to understand what must
have prompted Coppola to get rid of
him. Hammett's typewriter overlays
other images or is cut in between loca
tion shots; the seductive click of keys
provides a kind of background music;

other characters ask Hammett point
edly whether he's a writer or a detective.
Although Frederic Forrest gives an
amiable performance, and is the only
actor in the picture to suggest both
depth and style, no one seems to have
been much concerned with developing
his character so that the idea he repre
sents might have some edge; tepid and
passive, this Hammett may be the only
title character ever conceived as an af
terthought. His relationship with Kit
(Marilu Henner), a sort-of girl friend
who inspires the heroines of his stories,
is an unexplained given of the movie;
one can imagine the poor actress pacing
the set, trying to figure out how the hell
to play a woman who is less a woman
than a notion, and not even a whole no
tion.
Hammett lacks suspense any kind
of momentum, really but it certainly
looks impressive: the photography (by
Philip Lathrop and Joseph Biroc) and
the production design (by Dean
Tavoularis) have the garish, baroque
flavor of old San Francisco or rather,
old San Francisco as only Hollywood
could render it. Was Wenders too over
whelmed by the glamor of directing a
big-budget American picture to realize
how all this extravagance would under
cut his precious concept? Whenever Pe
ter Boyle or Marilu Henner tells Ham
mett that real life isn't like his stories,
you want to laugh not because you
can see that Hammett is using real life as
fuel for his fiction (the irony we're in-

tended to appreciate) but because no
one's life looks as gorgeous as this. The
Chinatown scenes, with teenage whores
languishing in opium den-cathouses,
are too elaborately designed and shot
with too self-conscious an eye for film
noir excesses to be shocking or upset
ting; they have as little to do with reality
as the great "Shanghai Lil" number in
Busby Berkeley's Footlight Parade,
which had a similar setting. In the entire
film, I saw only one image with any res
onance: in the twilight, as he is climbing
the stairs to his apartment, Hammett
sees a child, bundled up in an overcoat
that makes him appear like a middle
aged midget, his face solemn and a fin
ger pressed to his lips. He is, we learn,
playing hide and seek; two other chil
dren lurk about the yard, also intensely
engrossed in their game and also per
fectly still and silent. Tied in with what
we have seen of some of the whores in
Chinatown, virtual children them
selves, and with the plot about corrupt
millionaires with a predilection for
child pornography, this scene has un
usual power, and it suggests the direc
tion in which the whole sad, sagging
movie might have gone.

Rainer Werner Fassbinder's Lola is a
clever allegory about postwar Germa
ny, in which the most important men in
town run or frequent a nightclub
brothel; and, inevitably, the voice of re

spectability, the progressive new build
ing commissioner (Mario Adorf), allies
himself with the most scandalous of the
prostitutes (Lola, played by Barbara
Sukowa), and, by implication, with all
that is corrupt. The presentational act
ing style emphasizes the performance
nature of the characters, a crew of hyp
ocrites (and Adorf employs a realistic
approach to his role in some scenes,
creating a tension between his public
mask and his private sincerity), and so
does the theatrical lighting, which
Fassbinder does not restrict to the club
scenes. Fassbinder has worked ev
erything out in visual terms (the walls of
the conference room where the building
commission meets have holes gouged in
them, etc.), and he and his co-writers,
Peter Marthesheimer and Pea Frohlich,
have accounted for every plot detail;
even the title extends his point. (Lola
was also the heroine of Von Sternberg's
The Blue Angel, an earlier study of the
corruption of respectability set in an
earlier period of moral decay in Germa
ny Weimar.) But despite all the care
and intelligence that have gone into

making Lola, you may grow impatient
with it if, like me, you want something
more out of a movie like a little hu
manity or a few spontaneous moments.
Lola isn't inventive enough to get away
with being so schematic: the idea of a
whorehouse attended by every major
figure in town is out of Jean Genet's The
Balcony, and the image of the bearded,
cigar-smoking industrialist who tries to
buy everyone he meets goes all the way
back to the heyday of the German Ex
pressionists. Besides, the political
iconography is familiar from other
Fassbinder pictures, notably The Mar
riage of Maria Braun. AdorFs acting is
often admirable, and there's a lovely
scene in which he and Barbara Sukowa
sing a hymn together, in canon, as they
stand at the back of an empty church;
otherwise, you don't come away from
the film with anything.

Wayne Wang's first feature Chan Is
Missing has received charitable reviews
from critics who either haven't noticed
or have pretended not to notice that the

camera is always in the wrong place, the
editing is haphazard, the sound rec
ording is occasionally opaque and the
lighting is so poor that in some shots
sunlight streaming through a window
whites out the actors. Is it a virtue to
make a movie this badly on less than
$20,000? Perhaps they were carried
away by the Chinese flavor of the mys
tery, though the seductive riddling na
ture of the film (the whereabouts of
Chan are never discovered, but we're
lectured about the presence of absence
and the use of negatives to emphasize
the positive) doesn't stray very far from
that of the puzzle pictures Antonioni
and others released in the '6os. It's an
intellectual mystery (the only violence
in it is performed by Wang's camera on
actors' heads, shoulders, arms and legs)
played in an improvised style that fails
miserably because the actors with the
exception of Marc Hayashi, in the role
of Steve, a cab driver so assimilated into
an American lifestyle that he sounds
like a Chinese Richard Pryor aren't
good enough and Wang doesn't know
how to keep their energy going. The ti

tie has fascinating politico-cultural im
plications about the discrepancy be
tween our vision of Chinese-Ameri
cans, based on the role they have played
in movies and radio and TV (an allusion
to Charlie Chan?) and the way in which
they see themselves, but the movie
doesn't explore that avenue, at least not
comprehensibly. The only thing I liked
about it, besides Marc Hayashi, was the
opening sequence, in which Jo (Wood
Moy), Steve's older partner and the
man who eventually tries to track down
the elusive Chan, drives his cab through
San Francisco's Chinatown, the re
flection of skyscrapers sliding up his
windshield like curtains rising on a pro
scenium arch stage set, while a Chinese
version of "Rock Around the Clock"
plays on the soundtrack. Wang keeps
returning to this image, however, until
it has lost its magic. Chan Is Missing is a
terribly frustrating experience: after
you've struggled for 90 minutes just to
see the characters' faces, to hear their
words and to follow the plot, you feel
that you're entitled at least to an end
ing.


The pre-release publicity for Ham
mett began two years ago with Tim
Hunter's long article in New West
about the turmoil the movie had gone
through since Francis Ford Coppola
bought the rights to Joe Gores' novel
six years ago. When you know that a
movie has taken more than half a dec
ade to make, that at least three
screenwriters have had a hand in it
ptoss Thomas, Denis O'Flaherty and
Thomas Pope are all listed in the cred
its), that the first director (Nicolas
Roeg) withdrew and the second (Wim
Wenders) was fired, and that some
where in the vaults of Zoetrope Studios
footage exists of Brian Keith, Ronee
Blakley and Sylvia Miles that you'll
never see in any theater (all three were
completely cut from the release print),
then the story of the struggle to put it all
together may well overshadow the final
product. Indeed, Hammett, a medium
detective thriller located in
Pnematic space somewhere between
Chinatown and Julia, turns out to be a
great deal less interesting than the mov
ie someone should make about the pro
duction of Hammett.
Apparently Wenders wanted to ex
plore the ways in which a writer trans
forms the life he sees around him into
prose. The film, set in San Francisco in
1928, is a fictitious account of the most
productive period of Dashiell Ham
mett's career, when the former
Pinkerton detective was slamming out

the novels and short stories that would
define a new, tough, existential kind of
mystery writing. Joe Gores' book, and
the movie, set up a lure to draw Ham
miett (Frederic Forrest) back into the
Pvorld of the professional gumshoe
his former mentor (now a character
named Jimmy Ryan, played by Peter
Boyle) enlists his aid in tracking down a
Chinese girl named Crystal (Lydia Lei)
who seems to link a whoremaster, a
pornographer, a wealthy suicide and a
collection of the most influential men in
the city; Hammett can't refuse. In the
process of unraveling the case, he en
counters characters who, as Hammett

readers know, will turn up in his writ
ing; the most quickly recognizable are a
jjowerful fat man named English Eddie
lhagedorn (Roy Kinnear) and his lover
(David Patrick Kelly), who of course
parallel Caspar Gutman and Wilmer in
The Maltese Falcon (Elisha Cook, who
played Wilmer in the most famous of
the three film versions of The Maltese
Falcon, shows up in a bit as a cabbie).
I'm not sure how much of the fin
