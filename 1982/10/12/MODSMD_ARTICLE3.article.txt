# McCloskey era coming to a close
## Lantos and Royer running neck and neck as elections loom ahead 
### KEVIN GROSS 
For more than 15 years, Stanford has been
represented in the U.S. House of Represent
atives by Paul "Pete" McCloskey. Yet, what
one University administrator calls a "superb re
lationship" between the University and Mc-
Closkey is about to end.
Thanks to the gerrymandered reapportion
ment plan presented by Rep. Phil Burton (D-
San Francisco), Stanford will now fall into the
11th Congressional District, currently repre
sented by Rep. Tom Lantos (D-San Mateo).
Lantos, meanwhile, is in a tough race with Re
publican Bill Royer (whom Lantos ousted from
the seat in 1980 by a mere 5723 votes) and the
outcome is far from certain.
The race has attracted national attention, as
conservative PACs (political action commit
tees) seek to unseat incumbent Lantos. At the
same time, Lantos is receiving heavy financial
contributions from Eastern liberals and other
out-of-state sources.
McCloskey first won his seat in the House by
upsetting the former child movie star, Shirley
Temple Black, in a special election in 1967. He
has always been known for his unorthodox
style; his first platform, for example, included a
pro-environmentalist position and his opposi
tion to the Vietnam War. Since that time, the
maverick Republican has made many con
troversial moves: he ran against President Rich
ard Nixon in the 1972 Republican presidential
primaries; a few months ago, he visited Leba
non and met with PLO leader Yasser Arafat, re
articulating his belief that Palestinians need a

'homeland' on the West Bank and Gaza, a posi
tion which does not endear him to American
Jews.
Earlier this year, McCloskey was quoted as
saying, "Most of my colleagues are unwilling to
take on the most powerful lobby in the United
States," referring to the American-Israel Public
Affairs Committee.

But then McCloskey has never shied away
from controversial stands and issues. He sup
ports cuts in Social Security benefits, reduction
in U.S. aid to El Salvador and gun control. He
also backs a proposed U.S.-Soviet nuclear
freeze, and yet he would reinstitue a modified
version of the draft.
Not surprisingly, McCloskey has been re
sponsive to the needs of the Stanford communi

ty. Many students say they admire the con
gressman for his frank and open style and for
his willingness to confront and discuss issues.
At the same time, McCloskey's relationship
with the University administration has been a
good one. According to Larry Horton, director
of government relations, "Pete was a loyal
alumnus. He has helped us in many ways and
responded to our requests for help on many oc
casions."
University President Donald Kennedy also
commented that McCloskey has been very re
sponsive to the University's concerns. He re
called one dispute with the National Institute of
Health (NIH): the NIH wanted to reduce in
direct cost payments on research projects.
These payments help to reimburse universities
for administrative costs, maintenance and other
indirect costs associated with research pro
grams. McCloskey went to the White House
and spoke with President Jimmy Carter, who
eventually overruled NIH bureaucrats on the
issue.
In another recent battle, McCloskey led,
albeit unsuccessfully, the opposition to the
Small Business Innovation Act, which sets aside
3 percent of all government research funds for
small business, thus depriving universities of
millions of research dollars.
This is in contrast to Lantos, who originally
co-sponsored the act, but later backtracked and
voted against it.
Fifty-four-year-old Lantos was born in Hun
gary in 1928. He fought the Nazis in World War
II and emigrated to the United States in 1947.

He received his Ph.D. in Economics from UC-
Berkeley in 1953, and has since served as a pro
fessor and business consultant until his election
to Congress in 1980.
His opponent, Royer, is a home-grown, Pen
insula product. He attended the University of
Santa Clara, majored in business adminis
tration and then served in the U.S. Army Air
Corps from 1943-45. Royer formerly ran a real
estate firm and served as a Redwood City
Councilman for 16 years. He was also a San
Mateo County Supervisor for seven years,
before he became a congressman by winning a

special election in 1979.
McCloskey has endorsed Royer, citing his in
tegrity. To be sure, Royer and McCloskey agree
on many economic issues, including the need
for a balanced budget. Yet they disagree on the
draft, gun control and several foreign policy is
sues.
The Daily asked Kennedy what he felt were
the most important congressional issues to be
faced by the campaign's victor. He immediately
cited funding for research projects and student
financial aid. "The budget process, year in and
