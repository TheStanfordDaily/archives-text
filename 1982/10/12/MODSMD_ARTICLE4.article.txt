Europeans win Nobel for prostaglandin studies

Stockholm Two Swedes and an Englishman yesterday won the 1982
Nobel Prize in medicine for their pioneering studies of potent natural
hormones that affect virtually every system in the human body, from fertility
to circulation of the blood.
Drs. Sune Bergstroem and Bengt Samuelsson, both of the Karolinska In
stitute in Stockholm, which helps award the prestigious prize, and Dr. John
Vane, of the British Wellcome Research Foundation Ltd., will share the
$157,000 prize, the first of the Nobel awards to be announced this year.
Karolinska Institute faculty members assist in selection of prize winners.
Bergstroem, who has long been considered a contender for the medicine
prize, is chairman of the board of directors of the Nobel Foundation, which
administers the award.
The three were cited for their discoveries concerning "prostaglandins and
related biologically active substances," which are locally produced chemical
messengers that function to defend cells against sudden changes caused by
stress, trauma or disease.
The substances, which are named after their original discovery in the pro
state gland, can have both positive and negative effects on the body.
The natural and synthetically produced prostaglandins and drugs that
counteract their effects have a wide range of present and potential uses in
medical treatment, in addition to the basic research leads offered by the dis-
covery of a new biological system.
Experts say that future prostaglandin research may
provide new avenues for treating the allergies that bother
so many people, as well as a possible means for prevent- >
ing heart attacks.
The Nobel committee noted that these chemicals are
already used in obstetrics and gynecology, serving to in
duce both abortion and childbirth. The prostaglandins
have also been used in the treatment of patients with
circulatory system disturbances and peptic ulcers.
Compounds that inhibit the action of prostaglandins
relieve pain caused by menstruation, gallstones and
kidney stones.
Vane, 55, was cited for his "fundamental" discovery a
decade ago that aspirin, one of the most common medica
tions for treating pain and inflammation, acts by block
ing the formation of prostaglandins and related
chemicals. He is a former University of London professor
who now directs group research and development at the
pharmaceutical foundation.
Yesterday's award to three non-American scientists
represented a break in the longstanding dominance of the
world's most prestigious medical prize by the United
States.
Fighting follows Polish union's ban
Gdansk, Poland Thousands of shipyard workers
staged an eight-hour strike yesterday to protest the dis
solution by parliament last week of the Solidarity inde
pendent trade union.
The strike was followed by four hours of street fighting
as special police armed with tear gas and water cannon
attempted to disperse workers and Solidarity supporters
who had gathered outside the gates of the giant Lenin
shipyard.
Police roadblocks were set up around the city and
many motorists were turned away.
Meanwhile, the official news agency PAP announced
the release of 308 people interned under martial law regu
lations, fulfilling a pledge by military ruler Gen. Wo
jciech Jaruzelski last Saturday that a substantial number
of those held, estimated to total more than 800, would be
freed.
The strike in Gdansk, the biggest the Baltic coast city
has seen since the early days of martial law, marked a sig
nificant change of tactics by the union. Until now most
protests against the martial law government here have
taken the form of short symbolic strikes or mass street de
mostrations.
The city, the birthplace of Solidarity, was quiet last
night, but many workers insisted that they would stage a
similar strike today.
Telephone and telex links with Gdansk were cut soon
after the strike began at 6 a.m. when the first shift re
ported for work at the shipyard.
Workers said that rather than wait for riot police to
storm the factories, they would leave at the end of the
shift and return every day.
Yesterday's strikes began after leaflets were distributed
in Gdansk signed by underground Solidarity leaders,
calling on workers to defend the union. A worker at the
Lenin shipyard said that the protest there had erupted
shortly after the start of the first shift.
The strikers at the Lenin shipyard were joined by work
ers in the neighboring repair shop yard and the northern
shipyard. Workers in several smaller enterprises also
joined in as did did workers at the Paris Commune ship
yard in nearby Gdynia.
The gates of the Lenin shipyard, from which Lech
Walesa addressed the striking workers in August 1980,
were once again festooned with flowers, Solidarity ban
ners and portraits of Pope John Paul 11. Slogans pasted to
the wall of the shipyard read, "Solidarity is still alive,"
and "We won't let Solidarity die."
Dow tops 1000 as rates fall
New York Stock prices soared yesterday for the
fourth straight session in near-record trading as the Dow
Jones industrial average pierced the 1000-point mark for
the first time in 15 months amid growing belief interest
rates will keep falling.
"The stock market is responding to the same factors
that eventually will cause an economic recovery more
available and cheaper money," said Michael Metz, vice
president of Oppenheimer & Co.
Five stocks rose for every one that fell on the New
York Stock Exchange.
The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials, which rose 79
points last week, surged another 25.94 to 1012.79 its
highest since it finished at 1016.93 on April 28,1981. The
last time the closely watched measure closed above 1000
was June 23, 1981, when it stood at 1006.66. The average
has risen about 236 points in two months.
Trading volume also kept up its fierce pace. Some
138.53 million shares changed hands on the New York
Stock Exchange, the second-highest one-day total behind
the 147.07 million shares traded last Thursday. It was the
third straight session in which volume surpassed 100 mil

lion shares and the 10th time since Aug. 18, which was the
first day volume ever exceeded 100 million shares.
The market, which often reacts to expectations, has
been rallying despite news showing the economy re
mained weak last month, such as the 10.1 percent un
employment rate reported Friday.
"You can't fight the tape; we're in a bull market," said
Alan Poole, vice president of Laidlaw, Adams & Peck
Inc.
The big factor cited for Wall Street's euphoria is in
vestors' perception that interest rates will keep falling and
spark recovery. With money costing less, consumers
should be encouraged to spend more especially on ex
pensive items requiring credit.
That would allow retailers to order more goods, spur
ring manufacturers to increase production and perhaps
hire back workers.
Also, investors and many market analysts are con
vinced that the decline in the inflation rate is not a fluke.
The Mellon Bank of Pittsburgh has cut its prime to
12.75 percent from 13.5 percent and many other big
banks now have 13 percent rates.
$2OO billion deficit projected for 1984
Washington The Reagan administration has begun
work on the 1984 budget with some internal projections
suggesting the deficit could be nearly $2OO billion in that
fiscal year if there are no further tax increases or spending
cuts.
That is far beyond the $B4 billion that Congress esti
mated for 1984 in the budget resolution approved last
spring, and would exceed even the $152 billion projected
just last month by the Congressional Budget Office.
The $2OO billion figure is not what the president will
propose. Rather, it is a measure of how large a problem
he will face as he works in the next few months to bring
down the deficit down to acceptable levels.
For political reasons, presidential aides have tried to
defer budget talk until after the Nov. 2 election. And
none of the major shaping decisions has yet been made;
the budget, which is for the year beginning next Oct. 1,
does not have to be sent to Congress until early next year.
The deficit estimates are starting points for the budget
process; they are guesses as to what the deficit would be
without any changes in current policy or law.
They assume the president will not flinch from his pres
ently planned defense buildup; he has indicated as much,
even though Congress, in the spring budget resolution,
called for some curtailment.
They also are based on the assumption that there will
be no tax increase. On the contrary, they assume that the
sizable tax cuts already voted by Congress for 1983 and
beyond will be allowed to take effect as planned. The
largest of these involves the so-called indexation of the in
dividual income tax beginning in 1985 to offset the tax ef
fects of inflation. Without indexation, many people auto
matically move into higher tax brackets each year as their
incomes rise.
The president, who was raked by conservatives for sup
porting this year's tax increase, was asked at his news
conference last month whether he would "flatly rule out
any tax increases" in 1984. "Unless there's a palace coup
and I'm overtaken or overthrown, no, I don't see the ne
cessity for that," he answered.
The deficit estimates further assume that the economy
will not improve dramatically by fiscal 1984, but will stay
on the slow-growth path the administration itself has of
ficially projected. Last year an optimistic economic fore
cast helped the president bring down the projected deficit
at budget time. This year he has a new chairman of the
Council of Economic Advisers, Martin Feldstein, who is
already on record as foreseeing only slow-to-moderate
growth, and who is regarded as most unlikely to let his
forecast be altered for political purposes.
Lebanese army searches camps
Beirut, Lebanon In a move that sent new tremors of
fear through the Palestinian refugee camps where hun
dreds of civilians were massacred by Christian militiamen
less than a month ago, the Lebanese army yesterday
sealed off and searched the camps house by house.
The sweep of the tense camps was the latest step in a
citv-wide operation aimed at uncovering hidden arms de
pots and arresting criminals and illegal aliens, which has
been going on now for days.
Lebanese security sources have reported the detention
of more than 500 persons, but other, unofficial, sources
put the total at more than a 1000. Some have been re
leased after an identity check and others deported. But
hundreds are still being held, among whom are reported
to be many Palestinians.

The arrest of Palestinians, in some cases by armed civil
ians identifying themselves as Lebanese security men, has
stirred fears throughouc the Palestinian community of a
second wave of persecution by the authorities. The gov
ernment has already made clear that it wants the vast ma
jority of the estimated 500,000 Palestinians in Lebanon to
leave as soon as possible.
The anxiety gripping the Palestinian camps of Sabra
and Shatila was clearly evident during a visit there yester
day. Armored cars and soldiers of the Lebanese Army

were everywhere, and at mid-morning an officer standing
in a Jeep was shouting through a bullhorn for everyone to
stay at home.
A group of angry Palestinian women asked to speak to
several French soldiers and United Nations observers
standing nearby: They said their husbands and sons had
been taken away earlier in the day, even though they were
1948 refugees with papers allowing them to live in Leba
non.
Both a French officer and a U.N. observer said there
was nothing they could do because it was "an internal
matter involving the Lebanese army and security in the
city.
One woman was nearly hysterical and shouted at the
soldiers and whoever else would listen, "I have no lights,
no water, no electricity, and now they come and take my
son and husband. Who is going to feed me?"
Before she could say more, a soldier pushed the group
away with the side of his gun and told them all to go
home. Photographers and television teams were banned
from the camps yesterday, apparently because of army
fears of just such scenes.
It was not known how many had been arrested in yes
terday's sweep of the camps, which have already been the
scene of intensive hunts for wanted persons by the Leba
nese Army and other security authorities.
Various persons interviewed, including a French of
ficer, told of seeing between 60 and 100 Palestinian men
taken away early in the morning in one part of Sabra
camp.
Tudor ship raised off English coast
Portsmouth, England After 437 years on the ocean
floor, the hull of the Mary Rose, flagship of King Henry
VIII's navy, was raised to the surface yesterday, capping
one of the greatest maritime archeological expeditions in
history.
Naval guns fired a salute and dozens of pleasure craft
tooted their horns amid cheers from the salvage team and
the operation's president and chief patron, Prince
Charles, as a steel crane rising 300 feet into the air lifted
the hull, nestled in a specially built frame, on to a trans
port barge, near the shoreline of this ancient seaport.
Charles made a 40-minute dive Sunday to take a look
at the hull, his tenth visit to the undersea sight since 1975.
He spent the night at Broadlands, home of Lord Romsey,
35 miles from here, so he could be on hand for the con
clusion of the historic salvage operation.
The maneuver took months to prepare and was de
layed by a host of technical problems, linked to the ex
treme delicacy of wresting the old timbers intact. As it ap
peared above the water line in the heavy mist of early
morning, the deep brown ribs looked like a weather
beaten basket; its decks and guns had been carefully re
moved.
"That's a damn strong ship," exclaimed Margaret
Rule, Mary Rose's chief archeologist.
The Mary Rose had been a tempting target for
salvagers from the moment it went down on July 19,
1545, within sight of Henry VIII, leading an English de
fense against French invaders. On board were 415 sailors,
300 soldiers, 91 cannons and, according to archeologists,
the most complete complement of Tudor period weapon
ry and personal items ever found in one place.
"It isa perfect time capsule," said Andrew Fielding, an
assistant director of the expedition. Since the ship sank
undamaged into the murky sediment of Portsmouth Har
bor, much of its contents have been preserved as though
encased in a protective coating. The effect, experts say, is
like the lava that poured over Pompeii.
So far in tens of thousands of dives over 11 years about
17,000 artifacts have been recovered and gradually are
being restored by teams of specialists in an operation that
has cost about $8 million. The Mary Rose Trust has al
ready become a major historical resource in a country
that has more history to honor than most.
Killings of Guatemalan Indians cited
Washington The military government of
Guatemala, hailed by the Reagan administration when it
took power seven months ago as a hope for an end to po
litical killings in the Central American country, has suf
fered two new blows to its fading prestige.
The London-based human-rights group Amnesty In
ternational made public yesterday a statement saying
government forces have "massacred more than 2600 In
dians and peasants in a new counterinsurgency program
launched after Gen. Efrain Rios Montt came to power in
March."

The statement was issued as the leaders of two
Guatemalan parties that had supported the coup that
brought Rios Montt to power were in Washington to
publicize their disillusionment with his government and
their demand that the military begin the process of hand
ing over power to an elected civilian government.
Guatemalan Ambassador Jose Zelaya Coronado de
nied the Amnesty International charges, saying soldiers
have "very precise instructions from the chief of staff to
respect civilians." He said he had seen a television ac
count showing the army retaking a village in northern
Huehuetenango Province that had been abandoned after
a guerrilla attack in January.

"The people were very grateful to the soldiers for the
way they had helped them," he said.
The ambassador conceded that "there may have been
some abuses, as there are everywhere, but the situation
has improved."
Asked about the political parties' apparent disillusion
ment with the government, Zelaya Coronado said the
military had no intention of remaining in power and was
making plans for a new election.
The issues of human rights and democratic rule are
crucial to efforts by administration officials to obtain mil
itary aid for Guatemala. Military aid was suspended in
1977 following charges that the Guatemalan government
was involved in widespread killing and torture of its op
ponents.
Since then Congress has watched Guatemala's human
rights record closely, and no further aid military has been
appropriated.
The House Foreign Affairs Committee has approved
$250,000 for military training, but the bill has not yet
passed. The administration has also expressed a desire to
sell Guatemala between $3.5 million and $4 million in
spare parts for planes and helicopters. But sources on
Capitol Hill said the proposed aid has failed to receive the
backing of the House Foreign Affairs Committee as re
quired under an informal agreement between the admin
istration and the committee.
'Crown jewel' of oil fields up for lease
Washington An icy stretch of water above Alaska
named Diapir Field may hold the biggest reserves of oil
and gas found in the United States in 14 years.
The oil industry is gearing up for the 1.8 million-acre
lease sale this week, which could bring in a record $3
billion in bids.
Many oil company officials believe the lease sale
tomorrow in Anchorage, Alaska, may be the most lucra
tive of the 41 sales to be offered in Interior Secretary
James Watt's leasing program.
Watt, whp has been attacked for the program offering
virtually the entire American coastline for drilling over
the next five years, is hoping the success of the sale will
silence critics.

"What we need is a big one something that will show
that the oil industry wants this land," Watt has said.
The Diapir Field, named for the type of geological for
mation, lies at the top of Alaska just offshore from the
Prudhoe Bay field, the 1968 discovery that supplies the
country with 18 percent of its domestic oil production.
Diapir's proximity to the Prudhoe field and the Alaska
oil pipeline is the reason the oil industry is excited.
The Interior Department puts the chance of finding
commerical quantities of oil and gas at 99.3 percent. It
estimates that Diapir holds 2.4 billion barrels of oil and
1.8 trillion cubic feet of gas.
"This is the crown jewel of the leasing program. Right
now it is the most promising area we want to get into,"
said Charles Matthews, president of the National Ocean
Industries Association, which represents almost 500
companies involved in offshore exploration and drilling.
Matthews said the bids could reach "between $2 billion
and $3 billion." That could make Diapir the most suc
cessful lease sale in the 28-year history of the federal pro
gram, surpassing a 1980 Gulf of Mexico sale which
brought the government $2.7 billion.
Interior Department officials are not that optimistic.
Watt has said that if the sale exceeds $ 1 billion it will be a
tremendous success. Officials point to the harsh Arctic
conditions that oil companies would have to face as one
reason the bids could be held down.
To compensate for the harsh conditions, Interior is de
manding lower royalty percentages on tracts in deeper
water and giving all successful bidders 10 years instead of
the normal five years to develop the leases.
Today's weather
Sunny and a little warmer today. Highs from the low
70s at the ocean to the low 80s. Variable winds locally to
20 mph in the late afternoon and evening. Clear tonight
with light winds and lows in the 50s. Sunny tomorrow
with highs a few degrees warmer.

Europeans win Nobel for prostaglandin studies

Dow tops 1000 as rates fall
New York Stock prices soared yesterday for the
fourth straight session in near-record trading as the Dow
Jones industrial average pierced the 1000-point mark for
the first time in 15 months amid growing belief interest

"The stock market is responding to the same factors

Five stocks rose for every one that fell on the New

Tudor ship raised off English coast
Portsmouth, England After 437 years on the ocean
floor, the hull of the Mary Rose, flagship of King Henry

one of the greatest maritime archeological expeditions in
history.
Naval guns fired a salute and dozens of pleasure craft
tooted their horns amid cheers from the salvage team and
the operation's president and chief patron, Prince
Charles, as a steel crane rising 300 feet into the air lifted
the hull, nestled in a specially built frame, on to a trans
port barge, near the shoreline of this ancient seaport.
Charles made a 40-minute dive Sunday to take a look
at the hull, his tenth visit to the undersea sight since 1975.
He spent the night at Broadlands, home of Lord Romsey,
35 miles from here, so he could be on hand for the con
clusion of the historic salvage operation.
The maneuver took months to prepare and was de
layed by a host of technical problems, linked to the ex
treme delicacy of wresting the old timbers intact. As it ap
peared above the water line in the heavy mist of early
morning, the deep brown ribs looked like a weather
beaten basket; its decks and guns had been carefully re
moved.
"That's a damn strong ship," exclaimed Margaret
Rule, Mary Rose's chief archeologist.
The Mary Rose had been a tempting target for
salvagers from the moment it went down on July 19,
1545, within sight of Henry VIII, leading an English de
fense against French invaders. On board were 415 sailors,
300 soldiers, 91 cannons and, according to archeologists,
the most complete complement of Tudor period weapon
ry and personal items ever found in one place.
"It isa perfect time capsule," said Andrew Fielding, an
assistant director of the expedition. Since the ship sank
undamaged into the murky sediment of Portsmouth Har
bor, much of its contents have been preserved as though
encased in a protective coating. The effect, experts say, is
like the lava that poured over Pompeii.
So far in tens of thousands of dives over 11 years about
17,000 artifacts have been recovered and gradually are
being restored by teams of specialists in an operation that
has cost about $8 million. The Mary Rose Trust has al
ready become a major historical resource in a country
that has more history to honor than most.
Killings of Guatemalan Indians cited
Washington The military government of
Guatemala, hailed by the Reagan administration when it
took power seven months ago as a hope for an end to po
litical killings in the Central American country, has suf
fered two new blows to its fading prestige.
The London-based human-rights group Amnesty In
ternational made public yesterday a statement saying
government forces have "massacred more than 2600 In
dians and peasants in a new counterinsurgency program
launched after Gen. Efrain Rios Montt came to power in
March."

The statement was issued as the leaders of two
Guatemalan parties that had supported the coup that
brought Rios Montt to power were in Washington to
publicize their disillusionment with his government and
their demand that the military begin the process of hand
ing over power to an elected civilian government.
Guatemalan Ambassador Jose Zelaya Coronado de
nied the Amnesty International charges, saying soldiers
have "very precise instructions from the chief of staff to
respect civilians." He said he had seen a television ac
count showing the army retaking a village in northern
Huehuetenango Province that had been abandoned after
a guerrilla attack in January.

"The people were very grateful to the soldiers for the
way they had helped them," he said.
The ambassador conceded that "there may have been
some abuses, as there are everywhere, but the situation
has improved."
Asked about the political parties' apparent disillusion
ment with the government, Zelaya Coronado said the
military had no intention of remaining in power and was
making plans for a new election.
The issues of human rights and democratic rule are
crucial to efforts by administration officials to obtain mil
itary aid for Guatemala. Military aid was suspended in
1977 following charges that the Guatemalan government
was involved in widespread killing and torture of its op
ponents.
Since then Congress has watched Guatemala's human
rights record closely, and no further aid military has been
appropriated.
The House Foreign Affairs Committee has approved
$250,000 for military training, but the bill has not yet
passed. The administration has also expressed a desire to
sell Guatemala between $3.5 million and $4 million in
spare parts for planes and helicopters. But sources on
Capitol Hill said the proposed aid has failed to receive the
backing of the House Foreign Affairs Committee as re
quired under an informal agreement between the admin
istration and the committee.
'Crown jewel' of oil fields up for lease
Washington An icy stretch of water above Alaska
named Diapir Field may hold the biggest reserves of oil
and gas found in the United States in 14 years.
The oil industry is gearing up for the 1.8 million-acre
lease sale this week, which could bring in a record $3
billion in bids.
Many oil company officials believe the lease sale
tomorrow in Anchorage, Alaska, may be the most lucra
tive of the 41 sales to be offered in Interior Secretary
James Watt's leasing program.
Watt, whp has been attacked for the program offering
virtually the entire American coastline for drilling over
the next five years, is hoping the success of the sale will
silence critics.

"What we need is a big one something that will show
that the oil industry wants this land," Watt has said.
The Diapir Field, named for the type of geological for
mation, lies at the top of Alaska just offshore from the
Prudhoe Bay field, the 1968 discovery that supplies the
country with 18 percent of its domestic oil production.
Diapir's proximity to the Prudhoe field and the Alaska
oil pipeline is the reason the oil industry is excited.
The Interior Department puts the chance of finding
commerical quantities of oil and gas at 99.3 percent. It
estimates that Diapir holds 2.4 billion barrels of oil and
1.8 trillion cubic feet of gas.
"This is the crown jewel of the leasing program. Right
now it is the most promising area we want to get into,"
said Charles Matthews, president of the National Ocean
Industries Association, which represents almost 500
companies involved in offshore exploration and drilling.
Matthews said the bids could reach "between $2 billion
and $3 billion." That could make Diapir the most suc
cessful lease sale in the 28-year history of the federal pro
gram, surpassing a 1980 Gulf of Mexico sale which
brought the government $2.7 billion.
Interior Department officials are not that optimistic.
Watt has said that if the sale exceeds $ 1 billion it will be a
tremendous success. Officials point to the harsh Arctic
conditions that oil companies would have to face as one
reason the bids could be held down.
To compensate for the harsh conditions, Interior is de
manding lower royalty percentages on tracts in deeper
water and giving all successful bidders 10 years instead of
the normal five years to develop the leases.
Today's weather
Sunny and a little warmer today. Highs from the low
70s at the ocean to the low 80s. Variable winds locally to
20 mph in the late afternoon and evening. Clear tonight
with light winds and lows in the 50s. Sunny tomorrow
with highs a few degrees warmer.

Europeans win Nobel for prostaglandin studies

Stockholm Two Swedes and an Englishman yesterday won the 1982
Nobel Prize in medicine for their pioneering studies of potent natural
hormones that affect virtually every system in the human body, from fertility
to circulation of the blood.
Drs. Sune Bergstroem and Bengt Samuelsson, both of the Karolinska In
stitute in Stockholm, which helps award the prestigious prize, and Dr. John
Vane, of the British Wellcome Research Foundation Ltd., will share the
$157,000 prize, the first of the Nobel awards to be announced this year.
Karolinska Institute faculty members assist in selection of prize winners.
Bergstroem, who has long been considered a contender for the medicine
prize, is chairman of the board of directors of the Nobel Foundation, which
administers the award.
The three were cited for their discoveries concerning "prostaglandins and
related biologically active substances," which are locally produced chemical
messengers that function to defend cells against sudden changes caused by
stress, trauma or disease.
The substances, which are named after their original discovery in the pro
state gland, can have both positive and negative effects on the body.
The natural and synthetically produced prostaglandins and drugs that
counteract their effects have a wide range of present and potential uses in
medical treatment, in addition to the basic research leads offered by the dis-
covery of a new biological system.
Experts say that future prostaglandin research may
provide new avenues for treating the allergies that bother
so many people, as well as a possible means for prevent- >
ing heart attacks.
The Nobel committee noted that these chemicals are
already used in obstetrics and gynecology, serving to in
duce both abortion and childbirth. The prostaglandins
have also been used in the treatment of patients with
circulatory system disturbances and peptic ulcers.
Compounds that inhibit the action of prostaglandins
relieve pain caused by menstruation, gallstones and
kidney stones.
Vane, 55, was cited for his "fundamental" discovery a
decade ago that aspirin, one of the most common medica
tions for treating pain and inflammation, acts by block
ing the formation of prostaglandins and related
chemicals. He is a former University of London professor
who now directs group research and development at the
pharmaceutical foundation.
Yesterday's award to three non-American scientists
represented a break in the longstanding dominance of the
world's most prestigious medical prize by the United
States.
Fighting follows Polish union's ban
Gdansk, Poland Thousands of shipyard workers
staged an eight-hour strike yesterday to protest the dis
solution by parliament last week of the Solidarity inde
pendent trade union.
The strike was followed by four hours of street fighting
as special police armed with tear gas and water cannon
attempted to disperse workers and Solidarity supporters
who had gathered outside the gates of the giant Lenin
shipyard.
Police roadblocks were set up around the city and
many motorists were turned away.
Meanwhile, the official news agency PAP announced
the release of 308 people interned under martial law regu
lations, fulfilling a pledge by military ruler Gen. Wo
jciech Jaruzelski last Saturday that a substantial number
of those held, estimated to total more than 800, would be
freed.
The strike in Gdansk, the biggest the Baltic coast city
has seen since the early days of martial law, marked a sig
nificant change of tactics by the union. Until now most
protests against the martial law government here have
taken the form of short symbolic strikes or mass street de
mostrations.
The city, the birthplace of Solidarity, was quiet last
night, but many workers insisted that they would stage a
similar strike today.
Telephone and telex links with Gdansk were cut soon
after the strike began at 6 a.m. when the first shift re
ported for work at the shipyard.
Workers said that rather than wait for riot police to
storm the factories, they would leave at the end of the
shift and return every day.
Yesterday's strikes began after leaflets were distributed
in Gdansk signed by underground Solidarity leaders,
calling on workers to defend the union. A worker at the
Lenin shipyard said that the protest there had erupted
shortly after the start of the first shift.
The strikers at the Lenin shipyard were joined by work
ers in the neighboring repair shop yard and the northern
shipyard. Workers in several smaller enterprises also
joined in as did did workers at the Paris Commune ship
yard in nearby Gdynia.
The gates of the Lenin shipyard, from which Lech
Walesa addressed the striking workers in August 1980,
were once again festooned with flowers, Solidarity ban
ners and portraits of Pope John Paul 11. Slogans pasted to
the wall of the shipyard read, "Solidarity is still alive,"
and "We won't let Solidarity die."
Dow tops 1000 as rates fall
New York Stock prices soared yesterday for the
fourth straight session in near-record trading as the Dow
Jones industrial average pierced the 1000-point mark for
the first time in 15 months amid growing belief interest
rates will keep falling.
"The stock market is responding to the same factors
that eventually will cause an economic recovery more
available and cheaper money," said Michael Metz, vice
president of Oppenheimer & Co.
Five stocks rose for every one that fell on the New
York Stock Exchange.
The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials, which rose 79
points last week, surged another 25.94 to 1012.79 its
highest since it finished at 1016.93 on April 28,1981. The
last time the closely watched measure closed above 1000
was June 23, 1981, when it stood at 1006.66. The average
has risen about 236 points in two months.
Trading volume also kept up its fierce pace. Some
138.53 million shares changed hands on the New York
Stock Exchange, the second-highest one-day total behind
the 147.07 million shares traded last Thursday. It was the
third straight session in which volume surpassed 100 mil

lion shares and the 10th time since Aug. 18, which was the
first day volume ever exceeded 100 million shares.
The market, which often reacts to expectations, has
been rallying despite news showing the economy re
mained weak last month, such as the 10.1 percent un
employment rate reported Friday.
"You can't fight the tape; we're in a bull market," said
Alan Poole, vice president of Laidlaw, Adams & Peck
Inc.
The big factor cited for Wall Street's euphoria is in
vestors' perception that interest rates will keep falling and
spark recovery. With money costing less, consumers
should be encouraged to spend more especially on ex
pensive items requiring credit.
That would allow retailers to order more goods, spur
ring manufacturers to increase production and perhaps
hire back workers.
Also, investors and many market analysts are con
vinced that the decline in the inflation rate is not a fluke.
The Mellon Bank of Pittsburgh has cut its prime to
12.75 percent from 13.5 percent and many other big
banks now have 13 percent rates.
$2OO billion deficit projected for 1984
Washington The Reagan administration has begun
work on the 1984 budget with some internal projections
suggesting the deficit could be nearly $2OO billion in that
fiscal year if there are no further tax increases or spending
cuts.
That is far beyond the $B4 billion that Congress esti
mated for 1984 in the budget resolution approved last
spring, and would exceed even the $152 billion projected
just last month by the Congressional Budget Office.
The $2OO billion figure is not what the president will
propose. Rather, it is a measure of how large a problem
he will face as he works in the next few months to bring
down the deficit down to acceptable levels.
For political reasons, presidential aides have tried to
defer budget talk until after the Nov. 2 election. And
none of the major shaping decisions has yet been made;
the budget, which is for the year beginning next Oct. 1,
does not have to be sent to Congress until early next year.
The deficit estimates are starting points for the budget
process; they are guesses as to what the deficit would be
without any changes in current policy or law.
They assume the president will not flinch from his pres
ently planned defense buildup; he has indicated as much,
even though Congress, in the spring budget resolution,
called for some curtailment.
They also are based on the assumption that there will
be no tax increase. On the contrary, they assume that the
sizable tax cuts already voted by Congress for 1983 and
beyond will be allowed to take effect as planned. The
largest of these involves the so-called indexation of the in
dividual income tax beginning in 1985 to offset the tax ef
fects of inflation. Without indexation, many people auto
matically move into higher tax brackets each year as their
incomes rise.
The president, who was raked by conservatives for sup
porting this year's tax increase, was asked at his news
conference last month whether he would "flatly rule out
any tax increases" in 1984. "Unless there's a palace coup
and I'm overtaken or overthrown, no, I don't see the ne
cessity for that," he answered.
The deficit estimates further assume that the economy
will not improve dramatically by fiscal 1984, but will stay
on the slow-growth path the administration itself has of
ficially projected. Last year an optimistic economic fore
cast helped the president bring down the projected deficit
at budget time. This year he has a new chairman of the
Council of Economic Advisers, Martin Feldstein, who is
already on record as foreseeing only slow-to-moderate
growth, and who is regarded as most unlikely to let his
forecast be altered for political purposes.
Lebanese army searches camps
Beirut, Lebanon In a move that sent new tremors of
fear through the Palestinian refugee camps where hun
dreds of civilians were massacred by Christian militiamen
less than a month ago, the Lebanese army yesterday
sealed off and searched the camps house by house.
The sweep of the tense camps was the latest step in a
citv-wide operation aimed at uncovering hidden arms de
pots and arresting criminals and illegal aliens, which has
been going on now for days.
Lebanese security sources have reported the detention
of more than 500 persons, but other, unofficial, sources
put the total at more than a 1000. Some have been re
leased after an identity check and others deported. But
hundreds are still being held, among whom are reported
to be many Palestinians.

The arrest of Palestinians, in some cases by armed civil
ians identifying themselves as Lebanese security men, has
stirred fears throughouc the Palestinian community of a
second wave of persecution by the authorities. The gov
ernment has already made clear that it wants the vast ma
jority of the estimated 500,000 Palestinians in Lebanon to
leave as soon as possible.
The anxiety gripping the Palestinian camps of Sabra
and Shatila was clearly evident during a visit there yester
day. Armored cars and soldiers of the Lebanese Army

were everywhere, and at mid-morning an officer standing
in a Jeep was shouting through a bullhorn for everyone to
stay at home.
A group of angry Palestinian women asked to speak to
several French soldiers and United Nations observers
standing nearby: They said their husbands and sons had
been taken away earlier in the day, even though they were
1948 refugees with papers allowing them to live in Leba
non.
Both a French officer and a U.N. observer said there
was nothing they could do because it was "an internal
matter involving the Lebanese army and security in the
city.
One woman was nearly hysterical and shouted at the
soldiers and whoever else would listen, "I have no lights,
no water, no electricity, and now they come and take my
son and husband. Who is going to feed me?"
Before she could say more, a soldier pushed the group
away with the side of his gun and told them all to go
home. Photographers and television teams were banned
from the camps yesterday, apparently because of army
fears of just such scenes.
It was not known how many had been arrested in yes
terday's sweep of the camps, which have already been the
scene of intensive hunts for wanted persons by the Leba
nese Army and other security authorities.
Various persons interviewed, including a French of
ficer, told of seeing between 60 and 100 Palestinian men
taken away early in the morning in one part of Sabra
camp.
Tudor ship raised off English coast
Portsmouth, England After 437 years on the ocean
floor, the hull of the Mary Rose, flagship of King Henry
VIII's navy, was raised to the surface yesterday, capping
one of the greatest maritime archeological expeditions in
history.
Naval guns fired a salute and dozens of pleasure craft
tooted their horns amid cheers from the salvage team and
the operation's president and chief patron, Prince
Charles, as a steel crane rising 300 feet into the air lifted
the hull, nestled in a specially built frame, on to a trans
port barge, near the shoreline of this ancient seaport.
Charles made a 40-minute dive Sunday to take a look
at the hull, his tenth visit to the undersea sight since 1975.
He spent the night at Broadlands, home of Lord Romsey,
35 miles from here, so he could be on hand for the con

So far in tens of thousands of dives over 11 years about
17,000 artifacts have been recovered and gradually are
being restored by teams of specialists in an operation that
has cost about $8 million. The Mary Rose Trust has al
ready become a major historical resource in a country
that has more history to honor than most.
Killings of Guatemalan Indians cited
Washington The military government of
Guatemala, hailed by the Reagan administration when it
took power seven months ago as a hope for an end to po
litical killings in the Central American country, has suf
fered two new blows to its fading prestige.
The London-based human-rights group Amnesty In

1977 following charges that the Guatemalan government
was involved in widespread killing and torture of its op

Since then Congress has watched Guatemala's human
rights record closely, and no further aid military has been
appropriated.
The House Foreign Affairs Committee has approved
$250,000 for military training, but the bill has not yet
passed. The administration has also expressed a desire to
sell Guatemala between $3.5 million and $4 million in
spare parts for planes and helicopters. But sources on
Capitol Hill said the proposed aid has failed to receive the
backing of the House Foreign Affairs Committee as re
quired under an informal agreement between the admin
istration and the committee.
'Crown jewel' of oil fields up for lease
Washington An icy stretch of water above Alaska
named Diapir Field may hold the biggest reserves of oil
and gas found in the United States in 14 years.
The oil industry is gearing up for the 1.8 million-acre
lease sale this week, which could bring in a record $3
billion in bids.
Many oil company officials believe the lease sale
tomorrow in Anchorage, Alaska, may be the most lucra
tive of the 41 sales to be offered in Interior Secretary
James Watt's leasing program.
Watt, whp has been attacked for the program offering
virtually the entire American coastline for drilling over
the next five years, is hoping the success of the sale will
silence critics.

"What we need is a big one something that will show
that the oil industry wants this land," Watt has said.
The Diapir Field, named for the type of geological for

Prudhoe Bay field, the 1968 discovery that supplies the
country with 18 percent of its domestic oil production.
Diapir's proximity to the Prudhoe field and the Alaska
oil pipeline is the reason the oil industry is excited.
The Interior Department puts the chance of finding
commerical quantities of oil and gas at 99.3 percent. It
estimates that Diapir holds 2.4 billion barrels of oil and
1.8 trillion cubic feet of gas.
"This is the crown jewel of the leasing program. Right
now it is the most promising area we want to get into,"
said Charles Matthews, president of the National Ocean
Industries Association, which represents almost 500
companies involved in offshore exploration and drilling.
Matthews said the bids could reach "between $2 billion
and $3 billion." That could make Diapir the most suc
cessful lease sale in the 28-year history of the federal pro
gram, surpassing a 1980 Gulf of Mexico sale which
brought the government $2.7 billion.
Interior Department officials are not that optimistic.
Watt has said that if the sale exceeds $ 1 billion it will be a
tremendous success. Officials point to the harsh Arctic
conditions that oil companies would have to face as one
reason the bids could be held down.
To compensate for the harsh conditions, Interior is de
manding lower royalty percentages on tracts in deeper
water and giving all successful bidders 10 years instead of
the normal five years to develop the leases.

Dow tops 1000 as rates fall
New York Stock prices soared yesterday for the
fourth straight session in near-record trading as the Dow
Jones industrial average pierced the 1000-point mark for
the first time in 15 months amid growing belief interest
rates will keep falling.
"The stock market is responding to the same factors
that eventually will cause an economic recovery more
available and cheaper money," said Michael Metz, vice
president of Oppenheimer & Co.
Five stocks rose for every one that fell on the New

The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials, which rose 79

highest since it finished at 1016.93 on April 28,1981. The
last time the closely watched measure closed above 1000
was June 23, 1981, when it stood at 1006.66. The average
has risen about 236 points in two months.
Trading volume also kept up its fierce pace. Some
138.53 million shares changed hands on the New York
Stock Exchange, the second-highest one-day total behind
the 147.07 million shares traded last Thursday. It was the
third straight session in which volume surpassed 100 mil

lion shares and the 10th time since Aug. 18, which was the
first day volume ever exceeded 100 million shares.
The market, which often reacts to expectations, has
been rallying despite news showing the economy re
mained weak last month, such as the 10.1 percent un
employment rate reported Friday.
"You can't fight the tape; we're in a bull market," said
Alan Poole, vice president of Laidlaw, Adams & Peck
Inc.
The big factor cited for Wall Street's euphoria is in
vestors' perception that interest rates will keep falling and
spark recovery. With money costing less, consumers
should be encouraged to spend more especially on ex
pensive items requiring credit.
That would allow retailers to order more goods, spur
ring manufacturers to increase production and perhaps
hire back workers.
Also, investors and many market analysts are con
vinced that the decline in the inflation rate is not a fluke.
The Mellon Bank of Pittsburgh has cut its prime to
12.75 percent from 13.5 percent and many other big
banks now have 13 percent rates.
$2OO billion deficit projected for 1984
Washington The Reagan administration has begun
work on the 1984 budget with some internal projections
suggesting the deficit could be nearly $2OO billion in that
fiscal year if there are no further tax increases or spending
cuts.
That is far beyond the $B4 billion that Congress esti
mated for 1984 in the budget resolution approved last
spring, and would exceed even the $152 billion projected
just last month by the Congressional Budget Office.
The $2OO billion figure is not what the president will
propose. Rather, it is a measure of how large a problem
he will face as he works in the next few months to bring
down the deficit down to acceptable levels.
For political reasons, presidential aides have tried to
defer budget talk until after the Nov. 2 election. And
none of the major shaping decisions has yet been made;
the budget, which is for the year beginning next Oct. 1,
does not have to be sent to Congress until early next year.
The deficit estimates are starting points for the budget
process; they are guesses as to what the deficit would be
without any changes in current policy or law.
They assume the president will not flinch from his pres
ently planned defense buildup; he has indicated as much,
even though Congress, in the spring budget resolution,
called for some curtailment.
They also are based on the assumption that there will
be no tax increase. On the contrary, they assume that the
sizable tax cuts already voted by Congress for 1983 and
beyond will be allowed to take effect as planned. The
largest of these involves the so-called indexation of the in
dividual income tax beginning in 1985 to offset the tax ef
fects of inflation. Without indexation, many people auto
matically move into higher tax brackets each year as their
incomes rise.
The president, who was raked by conservatives for sup
porting this year's tax increase, was asked at his news
conference last month whether he would "flatly rule out
any tax increases" in 1984. "Unless there's a palace coup
and I'm overtaken or overthrown, no, I don't see the ne
cessity for that," he answered.
The deficit estimates further assume that the economy
will not improve dramatically by fiscal 1984, but will stay
on the slow-growth path the administration itself has of
ficially projected. Last year an optimistic economic fore
cast helped the president bring down the projected deficit
at budget time. This year he has a new chairman of the
Council of Economic Advisers, Martin Feldstein, who is
already on record as foreseeing only slow-to-moderate
growth, and who is regarded as most unlikely to let his
forecast be altered for political purposes.
Lebanese army searches camps
Beirut, Lebanon In a move that sent new tremors of
fear through the Palestinian refugee camps where hun
dreds of civilians were massacred by Christian militiamen
less than a month ago, the Lebanese army yesterday
sealed off and searched the camps house by house.
The sweep of the tense camps was the latest step in a
citv-wide operation aimed at uncovering hidden arms de
pots and arresting criminals and illegal aliens, which has
been going on now for days.
Lebanese security sources have reported the detention
of more than 500 persons, but other, unofficial, sources
put the total at more than a 1000. Some have been re
leased after an identity check and others deported. But
hundreds are still being held, among whom are reported
to be many Palestinians.

The arrest of Palestinians, in some cases by armed civil
ians identifying themselves as Lebanese security men, has
stirred fears throughouc the Palestinian community of a
second wave of persecution by the authorities. The gov
ernment has already made clear that it wants the vast ma
jority of the estimated 500,000 Palestinians in Lebanon to
leave as soon as possible.
The anxiety gripping the Palestinian camps of Sabra
and Shatila was clearly evident during a visit there yester
day. Armored cars and soldiers of the Lebanese Army

were everywhere, and at mid-morning an officer standing
in a Jeep was shouting through a bullhorn for everyone to
stay at home.
A group of angry Palestinian women asked to speak to
several French soldiers and United Nations observers
standing nearby: They said their husbands and sons had
been taken away earlier in the day, even though they were
1948 refugees with papers allowing them to live in Leba
non.
Both a French officer and a U.N. observer said there
was nothing they could do because it was "an internal
matter involving the Lebanese army and security in the
city.
One woman was nearly hysterical and shouted at the
soldiers and whoever else would listen, "I have no lights,
no water, no electricity, and now they come and take my
son and husband. Who is going to feed me?"
Before she could say more, a soldier pushed the group
away with the side of his gun and told them all to go
home. Photographers and television teams were banned
from the camps yesterday, apparently because of army
fears of just such scenes.
It was not known how many had been arrested in yes
terday's sweep of the camps, which have already been the
scene of intensive hunts for wanted persons by the Leba
nese Army and other security authorities.
Various persons interviewed, including a French of
ficer, told of seeing between 60 and 100 Palestinian men
taken away early in the morning in one part of Sabra
camp.
Tudor ship raised off English coast
Portsmouth, England After 437 years on the ocean
floor, the hull of the Mary Rose, flagship of King Henry
VIII's navy, was raised to the surface yesterday, capping
one of the greatest maritime archeological expeditions in
history.
Naval guns fired a salute and dozens of pleasure craft
tooted their horns amid cheers from the salvage team and
the operation's president and chief patron, Prince
Charles, as a steel crane rising 300 feet into the air lifted
the hull, nestled in a specially built frame, on to a trans
port barge, near the shoreline of this ancient seaport.
Charles made a 40-minute dive Sunday to take a look
at the hull, his tenth visit to the undersea sight since 1975.
He spent the night at Broadlands, home of Lord Romsey,
35 miles from here, so he could be on hand for the con
clusion of the historic salvage operation.
The maneuver took months to prepare and was de
layed by a host of technical problems, linked to the ex
treme delicacy of wresting the old timbers intact. As it ap
peared above the water line in the heavy mist of early
morning, the deep brown ribs looked like a weather
beaten basket; its decks and guns had been carefully re
moved.
"That's a damn strong ship," exclaimed Margaret
Rule, Mary Rose's chief archeologist.
The Mary Rose had been a tempting target for
salvagers from the moment it went down on July 19,
1545, within sight of Henry VIII, leading an English de
fense against French invaders. On board were 415 sailors,
300 soldiers, 91 cannons and, according to archeologists,
the most complete complement of Tudor period weapon
ry and personal items ever found in one place.
"It isa perfect time capsule," said Andrew Fielding, an
assistant director of the expedition. Since the ship sank
undamaged into the murky sediment of Portsmouth Har
bor, much of its contents have been preserved as though
encased in a protective coating. The effect, experts say, is
like the lava that poured over Pompeii.
So far in tens of thousands of dives over 11 years about
17,000 artifacts have been recovered and gradually are
being restored by teams of specialists in an operation that
has cost about $8 million. The Mary Rose Trust has al
ready become a major historical resource in a country
that has more history to honor than most.
Killings of Guatemalan Indians cited
Washington The military government of
Guatemala, hailed by the Reagan administration when it
took power seven months ago as a hope for an end to po
litical killings in the Central American country, has suf
fered two new blows to its fading prestige.
The London-based human-rights group Amnesty In
ternational made public yesterday a statement saying
government forces have "massacred more than 2600 In
dians and peasants in a new counterinsurgency program
launched after Gen. Efrain Rios Montt came to power in
March."

The statement was issued as the leaders of two
Guatemalan parties that had supported the coup that
brought Rios Montt to power were in Washington to
publicize their disillusionment with his government and
their demand that the military begin the process of hand
ing over power to an elected civilian government.
Guatemalan Ambassador Jose Zelaya Coronado de
nied the Amnesty International charges, saying soldiers
have "very precise instructions from the chief of staff to
respect civilians." He said he had seen a television ac
count showing the army retaking a village in northern
Huehuetenango Province that had been abandoned after
a guerrilla attack in January.

"The people were very grateful to the soldiers for the
way they had helped them," he said.
The ambassador conceded that "there may have been
some abuses, as there are everywhere, but the situation
has improved."
Asked about the political parties' apparent disillusion
ment with the government, Zelaya Coronado said the
military had no intention of remaining in power and was
making plans for a new election.
The issues of human rights and democratic rule are
crucial to efforts by administration officials to obtain mil
itary aid for Guatemala. Military aid was suspended in
1977 following charges that the Guatemalan government
was involved in widespread killing and torture of its op
ponents.
Since then Congress has watched Guatemala's human
rights record closely, and no further aid military has been
appropriated.
The House Foreign Affairs Committee has approved
$250,000 for military training, but the bill has not yet
passed. The administration has also expressed a desire to
sell Guatemala between $3.5 million and $4 million in
spare parts for planes and helicopters. But sources on
Capitol Hill said the proposed aid has failed to receive the
backing of the House Foreign Affairs Committee as re
quired under an informal agreement between the admin
istration and the committee.
'Crown jewel' of oil fields up for lease
Washington An icy stretch of water above Alaska
named Diapir Field may hold the biggest reserves of oil
and gas found in the United States in 14 years.
The oil industry is gearing up for the 1.8 million-acre
lease sale this week, which could bring in a record $3
billion in bids.
Many oil company officials believe the lease sale
tomorrow in Anchorage, Alaska, may be the most lucra
tive of the 41 sales to be offered in Interior Secretary
James Watt's leasing program.
Watt, whp has been attacked for the program offering
virtually the entire American coastline for drilling over
the next five years, is hoping the success of the sale will
silence critics.

"What we need is a big one something that will show
that the oil industry wants this land," Watt has said.
The Diapir Field, named for the type of geological for
mation, lies at the top of Alaska just offshore from the
Prudhoe Bay field, the 1968 discovery that supplies the
country with 18 percent of its domestic oil production.
Diapir's proximity to the Prudhoe field and the Alaska
oil pipeline is the reason the oil industry is excited.
The Interior Department puts the chance of finding
commerical quantities of oil and gas at 99.3 percent. It
estimates that Diapir holds 2.4 billion barrels of oil and
1.8 trillion cubic feet of gas.
"This is the crown jewel of the leasing program. Right
now it is the most promising area we want to get into,"
said Charles Matthews, president of the National Ocean
Industries Association, which represents almost 500
companies involved in offshore exploration and drilling.
Matthews said the bids could reach "between $2 billion
and $3 billion." That could make Diapir the most suc
cessful lease sale in the 28-year history of the federal pro
gram, surpassing a 1980 Gulf of Mexico sale which
brought the government $2.7 billion.
Interior Department officials are not that optimistic.
Watt has said that if the sale exceeds $ 1 billion it will be a
tremendous success. Officials point to the harsh Arctic
conditions that oil companies would have to face as one
reason the bids could be held down.
To compensate for the harsh conditions, Interior is de
manding lower royalty percentages on tracts in deeper
water and giving all successful bidders 10 years instead of
the normal five years to develop the leases.
Today's weather
Sunny and a little warmer today. Highs from the low
70s at the ocean to the low 80s. Variable winds locally to
20 mph in the late afternoon and evening. Clear tonight

Europeans win Nobel for prostaglandin studies

Stockholm Two Swedes and an Englishman yesterday won the 1982
Nobel Prize in medicine for their pioneering studies of potent natural
hormones that affect virtually every system in the human body, from fertility
to circulation of the blood.
Drs. Sune Bergstroem and Bengt Samuelsson, both of the Karolinska In
stitute in Stockholm, which helps award the prestigious prize, and Dr. John
Vane, of the British Wellcome Research Foundation Ltd., will share the
$157,000 prize, the first of the Nobel awards to be announced this year.
Karolinska Institute faculty members assist in selection of prize winners.
Bergstroem, who has long been considered a contender for the medicine
prize, is chairman of the board of directors of the Nobel Foundation, which
administers the award.
The three were cited for their discoveries concerning "prostaglandins and
related biologically active substances," which are locally produced chemical
messengers that function to defend cells against sudden changes caused by
stress, trauma or disease.
The substances, which are named after their original discovery in the pro
state gland, can have both positive and negative effects on the body.
The natural and synthetically produced prostaglandins and drugs that
counteract their effects have a wide range of present and potential uses in
medical treatment, in addition to the basic research leads offered by the dis-
covery of a new biological system.
Experts say that future prostaglandin research may
provide new avenues for treating the allergies that bother
so many people, as well as a possible means for prevent- >
ing heart attacks.
The Nobel committee noted that these chemicals are
already used in obstetrics and gynecology, serving to in
duce both abortion and childbirth. The prostaglandins
have also been used in the treatment of patients with
circulatory system disturbances and peptic ulcers.
Compounds that inhibit the action of prostaglandins
relieve pain caused by menstruation, gallstones and
kidney stones.
Vane, 55, was cited for his "fundamental" discovery a
decade ago that aspirin, one of the most common medica
tions for treating pain and inflammation, acts by block
ing the formation of prostaglandins and related
chemicals. He is a former University of London professor
who now directs group research and development at the
pharmaceutical foundation.
Yesterday's award to three non-American scientists
represented a break in the longstanding dominance of the
world's most prestigious medical prize by the United
States.
Fighting follows Polish union's ban
Gdansk, Poland Thousands of shipyard workers
staged an eight-hour strike yesterday to protest the dis
solution by parliament last week of the Solidarity inde
pendent trade union.
The strike was followed by four hours of street fighting
as special police armed with tear gas and water cannon
attempted to disperse workers and Solidarity supporters
who had gathered outside the gates of the giant Lenin
shipyard.
Police roadblocks were set up around the city and
many motorists were turned away.
Meanwhile, the official news agency PAP announced
the release of 308 people interned under martial law regu
lations, fulfilling a pledge by military ruler Gen. Wo
jciech Jaruzelski last Saturday that a substantial number
of those held, estimated to total more than 800, would be
freed.
The strike in Gdansk, the biggest the Baltic coast city
has seen since the early days of martial law, marked a sig
nificant change of tactics by the union. Until now most
protests against the martial law government here have
taken the form of short symbolic strikes or mass street de
mostrations.
The city, the birthplace of Solidarity, was quiet last
night, but many workers insisted that they would stage a
similar strike today.
Telephone and telex links with Gdansk were cut soon
after the strike began at 6 a.m. when the first shift re
ported for work at the shipyard.
Workers said that rather than wait for riot police to
storm the factories, they would leave at the end of the
shift and return every day.
Yesterday's strikes began after leaflets were distributed
in Gdansk signed by underground Solidarity leaders,
calling on workers to defend the union. A worker at the
Lenin shipyard said that the protest there had erupted
shortly after the start of the first shift.
The strikers at the Lenin shipyard were joined by work
ers in the neighboring repair shop yard and the northern
shipyard. Workers in several smaller enterprises also
joined in as did did workers at the Paris Commune ship
yard in nearby Gdynia.
The gates of the Lenin shipyard, from which Lech
Walesa addressed the striking workers in August 1980,
were once again festooned with flowers, Solidarity ban
ners and portraits of Pope John Paul 11. Slogans pasted to
the wall of the shipyard read, "Solidarity is still alive,"
and "We won't let Solidarity die."
Dow tops 1000 as rates fall
New York Stock prices soared yesterday for the
fourth straight session in near-record trading as the Dow
Jones industrial average pierced the 1000-point mark for
the first time in 15 months amid growing belief interest
rates will keep falling.
"The stock market is responding to the same factors
that eventually will cause an economic recovery more
available and cheaper money," said Michael Metz, vice
president of Oppenheimer & Co.
Five stocks rose for every one that fell on the New
York Stock Exchange.
The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials, which rose 79
points last week, surged another 25.94 to 1012.79 its
highest since it finished at 1016.93 on April 28,1981. The
last time the closely watched measure closed above 1000
was June 23, 1981, when it stood at 1006.66. The average
has risen about 236 points in two months.
Trading volume also kept up its fierce pace. Some
138.53 million shares changed hands on the New York
Stock Exchange, the second-highest one-day total behind
the 147.07 million shares traded last Thursday. It was the
third straight session in which volume surpassed 100 mil

lion shares and the 10th time since Aug. 18, which was the
first day volume ever exceeded 100 million shares.
The market, which often reacts to expectations, has
been rallying despite news showing the economy re
mained weak last month, such as the 10.1 percent un

Lebanese army searches camps

Killings of Guatemalan Indians cited

Guatemala, hailed by the Reagan administration when it

'Crown jewel' of oil fields up for lease
Washington An icy stretch of water above Alaska
named Diapir Field may hold the biggest reserves of oil
and gas found in the United States in 14 years.
The oil industry is gearing up for the 1.8 million-acre
lease sale this week, which could bring in a record $3
billion in bids.
Many oil company officials believe the lease sale
tomorrow in Anchorage, Alaska, may be the most lucra

country with 18 percent of its domestic oil production.
Diapir's proximity to the Prudhoe field and the Alaska
oil pipeline is the reason the oil industry is excited.
The Interior Department puts the chance of finding
commerical quantities of oil and gas at 99.3 percent. It
estimates that Diapir holds 2.4 billion barrels of oil and
1.8 trillion cubic feet of gas.
"This is the crown jewel of the leasing program. Right
now it is the most promising area we want to get into,"
said Charles Matthews, president of the National Ocean
Industries Association, which represents almost 500
companies involved in offshore exploration and drilling.
Matthews said the bids could reach "between $2 billion
and $3 billion." That could make Diapir the most suc
cessful lease sale in the 28-year history of the federal pro
gram, surpassing a 1980 Gulf of Mexico sale which
brought the government $2.7 billion.
Interior Department officials are not that optimistic.
Watt has said that if the sale exceeds $ 1 billion it will be a
tremendous success. Officials point to the harsh Arctic
conditions that oil companies would have to face as one
reason the bids could be held down.
To compensate for the harsh conditions, Interior is de
manding lower royalty percentages on tracts in deeper
water and giving all successful bidders 10 years instead of
the normal five years to develop the leases.

Europeans win Nobel for prostaglandin studies

Stockholm Two Swedes and an Englishman yesterday won the 1982
Nobel Prize in medicine for their pioneering studies of potent natural
hormones that affect virtually every system in the human body, from fertility
to circulation of the blood.
Drs. Sune Bergstroem and Bengt Samuelsson, both of the Karolinska In
stitute in Stockholm, which helps award the prestigious prize, and Dr. John
Vane, of the British Wellcome Research Foundation Ltd., will share the
$157,000 prize, the first of the Nobel awards to be announced this year.
Karolinska Institute faculty members assist in selection of prize winners.
Bergstroem, who has long been considered a contender for the medicine
prize, is chairman of the board of directors of the Nobel Foundation, which
administers the award.
The three were cited for their discoveries concerning "prostaglandins and
related biologically active substances," which are locally produced chemical
messengers that function to defend cells against sudden changes caused by
stress, trauma or disease.
The substances, which are named after their original discovery in the pro
state gland, can have both positive and negative effects on the body.
The natural and synthetically produced prostaglandins and drugs that
counteract their effects have a wide range of present and potential uses in
medical treatment, in addition to the basic research leads offered by the dis-
covery of a new biological system.
Experts say that future prostaglandin research may
provide new avenues for treating the allergies that bother
so many people, as well as a possible means for prevent- >
ing heart attacks.
The Nobel committee noted that these chemicals are
already used in obstetrics and gynecology, serving to in
duce both abortion and childbirth. The prostaglandins
have also been used in the treatment of patients with
circulatory system disturbances and peptic ulcers.
Compounds that inhibit the action of prostaglandins
relieve pain caused by menstruation, gallstones and
kidney stones.
Vane, 55, was cited for his "fundamental" discovery a
decade ago that aspirin, one of the most common medica
tions for treating pain and inflammation, acts by block
ing the formation of prostaglandins and related
chemicals. He is a former University of London professor
who now directs group research and development at the
pharmaceutical foundation.
Yesterday's award to three non-American scientists
represented a break in the longstanding dominance of the
world's most prestigious medical prize by the United
States.
Fighting follows Polish union's ban
Gdansk, Poland Thousands of shipyard workers
staged an eight-hour strike yesterday to protest the dis
solution by parliament last week of the Solidarity inde
pendent trade union.
The strike was followed by four hours of street fighting
as special police armed with tear gas and water cannon
attempted to disperse workers and Solidarity supporters
who had gathered outside the gates of the giant Lenin
shipyard.
Police roadblocks were set up around the city and
many motorists were turned away.
Meanwhile, the official news agency PAP announced
the release of 308 people interned under martial law regu
lations, fulfilling a pledge by military ruler Gen. Wo
jciech Jaruzelski last Saturday that a substantial number
of those held, estimated to total more than 800, would be
freed.
The strike in Gdansk, the biggest the Baltic coast city
has seen since the early days of martial law, marked a sig
nificant change of tactics by the union. Until now most
protests against the martial law government here have
taken the form of short symbolic strikes or mass street de
mostrations.
The city, the birthplace of Solidarity, was quiet last
night, but many workers insisted that they would stage a
similar strike today.
Telephone and telex links with Gdansk were cut soon
after the strike began at 6 a.m. when the first shift re
ported for work at the shipyard.
Workers said that rather than wait for riot police to
storm the factories, they would leave at the end of the
shift and return every day.
Yesterday's strikes began after leaflets were distributed
in Gdansk signed by underground Solidarity leaders,
calling on workers to defend the union. A worker at the
Lenin shipyard said that the protest there had erupted
shortly after the start of the first shift.
The strikers at the Lenin shipyard were joined by work
ers in the neighboring repair shop yard and the northern
shipyard. Workers in several smaller enterprises also
joined in as did did workers at the Paris Commune ship
yard in nearby Gdynia.
The gates of the Lenin shipyard, from which Lech
Walesa addressed the striking workers in August 1980,
were once again festooned with flowers, Solidarity ban
ners and portraits of Pope John Paul 11. Slogans pasted to
the wall of the shipyard read, "Solidarity is still alive,"
and "We won't let Solidarity die."
Dow tops 1000 as rates fall
New York Stock prices soared yesterday for the
fourth straight session in near-record trading as the Dow
Jones industrial average pierced the 1000-point mark for
the first time in 15 months amid growing belief interest
rates will keep falling.
"The stock market is responding to the same factors
that eventually will cause an economic recovery more
available and cheaper money," said Michael Metz, vice
president of Oppenheimer & Co.
Five stocks rose for every one that fell on the New
York Stock Exchange.
The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials, which rose 79
points last week, surged another 25.94 to 1012.79 its
highest since it finished at 1016.93 on April 28,1981. The
last time the closely watched measure closed above 1000
was June 23, 1981, when it stood at 1006.66. The average
has risen about 236 points in two months.
Trading volume also kept up its fierce pace. Some
138.53 million shares changed hands on the New York
Stock Exchange, the second-highest one-day total behind
the 147.07 million shares traded last Thursday. It was the
third straight session in which volume surpassed 100 mil

lion shares and the 10th time since Aug. 18, which was the
first day volume ever exceeded 100 million shares.
The market, which often reacts to expectations, has
been rallying despite news showing the economy re
mained weak last month, such as the 10.1 percent un
employment rate reported Friday.
"You can't fight the tape; we're in a bull market," said
Alan Poole, vice president of Laidlaw, Adams & Peck
Inc.
The big factor cited for Wall Street's euphoria is in
vestors' perception that interest rates will keep falling and
spark recovery. With money costing less, consumers
should be encouraged to spend more especially on ex
pensive items requiring credit.
That would allow retailers to order more goods, spur
ring manufacturers to increase production and perhaps
hire back workers.
Also, investors and many market analysts are con
vinced that the decline in the inflation rate is not a fluke.
The Mellon Bank of Pittsburgh has cut its prime to
12.75 percent from 13.5 percent and many other big
banks now have 13 percent rates.
$2OO billion deficit projected for 1984
Washington The Reagan administration has begun
work on the 1984 budget with some internal projections
suggesting the deficit could be nearly $2OO billion in that
fiscal year if there are no further tax increases or spending
cuts.
That is far beyond the $B4 billion that Congress esti
mated for 1984 in the budget resolution approved last
spring, and would exceed even the $152 billion projected
just last month by the Congressional Budget Office.
The $2OO billion figure is not what the president will
propose. Rather, it is a measure of how large a problem
he will face as he works in the next few months to bring
down the deficit down to acceptable levels.
For political reasons, presidential aides have tried to
defer budget talk until after the Nov. 2 election. And
none of the major shaping decisions has yet been made;
the budget, which is for the year beginning next Oct. 1,
does not have to be sent to Congress until early next year.
The deficit estimates are starting points for the budget
process; they are guesses as to what the deficit would be
without any changes in current policy or law.
They assume the president will not flinch from his pres
ently planned defense buildup; he has indicated as much,
even though Congress, in the spring budget resolution,
called for some curtailment.
They also are based on the assumption that there will
be no tax increase. On the contrary, they assume that the
sizable tax cuts already voted by Congress for 1983 and
beyond will be allowed to take effect as planned. The
largest of these involves the so-called indexation of the in
dividual income tax beginning in 1985 to offset the tax ef
fects of inflation. Without indexation, many people auto
matically move into higher tax brackets each year as their
incomes rise.
The president, who was raked by conservatives for sup
porting this year's tax increase, was asked at his news
conference last month whether he would "flatly rule out
any tax increases" in 1984. "Unless there's a palace coup
and I'm overtaken or overthrown, no, I don't see the ne
cessity for that," he answered.
The deficit estimates further assume that the economy
will not improve dramatically by fiscal 1984, but will stay
on the slow-growth path the administration itself has of
ficially projected. Last year an optimistic economic fore
cast helped the president bring down the projected deficit
at budget time. This year he has a new chairman of the
Council of Economic Advisers, Martin Feldstein, who is
already on record as foreseeing only slow-to-moderate
growth, and who is regarded as most unlikely to let his
forecast be altered for political purposes.
Lebanese army searches camps
Beirut, Lebanon In a move that sent new tremors of
fear through the Palestinian refugee camps where hun
dreds of civilians were massacred by Christian militiamen
less than a month ago, the Lebanese army yesterday
sealed off and searched the camps house by house.
The sweep of the tense camps was the latest step in a
citv-wide operation aimed at uncovering hidden arms de
pots and arresting criminals and illegal aliens, which has
been going on now for days.
Lebanese security sources have reported the detention
of more than 500 persons, but other, unofficial, sources
put the total at more than a 1000. Some have been re
leased after an identity check and others deported. But
hundreds are still being held, among whom are reported
to be many Palestinians.

The arrest of Palestinians, in some cases by armed civil
ians identifying themselves as Lebanese security men, has
stirred fears throughouc the Palestinian community of a
second wave of persecution by the authorities. The gov
ernment has already made clear that it wants the vast ma
jority of the estimated 500,000 Palestinians in Lebanon to
leave as soon as possible.
The anxiety gripping the Palestinian camps of Sabra
and Shatila was clearly evident during a visit there yester
day. Armored cars and soldiers of the Lebanese Army

were everywhere, and at mid-morning an officer standing
in a Jeep was shouting through a bullhorn for everyone to
stay at home.
A group of angry Palestinian women asked to speak to
several French soldiers and United Nations observers
standing nearby: They said their husbands and sons had
been taken away earlier in the day, even though they were
1948 refugees with papers allowing them to live in Leba
non.
Both a French officer and a U.N. observer said there
was nothing they could do because it was "an internal
matter involving the Lebanese army and security in the
city.
One woman was nearly hysterical and shouted at the
soldiers and whoever else would listen, "I have no lights,
no water, no electricity, and now they come and take my
son and husband. Who is going to feed me?"
Before she could say more, a soldier pushed the group
away with the side of his gun and told them all to go
home. Photographers and television teams were banned
from the camps yesterday, apparently because of army
fears of just such scenes.
It was not known how many had been arrested in yes
terday's sweep of the camps, which have already been the
scene of intensive hunts for wanted persons by the Leba
nese Army and other security authorities.
Various persons interviewed, including a French of
ficer, told of seeing between 60 and 100 Palestinian men
taken away early in the morning in one part of Sabra
camp.
Tudor ship raised off English coast
Portsmouth, England After 437 years on the ocean
floor, the hull of the Mary Rose, flagship of King Henry
VIII's navy, was raised to the surface yesterday, capping
one of the greatest maritime archeological expeditions in
history.
Naval guns fired a salute and dozens of pleasure craft
tooted their horns amid cheers from the salvage team and
the operation's president and chief patron, Prince
Charles, as a steel crane rising 300 feet into the air lifted
the hull, nestled in a specially built frame, on to a trans
port barge, near the shoreline of this ancient seaport.
Charles made a 40-minute dive Sunday to take a look
at the hull, his tenth visit to the undersea sight since 1975.
He spent the night at Broadlands, home of Lord Romsey,
35 miles from here, so he could be on hand for the con
clusion of the historic salvage operation.
The maneuver took months to prepare and was de
layed by a host of technical problems, linked to the ex
treme delicacy of wresting the old timbers intact. As it ap
peared above the water line in the heavy mist of early
morning, the deep brown ribs looked like a weather
beaten basket; its decks and guns had been carefully re
moved.
"That's a damn strong ship," exclaimed Margaret
Rule, Mary Rose's chief archeologist.
The Mary Rose had been a tempting target for
salvagers from the moment it went down on July 19,
1545, within sight of Henry VIII, leading an English de
fense against French invaders. On board were 415 sailors,
300 soldiers, 91 cannons and, according to archeologists,
the most complete complement of Tudor period weapon
ry and personal items ever found in one place.
"It isa perfect time capsule," said Andrew Fielding, an
assistant director of the expedition. Since the ship sank
undamaged into the murky sediment of Portsmouth Har
bor, much of its contents have been preserved as though
encased in a protective coating. The effect, experts say, is
like the lava that poured over Pompeii.
So far in tens of thousands of dives over 11 years about
17,000 artifacts have been recovered and gradually are
being restored by teams of specialists in an operation that
has cost about $8 million. The Mary Rose Trust has al
ready become a major historical resource in a country
that has more history to honor than most.
Killings of Guatemalan Indians cited
Washington The military government of
Guatemala, hailed by the Reagan administration when it
took power seven months ago as a hope for an end to po
litical killings in the Central American country, has suf
fered two new blows to its fading prestige.
The London-based human-rights group Amnesty In
ternational made public yesterday a statement saying
government forces have "massacred more than 2600 In
dians and peasants in a new counterinsurgency program
launched after Gen. Efrain Rios Montt came to power in
March."

The statement was issued as the leaders of two
Guatemalan parties that had supported the coup that
brought Rios Montt to power were in Washington to
publicize their disillusionment with his government and
their demand that the military begin the process of hand
ing over power to an elected civilian government.
Guatemalan Ambassador Jose Zelaya Coronado de
nied the Amnesty International charges, saying soldiers
have "very precise instructions from the chief of staff to
respect civilians." He said he had seen a television ac
count showing the army retaking a village in northern
Huehuetenango Province that had been abandoned after
a guerrilla attack in January.

"The people were very grateful to the soldiers for the
way they had helped them," he said.
The ambassador conceded that "there may have been
some abuses, as there are everywhere, but the situation
has improved."
Asked about the political parties' apparent disillusion
ment with the government, Zelaya Coronado said the
military had no intention of remaining in power and was
making plans for a new election.
The issues of human rights and democratic rule are
crucial to efforts by administration officials to obtain mil
itary aid for Guatemala. Military aid was suspended in
1977 following charges that the Guatemalan government
was involved in widespread killing and torture of its op
ponents.
Since then Congress has watched Guatemala's human
rights record closely, and no further aid military has been
appropriated.
The House Foreign Affairs Committee has approved
$250,000 for military training, but the bill has not yet
passed. The administration has also expressed a desire to
sell Guatemala between $3.5 million and $4 million in
spare parts for planes and helicopters. But sources on
Capitol Hill said the proposed aid has failed to receive the
backing of the House Foreign Affairs Committee as re
quired under an informal agreement between the admin
istration and the committee.
'Crown jewel' of oil fields up for lease
Washington An icy stretch of water above Alaska
named Diapir Field may hold the biggest reserves of oil
and gas found in the United States in 14 years.
The oil industry is gearing up for the 1.8 million-acre
lease sale this week, which could bring in a record $3
billion in bids.
Many oil company officials believe the lease sale
tomorrow in Anchorage, Alaska, may be the most lucra
tive of the 41 sales to be offered in Interior Secretary
James Watt's leasing program.
Watt, whp has been attacked for the program offering
virtually the entire American coastline for drilling over
the next five years, is hoping the success of the sale will
silence critics.

"What we need is a big one something that will show
that the oil industry wants this land," Watt has said.
The Diapir Field, named for the type of geological for
mation, lies at the top of Alaska just offshore from the
Prudhoe Bay field, the 1968 discovery that supplies the
country with 18 percent of its domestic oil production.
Diapir's proximity to the Prudhoe field and the Alaska
oil pipeline is the reason the oil industry is excited.
The Interior Department puts the chance of finding
commerical quantities of oil and gas at 99.3 percent. It
estimates that Diapir holds 2.4 billion barrels of oil and
1.8 trillion cubic feet of gas.
"This is the crown jewel of the leasing program. Right
now it is the most promising area we want to get into,"
said Charles Matthews, president of the National Ocean
Industries Association, which represents almost 500
companies involved in offshore exploration and drilling.
Matthews said the bids could reach "between $2 billion
and $3 billion." That could make Diapir the most suc
cessful lease sale in the 28-year history of the federal pro
gram, surpassing a 1980 Gulf of Mexico sale which
brought the government $2.7 billion.
Interior Department officials are not that optimistic.
Watt has said that if the sale exceeds $ 1 billion it will be a
tremendous success. Officials point to the harsh Arctic
conditions that oil companies would have to face as one
reason the bids could be held down.
To compensate for the harsh conditions, Interior is de
manding lower royalty percentages on tracts in deeper
water and giving all successful bidders 10 years instead of
the normal five years to develop the leases.

70s at the ocean to the low 80s. Variable winds locally to

Europeans win Nobel for prostaglandin studies

Dow tops 1000 as rates fall
New York Stock prices soared yesterday for the
fourth straight session in near-record trading as the Dow
Jones industrial average pierced the 1000-point mark for
the first time in 15 months amid growing belief interest
rates will keep falling.
"The stock market is responding to the same factors
that eventually will cause an economic recovery more
available and cheaper money," said Michael Metz, vice

Five stocks rose for every one that fell on the New
York Stock Exchange.
The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials, which rose 79
points last week, surged another 25.94 to 1012.79 its
highest since it finished at 1016.93 on April 28,1981. The
last time the closely watched measure closed above 1000
was June 23, 1981, when it stood at 1006.66. The average
has risen about 236 points in two months.
Trading volume also kept up its fierce pace. Some
138.53 million shares changed hands on the New York
Stock Exchange, the second-highest one-day total behind
the 147.07 million shares traded last Thursday. It was the

were everywhere, and at mid-morning an officer standing
in a Jeep was shouting through a bullhorn for everyone to
stay at home.
A group of angry Palestinian women asked to speak to
several French soldiers and United Nations observers
standing nearby: They said their husbands and sons had
been taken away earlier in the day, even though they were
1948 refugees with papers allowing them to live in Leba
non.
Both a French officer and a U.N. observer said there
was nothing they could do because it was "an internal
matter involving the Lebanese army and security in the
city.
One woman was nearly hysterical and shouted at the
soldiers and whoever else would listen, "I have no lights,
no water, no electricity, and now they come and take my
son and husband. Who is going to feed me?"
Before she could say more, a soldier pushed the group
away with the side of his gun and told them all to go
home. Photographers and television teams were banned
from the camps yesterday, apparently because of army
fears of just such scenes.
It was not known how many had been arrested in yes
terday's sweep of the camps, which have already been the
scene of intensive hunts for wanted persons by the Leba
nese Army and other security authorities.
Various persons interviewed, including a French of
ficer, told of seeing between 60 and 100 Palestinian men
taken away early in the morning in one part of Sabra
camp.
Tudor ship raised off English coast
Portsmouth, England After 437 years on the ocean
floor, the hull of the Mary Rose, flagship of King Henry
VIII's navy, was raised to the surface yesterday, capping
one of the greatest maritime archeological expeditions in
history.
Naval guns fired a salute and dozens of pleasure craft
tooted their horns amid cheers from the salvage team and
the operation's president and chief patron, Prince
Charles, as a steel crane rising 300 feet into the air lifted
the hull, nestled in a specially built frame, on to a trans
port barge, near the shoreline of this ancient seaport.
Charles made a 40-minute dive Sunday to take a look
at the hull, his tenth visit to the undersea sight since 1975.
He spent the night at Broadlands, home of Lord Romsey,
35 miles from here, so he could be on hand for the con
clusion of the historic salvage operation.
The maneuver took months to prepare and was de
layed by a host of technical problems, linked to the ex
treme delicacy of wresting the old timbers intact. As it ap
peared above the water line in the heavy mist of early
morning, the deep brown ribs looked like a weather
beaten basket; its decks and guns had been carefully re
moved.
"That's a damn strong ship," exclaimed Margaret
Rule, Mary Rose's chief archeologist.
The Mary Rose had been a tempting target for
salvagers from the moment it went down on July 19,
1545, within sight of Henry VIII, leading an English de
fense against French invaders. On board were 415 sailors,
300 soldiers, 91 cannons and, according to archeologists,
the most complete complement of Tudor period weapon
ry and personal items ever found in one place.
"It isa perfect time capsule," said Andrew Fielding, an
assistant director of the expedition. Since the ship sank
undamaged into the murky sediment of Portsmouth Har
bor, much of its contents have been preserved as though
encased in a protective coating. The effect, experts say, is
like the lava that poured over Pompeii.
So far in tens of thousands of dives over 11 years about
17,000 artifacts have been recovered and gradually are
being restored by teams of specialists in an operation that
has cost about $8 million. The Mary Rose Trust has al
ready become a major historical resource in a country
that has more history to honor than most.
Killings of Guatemalan Indians cited
Washington The military government of
Guatemala, hailed by the Reagan administration when it
took power seven months ago as a hope for an end to po
litical killings in the Central American country, has suf
fered two new blows to its fading prestige.
The London-based human-rights group Amnesty In
ternational made public yesterday a statement saying
government forces have "massacred more than 2600 In
dians and peasants in a new counterinsurgency program
launched after Gen. Efrain Rios Montt came to power in
March."

The statement was issued as the leaders of two
Guatemalan parties that had supported the coup that
brought Rios Montt to power were in Washington to
publicize their disillusionment with his government and
their demand that the military begin the process of hand
ing over power to an elected civilian government.
Guatemalan Ambassador Jose Zelaya Coronado de
nied the Amnesty International charges, saying soldiers
have "very precise instructions from the chief of staff to
respect civilians." He said he had seen a television ac
count showing the army retaking a village in northern
Huehuetenango Province that had been abandoned after
a guerrilla attack in January.

"The people were very grateful to the soldiers for the
way they had helped them," he said.
The ambassador conceded that "there may have been
some abuses, as there are everywhere, but the situation
has improved."
Asked about the political parties' apparent disillusion
ment with the government, Zelaya Coronado said the
military had no intention of remaining in power and was
making plans for a new election.
The issues of human rights and democratic rule are
crucial to efforts by administration officials to obtain mil
itary aid for Guatemala. Military aid was suspended in
1977 following charges that the Guatemalan government
was involved in widespread killing and torture of its op
ponents.
Since then Congress has watched Guatemala's human
rights record closely, and no further aid military has been
appropriated.
The House Foreign Affairs Committee has approved
$250,000 for military training, but the bill has not yet
passed. The administration has also expressed a desire to
sell Guatemala between $3.5 million and $4 million in
spare parts for planes and helicopters. But sources on
Capitol Hill said the proposed aid has failed to receive the
backing of the House Foreign Affairs Committee as re
quired under an informal agreement between the admin
istration and the committee.
'Crown jewel' of oil fields up for lease
Washington An icy stretch of water above Alaska
named Diapir Field may hold the biggest reserves of oil
and gas found in the United States in 14 years.
The oil industry is gearing up for the 1.8 million-acre
lease sale this week, which could bring in a record $3
billion in bids.
Many oil company officials believe the lease sale
tomorrow in Anchorage, Alaska, may be the most lucra
tive of the 41 sales to be offered in Interior Secretary
James Watt's leasing program.
Watt, whp has been attacked for the program offering
virtually the entire American coastline for drilling over
the next five years, is hoping the success of the sale will
silence critics.

"What we need is a big one something that will show
that the oil industry wants this land," Watt has said.
The Diapir Field, named for the type of geological for
mation, lies at the top of Alaska just offshore from the
Prudhoe Bay field, the 1968 discovery that supplies the
country with 18 percent of its domestic oil production.
Diapir's proximity to the Prudhoe field and the Alaska
oil pipeline is the reason the oil industry is excited.
The Interior Department puts the chance of finding
commerical quantities of oil and gas at 99.3 percent. It
estimates that Diapir holds 2.4 billion barrels of oil and
1.8 trillion cubic feet of gas.
"This is the crown jewel of the leasing program. Right
now it is the most promising area we want to get into,"
said Charles Matthews, president of the National Ocean
Industries Association, which represents almost 500
companies involved in offshore exploration and drilling.
Matthews said the bids could reach "between $2 billion
and $3 billion." That could make Diapir the most suc
cessful lease sale in the 28-year history of the federal pro
gram, surpassing a 1980 Gulf of Mexico sale which
brought the government $2.7 billion.
Interior Department officials are not that optimistic.
Watt has said that if the sale exceeds $ 1 billion it will be a
tremendous success. Officials point to the harsh Arctic
conditions that oil companies would have to face as one
reason the bids could be held down.
To compensate for the harsh conditions, Interior is de
manding lower royalty percentages on tracts in deeper
water and giving all successful bidders 10 years instead of
the normal five years to develop the leases.
Today's weather
Sunny and a little warmer today. Highs from the low
70s at the ocean to the low 80s. Variable winds locally to
20 mph in the late afternoon and evening. Clear tonight
with light winds and lows in the 50s. Sunny tomorrow
with highs a few degrees warmer.

Europeans win Nobel for prostaglandin studies

Stockholm Two Swedes and an Englishman yesterday won the 1982
Nobel Prize in medicine for their pioneering studies of potent natural
hormones that affect virtually every system in the human body, from fertility
to circulation of the blood.
Drs. Sune Bergstroem and Bengt Samuelsson, both of the Karolinska In
stitute in Stockholm, which helps award the prestigious prize, and Dr. John
Vane, of the British Wellcome Research Foundation Ltd., will share the
$157,000 prize, the first of the Nobel awards to be announced this year.
Karolinska Institute faculty members assist in selection of prize winners.
Bergstroem, who has long been considered a contender for the medicine
prize, is chairman of the board of directors of the Nobel Foundation, which
administers the award.
The three were cited for their discoveries concerning "prostaglandins and
related biologically active substances," which are locally produced chemical
messengers that function to defend cells against sudden changes caused by
stress, trauma or disease.
The substances, which are named after their original discovery in the pro
state gland, can have both positive and negative effects on the body.
The natural and synthetically produced prostaglandins and drugs that
counteract their effects have a wide range of present and potential uses in
medical treatment, in addition to the basic research leads offered by the dis-
covery of a new biological system.
Experts say that future prostaglandin research may
provide new avenues for treating the allergies that bother
so many people, as well as a possible means for prevent- >
ing heart attacks.
The Nobel committee noted that these chemicals are
already used in obstetrics and gynecology, serving to in
duce both abortion and childbirth. The prostaglandins
have also been used in the treatment of patients with
circulatory system disturbances and peptic ulcers.
Compounds that inhibit the action of prostaglandins
relieve pain caused by menstruation, gallstones and
kidney stones.
Vane, 55, was cited for his "fundamental" discovery a
decade ago that aspirin, one of the most common medica
tions for treating pain and inflammation, acts by block
ing the formation of prostaglandins and related
chemicals. He is a former University of London professor
who now directs group research and development at the
pharmaceutical foundation.
Yesterday's award to three non-American scientists
represented a break in the longstanding dominance of the
world's most prestigious medical prize by the United
States.
Fighting follows Polish union's ban
Gdansk, Poland Thousands of shipyard workers
staged an eight-hour strike yesterday to protest the dis
solution by parliament last week of the Solidarity inde
pendent trade union.
The strike was followed by four hours of street fighting
as special police armed with tear gas and water cannon
attempted to disperse workers and Solidarity supporters
who had gathered outside the gates of the giant Lenin
shipyard.
Police roadblocks were set up around the city and
many motorists were turned away.
Meanwhile, the official news agency PAP announced
the release of 308 people interned under martial law regu
lations, fulfilling a pledge by military ruler Gen. Wo
jciech Jaruzelski last Saturday that a substantial number
of those held, estimated to total more than 800, would be
freed.
The strike in Gdansk, the biggest the Baltic coast city
has seen since the early days of martial law, marked a sig
nificant change of tactics by the union. Until now most
protests against the martial law government here have
taken the form of short symbolic strikes or mass street de
mostrations.
The city, the birthplace of Solidarity, was quiet last
night, but many workers insisted that they would stage a
similar strike today.
Telephone and telex links with Gdansk were cut soon
after the strike began at 6 a.m. when the first shift re
ported for work at the shipyard.
Workers said that rather than wait for riot police to
storm the factories, they would leave at the end of the
shift and return every day.
Yesterday's strikes began after leaflets were distributed
in Gdansk signed by underground Solidarity leaders,
calling on workers to defend the union. A worker at the
Lenin shipyard said that the protest there had erupted
shortly after the start of the first shift.
The strikers at the Lenin shipyard were joined by work
ers in the neighboring repair shop yard and the northern
shipyard. Workers in several smaller enterprises also
joined in as did did workers at the Paris Commune ship
yard in nearby Gdynia.
The gates of the Lenin shipyard, from which Lech
Walesa addressed the striking workers in August 1980,
were once again festooned with flowers, Solidarity ban
ners and portraits of Pope John Paul 11. Slogans pasted to
the wall of the shipyard read, "Solidarity is still alive,"
and "We won't let Solidarity die."
Dow tops 1000 as rates fall
New York Stock prices soared yesterday for the
fourth straight session in near-record trading as the Dow
Jones industrial average pierced the 1000-point mark for
the first time in 15 months amid growing belief interest
rates will keep falling.
"The stock market is responding to the same factors
that eventually will cause an economic recovery more
available and cheaper money," said Michael Metz, vice
president of Oppenheimer & Co.
Five stocks rose for every one that fell on the New
York Stock Exchange.
The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials, which rose 79
points last week, surged another 25.94 to 1012.79 its
highest since it finished at 1016.93 on April 28,1981. The
last time the closely watched measure closed above 1000
was June 23, 1981, when it stood at 1006.66. The average
has risen about 236 points in two months.
Trading volume also kept up its fierce pace. Some
138.53 million shares changed hands on the New York
Stock Exchange, the second-highest one-day total behind
the 147.07 million shares traded last Thursday. It was the
third straight session in which volume surpassed 100 mil

lion shares and the 10th time since Aug. 18, which was the
first day volume ever exceeded 100 million shares.
The market, which often reacts to expectations, has
been rallying despite news showing the economy re
mained weak last month, such as the 10.1 percent un
employment rate reported Friday.
"You can't fight the tape; we're in a bull market," said
Alan Poole, vice president of Laidlaw, Adams & Peck
Inc.
The big factor cited for Wall Street's euphoria is in
vestors' perception that interest rates will keep falling and
spark recovery. With money costing less, consumers
should be encouraged to spend more especially on ex
pensive items requiring credit.
That would allow retailers to order more goods, spur
ring manufacturers to increase production and perhaps
hire back workers.
Also, investors and many market analysts are con
vinced that the decline in the inflation rate is not a fluke.
The Mellon Bank of Pittsburgh has cut its prime to
12.75 percent from 13.5 percent and many other big
banks now have 13 percent rates.
$2OO billion deficit projected for 1984
Washington The Reagan administration has begun
work on the 1984 budget with some internal projections
suggesting the deficit could be nearly $2OO billion in that
fiscal year if there are no further tax increases or spending
cuts.
That is far beyond the $B4 billion that Congress esti
mated for 1984 in the budget resolution approved last
spring, and would exceed even the $152 billion projected
just last month by the Congressional Budget Office.
The $2OO billion figure is not what the president will
propose. Rather, it is a measure of how large a problem
he will face as he works in the next few months to bring
down the deficit down to acceptable levels.
For political reasons, presidential aides have tried to
defer budget talk until after the Nov. 2 election. And
none of the major shaping decisions has yet been made;
the budget, which is for the year beginning next Oct. 1,
does not have to be sent to Congress until early next year.
The deficit estimates are starting points for the budget
process; they are guesses as to what the deficit would be
without any changes in current policy or law.
They assume the president will not flinch from his pres
ently planned defense buildup; he has indicated as much,
even though Congress, in the spring budget resolution,
called for some curtailment.
They also are based on the assumption that there will
be no tax increase. On the contrary, they assume that the
sizable tax cuts already voted by Congress for 1983 and
beyond will be allowed to take effect as planned. The
largest of these involves the so-called indexation of the in
dividual income tax beginning in 1985 to offset the tax ef
fects of inflation. Without indexation, many people auto
matically move into higher tax brackets each year as their
incomes rise.
The president, who was raked by conservatives for sup
porting this year's tax increase, was asked at his news
conference last month whether he would "flatly rule out
any tax increases" in 1984. "Unless there's a palace coup
and I'm overtaken or overthrown, no, I don't see the ne
cessity for that," he answered.
The deficit estimates further assume that the economy
will not improve dramatically by fiscal 1984, but will stay
on the slow-growth path the administration itself has of
ficially projected. Last year an optimistic economic fore
cast helped the president bring down the projected deficit
at budget time. This year he has a new chairman of the
Council of Economic Advisers, Martin Feldstein, who is
already on record as foreseeing only slow-to-moderate
growth, and who is regarded as most unlikely to let his
forecast be altered for political purposes.
Lebanese army searches camps
Beirut, Lebanon In a move that sent new tremors of
fear through the Palestinian refugee camps where hun
dreds of civilians were massacred by Christian militiamen
less than a month ago, the Lebanese army yesterday
sealed off and searched the camps house by house.
The sweep of the tense camps was the latest step in a
citv-wide operation aimed at uncovering hidden arms de
pots and arresting criminals and illegal aliens, which has
been going on now for days.
Lebanese security sources have reported the detention
of more than 500 persons, but other, unofficial, sources
put the total at more than a 1000. Some have been re
leased after an identity check and others deported. But
hundreds are still being held, among whom are reported
to be many Palestinians.

The arrest of Palestinians, in some cases by armed civil
ians identifying themselves as Lebanese security men, has
stirred fears throughouc the Palestinian community of a
second wave of persecution by the authorities. The gov
ernment has already made clear that it wants the vast ma
jority of the estimated 500,000 Palestinians in Lebanon to
leave as soon as possible.
The anxiety gripping the Palestinian camps of Sabra
and Shatila was clearly evident during a visit there yester
day. Armored cars and soldiers of the Lebanese Army

were everywhere, and at mid-morning an officer standing
in a Jeep was shouting through a bullhorn for everyone to
stay at home.
A group of angry Palestinian women asked to speak to
several French soldiers and United Nations observers
standing nearby: They said their husbands and sons had
been taken away earlier in the day, even though they were
1948 refugees with papers allowing them to live in Leba
non.
Both a French officer and a U.N. observer said there
was nothing they could do because it was "an internal
matter involving the Lebanese army and security in the
city.
One woman was nearly hysterical and shouted at the
soldiers and whoever else would listen, "I have no lights,
no water, no electricity, and now they come and take my
son and husband. Who is going to feed me?"
Before she could say more, a soldier pushed the group
away with the side of his gun and told them all to go
home. Photographers and television teams were banned
from the camps yesterday, apparently because of army
fears of just such scenes.
It was not known how many had been arrested in yes
terday's sweep of the camps, which have already been the
scene of intensive hunts for wanted persons by the Leba
nese Army and other security authorities.
Various persons interviewed, including a French of
ficer, told of seeing between 60 and 100 Palestinian men
taken away early in the morning in one part of Sabra
camp.
Tudor ship raised off English coast
Portsmouth, England After 437 years on the ocean

that has more history to honor than most.
Killings of Guatemalan Indians cited
Washington The military government of
Guatemala, hailed by the Reagan administration when it
took power seven months ago as a hope for an end to po
litical killings in the Central American country, has suf
fered two new blows to its fading prestige.
The London-based human-rights group Amnesty In

The issues of human rights and democratic rule are

1977 following charges that the Guatemalan government
was involved in widespread killing and torture of its op

Since then Congress has watched Guatemala's human
rights record closely, and no further aid military has been
appropriated.
The House Foreign Affairs Committee has approved
$250,000 for military training, but the bill has not yet
passed. The administration has also expressed a desire to
sell Guatemala between $3.5 million and $4 million in
spare parts for planes and helicopters. But sources on
Capitol Hill said the proposed aid has failed to receive the
backing of the House Foreign Affairs Committee as re
quired under an informal agreement between the admin
istration and the committee.
'Crown jewel' of oil fields up for lease
Washington An icy stretch of water above Alaska
named Diapir Field may hold the biggest reserves of oil
and gas found in the United States in 14 years.
The oil industry is gearing up for the 1.8 million-acre
lease sale this week, which could bring in a record $3
billion in bids.
Many oil company officials believe the lease sale
tomorrow in Anchorage, Alaska, may be the most lucra
tive of the 41 sales to be offered in Interior Secretary
James Watt's leasing program.
Watt, whp has been attacked for the program offering
virtually the entire American coastline for drilling over
the next five years, is hoping the success of the sale will
silence critics.

"What we need is a big one something that will show
that the oil industry wants this land," Watt has said.
The Diapir Field, named for the type of geological for

Prudhoe Bay field, the 1968 discovery that supplies the
country with 18 percent of its domestic oil production.
Diapir's proximity to the Prudhoe field and the Alaska
oil pipeline is the reason the oil industry is excited.
The Interior Department puts the chance of finding
commerical quantities of oil and gas at 99.3 percent. It
estimates that Diapir holds 2.4 billion barrels of oil and
1.8 trillion cubic feet of gas.
"This is the crown jewel of the leasing program. Right
now it is the most promising area we want to get into,"
said Charles Matthews, president of the National Ocean
Industries Association, which represents almost 500
companies involved in offshore exploration and drilling.
Matthews said the bids could reach "between $2 billion
and $3 billion." That could make Diapir the most suc
cessful lease sale in the 28-year history of the federal pro
gram, surpassing a 1980 Gulf of Mexico sale which
brought the government $2.7 billion.
Interior Department officials are not that optimistic.
Watt has said that if the sale exceeds $ 1 billion it will be a
tremendous success. Officials point to the harsh Arctic
conditions that oil companies would have to face as one
reason the bids could be held down.
To compensate for the harsh conditions, Interior is de
manding lower royalty percentages on tracts in deeper
water and giving all successful bidders 10 years instead of
the normal five years to develop the leases.

Europeans win Nobel for prostaglandin studies

in Gdansk signed by underground Solidarity leaders,
calling on workers to defend the union. A worker at the
Lenin shipyard said that the protest there had erupted
shortly after the start of the first shift.
The strikers at the Lenin shipyard were joined by work
ers in the neighboring repair shop yard and the northern
shipyard. Workers in several smaller enterprises also
joined in as did did workers at the Paris Commune ship
yard in nearby Gdynia.
The gates of the Lenin shipyard, from which Lech
Walesa addressed the striking workers in August 1980,
were once again festooned with flowers, Solidarity ban
ners and portraits of Pope John Paul 11. Slogans pasted to
the wall of the shipyard read, "Solidarity is still alive,"
and "We won't let Solidarity die."
Dow tops 1000 as rates fall
New York Stock prices soared yesterday for the
fourth straight session in near-record trading as the Dow
Jones industrial average pierced the 1000-point mark for
the first time in 15 months amid growing belief interest
rates will keep falling.
"The stock market is responding to the same factors
that eventually will cause an economic recovery more
available and cheaper money," said Michael Metz, vice
president of Oppenheimer & Co.
Five stocks rose for every one that fell on the New
York Stock Exchange.
The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials, which rose 79
points last week, surged another 25.94 to 1012.79 its
highest since it finished at 1016.93 on April 28,1981. The
last time the closely watched measure closed above 1000
was June 23, 1981, when it stood at 1006.66. The average
has risen about 236 points in two months.
Trading volume also kept up its fierce pace. Some
138.53 million shares changed hands on the New York
Stock Exchange, the second-highest one-day total behind
the 147.07 million shares traded last Thursday. It was the
third straight session in which volume surpassed 100 mil

lion shares and the 10th time since Aug. 18, which was the
first day volume ever exceeded 100 million shares.
The market, which often reacts to expectations, has
been rallying despite news showing the economy re
mained weak last month, such as the 10.1 percent un
employment rate reported Friday.
"You can't fight the tape; we're in a bull market," said
Alan Poole, vice president of Laidlaw, Adams & Peck
Inc.
The big factor cited for Wall Street's euphoria is in
vestors' perception that interest rates will keep falling and
spark recovery. With money costing less, consumers
should be encouraged to spend more especially on ex
pensive items requiring credit.
That would allow retailers to order more goods, spur
ring manufacturers to increase production and perhaps
hire back workers.
Also, investors and many market analysts are con
vinced that the decline in the inflation rate is not a fluke.
The Mellon Bank of Pittsburgh has cut its prime to
12.75 percent from 13.5 percent and many other big
banks now have 13 percent rates.
$2OO billion deficit projected for 1984
Washington The Reagan administration has begun
work on the 1984 budget with some internal projections
suggesting the deficit could be nearly $2OO billion in that
fiscal year if there are no further tax increases or spending
cuts.
That is far beyond the $B4 billion that Congress esti
mated for 1984 in the budget resolution approved last
spring, and would exceed even the $152 billion projected
just last month by the Congressional Budget Office.
The $2OO billion figure is not what the president will
propose. Rather, it is a measure of how large a problem
he will face as he works in the next few months to bring
down the deficit down to acceptable levels.
For political reasons, presidential aides have tried to
defer budget talk until after the Nov. 2 election. And
none of the major shaping decisions has yet been made;
the budget, which is for the year beginning next Oct. 1,
does not have to be sent to Congress until early next year.
The deficit estimates are starting points for the budget
process; they are guesses as to what the deficit would be
without any changes in current policy or law.
They assume the president will not flinch from his pres
ently planned defense buildup; he has indicated as much,
even though Congress, in the spring budget resolution,
called for some curtailment.
They also are based on the assumption that there will
be no tax increase. On the contrary, they assume that the
sizable tax cuts already voted by Congress for 1983 and
beyond will be allowed to take effect as planned. The
largest of these involves the so-called indexation of the in
dividual income tax beginning in 1985 to offset the tax ef
fects of inflation. Without indexation, many people auto
matically move into higher tax brackets each year as their
incomes rise.
The president, who was raked by conservatives for sup
porting this year's tax increase, was asked at his news
conference last month whether he would "flatly rule out
any tax increases" in 1984. "Unless there's a palace coup
and I'm overtaken or overthrown, no, I don't see the ne
cessity for that," he answered.
The deficit estimates further assume that the economy
will not improve dramatically by fiscal 1984, but will stay
on the slow-growth path the administration itself has of
ficially projected. Last year an optimistic economic fore
cast helped the president bring down the projected deficit
at budget time. This year he has a new chairman of the
Council of Economic Advisers, Martin Feldstein, who is
already on record as foreseeing only slow-to-moderate
growth, and who is regarded as most unlikely to let his
forecast be altered for political purposes.
Lebanese army searches camps
Beirut, Lebanon In a move that sent new tremors of
fear through the Palestinian refugee camps where hun
dreds of civilians were massacred by Christian militiamen
less than a month ago, the Lebanese army yesterday
sealed off and searched the camps house by house.
The sweep of the tense camps was the latest step in a
citv-wide operation aimed at uncovering hidden arms de
pots and arresting criminals and illegal aliens, which has
been going on now for days.
Lebanese security sources have reported the detention
of more than 500 persons, but other, unofficial, sources
put the total at more than a 1000. Some have been re
leased after an identity check and others deported. But
hundreds are still being held, among whom are reported
to be many Palestinians.

The arrest of Palestinians, in some cases by armed civil
ians identifying themselves as Lebanese security men, has
stirred fears throughouc the Palestinian community of a
second wave of persecution by the authorities. The gov
ernment has already made clear that it wants the vast ma
jority of the estimated 500,000 Palestinians in Lebanon to
leave as soon as possible.
The anxiety gripping the Palestinian camps of Sabra
and Shatila was clearly evident during a visit there yester
day. Armored cars and soldiers of the Lebanese Army

were everywhere, and at mid-morning an officer standing
in a Jeep was shouting through a bullhorn for everyone to
stay at home.
A group of angry Palestinian women asked to speak to
several French soldiers and United Nations observers
standing nearby: They said their husbands and sons had
been taken away earlier in the day, even though they were
1948 refugees with papers allowing them to live in Leba
non.
Both a French officer and a U.N. observer said there
was nothing they could do because it was "an internal
matter involving the Lebanese army and security in the
city.
One woman was nearly hysterical and shouted at the
soldiers and whoever else would listen, "I have no lights,
no water, no electricity, and now they come and take my
son and husband. Who is going to feed me?"
Before she could say more, a soldier pushed the group
away with the side of his gun and told them all to go
home. Photographers and television teams were banned
from the camps yesterday, apparently because of army
fears of just such scenes.
It was not known how many had been arrested in yes
terday's sweep of the camps, which have already been the
scene of intensive hunts for wanted persons by the Leba
nese Army and other security authorities.
Various persons interviewed, including a French of
ficer, told of seeing between 60 and 100 Palestinian men
taken away early in the morning in one part of Sabra
camp.
Tudor ship raised off English coast
Portsmouth, England After 437 years on the ocean
floor, the hull of the Mary Rose, flagship of King Henry
VIII's navy, was raised to the surface yesterday, capping
one of the greatest maritime archeological expeditions in
history.
Naval guns fired a salute and dozens of pleasure craft
tooted their horns amid cheers from the salvage team and
the operation's president and chief patron, Prince
Charles, as a steel crane rising 300 feet into the air lifted
the hull, nestled in a specially built frame, on to a trans
port barge, near the shoreline of this ancient seaport.
Charles made a 40-minute dive Sunday to take a look
at the hull, his tenth visit to the undersea sight since 1975.
He spent the night at Broadlands, home of Lord Romsey,
35 miles from here, so he could be on hand for the con
clusion of the historic salvage operation.
The maneuver took months to prepare and was de
layed by a host of technical problems, linked to the ex
treme delicacy of wresting the old timbers intact. As it ap
peared above the water line in the heavy mist of early
morning, the deep brown ribs looked like a weather
beaten basket; its decks and guns had been carefully re
moved.
"That's a damn strong ship," exclaimed Margaret
Rule, Mary Rose's chief archeologist.
The Mary Rose had been a tempting target for
salvagers from the moment it went down on July 19,
1545, within sight of Henry VIII, leading an English de
fense against French invaders. On board were 415 sailors,
300 soldiers, 91 cannons and, according to archeologists,
the most complete complement of Tudor period weapon
ry and personal items ever found in one place.
"It isa perfect time capsule," said Andrew Fielding, an
assistant director of the expedition. Since the ship sank
undamaged into the murky sediment of Portsmouth Har
bor, much of its contents have been preserved as though
encased in a protective coating. The effect, experts say, is
like the lava that poured over Pompeii.
So far in tens of thousands of dives over 11 years about
17,000 artifacts have been recovered and gradually are
being restored by teams of specialists in an operation that
has cost about $8 million. The Mary Rose Trust has al
ready become a major historical resource in a country
that has more history to honor than most.
Killings of Guatemalan Indians cited
Washington The military government of
Guatemala, hailed by the Reagan administration when it
took power seven months ago as a hope for an end to po
litical killings in the Central American country, has suf
fered two new blows to its fading prestige.
The London-based human-rights group Amnesty In
ternational made public yesterday a statement saying
government forces have "massacred more than 2600 In
dians and peasants in a new counterinsurgency program
launched after Gen. Efrain Rios Montt came to power in
March."

The statement was issued as the leaders of two
Guatemalan parties that had supported the coup that
brought Rios Montt to power were in Washington to
publicize their disillusionment with his government and
their demand that the military begin the process of hand
ing over power to an elected civilian government.
Guatemalan Ambassador Jose Zelaya Coronado de
nied the Amnesty International charges, saying soldiers
have "very precise instructions from the chief of staff to
respect civilians." He said he had seen a television ac
count showing the army retaking a village in northern
Huehuetenango Province that had been abandoned after
a guerrilla attack in January.

"The people were very grateful to the soldiers for the
way they had helped them," he said.
The ambassador conceded that "there may have been
some abuses, as there are everywhere, but the situation
has improved."
Asked about the political parties' apparent disillusion
ment with the government, Zelaya Coronado said the
military had no intention of remaining in power and was
making plans for a new election.
The issues of human rights and democratic rule are
crucial to efforts by administration officials to obtain mil
itary aid for Guatemala. Military aid was suspended in
1977 following charges that the Guatemalan government
was involved in widespread killing and torture of its op
ponents.
Since then Congress has watched Guatemala's human
rights record closely, and no further aid military has been
appropriated.
The House Foreign Affairs Committee has approved
$250,000 for military training, but the bill has not yet
passed. The administration has also expressed a desire to
sell Guatemala between $3.5 million and $4 million in
spare parts for planes and helicopters. But sources on
Capitol Hill said the proposed aid has failed to receive the
backing of the House Foreign Affairs Committee as re
quired under an informal agreement between the admin
istration and the committee.
'Crown jewel' of oil fields up for lease
Washington An icy stretch of water above Alaska
named Diapir Field may hold the biggest reserves of oil
and gas found in the United States in 14 years.
The oil industry is gearing up for the 1.8 million-acre
lease sale this week, which could bring in a record $3
billion in bids.
Many oil company officials believe the lease sale
tomorrow in Anchorage, Alaska, may be the most lucra
tive of the 41 sales to be offered in Interior Secretary
James Watt's leasing program.
Watt, whp has been attacked for the program offering
virtually the entire American coastline for drilling over
the next five years, is hoping the success of the sale will
silence critics.

"What we need is a big one something that will show
that the oil industry wants this land," Watt has said.
The Diapir Field, named for the type of geological for
mation, lies at the top of Alaska just offshore from the
Prudhoe Bay field, the 1968 discovery that supplies the
country with 18 percent of its domestic oil production.
Diapir's proximity to the Prudhoe field and the Alaska
oil pipeline is the reason the oil industry is excited.
The Interior Department puts the chance of finding
commerical quantities of oil and gas at 99.3 percent. It
estimates that Diapir holds 2.4 billion barrels of oil and
1.8 trillion cubic feet of gas.
"This is the crown jewel of the leasing program. Right
now it is the most promising area we want to get into,"
said Charles Matthews, president of the National Ocean
Industries Association, which represents almost 500
companies involved in offshore exploration and drilling.
Matthews said the bids could reach "between $2 billion
and $3 billion." That could make Diapir the most suc
cessful lease sale in the 28-year history of the federal pro
gram, surpassing a 1980 Gulf of Mexico sale which
brought the government $2.7 billion.
Interior Department officials are not that optimistic.
Watt has said that if the sale exceeds $ 1 billion it will be a
tremendous success. Officials point to the harsh Arctic
conditions that oil companies would have to face as one
reason the bids could be held down.
To compensate for the harsh conditions, Interior is de
manding lower royalty percentages on tracts in deeper
water and giving all successful bidders 10 years instead of
the normal five years to develop the leases.
