# Freshman no-shows here buck trend by decreasing
## 
### DAN TURNER 
As the cost of private education soars and federal
tuition assistance rates decrease, the question of ac
cessibility to private colleges becomes a source of anx
iety for many American families.
The New York Times , citing the increasing number
of "no-shows," students who send in a deposit to a
certain school but then decide not to enroll, reports
that private universities nationwide are losing
freshmen because of the current economic squeeze.
But while the sources quoted in the Times' story are
indeed suffering an increase of no-shows, still other
schools, particularly Ivy League institutions and other
major, private universities, notice no change or
even decreases â€”in the number of freshmen no
shows.
Take for instance, Stanford.
"Not only did more people initially accept our of
fers of admission, but far fewer dropped out than nor
mally do between May and the beginning of school,"
Fred Hargadon, University dean of admissions, told
the Daily.
Hargadon said he mistrusts news stories, such as the
one in the Times , which use only a few examples to

back up their claims. Stanford was not mentioned in
the article, although Hargadon says he was contacted
by the Times while the story was being written.
"They (the news media) have their story in mind
and if an experience doesn't fit the story, then it goes
by the board," he said.
Also gone by the board in the Times article is Yale
University, whose Director of Admissions Margaret
Dahl reports a somewhat smaller number of no-shows
this year than in the past.
"It may be that people are willing to make the sacri
fice for Harvard, Yale or Stanford, but not for schools
X, Y and Z," said Dahl in an effort to explain this
phenomenon. Likewise absent in the story is Prince
ton University, which reports no substantial change in
the number of forfeited deposits.
What Dahl termed making the sacrifice, however,
cannot be divorced from these universities' commit
ments to meeting the financial need of the students it
admits: a policy known as aid blind admissions. While
many major universities have the historical commit
ment to the principle and the capital to back it up
smaller schools are indeed feeling the pinch, as evi
denced in the no-show statistics.

One such school is the University of the Pacific in
Stockton (UOP).
E. Leslie Medford, director of admissions there,
says this shift may mean that UOP will have to simply
have to accept more applications in the future, in an
ticipation of more cancellations. This will not affect
UOP's policy of accepting applications regardless of
financial status, says Medford.
"It occurs to me that if some schools are experienc
ing more no-shows, then it must be happening the op
posite way at others," Hargadon said. "I don't think
there is any indication that students aren't going to
college .. . every college always has some people who
change their minds. But it does work both ways; they
may be changing their minds about one school, but at
the same time they are deciding to enroll at another."
Very few admissions directors at private colleges
would admit that there is an oncoming trend to forego
the high cost of private schooling for a cheaper public
education. Whether this trend exists or not is ques
tionable, they say, and colleges like Stanford seem
least likely in any event to be hurt, because the Univer
sity has a guaranteed financial aid policy.
