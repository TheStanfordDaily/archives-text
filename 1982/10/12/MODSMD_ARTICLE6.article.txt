## Gaieties 1982 Dancers, singers, actors, directors, technicians etc. The 						history 
### HUBERT CHENG 
All the thrills, excitement and total nonsense
of Big Game Week explode on stage as Gaieties
'B2 debuts with three performances November
18 and 19.
Gaieties, an annual musical event before Big
Game, is entirely acted, written, produced and
directed by students. The Ram's Head drama
organization coordinates the event, which ori
ginally dates back to 1911.
With the title "Waiting for Big Game," this
year's production continues the tradition of
poking fun at Stanford, UC-Berkeley and the
fun and mayhem before and during Big Game.
"Of course, Dean of Admissions Fred
Hargadon also makes his annual cameo ap
pearance," said Gaities Producer Debbie In
gram.
Both Ram's Head and Gaieties First began in
1911, continuing until the 19605, when student
unrest and disinterest forced Ram's Head to
fold. The organization was revived in 1975, with
the new Gaieties making its appearance two
years later. Since then, shows with such cryptic
titles as "Big Games We Play," "Stanford Can
Wait," and "Big Game Beach Blanket Bingo,"
have debuted.

The entire Gaieties production is student-run
and organized. Last spring Ram's Head mem
bers wrote the script and music, also choosing
production staff and technical crews. Auditions
were judged on singing, dancing and acting abil
ity, with the final cast list posted October 9. The
nearly 60 member cast began rehearsals im
mediately thereafter.
"However, there are still many behind-the
scenes positions available and we're looking for
anyone interested to help out," Ram's Head
Executive Producer Vince Foecke said. He em
phasized that experience is not necessary, nor is
membership in the Ram's Head organization.
"You become a member by just participating in
a show," he said.
In addition to the yearly Gaieties, Ram's
Head also presents The Original Winter One
Acts, various single act plays written and acted
by students. Ram's Head annual spring musical
will be "Hello, Dolly."
