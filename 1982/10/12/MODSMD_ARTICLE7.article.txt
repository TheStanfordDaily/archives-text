# The 						auditions
## 
### CAROL CINI 
If you had ventured into Memorial
Auditorium last Wednesday or Thursday night
to take a peek at auditions for the annual
Gaieties, what you observed there might have
conjured up images of the rehearsal scenes in
"A Chorus Line."
Clad in sweats and different-colored t-shirts,
the students participating in dance auditions for
Gaieties were giving their all. Dancing to the
music of "Fame," choreographers Cindi Flippo
and Susan Keefe, dressed in bright leotards and
tights, led the auditioniers.
Freshman Donna Anderson, who auditioned
Wednesday night, said the try-outs "were ex
hilarating. Everybody really threw themselves
into it."
Director Eric Abrams, a sophomore who
directed Lagunita's "The Wiz" in his freshman
year, was hoping to find "a lot of energy and a
willingness to work" in the students who audi
tioned.
"Talent, of course, is important," he said,
"but we're of the feeling that if you want to
work hard enough, we can beat the talent into
you."

According to stage manager Andrew Dux
bury, 160 students signed up for the auditions,
and from this number the director, assistant di
rectors, choreographers and choral director
selected a cast of about 30. The cast will include
a "strong corps of eight to 10 dancers," said
Keefe. The cast list was posted last Saturday.
According to Duxbury, most of those audi
tioning were freshmen, although as Keefe
pointed out, "all four classes will be repre

sented" in the cast.
Tom Howell, a graduate student whose un
dergraduate major was product design, said he
tried out because, "I always wanted to sing and
dance on stage in front of lots of people."
Howell sang "On the Street Where You Live,"
for his vocal audition, and said his performance
was "not my best, but not too bad."
He has performed before here at Stanford
and said of auditions in general that, "You're
always frightened and always nervous. That's
why you do it."
Freshman Allison Fonte was sitting in a row
of the audience practicing lines of the script
with Howell before they went on stage to read
for the directors. Fonte has been in high school
productions, but said she "was a little bit ner
vous because after freshman orientation I lost
my voice."
"I liked it," she continued, "because people
here are really friendly, low-key. It's not like a
serious audition. I mean, look at them (the di
rectors): they have hats on. It shows that this
productions will probably be a lot of fun."
Fonte pointed to Abrams and the two assis
tant directors who were wearing different col
ored baseball caps that asserted their own indi
viduality. A white unicorn's horn projected
from Abrams' blue cap and sophomore Renee

Tenzel's orange cap was topped by a green al
ligator with its red mouth open and white teeth
showing. *
Sophomore Martin Levson wore a blue cap
with yellow ram's horns, which he called the
Ram's Head hat, referring to the student-run
dramatic organization that produces Gaieties.
Levson said the directors were looking for "a
certain degree of professionalism, but also a
feeling of fun and enjoyment." Before the audi
tions, he said, "I'm going to attempt to make it
as painless as possible. We all will."
Freshman Nick Rowen tried out because he
was "interested in getting into a fun show. I had
a lot of fun even though I had no dancing or
singing experience.
"The try-outs were very well organized," he
continued. "They had it down to an art cycl
ing people through and not making people feel
uncomfortable. The directors, the choreo
graphers and the choral director all did a very
good job helping people through what is nor
mally a very tense try-out."
Anderson added, "The people who were in
charge of each of the separate areas it's like
they wanted us to learn, they wanted us to enjoy
ourselves. All night they kept saying, 'Relax, re
lax.' "
Students who auditioned came to Memorial
Auditorium for one of the two-hour try-outs
Oct. 6-7. During the two-hour section, the
group of auditioners were divided in two, with
half sent to the lobby for dance warm-ups re

turning later for try-outs on stage and the
other half remaining in the auditorium for vocal
auditions.
On stage at the piano, choral director Susan
Silverman was warming up student voices, run
ning through the scales and leading vocal ex
ercises. Last year as a freshman, she was the or
chestra pianist for Gaieties.
"I'm not looking for opera stars," the choral
director said. "Gaieties is the perfect place for
people who haven't had any previous ex
perience."
Freshman Gabrielle Glaser said she sang in
her high school's swing choir. "This was the
first time I ever tried out for anything," she said.
"I'm just trying out for fun and I expected ev
eryone else to be very experienced, and when I
found out that everyone wasn't, I felt better."
Trying out for Gaieties was the First time
sophomore Heather Roy had auditioned for a
dramatic production. "Last year I was im
pressed with how good Gaities was," she said.
For her vocal audition on stage, Roy sang
"My Favorite Things" and said the try-out was
scary: "It's not that bad once you get started,
but it's really bad before you get started."

director said. "Gaieties is the perfect place for
people who haven't had any previous ex
perience."
Freshman Gabrielle Glaser said she sang in
her high school's swing choir. "This was the
first time I ever tried out for anything," she said.
"I'm just trying out for fun and I expected ev
eryone else to be very experienced, and when I
found out that everyone wasn't, I felt better."
Trying out for Gaieties was the First time
sophomore Heather Roy had auditioned for a
dramatic production. "Last year I was im
pressed with how good Gaities was," she said.
For her vocal audition on stage, Roy sang
"My Favorite Things" and said the try-out was
scary: "It's not that bad once you get started,
but it's really bad before you get started."

If you had ventured into Memorial
Auditorium last Wednesday or Thursday night
to take a peek at auditions for the annual
Gaieties, what you observed there might have
conjured up images of the rehearsal scenes in
"A Chorus Line."
Clad in sweats and different-colored t-shirts,
the students participating in dance auditions for
Gaieties were giving their all. Dancing to the
music of "Fame," choreographers Cindi Flippo
and Susan Keefe, dressed in bright leotards and
tights, led the auditioniers.
Freshman Donna Anderson, who auditioned
Wednesday night, said the try-outs "were ex
hilarating. Everybody really threw themselves
into it."
Director Eric Abrams, a sophomore who
directed Lagunita's "The Wiz" in his freshman
year, was hoping to find "a lot of energy and a
willingness to work" in the students who audi
tioned.
"Talent, of course, is important," he said,
"but we're of the feeling that if you want to
work hard enough, we can beat the talent into
you."

According to stage manager Andrew Dux
bury, 160 students signed up for the auditions,
and from this number the director, assistant di
rectors, choreographers and choral director
selected a cast of about 30. The cast will include
a "strong corps of eight to 10 dancers," said
Keefe. The cast list was posted last Saturday.
According to Duxbury, most of those audi
tioning were freshmen, although as Keefe
pointed out, "all four classes will be repre

sented" in the cast.
Tom Howell, a graduate student whose un
dergraduate major was product design, said he
tried out because, "I always wanted to sing and
dance on stage in front of lots of people."
Howell sang "On the Street Where You Live,"
for his vocal audition, and said his performance
was "not my best, but not too bad."
He has performed before here at Stanford
and said of auditions in general that, "You're
always frightened and always nervous. That's
why you do it."
Freshman Allison Fonte was sitting in a row
of the audience practicing lines of the script
with Howell before they went on stage to read
for the directors. Fonte has been in high school
productions, but said she "was a little bit ner
vous because after freshman orientation I lost
my voice."
"I liked it," she continued, "because people
here are really friendly, low-key. It's not like a
serious audition. I mean, look at them (the di
rectors): they have hats on. It shows that this
productions will probably be a lot of fun."
Fonte pointed to Abrams and the two assis
tant directors who were wearing different col
ored baseball caps that asserted their own indi
viduality. A white unicorn's horn projected
from Abrams' blue cap and sophomore Renee

Tenzel's orange cap was topped by a green al
ligator with its red mouth open and white teeth
showing. *
Sophomore Martin Levson wore a blue cap
with yellow ram's horns, which he called the
Ram's Head hat, referring to the student-run
dramatic organization that produces Gaieties.
Levson said the directors were looking for "a
certain degree of professionalism, but also a
feeling of fun and enjoyment." Before the audi
tions, he said, "I'm going to attempt to make it
as painless as possible. We all will."
Freshman Nick Rowen tried out because he
was "interested in getting into a fun show. I had
a lot of fun even though I had no dancing or
singing experience.
"The try-outs were very well organized," he
continued. "They had it down to an art cycl
ing people through and not making people feel
uncomfortable. The directors, the choreo
graphers and the choral director all did a very
good job helping people through what is nor
mally a very tense try-out."
Anderson added, "The people who were in
charge of each of the separate areas it's like
they wanted us to learn, they wanted us to enjoy
ourselves. All night they kept saying, 'Relax, re
lax.' "
Students who auditioned came to Memorial
Auditorium for one of the two-hour try-outs
Oct. 6-7. During the two-hour section, the
group of auditioners were divided in two, with
half sent to the lobby for dance warm-ups re

turning later for try-outs on stage and the
other half remaining in the auditorium for vocal
auditions.
On stage at the piano, choral director Susan
Silverman was warming up student voices, run
ning through the scales and leading vocal ex
ercises. Last year as a freshman, she was the or
chestra pianist for Gaieties.
"I'm not looking for opera stars," the choral
director said. "Gaieties is the perfect place for
people who haven't had any previous ex
perience."
