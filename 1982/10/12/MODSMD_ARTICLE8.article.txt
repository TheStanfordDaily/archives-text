# The 						song and dance

### SANDRA BODOVITZ 
There's more to Gaieties than acting. In fact,
such a big job is it to prepare the music and
dancing for this fall's production that or
chestral director and composer Lita Libaek,
choral director Susan Silverman and choreo
graphers Cindi Flippo and Susan Keefe have
been at it since last spring.
Libaek composed all the musical numbers
but one for this year's Gaities as well as con
tributing to the script. Along with Steve
Bushwall and Chris Scheck, Libaek is respon
sible for the show's amusing lyrics.
As orchestral director, Libaek said this year's
orchestra will be smaller than last year's. This
reduction is an effort to eliminate the problem
of the orchestra overpowering the vocalists. De
spite this change in size, one of the orchestra's
old and well-received traditions will remain
arrangements of the themes from TV com
mercials will still be played during set changes,
because the audience seems to enjoy the chance
to participate.
Libaek is a graduate of a music conservatory
and has been involved in the productions of
West Side Story, Godspell, Side by Side and
Cabaret at Stanford. She said she enjoys the on
campus productions because anyone, not just

drama majors, can get involved.
A case in point is Gaieties, Libaek said, be
cause it is a place where freshmen and transfer
students can begin drama careers. Stanford is
unique in producing an original student-written
show every year to start Big Game festivities,
she added. This is the fourth Gaieties in which
she has been involved.
Libaek began writing the music for th~ 'B2
Gaieties last winter after interviewing with the
producer and production staff to attain her
position. She and vocal director Silverman have
met to discuss interpretations of Libaek's mu
sic, as Silverman works directly with the vocal
ists. Both Libaek and Silverman have already
devoted lots of time to Gaieties and recently
have been putting in four or five hours a night
with vocal and instrumental auditions.
Silverman is an accomplished pianist and
harpsichordist. She ha& had experience working
as an accompaniest for singers as well as direct
ing them. She was also musical director for high
school productions, and was involved in the
Ram's Head production of Cabaret last spring.
Silverman said that she is aiming for a quality
production while still making Gaieties a good
learning and sharing experience for those in
volved.
Choreographers Flippo and Keefe both have
extensive experience as well. Both of them were
in last year's Gaieties and in Cabaret. Flippo
has been dancing since she was 10. She has been
in several U.S. dance companies and is current
ly dancing with an off-campus group. Keefe has
been dancing off and on since she was five.
Flippo and Keefe hope to form a solid corps
of dancers for this year's show and will work
closely with the musical directors in planning
their numbers.
Last spring they danced their ways to their
positions as choreographers. They worked with
a tentative script this summer and formulated
ideas for some dance numbers. Recently they
have been putting in up to eight or nine hours a
day.
Everyone who auditioned for Gaieties had to
sing, dance and act. This year, a record 160 peo
ple auditioned for the "Fall Classic."
