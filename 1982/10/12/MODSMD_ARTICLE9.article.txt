### PETER HAVEN 
The sign on Timothy Bigelow's door in ATO
house reads "Don't be afraid to ask dumb ques
tions. They are easier to handle than dumb mis
takes."
It is the kind of motto you might expect to
find on the door of the head writer for this
year's production of Gaieties. It is also the kind
of motto which suits Tim Bigelow's personality
to the letter.
Tim Bigelow, or "Tea Bag" as he is more fre-
N quently known, is definitely not afraid to do,
ask or say anything that is ridiculous. One
might even think he works at it as much as he
works on stage writing. In any event, "Tea Bag"
is not run-of-the-mill.

"For one thing, I get a little sarcastic about
small talk like 'Hello, how are you? How are
your classes? How's the weather?,' " he said. "I
try to interject a little sarcasm into a conversa
tion," says Bigelow, who has earned a reputa
tion for being a little strange, to say thejeast.
Bigelow's spontaneous remarks usually leave
those who are not accustomed to them left pon
dering his sanity. Nevertheless, they have not
failed him on stage.
His character suits him well, in particular, for
the pre-Big Game extravaganza of Gaieties, a
kind of musical variety show of sorts. Bigelow
likens it to a pep rally.
"It's basically amphetamines on stage. You
come to be entertained and carried away by
Stanford's loathing of Cal. Some years it's like a
variety show. Last year it was like a review,"
says Bigelow.
"My job as head writer is to get the wheels
moving. If we run into problems, I get them

back on track. I'm the director of the writers."
After trying out and playing the role of a
"Berkeley Bozo" in Gaieties during his|
sophomore year, Bigelow switched to writing
the following season. He eventually ended up
with the head writer's spot. It is a job that keeps
him hopping from place to place.
"Everybody involved is a student, and it de
mands a fair amount of time. It takes imagina
tion and imagination sometimes takes a lot of
time," Bigelow commented.

Despite his propensity for glib remarks,
Bigelow becomes understandably tight-lipped
when it comes to talking about this year's
Gaieties. The best one can pry out of him is a
mischievious chuckle followed by a sly smile.
The look in his eyes really makes you wonder
about the work he and his fellow writers have
been up to.
"I don't want to spoil the surprise," he says.
About all one can get out of him is that the
theme for this, year will be "Waiting for Big
Game."
The chore of preparing for Gaieties from a
writer's standpoint begins early in the spring of
the previous year.
"We (writers) get together and toss around
ideas in the springtime. We all agree on ideas we
like, then we get down to the nitty-gritty stuff.
Once we've determined that, we ask who wants
which scene. We usually have more writers than
scenes, so we pair up. We also get together occa
sionally to critique each other's work."
One might think that some of this critiquing (
sessions would get out of hand if somebody's
ego gets stepped on too heavily. Bigelow, how
ever, quickly dispells such thoughts.
"One of these writers had a crowbar stuck
through his chest after a critiquing session, but
other than that, no problem.
"That's actually fictitious. Really there are
no personality conflicts," says Bigelow. "The
writers are just a bunch of fun-loving college
kids. We write just for the hell of it."
And so Tim Bigelow rolls along, always
seemimg to spread himself too thin. You don't
sit down and talk with "Tea Bag," but instead
catch him in between his geology class and an
audition. He is the kind of guy it seems who
downs a peanut butter sandwich for lunch
before a voice lesson.
He will tell you he doesn't have time to un
wind and that he does not want to even if he
could.
