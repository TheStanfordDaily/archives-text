# Guest Prof. Bureau works without leader

### MICHAEL DONOHOE 
Lack of a permanent director has not
kept the ASSU Guest Professorship
Bureau from attempting to bring guest
professors to campus this year and Rep.
Paul "Pete" McCloskey (R-Menlo
Park) is the leading candidate for such a
bid.
McCloskey has expressed interest in
teaching a class this spring, according
to Interim Director Cynthia
Mathewson, a member ot the council of
presidents.
She said a new director should be
chosen by early next week, adding that
applications for the position will be ac
cepted by the ASSU office until this Fri
day.
Another project sponsored by the bu
reau that is well under way, according
to Mathewson, is a class being or
ganized by Tom Roth and Dave Marks
to be taught winter quarter by several
fellows from the Hoover Institution.
The current plans are to have this
course approved for winter quarter and
to have one or two courses taught by
guest professors during spring quarter.
According to Mathewson, letters have
been sent to McCloskey and other pos
sible guest professors and the final de
cisions on who will be brought here this
year will be announced later.
Luke Cole, director of the bureau last
year and a member instrumental in the
process of attracting John Anderson
two vears ago, described the Guest Pro
fessorship Bureau this way: "It is the
only resource on campus where stu
dents can come and say 'I want to see
so-and-so teach.' "
Cole also said it is very difficult to at
tract big names. "We are pulling these
people out of the mainstream of their
professions; they are not professors.
They bring a practical viewpoint that is
very difficult to get at Stanford."
The overall success of the program is
a subject of some debate among stu
dents and faculty. Last year the bureau
did not even apply for an ASSU fee
assessment. According to Cole, this was
due to the mediocre performance of the
bureau during the 1981-82 school year.
The reason the bureau does not have
a permanent director is that the student
chosen to serve as director last winter,
Robert Greenberg, decided over the
summer to go overseas to attend the
London School of Economics.
In the last two years the bureau has
brought several professionals from dif
ferent backgrounds here, including
John Anderson, a former presidential
candidate, (Catherine MacKinnon, a
noted feminist, and Bill Griffith,
creator of "Zippy the Pinhead."
