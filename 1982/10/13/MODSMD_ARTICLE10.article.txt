### CHITRA SUBRAMANIAM 
Israel Shahak was born in 1933
in Warsaw, Poland. He spent two
years in the Bergen-Belsen con
centration camp between the ages
of 10 and 12, and moved to Jerusa
lem in 1945. A visiting scholar in
the department of organic
chemistry at Stanford in 1963, he
is currently professor of organic
chemistry at the Hebrew Univer
sity in Jerusalem. He is also the
Chairman of the Israeli League
for Human and Civil Rights, and
has written extensively about
abuses of human rights in Israel.
He testified before the House For
eign Affairs Committee on the
treatment of Palestinians. Cur
rently on a tour of the United
States, he was interviewed by the
Daily .Excerpts:
Daily: What was the cause of
the war in Lebanon?
Shahak: There were two
causes, one particular, and the
other which went beyond the im
mediate. The particular cause,
and this was well-known in Is
rael, was to destroy the Palesti
nians as a political entity by de
stroying the PLO in Lebanon. Of
course, this failed. But the people
who rule Israel felt that if they ex
pel the PLO from Lebanon, the
Palestinians would accept their
lot which is perhaps similar or
even worse than the blacks in
South Africa. I would like to say
here the Israel alliance with
South Africa is not only because
of strategic interests, but also be
cause of similarities in ideology.

But in addition to this particular
cause, there was also the main
reason, and this was brought out
in an article in Ha'aretz, Israel's
leading newspaper. According to
that, Begin and Sharon desire to
dominate the Middle East and
this means that they want to be
the only military power in the re
gion. In keeping with this reason,
the war in Lebanon is directed
not only against the Lebanese
and the Palestinians, but also

desire to dominate the

power in the region. In

against Syria and
Jordan. *

against Syria and Jordan. You
have heard about the many
threats which Sharon has issued
to Jordan and also to Syria and in
fact there is Sharon's grand

strategy which has been an
nounced through many official
declarations and speeches from
December 1981. According to
that, Israel wants to dominate the
Middle East, and from the
Middle East it wants to have pre
dominant strategic interest in the
area all the way to Pakistan, Mo
rocco and Kenya. In pure mili
tary terms, that is in terms of
tanks and aeroplanes and quan
tities of weapons, Israel is the
fourth superpower after the
United States, Soviet Union and
China. What it lacks is money.
Domination in the Middle East
will mean a system where Israel
will exact money from the Arab
oil states, Syria and Jordan will
be crushed and Kuwait and some
other countries will pay money
not to be invaded. This design
has been the reason for the cool
ing off of relations between the
United States and Israel because
after two-and-a-half months in
the war, American officials re
alized what Sharon really had in
mind. America wants to have cer
tain spheres of influence in the
Middle East and Israel has the
very same designs.
Daily: What has been the im
pact of the war on the people in the
West Bank and Gaza, Lebanon
and Israel?
Shahak: The Palestinians in
the West Bank and Gaza were
shocked by the magnitude of the
invasion, and they remained so
until the massacres in the refugee
camps. There was no organized

protest. I am sorry to say that.
The'reason for this, contrary to
Israeli public opinion, was that
the Palestinians were not pre
pared for the invasion. But there
is also another reason which is

'You cannot organize
support for anything
against the
government in Israel
if the people feel that
the United States is
supporting Israel.'

due to one of the serious mistakes
of the PLO. The PLO propagated
a strategy according to which
they felt that if they withstood the
Israeli attack for some time, the
other Arab states, compelled by
their peoples, would rise to sup
port it. But this strategy is wrong,
and it has been wrong for at least
10 years, if not more. This did not
happen, and by the time the PLO
realized this, it was too late.
About Lebanon, well, the
atrocities there have been un
precedented. Most of the Palesti
nian males between the ages of
16-40 have simply disappeared. I
do not believe that many of them
are alive because the number of
prisoners is too little to include
them. If you go the refugee camps
you just do not see able-bodied
males and only about 5 percent of

the families have grown-up male
members. More recently in oc
cupied Lebanon, Palestinian
children are denied access to
schools. There have also been
certain trade restrictions im
posed in the area. Both Israel and
Lebanon have the same kind of
soil and climatic conditions, and
they grow the same kinds of fruits
and vegetables. This puts them
into competition with each other.
So now there is a new rule where
by Lebanese peasants are not al
lowed to sell their products
before 10 a.m., until which time
the markets sell only Israeli prod
ucts. Also, movement of goods
from Israel to Lebanon is being
encouraged while the reverse has
been stopped.
In Israel, there was always a
small percentage of the popu
lation that opposed the war.
When the soldiers returned from
the front — towards the end of
June — and told some things
about what was happening, some
resistance began, but then there
was the following problem. To
make a real protest, you must
have some political base, and in
Israel this means the Labor party
or another organization called
Peace Now, and both these or
ganizations are pro-American.
They expect the Americans to ap
ply pressure on Begin — they will
not move in a situation in which
they are sure that America sup
ports Begin and Sharon. So, the
first protests continued until
about July 10 after which they

stopped. There were of course
small protests, but nothing ma
jor. You cannot organize support
for anything against the govern
ment in Israel if the people feel
that the United States is support
ing Israel. It is a matter of fact
that the bigger protests started
after the famous phone call that
Reagan made to Begin after the
bombing of Beirut, and more af
ter Reagan announced his plan.
Not that his plan is very impor
tant bv itself, but because it was
the first sign that America had a
policy that differed from Begin's.
This was the base on which the
outrage against the massacre in
the refugee camps was built and

this protest reached about a third
of the population. Only after the
18 and 19 of September, when
there was a combination of moral
outrage and a feeling that Ameri
can public opinion and the Amer
ican government was critical of
Begin, was there a situation when
a third of the people were protest
ing against Begin, a third were
supporting him, and a third
were confused. Now this situ
ation alone is not enough to de
feat Begin and he will remain in
power if the situation remains as
it is. It can change only if there is
a change in the American public
opinion or if there is a change in
