# Touring professor attacks Israeli government's policies, actions in Lebanon
## 
### CHITRA SUBRAMANIAM 
Israel Shahak was born in 1933
in Warsaw, Poland. He spent two
years in the Bergen-Belsen con
centration camp between the ages
of 10 and 12, and moved to Jerusa
lem in 1945. A visiting scholar in
the department of organic
chemistry at Stanford in 1963, he
is currently professor of organic
chemistry at the Hebrew Univer
sity in Jerusalem. He is also the
Chairman of the Israeli League
for Human and Civil Rights, and
has written extensively about
abuses of human rights in Israel.
He testified before the House For
eign Affairs Committee on the
treatment of Palestinians. Cur
rently on a tour of the United
States, he was interviewed by the
Daily .Excerpts:
Daily: What was the cause of
the war in Lebanon?
Shahak: There were two
causes, one particular, and the
other which went beyond the im
mediate. The particular cause,
and this was well-known in Is
rael, was to destroy the Palesti
nians as a political entity by de
stroying the PLO in Lebanon. Of
course, this failed. But the people
who rule Israel felt that if they ex
pel the PLO from Lebanon, the
Palestinians would accept their
lot which is perhaps similar or
even worse than the blacks in
South Africa. I would like to say
here the Israel alliance with
South Africa is not only because
of strategic interests, but also be
cause of similarities in ideology.

But in addition to this particular
cause, there was also the main
reason, and this was brought out
in an article in Ha'aretz, Israel's
leading newspaper. According to
that, Begin and Sharon desire to
dominate the Middle East and
this means that they want to be
the only military power in the re
gion. In keeping with this reason,
the war in Lebanon is directed
not only against the Lebanese
and the Palestinians, but also

'Begin and Sharon
desire to dominate the
Middle East, and this
means that they want
to he the only military
power in the region. In
keeping with this
reason, the war in
Lebanon is directed
not only against the
Lebanese and the
Palestinians, but also
against Syria and
Jordan. *

against Syria and Jordan. You
have heard about the many
threats which Sharon has issued
to Jordan and also to Syria and in
fact there is Sharon's grand

strategy which has been an
nounced through many official
declarations and speeches from
December 1981. According to
that, Israel wants to dominate the
Middle East, and from the
Middle East it wants to have pre
dominant strategic interest in the
area all the way to Pakistan, Mo
rocco and Kenya. In pure mili
tary terms, that is in terms of
tanks and aeroplanes and quan
tities of weapons, Israel is the
fourth superpower after the
United States, Soviet Union and
China. What it lacks is money.
Domination in the Middle East
will mean a system where Israel
will exact money from the Arab
oil states, Syria and Jordan will
be crushed and Kuwait and some
other countries will pay money
not to be invaded. This design
has been the reason for the cool
ing off of relations between the
United States and Israel because
after two-and-a-half months in
the war, American officials re
alized what Sharon really had in
mind. America wants to have cer
tain spheres of influence in the
Middle East and Israel has the
very same designs.
Daily: What has been the im
pact of the war on the people in the
West Bank and Gaza, Lebanon
and Israel?
Shahak: The Palestinians in
the West Bank and Gaza were
shocked by the magnitude of the
invasion, and they remained so
until the massacres in the refugee
camps. There was no organized

protest. I am sorry to say that.
The'reason for this, contrary to
Israeli public opinion, was that
the Palestinians were not pre
pared for the invasion. But there
is also another reason which is

'You cannot organize
support for anything
against the
government in Israel
if the people feel that
the United States is
supporting Israel.'

due to one of the serious mistakes
of the PLO. The PLO propagated
a strategy according to which
they felt that if they withstood the
Israeli attack for some time, the
other Arab states, compelled by
their peoples, would rise to sup
port it. But this strategy is wrong,
and it has been wrong for at least
10 years, if not more. This did not
happen, and by the time the PLO
realized this, it was too late.
About Lebanon, well, the
atrocities there have been un
precedented. Most of the Palesti
nian males between the ages of
16-40 have simply disappeared. I
do not believe that many of them
are alive because the number of
prisoners is too little to include
them. If you go the refugee camps
you just do not see able-bodied
males and only about 5 percent of

the families have grown-up male
members. More recently in oc
cupied Lebanon, Palestinian
children are denied access to
schools. There have also been
certain trade restrictions im
posed in the area. Both Israel and
Lebanon have the same kind of
soil and climatic conditions, and
they grow the same kinds of fruits
and vegetables. This puts them
into competition with each other.
So now there is a new rule where
by Lebanese peasants are not al
lowed to sell their products
before 10 a.m., until which time
the markets sell only Israeli prod
ucts. Also, movement of goods
from Israel to Lebanon is being
encouraged while the reverse has
been stopped.
In Israel, there was always a
small percentage of the popu
lation that opposed the war.
When the soldiers returned from
the front — towards the end of
June — and told some things
about what was happening, some
resistance began, but then there
was the following problem. To
make a real protest, you must
have some political base, and in
Israel this means the Labor party
or another organization called
Peace Now, and both these or
ganizations are pro-American.
They expect the Americans to ap
ply pressure on Begin — they will
not move in a situation in which
they are sure that America sup
ports Begin and Sharon. So, the
first protests continued until
about July 10 after which they

stopped. There were of course
small protests, but nothing ma
jor. You cannot organize support
for anything against the govern
ment in Israel if the people feel
that the United States is support
ing Israel. It is a matter of fact
that the bigger protests started
after the famous phone call that
Reagan made to Begin after the
bombing of Beirut, and more af
ter Reagan announced his plan.
Not that his plan is very impor
tant bv itself, but because it was
the first sign that America had a
policy that differed from Begin's.
This was the base on which the
outrage against the massacre in
the refugee camps was built and

this protest reached about a third
of the population. Only after the
18 and 19 of September, when
there was a combination of moral
outrage and a feeling that Ameri
can public opinion and the Amer
ican government was critical of
Begin, was there a situation when
a third of the people were protest
ing against Begin, a third were
supporting him, and a third
were confused. Now this situ
ation alone is not enough to de
feat Begin and he will remain in
power if the situation remains as
it is. It can change only if there is
a change in the American public
opinion or if there is a change in

the Arab world. One of the rea
sons why Begin had it so easy was
because of the divided state of the
Arab world. If things remain as
they are, there will be another
war in the spring or summer of
1983.
Daily: If the Labor party comes
to power, will there be any change
in Israel's policies?
Shahak: The Labor party can
be summed up in two words —
pro American. Sharon and Likus
are not pro-American because
they want to dominate the
Middle East. They want to make
Israel into a fourth super power,
which is certainly not in Ameri
can interest. The Labor party is
pro-American for certain very
important reasons. Begin's party
arose from another party which
was called the Revisionistic par
ty. The revisionists were for a
state which was based on power,
military power, without social
considerations. The Labor party
was and is for a state which is
based on a Jewish society, and I
want to explain this very careful
ly because this is not a question of

justice for the Palestinians. The
Labor party will support a Jewish
society, in pragmatic terms
meaning a society like Tel Aviv
before 1967, when everybody,
from the garbage collector to the
mayor, to everybody else, was
Jewish. After the occupation, for
the last 15 years, very many of
these jobs are being done by
Palestinians from the occupied
territories. Construction of
houses, garbage collection, clean
ing dishes in restaurants — many
other such occupations are per
formed by Palestinians. If
Sharon will conquer more and
more of the Middle East, it is all
right according to the re
visionists policies because they
desire only power. According to
Labor, this is not all right be
cause they desire a Jewish society
in which most occupations will
be performed by Jews.
Daily: Some people believe that
criticizing Jews in public coult
spark of a wave of anti-Semitism.
Would you comment?
Shahak: Maybe the reverse is
true. How do you know what is
contributing to anti-Semitism?
The people who are anti-Semites,

or are becoming so, might be
saying that all the Jews are the
same, they will not speak about
justice for non-Jews, but just
about each other. I have heard
many people say that Jews sup
port human rights, and of course
they are wrong. But there are
many people who will say that
when Jews supported human
rights, they only supported hu
man interests.
Daily: What do you make of the
Camp Davi<l accords?
Shahak: The peace between
Egypt and Israel was all right. I
should say that so far as the Arab
states go, the non-recognition of
Israel is stupidity. But of course
the second part of Camp David
was both unjust and stupid. You
cannot have Carter, Sadat and
Begin decide about Palestinians
without a single Palestinian ever
being present. And now if you
read Carter's memoirs, it is very
clear that Begin has deceived
both Sadat and Carter and he did
what he wanted.
Daily: Israel calls itself the only
democracy in the Mideast, yet
what you say does not bear that
out. Why?
Shahak: First of all, Israel
itself, in the 1967 borders, is a de

mocracy. West Bank and Gaza
strip are no democracies. Was
not the United States a de
mocracy when it made the wars
in Vietnam? Twenty years ago, I
was here in Palo Alto, and I trav
elled in Mississippi and Virginia.
In Virginia which is not 50 miles
from Washington, D.C., I have
seen restaurants with signs that
said "no dogs, no niggers." Was
not the United States a de
mocracy in 1962? You can have a
racist democracy. Take South
Africa where there is some ele
ment of democracy for the white
population, yet it is the most hor
rible racist state in the whole
world.
Generally Israel is a tolerant
society for opinions expressed by
Israeli citizens, not by Palesti
nians of West Bank and Gaza,
where there is a horrible repres
sion of expression of public opin
ion. The Americans make a mis
take about it because increasing
ly they use the name Israel to in
clude all areas ruled by Israel. In
usual American press, Israel
means Israel proper, the West
Bank and Gaza Strip, but actual
ly as different as England and its
colonies, and they have a com
pletely different system of law.

policy that differed from Begin's.
This was the base on which the
outrage against the massacre in
the refugee camps was built and

this protest reached about a third
of the population. Only after the
18 and 19 of September, when
there was a combination of moral
outrage and a feeling that Ameri
can public opinion and the Amer
ican government was critical of
Begin, was there a situation when
a third of the people were protest
ing against Begin, a third were
supporting him, and a third
were confused. Now this situ
ation alone is not enough to de
feat Begin and he will remain in
power if the situation remains as
it is. It can change only if there is
a change in the American public
opinion or if there is a change in

the Arab world. One of the rea
sons why Begin had it so easy was
because of the divided state of the
Arab world. If things remain as
they are, there will be another
war in the spring or summer of
1983.
Daily: If the Labor party comes
to power, will there be any change
in Israel's policies?
Shahak: The Labor party can
be summed up in two words —
pro American. Sharon and Likus
are not pro-American because
they want to dominate the
Middle East. They want to make
Israel into a fourth super power,
which is certainly not in Ameri
can interest. The Labor party is
pro-American for certain very
important reasons. Begin's party
arose from another party which
was called the Revisionistic par
ty. The revisionists were for a
state which was based on power,
military power, without social
considerations. The Labor party
was and is for a state which is
based on a Jewish society, and I
want to explain this very careful
ly because this is not a question of

justice for the Palestinians. The
Labor party will support a Jewish
society, in pragmatic terms
meaning a society like Tel Aviv
before 1967, when everybody,
from the garbage collector to the
mayor, to everybody else, was
Jewish. After the occupation, for
the last 15 years, very many of
these jobs are being done by
Palestinians from the occupied
territories. Construction of
houses, garbage collection, clean
ing dishes in restaurants — many
other such occupations are per
formed by Palestinians. If
Sharon will conquer more and
more of the Middle East, it is all
right according to the re
visionists policies because they
desire only power. According to
Labor, this is not all right be
cause they desire a Jewish society
in which most occupations will
be performed by Jews.
Daily: Some people believe that
criticizing Jews in public coult
spark of a wave of anti-Semitism.
Would you comment?
Shahak: Maybe the reverse is
true. How do you know what is
contributing to anti-Semitism?
The people who are anti-Semites,

or are becoming so, might be
saying that all the Jews are the
same, they will not speak about
justice for non-Jews, but just
about each other. I have heard
many people say that Jews sup
port human rights, and of course
they are wrong. But there are
many people who will say that
when Jews supported human
rights, they only supported hu
man interests.
Daily: What do you make of the
Camp Davi<l accords?
Shahak: The peace between
Egypt and Israel was all right. I
should say that so far as the Arab
states go, the non-recognition of
Israel is stupidity. But of course
the second part of Camp David
was both unjust and stupid. You
cannot have Carter, Sadat and
Begin decide about Palestinians
without a single Palestinian ever
being present. And now if you
read Carter's memoirs, it is very
clear that Begin has deceived
both Sadat and Carter and he did
what he wanted.
Daily: Israel calls itself the only
democracy in the Mideast, yet
what you say does not bear that
out. Why?
Shahak: First of all, Israel
itself, in the 1967 borders, is a de

mocracy. West Bank and Gaza
strip are no democracies. Was
not the United States a de
mocracy when it made the wars
in Vietnam? Twenty years ago, I
was here in Palo Alto, and I trav
elled in Mississippi and Virginia.
In Virginia which is not 50 miles
from Washington, D.C., I have
seen restaurants with signs that
said "no dogs, no niggers." Was
not the United States a de
mocracy in 1962? You can have a
racist democracy. Take South
Africa where there is some ele
ment of democracy for the white
population, yet it is the most hor
rible racist state in the whole
world.
Generally Israel is a tolerant
society for opinions expressed by
Israeli citizens, not by Palesti
nians of West Bank and Gaza,
where there is a horrible repres
sion of expression of public opin
ion. The Americans make a mis
take about it because increasing
ly they use the name Israel to in
clude all areas ruled by Israel. In
usual American press, Israel
means Israel proper, the West
Bank and Gaza Strip, but actual
ly as different as England and its
colonies, and they have a com
pletely different system of law.

picturesque angle and perhaps even better concentration with
his legs elevated above his head.
Israel Shahak was born in 1933
in Warsaw, Poland. He spent two
years in the Bergen-Belsen con
centration camp between the ages
of 10 and 12, and moved to Jerusa
lem in 1945. A visiting scholar in
the department of organic
chemistry at Stanford in 1963, he
is currently professor of organic
chemistry at the Hebrew Univer
sity in Jerusalem. He is also the
Chairman of the Israeli League
for Human and Civil Rights, and
has written extensively about
abuses of human rights in Israel.
He testified before the House For
eign Affairs Committee on the
treatment of Palestinians. Cur
rently on a tour of the United
States, he was interviewed by the
Daily .Excerpts:
Daily: What was the cause of
the war in Lebanon?
Shahak: There were two
causes, one particular, and the
other which went beyond the im
mediate. The particular cause,
and this was well-known in Is
rael, was to destroy the Palesti
nians as a political entity by de
stroying the PLO in Lebanon. Of
course, this failed. But the people
who rule Israel felt that if they ex
pel the PLO from Lebanon, the
Palestinians would accept their
lot which is perhaps similar or
even worse than the blacks in
South Africa. I would like to say
here the Israel alliance with
South Africa is not only because
of strategic interests, but also be
cause of similarities in ideology.

But in addition to this particular
cause, there was also the main
reason, and this was brought out
in an article in Ha'aretz, Israel's
leading newspaper. According to
that, Begin and Sharon desire to
dominate the Middle East and
this means that they want to be
the only military power in the re
gion. In keeping with this reason,
the war in Lebanon is directed
not only against the Lebanese
and the Palestinians, but also

'Begin and Sharon
desire to dominate the
Middle East, and this
means that they want
to he the only military
power in the region. In
keeping with this
reason, the war in
Lebanon is directed
not only against the
Lebanese and the
Palestinians, but also
against Syria and
Jordan. *

against Syria and Jordan. You
have heard about the many
threats which Sharon has issued
to Jordan and also to Syria and in
fact there is Sharon's grand

strategy which has been an
nounced through many official
declarations and speeches from
December 1981. According to
that, Israel wants to dominate the
Middle East, and from the
Middle East it wants to have pre
dominant strategic interest in the
area all the way to Pakistan, Mo
rocco and Kenya. In pure mili
tary terms, that is in terms of
tanks and aeroplanes and quan
tities of weapons, Israel is the
fourth superpower after the
United States, Soviet Union and
China. What it lacks is money.
Domination in the Middle East
will mean a system where Israel
will exact money from the Arab
oil states, Syria and Jordan will
be crushed and Kuwait and some
other countries will pay money
not to be invaded. This design
has been the reason for the cool
ing off of relations between the
United States and Israel because
after two-and-a-half months in
the war, American officials re
alized what Sharon really had in
mind. America wants to have cer
tain spheres of influence in the
Middle East and Israel has the
very same designs.
Daily: What has been the im
pact of the war on the people in the
West Bank and Gaza, Lebanon
and Israel?
Shahak: The Palestinians in
the West Bank and Gaza were
shocked by the magnitude of the
invasion, and they remained so
until the massacres in the refugee
camps. There was no organized

protest. I am sorry to say that.
The'reason for this, contrary to
Israeli public opinion, was that
the Palestinians were not pre
pared for the invasion. But there
is also another reason which is

'You cannot organize
support for anything
against the
government in Israel
if the people feel that
the United States is
supporting Israel.'

due to one of the serious mistakes
of the PLO. The PLO propagated
a strategy according to which
they felt that if they withstood the
Israeli attack for some time, the
other Arab states, compelled by
their peoples, would rise to sup
port it. But this strategy is wrong,
and it has been wrong for at least
10 years, if not more. This did not
happen, and by the time the PLO
realized this, it was too late.
About Lebanon, well, the
atrocities there have been un
precedented. Most of the Palesti
nian males between the ages of
16-40 have simply disappeared. I
do not believe that many of them
are alive because the number of
prisoners is too little to include
them. If you go the refugee camps
you just do not see able-bodied
males and only about 5 percent of

the families have grown-up male
members. More recently in oc
cupied Lebanon, Palestinian
children are denied access to
schools. There have also been
certain trade restrictions im
posed in the area. Both Israel and
Lebanon have the same kind of
soil and climatic conditions, and
they grow the same kinds of fruits
and vegetables. This puts them
into competition with each other.
So now there is a new rule where
by Lebanese peasants are not al
lowed to sell their products
before 10 a.m., until which time
the markets sell only Israeli prod
ucts. Also, movement of goods
from Israel to Lebanon is being
encouraged while the reverse has
been stopped.
In Israel, there was always a
small percentage of the popu
lation that opposed the war.
When the soldiers returned from
the front — towards the end of
June — and told some things
about what was happening, some
resistance began, but then there
was the following problem. To
make a real protest, you must
have some political base, and in
Israel this means the Labor party
or another organization called
Peace Now, and both these or
ganizations are pro-American.
They expect the Americans to ap
ply pressure on Begin — they will
not move in a situation in which
they are sure that America sup
ports Begin and Sharon. So, the
first protests continued until
about July 10 after which they

stopped. There were of course
small protests, but nothing ma
jor. You cannot organize support
for anything against the govern
ment in Israel if the people feel
that the United States is support
ing Israel. It is a matter of fact
that the bigger protests started
after the famous phone call that
Reagan made to Begin after the
bombing of Beirut, and more af
ter Reagan announced his plan.
Not that his plan is very impor
tant bv itself, but because it was
the first sign that America had a
policy that differed from Begin's.
This was the base on which the
outrage against the massacre in
the refugee camps was built and

this protest reached about a third

South Africa is not only because
of strategic interests, but also be
cause of similarities in ideology.

But in addition to this particular
cause, there was also the main
reason, and this was brought out
in an article in Ha'aretz, Israel's
leading newspaper. According to
that, Begin and Sharon desire to
dominate the Middle East and
this means that they want to be
the only military power in the re
gion. In keeping with this reason,
the war in Lebanon is directed
not only against the Lebanese
and the Palestinians, but also

against Syria and Jordan. You
have heard about the many
threats which Sharon has issued
to Jordan and also to Syria and in
fact there is Sharon's grand

strategy which has been an
nounced through many official
declarations and speeches from
December 1981. According to
that, Israel wants to dominate the
Middle East, and from the
Middle East it wants to have pre
dominant strategic interest in the
area all the way to Pakistan, Mo
rocco and Kenya. In pure mili
tary terms, that is in terms of
tanks and aeroplanes and quan
tities of weapons, Israel is the
fourth superpower after the
United States, Soviet Union and
China. What it lacks is money.
Domination in the Middle East
will mean a system where Israel
will exact money from the Arab
oil states, Syria and Jordan will
be crushed and Kuwait and some
other countries will pay money
not to be invaded. This design
has been the reason for the cool
ing off of relations between the
United States and Israel because
after two-and-a-half months in
the war, American officials re
alized what Sharon really had in
mind. America wants to have cer
tain spheres of influence in the
Middle East and Israel has the
very same designs.
Daily: What has been the im
pact of the war on the people in the
West Bank and Gaza, Lebanon
and Israel?
Shahak: The Palestinians in
the West Bank and Gaza were
shocked by the magnitude of the
invasion, and they remained so
until the massacres in the refugee
camps. There was no organized

protest. I am sorry to say that.
The'reason for this, contrary to
Israeli public opinion, was that
the Palestinians were not pre
pared for the invasion. But there
is also another reason which is

'You cannot organize
support for anything
against the
government in Israel
if the people feel that
the United States is
supporting Israel.'

due to one of the serious mistakes
of the PLO. The PLO propagated
a strategy according to which
they felt that if they withstood the
Israeli attack for some time, the
other Arab states, compelled by
their peoples, would rise to sup
port it. But this strategy is wrong,
and it has been wrong for at least
10 years, if not more. This did not
happen, and by the time the PLO
realized this, it was too late.
About Lebanon, well, the
atrocities there have been un
precedented. Most of the Palesti
nian males between the ages of
16-40 have simply disappeared. I
do not believe that many of them
are alive because the number of
prisoners is too little to include
them. If you go the refugee camps
you just do not see able-bodied
males and only about 5 percent of

the families have grown-up male
members. More recently in oc
cupied Lebanon, Palestinian
children are denied access to
schools. There have also been
certain trade restrictions im
posed in the area. Both Israel and
Lebanon have the same kind of
soil and climatic conditions, and
they grow the same kinds of fruits
and vegetables. This puts them
into competition with each other.
So now there is a new rule where
by Lebanese peasants are not al
lowed to sell their products
before 10 a.m., until which time
the markets sell only Israeli prod
ucts. Also, movement of goods
from Israel to Lebanon is being
encouraged while the reverse has
been stopped.
In Israel, there was always a
small percentage of the popu
lation that opposed the war.
When the soldiers returned from
the front — towards the end of
June — and told some things
about what was happening, some
resistance began, but then there
was the following problem. To
make a real protest, you must
have some political base, and in
Israel this means the Labor party
or another organization called
Peace Now, and both these or
ganizations are pro-American.
They expect the Americans to ap
ply pressure on Begin — they will
not move in a situation in which
they are sure that America sup
ports Begin and Sharon. So, the
first protests continued until
about July 10 after which they

stopped. There were of course
small protests, but nothing ma
jor. You cannot organize support
for anything against the govern
ment in Israel if the people feel
that the United States is support
ing Israel. It is a matter of fact
that the bigger protests started
after the famous phone call that
Reagan made to Begin after the
bombing of Beirut, and more af
ter Reagan announced his plan.
Not that his plan is very impor
tant bv itself, but because it was
the first sign that America had a
policy that differed from Begin's.
This was the base on which the
outrage against the massacre in
the refugee camps was built and

this protest reached about a third
of the population. Only after the
18 and 19 of September, when
there was a combination of moral
outrage and a feeling that Ameri
can public opinion and the Amer
ican government was critical of
Begin, was there a situation when
a third of the people were protest
ing against Begin, a third were
supporting him, and a third
were confused. Now this situ
ation alone is not enough to de
feat Begin and he will remain in
power if the situation remains as
it is. It can change only if there is
a change in the American public
opinion or if there is a change in


Prof. Israel Shahak
the Arab world. One of the rea
sons why Begin had it so easy was
because of the divided state of the
Arab world. If things remain as
they are, there will be another
war in the spring or summer of
1983.
Daily: If the Labor party comes
to power, will there be any change
in Israel's policies?
Shahak: The Labor party can
be summed up in two words —
pro American. Sharon and Likus
are not pro-American because
they want to dominate the
Middle East. They want to make
Israel into a fourth super power,
which is certainly not in Ameri
can interest. The Labor party is
pro-American for certain very
important reasons. Begin's party
arose from another party which
was called the Revisionistic par
ty. The revisionists were for a
state which was based on power,
military power, without social
considerations. The Labor party
was and is for a state which is
based on a Jewish society, and I
want to explain this very careful
ly because this is not a question of

justice for the Palestinians. The
Labor party will support a Jewish
society, in pragmatic terms
meaning a society like Tel Aviv
before 1967, when everybody,
from the garbage collector to the
mayor, to everybody else, was
Jewish. After the occupation, for
the last 15 years, very many of
these jobs are being done by
Palestinians from the occupied
territories. Construction of
houses, garbage collection, clean
ing dishes in restaurants — many
other such occupations are per
formed by Palestinians. If
Sharon will conquer more and
more of the Middle East, it is all
right according to the re
visionists policies because they
desire only power. According to
Labor, this is not all right be
cause they desire a Jewish society
in which most occupations will
be performed by Jews.
Daily: Some people believe that
criticizing Jews in public coult
spark of a wave of anti-Semitism.
Would you comment?
Shahak: Maybe the reverse is
true. How do you know what is
contributing to anti-Semitism?
The people who are anti-Semites,

or are becoming so, might be
saying that all the Jews are the
same, they will not speak about
justice for non-Jews, but just
about each other. I have heard
many people say that Jews sup
port human rights, and of course
they are wrong. But there are
many people who will say that
when Jews supported human
rights, they only supported hu
man interests.
Daily: What do you make of the
Camp Davi<l accords?
Shahak: The peace between
Egypt and Israel was all right. I
should say that so far as the Arab
states go, the non-recognition of
Israel is stupidity. But of course
the second part of Camp David
was both unjust and stupid. You
cannot have Carter, Sadat and
Begin decide about Palestinians
without a single Palestinian ever
being present. And now if you
read Carter's memoirs, it is very
clear that Begin has deceived
both Sadat and Carter and he did
what he wanted.
Daily: Israel calls itself the only
democracy in the Mideast, yet
what you say does not bear that
out. Why?
Shahak: First of all, Israel
itself, in the 1967 borders, is a de

mocracy. West Bank and Gaza
strip are no democracies. Was
not the United States a de
mocracy when it made the wars
in Vietnam? Twenty years ago, I
was here in Palo Alto, and I trav
elled in Mississippi and Virginia.
In Virginia which is not 50 miles
from Washington, D.C., I have
seen restaurants with signs that
said "no dogs, no niggers." Was
not the United States a de
mocracy in 1962? You can have a
racist democracy. Take South
Africa where there is some ele
ment of democracy for the white
population, yet it is the most hor
rible racist state in the whole
world.
Generally Israel is a tolerant
society for opinions expressed by
Israeli citizens, not by Palesti
nians of West Bank and Gaza,
where there is a horrible repres
sion of expression of public opin
ion. The Americans make a mis
take about it because increasing
ly they use the name Israel to in
clude all areas ruled by Israel. In
usual American press, Israel
means Israel proper, the West
Bank and Gaza Strip, but actual
ly as different as England and its
colonies, and they have a com
pletely different system of law.

his legs elevated above his head.
Israel Shahak was born in 1933
in Warsaw, Poland. He spent two
years in the Bergen-Belsen con
centration camp between the ages
of 10 and 12, and moved to Jerusa
lem in 1945. A visiting scholar in
the department of organic
chemistry at Stanford in 1963, he
is currently professor of organic
chemistry at the Hebrew Univer
sity in Jerusalem. He is also the
Chairman of the Israeli League
for Human and Civil Rights, and
has written extensively about
abuses of human rights in Israel.
He testified before the House For
eign Affairs Committee on the
treatment of Palestinians. Cur
rently on a tour of the United
States, he was interviewed by the
Daily .Excerpts:
Daily: What was the cause of
the war in Lebanon?
Shahak: There were two
causes, one particular, and the
other which went beyond the im
mediate. The particular cause,
and this was well-known in Is
rael, was to destroy the Palesti
nians as a political entity by de
stroying the PLO in Lebanon. Of
course, this failed. But the people
who rule Israel felt that if they ex
pel the PLO from Lebanon, the
Palestinians would accept their
lot which is perhaps similar or
even worse than the blacks in
South Africa. I would like to say
here the Israel alliance with
South Africa is not only because
of strategic interests, but also be
cause of similarities in ideology.

But in addition to this particular
cause, there was also the main

can interest. The Labor party is
pro-American for certain very
important reasons. Begin's party
arose from another party which
was called the Revisionistic par
ty. The revisionists were for a
state which was based on power,
military power, without social
considerations. The Labor party
was and is for a state which is
based on a Jewish society, and I
want to explain this very careful
ly because this is not a question of

justice for the Palestinians. The
Labor party will support a Jewish
society, in pragmatic terms
meaning a society like Tel Aviv
before 1967, when everybody,
from the garbage collector to the
mayor, to everybody else, was
Jewish. After the occupation, for
the last 15 years, very many of
these jobs are being done by
Palestinians from the occupied
territories. Construction of
houses, garbage collection, clean
ing dishes in restaurants — many
other such occupations are per
formed by Palestinians. If
Sharon will conquer more and
more of the Middle East, it is all
right according to the re
visionists policies because they
desire only power. According to
Labor, this is not all right be
cause they desire a Jewish society
in which most occupations will
be performed by Jews.
Daily: Some people believe that
criticizing Jews in public coult
spark of a wave of anti-Semitism.
Would you comment?
Shahak: Maybe the reverse is
true. How do you know what is
contributing to anti-Semitism?
The people who are anti-Semites,

or are becoming so, might be
saying that all the Jews are the
same, they will not speak about
justice for non-Jews, but just
about each other. I have heard
many people say that Jews sup
port human rights, and of course
they are wrong. But there are
many people who will say that
when Jews supported human
rights, they only supported hu
man interests.
Daily: What do you make of the
Camp Davi<l accords?
Shahak: The peace between
Egypt and Israel was all right. I
should say that so far as the Arab
states go, the non-recognition of
Israel is stupidity. But of course
the second part of Camp David
was both unjust and stupid. You
cannot have Carter, Sadat and
Begin decide about Palestinians
without a single Palestinian ever
being present. And now if you
read Carter's memoirs, it is very
clear that Begin has deceived
both Sadat and Carter and he did
what he wanted.
Daily: Israel calls itself the only
democracy in the Mideast, yet
what you say does not bear that
out. Why?
Shahak: First of all, Israel
itself, in the 1967 borders, is a de

mocracy. West Bank and Gaza
strip are no democracies. Was
not the United States a de
mocracy when it made the wars
in Vietnam? Twenty years ago, I
was here in Palo Alto, and I trav
elled in Mississippi and Virginia.
In Virginia which is not 50 miles
from Washington, D.C., I have
seen restaurants with signs that
said "no dogs, no niggers." Was
not the United States a de
mocracy in 1962? You can have a
racist democracy. Take South
Africa where there is some ele
ment of democracy for the white
population, yet it is the most hor
rible racist state in the whole
world.
Generally Israel is a tolerant
society for opinions expressed by
Israeli citizens, not by Palesti
nians of West Bank and Gaza,
where there is a horrible repres
sion of expression of public opin
ion. The Americans make a mis
take about it because increasing
ly they use the name Israel to in
clude all areas ruled by Israel. In
usual American press, Israel
means Israel proper, the West
Bank and Gaza Strip, but actual
ly as different as England and its
colonies, and they have a com
pletely different system of law.

picturesque angle and perhaps even better concentration with
his legs elevated above his head.
Israel Shahak was born in 1933
in Warsaw, Poland. He spent two
years in the Bergen-Belsen con
centration camp between the ages
of 10 and 12, and moved to Jerusa
lem in 1945. A visiting scholar in
the department of organic
chemistry at Stanford in 1963, he
is currently professor of organic
chemistry at the Hebrew Univer
sity in Jerusalem. He is also the
Chairman of the Israeli League
for Human and Civil Rights, and
has written extensively about
abuses of human rights in Israel.
He testified before the House For
eign Affairs Committee on the
treatment of Palestinians. Cur
rently on a tour of the United
States, he was interviewed by the
Daily .Excerpts:
Daily: What was the cause of
the war in Lebanon?
Shahak: There were two
causes, one particular, and the
other which went beyond the im
mediate. The particular cause,
and this was well-known in Is
rael, was to destroy the Palesti
nians as a political entity by de
stroying the PLO in Lebanon. Of
course, this failed. But the people
who rule Israel felt that if they ex
pel the PLO from Lebanon, the
Palestinians would accept their
lot which is perhaps similar or
even worse than the blacks in
South Africa. I would like to say
here the Israel alliance with
South Africa is not only because
of strategic interests, but also be
cause of similarities in ideology.

But in addition to this particular
cause, there was also the main
reason, and this was brought out
in an article in Ha'aretz, Israel's
leading newspaper. According to
that, Begin and Sharon desire to
dominate the Middle East and
this means that they want to be
the only military power in the re
gion. In keeping with this reason,
the war in Lebanon is directed
not only against the Lebanese
and the Palestinians, but also

'Begin and Sharon
desire to dominate the
Middle East, and this
means that they want
to he the only military
power in the region. In
keeping with this
reason, the war in
Lebanon is directed
not only against the
Lebanese and the
Palestinians, but also
against Syria and
Jordan. *

against Syria and Jordan. You
have heard about the many
threats which Sharon has issued
to Jordan and also to Syria and in
fact there is Sharon's grand

strategy which has been an
nounced through many official
declarations and speeches from
December 1981. According to
that, Israel wants to dominate the
Middle East, and from the
Middle East it wants to have pre
dominant strategic interest in the
area all the way to Pakistan, Mo
rocco and Kenya. In pure mili
tary terms, that is in terms of
tanks and aeroplanes and quan
tities of weapons, Israel is the
fourth superpower after the
United States, Soviet Union and
China. What it lacks is money.
Domination in the Middle East
will mean a system where Israel
will exact money from the Arab
oil states, Syria and Jordan will
be crushed and Kuwait and some
other countries will pay money
not to be invaded. This design
has been the reason for the cool
ing off of relations between the
United States and Israel because
after two-and-a-half months in
the war, American officials re
alized what Sharon really had in
mind. America wants to have cer
tain spheres of influence in the
Middle East and Israel has the
very same designs.
Daily: What has been the im
pact of the war on the people in the
West Bank and Gaza, Lebanon
and Israel?
Shahak: The Palestinians in
the West Bank and Gaza were
shocked by the magnitude of the
invasion, and they remained so
until the massacres in the refugee
camps. There was no organized

protest. I am sorry to say that.
The'reason for this, contrary to
Israeli public opinion, was that
the Palestinians were not pre
pared for the invasion. But there
is also another reason which is

'You cannot organize
support for anything
against the
government in Israel
if the people feel that
the United States is
supporting Israel.'

due to one of the serious mistakes
of the PLO. The PLO propagated
a strategy according to which
they felt that if they withstood the
Israeli attack for some time, the
other Arab states, compelled by
their peoples, would rise to sup
port it. But this strategy is wrong,
and it has been wrong for at least
10 years, if not more. This did not
happen, and by the time the PLO
realized this, it was too late.
About Lebanon, well, the
atrocities there have been un
precedented. Most of the Palesti
nian males between the ages of
16-40 have simply disappeared. I
do not believe that many of them
are alive because the number of
prisoners is too little to include
them. If you go the refugee camps
you just do not see able-bodied
males and only about 5 percent of

the families have grown-up male
members. More recently in oc
cupied Lebanon, Palestinian
children are denied access to
schools. There have also been
certain trade restrictions im
posed in the area. Both Israel and
Lebanon have the same kind of
soil and climatic conditions, and
they grow the same kinds of fruits
and vegetables. This puts them
into competition with each other.
So now there is a new rule where
by Lebanese peasants are not al
lowed to sell their products
before 10 a.m., until which time
the markets sell only Israeli prod
ucts. Also, movement of goods
from Israel to Lebanon is being
encouraged while the reverse has
been stopped.
In Israel, there was always a
small percentage of the popu
lation that opposed the war.
When the soldiers returned from
the front — towards the end of
June — and told some things
about what was happening, some
resistance began, but then there
was the following problem. To
make a real protest, you must
have some political base, and in
Israel this means the Labor party
or another organization called
Peace Now, and both these or
ganizations are pro-American.
They expect the Americans to ap
ply pressure on Begin — they will
not move in a situation in which
they are sure that America sup
ports Begin and Sharon. So, the
first protests continued until
about July 10 after which they

stopped. There were of course
small protests, but nothing ma
jor. You cannot organize support
for anything against the govern
ment in Israel if the people feel
that the United States is support
ing Israel. It is a matter of fact
that the bigger protests started
after the famous phone call that
Reagan made to Begin after the
bombing of Beirut, and more af
ter Reagan announced his plan.
Not that his plan is very impor
tant bv itself, but because it was
the first sign that America had a
policy that differed from Begin's.
This was the base on which the
outrage against the massacre in
the refugee camps was built and

this protest reached about a third
of the population. Only after the
18 and 19 of September, when
there was a combination of moral
outrage and a feeling that Ameri
can public opinion and the Amer
ican government was critical of
Begin, was there a situation when
a third of the people were protest
ing against Begin, a third were
supporting him, and a third
were confused. Now this situ
ation alone is not enough to de
feat Begin and he will remain in
power if the situation remains as
it is. It can change only if there is
a change in the American public
opinion or if there is a change in

the Arab world. One of the rea
sons why Begin had it so easy was
because of the divided state of the
Arab world. If things remain as
they are, there will be another
war in the spring or summer of
1983.
Daily: If the Labor party comes
to power, will there be any change
in Israel's policies?
Shahak: The Labor party can
be summed up in two words —
pro American. Sharon and Likus
are not pro-American because
they want to dominate the
Middle East. They want to make
Israel into a fourth super power,
which is certainly not in Ameri
can interest. The Labor party is
pro-American for certain very
important reasons. Begin's party
