# Oxford: a campus for the active
## 
### JOAN O'CONNELL 
All facilities necessary for
the daily life of a student com
munity — shopping, restau
rants. laundries etc. — are
within immediate walking dis
tance, as is one of the greatest
bookstores in the English
speaking world.
Hyperbole, you say? A let
ter home from an overzealous
freshman marvelling at frozen
yogurt at Tresidder, Bran
ner's coin-operated dryers and
the chance for a rebate on his
three-figure book tab? Hard
ly-
A closer look at the red
and-white-bound report con
taining this assessment which
passed beneath the eyes and
then captured the nod of the
University's board of trustees
yesterday, reveals that these
pluses merely scratch the sur
face of a new program in Brit
ain which literally picks up
where the old one left off.
Beginning in the fall of
1984, about 50 students and a
live-in staff or faculty person
will move into 64-70 High
Street, the new site for Stan
ford's British campus, located
in the heart of the Oxford
University complex. The
switch from the current
Cliveden House site for the
program was precipitated
both by rising costs for the
rent on that location, and the
feeling by the University that
while life at Cliveden was both
beautiful and educational, it
tended to isolate and insulate
the students studying there.
Plus, the academic advan
tages to be gained from study
at one of the world's foremost
universities prompted ap
proval "with gusto" from the
board, according to Bob
Hamrdla, assistant to the
president for trustee affairs.
Not only will students take
courses from British academ
ics hired on an honorarium

basis and Stanford faculty as
signed to teach there, they will
also have access to Oxford lec
ture courses and op
portunities for directed read
ing and tutorial sessions.
Oxford has a population of
150,000 and is considered an
important industrial and
commercial center; the Stan
ford campus will be located
just east of the High Street
shopping complex and within
walking distance of the train
station.
Continuation of the
Cliveden program would have
cost more than even the budg
eted $2.2 million needed to
renovate the "collection of

three and four-story, 200-300-
year-old non-descript row
buildings, four of which con
tain shops on the ground
floor," which currently oc
cupy the planned study center
site.
The University has signed a
75-year lease with Magdalen
College, the owner of the
property, which will include
only nominal rent for the first
30 years, due to Stanford's
substantial outlay for the re
modeling. The University will
likely finance the project with
a loan from a British bank, so
as to eliminate risk due to cur
rency variations during the re
payment period.
