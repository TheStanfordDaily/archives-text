## The 						Stanford Daily Sasway conviction disturbing 
### 
The 30-month sentence for draft registration re
sister Benjamin Sasway settles in here like the prov
erbial porcupine bedding down for the night: it's
discomforting whether you think it should happen
or not. Soon, perhaps, federal judges will be prose
cuting men from Stanford University who — like
Sasway — have openly declared that they are will
ing to face prison terms rather than put their names
on a piece of paper at the Post Office.
But that uncomfortable feeling should not only
be the result of fear of one's peers' incarceration. It
becomes increasingly obvious that something is
wrong when otherwise law-abiding students who
have much to contribute to society are being put
through extensive and expensive trials for political
reasons more than anything else. Sasway, it seems
clear, was prosecuted more to coerce other non-reg
isters than to punish a criminal in a manner that fits
the nature and prevalence of the crime.
The pervasiveness of the crime unjustly con
tributes directly to the harshness in this particular
case, and, therefore, to the political nature of the
punishment. Anywhere from 500,000 to 750,000
young men who are eligible have not registered, de
pending on who is doing the reckoning. Obviously
an already over-worked justice system cannot pros
ecute all of these men. The government's solution?
Scare tactics.
Sasway's attorney, Charles Burner, predicted,
however, that the deterrent effect of these tactics
will be minimal. Enten Eller, who was prosecuted
before Sasway and was told, as part of his sentence,
to register within three months, has indicated that
he will not register. Students here who are open re
sisters have stated similar disinclinations.
However, many young men who have not
thought as thoroughly about their reasons for not
registering will sign up now. The Sasways and the

Ellers of the world will not be the ones who are in
timidated, however. How many resisters are there
in the country? This figure varies, again, upon to
whom one talks. The result is clear, though: there
are more resisters than the justice system has the
means to prosecute in a fair and thoughtful
manner.
The implementation of the law's enforcement is
at least as repugnant as the law itself in this case. If
Sasway is being punished for not upholding his ob
ligations to a society based upon law, it seems par
ticularly unjust that he is the victim of nonuniform,
coercive and unusual enforcement of that law.
Where, then, does registration prosecution move
from here? It has three choices: continuing the pres
ent lottery system where only vocal resisters are
punished, passing laws denying benefits such as Aid
to Families with Dependent Children and Food
Stamps — or college loans — to non-registrants or
abolishing the registration law completely. The first
two alternatives involve continued prosecution and
abrogation of personal liberties, the latter an ac
knowledgement that registration is neither needed
nor effective at this time.
Clearly we must choose the latter. The voluntary
armed forces, growing since their inception in 1973,
are now turning away people because they are sur
passing almost all of their recruitment goals. Ad
mittedly, this is due in large part to the lingering re
cession, but most defense analysts indicate that the
armed forces are the healthiest, due in large part to
massive allocations, that they have been in years.
This lack of necessity coupled with the ineffec
tiveness of the registration process should, logical
ly, lead our national leaders to conclude that regis
tration will not work, thereby alleviating that un
comfortable feeling which remains with many of us.
Somehow, we don't feel much better.
