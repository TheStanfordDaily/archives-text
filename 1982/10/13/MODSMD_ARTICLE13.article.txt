## Many lack understanding of Mideast 
### 
The Mideast, it is obvious, has been
in the news a lot lately. Yet, there is
much confusion about what is really
happening there and what has caused
those things to happen. With a view to
clarifying this confusion, I offer the fol
lowing summary of the events leading
to the current situation.
The trouble all began when the Jews,
after centuries of persecution of varying
intensity, decided to find a land where
they could live in peace. Palestine, oc
cupied by Arabs for the better part of
the last two millenia, and controlled by
the British for a significantly shorter pe
riod, was chosen as that land for his
torical reasons. After the Holocaust in
Europe, which intensified the Jewish
desire to find a land where they could
live in peace, Palestine was subjected to
intense Jewish immigration. Naturally,
those alrady there, who only wanted to
live there in peace, did not look kindly
'upon this invasion, and resisted in a
wide variety of ways. The Jews resented
this opposition, called the Arabs and
British anti-Semitic, and so that they
could just live in peace in Palestine, the
Jews proceeded to throw bombs at the
British and the Arabs.
The British deduced, relatively quick
ly, that although they just wanted to live
in peace, they would be better able to
live in, peace if they were back in Eng
land where they belonged. So they split

Palestine into two more or less equally
attractive parts, one for the bomb
throwing Jews and one for the by-now
bomb-throwing Arabs — and they left.
Naively, they assumed that since ev
erybody just wanted to live in peace, the
Palestinians could live peacefully in
Jordan, the Jews could live peacefully in
Israel, and the British could live peace
fully in Britain. Actually, they were
wrong on all three counts.

The Palestinians
weren V happy with just
the West Bank, and the
Jews didn't like living in
a country shaped
vaguely like a croissant.

You see, the Palestinians weren't
happy with just the West Bank, and the
Jews didn't like living in a country
shaped vaguely like a croissant as long
as there were hostile neighbors living
between the two arms of their state. So
the Palestinians threw bombs at the
Jews, and the Jews (with the help of
American planes and such) bombed the
Palestinians in their villages in retalia
tion — bomb-throwing being an ex
clusively Jewish right, presumably.

The Palestinians, having rightfully
decided that if they really wanted to live
in peace, the only alternative to halting
their bomb-throw.was to find some
friends. This they am, and their friends
attacked Israel several times over the
next 30 years or so, and succeeded in
not only not taking over Israeli territory
for their Palestinian friends, but also in
losing the. West Bank, ths glkai penin
sula and Golan Israelis.
The Palestinians then started screaming
that all they wanted was to live peace
fully in precisely those territories they
used to have, but which their friends
lost on their behalf. So they kept throw
ing bombs, this time from bases in Leb
anon, where nobody could live in peace
anyway since it was occupied by bomb
throwing Palestinians.
To everyone's surprise, the Israelis
didn't like being the target of bomb
throwing from Lebanon, either, and
started bombing the Palestinian camps
there. After all, they just wanted to live
in peace, in Israel, since slavery in Egypt
was an unpopular alternative due to
various historical factors. Unfortunate
ly, the Palestinians, who just wanted to
live in peace, could not do so in Leba
non, because of a very unpeaceful civil
war which their presence had helped
trigger.

the Palestinians threw bombs at the
Jews, and the Jews (with the help of
American planes and such) bombed the
Palestinians in their villages in retalia
tion — bomb-throwing being an ex
clusively Jewish right, presumably.

The Palestinians, having rightfully
decided that if they really wanted to live
in peace, the only alternative to halting
their bomb-throw.was to find some
friends. This they am, and their friends
attacked Israel several times over the
next 30 years or so, and succeeded in
not only not taking over Israeli territory
for their Palestinian friends, but also in
losing the. West Bank, ths glkai penin
sula and Golan Israelis.
The Palestinians then started screaming
that all they wanted was to live peace
fully in precisely those territories they
used to have, but which their friends
lost on their behalf. So they kept throw
ing bombs, this time from bases in Leb
anon, where nobody could live in peace
anyway since it was occupied by bomb
throwing Palestinians.
To everyone's surprise, the Israelis
didn't like being the target of bomb
throwing from Lebanon, either, and
started bombing the Palestinian camps
there. After all, they just wanted to live
in peace, in Israel, since slavery in Egypt
was an unpopular alternative due to
various historical factors. Unfortunate
ly, the Palestinians, who just wanted to
live in peace, could not do so in Leba
non, because of a very unpeaceful civil
war which their presence had helped
trigger.
