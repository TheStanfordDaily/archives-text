## Stanford leads in computer science, what more could one want? 
### 
Despite the autumn sunshine, these
existential crises have a way of coming
around again. Today I found myself
asking myself an anguishing question:
would I have the courage to vote with
the 12 against the abolition of Solidar
ity in the Polish Parliament? It doesn't
help much to know that Poland is far
away or to be "over the hill" and know
that one had answered affirmatively in
the past.
Maybe one should go play some vig
orous tennis, as one's wife suggests, and
forget about it... Maybe I am a hope
less "malcontent" and Lech Walesa an
other, a compulsive rebel who would
not rest quiet under any regime. Maybe
Reagan who called Jaruzelski and his
henchmen "lousy bums" is an eternal
adolescent. Maybe the pope is another
vestigial freak. And soon it strikes one
that any sort of profound caring or con
cern has become suspect in our cool en
vironment.
After all, Stanford now leads the
world in computer science, what more
could anyone want? Why should we
worry that the humanities have
dropped into the basement (roughly an
80 percent drop in humanities majors)
in the last few years? They merely ask
embarassing questions about life, raise
tragic issues and might even lead to a
quaint need for belief in something.

Soviet propaganda
Clay Moltz's notion that the United
States should formulate its foreign poli

cy in such a manner as to deprive Soviet
propagandists of exploitable issues
("Reagan policies aid Soviet cause,"
Daily, Oct. 6) is as moronic as it is un
tenable. Perhaps worst of all, the article
is used as a vehicle for Moltz's largely
unsubstantiated whining about the con
duct of U.S. foreign policy: to wit, his
sneering at the tenet that our author
itarian allies can someday be trans
formed into democracies (even though
the recent experiences in, say, Greece
and Spain validate such a principle).
To believe that the Soviet propagan
da machinery would dease to censure
the United States if, as Moltz implies,
we more strongly condemned recent Is
raeli activity, discontinued arms
shipments to Central America etc. is
rather naive. As one of his examples of
our propaganda-nurturing policies,
Moltz cites the United States' under
handed, dastardly, "sluggishness in the
SALT (sic) negotiations in Geneva."
(Imagine, the nerve of our negotiators
impeding these talks with non-issues
like continued Soviet deployment of re
levant SS-20 missiles in the face of Sovi
et Premier Leonid Brezhnev's promised
moratorium.) It seems axiomatic that if
the Soviet Union can turn ostensibly
good-faith negoations into anti-U.S.
twaddle, there is little we can do, short
of unilateral disarmament, to please the
manipulators of their media.
One need only to consider the types
of pesons, nations and events which are
spared Soviet condemnation (e.g., Gen
eral Wojciech Jaruzelski, Bulgaria, the
Afghan invasion) to realize that it
would be extremely undesirable to have
the United States included in these

ranks.
A second fallacy in Moltz's diatribe is
his belief that by following a policy
which somehow would not inspire anti-
U.S. rhetoric, Soviet behavior would be
altered to our benefit. Well, as Moltz
somewhat tentatively admits, public
opinion (the presumed target of all
these media efforts) is of little conse
quence in the Soviet Union. This asser
tion, in fact, delivers a mortal blow to
his whole reasoning for trying to starve
the Soviet Union of food for propagan
da. Unfortunately, he goes on to
whimper about how our naughtiness
has eroded the Soviet leadership's
"trust necessary for SALT I and the de
tente era." If one remembers, those
were the carefree, blissful days when,
for example, the Soviet Union re
ciprocated our unilateral decisions not
to deploy neutron bombs or the B-l
with goodwill gestures like the planting
of hundreds of SS-20's aimed at
Western Europe and dispatching
troops to Angola, South Yemen and
Ethiopia.
The blundering continues when
Moltz avers that because of U.S. policy
and the concomitant Soviet propagan
da, "the Soviets have reason now to be
lieve their government, rather than
question that authority." In truth, the
sham of the Soviet system is one of the
worst-kept secrets of the Soviet Union.
Does Moltz honestly believe that al
though a given Soviet citizen sees spe
cial stores reserved exclusively for party
elites, hears of neighbors' sons coming
home from Afghanistan in body bags
and is himself forced to do without
goods like meat, coffee and razor blades

for months or years, these realities are
overriden by articles in Pravda about
U.S. activities in El Salvador?
In closing Moltz states, "the
strongest position we could hope to at
tain would be when the Soviet people
... realize that their own government is
simply making wind." Well, that
knowledge is already widely dis
seminated. Unfortunately, in the Soviet
Union, public opinion does not a policy
make.

In response to Wilfred Stone's (Dai
ly, Oct. 6) rhetorical question: "Then
what about the 'ethnic houses' where
Chicano, native Americans and others
have found isolated havens?" it should
be pointed out that the University does
not have an "ethnic house" for native"
Americans at this time. The residential
experience for native Americans at
Stanford is often one of isolation; to
characterize it as providing a "haven" is
inaccurate.
Such errors demonstrate the lack of
knowledge about native Americans at
Stanford. We see theme houses as func
tioning both to provide cohesion and
support for their members as well as to
educate the general Stanford populace.
We hope to see a native American
theme house established at Stanford in
the near future.

formed into democracies (even though
the recent experiences in, say, Greece
and Spain validate such a principle).
To believe that the Soviet propagan
da machinery would dease to censure
the United States if, as Moltz implies,
we more strongly condemned recent Is
raeli activity, discontinued arms
shipments to Central America etc. is
rather naive. As one of his examples of
our propaganda-nurturing policies,
Moltz cites the United States' under
handed, dastardly, "sluggishness in the
SALT (sic) negotiations in Geneva."
(Imagine, the nerve of our negotiators
impeding these talks with non-issues
like continued Soviet deployment of re
levant SS-20 missiles in the face of Sovi
et Premier Leonid Brezhnev's promised
moratorium.) It seems axiomatic that if
the Soviet Union can turn ostensibly
good-faith negoations into anti-U.S.
twaddle, there is little we can do, short
of unilateral disarmament, to please the
manipulators of their media.
One need only to consider the types
of pesons, nations and events which are
spared Soviet condemnation (e.g., Gen
eral Wojciech Jaruzelski, Bulgaria, the
Afghan invasion) to realize that it
would be extremely undesirable to have
the United States included in these

ranks.
A second fallacy in Moltz's diatribe is
his belief that by following a policy
which somehow would not inspire anti-
U.S. rhetoric, Soviet behavior would be
altered to our benefit. Well, as Moltz
somewhat tentatively admits, public
opinion (the presumed target of all
these media efforts) is of little conse
quence in the Soviet Union. This asser
tion, in fact, delivers a mortal blow to
his whole reasoning for trying to starve
the Soviet Union of food for propagan
da. Unfortunately, he goes on to
whimper about how our naughtiness
has eroded the Soviet leadership's
"trust necessary for SALT I and the de
tente era." If one remembers, those
were the carefree, blissful days when,
for example, the Soviet Union re
ciprocated our unilateral decisions not
to deploy neutron bombs or the B-l
with goodwill gestures like the planting
of hundreds of SS-20's aimed at
Western Europe and dispatching
troops to Angola, South Yemen and
Ethiopia.
The blundering continues when
Moltz avers that because of U.S. policy
and the concomitant Soviet propagan
da, "the Soviets have reason now to be
lieve their government, rather than
question that authority." In truth, the
sham of the Soviet system is one of the
worst-kept secrets of the Soviet Union.
Does Moltz honestly believe that al
though a given Soviet citizen sees spe
cial stores reserved exclusively for party
elites, hears of neighbors' sons coming
home from Afghanistan in body bags
and is himself forced to do without
goods like meat, coffee and razor blades

for months or years, these realities are
overriden by articles in Pravda about
U.S. activities in El Salvador?
In closing Moltz states, "the
strongest position we could hope to at
tain would be when the Soviet people
... realize that their own government is
simply making wind." Well, that
knowledge is already widely dis
seminated. Unfortunately, in the Soviet
Union, public opinion does not a policy
make.

In response to Wilfred Stone's (Dai
ly, Oct. 6) rhetorical question: "Then
what about the 'ethnic houses' where
Chicano, native Americans and others
have found isolated havens?" it should
be pointed out that the University does
not have an "ethnic house" for native"
Americans at this time. The residential
experience for native Americans at
Stanford is often one of isolation; to
characterize it as providing a "haven" is
inaccurate.
Such errors demonstrate the lack of
knowledge about native Americans at
Stanford. We see theme houses as func
tioning both to provide cohesion and
support for their members as well as to
educate the general Stanford populace.
We hope to see a native American
theme house established at Stanford in
the near future.

Despite the autumn sunshine, these
existential crises have a way of coming
around again. Today I found myself
asking myself an anguishing question:
would I have the courage to vote with
the 12 against the abolition of Solidar
ity in the Polish Parliament? It doesn't
help much to know that Poland is far
away or to be "over the hill" and know
that one had answered affirmatively in
the past.
Maybe one should go play some vig
orous tennis, as one's wife suggests, and
forget about it... Maybe I am a hope
less "malcontent" and Lech Walesa an
other, a compulsive rebel who would
not rest quiet under any regime. Maybe
Reagan who called Jaruzelski and his
henchmen "lousy bums" is an eternal
adolescent. Maybe the pope is another
vestigial freak. And soon it strikes one
that any sort of profound caring or con
cern has become suspect in our cool en
vironment.
After all, Stanford now leads the
world in computer science, what more
could anyone want? Why should we
worry that the humanities have
dropped into the basement (roughly an
80 percent drop in humanities majors)
in the last few years? They merely ask
embarassing questions about life, raise
tragic issues and might even lead to a
quaint need for belief in something.

Clay Moltz's notion that the United
