## Education: an uncertain future 
### 
Having returned to the classroom
once again this year, we find ourselves
at a treacherous crossroads. Some of us
are finally faced with career decisions,
others must choose a major, while still
others spend their time trying to figure
out how to pay for all this.
At the same time, education, too,
finds itself facing critical decisions.
Never before has the future of educa
tion been so unpredictable. With ram
pant budget cuts, skyrocketing tuition
and shrinking job markets, no one
knows what's next for education.
The only certainty is that everyone
has a complaint. Employers and gradu
ate schools complain about poorly pre
pared students; universities and
educators gripe about unmotivated stu
dents and the trend away from a liberal
education; parents complain about
costs; students complain about ev
erything from food service to work
loads.
But who is to blame for the current
state of education? While everyone
complains, few are willing to take re
sponsibility. Certainly, students must
accept some of the blame as many today
are more concerned about jobs and sta
tus.than knowledge and wisdom. And
when intellectual curiosity is sup
planted by job security we cheat
ourselves out of a true education.
However, using students as the
scapegoat, as tempting as it may be,
proves inadequate. There is currently so
much pressure on students to get a good
job or to get into graduate school that is
has become so much easier to get
through college playing the games of
the trade and making sure you do ev
erything you can to keep that pros
pective employer or admissions direc
tor happy. Students who desire a liberal
education are now faced with endless
days of explaining their choice to pa
rents, friends, professors and em
ployers.
And the pressure comes from all
sides. Even though employers openly
advocate a liberal education, you can be
sure they would not want their children
to major in philosophy. Sure Citicorp
may hire a liberal arts major but that
person better have excellent grades and
a strong background in economics.
That is unfortunate because if you

talk to people who work in the real
world they will tell you that they
learned their trade through the job.
People can train you to work with num
bers but they will not train you in the
skills that come with a liberal educa
tion, such as critical analysis or logical
reasoning.
Pressure also comes from the econo
my. As unemployment remains high,
students realize that a Stanford
diploma is no longer a guarantee of em
ployment. So they seek marketable
skills, or at least skills that appear mar
ketable like a class in accounting.

Universities are also not without
their share of responsibility. Even
though the rhetoric about how "tran
script evaluation" is more important
than grades for admissions to graduate
school, what they fail to tell you is that,
trnly those with good grades succeed in
having their transcripts evaluated. And
only rarely are students rewarded for
taking challenging classes. Instead, they
are rewarded for their numerical con
tent, grades and test scores, rather than
educational content.
Unfortunately, the game-playing
that ensues from the demands made
upon students detracts from the value
of education. Gerald Wilson, an assis
tant dean at Duke University, recently
noted, "I swear if I said to pre-law stu

dents that the way to get into law school
would be to take Chinese, they would
rush out en masse and sign up." It's fun
ny, but it's true.
Although those who get good jobs or
into the graduate school of their choice
appear to be the winners at the educa
tional game, the losers outnumber the
winners and they are all those who
shortchange themselves on their
education. Let's face it, it is easy to get a
diploma once you are here, it is the
education that you have to work for.
No one will hand us an education on
graduation day; we have to seek it

No one will hand us an education on graduation
day; we have to seek it ourselves. And this means
we have to stop trying to please others with our
educational pursuits.

ourselves. And this means we have to
stop trying to please others with our
educational pursuits. Instead of thiflk
ing about what will look good on {he
transcript, we have to ask what will we
jgarn from a particular class?
Our undergraduate experience is usu
ally a once-in-a-lifetime thing. It would
be silly to waste it by pursuing classes
we enjoy, and by not attaining an
education. We need to experiment
while we are here, challenge ourselves
intellectually, and try to put the outside
demands on us out of our minds, at
least temporarily. And only then will we
receive an education as well as a
diploma on graduation day.

ourselves. And this means we have to
stop trying to please others with our
educational pursuits. Instead of thiflk
ing about what will look good on {he
transcript, we have to ask what will we
jgarn from a particular class?
Our undergraduate experience is usu
ally a once-in-a-lifetime thing. It would
be silly to waste it by pursuing classes
we enjoy, and by not attaining an
education. We need to experiment
while we are here, challenge ourselves
intellectually, and try to put the outside
demands on us out of our minds, at
least temporarily. And only then will we
receive an education as well as a
diploma on graduation day.
(Michael Selmi is a senior majoring in

Having returned to the classroom
once again this year, we find ourselves
at a treacherous crossroads. Some of us
are finally faced with career decisions,
others must choose a major, while still
others spend their time trying to figure
out how to pay for all this.
At the same time, education, too,
finds itself facing critical decisions.
Never before has the future of educa
tion been so unpredictable. With ram
pant budget cuts, skyrocketing tuition
and shrinking job markets, no one
knows what's next for education.
The only certainty is that everyone
has a complaint. Employers and gradu
ate schools complain about poorly pre
pared students; universities and
educators gripe about unmotivated stu
dents and the trend away from a liberal
education; parents complain about
costs; students complain about ev
erything from food service to work
loads.
But who is to blame for the current
state of education? While everyone
complains, few are willing to take re
sponsibility. Certainly, students must
accept some of the blame as many today
are more concerned about jobs and sta
tus.than knowledge and wisdom. And
when intellectual curiosity is sup
planted by job security we cheat
ourselves out of a true education.
However, using students as the
scapegoat, as tempting as it may be,
proves inadequate. There is currently so
much pressure on students to get a good
job or to get into graduate school that is
has become so much easier to get
through college playing the games of
the trade and making sure you do ev
erything you can to keep that pros
pective employer or admissions direc
tor happy. Students who desire a liberal
education are now faced with endless
days of explaining their choice to pa
rents, friends, professors and em
ployers.
And the pressure comes from all
sides. Even though employers openly
advocate a liberal education, you can be
sure they would not want their children
to major in philosophy. Sure Citicorp
may hire a liberal arts major but that
person better have excellent grades and
a strong background in economics.
That is unfortunate because if you

talk to people who work in the real
world they will tell you that they
learned their trade through the job.
People can train you to work with num
bers but they will not train you in the
skills that come with a liberal educa
tion, such as critical analysis or logical
reasoning.
Pressure also comes from the econo
my. As unemployment remains high,
students realize that a Stanford
diploma is no longer a guarantee of em
ployment. So they seek marketable
skills, or at least skills that appear mar
ketable like a class in accounting.

Universities are also not without
their share of responsibility. Even
though the rhetoric about how "tran
script evaluation" is more important
than grades for admissions to graduate
school, what they fail to tell you is that,
trnly those with good grades succeed in
having their transcripts evaluated. And
only rarely are students rewarded for
taking challenging classes. Instead, they
are rewarded for their numerical con
tent, grades and test scores, rather than
educational content.
Unfortunately, the game-playing
that ensues from the demands made
upon students detracts from the value
of education. Gerald Wilson, an assis
tant dean at Duke University, recently
noted, "I swear if I said to pre-law stu

dents that the way to get into law school
would be to take Chinese, they would
rush out en masse and sign up." It's fun
ny, but it's true.
Although those who get good jobs or
into the graduate school of their choice
appear to be the winners at the educa
tional game, the losers outnumber the
winners and they are all those who
shortchange themselves on their
education. Let's face it, it is easy to get a
diploma once you are here, it is the
education that you have to work for.
