# The 						mystery of empty Lake Lagunita
## 
### JEFF WEXLER 
For the freshman who has never visited
the Stanford campus prior to orientation,
the campus tour led by the ever so friendly
red-shirted orientation volunteer is an ex
tremely confusing experience.
Perhaps one of the greatest moments of
discomfort occurs when the tour guide
waves a hand over a large expanse of dirt
and explains, "This is one of Stanford's
most beautiful attractions, Lake
Lagunita."
Not wishing to appear naive in the pres
ence of an upperciassman, the freshman
may fidget, figuring that this is some kind
of campus joke. The tour guide may ex
plain that the lake doesn't fill up until late
in the winter quarter, and, figuring that
the situation is completely understood,
will point to the boathouse which, of
course, is situated on the shores of beau
tiful Lake Lagunita.
But why is the lake drained? The reason
stems from the fact that the lake has no
major circulation whatsoever. The water
fills the lake in early spring and lies dor
mant until it is drained.
Don Carlson, director of University re
lations for the Office of Public Affairs, ex
plains that because the lake is not lined
and doesn't circulate, it would gather
mosquitoes if it wasn't drained. To pre
vent the lake from becoming an un
sanitary health hazard, the University
drains it during the summer months, a
quite simple process.
In front of the boathouse is a valved
pipe that runs under the University down
past the Stadium. Emptying the lake is
almost as easy as emptying a bathtub â€”
just open the drain. The lake is then
dredged and readied for the next rainy sea
son.
Lake Lagunita has been a part of the
Farm from the days when this was a farm.
Leland Stanford, California's governor at
the time, built Lake Lagunita in the 1870s
to add to the beauty of his farm where he
raised 600 horses. When the land was de
veloped for use as a University, five water

wells supplied the campus with all of its
water supply, much of which percolated
down into the ground from the lake.
Today, Lake Lagunita is "simply a rec
reational lake," said Carlson. According
to Carlson, the lake is usually filled by late
March.
Its main water supply come from two
other lakes: Felt Lake and Searsville Lake.
These lakes supply two creeks: the Lost
Trancos Creek and the San Francisquito
Creek, respectively. A mile below the
point where the creeks meet is a weir, a
man-made dam designed to regulate and
divert the water's flow.
As the winter's rain increase, the water
is moving at a fast enough rate to overflow
the weir and fall into a man-made creek,
called a flume. The flume crosses the Stan
ford Golf Course through a series of pipes
and then enters the lake. The rains stops in
April and then the public relations staff

brings out its cameras to photograph
beautiful Lake Lagunita, conveniently
(but not continuously) located on the cam
pus of Stanford University.
Lake Lagunita is one of a few reasons
why freshmen are advised to take a "light
load" in the spring. Windsurfing, sun
bathing, sailing and rubber-rafting are
some of the staples of the Stanford stu
dent's diet come spring. An annual
Lagunita event is the Aqua Follies, spon
sored by the Interfraternity Council, and
many classes involving lake sports are of
fered by the Athletic Department.
It is interesting to note that something
that becomes so important to Stanford
students spring quarter is nothing but a
field of dredged dirt for two-thirds of the
year. Perhaps the fact that we don't have
Lake Lagunita most of the time increases
our appreciation of it.

FULL LAKE: Lake Lagunita is a popular recreational facility here in the spring
when it is filled to capacity, but it looks somewhat different now that its water has
been drained to prevent it from becoming a health hazard.
