Japan's Suzuki to resign
Tokyo —Prime Minister Zenko Suzuki launched a new round of wheeling
and dealing among the leaders of Japan's conservative political factions yes
terday with the surprise announcement that he is quitting next month after
two years in office.
Three other members of the ruling Liberal Democratic Party were con
sidered leading contenders to become party president and Japan's 16th post
war government chief. They were Shintaro Abe, 58, the minister of interna
tional trade and industry; Toshio Komoto, 71, head of the Economic Plan
ning Agency, and Yasuhiro Nakasone, 64, director-general of the Adminis
trative Management Agency.
However, no change is expected in the government's pro-Western foreign
policy. Nor is any change expected in the long-term economic policy of pro
moting exports and restricting imports without incurring retaliatory meas
ures from trading partners.
"Nothing will change no matter who becomes prime minister," said one
young businessman, expressing the view of many Japanese interviewed after
the announcement by Suzuki.
Senior party leaders are scheduled to meet tomorrow to discuss choosing
the next party president. In Japan's parliamentary system of government,
the president of the majority party is assured of being elected prime minister
by Parliament.
Observers said the party elders would try to agree on one man acceptable
to all their factions. If they can't, the choice will be made either by an election
in which all 1.5 million party members could vote or by a vote of the party's
437 members of Parliament at a caucus already scheduled for mid-Novem
ber.
The 71-year-old Suzuki had been assured of re-election at the November
caucus. But his standing with the public had dropped to only 16 percent on
one recent opinion poll because of his government's failure to lift the econo
my out of a recession. And in the past month two factional leaders of his
party, former Prime Ministers Takeo Miki and Takeo Fukuda, openly at
tacked him, a sign of strife in a party that prefers to keep its disputes away
from the public eye.
Miki objected to his ties with former Prime Minister Kakuei Tanaka, who
still heads the party's largest faction although he is on trial for bribery in the
Lockheed payoffs scandal. Fukuda condemned the government's economic
policies.
Suzuki was plucked from political obscurity to become prime minister in
1980 after the death of Prime Minister Masayoshi Ohira. Although he had
held few major government posts, he was known as a skilled mediator and
got the crucial backing of Tanaka, who controls 108 of the party s 437 mem
bers in the Diet.
Gdansk Hots continue
Gdansk, Poland —Poland's martial-law regime militarized the Lenin Ship
yard here yesterday after a second straight day of anti-government strikes
and protests disrupted this Baltic seaport.
Polish television said the action was taken
"in connection with the disturbances of work
and the paralyzing of work" at the shipyard.
The militarization means that any further re
fusal to work by shipyard employees exposes
them to severe punishment under court
martial.
In a protest against the dissolution last week
of the Solidarity independent trade union,
shipyard workers struck Monday and they
again refused to work yesterdav. Later, a sec
ond round of violent street clashes broke out
between riot police and demonstrators.
Polish television showed film yesterday of
the previous day's protest, and announced that
148 persons had been detained.
Protesters are demanding restoration of Sol
idarity, freedom for union leader Lech Walesa
and other internees, and an end to martial law.
The authorities reinforced an already
massive security presence in the city yesterday.
Some strikers were handed dismissal notices,
onl> 24 hours after their protest began, and
others were arrested. Shipyard workers said
that management threatened yesterday after
noon to fire anyone who did not begin work
ing.
As they had on Monday, the strikers left the
yard peaceably at the end of their shift. But
they said thev would return today and continue
their protest.
The decision to militarize the shipyard was
announced on the main television news yester
day night, and it is uncertain how it might af
fect the workers' determination.
The authorities clearly hope militarization
will end the threat before the shipyard strike
spreads to other enterprises.
If any significant number of large factories
join the strike or if street demonstrations si
multaneously spread to many more cities, it
might pose a challenge that the martial-law re
gime could not meet.
Later yesterday, police used tear gas, per
cussion grenades, flares and water cannons to
disperse demonstrators who continued to ram
page through the city into the evening. The
narrow cobblestone streets of Gdansk's re
stored "old town" were choked with bluish
haze from round after round of tear gas.
The protesters overturned gargage con
tainers and erected barricades along several
miles of the area's main thoroughfare. Streets
were littered with rocks, glass, and spent tear
gas canisters.
In ■.üburban Wrzeszcz. where Solidarity's
headquarters used to he located, protesters up
ended a 30-foot-long mobile construction
trailer And nearby, the main Grunwald Street
was partly blocked bv severjl sections of large
diameter gas pipelines. Several barricades
made from broken park benches were set afire.
A leaflet signed by the "Interfactory Protest
Committee of the tri-city" (including Gdansk
and the neighboring coastal towns of Gdynia
and Sopot) called on "all members and sympa
thizers of Solidarity to begin strike action and
join the striking shipyard workers."
The leaflet cited unspecified reports that
strikes have also begun "in more than a dozen
big industrial plants in southern and central
Poland."
It called the current wave of strikes "the last
chance for a better tomorrow."
At a Warsaw press conference, government
spokesman Jerzy Urban asserted that ortly
about 10 percent to 13 percent of the Lenin
Shipyard workforce of more than 12,000 was
involved in the strike. Urban also said that 8
plants had been affected by stikes Monday.
Shipyard workers conceded that some em
ployees did not go along with the action, but
insisted that the great majority supported the
protest.
Market rally slows
New York — The stock market turned in a
mixed performance >esterday, interrupting an
explosive rally.
Analysts said investors sold blue-chip stocks
to cash in on the 30 percent rise in the Dow
Jones industrials average over the past two
months. But they said buying picked up for
many other issues that had failed to ignite ex
citement earlier.
It was the fifth busiest day ever on the New
York Stock Exchange.
The Dow Jones industrials average, up
109.18 points in the past five sessions to a 17-
month high, fell 9.11 points to 1003.68 in a
seesaw session.

But nine stocks rose in price for every eight
that fell on the NYSE, with 415 issues reaching
52-week highs while onlv two fell to new lows.
Big Board volume totaled 126.36 million
shares, down from Monday's 138.53 million. It
was the fourth straight day in which more than
100 million shares changed hands.
Activity was so heavy that the NYSE ticker
tape ran a record 65 minutes late at mid
afternoon and was still 55 minutes late at the 4
p.m. EDT close of the NYSE.
The surge in stock prices over the past five
sessions reflected drops in interest rates, a be
lief that rates will continue to fall and expecta
tions that the combination of declining rates
and unwinding inflation will revive the econo
mv from recession, according to analysts.
Banks slash prime rate
New York —Four major banks slashed their
prime lending rates a full point to 12 percent on
yesterday, the lowest level in 25 months and a
reflection of sharp declines in interest rates that
have sent stock and bond prices soaring.
Consumer loan rates also are starting to fall.
But declines in those rates will not be as quick
or as deep as the recent cuts in the prime rate,
economists and bankers say.
The U ,S. government is about to pare the in
terest-rate ceiling on federally backed loans for
single-family homes to 12.5 percent from 13.5
percent, government sources said. The ceiling
on loans under the Federal Housing Adminis
tration and Veterans Administration pro
grams has not been below 13 percent since Au
gust 1980.
The Department of Housing and Urban De
velopment was expected to formally announce
the new ceiling late yesterday.
The drop in commercial rates has spurred a
strong rally in the stock market. Lower rates
should improve the profits of businesses, and
there are hopes the declines in interest will en
courage more consumer buying and help the
economy rebound.
Morgan Guaranty Trust Co. in New York,
the nation's fifth largest commercial bank, in
itiated the cut in the prime rate to 12 percent
from 13 percent. It later was matched by Bank
of America, the nation's largest bank, Manu
facturers Hanover Trust, No. 4, and Chemical
Bank, No. 6. Other banks held at the 13 per
cent level adopted by the industry Thursday.
The prime rate last stood at 12 percent on
Sept. 12, 1980, a period when it had started to
rise and was climbing to a record 21.5 percent
in December 1980.
President Reagan, referring to the Morgan
Guaranty decision, said at the end of a bill
signing ceremony in Washington that he was
"mightv pleased to see another burst of sun
shine this morning."
"That's one more confirmation we're on
course," he said to a group gathered in the
White House Rose Garden.
The prime, which stood at 16 percent in late
July, does not have a direct effect on consumer
loans but indicates where market rates in gen
eral are headed — and those rates are falling
fast.
Reagan speech angers Dems
Washington —A partisan wrangle erupted
vesterdav over President Reagan's plans to de
liver a nationally televised address on the econ
omy tonight, less than three weeks before the
congressional elections.
Democratic Party National Chairman
Charles Manatt complained that network TV
coverage of the president's talk (at 4:30 p.m.
PDT) on his economic program would "create
an unfair advantage for the Republican Party
that you cannot possibly redress by providing
time for a Democratic response."
Manatt, who may be the Democrats'
spokesman to reply to Reagan's speech,
argued that the networks would be joining in a
"last-minute partisan campaign" by the presi
dent to affect the Nov. 2 balloting if they car
ried the White House message.
Reagan, who has blamed the economic poli
cies of past Democratic administrations for
causing the recession but takes credit for the re
cent stock market rally and declines in interest
rates and inflation, insisted he would deliver a
non-partisan address.
"Doesn't everyone want the economy to get
better?" he asked reporters who questioned his
ability to remain above the partisan fray.
As of late yesterday,NßC and the Cable
News Network had agreed to televise the presi

dent la I speech. ABC and CBS reserved their
decisions.
Manatt was joined by Rep. Tony Coelho (D-
Calif.) and Sen. Wendell Ford, (D-Ky.),
chairmen of the House and Senate campaign
committees, respectively, in calling on the TV
networks to refuse to carry Reagan's speech.
"Coming as this does 20 days before the
mid-term elections and in the course of a cam
paign in which the president and his policies
have been the major issue, we believe that it
would be unwise and unfair in the extreme for
the networks to carry this speech live," they
said in a telegram to the networks.
The clash occurred as the Department of
Commerce announced that retail sales rose by
a modest 1 percent in September, offsetting
August's decline but. according to private
economists, far below the pace required for a
consumer-led recovery from the recession.
New oil crisis predicted
Washington —While crude oil prices may
fall significantly over the next year as a result of
the global petroleum surplus, the International
Energy Agency yesterday warned of the possi
bility of a new oil crisis in the mid-to-late 1980s
that would "deal a devastating blow" to major
industrial countries.
The 21-nation agency, set up after the
1973-74 Arab oil embargo to assist the United
States and other industrialized nations with
energy policies, said its members are giving his
tory a "good chance to repeat itself by allow
ing themselves to be lulled into a false sense of
security.
The fall in oil prices over the past year has
been a major factor in the decline of inflation in
the United States. But Ulf Lantzke, executive
director of the agency, pointed out this decline
in inflation also has been associated with a de
crease in industrial activity and energy con
sumption.
"We are all familiar with the argument of
some that the energy problem, and I presume
that also means the oil problem, has been
solved," Lantzke said in presenting the agen
cy's new World Energy Outlook at the Na
tional Press Club. "This 'solution' is hardly
satisfactory because poor economic growth
has contributed heavily to the reduction of
energy demand.
"If average annual economic growth in in
dustrialized countries remains around 2 per
cent for the next decade, I would agree energy
probably will not be a big problem for the rest
of this decade. But I doubt any democratic so
ciety could accept the increasing unemploy
ment which such low growth would entail."
In its report the agency said, "There are no
grounds for believing our energy problems
have been solved. The basic vulnerability of the
world economy to oil supply disruptions is far
from being eliminated.
"The outlook for a period of declining real
oil prices may . . . cause both complacency
among energy consumers and hesitation
among domestic energy producers. The result
would be that potential problems foreseen for
the late 1980s and early 1990s will not be dealt
with in time."
While the agency agreed "positive results are
beginning to show" from improved conserva
tion policies and the increased use of coal and
other fuels, it said it will take "one to two dec
ades before a reasonable balance among
energy supplies can be achieved on a lasting
basis."
In the meantime, the agency said, there is a
"danger that conservation and investment ef
forts" in alternate fuels may slow down in reac
tion to a sluggish economy that has depressed
energy demand and a world oil market that is
"likely to remain deceptively stable through
the mid-1980s."
The current worldwide oil surplus, the agen
cy said, is deceptive in that it reflects the com
bined effects of the global recession, unusually
mild winter weather conditions and a decision
by major oil companies to reduce their inven
tories.
But the underlying market trends, the agen
cy said, point to world oil demand soaking up
this surplus by the mid-1980s, with demand
then surging ahead of available supplies by as
much as "9 million to 21 million barrels per
day by the end of the century."
This forecast of an increasingly tight world
oil market, the agency said, is based on the like
lihood that oil production in North America,
the North Sea and the Soviet Union will level
off or decline, while production by the Or

ganization of Petroleum Exporting Countries
is "restrained by declining reserves in some
countries and political decisions in others."
At the same time, the agency said, the in
dustrial countries will continue to rely heavily
on imported oil, and will find themselves in
creasingly competing for available supplies
with Third World nations, whose "oil import
requirements are expected to rise significantly
... as a result of economic development, in
creasing urbanization and industrialization."
Reagan welcomes Suharto
Washington — President Reagan welcomed
Indonesian President Suharto, leader of the
world's fifth most populous nation, to the
White House yesterday for a state visit clouded
by nagging diplomatic and strategic issues and
bv questions raised in Congress over Jakarta's
human rights record.
After White House talks and a luncheon
with Secretary of State George Shultz, Indo
nesian Foreign Minister Mochtar Kusumaat
madja said he was satisfied with the U.S. ex
planation of its policy on one of those issues —
increased armaments and defense responsi
bilities for Japan.
Just as Mochtar was preparing to respond to
a question about Indonesia's actions on the is
land of East Timor, however, John Holdridge,
assistant secretary of state for East Asian af
fairs, took over the microphones in the State
Department lobby to give the standard U.S. re
sponse on sensitive human rights issues.
"All subjects of importance to the two coun
tries — global, regional and bilateral — were
discussed," Holdridge said, adding that the
Reagan administration prefers what it calls
quiet diplomacy when it comes to rights mat
ters.
Human rights concerns caused strains be
tween the United States and Indonesia during
the Carter administration, but Reagan has
chosen to give precedence to strategic interests
and has been less vocal publicly on rights issues
except as regards the Soviet bloc.
Court hears tax break case
Washington —A Department of Justice of
ficial yesterday defended the Reagan adminis
tration's attempt to grant federal tax exemp
tions to private schools that exclude blacks,
but assured the Supreme Court that the gov
ernment remains committed to ending racial
bias in the nation's schools.
"The United States government has no to
lerance for racial discrimination in the field of
education, either public or private," Assistant
Attorney General William Reynolds told the
court during a 90-minute hearing. Exclusion of
minorities by these schools "unquestionably
runs afoul of national public policy," he said.
Nevertheless, Reynolds told the court, the
Reagan administration decided to overturn the
Internal Revenue Service's 10-year-old policy
of denying tax breaks to these schools because
it felt Congress had never authorized the IRS
to do this. "We found no evidence that (Con
gress) intended to delegate broad authority to
the IRS," Reynolds said.
Reynolds' assertions were repeatedly
challenged by William Coleman Jr., the promi
nent Washington attorney who was appointed
by the Supreme Court to defend the IRS policy
after it was abandoned by the Reagan adminis
tration. Coleman told the justices that over the
past decade, Congress has often signaled its de
sire to deny tax benefits to racially biased
schools.
The conflicting claims arose in a Supreme
Court case in which Bob Jones University in
Greenville, S.C., and the Goldsboro Christian
Schools in Goldsboro, N.C., are seeking to
gain federal tax exemptions.
The Goldsboro schools do not admit blacks.
Bob Jones admits them but maintains a strict
policy against interracial dating or marriage
among its students. Both institutions say that
their racial policies are an outgrowth of their
religious beliefs.
The Supreme Court must decide whether the
IRS had legal authority to deny tax exemptions
to racially biased schools — and, if so, whether
the denial of tax breaks interfered with Bob
Jones' and Goldsboro's First Amendment
rights to freedom of religion.
