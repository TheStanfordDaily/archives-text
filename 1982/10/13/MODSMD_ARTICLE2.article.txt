Japan's Suzuki to resign
Tokyo —Prime Minister Zenko Suzuki launched a new round of wheeling
and dealing among the leaders of Japan's conservative political factions yes
terday with the surprise announcement that he is quitting next month after
two years in office.
Three other members of the ruling Liberal Democratic Party were con
sidered leading contenders to become party president and Japan's 16th post
war government chief. They were Shintaro Abe, 58, the minister of interna
tional trade and industry; Toshio Komoto, 71, head of the Economic Plan
ning Agency, and Yasuhiro Nakasone, 64, director-general of the Adminis
trative Management Agency.
However, no change is expected in the government's pro-Western foreign
policy. Nor is any change expected in the long-term economic policy of pro
moting exports and restricting imports without incurring retaliatory meas
ures from trading partners.
"Nothing will change no matter who becomes prime minister," said one
young businessman, expressing the view of many Japanese interviewed after
the announcement by Suzuki.
Senior party leaders are scheduled to meet tomorrow to discuss choosing
the next party president. In Japan's parliamentary system of government,
the president of the majority party is assured of being elected prime minister
by Parliament.
Observers said the party elders would try to agree on one man acceptable
to all their factions. If they can't, the choice will be made either by an election
in which all 1.5 million party members could vote or by a vote of the party's
437 members of Parliament at a caucus already scheduled for mid-Novem
ber.
The 71-year-old Suzuki had been assured of re-election at the November
caucus. But his standing with the public had dropped to only 16 percent on
one recent opinion poll because of his government's failure to lift the econo
my out of a recession. And in the past month two factional leaders of his
party, former Prime Ministers Takeo Miki and Takeo Fukuda, openly at
tacked him, a sign of strife in a party that prefers to keep its disputes away
from the public eye.
Miki objected to his ties with former Prime Minister Kakuei Tanaka, who
still heads the party's largest faction although he is on trial for bribery in the
Lockheed payoffs scandal. Fukuda condemned the government's economic
policies.
Suzuki was plucked from political obscurity to become prime minister in
1980 after the death of Prime Minister Masayoshi Ohira. Although he had
held few major government posts, he was known as a skilled mediator and
got the crucial backing of Tanaka, who controls 108 of the party s 437 mem
bers in the Diet.
