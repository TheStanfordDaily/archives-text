Once Around the Quad announcements are printed daily as a
service to the public. Announcements must be for events that are
open to the public, free-of-charge and sponsored by not-for-profit
groups. Deadline for announcements is 1 p.m., two business days
before publication. Announcements should be delivered in person,
and should placed in the appropriate slot just inside the Daily front
door. .
