## Booters expect tough fight today against Santa Clara 
### SID SPAETH 
Stanford soccer coach Nelson
Lodge was making the same pre
diction about today's Santa
Clara game as he did about San
Jose State last weekend^
"1-0, 2-1, or overtime."
The game will be close, he is
sure of that, but he said, "We just
hope luck is on our side instead of
that crap last week."
I Stanford lost 2-1 to San Jose
State last Saturday in overtime
after taking a 1-0 lead into the
plosing minutes of the game.
; "Our mistake was that after we
scored, we went into a defensive
game and opened up the field for
them," Lodge said. "We had just
one mistake. He did it in front of
our net — a flagrant foul. He did
it in front of God. He did it in

front of the referee. He did it in
front of everyone."
Lodge was describing a foul by
goalie Willie Burkhardt in front
of his net shortly into overtime.
Burkhardt found himselfin front
of the net' ith a San Jose striker
alone with the ball. He fouled
him to avoid a goal and the
Spartan booted in a penalty kick
to win the game.
Lodge expects an equally close
game today at 2 p.m. at Harry
Maloney Field, but feels his
Cardinal squad has a minor ad
vantage in that they finish up at
tacks better.
"That is our only advantage
over Santa Clara," Lodge said.
"I think we can finish (attacks)
better than they can. You can at

tack all day, but if you don't fin
ish it off, it isn't worth a damn."
Lodge has been extremely hap
py about his team's ability to at
tack.
"We really strike well," Lodge
said. "Our three front men —
Jorge (Titinger, junior striker),
Giancarlo (Ferruzzi, sophomore
striker) and (freshman striker
Todd) Rafalovich really can
strike. Plus we have midfielders
Angel (Vazquez) and either
Bruce Finley or Albert Jordan
who can strike. We can also
strike from the back."
Lodge credited a lot of the
team's outstanding defensive
performance to this ability to
strike often.
"We took 20 shots against San

Jose," he said. "Our trouble was
we didn't put any in, but it really
helps out the defense. You look
at our shutouts (three in a row
before San Jose State), that's not
just defense, that's the whole
team. We were scoring four and
five goals in those games. 1 think
our style of play allows us to at
tack often."
Santa Clara will counter with
an exceptional defense. Lodge
said their goaltender is a national
team player, their sweeper is an
"extremely strong player" and
they possess a very good mid
fielder. All will be working to
keep the Cardinal from finishing
their attacks.
Lodge said the game is an ex
tremely important one for his

team. He said Berkeley, Stan
ford, San Jose State, Santa Clara
and Fresno State are all teams
that are within one goal of each
other.
Although it is a conference
game, Lodge said that is not the
most important factor.
"Conference records don't
mean anything in the rankings,"
Lodge said. "What counts in ov
erall rankings is who you beat.
We can't afford to lose because
they are a worthy opponent. If
our defense holds up, 1 think we
can be on the right side of the
score because this is going to be a
really close game — 1-0, 2-1 or
overtime."

"Conference records don't
mean anything in the rankings,"
Lodge said. "What counts in ov
erall rankings is who you beat.
We can't afford to lose because
they are a worthy opponent. If
our defense holds up, 1 think we
can be on the right side of the
score because this is going to be a
really close game — 1-0, 2-1 or
overtime."

Stanford soccer coach Nelson
Lodge was making the same pre
diction about today's Santa
Clara game as he did about San
Jose State last weekend^
"1-0, 2-1, or overtime."
The game will be close, he is
sure of that, but he said, "We just
hope luck is on our side instead of
that crap last week."
I Stanford lost 2-1 to San Jose
State last Saturday in overtime
after taking a 1-0 lead into the
plosing minutes of the game.
; "Our mistake was that after we
scored, we went into a defensive
game and opened up the field for
them," Lodge said. "We had just
one mistake. He did it in front of
our net — a flagrant foul. He did
it in front of God. He did it in

front of the referee. He did it in
front of everyone."
Lodge was describing a foul by
goalie Willie Burkhardt in front
of his net shortly into overtime.
Burkhardt found himselfin front
of the net' ith a San Jose striker
alone with the ball. He fouled
him to avoid a goal and the
Spartan booted in a penalty kick
to win the game.
Lodge expects an equally close
game today at 2 p.m. at Harry
Maloney Field, but feels his
Cardinal squad has a minor ad
vantage in that they finish up at
tacks better.
"That is our only advantage
over Santa Clara," Lodge said.
"I think we can finish (attacks)
better than they can. You can at

tack all day, but if you don't fin
ish it off, it isn't worth a damn."
Lodge has been extremely hap
py about his team's ability to at
tack.
"We really strike well," Lodge
said. "Our three front men —
Jorge (Titinger, junior striker),
Giancarlo (Ferruzzi, sophomore
striker) and (freshman striker
Todd) Rafalovich really can
strike. Plus we have midfielders
Angel (Vazquez) and either
Bruce Finley or Albert Jordan
who can strike. We can also
strike from the back."
Lodge credited a lot of the
team's outstanding defensive
performance to this ability to
strike often.
"We took 20 shots against San

Jose," he said. "Our trouble was
we didn't put any in, but it really
helps out the defense. You look
at our shutouts (three in a row
before San Jose State), that's not
just defense, that's the whole
team. We were scoring four and
five goals in those games. 1 think
our style of play allows us to at
tack often."
Santa Clara will counter with
an exceptional defense. Lodge
said their goaltender is a national
team player, their sweeper is an
"extremely strong player" and
they possess a very good mid
fielder. All will be working to
keep the Cardinal from finishing
their attacks.
Lodge said the game is an ex
tremely important one for his

team. He said Berkeley, Stan
ford, San Jose State, Santa Clara
and Fresno State are all teams
that are within one goal of each
other.
Although it is a conference
game, Lodge said that is not the
most important factor.
"Conference records don't
mean anything in the rankings,"
Lodge said. "What counts in ov
erall rankings is who you beat.
We can't afford to lose because
they are a worthy opponent. If
our defense holds up, 1 think we
can be on the right side of the
score because this is going to be a
really close game — 1-0, 2-1 or
overtime."
