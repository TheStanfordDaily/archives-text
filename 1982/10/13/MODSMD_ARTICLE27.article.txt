## Nice guy Davis adds life to anemic Maples gate for basketball 
### 
Tom Davis is a nice guy.
So was Dick Dißiaso, his
predecessor, who resigned last
year after seven seasons as
Stanford basketball coach.
His seasons were spent trying
to stop what seemed to be an
irreversible trend of a losing
Stanford basketball program.
He inherited a losing pro-

The Odes Factor

gram, and his efforts to trans
form it into something com
petitive failed.
Whether Davis will be able
to do what Dißiaso could not
remains to be seen.
Whether he will be able to
reproduce the results he re
aped at Boston College when
he led the Eagles to the
NCAA Tournament two
years running, whether he will
be able to make Stanford
basketball no longer syno
nymous with losing, whether
he will be able to turn the
Cardinal's basketball corner,
remains to be seen.
One thing is certain, how

ever. More than the man on
the bench will be changed for
the upcoming season.
The pre-season statistic
where this is most evident is in
ticket sales. Last year, Stan
ford students found it in their
hearts to purchase 150 season
tickets.
So far for 1982-83, over
1500 student season tickets
have been sold.
So far.
Davis arrived on the scene

and immediately went to
work in the area of public re
lations, putting a student sea
son ticket special together
along with the Athletic De
partment.
"When you're new, you're
not really sure where to be
gin," Davis said. "But I have
learned over the years that the
players enjoy playing more
for the students than for any
other segment of the com
munity. Therefore, we wanted

to find out what kind of in
terest and to what extent there
was interest.
"Frankly, I was surprised
with the results."
Davis is energetic. And he is
not stopping at 1500. His goal
is to sell 2000 by the beginning
of the season in late Novem
ber.
He has also put together a
"Knot Hole Gang" section,
devised especially for kids
who want a special seat at a

special price for the season.
"Rowdy Rick" will lead
cheers. "We're shooting for
2000 fans for the Knot Hole
section also," he said.
"Our ticket policy was to
make the prices reasonable
and promote ticket sales
without plugging ourselves
too much," Davis said. "We
didn't want to come out and
say we'd be great, because we
might not be any good at all.
Our goal was to sell the Pac-10

basketball package."
Davis is hopeful. "We've
had great success with the
sales even with our reputa
tion," he said. "As a coach,
you'd like to think you're at
least a little bit better than ev
eryone says you are. It's excit
ing to think what could hap
pen if we can ever become a
good ballclub."
Davis is ambitious. "It's
conceivable that we could sell
the place (Maples Pavilion)

out in December," he said.
"We think (an attendance of)
7000 is reachable."
Davis is determined.
"We're basically committed
to playing pressure defense
and the fast break," he said.
"We'll apply pressure for 94
feet. We'll try to fast break ev
ery time we get the ball. We'll
strive to be an intense, in
telligent team."
Davis is definitive. "I'll use
all more players," he said. "At
least eight in every half, may
be nine, 10 or 11. I'll use my
bench in an effort to create an
intensity of play."
Davis seems to be on the
right track. Changing the
fan's attitude about Stanford
basketball is a good place to
start in an effort to changing
Stanford basketball. One only
has to venture back two years
ago to when Stanford shocked
UCLA at Maples Pavilion to
see what kind of influence a
packed house can have on a
team.
And Tom Davis is a nice
guv. But that won't be
enough. Ask Dick Dißiaso.

tickets.
So far for 1982-83, over
1500 student season tickets
have been sold.
So far.
Davis arrived on the scene

and immediately went to
work in the area of public re
lations, putting a student sea
son ticket special together
along with the Athletic De
partment.
"When you're new, you're
not really sure where to be
gin," Davis said. "But I have
learned over the years that the
players enjoy playing more
for the students than for any
other segment of the com
munity. Therefore, we wanted

to find out what kind of in
terest and to what extent there
was interest.
"Frankly, I was surprised
with the results."
Davis is energetic. And he is
not stopping at 1500. His goal
is to sell 2000 by the beginning
of the season in late Novem
ber.
He has also put together a
"Knot Hole Gang" section,
devised especially for kids
who want a special seat at a

special price for the season.
"Rowdy Rick" will lead
cheers. "We're shooting for
2000 fans for the Knot Hole
section also," he said.
"Our ticket policy was to
make the prices reasonable
and promote ticket sales
without plugging ourselves
too much," Davis said. "We
didn't want to come out and
say we'd be great, because we
might not be any good at all.
Our goal was to sell the Pac-10

basketball package."
Davis is hopeful. "We've
had great success with the
sales even with our reputa
tion," he said. "As a coach,
you'd like to think you're at
least a little bit better than ev
eryone says you are. It's excit
ing to think what could hap
pen if we can ever become a
good ballclub."
Davis is ambitious. "It's
conceivable that we could sell
the place (Maples Pavilion)

out in December," he said.
"We think (an attendance of)
7000 is reachable."
Davis is determined.
"We're basically committed
to playing pressure defense
and the fast break," he said.
"We'll apply pressure for 94
feet. We'll try to fast break ev
ery time we get the ball. We'll
strive to be an intense, in
telligent team."
Davis is definitive. "I'll use
all more players," he said. "At
least eight in every half, may
be nine, 10 or 11. I'll use my
bench in an effort to create an
intensity of play."
Davis seems to be on the
right track. Changing the
fan's attitude about Stanford
basketball is a good place to
start in an effort to changing
Stanford basketball. One only
has to venture back two years
ago to when Stanford shocked
UCLA at Maples Pavilion to
see what kind of influence a
packed house can have on a
team.
And Tom Davis is a nice
guv. But that won't be
enough. Ask Dick Dißiaso.

Tom Davis is a nice guy.
So was Dick Dißiaso, his
predecessor, who resigned last
year after seven seasons as
Stanford basketball coach.
His seasons were spent trying
to stop what seemed to be an
irreversible trend of a losing
Stanford basketball program.
He inherited a losing pro-

The Odes Factor

gram, and his efforts to trans
form it into something com
petitive failed.
Whether Davis will be able
to do what Dißiaso could not
remains to be seen.
Whether he will be able to
reproduce the results he re
aped at Boston College when
he led the Eagles to the
NCAA Tournament two
years running, whether he will
be able to make Stanford
basketball no longer syno
nymous with losing, whether
he will be able to turn the
Cardinal's basketball corner,
remains to be seen.
One thing is certain, how

ever. More than the man on
the bench will be changed for
the upcoming season.
The pre-season statistic
where this is most evident is in
ticket sales. Last year, Stan
ford students found it in their
hearts to purchase 150 season
tickets.
So far for 1982-83, over
1500 student season tickets
have been sold.
So far.
