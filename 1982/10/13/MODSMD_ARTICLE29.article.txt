# Brewers rip Cards in opener
## 
### Associated Press 
■ St. Louis — Paul Molitor
rapped a record five hits and
Jtlike Caldwell pitched a three-
Hitter as the Milwaukee Brewers
turned into singles hitters and
rbuted the St. Louis Cardinals
IJO-0 in the first game of the
EWorld Series last night.
■ The Brewers, who also had
< four hits by Robin Yount, stole a
'page from St. Louis' one-run-at
fa-time playbook. Milwaukee's 17
|hits included 13 singles, three shy
(of the Series record, and only one

homer for the team that led the
majors this year with 216 home
runs. That was by Ted Simmons
in the fifth innings.
All five of Molitor's hits were
singles, the final hit capping Mil
waukee's four-run ninth ining
and St. Louis' most lopsided loss
of the year.
"Our offense looked more like
St. Louis' tonight, in some
ways," said Caldwell, who re
bounded after being shelled in his
two previous outings.
"We got a lot of scratch hits,"

said Molitor, whose broken-bat
single in the fourth gave him the
first of his two RBlson the night.
"We were aggressive, and as the
Cards well know, if you put the
ball in play on this Astroturf,
you're going to get some base
hits."
Not since 1946 has one World
Series team had more than one
player with four hits. Molitor
broke a record held jointly by 41
other players, including Yount,
who joined the group last night.
The last player to get four hits in
a World Series game was Willie
Stargell of Pittsburgh on Oct. 17,
1979.
"I can remember getting
blown out only about two or
three times this year," St. Louis
Manager Whitey Herzog said.
"But I'm sure we've never been
beaten by 10 runs."
The Brewers scored their first
six runs on 10 hits off St. Louis
playoff hero Bob Forsch as Mil
waukee found itself in very un
familiar territory — in the lead
for once in postseason play.
The Series record of 16 singles
was set by the New York Yan
kees in Game 5 against the Los
Angeles Dodgers in 1978.
"The Brewers have a good
ballclub and we didn't play very
well," Herzog said. "We're lucky
it was only one game. I'm sure
glad we didn't have to play a
double-header."
The Cardinals went down
meekly as Caldwell, a junkball
left-hander, got 10 of his first 15
outs on ground balls. His con
trol, a problem in his previous
two outings, was impeccable. He
issued his only walk with two out
in the sixth inning.
"I've pitched some games as
well as this," said Caldwell, "but
I guess, considering the circum
stances, the trouble I had in Cali
fornia (in the playoffs) and this
was a World Series, this has to be
the best game of my career."
