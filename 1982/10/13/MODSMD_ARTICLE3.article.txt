# Board approves Oxford campus, Stanford West housing design
## 
### JOAN O'CONNELL 
In two far-reaching actions yesterday, the board of
trustees approved the transfer of the Stanford program in
Britain from Cliveden to a location in Oxford and approved
the concept, site and funding for the design of a new housing
project called Stanford West.
The Stanford campus in Oxford should open in 1984, if
the shift goes according to schedule. (See related story, page
3).
The new housing project, to be located off Willow Road,
is designed to combat the perennial bane of the University's
existence â€” the housing shortage for both students and em
ployees.
The board, however, stopped well short of approving the
actual project, because of reportedly intense scrutiny by
some members who were concerned about whether the Uni
versity should take on the considerable landlord responsi
bilities which managing the nearly 1500 units in the project
might bring.
Stanford West, if later approved, will be phased in over a
four to seven-year period, and is expected to provide be
tween 2800 and 3500 Stanford employees and graduate stu
dents with housing.
The Stanford West project will be located on the north
western edge of campus, within Palo Alto and bounded by
San Francisquito Creek, Wi'low Road, Oak Creek Apart
ments and Children's Hospital and Health Council.
As envisioned now, priority for spots there will be given
first to faculty and all regular staff of the University and
Hospital, then to graduate students and postdoctoral fel
lows, then to persons employed on University lands and,
finally, persons working elsewhere in Palo Alto.
Right now the project is being groomed to fit zoning regu
lations and the planning provisions of the Palo Alto Com

prehensive Plan, a 15-year framework for establishing
growth and development limits which has designated the 46
acres for "multiple family residential" housing.
The University also has to consider stipulations posed by
Palo Alto's Below-Market-Rate (BMR) program.
"T! BMR program requires that in developments of ten
or more units, no fewer than 10 percent of the units should be
provided at below market rates to low and moderate-income
families, with more than 10 percent suggested for larger sites
such as Stanford West," a report to the board states.
While final numbers have not yet been decided upon, the
University is currently discussing a 15 percent figure for the
BMR housing units to be built on Stanford West, with these
units built in proportion to the building phases. There is no
planned date for construction to begin.
Against the backdrop of Palo Alto's 300 housing unit in
crease since 1975, when it contained 23,800 units, the Stan
ford project is viewed by many as a sorely needed step
toward stemming the lack of housing in the area, a problem
which is particularly acute in this county because it has been
combined with industrial growth. Some local residents,
meanwhile, view the project as a congestion-producing
specter threatening the beauty and open spaces of the area.
In another field, literally, the trustees approved construc
tion on the home of the women's field hockey team. Thanks
to a 524,500 restricted gift from alumnus Tom Killefer, a
field south of Sunken Diamond and the Stadium has been
achitecturally altered to provide the smooth surface and
proper drainage needed for good play.
The board also discussed possible sites for the relocation
of Serra House, which must be moved to make way for the
planned construction of a cooling tower and a co-generation
facility.
