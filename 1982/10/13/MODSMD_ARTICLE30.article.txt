St. Louis â€” To a man, the St. Louis Cardinals gave credit
where credit belonged following their 10-0 drubbing last night
by the Milwaukee Brewers in Game One of the World Series.
"They have a great team and they showed that tonight," said
shortstop Ozzie Smith from the losers' clubhouse. "They did
the things that it takes to win."
Milwaukee's victory featured a barrage of 17 hits, but the
Cardinals were more in awe of the Brewers' left-hander, Mike
Caldwell, who pitched a three-hitter.
"I'd only seen him in an exhibition game before," said St.
Louis designated-hitter Gene Tenace. "Whatever he was throw
ing he was getting over the plate. You just have to give him cred
it."
To Tenace, playing in his fourth World Series, the contest
before 53,723 at Busch Stadium "just got totally out of hand."
"If you lose a ball game in the ninth inning, you're going to
think back," he said. "This game, we were never in it. It's better
forgotten."
Rendered inconsequential by the Milwaukee offense was an
error in the first inning by Cardinals' first baseman Keith
Hernandez.
"I blew it," said Hernandez, usually reliable at his position,
referring to a drive by Ben Oglivie which he booted to give Mil
waukee two unearned runs. "I'm not going to offer any ex
cuses."
Hernandez acknowledged Caldwell's deliveries were baffling
to both right-handed and left-handed St. Louis hitters.
"He changed speed on the right-handed hitters. With the left
handers his curveball was working well," Hernandez said. "He
moved the ball in and out. He was always on the corners."
Catcher Darrell Porter, who doubled for St. Louis in the sec
ond and singled in the eighth, also was complimentary to the
winning pitcher.
