### Associated Press 
Cockey sville, Md. â€”
Private mediator Sam Kagel
met with the two sides in the
22-day-old National Football
League players strike last
night, then said a news black
out had been imposed on the
negotiations.
Kagel, a San Francisco at
torney named earlier in the
day to mediate the dispute,
flew to the negotiation site in
this Baltimore suburb shortly
after negotiators for the
players association and the
NFL arrived.
"As a condition of the
meeting, 1 have asked all
parties, players and owners,
to make no public comment
while the mediation effort is
ongoing," Kagel said.
There was no word when
the next negotiating session
would take place.
Upon arriving at the site of
the talks, Kagel said he hoped
to break the deadlock that has
taken out four weeks of the
NFL season, adding: "My
tactics are to see whether I can
tire them out before they tire
me out."
Tuesday morning, the NFL
announced that the games of

Oct. 17-IS would not be
played as a result of the
players' strike. "With four
weekends of games not
played, and in view of pre
vious announcements that a
maximum of two weekends of
games could possibly be made
up, at least two weekends of
games have now been lost for
the season," said NFL
spokesman Jim Heffernan.
Kagel, 73, was named to
mediate the contractual dis
pute that resulted in the
players' association calling its
members out on strike on
Sept. 21.
Meanwhile, former Chica
go Bears center Mike Pyle and
ex-St. Louis Cardinals all
purpose player Johnny
Roland were announced yes
terday as the coaches for next
Monday night's scheduled all
star game sponsored by the
striking National Football
League Players Association.
The game is to be played at
the Memorial Coliseum,
home of the NFL's Los An
geles Raiders, with a 6 p.m.,
PDT kickoff.
