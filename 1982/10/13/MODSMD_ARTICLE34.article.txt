1982-83

Welcome to the lively complex dynamic world
of libraries! On more than one hundred miles of
shelving, in over twelve acres of space, the
Libraries of Stanford University house the
seventh largest academic library collection in
the United States. On these shelves are some 4
and 3/4 million volumes, plus sizable holdings
of manuscripts, maps, microforms, sound re
cordings and photographs in addition to mis
cellaneous other traditional and non-tradi
tional library materials.
The complex of libraries at Stanford is di
vided administratively between the University
Libraries and the coordinate libraries. The
former is adminstered through the Provost's
Office and comprises the Cecil H. Green
Library, the J. Henry Mever Memorial (Under
graduate) Library, ten research branches
(seven of them in the sciences), and several
smaller working branch libraries. The coordi
nate libraries — Business, Law, Medicine, Food
Research, Hmver, and SLAC — rejxirt directly
to the school or institution of which they are a
part and, like the University Libraries, are open
to all members of the Stanford community.
Together, the University Libraries and the six
coordinate libraries add to their collective re
sources at the rate of more than 125,000 vol
umes annually. To develop, organize, and pro
cess the collections, and to assist patrons in
their use, over five hundred librarians and sup
port staff work at the 15 libraries across
campus.
The following pages offer an overview of the
collections and senices of the libraries at Stan
ford. These are your libraries and the staffs are
here to provide information as needed or to
assist in locating library materials whether
available here at Stanford or elsewhere. We
hope vou will use this brief introduction to fam
iliarize yourself with these valuable resources
which have been developed and are being
maintained to support the course work and
research of Stanford.
