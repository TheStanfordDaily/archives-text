Collection Development:
Managing the Growth of
Libraiy Collections
As academic programs at Stanford change
and grow, so too must the Libraries' collections.
To support the teaching and research functions
of the Stanford community, the collections
must serve the needs of scholars present and
future with materials published today and
yesterday.
Manv more books are published each year in
the United States alone than any one library can
or should acquire. Additionally, the library
must increasingly acquire and provide a9cess to
data files and other non-book material to serve
the changing information needs of our primary
user group: the faculty and students of Stanford
Universitv. The task thus becomes one of plan
ning, building, evaluating and pruning the col
lections with the aim of meeting these varied
needs. Participation in cooperative collection
development and resource sharing arrange
ments with Berkeley, with the University of
California state-wide, and with the Research
Libraries Group is one strategy designed to ac
complish this task.
More than 30 language and subject area spe
cialists (bibliographers and curators) take part
in the Collection Development Program (CDP)*
at Stanford. Some work full time for CDP, with
broad language area responsibilities serving the
needs of several academic departments, for ex
ample, the Latin American and Iberian, Rus
sian and Eastern European, French and Italian,
and Germanic language curators.
Other bibliographers may spend 10% to 50%
of their time directly on collection development
activities while also managing a branch library
or working in a department or division in the
Green Library. Their collection development re
sponsibilities are generally subject related: Eng
lish and American literature, music, physics,
chemistry, anthropology, psychology, etc.
Regardless of the amount of time spent, all
staff with CDP responsibilities are involved in a
varietv of collection-related tasks. They evalu
ate individual areas of the collections for quality
and utility and familiarize themselves with
course offerings and related programs. They
respond to faculty and student requests for in
dividual items not vet in the collections. All
provide reference assistance in their particular
area(s) of expertise, either formally, i.e. at a
reference desk, or informally, in their offices or
elsewhere.
"Subject Specialists in the Libraries of Stan
ford University," a complete list of CDP bibli
ographers, indicating language or subject spe
cialty, office location, and phone number, is
available at library public service desks.

Courses
Library staff teach a number of courses em
phasizing bibliographic skills, research
methods and library holdings.* LIBRARY I, a 3
unit course entitled "Library Resources and Re
search Methods", is taught each autumn,
winter, and spring quarters by the Meyer li
brarians. The course offers all levels of Stanford
students a practical introduction to library col
lections and services and teaches effective
strategies for finding information. In addition,
librarians offer advanced bibliography courses
in Music, Art History, Slavic, German, Latin
American, and Italian and French studies at
least once each year. A current listing may be
found in Courses and Degrees "Libraries and
Information Services: Courses."
Computerized Literature
Searching
Bv using the Computer Search Sendee in the
libraries of Stanford University, you can have
access to online searches of over 125 biblio
graphic, numeric, and factual databases pro
duced by learned societies, associations, gov
ernment agencies, and other organizations.
Thev are not limited to material owned by the
libraries of Stanford University. The libraries at
Stanford access these databases through con
tracts with various information vendor organi
zations such as Bibliographic Retrieval Services
(BRS), and DIALOG Information Services, Inc.
All libraries on campus, except Lane, restrict
this service to current students, faculty, and
staff of Stanford.
Most of these databases consist of references
to articles in periodicals* and scholarly journals,
conference proceedings, dissertations, books,
government documents, or technical reports.
References to chemical formulas, patents, and
economic statistics are found in other (e.g.,

numeric) databases. Subject areas covered in
clude business and management, engineering
and technology, humanities, life and physical
sciences, and social/behavioral sciences.
When seeking information for funded re
search projects, dissertations, course-related re
search projects, or administrative work, many
people appreciate the speed and labor saving
features of this service. Other valuable assets of
online literature searches are their flexibility,
specificity, and currentness.
The searches are conducted by experienced
library staff members who first interview you to
obtain a clear understanding of the topic under
investigation. During the interview, keywords
are used to construct a pre-search strategy. Dur
ing the search, two or more concepts of related
keywords can be quickly matched for an initial
inquiry. When necessary the strategy can be
modified to better express the question being
searched.
An online search generally yields one or more
unique lists of references — often with sum
maries — to articles in periodicals, scholarly
journals, dissertations, technical reports, books,
or other material on your topic of interest.
These results are generally printed, in a 8 1/2" x
11" format at an off-campus computer. These
offline printouts can be made available to you
in three to five business davs. If vou are in a
hurry, most libraries on campus can print the
results at the library's computer terminal.
In some cases, online searches indicate that
little or no material exists on a given topic. This
can be valuable information for those seeking to
verify the originality of their research.
Both retrospective and current awareness
searches are possible. A retrospective search
covers all or part of a database which typically
spans several years. Current awareness
searches represent an ongoing, automatic pro
cess which provides periodic (e.g., monthly)
searches of one or more databases.
Client charges are based on the number of

computer connect minutes required for the
search plus the cost of offline printouts. A
retrospective search, yielding fifty citations,
might range from an average cost of $10 for the
ERIC database to $30 for BIOSIS Previews, to
$50 for the Smithsonian Science Information
Exchange. Charges for current awareness pro
files, consist of the initial cost to search the
database in establishing the profile as well as a
monthly charge which averages $5 to $10.
Additional information can be found in the
brochure entitled "'Computer Search Services in
the Libraries of Stanford University." Copies of
the brochur? and arrangements for a search
can be obtained at most library reference desks
on campus or bv contacting the General Refer
ence Department of Green Library at 7-1811.
Social Science Data Files
Several hundred non-bibliographic machine
readable data files are available through the
Stanford University Libraries and the Center for
Information Technology. The studies, which
are primarily in the social sciences, are
acquired from the Inter-University Consortium
for Political and Social Research (ICPSR), the
Roper Center, other data archives, government
agencies and research organizations. The data
covers a wide range of topics and includes
census records, election returns, public opinion
polls, surveys of consumer finances and inter
national financial statistics. Data is available
for the United States as well as for a number of
other countries and many of the studies cover a
substantial chronological range.
The Data File Directory, which lists the data
files acquired by the Stanford University Li
braries, is available as a public file on SPIRES
and is also available in printed form at the
Reference Desk, Green Library and some other
campus libraries.
Requests for additional information or data
purchase may be made to your branch libra
rian, bibliographer, or to Karen Wittenborg,
General Reference Department, Green Librarv
7-1811.
Exhibits
In addition to the major exhibits mounted by
the Department of Special Collections, smaller
exhibits are on view for varying periods of time
in the Lurie Rotunda and the Gallery on the
second floor of Green West and in a number of
the branch and coordinate libraries*. These dis
plays, drawing on the holdings* of the depart
ment or library responsible, highlight a particu
lar portion of that collection or publicize new
acquisitions or services. Historical exhibits of
Stanford will be displayed in the Bender Room
when the University Archives moves there after

the first of the year. Schedules are listed in the
Campus Report.
The Hoover Institution Exhibit Pavilion and
the fover of the Tower offer current exhibitions
drawn from collections of the Hoover Institu
tion Library and Archives. Exhibit Pavilion
hours are 11am - 4pm, weekdavs; Tower hours
are Bam - spm, weekdavs, 9am - 4pm, on
Saturdays.
FASTBOOK
FASTBOOK is a book and photocopy delivery
service offered bv the University Libraries
which is designed to help faculty, graduate stu
dents, and staff with their research needs.
Requests for the loan or photocopy of library
materials may be made at any time by calling
497-FAST. FASTBOOK will deliver loaned
materials from the holding library to another
campus library of the requestor's choice, send
photocopies to offices, homes, or campus li
braries, or notify the patron if the material is
unavailable. The call number or location of the
requested material is not required but there is a
charge of IOC per page for photocopies.
Interlibraiy Loan
No single university library, even one as large
and comprehensive as Stanford's, can contain
in its collections all of the recorded information
needed by its faculty and students to pursue
their research. National and even international
interlibrarv agreements, long established for
the mutual support of exceptional research
needs, continue to be relied upon to supple
ment even the most comprehensive research
collections.
Located in Room 151 on the first floor of the
East Wing of the Green Library, the University
Libraries' Interlibrarv Loan staff processes re
quests for needed material not available on
campus. Faculty, registered students and staff
mav submit requests, in person only, on forms
available at most public service desks. (Stu
dents in the Schools of Law, Business, and
Medicine are encouraged to make ILL requests
at their respective coordinate library.)
Interested users should be aware that most
libraries will not lend certain types of material,
such as rare, fragile, or expensive items; basic
reference or heavilv-used books; or genealogical
material, newspapers, periodicals,* and many
American dissertations. Many of these items
are, however, available on microfilm.
Requests may take from 2 or 3 davs to 2 or 3
months to fill, depending on whether the mate
rial is available from another library in the Bay
Area or from somewhere else much farther
afield.
Stanford is a member of the Research Li

braries Group (RLG)* which consists of more
than 25 major research libraries including Yale,
Michigan, Princeton, and Columbia. Com
munication of requests and replies within this
group is bv electronic mail (RLIN* message
system) and the transmission of materials by
United Parcel Service, resulting in much
quicker response than in times past. The RLIN
Message System is also used to send requests to
UC Berkeley and materials are passed between •
the two campuses.
All materials borrowed through Interlibrarv
Loan must be picked up and returned to the
Loan Desk or the Interlibraiy Loan office in
Green Library, East Wing.
Libraiy Resources
Beyond Stanford
In addition to providing traditional inter
librarv loan services, Stanford participates in
several specialized cooperative arrangements
which facilitate access and which broaden con
siderably the range of research materials avail
able to its scholars.
The U.C. Berkeley/Stanford Research
Libraiy Cooperative Program is designed to
make the libraiy resources of the U.C. Berkeley
and the Stanford University Libraries available
to faculty, academic staff and currently regis
tered graduate students from both institutions.
It also provides for cooperative decision
making in the acquisition of expensive and
little-used materials. The Program provides
registered participants with reciprocal borrow
ing privileges at the "other" campus, campus
to-campus delivery of library materials, and
access to one another's bibliographic records.
Copies of Berkeley's Serials* Union List are
located in libraries throughout campus.
Further information is available bv calling
7-1491.
The Research Libraries Group, Inc.
(RLG) is a corporation owned by over 25 re
search and academic libraries including those
at Stanford, the University of California,
Berkeley, Columbia, Yale, and Princeton. RLG
was established to improve the management of
information resources necessary for the ad
vancement of scholarship by increasing access
to bibliographic information and promoting
cooperative programs in collection develop
ment, preservation of libraiy materials, and
shared access to research materials. RLIN (Re
search Libraries Information Network) is RLG's
online bibliographic database which includes
records of books and other materials owned by
these and other libraries such as the Library of
Congress. RLIN is used by member libraries to
order and process books and other materials.
