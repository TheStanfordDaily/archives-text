Collection Development:
Managing the Growth of
Libraiy Collections
As academic programs at Stanford change
and grow, so too must the Libraries' collections.
To support the teaching and research functions
of the Stanford community, the collections
must serve the needs of scholars present and
future with materials published today and
yesterday.
Manv more books are published each year in
the United States alone than any one library can
or should acquire. Additionally, the library
must increasingly acquire and provide a9cess to
data files and other non-book material to serve
the changing information needs of our primary
user group: the faculty and students of Stanford
Universitv. The task thus becomes one of plan
ning, building, evaluating and pruning the col
lections with the aim of meeting these varied
needs. Participation in cooperative collection
development and resource sharing arrange
ments with Berkeley, with the University of
California state-wide, and with the Research
Libraries Group is one strategy designed to ac
complish this task.
More than 30 language and subject area spe
cialists (bibliographers and curators) take part
in the Collection Development Program (CDP)*
at Stanford. Some work full time for CDP, with
broad language area responsibilities serving the
needs of several academic departments, for ex
ample, the Latin American and Iberian, Rus
sian and Eastern European, French and Italian,
and Germanic language curators.
Other bibliographers may spend 10% to 50%
of their time directly on collection development
activities while also managing a branch library
or working in a department or division in the
Green Library. Their collection development re
sponsibilities are generally subject related: Eng
lish and American literature, music, physics,
chemistry, anthropology, psychology, etc.
Regardless of the amount of time spent, all
staff with CDP responsibilities are involved in a
varietv of collection-related tasks. They evalu
ate individual areas of the collections for quality
and utility and familiarize themselves with
course offerings and related programs. They
respond to faculty and student requests for in
dividual items not vet in the collections. All
provide reference assistance in their particular
area(s) of expertise, either formally, i.e. at a
reference desk, or informally, in their offices or
elsewhere.
"Subject Specialists in the Libraries of Stan
ford University," a complete list of CDP bibli
ographers, indicating language or subject spe
cialty, office location, and phone number, is
available at library public service desks.

Courses
Library staff teach a number of courses em
phasizing bibliographic skills, research
methods and library holdings.* LIBRARY I, a 3
unit course entitled "Library Resources and Re
search Methods", is taught each autumn,
winter, and spring quarters by the Meyer li
brarians. The course offers all levels of Stanford
students a practical introduction to library col
lections and services and teaches effective
strategies for finding information. In addition,
librarians offer advanced bibliography courses
in Music, Art History, Slavic, German, Latin
American, and Italian and French studies at
least once each year. A current listing may be
found in Courses and Degrees "Libraries and
Information Services: Courses."
Computerized Literature
Searching
Bv using the Computer Search Sendee in the
libraries of Stanford University, you can have
access to online searches of over 125 biblio
graphic, numeric, and factual databases pro
duced by learned societies, associations, gov
ernment agencies, and other organizations.
Thev are not limited to material owned by the
libraries of Stanford University. The libraries at
Stanford access these databases through con
tracts with various information vendor organi
zations such as Bibliographic Retrieval Services
(BRS), and DIALOG Information Services, Inc.
All libraries on campus, except Lane, restrict
this service to current students, faculty, and
staff of Stanford.
Most of these databases consist of references
to articles in periodicals* and scholarly journals,
conference proceedings, dissertations, books,
government documents, or technical reports.
References to chemical formulas, patents, and
economic statistics are found in other (e.g.,

numeric) databases. Subject areas covered in
clude business and management, engineering
and technology, humanities, life and physical
sciences, and social/behavioral sciences.
When seeking information for funded re
search projects, dissertations, course-related re
search projects, or administrative work, many
people appreciate the speed and labor saving
features of this service. Other valuable assets of
online literature searches are their flexibility,
specificity, and currentness.
The searches are conducted by experienced
library staff members who first interview you to
obtain a clear understanding of the topic under
investigation. During the interview, keywords
are used to construct a pre-search strategy. Dur
ing the search, two or more concepts of related
keywords can be quickly matched for an initial
inquiry. When necessary the strategy can be
modified to better express the question being
searched.
An online search generally yields one or more
unique lists of references — often with sum
maries — to articles in periodicals, scholarly
journals, dissertations, technical reports, books,
or other material on your topic of interest.
These results are generally printed, in a 8 1/2" x
11" format at an off-campus computer. These
offline printouts can be made available to you
in three to five business davs. If vou are in a
hurry, most libraries on campus can print the
results at the library's computer terminal.
In some cases, online searches indicate that
little or no material exists on a given topic. This
can be valuable information for those seeking to
verify the originality of their research.
Both retrospective and current awareness
searches are possible. A retrospective search
covers all or part of a database which typically
spans several years. Current awareness
searches represent an ongoing, automatic pro
cess which provides periodic (e.g., monthly)
searches of one or more databases.
