### 
Among other things, this shared catalog aids
library staff in book selection and interlibrarv
loan functions. Since RLIN also includes infor
mation on material recently ordered or cata
loged, it supplements card catalog information
available in Stanford Libraries. Searches are
conducted bv reference staff at any campus
library.
Publications
The libraries at Stanford put out a variety of
publications designed to advise library users of
library services, make them aware of resources
and collections, and explain techniques for re
trieving specialized information of which they
may not have been aware. There are descrip
tions of various libraries, departments and col
lections such as the "Guide to the Science
Libraries," "Map Collections," and "How to
Find Government Documents." Special inter
ests and research needs are addressed in,
among others, "Computer Search Services in
the Libraries of Stanford University," and
"Reference Materials for the Study of British
and American Literature." Other publications
provide information on recent acquisitions,
borrowing regulations, book locations and
facilities. The libraries' publications are
reviewed periodically and suggestions for addi
tional titles are welcomed.

CECIL H. GREEN
LIBRARY
The Cecil H. Green Library houses most of the
research collections in the humanities and so
cial sciences. These collections, which number
almost two million volumes, are distributed on
eight floors of stacks in three buildings â€” all
accessible through the East Wing of the Green
Library. The newer East Wing, opened in 1980,
is the location of General Reference, Central Cir
culation and the Current Periodicals and Micro
text Room. In the older West Wing, opened in
1919, are Government Documents, Special Col
lections, Univeristy Archives, and the Central
Map Collection.
Central Circulation
The Central Circulation Department is re
sponsible for providing access to, maintaining
and circulating the more than 1-1/2 million
volumes which comprise the main research col
lection of the University Libraries, as well as
administering all study spaces located within
the Green Library.
Upon entering the Green Library everyone is
asked by a member of the Portal Unit to show a
Stanford University identification card. Access
to Library services is available to all Stanford
University faculty, stafT, students and affiliates.
The Privileges Desk staff is happy to answer any
questions regarding access to Green as well as
general information about the Stanford Uni
versity Libraries. Located on the first floor of the
East Wing of the Library, the Privileges Desk is

also the place to direct questions concerning the
assignment of Library study space (including
Faculty Studies and Dissertation Rooms);
branch library hours and locations; the UCB/
Stanford Research Library Cooperative Pro
gram; and public transportation in the Bay
Area and the various commuter services which
serve the Stanford community.
Most humanities and social sciences mate
rials which constitute the main research collec
tion are located in the Green Library Stack,
comprised of the East (E), West (W) and South
(S) stacks. All of these materials are designated
'STACK or 'STIC in the card catalog and in
SULS.* Stack Directories are posted throughout
the Library indicating location of materials by
stack (E,W,S) or other symbol. Some older
materials are located in Auxiliary Storage and
must be requested at the Loan Desk. Loan Desk
staff members will be glad to help readers de
termine in which of the locations material they
are seeking is housed and arrange to have mate
rial paged if necessary.
In addition to charging materials for circula
tion (including checking out Green Library
books and the Green Libraiy Self-Guided Tour
Cassette Tapes), Loan Desk staff offer informa
tion regarding borrowing policies as well as
general Library information; handle Graduate
Reserves; take paging requests for items needed
from the Auxiliary Stack; recall* materials
needed from other readers; search for items not
found on Library shelves; process overdue, lost
or other problem charges, and provide a review
and appeals service regarding assessment of
fees . Questions regarding Lost and Found may
also be directed to Loan Desk staff members.
