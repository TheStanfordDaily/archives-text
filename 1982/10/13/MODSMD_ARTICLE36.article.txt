Libraries," "Map Collections," and "How to
Find Government Documents." Special inter
ests and research needs are addressed in,
among others, "Computer Search Services in
the Libraries of Stanford University," and
"Reference Materials for the Study of British
and American Literature." Other publications
provide information on recent acquisitions,
borrowing regulations, book locations and
facilities. The libraries' publications are
reviewed periodically and suggestions for addi
tional titles are welcomed.

CECIL H. GREEN
LIBRARY
The Cecil H. Green Library houses most of the
research collections in the humanities and so
cial sciences. These collections, which number
almost two million volumes, are distributed on
eight floors of stacks in three buildings — all
accessible through the East Wing of the Green
Library. The newer East Wing, opened in 1980,
is the location of General Reference, Central Cir
culation and the Current Periodicals and Micro
text Room. In the older West Wing, opened in
1919, are Government Documents, Special Col
lections, Univeristy Archives, and the Central
Map Collection.
Central Circulation
The Central Circulation Department is re
sponsible for providing access to, maintaining
and circulating the more than 1-1/2 million
volumes which comprise the main research col
lection of the University Libraries, as well as
administering all study spaces located within
the Green Library.
Upon entering the Green Library everyone is
asked by a member of the Portal Unit to show a
Stanford University identification card. Access
to Library services is available to all Stanford
University faculty, stafT, students and affiliates.
The Privileges Desk staff is happy to answer any
questions regarding access to Green as well as
general information about the Stanford Uni
versity Libraries. Located on the first floor of the
East Wing of the Library, the Privileges Desk is

also the place to direct questions concerning the
assignment of Library study space (including
Faculty Studies and Dissertation Rooms);
branch library hours and locations; the UCB/
Stanford Research Library Cooperative Pro
gram; and public transportation in the Bay
Area and the various commuter services which
serve the Stanford community.
Most humanities and social sciences mate
rials which constitute the main research collec
tion are located in the Green Library Stack,
comprised of the East (E), West (W) and South
(S) stacks. All of these materials are designated
'STACK or 'STIC in the card catalog and in
SULS.* Stack Directories are posted throughout
the Library indicating location of materials by
stack (E,W,S) or other symbol. Some older
materials are located in Auxiliary Storage and
must be requested at the Loan Desk. Loan Desk
staff members will be glad to help readers de
termine in which of the locations material they
are seeking is housed and arrange to have mate
rial paged if necessary.
In addition to charging materials for circula
tion (including checking out Green Library
books and the Green Libraiy Self-Guided Tour
Cassette Tapes), Loan Desk staff offer informa
tion regarding borrowing policies as well as
general Library information; handle Graduate
Reserves; take paging requests for items needed
from the Auxiliary Stack; recall* materials
needed from other readers; search for items not
found on Library shelves; process overdue, lost
or other problem charges, and provide a review
and appeals service regarding assessment of
fees . Questions regarding Lost and Found may
also be directed to Loan Desk staff members.

Materials borrowed through Interlibrary Loan
(ILL) or UCB's Baker Service* may be picked up
at the Loan Desk, located on the first floor of the
East Wing.
With more than 30 miles of book shelves to
maintain, the Stack Division staff is kept busy
reshelving hundreds of books daily as well as
organizing shelves so that books are in their
proper locations when needed. In addition, the
Stack staff administer lockers located through
out the East Stack; page books for the physically
limited; keep study space for library users clear
of extraneous materials; report building prob
lems; keep holders throughout the Library full
of blank charge cards and Stanford University
Library (SUL) Guides; and empty Library book
returns located outside of the Libraiy. Ques
tions may be directed to members of the Stack
staff in the Lower Level Stack Sort Room (Room
42A).
Upon leaving the East Wing, everyone is as
ked bv the Portal Staff to open all bags and
briefcases for inspection of Library materials.
This is to insure against uncharged materials
leaving the Library.
All Central Circulation Department staff look
forward to answering any questions you may
have regarding services offered by the Depart
ment or general informational questions about
the Library.
Central Map Collection
Topographic maps of Nigeria, a wall map of
the Roman Empire, an ethnolinguistic map of
the USSR, a street map of Beijing, maps showing
population distribution in Kenya, the natural
vegetation of California, or gazetteers of place
names — these are but a few of the many useful
items to be found in the central Map Collection,
located in Room 202 on the second floor ofWest
Wing.
A map specialist provides assistance in the
use of the map card catalog, gazetteers and
indexes. She will help a patron find appropriate
cartographic reference works, or locate and re
trieve needed materials from the map cases.
Maps may be loaned to all authorized Stanford
borrowers.
When necessary, the user will be referred to
other campus locations for maps and related
information; for example, the Branner Earth
Sciences Library contains a large collection of
geological maps, or the Phvsics Library houses
astronomical maps, such as the Palomar Sky
Atlas.
Hours for the Central Map Collection are
Monday through Friday, 1 p.m.—s p.m. or by
appointment. Tours are offered on the second
and third Thursdays of the Autumn and Spring
quarters from 3—3:30 p.m. Additional tours
may be arranged with the Map Specialist, Karyl
Tonge (7-1811).

Current Periodicals and
Microtexts Room
The Current Periodicals and Microtexts
Room, located on the lower level of Green
Library's East Wing, houses periodicals*, news
papers, and a diverse collection of microforms.
The periodicals collection consists of the
most recent issues of 4,000 selected academic
journals and popular magazines. Current issues
of other journals may be found with their
bound back files in the Stack or in other li
braries on campus. The Stanford Union List of
Serials (SULS)*, issued quarterly on microfiche,
provides location and holdings information for
serials* held in the University Libraries and in
several coordinate libraries.*
Current issues of fifty domestic and foreign
newspapers can be found in the newspaper
collection, as well as back issues in newsprint
and in microform of over 800 newspaper titles,
some dating back to the early nineteenth cen
tury. Although these newspapers are not listed
in the main card catalog or in SULS, card files
are maintained in the Current Periodicals and
Microtexts Room to provide titles, city of origin
and holdings records. Indexes for a number of
newspapers, including the New York Times,
mav be found in the Reference Room.
The microtexts collections reflect the variety
and diversity of research interests at Stanford. A
small sampling of the collections includes:
Presidential Papers, the Histoiy of Women col
lection, Early American Imprints, the anthro

pological documents contained in the Human
Relations Area File, AEC Technical Reports,
British Parliamentary Papers, census reports
dating back to 1790, and the collection of Three
Centuries of American and British Drama.
These large micropublishing projects were de
signed to make a great body of historical mate
rial easily accessible to scholars.
The individual titles included in most of
these omnibus collections are not listed sepa
rately in the card catalog. However, guides to
the individual collections are available in the
Microtexts Room. Readers interested in mate
rial that may be contained in the microform
collections should inquire at the Reference Desk
or the Current Periodicals and Microtexts Desk.
In addition to microform readers, machines
which produce paper copies from microfilm
and microfiche are available in the Microtexts
Reading Room. There are also portable micro
film readers available for ten day loan.
General Reference Service
"What famous painter was associated with
Flora Tristan?"
"Did Mac Beth ever leave Scotland and if so
where and when did he go?"
"What were the numbers of employed and un
employed workers, and the average wage rates,
during the period of the British General Strike?"
For quick answers to questions like these or
bibliographic assistance for advanced doctoral
or faculty research — or for a variety of infor
mation needs in between — the staff of the
General Reference Department provide expert
help to libraiy users. Located on the main floor
of the Green Libraiy East, the Department re
sponds to in-person requests, telephone calls,
and letters from inquirers on campus, else
where in California, throughout the United
States, and overseas.
To assist in providing these information ser
vices, the staff rely on 35,000 reference volumes,
which, in addition to works of a general nature,
contain specialized material in the humanities
and social sciences, especially in those disci
plines for which no branch or coordinate li
brary exists.
Among the variety of materials housed in the
General Reference Room are atlases, catalogs of
specialized collections in other major libraries,
dictionaries and directories of all kinds, en
cyclopedias, guides to important microfilm col
lections, indexes and abstracts of journal litera
ture, national and trade bibliographies, news
paper indexes, research guides, specialized sub
ject guides, and union lists of serials, Stanford's
as well as others. On-line searches in the social
sciences and humanities are also available for a
fee.

CECIL H. GREEN
LIBRARY
The Cecil H. Green Library houses most of the
research collections in the humanities and so
cial sciences. These collections, which number
almost two million volumes, are distributed on
eight floors of stacks in three buildings — all
accessible through the East Wing of the Green
Library. The newer East Wing, opened in 1980,
is the location of General Reference, Central Cir
culation and the Current Periodicals and Micro
text Room. In the older West Wing, opened in
1919, are Government Documents, Special Col
lections, Univeristy Archives, and the Central
Map Collection.
Central Circulation
The Central Circulation Department is re
sponsible for providing access to, maintaining
and circulating the more than 1-1/2 million
volumes which comprise the main research col
lection of the University Libraries, as well as
administering all study spaces located within
the Green Library.
Upon entering the Green Library everyone is
asked by a member of the Portal Unit to show a
Stanford University identification card. Access
to Library services is available to all Stanford
University faculty, stafT, students and affiliates.
The Privileges Desk staff is happy to answer any
questions regarding access to Green as well as
general information about the Stanford Uni
versity Libraries. Located on the first floor of the
East Wing of the Library, the Privileges Desk is

also the place to direct questions concerning the
assignment of Library study space (including
Faculty Studies and Dissertation Rooms);
branch library hours and locations; the UCB/
Stanford Research Library Cooperative Pro
gram; and public transportation in the Bay
Area and the various commuter services which
serve the Stanford community.
Most humanities and social sciences mate
rials which constitute the main research collec
tion are located in the Green Library Stack,
comprised of the East (E), West (W) and South
(S) stacks. All of these materials are designated
'STACK or 'STIC in the card catalog and in
SULS.* Stack Directories are posted throughout
the Library indicating location of materials by
stack (E,W,S) or other symbol. Some older
materials are located in Auxiliary Storage and
must be requested at the Loan Desk. Loan Desk
staff members will be glad to help readers de
termine in which of the locations material they
are seeking is housed and arrange to have mate
rial paged if necessary.
In addition to charging materials for circula
tion (including checking out Green Library
books and the Green Libraiy Self-Guided Tour
Cassette Tapes), Loan Desk staff offer informa
tion regarding borrowing policies as well as
general Library information; handle Graduate
Reserves; take paging requests for items needed
from the Auxiliary Stack; recall* materials
needed from other readers; search for items not
found on Library shelves; process overdue, lost
or other problem charges, and provide a review
and appeals service regarding assessment of
fees . Questions regarding Lost and Found may
also be directed to Loan Desk staff members.

Materials borrowed through Interlibrary Loan
(ILL) or UCB's Baker Service* may be picked up
at the Loan Desk, located on the first floor of the
East Wing.
With more than 30 miles of book shelves to
maintain, the Stack Division staff is kept busy
reshelving hundreds of books daily as well as
organizing shelves so that books are in their
proper locations when needed. In addition, the
Stack staff administer lockers located through
out the East Stack; page books for the physically
limited; keep study space for library users clear
of extraneous materials; report building prob
lems; keep holders throughout the Library full
of blank charge cards and Stanford University
Library (SUL) Guides; and empty Library book
returns located outside of the Libraiy. Ques
tions may be directed to members of the Stack
staff in the Lower Level Stack Sort Room (Room
42A).
Upon leaving the East Wing, everyone is as
ked bv the Portal Staff to open all bags and
briefcases for inspection of Library materials.
This is to insure against uncharged materials
leaving the Library.
All Central Circulation Department staff look
forward to answering any questions you may
have regarding services offered by the Depart
ment or general informational questions about
the Library.
Central Map Collection
Topographic maps of Nigeria, a wall map of
the Roman Empire, an ethnolinguistic map of
the USSR, a street map of Beijing, maps showing
population distribution in Kenya, the natural
vegetation of California, or gazetteers of place
names — these are but a few of the many useful
items to be found in the central Map Collection,
located in Room 202 on the second floor ofWest
Wing.
A map specialist provides assistance in the
use of the map card catalog, gazetteers and
indexes. She will help a patron find appropriate
cartographic reference works, or locate and re
trieve needed materials from the map cases.
Maps may be loaned to all authorized Stanford
borrowers.
When necessary, the user will be referred to
other campus locations for maps and related
information; for example, the Branner Earth
Sciences Library contains a large collection of
geological maps, or the Phvsics Library houses
astronomical maps, such as the Palomar Sky
Atlas.
Hours for the Central Map Collection are
Monday through Friday, 1 p.m.—s p.m. or by
appointment. Tours are offered on the second
and third Thursdays of the Autumn and Spring
quarters from 3—3:30 p.m. Additional tours
may be arranged with the Map Specialist, Karyl
Tonge (7-1811).

Current Periodicals and
Microtexts Room
The Current Periodicals and Microtexts
Room, located on the lower level of Green
Library's East Wing, houses periodicals*, news
papers, and a diverse collection of microforms.
The periodicals collection consists of the
most recent issues of 4,000 selected academic
journals and popular magazines. Current issues
of other journals may be found with their
bound back files in the Stack or in other li
braries on campus. The Stanford Union List of
Serials (SULS)*, issued quarterly on microfiche,
provides location and holdings information for
serials* held in the University Libraries and in
several coordinate libraries.*
Current issues of fifty domestic and foreign
newspapers can be found in the newspaper
collection, as well as back issues in newsprint
and in microform of over 800 newspaper titles,
some dating back to the early nineteenth cen
tury. Although these newspapers are not listed
in the main card catalog or in SULS, card files
are maintained in the Current Periodicals and
Microtexts Room to provide titles, city of origin
and holdings records. Indexes for a number of
newspapers, including the New York Times,
mav be found in the Reference Room.
The microtexts collections reflect the variety
and diversity of research interests at Stanford. A
small sampling of the collections includes:
Presidential Papers, the Histoiy of Women col
lection, Early American Imprints, the anthro

pological documents contained in the Human
Relations Area File, AEC Technical Reports,
British Parliamentary Papers, census reports
dating back to 1790, and the collection of Three
Centuries of American and British Drama.
These large micropublishing projects were de
signed to make a great body of historical mate
rial easily accessible to scholars.
The individual titles included in most of
these omnibus collections are not listed sepa
rately in the card catalog. However, guides to
the individual collections are available in the
Microtexts Room. Readers interested in mate
rial that may be contained in the microform
collections should inquire at the Reference Desk
or the Current Periodicals and Microtexts Desk.
In addition to microform readers, machines
which produce paper copies from microfilm
and microfiche are available in the Microtexts
Reading Room. There are also portable micro
film readers available for ten day loan.

bound back files in the Stack or in other li
braries on campus. The Stanford Union List of
Serials (SULS)*, issued quarterly on microfiche,
provides location and holdings information for
serials* held in the University Libraries and in
several coordinate libraries.*
Current issues of fifty domestic and foreign
newspapers can be found in the newspaper
collection, as well as back issues in newsprint
and in microform of over 800 newspaper titles,
some dating back to the early nineteenth cen
tury. Although these newspapers are not listed
in the main card catalog or in SULS, card files
are maintained in the Current Periodicals and
Microtexts Room to provide titles, city of origin
and holdings records. Indexes for a number of
newspapers, including the New York Times,
mav be found in the Reference Room.
The microtexts collections reflect the variety
and diversity of research interests at Stanford. A
small sampling of the collections includes:
Presidential Papers, the Histoiy of Women col
lection, Early American Imprints, the anthro

pological documents contained in the Human
Relations Area File, AEC Technical Reports,
British Parliamentary Papers, census reports
dating back to 1790, and the collection of Three
Centuries of American and British Drama.
These large micropublishing projects were de
signed to make a great body of historical mate
rial easily accessible to scholars.
The individual titles included in most of
these omnibus collections are not listed sepa
rately in the card catalog. However, guides to
the individual collections are available in the
Microtexts Room. Readers interested in mate
rial that may be contained in the microform
collections should inquire at the Reference Desk
or the Current Periodicals and Microtexts Desk.
In addition to microform readers, machines
which produce paper copies from microfilm
and microfiche are available in the Microtexts
Reading Room. There are also portable micro
film readers available for ten day loan.

CECIL H. GREEN
LIBRARY
The Cecil H. Green Library houses most of the
research collections in the humanities and so
cial sciences. These collections, which number
almost two million volumes, are distributed on
eight floors of stacks in three buildings — all
accessible through the East Wing of the Green
Library. The newer East Wing, opened in 1980,
is the location of General Reference, Central Cir
culation and the Current Periodicals and Micro
text Room. In the older West Wing, opened in
1919, are Government Documents, Special Col
lections, Univeristy Archives, and the Central
Map Collection.
Central Circulation
The Central Circulation Department is re
sponsible for providing access to, maintaining
and circulating the more than 1-1/2 million
volumes which comprise the main research col
lection of the University Libraries, as well as
administering all study spaces located within
the Green Library.
Upon entering the Green Library everyone is
asked by a member of the Portal Unit to show a
Stanford University identification card. Access
to Library services is available to all Stanford
University faculty, stafT, students and affiliates.
The Privileges Desk staff is happy to answer any
questions regarding access to Green as well as
general information about the Stanford Uni

East Wing of the Library, the Privileges Desk is

also the place to direct questions concerning the
assignment of Library study space (including
Faculty Studies and Dissertation Rooms);
branch library hours and locations; the UCB/
Stanford Research Library Cooperative Pro
gram; and public transportation in the Bay
Area and the various commuter services which
serve the Stanford community.
Most humanities and social sciences mate
rials which constitute the main research collec
tion are located in the Green Library Stack,
comprised of the East (E), West (W) and South
(S) stacks. All of these materials are designated
'STACK or 'STIC in the card catalog and in
SULS.* Stack Directories are posted throughout
the Library indicating location of materials by
stack (E,W,S) or other symbol. Some older
materials are located in Auxiliary Storage and
must be requested at the Loan Desk. Loan Desk
staff members will be glad to help readers de
termine in which of the locations material they
are seeking is housed and arrange to have mate
rial paged if necessary.
In addition to charging materials for circula
tion (including checking out Green Library
books and the Green Libraiy Self-Guided Tour
Cassette Tapes), Loan Desk staff offer informa
tion regarding borrowing policies as well as
general Library information; handle Graduate
Reserves; take paging requests for items needed
from the Auxiliary Stack; recall* materials

fees . Questions regarding Lost and Found may
also be directed to Loan Desk staff members.

Materials borrowed through Interlibrary Loan
(ILL) or UCB's Baker Service* may be picked up
at the Loan Desk, located on the first floor of the
East Wing.
With more than 30 miles of book shelves to
maintain, the Stack Division staff is kept busy
reshelving hundreds of books daily as well as
organizing shelves so that books are in their
proper locations when needed. In addition, the
Stack staff administer lockers located through
out the East Stack; page books for the physically
limited; keep study space for library users clear
of extraneous materials; report building prob
lems; keep holders throughout the Library full
of blank charge cards and Stanford University
Library (SUL) Guides; and empty Library book
returns located outside of the Libraiy. Ques
tions may be directed to members of the Stack
staff in the Lower Level Stack Sort Room (Room
42A).
Upon leaving the East Wing, everyone is as
ked bv the Portal Staff to open all bags and
briefcases for inspection of Library materials.
This is to insure against uncharged materials
leaving the Library.
All Central Circulation Department staff look
forward to answering any questions you may
have regarding services offered by the Depart
ment or general informational questions about
the Library.
Central Map Collection
Topographic maps of Nigeria, a wall map of
the Roman Empire, an ethnolinguistic map of
the USSR, a street map of Beijing, maps showing
population distribution in Kenya, the natural
vegetation of California, or gazetteers of place
names — these are but a few of the many useful
items to be found in the central Map Collection,
located in Room 202 on the second floor ofWest
Wing.
A map specialist provides assistance in the
use of the map card catalog, gazetteers and

cartographic reference works, or locate and re
trieve needed materials from the map cases.
Maps may be loaned to all authorized Stanford
borrowers.
When necessary, the user will be referred to
other campus locations for maps and related
information; for example, the Branner Earth
Sciences Library contains a large collection of
geological maps, or the Phvsics Library houses
astronomical maps, such as the Palomar Sky
Atlas.
Hours for the Central Map Collection are
Monday through Friday, 1 p.m.—s p.m. or by

Central Map Collection
Topographic maps of Nigeria, a wall map of
the Roman Empire, an ethnolinguistic map of
the USSR, a street map of Beijing, maps showing
population distribution in Kenya, the natural
vegetation of California, or gazetteers of place
names — these are but a few of the many useful
items to be found in the central Map Collection,
located in Room 202 on the second floor ofWest
Wing.
A map specialist provides assistance in the
use of the map card catalog, gazetteers and
indexes. She will help a patron find appropriate
cartographic reference works, or locate and re
trieve needed materials from the map cases.
Maps may be loaned to all authorized Stanford
borrowers.
When necessary, the user will be referred to
other campus locations for maps and related
information; for example, the Branner Earth
Sciences Library contains a large collection of
geological maps, or the Phvsics Library houses
astronomical maps, such as the Palomar Sky
Atlas.
Hours for the Central Map Collection are
Monday through Friday, 1 p.m.—s p.m. or by
appointment. Tours are offered on the second
and third Thursdays of the Autumn and Spring
quarters from 3—3:30 p.m. Additional tours
may be arranged with the Map Specialist, Karyl
Tonge (7-1811).

Current Periodicals and
Microtexts Room
The Current Periodicals and Microtexts
Room, located on the lower level of Green
Library's East Wing, houses periodicals*, news
papers, and a diverse collection of microforms.
The periodicals collection consists of the
most recent issues of 4,000 selected academic
journals and popular magazines. Current issues
of other journals may be found with their
bound back files in the Stack or in other li
braries on campus. The Stanford Union List of
Serials (SULS)*, issued quarterly on microfiche,
provides location and holdings information for
serials* held in the University Libraries and in
several coordinate libraries.*
Current issues of fifty domestic and foreign
newspapers can be found in the newspaper
collection, as well as back issues in newsprint
and in microform of over 800 newspaper titles,
some dating back to the early nineteenth cen
tury. Although these newspapers are not listed
in the main card catalog or in SULS, card files
are maintained in the Current Periodicals and
Microtexts Room to provide titles, city of origin
and holdings records. Indexes for a number of
newspapers, including the New York Times,
mav be found in the Reference Room.
The microtexts collections reflect the variety
and diversity of research interests at Stanford. A
small sampling of the collections includes:
Presidential Papers, the Histoiy of Women col
lection, Early American Imprints, the anthro

pological documents contained in the Human
Relations Area File, AEC Technical Reports,
British Parliamentary Papers, census reports
dating back to 1790, and the collection of Three
Centuries of American and British Drama.
These large micropublishing projects were de
signed to make a great body of historical mate
rial easily accessible to scholars.
The individual titles included in most of
these omnibus collections are not listed sepa
rately in the card catalog. However, guides to
the individual collections are available in the
Microtexts Room. Readers interested in mate
rial that may be contained in the microform
collections should inquire at the Reference Desk
or the Current Periodicals and Microtexts Desk.
In addition to microform readers, machines
which produce paper copies from microfilm
and microfiche are available in the Microtexts
Reading Room. There are also portable micro
film readers available for ten day loan.
General Reference Service
"What famous painter was associated with
Flora Tristan?"
"Did Mac Beth ever leave Scotland and if so
where and when did he go?"
"What were the numbers of employed and un
employed workers, and the average wage rates,
during the period of the British General Strike?"
For quick answers to questions like these or
bibliographic assistance for advanced doctoral
or faculty research — or for a variety of infor
mation needs in between — the staff of the
General Reference Department provide expert
help to libraiy users. Located on the main floor
of the Green Libraiy East, the Department re
sponds to in-person requests, telephone calls,
and letters from inquirers on campus, else
where in California, throughout the United
States, and overseas.
To assist in providing these information ser
vices, the staff rely on 35,000 reference volumes,
which, in addition to works of a general nature,
contain specialized material in the humanities
and social sciences, especially in those disci
plines for which no branch or coordinate li
brary exists.
Among the variety of materials housed in the
General Reference Room are atlases, catalogs of
specialized collections in other major libraries,
dictionaries and directories of all kinds, en
cyclopedias, guides to important microfilm col
lections, indexes and abstracts of journal litera
ture, national and trade bibliographies, news
paper indexes, research guides, specialized sub
ject guides, and union lists of serials, Stanford's
as well as others. On-line searches in the social
sciences and humanities are also available for a
fee.
