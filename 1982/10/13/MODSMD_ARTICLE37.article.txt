Government Documents
Question: What do a list of plants 41 native" to
California, the text of the Panama Canal Treaty,
a picture of the moon's surface, gas mileage rat
ings for American and foreign cars, and a list of
loans and credits contracted by Pakistan, have
in common?
Answer: All are found in government docu
ments.
Documents provide primary sources for re
search, a better understanding of the events
behind today s headlines, and information es
sential to being an informed consumer, voter,
or citizen.
Located on the first floor of the Green
Library's West Wing, the Government Docu
ments Department houses about 250,000 gov
ernment publications, or roughly half of Stan
ford's total documents holdings. In the Depart
ment proper, users will find the depository col
lections for U.S. Federal, California State, and
United Nations publications; exceptional hold
ings of British Parliamentary papers; and se
lected documents from international agencies
and from U.S. state and local governments. The
reference collection is particularly strong in
statistical materials and should be regarded as
the place to begin whenever statistics are
needed.
Many documents are also acquired bv the
Department and listed in the card catalog, but
shelved in other locations. These include the
publications of foreign governments as well as
documents from local, national, or interna
tional agencies germane to the subject collec
tions of branch libraries.
Many documents are not listed in the main
catalog, but are only listed in the card catalog in
the Documents Department. Records are main
tained there for all government documents in
the University Libraries, including those in the
Green Library stack and the branch libraries,
but excluding those in the coordinate libraries/
Government document serials are listed in
SULS/
Documents reference staff are available dur
ing all hours the Department is open to provide
able assistance in finding documents informa
tion. Further information about Government
Documents is available directly from the staff of
the department or in the Library Guide How to
Find Government Documents.

Special Collections
Too often viewed only as treasures to be ap
preciated from afar rather than used, the rare
books and manuscripts housed in the Depart
ment of Special Collections are an important
resource for all members of the Stanford com
munity. Anyone with a scholarly need may con
sult Special Collections and visitors are always
welcome to view the exhibits in the Rotunda
and Gallery.
Special collections materials do not circulate,
but may be used in the Field Room, formerly the
General Reference Room on the 2nd floor of the
Green Library, West Wing.
Of interest not only to Stanford but also to
scholars at large are the Charlotte Ashley Felton
Collection of 19th and 20th century English and
American literature, the Morgan A. and Aline
D. Gunst Collection on the history of printing
and the book arts, the Memorial Library of
Music, the Frederick E. Brasch Collection on Sir
Isaac Newton and the Historv of Scientific

Thought, the Theater Collection (containing
books as well as theater ephemera) and the
Stanford Collection of German, Swiss, and
Austrian Culture. The general Rare Book Collec
tion contains antiquarian and valuable books in
all subject areas except those covered bv the
"special" collections just listed.
The Manuscript Division within the Depart
ment collects a variety of unique, original mate
rial, ranging from Greek papyrus to medieval
manuscripts and contemporary letters and
manuscripts of such writers as John Steinbeck,
W.B. Yeats and D.H. Lawrence. The Division's
holdings are also strong in material on the Civil
War period, the early 20th century Progressive
Movement in California, California Farm Labor
History, and Chicano History.
Each year the Department sponsors several
major exhibits in which a portion of its hold
ings* is displayed. Recent exhibits have focused
on Somerset Maugham, the New Almaden
mine, and authors studied in the Western Cul
ture Program.
