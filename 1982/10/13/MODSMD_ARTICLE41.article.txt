SCIENCE BRANCH
LIBRARIES
The bulk of the University Libraries' collec
tions in science and engineering are assembled
in the seven major branch libraries described
below. The librarv of the Hopkins Marine Sta
tion is located in Pacific Grove, two hours south
of the Stanford campus; the remainder are all
located on campus and range in size from
30,000 to 75,000 volumes. The combined collec
tions comprise nearly one third of a million
volumes, and include books, journals, technical
reports, theses, and other research materials. In
addition, the Frederick E. Brasch Collection on
Sir Isaac Newton and the History of Scientific
Thought and the Samuel I.and Cecile M.

Barchas collection in the history of science and
ideas, housed and maintained by the Depart
ment of Special Collections, contain 8,500 vol
umes for the study of the history of science.
In each of the science branch libraries, a
reference librarian is available to provide infor
mation and bibliographic assistance in the use
of the collections. Each branch has photocopy
facilities and terminals tor access to the RLIN*
data base. Since the summer of 1978, com
puterized literature searching has been avail
able to the Stanford scientific community. Data
files such as Chemical Abstracts, Physics Ab
stracts, Electrical and Electronic Abstracts, Bio
logical Abstracts, the Engineering Index, Sci
ence Citation Index, etc., are accessible through
this service. Both current awareness and retro
spective searching is possible. Interested per

sons should ask the librarian in any of the sci
ence branches or contact Harry Llull (7-4672) in
the Mathematical and Computer Science Li
brary for more information.
Branch librarians also serve as biblio
graphers for their respective fields. To avoid
unnecessary duplication and also to insure that
all relevant subdisciplines and interdisciplinary
areas are represented, the Curator tor Sciences
coordinates activities dealing with science col
lections. Faculty and graduate students are en
couraged to recommend additions and dele
tions to the respective subject bibliographer.
There is a collection development policy state
ment on file in each branch library.
The Science department office is located in
the Engineering Library, telephone number
7-3769.

Branner Earth Sciences
Libraiy
The Branner Libraiy supports the under
graduate, graduate and special programs of the
School of Earth Sciences. Its collections include
current and retrospective materials in all fields
of applied earth sciences, geology, geophysics,
and petroleum engineering. State and foreign
geological, hydrological, natural hazards, and
natural resources maps and the topographic
quadrangles of the U.S. Geological Survey form
a large part of the 80,000 sheet map collection.
Reports of the School of Earth Sciences are also
kept on file.
The libraiy is spaciously housed on the sec
ond floor and mezzanine of the Mitchell Earth
Sciences Building, with a light table, a variety of
comfortable reading spaces and group study
rooms. The librarian, Charlotte Derksen, may
be contacted for information, reference* assist
ance, or computerized literature searching at
7-2746.
Engineering Libraiy
The Engineering Library occupies part of the
second through fourth floors of the Terman
Engineering Center. The 75,000 volume collec
tion includes material for research in eight of
the nine departments of the School of Engineer
ing, including aeronautics and astronautics,
electrical engineering, mechanical engineering,
engineering-economic systems, materials sci
ence and engineering, civil engineering, indus
trial engineering, and operations research. In
addition to reference material, monographs,
and serials,* the libraiy houses a large number
of technical reports both in hard copy and
microfiche.
Course reserves*, including a large number of
videotapes, are available at the loan desk. Ser-

vices include assistance in locating and obtain
ing technical reports and computer searches of
automated data bases, as well as traditional
reference* service. Persons interested in com
puter searches may contact Charles Early at
7-9164. A guide to the Engineering Library is
available in the library or bv calling Michael
Sullivan's office at 7-1513.
Falconer Biology Library
Located on the third floor of the Biological
Science Center, the Falconer Biology Library
contains over 70,000 volumes, including 2,000
serial* titles. Within the collection, there is
strong emphasis in the areas of cell and de
velopmental biology, genetics and molecular
biology, and population biology. The Jasper
Ridge Papers and the Senior Honors Papers are
two small special collections maintained in the
library. For information concerning library ser-

vices or reference* assistance, library users
should contact the librarian, Beth Weil at
7-1528.

Hopkins Marine
Station Libraiy
The library of the Hopkins Marine Station is
housed in the landmark Monterey Boatworks
building, beside Monterey Bay, on the Station's
Pacific Grove campus 90 miles from Stanford.
The collection, 21,000 volumes strong with 500
current serial* titles includes the University Li
braries major holdings in marine biology and
oceanography.
Holdings are listed in the RLIN* data base
and in SULS,* as well as in the main catalog in
the Green Libraiy. Users interested in obtaining
these materials should contact staff in the Fal
coner Biology Libraiy, the Branner Earth Sci
ences Library or Interlibraiy Services in the
Green Library, or call the librarian, Alan Bald
ridge, at (408) 373-0464.
Mathematical and
Computer Sciences
Libraiy
The Mathematical and Computer Sciences
Libraiy is located on the fourth floor of the
Sloan Mathematics Center, Building 380. In ad
dition to a collection of over 42,000 mono
graphs and 900 seriaP titles, the libraiy con
tains a large number of technical reports and
other uncataloged material obtained through
exchange agreements with other universities
and research institutions. A computerized key
word index to these uncataloged materials is
located in the library and may be used to access
material from the report collection. Graduate
