# Technical Reports
## 
### 
Not all of the technical reports
owned by Stanford are listed in the
main card catalog. Some are, but refer
ences may also be found in SULS,* the
Government Documents Department,
and appropriate branch and coordinate
libraries.* Each library maintains a re
cord of the cataloged and uncataloged
technical reports it receives.
Much important information tends
to be buried in the large number of
technical reports which are included in
the collections of many of the science
branch libraries on campus. A techni
cal report may be a scientific paper,
article, or translation, often issued as
part of a series. Because of their large
numbers, they are often not cataloged
or are cataloged by series title only.
However, the Mathematical and Com
puter Sciences and the Engineering li
braries do have fairly complete hold
ings of all Stanford reports produced by
their respective groups (i.e. Math and
Computer Science departments and the
School of Engineering).
Among the branch libraries on
campus which collect technical reports
in specific subjects are the Engineering
Department, the Government Docu
ments Department, Branner Earth Sci
ences Library, the Heffner Memorial
Library, the Jackson Library of Busi
ness, the Mathematical and Computer
Sciences Library, the Physics Library,
and the Stanford Linear Accelerator
Center Library. Each of these libraries
collects technical reports which relate
directly to the subject specialty of that
library. Also, the Current Periodicals
and Microtexts Room in the Green
Library has a large collection of energy
reports on microfiche. Users of techni
cal reports may wish to consult the
Directory of Technical Reports at Stan
ford. which lists the major technical re
port series and collections currently re
ceived at Stanford. Copies are available
at the Reference Desk in the Green
Library and in appropriate branch and
coordinate libraries.
