# Survey of blacks criticized but results deemed accurate

University officials and students both criticized the methods used
in a nationwide survey of black students at 114 universities which
was used to compile the recently released A Black Student's Guide to
Colleges. However, statements by both administrators and students
regarding the interaction between black and white students at Stan
ford were consistent with the guide's description of the University.
The comments about Stanford in the guide were mixed. The in
teraction between blacks and whites was described in lukewarm
terms, the selection of courses dealing with the African-American or
African experience was praised and the advising or counseling avail
able for black students was given negative reviews.
The guide, edited and compiled by Barry Beckham, head of the
graduate writing program at Brown University, rates the academic
and social climate some blacks say they find at campuses across the
country. The subjective student comments on which it based its rat
ings were gathered by means of questionnaires distributed to five
black students at each school.
James Lyons, dean of student affairs, said this technique of
gathering information seemed "woefully inadequate, giving secon
dary impressions at best." According to Thomas Massey, associate
dean of student affairs, "Five would not be a representative sam
ple."
One black student here, senior economics and political science
major Jacquelyn Johnson expanded on Massey's statement, saying
that "Five black students at Stanford can not give you an accurate
picture of what it's like to be a black student at Stanford Univer
sity," because "everyone has a different experience."

Another black student here, junior Leon Hilton, said, "They
should have simply asked more people," while at the same time tak
ing into account the ratio of men to women and the various back
grounds of the people questioned.
Specifically, the guide quotes one student as saying that inter
racial relations at the University are "cordial, but very distant," and
another as saying that "interaction between the races is non
hostile."
According to Lyons, these statements "may not be inaccurate
but they are incomplete."
Massey said, "I wouldn't describe anyone's interaction as either
'cordial' or 'non-hostile.' That's unreal." He continued, "I think
that black students are a little more diverse than that. As are non
blacks."
Massey explained that, following the stereotypes of history, black
students are commonly perceived as a homogeneous group, rather
than as individuals. "We ought to get a little more future-oriented
than that," he added.
Johnson, on the other hand, agreed with the description of inter
racial relations at Stanford quoted in the guide. "Cordial is a good
word. I think that's a fair description of what is going on," she said.
University officials and students diverged on their analysis of the
interaction between blacks and whites here. The administrators per
ceived distinct problems, while the students said that race was not
that important a factor in relationships.
According to Lyons, "The average student coming to Stanford
probably has not had much experience in dealing with people who
are ethically and racially different from them."
The reason for this, he said, is that "By and large, we have not

developed a full language of respectful interaction" in our society.
He added that, in contrast, we are able to have very good discussions
on such topics as feminism, for which there has evolved an adequate
vocabulary.
However, Lyons also said that the University's system of housing,
which he described as placing a great cultural diversity of students
together, can iron out the differences between them. This, he said, is
"the process of being liberated from prejudice."
According lo Massey. "there is not enough interraction between
black and white students on this campus." He added that "students
ought to be willing to take risks in that way," because "the kind of
relationships that blacks can have with non-blacks is worth taking
risks for."
Massey also said, "I don't think we have enough opportunities to
take risks in the Stanford environment." However, he described this
problem as less serious at the University than in the general society,
where there is no common denominator such as the high level of ac
ademic achievement found here.
Of the students, both Johnson and Hilton said that, in their ex
perience, race was not the determining factor in relationships.
"Race is not the only criteria. It's not the only thing which makes or
breaks friendships," according to Johnson. "It's just whatever type
of environment I choose to put myself in that dictates what kind of
friends I'm going to have," she added.
Hilton said, "I find that my relationships with the persons here,
whether they be black, Chinese or white, is not dependent on race."
