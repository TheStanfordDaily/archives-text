# ASSU given authorization to join Concert Network
## 
### STEVE TROUSDALE Staff writer 
In a stormy meeting marred by
bickering between various senators on
points of parlimentary procedure, the
ASSU Senate passed a bill giving the
ASSU the authorization to join the
Concert Network, which already con
sists of the Stanford Band, the Chapar
ral and the Student Alumni Network
(STAN).
The senate also heard a report by Stu
dent Financial Manager Bob Brody in
which he stated that the 1982-83 budget
as approved in the spring would result
in a $27,000 deficit. He then referred to
the Concert Network, which the senate
had not yet voted on, as a "much
needed source of revenue."
"We need money," he said, to which
Senate Chair Raga Elim interjected
"desperately!"
The Concert Network proposal.

however, occupied the major portion of
the three-and-a-half-hour meeting.
During the somewhat acrimonious de
bate the senators differed on two issues.
Some said that the Concert Network
would become a monopoly and would
hurt other campus groups trying to put
on concerts, while others felt that such a
monopoly, if it came about, would be in
the best interests of concert promotion
on campus.
Senators also differed on the criteria
groups should meet in order to join the
network. Some felt that a $750 deposit
was the best way of giving all groups the
chance to join, while others felt that
more restrictions were needed.
"Having only the 750 dollar fee will
greatly hinder the performance of the
network," Senator Kelvin Davis com
mented. Other senators commented
that overly restrictive criteria for join
ing the network would lead to the

ASSU, which represents student
groups, competing with those student
groups that wish to promote concerts.
The senate eventually passed the bill
with an amendment specifying four
qualifications under which other, of
ficially recognized student groups can
join the network. The four criteria in
clude interest in concerts on campus, fi
nancial responsibility, experience in
providing campus entertainment and
the $750 deposit.
After the meeting Vinnie Freda, busi
ness manager of the Chaparral and its
representative on the Concert Network,
said he personally approved of the bill
and its amendment and thought that
the network would approve of it and
admit the ASSU to membership. Freda
also commented on criticism by several
senators that the network may become
a monopoly.

"I think we'll have a monopoly in
that we will put on more shows than
anyone else," he said, but insisted that
the network would not be the only
group putting on shows in the future.
In the discussion surrounding
Brodv's announcement of the expected
deficit. Senator Roland Van Gaalen
asked if there were "any justification
for not getting rid of recycling," to
which Brody replied by saying that the
recycling program provides a social
benefit.
However, in the senate finance com
mittee meeting Oct. 5, Brody did rec
ommend drawing up a new operating
budget for 1982-83, cutting the ASSU
portion of that budget from $ 100,500 to
$80,000 to make up for expected losses,
and from a purely financial standpoint,
cutting any program returning less than
10 percent to 12 percent.
