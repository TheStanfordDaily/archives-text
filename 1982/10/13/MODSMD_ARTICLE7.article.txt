# Inevitable end of Context system disappoints users
## 
### KRISTEN CHRISTOPHER Senior staff writer 
The impending termination of the text-editing
Context computer system, scheduled to be closed
down by Dec. I, has its users disappointed and busy
looking for a replacement. However, University and
Center for Information Technology (CIT) officials
say there was no alternative to shutting down Con
text, short of having the University pay several hun
dred thousand dollars.
Edward Shaw, director of CIT, said he carefully
reviewed the finances of Context and concluded it
had "proved not to be a viable service in the market
place." In his role as associate provost for informa
tion systems, Shaw recommended to Provost Albert
Hastorf, William Massy, vice president for business
and finance, and Lawrence Crowley, vice president
for medical affairs, that the system's services be dis
continued.
Shaw said he did not feel he could ask the Univer
sity to allocate the amount of money that would
have been necessary to keep the system in operation.

Context, according to Shaw, "was an attempt to
meet a specific need ... the needs of authors," but
there was not enough demand for its services.
Several of the approximately 350 people who use
the system are upset that it will no longer be avail
able to them.
"I think it's terrible, with our workload, it will
hurt us quite a bit," said Carolyn Edwards, a secre
tary in the Department of Aeronautics and
Astronautics. That department owns one terminal
for Context, rents several others and purchased a
laser printer to complement the system. The finan
cial effect on the department "really depends on
what sort of alternatives we pick," said Gerda de
Werk, the secretary in that department who handles
computer technology.
Joan Galle, business manager of the Stanford Law
Review, said there will have to be "a substantial
amount of extra work put in so there won't be a de
lay (in publication)." There are currently three is
sues of the Review on Context and they will most

likely be transferred to a transitional system until a
permanent replacement has been acquired, she said.
CIT will handle the transfer, she added, and is ensur
ing that none of the material on the system will be
lost.
Context user Thomas Anders, professor of psy
chiatry here, said he was "really very disappointed"
when he heard about the closing of the system. "I
think it served as a tremendous service ... it pro
moted scholarship among faculty." He added that
he feels a main cause for the shutdown is that "most
faculty members can't afford it."
Anders, however, has already found a re
placement for that system. "I saw (the shutdown)
coming and I went to the micro route," he said.
Though Anders uses his microcomputer for
word-processing and some other services, he said it
is "not nearly as effective and powerful as what Con
text offered."
For users who have yet to choose a
replacement system, CIT is holding
four meetings during this month to aid
them in their decision. "A good deal of
thought has gone into providing a good
bridge," said Jon Sandelin, director of
the center's text network program.
Context services may be available on
some of the other computer systems for
a limited period of time, according to
Sandelin. Ralph Gorin, the Univer
sity's director of computer science, said
he has "made a commitment to the
Context users" to provide them with
services as resources permit.
The services, obtainable through a
computer system called
DECSYSTEM-20, will be available at
the usual rates. However, both Gorin
and Sandelin said they do not know
how those fees compare with Context
rates.
It is doubtful that the University ad
ministration will decide to acquire "a
clone of Context," Sandelin said.
