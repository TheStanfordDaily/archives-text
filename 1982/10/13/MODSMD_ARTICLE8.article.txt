## War correspondents speak at Central American film showing 
### KAREN ADAMS 
" People would have waited in line to vote even
if Attila the Hun and Donald Duck were the
only candidates," asserted war correspondent
Richard Boyle of El Salvador's spring election.
Boyle spoke at the showing last Thursday
night of two films on Central America, spon
sored by the Stanford Central American Action
Network (SCAAN).
"Ballots, Bullets, and Voices," composed of
footage shot for a future PBS documentary by
Boyle and his partner Don Gomez of Channel 11
(San Jose), was filmed primarily during the
Salvadoran elections this spring.

Boyle commented on the
dangers of covering a war.
While shooting' Ballot s, Bullets
and Voices,' Boyle and Gomez
were ambushed outside junta
headquarters for disobeying
orders not to film the elections.
Just days after four Dutch
journalists were murdered,
Boyle was pistol-whipped by
Salvadoran soldiers and his
house was burned down.

"Americas in Transition," narrated by Ed
Asner, was a controversial overview of the Cen
tral American situation. Suggested by some as
the reason the 1982-83 season of "Lou Grant"
was cancelled, the film questioned the motiva
tion for U.S. aid and intervention in Latin Amer
ica.
The Asner film, while briefly covering the situ
ations in Chile, Cuba, the Dominican Republic,
Guatemala and Nicaragua, focused on El

Salvador, where a bloody civil war continues to
claim as many as 1000 civilian lives monthly.
The United States has supported the Salvadoran
military with arms, military training and ap
proximately 50 advisers.
In their film, Gomez and Boyle highlighted
extreme aspects of the situation in El Salvador,
including a Green Beret estimate that the regime
needs 5000 troops, arms and ammunition, cobra
gunships, electronic equipment, and trained of
ficer corps in order for the United States not to
become involved in El Salvador.
Following the film showings, Boyle com
mented on the dangers of covering a war. While
shooting "Ballots, Bullets and Voices," Boyle
and Gomez were ambushed outside junta head
quarters for disobeying orders not to film the
elections. Just days after four Dutch journalists
were murdered, Boyle was pistol-whipped by
Salvadoran soldiers and his house was burned
down.
In answer to questions from the overflow au
dience, Boyle compared the civil war in El
Salvador to the war in Vietnam, which he also
covered. He said he saw the same tactics in
search and destroy missions as in Indochina,
specifically distributing leaflets, followed by air
bombardment and invasion by land.
Furthermore, he said, "Both sides are quite so
phisticated in terms of their use of media."
Predicting the outcome of the Salvadoran civil
war, Boyle said, "I personally think the Green
Berets will be unsuccessful. Repression works
for a little while, but you cannot keep down the
free spirit of the people."
According to JoAnne Scott, SCAAN mem
ber, the organization sponsored the film show
ing in an effort to educate the Stanford com
munity that "the 200 million dollars sent or
pledged to prop up the Salvadoran military jun
ta not only serve to support a notorious violator
of human rights but also represent a drain to our
needed financial resources."
