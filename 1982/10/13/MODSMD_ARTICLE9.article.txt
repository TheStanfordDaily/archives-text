# Motorcycles help police enforce 'moped law'
## 
### MARK McKEEN 
Upon their return to college
life this fall, Stanford students
have had their heads turned more
than once by the presence of two
new motorcycle policemen that
patrol the campus.
The two policemen, adorned in
standard green police uniforms
and special boots and helmets,
have the purpose of enforcing the
moped and motorbike laws that
pertain within the interquad or
"vehicle exclusion area."
Yet according to Stanford Po
lice Chief Marvin Herrington,
this new "experimental" pro
gram has the primary concern of
"not trying to eliminate use" of
mopeds but rather to control the
behavior of moped and other
two-wheel motorbike users.
The problem of moped safety
on campus was not an issue five
years ago when the use of motor
bikes was insignificant. How
ever, in the last three years a mul
titude of Stanford students and
faculty have begun using such ve
hicles, a fact which has led to a se
rious safety dilemma on campus.
Most people who frequently
traveled in the interquad area dis
covered that, as Herrington
states, they were "taking their
lives into their own hands"
around class break and lunch
time with potential dangers of
collision surrounding them.
In past few years, many educa
tional safety measures were tried
— such as "tagging" bikes last
fall — yet these methods
achieved only moderate success.
The Bicycle Safety Committee
soon realized that without an en
forcement component, the safety
awareness program did not have
enough influence to alter behav
ior.

For this reason, both moped
users and non-users appear to be
accepting the presence of two 250
cc Hondas mounted with po
liceman patrolling the campus.
With the threat of fines, traffic
citations and bail schedules stir
ring in their minds, many current
moped users have had to make
adjustments in their riding be
havior around campus.
Dan Fowkes, a senior who had
owned a moped since first arriv
ing on campus three years ago,
feels that the current enforce
ment policy is a positive factor
"rn helping make the interquad
area safe to travel through."
Fowkes does not complain about
walking to class these days be
cause of the increased enforce
ment.
Another moped-user,
freshman Geordie McKee, ex
presses the same belief that safety

is more important than his own
personal convenience, but also
admits that he is currently look
ing io purchase a regular bicycle
to cure his present transportation
problems.
Although Herrington points
out that the two motorcycle po
licemen are "not typical street
type of enforcement," he feels
that their presence has increased
safety awareness on campus and
have brought forth a helpful
group pressure on violating
moped drivers.
Herrington added that the
feedback from students, faculty
and even the motorcycle pa
trolmen themselves has been very
positive.
However, the two new motor
cycles also have other uses on
campus besides curtailing moped

activity within the vehicle ex
clusion area. During last year's
series of attacks here, the police
first borrowed and put to use sev
eral light motorcycles to patrol
off-road and other secluded areas
not accessible to regulation pa
trol cars.
This sort of patrol, much like
the San Francisco Police Depart
ment's patrol of the difficult
Golden Gate Park area, gave the
opportunity for small motor
cycles to be of great use to an en
forcement and protection pro
gram at the Stanford campus.
Herrington stressed the "flex
ibility" of these bikes for many
different situations and said that,
in addition to their moped traffic
function, they allow the police to
respond much quicker to calls
across campus than would nor
mal patrol cars.

Upon their return to college
life this fall, Stanford students
have had their heads turned more
than once by the presence of two
new motorcycle policemen that
patrol the campus.
The two policemen, adorned in
standard green police uniforms
and special boots and helmets,
have the purpose of enforcing the
moped and motorbike laws that
pertain within the interquad or
"vehicle exclusion area."
Yet according to Stanford Po
lice Chief Marvin Herrington,
this new "experimental" pro
gram has the primary concern of
"not trying to eliminate use" of
mopeds but rather to control the
behavior of moped and other
two-wheel motorbike users.
The problem of moped safety
on campus was not an issue five
years ago when the use of motor
bikes was insignificant. How
ever, in the last three years a mul
titude of Stanford students and
faculty have begun using such ve
hicles, a fact which has led to a se
rious safety dilemma on campus.
Most people who frequently
traveled in the interquad area dis
covered that, as Herrington
states, they were "taking their
lives into their own hands"
around class break and lunch
time with potential dangers of
collision surrounding them.
In past few years, many educa
tional safety measures were tried
— such as "tagging" bikes last
fall — yet these methods
achieved only moderate success.
The Bicycle Safety Committee
soon realized that without an en
forcement component, the safety
awareness program did not have
enough influence to alter behav
ior.

For this reason, both moped
users and non-users appear to be
accepting the presence of two 250
cc Hondas mounted with po
liceman patrolling the campus.
With the threat of fines, traffic
citations and bail schedules stir
ring in their minds, many current
moped users have had to make
adjustments in their riding be
havior around campus.
Dan Fowkes, a senior who had
owned a moped since first arriv
ing on campus three years ago,
feels that the current enforce
ment policy is a positive factor
"rn helping make the interquad
area safe to travel through."
Fowkes does not complain about
walking to class these days be
cause of the increased enforce
ment.
Another moped-user,
freshman Geordie McKee, ex
presses the same belief that safety

is more important than his own
personal convenience, but also
admits that he is currently look
ing io purchase a regular bicycle
to cure his present transportation
problems.
Although Herrington points
out that the two motorcycle po
licemen are "not typical street
type of enforcement," he feels
that their presence has increased
safety awareness on campus and
have brought forth a helpful
group pressure on violating
moped drivers.
Herrington added that the
feedback from students, faculty
and even the motorcycle pa
trolmen themselves has been very
positive.
However, the two new motor
cycles also have other uses on
campus besides curtailing moped

activity within the vehicle ex
clusion area. During last year's
series of attacks here, the police
first borrowed and put to use sev
eral light motorcycles to patrol
off-road and other secluded areas
not accessible to regulation pa
trol cars.
This sort of patrol, much like
the San Francisco Police Depart
ment's patrol of the difficult
Golden Gate Park area, gave the
opportunity for small motor
cycles to be of great use to an en
forcement and protection pro
gram at the Stanford campus.
Herrington stressed the "flex
ibility" of these bikes for many
different situations and said that,
in addition to their moped traffic
function, they allow the police to
respond much quicker to calls
across campus than would nor
mal patrol cars.
