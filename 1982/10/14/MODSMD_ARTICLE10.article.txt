## Gagging your way through the big four years: 'How to College' 
### JANE McCONNELL 
If you've ever run into the "God Squadder"
at a party, you II know he's extremely clean-cut,
usually wears a piece of "lad" clothing to show
he can relate, and has read "How to Pick Up
Girls for Christ" five times.
What you II want to know is how to avoid
him. According to How to College — A Humor
ous Guide to the Four Years, you can: "a) Offer
him a drink; b) Excuse yourself to go get high;
or c) Tell him that you're already saved and
jump out onto the dance floor."
How to College is Stanford grads Bill Jeakle,
Eugene Reardon and Ed Wyatt's answer to The
Preppy Handbook.
Though written in a semi-satirical vein, the
guide does present an accurate, if exaggerated,
picture of the college scene. It covers every pos
sible aspect of college life, from"The Selection
Process ("Thick envelope? Good sign. Start
blowing off the rest of senior year. Thin en
velope? Let's face it. This college is on the de
cline and has a very unrealistic guy/girl ratio,
anyway.") to "The Last Act" ("The end of col
lege means the end of the best friendships
you've ever had, the end of a diligent pursuit of
knowledge for knowledge's sake, and the end of
free beer on Friday night.") The years in-be
tween fall under such headings as "Settling In,"
which covers the scammer's meal plan and three
minutes a day to a stronger college vocabulary;
"Get Smart," which deals with the art of blow
ing ii off; "Without Class," a glimpse into
fraternity and sorority life; "Social Sciences,"
including drinking games and pick-up
strategies; and "Lust to Love," where you learn
to spot the virgin and discover outrageous
places to have sex.
No facet of the college years is left out, and no
group is spared ridicule. Sex-starved frat men,
dingy sorority sisters, spirited alums, meathead
athletes, nerds, preps and gays are all made fun
of, but in such a lighthearted way that no one
need take offense.
"We tried to laugh with the students, not at
them," Wyatt explained.
Jeakle added: "We're poking fun at the
things all students do, and in doing that, we're
poking fun at ourselves, too."
Originally begun as a series of humorous es
says, How to College was the natural result of
two guvs who love to write almost as much as
they love to get a laugh, and a third guy who
wanted to start his own company. Jeakle and
Wyatt, both English majors, describe them
selves as "your typical gagsters." They worked
on most of the writing end of the project, white
Reardon, an Econ major, handled the business
side. Phil Chalk did the illustrations.
"The whole thing started out our junior year,
when Eugene said to me 'let's do something
great this summer' — something which would
combine both our talents," said Jeakle. We saw
the Preppy Handbook selling and thought
"What are we experts in, besides celibacy?"
"Since there isn't much of a market for
celibacy, we decided to do a book on what we
know best — how to college," he said.
2 Jeukle's obvious choice for a co-writer was
Wyatt, a fellow gagster from his freshman
dorm. "We used to publish a paper for our

freshman dorm called The Weekly Obsceni
ty,' " said Wyatt. "Although Bill is more of a
creative writer and I'm more of an idea man, we
shared the common bond of comedy."
Although Jeakle and Wyatt did a large part
of the writing, Jeakle stressed the fact that it was
a team effort. "We started out brainstorming a
million different ideas and then divided them up
according to our areas of expertise. For exam
ple, Ed took sports, Eugene took business and I
took sex," explained Jeakle. The three did most
of the writing on their own, and then got togeth
er to rewrite and edit.
The production reached a fever pitch last
year, when all three virtually moved into Room
321 Rinconada, where Jeakle was a resident as
sistant. "We ate, slept and typeset there," said
Jeakle. "It wasn't vour typical senior year.
While our friends were out blowing off work,
we were spending abut 10 hours a week on this.
Over Thanksgiving, Christmas and spring
break we stayed in the dorms to write the
book."
This kind of time commitment wasn't
without an effect on their schoolwork. Wyait
found himself struggling in his French class, but
when he explained to the professor what was de
manding so much of his time, the teacher was

very intrigued and he passed the class. Jeakle
wasn't so lucky. "I took Econ 51 pass/fail —
and failed. I think I'm the only person in history
ever to fail that class."
Though all three contributors are Stanford
grads, Wyatt stressed that the book applies to
any college. "One thing we discovered was how
amazingly similar all schools are," he pointed
out. At first they thought about doing a Stan
ford guide, but soon realized they'd hit a much
wider audience with a general guide to college.
However, most of the photos are of Stanford
students, and many will recognize familiar peo
ple and places pictured in the book.
Besides the college market. Jeakle and Wyatt
hope to find a prospective audience in the high
schools. Said Wyatt, "Although the book is
funnier after you've been through it all, it's
basically written for the high school student, as
a preview to college. There's a potentially huge
market out there."
The production side of the project was done
through the formation of the group's own pub
lishing company, the Primer Press. Jeakle ex-.
plained, "Wo raisoil private
loans from our friends an3'family. If it doesn't
sell. . . well: we'll move to Guam."
The bookstore purchased 500 copies of the

book, and many local bookstores have bought
copies on consignment. The authors are now
working on promoting the book in college
bookstores both on the West and East Coasts.
"If it sells well here, it can't help but catch on,"
said Wyatt.
"We're trving not to push it too hard — we
don't want to be obnoxious," added Jeakle.
Besides advertising in college newspapers, the
group had a promotional party and tentatively
plans to drive around this weekend's football
game in a jeep with a megaphone, or rent an air
plane carrying a message.
"We're playing up the fact that we're a couple
of gagsters just out of college, writing about col
lege," said Jeakle. "That gives us somewhat of a
different twist."
However, this can also create problems.
"Some people don't take us seriously, because
of the fact that we're young," said Wyatt.
But the authors are optimistic. "Even if the
book doesn't sell, it's been a great business ex
perience," said Jeakle. "If it goes well it will
open other doors for us." Though neither writer
plans another similar undertaking for the near
future, they see the possibility of a few summer
projects, such as humorous Chamber of Com
merce city guides.
Whether or not the book sells, both Jeakle
and Wyatt agree that the satisfaction they've
gotten out of the whole thing comes from seeing
people laugh at their jokes. Said Jeakle, "We've
always made gags — always been obnoxious.
This has given us an opportunity to see that oth
er people really do think we're funny." Wyatt
added, "It's, above all, a humorous book. It's
iioV tTKc ATVivrdltThc Doomsday Primer' or
'How to Suicide.' The best part for me is know
ing that peole are having a good time because of
something we wrote."
