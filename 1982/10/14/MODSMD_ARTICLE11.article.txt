## The 						Stanford Daily Cruel irony of one man's death 
### 
There is particularly painful irony in the recent
death of an American Marine stationed in Beirut:
the first and so far only American soldier killed in
the Lebanese morass was slain by a cluster bomb —
one provided by the United States to Israel under
strict agreements for its defensive use on non-civil
ian targets.
The death of an American, although tragic in
itself and perhaps of more immediate consequence
to the American press and public, is but one more in
a horror of thousands of deaths: Palestinians, Is
raelis, Syrians and Lebanese — too many to count
and too many to comprehend fully.
The irony, however, remains. The deadliest of
American technology provided through American
arms-sale policies to the closest of American allies
— which receives the greatest amount of American
aid — killed an American in the Mideast. Mere
poetic justice, the cynic may say, but shards of
metal whirring through human flesh are hardly
just.
More fell in those moments, in those weeks, than
a disfigured corpse. The final meeting of American
life with the results of American policies was only
the climax of fatal policies and flagrant decisions
that again challenge the mechanisms — those bits
of knowledge and bits of metal tied to bits of paper
— of U.S. foreign policy.
More is at issue than the righteousness of Israel's
or the Palestinians' cause: the principles that place
American weapons beyond American control in

governments exercising policies with neither U.S.
endorsement nor in accord with U.S. interests. Or,
more broadly, the tragedy in Lebanon underscores
the terrible consequences of predicating American
relations with other nations upon arms sales and
credits — whether as bribery, coercion or tokens of
affection.
All too often, in the Philippines, El Salvador and
in other nations receiving U.S. military aid, govern
ments use American arms against civilians. And
equally terrifying is the prospect of American
weapons shot, launched or flown against other
American weapons in wars between U.S. allies —
destroying both civilian lives and American policy
objectives in the course of their trajectories.
The current arms-sales policies — divorced from
considerations of human rights, of enforcing the
nominal restrictions placed on the arms' use or of
the absolute strategic importance of America's
clients — have even more casualties than policies
and civilian lives. The United States cannot trade
nominal additions to a ledger of allies through un
restricted arms sales for its claims to valuing life
and individuals bolstered by its domestic policies
and structure — a trade that occurs with every mis
directed arms sale.
As illustrated most forcefully by a single Ameri
can Marine, it is American interests, policies and
people, too, who are ill-served by current arms sales
policies.
