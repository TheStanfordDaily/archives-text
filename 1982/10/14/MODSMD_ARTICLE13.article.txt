## Democrats must formulate coherent (neoliberal) economic agenda 
### 
The 10.1 percent unemployment fig
ures released last week make certain
what previously was only conjecture: a
sweeping victory for House Democrats
in November.
Democrats, though, must be careful
not to exaggerate the significance of
their victory, for only Stanford football
is more unpredictable than electoral
politics. To ensure a long stay in the po
litical driver's seat, the Democrats must
accurately interpret the message being
sent to politicians by the American pub
lic and respond to that signal promptly.
To begin with, a cursory reading of
history should temper the Democrats'
victory celebrations. IT the past is any
aid in predicting the future. President
Reagan's party should be expected to
lose seats in Congress. Only once since
1862 has the presidential incumbent's
party won seats in a midterm election,
and that in the anomalous 1934
election. Several theories attempt to ex
plain this phenomona, but it is becom
ing increasingly clear that the political
"ins" are blamed for the condition of
the economy and suffer the wrath of a
dissatisfied citizenry. In this case, the
"ins" are Reagan and the Republicans.
In 1980, the Democrats were the "ins,"
the economy was in bad shape, and they
lost. Clearly, ideology has little to do
with this type of voting behavior.
The key to political survival these
days is national economic health. And
while the GOP will suffer setbacks in
1982, it still has a plan, and one that
might work with alterations. In con
trast, the Democratic Party has no plan.
Democratic campaign strategy has
been to make this election a referendum
on Reaganomics. There has been little
mention of Democratic ideas to revive
the economy.

A recent state-wide Los Angeles
Times poll ought to warn Democrats
that while this might be an effective
campaign strategy it is certain to
backfire in the long run. Twenty-four
percent of the Democrats and 76 per
cent of the Republicans said they were
supporters of Reagan's economic ideas;
63 percent of the Democrats and 18 per
cent of the Republicans stated that they
were critics. These results aren't surpris
ing. But when further queried about
their reasons for support or criticism,
41 percent of the Democrats stated that
their criticism hinged on the fact that
Reagan's "ideas aren't working," while
only 22 percent said the ideas were
"wrong."
Obviously, partisan policy orien
tations are not how citizens are judging
Reagan's programs. The most impor
tant question in Americans' minds is:
will the policy work? The signs are mix
ed as to the current direction of the
economy with unemployment and busi
ness failures signaling future difficulties
and inflation, interest rates, and the
stock market pointing to recovery. If
the economy does pick up, the Demo
cratic revival will be stopped before it
started. But even if the economy takes a
turn for the worse, Reagan and the Re
publicans should not be counted out.
First, the Democratic Party has no
alternative economic proposals. Rea
gan's game is the only game in town. In
lieu of new ideas, the Democrats have
reverted back to their old ways. Last
month's $1 billion House jobsbill was
vintage New Deal, but it lacked connec
tion to the fundamental problems fac
ing America today.
Reflecting the public perception that
the Democrats have no viable economic
proposals is a Sept. 1982 Harris Poll
which indicates that the American peo

pie still think a Republican-controlled
Congress would do a better job of bal
ancing the federal budget (47 percent to
34), cutting federal spending (52 per
cent to 37), and keeping inflation under
control (46 percent to 40). While Demo
crats come out ahead on questions
about unemployment, care for the
elderly, and interest rates, it is surpris
ing that anyone supports the Re
publicans considering the fact that they
are the "ins" and 58 percent of all
Americans believe this country is in an
economic depression. Clearly, the
Democrats need to spell out a well-de
fined, long-term, coherent strategy for
getting the American economy back on
its feet.
Second, Reagan shouldn't be
counted out, regardless of the economy,

because he is a smart, pragmatic politi
cian. His recent tax hike/tax com
pliance bill certainly didn't fit into the
supply-side framework, but he saw the
harsh consequences of burgeoning defi
cits and moved to reduce them. On one
popular conservative social issue legis
lation, the president has been surpris
ingly quiet, much to the dismay of the
GOP rightwing. Reagan the politician
shows up again here. While he no doubt
supports school prayer and anti-abor

tion measures, strongly supporting
them costs too much politically. Rea
gan is a politician as well as an ideol
ogue.
Reagan's movements toward the po
litical center should worry Democrats.
The party that captures the middle of
the political spectrum will control poli
tics in the United States. To be suc
cessful, the Democrats must stake out a
position closer to the center than the
Republicans. Because of their present
lack of cohesion and definitive policy
positions, Democrats are allowing Rea
gan to capture political territory that
could be theirs.
Last month's essentially anti-busi
ness tax bill is one example of this
phenomenon. As improbable as it may
seem, defense might be another area

where Reagan gains the upper hand.
Members of the Business Council and
congressmen on both sides of the aisle
are vocally expressing their dissatisfac
tion with defense spending. Reagan just
might compromise in this ared, propose
some cuts and take the windjout of the
Democrat s sails. Yet if the democrats
clearly defined their position,jstated ex
actly where the defense budget should
be cut, they wouldn't be open to pre
emptive strikes of this naturje by Rea

gan. The Democrats have a head start
in the race to capture the middle, be
cause Reagan is tied down, at least
partially, by the right wing of his party.
But victory is not assured.
In the legislative arena, the past two
years have been a spectacle of Demo
cratic impotence. Virtually ail policy in
the 97th Congress originated in the
White House or the Republican side of
the aisle. Democratic rhetoric about
fairness, justice and equity is fine, but
who isn't for fairness? People want to
hear about programs and strategies for
change that achieve that fairness with
the economic realities of today in mind.
Social Security would be a good place
for the Democrats to display the in
itiative and creativity that has been so
noticably absent recently. There is vir-

tually unanimous agreement that the
program as it now stands is doomed.
Yet many Democrats are content to let
it sink in the belief Reagan will sink
with it. These people underestimate the
intelligence of the public and the politi
cal ability of Reagan. When the presi
dent gets on TV with his chart that
shows there isn't enough revenue to
cover benefits, the American people
will listen. And when he says, "there are
no easy answers, we have to tighten our

belts. . . Here is what I'm proposing.. .
" the American public will agree and
support him. If the Democrats were to
take the initiative on this difficult issue,
and propose sound, reasonable legisla
tion, they would be surprised at the sup
port they would receive. Democrats
must be willing to take tough stands on
tough issues.
Another factor which may work
against the Democrats coming together
and proposing sound alternatives is the
race for the Democratic presidential
nomination which has begun in earnest.
Senators Edward Kennedy, John
Glenn, Gary Hart, Alan Cranston and
several others are already campaigning
hard. The presidential campaign ,em
vironment is conducive to generalities
and rhetoric, not programs and tough
positions. As it stands now, whoever
has the fortune of winning the nomi
nation will have the misfortune of lead
ing a factionalized, "plan-less" party
into the 1984 presidential contest.
While the party hasn't come to a con
sensus on any ideas, the neo-liberals
have some new proposals which should
be seriously considered. Retooling
American industry with an emphasis on
high technology, improving the quality
of public education, targeting tax cuts
and rebuilding the nation's infrastruc
ture are among the areas neo-liberals
focus on.
If the Democrats interpret the 1982
election as an opportunity to gather
forces and offer innovative ideas to this
nation's problems, 1982 will portend a
rosy future. I|, instead, they illogically
see this election as a vindication of trad
itional Democratic policies or even as a
moment to catch their breath, the Dem
ocratic Party's success will be short
lived.
