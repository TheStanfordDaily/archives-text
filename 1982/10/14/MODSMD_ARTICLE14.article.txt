## Portrait of energy-conscious Soviet society 
### 
Russian trains In colored ribbons
Show you plains Little boys
Electric plants and In little hats
Wires, fences Hefty women
Bushes green and Teenage girls
Flowers, bugs In groups of three
People waiting And four.
For a train Houses, reddish colored
In the rain. In the background
Umbrellas Grey apartments
Flowery dresses Men in coats,
Rubber shoes Their hands in pockets —
Babushkas Rather boring
With calm expressions / must say.
Laden down But then again
With empty bottles. Who said
Little girls This was a play?
Certainly, living in the Soviet Union is no more
fun than living in Northern California. Then again,
as a famous man once said in his ex-maid's recom
mendation letter, "For those who like her, she's ide
al." People lived in crowded apartments, five fami
lies at a time, little brother sharing a room with older
brother and grandmother. A small kitchen and
bathroom, a narrow hallway, and an entrance away
from the street that smells like the age-old excrement
of innumerable homeless travellers. Nevertheless, in
the most crowded, most ancient apartment in the
worst part of town, the windows are double-paned,
the walls are at least a foot of concrete thick, and

people are constantly aware of those times when
there is hot water.
You see, there are some advantages to a highly
centralized, totalitarian regime, that maintains com
munistic goals of some kind. When Lenin said, "At
first our people will suffer, for our comforts are few
.. . but we will electrify Russia," he meant it, and it
did happen. In fact, the whole Soviet Union saw
light. The goal was an idealistic one, and the meth
ods were pragmatic. The results, however, were
there as planned. Most people don't have cars and
though they would like to have one, they really don't
need it. Trains, subways, buses, trolleybuses, trams,
you name it, they've got it. Even honest taxi drivers.
The point of the matter is that if the U.S.S.R. needs
oil, it's not because people don't conserve energy or
drive too much too often without carpooling. Which
is actually quite a nice thing to be able to say, "My
country has energy problems, but I'm certainly not
the only one to blame." *
Unfortunately, in the United States things are a
little more complicated. "My country has energy
problems, but I'm certainly not sure who the hell's to
blame." For one thing, constructing a major public
transportation network was not one of our goals
early on in the game. I guess making Model-T's was.
Or maybe finding gold up in the hills, or killing Indi
ans. Let's not get carried away here, but it just
doesn't make sense to gripe about people driving too
much, when there is no other alternative means of
transportation for non-ethnic bike riders. And we
do have a tendency to support cars and car-industry

related businesses with our taxes more we give
a hoot about Amtrak, Tor instance.
And maybe we didn't even need a Lenin some
where along the line. I mean look at France, Germa
ny, England, you name it, any Western jEuropean
country. There's always plenty of underground and
overground transportation, and people there don't
seem to care about their tax money going toward it.
The thing, though, is that we did, and have, and do.
So what's left to do is to conserve what energy we do
have control over... like heating, like water, like
electricity.
J I
It's really not as hard as it sounds. We have much
more than we need. Damn it, if the Soviets can do it,
so can we. It will just be harder, because we have to
do it on our own, out of our own concern for our
country, for what will be left of our energy resources
after we are gone and all those little American babies
are left to fend for themselves. We don't have a
Lenin, and besides that, we're hard-headed Ameri
cans. Cowboys and Indians.
People worry these days about the survivors of a
nuclear war. Why not worry, rather, $bout some
thing we could have some control over. Just re
member, at your next party, when somebody says,
"Gee, why aren't we doing something about the im
minent nuclear war, or about the horrible gas short
age, or about Brezhnev's health," that the time has
come to change the topic of conversation.

Rubber shoes Their hands in pockets —
Babushkas Rather boring
With calm expressions / must say.

With empty bottles. Who said
Little girls This was a play?
Certainly, living in the Soviet Union is no more
fun than living in Northern California. Then again,
as a famous man once said in his ex-maid's recom
mendation letter, "For those who like her, she's ide
al." People lived in crowded apartments, five fami
lies at a time, little brother sharing a room with older
brother and grandmother. A small kitchen and
bathroom, a narrow hallway, and an entrance away
from the street that smells like the age-old excrement
of innumerable homeless travellers. Nevertheless, in
the most crowded, most ancient apartment in the
worst part of town, the windows are double-paned,
the walls are at least a foot of concrete thick, and

people are constantly aware of those times when
there is hot water.
You see, there are some advantages to a highly
centralized, totalitarian regime, that maintains com
munistic goals of some kind. When Lenin said, "At
first our people will suffer, for our comforts are few
.. . but we will electrify Russia," he meant it, and it
did happen. In fact, the whole Soviet Union saw
light. The goal was an idealistic one, and the meth
ods were pragmatic. The results, however, were
there as planned. Most people don't have cars and
though they would like to have one, they really don't
need it. Trains, subways, buses, trolleybuses, trams,
you name it, they've got it. Even honest taxi drivers.
The point of the matter is that if the U.S.S.R. needs
oil, it's not because people don't conserve energy or
drive too much too often without carpooling. Which
is actually quite a nice thing to be able to say, "My
country has energy problems, but I'm certainly not
the only one to blame." *
Unfortunately, in the United States things are a
little more complicated. "My country has energy
problems, but I'm certainly not sure who the hell's to
blame." For one thing, constructing a major public
transportation network was not one of our goals
early on in the game. I guess making Model-T's was.
Or maybe finding gold up in the hills, or killing Indi
ans. Let's not get carried away here, but it just
doesn't make sense to gripe about people driving too
much, when there is no other alternative means of
transportation for non-ethnic bike riders. And we
do have a tendency to support cars and car-industry

related businesses with our taxes more we give
a hoot about Amtrak, Tor instance.
And maybe we didn't even need a Lenin some
where along the line. I mean look at France, Germa
ny, England, you name it, any Western jEuropean
country. There's always plenty of underground and
overground transportation, and people there don't
seem to care about their tax money going toward it.
The thing, though, is that we did, and have, and do.
So what's left to do is to conserve what energy we do
have control over... like heating, like water, like
electricity.

It's really not as hard as it sounds. We have much
more than we need. Damn it, if the Soviets can do it,
so can we. It will just be harder, because we have to
do it on our own, out of our own concern for our
country, for what will be left of our energy resources
after we are gone and all those little American babies
are left to fend for themselves. We don't have a
Lenin, and besides that, we're hard-headed Ameri
cans. Cowboys and Indians.
People worry these days about the survivors of a
nuclear war. Why not worry, rather, $bout some
thing we could have some control over. Just re
member, at your next party, when somebody says,
"Gee, why aren't we doing something about the im
minent nuclear war, or about the horrible gas short
age, or about Brezhnev's health," that the time has
come to change the topic of conversation.

Russian trains In colored ribbons
Show you plains Little boys
Electric plants and In little hats
Wires, fences Hefty women
Bushes green and Teenage girls
Flowers, bugs In groups of three
People waiting And four.
For a train Houses, reddish colored
In the rain. In the background
Umbrellas Grey apartments
Flowery dresses Men in coats,
Rubber shoes Their hands in pockets —
Babushkas Rather boring
