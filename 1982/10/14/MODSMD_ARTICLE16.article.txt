# Baha'i students celebrate anniversary of prophet's visit
## 
### FELICIA LEE 
In October of 1912, Baha, the eldest son of
the man regarded by those of the Baha'i faith
as a prophet, read a moving speech urging
universal peace and unity to a cheering, en
thusiastic crowd of over 1000 students, facul
ty and community members here.
Some 70 years later, last Friday night, ap
proximately 180 members of the Stanford
community gathered to commemorate the
anniversary of Abdul-Baha's visit to Stan
ford.
Local interest in Abdul-Baha's original vis
it was so great that an entire issue of The Palo
Allan was devoted to Abdul-Baha and the
Baha'i faith, and the entire senior class of a
Bay Area boys' school endured a two-day
hike to Stanford in order to hear the speech.
Yet then, as now, the Baha'i faith was un
familiar to many people. It is a very young re
ligion (its founding prophet, a Persian
nobleman known as Baha'u'llah, as pro
claimed a messenger of God in 1844) al
though its tenets — the unity of mankind, the
equality of men and women, and the aboli
tion of all types of prejudice — are timeless.
Indeed, it is the Baha'i faith's youth that
distinguishes it. Members of the faith regard
the prophet Baha'u'llah as the most recent of
the long line of prophets which included Jesus
and Mohammed. Although they recognize
and respect the truth of all former revelations,
they regard the teaching of Baha'u'llah as the
most recent revelation of God.
Ehsan Talebi, a Baha'i student here at
Stanford, explained this concept of
"progressive revelations." Each prophet, he

said, brought with him a message suited for
the time and place from which he came.
"Prophets are basically the same," he said,
referring to the belief that they were all sent
by the same God. "It is not a matter of saying
that this prophet did not have enough knowl
edge and this prophet does. It's just the way
that they came and the time and the place they
came was suitable for the specific teachings
that they brought."
Baha'u'llah himself, Talebi pointed out,
proclaimed himself to be only one of many

prophets and spoke in his teachings of the
coming of future prophets.
It was the very relevance of the Baha'i prin
ciples of peace and unity to the turbulent
years before World War I which prompted
Stanford's then-president David Starr Jordan
to invite the prophet's son, Abdul-Baha, to
speak on campus. His speech, which urged
universal peace and the use of science and hu
man knowledge for the common goal, was
eagerly received by the Stanford community.
Marion Carpenter Yazdi, a Stanford alum

nus and the first Baha'i student to attend
Stanford, spoke to Friday night's audience
about the significance on Abdul-Baha's visit
and its profound effect on her own personal
life. Although she was not yet in high school
at the time of his arrival at Stanford, she be
came intrigued by newspaper accounts of his
visit, and it was this interest which drew her to
Stanford.
"I felt in my little-girl way that some of his
presence might linger on,"she recalled in her
speech to Friday's audience. "And at least
there would be professors there who had
heard them, and I could interview them and
find out every detail."
She did go on to speak to many professors
about the visit, and during her years at Stan
ford she ran weekly Baha'i meetings, first out
of her room in Roble, and later (with David
Starr Jordan's permission), out of the Wom
en's Clubhouse.
The contemporary implications of Baha'i
teachings were further discussed by the sec
ond speaker, Amin Banani, a professor of
Near Eastern studies at UCLA. He urged that
those in the audience "see this event as more
than an anniversary" and he warned the au
dience that the danger of war which threat
ened the world in 1912 still exists today. The
Baha'i principles of universal peace and the
abolition of such dividing elements as racism,
nationalism and religious prejudice, he said,
are not only idealistic, but "eminently sen
sible."
"These are Utopian dreams," he told the
audience, "but in our time, the alternative is a
real and pressing nightmare."
