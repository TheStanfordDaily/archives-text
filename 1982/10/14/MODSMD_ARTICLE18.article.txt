# Memorial Auditorium chairs refurbished

### CHRISTIE WOOD 
In 1937, the 1694 scats designed and or
dered specially to furnish Stanford's brand
new "Memorial Theater" were made of the
finest mohair — top quality stuff, to be sure,
and very plush indeed. But when audiences
filed into Mem Aud in the spring of 1982 to
see Bertolt Brecht's "The Three-Penny Op
era," those same seats were looking a little
worn.
In fact, even the most refined theater-goers
were forced to stop in mid-aisle and mentally
count rows, trying to match tickets with seat
numbers far too faded to read.
However, when the Lively Arts at Stanford
opens its 1982-83 season with Soviet-emigre
pianist Bella Davidovich on October IS, it
will be in a newly refurbished Memorial
Auditorium.
"The 1694 seats in Mem Aud have been re
placed by 1721 deep red all-wool plush seats.
The back of the chairs are wooden rosewood,
and the new carpeting is also deep red," said
Vicky Holt, director of University Events and
Services.
"A computer was used to plot a new seat
ing pattern so that no one will sit directly be
hind anyone else," she added, "Each au
dience member can then have an un
obstructed view of the performance."

"For the past five years we've been slowly
bringing our performing facilities up to first
class standards. Considering the artists we
have using them, it's about time," Holt said.
Traditionally, Stanford has a rich history
of architectural design, dating back to Leland
Stanford's specifications for the University's

original buildings. Construction and, occa
sionally, reconstruction, on campus becomes
involved and usually expensive. According to
the Office of Events and Services, Mem Aud's
interior renovation project cost the Univer
sity approximately $860,000.
At least $20,000 was spent for a new light
ing board, located in the rear of the

auditorium, in the sound and lighting control
booth. The new system — a Strand-Century
Light Pallet — is among the most advanced
equipment now available for theater lighting.
The design of the auditorium must be flex
ible enough to accommodate a variety of dra
matic and musical performances; scaffolding
along the down-stage can be raised, lowered
and even sunk into orchestra "pits." The new
seating arrangement allows the first two rows
of chairs to be pulled out so that the stage may
be extended if desired.
"There will also be a removable section of
seats in the center section which will allow for
a sound console to be placed there when
needed," Holt said.
The traffic through Mem Aud has in
creased dramatically within the last several
years as a result of the ASSU Sunday Flicks,
and other programs for which the auditorium
has recently been opened.
"It's indicative of Stanford's investment
and commitment to the performing arts that
money is being put into its performing facil
ities. The upgrading makes them easier to
maintain and more efficient to operate," Holt
said. "But the University also realizes that
providing attractive theaters <s a good way to
attract more audiences and to sell more
tickets to its shows."
