# Taiwanese students disclaim spy network
## 
### KATHY CHRISTIE Staff writer 
Although University Ombudsperson John
Goheen has stated in a nationally publicized report
that there exists here at Stanford and nationwide a
network of Taiwanese students spying on each oth
er, some Taiwanese students here claim they are
skeptical of the methodology that he used in in
vestigating the situation.
Goheen began his investigation into this "strange
and disconcerting situation" after several
Taiwanese students came to his office to seek advice
on how to counter an article which appeared in the
Stanford Independent October 23, 1981.
The Taiwanese students told Goheen they be
lieved reporter Carl Johnston made a "false accusa
tion both with regard to their own conduct and that
of the Taiwanese government," according to "the
annual report of the University Ombudsperson
1981-82." Goheen says in that document that "if
their objection was sustained, a public apology by
the Stanford Independent seemed to be in order."
Using the evidence that Johnston used in his arti
cle — though Goheen never personally spoke to any
of Johnston's sources — and information gathered
from other sources all over the country, Goheen said
he came to the conclusion that "there is here at Stan
ford and at other institutions a network of
Taiwanese students spying on each other and refer
ring their findings to the Taiwan government. The
objective is to suppress any criticism of the Taiwan
regime or dissent from its totalitarian principles."
He said that only a limited group of Taiwanese
students here are involved, and that non-student
Taiwanese nationals have been involved also.

When questioned, Johnston said that he could not
remember the names of the students quoted in his
story, but that he had given them to Goheen. In
Johnston s story, the real names of the Taiwanese
students with whom he spoke were not used.
Goheen refused to provide the names of the students
which Johnston used as sources.
The students who originally complained to
Goheen question his methodology, saying that they
believe Goheen's information is based on some
biased evidence.
"He did not make any real investigation of the
campus; he just got some articles friom some anti
government organization something like that that
he said most of our students are spips. That is very
unfair to us," said Weiwen Chung, one of the
students who originally went to Goheen.
Chung and two other Taiwanese students in
terviewed by the Daily said they thought Goheen
should have had more evidence than Johnston's
before coming to any conclusions, and they question
whether it was even possible for him; to conduct the
thorough investigation that was needed to come up
with the conclusions that he did.
Although the students say that they personally are
not aware of any spying being done here at Stanford,
if it is in fact happening, they would like to know
who is doing it.
An informal telephone survey made of Taiwanese
students in the Stanford community brought forth
reactions much like those of these students. "There
is no so-called spy person. We are very free," said
graduate student Hsiao-Keng Chu. Younglim Soo,
also a graduate student, echoed an opinion voiced
by many: "There is no spying in the campus. We

cannot do anything but study. Who else can do the
spying?"
Even if this is the case now, this has not always
been the opinion of all of the members of the
Taiwanese community here. In a recent letter to
Campus Report, a University professor reported
that one of his Ph. D. students from several years ago
had told him "of exactly the kind of surveillance of
Taiwanese students recently reported by the Om
budsman." His student had requested to the pro
fessor that he not "raise discussion of this kind in
any forum, because of fears that he could then be in

For this reason, the professor asked Stanford's
News and Publications Service that his name not be
published with the letter.
Fulton Armstrong, press secretary to Rep. Jim
Leach (R-lowa)saidof the congressional probe con
ducted by Leach that " we concluded in our in
vestigations that in fact the Taipei authorities were
conducting a program of surveillance in the U.S.,
and in some cases it went beyond surveillance into a
form of intimidation." Although Armstrong had no
specific information to report in regard to the situ
ation here, he did add that Leach's investigation was
restricted to college campuses.
Although said he was unable to give any more de
tails, Armstrong said that at the present there is a
"major battle" between Taiwanese students on the
campus of a college "in a southern state here." In
vestigations have already revealed "namecalling,
blackballing and death threats" among the students
there," he said.
