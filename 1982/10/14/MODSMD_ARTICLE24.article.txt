# Steve Kuhn: he's back, he's performing and he's due
## 
### TED GIOIA 
In one of his rare interviews,
; pianist Steve Kuhn spoke at
| length of the disappointments of
his career in jazz:
"The reviews I got on the last
| Cobblestone album read, 'Well,
| it's about time, he's been around
' long enough, he's paid his dues.
| Why doesn't it happen for Steve
I Kuhn?" It's really strange. It
• could drive me into Creedmore
i or Bellvue. So I figure it's going
j to happen sooner or later. It's
i hard for me to think about it, be
! cause you start doubting your
' own abilities; you have to have a
j lot of belief in yourself, and not
i inflated ego belief, just a dedi
cation and inner belief that it's
! there and it's going to have to
[ take time."
! Those familiar with the music
j of Steve Kuhn may find it hard to
j believe that anyone could doubt
his considerable abilities as a pi
anist or composer — least of all
! Kuhn himself. Yet that body of
! admirers is small indeed when
compared with the following that
his near contemporaries — Bill
Evans, Keith Jarrett and Chick
Corea come to mind — have
gained.
A long sojourn overseas dur
ing the late '60s effectively kept
Kuhn out of sight while many
younger and less talented musi
cians were establishing reputa
tions here in the United States.
Returning to America in the ear
ly '70s, Kuhn recorded two semi
nal albums for Cobblestone —
albums that might have given
Kuhn a certain amount of
notoriety had they received
greater promotion and distribu
tion.
Yet from an artistic point of
view the Cobblestone albums
were decided successes. They in
dicated that Kuhn — even more
than Hancock or Corea — was
capable of formulating a stylized
approach to jazz which was both
fresh and unique. Kuhn's group
employed an instrumentation
that was far from typical: Kuhn
on electric piano, accompanied
by bass drums, assorted per-
Jussion and, on occasion, a string
quartet (admirably arranged by
the late Gary McFarland).
Kuhn's compositions were un
commonly lyrical, yet his im
provisations ventured daringly
into the avant-garde against the
steady, almost danceable
rhythms laid down by the other
musicians. Add to this conconc
tion Kuhn's wry song lyrics, and
the result was one of the more or
iginal musical syntheses to
emerge in jazz over the past two
decades.
Kuhn's music rose above the
sameness that was characteristic
of most modern jazz — even his
critics granted that much — yet
the poor commercial success of
these releases led to the pianist's
virtual disappearance into the
anonymous world of wedding
bands, session work and all too
infrequent club dates.
When he emerged again on the
ECM label in the mid-'7os,
Kuhn's playing was more re
strained and more orthodox.
Like a number of other ECM pi

anists — Richie Beirach, Art
Lande, Keith Jarrett — Kuhn
was consolidating a brand of
post-Bill Evans piano music: the
harmonies were complex, the
rhythms were diffuse, the
melodic improvisations were ex
tremely chromatic in their use of
passing tones unrelated to the
root chord's scale. Atonality
would make its appearance now
and again, yet his playing re
mained, for the most part, quite #
accessible.
At the same time Kuhn ap
peared to have given up, at least
temporarily, singing and writing
lyrics to his compositions. For
many of Kuhn's followers this
was a most unwelcome change.
Kuhn was one of few songwriters
who, working out of popular mu
sic tradition, was able to create a
body of work which could rival in
precision and complexity the
works ofa Hugo Wolfora Franz
Schubert. Certainly there were
few antecedents in the jazz tradi
tion for what Kuhn was doing.
Some felt that Kuhn's reluctance
to continue songwriting stemmed
from his realization that he was
working with a genre that few
jazz fans could understand or ap
preciate.
The strengths of the early
ECM albums were quite different
from the virtues that character
ized the Cobblestone releases.
More emphasis was placed on
Kuhn the pianist, and this gave
him ample opportunity to dis
play his remarkable touch con
trol and sense of dynamics. In the
same interview with Robert
Hurwitz quoted above Kuhn rec
ollected:
"I remember hearing Horo
witz play for the first time, al
though the part of the experience

that stands out in my mind was
seeing him. When he was about
to play loudly — a triple for
tissimo or forzando — he would
simply brace his foot on the back
of the piano stool, and would get
the largest sound I ever heard
with the smallest amount of body
action. And of course the
dynamic range was phenomenal
— his ability to achieve the most
precise pianissimos was as spec
tacular."
Such admiration for Horo
witz's use of dynamics is entirely
consistent with Kuhn's own mu

sical values. There is a tendency
among jazz musicians — even
among the best of them — to play
in a virtually unchanging
dynamic range: neither too soft
or too loud. Those few musicians
who have taken notice of
dynamics — Count Basie, F.rroll
Garner — often do so in a flashy,
amusing way that smacks of
parody. Kuhn, in contrast, is ex
tremely thoughtful in his choice
of dynamics, and has shown on a
number of occasions that his
crescendos and dimuendos can be
both technically impressfVe and
musically sound.
With his 1980 release Play
ground Kuhn went back to song
writing. But now Kuhn would no
longer sing his own works; this
role was assumed by Sheila Jor
dan — a singer who, like Kuhn,
had developed a small cult fol
lowing without achieving any
marked commercial success. The
Steve Kuhn/Sheila Jordan
Quartet, as the resulting en
semble was called, showed that
the two artists werq .extremely
compatible; yet the synthesis was
not achieved without some give
and-take on the part of the co
leaders. Jordan's fans in particu
lar resented the singer being used
as a type of "human saxophone;"
and it was certainly true that she
was not 'leading' a group the way
most jazz singers do. At the same
time, the group concept allowed
Jordan a greater degree of in
terplay with instrumentalists
than one expects from a vpcalist,
and thus gave her performance
an added sense of freshness and
originality.
The group's latest album, Last
Year's Waltz, develops the same
approach. Jordan appears on
only some of the tracks, the rest
of the album being given over to
Kuhn's trio work. The record
opens with Kuhn's rousing com

position "Mexico" — a piece
which superfically seems to be a
mere compilation of the type of
musical cliches' that one in
evitably finds emanating from
Mexican restaurant jukeboxes
and Spanish speaking radio sta
tions. But when placed in a main
stream jazz setting, these same
motifs seem now and, in a way,
quite ambitious.
It is no great secret that jazz
and Latin music show an almost
magnetic affinity for one anoth
er; some have speculated that this
ease of interaction stems from a
shared African source for both
genres. Long before
ethnomusicologists studied such
hypotheses, Jelly Roll Morton —
a turn-of-the-century New Or
leans musician — once remarked
that all good jazz needed to have
a slight "Spanish tinge." Jelly
Roll's comment seems, in ret
rospect, to be strikingly prophet
ic — the ensuing generations saw
jazz embrace Cuban music, bossa
nova samba, and salsa, as well as
the innovations of a number of
Spanish classical composers.
Despite this proliferation of
Latin jazz, Kuhn manages to find
previously unexplored niches.
An earlier composed "Deep
Tango" is one of the few recent
jazz tangos, while the aforemen
tioned "Mexico" features a rela
tively novel Mexican-hat-dance
type of jazz.
The album also sees Kuhn and
his group-mates explore two jazz
standards — quite a departure
for a group that has recorded
only originals in the past. "I Re
member You" and "Confirma
tion" find Kuhn playing in a
more traditional vein than on
past albums. This return to the
mainstream, however, is not
without its cost: by departing
from his stylistic roots, Kuhn
gains accessibility at the cost of
individuality. These are polished

performances, but not signifi
cantly different from what any
number of other musicians are
doing.
Kuhn's compositions, both
vocal and instrumental, are the
group's true catalysts. For all
that his body of compositions is
quite small; like those other great
jazz composers — Duke Ell
ington, Thelonious Monk,
Charles Mingus — Kuhn con
tinually records the same com
positions over and over again.
Kuhn's ECM releases feature

many of the songs which first ap
pears on the Cobblestone label
only with different titles —
"Pearlie's Swine" becomes "The
Zoo"; "The Saga of Harrison
Crabfeathers" becomes "Poem
for No. 15"; "Thoughts of a Gen
tleman" becomes "Gentle
Thoughts" (perhaps because it
would be odd for Sheila Jordan
to sing a song with the original ti
tle), and so on. The constant re

recording of the same material is
no sign of Kuhn's lack of inspira
tion for new pieces; rather one
suspects that Kuhn is hoping that
these compositions will receive
the recognition on their second
or third time around that eluded
them upon their debut.
One hopes the same will hap
pen for Kuhn himself. The
quartet has already achieved
enough success to allow Kuhn to
make a rare visit to California to
appear at San Francisco's Key
stone Korner — something that

simply would not have been pos
sible several years back. At the
same time Kuhn is recording for
a label with high artistic stan
dards and good distribution (an
all too rare combination). The
Steve Kuhn/Sheila Jordan
Quartet may eventually help
both of the co-leaders achieve
that wider reputation for ex
cellence that they both have so
long deserved.

Kuhn's music rose
above the sameness
that was
characteristic of most
modern jazz — even
his critics granted
that much — yet the
poor commercial
success of these
releases led to the
pianist's virtual
disappearance into
the anonymous world
of wedding bands,
session work and all
too infrequent club
dates.
In one of his rare interviews,
; pianist Steve Kuhn spoke at
| length of the disappointments of
his career in jazz:
"The reviews I got on the last
| Cobblestone album read, 'Well,
| it's about time, he's been around
' long enough, he's paid his dues.
| Why doesn't it happen for Steve
I Kuhn?" It's really strange. It
• could drive me into Creedmore
i or Bellvue. So I figure it's going
j to happen sooner or later. It's
i hard for me to think about it, be
! cause you start doubting your
' own abilities; you have to have a
j lot of belief in yourself, and not
i inflated ego belief, just a dedi
cation and inner belief that it's
! there and it's going to have to
[ take time."
! Those familiar with the music
j of Steve Kuhn may find it hard to
j believe that anyone could doubt
his considerable abilities as a pi
anist or composer — least of all
! Kuhn himself. Yet that body of
! admirers is small indeed when
compared with the following that
his near contemporaries — Bill
Evans, Keith Jarrett and Chick
Corea come to mind — have
gained.
A long sojourn overseas dur
ing the late '60s effectively kept
Kuhn out of sight while many
younger and less talented musi
cians were establishing reputa
tions here in the United States.
Returning to America in the ear
ly '70s, Kuhn recorded two semi
nal albums for Cobblestone —
albums that might have given
Kuhn a certain amount of
notoriety had they received
greater promotion and distribu
tion.
Yet from an artistic point of
view the Cobblestone albums
were decided successes. They in
dicated that Kuhn — even more
than Hancock or Corea — was
capable of formulating a stylized
approach to jazz which was both
fresh and unique. Kuhn's group
employed an instrumentation
that was far from typical: Kuhn
on electric piano, accompanied
by bass drums, assorted per-
Jussion and, on occasion, a string
quartet (admirably arranged by
the late Gary McFarland).
Kuhn's compositions were un
commonly lyrical, yet his im
provisations ventured daringly
into the avant-garde against the
steady, almost danceable
rhythms laid down by the other
musicians. Add to this conconc
tion Kuhn's wry song lyrics, and
the result was one of the more or
iginal musical syntheses to
emerge in jazz over the past two
decades.
Kuhn's music rose above the
sameness that was characteristic
of most modern jazz — even his
critics granted that much — yet
the poor commercial success of
these releases led to the pianist's
virtual disappearance into the
anonymous world of wedding
bands, session work and all too
infrequent club dates.
When he emerged again on the
ECM label in the mid-'7os,
Kuhn's playing was more re
strained and more orthodox.
Like a number of other ECM pi

anists — Richie Beirach, Art
Lande, Keith Jarrett — Kuhn
was consolidating a brand of
post-Bill Evans piano music: the
harmonies were complex, the
rhythms were diffuse, the
melodic improvisations were ex
tremely chromatic in their use of
passing tones unrelated to the
root chord's scale. Atonality
would make its appearance now
and again, yet his playing re
mained, for the most part, quite #
accessible.
At the same time Kuhn ap
peared to have given up, at least
temporarily, singing and writing
lyrics to his compositions. For
many of Kuhn's followers this
was a most unwelcome change.
Kuhn was one of few songwriters
who, working out of popular mu
sic tradition, was able to create a
body of work which could rival in
precision and complexity the
works ofa Hugo Wolfora Franz
Schubert. Certainly there were
few antecedents in the jazz tradi
tion for what Kuhn was doing.
Some felt that Kuhn's reluctance
to continue songwriting stemmed
from his realization that he was
working with a genre that few
jazz fans could understand or ap
preciate.
The strengths of the early
ECM albums were quite different
from the virtues that character
ized the Cobblestone releases.
More emphasis was placed on
Kuhn the pianist, and this gave
him ample opportunity to dis
play his remarkable touch con
trol and sense of dynamics. In the
same interview with Robert
Hurwitz quoted above Kuhn rec
ollected:
"I remember hearing Horo
witz play for the first time, al
though the part of the experience

that stands out in my mind was
seeing him. When he was about
to play loudly — a triple for
tissimo or forzando — he would
simply brace his foot on the back
of the piano stool, and would get
the largest sound I ever heard
with the smallest amount of body
action. And of course the
dynamic range was phenomenal
— his ability to achieve the most
precise pianissimos was as spec
tacular."
Such admiration for Horo
witz's use of dynamics is entirely
consistent with Kuhn's own mu

sical values. There is a tendency
among jazz musicians — even
among the best of them — to play
in a virtually unchanging
dynamic range: neither too soft
or too loud. Those few musicians
who have taken notice of
dynamics — Count Basie, F.rroll
Garner — often do so in a flashy,
amusing way that smacks of
parody. Kuhn, in contrast, is ex
tremely thoughtful in his choice
of dynamics, and has shown on a
number of occasions that his
crescendos and dimuendos can be
both technically impressfVe and
musically sound.
With his 1980 release Play
ground Kuhn went back to song
writing. But now Kuhn would no
longer sing his own works; this
role was assumed by Sheila Jor
dan — a singer who, like Kuhn,
had developed a small cult fol
lowing without achieving any
marked commercial success. The
Steve Kuhn/Sheila Jordan
Quartet, as the resulting en
semble was called, showed that
the two artists werq .extremely
compatible; yet the synthesis was
not achieved without some give
and-take on the part of the co
leaders. Jordan's fans in particu
lar resented the singer being used
as a type of "human saxophone;"
and it was certainly true that she
was not 'leading' a group the way
most jazz singers do. At the same
time, the group concept allowed
Jordan a greater degree of in
terplay with instrumentalists
than one expects from a vpcalist,
and thus gave her performance
an added sense of freshness and
originality.
The group's latest album, Last
Year's Waltz, develops the same
approach. Jordan appears on
only some of the tracks, the rest
of the album being given over to
Kuhn's trio work. The record
opens with Kuhn's rousing com

position "Mexico" — a piece
which superfically seems to be a
mere compilation of the type of
musical cliches' that one in
evitably finds emanating from
Mexican restaurant jukeboxes
and Spanish speaking radio sta
tions. But when placed in a main
stream jazz setting, these same
motifs seem now and, in a way,
quite ambitious.
It is no great secret that jazz
and Latin music show an almost
magnetic affinity for one anoth
er; some have speculated that this
ease of interaction stems from a
shared African source for both
genres. Long before
ethnomusicologists studied such
hypotheses, Jelly Roll Morton —
a turn-of-the-century New Or
leans musician — once remarked
that all good jazz needed to have
a slight "Spanish tinge." Jelly
Roll's comment seems, in ret
rospect, to be strikingly prophet
ic — the ensuing generations saw
jazz embrace Cuban music, bossa
nova samba, and salsa, as well as
the innovations of a number of
Spanish classical composers.
Despite this proliferation of
Latin jazz, Kuhn manages to find
previously unexplored niches.
An earlier composed "Deep
Tango" is one of the few recent
jazz tangos, while the aforemen
tioned "Mexico" features a rela
tively novel Mexican-hat-dance
type of jazz.
The album also sees Kuhn and
his group-mates explore two jazz
standards — quite a departure
for a group that has recorded
only originals in the past. "I Re
member You" and "Confirma
tion" find Kuhn playing in a
more traditional vein than on
past albums. This return to the
mainstream, however, is not
without its cost: by departing
from his stylistic roots, Kuhn
gains accessibility at the cost of
individuality. These are polished

performances, but not signifi
cantly different from what any
number of other musicians are
doing.
Kuhn's compositions, both
vocal and instrumental, are the
group's true catalysts. For all
that his body of compositions is
quite small; like those other great
jazz composers — Duke Ell
ington, Thelonious Monk,
Charles Mingus — Kuhn con
tinually records the same com
positions over and over again.
Kuhn's ECM releases feature

many of the songs which first ap
pears on the Cobblestone label
only with different titles —
"Pearlie's Swine" becomes "The
Zoo"; "The Saga of Harrison
Crabfeathers" becomes "Poem
for No. 15"; "Thoughts of a Gen
tleman" becomes "Gentle
Thoughts" (perhaps because it
would be odd for Sheila Jordan
to sing a song with the original ti
tle), and so on. The constant re

recording of the same material is
no sign of Kuhn's lack of inspira
tion for new pieces; rather one
suspects that Kuhn is hoping that
these compositions will receive
the recognition on their second
or third time around that eluded
them upon their debut.
One hopes the same will hap
pen for Kuhn himself. The
quartet has already achieved
enough success to allow Kuhn to
make a rare visit to California to
appear at San Francisco's Key
stone Korner — something that

simply would not have been pos
sible several years back. At the
same time Kuhn is recording for
a label with high artistic stan
dards and good distribution (an
all too rare combination). The
Steve Kuhn/Sheila Jordan
Quartet may eventually help
both of the co-leaders achieve
that wider reputation for ex
cellence that they both have so
long deserved.

same time Kuhn is recording for
a label with high artistic stan
dards and good distribution (an
all too rare combination). The
Steve Kuhn/Sheila Jordan
Quartet may eventually help
both of the co-leaders achieve
that wider reputation for ex
cellence that they both have so
long deserved.




Kuhn's music rose
above the sameness
that was
characteristic of most
modern jazz — even
his critics granted
that much — yet the
poor commercial
success of these
releases led to the
pianist's virtual
disappearance into
the anonymous world
of wedding bands,
session work and all
too infrequent club
dates.
In one of his rare interviews,
; pianist Steve Kuhn spoke at
| length of the disappointments of
his career in jazz:
"The reviews I got on the last
| Cobblestone album read, 'Well,
| it's about time, he's been around
' long enough, he's paid his dues.
| Why doesn't it happen for Steve
I Kuhn?" It's really strange. It
• could drive me into Creedmore
i or Bellvue. So I figure it's going
j to happen sooner or later. It's
i hard for me to think about it, be
! cause you start doubting your
' own abilities; you have to have a
j lot of belief in yourself, and not
i inflated ego belief, just a dedi
cation and inner belief that it's
! there and it's going to have to
[ take time."
! Those familiar with the music
j of Steve Kuhn may find it hard to
j believe that anyone could doubt
his considerable abilities as a pi
anist or composer — least of all
! Kuhn himself. Yet that body of
! admirers is small indeed when
compared with the following that
his near contemporaries — Bill
Evans, Keith Jarrett and Chick
Corea come to mind — have
gained.
A long sojourn overseas dur
ing the late '60s effectively kept
Kuhn out of sight while many
younger and less talented musi
cians were establishing reputa
tions here in the United States.
Returning to America in the ear
ly '70s, Kuhn recorded two semi
nal albums for Cobblestone —
albums that might have given
Kuhn a certain amount of
notoriety had they received
greater promotion and distribu
tion.
Yet from an artistic point of
view the Cobblestone albums
were decided successes. They in
dicated that Kuhn — even more
than Hancock or Corea — was
capable of formulating a stylized
approach to jazz which was both
fresh and unique. Kuhn's group
employed an instrumentation
that was far from typical: Kuhn
on electric piano, accompanied
by bass drums, assorted per-
Jussion and, on occasion, a string
quartet (admirably arranged by
the late Gary McFarland).
Kuhn's compositions were un
commonly lyrical, yet his im
provisations ventured daringly
into the avant-garde against the
steady, almost danceable
rhythms laid down by the other
musicians. Add to this conconc
tion Kuhn's wry song lyrics, and
the result was one of the more or
iginal musical syntheses to
emerge in jazz over the past two
decades.
Kuhn's music rose above the
sameness that was characteristic
of most modern jazz — even his
critics granted that much — yet
the poor commercial success of
these releases led to the pianist's
virtual disappearance into the
anonymous world of wedding
bands, session work and all too
infrequent club dates.
When he emerged again on the
ECM label in the mid-'7os,
Kuhn's playing was more re
strained and more orthodox.
Like a number of other ECM pi

anists — Richie Beirach, Art
Lande, Keith Jarrett — Kuhn
was consolidating a brand of
post-Bill Evans piano music: the
harmonies were complex, the
rhythms were diffuse, the
melodic improvisations were ex
tremely chromatic in their use of
passing tones unrelated to the
root chord's scale. Atonality
would make its appearance now
and again, yet his playing re
mained, for the most part, quite #
accessible.
At the same time Kuhn ap
peared to have given up, at least
temporarily, singing and writing
lyrics to his compositions. For
many of Kuhn's followers this
was a most unwelcome change.
Kuhn was one of few songwriters
who, working out of popular mu
sic tradition, was able to create a
body of work which could rival in
precision and complexity the
works ofa Hugo Wolfora Franz
Schubert. Certainly there were
few antecedents in the jazz tradi
tion for what Kuhn was doing.
Some felt that Kuhn's reluctance
to continue songwriting stemmed
from his realization that he was
working with a genre that few
jazz fans could understand or ap
preciate.
The strengths of the early
ECM albums were quite different
from the virtues that character
ized the Cobblestone releases.
More emphasis was placed on
Kuhn the pianist, and this gave
him ample opportunity to dis
play his remarkable touch con
trol and sense of dynamics. In the
same interview with Robert
Hurwitz quoted above Kuhn rec
ollected:
"I remember hearing Horo
witz play for the first time, al
though the part of the experience

that stands out in my mind was
seeing him. When he was about
to play loudly — a triple for
tissimo or forzando — he would
simply brace his foot on the back
of the piano stool, and would get
the largest sound I ever heard
with the smallest amount of body
action. And of course the
dynamic range was phenomenal
— his ability to achieve the most
precise pianissimos was as spec
tacular."
Such admiration for Horo
witz's use of dynamics is entirely
consistent with Kuhn's own mu

sical values. There is a tendency
among jazz musicians — even
among the best of them — to play
in a virtually unchanging
dynamic range: neither too soft
or too loud. Those few musicians
who have taken notice of
dynamics — Count Basie, F.rroll
Garner — often do so in a flashy,
amusing way that smacks of
parody. Kuhn, in contrast, is ex
tremely thoughtful in his choice
of dynamics, and has shown on a
number of occasions that his
crescendos and dimuendos can be
both technically impressfVe and
musically sound.
With his 1980 release Play
ground Kuhn went back to song
writing. But now Kuhn would no
longer sing his own works; this
role was assumed by Sheila Jor
dan — a singer who, like Kuhn,
had developed a small cult fol
lowing without achieving any
marked commercial success. The
Steve Kuhn/Sheila Jordan
Quartet, as the resulting en
semble was called, showed that
the two artists werq .extremely
compatible; yet the synthesis was
not achieved without some give
and-take on the part of the co
leaders. Jordan's fans in particu
lar resented the singer being used
as a type of "human saxophone;"
and it was certainly true that she
was not 'leading' a group the way
most jazz singers do. At the same
time, the group concept allowed
Jordan a greater degree of in
terplay with instrumentalists
than one expects from a vpcalist,
and thus gave her performance
an added sense of freshness and
originality.
The group's latest album, Last
Year's Waltz, develops the same
approach. Jordan appears on
only some of the tracks, the rest
of the album being given over to
Kuhn's trio work. The record
opens with Kuhn's rousing com

position "Mexico" — a piece
which superfically seems to be a
mere compilation of the type of
musical cliches' that one in
evitably finds emanating from
Mexican restaurant jukeboxes
and Spanish speaking radio sta
tions. But when placed in a main
stream jazz setting, these same
motifs seem now and, in a way,
quite ambitious.
It is no great secret that jazz
and Latin music show an almost
magnetic affinity for one anoth
er; some have speculated that this
ease of interaction stems from a
shared African source for both
genres. Long before
ethnomusicologists studied such
hypotheses, Jelly Roll Morton —
a turn-of-the-century New Or
leans musician — once remarked
that all good jazz needed to have
a slight "Spanish tinge." Jelly
Roll's comment seems, in ret
rospect, to be strikingly prophet
ic — the ensuing generations saw
jazz embrace Cuban music, bossa
nova samba, and salsa, as well as
the innovations of a number of
Spanish classical composers.
Despite this proliferation of
Latin jazz, Kuhn manages to find
previously unexplored niches.
An earlier composed "Deep
Tango" is one of the few recent
jazz tangos, while the aforemen
tioned "Mexico" features a rela
tively novel Mexican-hat-dance
type of jazz.
The album also sees Kuhn and
his group-mates explore two jazz
standards — quite a departure
for a group that has recorded
only originals in the past. "I Re
member You" and "Confirma
tion" find Kuhn playing in a
more traditional vein than on
past albums. This return to the
mainstream, however, is not
without its cost: by departing
from his stylistic roots, Kuhn
gains accessibility at the cost of
individuality. These are polished

performances, but not signifi
cantly different from what any
number of other musicians are
doing.
Kuhn's compositions, both
vocal and instrumental, are the
group's true catalysts. For all
that his body of compositions is
quite small; like those other great
jazz composers — Duke Ell
ington, Thelonious Monk,
Charles Mingus — Kuhn con
tinually records the same com
positions over and over again.
Kuhn's ECM releases feature

many of the songs which first ap
pears on the Cobblestone label
only with different titles —
"Pearlie's Swine" becomes "The
Zoo"; "The Saga of Harrison
Crabfeathers" becomes "Poem
for No. 15"; "Thoughts of a Gen
tleman" becomes "Gentle
Thoughts" (perhaps because it
would be odd for Sheila Jordan
to sing a song with the original ti
tle), and so on. The constant re

recording of the same material is
no sign of Kuhn's lack of inspira
tion for new pieces; rather one
suspects that Kuhn is hoping that
these compositions will receive
the recognition on their second
or third time around that eluded
them upon their debut.
One hopes the same will hap
pen for Kuhn himself. The
quartet has already achieved
enough success to allow Kuhn to
make a rare visit to California to
appear at San Francisco's Key
stone Korner — something that

simply would not have been pos
sible several years back. At the
same time Kuhn is recording for
a label with high artistic stan
dards and good distribution (an
all too rare combination). The
Steve Kuhn/Sheila Jordan

them upon their debut.
One hopes the same will hap
pen for Kuhn himself. The
quartet has already achieved
enough success to allow Kuhn to
make a rare visit to California to
appear at San Francisco's Key
stone Korner — something that

simply would not have been pos
sible several years back. At the
same time Kuhn is recording for
a label with high artistic stan
dards and good distribution (an
all too rare combination). The
Steve Kuhn/Sheila Jordan
Quartet may eventually help
both of the co-leaders achieve
that wider reputation for ex
cellence that they both have so
long deserved.




Kuhn's music rose
above the sameness
that was
characteristic of most
modern jazz — even
his critics granted
that much — yet the
poor commercial
success of these
releases led to the
pianist's virtual
disappearance into
the anonymous world
of wedding bands,
session work and all
too infrequent club
dates.
