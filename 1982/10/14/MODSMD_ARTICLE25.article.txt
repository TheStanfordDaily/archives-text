# Joe Cocker (and his voice) resurface

Joe Cocker's new album Shef
field Steel re-establishes him as a
highly skilled interpretive vocal
ist. With the help of rhythm
wizards Sly Dunbar and Robbie
Shakespeare, Cocker signs a cap
tivating signature of reggae and
blues that rivals Bruce Spring
steen's rhythm and blues in its
ability to impart emotion.
The album cover immediately
presents us with the promise of
passion. On it is a painting of a
grueling face that could very well
be Cocker's. And the disc de
livers what the cover promised,
angst and passion, from the very
start. Cocker opens the album
with two heavily blues-in
fluenced tracks, "Look What
You've Done" and "Shocked,"
that set the theme of struggling.
Cocker moves confidently
through these cuts, in complete
control of his eloquently ragged
voice.
The resolve of Bob Dylan's
"Seven Days" keeps Cocker's
vocal strength alive. It is the only
real rock 'n' roll (rhythm and
blues) selection on the album,
complete with heavy emphasis on
the drum/bass rhythm track and
the prominence of the guitar
licks.
And yet, Cocker ends the first
side with his most graceful effort,
"Marie." His control and yes, his
ravaged voice elevate the sen
timental lyric to a delicate, fer
vent serenade. The nearly a
capella production showcases
Cocker's ability to handle the

most emotional lyric, reminding
us of "You Are So Beautiful." I
can't say enough about this song.
After wasting a cut ("Ruby
Lee"), Cocker handles another
blues-reggae tune, the classic
"Many Rivers to Cross." The
cymbal touches and light rhythm
track build with the de
termination of the lyrics unti the
slow, heavy accentuating beat
contrasts with the sparsity of the
opening accompaniment. And
yet, the song is all Cocker's.
When he sings "Sure this lone
liness won't leave me alone/It's
such a drag to be on your
own/My woman left me but she
didn't say why/Guess I'll break
right down and cry" you believe
him. Jimmy Cliff helps on this
album, but he sing back
ground vocals on his own song:
Again, Cocker doesn't need vo
cal help on this song or any other.
The tension and passion
climax in Steve Winwood's
"Talking Back to the Night," an
image-filled song about the frus
tration of being a struggling ar
tist. Cocker deftly controls the
vocal crescendo until he explodes
in the chorus. Meanwhile, the
rhythm section keeps itself down.
This gives the song its boiling,
back-door feel until the guitar
erupts with Cocker. Here, all the
frustration inherent on the album
since the first sight of the cover
busts out.
But Cocker calms down at the
end of the album. "Just Like
Always" is an acoustic blues cut
which finds Cocker comfortable
and hopeful with nostalgia. He
ends side two like side one, lifting
a slightly corny lyric above the

commonplace to the moving.
With all the styles and in
fluences present on the album, it
seems easy to get lost in the varie
ty. Guest appearances by Cliff,
Robert Palmer and Adrian Belew
threaten to dominate the album

and shatter it into a directionless
shambles. But the two constants
— the slick, understated musical
direction and the sheer beauty of
Cocker's voice — establish the
album's unity. Like a Springsteen
record, Sheffield Steel owes its
success to the intelligence of the

interpretation. That is not to say,
of course, that Bruce Springsteen
and Joe Cocker have a lot in com
mon. They don't. It's just to say
that like Springsteen, Joe Cocker
can move you merely with his
voice, his tone. Sheffield Steel's
beauty lies in Joe Cocker's voice.
