It was just an album ago — in

reminded us .. after all, we
didn't change — everybody else
did!" and to a large extent it was
true. For a good part of the mid
and late-'7os, the Canadian trio
was a moderately successful tour
ing band with a growing cult of
fans rabidly loyal to their particu
lar brand of in
volved, percussively intricate
"thought-rock." Rush expanded
their ability and scope with a
number of largely obscure
albums that culminated in the re
lease of the heavy metal/art rock
opera 2112 and its successor,
Hemispheres. With these two rec
ords Rush proved themselves a
band of creative lyricism and in
creasingly impressive technical
prowess, but it was not until the
release of their next album, Per
manent Waves, that the group
began to realize a widespread lis
tenership. Then, with the now
platinum-certified Moving Pic

Great White North was thrust
into the limelight. Rush was no

impression that Geddy Lee isn't
angry any more, and it's an edge
that's sadly missing here. One
need look no further than Peart's
enigmatic, evocative and often
insightful lyrics, however, to as
sure himself of the group's con
cern for its audience and interest
in the world around them.

Thematically, Peart does his
best work in the context of the in
dividual in conflict with society,
as is evidenced by the album's
two singles, "New World Man"
and "Subdivisions" ("Growing
up it all seems so one sided
/Opinions are provided /The

future pre-decided /Detached
and subdivided in the mass pro
duction zone /Nowhere is the
dreamer or the misfit so
alone. . .") or "The Analog
Kid," a Tom Sawyeresque
vignette of suburban childhood.
The formula works best, though,
when new ground is carefully ex

plored, as in the melancholic
glimpse at the nature,,of age in
"Losing It,"the album's prettiest
cut, or the abstract look at fear in
a society and those who control
it,"The Weapon" ("He's not
afraid of the judgement /He
knows of horrors worse than
your hell /He's a little bit afraid
of dying /But he's a lot more
afraid of your lying /And the
things that he fears are a weapon
to be held against him"), the
album's strongest. This formula,
a combination of their new in
strumental order and smooth,
edgeless production makes the
album Rush's most accessible
and salable, a somewhat sadden
ing departure for older loyalists
and a point of entry for new con
verts yet to discover their earlier
work.
Has Rush sold out? No. All in
all, Signals is an album that does
what they want it to — keep us
thinking, keep us dreaming, keep
us buying. Even rock's
philosophers have to pay the
rent.

It was just an album ago — in
(he liner notes to the double-live
pxit. . . Stage Left — that Rush
reminded us .. after all, we
didn't change — everybody else
did!" and to a large extent it was
true. For a good part of the mid
and late-'7os, the Canadian trio
was a moderately successful tour
ing band with a growing cult of
fans rabidly loyal to their particu
lar brand of in
volved, percussively intricate
"thought-rock." Rush expanded
their ability and scope with a
number of largely obscure
albums that culminated in the re
lease of the heavy metal/art rock
opera 2112 and its successor,
Hemispheres. With these two rec
ords Rush proved themselves a
band of creative lyricism and in
creasingly impressive technical
prowess, but it was not until the
release of their next album, Per
manent Waves, that the group
began to realize a widespread lis
tenership. Then, with the now
platinum-certified Moving Pic
tures, this cult band from the
Great White North was thrust
into the limelight. Rush was no
longer a stranger to change, and
1 it is change — in music, produc
tion and theme — that permeates
Signals.
From the outset, things just
aren't the same; Geddy Lee's use
