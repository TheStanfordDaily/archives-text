# Something else on Saturday...

### PATRICIA GONZALEZ 
The Grateful Dead concert
was not the only great musical
event in the Bay Area last week
end. Saturday, the 6th annual
Bread & Roses Benefit took
place at Berkeley's Greek
Theatre. This lively celebration
of peace and unity featured the
diverse talents of established per
formers such as Peter, Paul &
Mary, Robin Williams and the
Smothers Brothers as well as a
couple of exciting but lesser
known jazz bands: Roomful of
Blues and the Klezmorim.
The executive director of
Bread & Roses, Mimi Farina,
opened the program by explain
ing that the purpose of the benefit
was to be able to fund shows and
provide entertainment for those
unable to attend live events.
Bread & Roses currently per
forms 40 shows a month for peo
ple in prisons, hospitals, con
vaslescent homes, psychiatric
wards, and centers for develop
mentally disabled. That day,
Bread & Roses broadcast the
concert live to San Quentin.
The MCs of the festival in
cluded Father Guide Sarducci of
"Saturday Night Live," Howard
Hesseman of "WKRP in Cincin
nati" and local comedian
Michael Pritchard. The MCs
provided small comedic routines,
filling time between set changes
of the regular acts in a tight for
mat that successfully kept the
pace.
The main musical guest was
the familiar group, Peter, Paul &
Mary, who performed tunes rem
iniscent of an era long gone but
not forgotten. The audience sang
along with all the appropriate

harmonies the group is famous
for. They performed a variety of
songs including, "Leaving on a
Jet Plane," "Blowin' in the
Wind,"."lf I Had a Hammer,"
and of course, "Puff the Magic
Dragon."
Immediately before them ap
peared the energetic Robin Wil
liams of "Mork and Mindy" and
"Garp" fame. He literally
jumped off the stage and tore into
the audience using hapless spec
tators in spontaneous bits of hu
mor. Williams projected his
amazing enthusiasm and ver
satility, completely captivating
his audience.
A couple of unique jazz bands
appeared at the festival including
a group called the Klezmorim.
The group creatively adapts pop
ular Yiddish tunes into a bizarre
form of jazz. The two styles were
cleverly blended into one harmo
nious form.
The other band. Roomful of
Blues, from Providence, Rhode
Island had nine very proficient
jazz musicians who zipped
through some hot numbers. The
size of the band was slightly big
ger than today's small jazz en
sembles, but the size didn't affect
the intimacy or the quality of the
player's improvisations. The
band used true blues style with a
solid four-beat bar, and a wan
dering bass so often missed in to
day's strictly brass groups.
Two soloists, Tracy Nelson
and Etta James, appeared with
the band and added dramatic in
tensity to some low-down tunes.
Etta James, a strong, colorful
personality was helped on stage
by Mimi Farina because she was,
as she put it, "dinged-out" from

the night before. But that didn't
affect her performance — she
had the audience singing and
dancing in the aisles to a type of
rock-n-rollish jazz.
Roomful of Blues may soon
appear more prominently on the
music scene, since they now have
two albums out and will be ap
pearing at the Old Waldorf on
October 14.
Hovt Axton, the author of old
ies like "Joy to the World," was
also on the bill singing some cute
little tunes. Despite a couple of
embarrassing memory lapses, he
still pulled off a good per
formance.
Another act featured was the
Smothers Brothers, who per
formed their version of ancient
madrigal songs and folk tunes.
They only half-heartedly tried to
resurrect their old routine of sibl
ing rivalry and banter, but their
act was amusing anyway.
The Bread & Roses Festival
staff produced a tightly run and
thoroughly enjoyable show that
usually brings in huge audiences.
Mimi Farina told the Daily that
the last audience count (as of Qct.
12) was 4800, considerably
smaller than the 8500 seating ca
pacity of the Greek Theatre. In
previous years the festival lasted
for three days with sold-out au
diences.
The delightful blend of humor
and music from old and new tal
ent was excellent and at the end ,
of the concert the entire cast
joined Peter, Paul & Mary in a
rendition of "This Land is Your
Land." One hopes that, the 7th
annual Bread & Roses Festival
will get the audience a celebra
tion surely deserves.

Hovt Axton, the author of old
ies like "Joy to the World," was
also on the bill singing some cute
little tunes. Despite a couple of
embarrassing memory lapses, he
still pulled off a good per
formance.
Another act featured was the
Smothers Brothers, who per
formed their version of ancient
madrigal songs and folk tunes.
They only half-heartedly tried to
resurrect their old routine of sibl
ing rivalry and banter, but their
act was amusing anyway.
The Bread & Roses Festival
staff produced a tightly run and
thoroughly enjoyable show that
usually brings in huge audiences.
Mimi Farina told the Daily that
the last audience count (as of Qct.
12) was 4800, considerably
smaller than the 8500 seating ca
pacity of the Greek Theatre. In
previous years the festival lasted
for three days with sold-out au
diences.
The delightful blend of humor
and music from old and new tal
ent was excellent and at the end ,
of the concert the entire cast
joined Peter, Paul & Mary in a
rendition of "This Land is Your
Land." One hopes that, the 7th
annual Bread & Roses Festival
will get the audience a celebra
tion surely deserves.
The Grateful Dead concert
was not the only great musical
event in the Bay Area last week
end. Saturday, the 6th annual
Bread & Roses Benefit took
place at Berkeley's Greek
Theatre. This lively celebration
of peace and unity featured the
diverse talents of established per
formers such as Peter, Paul &
Mary, Robin Williams and the
Smothers Brothers as well as a
couple of exciting but lesser
known jazz bands: Roomful of
Blues and the Klezmorim.
The executive director of
Bread & Roses, Mimi Farina,
opened the program by explain
ing that the purpose of the benefit
was to be able to fund shows and
provide entertainment for those
unable to attend live events.
Bread & Roses currently per
forms 40 shows a month for peo
ple in prisons, hospitals, con
vaslescent homes, psychiatric
wards, and centers for develop
mentally disabled. That day,
Bread & Roses broadcast the
concert live to San Quentin.
The MCs of the festival in
cluded Father Guide Sarducci of
"Saturday Night Live," Howard
Hesseman of "WKRP in Cincin
nati" and local comedian
Michael Pritchard. The MCs
provided small comedic routines,
filling time between set changes
of the regular acts in a tight for
mat that successfully kept the
pace.
The main musical guest was
the familiar group, Peter, Paul &
Mary, who performed tunes rem
iniscent of an era long gone but
not forgotten. The audience sang
along with all the appropriate

harmonies the group is famous
for. They performed a variety of
songs including, "Leaving on a
Jet Plane," "Blowin' in the
Wind,"."lf I Had a Hammer,"
and of course, "Puff the Magic
Dragon."
Immediately before them ap
peared the energetic Robin Wil
liams of "Mork and Mindy" and
"Garp" fame. He literally
jumped off the stage and tore into
the audience using hapless spec
tators in spontaneous bits of hu
mor. Williams projected his
amazing enthusiasm and ver
satility, completely captivating
his audience.
A couple of unique jazz bands
appeared at the festival including
a group called the Klezmorim.
The group creatively adapts pop
ular Yiddish tunes into a bizarre
form of jazz. The two styles were
cleverly blended into one harmo
nious form.
The other band. Roomful of
Blues, from Providence, Rhode
Island had nine very proficient
jazz musicians who zipped
through some hot numbers. The
size of the band was slightly big
ger than today's small jazz en
sembles, but the size didn't affect
the intimacy or the quality of the
player's improvisations. The
band used true blues style with a
solid four-beat bar, and a wan
dering bass so often missed in to
day's strictly brass groups.
Two soloists, Tracy Nelson
and Etta James, appeared with
the band and added dramatic in
tensity to some low-down tunes.
Etta James, a strong, colorful
personality was helped on stage
by Mimi Farina because she was,
as she put it, "dinged-out" from

the night before. But that didn't
affect her performance — she
had the audience singing and
dancing in the aisles to a type of
rock-n-rollish jazz.
Roomful of Blues may soon
appear more prominently on the
music scene, since they now have
two albums out and will be ap
pearing at the Old Waldorf on
October 14.
