# Proposition 15: 'totally useless' or desirable law?
## 
### LISA LYNCH 
Supporter, opponent debate gun control

Proposition 15, otherwise known as
the 1982 Handgun Violence Prevention
Act, was defended by the chairman of
Californians Against Street Crime and
attacked by a National Rifle Associa
tion media director in a debate last
night at Roble.
In essence, Proposition 15 requires
the registration of guns purchased in re
tail and non-retail sales, and limits the
number of guns available in California
to those purchased prior to a pre
determined registration date. 1 his
would effectively put a cap on the
number of guns available to Californi
ans, making guns more costly and more
difficult to obtain.
Vincent Palmieri, the CASC chair
man, opened the debate against the
NRA's Paul Stone by describing the
virtues of the new law. He said that

fewer guns on the streets would mean
fewer crimes and that stricter regis
tration procedures would weed out un
desirable potential gun owners. He as
sured the crowd that Proposition 15 is
not a ban and that any citizen who
wanted to purchase a handgun in the
future could easily do so, because of the
enormous "circulation pool" of guns
that would still be available.
Palmieri accused the NRA of being
so obsessed with their own special in
terests that they would stop harmless
and helpful legislation like the in
troduction of tracer chemicals in ex
plosives and the banning of bullets that
can pierce bulletproof vests.
"I welcome Paul Stone to the corn

munity," Palmieri said, "along with the
$5 million the NRA has imported into
California to stop Proposition 15."
Palmieri claimed that the N R A had sto
len some documents from the Califor
nia District Attorney to support its
campaign, and continued to use the in
formation after the DA had discredited
it.
Stone responded to Palmieri by in
sisting Proposition 15 was ineffective
and unnecessary. "Registration is total
ly useless," he insisted, explaining that
most crimes are committed with un
registered guns or guns stolen from
their rightful owners. "The gun control
people would hold the owner of a gun
responsible for everything it was used

for — that just isn't practical."
He insisted that though many think
that gun registration is harmless, it is re
allv as harmful it is ineffective because it
provides for a climate of stricter gun
control. "People are going to see this go
throilgh and want even more restric
tions," he said.
As for the cap on the number of guns
in California, Stone insisted that there
was no correlation between the number
of guns and the amount of gun-related
crime.
"I'm acting as a proponent of gun
control here," Stone claimed, insisting
that gun control lobbyists should admit
thcv want a gun ban.
f-arlier in the day, a California state
Court of Appeal struck down the ban
on handguns approved by the city of
San Francisco's Board of Supervisors
last June.
