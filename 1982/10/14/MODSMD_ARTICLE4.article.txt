SF gun ban ruled unconstitutional
Sm Francisco — San Francisco's handgun ban, which would have out
lawed ownership of pistols except in a handful of cases, was ruled un
constitutional on yesterday by a state Court of Appeals.
The second such ban in the nation, San Francisco's ordinance was ap
proved in June by the Board of Supervisors, but was not scheduled to take
effect until October 27. Morton Grove, 111., was the first community to ban
handguns, and its law was upheld in federal court.
The ordinance had broad support from Mayor Dianne Feinstein and a
variety of city officials. But the three-judge panel agreed with opponents, rul
ing that only the state Legislature has the power to make laws concerning the
possession or ownership of handguns.
"Obviously, I am very sad," said Feinstein. "But it is not the end of the
battle. It is only a ruling and it can be appealed.
The mayor, who said handguns kilt 23,000 people a year in the United
States, said she hadn't read the decision or discussed it with city attorneys to
determine whether to appeal to the state Supreme Court.
"We're delighted with it," said Jerry Hallisey, an attorney for the plain
tiffs. "It's consistent with prior decisions by the courts...
The judges said they were "sensitive to the political and social
overtones of a case such as this..." But they added that they
were concerned "only with the narrow legal question of whether
the state Constitution and state statutes permit San Francisco to
enact such an ordinance. We conclude that they do not."
The court told San Francisco officials not to enforce the hand
gun ordinance and to advise residents that it won't be enforced.
The ordinance made it a misdemeanor for anyone to possess a
handgun in San Francisco. The maximum penalty was a 30-day
jail term and $500 fine.
About 100 handguns have been turned in, police said. The
mayor recently presented Pope John Paul II with a cross made
from some 15 melted-down handguns, including one of her own.
Peace officers, members of the military on duty, people using
licensed target ranges, certain licensed collectors, certain
licensed guards and special peace officers were exempt. Also ex
empt were people with permits to carry concealed weapons and
those authorized to sell handguns.
The issue will be on the state ballot on Nov. 2 as Proposition
15. That initiative would require handgun owners to register
their weapons with the state Department of Justice no later than
Nov. 2, 1983, and also would make it a misdemeanor to buy, sell
or transfer an unregistered handgun.
Stock market rockets again
New York — The stock market resumed its powerful rally yes
terday, propelling the Dow Jones industrials average to a 17-
month high in the second-busiest trading day in New York Stock
Exchange history.
Energy issues led the buying binge in the fifth straight day in
which more than 100 million shares changed hands on the Big
Board.
More than three stocks rose in price for every one that fell on
the NYSE, with 417 issues rising to 52-week highs while just
three fell to new lows.
The Dow Jones average of 30 industrial stocks, which fell 9.11
points Tuesday, shot up 11.40 points to end the day at 1015.08. It
had been even higher at midafternoon, when the blue-chip aver
age was up more than 23 points.
The advance was a sharp reversal from the 5.52 point-decline
in the opening 30 minutes of activity and was the highest finish
since the average stood at 1016.93 on Apr. 28,1981.
Over the last two months, the widely followed average has
rocketed 238.16 points, or by 30.7 percent.
Big Board volume totaled 139.80 million shares, up from
126.36 million Tuesday and second only to last Thursday's
147.07 million. Nationwide turnover in NYSE-listed issues, in
cluding trades in those stocks on regional exchanges and in the
over-the-counter market, totaled 159.24 million shares.
Energy issues dominated the active list on the NYSE.
Reagan: 4 America is recovery-bound'
Washington — Addressing the nation 20 days before the elec
tions, President Reagan said yesterday that "America is re
covery-bound" despite a "pounding economic hangover" and
unemployment which "has not yet stopped its upward drift."
In a nationally televised Oval Office speech that he maintained
was nonpartisan, but which clearly had political overtones, Rea
gan defended his economic policies, now under attack by Demo
crats, and concluded with his basic campaign theme: America's
economy can only become healthy again "by staying the
course."
"The pounding economic hangover America is suffering from
didn't come about overnight, and there is no single, instant
cure," the president said in his approximately 20-minute address.
"In recent weeks, a lot of people have been playing what I call the
'blame game.' The accusing finger has been pointed in every
direction of the compass and a lot of time and hot air have been
spent looking for scapegoats."
Yet Reagan has increasingly blamed former President Jimmy
Carter's administration for the recession.
While proudly pointing to reductions in inflation and interest
rates since he took office, Reagan acknowledged that "un
employment, always a lagging (economic) indicator in time of re
cession, has not yet stopped its upward drift." He said it hangs
like a "dark cloud" over the 11.3 million jobless, representing
10.1 percent of the work force.
The Democratic party was furious at the two major television
networks, NBC and CBS, that carried the president's speech live.
Democratic National Chairman Charles Manatt said that
NBC and CBS displayed "questionable judgment" in granting
Reagan free television time to repeat what he said was essentially
the campaign speech the president has been making across the
country.
The Democratic chairman said that since Reagan took office,

unemployment had climbed 44 percent, bankruptcies had gone
up 46.7 percent and mortgage foreclosures had increased 41 per
cent.
Dark horses share Nobel honors
Oslo, Norway — The 1982 Nobel Peace Prize was awarded
jointly yesterday to Alfonso Garcia Robles of Mexico and Alva
Myrdal of Sweden for their work toward world disarmament in
the past two decades.
Garcia Robles, a career diplomat and onetime foreign min
ister of Mexico, was the father of the 1967 Tlatelolco Agreement
that has been adhered to by almost every state in the Southern
Hemisphere and declares Latin America to be a nuclear-free
zone. He has served for years as his country's delegate to the
U.N. Disarmament Committee in Geneva and at special U.N.
disarmament assemblies, and is the first Mexican to win a Nobel
Prize.
Myrdal, 80, has spent a lifetime in national and international
politics, teaching and writing on social and economic problems.
From 1962 until her retirement she made disarmament her spe
cial concern as a Swedish Cabinet minister, as her country's rep
resentative in Geneva and then with a broad government man
date as a kind of roving disarmament ambassador.
She is the wife of Gunnar Mydral, who won the Nobel Prize in
economics in 1974.
The formal award of the peace prizes will take place in Oslo on
Dec. 10, the anniversary of the birth of Alfred Nobel, the inven
tor of dynamite who established international prizes for peace,
literature and sciences in his will in 1896. The first peace prize
was awarded in 1901, and the 1982 prize will amount to $157,000
to be divided between the two laureates.
The Nobel Committee is understood to have sifted about 80
nominations this year.
Nominations can be made by a wide variety of private individ
uals including members of all national legislatures belonging to
the interparliamentary union, all university professors of law,
history or philosophy, or previous prize winners.
Polish army forces end to strike
Gdansk, Poland — Threatened with military discipline and
backed only half-heartedly by underground Solidarity leaders of
the region, workers at the Lenin Shipyard here yesterday aban
doned a strike begun two days earlier to protest dissolution of the
independent trade union movement.
Massive security forces managed to impose a tense order on
the city after two days of street clashes officially estimated to
have caused more that $40,000 in damages.
However, demonstrations broke out in two other cities yester
day.
When first-shift workers at the Lenin Shipyard arrived for
work yesterday morning they were handed a militarization no
tice informing them that they had been conscripted and that any
one organizing a protest or engaging in any other anti-govern
ment actions would be subject to a prison term of up to five years.
Workers were issued new passes, each with a conscription
number, and navy officers took up stations in each department.
The text of the militarization order, which was announced Tues
day night, was repeatedly broadcast over the shipyard
loudspeaker, as was notice that all vacations had been canceled.
Police used tear gas to disperse several thousand workers who
were attempting to march from the giant Lenin steel mill in
Nowa Huta to a nearby church in the Krakow suburb.
In Wroclaw, eyewitnesses said that about 20 police vehicles,
including water cannons, were used to break up a crowd of sever
al hundred demonstrators near a tram depot.
The disturbunces in Nowa Huta and Wroclaw were the first
indications that the protest begun Monday was spreading from
the northern shipyards where Solidarity was born.
But the support appears to come to late for the Gdansk
strikers.
Shipyard commandant Stanislaw Zaczek ordered an
"absolute," on the dissemination of information without his
written permission and warned that instructions issued by any
superior must be obeyed just like a military order. There would
be no appeals against any directive, he said.
Fighting spreads southeast of Beirut
Beirut — Heavy fighting between Moslem and Christian
militiamen spread yesterday through the mountains southeast of
Beirut, threatening to upset the relative peace the capital area has
been enjoying since the arrival of the multinational peace-keep
ing force late last month.
Despite pledges from both the Lebanese and Israeli govern
ments to step in and halt the escalating violence, neither had suc
ceeded by nightfall in bringing it to an end.

Steady shelling by Christian militiamen of Moslem Druze vil
lages continued throughout the day, and at one point late y cs * er *
day afternoon two Israeli armored personnel carriers loaded
with troops found themselves coming under the fire of their own
Lebanese Christian allies.
The fighting appeared to be shaping up as a serious challenge
to the 4-week-old government of President Amin Gemayel,
whose control over his own party's militia, held largely respon
sible for the flare up, is thought to be tenuous.
Lebanese army troops appeared to ignore the fighting and in
stead resumed their sweeps through the southern suburbs of
West Beirut yesterday for weapons and illegal aliens. The
searches began Oct. 5 in the largely Moslem western part of the
city but, despite government promises, they so far have not taken
place in Christian East Beirut.
(The Unified Command of the Lebanese Forces, a grouping of
Christian militias nominally under the command of Gemayel,
yesterday notified the government that it would refuse to con
sider turning its weapons over to the Lebanese army, the leftist
daily A 1 Safir reported.)
Engine problems may set back launch
Cape Canaveral — Problems with the space shuttle
Challenger's three main engines may delay a tentative Jan. 20
maiden launch of the second craft in the four-shuttle fleet, ac
cording to space agency officials.
That sixth mission, with an advanced tracking satellite as its
cargo, could be pushed back as much as a week, said James
Kukowski, a National Aeronautics and Space Administration
spokesman in Washington.
A Jan. 20 launch "is still conjecture," Kukowski said Tuesday.
"We're aiming for it, but it's going to be tight."
A pressure leak in one of Challenger's three main engines has
delayed their delivery from the National Space Technology Labs
in Mississippi to Kennedy Space Center, where Challenger is
being prepared for flight.
The three Rockwell International engines, which were sched
uled to arrive in Florida late last month, must go through a bat
tery of tests before becoming certified for installation in the or
biter.
"During some of the calibration tests, we were not satisfied
and we did it again," said Kukowski.
So far, two engines have been certified after a 500-second test
firing. They should be delivered to the space center by Nov. 22 or
23, spokesman Mark Hess said Tuesday.
Agency investigates nuclear safeguards
The Nuclear Regulatory Commission is looking into charges
that substandard welds were approved in construction of critical
safety systems at two of the nation's nuclear power plants, in
cluding San Onofre, the Los Angeles Times has learned.
The NRC has launched a full-scale probe of welding practices
at the Midland, Mich., facility and has scheduled a formal in
spection at San Onofre. Both plants were designed and built by
Bechtel Power Corp.
The commission's actions are in response to charges made by
E. Earl Kent, a former Bechtel quality control engineer, who was
fired by the company in March.
Kent told the Times that unless Bechtel corrects "thousands"
of substandard welds on pipe and electrical system supports at
the two plants a breakdown of cooling-water and radioactive wa
ter pipe systems could result.
Kent described the pipe supports as critical because they are
used to suspend piping and electrical conduits. If they fail, he
said, the pipes and conduits could sag and break. Such weak
nesses threaten the systems that cool the reactor and carry radio
active water in a closed loop within the containment building.
He said he was not offering a prediction but rather a "proba
bility" which he arrived at based on 40 years of experience in
welding, including 17 years as a welding and quality control engi
neer.
Bechtel officials denied Kent's charges. The firm maintained
that all welding work in nuclear power plants it has built has been
done in strict conformance with applicable codes and is designed
to provide substantial safety margins for equipment subject to
severe stress.
At Southern California Edison Co., operator of San Onofre,
quality assurance manager Jarlath Curran said a review of
Kent's charges about welding work there has not revealed any
deficiencies in Bechtel's design or procedures.

Reagan: 4 America is recovery-bound'
Washington — Addressing the nation 20 days before the elec
tions, President Reagan said yesterday that "America is re
covery-bound" despite a "pounding economic hangover" and
unemployment which "has not yet stopped its upward drift."
In a nationally televised Oval Office speech that he maintained
was nonpartisan, but which clearly had political overtones, Rea
gan defended his economic policies, now under attack by Demo
crats, and concluded with his basic campaign theme: America's
economy can only become healthy again "by staying the
course."
"The pounding economic hangover America is suffering from
didn't come about overnight, and there is no single, instant
cure," the president said in his approximately 20-minute address.
"In recent weeks, a lot of people have been playing what I call the
'blame game.' The accusing finger has been pointed in every
direction of the compass and a lot of time and hot air have been
spent looking for scapegoats."
Yet Reagan has increasingly blamed former President Jimmy
Carter's administration for the recession.
While proudly pointing to reductions in inflation and interest
rates since he took office, Reagan acknowledged that "un
employment, always a lagging (economic) indicator in time of re
cession, has not yet stopped its upward drift." He said it hangs
like a "dark cloud" over the 11.3 million jobless, representing
10.1 percent of the work force.
The Democratic party was furious at the two major television
networks, NBC and CBS, that carried the president's speech live.
Democratic National Chairman Charles Manatt said that
NBC and CBS displayed "questionable judgment" in granting
Reagan free television time to repeat what he said was essentially
the campaign speech the president has been making across the
country.
The Democratic chairman said that since Reagan took office,

unemployment had climbed 44 percent, bankruptcies had gone
up 46.7 percent and mortgage foreclosures had increased 41 per
cent.
Dark horses share Nobel honors
Oslo, Norway — The 1982 Nobel Peace Prize was awarded
jointly yesterday to Alfonso Garcia Robles of Mexico and Alva
Myrdal of Sweden for their work toward world disarmament in
the past two decades.
Garcia Robles, a career diplomat and onetime foreign min
ister of Mexico, was the father of the 1967 Tlatelolco Agreement
that has been adhered to by almost every state in the Southern
Hemisphere and declares Latin America to be a nuclear-free
zone. He has served for years as his country's delegate to the
U.N. Disarmament Committee in Geneva and at special U.N.
disarmament assemblies, and is the first Mexican to win a Nobel
Prize.
Myrdal, 80, has spent a lifetime in national and international
politics, teaching and writing on social and economic problems.
From 1962 until her retirement she made disarmament her spe
cial concern as a Swedish Cabinet minister, as her country's rep
resentative in Geneva and then with a broad government man
date as a kind of roving disarmament ambassador.
She is the wife of Gunnar Mydral, who won the Nobel Prize in
economics in 1974.
The formal award of the peace prizes will take place in Oslo on
Dec. 10, the anniversary of the birth of Alfred Nobel, the inven
tor of dynamite who established international prizes for peace,
literature and sciences in his will in 1896. The first peace prize
was awarded in 1901, and the 1982 prize will amount to $157,000
to be divided between the two laureates.
The Nobel Committee is understood to have sifted about 80
nominations this year.
Nominations can be made by a wide variety of private individ
uals including members of all national legislatures belonging to
the interparliamentary union, all university professors of law,
history or philosophy, or previous prize winners.
Polish army forces end to strike
Gdansk, Poland — Threatened with military discipline and
backed only half-heartedly by underground Solidarity leaders of
the region, workers at the Lenin Shipyard here yesterday aban
doned a strike begun two days earlier to protest dissolution of the
independent trade union movement.
Massive security forces managed to impose a tense order on
the city after two days of street clashes officially estimated to
have caused more that $40,000 in damages.
However, demonstrations broke out in two other cities yester
day.
When first-shift workers at the Lenin Shipyard arrived for
work yesterday morning they were handed a militarization no
tice informing them that they had been conscripted and that any
one organizing a protest or engaging in any other anti-govern
ment actions would be subject to a prison term of up to five years.
Workers were issued new passes, each with a conscription
number, and navy officers took up stations in each department.
The text of the militarization order, which was announced Tues
day night, was repeatedly broadcast over the shipyard
loudspeaker, as was notice that all vacations had been canceled.
Police used tear gas to disperse several thousand workers who
were attempting to march from the giant Lenin steel mill in
Nowa Huta to a nearby church in the Krakow suburb.
In Wroclaw, eyewitnesses said that about 20 police vehicles,
including water cannons, were used to break up a crowd of sever
al hundred demonstrators near a tram depot.
The disturbunces in Nowa Huta and Wroclaw were the first
indications that the protest begun Monday was spreading from
the northern shipyards where Solidarity was born.
But the support appears to come to late for the Gdansk
strikers.
Shipyard commandant Stanislaw Zaczek ordered an
"absolute," on the dissemination of information without his
written permission and warned that instructions issued by any
superior must be obeyed just like a military order. There would
be no appeals against any directive, he said.
Fighting spreads southeast of Beirut
Beirut — Heavy fighting between Moslem and Christian
militiamen spread yesterday through the mountains southeast of
Beirut, threatening to upset the relative peace the capital area has
been enjoying since the arrival of the multinational peace-keep
ing force late last month.
Despite pledges from both the Lebanese and Israeli govern
ments to step in and halt the escalating violence, neither had suc
ceeded by nightfall in bringing it to an end.

Steady shelling by Christian militiamen of Moslem Druze vil
lages continued throughout the day, and at one point late y cs * er *
day afternoon two Israeli armored personnel carriers loaded
with troops found themselves coming under the fire of their own
Lebanese Christian allies.
The fighting appeared to be shaping up as a serious challenge
to the 4-week-old government of President Amin Gemayel,
whose control over his own party's militia, held largely respon
sible for the flare up, is thought to be tenuous.
Lebanese army troops appeared to ignore the fighting and in
stead resumed their sweeps through the southern suburbs of
West Beirut yesterday for weapons and illegal aliens. The
searches began Oct. 5 in the largely Moslem western part of the
city but, despite government promises, they so far have not taken
place in Christian East Beirut.
(The Unified Command of the Lebanese Forces, a grouping of
Christian militias nominally under the command of Gemayel,
yesterday notified the government that it would refuse to con
sider turning its weapons over to the Lebanese army, the leftist
daily A 1 Safir reported.)
Engine problems may set back launch
Cape Canaveral — Problems with the space shuttle
Challenger's three main engines may delay a tentative Jan. 20
maiden launch of the second craft in the four-shuttle fleet, ac
cording to space agency officials.
That sixth mission, with an advanced tracking satellite as its
cargo, could be pushed back as much as a week, said James
Kukowski, a National Aeronautics and Space Administration
spokesman in Washington.
A Jan. 20 launch "is still conjecture," Kukowski said Tuesday.
"We're aiming for it, but it's going to be tight."
A pressure leak in one of Challenger's three main engines has
delayed their delivery from the National Space Technology Labs
in Mississippi to Kennedy Space Center, where Challenger is
being prepared for flight.
The three Rockwell International engines, which were sched
uled to arrive in Florida late last month, must go through a bat
tery of tests before becoming certified for installation in the or
biter.
"During some of the calibration tests, we were not satisfied
and we did it again," said Kukowski.
So far, two engines have been certified after a 500-second test
firing. They should be delivered to the space center by Nov. 22 or
23, spokesman Mark Hess said Tuesday.
Agency investigates nuclear safeguards
The Nuclear Regulatory Commission is looking into charges
that substandard welds were approved in construction of critical
safety systems at two of the nation's nuclear power plants, in
cluding San Onofre, the Los Angeles Times has learned.
The NRC has launched a full-scale probe of welding practices
at the Midland, Mich., facility and has scheduled a formal in
spection at San Onofre. Both plants were designed and built by
Bechtel Power Corp.
The commission's actions are in response to charges made by
E. Earl Kent, a former Bechtel quality control engineer, who was
fired by the company in March.
Kent told the Times that unless Bechtel corrects "thousands"
of substandard welds on pipe and electrical system supports at
the two plants a breakdown of cooling-water and radioactive wa
ter pipe systems could result.
Kent described the pipe supports as critical because they are
used to suspend piping and electrical conduits. If they fail, he
said, the pipes and conduits could sag and break. Such weak
nesses threaten the systems that cool the reactor and carry radio
active water in a closed loop within the containment building.
He said he was not offering a prediction but rather a "proba
bility" which he arrived at based on 40 years of experience in
welding, including 17 years as a welding and quality control engi
neer.
Bechtel officials denied Kent's charges. The firm maintained
that all welding work in nuclear power plants it has built has been
done in strict conformance with applicable codes and is designed
to provide substantial safety margins for equipment subject to
severe stress.
At Southern California Edison Co., operator of San Onofre,
quality assurance manager Jarlath Curran said a review of
Kent's charges about welding work there has not revealed any
deficiencies in Bechtel's design or procedures.

SF gun ban ruled unconstitutional
Sm Francisco — San Francisco's handgun ban, which would have out
lawed ownership of pistols except in a handful of cases, was ruled un
constitutional on yesterday by a state Court of Appeals.
The second such ban in the nation, San Francisco's ordinance was ap
proved in June by the Board of Supervisors, but was not scheduled to take
effect until October 27. Morton Grove, 111., was the first community to ban
handguns, and its law was upheld in federal court.
The ordinance had broad support from Mayor Dianne Feinstein and a
variety of city officials. But the three-judge panel agreed with opponents, rul
ing that only the state Legislature has the power to make laws concerning the
possession or ownership of handguns.
"Obviously, I am very sad," said Feinstein. "But it is not the end of the
battle. It is only a ruling and it can be appealed.
The mayor, who said handguns kilt 23,000 people a year in the United
States, said she hadn't read the decision or discussed it with city attorneys to
determine whether to appeal to the state Supreme Court.
"We're delighted with it," said Jerry Hallisey, an attorney for the plain
tiffs. "It's consistent with prior decisions by the courts...
The judges said they were "sensitive to the political and social
overtones of a case such as this..." But they added that they
were concerned "only with the narrow legal question of whether
the state Constitution and state statutes permit San Francisco to
enact such an ordinance. We conclude that they do not."
The court told San Francisco officials not to enforce the hand
gun ordinance and to advise residents that it won't be enforced.
The ordinance made it a misdemeanor for anyone to possess a
handgun in San Francisco. The maximum penalty was a 30-day
jail term and $500 fine.
About 100 handguns have been turned in, police said. The
mayor recently presented Pope John Paul II with a cross made
from some 15 melted-down handguns, including one of her own.
Peace officers, members of the military on duty, people using
licensed target ranges, certain licensed collectors, certain
licensed guards and special peace officers were exempt. Also ex
empt were people with permits to carry concealed weapons and
those authorized to sell handguns.
The issue will be on the state ballot on Nov. 2 as Proposition
15. That initiative would require handgun owners to register
their weapons with the state Department of Justice no later than
Nov. 2, 1983, and also would make it a misdemeanor to buy, sell
or transfer an unregistered handgun.
Stock market rockets again
New York — The stock market resumed its powerful rally yes
terday, propelling the Dow Jones industrials average to a 17-
month high in the second-busiest trading day in New York Stock
Exchange history.
Energy issues led the buying binge in the fifth straight day in
which more than 100 million shares changed hands on the Big
Board.
More than three stocks rose in price for every one that fell on
the NYSE, with 417 issues rising to 52-week highs while just
three fell to new lows.
The Dow Jones average of 30 industrial stocks, which fell 9.11

that has been adhered to by almost every state in the Southern
Hemisphere and declares Latin America to be a nuclear-free
zone. He has served for years as his country's delegate to the
U.N. Disarmament Committee in Geneva and at special U.N.
disarmament assemblies, and is the first Mexican to win a Nobel
Prize.
Myrdal, 80, has spent a lifetime in national and international
politics, teaching and writing on social and economic problems.
From 1962 until her retirement she made disarmament her spe
cial concern as a Swedish Cabinet minister, as her country's rep
resentative in Geneva and then with a broad government man
date as a kind of roving disarmament ambassador.
She is the wife of Gunnar Mydral, who won the Nobel Prize in
economics in 1974.
The formal award of the peace prizes will take place in Oslo on
Dec. 10, the anniversary of the birth of Alfred Nobel, the inven
tor of dynamite who established international prizes for peace,
literature and sciences in his will in 1896. The first peace prize
was awarded in 1901, and the 1982 prize will amount to $157,000
to be divided between the two laureates.
The Nobel Committee is understood to have sifted about 80
nominations this year.
Nominations can be made by a wide variety of private individ

the interparliamentary union, all university professors of law,
history or philosophy, or previous prize winners.
Polish army forces end to strike
Gdansk, Poland — Threatened with military discipline and
backed only half-heartedly by underground Solidarity leaders of
the region, workers at the Lenin Shipyard here yesterday aban
doned a strike begun two days earlier to protest dissolution of the
independent trade union movement.
Massive security forces managed to impose a tense order on
the city after two days of street clashes officially estimated to
have caused more that $40,000 in damages.
However, demonstrations broke out in two other cities yester
day.
When first-shift workers at the Lenin Shipyard arrived for
work yesterday morning they were handed a militarization no
tice informing them that they had been conscripted and that any
one organizing a protest or engaging in any other anti-govern
ment actions would be subject to a prison term of up to five years.
Workers were issued new passes, each with a conscription
number, and navy officers took up stations in each department.
The text of the militarization order, which was announced Tues
day night, was repeatedly broadcast over the shipyard
loudspeaker, as was notice that all vacations had been canceled.
Police used tear gas to disperse several thousand workers who
were attempting to march from the giant Lenin steel mill in
Nowa Huta to a nearby church in the Krakow suburb.
In Wroclaw, eyewitnesses said that about 20 police vehicles,
including water cannons, were used to break up a crowd of sever
al hundred demonstrators near a tram depot.
The disturbunces in Nowa Huta and Wroclaw were the first
indications that the protest begun Monday was spreading from
the northern shipyards where Solidarity was born.
But the support appears to come to late for the Gdansk
strikers.
Shipyard commandant Stanislaw Zaczek ordered an
"absolute," on the dissemination of information without his
written permission and warned that instructions issued by any
superior must be obeyed just like a military order. There would
be no appeals against any directive, he said.
Fighting spreads southeast of Beirut
Beirut — Heavy fighting between Moslem and Christian
militiamen spread yesterday through the mountains southeast of
Beirut, threatening to upset the relative peace the capital area has
been enjoying since the arrival of the multinational peace-keep
ing force late last month.
Despite pledges from both the Lebanese and Israeli govern
ments to step in and halt the escalating violence, neither had suc
ceeded by nightfall in bringing it to an end.

Steady shelling by Christian militiamen of Moslem Druze vil
lages continued throughout the day, and at one point late y cs * er *
day afternoon two Israeli armored personnel carriers loaded
with troops found themselves coming under the fire of their own
Lebanese Christian allies.
The fighting appeared to be shaping up as a serious challenge
to the 4-week-old government of President Amin Gemayel,
whose control over his own party's militia, held largely respon
sible for the flare up, is thought to be tenuous.
Lebanese army troops appeared to ignore the fighting and in
stead resumed their sweeps through the southern suburbs of
West Beirut yesterday for weapons and illegal aliens. The
searches began Oct. 5 in the largely Moslem western part of the
city but, despite government promises, they so far have not taken
place in Christian East Beirut.
(The Unified Command of the Lebanese Forces, a grouping of
Christian militias nominally under the command of Gemayel,
yesterday notified the government that it would refuse to con
sider turning its weapons over to the Lebanese army, the leftist
daily A 1 Safir reported.)
Engine problems may set back launch
Cape Canaveral — Problems with the space shuttle
Challenger's three main engines may delay a tentative Jan. 20
maiden launch of the second craft in the four-shuttle fleet, ac
cording to space agency officials.
That sixth mission, with an advanced tracking satellite as its
cargo, could be pushed back as much as a week, said James
Kukowski, a National Aeronautics and Space Administration
spokesman in Washington.
A Jan. 20 launch "is still conjecture," Kukowski said Tuesday.
"We're aiming for it, but it's going to be tight."
A pressure leak in one of Challenger's three main engines has
delayed their delivery from the National Space Technology Labs
in Mississippi to Kennedy Space Center, where Challenger is
being prepared for flight.
The three Rockwell International engines, which were sched
uled to arrive in Florida late last month, must go through a bat
tery of tests before becoming certified for installation in the or
biter.
"During some of the calibration tests, we were not satisfied
and we did it again," said Kukowski.
So far, two engines have been certified after a 500-second test
firing. They should be delivered to the space center by Nov. 22 or
23, spokesman Mark Hess said Tuesday.
Agency investigates nuclear safeguards
The Nuclear Regulatory Commission is looking into charges
that substandard welds were approved in construction of critical
safety systems at two of the nation's nuclear power plants, in
cluding San Onofre, the Los Angeles Times has learned.
The NRC has launched a full-scale probe of welding practices
at the Midland, Mich., facility and has scheduled a formal in
spection at San Onofre. Both plants were designed and built by
Bechtel Power Corp.
The commission's actions are in response to charges made by
E. Earl Kent, a former Bechtel quality control engineer, who was
fired by the company in March.
Kent told the Times that unless Bechtel corrects "thousands"
of substandard welds on pipe and electrical system supports at
the two plants a breakdown of cooling-water and radioactive wa
ter pipe systems could result.
Kent described the pipe supports as critical because they are
used to suspend piping and electrical conduits. If they fail, he
said, the pipes and conduits could sag and break. Such weak
nesses threaten the systems that cool the reactor and carry radio
active water in a closed loop within the containment building.
He said he was not offering a prediction but rather a "proba
bility" which he arrived at based on 40 years of experience in
welding, including 17 years as a welding and quality control engi
neer.
Bechtel officials denied Kent's charges. The firm maintained
that all welding work in nuclear power plants it has built has been
done in strict conformance with applicable codes and is designed
to provide substantial safety margins for equipment subject to
severe stress.
At Southern California Edison Co., operator of San Onofre,
quality assurance manager Jarlath Curran said a review of
Kent's charges about welding work there has not revealed any
deficiencies in Bechtel's design or procedures.

SF gun ban ruled unconstitutional
Sm Francisco — San Francisco's handgun ban, which would have out
lawed ownership of pistols except in a handful of cases, was ruled un
constitutional on yesterday by a state Court of Appeals.
The second such ban in the nation, San Francisco's ordinance was ap
proved in June by the Board of Supervisors, but was not scheduled to take
effect until October 27. Morton Grove, 111., was the first community to ban
handguns, and its law was upheld in federal court.
The ordinance had broad support from Mayor Dianne Feinstein and a
variety of city officials. But the three-judge panel agreed with opponents, rul
ing that only the state Legislature has the power to make laws concerning the
possession or ownership of handguns.
"Obviously, I am very sad," said Feinstein. "But it is not the end of the
battle. It is only a ruling and it can be appealed.
The mayor, who said handguns kilt 23,000 people a year in the United
States, said she hadn't read the decision or discussed it with city attorneys to
determine whether to appeal to the state Supreme Court.
"We're delighted with it," said Jerry Hallisey, an attorney for the plain
tiffs. "It's consistent with prior decisions by the courts...
The judges said they were "sensitive to the political and social
overtones of a case such as this..." But they added that they
were concerned "only with the narrow legal question of whether
the state Constitution and state statutes permit San Francisco to
enact such an ordinance. We conclude that they do not."
The court told San Francisco officials not to enforce the hand
gun ordinance and to advise residents that it won't be enforced.
The ordinance made it a misdemeanor for anyone to possess a
handgun in San Francisco. The maximum penalty was a 30-day
jail term and $500 fine.
About 100 handguns have been turned in, police said. The
mayor recently presented Pope John Paul II with a cross made
from some 15 melted-down handguns, including one of her own.
Peace officers, members of the military on duty, people using
licensed target ranges, certain licensed collectors, certain
licensed guards and special peace officers were exempt. Also ex
empt were people with permits to carry concealed weapons and
those authorized to sell handguns.
The issue will be on the state ballot on Nov. 2 as Proposition
15. That initiative would require handgun owners to register
their weapons with the state Department of Justice no later than
Nov. 2, 1983, and also would make it a misdemeanor to buy, sell
or transfer an unregistered handgun.
Stock market rockets again
New York — The stock market resumed its powerful rally yes
terday, propelling the Dow Jones industrials average to a 17-
month high in the second-busiest trading day in New York Stock
Exchange history.
Energy issues led the buying binge in the fifth straight day in
which more than 100 million shares changed hands on the Big
Board.
More than three stocks rose in price for every one that fell on
the NYSE, with 417 issues rising to 52-week highs while just
three fell to new lows.
The Dow Jones average of 30 industrial stocks, which fell 9.11
points Tuesday, shot up 11.40 points to end the day at 1015.08. It
had been even higher at midafternoon, when the blue-chip aver
age was up more than 23 points.
The advance was a sharp reversal from the 5.52 point-decline
in the opening 30 minutes of activity and was the highest finish
since the average stood at 1016.93 on Apr. 28,1981.
Over the last two months, the widely followed average has
rocketed 238.16 points, or by 30.7 percent.
Big Board volume totaled 139.80 million shares, up from
126.36 million Tuesday and second only to last Thursday's
147.07 million. Nationwide turnover in NYSE-listed issues, in
cluding trades in those stocks on regional exchanges and in the
over-the-counter market, totaled 159.24 million shares.
Energy issues dominated the active list on the NYSE.
Reagan: 4 America is recovery-bound'
Washington — Addressing the nation 20 days before the elec
tions, President Reagan said yesterday that "America is re
covery-bound" despite a "pounding economic hangover" and
unemployment which "has not yet stopped its upward drift."
In a nationally televised Oval Office speech that he maintained
was nonpartisan, but which clearly had political overtones, Rea
gan defended his economic policies, now under attack by Demo
crats, and concluded with his basic campaign theme: America's
economy can only become healthy again "by staying the
course."
"The pounding economic hangover America is suffering from
didn't come about overnight, and there is no single, instant
cure," the president said in his approximately 20-minute address.
"In recent weeks, a lot of people have been playing what I call the
'blame game.' The accusing finger has been pointed in every
direction of the compass and a lot of time and hot air have been
spent looking for scapegoats."
Yet Reagan has increasingly blamed former President Jimmy
Carter's administration for the recession.
While proudly pointing to reductions in inflation and interest
rates since he took office, Reagan acknowledged that "un
employment, always a lagging (economic) indicator in time of re
cession, has not yet stopped its upward drift." He said it hangs
like a "dark cloud" over the 11.3 million jobless, representing
10.1 percent of the work force.
The Democratic party was furious at the two major television
networks, NBC and CBS, that carried the president's speech live.
Democratic National Chairman Charles Manatt said that
NBC and CBS displayed "questionable judgment" in granting
Reagan free television time to repeat what he said was essentially
the campaign speech the president has been making across the
country.
The Democratic chairman said that since Reagan took office,

unemployment had climbed 44 percent, bankruptcies had gone
up 46.7 percent and mortgage foreclosures had increased 41 per
cent.
Dark horses share Nobel honors

Fighting spreads southeast of Beirut
Beirut — Heavy fighting between Moslem and Christian
militiamen spread yesterday through the mountains southeast of
Beirut, threatening to upset the relative peace the capital area has
been enjoying since the arrival of the multinational peace-keep
ing force late last month.
Despite pledges from both the Lebanese and Israeli govern
ments to step in and halt the escalating violence, neither had suc
ceeded by nightfall in bringing it to an end.

Steady shelling by Christian militiamen of Moslem Druze vil
lages continued throughout the day, and at one point late y cs * er *
day afternoon two Israeli armored personnel carriers loaded
with troops found themselves coming under the fire of their own
Lebanese Christian allies.
The fighting appeared to be shaping up as a serious challenge
to the 4-week-old government of President Amin Gemayel,
whose control over his own party's militia, held largely respon
sible for the flare up, is thought to be tenuous.
Lebanese army troops appeared to ignore the fighting and in
stead resumed their sweeps through the southern suburbs of
West Beirut yesterday for weapons and illegal aliens. The
searches began Oct. 5 in the largely Moslem western part of the
city but, despite government promises, they so far have not taken
place in Christian East Beirut.
(The Unified Command of the Lebanese Forces, a grouping of
Christian militias nominally under the command of Gemayel,
yesterday notified the government that it would refuse to con
sider turning its weapons over to the Lebanese army, the leftist
daily A 1 Safir reported.)
Engine problems may set back launch
Cape Canaveral — Problems with the space shuttle
Challenger's three main engines may delay a tentative Jan. 20
maiden launch of the second craft in the four-shuttle fleet, ac
cording to space agency officials.
That sixth mission, with an advanced tracking satellite as its
cargo, could be pushed back as much as a week, said James
Kukowski, a National Aeronautics and Space Administration
spokesman in Washington.
A Jan. 20 launch "is still conjecture," Kukowski said Tuesday.
"We're aiming for it, but it's going to be tight."
A pressure leak in one of Challenger's three main engines has
delayed their delivery from the National Space Technology Labs
in Mississippi to Kennedy Space Center, where Challenger is
being prepared for flight.
The three Rockwell International engines, which were sched
uled to arrive in Florida late last month, must go through a bat
tery of tests before becoming certified for installation in the or
biter.
"During some of the calibration tests, we were not satisfied
and we did it again," said Kukowski.
So far, two engines have been certified after a 500-second test
firing. They should be delivered to the space center by Nov. 22 or
23, spokesman Mark Hess said Tuesday.
Agency investigates nuclear safeguards
The Nuclear Regulatory Commission is looking into charges
that substandard welds were approved in construction of critical
safety systems at two of the nation's nuclear power plants, in
cluding San Onofre, the Los Angeles Times has learned.
The NRC has launched a full-scale probe of welding practices
at the Midland, Mich., facility and has scheduled a formal in
spection at San Onofre. Both plants were designed and built by
Bechtel Power Corp.
The commission's actions are in response to charges made by
E. Earl Kent, a former Bechtel quality control engineer, who was
fired by the company in March.
Kent told the Times that unless Bechtel corrects "thousands"
of substandard welds on pipe and electrical system supports at
the two plants a breakdown of cooling-water and radioactive wa
ter pipe systems could result.
Kent described the pipe supports as critical because they are
used to suspend piping and electrical conduits. If they fail, he
said, the pipes and conduits could sag and break. Such weak
nesses threaten the systems that cool the reactor and carry radio
active water in a closed loop within the containment building.
He said he was not offering a prediction but rather a "proba
bility" which he arrived at based on 40 years of experience in
welding, including 17 years as a welding and quality control engi
neer.
Bechtel officials denied Kent's charges. The firm maintained
that all welding work in nuclear power plants it has built has been
done in strict conformance with applicable codes and is designed
to provide substantial safety margins for equipment subject to
severe stress.
At Southern California Edison Co., operator of San Onofre,
quality assurance manager Jarlath Curran said a review of
Kent's charges about welding work there has not revealed any
deficiencies in Bechtel's design or procedures.

SF gun ban ruled unconstitutional
Sm Francisco — San Francisco's handgun ban, which would have out
lawed ownership of pistols except in a handful of cases, was ruled un
constitutional on yesterday by a state Court of Appeals.
The second such ban in the nation, San Francisco's ordinance was ap
proved in June by the Board of Supervisors, but was not scheduled to take
effect until October 27. Morton Grove, 111., was the first community to ban
handguns, and its law was upheld in federal court.
The ordinance had broad support from Mayor Dianne Feinstein and a
variety of city officials. But the three-judge panel agreed with opponents, rul
ing that only the state Legislature has the power to make laws concerning the
possession or ownership of handguns.
"Obviously, I am very sad," said Feinstein. "But it is not the end of the
battle. It is only a ruling and it can be appealed.
The mayor, who said handguns kilt 23,000 people a year in the United
States, said she hadn't read the decision or discussed it with city attorneys to
determine whether to appeal to the state Supreme Court.
"We're delighted with it," said Jerry Hallisey, an attorney for the plain
tiffs. "It's consistent with prior decisions by the courts...
The judges said they were "sensitive to the political and social
overtones of a case such as this..." But they added that they
were concerned "only with the narrow legal question of whether
the state Constitution and state statutes permit San Francisco to
enact such an ordinance. We conclude that they do not."
The court told San Francisco officials not to enforce the hand
gun ordinance and to advise residents that it won't be enforced.
The ordinance made it a misdemeanor for anyone to possess a
handgun in San Francisco. The maximum penalty was a 30-day
jail term and $500 fine.
About 100 handguns have been turned in, police said. The
mayor recently presented Pope John Paul II with a cross made
from some 15 melted-down handguns, including one of her own.
Peace officers, members of the military on duty, people using
licensed target ranges, certain licensed collectors, certain
licensed guards and special peace officers were exempt. Also ex
empt were people with permits to carry concealed weapons and
those authorized to sell handguns.
The issue will be on the state ballot on Nov. 2 as Proposition
15. That initiative would require handgun owners to register
their weapons with the state Department of Justice no later than
Nov. 2, 1983, and also would make it a misdemeanor to buy, sell
or transfer an unregistered handgun.
Stock market rockets again
New York — The stock market resumed its powerful rally yes
terday, propelling the Dow Jones industrials average to a 17-
month high in the second-busiest trading day in New York Stock
Exchange history.
Energy issues led the buying binge in the fifth straight day in
which more than 100 million shares changed hands on the Big
Board.
More than three stocks rose in price for every one that fell on
the NYSE, with 417 issues rising to 52-week highs while just
three fell to new lows.
The Dow Jones average of 30 industrial stocks, which fell 9.11
points Tuesday, shot up 11.40 points to end the day at 1015.08. It
had been even higher at midafternoon, when the blue-chip aver
age was up more than 23 points.
The advance was a sharp reversal from the 5.52 point-decline
in the opening 30 minutes of activity and was the highest finish
since the average stood at 1016.93 on Apr. 28,1981.
Over the last two months, the widely followed average has
rocketed 238.16 points, or by 30.7 percent.
Big Board volume totaled 139.80 million shares, up from
126.36 million Tuesday and second only to last Thursday's
147.07 million. Nationwide turnover in NYSE-listed issues, in
cluding trades in those stocks on regional exchanges and in the
over-the-counter market, totaled 159.24 million shares.
Energy issues dominated the active list on the NYSE.
Reagan: 4 America is recovery-bound'
Washington — Addressing the nation 20 days before the elec
tions, President Reagan said yesterday that "America is re
covery-bound" despite a "pounding economic hangover" and
unemployment which "has not yet stopped its upward drift."
In a nationally televised Oval Office speech that he maintained
was nonpartisan, but which clearly had political overtones, Rea
gan defended his economic policies, now under attack by Demo
crats, and concluded with his basic campaign theme: America's
economy can only become healthy again "by staying the
course."
"The pounding economic hangover America is suffering from
didn't come about overnight, and there is no single, instant
cure," the president said in his approximately 20-minute address.
"In recent weeks, a lot of people have been playing what I call the
'blame game.' The accusing finger has been pointed in every
direction of the compass and a lot of time and hot air have been
spent looking for scapegoats."
Yet Reagan has increasingly blamed former President Jimmy
Carter's administration for the recession.
While proudly pointing to reductions in inflation and interest
rates since he took office, Reagan acknowledged that "un
employment, always a lagging (economic) indicator in time of re
cession, has not yet stopped its upward drift." He said it hangs
like a "dark cloud" over the 11.3 million jobless, representing
10.1 percent of the work force.
The Democratic party was furious at the two major television
networks, NBC and CBS, that carried the president's speech live.
Democratic National Chairman Charles Manatt said that
NBC and CBS displayed "questionable judgment" in granting
Reagan free television time to repeat what he said was essentially
the campaign speech the president has been making across the
country.
The Democratic chairman said that since Reagan took office,

unemployment had climbed 44 percent, bankruptcies had gone
up 46.7 percent and mortgage foreclosures had increased 41 per
cent.
Dark horses share Nobel honors
Oslo, Norway — The 1982 Nobel Peace Prize was awarded
jointly yesterday to Alfonso Garcia Robles of Mexico and Alva
Myrdal of Sweden for their work toward world disarmament in
the past two decades.
Garcia Robles, a career diplomat and onetime foreign min
ister of Mexico, was the father of the 1967 Tlatelolco Agreement
that has been adhered to by almost every state in the Southern
Hemisphere and declares Latin America to be a nuclear-free
zone. He has served for years as his country's delegate to the
U.N. Disarmament Committee in Geneva and at special U.N.
disarmament assemblies, and is the first Mexican to win a Nobel
Prize.
Myrdal, 80, has spent a lifetime in national and international
politics, teaching and writing on social and economic problems.
From 1962 until her retirement she made disarmament her spe
cial concern as a Swedish Cabinet minister, as her country's rep
resentative in Geneva and then with a broad government man
date as a kind of roving disarmament ambassador.
She is the wife of Gunnar Mydral, who won the Nobel Prize in
economics in 1974.
The formal award of the peace prizes will take place in Oslo on
Dec. 10, the anniversary of the birth of Alfred Nobel, the inven
tor of dynamite who established international prizes for peace,
literature and sciences in his will in 1896. The first peace prize
was awarded in 1901, and the 1982 prize will amount to $157,000
to be divided between the two laureates.
The Nobel Committee is understood to have sifted about 80
nominations this year.
Nominations can be made by a wide variety of private individ
uals including members of all national legislatures belonging to
the interparliamentary union, all university professors of law,
history or philosophy, or previous prize winners.
Polish army forces end to strike
Gdansk, Poland — Threatened with military discipline and
backed only half-heartedly by underground Solidarity leaders of
the region, workers at the Lenin Shipyard here yesterday aban
doned a strike begun two days earlier to protest dissolution of the
independent trade union movement.
Massive security forces managed to impose a tense order on
the city after two days of street clashes officially estimated to
have caused more that $40,000 in damages.
However, demonstrations broke out in two other cities yester
day.
When first-shift workers at the Lenin Shipyard arrived for
work yesterday morning they were handed a militarization no
tice informing them that they had been conscripted and that any
one organizing a protest or engaging in any other anti-govern
ment actions would be subject to a prison term of up to five years.
Workers were issued new passes, each with a conscription
number, and navy officers took up stations in each department.
The text of the militarization order, which was announced Tues
day night, was repeatedly broadcast over the shipyard
loudspeaker, as was notice that all vacations had been canceled.
Police used tear gas to disperse several thousand workers who
were attempting to march from the giant Lenin steel mill in
Nowa Huta to a nearby church in the Krakow suburb.
In Wroclaw, eyewitnesses said that about 20 police vehicles,
including water cannons, were used to break up a crowd of sever
al hundred demonstrators near a tram depot.
The disturbunces in Nowa Huta and Wroclaw were the first
indications that the protest begun Monday was spreading from
the northern shipyards where Solidarity was born.
But the support appears to come to late for the Gdansk
strikers.
Shipyard commandant Stanislaw Zaczek ordered an
"absolute," on the dissemination of information without his
written permission and warned that instructions issued by any
superior must be obeyed just like a military order. There would
be no appeals against any directive, he said.

Kent told the Times that unless Bechtel corrects "thousands"
of substandard welds on pipe and electrical system supports at
the two plants a breakdown of cooling-water and radioactive wa
ter pipe systems could result.
Kent described the pipe supports as critical because they are
used to suspend piping and electrical conduits. If they fail, he
said, the pipes and conduits could sag and break. Such weak
nesses threaten the systems that cool the reactor and carry radio
active water in a closed loop within the containment building.
He said he was not offering a prediction but rather a "proba
bility" which he arrived at based on 40 years of experience in
welding, including 17 years as a welding and quality control engi
neer.
Bechtel officials denied Kent's charges. The firm maintained
that all welding work in nuclear power plants it has built has been
done in strict conformance with applicable codes and is designed
to provide substantial safety margins for equipment subject to
severe stress.
At Southern California Edison Co., operator of San Onofre,
quality assurance manager Jarlath Curran said a review of
Kent's charges about welding work there has not revealed any
deficiencies in Bechtel's design or procedures.
