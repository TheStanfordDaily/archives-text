# Congressman questions research cost allocations
## 
### MIKE HALE Senior staff writer 
An lowa congressman has charged
that Stanford made "erroneous claims"
for indirect research cost reimburse
ments in 1978, and that the government
must monitor expenditures more close
ly at all universities that do federally
sponsored research.
Democratic Rep. Berkley Bedell's
Sept. 13, widely publicized letter to
Richard Kusserow, inspector general of
the federal Department of Health and
Human Services, was the latest salvo in
the ongoing battle over indirect cost re
covery for research; these funds repre
sent the second largest source of funds
for the University's operating budget.
In it, he alleged that the University in
correctly sought government reim
bursement for publication of the Stan
ford Magazine, operation of Tresidder
Union, and depreciation on improve
ments to the golf course's irrigation sys
tem.
A University reply to the Bedell letter
is currently being drafted.
Indirect cost recovery is a system
whereby universities are reimbursed for
costs that make research possible, but
cannot be assigned to a particular re
search project, such as libraries, admin
istrative costs, maintenance and depre
ciation on buildings and equipment.
Every two years an "indirect cost re
covery rate" is negotiated between the
University and the government; this
rate, which expresses total indirect costs
as a percentage of total direct costs, is
applied as a surcharge to every federally
sponsored contract and grant awarded
Stanford researchers. During the
1982-83 and 1983-84 academic years, an
amount equal to 69 percent of every
federal research grant to the University
I vitcut Aio
celerator Center) will be paid by gov
ernment agencies into the University's
general fund; last year, when the rate
was 58 percent, these payments totaled
between $35 million and $40 million.
Every time a new rate is negotiated,
the University's indirect cost alloca
tions are audited by the Defense Con
tract Audit Agency, one of two agencies
(the other is HHS) which audit univer
sity research costs nationwide. The bill
ings cited in Bedell's letter were presum
ably taken from the 1978 DCAA audit
of Stanford's allocations.
Frank Riddle, University associate
controller, told the Daily determining
indirect costs means "taking the Uni
versity apart financially and putting it
back together according to government
guidelines." He accounted for the items
in the Bedell letter as follows:

• Stanford Magazine — the magazine
is included under support for the Office
of Public Affairs; it appeared in the
audit because an error was made in the
amount of salaries and the wagebase to
talling $1100.
• Tresidder — the University con
siders the second-floor meeting rooms
at Tresidder a legitimate expense, be
cause they are used for University meet
ings. This appeared in the audit because
of a disagreement over the cost fraction
the rooms represent.
• Golf course irrigation system im
provements — these were included with
other improvements due to a screening
error; the amount involved was $538.
The University concurred in the audit
finding.
Riddle emphasized that the amounts
involved were, as far as the University is
concerned, tiny, compared to the 540
million indirect cost budget.
Mark Levine, a staff aide to Bedell,
said Bedell assumes the audit items
were "honest mistakes" on the Univer
sity's part. Bedell's letter was prompted
by Office of Management and Budget
proposals to relieve the government of
the costs of auditing by having schools
hire private firms to audit their indirect
cost allocations. Levine asked, "What
would be the incentive for the Univer
sity's auditors to catch" items like those
that turned up in the government audit.
He said Bedell feared a system in which
college administrators hold total con
trol over indirect cost reimbursements.
The letter also claimed that Stanford
had not submitted the paperwork re
quired for an after-the-fact audit of its
1980 indirect costs to be performed. Ac
cording to Riddle, the University sub
mitted the papers last year but the audit
ham not yet been performed.

continual, "five-day-a-week" govern
ment auditing. The DCAA maintains a
sub-office on campus because of the
volume of research done here.
Gerald Lieberman, vice provost and
dean of graduate studies and research,
said that while there are people who fa
vor auditing being done by the "big 10"
private accounting firms, he feels this
wouldn't be a good move on the gov
ernment's part.
In a related matter, University Presi
dent Donald Kennedy told the Faculty
Senate Sept. 30 that it appears the Na
tional Institutes of Health will not go
through with a proposed 10 percent cut
in their indirect cost reimbursements
for all fiscal 1983 contracts and grants.
This would have cost Stanford $2.2 mil
lion during the 1982-83 academic year.
