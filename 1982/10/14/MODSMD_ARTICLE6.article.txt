# Personal and corporate gifts boost University funds

In response to increased economic pressures and
an unpredictable investing environment, the need to
market Stanford as an attractive product has be
come central to fundraising efforts, according to
Dave Fulton, deputy to the vice president for de
velopment and director of development com
munications.
"Tuition and overhead recovery from grants and
contracts supply only a part of Stanford's funds," he
explained. "In these difficult economic times, our
office has seen the need to market Stanford as ag
gressively as possible." These attempts have met
with success as the Office of Development raised
nearly $77 million in donations, second only to the
all-time high 0f579.5 million in 1980-81.
"It was a good year," said Fulton. "We started
out the fiscal year running scared, but were pleased
with the final resultsoflast year's efforts." Headded
that Stanford, which normally finishes second be
hind Harvard, was edged out by Yale last year.
Harvard managed to secure more than $ 150 million
in donations.

Fulton said that his fears at the beginning of the
year stemmed from two sources. The first, he said,
concerned changes in the tax laws which made the
giving of gifts bv living individuals less desirable.
Under the new tax structure, tax rates were lowered
for those in higher income brackets, which made the
giving of gifts to the University less tax-attractive.
"This is the first year we have operated after the
new law," explained Fulton. "We were afraid that
this would discourage personal donations and there
fore hinder our efforts." In actuality, though, the
number of individual gifts of $25,000 and over in
creased over the vear, the amount of donations de
clined from $19.4 million to $11.3 million.
"Other universities have also reported the same
experience," added Fulton. "This means that more
people are giving, but simply in smaller amounts."
The other concern was the state of the economy,
especially the unpredictabilityof the stock market.
"Appreciated securities account for a lot of our
large gifts," said Fulton. "The amount of these we
receive depends on how well the stock market is
doing, and last year, with the economy in the shape
it was in, no one was would happen." As

feared, the amount of large donations were "few and
and far between."
In spite of these early concerns, the Office of De
velopment managed to raise nearly $77 million from
each of its four major sources: living individuals, the
Stanford Annual Fund, trusts and bequests, and
gifts from corporations and foundations. Corporate
giving showed the greatest strength last year with
gifts totaling more than $23 million, up from $15.5
million in 1980-81.
"Corporations are coming to a greater realization
that supporting higher education is in their own in
terest." explained Fulton. "Corporations rely on
high technology reseach and such knowledge can
only be generated within the university context. It
makes sense, therefore, to give. They are, in essence,
investing in their own future."
Concern that such gifts may lead to political in
fluence, is, according to Fulton, unwarranted: "For
anv corporate gift to be accepted, the University
must be given a certain degree of latitude in terms of
where to apply it." He added that both the president
and the provost remain interested in the current
