## Election focus: unemployment, economic woes Jobless rate hits hard, fuels campaign issues

Compiled from news reports and wire ser

Rising three-tenths of a per
centage point, the September un
employment rate hit a double
digit 10.1 percent, the highest
monthly unemployment figure
since the end of the Great De
pression in 1940.
Although the jump was not a
huge one, it was the first time
since the Depression that un
emplovement figures had hit
double-digits.
A survey of 60,000 households
by the Bureau of Labor Statistics
showed an increase of 450,000
unemployed members of the ci
vilian labor force since August,
and more than three million in
the last 12 months. Since Presi
dent Reagan took office in Jan.,
1981, 3.3 million more Ameri
cans are out of work. Figures
show 11.3 million people out of
work. 1
The decline of heavy industries
such as auto and construction
have especially hurt other in
dustries that are dependent on
them. Thus, much of the un
employment rate reflects the de
cline of steel and other primary
metals.
As the last report before the
midterm congressional elections
on Nov. 2, these high figures will
have political significance as
Democrats who had predicted
picking up IS to 20 seats now be
lieve they may gain even more.
Already the bad news of a con
tinually faltering economy has
prompted Republicans and
Democrats to blame each other.
Reagan has warned the Demo
crats not to make a "political
football" out of the unemploy
ment issue. He cited the recent
declines in inflation and interest
rates as indicative of a slow but
sure turnaround. The top priori
ty now, he added, would be to
"create more jobs."

At a news conference earlier
this week, Treasury Secretary
Donald Regan said that the Ad
ministration would continue its
economic program despite the
rising unemployment. The eco
nomic assumption in operation
here is that with inflation under
control and interest rates low
ered, the economy expands and
unemployment rates will respond
by coming down.
The Democrats assailed the
Administration's policies, accus
ing Reagan of promoting un
employment to lessen the infla
tion rate.
They charged that the 10.1 per
cent unemployment was too high
a price to pay for the drop in in
flation, and noted that
bankruptcy rates were the
highest in half a century in half a
century.
Reagan retaliated by blaming
the Democratic Congress for its
economically unwise tax-and
spend politics, as well as previous
Democratic administrations
which "created the worst eco
nomic mess since the days of
Franklin Roosevelt."
During a campaign speech in
Virginia, Reagan outlined the
election as a choice of "whether
we will continue our sure and
steady course to put America
back on track or whether we will
slide backward into another eco
nomic binge like the one which
left us with today's pounding na
tional hangover."
Bipartisan clashes apart, the
unresponsive economy will nev
ertheless remain a prominent is
sue for both the upcoming con
gressional elections and the next
presidential elections. For now,
high unemployment figures
make both sides nervous and
combative.
