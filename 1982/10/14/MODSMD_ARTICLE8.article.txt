# Fed, banks cut loan rates

Compiled from news reports and wire services
Four banks cut their prime lending rates a full
point Tuesday in response to a drop in loan rates to
banks made by the Federal Reserve Board last Fri
day.
The Fed lowered the interest rate from 10 percent
to 9.5 percent. The announcement created a stock
market surge that continued through the beginning
of this week but has since leveled off.
Morgan Guaranty Trust Company of New York
led the way in cutting the prime rate to 12 percent
from 13 percent. Bank of America, Manufacturers
Hanover Trust and Chemical Bank followed suit.
The prime rate last stood at 12 percent on Sept. 12,
1980, a time when it had started to rise and was
climbing to a record 21.5 percent in Dec. 1980.
News of the reduction in the discount rate came
minutes after the Fed announced a $2.7 bllion drop
in the nation's money supply in the financial week
that ended Sept. 29. This means that a loan rate de
crease was necessary in order to encourage an in
crease in money supply.
The prime rate has a more direct effect on bor

rowers than the discount rate because banks use the
prime rate as the base for interest rates they charge
on most loans to medium and small businesses.
The rise and fall of loan rates is important be
cause economists indicate the course of the econo
my depends on the long-term rate of growth of the
money supply.
In view of the recent rate drop it seems the Fed is
paying less attention to the money supply and
greater attention to economic conditions. The re
cession and unemployment statistics have elicited
particularly, close examination. The focal shift
could mean that the Fed may allow a faster-paced
growth of the money supply in an effort geared at
further reducing interest rates and ultimately stimu
lating the economy.
The money supply consists of cash in public
hands and all check-like deposits in the banks and
savings institutions. By controlling the money supp
ly, the Fed controls the amount of money available
to consumers and businesses. Generally, the greater
the availabity of money the cheaper its price.
