# Slow growth ahead
## 
### 
Compiled from news reports and wire services
In light of a soaring stock market and lower interest rates, the heads
of many of the nations largest companies predicted a slow and
strained recovery of the 1983 economy.
The forecast was presented at a meeting of the Business Council in
New York last week, and was prepared by over 20 chief economists
from corporations such as AT & T, General Motors, Ford, United
Technologies, General Electric and Citicorp. They saw little hope for
improvements in unemployment or industry investment anytime
soon.
But the council agreed that inflation, which had been beaten back to
6.5 percent this year, will drop further to 6 percent in 1983. The per
centage for this year is less than half the level of last year.
Specifically, the economists saw a decline of 1.5 percent of the na
tion's total output of goods and services by the end of this year, rising
only to 3 percent next year. Similarly, the council predicted no signifi
cant recovery in investment of new factories and machinery, despite
the Reagan administration's tax policy.
New-car sales, housing construction and industrial production are
expected to grow somewhat, but not to levels reached before the re
cession began in July 1981. In other words, the forecast can hope for
only modest gains in the economy, despite recent promising signals.
Meanwhile a survey of 1000 business firms released by a man
agement consultant company projected an average 7.6 percent pay
hike for U.S. workers in 1983. This is lower than the 9.1 percent aver
age for 1982, but it is still enough to keep up with inflation.
Wage settlements will tend to be more erratic, with those employed
by manufacturing industries under tighter pressure to settle for less in
order to keep their jobs. This is due to the sluggish growth of heavy
industries. Service industry employees ranging from banking to fast
food franchises will experience little or no such pressure.
On the international market, gold shot up almost $30 an ounce in a
worldwide response to expected lower U.S. interest rates. The dollar
predictably declined against major currencies.
Lower interest rates stimilate gold purchases, particularly on credit.
Thus following the U.S. Federal Reserve's discount rate cut to 9.5 per
cent and the $2.7 billion decline in the basic money supply, the pres
sured dollar fell slightly against the West German mark, the Japanese
yen, the Canadian dollar and the British pound.
