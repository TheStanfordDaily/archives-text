The Bell System is now undergoing perhaps the most dramatic changes ever experienced
in the history of telecommunications! Pacific Telephone, in gearing up for these changes, is
now calling you into the 21st Century —into the incredible Information Age and our need
for dynamic, highly-motivated managers has never been greater.
Career opportunities exist in such categories as data processing, engineering, operations
and sales. Many of these entry level management positions are supervisory in nature: all are
results-oriented and designed to demonstrate potential for further advancement Our most
competitive candidates are those who have demonstrated superior scholastic achievement
(preferably in technical disciplines) as well as successful leadership experience.
For those who consider meeting challenges away of life, we also offer an excellent
manager-development program-a fast-paced, no-nonsense, high-risk high-reward program
designed for people who wouldn't have it any other way. Because this accelerated program
exists to enrich our middle and upper management source pools, we select only the most
competitive candidates: those who have sustained top quarter grades throughout college,
and who have demonstrated a substantial amount of leadership either on campus, in the
community or on a job.
In addition to exceptional career opportunities, we offer competitive salaries and an
outstanding benefits package.
At Pacific Telephone, the future is here. If you want to make it yours, attend our
Information Session on October 21, 1982, and then sign up for an on-campus interview on
Novwber 8, 1982, or leave your resume at the Career Planning and Placement Center.
