A STATEMENT FROM THE ATHLETIC DIRECTOR
Saving seats at football games in the student section of Stanford Stadium is not permitted.
AII students with tickets have priority on a first come, first served basis. If groups of students
wish to sit together, they should come to the game together.
This policy will be enforced at all remaining home games. I urge students to embrace this
policy with a constructive sensitivity to each other in this community.
As well, we are proud of the integrity of Stanford Athletics, and sincerely urge all members
of this community to sustain this reputation. We have noticed at other schools another style
of expression which we should avoid.
Throwing objects such as water balloons, vegetables, fruit, et al, from the stands cannot be
tolerated. This activity results in injury, anger-, and retaliation.
Enthusiasm is best expressed in support of our team, not through vituperative acts directed
at an opponent.
Signed: "fax
Andy Geiger
