# Injury suit judgment expected
## 
### BILL AINSWORTH 
An $lB million personal injury suit
brought against the University by a
gymnast who suffered a crippling acci
dent three years ago is expected to end
next week when closing arguments are
scheduled in a San Jose courtroom.
William Brodie Lockhard, 22, the
plaintiff in the case, was injured while
practicing on campus facilities and is
now a quadrapalegic as a result of the
broken neck he received in the 1979 ac
cident. Lockhard has since graduated
from Stanford in English and math-sci
ences and this quarter has begun a mas
ter's program in the School of Educa
tion.
Lockhard is able to work on com
puter programing through a special sys
tem controlled by his tongue. He re
quires around the clock nursing care
and is dependent on a ventilator to aid
in breathing.
According to Lockhard, the damages
he is asking for represent "enough mon
ey to lead a long and healthy life and to
try and make up for some of the things I
will miss."
Lockhard's attorneys, the well
known Melvin Belli and David Sabih,
are charging the University with negli
gence in constructing the foam pit

around the trampoline where the acci
dent occurred. According to Joyce
Sassey, a law-clerk for Sabih, they are
contending that the University is guilty
of "a lack of due care in constructing
the pit."
Meanwhile, the University's at
torney, Melvin Toff, is claiming that the
accident was due entirely to how
Lockhard landed when he fell, and not
to any inadeqaucey in the construction
of the foam pit afound the trampoline.
The pit was constructed by gym
nastics coach Sadao Hamada in two
days.
Lockhard, a member of the gym
nastics team who competed in all six
gym events, said he had been practicing
the Rudi, the move he was doing when
the accident took place, for two
months. He said the move consists of a
front flip and a one and a half twist.
"At the time of the accident I realized
I was going to land in a dangerous posi
tion and tried to correct for this," he
said.
The $lB million damage figure,
Sassey said, was arrived at with the help
of an economist retained by Belli's firm.
One of the factors used in computing
the damage charges, she said was the
$15,000 it costs each month to care for

Lockhard at home.
Sassey said that before the trial began
the two parties negotiated to settle the
case out of court. However, these nego
tiations have not continued during the
trial.
"The last offer the University made
was one week before the trial
began,"she said.
According to Lockhard's mother,
Dr. Dorothy Lockhard, care and hospi
talization costs in the three years since
the accident have so far totaled over
$550,000. She said that the insurance
used to pay these costs has now run out.
The elder Lockhard said that the
University has been very generous and
supportive since the accident occurred.
"We are really suing the insurance com
pany,"she said, even though the Uni
versity is officially the defendant in the
case.
"The whole community has been
supportive since the accident. He's
(William) been proud to be associated
with Stanford,"she added.
The trial, which finishes its fourth
week today, has involved the testimony
of numerous expert witnesses on both
sides as well as experts closer to the

Lockard, shown here both before and after (upper right
hand corner) his crippling accident, is suing the University
for $18 million in a case that is expected to be settled

next week. Lockard, who was injured in an accident dur
ing practice here, claims that both the University and his
coach were negligent in the set up of the practice area.
case. Videotapes, photographs, draw
ings and computers have all been in
troduced as evidence during the course
of the trial.
The University Counsel's Office is
contracting the case out to Toffs firm
because of an agreement reached by the
counsel and the insurance agency, ac

cording to University Counsel John
Schwartz. Schwartz said the practice of
contracting out was not an uncommon
one and that it was done partly because
the counsel was busy when the case
began. The counsel is monitoring trial
proceedings, he added.
Lockhard testified in the first week of
the trial but since then has been absent
from the proceedings because of the
emotional stress caused by it and be
cause he has had to attend classes here.
"It takes most of his energy to get to

class," said Dr. Lockhard, who added
that she also has stopped attending the
trial this week.
Since the accident, Lockhard said
that everything he does takes two or
three times longer than before. As a re
sult he has changed study habits.
Of adjusting to his new limitations,
Lockhard said, "I try to maintain a bal
ance between realism and hope. I've
tried to carry on as best as I can. I don't
sit around and hope for a miracle."
