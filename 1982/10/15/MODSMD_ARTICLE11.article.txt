# Harvest offers information fun
## 
### PEGGY WILLIAMS 
White Plaza never ceases to
be the bustling center of cam
pus: last week students
strayed from the bike lanes to
gather information at the Ca
reer Faire, and today Harvest
'B2 will showcase a myriad of
student and University or
ganizations.
Harvest, a fall festival spon
sored by the ASSU, Tres
idder and the Office of Stu
dent Activities, will provide
organizations a chance to re
cruit members and display in
formation from noon to mid
night today. An informa
tional faire with booths will
give student groups a unique
chance to attract the public
eye. The ASSU, OSA and
Tresidder will also host an
open house.
Underneath an immense

hot air balloon, close to 100
groups will be available to dis
cuss their programs and ser
vices. Faye Knox, assistant
dean of campus affairs and
OSA adviser is confident that
the faire will be "very repre
sentative of not only volun
tary student organizations but
also campus university de
partments as well."
Students will have an op
portunity to find out about a
variety of campus groups, in
cluding Stanford in Govern
ment, the Women's Center,
the Society of Black Scientists
and Engineers, Overseas
Studies, the Stanford Alpine
Club, the Stanford Rocket
Society and Jazz aerobics.
Freebies will undoubtedly
increase the attractiveness of
the event for some students.
Free bowling will be offered at

the recreation center from
4 p.m. to 7 p.m., fro-yo
will be distributed at the Cor
ner pocket, and tickets offer
ing a chance to win prizes in
an evening raffle will be avail
able at the ASSU offices.
Initially coined "Orien
tivities," the annual festivity
started back in 1975, and
"from year to year it's gotten
bigger and bigger," said
Yolanda Townsend, a mem
ber of the council of presi
dents. In fact, during most re
cent years many outside busi
nesses found Harvest op
portune for virtually free ad
vertisement.
"They really overshadowed
what Stanford had to offer,"
she added. Consequently, this
year's activities are restricted
to organizations on campus.
