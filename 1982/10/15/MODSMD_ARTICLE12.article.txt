## Recycling's financing options 
### 
The recent financial difficulties experienced by
the ASSU Recycling Project have been primarily
caused by a recession-induced drop in the prices of
many of the project's leading recyclable materials
over an 18-month period. They do not, as some
have suggested, reflect mismanagement or an in
herent problem with recycling as a break-even op
eration . For this reason we feel that talk about shut
ting down the project based on these losses is hasty.
Even if the recent losses pointed to a short term
problem with running a recycling operation at a
break-even level, these losses would still have to be
measured against the long-run gains associated
with recycling. Nowhere are these gains more ap
parent than in Palo Alto, where it has been pre
dicted that the city dump which Stanford uses to
deposit its waste will run out of space within 10
years. The space constraints of the dump make it
even more necessary to reduce through conserva
tion and other means the thousands of tons that city
and campus residents throw away every day. How
ever, examples like this should not be necessary to
make us realize that the natural resources we use ev
ery day are not limitless. For too long society has
proceeded under the misconception that its re
sources are infinite and while this attitude may not
affect the current generation, it will create grave
and unnecessary problems for future generations.
Last year the recycling project carted off 700 tons
of waste which the University would have other
wise had to transport to the Palo Alto city dump.
For this service it received no payment from the
University, which argued that the 700 tons, if it
were added to the waste already being deposited at
the dump, would not increase the dumping fees be
cause of the method employed to determine these
fees. While this may be a valid argument, it seems
that if it were the case the University would need to
examine seriously the methods being used to figure
out its waste disposal charges.
To minimize the projected losses for the project
this year, its management needs to take as many
steps as possible to increase its efficiency without

cutting back on services. One such measure â€”.
dropping the collection of mixed papers from the
dorms, thereby reducing labor costs associated
with the sorting necessary for this collection has
already been implemented. Another action that
should be considered, if it does reduce costs, is the
reduction or the elimination of the automatic an
swering service currently in use at the project's
headquarters.
Because the project services the University and
does not receive any compensation for this service
its present losses are exaggerated because they do
not fully reflect the project's true economic benefit.
This situation should be corrected by a University
subsidy of the project at least equal to the amount
that the project saves the University in waste dis
posal costs. And if the dumping costs charged to the
University do not reflect this savings they should be
changed as soon as possible. There may be a case
for a subsidy to the project at a level greater than
the savings it provides for the University, because
of the University's own long- term interest in pro
moting recycling to keep down the cost of future
dumping fees.
While a University subsidy may help make up
some of the losses accumulated by the project, it
may not be enough to make the project financially
viable. For this reason, other forms of funding,
such as government and private grants, should be
examined. Many recycling centers across the nation
do receive such subsidies because of their long-term
benefits.
If the recycling project's losses can not be greatly
reduced by University and outside sources of fund
ing, the issue needs to be brought in front of the stu
dents in the form of a fee assessment. This would
give the students the ultimate choice of whether the
project is worthwhile enough to be subsidized. But
before these funding options have been explored
and the broader impact of the recycling project has
been considered, any talk of closing the project
should be dismissed as premature.
