## Pro-gun claims based on fallacy 
### 
Joyce Lucas Clark's article "Gun Control Denies Civil
Liberties" (Daily, Oct. 7), is riddled with the kind of con
stitutional misinterpretations and practical fallacies that
pervade the arguments of the pro-gun advocates. Clark ap
parently bases her opposition to hand gun controls on two
grounds: a constitutional claim and a practical argument.
Neither stands up under close scrutiny.
The first claim is that the Second Amendment guarantees
individuals the right to own handguns. That claim
is absolutely untrue. It is a complete fallacy, and the courts
have always said so. The Second Amendment says: A well
regulated militia being necessary to the security of a free State
, the right of the people to keep and bear arms shall not be
infringed." It is easy to distort the meaning of this sentence
bv dropping out the first part, as the National Rife Associa
tion is fond of doing, but it is one sentence and it means one
thing: the federal government may not prohibit the states
from maintaining a "well-regulated militia." This hardly
creates a personal right to own a handgun. Still, Clark claims
that this cannot be, that the Second Amendment protects in
dividuals, not the states. If it protected the states, she says,
then it "would be restricting the states from restricting them
selves," which wouldn't make any sense. On the contrary, it
is her argument which makes no sense, because the Bill of
Rights was not passed to restrict the states, but to restrict the
federal government. The Second Amendment therefore pro
tects a right of the states against federal infringement, not a
right of the individual against state infringement. In any
event, the amendment is completely obsolete now, since all
the states, without exception, have abolished "peoples
militias" in favor of professional police forces. The pro-gun
lobby is attempting to resurrect the Second Amendment by
twisting it around to mean something it was never meant to.
Clark goes on to state her fear that gun-control laws
would lead to violations of other liberties, such as the search

and-seizure guarantee of the Fourth Amendment. But there
is no logical basis for such a fear. Passing a gun-control law
would not give the government the power to use Gestapo
like techniques to enforce it. As with all other laws, it would
have to be enforced in a lawful manner, according to the
safeguards of the Constitution. The fact that so many arrests
for illegal gun ownership in Detroit were thrown out for con
stitutional violations, as Clark mentions, testifies to the
strength of those guarantees, not their weakness.
Finally, Clark repeats the most pathetic fallacy of the pro
gun people: the notion that owning a gun will shield them
against crime or injury. Ask almost any police department if
this is so, and they will say "Good grief, no!" Cold, hard
statistics show that a gun in a private home is not likely to
harm anyone except a member of the family, usually in a
tragic accidental shooting by another family member. There
are almost no recorded cases of a private person coming out
ahead in a robbery situation (by far the most common home
crime) solely by reason of possessing a hand gun. Far more
often, in such situations, family members or innocent per
sons have been accidentally shot. Depicting crime as a kind
of one-on-one personal combat, in which the victim must be
armed to protect against the criminal, is a romantic and dan
gerous illusion. Police protection may be far from perfect,
but some well-made locks and the police phone number
posted on the wall will do a lot more good than encouraging
untrained private citizens to attempt to use deadly weapons
against serious and determined criminals.
In conclusion, I fail to understand Clark's concern for the
"civil liberty" of owning a hand gun. I value my freedom of
speech and my right to a fair trial, but I would never value
the "right," even if I possessed it, of owning and using a
deadly weapon.
