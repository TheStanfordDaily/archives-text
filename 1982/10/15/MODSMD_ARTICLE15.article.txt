## Extremists simplify nuclear debate 
### 
Articles which appeared in the Daily
last week commenting on the nuclear
weapons freeze did a remarkable job of
crystallizing a central characteristic of
the currently heated debate: both sides
are overcome by the urge to simplify,
and in doing so, lose sight of some cen
tral questions facing our nation as it
seeks to resolve the nuclear arms de
bate.
Kevin Gross' remarks (Daily, Oct. 4)
. reveal a strikingly unsophisticated
assessment of the U.S.-Soviet strategic
balance. I don't doubt Gross' sincerity;
I imagine the thought of a substantial

Soviet advantage in "missile power"
seems troubling. But as is so often the
case, statistics can be easily misleading.
To rehearse the mitigating facts and fig
ures regarding serviceability, accuracy,
diversity and targeting of U.S.
strategic forces in this brief article
would do the same disservice to a com
plex issue as did Gross. Suffice it to say
that a myriad of factors contribute to
the formation of a sound defense pos
ture. Most military and civilian leaders
in this country recognize that the Unit
ed States retains a very capable (albeit
not perfect) deterrent, far preferable to
present Soviet forces.
Gross' insinuations of Communist
links to the freeze movements are com
pletely unwarranted. Regardless of
one's political leanings, it seems fair to
conclude that the freeze is supported by
a large number of rather patriotic
Americans who are registering a protest
to the continuing arms race. The goal of
preventing a nuclear holocaust is, as far
as I can tell, not a reflection of a sub
versive political ideology.
Finally, contrary to Gross' conven
tion, arms control has nothing to do

with trust of the Soviet Union. Agree
ments are negotiated subject to each
side's ability to monitor independently
what the other side i§ doing. If we
trusted the Soviets, we wouldn't need
arms control.
Unfortunately, Shirish Date's rebut
tal (Daily, Oct. 6) was in many respects
equally simplistic and in some cases fac
tually incorrect. For starters, some
fourth-generation Soviet land-based
missiles are as accurate as the best
American systems. Perhaps what Date
was trying to explain was that in the
case of highly accurate nuclear weap
ons, throw weight has relatively little
significance.
Date concludes that the choice is
simple: nuclear freeze (followed by dis
armament) or oblivion. While the
freeze initiative is an admirable call by
the American people to halt the arms
race, it is by no means the only ap
proach to arms control and the preven
tion of nuclear war, nor is it simple. In
fact, it is apparent through an examina
tion of the recent history of arms con
trol negotiations that there are poten
tially serious flaws in a "freeze ap
proach."
SA LT demonstrated that the imposi
tion of weapons ceilings is a remarkably
time-consuming and painstaking task,
and perhaps not the most appropriate
goal for future arms control efforts. The
time spent in freeze negotiations trying
to construct an intricate web of restric
tions which will distinguish between
weapons of similar types that do and do
not carry nuclear bombs and it is not
at all clear that this can be ac
complished could be far better spent
first curtailing continual technological
advances and second, seeking to reduce
the risk of accidental nuclear war. The
completion of the Comprehensive Test
Ban Treaty, the ratification of SALT II
and the Threshold Test Ban Treaty, the
imposition of missile flight test quotas,
the strengthening the 1963 Hotline
agreement and the establishment of a
joint U.S.-Soviet crisis command center
are all realizable steps towards these
two important goals.
We are faced with an extraordinarily
dangerous situation. The United States
and the Soviet Union have between
them about 50,000 nuclear warheads,

any one of which could virtually ob
literate a city. Numbers have long since
stopped being the immediate problem.
Even if we first freeze and
drastically reduce the world's arsenals,
we would be faced with unprecedented
disaster if nuclear war were to erupt.
Perhaps then our first and foremost
task should be the prevention of the use
of nuclear weapons. It is at least worth
while to consider that freeze nego
tiations are not, as Date concludes, the
only choice for those favoring strategic
arms control.
The freeze movement has given arms
control what it has always needed in
this country a constituency. Because
of this, there is great potential for fruit
ful negotiations. The questions we now
face regarding the future shape of these
efforts have become all the more
critical. The reduction of international
security to a set of numbers, or the con

tention that there is only one solution to
the whole ball game, is less than helpful.
The nuclear arms race remains pet
haps the most baffling, complex issue of
our time. The prevention of a nuclear
holocaust will require unprecedented
synthesis of human imagination, in
genuity, commitment and knowledge.
We cannot afford to delude ourselves
into thinking that it's a simple problem,
repeat our old mistakes or become par
alyzed by unfounded fears of Soviet
domination conjured up by the manipu
lation of relatively unimportant
statistics.

only choice for those favoring strategic
arms control.
The freeze movement has given arms
control what it has always needed in
this country a constituency. Because
of this, there is great potential for fruit
ful negotiations. The questions we now
face regarding the future shape of these
efforts have become all the more
critical. The reduction of international
security to a set of numbers, or the con

tention that there is only one solution to
the whole ball game, is less than helpful.
The nuclear arms race remains pet
haps the most baffling, complex issue of
our time. The prevention of a nuclear
holocaust will require unprecedented
synthesis of human imagination, in
genuity, commitment and knowledge.
We cannot afford to delude ourselves
into thinking that it's a simple problem,
repeat our old mistakes or become par
alyzed by unfounded fears of Soviet
domination conjured up by the manipu
lation of relatively unimportant
statistics.

Regardless of one f s
political leanings, it
seems fair to conclude
that the freeze is
supported by a large
number of rather
patriotic Americans.

We are faced with an
extraordinarily
dangerous situation.
The United States
and the Soviet Union
have between them
about 50,000 nuclear
warheads, any one of
which could virtually
obliterate a city.
Articles which appeared in the Daily
last week commenting on the nuclear
weapons freeze did a remarkable job of
crystallizing a central characteristic of
the currently heated debate: both sides
are overcome by the urge to simplify,
and in doing so, lose sight of some cen
tral questions facing our nation as it
seeks to resolve the nuclear arms de
bate.
Kevin Gross' remarks (Daily, Oct. 4)
. reveal a strikingly unsophisticated
assessment of the U.S.-Soviet strategic
balance. I don't doubt Gross' sincerity;
I imagine the thought of a substantial

Soviet advantage in "missile power"
seems troubling. But as is so often the
case, statistics can be easily misleading.
To rehearse the mitigating facts and fig
ures regarding serviceability, accuracy,
diversity and targeting of U.S.
strategic forces in this brief article
would do the same disservice to a com
plex issue as did Gross. Suffice it to say
that a myriad of factors contribute to
the formation of a sound defense pos
ture. Most military and civilian leaders
in this country recognize that the Unit
ed States retains a very capable (albeit
not perfect) deterrent, far preferable to
present Soviet forces.
Gross' insinuations of Communist
links to the freeze movements are com
pletely unwarranted. Regardless of
one's political leanings, it seems fair to
conclude that the freeze is supported by
a large number of rather patriotic
Americans who are registering a protest
to the continuing arms race. The goal of
preventing a nuclear holocaust is, as far
as I can tell, not a reflection of a sub
versive political ideology.
Finally, contrary to Gross' conven
tion, arms control has nothing to do

with trust of the Soviet Union. Agree
ments are negotiated subject to each
side's ability to monitor independently
what the other side i§ doing. If we
trusted the Soviets, we wouldn't need
arms control.
Unfortunately, Shirish Date's rebut
tal (Daily, Oct. 6) was in many respects
equally simplistic and in some cases fac
tually incorrect. For starters, some
fourth-generation Soviet land-based
missiles are as accurate as the best
American systems. Perhaps what Date
was trying to explain was that in the
case of highly accurate nuclear weap
ons, throw weight has relatively little
significance.
Date concludes that the choice is
simple: nuclear freeze (followed by dis
armament) or oblivion. While the
freeze initiative is an admirable call by
the American people to halt the arms
race, it is by no means the only ap
proach to arms control and the preven
tion of nuclear war, nor is it simple. In
fact, it is apparent through an examina
tion of the recent history of arms con
trol negotiations that there are poten
tially serious flaws in a "freeze ap
proach."
SA LT demonstrated that the imposi
tion of weapons ceilings is a remarkably
time-consuming and painstaking task,
and perhaps not the most appropriate
goal for future arms control efforts. The
time spent in freeze negotiations trying
to construct an intricate web of restric
tions which will distinguish between
weapons of similar types that do and do
not carry nuclear bombs and it is not
at all clear that this can be ac
complished could be far better spent
first curtailing continual technological
advances and second, seeking to reduce
the risk of accidental nuclear war. The
completion of the Comprehensive Test
Ban Treaty, the ratification of SALT II
and the Threshold Test Ban Treaty, the
imposition of missile flight test quotas,
the strengthening the 1963 Hotline
agreement and the establishment of a
joint U.S.-Soviet crisis command center
are all realizable steps towards these
two important goals.
We are faced with an extraordinarily
dangerous situation. The United States
and the Soviet Union have between
them about 50,000 nuclear warheads,

any one of which could virtually ob
literate a city. Numbers have long since
stopped being the immediate problem.
Even if we first freeze and
drastically reduce the world's arsenals,
we would be faced with unprecedented
disaster if nuclear war were to erupt.
Perhaps then our first and foremost
task should be the prevention of the use
of nuclear weapons. It is at least worth
while to consider that freeze nego
tiations are not, as Date concludes, the
only choice for those favoring strategic
arms control.
