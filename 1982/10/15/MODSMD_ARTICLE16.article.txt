Former student defends Yale's labor relations

Since I also went to Yale and lived
through the blue-collar workers' strike
of 1977, I would like to respond to
David Lempert's opinion (Daily, Oct.
11). Not all the students at Yale left
with the sad, soured feeling which drove
Lempert out to sunny California for
graduate work.
1 had only a short time at the begin
ning of the year to get used to the resi
dential college system at Yale, which in
cludes dining halls as one central social
meeting place. In contrast to the scat
tered and transitory situation of stu
dents at Stanford, most Yale under
graduates live in one college for their
four years. Just as we freshmen had be
come accustomed to breakfasts in our
college, large and noisy lunches in
Commons and weekend treks to other
colleges for brunch and dinner, the
union struck every three years through
out the '7os.
I do not address the legitimacy or
lack of legitimacy of the strike, because
it makes no difference. The fact of my
first semester at Yale was that dining
halls were closed, save for Commons
which operated on a cash basis. Bath
rooms were not cleaned and other
maintenance was sporadic. We students
did not often huddle, undernourished
in our rooms. I and many others walked
to Commons, side-stepped a small but
raucous picket line, and paid for dinner
with the rebate cash given to us. Or we
went out to eat.
We in mv suite had always kept our

own bathroom clean, since the janitor
assigned to us did not himself have to
use the facilities he was responsible for
and maintained them accordingly. For
those with less conscientious habits it
made no difference. I presume that the
wear and tear of four months included
burnt-out light-bulbs, the most notice
able casualty of the lack of maintenance
workers. (Although we were happy to
inhabit Yale's ivory towers and sit com
fortably, thinking deep thoughts, we
did manage to change the burnt-out
light-bulbs.) Certainly in the in
hospitable New England climate wear
and tear on a physical plant, some of
whose buildings date from the eight
eenth century, cannot be attributed in
any great degree to four month's of in
terrupted service.
Lempert's judgment that the
University acted smugly during and af
ter the strike is just that, a judgment.
The Masters and Deans I talked to ex
pressed the same regret that students
felt, namely that so many workers who
could ill-afford suspension in wages at
the beginning of winter were caught in a
strike that so few of them wanted. By
the same token, those of us students
who thought about the tuition we were
paying and the service we were getting
could not fail to sympathize with some
of the cold, hard Fiscal facts that Yale
must work with.
If Lempert has remained bitter after
five years, f feel sorry for him. I had a

great time at Yale. Perhaps to feel a part
of a great university one has to put
oneself out a little to get involved in the
university. If Lempert missed that op
portunity at the school which pioneered
residential college education, not all of
the blame can justly be layed at the feet
of Yale.

Freeze arms race
I don't believe in unilateral disarma
ment. I love America and would hate to
live in the Soviet Union. At the same
time, I seriusly question whether civ
ilization will survive the next 10 years,
unless we end the arms race.
We can't stop it if neither side will
quit except when it holds a position of
superiority, because both sides can't be
superior at once. We can only halt the
arms race if we're willing to accept
rough equality.
Both sides now have so many in
vulnerable missiles that superiority is
useless anyway. In a conventional war,
if you have superiority yau can hope to
smash the enemy and stop it from
smashing you. In a nuclear war, if you
smash the enemy you will still get
smashed. Even if you destroy the other
country and kill millions of its people,

its submarines can still retaliate and de
stroy your country and kill millions of
your people. Both sides have more than
enough submarine-launched missiles to
do this. Submarines aren't vulnerable
to a first strike; the "window of vulner
ability" only applies to land-based mis
siles. Building more missiles won't help
us to survive.
Who is really ahead? The truth is that
we're ahead in both submarine- and air
launched missiles, and they're ahead in
land-based missiles. So the defense es
tablishment on each side can claim that
it's behind and must catch up. That
keeps the arms race going.
The weapons the Pentagon wants to
build now can destroy the Soviet
Union's land based missiles. To keep
from losing these missiles, the Soviet
Union will be sorely tempted to strike
first, or to strike on warning of an im
pending attack, without waiting to
make sure that the warning wasn't just
due to a computer malfunction. This
situation almost surely will bring nucle
ar war.
It took several years to negotiate
SALT 11. During that time both sides
kept on producing missiles. This time
we must freeze production first. We
must elect a Congress that will stop the
arms race now.
