# Florence mayor speaks on Communism
## 
### EDIE BOGART 
He grew up in a small town
near Florence, and fought in the
Tuscan Resistance against
Fascism in 1943. He was a mem
ber of the CNL (Comita Na
tional di Liberazione), the na
tional Resistance movement

which combined all Italian politi
cal forces and organized the first
Italian government after WWII.
In 1972, he joined the Central
Committee of the Communist
Party, which decides party
strategy on all issues. He was
elected mayor of Florence in
1975 and was able to juggle Lib
eral, Socialist, Republican and
Christian Democratic forces.
The mayor of Florence with
the colorful past is Elio Gabbug
giani. Last Thursday, he spoke at
La Casa Italiana on the domestic
and international role of the Ital
ian Communist Party (PCI).
The Italian Communist party
holds extensive power at the mu
nicipal and regional levels but the
party in power, the Christian
refuses to accept the
P'CI. The Italian Communist and
Socialist parties are similar in
their ideologies; and now the PCI
and the Socialists jointly govern
the biggest Italian cities, prov
inces and municipalities.
Gabbuggiani said that the po
litical "peculiarity of Italy" is due
to its historical characteristic of
socialist, bourgeois demoratic

and Catholic elements. His
torically, he said, Italy is an "im
portant link in the Mediter
ranean region."
Gabbuggiani spoke on Italy's
"social, political, economic and
moral crisis." In his view, Italy
has lacked a program and direc
tion since WWII. The vic
tims of this crisis are Southern It
aly, young people and women,
and the bureaucratic organiza
tion. With the "devaluation of
agriculture," the number of un
employed has risen, resulting in a
"lack of a future for young peo
ple and women," he said.
According to Gabbuggiani, It
aly needs a "strong democratic
leadership based on workers and
intellectuals." Organized crime is
a "real obstacle to democracy,"
Gabbuggiani told the audience
with the aid of a translator, Jan
Boiar, a Stanford junior who
speaks fluent Italian.
Gabbuggiani said that there is
a "historical crisis" in Italy: a
"crisis of governability." All for
mulas have been tried: center and
center-left. There are "dangers
that menace Italian democracy;
we must beat the conservative re
sistance," Gabbuggiani said. Ac
cording to him, the democratic
alternative of the left will bring
Italy out of its crisis.
The PCI "refuses the socialist
models of Eastern Europe" like
Poland and Romania, and be
lieves in the principles of de
mocracy, Gabbuggiani said. The
"ideal Communist model," he
said, is "based on the principle Of
equality and makes full use of its
resources." Gabbuggiani quoted
the Labor party in England and
the Social Democrats in Germa
ny as examples of social de
mocracy meeting big problems.
Gabbuggiani said that the so
cialist crisis is "deeper than it

seems and calls the Soviet model
into question." The real problem
is the "relation between workers
and the means of production,
real participation (of citizens in
government), freedom of religion
and circulation of ideas." The
PCI "fights strongly for the link

between socialism and de
mocracy," he said.
In regard to Western economic
models, Gabbuggiani said, the
PCl's goal is to "go over the capi
talistic system"; it wants a "full
devaluement of the Western sys
tem" so there is an "emphasis on
the country's interest over the big
financial groups and use of the
resources for the needs of man
and the people."
The PCI has, in Gabbuggiani's
words, "a scientific analysis of
the international view"; mem
bers see a definite "crisis between
the superpowers."
He cited five examples of this
"disorder in the international or
der": the hot conflicts and wars
between Iran and Iraq, the grow
ing race to rearmament, the dif
ficulties of the U.N., the Or
ganization of African States and
the Organization of American
States, the "disorder in the finan
cial community, and the big
powers showing that they want to
use force."

The 'ideal Communist
odel,' he said, is
'based on the principle
of equality and makes
full use of its
resources.'

Gabbuggiani said that
the political
\peculiarity of Italy' is
due to its historical
characteristic of
Socialist, Bourgeois
Democratic, and
Catholic elements.

resources for the needs of man
and the people."
The PCI has, in Gabbuggiani's
words, "a scientific analysis of
the international view"; mem
bers see a definite "crisis between
the superpowers."
He cited five examples of this
"disorder in the international or
der": the hot conflicts and wars
between Iran and Iraq, the grow
ing race to rearmament, the dif
ficulties of the U.N., the Or
ganization of African States and
the Organization of American
States, the "disorder in the finan
cial community, and the big
powers showing that they want to
use force."

The 'ideal Communist
odel,' he said, is
'based on the principle
of equality and makes
full use of its
resources.'

Gabbuggiani said that
the political
\peculiarity of Italy' is
due to its historical
characteristic of
Socialist, Bourgeois
Democratic, and
Catholic elements.
He grew up in a small town
near Florence, and fought in the
Tuscan Resistance against
Fascism in 1943. He was a mem
ber of the CNL (Comita Na
tional di Liberazione), the na
tional Resistance movement

which combined all Italian politi
cal forces and organized the first
Italian government after WWII.
In 1972, he joined the Central
Committee of the Communist
Party, which decides party
strategy on all issues. He was
elected mayor of Florence in
1975 and was able to juggle Lib
eral, Socialist, Republican and
Christian Democratic forces.
The mayor of Florence with
the colorful past is Elio Gabbug
giani. Last Thursday, he spoke at
La Casa Italiana on the domestic
and international role of the Ital
ian Communist Party (PCI).
The Italian Communist party
holds extensive power at the mu
nicipal and regional levels but the
party in power, the Christian
refuses to accept the
P'CI. The Italian Communist and
Socialist parties are similar in
their ideologies; and now the PCI
and the Socialists jointly govern
the biggest Italian cities, prov
inces and municipalities.
Gabbuggiani said that the po
litical "peculiarity of Italy" is due
to its historical characteristic of
socialist, bourgeois demoratic

and Catholic elements. His
torically, he said, Italy is an "im
portant link in the Mediter
ranean region."
Gabbuggiani spoke on Italy's
"social, political, economic and
moral crisis." In his view, Italy
has lacked a program and direc
tion since WWII. The vic
tims of this crisis are Southern It
aly, young people and women,
and the bureaucratic organiza
tion. With the "devaluation of
agriculture," the number of un
employed has risen, resulting in a
"lack of a future for young peo
ple and women," he said.
According to Gabbuggiani, It
aly needs a "strong democratic
leadership based on workers and
intellectuals." Organized crime is
a "real obstacle to democracy,"
Gabbuggiani told the audience
with the aid of a translator, Jan
Boiar, a Stanford junior who
speaks fluent Italian.
Gabbuggiani said that there is
a "historical crisis" in Italy: a
"crisis of governability." All for
mulas have been tried: center and
center-left. There are "dangers
that menace Italian democracy;
we must beat the conservative re
sistance," Gabbuggiani said. Ac
cording to him, the democratic
alternative of the left will bring
Italy out of its crisis.
The PCI "refuses the socialist
models of Eastern Europe" like
Poland and Romania, and be
lieves in the principles of de
mocracy, Gabbuggiani said. The
"ideal Communist model," he
said, is "based on the principle Of
equality and makes full use of its
resources." Gabbuggiani quoted
the Labor party in England and
the Social Democrats in Germa
ny as examples of social de
mocracy meeting big problems.
Gabbuggiani said that the so
cialist crisis is "deeper than it

seems and calls the Soviet model
into question." The real problem
is the "relation between workers
and the means of production,
real participation (of citizens in
government), freedom of religion
and circulation of ideas." The
PCI "fights strongly for the link

between socialism and de
mocracy," he said.
In regard to Western economic
models, Gabbuggiani said, the
PCl's goal is to "go over the capi
talistic system"; it wants a "full
devaluement of the Western sys
tem" so there is an "emphasis on
the country's interest over the big
financial groups and use of the
resources for the needs of man
and the people."
