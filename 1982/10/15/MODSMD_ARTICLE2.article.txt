# Fac Senate looks at different school year schedules; approves new grad major

An ad hoc committee to investigate the pros and cons of
academic calendars other than the quarter system "will not
propose any revolutions," said Prof. Edwin Good in the
committee's interim report given at yesterday's Faculty Sen
ate meeting.
The approval of a new graduate major in Medical In
formation Sciences and a retrospective glance at the strike
negotiations were also discussed at the meeting.
The investigation of other academic calendars by the com
mittee, composed of 13 members from different disciplines,
has been going on since January.
"We have examined several alternative calendar arrange
ments: the quarter system, the traditional semester, with its
'lameduck' period in January after Christmas, and the fairly
recently developed early semester program," said Good, a
professor of religious studies. They also considered a system

proposed by Prof. Gene Golub, chairman of the Computer
Science Department, which would consist of "six five-week
terms, which would be combinable in various ways," Good
said.
"The committee has become convinced that there is no
single workable calendar that is going to be entirely satisfac
tory to all members of all disciplines," continued Good. He
explained that no one system would "enable the maximum
benefit to every educational value," adding that he expected
"that there is going to continue to be a split on this matter."
Besides examining the systems on their individual merits,
the committee also considered combining more than one
system. This option, like that of the six five-week terms, was
"played with ... to the point that we guessed that it would be
excessively complicated," explained Good.
Good did not specifically state why the semester systems
were found inadequate, but he did emphasize that the rec
ommendation to retain the quarter system is not because

"there are more disciplines that favor quarters over semes
ters." It is "not a squashing of the minority by the majority,"
he said.
The Senate also approved a proposal for an M.S.
Ph.D. program in Medical Information Sciences presented
by Edward Shortliffe, assistant professor of medicine and
computer sciences, who headed the ad hoc committee which
formed the proposal. The program, approved for the
1982-83 academic year, "aims to prepare students in the ap
plication of computer technology to various aspects of medi
cal science and medical care," stated the annual report of the
Committee on Graduate Studies.
At present an informal program in Medical Information
Sciences exists, but the committee's problem statement rec
ognized problems resulting from "the current lack of coordi
nation of activities" with "curriculum development and stu
dent recruitment." Shortliffe also pointed to problems with

academic advising and the "highly theoretical Computer
Science Department," and said he hoped that the latter
would be counteracted by courses in medical computer sci
ence taught by himself and others.
In other action, University President Donald Kennedy
also spoke about the strike, stating that it was because of the
USW's "numerous allegations in the media" that "the Uni
versity's position was perceived by some to be unyielding. . .
We are convinced that the same agreement would have been
reached even earlier had the USW leadership continued seri
ous negotiations at the bargaining table instead of calling a
strike."
Kennedy said, now that the strike is over, "we must focus
our efforts to restore the quality of our continuing, daily
working relationships with bargaining unit employees at the
University."
