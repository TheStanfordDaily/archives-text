If the American theater can be said
fdfcbntain one essential play, it must
fee v Eugene O'Neill's auto
-hfo'gfaphical family drama, which he
claimed was witten in "tears and
blood." Sidney Lumet's film version,
-shpt~bv Boris Kaufman, is perhaps
fthe ideal production of that play. As
Edmund (O'Neill's stand-in), Dean
Stockwell gives an intelligent per
formance that, like his portrayal of
Paul Morel in Sons and Lovers two
years before (he was lucky enough to
be cast in the two best written com-
roles in early '6os movies),
coqXd be more expansive. The rest of
"the cast is sublime: Ralph Rich
f rdson as James Tyrone, Sr., the dist
inguished ham actor retired into a
Paranoic miserliness, slipping onto a
kitchen chair to save electricity by re
moving a lightbulb; Jason Robards
&s the grand, sloppy, dissolute cynic
f Jamie, and as Mary, trapped for
fcvejr in her morphine dreams
JCatharine Hepburn. Those infuriat
ing people who say Hepburn always
the same role should have a
go-od look at her range here; this may
Its the greatest performance given by
tni-actress since sound came in.
!TfPlays through Wednesday with
The Long Voyage Home.

*"Yampyr (1932) ★
- Geology Corner, Room 320
The plot is sketchy and most of it is
filled in by inter-titles, but Carl
Dfever's unsettling, suggestive hor
ror film contains astonishing image
after astonishing image: visually, it
must be one of the most imaginative
movies ever made. David Gray, with
his Ramon Novarro eyes, plays the
hero, Julian West; he and the rest of
the actors seem to have been chosen
lafgely for their eerie looks, although
Sybille Schmitz, as one of the vam
pire's victims, has an amazing scene
in which she conveys both demonic
possession and the struggle for re
lease from it. Shot by the great
Rudolph Mate and Louis Nee.
Plays tonight with Day of Wrath.
TJte Seventh Seal ★
New Varsity, Palo Alto
* With this medieval puzzle drama,
lagmar Bergman rose to heights that
njbne of his subsequent "dark" mov
iqs, except for Shame a dozen years
latter, has ever equalled. The knight's
chess game with Death is surely one
of the key images in world cinema,
and the sequence involving the burn
ing of the young witch suggests that
Bergman may have been inspired by
Drever's Day of Wrath. With Max
von Sydow as the knight, Bengt
Ekerot as Death, Maud Hansson as
the witch, Bibi Andersson, Gunnar
lljornstrand, and Nils Poppe.
* Plays Thursday only with Wild
itrawberries.

The Long Voyage Home (1940)
Festival, Palo Alto
After Long Day's Journey into
Night and The Iceman Cometh, this is
the best of the dozen or so movies de
rived from Eugene O'Neill. Dudley
Nichols drew together four of the
5.5. Glencairn cycle of plays early
one-acts about the sea that first drew
the attention of critics like George
Jean Nathan to O'Neill's writing
and John Ford directed, beautifully.
(This was Ford's most astounding pe
riod: in 1939 and 1940 he made
Stagecoach, Young Mr. Lincoln, The
Grapes of Wrath and this film.)
There's a storm scene that is almost
as stirring as the climax of Ford's The
Hurricane, and a marvellous funeral
at sea; the great Gregg Toland photo
graphed. The cast features John
Wavne, surprisingly convincing as
the big Swede Olsen, Barry
Fitzgerald as Cocky, Ward Bond as
Yank, Arthur Shields as
Donkeyman, Joseph Sawyer as
Davis, and Thomas Mitchell as an ex
uberant Driscoll; less memorable are
lan Hunter, Wilfrid Lawson,
Mildred Natwick and John Qualen.
Plays through Wednesday with
Long Day's Journey into Night.
Cat People
Memorial Auditorium
It's a horror, all right, but it isn't
very frightening. In this new version
of the DeWitt Bodeen story, written
bv Alan Ormsby and directed by Paul
Schrader, the cat people are a brother
and sister act, played by Malcolm
McDowell and Nastassia Kinski,
who are descended from leopards;
sex turns them into cats and, ul
timately, they can only find content
ment with others of their kind.
Schrader has no narrative skills and
no feeling for suspense, and he's too
stolid a director to be much good at
erotica, so the sex in the movie be
comes uncomfortably creepy. (There
are sadomasochistic overtones.)
Plays Sunday evening.

When you respond to the worn set
ups of a play like this Ira Levin mys
tery, blatantly derived from Sleuth
and adapted to the screen by Jay
Presson Allen, you may feel a little
like one of Pavlov's dogs. Michael
Caine, playing a famous writer of
thrillers, whacks away at the Neil Si
monesque one-liners he's stuck with;
this may be his worst performance.
As his student, Christopher Reeve at
least has charm and gives a very good
impression of determined vacu
ousness. Dyan Cannon, in the un
fortunate role of Caine's hysterical,
fawning wife, seems to know what a
regression the part is for her; her eyes
register a mixture of impatience and
disgust. Directed by Sidney Lumet.
Plays tomorrow and Monday with
Sleuth.

Day of Wrath (1943) ★
Geology Corner, Room 320
Carl Dreyer's film, set in the 17th
century, concerns the power of belief
to transform: first an old woman and
then a beautiful young pastor's wife,
thought to possess demonic gifts,
turn into the accursed figures others
believe them to be. The true wizard is
Dreyer: Day of Wrath is one of the
great movie experiences. It's difficult
to imagine how the script (by Dreyer,
Mogens Skot-Hansen and Paul
Knudsen), the photography (by Karl
Andersson), or the performances of
Lisbeth Movin as the wife, Thorkild
Roose as the pastor, and Anna
Svierkier as the victimized old wom
an could be any better than they are.
No one has ever come closer than
Dreyer to getting the spirit of
Hawthorne on the screen.
Plays tonight with Vampyr.

Tommy (1975)
Kresge
Ken Russell said he wanted to
make this movie because he believed
The Who's rock opera to be the most
important work of art produced in
this country. Only a man who thinks
this way could direct a film as grandi
osely dumb as this one. It does, how
ever, have more rhythm than most of
Russell's other pictures, and it's at
least partly perversely enjoyable.
Tina Turner, as the Acid Queen, is
the only exciting performer, though;
the others are Roger Daltrey, Ann-
Margret, Oliver Reed, Elton John,
Eric Clapton, Jack Nicholson, Keith
Moon and Robert Powell.
Plays tomorrow evening.

Aquarius, Palo Alto
Rainer Werner Fassbinder's clever
allegory about postwar Germany, in
which the most important men in
town run or frequent a nightclub
brothel, is completely worked out in
visual terms, and every plot detail is
accounted for. But it lacks humanity
and spontaneity, and it isn't inventive
enough to get away with being so
schematic: the ideas take one back to
the German Expressionists, to
Genet's The Balcony, and to other
Fassbinder pictures. Barbara
Sukowa and Mario Adorf star.

Dial 4 M' for Murder (1954)
Kresge
Frederick.Knott's thriller is one of
those devilishly clever but irritatingly
complacent pieces (like Sleuth) that
don't come off half as well on screen
as they do in a theater, and Alfred
Hitchcock couldn't do much with it.
The wit isn't really dry — it's arid;
and Bob Cummings' performance as
the duped lover is hopeless. But au
diences usually derive some pleasure
from the plot, and from the combined
personalities of Ray Milland (as the
cuckolded husband out for revenge)
and John Williams (as the police de
tective). Grace Kelly plays the wife;
it's not much of a role.
Plays tonight.
The Big Sleep (1946) ★
Kresge
Raymond Chandler's slick, fast
paced detective novel pales beside
this film version, directed by Howard
Hawks and featuring dialogue by
William Faulkner, Jules Furthman
and Leigh Brackett. The plot is tied in
knots no one has ever succeeded in
untangling; the story goes that when
the screenwriters ran into trouble,
they called Chandler up and he
couldn't figure the damn thing out
either. But the preposterous tortu
ousness of the story is as much a part
of the fun as the double entendres be
tween Bogart and Lauren Bacall, and
Martha Vickers' turn as Bacall's in
fantile, lascivious kid sister. Bogart's
impersonation of Chandler's private
eye hero Philip Marlowe may not
have met Chartdler's standards (inex
plicably, he preferred Dick Powell in
Murder, My Sweet, but no one else
has ever complained.
Plays Monday.
A Hard Day's Night (1964)
Fox, Redwood City
Richard Lester tries much too
hard to invent a new kind of musical
comedy; the fancy trick camera work
distracts us and draws attention to
Alun Owen's threadbare script. But
in their first movie, the Beatles — es
pecially Ringo — are so effortlessly
charming that the movie is hard to re
sist. From our current perspective, of
course, this early footage of the Fab
Four is inexpressibly touching.
Plays today through Sunday with
Yellow Submarine.
Pink Floyd: The Wall
Palo Alto Square, Palo Alto
The subjects are education, war,
loveless sex, anomie and mob psy
chology, but this film — a sight and
sound orgy for junior high school
mushroom heads — contains not a
single original thought on any of
them. Alan Parker, who directed,
presents an endless parade of re
hashed fifth-rate '60s imagery while
that thick, derivative music screams
at us in Dolby Stereo.
