## Rested Trojans challenge ego-ailing Cardinal tomorrow. 
### SID SPAETH 
The University of Southern
California rested last weekend as
Arizona State hammered Stan
ford's morale into the turf at Sun
Devil Stadium with a ' final
minute touchdown.
Stanford has had a week to re
juvenate its tattered bodies and

minds before hosting the Trojans
tomorrow in a nationally-tele
vised game at 12:45 p.m.
USC coach John Robinson
liked his week off, but knows
Stanford will be ready.
"We're certainly more mental
ly and physically rested than any
time during the year," Robinson

said. "The week off gave us a
chance to heal some wounds and
polish some of our skills. Now
we're rested and looking forward
to the rest of the season."
Stanford and John Elway have
been a target of teams all year.
Thousands of Arizona State
fans bore t-shirts, visors and
signs proclaiming "No Way
Elway" during the Cardinal's
21-17 loss to the Sun Devils last
week. Now, USC has rested up
and awaits its turn at Elway.
"Everyone talks about the
great physical skills Elway has,
and they are among the best of all
time," Robinson said. "But I like
him primarily because he knows
how to compete. He understands
the nuances of the game very
well, and always comes up with a
little extra when the going is the
toughest."
Arizona State's defense, the st
ingiest in the nation, held Elway
to a mere 209 yards passing last
week. USC's defense will be near
ly as strong.
The Trojan defense has al
lowed only one touchdown in 14
quarters and has compiled two
consecutive shutouts— 12-0 over
Oklahoma and 38-7 over Oregon
(the Ducks scored on a blocked
punt).
Safety Joey Browner, who is
more like Ronnie Lott than not,
is second on the team in tackles,
has intercepted two passes and
knocked down four others. He is
also first in the Pacific-10 Con
ference and third in the nation in
punt returns.
"Browner is performing at
(former Trojan safety and All-
Pro) Ronnie Lott's level," Rob
inson said. "He is coming into his
own as one of the best defensive
backs in the history of the school.
He's playing with confidence and
great aggression."

Four-year starting inside line
backer Riki Gray and pre-season
All-America nose guard George
Achica will close down the
middle.
"As usual, the Trojans' de
fense is outstanding," Wiggin
said. "They're holding oppo
nents to seven points per game,
which falls into the same catego
ry as the Arizona State team.
Browner, in particular, is excep
tional."
USC's defense has held oppo
nents to 239 yards in total offense
per game the identical Figure
that Stanford was held to last
week.
Stanford counters with a pro
lific passing combination of
Elwav and a staple of fine re
ceivers.
Running back Vincent White
leads the Cardinal in receptions
with 33 followed by flanker
Emile Harry with 23 and tight
end Chris Dressel with 21.
Dressel was the instrumental re
ceiver last week with six
catches, including several on the
key go-ahead drive late in the
game. Elway has completed
passes to 12 different Cardinal re
ceivers this season, but has been
sacked 18 times including four
times last week.
Surpassing Jack Thompson's
Pac-10 career yardage mark of
7818 yards by one yard last week,
Elway now holds nearly all major
Pac-10 career throwing marks in
cluding touchdown passes (67),
completions (641), and yardage
(7819).
"Under the circumstances,
John was incredible last week,"
Wiggin said. "Arizona State's en
tire defensive effort was focused
on pressuring him, and I think he
responded well."
The Southern Cal offense has
been more diversified than any in
recent years. The traditionally

great tailback attack has aver
aged 198 yards rushing this sea
son, but is complemented by a
passing attack averaging an iden
tical 198 yards a game.
Tim Spencer was moved from
fullback to the critical tailback
position after injuries to Michael
Harper and Fred Crutcher.

Spencer has rushed for 261 yards
and three touchdowns in 54 at
tempts.
Quarterback Sean Salisbury
has completed 58 percent of his
passes for 618 yards and four
touchdowns.
The Stanford defense, which
until a final-minute lapse last

week had improved with each
week, has been led by Gary Wirp
mer with 53 tackles
Soderland with 42.
The Cardinal has also in
tercepted 13 times. Both quarter
backs have thrown five intercep
tions. :! ?

BROWNER'S BREAK-UP: Southern California safety Joey Browner battles Greg Hooper
(left) and Mike Tolliver for a pass in Stanford's 25-17 loss at the Coliseum last year.
The University of Southern
California rested last weekend as
Arizona State hammered Stan
ford's morale into the turf at Sun
Devil Stadium with a ' final
minute touchdown.
Stanford has had a week to re
juvenate its tattered bodies and

minds before hosting the Trojans
tomorrow in a nationally-tele
vised game at 12:45 p.m.
USC coach John Robinson
liked his week off, but knows
Stanford will be ready.
"We're certainly more mental
ly and physically rested than any
time during the year," Robinson

said. "The week off gave us a
chance to heal some wounds and
polish some of our skills. Now
we're rested and looking forward
to the rest of the season."
Stanford and John Elway have
been a target of teams all year.
Thousands of Arizona State
fans bore t-shirts, visors and
signs proclaiming "No Way
Elway" during the Cardinal's
21-17 loss to the Sun Devils last
week. Now, USC has rested up
and awaits its turn at Elway.
"Everyone talks about the
great physical skills Elway has,
and they are among the best of all
time," Robinson said. "But I like
him primarily because he knows
how to compete. He understands
the nuances of the game very
well, and always comes up with a
little extra when the going is the
toughest."
Arizona State's defense, the st
ingiest in the nation, held Elway
to a mere 209 yards passing last
week. USC's defense will be near
ly as strong.
The Trojan defense has al
lowed only one touchdown in 14
quarters and has compiled two
consecutive shutouts— 12-0 over
Oklahoma and 38-7 over Oregon
(the Ducks scored on a blocked
punt).
Safety Joey Browner, who is
more like Ronnie Lott than not,
is second on the team in tackles,
has intercepted two passes and
knocked down four others. He is
also first in the Pacific-10 Con
ference and third in the nation in
punt returns.
"Browner is performing at
(former Trojan safety and All-
Pro) Ronnie Lott's level," Rob
inson said. "He is coming into his
own as one of the best defensive
backs in the history of the school.
He's playing with confidence and
great aggression."

Four-year starting inside line
backer Riki Gray and pre-season
All-America nose guard George
Achica will close down the
middle.
"As usual, the Trojans' de
fense is outstanding," Wiggin
said. "They're holding oppo
nents to seven points per game,
which falls into the same catego
ry as the Arizona State team.
Browner, in particular, is excep
tional."
USC's defense has held oppo
nents to 239 yards in total offense
per game the identical Figure
that Stanford was held to last
week.
Stanford counters with a pro
lific passing combination of
Elwav and a staple of fine re
ceivers.
Running back Vincent White
leads the Cardinal in receptions
with 33 followed by flanker
Emile Harry with 23 and tight
end Chris Dressel with 21.
Dressel was the instrumental re
ceiver last week with six
catches, including several on the
key go-ahead drive late in the
game. Elway has completed
passes to 12 different Cardinal re
ceivers this season, but has been
sacked 18 times including four
times last week.
Surpassing Jack Thompson's
Pac-10 career yardage mark of
7818 yards by one yard last week,
Elway now holds nearly all major
Pac-10 career throwing marks in
cluding touchdown passes (67),
completions (641), and yardage
(7819).
"Under the circumstances,
John was incredible last week,"
Wiggin said. "Arizona State's en
tire defensive effort was focused
on pressuring him, and I think he
responded well."
The Southern Cal offense has
been more diversified than any in
recent years. The traditionally

great tailback attack has aver
aged 198 yards rushing this sea
son, but is complemented by a
passing attack averaging an iden
tical 198 yards a game.
Tim Spencer was moved from
fullback to the critical tailback
position after injuries to Michael
Harper and Fred Crutcher.

Spencer has rushed for 261 yards
and three touchdowns in 54 at
tempts.
Quarterback Sean Salisbury
has completed 58 percent of his
passes for 618 yards and four
touchdowns.
The Stanford defense, which
until a final-minute lapse last

week had improved with each
week, has been led by Gary Wirp
mer with 53 tackles
Soderland with 42.
The Cardinal has also in
tercepted 13 times. Both quarter
