# Water poloists face Southern Cal teams
## 
### CHRIS ADDINGTON 
This weekend promises to be action-filled at the DeGuerre
Pool Complex as the No. 2 ranked Stanford water polo team
takes on two Southern California powerhouses. Cal State-Long
Beach and the University of Southern California will both be
here to do battle with the Cardinal.
Starting this afternoon at 3 p.m. Stanford will take on No. 10-
ranked Long Beach. The 49ers lost a large portion of their start
ing lineup to graduation last year after taking the runner-up
position at the NCAAs; but they will be supported by this
year's top high school recruit, Phil Castillo.
Stanford faces the No. 6-rated Trojans tomorrow morning at
11, and the Cardinal will perhaps have a little revenge factor
going for them in the match.
"We've only lost two games at home in seven years," said
Stanford head coach Dante Dettamanti. "One of them was to
USC."
"This is a typical USC team, very intense," he continued.
"We have to play good pressure water polo and capitalize on
any advantages."
A special highlight of the USC game will be a half-time ap
pearance by several Cardinal and Trojan Olympic players. USC
Olympians Ron Severa and Ace Burns, as well as Stanford
Olympians Dutch McCallister ('32, '36), Jody Campbell ('80),
Chris Dorst ('80), Drew McDonald ('80) and 1972 bronze med
alist Gary Sheerer will be on hand for the ceremony.
Tomorrow's action will start at 9:30 a.m. with the undefeated
Stanford junior varsity hosting the USC JV's. Admission to all
events is free with a Stanford student ID.
