# Titinger bangs one home for win
## Kickers squeak by Santa Clara in final minute 
### JOHN KELLY 
Stanford varsity soccer coach
Nelson Lodge must be omnis
cient. Or lucky. Or both.
Coming off of last week's bit
ter 2-1 overtime loss to San Jose
State, Lodge predicted that
Wednesday's match against San
ta Clara at Maloney Field would
be "a really close game 1-0,
2-1 or overtime."
It was close. In fact, the score

less deadlock that lasted
throughout the game seemed cer
tain to propel both teams into ov
ertime until Stanford's junior
striker Jorge Titinger netted a
dazzling shot in the final minute
of play to stun a large contingent
of Santa Clara fans and delight
the Cardinal crowd with a 1-0
victory. \
From the opening kickoff on,
the two teams seemed quite even

ly matched, and they continually
tested each other to find a
weakness which might lead to a
score. Stanford had the early
chances, with quick and con
trolled passes by Walter Kingson
leading to a booming shot from
Giancarlo Ferruzzi just over the
bar, and a high centering pass
from Titinger to Albert Jordan
which forced a midair save from
Santa Clara goalkeeper Chris

Sigler.
Santa Clara counter-attacked
consistently, spreading the ball
out to its wings with quick, short
passes, and then moving hard at
the Stanford goal.
But the Stanford defense, led
bv senior Doug Clark, stifled the
attack, and goalkeeper Willie
Burkhardt was relatively un
tested. Meanwhile, strong pres
sure from the Cardinal, through
long runs by fullback Charlie
Crane, were being contained by
an effective offsides trap em
ployed by the Santa Clara de
fense.
The best chance Stanford had
in the first half came from a thun
d ing head shot by Mark Talk
'ton off of an Angel Vazquez
- ner kick, a shot which re
minded off of the post and pro
ved a goalmouth melee ending
i a desperation save from the
Santa Clara goalie.
The second half of the score
less game began in much of the
same fashion as the first half, ex
cept for the growing offensive
domination by Stanford. In the
entire game, the Cardinal
pounded the Santa Clara goal
with 18 shots while only being
shot upon nine times. Chances
came time and again for the

Cardinal, who just couldn't find
the net. First it was Todd
Rafalovich who went through
alone, only to push the ball by the
post.
Titinger's speed and change of
pace carried him by two defen
ders in anothereffort in which his
pass was headed over the goal by
Ferruzzi. It was only fitting that
he be the one to win the game for
the Cardinal. On a crisp pass
from Ferruzzi, he beat one de
fender, and then drawing the
Santa Clara goaltender to the left
of the goal, he pocketed a shot in
the far right corner.
"Santa Clara had boys that
could run, run, run," Ferruzzi
said after the game. "But we took
it right at them. They weren't as
skillful as San Jose State, but they
had a high-work rate. What was
most important about this game
was that we didn't change our
game we played the way we
knew how." Stanford, as Fer
ruzzi said, never stopped trying,
and it was that hard work that
paid off with a goal in the last
minute by Titinger.
Stanford now stands at 8-2-1.
They play the University of the
Pacific Saturday in Stockton.
The next home game is Monday
at 1 p.m. at Maloney Field.

bv senior Doug Clark, stifled the
attack, and goalkeeper Willie
Burkhardt was relatively un
tested. Meanwhile, strong pres
sure from the Cardinal, through
long runs by fullback Charlie
Crane, were being contained by
an effective offsides trap em
ployed by the Santa Clara de
fense.
The best chance Stanford had
in the first half came from a thun
d ing head shot by Mark Talk
'ton off of an Angel Vazquez
- ner kick, a shot which re
minded off of the post and pro
ved a goalmouth melee ending
i a desperation save from the
Santa Clara goalie.
The second half of the score
less game began in much of the
same fashion as the first half, ex
cept for the growing offensive
domination by Stanford. In the
entire game, the Cardinal
pounded the Santa Clara goal
with 18 shots while only being
shot upon nine times. Chances
came time and again for the

Cardinal, who just couldn't find
the net. First it was Todd
Rafalovich who went through
alone, only to push the ball by the
post.
Titinger's speed and change of
pace carried him by two defen
ders in anothereffort in which his
pass was headed over the goal by
Ferruzzi. It was only fitting that
he be the one to win the game for
the Cardinal. On a crisp pass
from Ferruzzi, he beat one de
fender, and then drawing the
Santa Clara goaltender to the left
of the goal, he pocketed a shot in
the far right corner.
"Santa Clara had boys that
could run, run, run," Ferruzzi
said after the game. "But we took
it right at them. They weren't as
skillful as San Jose State, but they
had a high-work rate. What was
most important about this game
was that we didn't change our
game we played the way we
knew how." Stanford, as Fer
ruzzi said, never stopped trying,
and it was that hard work that
paid off with a goal in the last
minute by Titinger.
Stanford now stands at 8-2-1.
They play the University of the
Pacific Saturday in Stockton.
The next home game is Monday
at 1 p.m. at Maloney Field.
