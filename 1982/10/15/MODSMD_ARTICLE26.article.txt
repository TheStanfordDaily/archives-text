### JENNIFER SEYMOUR 
The Stanford women's soccer
club will depart from the stage of
local soccer club competition to
perform in the world-renowned
Royal Hawaiian World Soccer
Cup for the first time in their his
tory tomorrow.
"It's (the Royal Hawaiian
Cup) known as the best-or
ganized women's soccer tourney
in the world," said team captain
Sue Moore."lt will be excellent
exposure for the team , and if we
place it'll put us among the best
women's teams in the world."
The week-long competition in
volves a gamut of 20 teams
including the reputed world
champions, Taiwan, as well as
teams from Australia, China,
Canada, Colorado and Santa
Cruz.
Fifteen women journey to
Honolulu tomorrow, all Stan
ford students except for Nancy
Geiss, who graduated last year.
Geiss played for Stanford for
four years, then went on to play
abroad for the U.S. Select team

last spring.
The team is guaranteed four
games, and two final matches if
they meet with success. As to
their prospects, team members
are unsure: "We want to win, but
we can't really say how we'll do
we've never played against
teams from outside the country
before," said Hiedi Philbrick, a
sophomore midfielder.
"It will be great experience and
very good for the team,"said
goalie Theresa Greaney. "And it
will be good recognition for the
team."
The team has practiced twice
every day since the second day of
registration to prepare for the
tournament.
The training seems to be
paying off. In a two-hour scrim
mage against Berkeley's Varsity
Women's soccer team, Stanford
proved the victor by a substantial
4-0. The club also tied local Dis
trict 2 All-Stars 3-3 in a fast-mov
ing match which allowed the
hooters to test their speed.
