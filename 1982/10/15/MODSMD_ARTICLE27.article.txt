# Spikers rip California 3-1
## 
### STEPHEN STRENG 
The saying goes that whoever
gets on the board first wins the
game, but Wednesday night the
California Bears scored first in
every game but managed to win
only one as the Stanford wom
en's volleyball team avenged an
earlier loss and defeated Califor
nia three games to one in a non
conference match in Maples Pa
vilion.
In the fourth game, as in the
previous games, the Cardinal was
leading by a large margin only to
lose to the aggressive Bears.
The Card was ahead 12-6 when
California, led by their imposing
front line of 6-1 sophomore
Becky Connolly, 6-0 junior Syl
vie Monnet, and 6-0 senior Kelly
McGarrey, tied it up at 13-13 and
eventually moved the score to
14-14. The Card got the serve on

a side-out and went on to score
two consecutive points to win the
game and the match, 16-14.
In the first game, the Bears
shocked the Cardinal by moving
to a 4-0 lead. The Cardinal ap
peared to be suffering from pre
game jitters as they misplayed
several balls. But, led by the play
of sophomore setter Diedra
Dvorak, the Card tied the game
up at 4-4.
Stanford eventually built their
lead to 14-7 until, aided by the
Card's own errors, Cal pulled to
within one. At 14-13, however,
Stanford got a side-out and
scored the game winning point
on a mis-set ball that senior
middle blocker J.J. Gearhart
managed to tip over the net jusi
beyond the stunned California
front line.
In the second game, things

completely fell apart for the
Cardinal back row as they missed
many digs and passed ineffectual
ly. Cal, capitalizing on Stanford's
mistakes, jumped to a 8-1 lead
and ended up defeating the
Cardinal, 15-5
The Cardinal managed to put
it back together, though, in time
for the crucial third game. The
score swayed back and forth until
at 4-4, Stanford, paced by the
plav of freshman Kim Oden and
Dvorak, spurted to a 13-6 advan
tage. The Card again managed to
go into self-destruct, though, and
senior outside hitter Lisa New
man led the Golden Bears to a
13-13 tie. At that juncture Oden
came up with a crucial block to
give the Card a side- out, and sen
ior outside hitter Deanna Boyette
served two straight points to give
the gutsv Cardinal a 15-13 vic
tory.
"It seems like we struggled. We
had big leads in all three games
we won and we squandered
them," said Assistant Coach
Don Shaw.
The Cardinal is now 13-5 over
all. Next week they take on de
fending national champion Uni
versity of Southern California in
an important conference match.
The Cardinal is third in the
Western Collegiate Athletic As
sociation with a 3-1 record be
hind Arizona (4-1) and San Die
go State (5-1). "We're going to
have to play a lot better than we
played tonight," said Shaw, "but
I think we're capable of it."
