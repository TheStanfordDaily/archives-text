The Stanford field hockey
team is on a roll.
Saturday they beat Long
Beach State 3-1 and Wednesday
they emerged victorious from a
hard-fought Chico State game
2-1.
Tomorrow Stanford plays San

Jose State at 11 a.m. at Roble
Field. Last year San Jose State
denied Stanford a berth at na
tionals and again could stand in
the Cardinal's way.
In Wednesday's win, the first
half belonged almost exclusively
to Chico State who attacked re
lentlessb using impressive play as
their trademark

Chico State was unable to cap
italize on their opportunities,
however and Stanford Finally as
serted itself when senior forward
Julie Erman scored her fourth
goal of the season off of an assist
from sophomore forward Jen
nifer Bleaklev with 40 seconds re
maining in the half.
Stanford established control in

the second half with freshman
Karen Chamberlain scoring on a
stroke with five minutes left in
the game. Chico State managed
to score their lone goal one
minute later but it came too late.
Stanford has only three seniors
on the young squad, but has im
proved its record to 5-1-1 after
bouncing back from a disappoin-(
ting 1-0 loss to Berkeley two
weeks ago.
