# Stanford car owners get most of county citations

### JAN BENJAMIN 
The 52,000 parking citations issued
annually to Stanford automobile
owners comprise about 60 percent of all
tickets given in Santa Clara County, ac
cording to DATACOM, the Santa
Clara County statistics bureau.
Marvin Herrington, Stanford Police
chief, said the large volume of tickets
does not result from a lack of parking
spaces on campus. "The rub," he
said,"comes from the fact that they
aren't always where (people) want
them."
Over the past eight or nine years,
3000 to 5000 spaces have been moved
from the inner campus to the outer
parts of campus because of building
construction, according to Herrington.
"To give you an idea, (when) I came
here in 1971, the Law School, CERAS
Building, Green Library, Hoover 111
and Terman Engineering Building were
all parking sites," he said.
Herrington added that more than 300
parking spaces were lost in the forming
of Galvez Street by Encina Hall
into a mall. On Galvez Street anoth

er road between Serra Street and Cam
pus Drive near Escondido Village
parking spaces were eliminated by the
narrowing of the street due to the addi
tion of curbs.
"All (the lost) places have been re
placed," Herrington explained, "but
they're on the outskirts of campus."
"The 11,000 or 12,000 spaces are ade
quate; but if you have to work in Term
an Engineering and you have to park at
Maples Pavilion, that's where the prob
lems come in."
The primary officers responsible for
the issuing of tickets on campus are the
Community Service Officers, members
of the Stanford Police who are depu
tized by Santa Clara County specifical
ly to issue parking tickets.
"To issue county citations and to use
the court system, the authority must
come from the county," Herrington ex
plained. "Of course, the county is only
too happy to receive the benefits from
this income."
"Many years ago, prior to 1971,
when I came here, Stanford Police is

CAUGHT OFF-ROAD: This car was parked - by a perhaps harried
driver in a no-parking zone on campus. Although the number of parking
spaces has not changed appreciably in recent years, Stanford receives over
60 percent of the parking citations issued in Santa Clara county.
