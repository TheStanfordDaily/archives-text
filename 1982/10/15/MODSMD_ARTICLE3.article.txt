# Stanford car owners get most of county citations
## 
### JAN BENJAMIN 
The 52,000 parking citations issued
annually to Stanford automobile
owners comprise about 60 percent of all
tickets given in Santa Clara County, ac
cording to DATACOM, the Santa
Clara County statistics bureau.
Marvin Herrington, Stanford Police
chief, said the large volume of tickets
does not result from a lack of parking
spaces on campus. "The rub," he
said,"comes from the fact that they
aren't always where (people) want
them."
Over the past eight or nine years,
3000 to 5000 spaces have been moved
from the inner campus to the outer
parts of campus because of building
construction, according to Herrington.
"To give you an idea, (when) I came
here in 1971, the Law School, CERAS
Building, Green Library, Hoover 111
and Terman Engineering Building were
all parking sites," he said.
Herrington added that more than 300
parking spaces were lost in the forming
of Galvez Street by Encina Hall
into a mall. On Galvez Street anoth

er road between Serra Street and Cam
pus Drive near Escondido Village
parking spaces were eliminated by the
narrowing of the street due to the addi
tion of curbs.
"All (the lost) places have been re
placed," Herrington explained, "but
they're on the outskirts of campus."
"The 11,000 or 12,000 spaces are ade
quate; but if you have to work in Term
an Engineering and you have to park at
Maples Pavilion, that's where the prob
lems come in."
The primary officers responsible for
the issuing of tickets on campus are the
Community Service Officers, members
of the Stanford Police who are depu
tized by Santa Clara County specifical
ly to issue parking tickets.
"To issue county citations and to use
the court system, the authority must
come from the county," Herrington ex
plained. "Of course, the county is only
too happy to receive the benefits from
this income."
"Many years ago, prior to 1971,
when I came here, Stanford Police is

sued their own tickets and collected
fines which came directly to the Univer
sity," Herrington said.
This was different from the court sys
tem, according to the police chief. Un
der the present system, the county is
sues warrants, freezes driver or auto
mobile licenses and levy fines when
tickets are left unpaid.
"When Stanford Police wrote tickets
and you didn't pay them, they would
put a hold on your transcripts or your
diploma," Herrington said.
This practice was challenged in a case
by another university in the Supreme
Court, according to Herrington. The
Court ruled that you could not use aca
demic sanctions for parking violations.
The University, or "any educational
institution exempted in whole or in part
from taxation" has the authority to set
up parking regulations on its territory,
according to Section 21113 of the Cali
fornia Vehicle Code. When public traf
fic is permitted to flow on University
territory, "in the absence of any specific
conditions or regulations applicable to
the traffic, all the provisions of this code
relating to traffic upon the highways
shall be applicable ..." on University
grounds as well.
In accordance with this code, Santa
Clara County Sheriffs Office supplies
citations to the Stanford police who are
responsible for issuing tickets, accord

ing to Stanford Police Captain WilliaWr
VVullschleger. The captain said the Uni
versity receives nothing since Stanford
is private property. The money gener
ated bv thousands of Stanford citations
goes to the county general fund.
These tickets run anywhere from $7
for exceeding a zone time limit, to $27
for parking in a handicap zone.
"Santa Clara County raised the min
imum fine from $5 to $7 about a year
ago to pay for the new jail,"
Wullschleger explained.
Of the tickets issued on campus, half
are paid upon the first issuing of the
citation, with the remainder of fines re
quiring second and third notices before
payment arrives, according to
DATACOM.
After 30 days, a second notice and
$lO additional fine is issued. After 30
more days, a notice from the Depart
ment of Motor Vehicles is sent includ
ing an additional $l3 fine.
Enforcement of certain parking regu
lations were changed last year for safety
reasons, according to Herrington.
Because of safety concerns raised by
a series of campus assaults last year,
cars parked illegally in "A" and U C"
lots will not be ticketed after 3 p.m.
before 8 a.m.. Regulations were pre
viously enforced until 5 p.m.
"It didn't seem to create any addi
tional problems, so we decided to keep
the enforcement hours the same this
year and see how it went," Herriri^ton
said.

Herrington added that more than 300
parking spaces were lost in the forming
of Galvez Street by Encina Hall
into a mall. On Galvez Street anoth

er road between Serra Street and Cam
pus Drive near Escondido Village
parking spaces were eliminated by the
narrowing of the street due to the addi
tion of curbs.
"All (the lost) places have been re
placed," Herrington explained, "but
they're on the outskirts of campus."
"The 11,000 or 12,000 spaces are ade
quate; but if you have to work in Term
an Engineering and you have to park at
Maples Pavilion, that's where the prob
lems come in."
The primary officers responsible for
the issuing of tickets on campus are the
Community Service Officers, members
of the Stanford Police who are depu
tized by Santa Clara County specifical
ly to issue parking tickets.
"To issue county citations and to use
the court system, the authority must
come from the county," Herrington ex
plained. "Of course, the county is only
too happy to receive the benefits from
this income."

when I came here, Stanford Police is

fines which came directly to the Univer

This was different from the court sys

sues warrants, freezes driver or auto
mobile licenses and levy fines when
tickets are left unpaid.
"When Stanford Police wrote tickets
and you didn't pay them, they would
put a hold on your transcripts or your
diploma," Herrington said.
This practice was challenged in a case
by another university in the Supreme
Court, according to Herrington. The
Court ruled that you could not use aca
demic sanctions for parking violations.
The University, or "any educational
institution exempted in whole or in part
from taxation" has the authority to set
up parking regulations on its territory,
according to Section 21113 of the Cali
fornia Vehicle Code. When public traf
fic is permitted to flow on University
territory, "in the absence of any specific
conditions or regulations applicable to
the traffic, all the provisions of this code
relating to traffic upon the highways
shall be applicable ..." on University
grounds as well.
In accordance with this code, Santa
Clara County Sheriffs Office supplies
citations to the Stanford police who are
responsible for issuing tickets, accord

ing to Stanford Police Captain WilliaWr
VVullschleger. The captain said the Uni
versity receives nothing since Stanford
is private property. The money gener
ated bv thousands of Stanford citations
goes to the county general fund.
These tickets run anywhere from $7
for exceeding a zone time limit, to $27
for parking in a handicap zone.
"Santa Clara County raised the min
imum fine from $5 to $7 about a year
ago to pay for the new jail,"
Wullschleger explained.
Of the tickets issued on campus, half
are paid upon the first issuing of the
citation, with the remainder of fines re
quiring second and third notices before
payment arrives, according to
DATACOM.
After 30 days, a second notice and
$lO additional fine is issued. After 30
more days, a notice from the Depart
ment of Motor Vehicles is sent includ
ing an additional $l3 fine.
Enforcement of certain parking regu
lations were changed last year for safety
reasons, according to Herrington.
Because of safety concerns raised by
a series of campus assaults last year,
cars parked illegally in "A" and U C"
lots will not be ticketed after 3 p.m.
before 8 a.m.. Regulations were pre
viously enforced until 5 p.m.
"It didn't seem to create any addi
tional problems, so we decided to keep
the enforcement hours the same this
year and see how it went," Herriri^ton
said.
The 52,000 parking citations issued
annually to Stanford automobile
owners comprise about 60 percent of all
tickets given in Santa Clara County, ac
cording to DATACOM, the Santa
Clara County statistics bureau.
Marvin Herrington, Stanford Police
chief, said the large volume of tickets
does not result from a lack of parking
spaces on campus. "The rub," he
said,"comes from the fact that they
aren't always where (people) want
them."
Over the past eight or nine years,
3000 to 5000 spaces have been moved
from the inner campus to the outer
parts of campus because of building
construction, according to Herrington.
"To give you an idea, (when) I came
here in 1971, the Law School, CERAS
Building, Green Library, Hoover 111
and Terman Engineering Building were
all parking sites," he said.
