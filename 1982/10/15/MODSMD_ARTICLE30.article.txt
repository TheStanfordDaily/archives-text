# Official Daily, KZSU picks with guest greek
## 
### 
Guest Greek is a weekly feature of the Daily
sports section, where we find some unsuspecting
soul to put his predictive powers on the line against
the greek gods, sports editors Steve Odell and Sid
Spaeth. Also on the weekly slate are KZSUsports
director Tom Kohn and the Latest Line from Las
Vegas.

This week's Guest Greek is Don Bunce, former
Stanford quarterback from 1969-71. Now a doc
tor at the Stanford Medical Center, Bunce was the
signal caller in Stanford's last-second 13-12 Rose
Bowl win over Michigan on Jan. 1, 1972. Bunce
completed 24-of-44 passes for 290 yards in the vic
tory.
