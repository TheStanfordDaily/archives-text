) Welcome! To the wonderful world of delectable delica
cies, elegant edibles, culinary curiosities and occasionally
vile viands. Before we embark on our exploration of ex
citing eateries, let me tell you a little bit about my eating
experience.
I was introduced to elegant food the minute that I
could chew a portion of Beef Wellington. My father
owned a very popular restaurant in Chicago, and my
mother is an amateur caterer. I have been exposed to
almost every variety of food that is served in the United
States and I am particularly fond of French, Italian, Mex
ican, 1 hai and Mid-East cuisines. Over the years, I have
an "armchair" food critic trying and eval
uating well over two hundred restaurants. I have joined

the Daily in hopes of sharing my knowledge and ap
preciation of good food with others. I think that eating is,
and should be, fun, and I hope that I can get you excited
about trying new and interesting foods at various restau
rants on the Peninsula, in the City and up and down the
coast. Well, enough of that. Let's get started! . . .
Last Thursday night, I travelled down to Cupertino in
search of Anthony's Pier 9. When I pulled off 280, the res
taurant wasn't very hard to find it encompassed half a
city block. 1 have to admit that 1 am always skeptical of
restaurants that are really big. However, because this was

going to be my first review, I entered Anthony's with an
open mind.
Although we had a reservation, we still had to wait 30
minutes to be seated the place was packed. After being
seated, I reached for my monocle and magnifying glass
and was finally able to read the menu. However, after
reading it, I wished that I hadn't. Who did they think I
was, some rich oil executive?
We began our meal with two appetizers; prawn
cocktail ($5.50) and shrimp cocktail ($4.25). Both of
them were mediocre and neither the shrimp nor the
prawns were fresh. I was shocked to hear that although
Anthony's is primarily a fish restaurant, only three of
their dishes were fresh the halibut, the swordfish and
the salmon.
Unfortunately, the poached fillet of salmon ($13.95)
was extremely watery and mushy due to the fact that they
had poached it too long. It was served with a sauce that
looked and tasted like butter gelatin. Later, 1 was told
that the sauce was supposed to be Hollandaise it
seemed as if they forgot to include the eggs.
Our other entree did not prove to be any better. An
thony's prides itself on the quality of their milk-fed Pro
vini Veal, and I confess that the veal in the veal Marsala
($14.95) was very delicate and tender. However, despite
the fact that the chef is Italian, he seems to have forgotten
his mother's recipe for marsala sauce. The sauce was de
void of any lemon or marsala flavoring, while it was dom
inated by the taste of olive oil.
Other entrees include: saltimbocca ($13.95), lobster
Thermidor ($16.95), and abalone steak ($21.95). All din
ners include a vegetable and rice. However, our green
beans were overcooked and the rice was cold.
Anthony's still had one more chance to make me hap
py: DESSERT. I love desserts I rarely finish dinner
without capping it off with three or four desserts. Un
fortunately, the desserts carried on the poor tradition
that was set by the main course. The cannoli Siciliano
($2.00) could have been good except that the shell was
stale (but, of course, I scooped out the filling and ate it).

The chocolate mousse ($2.00) was a big disappointment
it tasted more like chocolate pudding than chocolate
mousse. The only saving grace were the fresh straw
berries ($1.75) fresh and tasty strawberries placed in a
bowl, not exactly difficult to prepare.
Our waiter was very nice and courteous, but he lacked
a good understanding of how the food was prepared. All
in all, I have to say that I was not impressed with An
thony's Pier 9. I honestly believe that they begin the day
with fairly high quality products, but after the food and

pre-made sauces have been on a steam table for several
hours, they tend to lose their flavor.
1 am sorry that my first review was no more encourag
ing. It seems to me that if you're going to pay high prices
for a meal you should at least expect good food, a nice
atmosphere, or both. However, Anthony's food was not
worth the price, and the atmosphere is fairly uncom
fortable. The combination of an extremely high ceiling
and low-slung chairs makes everyone seem short. In addi
tion, the close proximity of the tables virtually eliminates
the possibility of an intimate dinner. But, if you have a lot
of money left over from the strike, you might want to
drive down 280 and have dinner at Anthony's at least
you'll enjoy the pretty drive.

Anthony's still had one more chance to make me hap
py: DESSERT. I love desserts I rarely finish dinner
without capping it off with three or four desserts. Un
fortunately, the desserts carried on the poor tradition
that was set by the main course. The cannoli Siciliano
($2.00) could have been good except that the shell was
stale (but, of course, I scooped out the filling and ate it).

The chocolate mousse ($2.00) was a big disappointment
it tasted more like chocolate pudding than chocolate
mousse. The only saving grace were the fresh straw
berries ($1.75) fresh and tasty strawberries placed in a
bowl, not exactly difficult to prepare.
Our waiter was very nice and courteous, but he lacked
a good understanding of how the food was prepared. All
in all, I have to say that I was not impressed with An
thony's Pier 9. I honestly believe that they begin the day
with fairly high quality products, but after the food and

pre-made sauces have been on a steam table for several
hours, they tend to lose their flavor.
1 am sorry that my first review was no more encourag
ing. It seems to me that if you're going to pay high prices
for a meal you should at least expect good food, a nice
atmosphere, or both. However, Anthony's food was not
worth the price, and the atmosphere is fairly uncom
fortable. The combination of an extremely high ceiling
and low-slung chairs makes everyone seem short. In addi
tion, the close proximity of the tables virtually eliminates
the possibility of an intimate dinner. But, if you have a lot
of money left over from the strike, you might want to
drive down 280 and have dinner at Anthony's at least
you'll enjoy the pretty drive.

) Welcome! To the wonderful world of delectable delica
cies, elegant edibles, culinary curiosities and occasionally
vile viands. Before we embark on our exploration of ex
citing eateries, let me tell you a little bit about my eating
experience.
I was introduced to elegant food the minute that I
could chew a portion of Beef Wellington. My father
owned a very popular restaurant in Chicago, and my
mother is an amateur caterer. I have been exposed to
almost every variety of food that is served in the United
States and I am particularly fond of French, Italian, Mex
ican, 1 hai and Mid-East cuisines. Over the years, I have
an "armchair" food critic trying and eval
uating well over two hundred restaurants. I have joined

the Daily in hopes of sharing my knowledge and ap
preciation of good food with others. I think that eating is,
and should be, fun, and I hope that I can get you excited
about trying new and interesting foods at various restau
rants on the Peninsula, in the City and up and down the
coast. Well, enough of that. Let's get started! . . .
Last Thursday night, I travelled down to Cupertino in
search of Anthony's Pier 9. When I pulled off 280, the res
taurant wasn't very hard to find it encompassed half a
city block. 1 have to admit that 1 am always skeptical of
restaurants that are really big. However, because this was

going to be my first review, I entered Anthony's with an
open mind.
Although we had a reservation, we still had to wait 30
minutes to be seated the place was packed. After being
seated, I reached for my monocle and magnifying glass
and was finally able to read the menu. However, after
reading it, I wished that I hadn't. Who did they think I
was, some rich oil executive?
We began our meal with two appetizers; prawn
cocktail ($5.50) and shrimp cocktail ($4.25). Both of
them were mediocre and neither the shrimp nor the
prawns were fresh. I was shocked to hear that although
Anthony's is primarily a fish restaurant, only three of
their dishes were fresh the halibut, the swordfish and
the salmon.
Unfortunately, the poached fillet of salmon ($13.95)
was extremely watery and mushy due to the fact that they
had poached it too long. It was served with a sauce that
looked and tasted like butter gelatin. Later, 1 was told
that the sauce was supposed to be Hollandaise it
seemed as if they forgot to include the eggs.
Our other entree did not prove to be any better. An
thony's prides itself on the quality of their milk-fed Pro
vini Veal, and I confess that the veal in the veal Marsala
($14.95) was very delicate and tender. However, despite
the fact that the chef is Italian, he seems to have forgotten
his mother's recipe for marsala sauce. The sauce was de
void of any lemon or marsala flavoring, while it was dom
inated by the taste of olive oil.
Other entrees include: saltimbocca ($13.95), lobster
Thermidor ($16.95), and abalone steak ($21.95). All din
ners include a vegetable and rice. However, our green
beans were overcooked and the rice was cold.
Anthony's still had one more chance to make me hap
py: DESSERT. I love desserts I rarely finish dinner
without capping it off with three or four desserts. Un

that was set by the main course. The cannoli Siciliano
