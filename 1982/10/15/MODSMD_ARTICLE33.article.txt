# Plan your escape to the coast for that special romantic rendezvous

THE CHART HOUSE
8150 Cabrillo Hwy Montara
728-7366
The hostess told us that the
Chart House was the last build
ing on the left in Montara. Con
sidering that there is a total of
only eight buildings in Montara,
the Chart House was relatively
easy to find.
Perched over Montara State
Beach, the Chart House is one of
those romantic restaurants with
an ocean view that you always
dream about, but never seem to
find.
Apparently, quite a few people
have found this restaurant. We
arrived on a Friday night at 8
p.m. and were told that there
would be a two-hour wait. We
then had our choice: a walk on
the cold, windy beach, or a drink
in the bar downstairs. We
opted for the bar.
It was decorated in shades of
blue, with flower-print up
holstered booths and intimate
tables for two. The Fireplace in
the center of the room and the
ocean view completed the picture
perfectly.
We waited for only (!) an hour
and 15 minutes. Fortunately, the
Chart House had prepared for
the hungry crowd, as they sup
plied crackers and other
munchies for us in the bar. (We
went through about three plates
of crackers.)
Our dinner table didn't have
an ocean view, but it wasn't next
to the kitchen either, so we were
content. We received our menu,
which was printed on a wooden
plank. The entrees included
chicken, steak, scallops and two
fresh seafood specials of the day.

Our waiter came to take our
order, enthusiastically telling us
that his name was Rob, and
then told us to be sure to let him
know if we needed anything. We
couldn't be sure, but we thought
that Rob maybe had a little too
much sun that day.
We chose the shrimp teriyaki
($14.25), and steak and lobster
($17.25). Both entrees included
the salad bar, but as starved as we
were, we also ordered clam
chowder ($1.95) and a side order
of sauteed mushrooms ($ 1.95).
We made our trek over to the

ample salad bar and piled our
plates high with lettuce, spinach,
assorted fresh vegetables (includ
ing broccoli, cauliflower and
jicama), cole slaw, potato salad
and fresh fruits. Their salad bar is
definitely a meal in itself.
The clam chowder was some of
the best we had ever tasted or
dering it is a must when you go.
Rob did time our dinners very
well. The shrimp teriyaki, served
on a bed of rice, was delicious.
But, if you order this be sure you
like teriyaki because it had a very
strong teriyaki flavor. The

mushrooms, cooked just right,
were enough for two people
(though 1 somehow managed to
eat them all by myself).
The Chart House proved that
they are not limited to seafood
the steak was cooked specifically
as ordered. It was served with a
large portion of lobster, equally
as succulent.
With our meal, we
bottle of the house chablis from
Riverside Vineyards. We aren t
really wine conoisseurs, but it
complemented the meal.
We couldn't leave without at
least tasting the house specialty
mud pie ($2.50). You can pick
up a recipe on the way out, but
briefly the ingredients include
mocha ice cream, chocolate
wafers, fudge sauce, whipped
cream and nuts. Somehow, no
one makes mud pie quite like the
Chart House. 40
This restaurant definitely de
serves a glowing review, but to all
good things there is a catch. Din
ner for two came to about $5B.
The Chart House is not a restau
rant for every day, but for a spe
cial occasion or a special night
out, it's perfect.
You can also have a less ex
pensive night than we did, as en
trees run from $8.65 for chicken
to $ 18.25 for lobster. The dress is
casual (for the walk on the beach
after dinner), and the clientele
varied from families with chil
dren, to couples on a date,
groups of people celebratinfl
someone's birthday. (I must say
Rob did a find job on "Happy
Birthday" at the table next to us.)
So, the next time you feel like
just getting away, or going out
for a special evening, chart your
course to the Chart House.
