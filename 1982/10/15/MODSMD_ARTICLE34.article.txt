If there were a contest for the restaurant which best imitates the in
ferior of the proverbial wharf-side bar inhabited by old sea salts Mon
ti's would win.
Located far from the sea on El Camino Real in Menlo Park, Mon
ti's combines wharf-side grittiness with the charm of Billy Budd to give
its guests a pleasant dining experience.
The interior reflects this attempt to throw one into a Herman
Melville novel. Well-swabbed oak graces the dining room and the win
dows seem like portholes through the dim light. Its patrons are largely
of the sea-hardened variety who know where to eat good seafood.
The 19th-century effect is given a modern touch, however, by a
sythesizer-toting one-man band who plays to dancing couples in the
accompanying bar. His top-40 tunes filter into the dining room often
enough to cure any sea-sickness caused by an overdose of Melville.
The menu reflects a Mediterranean influence, however. Italian
pastas accompany Crab Cioppino a la Monti (named after the owner,

"Monti" Montalbano, who should win some kind of prize for his
name alone) to complete a menu which provides a broad selection of
shellfish and fish, as well as pasta, meat and salad.
The menu also demonstrates that Monti's is a family restaurant, de
spite its copious fish selection. There are three child's plates and most
of the entrees are in the $lO range.
This reviewer started off with six cherry stone clams to split between
himself and his companion. They were arranged nicely on a low, ice
filled plate with lemon and sauce, but had not been rinsed carefully
enough, and were somewhat sandy.
We then had a large combination seafood salad which was com
posed of crab and shrimp on lettuce with a sweet sauce on top. The
sauce was a bit overpowering, but the crab and shrimp were very good.
This reviewer then had a combination saute shellfish dish composed
of prawns, scallops and crab legs served with rice and vegetables. The
scallops were excellent, the crab legs very good and the prawns medi
ocre. The mushrooms served in the saute dish added a distinctive
flavor. The vegetables and rice were, however, somewhat bland.
My companion had salmon in a lemon and butter saute with vegeta
bles and french fries. The salmon itself was mediocre, but it was cov
ered with a wonderful sauce which complemented it very well.
The service was excellent, and the waitress and the busboys worked
together very well without hovering over the table. Monti himself pa
trolled the dining room with a careful eye.
Monti's is open seven days a week for lunch and dinner.
