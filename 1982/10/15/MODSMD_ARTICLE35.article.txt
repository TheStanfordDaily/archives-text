# Hewlett-Packard to fund EE, comp sci grad students

### SANDRA BODOVITZ 
Hewlett-Packard of Palo Alto an
nounced recently that it will give $6
million in grants and loans to electrical
engineering and computer science grad
uate students at Stanford and nine oth
er universities.
The program has been formulated to
encourage doctoral candidates to teach
after graduation. Hewlett-Packard, an
electronics firm, recognized that a large
number of engineering and computer
science undergraduates will be unable
to pursue graduate work because of un
derstaffed faculty in those departments,
according to Mary Anne Easley, a
spokesman for the American Elec
tronics Association (AEA). Easley
added that, in the long-run, this would
affect companies like Hewlett-Packard
which hire electrical engineering and
computer science Ph.D.s.
The Palo Alto-based AEA is also de
veloping a similar program to provide
loans and grants for graduate students.
Nationwide there is a shortage of fac
ulty in these areas, Easley said. Salaries
for teachers are not competitive with
those that Ph.D.s can earn in private in
dustry, according to Robert White,
chairman of the Electrical Engineering
Department at Stanford.
Irene Miller, assistant chairman of
electrical engineering here, said Stan
ford graduates 60 Ph.D.s a year in elec
trical engineering but she guessed that
less than five go into teaching. Many
foreign students receive Ph.D.s and
then return to their home countries to

teach, she said.
Applicants for the monies from
Hewlett-Packard must be currently en
rolled in a master's program. If appli
cants qualify, funding will be provided
while the applicant completes his mas
ter's and attains his Ph.D. Through the
program, Hewlett-Packard plans to
support 50 doctoral candidates at an.
average cost of $120,000 a student
through 1985. A
Half of this money will be loans ana
half will be grants, said Easley, who
added that the loans of students who;
teach at an American university for
three or more years will be completely
forgiven. Hewlett-Packard wjll also
provide $50,000 for instructional equip
ment to each university where a partici
pant decides to teach, she said.
A University faculty committee will
choose which candidates receive funds,
according to Kaye Storm-Mesa, man
ager of engineering education at the
AEA.
Miller does not see the program sub
stantially affecting Stanford's current
policy. She said Stanford has an ade
quate number of Ph.D. candidates and
faculty, adding that such an abundance
is unique among universities.
The new funds will be one of a
number of grant and loan options avail
able to Stanford electrical engineering
and computer science graduate stu
dents, Miller said.
The department has not yet outlined
how the allocation of funds from
Hewlett-Packard will be conducted.
