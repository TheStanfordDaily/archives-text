Reagan relents on student aid cuts
Washington President Reagan yielded to Congress yesterday and
signed legislation designed to prevent him from cutting federal loans and
grants to nearly 2 million poor and middle-class students under the two big
gest and costliest college aid programs.
The president had tried all year to eliminate some or all federal aid to more
than a third of the 5.5 million students who are now eligible for the loans and
grants. But he agreed to sign the bill with only minor changes when it became
clear that Congress would not cut the politically popular programs in an
election year.
Reagan said, however, that he would not obey a provision allowing either
house of Congress to veto more stringent eligibility rules the administration
might submit in the future.
Attacking the provision as unconstitutional, Reagan said "One house of
congress cannot bind the executive branch by a simple resolution alone."
Reagan had proposed substantial cutbacks in the so-called Pell Grants for
needy students and guaranteed student loans for middle-income students,
two of the fastest-growing programs in the federal budget. But Congress, an
gered by administration delays in carrying out the current program, drafted
the bill to ensure that about the same number of students are eligible for fed
eral aid in the 1983-84 school year, at a cost of more than $6 billion.
The measure restores student aid immediately for up to 50,000 veterans
who were abruptly excluded last year.
The measure also prolongs a long-running dispute over the "legislative
veto," a device by which either house of Congress has overturned a variety of
federal regulations. Reagan supported the legislative veto during his election
campaign, but now opposes it as an infringement on the executive branch.
