Reagan relents on student aid cuts
Washington President Reagan yielded to Congress yesterday and
signed legislation designed to prevent him from cutting federal loans and
grants to nearly 2 million poor and middle-class students under the two big
gest and costliest college aid programs.
The president had tried all year to eliminate some or all federal aid to more
than a third of the 5.5 million students who are now eligible for the loans and
grants. But he agreed to sign the bill with only minor changes when it became
clear that Congress would not cut the politically popular programs in an
election year.
Reagan said, however, that he would not obey a provision allowing either
house of Congress to veto more stringent eligibility rules the administration
might submit in the future.
Attacking the provision as unconstitutional, Reagan said "One house of
congress cannot bind the executive branch by a simple resolution alone."
Reagan had proposed substantial cutbacks in the so-called Pell Grants for
needy students and guaranteed student loans for middle-income students,
two of the fastest-growing programs in the federal budget. But Congress, an
gered by administration delays in carrying out the current program, drafted
the bill to ensure that about the same number of students are eligible for fed
eral aid in the 1983-84 school year, at a cost of more than $6 billion.
The measure restores student aid immediately for up to 50,000 veterans
who were abruptly excluded last year.
The measure also prolongs a long-running dispute over the "legislative
veto," a device by which either house of Congress has overturned a variety of
federal regulations. Reagan supported the legislative veto during his election
campaign, but now opposes it as an infringement on the executive branch.
The new bill requires the Education Department
by next April to submit new eligibility rules for col
lege aid, which then can be vetoed by either
chamber. If the department again fails to produce
the rules on time, Congress would simply extend
the current standards into the 1984-85 school year,
with an adjustment for inflation.
The bill involves no appropriations. But it
means that about two million students next year
will continue to be eligible for Pell Grants up to a
maximum of $lBOO a year.
Based on a complex formula, the grants are
available to families with up to $25,000 in "discre
tionary" income, who then must pay up to a quar
ter of a student's college costs. Reagan wanted to
lower the income ceiling to $lB,OOO and nearly
double a family's required contribution; critics
said this would exclude all but the poorest families.
About 3.5 million students from families earning
under $30,000 will be eligible for guaranteed loans,
which they would repay at 9 percent interest. Fami
lies earning over $30,000 are subject to a "needs
test" that gradually reduces the size of their loans.
Salvador an army strikes back
San Salvador, El Salvador Army troops yes
terday counterattacked against guerrillas who ov
erran government garrisons in two northern prov
inces earlier in the week, but the rebels held their
ground and boasted of heavy government losses.
It was the first big guerrilla offensive since last
spring, when the rebels were mauled trying to dis
rupt the Mar. 28 elections. According to military
sources, the rebels have now been resupplied, in
some cases by air.
The army high command gave no details of gov
ernment losses. The guerrillas said they killed 83
soldiers and captured 107 and seized scores ot au
tomatic weapons plus 20,000 rounds of ammuni
tion.
Area commanders admitted that losses in some
sectors were "heavy."
The offensive began at dawn yesterday in the
northern provinces of Morazan and
Chalatenango, where guerrillas have long had
bases. It was timed to coincide with an attack in
Cabanas Province and with raids that cut the Pan
American and coastal highways linking the capital,
San Salvador, with the southeastern part of the
country.
Military observers said the highway attacks,
part of a campaign to disrupt the Salvadoran econ
omy, were potentially more serious than the battles
in the northern provinces, which are of little eco
nomic importance. Cotton, coffee and sugar cane,
the most important exports, are maturing in the
southeastern farmlands, and farmers will be un
able to move products to market if transportation
is disrupted for long.
Radio Venceremos, the guerrillas' clandestine
transmitter, warned government-owned transport
to stay off the highways yesterday or face attacks
and said that private vehicles will be attacked to

day. The rebels do set up fixed roadblocks, but
strike and then disappear into the hills.
Military observers said that the rebels showed
surprising strength and a well-coordinated plan in
mounting simultaneous attacks in Morazan and
Chalatenango. The government has staged five big
sweeps this year in an attempt to destroy guerrilla
encampments and prevent the kind of build up that
made this week's attacks possible.
In its counterattacks, the army used field artil
lery and A-37 jet attack planes and helicopter gun
ships. It deployed local units plus at least some
companies from its five rapid deployment bat
talions, three of which are U.S.-trained.
More jobless seek benefits
Washington Despite President Reagan's
claim that the nation is "recovery-bound," another
695,000 Americans filed first-time claims for un
employment benefits in the week ending Oct. 2.,
the Labor Department reported yesterday.
It was the second highest filing since the current
recession set in during the late summer of 1981,
falling only 8000 claims short of the record 703,000
initial pleas for government relief that were filed in
the week ending Sept. 18.
The insured unemployment rate the per
centage of the American labor force covered by
benefit payments reached 5.1 percent, the
highest since the 7.0 percent peak of the 1975 re
cession, officials said.
The nation's unemployment rate broke the
double-digit barrier in September, jumping 0.3
percentage point from 9.8 to 10.1 percent of the la
bor force with the jobless rolls approaching 11.3
million.
Emergency jobless benefits provisions attached
to the $98.3 billion tax-increase bill enacted by
Congress in August will provide $2.2 billion in ex
tra unemployment compensation until next March
30.
A complex formula requires a state to meet two
criteria for making the additional benefits avail
able. It must have an insured unemployment rate
of 5.0 percent or higher and its insured jobless rate
must be at least 20 percent higher than that state's
average rate during the same period in the two pre
ceding years.
Fifteen states, according to the figures released
yesterday, failed to meet both tests.
Polish police slay protester
Warsaw, Poland A 20-year-old man died after
being shot by police who opened fire on anti
martial law demonstrators near the southern city
of Krakow Wednesday night, the official PAP
news agency reported yesterday.
It was the first indication that police had used
firearms in violent clashes that had erupted after
demonstrations by workers from the Nowa Huta
steelworks against the dissolution of the Solidarity
independent trade union.
The report followed a warning by Polish author
ities earlier yesterday that this week's protests

against the banning of the independent union
might delay the lifting of martial law.
A tense order was reportedly restored in
Krakow and other Polish cities hit by the most seri
ous strikes and demonstrations.
However, new reports also surfaced of strikes
earlier this week in cities previously thought to be
unaffected bv the protests, and the situation here
remained volatile.
"This country now more than ever is at the
mercv of the irrational," one Western diplomat
said.
The Krakow man is the 17th officially acknowl
edged fatal victim since martial law was imposed
here last Dec. 13.
Martial law chief Gen. Wojciech Jaruzelski has
stated that the regime hopes to lift military rule by
the end of the vear if conditions permit.
The situation also was reported quiet yesterday
in Krakow, Gdansk and Wroclaw. Interpress said
174 persons were detained after police broke up a
demonstration in Wroclaw on Wednesday.
UAW spurns Chrysler proposal
Detroit Final vote totals show that United
Auto Workers members rejected by a 7-3 margin a
proposed contract with Chrysler Corp. that tied
pay increases to profits, the union announced yes
terday.
UAW president Douglas Fraser said meetings
yesterday with the 10-member union-Chrysler
bargaining committee and local union presidents
showed "first and foremost... workers were expec
ting a pay increase up front."
The tally showed 27,140 voting against the pact,
or 70.4 percent, and 11,420 voting for it, or 29.6
percent, in final results from 43 locals. The pact
was the first since 1979 that did not ask for con
cessions.
