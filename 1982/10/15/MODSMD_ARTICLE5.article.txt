## 
### STEVE KAUFMAN Staff Writer 
While citing the need for a better un
derstanding between Eastern and
Western philosophy, Rainer Hagen, an
East German official visiting the cam
pus, last night sidestepped questions
about German unification and East
German influence in Africa.
During the meeting in the Forum
Room of Meyer Undergraduate Li
brary which was attended by a recep
tive crowd of about 40 Rainer called
for a renewal of summit meetings be
tween major world powers.
Hagen stressed that future growth
and security in Europe could only be at
tained through mutual understanding.
"Our interest is to create the best in
ternational conditions to insure a
strong buildup of pur socialist state",
Hagen said. "International under
_ standing of the different social systems
is essential to ensure such conditions."
Hagen has an extensive background
in political science, visiting the United
States on behalf of the Institute for In
ternational Relations, an East German

organization designed to study politics
in various countries. The official, whose
specialty is American domestic and for
eign politics, acts as the liaison between
East Germany and the Stanford-in-Ber
lin Program.
Hagen addressed the need for better
relations with West Germany saying
"The Federal Republic is our third larg
est trading partner and it is in our best
interests to keep strong economic, as
well as political ties."
Yet he claimed talk of reunification
between East and West German is not
realistic, emphasizing the different so
cial systems of the two countries.
Moving to issues farther afield,
Hagen disclaimed any East German
strongholds in Africa, claiming that
their influence was severely limited by
lack of substantial funds. "Our interest
is there," he said, "and we've given as
much support as we can, but we simply
don't have the resources to make any
substantial changes." He cited the vast
amount of wealth here, saying that
American influence abroad is much
more strongly felt.
Hagen, whose talk last night com
pleted his one-month stay in the United
States, discussed the various goals of
the German Democratic Republic's

domestic policies. "We are striving for a
systematic improvement of relations
with the Soviet Union and other so
called Soviet States", he said.
Hagen also reaffirmed the East Ger
man commitment to world peace and
nuclear disarmament. "We acknowl
edge that there is a peace movement in
our country today," he explained, "and

we are glad to give our youth the chance
to express their feelings about peace."
He cautioned against such movements,
claiming that it is easy in a socialist state
to use such movements against the gov
erment. "Care must be exercised," he
said, "to ensure that outside sources
don't use this opportunity to export
revolution."
