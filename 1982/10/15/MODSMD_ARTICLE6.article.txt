# Indirect research expense recovery termed 'divisive'
## 
### MIKE HALE Senior staff writer 
Government reimbursement of the
indirect costs of research, a University
revenue source constantly questioned
in Washington D.C., is no less con
troversial a subject on campus. Stan
ford administrators and researchers
questioned by the Daily agreed that
misunderstandings over indirect cost
recovery damage the research climate
here.
"The issue of overhead is quite
divisive," said Gerald Lieberman, dean
of graduate studies and research. "It
pits faculty against administration."
Indirect cost reimbursements are
government payments made to the Uni
versity to fund facilities and services
that support all research; libraries,
buildings, administrative services, and
the like. They take the form of a sur
charge added to the total of every feder
al contract or grant awarded a Stanford
researcher; the current indirect cost re
covery rate here is 69 percent.
Indirect costs at colleges are rising
while federal budgets hold steady or
shrink, resulting in decreasing amounts
of money available for the direct costs
of research projects. Rep. Berkley
Bedell (D-la.) recently expressed con
cern over the amount of federal money
going into indirect cost recovery (ICR).
Mark Levine, a Bedell staff aide, said
that when the National Institutes of
Health recently threatened to make a 10
percent across-the-board cut in their
ICR payments "researchers were in fa
vor of the move, it was the university
administrators who opposed it."
Faculty and administration members
here generally agreed with Levine's
statement. "I'm not surprised at all that
someone would say that," Lieberman
said. "Faculty see quite correctly that it
(ICR) reduces their monies."
Elwood Pierce, director of opera
tions at the Medical Center, said, "I
would pretty well agree with that
(Levine's) statement," adding that the
loss of ICR funds does not affect faculty
members in the short run.
Researchers questioned by the Daily
supported ICR in principle. Prof. Wil
liam Reynolds, chairman of the Me
chanical Engineering Department, said
many researches do not understahd
that ICR money "isn't overhead, it's a
reimbursement of a true expense. If the
University accepts a lower rate on a
contract as a favor to someone, there's
an expense that's not getting reim
bursedand someone has to pay for

that."
Robert Simoni, assoc. biological sci
ences professor, said he feels "it's quite
appropriate that the University be re
imbursed for indirect costs."
But the researchers question many
aspects of ICR. Several faculty mem
bers commented that not all indirect
costs relate to their research. Reynolds
said engineering researchers receive lit
tle direct benefit from support of the li
brary system, a growing indirect ex
pense. Prof. Stanley Wojciki, chairman
of the Physics Department, said in
physics the benefit to researchers of
ICR "isn't anywhere near as high" as
the 69 percent rate would indicate.
While admitting that some indirect
costs are necessary, Wojciki said, "1
have not seen the justification of the fig
ure; I don't know how realistic it is."
Reynolds also feels the high ICR rate
may be driving research off campus.
Speaking of the impact of ICR on grant
monies, he said, "there's an edge some
where, and at some point you get
pushed off'; when that happens, he
said, a professor will form his own con
sulting company outside the University
and deal with grantors directly.
Simoni expressed the fear that con
stantly expanding ICR rates may be en
dangering the University-federal gov
ernment relationship. He said the high
rates have fostered a perception in gov
ernment that universities are "getting
away with something," and that the re
action to that could be moves against
ICR that would "clobber research."
The University administration shares
this fear, according to Lieberman. "We
are worried that for whatever reason,
government will take some action" and
discontinue ICR payments, he said.
"That's a scenario that can't be dis
missed."
Probably the most common com
plaint among faculty researchers is a
lack of understanding of how indirect
costs are determined and how the ICR
rate is computed. "There's a great deal
of misunderstanding of the University's
policies and of the limitations it faces,"
Reynolds said. David Bacon, associate
director of the Stanford Electronics
Laboratories, said, "I've been hearing
this for the past 25 years the people
doing research feel they haven't been in
formed" on how the rate is determined.
He added that there has been no major
effort on the part of the University to
acquaint researchers with the facts of
ICR.
Lieberman and Pierce acknowledged
the problem, but said they felt the Uni
versity had made an honest effort at
communicating with faculty. While
saying "we could do more, and it would
always be useful," Lieberman cited an
open meeting of the Committee on Re
search recently which only eight faculty
members attended, and Pierce said
there have been many memos sent to
the faculty explaining what ICR money
pays for.
"I think many of them don't take the
time to read the material," he said.
Lieberman said communication was
a problem largely because ICR is "a
very dull subject."
