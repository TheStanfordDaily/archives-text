# Donating blood: a painless experience
## 
### BETH KLEID 
"Kiss me I gave blood today."
So reads a sticker distributed to donators by
the Blood Bank here. The stickers, only part of
the many rewards, both tangible and psy
chological, are offered to the students who
donate blood at the Bank's well-publicized
blood drives.
Rhoda Bums, supervisor of blood donator re
cruitment, said: "Annually we get about 2423
pints of blood from Stanford students alone.
This is a pretty high number, and we are hoping
to increase it by 10 percent this year. The support
of Stanford students is phenomenal, and much
appreciated."
The students who give blood are rewarded
with Mrs. Field's cookies, but there is more to
giving blood than receiving remunerations. The
donors find giving blood to be a satisfying ex
perience. Jeff Carson, a freshmen said, "A lot of
people need blood, but not a lot donate it. I feel
good that I gave blood."
Freshman Jeff Wexler added, "Blood is des
perately needed, and the least I can do to help
out is to donate. I felt a little nervous because it
was my first time donating, but after the needle
went in, it was painless."
Many students who give blood make it a hab
it. Sydney Rice remarked, "The first time I
donated I passed out. It gets easier every time."
Rice, also a freshman has donated three times.
The entire blood-donating process takes less
than an hour. In the first step of the process the
donor fills out a medical history form. Head
nurse of the program, Arlene Bingham noted,
"We have to see if the donor-to-be has had any
diseases in the past, such as hepatitis. We don't
want unhealthy blood."
After the medical history is taken, the donor
lies down on an examining table. The nurses ex

plain exactly what they are going to do before
they do it. The donor's blood pressure, tem
perature and pulse are taken to ensure that they
are good candidates to give blood.
Registered Nurse Mary Lewis commented,
"We check blood pressure and pulse for donor's
own protection. If the pulse is too fast, and if the
blood pressure is too high or too low, we won't
take blood. We also check for iron deficiency in
a sample of blood. It isn't healthy for someone
with low iron to give blood, nor is it good for
anyone to receive it."
Once the preliminaries are done the nurse
searches for a good vein. The nurse proceeds to
make pleasant conversation with the donor to
put him or her at ease. The needle goes into the

vein and blood is drawn until one pint is taken.
The nurses try to be reassuring while commen
ting on the procedure. Nurse Margot Simmons
said to a donor. "Everything is going beau
tifully. I found the vein, but it was trying to get
away from me!"
When the blood collecting bag is full and the
needle is taken out of the arm, the donor rests on
the table for a few minutes. The donors are then
required to stay in the blood bank's canteen for
15 minutes.
The canteen serves cookies and orange juice to
the students, while keeping an eye on their con
dition. Magazines are available to help pass the
time.
Sitting in the canteen, freshman Galen
Hilgard remarked, "I feel fine. I'm not weak at
all and I feel like I could do it again right now."
People between the ages of 17 and 65 are
eligible to donate blood. The minimum weight
for a donor is 110 pounds. Blood donations are
used to treat such diseases as leukemia and
hemophilia which require frequent transfusions.
The demand for blood is extremely high, as is the
demand for donors.
Arlene Bingham noted, "We get a large
number of donations from the student body be
cause the kids are very altruistic they are will
ing to help. There is a little arm twisting in
volved. We do have people recruiting donors,
but in general the students come on their own."
Stanford's Blood Bank has a credit program
in which a donation can be used as a replacement
in a patient's name. The credits can also be used
towards the Kaiser Health plan or the Take Care
blood donor obligation.
Stanford students donate blood for various
reasons. The feeling that a blood donation bene
fits society is rewarding to the donor.
Some donate blood because they have had
friends or relatives who have needed it in the
past, and they have realized the importance of
donating.
Giving blood is easy and relatively painless.
It's a time-out from the daily routine and can
serve as a study break . . . and the free cookies
are always an incentive.
