## Pysch experiments: how they're approved 
### JOHN SAWOSKI 
All of the professors in the psy
chology department here are cur
rentlv engaged in research
projects, with a large number of
students here participating in ex
periments as human subjects. Yet
many students remain unaware
of the system by which experi
ments on human subjects are ap
proved and performed.
Approval of research projects
is not connected to the depart
ment of psychology,according to
Walter Mischel, chairman of the
Psychology Department Re
search proposals describing pos
sible risks, human subjects' im
plications and steps for obtain
ing the informed consent of the
subject must be approved by an
internal review group, called the
Administrative Panel on Human
Subjects in Behavioral Science
Research, before experiments are'
conducted.
Responsibility for the safety of
an experiment rests with the indi
vidual doing the research and the
Human Subjects Panel, follow
ing guidelines established by
both the panel and national or
ganizations (like the National In
stitute of Mental Health, which
funds many experiments per
formed here).
The wide range of interests
represented on the panel pro
vides not only scientific review
but also multi-disciplinary ethics
review of research proposals, ac
cording to the chair of the panel,
Patricia Barchas, assistant pro
fessor of sociology.

Along with faculty from vari
ous University departments, a
student representative and com
munity experts, there are two
"public" members on the panel,
in order to represent the interests
and values of concerned citizens
from the entire community. The
panel meets monthly to discuss
and review research proposals
from investigators in various de
partments.
Barchas said one of the main
issues debated is obtaining the
"informed consent" .of the sub
ject. This means the subject must
realiza'that he is doing the re
searcher a favor and is free to
complain or withdraw at any
time.
In order to ensure this, two
consent forms are sometimes re
quired. First the subject signs a
pre-consent form giving the in
vestigator permission to perform
the experiment, and later when
the experiment is completed the
subject then has the option of
signing a post-consent form al
lowing investigators to use the in
formation obtained. This is often
necessary to preserve a subject's
anonymity when case studies or
photographs are published.
In some situations, however,
no consent form is required. In a
recent study on language de
velopment in children in local
elementary schools, only
"positive consent" (absence of
negative consent) was necessary.
Students simply were given no
tices to take home to their pa
rents.

Another key issue discussed by
the panel is whether a study will
put the human subject "at risk."
Often the panel brings in outside
experts to explain the seriousness
of experimental risks more fully.
For instance, a recent proposal
necessitated bringing in an expert
on the dangers of hypnotism. De
pending on the amount of risk,
the panel may delay research
projects until procedures are
changed.
According to Herbert Clark,
psychology department repre
sentative on the panel, "you're
your own boss" in psychological
research projects here, as long as
you comply with the standards of
the panel. Clark said the panel
does not restrict research, but
that he could not recall a single
case of highly dangerous or
abusive experimentation pro
posed. According to Barchas,
very few persons ever withdraw
from experiments.
The Human Subjects Panel has
jurisdiction in three areas. The
First of these is in laboratory stud
ies, where a major issue is decep
tion. Clark calls the use of decep
tion a "last recourse." It is only
used when absolutely necessary,
and the group may disapprove
experiments involving deception.
The second area in which the
panel has jurisdiction is behav
ioral experiments in the com
munity. Barchas said the impor
tant issues in this area are mostly
political and social.

"Confidentiality is also impor
tant in research dealing with sen
sitive issues in the community
for instance an investigation of a
cult, a study of battered wives in
the community, studies on dif
ferent lifestyles, divorce and al
ternative marriage structures,"
she said.
The third area under con
sideration of the panel is experi
ments performed outside of the
United States. Political issues
especially important in studies in
South America. Barchas said the
panel has become more cautious
in recent years about the sensi
tivity of different political fac
tions there and their possible re
actions to investigations.
In the area of undergraduate
students' research and studies,
Barchas said the faculty bears re
sponsibility for most experiments
performed. In many cases,
ever, students' original researcW
ideas must be approved by the
panel members. Students are
generally not required to perform
or participate in experiments, but
many do because of the possible
rewards excitement, educa
tion and money.
A wide variety of research
projects are being conducted now
by the Psychology Department.
Most of these are paid for by
grants. According to Clark, there
is a cycle of research. "If you do
good research, you get grants,
which allows you to do more
search, and so on." ™

subject must be approved by an
internal review group, called the
Administrative Panel on Human
Subjects in Behavioral Science
Research, before experiments are'
conducted.
Responsibility for the safety of
an experiment rests with the indi
vidual doing the research and the
Human Subjects Panel, follow
ing guidelines established by
both the panel and national or
ganizations (like the National In
stitute of Mental Health, which
funds many experiments per
formed here).
The wide range of interests
represented on the panel pro
vides not only scientific review
but also multi-disciplinary ethics
review of research proposals, ac
cording to the chair of the panel,
Patricia Barchas, assistant pro
fessor of sociology.

Along with faculty from vari
ous University departments, a
student representative and com
munity experts, there are two
"public" members on the panel,
in order to represent the interests
and values of concerned citizens
from the entire community. The
panel meets monthly to discuss
and review research proposals
from investigators in various de
partments.
Barchas said one of the main
issues debated is obtaining the
"informed consent" .of the sub
ject. This means the subject must
realiza'that he is doing the re
searcher a favor and is free to
complain or withdraw at any
time.
In order to ensure this, two
consent forms are sometimes re
quired. First the subject signs a
pre-consent form giving the in
vestigator permission to perform
the experiment, and later when
the experiment is completed the
subject then has the option of
signing a post-consent form al
lowing investigators to use the in
formation obtained. This is often
necessary to preserve a subject's
anonymity when case studies or
photographs are published.
In some situations, however,
no consent form is required. In a
recent study on language de
velopment in children in local
elementary schools, only
"positive consent" (absence of
negative consent) was necessary.
Students simply were given no
tices to take home to their pa
rents.

Another key issue discussed by
the panel is whether a study will
put the human subject "at risk."
Often the panel brings in outside
experts to explain the seriousness
of experimental risks more fully.
For instance, a recent proposal
necessitated bringing in an expert
on the dangers of hypnotism. De
pending on the amount of risk,
the panel may delay research
projects until procedures are
changed.
According to Herbert Clark,
psychology department repre
sentative on the panel, "you're
your own boss" in psychological
research projects here, as long as
you comply with the standards of
the panel. Clark said the panel
does not restrict research, but
that he could not recall a single
case of highly dangerous or
abusive experimentation pro
posed. According to Barchas,
very few persons ever withdraw
from experiments.
The Human Subjects Panel has
jurisdiction in three areas. The
First of these is in laboratory stud
ies, where a major issue is decep
tion. Clark calls the use of decep
tion a "last recourse." It is only
used when absolutely necessary,
and the group may disapprove
experiments involving deception.
The second area in which the
panel has jurisdiction is behav
ioral experiments in the com
munity. Barchas said the impor
tant issues in this area are mostly
political and social.

"Confidentiality is also impor
tant in research dealing with sen
sitive issues in the community
for instance an investigation of a
cult, a study of battered wives in
the community, studies on dif
ferent lifestyles, divorce and al
ternative marriage structures,"
she said.
The third area under con
sideration of the panel is experi
ments performed outside of the
United States. Political issues
especially important in studies in
South America. Barchas said the
panel has become more cautious
in recent years about the sensi
tivity of different political fac
tions there and their possible re
actions to investigations.
In the area of undergraduate
students' research and studies,
Barchas said the faculty bears re
sponsibility for most experiments
performed. In many cases,
ever, students' original researcW
ideas must be approved by the
panel members. Students are
generally not required to perform
or participate in experiments, but
many do because of the possible
rewards excitement, educa
tion and money.
A wide variety of research
projects are being conducted now
by the Psychology Department.
Most of these are paid for by
grants. According to Clark, there
is a cycle of research. "If you do
good research, you get grants,
which allows you to do more
search, and so on." ™
All of the professors in the psy
chology department here are cur
rentlv engaged in research
projects, with a large number of
students here participating in ex
periments as human subjects. Yet
many students remain unaware
of the system by which experi
ments on human subjects are ap
proved and performed.
Approval of research projects
is not connected to the depart
ment of psychology,according to
Walter Mischel, chairman of the
Psychology Department Re

sible risks, human subjects' im
