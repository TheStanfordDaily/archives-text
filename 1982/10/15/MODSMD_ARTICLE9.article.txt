# Computers in dorm rooms offer convenience
## 
### MARK GILLIS 
Even though the computer system in
CERAS has recently been expanded to twice
its original capabilities, the terminals are nor
mally crowded long into the night, and the
wait can last for hours.
But many resourceful students have gotten
around this problem by installing computers
of their own in their ,dorm rooms. Though
their reasons vary somewhat, many students
feel having their own computers is advan
tageous in that they have time to do computer
work according to their own interests.
Most students who have computers in their
rooms said that the primary reason they need
one is for the businesses who pay them to do
part-time work. They continue to work in
their rooms for employers who hired them in
the summer and wanted them to work while
at school. •>
Terry Weinman, a sophomore at Storey
House who fias a terminal in his room which
was lent to him by his summer employer said,

"I have a terminal just like at LOTS for my
work, but it's mine." Such part-time work is
good experience, because many of the stu
dents who have computers also have ambi
tions toward computer careers or a career in
which computer use is beneficial.
Computers in dorm rooms have the added
advantages of unlimited computer time and
convenience. LOTS has an allocation system
in which those needing to work on a terminal
get a limited amount of time, and such restric
tions on time often prevent students from
having the opportunity to do anything but
their class work.
"A home computer can be of social value,"
claims Chris McConnell, a sophomore in
Lagunita, "my computer was an excellent
conversation starter during my freshman
year." He was able to oblige his dorm mates
by letting them use it for word processing and
for video games. Even his resident fellow
would occasionally visit him to try the video
games.

"I would have bought one even if I didn't
work with it," he said.
"Another advantage to having your own
system is that you can use it to contact other
systems by phone," stressed Christian Valen
tine, a sophomore in Kappa Sig. "My house
has a small central Commodore system which
I use with my terminal." By being a meifrber
of some data systems, Valentine can contact
them as well as LOTS to use the computer by
phone. "In the future," he predicted, "the
computer will probably be standard in most
homes." .
Harry Coin, a graduate student in com-,
puter science, said,"home computers can be®
useful as a supplement to LOTS," but that
they were slower in executing programs and
in fact could not run certain types of pro
grams.
The possibility of having a computer or a
terminal in your room in not really im
plausible, though many of those interviewed
do not own the equipment they keep.
