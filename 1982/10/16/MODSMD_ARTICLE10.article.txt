# Card-Trojan rivalry strong, despite Trojan dominance
## 
### LISA STERN 
USC. The mere mention of
those three letters conjurs up vi
sions of a football dynasty in the
minds of college gridiron fans ev
erywhere. Never mind academ
ics. USC has Traveler, the Trojan
horse, and tanned pom-pon girls
in white outfits with gold initials
emblazened on their chests. And
every fan who's worth his salt in
football trivia can list the players
included in the USC tailback
tradition: Mike Garrett, O.J.
Simpson, Anthony Davis,
Charles White and last year's
Heisman trophy winner, Marcus
Allen.
Yet, the University of South
ern California's football tradi
tion implies more than simply the
trappings of gold and crimson or
the famous athletes who once
walked the Los Angeles campus.
Indeed, USC signifies an aura of
winning. And as the 1982 squaid
and some 20,000 expected
boosters travel north to Stanford
Stadium this weekend, they bring
with them a record of dominance
over the Cardinal.

In the 62 previous meetings be
tween the two teams, the Trojans
lead the series 38-21-3. In fact,
the Card's last victory came in
1975 in Los Angeles Collosium.
Stanford last defeated its Pac-10
rival on the Farm in 1970 on the
way to an eventual Rose Bowl
berth. The closest the Cardinal
has come to beating USC since
1975 was in 1979 when Stanford
came from behind to tie the Tro
jans 21-21.
After a one-week hiatus, USC
will arrive in Palo Alto with a 3-1

overall record and a 1-0 mark in
conference play. The Trojans,
who are ranked 14th in the AP
Top Twenty this week will face a
disappointed 3-2 Cardinal squad.
Stanford is tied for fourth place
in the Pac-10 conference after los
ing to Arizona St. in the closing
seconds last weekend.
History will decide if this
year's matchup will be as memo
rable as these classic battles from
previous seasons.
1970
In 1970, the Stanford-USC
game began with a horrifying
twist: two bomb notes, threaten
ing the safety of the 90,000 fans in
the Stanford Stadium, were
found in San Francisco and Palo
Alto. After warnings were issued
over the public address system
and police examined the personal
possessions of fans as they en
tered the stands, University Pres
ident Richard Lyman told the
crowd, ". . . blackmail and
threats must not be allowed to
paralyze a nation or an institu
tion."
Head Coach John Ralston's
football squad certainly took
Lvman at his word as they
mobilized troops for a crushing
victory over the Trojans, 24-14.
Senior quarterback Jim Plunkett,
who became the only player ever
to bring the Heisman Trophy
back to the Farm, passed for 275
yards. The Indians (as they were
called then) stopped USC twice
on fourth-and-one situations in
side their own three-yard line to
win the game and take control of
first place in the Pac-8 on the way
to the Rose Bowl.

1975
Four years and three frustrat
ing losses later, Stanford
pounded USC on their home turf
in Los Angeles by a score of
13-10. Squashing the hopes of
Trojan fans who chanted "We'll
survive in '75," the Cardinal
slipped by then ninth-ranked
USC with a last second, 37-yard
field goal by Mike Langford.
Stanford Head Coach Jack
Christiansen told reporters to
"give credit for this win to the de
fense," but the real hero in the
game was a junior back-up quar
terback named Guy Benjamin,
who substituted for starter Mike
Cordova early in the second
quarter. Benjamin completed 15
of 29 pass attempts for 161 yards
as he led the Card down the
length of the field in the last 59
seconds for the winning score.
The bright spot for the Trojans
was the play of national rushing
leader Ricky Bell, who delighted
the partisan crowd by tromping
195 yards in 35 carries. But, as
Trojan Head Coach John
McKay quipped after the defeat,
USC beat themselves. "They just
came right through, and we hit
them with our press clippings."
1977
Stanford got hit with a lot
more than Southern Cal's nu
merous press clippings in 1977
when the Trojans rolled over the
Card 49-0 in Los Angeles. A pre
game deluge of rain which hit the
stadium seemed to foreshadow
the impending doom for the
Cardinal as USC rushed for 453
yards and five touchdowns in
drenching their hapless oppo
nents.

The Trojans, ranked number
one in pre-season polls, carried a
21-0 advantage into the locker
room at halftime and built upon
their lead in the second half by
scoring four unanswered touch
downs with third and fourth
string players. USC intercepted
four Guy Benjamin tosses and
held freshman running sensation
Darrin Nelson to 22 yards in nine
carries as the Trojans extin
guished the Card offense.
The victory, which was the
greatest ever by USC over Stan
ford, moved the Trojans into a
three-way tie with UCLA and
Washington for first place in the
Pac-8. "They played USC foot
ball," one Cardinal player ex
plained, "and we just had one of
those days where everything goes
wrong."
Everything.
1979
Stanford came into Los Angel
es Collisium in 1979 as a three
touchdown underdog. They left,
however, with a satisfying 21-21
come-from-behind tie, good
enough to knock the Trojans out
of their first place rank in the wire
service polls. After trailing 21-0
at halftime, Stanford brushed off

the dirt and proceded to domi
nate physically USC in the sec
ond half. Senior quarterback
Turk Schonert led the Cardinal
offense for over 20 minutes of
playing time in the second half
while passing for two touch
downs and running ten yards for
the tying score.

With 53 seconds left in the
game, Stanford, on the Trojans'
29-vard line, looked like they
were about to score the upset of
the season. But Card kicking sen
sation Ken Naber missed the
field goal and Stanford kissed its
Pac-10 sister in a game which
Head Coach Rod Dowhower
called, "a victory for the players
and the program."
1981
Last year in the Los Angeles
Collosium, Stanford, trailing
25-3 at the beginning of the
fourth quarter, scared the Tro
jans by scoring two unanswered
touchdowns in the final 15
minutes of play. Although the
Cardinal comeback effort fell
short, the Stanford offense out
gained USC by 135 yards irt the
•second half as AlLAmerica quar

terback John Elway threw for
235 yards and two touchdown
tosses to flanker Mike Tolliver.
The Cardinal defense became
the first unit to hold Heisman
Trophy candidate (and eventual
winner) Marcus Allen to less
than 200 yards on the ground.
Stanford managed to stop the
USC rushing attack, limiting the
Trojans to a mere 188 yards in 48
carries. ————————

Stadium this weekend, they bring
with them a record of dominance
over the Cardinal.

In the 62 previous meetings be
tween the two teams, the Trojans
lead the series 38-21-3. In fact,
the Card's last victory came in
1975 in Los Angeles Collosium.
Stanford last defeated its Pac-10
rival on the Farm in 1970 on the
way to an eventual Rose Bowl
berth. The closest the Cardinal
has come to beating USC since
1975 was in 1979 when Stanford
came from behind to tie the Tro
jans 21-21.
After a one-week hiatus, USC
will arrive in Palo Alto with a 3-1

overall record and a 1-0 mark in
conference play. The Trojans,
who are ranked 14th in the AP
Top Twenty this week will face a
disappointed 3-2 Cardinal squad.
Stanford is tied for fourth place
in the Pac-10 conference after los
ing to Arizona St. in the closing
seconds last weekend.
History will decide if this
year's matchup will be as memo
rable as these classic battles from
previous seasons.
1970
In 1970, the Stanford-USC
game began with a horrifying
twist: two bomb notes, threaten
ing the safety of the 90,000 fans in
the Stanford Stadium, were
found in San Francisco and Palo
Alto. After warnings were issued
over the public address system
and police examined the personal
possessions of fans as they en
tered the stands, University Pres
ident Richard Lyman told the
crowd, ". . . blackmail and
threats must not be allowed to
paralyze a nation or an institu
tion."
Head Coach John Ralston's
football squad certainly took
Lvman at his word as they
mobilized troops for a crushing
victory over the Trojans, 24-14.
Senior quarterback Jim Plunkett,
who became the only player ever
to bring the Heisman Trophy
back to the Farm, passed for 275
yards. The Indians (as they were
called then) stopped USC twice
on fourth-and-one situations in
side their own three-yard line to
win the game and take control of
first place in the Pac-8 on the way
to the Rose Bowl.

1975
Four years and three frustrat
ing losses later, Stanford
pounded USC on their home turf
in Los Angeles by a score of
13-10. Squashing the hopes of
Trojan fans who chanted "We'll
survive in '75," the Cardinal
slipped by then ninth-ranked
USC with a last second, 37-yard
field goal by Mike Langford.
Stanford Head Coach Jack
Christiansen told reporters to
"give credit for this win to the de
fense," but the real hero in the
game was a junior back-up quar
terback named Guy Benjamin,
who substituted for starter Mike
Cordova early in the second
quarter. Benjamin completed 15
of 29 pass attempts for 161 yards
as he led the Card down the
length of the field in the last 59
seconds for the winning score.
The bright spot for the Trojans
was the play of national rushing
leader Ricky Bell, who delighted
the partisan crowd by tromping
195 yards in 35 carries. But, as
Trojan Head Coach John
McKay quipped after the defeat,
USC beat themselves. "They just
came right through, and we hit
them with our press clippings."
1977
Stanford got hit with a lot
more than Southern Cal's nu
merous press clippings in 1977
when the Trojans rolled over the
Card 49-0 in Los Angeles. A pre
game deluge of rain which hit the
stadium seemed to foreshadow
the impending doom for the
Cardinal as USC rushed for 453
yards and five touchdowns in
drenching their hapless oppo
nents.

The Trojans, ranked number
one in pre-season polls, carried a
21-0 advantage into the locker
room at halftime and built upon
their lead in the second half by
scoring four unanswered touch
downs with third and fourth
string players. USC intercepted
four Guy Benjamin tosses and
held freshman running sensation
Darrin Nelson to 22 yards in nine
carries as the Trojans extin
guished the Card offense.
The victory, which was the
greatest ever by USC over Stan
ford, moved the Trojans into a
three-way tie with UCLA and
Washington for first place in the
Pac-8. "They played USC foot
ball," one Cardinal player ex
plained, "and we just had one of
those days where everything goes
wrong."
Everything.
1979
Stanford came into Los Angel
es Collisium in 1979 as a three
touchdown underdog. They left,
however, with a satisfying 21-21
come-from-behind tie, good
enough to knock the Trojans out
of their first place rank in the wire
service polls. After trailing 21-0
at halftime, Stanford brushed off

the dirt and proceded to domi
nate physically USC in the sec
ond half. Senior quarterback
Turk Schonert led the Cardinal
offense for over 20 minutes of
playing time in the second half
while passing for two touch
downs and running ten yards for
the tying score.

With 53 seconds left in the
game, Stanford, on the Trojans'
29-vard line, looked like they
were about to score the upset of
the season. But Card kicking sen
sation Ken Naber missed the
field goal and Stanford kissed its
Pac-10 sister in a game which
Head Coach Rod Dowhower
called, "a victory for the players
and the program."
1981
Last year in the Los Angeles
Collosium, Stanford, trailing
25-3 at the beginning of the
fourth quarter, scared the Tro
jans by scoring two unanswered
touchdowns in the final 15
minutes of play. Although the
Cardinal comeback effort fell
short, the Stanford offense out
gained USC by 135 yards irt the
•second half as AlLAmerica quar

terback John Elway threw for
235 yards and two touchdown
tosses to flanker Mike Tolliver.
The Cardinal defense became
the first unit to hold Heisman
Trophy candidate (and eventual
winner) Marcus Allen to less
than 200 yards on the ground.
Stanford managed to stop the
USC rushing attack, limiting the
Trojans to a mere 188 yards in 48
carries. ————————

USC. The mere mention of
those three letters conjurs up vi
sions of a football dynasty in the
minds of college gridiron fans ev
erywhere. Never mind academ
ics. USC has Traveler, the Trojan
horse, and tanned pom-pon girls
in white outfits with gold initials
emblazened on their chests. And
every fan who's worth his salt in
football trivia can list the players
included in the USC tailback
tradition: Mike Garrett, O.J.
Simpson, Anthony Davis,
Charles White and last year's
Heisman trophy winner, Marcus
Allen.

in the Pac-10 conference after los
ing to Arizona St. in the closing
seconds last weekend.
History will decide if this
year's matchup will be as memo
rable as these classic battles from
previous seasons.
1970
In 1970, the Stanford-USC
game began with a horrifying
twist: two bomb notes, threaten
ing the safety of the 90,000 fans in
the Stanford Stadium, were
found in San Francisco and Palo
Alto. After warnings were issued
over the public address system
and police examined the personal
possessions of fans as they en
tered the stands, University Pres
ident Richard Lyman told the
crowd, ". . . blackmail and
threats must not be allowed to
paralyze a nation or an institu
tion."
Head Coach John Ralston's
football squad certainly took
Lvman at his word as they
mobilized troops for a crushing
victory over the Trojans, 24-14.
Senior quarterback Jim Plunkett,
who became the only player ever
to bring the Heisman Trophy
back to the Farm, passed for 275
yards. The Indians (as they were
called then) stopped USC twice
on fourth-and-one situations in
side their own three-yard line to
win the game and take control of
first place in the Pac-8 on the way
to the Rose Bowl.

1975
Four years and three frustrat
ing losses later, Stanford
pounded USC on their home turf
in Los Angeles by a score of
13-10. Squashing the hopes of
Trojan fans who chanted "We'll
survive in '75," the Cardinal
slipped by then ninth-ranked
USC with a last second, 37-yard
field goal by Mike Langford.
Stanford Head Coach Jack
Christiansen told reporters to
"give credit for this win to the de
fense," but the real hero in the
game was a junior back-up quar
terback named Guy Benjamin,
who substituted for starter Mike
Cordova early in the second
quarter. Benjamin completed 15
of 29 pass attempts for 161 yards
as he led the Card down the
length of the field in the last 59
seconds for the winning score.
The bright spot for the Trojans
was the play of national rushing
leader Ricky Bell, who delighted
the partisan crowd by tromping
195 yards in 35 carries. But, as
Trojan Head Coach John
McKay quipped after the defeat,
USC beat themselves. "They just
came right through, and we hit
them with our press clippings."
1977
Stanford got hit with a lot
more than Southern Cal's nu
merous press clippings in 1977
when the Trojans rolled over the
Card 49-0 in Los Angeles. A pre
game deluge of rain which hit the
stadium seemed to foreshadow
the impending doom for the
Cardinal as USC rushed for 453
yards and five touchdowns in
drenching their hapless oppo
nents.

The Trojans, ranked number
one in pre-season polls, carried a
21-0 advantage into the locker
room at halftime and built upon
their lead in the second half by
scoring four unanswered touch
downs with third and fourth
string players. USC intercepted
four Guy Benjamin tosses and
held freshman running sensation
Darrin Nelson to 22 yards in nine
carries as the Trojans extin
guished the Card offense.
The victory, which was the
greatest ever by USC over Stan
ford, moved the Trojans into a
three-way tie with UCLA and
Washington for first place in the
Pac-8. "They played USC foot
ball," one Cardinal player ex
plained, "and we just had one of
those days where everything goes
wrong."
Everything.
1979
Stanford came into Los Angel
es Collisium in 1979 as a three
touchdown underdog. They left,
however, with a satisfying 21-21
come-from-behind tie, good
enough to knock the Trojans out
of their first place rank in the wire
service polls. After trailing 21-0
at halftime, Stanford brushed off

the dirt and proceded to domi
nate physically USC in the sec
ond half. Senior quarterback
Turk Schonert led the Cardinal
offense for over 20 minutes of
playing time in the second half
while passing for two touch
downs and running ten yards for
the tying score.

With 53 seconds left in the
game, Stanford, on the Trojans'
29-vard line, looked like they
were about to score the upset of
the season. But Card kicking sen
sation Ken Naber missed the
field goal and Stanford kissed its
Pac-10 sister in a game which
Head Coach Rod Dowhower
called, "a victory for the players
and the program."
1981
Last year in the Los Angeles
Collosium, Stanford, trailing
25-3 at the beginning of the
fourth quarter, scared the Tro
jans by scoring two unanswered
touchdowns in the final 15
minutes of play. Although the
Cardinal comeback effort fell
short, the Stanford offense out
gained USC by 135 yards irt the
•second half as AlLAmerica quar

terback John Elway threw for
235 yards and two touchdown
tosses to flanker Mike Tolliver.
The Cardinal defense became
the first unit to hold Heisman
Trophy candidate (and eventual
winner) Marcus Allen to less
than 200 yards on the ground.
Stanford managed to stop the
USC rushing attack, limiting the
Trojans to a mere 188 yards in 48
carries. ————————
