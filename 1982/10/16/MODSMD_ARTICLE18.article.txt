# Salisbury gives USC offense a new look
## 
### MARK ZEIGLER 
The first time Sean Salisbury
carried a football in a tackle
game, he fractured his little finger
and was forced to sit out the re
mainder of the season.

"I swore I would never play
football again," he said, looking
back on that, his freshman year
in high school. Fortunately, as
far as coach John Robinson and
his USC Trojan football team are
concerned, Salisbury didn't live
up to his words.
Salisbury, also proficient in
baseball and basketball, was con
vinced to return to the gridiron as
a sophomore. Four years later,
he is still playing football. In fact,
though only a sophomore,
Salisbury will start his fifth game
as the Trojans' signal-caller this
afternoon.
In leading USC to a 3-1 record,
the Trojan QB has done all that
has been expected of him and
more. The 6-5 Vi, 210 pound
Salisbury has completed 47 of his
81 passes (58 percent) for 618
yards and four TD's. Despite dis
playing first game jitters in the
form of three interceptions dur
ing the Trojans' 17-9 loss to Flor
ida, Salisbury hasn't thrown one
to the other side since.
Robinson sees all the elements
of greatness tall, throws
hard, good touch and good in
stinct to avoid the pass rush.
"Sean has enormous potential
and his future is unlimited ... I
believe he also has that intangible

quality that all great quarter
backs have."
After taking the backseat to
John Mazur last year, Salisbury
beat out the 6-3, 200-pound
southpaw last spring. Coach
Robinson called their competi
tion "as fierce as I've ever seen on
the practice field."
Realizing there was room for
just one starting quarterback,
Mazur, also a sophomore aca
demically, transfered to Texas A
& M.
"I was never afraid to compete
(for the starting job)," Salisbury
said. "I knew it was going to be
tough. We both went out and did
the best job we could." Salisbury
won, Mazur lost the case is
closed.

With Salisbury, the Trojans'
have a more versatile offense
than in past years. In fact, so bal
anced are Robinson's running
and passing attacks in 1982 that
the Trojans average 198 yards a
game in both areas.
All-everything at Orange Glen
High in Escondido, Salisbury
was a unanimous prep football
All-America while being named
San Diego County Player of the
Year in 1979. In basketball, he
was an All-CIF San Diego Coun
ty choice two years in a row while
hitting .300 as an outfielder and a
pitcher on the baseball team. Col
lege recruiters could have been
mistaken for seagulls, they were
in such abundance.
"When you come out of high

school, you look at the place you
love," he said. Though he put in
stints in Ohio and Arizona,
Salisbury* was born in Long
Beach and considers Southern
California his home. USC was an
obvious choice.
"I wanted to come to a school
that was a winner," he explained.
Salisbury also wants to play in
the Rose Bowl, aspirations that
have been temporarily put on
hold due to USC's two-year pro
bation, which bars it from post
season competition. "It's some
thing that really doesn't bother
me now," he commented. "You
can't look back on it.
"I'll get my chance sometime.
And if I don't, that's 0.K.," he
continued.
In the meantime, Salisbury's
eyes are focused on Stanford, es
pecially the Cardinal's defense.
"I respect the heck out of
them. They may be young, but
that doesn't matter," the Trojan
sophomore said. "They're young
and they're eager. I just think we
have to go out and play four
quarters of good football to
win."

Without a doubt the Card
player Salisbury respects the
most is quarterback John Elway.
"I think he's the best there is (on
the college level),"
Salisberry praised, passing out
Elwav verbal accolades like they
were rock candy. "He's a great
guv to pattern yourself after."
Elwav, you see, is Salisbury's
idol as far as college QB's are
concerned. In the pro ranks, the
call goes to Joe Namath.
Nevertheless, Troy's signal
caller will take a few hours off
from admiring Mr. Elway today.
"I'll bv no means do that (idol
izing) this Saturday. I've got my
own team to worry about," he
said.
One similarity between
Salisbury and Elway besides both
being tall and throwing hard is
that the two began starting as
sophomores. A quick look at

Elway's career stats indicates
what can be done in three years
time. But breaking records isn't
in Salisbury's bag of tricks.

"Records don't mean much to
me," he noted. "I'd sure be disap
pointed if I broke a record and we
lost."
Winning academically is also
important to Salisbury. "I'm
going to get my degree that's
the most important thing. You
can't play football forever, al
though I'd like to play pro foot
ball."
A communications major spe
cializing in braodcast journalism,
the Trojan sophomore has set his

sights on a post-footbali career as
a sports announcer. Salisbury
has idols in that field as well
ABC's Keith Jackson.
Another goal of Salisbury's is
to play all three major sports in
college football, basketball and
baseball. He has been quoted as
saying he wants to do it "just to
show that it can be done at a ma
jor university." But despite his
success in the sports world, espe
cially on the football field,
Salisbury remains as humble as
possible: "I'm just an average
quarterback that needs 100 per
cent improvement."

THE NEW LOOK AT USC: USC features its most balanced
attack in years, much of it due to sophomore quarterback Sean
Salisbury. One of the most highly recruited quarterbacks in the
nation out of high school, Salisbury and the USC offense are
averaging 198 yards in the air and 198 on the ground for an
almost perfect balance.
The first time Sean Salisbury
carried a football in a tackle
game, he fractured his little finger
and was forced to sit out the re
mainder of the season.

"I swore I would never play
football again," he said, looking
back on that, his freshman year
in high school. Fortunately, as
far as coach John Robinson and
his USC Trojan football team are
concerned, Salisbury didn't live
up to his words.
Salisbury, also proficient in
baseball and basketball, was con
vinced to return to the gridiron as
a sophomore. Four years later,
he is still playing football. In fact,
though only a sophomore,
Salisbury will start his fifth game
as the Trojans' signal-caller this
afternoon.
In leading USC to a 3-1 record,
the Trojan QB has done all that
has been expected of him and
more. The 6-5 Vi, 210 pound
Salisbury has completed 47 of his
81 passes (58 percent) for 618
yards and four TD's. Despite dis
playing first game jitters in the
form of three interceptions dur
ing the Trojans' 17-9 loss to Flor
ida, Salisbury hasn't thrown one
to the other side since.
Robinson sees all the elements
of greatness tall, throws
hard, good touch and good in
stinct to avoid the pass rush.
"Sean has enormous potential
and his future is unlimited ... I
believe he also has that intangible

quality that all great quarter
backs have."
After taking the backseat to
John Mazur last year, Salisbury
beat out the 6-3, 200-pound
southpaw last spring. Coach
Robinson called their competi
tion "as fierce as I've ever seen on
the practice field."
Realizing there was room for
just one starting quarterback,
Mazur, also a sophomore aca
demically, transfered to Texas A
& M.
"I was never afraid to compete
(for the starting job)," Salisbury
said. "I knew it was going to be
tough. We both went out and did
the best job we could." Salisbury
won, Mazur lost the case is
closed.

With Salisbury, the Trojans'
have a more versatile offense
than in past years. In fact, so bal
anced are Robinson's running
and passing attacks in 1982 that
the Trojans average 198 yards a
game in both areas.
All-everything at Orange Glen
High in Escondido, Salisbury
was a unanimous prep football
All-America while being named
San Diego County Player of the
Year in 1979. In basketball, he
was an All-CIF San Diego Coun
ty choice two years in a row while
hitting .300 as an outfielder and a
pitcher on the baseball team. Col
lege recruiters could have been
mistaken for seagulls, they were
in such abundance.
"When you come out of high

school, you look at the place you
love," he said. Though he put in
stints in Ohio and Arizona,
Salisbury* was born in Long
Beach and considers Southern
California his home. USC was an
obvious choice.
"I wanted to come to a school
that was a winner," he explained.
Salisbury also wants to play in
the Rose Bowl, aspirations that
have been temporarily put on
hold due to USC's two-year pro
bation, which bars it from post
season competition. "It's some
thing that really doesn't bother
me now," he commented. "You
can't look back on it.
"I'll get my chance sometime.
And if I don't, that's 0.K.," he
continued.
In the meantime, Salisbury's
eyes are focused on Stanford, es
pecially the Cardinal's defense.
"I respect the heck out of
them. They may be young, but
that doesn't matter," the Trojan
sophomore said. "They're young
and they're eager. I just think we
have to go out and play four
quarters of good football to
win."

Without a doubt the Card
player Salisbury respects the
most is quarterback John Elway.
"I think he's the best there is (on
the college level),"
Salisberry praised, passing out
Elwav verbal accolades like they
were rock candy. "He's a great
guv to pattern yourself after."
Elwav, you see, is Salisbury's
idol as far as college QB's are
concerned. In the pro ranks, the
call goes to Joe Namath.
Nevertheless, Troy's signal
caller will take a few hours off
from admiring Mr. Elway today.
"I'll bv no means do that (idol
izing) this Saturday. I've got my
own team to worry about," he
said.
One similarity between
Salisbury and Elway besides both
being tall and throwing hard is
that the two began starting as
sophomores. A quick look at

Elway's career stats indicates
what can be done in three years
time. But breaking records isn't
in Salisbury's bag of tricks.

"Records don't mean much to
me," he noted. "I'd sure be disap
pointed if I broke a record and we
lost."
Winning academically is also
important to Salisbury. "I'm
going to get my degree that's
the most important thing. You
can't play football forever, al
though I'd like to play pro foot
ball."
A communications major spe
cializing in braodcast journalism,
the Trojan sophomore has set his

sights on a post-footbali career as
a sports announcer. Salisbury
has idols in that field as well
ABC's Keith Jackson.
Another goal of Salisbury's is
to play all three major sports in
college football, basketball and
baseball. He has been quoted as
saying he wants to do it "just to
show that it can be done at a ma
jor university." But despite his
success in the sports world, espe
cially on the football field,
Salisbury remains as humble as
