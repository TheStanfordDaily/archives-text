## 
### ADAM BERNS 
This week Cardinal Today in
terviews Stanford offensive coor
dinator Jim Fassel the second in
a series of exclusive interviews.
Fassel, who played as an under
graduate at USC, came to Stan
ford four years ago as a running
hack and receivers coach. Two
year ago, with the departure of
Denny Green to Northwestern,
Fassel took over the reins as Stan
ford's offensive coordinator. This
week, Fassel talks about his of
fensive philosophy, John El way,
and his alma matter, USC.
CT: The offensive philosophy
this year seems to have changed
significantly from the early part
of last season. This year the of
fense is more wide open and
quarterback John Elway is pass
ing more. Do vou think this is
more the result of a change in
coaching philosophy or an ad

justment to the type of personnel
that Stanford has people like
John Elway, Mike Tolliver, and
Emile Harrv'?
Fassel: The second part of
your question is the true part be
cause I've always been a passing
game guv. I've always believed in
the pass first. More than that is
that last year at this time, we had
our best receiver out for the sea
son; we had our quarterback in
jured; we had a great running
back in Darrin Nelson, but he
was hurt. And we weren't just
clicking in the passing game be
cause we just didn't have enough
experienced people, so we had to
adjust like anybody else. And we
tried to keep some games close,
although they might not have
been as exciting as a lot of people
thought thev should have been.
This year, however, now we have
experienced receivers; we have a

healthy quarterback; we have a
good backup quarterback and
more of a total package to offer.
In a couple games last year, like
the San Jose State game, we had
to be a little bit more conserva
tive going in because we did not
know how long John was going
to be able to play, and Steve Cot
trell the backup had never been in
a game.
CT: Did you ever think before
the season started that you would
go into a game and have Elway
throw the ball 63 times like he did
against Ohio State?
Fassel: Oh certainly I did. I
think the longer the game goes
that its tight, the more that we are
going to throw. Like Purdue was
one of the fewer amount of passes
that we've thrown in a game. But
it was basically because we were
leading and I was a little bit more
conservative towardsa the end of
the game. Whereas against Ohio
State, when we threw 63 times,

the game came right down to the
final seconds.
CT: One of the major changes
that you have made this year is
that you are now calling all the
plays from the press box. Why
was the change made and what
are the advantages over calling
the plavs from the field?
Fassel Well first of all, the ma
jor reason I made the change is
that I just didn't get a good feel
for the game on the sidelines. I
just said to myself that its easier
for me to make adjustments if I
can see it for myself and not have
to ask someone else what hap
pened. Up in the press box I can
see everything. I can see the in
terior front, the coverages, and
when vou throw the ball as much
as we do the most important
thing is to see all the coverages
and linebackers drops and there's
no way vou can see anything
from the field.
CT: John has been calling
more audibles this year than in
the past. Has John done a good

job calling audibles and how do
you feel that they have been
working?
Fassel: 1 think that John has
done an outstanding job calling
audibles because he goes into
each game with his set of rules.l
think what we did this year is lean
a little more to the philosophy of,
if they give us a weakness, let's
take it. Where last year, instead
of calling audible to get ourselves
into a better play when the de
fense showed a certain look, we
just went ahead with the original
play.
CT: Having attended USC
yourself, does this game have any
special meaning for you?
Fassel: I want to win this game
as much as any of them. Maybe
there's a little something special,
but 1 wanted to beat Arizona
State as bad as I want to beat
USC. The guard has changed (at
USC) since I've been there. I
want to beat this guys as bad as
anybody, maybe more. I don't
know.

as we do the most important
thing is to see all the coverages
and linebackers drops and there's
no way vou can see anything
from the field.
CT: John has been calling
more audibles this year than in
the past. Has John done a good

job calling audibles and how do
you feel that they have been
working?
Fassel: 1 think that John has
done an outstanding job calling
audibles because he goes into
each game with his set of rules.l
think what we did this year is lean
a little more to the philosophy of,
if they give us a weakness, let's
take it. Where last year, instead
of calling audible to get ourselves
into a better play when the de
fense showed a certain look, we
just went ahead with the original
play.
CT: Having attended USC
yourself, does this game have any
special meaning for you?
Fassel: I want to win this game
as much as any of them. Maybe
there's a little something special,
but 1 wanted to beat Arizona
State as bad as I want to beat
USC. The guard has changed (at
USC) since I've been there. I
want to beat this guys as bad as
anybody, maybe more. I don't
know.
This week Cardinal Today in
terviews Stanford offensive coor
dinator Jim Fassel the second in
a series of exclusive interviews.
Fassel, who played as an under
graduate at USC, came to Stan
ford four years ago as a running
hack and receivers coach. Two
year ago, with the departure of
Denny Green to Northwestern,
Fassel took over the reins as Stan
ford's offensive coordinator. This
week, Fassel talks about his of
fensive philosophy, John El way,
and his alma matter, USC.
CT: The offensive philosophy
this year seems to have changed
significantly from the early part
of last season. This year the of
fense is more wide open and
quarterback John Elway is pass
ing more. Do vou think this is
more the result of a change in
coaching philosophy or an ad

justment to the type of personnel
that Stanford has people like
John Elway, Mike Tolliver, and
Emile Harrv'?
Fassel: The second part of
your question is the true part be
cause I've always been a passing
game guv. I've always believed in
the pass first. More than that is
that last year at this time, we had
our best receiver out for the sea
son; we had our quarterback in
jured; we had a great running
back in Darrin Nelson, but he
was hurt. And we weren't just
clicking in the passing game be
cause we just didn't have enough
experienced people, so we had to
adjust like anybody else. And we
tried to keep some games close,
although they might not have
been as exciting as a lot of people
thought thev should have been.
This year, however, now we have
experienced receivers; we have a

healthy quarterback; we have a
good backup quarterback and
more of a total package to offer.
In a couple games last year, like
the San Jose State game, we had
to be a little bit more conserva
tive going in because we did not
know how long John was going
to be able to play, and Steve Cot
trell the backup had never been in
a game.
CT: Did you ever think before
the season started that you would
go into a game and have Elway
throw the ball 63 times like he did
against Ohio State?
Fassel: Oh certainly I did. I
think the longer the game goes
that its tight, the more that we are
going to throw. Like Purdue was
one of the fewer amount of passes
that we've thrown in a game. But
it was basically because we were
leading and I was a little bit more
conservative towardsa the end of
the game. Whereas against Ohio
State, when we threw 63 times,

the game came right down to the
final seconds.
CT: One of the major changes
that you have made this year is
that you are now calling all the
plays from the press box. Why
was the change made and what
are the advantages over calling
the plavs from the field?
Fassel Well first of all, the ma
jor reason I made the change is
that I just didn't get a good feel
for the game on the sidelines. I
just said to myself that its easier
for me to make adjustments if I
can see it for myself and not have
to ask someone else what hap
pened. Up in the press box I can
see everything. I can see the in
terior front, the coverages, and
when vou throw the ball as much
as we do the most important
thing is to see all the coverages
and linebackers drops and there's
no way vou can see anything
from the field.
