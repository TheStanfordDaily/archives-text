# Elway part of Stanford quarterback legacy
## 
### LISA STERN 
If USC is acknowledged as the
school with the tailback tradi
tion, Stanford is equally well-ad
mired as the university which
turns out the top NFL quarter
backs. From John Brodieto John
Elway, the Farm has consistently
bred some of the Pac-10's top rec
ord-holders.
Four former Stanford signal
callers, Jim Plunkett (LA Raid
ers), Guy Benjamin (SF 49ers),
Steve Dils (Minnesota Vikings)
and Turk Schonert (Cincinati
Bengals), currently hold posi
tions in the National Football
League. Four other Cardinal

standouts, Mike Boryla, John
Brodie, Dick Horn and Dick
Norman, have retired from the
professional ranks. In addition,
former Stanford quarterback
Don Bunce elected to play for the
British Columbia Lions. He, too,
has since hung up his spikes.
The Farm has also cultivated
three consensus All-Americas
(Brodie, Plunkett and Benjamin)
as well as two other All-America
quarterbacks (Boryla and
Elway). Of these players, only
one, Jim Plunkett, has been
awarded the Heisman Trophy.
Frank Albert, Stanford's of
fensive leader 1939-41, is one of

seven Cardinal players who have
been elected to the National
Football Foundation Hall of
Fame.
Six Stanford signal callers have
earned their places in the Pac-10
record book as conference pass
ing champions. These atheletes
included Plunkett (1970), Bunce
(1971), Boryla (1972, 73), Ben
jamin (1977), Schonert (1979)
and Elway (1980).
John Elway is, of course, the
latest in this long line of golden
arms. After inheriting the quar
terbacking duties from Schonert

in 1980, Elway has led the Pac-10
in total offense for the past two
seasons. Against Oregon St. two
weeks ago, he set two career rec
ords by obliterating Jack
Thompson's Pac-10 completions
record and by surpassing
Plunkett's Stanford passing
yardage mark. Last Saturday
Elway broke another Pac-10 rec
ord previously held by WSU's
Thompson for career passing
yardage by throwing for 209
yards against Arizona St.
As the youngest in the Card
legacy, Elway currently holds

eight of Stanford's all-time pass
ing records, including that for ca
reer passing yardage (7819), sea
son total offense (2939 in 1980),
and season completions (248). In
addition, the All-America main
tains four Pac-10 marks for ca
reer passing yardage (7819), most
touchdowns responsible for (72),
most passes completed (641) and
most touchdown tosses (67).
Elway, perhaps in the middle
of his finest collegiate season, is
approaching several other Stan
ford, Pac-10 and NCAA records.
