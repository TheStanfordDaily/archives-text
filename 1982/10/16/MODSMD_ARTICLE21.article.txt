# Tailgating at Stanford as old as the automobile
## 
### LIBBY LEONARD 
Stanford football fans enjoy
tailgating, provided it's practiced
among the campus' eucalyptus
trees and not on the open high
way.
Tailgaters, festive outdoor
parties held before each Cardinal
home football game, have be
come a popular tradition. The
history of tailgating at Stanford
has never been followed closely.
Stories concerning this
phenomenon's origin are vague
and varied. Few alumni can re
call a time without these portable
picnics.
"The story of tailgating may
follow the development of the au
tomobile," said Barney Mc-
Clure, who is celebrating his 40th
reunion this weekend. "When I
was in college, we were just be
ginning to have pick-ups and sta
tion wagons, which first made
tailgaters possible," continued
McClure.
Don Carlson, director of Uni
versity relations, joked that
tailgating "may have started as
soon as Prohibition ended."
Most alumni agree that Stan
ford, alone, did not start tailgat
ing routine.

Fred Glover, a 1933 graduate
and former secretary of the Uni
versity of Marist(???), believes
Stanford tailgaters "became a
function of eastern tradition that
spread west." Glover said that

many Ivy League professors
came to Stanford in the '4os, and
they might have introduced the
custom here.

Roxanne Nilan explained that as
the number of cars increased, it
became more convenient to park
early before the game and have a
tailgate luncheon. "My family,
for generations, had tailgaters to
beat the traffic," Nilan re
marked.
To secure a prime location, se
rious tailgate enthusiasts camp
out one or two nights before a
game and rope off their sacred
area. Most parties, however,
aren't scheduled to start until
about 10:30 in the morning on
game days.

The Athletic Department does
set aside a few areas for special
tailgating groups. To reserve a
spot in Chuck Taylor Grove, an
alumni favorite, it costs about
SI 50 for the season, according to
Pete Kmetovic, manager of ath
letic operations. Kmetovic said
these spaces were sold out in ear
ly June and reservations are al
ready coining in for next year.
It's hard to describe a typical
Stanford tailgater; they are about
as diverse as the University's stu
dent body. Each party has a
unique character, ranging from
complex to simple.
Elegant. Extravagant.

Elaborate. Those words come to
mind when one scans the mass of
open trunks and notices can
delobras, canopies, linen table
cloths, portable bar sets and min
iature televisions.
Some tailgate menus feature
gourmet delights: chicken liver
pate, imported cheese, Danish
pastries and vintage wine. The as
sorted buffet tables can resemble
a banquet rather than a plain pic
nic lunch.
Local delicatessen owners look
forward to Stanford tailgaters,
too. Pleasing the palate of large
alumni groups is a profitable un
dertaking. More than 2000 alum
ni, for instance, are being served
catered box lunches on Angell
Eield todav.

For people who prefer Chinet
to china, tailgating is a less for
mal, less expensive affair.
Roasted weenies (a Big Game fa
vorite), pretzels and beer high
light many parties.
Tailgaters appeal to the young
and the old. Besides Stanford
alumni and their families, dorms,
social organizations and clubs
also stage tailgaters.
"At tailgaters, there's a certain
excitement in the air for alumni,"
commented Karen Porter, an
employee at Bowman Alumni
House. "Thev like to come back
and be a part of the campus," she
added.

FUN IN THE SUN: The only thing that compares with a Stanford
football game is the tailgater before the contest. Many cars
even park two or three days before the game to get the right spot.
