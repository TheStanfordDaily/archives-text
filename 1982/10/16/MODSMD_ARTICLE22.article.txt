# Offensive line works to protect Elway
## 
### DAVE DUTCHER 
In watching the electrifying
Stanford Cardinal offense this
year, it is easy to give credit to
quarterback John Elway and the
receivers he throws to.
While Elway and his mates
have moved the football an aver
age of 431.8 yards per game this
season, they would be among the
first to admit that much less
would have been gained without
the Cardinal offensive line doing
the consistent, effective job it has
this season.

As Elway's offensive attack
takes the field today against the
University of Southern Califor
nia, it will be looking to move the
ball against a Trojan team that is
holding its opponents to seven
points a game.
Coming into this season, Stan
ford was looking to replace line
spots vacated by graduation. The
center, left guard and left tackle
positions were left unoccupied,
prompting Cardinal Head Coach
Paul Wiggin to call the center and
left side of the offensive line, "a

question mark in our offense"
before the season opened.
The two returning starters are
Matt Moran and Dennis Engel.
Moran (6-foot-4, 255 pounds)
moved from right tackle to fill the
left guard position while Engel
<6-2, 255) remained at his right
guard post.
At left tackle, 6-3 junior Jeff
Deaton inherited a job while sen
ior Mike Teeuws (6-4, 250) has
been the starting center through
the Cardinal's five games.
Joining Engel on the right side
is senior tackle Chris Rose (6-5,
260).
Moran started 10 of 11 games
on the 4-7 Stanford squad last
season, while Engel got the nod
in seven matches. Rose started
the first two Cardinal games last
year before succumbing to to
shoulder and leg injuries. Teeuws
had the number one spot at right
guard until the Ohio State game
last season, when he fell into a
backup position. Deaton was
moved to offensive guard last
year from defensive noseguard

and played as a substitute.
Offensive line coach Dick
James is happy with the job the
interior linemen have done.
"We've been pleased with their
performance this year," he said.
"The thing we wanted to do is
pass protect and we've been suc
cessful."
The reason the line has striven
to have good pass protection can
be summed up in one name: John
Elwav. Utilizing Elway's passing
arm and the Cardinal receivers,
Stanford has thrown for 1771
yards so far this season. The
Cardinal has averaged 354.2
yards per game through the air.
Moran, an economics major,
does not mind blocking for an of
fense that passes a majority of the
time it has the ball.
"We pass 70 percent of the

time," he said matter-of-factly,
"and pass blocking is my special
ity." Both Moran and James
agree that Stanford's success re
lies on the offense being able to
set up the running game with the
passing attack, a relatively un
orthodox theory until recent
years.
"We have to make them (the
USC defensive line) pass rush,"
James said, "and then counter
with traps and runs. The sweep
game will also be important to
get outside of the hard rushers."
In its 21-17 loss to Arizona
State last Saturday, the Cardinal
offensive line was confronted
with a blitzing defense. To
Moran, the Sundevil game was
physically the toughest game he
has played this season. "I was
stepping up to block blitzers that

had five-yard headstarts,"
Moran said. "They (ASU)
blitzed two out of every three
plays."

Stanford faces a similarly
tough defense in USC. The
Cardinal was held by the Sun
devils to 239 total yards and the
Trojan defense has been stifling
opposing offenses to the tune of
239.8 yards per game.

Arizona State recorded four
sacks of Elway last weekend,
which upped the season total to
18 - a figure Moran says is deceiv
ing.
"We pass so much we're
bound to have a sack," he said.
"What some people don't realize
is that sometimes the sack is the
offensive line's fault and some
times it's the running back's fault
for not picking up a blitzer.

A WALL OF STONE: While John Elway may be the leading candidate for the Heisman Trophy much of his
success depends upon the offensive line. Head coach Paul Wiggin feels that this years line is the most talented
since he's been here.
Teams know we're going to pass
and they blitz six or seven guys
sometimes."
Depth has posed a problem
this year for James and the of
fensive line. "We have 10 of
fensive linemen we're training
12 and we played five against
ASU," James said. "We've been
getting bv with seven with the ex
ception of the Oregon State
game. Thank goodness we
haven't had injuries."
The two backups seeing most
of the playing time ire
sophomore Brent Martin (6-4,
245) and senior Kenny Orvick
(6-4, 260). Martin is listed on the
depth chart as backing up
Teeuws at center and Engel at
right guard while Orvick is
Rose's replacement. Other
linemen are 6-7 sophomore John
Barns at left tackle and senior
Ken Cunz (6-3, 260).
The Trojans won last season's
match in Los Angeles on the
strength of a 25-3 third quarter
lead. The Cardinal then struck
for two fourth-quarter touch
downs but fell short, 25-17. The
intimidation that USC has upon
opposing teams is not all it is
built up to be, according to
Moran.

"I think we realized last year
that we're as tough as they are
and we finally decided we could
beat them in the third and fourth
quarter. They're not demigods
like everyone has said - they fall
down just like everyone else."

The two returning starters are
Matt Moran and Dennis Engel.
Moran (6-foot-4, 255 pounds)
moved from right tackle to fill the
left guard position while Engel
<6-2, 255) remained at his right
guard post.
At left tackle, 6-3 junior Jeff
Deaton inherited a job while sen
ior Mike Teeuws (6-4, 250) has
been the starting center through
the Cardinal's five games.
Joining Engel on the right side
is senior tackle Chris Rose (6-5,
260).
Moran started 10 of 11 games
on the 4-7 Stanford squad last
season, while Engel got the nod
in seven matches. Rose started
the first two Cardinal games last
year before succumbing to to
shoulder and leg injuries. Teeuws
had the number one spot at right
guard until the Ohio State game
last season, when he fell into a
backup position. Deaton was
moved to offensive guard last
year from defensive noseguard

and played as a substitute.
Offensive line coach Dick
James is happy with the job the
interior linemen have done.
"We've been pleased with their
performance this year," he said.
"The thing we wanted to do is
pass protect and we've been suc
cessful."
The reason the line has striven
to have good pass protection can
be summed up in one name: John
Elwav. Utilizing Elway's passing
arm and the Cardinal receivers,
Stanford has thrown for 1771
yards so far this season. The
Cardinal has averaged 354.2
yards per game through the air.
Moran, an economics major,
does not mind blocking for an of
fense that passes a majority of the
time it has the ball.
"We pass 70 percent of the

time," he said matter-of-factly,
"and pass blocking is my special
ity." Both Moran and James
agree that Stanford's success re
lies on the offense being able to
set up the running game with the
passing attack, a relatively un
orthodox theory until recent
years.
"We have to make them (the
USC defensive line) pass rush,"
James said, "and then counter
with traps and runs. The sweep
game will also be important to
get outside of the hard rushers."
In its 21-17 loss to Arizona
State last Saturday, the Cardinal
offensive line was confronted
with a blitzing defense. To
Moran, the Sundevil game was
physically the toughest game he
has played this season. "I was
stepping up to block blitzers that

had five-yard headstarts,"
Moran said. "They (ASU)
blitzed two out of every three
plays."

Stanford faces a similarly
tough defense in USC. The
Cardinal was held by the Sun
devils to 239 total yards and the
Trojan defense has been stifling
opposing offenses to the tune of
239.8 yards per game.

Arizona State recorded four
sacks of Elway last weekend,
which upped the season total to
18 - a figure Moran says is deceiv
ing.
"We pass so much we're
bound to have a sack," he said.
"What some people don't realize
is that sometimes the sack is the
offensive line's fault and some
times it's the running back's fault
for not picking up a blitzer.

A WALL OF STONE: While John Elway may be the leading candidate for the Heisman Trophy much of his
success depends upon the offensive line. Head coach Paul Wiggin feels that this years line is the most talented
since he's been here.
Teams know we're going to pass
and they blitz six or seven guys
sometimes."
Depth has posed a problem
this year for James and the of
fensive line. "We have 10 of
fensive linemen we're training
12 and we played five against
ASU," James said. "We've been
getting bv with seven with the ex
ception of the Oregon State
game. Thank goodness we
haven't had injuries."
The two backups seeing most
of the playing time ire
sophomore Brent Martin (6-4,
245) and senior Kenny Orvick
(6-4, 260). Martin is listed on the
depth chart as backing up
Teeuws at center and Engel at
right guard while Orvick is
Rose's replacement. Other
linemen are 6-7 sophomore John
Barns at left tackle and senior
Ken Cunz (6-3, 260).
The Trojans won last season's
match in Los Angeles on the
strength of a 25-3 third quarter
lead. The Cardinal then struck
for two fourth-quarter touch
downs but fell short, 25-17. The
intimidation that USC has upon
opposing teams is not all it is
built up to be, according to
Moran.

"I think we realized last year
that we're as tough as they are
and we finally decided we could
beat them in the third and fourth
quarter. They're not demigods
like everyone has said - they fall
down just like everyone else."
In watching the electrifying
Stanford Cardinal offense this
year, it is easy to give credit to
quarterback John Elway and the
receivers he throws to.
While Elway and his mates
have moved the football an aver
age of 431.8 yards per game this
season, they would be among the
first to admit that much less
would have been gained without
the Cardinal offensive line doing
the consistent, effective job it has
this season.

As Elway's offensive attack
takes the field today against the
University of Southern Califor
nia, it will be looking to move the
ball against a Trojan team that is
holding its opponents to seven
points a game.
Coming into this season, Stan
ford was looking to replace line
spots vacated by graduation. The
center, left guard and left tackle
positions were left unoccupied,
prompting Cardinal Head Coach
Paul Wiggin to call the center and
left side of the offensive line, "a

question mark in our offense"
before the season opened.
The two returning starters are
Matt Moran and Dennis Engel.
Moran (6-foot-4, 255 pounds)
