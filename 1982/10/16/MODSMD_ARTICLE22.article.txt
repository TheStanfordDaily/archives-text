# Offensive line works to protect Elway
## 
### DAVE DUTCHER 
In watching the electrifying
Stanford Cardinal offense this
year, it is easy to give credit to
quarterback John Elway and the
receivers he throws to.
While Elway and his mates
have moved the football an aver
age of 431.8 yards per game this
season, they would be among the
first to admit that much less
would have been gained without
the Cardinal offensive line doing
the consistent, effective job it has
this season.

As Elway's offensive attack
takes the field today against the
University of Southern Califor
nia, it will be looking to move the
ball against a Trojan team that is
holding its opponents to seven
points a game.
Coming into this season, Stan
ford was looking to replace line
spots vacated by graduation. The
center, left guard and left tackle
positions were left unoccupied,
prompting Cardinal Head Coach
Paul Wiggin to call the center and
left side of the offensive line, "a

question mark in our offense"
before the season opened.
The two returning starters are
Matt Moran and Dennis Engel.
Moran (6-foot-4, 255 pounds)
moved from right tackle to fill the
left guard position while Engel
<6-2, 255) remained at his right
guard post.
At left tackle, 6-3 junior Jeff
Deaton inherited a job while sen
ior Mike Teeuws (6-4, 250) has
been the starting center through
the Cardinal's five games.
Joining Engel on the right side
is senior tackle Chris Rose (6-5,
260).
Moran started 10 of 11 games
on the 4-7 Stanford squad last
season, while Engel got the nod
in seven matches. Rose started
the first two Cardinal games last
year before succumbing to to
shoulder and leg injuries. Teeuws
had the number one spot at right
guard until the Ohio State game
last season, when he fell into a
backup position. Deaton was
moved to offensive guard last
year from defensive noseguard

and played as a substitute.
Offensive line coach Dick
James is happy with the job the
interior linemen have done.
"We've been pleased with their
performance this year," he said.
"The thing we wanted to do is
pass protect and we've been suc
cessful."
The reason the line has striven
to have good pass protection can
be summed up in one name: John
Elwav. Utilizing Elway's passing
arm and the Cardinal receivers,
Stanford has thrown for 1771
yards so far this season. The
Cardinal has averaged 354.2
yards per game through the air.
Moran, an economics major,
does not mind blocking for an of
fense that passes a majority of the
time it has the ball.
"We pass 70 percent of the

time," he said matter-of-factly,
"and pass blocking is my special
ity." Both Moran and James
agree that Stanford's success re
lies on the offense being able to
set up the running game with the
passing attack, a relatively un
orthodox theory until recent
years.
"We have to make them (the
USC defensive line) pass rush,"
James said, "and then counter
with traps and runs. The sweep
game will also be important to
get outside of the hard rushers."
In its 21-17 loss to Arizona
State last Saturday, the Cardinal
offensive line was confronted
with a blitzing defense. To
Moran, the Sundevil game was
physically the toughest game he
has played this season. "I was
stepping up to block blitzers that

had five-yard headstarts,"
Moran said. "They (ASU)
blitzed two out of every three
plays."

Stanford faces a similarly
tough defense in USC. The
Cardinal was held by the Sun
devils to 239 total yards and the
Trojan defense has been stifling
opposing offenses to the tune of
239.8 yards per game.

Arizona State recorded four
sacks of Elway last weekend,
which upped the season total to
18 - a figure Moran says is deceiv
ing.
"We pass so much we're
bound to have a sack," he said.
"What some people don't realize
is that sometimes the sack is the
offensive line's fault and some
times it's the running back's fault
for not picking up a blitzer.

A WALL OF STONE: While John Elway may be the leading candidate for the Heisman Trophy much of his
success depends upon the offensive line. Head coach Paul Wiggin feels that this years line is the most talented
since he's been here.
