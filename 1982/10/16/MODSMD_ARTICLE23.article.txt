# Guest Greek-of-the-Week
## 
### 
Greek-of-the- Week is a regular
feature of Cardinal Today. Each
week, some unsuspecting souls put
themselves on the line and predict
the score for the Stanford and Cal
ifornia football games.
This weeks Guest Greek is
University President Donald
Kennedy, a self-acknowledged
sports enthusiast. Kennedy took
time out of his busy day to per
form one of his most important
University functions predict
ing the Stanford-USC football
score. Although he does not have
the "Godlike" following of Ad
missions Director Fred
Hargadon, he is admired and
looked up to bv most people on
campus. Kennedy, however,
does not mind putting his reputa
tion on the line, and is fully confi
dent of his picks.
In the Stanford-USC game,
Kennedy predicts an upset. He
feels that Stanford will pull out
its first home upset of USC since
1970 and predicts a 27-24
Cardinal victory. Kennedy ex
plains: "Once again, like three

weeks ago, disappointment is fol
lowed bv the opportunity for re
demption."
Kennedy also makes a surpris
ing prediction in the California-.
Oregon game. Although the

Bears are favored by 13 points,
Kennedy feels that the game will
be much closer and predicts a
17-17 tie. "It will be a moral vic
tory for both offenses," he ex
plained.
