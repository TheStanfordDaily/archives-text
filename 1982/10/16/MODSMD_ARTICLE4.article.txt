# Trojans rested and ready for Stanford
## 
### ADAM BERNS 
The USC football weekend is
always a challenge.
It's a challenge to get tickets. A
challenge to stay awake during
the USC band's halftime show.
And always, a challenge on the
football field.
"This is one of those rivalries
that we've grown to love," Stan
ford coach Paul Wiggin said this
past week. "There was even a ri
valry going on when 1 played
here."
The Trojans lead Stanford
38-21-3 in a series which dates
back to 1905, although the
Cardinal has not beaten USC at
Stanford Stadium since 1970.
Although some people have
questioned USC's motivation be
cause of its probation this year,
the Trojans shattered the myth
that the lack of post season play
would affect them when they
blanked Oklahoma 12-0 end
ing the longest current string of
games without a shutout. Iron
ically, USC now has the longest
streak with 170 games.
"1 just got finished looking at
the film of the Oregon contest,"
Wiggin said, referring to USC's
last game two weeks ago. "There
was Vi a reel of Oregon offense
and three reels of Oregon de
fense. They (the Trojans) had 22
first downs in the first half com
pared with two for Oregon.
"I think USC plays as physical
as anyone. I see it as a real battle.
When you shut out Oklahoma,
you aren't affected by probation.
1 have a lot of respect for John
Robinson."
USC (3-1) had two full weeks
to pre} are for today's game with
Stanford (3-2) and USC coach
Robinson feels that it is a signifi
cant advantage.

"We're certainly more mental
ly and physically rested than any
time during the year," Robinson
said. "The week off gave us a
chance to heal some wounds and
polish some of our skills. Now
we're rested and looking forward
to the rest of the season."
Last year Stanford became the
first team to hold Trojan tailback
Marcus Allen to less than 200
yards rushing (153 yards on 40 at
tempts) and the Cardinal held
USC to 188 total rushing yards
on 48 attempts. To accomplish
the feat, however, Stanford used

an eight-man line and then-Tro
jan quarterback John Mazur
(who lost the starting job to
sophomore Sean Salisbury last
spring) picked the Stanford sec
ondary apart, completing 10 of
19 passes for 175 yards.
The addition of Salisbury to
the Trojan attack makes Wiggin
shudder at the thought of an
eight man defensive line this year.
"USC has a much more bal
anced attack than it historically

has had," Wiggin said this past
week. "They still have a classic
tailback offense in regards to
their running game, but with the
development of Salisbury they
have achieved a more versatile
offense. In all honesty, that
makes it a greater challenge for
our defense. "I see Sean
Salisbury as a premier football
player. He was considered by
many as the top recruit in his year
by many of the polls."
The first order of business for
the Stanford defense is to put last
week's 42-second disaster behind

them. Except for one or two
isolated breakdowns, the secon
dary has played well and the de
fense has picked off 13 passes
five more than all of last year.
Yet last week's experience in
Arizona did cause Wiggin to re
consider the Cardinal's prevent
defense, (although technically
last week's formation was not a
prevent because there were not
any personnel changes.)
While Stanford is emphasizing

pass defense, it also can not
forget USC's ground game. Al
though Heisman Trophy winner
Marcus Allen is gone, three of his
All-America linemen senior
guard Bruce Matthews, junior
center Tony Slaton and senior
tackle Don Mosebar are still
around.
USC had some early problems
finding the heir apparent to Allen
after its first two starting
tailbacks were injured. The Tro
jans have finally settled on junior
Todd Spencer, who started the
season as a fullback.

Against Oregon, Spencer
made his first start at tailback
and picked up 149 yards on 29
carries besides scoring three
touchdowns and catching three
passes for 48 more yards.
"He isn't Marcus Allen, but he
is an effective running back,"
Wiggin said about Spencer. "But
you have to keep in mind that at
USC you're talking about stop
ping a machine. There's
Mosebar, Matthews, Slater and

the rest of the line. When you
tackle the tailback, you've beaten
some great blocks."
While the USC offense is good,
its defense is even better. The
Trojans rank No. 8 nationally in
defense and No. 12 in pass de
fense.
The secondary is led by safety
Joev Browner (31 tackles, two in
terceptions), who Robinson
compares with San Francisco
49er Ronnie Lott. Browner has
already scored two touchdowns
this year one on an punt return
and the other on an interception
and Robinson feels that he is
an All-America candidate. The
USC pass defense has been par
ticularly stingy against the touch
down pass, giving up only one in
the last 14 quarters of play.
"1 see them (USC) being a
dominant zone defense," Wiggin
said about the Trojans defensive
philosophy. "I think John Rob
inson does a good job at per
ceiving what he has and doing the
best with it.

Stanford quarterback John
Elwav had his most difficult out
ing of the year against the blitzing
Arizona State defense. The Sun
Devils, which play man-to-man
coverage have a completely dif
ferent philosophy from the Tro
jans, but Wiggin does not feel
that his team particularly prefers
one style to the other.
"We've had good luck and bad
luck against both concepts,"
Wiggin explained. "USC has
good team speed and it makes it
difficult to get the receivers
open."
Although Stanford gained
only 239 yards through the air
against Arizona State, Stanford
still has the nation's No. 1 pass-

HAIR TURNED UP: Stanford has already had enough close games this year to make anyone's
hair stand on end. Last week Stanford suffered its most disappointing loss of the season, a
21-17 thriller against Arizona State, losing in the final seconds.
ing offense, averaging 354.0
yards a game. Heisman Trophy
candidate Elway has now thrown
for more than 200 yards in 11
straight games and 25 of his last
27.
"If John has time, I think he
can be productive against any
kind of defense," Wiggin said.
If Stanford is to have any
chance against USC, Elway will
have to be productive because the
Trojans are even stingier on the
ground than in the air. Anchored
bv nose guard George Achica (22
tackles) and inside linebacker
Ricki Grey, they are giving up
only 102.3 yards per game on the
ground and only 2.8 yards per
carry.
Stanford's running game
should be improved with the re
turn of a healthy Vincent White.
Although White played against
Arizona State, he was still
playing injured and Wiggin feels
that he just was not himself.

Cardinal clippings
Besides ranking first national
ly in passing offense, Stanford is
No. 11 in total offense. In the last
10 games dating back to last year,
Stanford is averaging 524.1 yards
per contest.
John Elway, who appears to be
the leading candidate for the
Heisman Trophy, is ranked sec
ond nationally in total passing
with 333.8 yards per game and is
third in passing efficiency with a
rating of 156.9. Elway needs only
77 more completions to break
Mark Herrmann's NCAA all
time completion record of 717.
The injury report for the
Cardinal is better than in recent
weeks. The only significant in
juries are a sprained shoulder by
Stanford receiver Emile Harry
and a bruised calf by linebacker
Garin Veris but both are ex
pected to play today. Linebacker
Kevin Bates has also continued
to play despite being plagued by
two broken fingers.
