# Spirit stays high at USC, despite probation
## 
### DAVE DUTCHER 
Some NCAA college football
programs have, in recent years,
followed the philosophy that
cheating is OK unless you get
caught.
The University of Southern
California, Stanford's opponent
today, got caught. Last spring,
the Trojan football program was
found guilty by the National Col
legiate Athletic Association
(NCAA) of scalping tickets to
generate cash for players partici
pating in the plan.
Between 1971 and 1979, the
USC players gave their com
plimentary game tickets to Assis
tant Head Coach Marv Goux,
who in turn sold them for the ath
letes. During a single season, as
many as 33 players made money
off the scheme. Some Trojans
were able to obtain as much as
$2OOO and the total amount re
ceived by all participating players
was probably more than
$200,000.
Goux, according to a news re
lease issued by the NCAA, "de
liberately violated NCAA rules."

As a result of the wrongdoings,
USC was banned from post-sea
son bowl games following the
1982 and 1983 seasons and from
television exposure in 1983 and
1984. The Trojans cannot win the
Pac-10 championship this year or
in 1983 but the games they play
against other conference schools
do count in the Pac-10 race.
USC signed a television con
tract, prior to the sanctions, for
1982 and 1983. With the ex
istence of the signed contract, the
NCAA was forced to impose the
TV ban on the 1983 and 1984
Trojan seasons.
In the first year of its television
agreement, USC is permitted to
be on the air four times this sea
son, according to Duane
Lindberg, USC Assistant Sports
Informationn Director.
"We've been fortunate in
terms of TV," Lindberg said.
"We've been on (television) once
already, the Stanford game is
number two, and three and four
are against Notre Dame and
UCLA."
Lindberg said the imposed

probation is "potentially taking
away a lot of money from us
(USC) and the conference." He
added that possible television
dates lost to the sanctions could
deny USC the opportunity to
make close to one million dollars.
"That's a severe penalty," he
said. "The fine is excessive as far
as we're concerned."
When the probation was an
nounced, the issue of motivation
arose. Would the Trojan players,
knowing they could not compete
in a post-season bowl game, have
the drive to make the 1982 season
a success?

"The motivation hasn't been a
problem," Lindberg stressed.
"It's worked out well considering
the circumstances. It (the proba
tion) is not something you think
about when you've got a team
like Stanford to play."
The USC football program has
been subject to penalty prior to
this season. In 1980 the Trojans
were barred from bowl games by
the Pac-10 for academic prob
lems including athletes. Conse
quently, the football team and

the men's outdoor track team
were on probation for the mis
conducts.
Lindberg pointed out that,
"The academic problems we had
are all taken care of."
Despite the setbacks USC
football has suffered, Lindberg
insisted that the team's morale
remains high. "The spirits of the
players are outstanding," he said.
"What they're worried about is
being ready for Stanford."
Lindberg admitted that not
being able to play in a bowl could
affect the Trojan players. "I real
ly don't think it is something any
body looks to now. It could be a
factor around the time bowl bids
go out."

It is difficult to determine if the
imposed sanctions had an effect
on USC's recruiting efforts. The
Trojans had "a small recruiting
class this year," according to
Lindberg. "We only had a few
scholarships and we signed about
16 kids or something like that."
Lindberg explained that having
30 scholarships available one

year and only 15 the next was not
uncommon.
Lindberg downplayed the ef
fect of the USC probation on re
cruiting and motivation but
seemed concerned over the loss
of money resulting from the tele
vision ban.
"Over the last 10 years USC
has been the number one TV
team in college football," he said.
"It (the probation) is going to
hurt the whole conference."

The television contract the
NCAA made was challenged in
court recently. One university
said the NCAA was denying the
school its right to make money
because the NCAA-member
schools cannot negotiate their
own television deals. If, through
court matters, the NCAA's hold
on television rights is struck
down in court, Lindberg ex
plained, "we (USC) could be on
TV next year."
For now, it appears the battles
that really count for USC are off,
and not on, the football field.

1984. The Trojans cannot win the
Pac-10 championship this year or
in 1983 but the games they play
against other conference schools
do count in the Pac-10 race.
USC signed a television con
tract, prior to the sanctions, for
1982 and 1983. With the ex
istence of the signed contract, the
NCAA was forced to impose the
TV ban on the 1983 and 1984
Trojan seasons.
In the first year of its television
agreement, USC is permitted to
be on the air four times this sea
son, according to Duane
Lindberg, USC Assistant Sports
Informationn Director.
"We've been fortunate in
terms of TV," Lindberg said.
"We've been on (television) once
already, the Stanford game is
number two, and three and four
are against Notre Dame and
UCLA."
Lindberg said the imposed

probation is "potentially taking
away a lot of money from us
(USC) and the conference." He
added that possible television
dates lost to the sanctions could
deny USC the opportunity to
make close to one million dollars.
"That's a severe penalty," he
said. "The fine is excessive as far
as we're concerned."
When the probation was an
nounced, the issue of motivation
arose. Would the Trojan players,
knowing they could not compete
in a post-season bowl game, have
the drive to make the 1982 season
a success?

"The motivation hasn't been a
problem," Lindberg stressed.
"It's worked out well considering
the circumstances. It (the proba
tion) is not something you think
about when you've got a team
like Stanford to play."
The USC football program has
been subject to penalty prior to
this season. In 1980 the Trojans
were barred from bowl games by
the Pac-10 for academic prob
lems including athletes. Conse
quently, the football team and

the men's outdoor track team
were on probation for the mis
conducts.
Lindberg pointed out that,
"The academic problems we had
are all taken care of."
Despite the setbacks USC
football has suffered, Lindberg
insisted that the team's morale
remains high. "The spirits of the
players are outstanding," he said.
"What they're worried about is
being ready for Stanford."
Lindberg admitted that not
being able to play in a bowl could
affect the Trojan players. "I real
ly don't think it is something any
body looks to now. It could be a
factor around the time bowl bids
go out."

It is difficult to determine if the
imposed sanctions had an effect
on USC's recruiting efforts. The
Trojans had "a small recruiting
class this year," according to
Lindberg. "We only had a few
scholarships and we signed about
16 kids or something like that."
Lindberg explained that having
30 scholarships available one

year and only 15 the next was not
uncommon.
Lindberg downplayed the ef
fect of the USC probation on re
cruiting and motivation but
seemed concerned over the loss
of money resulting from the tele
vision ban.
"Over the last 10 years USC
has been the number one TV
team in college football," he said.
"It (the probation) is going to
hurt the whole conference."

The television contract the
NCAA made was challenged in
court recently. One university
said the NCAA was denying the
school its right to make money
because the NCAA-member
schools cannot negotiate their
own television deals. If, through
court matters, the NCAA's hold
on television rights is struck
down in court, Lindberg ex
plained, "we (USC) could be on
TV next year."
For now, it appears the battles
that really count for USC are off,
and not on, the football field.
Some NCAA college football
programs have, in recent years,
followed the philosophy that
cheating is OK unless you get
caught.
The University of Southern
California, Stanford's opponent
today, got caught. Last spring,
the Trojan football program was
found guilty by the National Col
legiate Athletic Association
(NCAA) of scalping tickets to
generate cash for players partici
pating in the plan.
Between 1971 and 1979, the
USC players gave their com
plimentary game tickets to Assis
tant Head Coach Marv Goux,
who in turn sold them for the ath
letes. During a single season, as
many as 33 players made money
off the scheme. Some Trojans
were able to obtain as much as
$2OOO and the total amount re
ceived by all participating players
was probably more than
$200,000.
Goux, according to a news re
lease issued by the NCAA, "de
liberately violated NCAA rules."

As a result of the wrongdoings,
USC was banned from post-sea
son bowl games following the
1982 and 1983 seasons and from
television exposure in 1983 and
1984. The Trojans cannot win the
Pac-10 championship this year or
in 1983 but the games they play
