# CBS sends All-Star crew to cover today's game
## 
### ADAM BERNS 
Stanford and USC are not the
only teams that will be playing
their first string players today.
Lindsey Nelson and analyst
Pat Haden, who are broadcasting
today's game to a national tele
vision audience, are CBS' No. 1
college crew. Because CBS is
broadcasting only one football
game this week due to the NFL
strike it does as many as seven
to eight games some weeks the
camera crew, technical directors
and rest of workers are all CBS's
hand-picked best.
With the pro football players'
strike, many people are turning
to college football, but Ric
LaCivita, lead producer for CBS
College Football, explains that
there are many differences in the
wav CBS covers the two.

"In college football there is a
less time spent on the field, and
more on the tradition, pagaentry,
cheerleaders and other per
ipherals," LaCivita explains.
"I'd say 80 percent of the cov
erage of an NFL broadcast is
spent on the game. In college, 55
percent of the time is spent on the
field, while the other 45 percent is
spent off it.
"For example, John Elway is
just one of several great Stanford
quarterbacks dating back to
Frankie Albert. Players are only

here for three or four years. Col
lege football is more a game of
coaches, like Bear Bryant, and
the institutions themselves, while
pro football is more like a busi
ness."
There is also a big difference in
the type of advertisers pro foot
ball and college football attract.
While pro football attracts more
beer advertisers and broadcasts
to a generally younger audience,
college football has an older,
more educated audience which
also includes more women.
The analysts for a college foot
ball telecast must also have a dif
ferent type of background. While
John Madden may be CBS's No.
I color man for pro football, the
credentials for a college analyst
must also include insight into the
college game and the pageantry
which surrounds it.
Pat Haden, the ex-USC and
Ram quarterback and the analyst
for today's game, brings in im
pressive credentials, but admits
that doing a broadcast is much
harder it seems.
"It's much more difficult than
it looks," Haden said about
doing a telecast. "There are a lot
of things going on that the au
dience does not know about. I've
got 20 seconds to say what I want
between plays, and my producer
is constantly giving me directions

while I am talking."
Although there are differences
between college and pro football,
there is one common de
nominator: both involve large
sums of money.
'Robert Fishman, lead director
for CBS College Sports, joked
the other day that Stanford Ath
letic Director Andy Geiger had a
$500,000 bet on the Milwalkee
Brewers-California Angels
playoff series. As astounding as
that sounds, Fishman's
statement is not that much off the
mark.
If the Angels made it to the
world series, Fishman said that
CBS would probably not have
gone with a national college
game especially a West Coast
game to compete with the
Angels telecast on the West-
Coast.
Televison today means big
money. Stanford will keep close
to $300,000 of its $530,000 share.
Due to the Pac-lOs complicated
revenue sharing plan, the revenue
schools receive today from
networks would be unheard just
a couple of years ago.
This is the first year that CBS
has become involved with college
football a traditional bastion
of ABC and the inclusion of
college football did not come

cheap. CBS and ABC are now
joined in a $223 million package
with the NCAA. Ironically, the
profits won't start to be realized
until the third and fourth year of
the contract.
While several years ago sports
television was not a money-mak
ing venture, it now accounts for
some 25 percent of network prof
its. Watching this high-stake
network poker game are athletic
directors like Andy Geiger.

With John Elway as his leading 1
ace, Stanford is making its thircj
appearance on television this 1
year second nationally and
the Athletic Department is well
on its way to its best year ever. If
the Cardinal wins today, there's a
good chance ABC will nationally
televise the Washington game.
With a little luck, Stanford will
also be invited to a bowl. The
stakes are well over half a million
dollars. And some people think
college athletics are just for fun
