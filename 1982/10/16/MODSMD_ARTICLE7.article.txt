# Third tailback Spencer does the job for USC
## 
### MARK ZEIGLER 
For a Stanford fan, it's kind of
scarv to know that USC starting
tailback Todd Spencer was once
a fullback.
In recent seasons, Heisman
trophy tailbacks Marcus Allen
and Rickv Bell riddled Cardinal
defenses, picking up seven and
eight yards a carry and scoring
touchdowns like they were going
out of style. They both were full
backs at one time during their
stay in Trojanland, too.
Even scarier for the Card isn't
SC tailbacks, but who's in front
of them doing the dirty-work
in other words, the blockers. On
sheer bulk, "the line" is im
timidating enough. Try an aver
age of 6-5 '/2, 265 pounds on for
size.

"I have a line with three Ail-
American candidates (guard
Bruce Matthews, tackle Don
Mosebar and center Tony
Slaton)," Spencer said. "These
guys blocked for two Heisman
trophy winners. They basically
know what they're doing. They
don't make too many mistakes."
Thus far this season, Spencer
has rushed for a Trojan tops 261
yards in 54 carries, averaging
nearly five yards a crack. He has
also caught 10 passes good for

129 yards. Although his longest
run is just 21 yards, the SC junior
has not yet been thrown for a
loss.
Spencer didn't make the switch
from fullback to tailback, how
ever, as easily or as predictably as
did Allen and Davis. In fact, so
amazing are the course of events
that handed Spencer the starting
job, he calls it "a dream come
true."
Recruited as tailback, Spencer
was moved to fullback his
sophomore season. You just
don't beat out a Marcus Allen.
As a fullback, he was the Trojans'
second leading rusher, amassing
377 yards on 62 attempts, an av
erage of over six yards a carry. He
also averaged 17.7 yards return
ing kickoffs.
At the start of this campaign,
junior Spencer was slated to start
at the up position, with another
junior, 5-11, 185-pound Michael
Harper filling Allen's shoes.
"The opportunity to play full
back was a stepping stone," he
said. But Spencer didn't have to
do much stepping. All he did was
watch and wait.
It didn't take long for the first
Trojan to fall. Harper sprained
an ankle in SC's 17-9 opening
loss to Florida. Sophomore Fred

Crutcher, an inch shorter but 10
pounds heavier than Harper, had
the next honors at what would
become an injury-prone position
for the Trojans.
A game and three quarters lat
er, Crutcher tore up a knee
against Oklahoma. In 61 carries,
he gained 243 net yards, a nearly
4 yards per carry average.
Next it was Zephrini Lee's
chance. Also a sophomore, Lee
(6-2 '/2, 204 lbs.) finished off the
final quarter of the Sooner con
test, but ran with noticeable inex
perience and tentativeness. It was
time to find a fourth re
placement.
Enter Todd Spencer. The 6-0,
195-pound Trojan made a more
than impressive debut at tailback
in SC's most recent game, a 38-7
victory over Oregon 149
yards, 29 carries, three TD's and
three pass receptions good for 48
more yards. The man was hungry
for the position.
The stats were reminiscent of
his high school days at El Cerrito
High near Berkeley. In three
years as a prep tailback, Spencer
rushed for 3666 yards and scored
37 touchdowns, including four
200-vard games.
"I think any young kid that has

Spencer may not yet be another Marcus Allen, but he has done
an excellent job. Spencer was moved to tailback after the first
two starters went down with injuries.
