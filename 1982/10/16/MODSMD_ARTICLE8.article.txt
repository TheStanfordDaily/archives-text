# Band strikes back to silence fiendish foes from the South
## 
### 
For hundreds of years,
marching band music was dull,
the formations were boring and
the humor was non-existent. This
was due largely to the influence
of the evil Empire led by the Ter
rible Tommy Trojan and his hor
rible horde of USC storm
troopers. These mass-produced
crimson and gold musical
monsters, their faces obscured by
tacky Trojan helmets, paraded
around the country forcing them
selves upon an unwilling public
who had no provisions for self
defense.
The stormtroopers' domi
nance might have continued for
centuries unchecked if it were not
for the unexpected birth of a frail
lad by the unlikely name of Ray
Gruenwald. His early life in the
village of Seattle was marked by a
lack of excitement. In fact, he

spent the first 17 years of his life
in a dark room.
It was at an early age when lit
tle Ray began to learn of the suf
fering and torment caused by the
evil Empire. He immediately felt
a flame kindle inside him, and he
later spoke of his wrath to his
wise neighbor Hargee-Don Ken
nedy. This learned gentleman ad
vised little Ray to journey to the
far-off colony known as the
Farm. There, Hargee-Don said,
Rav could find a true home
among the stalwart band of re
bels who stood alone against the
awesome power of the Trojan
troops.
In the course of his trek to the
Farm, Ray met many other re
bels including John Who Dee
Two, an expert at organizing re
sistence, and Hal Solo, who of
fered verbal support as the Voice

of the Band.
Upon the completion of four
years of intense but free-spirited
training, he was ready. As his
final christening, Ray was
stripped of his given name and
became Ray the Disco Sky
walker. At last, the scene was set
for the rebels' revolutionary
movement to begin.
The timing was perfect, in fact,
for the Farm had been forced
down to its last lines of defense
against the Boring Band Move
ment. Just one year earlier the

Rebel Band's own supporters
had begun to turn against them.
The Rebels themselves had, at
times, appeared to be bored, list
less and uncreative. They were
showing signs of defeat.
And then came the fall of 1982.
The battles began to be staged
fast and furiously. There was a
warm-up on the Farm during the
San Jose St. game. Although the
opposition was weak, the "Disco
Skvwalker" led the Band
through a spectacular per
formance which succeeded in

winning back support from the
citizens.
Another stormtrooper
division from the north, Oregon
St., tried unsuccessfully to crush
the Rebels. Again, the Band drew
raving reviews from the locals
while crushing the cacophonous
clatter of the Beaver marchers
and exposing their boring ten
dencies.

Time marched on. The Rebel
Band, now known as LSJUMB,
set off on its first crusade, a road
trip to Arizona St. in Tempe. The

campus was an angry place that
had been completely
brainwashed by the regional out
post of the Evil Boring Band Em
pire the ASU band. It was a
place that did not believe in the
powers of the Disco Skywalker.
All this, however, was quickly
changed in one evening during
which another Stormtrooper
outpost was wiped out by the Re
bels to be replaced by a crowd of
friendly fans and media types
who complimented the Band in
finitely.
The news of the destruction
that the Rebels had been causing
to the Empire soon reached Tom
my Trojan. He decided to send
his main arsenal to the north.
Today's nationally televised
game will begin in the same fash
ion that practically every other
Stanford-USC matchup has
started. The Terrible Trojan
Band will present a pre-game
show specifically designed to
both outwardly wow and inward
ly bore the audience. Once they
leave the field, however, the
norm will suddenly change.
Sat., Oct. 16, 1982. The ul
timate confrontation. The Band
vs. The Trojan Band. The Rebels
vs. The Evil Empire. Rock 'n
Roll vs. High Stepping Marches.
The Disco Skywalker vs. An Ob
scure USC Drum Major. And,
what is more, the mass-produced
crimson and gold musical
monster will finally lose its evil
power hold on the citizens-of this
country. ■■■. -

Today's nationally televised
game will begin in the same fash

Stanford-USC matchup has
started. The Terrible Trojan
Band will present a pre-game
show specifically designed to

norm will suddenly change.
Sat., Oct. 16, 1982. The ul
timate confrontation. The Band
vs. The Trojan Band. The Rebels
vs. The Evil Empire. Rock 'n
Roll vs. High Stepping Marches.
The Disco Skywalker vs. An Ob
scure USC Drum Major. And,
what is more, the mass-produced
crimson and gold musical
monster will finally lose its evil
power hold on the citizens-of this
country. ■■■. -

BAND FIGHTS TROJAN MENACE: The incomperable Leland Stanford Junior Marching
Band is seen here in fight formation. Led by Disco Ray Sky walker and a host of other intergalactic
fighters, the band will dual today with the Trojans from the South.
For hundreds of years,
marching band music was dull,
the formations were boring and
the humor was non-existent. This
was due largely to the influence
of the evil Empire led by the Ter
rible Tommy Trojan and his hor
rible horde of USC storm
troopers. These mass-produced
crimson and gold musical
monsters, their faces obscured by
tacky Trojan helmets, paraded
around the country forcing them
selves upon an unwilling public
who had no provisions for self
defense.
The stormtroopers' domi
nance might have continued for
centuries unchecked if it were not
for the unexpected birth of a frail
lad by the unlikely name of Ray
Gruenwald. His early life in the
village of Seattle was marked by a
lack of excitement. In fact, he

spent the first 17 years of his life
in a dark room.
It was at an early age when lit
tle Ray began to learn of the suf
fering and torment caused by the
evil Empire. He immediately felt
a flame kindle inside him, and he
later spoke of his wrath to his
wise neighbor Hargee-Don Ken
nedy. This learned gentleman ad
vised little Ray to journey to the
far-off colony known as the
Farm. There, Hargee-Don said,
Rav could find a true home
among the stalwart band of re
bels who stood alone against the
awesome power of the Trojan
troops.
In the course of his trek to the
Farm, Ray met many other re
bels including John Who Dee
Two, an expert at organizing re
sistence, and Hal Solo, who of
fered verbal support as the Voice

of the Band.
Upon the completion of four
years of intense but free-spirited
training, he was ready. As his
final christening, Ray was
stripped of his given name and
became Ray the Disco Sky
walker. At last, the scene was set
for the rebels' revolutionary
movement to begin.
The timing was perfect, in fact,
for the Farm had been forced
down to its last lines of defense
against the Boring Band Move
ment. Just one year earlier the

Rebel Band's own supporters
had begun to turn against them.
The Rebels themselves had, at
times, appeared to be bored, list
less and uncreative. They were
showing signs of defeat.
And then came the fall of 1982.
The battles began to be staged
fast and furiously. There was a
warm-up on the Farm during the
San Jose St. game. Although the
opposition was weak, the "Disco
Skvwalker" led the Band
through a spectacular per
formance which succeeded in

winning back support from the
citizens.
Another stormtrooper
division from the north, Oregon
St., tried unsuccessfully to crush
the Rebels. Again, the Band drew
raving reviews from the locals
while crushing the cacophonous
clatter of the Beaver marchers
and exposing their boring ten
dencies.

Time marched on. The Rebel
Band, now known as LSJUMB,
set off on its first crusade, a road
trip to Arizona St. in Tempe. The

campus was an angry place that
had been completely
brainwashed by the regional out
post of the Evil Boring Band Em
pire the ASU band. It was a
place that did not believe in the
powers of the Disco Skywalker.
All this, however, was quickly
changed in one evening during
which another Stormtrooper
outpost was wiped out by the Re
bels to be replaced by a crowd of
friendly fans and media types
who complimented the Band in
finitely.
The news of the destruction
that the Rebels had been causing
to the Empire soon reached Tom
my Trojan. He decided to send
his main arsenal to the north.
