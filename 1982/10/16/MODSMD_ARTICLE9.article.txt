# Dressel emerges in offense
## 
### JOHN CALLON 
Scoring summaries, those
cryptic one-line blurbs that tell
you who got into the end zone
with the ball, rarely convey the
"true" story of any touchdown
drive. It's like reading the last
chapter of a suspenseful novel
and ignoring the preceding 500
pages. But if you added a little ex
planatory section, "Key Gains",
you could obtain more insight
into how the ball came to be near
the end zone in the first place.
And that is what senior Chris
Dressel is all about.

You won't find the 6-4,235-lb.
tight end in a scoring summary
sheet too often. In fact, he scored
his first touchdown in this sea
son's opening game against
Purdue. Stanford utilizes its tight
ends mainly inside the five-yard
line and on a passing down.
Dressel has simply lacked the op
portunity to demonstrate his
potential.

"I'd like to score more,"
Dressel confided, "but I'm not
hungry for that specifically.
Catches in key drives and getting
the team to the end zone is just as
important."

All fingers point to the 23-20
victory against Ohio State as the
real turning point in the Dressel
as-a-receiver story. His eight re
ceptions and 104 yards translated

into renewed confidence on all
sides.
"It was a good game as far as
myself and John (QB Elway)
were concerned. It gave John the
confidence to look for me in the
middle," he recalled.
Receiver coach Dave Ottmar
agreed, "It's not that we ever re
ally doubted that he could do it,
it's just that he went out and re
proved it."
Last week against Arizona
State, Dressel reaffirmed his
potential by leading all receivers
with six receptions for 82 yards.
Two of those catches were in
strumental in sustaining drives
for a field goal and the last touch
down.

Looking at the statistics, it's
hard to avoid saying that Dressel
has blossomed as a pass catcher.
For the first time he is attracting
attention for his grabbing saves
and impressive moves. In fact, his
21 receptions for 282 yards after
just five / games far surpass last
year's 19 for 234 total. But
Dressel contends that he has had
the ability all along. He simply
needed to fill a different role.

The 1982 Cardinal press guide
notes that Dressel is "an
absolutely dominant blocker,"
and Stanford, until this fall, re
lied on this talent almost ex
clusively.

In 1980, in his first year as a
starter, Chris had 22 catches,
above average statistics consider
ing that All-Americans Kenny
Margerum and Darrin Nelson
were also clammoring for the
football. Last year, as Ottmar re
membered, "It was a calculated
effort to get the ball to White and
to Nelson, so we had to use Chris
as a blocker; in a sense, we sacri
ficed him."
The receivers coach went on to
highlight yet another reason for
Dressel's new look. "In practice
this year our emphasis has been
to utilize him as a receiver. Last
year we were trying to get the best
of both worlds. He's performing
better in the games, just because
he's practicing it more."
Chris has a more concise ex
planation for his recent emer
gence from the low profile posi
tion. "I've always been a good re
ceiver, and a receiver will make
more spectacular grabswhen he is
thrown the ball more often.
Again, it's a matter of opportuni
ty."
Opportunities to catch the ball
have been few and far between
for Dressel the past two seasons,
but using the tight end to "exploit
the middle, with the run-blocking
emphasis switched to receiving"
is certainly part of this year's


Greg Webb/Daily
I CAN CATCH: Opposing defenses, which had not seen too
much of Chris Dressel in the past couple of years, have seen more
than enough of Stanford's tight end this season. Dressel has
caught 21 passes for 282 yards and has consistently made clutch
catches all season.
game plan. He relates, "Last year
was a letdown as far as receiving
goes, due to Darrin getting the
ball a lot. In fact, over the last
three games not one pass was
thrown to me. The first two
games this yer were a bit frustrat
ing with just two catches in each,
but since the Ohio State game, I
think it's been easier to call my
number."
As the season wears on, fans
will no doubt be seeing more of
number 88 with the ball, some
thing the pro scouts will certainly
be taking note of. Dressel was re
cently included in a write-up of
the top tight end prospects in col
lege football today by Pro Foot
ball Weekly.

Dressel admitted that he does
have professional aspirations. "I
came here to get an education,
and when June comes, I'll have

that. As far as the pros are con
cerned, I'm working as hard as I
can for that, too. It's something
I'd like to do I can't do it when
I get older."
Head Coach Paul Wiggin
agreed. "The pro scouts that
evaluated our spring think he has
a promising future in football."
A future complete with "Key
Gains."

than enough of Stanford's tight end this season. Dressel has
caught 21 passes for 282 yards and has consistently made clutch
catches all season.
game plan. He relates, "Last year
was a letdown as far as receiving
goes, due to Darrin getting the
ball a lot. In fact, over the last
three games not one pass was
thrown to me. The first two
games this yer were a bit frustrat
ing with just two catches in each,
but since the Ohio State game, I
think it's been easier to call my
number."
As the season wears on, fans
will no doubt be seeing more of
number 88 with the ball, some
thing the pro scouts will certainly
be taking note of. Dressel was re
cently included in a write-up of
the top tight end prospects in col
lege football today by Pro Foot
ball Weekly.

Dressel admitted that he does
have professional aspirations. "I
came here to get an education,
and when June comes, I'll have

that. As far as the pros are con
cerned, I'm working as hard as I
can for that, too. It's something
I'd like to do I can't do it when
I get older."
Head Coach Paul Wiggin
agreed. "The pro scouts that
evaluated our spring think he has
a promising future in football."
A future complete with "Key
Gains."
Scoring summaries, those
cryptic one-line blurbs that tell
you who got into the end zone
with the ball, rarely convey the
"true" story of any touchdown
drive. It's like reading the last
chapter of a suspenseful novel
and ignoring the preceding 500
pages. But if you added a little ex
planatory section, "Key Gains",
you could obtain more insight
into how the ball came to be near
the end zone in the first place.
And that is what senior Chris
Dressel is all about.

You won't find the 6-4,235-lb.
tight end in a scoring summary
sheet too often. In fact, he scored
his first touchdown in this sea
son's opening game against
Purdue. Stanford utilizes its tight
ends mainly inside the five-yard
line and on a passing down.
Dressel has simply lacked the op
portunity to demonstrate his
potential.

"I'd like to score more,"
Dressel confided, "but I'm not
hungry for that specifically.
Catches in key drives and getting
the team to the end zone is just as
important."

All fingers point to the 23-20
victory against Ohio State as the
real turning point in the Dressel
as-a-receiver story. His eight re
ceptions and 104 yards translated

into renewed confidence on all
sides.
"It was a good game as far as
myself and John (QB Elway)
were concerned. It gave John the
confidence to look for me in the
middle," he recalled.
Receiver coach Dave Ottmar
agreed, "It's not that we ever re
ally doubted that he could do it,
it's just that he went out and re
proved it."
Last week against Arizona
State, Dressel reaffirmed his
potential by leading all receivers
with six receptions for 82 yards.
Two of those catches were in
strumental in sustaining drives
for a field goal and the last touch
down.

Looking at the statistics, it's
hard to avoid saying that Dressel
has blossomed as a pass catcher.
For the first time he is attracting
attention for his grabbing saves
and impressive moves. In fact, his
21 receptions for 282 yards after
just five / games far surpass last
year's 19 for 234 total. But
Dressel contends that he has had
the ability all along. He simply
needed to fill a different role.

The 1982 Cardinal press guide
notes that Dressel is "an
absolutely dominant blocker,"
and Stanford, until this fall, re
lied on this talent almost ex
clusively.

In 1980, in his first year as a
starter, Chris had 22 catches,
above average statistics consider
ing that All-Americans Kenny
Margerum and Darrin Nelson
were also clammoring for the
football. Last year, as Ottmar re
membered, "It was a calculated
effort to get the ball to White and
to Nelson, so we had to use Chris
as a blocker; in a sense, we sacri
ficed him."
The receivers coach went on to
highlight yet another reason for
Dressel's new look. "In practice
this year our emphasis has been
to utilize him as a receiver. Last
year we were trying to get the best
of both worlds. He's performing
better in the games, just because
he's practicing it more."
Chris has a more concise ex
planation for his recent emer
gence from the low profile posi
tion. "I've always been a good re
ceiver, and a receiver will make
more spectacular grabswhen he is
thrown the ball more often.
Again, it's a matter of opportuni
ty."
Opportunities to catch the ball
have been few and far between
for Dressel the past two seasons,
but using the tight end to "exploit
the middle, with the run-blocking
emphasis switched to receiving"
is certainly part of this year's
