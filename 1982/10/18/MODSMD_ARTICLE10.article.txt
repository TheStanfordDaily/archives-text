## The 						Stanford Daily The 						misleading ratings game 
### 
Quick. Who's the number-one student in your
class? Who's number two? Who brings up the rear?
Ridiculous questions? Of course. There is simply
no way anyone can look at a class of 1500 students
and decide who is best, who is second-best and who
is worst. There are too many complicating factors,
too many things that can't be labeled good or bad.
Still, people tend to take such rankings at face-val
ue. That's why the University wisely refrains from
ranking students at all, even going so far as not to
compile grade point averages.
And that's why we wish that others, especially
those who recently released a report ranking math
and science departments at universities across the
country, would show equal restraint. It's just as ar
bitrary and just as misleading to say, for instance,
that our physics department is the seventh-best in
the country as it is to say that your freshman room
mate is the seventh-best person in your class.
This isn't sour grapes. Although some depart
ments here didn't score as well as the University
might have liked, all got good marks, and the com
puter science and the statistics-biostatics depart
ments earned number-one honors.
Rather, it's a word of caution. Although many

professors here rightly played down the signifi
cance of such rankings, arguing that they were
based on some rather trivial factors, others seemed
to take them far too seriously. Reaction in depart
ments ranged from elation to disappointment, de
pending on the rating received, because professors
knew that status-conscious students and colleagues
— no small group — are certain to take note of such
attention-getting top-10 lists in their pursuit of ad
mission to or tenure at one of the "better" schools.
It's unhealthy to put such stake in arbitrary rank
ings. Those who do so are overlooking the fact that
such numbers alone can't show factors that could
be crucial to an educational experience — a close,
working relationship with a particular professor,
for example. It is a mistake to choose a school only
on the basis of its reputed rank; it's a mistake
that many students here have already committed
once.
The way we look at it, rankings of universities are
good for two things: to list on resumes and to write
home about when you ask for money. Beyond that,
they should be taken with quite a bit more than the
proverbial grain of salt.
