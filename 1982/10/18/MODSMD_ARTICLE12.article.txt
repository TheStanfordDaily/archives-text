## Bilateral arms freeze only first step in dispelling 'deterrence' myth 
### 
"What is needed is less 'arms control' than control of the
political and military leaders who deploy these arms. And it is
this which is (in the eyes of those leaders) the peace movement s
greatest offense."
The current popular interest in the possibility of a super
power freeze on nuclear weapons development and deploy
ment presents us with an excellent opportunity to examine
seriously one of the social forces pushing us towards holo
caust, namely, ideology. The "arms race" is scarcely due
solely to some sort of abstract, disinterested evaluation of
"enemy threats."
Ideology may at first appear to be so crude that it cannot
possibly have any impact on decisions about nuclear weap
ons. We all hear the government and media ranting, to some
extent, about "godless Communists out for world domi
nation," and (I hope) maintain some healthy skepticism; af
ter all, the world is far more complex than any slogan. Yet
ideology is such a pervasive influence that we may not even
be aware of how it filters the information we receive. Con
sider, for example, the manner in which the weapons them
selves are described to us. Soviet missiles are "monsters" and
"a threat to the Free World"; those belonging to the United
States are benignly labeled as "a deterrent." Somehow mor
alistic attributes have been assigned to weapons of mass de
struction; the weapons themselves, of course, remain un
changed — instruments of mass murder — regardless of the
owners or their intentions. This ideological labeling is quite
effective on the home front: after all, who can oppose "a de
terrent" or the concept of "deterrence?"
One person who has critiqued this concept is the British
historian and peace activist E.P. Thompson, who comments
in Beyond the Cold War that "deterrence is at heart a very

simple-minded idea, which occurred to the first cave men
when they got hold of clubs ... The thought has gone on,
through armies and empires, dreadnoughts and gas; all that
a historian can say is that sometimes it has worked for a
while, and sometimes it has not, but always in the end it has
broken down. All that is new about it now is that the clubs of

Forget that Soviet occupation forces
withdrew from Austria on schedule in
the 19505. Forget that Finland, an ally
of the Nazis, was never subjected to
occupation.

today, the technology of destruction, are so immense as to
defy rational exercise. It is this which made an old (and
massively-disproved) theory appear plausible once more, for
a while."
One common argument intended to demonstrate that
"deterrence worked" is the following: there has not been a
major European war since World War II; there would have
been such a war if not for the existence of nuclear weapons;
therefore, deterrence has worked. This argument, of course,
is inherently untestable — and we wouldn't want it to be
testable — and carries with itself a host of assumptions, prin
cipally the following: the Soviet leadership constantly
slavers at the thought of bringing all of Europe under its
sway. Forget that Soviet occupation forces withdrew from
Austria on schedule in the 19505. Forget that Finland, an

ally of the Nazis, was never subjected to occupation. Forget
that Yugoslavia and Albania, which liberated themselves
from the Nazis by dint of the struggle of indigenous Com
munist forces (the non-Communists were too busy col
laborating), have long since extricated themselves from the
Soviet orbit without calling upon the U.S. "deterrent." This
bit of history has no propaganda value. The continuing Sovi
et domination, if not military occupation, of Eastern Eu
rope, is much better in this regard.
The origin of modern deterrence theory is in itself an in
teresting piece of history. Recall that the atom bomb was
never conceived and built to be a deterrent; it was intended
to be used against Germany and Japan, and was, of course,
used against the latter. The transmutation of the bomb from
weapon to deterrent seems to have coincided with its acquisi
tion by the Soviet Union. In the succeeding 30 or so years, a
whole host of new weapons of ever-increasing deadlines
have appeared on the scene, all blessed by the gurus of
"strategic thinking" as capable of deterring some imagined
scenario of Soviet attack or intrigue. Militarists eager to im
press allies and Third World countries with U.S. strength,
weapons designers looking out for their jobs, aerospace
firms eager for more assured profits from the public trough,
jingoist politicians anxious to show their "resolve" — all
these keep up the momentum for new weapons. Deterrence
theory comes in afterwards to explain away what is basically
a domestic phenomenon. A similar process is likely at work
in the Soviet Union (albeit the profit motive gives way there
to other forms of self-interest).
In fact, deterrence theory has proved to be such a flexible
ideological tool that it has recently been refined to include
the Orwellian concept of "pre-emptive deterrence," for

which we must thank another "strategic analyst," Michacl
Nacht. As becomes rapidly apparent from Nacht's exposi
tion of the concept in Daedalus (Winter 1981), "pre-emptive
deterrence" is nothing more than aggressive actions aimed at
the Third World to seize control of important resources,
such as petroleum. The "deterrence" comes in, of course, in
the usual way; the ever-plotting Soviet rulers are supposed to
have their greedy eyes on the resources in question, so we
must, of course, "deter" the Soviet action and send in the
Rapid Deployment Force (a type of behavior known as "im
perialistic aggression" in earlier, less enlightened times). Of
course, as presidents of both parties assure us, the United
States would only take such action to protect "vital Western
interests." This has a certain familiar ring to it — something
along the lines of Brezhnev's "protection of a fraternal so
cialist country" as the tanks were rolling into Prague — but
never mind.
The bottom line on deterrence is most clearly expressed by
Thompson and other European peace activists; namely, de
terrence theory presupposes an eternal state of hostility be
tween power blocs, and, in so doing, perpetuates this very
state of affairs and legitimates the suppression of dissent and
the bullying of allies (witness the Reagan Admin/'straf/on's |
wrath as several NATO allies attempt to transcend partiatty
some Cold War strictures and the concomitant media cov
erage of our "disobedient" allies). A bit of honest criticism
of the superpowers' goals and intentions is — besides pres
sure for bilateral disarmament — possibly the most valuable
contribution that the peace movement can make at this time.

The current popular interest in the possibility of a super
power freeze on nuclear weapons development and deploy
ment presents us with an excellent opportunity to examine
seriously one of the social forces pushing us towards holo
caust, namely, ideology. The "arms race" is scarcely due
solely to some sort of abstract, disinterested evaluation of
"enemy threats."
Ideology may at first appear to be so crude that it cannot
possibly have any impact on decisions about nuclear weap
ons. We all hear the government and media ranting, to some
extent, about "godless Communists out for world domi
nation," and (I hope) maintain some healthy skepticism; af
ter all, the world is far more complex than any slogan. Yet
ideology is such a pervasive influence that we may not even
be aware of how it filters the information we receive. Con
sider, for example, the manner in which the weapons them
selves are described to us. Soviet missiles are "monsters" and
"a threat to the Free World"; those belonging to the United
States are benignly labeled as "a deterrent." Somehow mor
alistic attributes have been assigned to weapons of mass de
struction; the weapons themselves, of course, remain un
changed — instruments of mass murder — regardless of the
owners or their intentions. This ideological labeling is quite
effective on the home front: after all, who can oppose "a de
terrent" or the concept of "deterrence?"
One person who has critiqued this concept is the British
historian and peace activist E.P. Thompson, who comments
in Beyond the Cold War that "deterrence is at heart a very

simple-minded idea, which occurred to the first cave men
when they got hold of clubs ... The thought has gone on,
through armies and empires, dreadnoughts and gas; all that
a historian can say is that sometimes it has worked for a
while, and sometimes it has not, but always in the end it has
broken down. All that is new about it now is that the clubs of

Forget that Soviet occupation forces
withdrew from Austria on schedule in
the 19505. Forget that Finland, an ally
of the Nazis, was never subjected to
occupation.

today, the technology of destruction, are so immense as to
defy rational exercise. It is this which made an old (and
massively-disproved) theory appear plausible once more, for
a while."
One common argument intended to demonstrate that
"deterrence worked" is the following: there has not been a
major European war since World War II; there would have
been such a war if not for the existence of nuclear weapons;
therefore, deterrence has worked. This argument, of course,
is inherently untestable — and we wouldn't want it to be
testable — and carries with itself a host of assumptions, prin
cipally the following: the Soviet leadership constantly
slavers at the thought of bringing all of Europe under its
sway. Forget that Soviet occupation forces withdrew from
Austria on schedule in the 19505. Forget that Finland, an

ally of the Nazis, was never subjected to occupation. Forget
that Yugoslavia and Albania, which liberated themselves
from the Nazis by dint of the struggle of indigenous Com
munist forces (the non-Communists were too busy col
laborating), have long since extricated themselves from the
Soviet orbit without calling upon the U.S. "deterrent." This
bit of history has no propaganda value. The continuing Sovi
et domination, if not military occupation, of Eastern Eu
rope, is much better in this regard.
The origin of modern deterrence theory is in itself an in
teresting piece of history. Recall that the atom bomb was
never conceived and built to be a deterrent; it was intended
to be used against Germany and Japan, and was, of course,
used against the latter. The transmutation of the bomb from
weapon to deterrent seems to have coincided with its acquisi
tion by the Soviet Union. In the succeeding 30 or so years, a
whole host of new weapons of ever-increasing deadlines
have appeared on the scene, all blessed by the gurus of
"strategic thinking" as capable of deterring some imagined
scenario of Soviet attack or intrigue. Militarists eager to im
press allies and Third World countries with U.S. strength,
weapons designers looking out for their jobs, aerospace
firms eager for more assured profits from the public trough,
jingoist politicians anxious to show their "resolve" — all
these keep up the momentum for new weapons. Deterrence
theory comes in afterwards to explain away what is basically
a domestic phenomenon. A similar process is likely at work
in the Soviet Union (albeit the profit motive gives way there
to other forms of self-interest).
In fact, deterrence theory has proved to be such a flexible
ideological tool that it has recently been refined to include
the Orwellian concept of "pre-emptive deterrence," for

which we must thank another "strategic analyst," Michacl
Nacht. As becomes rapidly apparent from Nacht's exposi
tion of the concept in Daedalus (Winter 1981), "pre-emptive
deterrence" is nothing more than aggressive actions aimed at
the Third World to seize control of important resources,
such as petroleum. The "deterrence" comes in, of course, in
the usual way; the ever-plotting Soviet rulers are supposed to
have their greedy eyes on the resources in question, so we
must, of course, "deter" the Soviet action and send in the
Rapid Deployment Force (a type of behavior known as "im
perialistic aggression" in earlier, less enlightened times). Of
course, as presidents of both parties assure us, the United
States would only take such action to protect "vital Western
interests." This has a certain familiar ring to it — something
along the lines of Brezhnev's "protection of a fraternal so
cialist country" as the tanks were rolling into Prague — but
never mind.
The bottom line on deterrence is most clearly expressed by
Thompson and other European peace activists; namely, de
terrence theory presupposes an eternal state of hostility be
tween power blocs, and, in so doing, perpetuates this very
state of affairs and legitimates the suppression of dissent and
the bullying of allies (witness the Reagan Admin/'straf/on's |
wrath as several NATO allies attempt to transcend partiatty
some Cold War strictures and the concomitant media cov
erage of our "disobedient" allies). A bit of honest criticism
of the superpowers' goals and intentions is — besides pres
sure for bilateral disarmament — possibly the most valuable
contribution that the peace movement can make at this time.
