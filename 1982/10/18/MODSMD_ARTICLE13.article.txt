## Temporary loss of Lech Walesa does not mean end of Solidarity 
### 
Name a world figure with the initials
"L.W." Too difficult? Ten months ago
the answer would have been a give
away: Lech Walesa, the head of the
Polish trade union Solidarity. Then
came martial law. And as quickly as
some Americans had memorized
Walesa's name for cocktail parties, they
tossed him away to history's rubbish
pile.
However, when Gdansk dock work
ers arrived on the job last Monday
morning, spontaneous strike activity
began, followed by city-wide demon
strations. The Friday before, the Polish
martial-law government had issued a
law officially banning Solidarity. The
edict went further strikes were to be
outlawed and a false-faced union struc
ture was to be created under the aus
pices of the Communist Party.
Once again, Poland was in the news.
Journalists in New York and Washing
ton suddenly pointed out how we had
forgotten Solidarity. But no one asked
the most important question the recent
Polish disturbances raised: Why had we
forgotten Solidarity?
Casual observers of the Soviet bloc
remembered how reformist movements
were crushed in Hungary (1956) and in
Czechoslovakia (1968). However,

Americans watching events abroad
have patchy memories. We remember
that the Soviets won and we "lost" and
we think that Poland fits neatly (if sad
ly) into our simple matrix of under
standing.
Polish workers know better â€” they
know, unlike their Czech and Hungar
ian working class counterparts of the
past, how to organize themselves. With
the Solidarity leadership being de
tained, workers in Gdasnk and other
cities showed that they can function ef
fectively independent of their leaders.
This was not true in Hungary, where
the aborted inner-party reform move
ment was joined only in its final stages
by hopeful factions of the Hungarian
working class. After the violent Soviet
intervention in October 1956, some
25,000 lay dead from the fighting; and
forced emigration, deportation and ar
rests decimated the intellectual leader
ship. Workers lacked the organiza
tional ties needed to continue resistance
under the new government. The reform
movement did not survive.
Czechoslovakia's "Prague Spring" in
1968 also had its roots in the Com
munist party elite and the intelligentsia.
Workers followed, rather than led. As
in Hungary, experiments in independ

ent labor organization had barely got
ten off the ground before the invasion
of nearly 600,000 Soviet and Warsaw
Pact troops. A stiff passive resistance
followed. But Moscow and its few
Czech allies bided their time and even
tually disarmed the reformists by purg
ing the Communist Party, dismissing
liberal sympathizers from their jobs
and conducting trials.
In Poland, there has been no Soviet
intervention. As yet, there have been no
trials. Almost a year after the military
clamp down, the Polish workers remain
mobilized and surprisingly united.
They have recently experienced a rise to
power. Also, they hold one trump card
which Czech and Hungarian intellec
tuals did not have: the economy cannot
function without them.
The Polish situation is not merely one
in a chain of Soviet "victories" in
Eastern Europe. The government of
Gen. Wojciech Jaruzelski knows that
stiffening army control in the factories
is not a long-term solution. Eventually,
either Polish workers will give in or the
regime will have to change strategies.
With Solidarity demonstrations
planned for Nov. 10 (the second an
niversary of state recognition of the
union) and Dec. 13 (one year of martial

law), nothing is certain. It is unlikely
that Solidarity members will simply
give up, and it is doubtful that the
martial law government will risk politi
cal trials of the union leadership, much
less executions. Both Jaruzelski and
Moscow fear the creation of a rallying
point for the union. They would prefer
to wait.
However, as the Polish economy
wavers on the brink of disaster from
debts and underproduction, the waiting
game is not a comfortable one for
Polish authorities. The recent reaf
firmation of support for the reform
movement from the Polish pontiff in
Rome means that Jaruzelski has anoth
er major social force opposing the re
turn to "normalcy."
Whether Solidarity can be forced
into playing its card into the govern
ment's hand may well rest on the suc
cesses of the upcoming union demon
strations. At least for the near future,
the union has not capitulated. Similar
ly, recent firings of union mrmbers will
be effective only if Solidarity ruptures
internally.
Knowing the strength of Polish na
tionalism and facing the possibility of
an ungovernable country of 35 million
makes military intervention an un

savory prospect in Moscow, especially
while Afghanistan still broils. So Poles
will deal with Poles.
There are few firm conclusions that
can be drawn from the experiences of
Hungary and Czechoslovakia. Poland
is a unique situation of workers
challenging the state, and we do not yet
have means to judge Solidarity's
strengths or weaknesses in enduring
state persecution.
The future of Poland remains unwrit
ten, and neither the Soviet Union nor

the Polish Communist Party can com
pose it alone. In addition, the Brezhnev
succession may very soon distract Mos
cow and give the union some room to
work.
But the strength of the union or
ganization and the ideals it stands for
should not make us dismiss Walesa's re
turn.
