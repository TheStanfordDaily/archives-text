## Pahre column lacks complete understanding of Mideast history 
### 
In his column (Daily, Oct. 13), Bob
Pahre displays an incredible ignorance
of the Mideast situation. His historical
summary is replete with errors.
He completely ignores the fact that it
was the Arab Moslem invasion of the
Levant in the 7th century which drove
most Jews out of Israel. The dozens of
synagogues excavated, dating through
the 6th century testify to the vitality of
Jewish life before that time. However,
despite Arab persecutions, Jews have
always lived in Israel.
Furthermore, European Jews began
returning to Israel in the late 19th cen
tury, not after the Holocaust. For the
most part, the Jews settled on previous
ly unoccupied land, away from the Ar
abs. Most early Jewish settlement was

in the mostly swampy coastal plain,
while most Arabs lived in the hilly cen
tral region. According to the British
Peel report, "Much of the land now car
rying orange grove was sand dunes or
swamp and uncultivated when it was
purchased. Early 20th century Palestine
held only a small fraction of the popu
lation it held even during Roman times
(roughly 350,000 vs. about 3 million)."
While both sides engaged in "bomb
throwing," Jewish attacks were
directed against military targets, while
Arab attacks were usually directed
against civilians. Even the Etzel'i fa
mous attack on the King David Hotel
was directed against a military target,
the British central command post occu
pying a large part of the hotel. Two

hours before the blast, the British were
warned to evacuate the building. How
ever, even this was too aggressive for
the Hagannah (forerunner of the Israeli
army) which condemned it.
In any case, the Arabs started the
bomb throwing, not the Jews. In May,
1021, they rioted, burning settlements
and killing Jews from Tel Aviv to
Hadera. In August 1929, the Arabs
used a Jewish religious celebration at
the Western Wall as an excuse for na
tionwide riots which left 133 Jews dead.
This was a major escalation of the vio
lence.
While the Jews were unhappy with
the partition of Palestine, they accepted
it for the sake of peace. However, the
Arab armies of Egypt, Jordan and Syria

invaded Israel in a self-proclaimed at
tempt to drive the Jews into the sea.
Israel had no American planes with
which to have "bombed the Palesti
nians in their villages." At independ
ence the Israeli air force consisted of six
or seven ancient Auster biplanes, while
the Arabs had modern, World War II
surplus planes. Both sides were under
an American arms embargo after the
war started. In fact, Czechoslovakia,
under Russian influence, was the only
country to sell Israel arms during the
War of Independence.
