. In past years, the physician's need to see inside a patient's
ISody has been satisfied by X-ray examination. But now a
(lew tool, the Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) Imager,
tjased upon a phenomenon discovered thirty years ago by
Stanford Prof. Felix Bloch, for which he shared the 1952
Nobel prize in physics, promises to increase powerfully the
speed and certainty of medical diagnosis. In the view of some
researchers, it provides an unparalleled opportunity to study
Hie chemical activity in a living body without the disruption
of other means.
Medical X-ray machines provide information which is
bused upon varying absorption of ionizing radiation by
jiody tissues. This results in anatomical images on photo
graphic film. X-ray images can show abnormally shaped or
gans, and the radiologist can infer that disease is present.
However, X-rays give few clues as to whether an organ
ihat appears normal is working as it should. To augment the
<X-rav scan, chemicals called contrast media are injected to
tfiake certain portions of the body stand out, such as the
circulatory system, stomach or colon.
In the past decade, Computerized Tomography (CT)
l?odv scanners have also been developed. A CT scanner spins
»an X-ray source and a detector slowly around a patient to
jcreate a series of circular slices which aid in making correct
elinical diagnoses. These slices are called tomograms and ap
pear as pictures of a single plane, in the manner of a single
'piece from a loaf of bread. However, contrast media can
niause serious reactions in ill patients, and CT scans deliver a
substantial amount of potentially mutation-causing radi
ation to a patient's tissue.

NMR imaging requires no injected chemicals as contrast
media and uses harmless magnetic fields and radio-waves in
place of X-rays. NMR images are made on the basis of dif
ferences in hydrogen nucleus concentration in various tis
sues. Each type of tissue has a characteristic concentration of
hydrogen atoms incorporated into its molecules, atod a map
of hydrogen atom concentration will reflect organ struc
tures. NMR images can also be formed on the basis of the
chemical environments and structural rigidity found in each
tissue type.
NMR imagers effectively create CT-like tomographic im
ages of any portion of the body. A great advantage over CT
is that not only structural data but also biochemical in
formation can be gained. This allows any portion of a per
son's body to be studied as conveniently as if it were in a lab
oratory test tube. For biochemical studies, NMR offers the
added advantage of being non-radioactive and a probe that
does not enter the body. Tissues function exactly as they nor
mally do, entirely unaffected by experimental observation.
An atomic nucleus acts like a tiny bar magnet with its
magnetic field pointing along the axis of rotation. When
placed in a uniform external magnetic field the nuclei have a
tendency to align themselves with the direction of the ap
plied field. While in the magnetic field, the nuclei can be
made to absorb energy from a carefully shaped and tuned
electromagnetic pulse and become excited. Excitation re
• suits in a change in the average bearing of the nuclei's mag
netic fields, and the angle between the average magnetic field
direction and the applied field's direction increases. Once the
excitatory pulse ends, the nuclei lose energy through radio
emissions and return to their equilibrium position, lined up

with the applied magnetic field.
These radio emissions can be detected with a sensitive an
tenna, and form the basis of the NMR measurement. For
each nucleus in a given type of tissue this energy loss takes
place at a fixed rate. This rate defines a time called the "spin
lattice relaxation time" and is calculated from changes in the
nuclei's radio signals. Clinical studies performed by Dr.
Raymond Damadion at the State University of New York
demonstrated that tumors produce a dramatically different
spin-lattice relaxation time than other types of tissues, mak
ing it a potentially important instrument for early cancer de
tection.
Because atomic nuclei are quantum systems, they can only
absorb radio energy at specific frequencies. For a particular
nucleus, this frequency is dependent only upon the magnetic
field applied and is called the Larmor frequency. If a uni
form sample is placed in a graded magnetic field, as the field
strength changes along the magnetic gradient so will the
Larmor frequency of the radio pulse used to excite the sam
ple's nuclei. With a linear magnetic gradient, a one-to-one
correspondence exists between each point along the gradient
and a particular frequency of radio signal. By using a signal
of carefully defined frequency, any point along the gradient
can be isolated and its NMR characteristics independently
analyzed. Extending this technique to include gradients in
three dimensions and processing the information with a
computer generates tomographic images in which tissues
can be three-dimensionally located to within two* milli
meters.
NMR imagers can measure a large number of biological
factors in addition to producing three-dimensional pictures

of bodies. Because excited nuclei take a certain amount of
time to reach their equilibrium position through emission in
a flowing liquid, they may have moved from one position in
the magnetic field to another. This position change makes it
possible to calculate blood flow velocity to limbs and organs
through the larger blood vessels. When an NMR image is
used to measure these blood vessel's cross sectional areas,
blood flow volume as well can be determined by performing
a simple calculation.
Many elements can be detected using NMR devices and
produce clinically useful results. By broadcasting an ex
citatory radio signal tuned to phosphorus's resonant fre
quency, a physician can map phosphorus nucleus distribu
tion instead of that of hydrogen. Adenosine triphosphateand
adenosine diphosphate, the body's basic energy currencies,
both contain phosprous, and their concentration in muscles
and organs can be determined from the body's phosphorus
distribution. These concentrations are closely related to the
amount of energy the tissues consume and can indicate their
state of health.
Extensive clinical tests have so far found NMR entirely
safe. Now that medicine has a non-invasive imaging system
free from X-rays' dangerous ionizing radiation and contrast
media, a routine whole-body checkup, from the inside out, is
a practical possibility for the future. High resolution NMR
spectroscopy of hydrogen, phosphorus, lithium, and possi
bly carbon and nitrogen nuclei could be applied not only to
the detection of cancer but also to determining the chemical
causes of many other diseases.
