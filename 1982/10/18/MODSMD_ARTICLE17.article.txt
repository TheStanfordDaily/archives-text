# Lantos calls for end to production, deployment of nuclear arms
## 
### KEVIN GROSS 
. â€¢ .Congressman Tom Lantos (D-
San Mateo) said he believes there
is hope for the passage of a nucle
' ar freeze proposal in Congress in
* 1983, but emphasized that "the
message California will send .. .
is of enormous significance" in a
speech last Thursday night at
Kresge Auditorium.
Proposition 12, the bilateral
nuclear weapons freeze initiative
.that Californians will vote on in
November, would direct the gov
ernor to send a written message
urging the governments of the
United States and the Soviet

Union "to immediately halt the
testing, production and further
deployment of all nuclear weap
ons ... in a way that can be
checked and verified by both
sides," the initiative states.
Lantos began by discussing the
relationship between Proposition
12 and the fight for a nuclear
freeze in Congress. "I had the
pleasure of leading the fight for a
viable and verifiable nuclear
freeze in Congress. We won in
committee (the House Foreign
Affairs Committee on which
Lantos serves), but we lost in a
dramatic session on the floor, by

a 204-202 vote."
That the Soviets would emerge
with a decided military advan
tage is one of the primary argu
ments used against the Ken
nedy/Hatfield bilateral nuclear
freeze proposal. This argument,
Lantos said, is "without any mer
it whatsoever." He cited U.S.
Secretary of Defense Caspar
Weinberger and others who have
repeatedly asserted that they
would not trade the U.S. nuclear
arsenal for the Soviet's.
Addressing the issue of treaty
verification, Lantos stated, "1 am
convinced that verification is

feasible. We are clearly not talk
ing about trust." Verification, he
said, could be accurately main
tained through various means.
Referring to his earlier accusa
tion that freeze opponents show
"patterns of McCarthyism" by
labeling supporters of the freeze
as "KGB dupes," Lantos said, "I
think it is a preposterous insult to
a very large number of people in
all walks of life .. . who have
come to the rational conclusion
that a nuclear arms race is insani
ty."
He did, however, suggested

that various-outside "elements,"
alluding to KGB influence, may
be involved in the drive to sup
port the freeze.
During a question period in
the forum, several members of
the audience voiced concern
about trusting the Soviet Union,
and about the possibility for trea
ty violation. Noting that he is the
only member of Congress who

has lived under and fought
against both a Nazi and a Soviet
style dictatorship, Lantos said he
thinks the Soviets will allow on
site inspection.
"If there is anything we share
with the Soviet Union, we share a
desire for survival," he said. He
added that, in the case of a bla
tant treaty violation, the freeze
would be off.
