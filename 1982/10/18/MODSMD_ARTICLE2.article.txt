oiced to the Ombudsman, the Depart-

seriously," he said.
master's students in both print and
rnalism had several complaints about
ye programs. All but two of the stu
print journalism program signed the
they presented to Breitrose, Goheen
er, associate dean of graduate studies.
II consensus was that we didn't get our
:h last year," said Peggy Hernandez,
her master's in print journalism from
spring, and is now a reporter for the
i Examiner. She added that she and her
Is "feel that we've done well in spite of
to Hernandez, "There were a number
culiar to our year which we felt pre
ni getting adequate instruction." Spe
print students thought their program
wctured — requiring certain courses,
itory of American journalism, and not

requiring others such as ethics, which she said the
students felt were more important.
According to Breitrose, the department has made
several changes this year in response to the com
plaints about the structure of the programs. "We
have made some adjustments in the curriculum of
the master's programs, and have shifted several
courses to other times of the year so that there is a
more even and more rational organization to the
programs."
There were also problems with the professors last
year, according to Hernandez. While refusing to
give names, she said that the program suffered from
having one teacher on leave, one very ill, one up for
tenure, one only a guest lecturer and one busy with
outside interests.
In regard to the department's faculty last year,
Breitrose said, "We needed a full-time person to
handle the broadcast news program. And this year
we got him."
Finally, Hernandez said the theoretical aspects of
journalism were well taught, but not enough atten
tion was paid to the practical aspects of the students'
writing. "I think my outside experience contributed
more to my writing than the program did," she said.
Six out of seven students in the master's degree
program in broadcast journalism signed the memo
which they presented to Breitrose, Fetter and
Goheen. Linda Brown, who received her master's in
broadcast journalism from the University last
spring, described the program as "lacking in many
respects."
She cited the lack of adequate broadcast equip
ment as the major problem."What we shot our mas
ter's projects with is not broadcast quality," she
said, calling the program's equipment "shoddy."
She said, "there's no excuse" for Stanford having in
ferior equipment.
Breitrose commented that "the technology of
journalism is something that we need to attend to."
He added that when the department moves into its
new quarters later this fall, the equipment in the new
facilities should solve many of these problems.
These new facilites, located in Building 120 in the
front of the Quad, have cost the department 512.5

million in construction. Breitrose gave initial equip
ment estimates as $250,000 to $300,000.
Another serious problem with the program, ac
cording to Brown, was the lack of coordination with
existing resources on campus, such as the broadcast
equipment in the Engineering Department. "Ev
erything we needed exists on campus. They just
weren't coordinated," Brown said.
The broadcast journalism students also felt that
the University's program placed too much emphasis
on the academic aspects of their discipline and
shortchanged the technical training which they
needed to enter the profession. "The program was
just not set up to be a pre-professional program,
which it was meant to be," Brown said.
Brown did not comment on the quality of the
teaching in the department. "That's already been
dealt with in a way that I feel is adequate," she said,
referring to last spring's memo.
However, the students, Hernandez said, were not
ignored when they voiced their displeasure with the
programs. "We got a lot of feedback. A lot of people
thought we were upstarts, opinionated." She added
that one person in the department applauded their
efforts.
Most important, "the matter was discussed, and
we were told that the problems would not recur this
year," she said.
Current students in the master's degree programs
in print and broadcast journalism have generally
positive comments about the programs. "It's so
busy, it's hard to realize if there are any problems or
not," said Jane Galbraith, a student in print journal
ism.
Both print and broadcast students agree that the
programs have too theoretical a bias. "It's like being
taught how to be a good reporter or broadcaster out
of a book, instead of doing your thing out on the
field,"said broadcast student Themistocles
Themistocleous.
Several students, however, said they felt the facul
ty in broadcast were adequate. "The quality of the
teachers is just fine. I have no complaints,"
Galbraith said. "I'd say they lived up to what I'd
heard about Stanford," Themistocleous said.

equipment in the Engineering Department. "Ev
erything we needed exists on campus. They just
weren't coordinated," Brown said.
The broadcast journalism students also felt that
the University's program placed too much emphasis
on the academic aspects of their discipline and
shortchanged the technical training which they
needed to enter the profession. "The program was
just not set up to be a pre-professional program,
which it was meant to be," Brown said.
Brown did not comment on the quality of the
teaching in the department. "That's already been
dealt with in a way that I feel is adequate," she said,
referring to last spring's memo.
However, the students, Hernandez said, were not
ignored when they voiced their displeasure with the
programs. "We got a lot of feedback. A lot of people
thought we were upstarts, opinionated." She added
that one person in the department applauded their
efforts.
Most important, "the matter was discussed, and
we were told that the problems would not recur this
year," she said.
Current students in the master's degree programs
in print and broadcast journalism have generally
positive comments about the programs. "It's so
busy, it's hard to realize if there are any problems or
not," said Jane Galbraith, a student in print journal
ism.
Both print and broadcast students agree that the
programs have too theoretical a bias. "It's like being
taught how to be a good reporter or broadcaster out
of a book, instead of doing your thing out on the
field,"said broadcast student Themistocles
Themistocleous.
Several students, however, said they felt the facul
ty in broadcast were adequate. "The quality of the
teachers is just fine. I have no complaints,"
Galbraith said. "I'd say they lived up to what I'd
heard about Stanford," Themistocleous said.

master's students in both print and

ye programs. All but two of the stu
print journalism program signed the
they presented to Breitrose, Goheen

her master's in print journalism from
spring, and is now a reporter for the

culiar to our year which we felt pre
ni getting adequate instruction." Spe
print students thought their program
wctured — requiring certain courses,
itory of American journalism, and not

requiring others such as ethics, which she said the
students felt were more important.
According to Breitrose, the department has made
several changes this year in response to the com
plaints about the structure of the programs. "We
have made some adjustments in the curriculum of
the master's programs, and have shifted several
courses to other times of the year so that there is a
more even and more rational organization to the
programs."
There were also problems with the professors last
year, according to Hernandez. While refusing to
give names, she said that the program suffered from
having one teacher on leave, one very ill, one up for
tenure, one only a guest lecturer and one busy with
outside interests.
In regard to the department's faculty last year,
Breitrose said, "We needed a full-time person to
handle the broadcast news program. And this year
we got him."
Finally, Hernandez said the theoretical aspects of
journalism were well taught, but not enough atten
tion was paid to the practical aspects of the students'
writing. "I think my outside experience contributed
more to my writing than the program did," she said.
Six out of seven students in the master's degree
program in broadcast journalism signed the memo
which they presented to Breitrose, Fetter and
Goheen. Linda Brown, who received her master's in
broadcast journalism from the University last
spring, described the program as "lacking in many
respects."
She cited the lack of adequate broadcast equip
ment as the major problem."What we shot our mas
ter's projects with is not broadcast quality," she
said, calling the program's equipment "shoddy."
She said, "there's no excuse" for Stanford having in
ferior equipment.
Breitrose commented that "the technology of
journalism is something that we need to attend to."
He added that when the department moves into its
new quarters later this fall, the equipment in the new
facilities should solve many of these problems.
These new facilites, located in Building 120 in the
front of the Quad, have cost the department 512.5

million in construction. Breitrose gave initial equip
ment estimates as $250,000 to $300,000.
Another serious problem with the program, ac
cording to Brown, was the lack of coordination with

equipment in the Engineering Department. "Ev
