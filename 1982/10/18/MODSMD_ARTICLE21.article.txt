## Trojan ground 'machine' tramples Card 
### SID SPAETH 
; Southern California's punish
j ing ground attack trampled Stan
ford for 263 yards of ball control
• offense while quarterback Sean
I Salisbury threw for timely com
pletions as USC overcame a first
: quarter deficit to blast the
! Cardinal 41-21 here Saturday.
Heisman Trophy candidate
John Elway was pressured into
throwing three second-half in
terceptions — all shattering key
Stanford drives.
-C* USC pressured Elway with a
four-man rush enabling line
* backers and defensive backs to
drop into a blanket zone cov
erage.
"They did a good job down
field in their zones," Elway said.

"We couldn't get our receivers
upfield when I had time and
when they got open I didn't have
time."
The Trojan rush sacked Elway
six times. Three of those sacks
caught Elway for huge losses tak
ing them out of field goal range
twice in first quarter drives.
"The sacks hurt us," Elway
said. "They put us way behind
(the first down markers) and you
can't do that against 'SC because
they know you are going to pass.
When they know you are going to
have to pass and don't have to
worry about the run, it puts a lot
of pressure on the guys up front."
Stanford coach Paul Wiggin
agreed. "The sacks really took us
out of the game early," Wiggin

said. "We'd be sitting second
(down) and 26 (yards to go).
Even with a great offense that's a
long way to go."
Linebacker Keith Browner led
the sack barrage with dumps of
19 and 17 yards. He also pulled
down a key interception in the
second half as the Cardinal des
perately tried to catch the Tro
jans.
Stanford executed perfectly in
the opening drive and took a 7-0
lead on a 69-yard, six-play march
capped by Vincent White's one
yard plunge for the touchdown.
Stanford twice moved the ball
easily down field in the ensuing
possessions, but the Keith
Browner sacks backed the
Cardinal out of field goal range

twice. A third drive was thwarted
by a Jack Del Rio sack of 17
yards and USC came back with
an 82-yard drive to tie the game.
Stanford led 14-7 with 29 sec
onds remaining in the half when
Salisbury went to a play Arizona
State had used the week before to
victimize Stanford in the closing
seconds.
Split end Timmy Ware beat
Stanford's man-to-man coverage
with a post pattern over the
middle on first down for a 38-
vard gain taking the Trojans to
the Stanford nine.
Arizona State's Jerome
Weatherspoon had beaten a
Stanford zone on a similar pat
tern in ASU's winning drive the
week before.

USC easily scored on two
plays and took a 21-14 lead at
halftime.
"It was a disastrous drive from
our standpoint," Wiggin said.
"Not only giving them the lead,
but the nature of the way it hap
pened."
While the touchdown hurt the
Cardinal's spirit, Elway said they
were not yet broken.
Stanford started the second
half with a precision drive, but an
off-balance Elway pass to White
downfield was underthrown and
Tony Brewer intercepted at the
USC 11-yard line.
"There is no doubt that the
21-14 score at half was a little
frustrating," Elway said. "But I
ni o .


FEELING THE PRESSURE: Stanford quarterback John Elway goes down in
the clutches of USC linebacker Tim Sullivan. It was just one of the six sacks the

' Artie Streiber/Daily
Trojan defense recorded on Saturday afternoon in their 41-21 Pacific-10 victory
at Stanford Stadium. J
think the turning point was the
first interception 1 threw. We
were moving the ball and keeping
them off the field which is what
you have to do."
The Trojans then burst out to a
31-14 lead shortly into the third
quarter.
Stanford rebounded with a
touchdown drive, but linebacker
Riki Gray tipped Elway's first
pass of the next series and Joey
Browner intercepted.
USC quickly padded their lead
with Steve Jordan's second field
goal of the half.
Again on the next series,
Elway's first pass was intercepted
by a Browner — this time brother
Keith on a badly-underthrown
pass to Eric Mullins.
"They were just bad passes,"
Elway said. "On the first one
Mike (Tolliver) fell down and on
the other one the guy just stepped
in front of Eric (Mullins). It was
poor judgment on my part.
"You're not always going to be
able to throw five touchdowns a
game against a great defense,"
Elway continued. "I made some
mistakes, but I was going 110
miles per hour when I made
them. They were honest mistakes
— I was out there competing just
like everyone else. Without the
interceptions, it might have been
a different game, but I did the
best 1 could."
Wiggin attributed the mistakes
to the bleak game situation.
"We got into a pressure situ
ation and did some things that
brought about our demise," Wig
gin said. "You have to start
doing non-percentage things."
USC's running "machine" be
hind gargantuan linemen Don
Mosebar, Joe Murray, Tony
Slaton, Bruce Matthews and
Darryl Moore was the key factor
of the game, Wiggin and Elway
agreed.

"It's a machine," Wiggin said.
"I've said that before and I think
they (USC) believe that."
"Those guys maul you,"
Elway said. "They ripped us up
front. It's tough when they're all
270 pounds."
Tailbacks Todd Spencer and
Anthony Gibson combined for
219 yards rushing.
"The one dominant feature of
their team is their offensive line,"
Wiggin said. "I don't think their
tailbacks are Marcus Aliens.
They had a great day, but I think
that's an indication of the fire
works up front. I'm not saying I
could rush for 150 yards for
USC, but anyone with marginal
ability at the tailback position for
USC is going to pick up some
yardage."
