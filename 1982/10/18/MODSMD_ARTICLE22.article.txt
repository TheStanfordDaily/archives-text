## Big plays win games so 'SC won Saturday 
### 
Somewhere underneath the
bodies that pounded each oth
er Saturday at Stanford Stadi
um, a tired old cliche stuck its
ugly head out for all to see â€”

The Odes Factor

big plays win big games.
On this particular day,
Stanford lost to Southern Cal,
41-21 for that reason. USC
made the big plays.
What is a big play?
A big play is a 32-yard pass
completion to the opponent's
nine-yard line to set up a go
ahead touchdown with just 20
seconds remaining in the first
half.
A big play is a 38-yard pass
completion on third down
and 17 to get out of a hole and

keep a virtual knockout
punch drive alive, the cul
mination of which was anoth
er touchdown to complete a
string of 24 unanswered
points.
Big plays are a 19-yard
sack, a 17-yard sack and an
other 17-yard sack on three
consecutive opponents's
possessions, to stymie any

aspirations of completing a
scoring drive.
Big plays are three second
half interceptions against the
nation's best quarterback to
abort any attempts at a come
back.
Third down efficiency is a
good indicator of big play ex
ecution. The Trojans aver
aged nearly seven yards per
third down, converting seven
of 14 such situations.
Stanford meanwhile was a
meager two-for-nine, and av
eraged less than two yards per
third-down play.
USC came into Stanford
Stadium Saturday and they
not only performed the big
plav when they had to, the
Trojans prevented the
Cardinal from doing the
same. Stanford, for all its ex
plosive offensive potential,
failed to score more than one
touchdown in a quarter.
Containment was the basic
USC game plan on defense.
"When you flush John Elway
out of the pocket, he is ex
tremely dangerous," said Tro
jan coach John Robinson,
"Our key was to contain him
in the pocket."
"We couldn't let them get
the long things on us," said
Trojan safety Joey Browner.
"We decided we'd give them
the short stuff, the outs and
the curls, but take away the
streaks and the posts. Our ob
jective was to keep everything
in front of us."
Offensively, USC
sophomore quarterback Sean
Salisbury, while not flashy in
appearance, nevertheless
played "efficient" big-play
football. Salisbury completed
17-of-30 passes for 201 yards,
including seven-of-eight at
tempts on third down.
"I thought we had the best
quarterback today," said
Robinson. "Sean showed
poise. He made those key
third down throws to keep our
drives alive. When he grows
into that body of his, we're
going to raise ticket prices, be
cause he really is gonna be
something."
