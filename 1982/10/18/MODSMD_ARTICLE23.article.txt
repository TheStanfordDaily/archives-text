### ADAM BERNS 
Southern California Tro
jans Joey and Keith Browner
faced a difficult task on Satur
day — some would say nearly
impossible — shutting down
the nationN best quarterback,
John Elway.
If Saturday was a test for
the Browner brothers, both
free safety Joev Browner and
his younger brother outside
linebacker Keith Browner
passed with high marks.
Both Browners had key
fourth quarter interceptions
to hold Stanford to just seven
points in the final quarter.

Joev Browner, a 6-foot-3,
205 pound senior, came into
the game as an All-America
candidate and did nothing to
hurt his chances on Saturday.
USC secondary coach Nate
Shaw compared him with All-
Pro San Francisco 49er Ron
nie Lott.
"He's just getting better
and better and is playing like
an Ail-American," Shaw said
about Joey Browner. "Like
Ronnie Lott, Joey is the type
of player that you can't run or
pass awav from. He'll end up
where the ball is, no matter
where it goes."

Keith Browner is the
younger member of the
Browner interception squad.
A 6-6, 215 pound junior,
the vounger Browner has not
had as much notoriety as his
older brother, but his con
tribution in Saturday's game
was no less significant.
Besides making the intercep
tion that sealed the game,
Keith Browner was also effec
tive blitzing from his outside
linebacker position, sacking
Elway twice.
Elway, who was harrassed
all afternoon, had his worst
passing dav this year. Al

though he completed 27 of 41
passes for 239 vards and one
touchdown, the kev statistics
were the three second-half in
terceptions.
"We didn't get awav from
anything we've been doing all
season," Joev Browner ex
plains about stopping the
Cardinal's passing game. "We
just polished up on the things
we've done all year. Our front
did an excellent job putting
pressure on the quarterback.
"We gave them the outs
and curls but took away the
posts and long out," he
added. "We couldn't let them

get the long things."
USC shut off the big play
for Stanford. The Cardinal's
longest pass was 25 yards
from scrimmage and Stanford
consistently failed to come up
with the big plavs and the
third-down conversions.
"This was one of the biggest
challenges I've had this year
as far as pass coverage goes,"
the Trojan free safety ad
mitted after the game. "Elway
is the type of quarterback who
can burn you from any
where."
Stanford had the ball on its
on 34 yard line, with the Tro
jans ahead 31-21. On a first
and ten plav, Elway threw the
ball in a crowd and Joey
Browner picked it off. The
Trojans went on to score a
Held goal to build a 34-21
lead.
Keith locked the game up
following USC's field-goal
drive. After the Trojan kick
off, Elway fired the ball right
into the arms of the younger
Browner.
"1 was just dropping back
in pass coverage," Keith
Browner said. "I was follow
ing his (Elway's) eyes and
when I saw him throw, just
stepped in front to make the
interception."
Like his older brother,
Keith Browner viewed Satur
day's game as a unique
challenge and welcomed the
opportunity to play against
Elway.
"It was kind of a
challenge," Keith Browner
said about the game. "Stan
ford is the type of team that is
always going to score some
points. I really was worried af
ter the first drive (by Stan
ford). I knew when our de
fense settled, we'd be able to
play our type of game."
