# DeGuerre Pool continues magic for Cardinal poloists
## 
### CHRIS ADDINGTON 
There seems to be an aura
hanging over DeGuerre pool
lately. Somehow, victory is
always in the air for the Cardinal
water polo team. And victory
was once again in the air this
weekend for the defending
NCAA champions as they met
and defeated two nationally
ranked Southern California
teams in home-pool action.
The victories started Friday af
ternoon when the Long Beach
State 49ers made their ap
pearance at deGuerre. Long
Beach came into the game with a

7-6 record and a No. 10 national
ranking. The last time those two
teams met was in the NCAA
finals last Thanksgiving when the
Cardinal rolled to a 17-6 victory.
The Cardinal started the
match with goals by Jeff Stiling
and Curtis Hanst early in the first
quarter. With goals by James
Bergeson, Kirk Jensen and an
other bv Stiling, along with Long
Beach, the score stood at 5-2
when the half-time buzzer
sounded.
Stanford usually owns the
third quarter in any match, but
the49ers refused to be dominated
by this statistic. Long Beach
scored quickly early in the third
period, and after two tallies by
Stanford's Greg Lambert, scored
another to make it 7-4.
But a bizarre play put the
Cardinal in front bv four. As
Long Beach put the ball into play
at the center of the pool, the pass
fell short, and in the confusion,
Cardinal quick-thinker John
Tanner snatched it up and shot a
half-court lob shot over the head
of startled Long Beach goal
keeper lan Haskins.
This goal, along with others by
Jamie Velez, Lambert, and Tom
Lampert, broke the Long Beach
morale, and sent the final score to
11-6.
Stanford's failure ever to dom
inate the game seemed to cause
little concern with head coach
Dante Dettamanti. "We played
well enough to win," said Det
tamanti.
Dettamanti made a prediction
about Saturday's game against

the University of Southern Cali
fornia which certainly told the
storv of that game. "They are
going to be intense," Dettamanti
had remarked last week. And in
tense the Trojans were.
USC blazed to a 2-0 lead in the
first period making use of their
persistent driving offense. Stan
ford's Jensen threaded the needle
from way outside, and Lampert
scored on a man-up situation to
tie the score in the second period.
The two teams traded goals later
in the period to tie it once again at
three at the half.
For this game, much to SC's
demise, the Cardinal was back on
track for the third period. Stan
ford blanked the Trojans with a
pressure defense while Bergeson
and Tanner combined for three
goals.
Bergeson scored on one of his
famous look-away shots early in
the fourth period to give the
Cardinal a comfortable four-goal
lead and seal USC's fate. One
more goal by Lambert and two
by Southern Cal made the final
score 8-5 in Stanford's favor.
"I thought we played excellent
defense," said Dettamanti. "It
just took a while for our shots to
find the spot."
Dettamanti praised the play of
Bergeson and goalkeeper Steven
Mover. "Whenever we need a
goal it seems like Bergeson comes
through," he said.
In early morning action, Stan
ford's undefeated junior varsity
defeated JV powerhouse USC by
a score of 12-4. Stanford's JV
now sports an 8-0 record.

7-6 record and a No. 10 national
ranking. The last time those two
teams met was in the NCAA
finals last Thanksgiving when the
Cardinal rolled to a 17-6 victory.
The Cardinal started the
match with goals by Jeff Stiling
and Curtis Hanst early in the first
quarter. With goals by James
Bergeson, Kirk Jensen and an
other bv Stiling, along with Long
Beach, the score stood at 5-2
when the half-time buzzer
sounded.
Stanford usually owns the
third quarter in any match, but
the49ers refused to be dominated
by this statistic. Long Beach
scored quickly early in the third
period, and after two tallies by
Stanford's Greg Lambert, scored
another to make it 7-4.
But a bizarre play put the
Cardinal in front bv four. As
Long Beach put the ball into play
at the center of the pool, the pass
fell short, and in the confusion,
Cardinal quick-thinker John
Tanner snatched it up and shot a
half-court lob shot over the head
of startled Long Beach goal
keeper lan Haskins.
This goal, along with others by
Jamie Velez, Lambert, and Tom
Lampert, broke the Long Beach
morale, and sent the final score to
11-6.
Stanford's failure ever to dom
inate the game seemed to cause
little concern with head coach
Dante Dettamanti. "We played
well enough to win," said Det
tamanti.
Dettamanti made a prediction
about Saturday's game against

the University of Southern Cali
fornia which certainly told the
storv of that game. "They are
going to be intense," Dettamanti
had remarked last week. And in
tense the Trojans were.
USC blazed to a 2-0 lead in the
first period making use of their
persistent driving offense. Stan
ford's Jensen threaded the needle
from way outside, and Lampert
scored on a man-up situation to
tie the score in the second period.
The two teams traded goals later
in the period to tie it once again at
three at the half.
For this game, much to SC's
demise, the Cardinal was back on
track for the third period. Stan
ford blanked the Trojans with a
pressure defense while Bergeson
and Tanner combined for three
goals.
Bergeson scored on one of his
famous look-away shots early in
the fourth period to give the
Cardinal a comfortable four-goal
lead and seal USC's fate. One
more goal by Lambert and two
by Southern Cal made the final
score 8-5 in Stanford's favor.
"I thought we played excellent
defense," said Dettamanti. "It
just took a while for our shots to
find the spot."
Dettamanti praised the play of
Bergeson and goalkeeper Steven
Mover. "Whenever we need a
goal it seems like Bergeson comes
through," he said.
In early morning action, Stan
ford's undefeated junior varsity
defeated JV powerhouse USC by
a score of 12-4. Stanford's JV
now sports an 8-0 record.
