# Penalty kicks boost Stanford past UOP
## 
### JOHN KELLY 
Throughout the year, it has
been the offense of the Cardinal
soccer team which has carried its
victories.
Stanford Coach Nelson Lodge
has proclaimed the ability of his
forwards to strike well as the ad
vantage his team has over other
schools. Well, the Cardinal
strikers simply outscored a good
University of the Pacific team,
4-2, Saturday in Stockton, lifting
Stanford to 9-2-1 on the year.
Coupled with Santa Clara's 4-0
loss to playoff-ineligible USF,
and San Jose State's non-con
ference tie with UC-Santa
Barbara, the victory moves the
Cardinal into a prime position in
the Far West rankings.
Strikers Giancarlo Ferruzzi
and Todd Rafalovich had a goal
apiece in the win. Freshman
Rafalovich's tally came on a
through pass from Angel Vas
quez, which he slipped into the
corner of the goal. Sophomore
Ferruzzi ripped a thunderous
shot into the net from 20 yards
outside the goal, as the UOP
goalkeeper stood helplessly by.
The other two goals were scored
by sophomore midfielder Angel
Vazquez, both on 12-yard penal
ty kicks.
Sophomore goalkeeper Willie
Burkhardt had another fine day
in the nets.
The reason Stanford won was
"because we created more op
portunities," said. "We had more
chances to score, and we finished
well."
Stanford has proved their
strength in the midfield through
out the year and their ability to
control the tempo of the game
has led to their early success this
season.

Stanford plays Westmont to
day at I p.m. at Maloney Field.
The game could turn into a
grudge-game for the Cardinal,
who suffered an embarrassing
3-0 loss to Westmont in Santa/
Barbara last year.
But Stanford plans to be ready
for Westmont this year, and as
Vazquez said, "on our hofpe
field, everything falls into place/'
