# Brewers take lead
## 
### Associated Press 
Milwaukee â€” Robin Yount
capped a record second four-hit
game with a home run, leading
the Milwaukee Brewers to a 6-4
triumph over the St. Louis
Cardinals yesterday and a one
game edge in the 79th World
Series.
Responding to the cheers of
"MVP, MVP" from thecrowdof
56,562, Yount had a double and
two singles along with his s($lo
homer in the seventh inning. He
scored twice and figured in two of
Milwaukee's other runs.
Yount, who also had four hits
in Game I, is the first player in
Series history to have two four
hit games. He now has 11 hits and
six RBI in 21 at-bats in the Series.
The Brewers lead the best-of-sev
en championship three games to
two.
For winning pitcher Mike
Caldwell, the game was in stark
contrast to his three-hit, 10-0
masterpiece in Game 1. This
time, the Cardinals battled
Caldwell in each inning, banging
out 14 hits and finally chasing
him with one out in the top of tlie
ninth.
Bob McClure, who saved
Game 4, came in after Keith
Hernandez doubled in one ri)n
and scored on a single by George
Hendrick. McClure gave up a
single to Darrell Porter, but
struck out Willie McGee, the
hero of Game 3, and got pinch
hitter Gene Tenace to fly out to
left to preserve the victory.
That Series returns to Busch
Stadium in St. Louis tomorrow
night.
The last 30 times the Series has
been tied at two victories each,
the winner of Game 5 went on to
win the championship 23 times.
The Cardinals will try to beatthe
odds in Game 6 with rookie
right-hander John Stuper, Wfiile
Milwaukee will go with vetftan
Don Sutton.

Bob Forsch, who opposed
Caldwell in Game 1, started
again for St. Louis Sunday. Al
though less than perfect, he was
better than his first time around,
when he yielded 10 hits and four
earned runs in 5% innings.
This time, the Brevyers
scratched for their runs, scoring
one each in the first, third, fifth
and seventh innings as Forsch
scattered eight hits in seven~in
nings. Milwaukee added two
more runs in the eighth off the
Cardinals' ace reliever, Bruce
Sutter.
Twice during the third and
sixth innings, a very light rain fell
from overcast skies. The Milwau
kee offense copied the weather. It
never poured. It just sprinkled.
The Brewers, who have hafl at
least 10 hits in four of the five
games, had 11 Sunday, giving
them 53 for the Series.
