## Frustration: round 2 
### 
John Elway squinted his
eyes and slammed his fist into
the sod at Stanford Stadium.
He was biting the bullet.
Twice in a row and the mag
ic was gone. His high-pow
ered offense was stalled while
the other side was whirling by
on a spree.
Defenses want John Elway
and USC had him — figur
atively and literally, just as
Arizona State had had him
last week.

There is no one way to stop
the Stanford offense; there are
two, at least, for now.
"The last two weeks have
kind of been the same," Elway
said, frustrated. "USC has got
the athletes that ASU has, it's
just a different concept."
ASU sent a barrage of peo
ple at Elway, outnumbering
his blockers, sacking him four
times and stalling his potent
passing game.
USC sent four people, un
dernumbering his blockers,
sacking him six times and
stalling his potent passing
game.
"ASU tries to outnumber
you," Elway said. "USC uses
brute strength."
Noseguard George Achica
did not get a sack, but proba
bly caused them all. Stan
ford's uncovered guards had
to watch him instead of help
ing out on the outside pass
rush, leaving the blitzing line
backer and ends in a one-on
one situation with tackles and
backs.
"They did some things to
pressure us from the outside,"
coach Paul Wiggin said. "The
pressure up the middle kept
our guards in for a split sec
ond. John sets up deep. They
pushed their rush deep and
caught him a couple of times
when he tried to pivot out in
stead of stepping up (into the
pocket.)"
Stepping into the pocket is
what normal quarterbacks
do. Elway rarely does what
normal quarterbacks do so
USC figured they would let

him do his damage from the
pocket.
"I made a couple of mis
takes early by trying to get out
of the pocket the wrong way,"
Elway said. "When I got out,
they did a good job of staying
where they are supposed to
be. Usually, I can get people
to chase me out of position,
but they kind of moved as a
group."
USC did not use a defense
drawn up on a blackboard es
pecially for Elway like ASU
did. They used their defense.
"They stay with the same
pattern they used the last
three years," Elway said.
"USC just says 'Hey, you
gotta beat us at what we do all
the time,' " said flanker Mike
Tolliver.
Stanford has done that
rarely — not at all, recently —
and they are frustrated.
"I feel John was frustrated
a good part of the game,"
Wiggin said. "And John is as
poised a quarterback as
you're going to find."
Elway was dumped six
times, usually for big yardage,
killing drives. He threw three
second-half interceptions; at
least two were bad passes.
The first, a scrambling,
cross-field bomb to Vincent
White, looked like someone
else threw it — it hung, Tony
Brewer waited for it and
White couldn't fight his way
back to the ball.
Tolliver fell down on the
second and Keith Browner
stepped in front of Eric
Mullins on the third. Elway
called the passes "poor
judgment" on his part.
"It was a big game for us,"
Elway said. "And it's kind of
frustrating. I feel kind of . . .
empty."
Wiggin felt empty, too. The
sacks had hurt them, twice in
a row, and the interceptions
put the game away much too
early.
Elway's miracle was not
this week. He just dropped
back into the pocket — no
where to run, nowhere to hide
— and squinted his ©yes with
the frustration.

the sod at Stanford Stadium.
He was biting the bullet.
Twice in a row and the mag
ic was gone. His high-pow
ered offense was stalled while
the other side was whirling by
on a spree.
Defenses want John Elway
and USC had him — figur
atively and literally, just as
Arizona State had had him
last week.

The Sporting Muse

There is no one way to stop
the Stanford offense; there are
two, at least, for now.
"The last two weeks have
kind of been the same," Elway
said, frustrated. "USC has got
the athletes that ASU has, it's
just a different concept."
ASU sent a barrage of peo
ple at Elway, outnumbering
his blockers, sacking him four
times and stalling his potent
passing game.
USC sent four people, un
dernumbering his blockers,
sacking him six times and
stalling his potent passing
game.
"ASU tries to outnumber
you," Elway said. "USC uses
brute strength."
Noseguard George Achica
did not get a sack, but proba
bly caused them all. Stan
ford's uncovered guards had
to watch him instead of help
ing out on the outside pass
rush, leaving the blitzing line
backer and ends in a one-on
one situation with tackles and
backs.
"They did some things to
pressure us from the outside,"
coach Paul Wiggin said. "The
pressure up the middle kept
our guards in for a split sec
ond. John sets up deep. They
pushed their rush deep and
caught him a couple of times
when he tried to pivot out in
stead of stepping up (into the
pocket.)"
Stepping into the pocket is
what normal quarterbacks
do. Elway rarely does what
normal quarterbacks do so
USC figured they would let

him do his damage from the
pocket.
"I made a couple of mis
takes early by trying to get out
of the pocket the wrong way,"
Elway said. "When I got out,
they did a good job of staying
where they are supposed to
be. Usually, I can get people
to chase me out of position,
but they kind of moved as a
group."
USC did not use a defense
drawn up on a blackboard es
pecially for Elway like ASU
did. They used their defense.
"They stay with the same
pattern they used the last
three years," Elway said.
"USC just says 'Hey, you
gotta beat us at what we do all
the time,' " said flanker Mike
Tolliver.
Stanford has done that
rarely — not at all, recently —
and they are frustrated.
"I feel John was frustrated
a good part of the game,"
Wiggin said. "And John is as
poised a quarterback as
you're going to find."
Elway was dumped six
times, usually for big yardage,
killing drives. He threw three
second-half interceptions; at
least two were bad passes.
The first, a scrambling,
cross-field bomb to Vincent
White, looked like someone
else threw it — it hung, Tony
Brewer waited for it and
White couldn't fight his way
back to the ball.
Tolliver fell down on the
second and Keith Browner
stepped in front of Eric
Mullins on the third. Elway
called the passes "poor
judgment" on his part.
"It was a big game for us,"
Elway said. "And it's kind of
frustrating. I feel kind of . . .
empty."
Wiggin felt empty, too. The
sacks had hurt them, twice in
a row, and the interceptions
put the game away much too
early.
Elway's miracle was not
this week. He just dropped
back into the pocket — no
where to run, nowhere to hide
— and squinted his ©yes with
the frustration.
