### STEPHEN STRENG 
In front of a large, fired-up
Maples Pavilion crowd, the Stan
ford women's volleyball team
convincingly defeated the Uni
versity of Southern California,
3-1, in an important conference
match Saturday night.
The Cardinal pulled ahead 9-6
in the fourth game and appeared
headed for the win when South
ern Cal, led by freshmen sensa
tions Tracy Clark and Janice
Johnson, came back to tie the
game at 10-10. The two teams
then exchanged points and side
outsuntil USC wentahead 14-13.
Southern Cal faltered, how
ever, and committed two straight
errors to give the Cardinal a side
out and a 14-14 tie. The
Cardinal's own freshman sensa
tion, middle blocker Kim Oden,
then sent the Trojans reeling with
two kills to give Stanford the vic
tory, 16-14.
"Having a crowd really helped
us," said Stanford assistant
coach Don Shaw. "It's tough to
put good teams away. We're

learning that we're a good team
and they (the players) will have
more confidence in those situ
ations as time goes on."
In the first game, the Cardinal
came out flying. Stanford ex
ecuted well and its front row of
sophomore Diedra Dvorak, sen
ior J.J. Gearhart, and Oden
blocked superbly against the
taller Trojans. The Cardinal
jumped out to a 11-1 lead, at one
stretch scoring seven points in a
row without a USC side-out, and
took the victory 15-5.
In the beginning of the second
game, Stanford kept up their
amazing performance as the
Cardinal back row, especially
senior Kisi Haine and junior
Kari Rush, made incredible digs
to frustrate Southern Cal and
give the Card a 13-8 lead.
But Stanford couldn't keep the
Trojans down as they came back
to tie it up at 13-13. The Cardinal
seemed to come unglued after
their previously great play and
gave the game to USC, 15-13.
