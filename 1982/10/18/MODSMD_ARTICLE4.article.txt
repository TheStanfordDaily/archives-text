# Damages in Med Center blaze may total $20,000

Five emergency vehicles responded
to a blaze that gutted the inside of a re
search laboratory in the Sherman Fair
child wing of the Stanford Medical
Center yesterday. Damages have been
estimated at $20,000.
Flames engulfed laboratory supplies
in the room, while the accompanying
smoke filled the building's hallways.
The heat from the flames mixed with
the cold water of the emergency
sprinkler systems popped test tubes and
windows in the room, according to Don
Shaw, Palo Alto Fire Department bat
talion chief.
A small electric water heater started
the fire, according to Stanford Fire
Marshall Paul Andres, who conducted
the post-fire investigation.
"We know for sure that the only ob
ject in the room capable of starting the
fire was this (heating) element," Andres
said. "We're not sure, however, wheth
er the (heater's) thermostat failed or
whether it was an electrical component.
It's also possible that the heater was ac
cidentally turned up bevond 100
degrees Fahrenheit, but the lab workers
are adamant that this is not the case."
Jonathan Hardy, a lab assistant
working on the third floor of the build
ing, reported the fire.
"I was riding my bike to work when I
saw flames and a great deal of smoke
coming out of a first floor window,"
Hardy explained. "It had been burning
long enough for the flames to be quite
large. The only people in the building
were on the second floor, so nobody
knew anything was happening."
The Sherman Fairchild Building
houses laboratories in micro-, neuro-,
and structural biology, and is separate
from the hospital buildings housing the
patients.
Shaw estimated that the fire had been
burning for 45 minutes before Hardy

triggered the alarm. The automatic
sprinklers in laboratory did not go on
immediately because the fire was cen
tered on the floor near a window and
the the ceiling temperature must reach
135 degrees to melt the caps on the
sprinklers, according to Shaw. Once the
caps melted, the sprinklers extinguished
the fire in less than seven minutes.
Hence there was little for the two en
gine companies, two rescue units and
one paramedic squad to do once they
arrived, said Shaw. It is normal pro
cedure to send these vehicles on the first
alarm. "The sprinkler system in the
building pretty much had the fire con
tained by the time we got there," he
said.
No serious injuries resulted from the
fire. Stanford Security Supervisor
Pedro Guzman, however, did receive a
minor cut on his finger while aiming a
fire extinguisher through the window of
the lab moments before the firemen ar
rived.
No dangerous chemicals or radiation
were released in the fire, although
Romberg said some common lab
chemicals, including phosphoric acid,
were stored in metal containers nearby.
The room affected by the fire was
being used by Roger Kornberg, pro
fessor of structural biology, to conduct
DNA research. Kornberg estimated the
cost of replacing equipment burned in
the fire at $ 10,000. This consisted main
ly of small laboratory paraphernalia;
the most expensive piece was the water
dish holding the heater, which was val
ued at $200.
The building itself sustained the re
mainder of the damage, mostly caused
by flooding from the sprinkler system.
Shaw predicted that this would add up
to another $10,000.
Although the fire has left Kornberg
and his assistants with a difficult clean-
