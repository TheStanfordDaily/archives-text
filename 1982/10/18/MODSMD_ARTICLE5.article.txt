# Congress OKs additional monies for financial aid

### KAREN SPRINGEN 
Two recent federal measures should
prevent significant cuts in student fi
nancial aid funding despite Reagan ad
ministration attempts to eliminate
some or all aid to more than one-third
of the 5.5 million students now eligible
for loans and grants. However, federal
financial aid funds are still below their
1981 level.

the same regardless of federal funding,

aids. University policy states that it is
committed to meeting the financial
needs of all students.
The new legislation will directly af

fewer cuts mean that less money must
be taken out of general funds to pay for
financial aid. "The University won't
suffer as much," Huff said.

Congress and signed a technical bill af
fecting nearly 2 million students re
ceiving Graduate Student Loans and
Hell Grants. Designed to prevent reduc

for federal aid in the 1983-84 school
year, the bill will cost more than $6
billion.
In a surprise action during the first
week of October, Congress overruled a
presidential veto, ensuring the passage
of a supplemental appropriations bill
providing additional funds for 1982-83
social programs, Huff said. The bill
provides about $220 million more fi
nancial aid funding for students than
Reagan's budget proposal, he said. It
was an additional appropriation de
signed to provide supplemental funding
to continuing resolutions.
