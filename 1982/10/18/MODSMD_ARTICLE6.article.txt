# Four University schools set $65,000 ceiling
## Faculty salary hikes average 11.5 percent

Although faculty salaries are often
subject to the vagaries of the market
place, maximum wages for University
professors are not that high, according
to Gerald Leiberman, vice provost and
dean of graduate studies and research.
Professorial salary increases, unlike
contract-based United States Workers
salary increases, are based on merit,
equity and market considerations. Ev
ery fall each faculty member is eval
uated individually. Faculty salaries in
creased without dispute an average of
11.5 percent effective Sept. I.
Deans in the schools of Humanities
and Sciences, Engineering, Earth Sci
ences and Education have chosen to set
a 565,000 faculty salary ceiling, said
Rick Biedenwig, decision-analyst for
the Office of Management and Budget.
The Graduate School of Business
(GSB), the Law School and the Medical
School do not use the same ceiling, be
cause outside competition for faculty is
stronger in those schools. (When Law
School Dean Charles Meyers left Aug.
31, 1981, he warned the Faculty Senate
that the growing salary gap between ac
ademic lawyers and professional practi
tioners threatened legal education.)
Faculty salary increases here, unlike
at state schools, are "based on the
dean's perception" of the faculty mem
ber's performance, Biedenweg said.

Thus a dean can recommend a 22 per
cent raise for one professor — particu
larly if another school or a business
wishes to "rob" him — and a zero per
cent raise for another.
"The University encourages wide
spreads in salaries," Biedenweg said.
"The provost is very unhappy if a
school shows an 11.5 percent increase
across the board," he said.
Usually, salary distribution centers
around the median, resembling a bell
curve, according to Asst. Provost Noel
Kolak.
Individual salaries are never dis
closed. "We try very hard to protect the
privacy of the individual," Kolak said.
Salaries are competitive between full
professors in the School of Humanities
and Sciences and the School of Engi
neering, Biedenwig said. But salaries
arc higher for assistant professors in en
gineering than in humanities and sci
ence, because assistant engineering pro
fessors have "hotter" market value
than assistant humanities and sciences
professors, who are paid primarily on
the basis of years in rank, Biedenwig
said.
But despite the similarity in salaries
between schools, engineering and busi
ness school professors are more likely
than humanities professors to receive
outside income from consulting.
According to The Chronicle of Higher

Education (Jun. 16, 1982), a North
American Telephone Association re
port last year cited consulting fees paid
to economic professors James Rosse
(and a business associate) of $241,629;
to Nathan Rosenberg of $82,672; and
to Kenneth Arrow of $43,500 to cover

the expense of preparing a review of
studies useful to AT & T in its antitrust
case with the federal government.

policy allows professors to consult 13
