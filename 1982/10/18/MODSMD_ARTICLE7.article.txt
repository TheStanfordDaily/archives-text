## Polish Solidarity: unification hopes crushed? Parliament outlaws Solidarity 
### 
Compiled from news reports and wire ser
vices
Solidarity heaved its last legal
breath last week when an over
whelming majority of Poland's
parliament decreed the end of the
9 million member independent
union federation.
The vote outlawed the or
ganization that has for the last 16
months rocked the Soviet bloc
with its demands for increased
freedoms.
' In its place is a new trade union
law so restrictive as to make trade
unions non-existent. Among the
law's provisions: unions can only
be formed at the factory level and
are expected to be monitored
closely by the military regime;
striking is heavily restricted and
almost impossible; the govern
ment reserves the right to ban any
unions that "volate the constitu
tion of the Polish People's Re
public and other laws"; farmers'
unions like the banned Rural Sol
idarity are all outlawed,
outlawed.
Since he imposed martial law

last December, Gen. Wojciech
Jaruzelski has been trying to
quell the furor sparked by the ar
rests of Solidarity leader Lech
Walesa and 600 other leading
members and bring the labor
movement under control.
The grass-roots movement, in
an attempt to merge communism
and democracy, has repeatedly
demanded more internal de
mocracy and extensive economic
reforms. At first it seemed the
popular will would be able to ac
complish many of its goals, for in
the months that followed the
Communist Party became in
creasingly unable to control the
workers movement. Ultimately,
however, Jaruzelski seized mili
tary control as the party lost
almost all credibility.
At first the military leader tried
to enlist the support of Polish
workers. But his strategy failed
because Solidarity leaders and
members refused to be separated.
While Jaruzelski's advisers in
sist the new law is needed to es
tablish national renewal and ef

feet sought after reforms, they
admit that it will not be easy to
persuade workers. Unofficial
government reports predict that
fewer than 20 percent of Poland's
workers will opt to join the new
unions.
U.S. reaction to Jaruzelski's
latest move has been largely
negative. To show his displeasure
at Warsaw's military govern
ment, President Reagan ordered
steps taken to restrict further
U.S. trade with Poland.
Reagan called for the removal
of "most-favored-nations" trade
status with Poland. This means
higher tariffs on Polish imports
thus cutting profits for the al
ready economically-strapped
Poles.
But the United States is not the
only nation which has curbed ec
onomic relations with Poland.
Rather than boosting aid to its
floundering ally, the Soviet
Union actually has trimmed the
amount of goods and loans ex
tended Poland. Last year Poland
obtained more than $500 million

in Western currency loans from
Moscow as opposed to none re
ported this year.
Poland has been in a economic
slide for the past two years; 40
percent of its industrial capacity
is reported idle. The gross na
tional product is projected to fall
4 percent this year after falling 13
percent in 1981. And the cash
short military government re
portedly has scrapped $2 billion
in investment projects.
In the face of Jaruzelski's ac
tion, the Solidarity underground
is scrambling to regain a foothold
in national politics. During a se
cret meeting early last week in
Warsaw, the banned union's five
man coordinating commission
agreed to make an indirect ap
peal for a boycott of the new
union.
Though Jaruzelski has made
gains for the present , there is
speculation that the union so
seemingly crushed may require
the government to use force to
maintain its rule.

because Solidarity leaders and
members refused to be separated.
While Jaruzelski's advisers in
sist the new law is needed to es
tablish national renewal and ef

feet sought after reforms, they
admit that it will not be easy to
persuade workers. Unofficial
government reports predict that
fewer than 20 percent of Poland's
workers will opt to join the new
unions.
U.S. reaction to Jaruzelski's
latest move has been largely
negative. To show his displeasure
at Warsaw's military govern
ment, President Reagan ordered
steps taken to restrict further
U.S. trade with Poland.
Reagan called for the removal
of "most-favored-nations" trade
status with Poland. This means
higher tariffs on Polish imports
thus cutting profits for the al
ready economically-strapped
Poles.
But the United States is not the
only nation which has curbed ec
onomic relations with Poland.
Rather than boosting aid to its
floundering ally, the Soviet
Union actually has trimmed the
amount of goods and loans ex
tended Poland. Last year Poland
obtained more than $500 million

in Western currency loans from
Moscow as opposed to none re
ported this year.
Poland has been in a economic
slide for the past two years; 40
percent of its industrial capacity
is reported idle. The gross na
tional product is projected to fall
4 percent this year after falling 13
percent in 1981. And the cash
short military government re
portedly has scrapped $2 billion
in investment projects.
In the face of Jaruzelski's ac
tion, the Solidarity underground
is scrambling to regain a foothold
in national politics. During a se
cret meeting early last week in
Warsaw, the banned union's five
man coordinating commission
agreed to make an indirect ap
peal for a boycott of the new
union.
Though Jaruzelski has made
gains for the present , there is
speculation that the union so
seemingly crushed may require
the government to use force to
maintain its rule.
