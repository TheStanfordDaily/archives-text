# Demonstrations quelled with tear-gas
## Underground trade union urges strikes 
### 
Compiled from news reports and wire services
Fugitive labor leaders are urging Poles in Warsaw's
biggest plants to strike in sympathy with other workers
who risked police bullets and tear-gas to protest the new
law banning the Solidarity union.
The outlawing of Solidarity last week roused worker
anger, which was reported spreading to Poland's coal and
steel heartland. Riots claimed their first victim Thursday
— a young man who died of gunshot wounds — and po
lice fired tear gas to disperse mourners lighting candles
for the victim at a church in Krakow, Poland.
The official PAP news agency said Bodgan Wlosik died
in a hospital after being shot by a plainclothes policeman
during fierce street fighting in the Krakow steel-making
suburb of Nowa Huta.
At the memorial mass of the 20-year-old Wlosik, pro
testers attempted to return to a floral display, but the area
had been sealed off. Police, flailing truncheons, then
moved in with tear-gas and water cannons. The ensuing
clash between demonstrators and police scattered
flowers, candles and people, resulting in arrests of more
than 100 people.
Two hundred were detained after police broke up
mourners outside the St. Mary Queen of Poland Church,
and riot police patrolled the streets three nights running.

Unconfirmed reports attributed to a Polish ham radio
operator said two other people died in rioting at the Bal
tic seaport of Gdansk, the birthplace of Solidarity, and a
government journalist claimed a worker distraught by
the upheavals killed himself by diving into a vat of molten
steel at Katowice.
Violent protests over the martial law regime's efforts to
forever disband Solidarity exploded in Gdansk earlier,
followed by street demonstrations in Wroclaw, Nowa
Huta and a coal mine near Rybnik. The government re
ported 148 arrests in Gdansk, 170 in Wroclaw and 135 in
Nowa Huta.
The Communist Party newspaper warned that new
riots and strikes could extend martial law, and the official
information service Interpress said that leaflets urging
street protests and a boycott of pro-government unions
set up in place of Solidarity have appeared in factories in
Katowice.
Meanwhile, undaunted by new threats, the union
fugitive leaders continued to circulate leaflets urging
workers at major grants with more than 2000 workers in
Warsaw to strike in sympathy with those who struck at
the giant Lenin shipyard in Gdansk.
It was not clear how workers would rcact to the new
strike calls after the government crushed the Gdansk re
bellion, threatening to fire workers, jail them or draft

them into the army.
The leaflets had also called for absenteeism to honor
Wlosik's death in Nowa Huta. Reports workers
in Krakow and Warsaw would also stay home.
Miners at the Jankowice coal mine near Rybnik re
fused to work for one hour despite the martial law ban on
strikes, but had gone back to work after talks with man
agement and party officials, Interpress said.
Although leaflets circulated by underground Solidar
ity called for strikes and stoppages all over Poland, the
diversity of content within those messages indicated that
underground leaders lacked coordination and com
munications in capitalizing on the banning of Solidarity
and the set up of new, tightly-regulated unions.
Blaming the Solidarity underground for the strikes and
riots, the Communist Party daily Trybuna Ludu said that
such actions could "extend, contrary to the government's
intentions, the period of extraordinary measures."
Gen. Wojciech Jaruzelski, Poland's martial law chief
and Communist Party leader, said after Parliament out
lawed Solidarity that protests had slowed the govern
ment's plan to lift military rule by the end of this year but
had not "crossed it out."

flowers, candles and people, resulting in arrests of more
than 100 people.
Two hundred were detained after police broke up
mourners outside the St. Mary Queen of Poland Church,
and riot police patrolled the streets three nights running.

Unconfirmed reports attributed to a Polish ham radio
operator said two other people died in rioting at the Bal
tic seaport of Gdansk, the birthplace of Solidarity, and a
government journalist claimed a worker distraught by
the upheavals killed himself by diving into a vat of molten
steel at Katowice.
Violent protests over the martial law regime's efforts to
forever disband Solidarity exploded in Gdansk earlier,
followed by street demonstrations in Wroclaw, Nowa
Huta and a coal mine near Rybnik. The government re
ported 148 arrests in Gdansk, 170 in Wroclaw and 135 in
Nowa Huta.
The Communist Party newspaper warned that new
riots and strikes could extend martial law, and the official
information service Interpress said that leaflets urging
street protests and a boycott of pro-government unions
set up in place of Solidarity have appeared in factories in
Katowice.
Meanwhile, undaunted by new threats, the union
fugitive leaders continued to circulate leaflets urging
workers at major grants with more than 2000 workers in
Warsaw to strike in sympathy with those who struck at
the giant Lenin shipyard in Gdansk.
It was not clear how workers would rcact to the new
strike calls after the government crushed the Gdansk re
bellion, threatening to fire workers, jail them or draft

them into the army.
The leaflets had also called for absenteeism to honor
Wlosik's death in Nowa Huta. Reports workers
in Krakow and Warsaw would also stay home.
Miners at the Jankowice coal mine near Rybnik re
fused to work for one hour despite the martial law ban on
strikes, but had gone back to work after talks with man
agement and party officials, Interpress said.
Although leaflets circulated by underground Solidar
ity called for strikes and stoppages all over Poland, the
diversity of content within those messages indicated that
underground leaders lacked coordination and com
munications in capitalizing on the banning of Solidarity
and the set up of new, tightly-regulated unions.
Blaming the Solidarity underground for the strikes and
riots, the Communist Party daily Trybuna Ludu said that
such actions could "extend, contrary to the government's
intentions, the period of extraordinary measures."
Gen. Wojciech Jaruzelski, Poland's martial law chief
and Communist Party leader, said after Parliament out
lawed Solidarity that protests had slowed the govern
ment's plan to lift military rule by the end of this year but
had not "crossed it out."
