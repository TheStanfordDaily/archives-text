Palo Alto's Pebble Beach
A few yards from the new independent houses
stretches the Stanford golf course, judged by Golf
Magazine to be one of the top 100 courses in the na
tion. The annual cost of membership runs into the
thousands of dollars for most people. But all Stanford
students are members during their four years here
and, for only $3.50, can play eighteen of the most
beautiful holes in the nation and perhaps walk in the
footsteps of Stanford alumnus Tom Watson.
