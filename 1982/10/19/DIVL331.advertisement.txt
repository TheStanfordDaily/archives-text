AN APPEAL TO THE
PEOPLE OF PALO ALTO
AND STANFORD:
For the last 8 months, employees of Town & Country
Market have been walking a picket line. We'd like to go back
to work—but we can't unless we quit our union, give up our
health and pension plans and take a cut in pay. We don't
think that's fair, and we're writing to let you know why.
WHO FIRED US & WHY? Palo Alto T& C, Inc.
bought the market last fall. On February 6 employees were told the
store had been resold, we were all fired and, to be re-hired, we had
to be interviewed by the new owner John Meany. No advance
notice and no severance pay was given. The quality of our work
wasn't, mentioned.
WHO GOT HIRED? The ext day Meany told
employees that only non-union members could work.
Without a union contract, our health and pension plans
would be discontinued and waqes would be lowered.
DO WE HAVE A CONTRACT ? Yes Our ntract
is valid through February '83. It has a successor clause—a
common practice—which makes the contract binding on
any new owner. Meany refuses to recognize this contract,
and when picketed, our pictures were taken and our conversations
were tape-recorded.
WHY IS JOHN MEANY ANTI-UNION? That's
what we'd like to know. Especially since he and his wife are
former retail clerk union members. When she reaches age 65, she
can collect benefits from the same pension fund he's denying us.
WHAT HAVE WE DONE ABOUT THIS? We ap
pealed to the National Labor Relations Board. The NLRB
agreed and filed a complaint against Meany, to be heard in
November. But even if we win, the appeal process can
take years. And John Meany could eventually win just
because he can afford to wait—we can't.
WHAT CAN YOU DO? There e many ways you can
help, starting with refusing to shop there. Every major
grocery store nearby honors our union contract and many
have lower prices. For other ways, call our union office (408)
998-0428, or talk to the picketers.
America sent a clear message to the Polish
government that it's unfair to punish people for
belonging to a union. Help us get that message
to John Meany.
