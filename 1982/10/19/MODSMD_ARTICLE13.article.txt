## The 						Stanford Daily Solidarity lives on in Poland 
### 
Not surprisingly, the Polish Parliament's de
cision last week to ban formally Solidarity has been
met bv mass labor protests across the country. Not
surprisingly, that is, to those who have followed the
development of the Solidarity movement since its
inception.
Demonstrations against this latest crackdown by
the martial law regime of Gen. Wojciech Jaruzelski
were perhaps most impressive at the sight of the
August 1980 birthplace of Solidarity, the Lenin
Shipyard in Gdansk. Here workers risked im
prisonment to decorate the shipyard gates with
flowers, red and white Polish flags and portraits of
Pope John Paul 11.
Other protests followed in towns such as Nowa
Huta and Wroclaw as workers reacted with anger
to the so-called "reform" measures which outlawed
Solidarity and at the same time established
guidelines for the establishment of docile state-ori
ented unions.
The Polish government's attempt to pacify union
sentiments by encouraging the organization of
these puppet-unions has failed, however, as the
workers' contempt for what some called "Servility"
clearly shows: fewer than 100 workers have signed
up for a new trade union at the Huta Lenina steel
works outside Krakow, where more than 50,000

persons are employed. This noncompliance is par
ticularly remarkable in light of the fact that trade
unions are usually the only source of funeral and
birth grants, loans and many commodities in Sovi
et-bloc countries.
The perseverance of the Polish people in the face
of martial law is by any standard remarkable. De
spite the fact that participation in protest of any
sort in Poland is risky and sometimes life-threaten
ing, the demonstrations go on. Perhaps even more
remarkable is that these protests continue to be
planned and carried out even though the military
has "removed" virtually every identifiable labor
leader at key industrial sites nationwide.
Having enjoyed a brief vision of a democratic
future in Poland, the Polish people are simply not
going to allow that vision to slip below the horizon.
The events of the coming year may well surprise a
few seasoned observers.
The lesson for Americans is twofold: the Polish
struggle for liberty should make us all more aware
of the civil liberties we so often take for granted; at
the same time, we must seek to preserve these liber
ties as the Poles are attempting to do â€” as a people
that understands that freedom is a fleeting vision
with a high price but an even greater value.
