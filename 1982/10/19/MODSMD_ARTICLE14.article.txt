# Guest Prof. Board: try again?
## 
### 
"The ASSU Guest Professorship Board was es
tablished in the late '60s to bring lecturers to cam
pus with new perspectives on politics, science, the
arts and society at large. Though successful in past
years in bringing names like Angela Davis and
Daniel Ellsberg to Stanford, the board has never
had successes to match this spring."
That was the beginning of a Daily editorial of
spring 1981, recommending support for the Guest
Professorship Board in its quest for a fee
assessment. At that time, the board was riding a
crest of popularity â€” in one quarter, we had lob
byist Andre Burnett, environmentalist David
Brower and former presidential candidate John
Anderson teaching at Stanford in their respective
areas of practical expertise. In addition, a new
measure of respectability was afforded guest pro
fessors in that Anderson and Brower's courses were
accredited through specific University academic
departments, rather than through SWOPSI or Un
dergraduate Specials.
The board succeeded in the fee assessment elec
tion, gaining more support than any other fee
assessment applicant. With that affirmation, it
should have been safe to assume a continued re
surgence of the board, with more practical ex
perience and illuminating anecdotes coaxed from
the minds of respected professionals and laid at the
feet of Stanford students.
But that hasn't been the case. In fact, the Guest
Professorship Board is currently in a good deal of

trouble. It is operating without a permanent direc
tor, and has been since last spring. In 1981-82, the
year after its overwhelmingly successful fee
assessment campaign, the board managed to lure
only two guest speakers to Stanford: Bill Griffith,
creator of cult comic hero Zippy the Pinhead, for
two days in spring, and Catherine MacKinnon, a
noted feminist who came all the way from her office
at the Law School to teach a spring undergraduate
course. The board didn't even attempt to obtain a
fee assessment in last year's election, and for good
reason. This year, had it not been for the inex
perience of the new board, Rep. Pete McCloskey
(R-Menlo Park) might have been teaching a course
this quarter. Instead, he's a possibility for winter.
Or spring. Maybe.
There's no point to assigning any blame for this
sorry situation to anyone. But it is a shame when
Emory University has Jimmy Carter teaching a
course, and Princeton has Alexander Haig, while so
many public figures associated with Stanford sit
idly by their typewriters. It's even worse when the
ASSU, the organization overseeing the Guest Pro
fessorship Board, spends so much more of its time
and effort deliberating over a "concert network" to
raise money while one of its most visible sources of
prestige and use of revenue is wasted. It isn't that
we're setting high standards for the Guest Pro
fessorship Board; it's that those standards have
been reached before, and are worth achieving
again.
