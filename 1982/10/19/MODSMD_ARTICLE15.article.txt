## Humanities majors on the rise here 
### 
It's a good thing Robert Greer Cohn
is professor of French and not of
stastistics, else Stanford's fine reputa
tion in the mathematical sciences would
be stuck in the mud. Cohn alleges (Dai
ly, Oct. 13) "roughly an 80 percent drop
- in humanities majors ... in the last few
years." Comparing 1976-77 with
1981-82, the changes were: Asian lan

guages 4/6, classics 16/12, English
227/218, French and Italian 25/19,
German studies 20/14, humanities spe
cial programs 28/14, philosophy 33/ 50,
religious studies 16/10 (but in 1982-83,
30), Slavic langugaes and literature 3/4
and Spanish and Portuguese 21/26 —
totals of 393 /403 (thanks mainly to phi
losophy), an increase of 2.54 percent.

To be sure, the fine arts dropped: art
91/58, drama 14/11, music 87/40, a to
tal decrease of 47.4 percent, but the
quest for studio and performance work
in art and music tends to skew these fig
ures.
