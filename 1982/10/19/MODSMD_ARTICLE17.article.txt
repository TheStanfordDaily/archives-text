## Anti-Semitism grows in Italy 
### 
On Saturday, October 9, five unidentified terrorists fired
30 rounds from 9-mm submachine guns and hurled four
fragmentation grenades into a cfowd of 300 Jewish wor
shipers departing from a bar mitzvah ceremony at the Rome
Synagogue. Stefano Tache, a two-year-old, was struck and
killed by shrapnel. Thirty-six other worshipers were
wounded in the attack. Italian police have commenced a
search for the five commandos of Mideastem origin and sus
pect that a Palestinian terrorist group is behind the attack.
Strangely, the Israeli Foreign Ministry, which has routine

tacks in the past, refrained from accusing any group of con
ducting the assault. Leaders of the Jewish community in Ita
ly vented their anger at the Italian press for its allegedly anti-
Israeli bias in its coverage of the war in Lebanon and at the
Italian government and the pope for warmly welcoming
PLO leader Yasir Arafat to Rome in September. In very
blunt tones, Israel's Chief Rabbi Shlomo Gofen has ex
pressed his personal opinion that the synagogue attack
"began when the pope received the leader of the murderers
known as the PLO with almost regal honor."
In order to put these accusations into perspective, we
should take note of the recent anti-Jewish undertones in Ital
ian society. After Christian militiamen massacred civilians
in the Beirut refugee camps three weeks ago, Italian labor
unions refused to service flights of El Al, the Israeli national
airline, and port workers boycotted Israeli ships for a week.
The Communist-controlled Modena City Council cancelled
a film festival featuring the work of American Jews, notably
Woody Allen. A bomb was thrown into the Milan
synagogue on September 29.
For his part, the pope has deplored the continuing "crimi
nal acts of anti-Semitic hatred," in Europe and expressed his
"deep pain and consternation," following the synagogue at
tack. Prime Minister Giovanni Spadolini similarly declared
that the "disease of anti-Semitism must be removed from
our country." No one questions the sincerity of these re
marks, but doubts linger concerning the wisdom of having
Arafat at the Vatican and at a session of the Italian par
liament, where he received a standing ovation. Immediately
after his meeting with Arafat, Pope John Paul II told a crowd
in St. Peter's Square that he wanted to help in every effort to

bring peace to the Mideast and stressed that the Vatican
looked with sympathy on the traditions of both the Israelis
and the Palestinians. John Paul obviously wanted to bolster
Arafat in his role as a national leader, not in his terrorist in
carnation. But did the pope act prematurely? At what point
does an avowed terrorist become a respectable national lead
er?
Israel's Prime Minister Menachem Begin, it is said, lives as
an example of an individual who has accomplished the
metamorphosis from gunfighter to political fighter. Before
the creation of the State of Israel in 1948, Begin's small band
of Irgun fighters carried out attacks against British per
sonnel in Palestine and plotted the devastating bombing of
British headquarters at the King David Hotel in Jerusalem.
At the time, prominent Israelis fumed at Begin's terrorist
tactics (although the Irgun never targeted civilians in its op
erations). Begin gained political respectability after three
decades as leader of the parliamentary opposition in the Is
raeli government. _
By contrast, Arafat has not renounced methods of terror
— though the PLO officially condemned the Italian
synagogue attack — nor has the PLO renounced its goal to
destroy the State of Israel. The PLO's decision not to spon
sor terrorist attacks as of late is encouraging, but political
respectability cannot simply be accorded to those terrorists
who momentarily refrain from acts of terrorism. In their de
sire to encourage decent behavior on the part of the PLO, the
pope and the Italian government confused the real PLO with
the peaceful organization they hope it will become. As a

actions. In the case of the PLO, he miscalculated by symbol

We read of terrorist attacks and murders in our news
papers every day, yet the death of Tache struck a bitterly
ironic note in my heart. He was killed on Shemini Atzereth,
the Jewish holiday on which children are taken to synagogue
for a special blessing.
