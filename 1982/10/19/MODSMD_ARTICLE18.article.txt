## Jewish goals respect importance of human rights 
### 
Chitra Subramaniam's interview of
Israel Shahak {Daily, Oct. 13) left me
quite distressed. Shahak's remark, "I
have heard people say that Jews sup
port human rights, and of course they
are wrong," stunned me — not into si
lence, gladly; but into action.
Shahak, I am a Jew, and I support
human rights throughout the world. In
fact, I have begun to focus my major in
political science on the subject of hu
man rights in international relations. In
the past, Jews have taken a strong
stance to bolster human rights. Ameri
can Jews played a leading role in the
Civil Rights Movement in the 19605. Is
rael was one of the first nations to wel
come the homeless Vietnamese "boat
people," and many Jews in congrega
tions throughout the United States
have adopted refugees from Vietnam.
More recently, Jews in Israel have ex
pressed horror and outrage at the
Phalangist massacre of Palestinian ci
vilians in Beirut and have called for a
full-scale investigation of the role
played by the Israeli army during the
tragedy.
Beyond my concern for the prejudice
underlying Shahak's sweeping general
ization, I have two serious concerns
about the interview: I contest Shahak's
one-sided attack of Israel's ideology,
motives and goals; and I question the
role the Daily played in providing an
unchallenged forum for the expression
of such biased views.
Shahak claims the motive "well

known in Israel" for the war in Leba
non was "to destroy the Palestinians as
a political entity by destroying the PLO
in Lebanon." Actually, it was not
Palestinian politics which Israel wanted
to destroy, but Palestinian terrorism.
Israel's motive was to protect its civil
ians from repeated terrorist attacks by
destroying the PLO as a military threat.
Here, I must distinguish — as does Is-

rael — between the PLO and the
Palestinian people. The PLO is a ter
rorist organization sworn in its found
ing charter to the destruction of Israel.
The PLO has proudly claimed responsi
bility for numerous attacks aimed ex
clusively at the civilian population in Is
rael. I recognize the rights of the Palesti
nian people to self-determination. In
fact, I favor the eventual formation of a
Palestinian State on the West Bank — it
and only if Israeli security can be guar

anteed. However, I cannot tolerate the
actions of the PLO. Israel should nego
tiate with the PLO only if it abandons
its commitment to the destruction of Is
rael and disavows the use of terror.
Shahak's view of Israel's ultimate
goals is nothing less than absurd. "Is
rael wants to dominate the Middle
East," he says,"and from the Middle
East it wants to have predominant

strategic interests in the area all the way
to Pakistan, Morocco, and Kenya." If
Israel has such goals in mind, why did it
return the Sinai Desert to Egypt? Per
haps Shahak would contend that Israel
wanted to keep Egypt neutral in the war
in Lebanon. My response: certainly! Is
rael desires peace on its border with
Egypt and with the people of Egypt.
What can be wrong with such peace? Is
rael has desired to live in peace since its
creation. Since then, Isarel has been

subjected to aggression in 1948, 1967
and 1973 and to repeated terrorist at
tacks since the PLO began operating in
Lebanon.
i feel especially compelled to
challenge Shahak's biased attack on Is
rael because of the way the Daily pre
sented his opinions. By devoting almost
an entire half page to what it labelled an
"interview," the Daily committed a
grave disservice to its readers. The "in
terview" was actually an opportunity
for Shahak to express his opinions
without challenge. The interviewer,
Subramaniam, made no attempt to
question Shahak's views and assump
tions — a technique crucial to journal
istic standards. In an interview, a jour
nalist's duty is to probe and thereby
provide both sides of an issue. Sub
ramaniam asked only simple questions
of Shahak and allowed for long-winded
answers without interjection. Sub
raniam's interview belonged on the
opinions page, where it would have
been accurately labelled as an opinion.
Throughout the war in Lebanon,
while not blindly supporting Israel's ac
tions, I have been concerned that prop
agandists have used the war to conduct
a veiled attack on the Jewish people
aimed at the ultimate destruction of Is
rael. Currently, criticism of Israel is in
vogue in the news media. I hope the
Daily has not and will not fall prey to
the work of propagandists.

"interview," the Daily committed a
grave disservice to its readers. The "in
terview" was actually an opportunity
for Shahak to express his opinions
without challenge. The interviewer,
Subramaniam, made no attempt to
question Shahak's views and assump
tions — a technique crucial to journal
istic standards. In an interview, a jour
nalist's duty is to probe and thereby
provide both sides of an issue. Sub
ramaniam asked only simple questions
of Shahak and allowed for long-winded
answers without interjection. Sub

opinions page, where it would have
been accurately labelled as an opinion.
Throughout the war in Lebanon,
while not blindly supporting Israel's ac
tions, I have been concerned that prop
agandists have used the war to conduct
a veiled attack on the Jewish people
aimed at the ultimate destruction of Is
rael. Currently, criticism of Israel is in
vogue in the news media. I hope the
Daily has not and will not fall prey to
the work of propagandists.

Chitra Subramaniam's interview of
Israel Shahak {Daily, Oct. 13) left me
quite distressed. Shahak's remark, "I
have heard people say that Jews sup
port human rights, and of course they
are wrong," stunned me — not into si
lence, gladly; but into action.
Shahak, I am a Jew, and I support
human rights throughout the world. In
fact, I have begun to focus my major in
political science on the subject of hu
man rights in international relations. In
the past, Jews have taken a strong
stance to bolster human rights. Ameri
can Jews played a leading role in the
Civil Rights Movement in the 19605. Is
rael was one of the first nations to wel
come the homeless Vietnamese "boat
people," and many Jews in congrega
tions throughout the United States
have adopted refugees from Vietnam.
More recently, Jews in Israel have ex
pressed horror and outrage at the
Phalangist massacre of Palestinian ci
vilians in Beirut and have called for a
full-scale investigation of the role
played by the Israeli army during the
tragedy.
Beyond my concern for the prejudice
underlying Shahak's sweeping general
ization, I have two serious concerns
about the interview: I contest Shahak's
one-sided attack of Israel's ideology,
motives and goals; and I question the
role the Daily played in providing an
unchallenged forum for the expression
of such biased views.
Shahak claims the motive "well

known in Israel" for the war in Leba
non was "to destroy the Palestinians as
a political entity by destroying the PLO
in Lebanon." Actually, it was not
Palestinian politics which Israel wanted
to destroy, but Palestinian terrorism.
Israel's motive was to protect its civil
ians from repeated terrorist attacks by
destroying the PLO as a military threat.
Here, I must distinguish — as does Is-

rael — between the PLO and the
Palestinian people. The PLO is a ter
rorist organization sworn in its found
ing charter to the destruction of Israel.
The PLO has proudly claimed responsi
bility for numerous attacks aimed ex
clusively at the civilian population in Is
rael. I recognize the rights of the Palesti
nian people to self-determination. In
fact, I favor the eventual formation of a
Palestinian State on the West Bank — it
and only if Israeli security can be guar

anteed. However, I cannot tolerate the
actions of the PLO. Israel should nego
tiate with the PLO only if it abandons
its commitment to the destruction of Is
rael and disavows the use of terror.
Shahak's view of Israel's ultimate
goals is nothing less than absurd. "Is
rael wants to dominate the Middle
East," he says,"and from the Middle
East it wants to have predominant

strategic interests in the area all the way
to Pakistan, Morocco, and Kenya." If
Israel has such goals in mind, why did it
return the Sinai Desert to Egypt? Per
haps Shahak would contend that Israel
wanted to keep Egypt neutral in the war
in Lebanon. My response: certainly! Is
rael desires peace on its border with
Egypt and with the people of Egypt.
What can be wrong with such peace? Is
rael has desired to live in peace since its
creation. Since then, Isarel has been

subjected to aggression in 1948, 1967
and 1973 and to repeated terrorist at
tacks since the PLO began operating in
Lebanon.
i feel especially compelled to
challenge Shahak's biased attack on Is
rael because of the way the Daily pre
sented his opinions. By devoting almost
an entire half page to what it labelled an
"interview," the Daily committed a
grave disservice to its readers. The "in
