# Public Affairs VP resigns, takes AAU post
## 
### MIKE HALE Senior staff writer 
Robert Rosenzweig, vice president
for public affairs, will be leaving the
University in early 1983 to become pres
ident of the Association of American
Universities (AAU).
His selection was announced yester
day in St. Louis at the fall meeting of the
AAU, a Washington, D.C.-based lob
bying association.
Rosenzweig, reached yesterday in St.
Louis, said he had been offered the
position several weeks ago and had ac
cepted after lengthy discussions with
the AAU.
University President Donald Ken
nedy, a member of the AAU search
committee that made the selection, said
Rosenzweig received strong support
both from within the AAU and from
congressional staff members who have
worked with him in Washington.
Among the other members of the
search committee were Harvard Uni
versity President Derek Bok, Univer
sity of California President David Sax
on, University of Michigan President
Harold Shapiro and Indiana University
President John Ryan, who serves as
chairman of the AAU.
The AAU's members are 52 major re
search universities which do "most of
the advanced research in this country,"
according to Rosenzweig. Larry

Horton, University director of gov
ernmental relations, called the AAU
{"the pre-eminent organization repre
senting institutions like Stanford in
Washington."
Horton said the AAU serves as an
advocate for its member institutions on
'all issues that affect major universities,
and attempts to articulate nationally
the "needs of higher education." He
called Rosenzweig's appointment a
"marvellous opportunity for univer
sities in general, but a terrible loss for
Stanford."
Horton cited Rosenzweig's under
standing of universities and their in
teractions with government, and his
articulation as a spokesman as qualities
he will take to his new position. He said
perhaps most important was Rosen
zweig's "tough-mindedness" because
"higher education would suffer with
someone weak in that post."
Rosenzweig came to Stanford 20
years ago as associate dean of the grad
uate division and lecturer in political
science. He was named vice-provost in
1971 and assumed his present position
in 1974. He was the University's first
vice president for public affairs.
As head of the Public Affairs Office,
Rosenzweig oversees the University's
relations with the community, the gov
ernment and other universities. Ken
nedy said yesterday, "It's quite general

ly recognized he put together the best
governmental relations operation any
where." He said that while Rosenzweig
would be "terribly difficult" to replace,
he had "put together a good operation
and will leave some good people behind
him."
Asked how he felt about leaving
Stanford, Rosenzweig's first response
was "Well, I've been here 20 years." He
said while he regretted leaving, he was
proud to have been involved in a period
of substantial progress for the Univer
sity.
"I like the students, the faculty and
my colleagues in the administration,"
he said. "But there's another challenge
here."
He downplayed his own role in the
Public Affairs Office, saying "its
strength didn't depend on my presence;
whoever comes in will inherit a strong
organization and do a good job."
Rosenzweig has been one of the Uni
versity's more outspoken officials. This
summer he sharply criticized legislation
that would link financial aid to draft
registration, and he has suggested that
California's public colleges and univer
sities must adopt realistic tuition levels
to maintain their quality.
One of Rosenzweig's principal con
cerns has been university-industry rela
tions. He Co-authored an AAU study
titled "Research Universities and Their

Patrons," published earlier this year.
He was also instrumental in organizing
the Pajaro Dunes conference of educa
tional and business leaders last spring.
Rosenzweig will probably remain in
his University post until Feb. 1. Ken
nedy will select a search committee to
find Rosenzweig's successor.

Robert Rosenzweig
Robert Rosenzweig, vice president
for public affairs, will be leaving the
University in early 1983 to become pres
ident of the Association of American
Universities (AAU).
His selection was announced yester
day in St. Louis at the fall meeting of the
AAU, a Washington, D.C.-based lob
bying association.
Rosenzweig, reached yesterday in St.
Louis, said he had been offered the
position several weeks ago and had ac
cepted after lengthy discussions with
the AAU.
University President Donald Ken
nedy, a member of the AAU search
committee that made the selection, said
Rosenzweig received strong support
both from within the AAU and from
congressional staff members who have
worked with him in Washington.
Among the other members of the
search committee were Harvard Uni
versity President Derek Bok, Univer
sity of California President David Sax
on, University of Michigan President
Harold Shapiro and Indiana University
President John Ryan, who serves as
chairman of the AAU.
The AAU's members are 52 major re
search universities which do "most of
the advanced research in this country,"
according to Rosenzweig. Larry

Horton, University director of gov
ernmental relations, called the AAU
{"the pre-eminent organization repre
senting institutions like Stanford in
Washington."
Horton said the AAU serves as an
advocate for its member institutions on
'all issues that affect major universities,
and attempts to articulate nationally
the "needs of higher education." He
called Rosenzweig's appointment a
"marvellous opportunity for univer
sities in general, but a terrible loss for
Stanford."
Horton cited Rosenzweig's under
standing of universities and their in
teractions with government, and his
articulation as a spokesman as qualities
he will take to his new position. He said
perhaps most important was Rosen
zweig's "tough-mindedness" because
"higher education would suffer with
someone weak in that post."
Rosenzweig came to Stanford 20
years ago as associate dean of the grad
uate division and lecturer in political
science. He was named vice-provost in
1971 and assumed his present position
in 1974. He was the University's first
vice president for public affairs.
As head of the Public Affairs Office,
Rosenzweig oversees the University's
relations with the community, the gov
ernment and other universities. Ken
nedy said yesterday, "It's quite general

ly recognized he put together the best
governmental relations operation any
where." He said that while Rosenzweig
would be "terribly difficult" to replace,
he had "put together a good operation
and will leave some good people behind
him."
Asked how he felt about leaving
Stanford, Rosenzweig's first response
was "Well, I've been here 20 years." He
said while he regretted leaving, he was
proud to have been involved in a period
of substantial progress for the Univer
sity.
"I like the students, the faculty and
my colleagues in the administration,"
he said. "But there's another challenge
here."
He downplayed his own role in the
Public Affairs Office, saying "its
strength didn't depend on my presence;
whoever comes in will inherit a strong
organization and do a good job."
Rosenzweig has been one of the Uni
versity's more outspoken officials. This
summer he sharply criticized legislation
that would link financial aid to draft
registration, and he has suggested that
California's public colleges and univer
sities must adopt realistic tuition levels
to maintain their quality.
One of Rosenzweig's principal con
cerns has been university-industry rela
tions. He Co-authored an AAU study
titled "Research Universities and Their

Patrons," published earlier this year.
He was also instrumental in organizing
the Pajaro Dunes conference of educa
tional and business leaders last spring.
Rosenzweig will probably remain in
his University post until Feb. 1. Ken
nedy will select a search committee to
find Rosenzweig's successor.
