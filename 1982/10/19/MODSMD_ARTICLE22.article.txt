## Virtuoso Davidovich delights Mem Aud crowd 
### MARC VINCENTI 
At last Friday's concert in Memorial
Auditorium by classical pianist Bella
Davidovich, I was reminded of some re
marks made by pianist John Browning
in a recent interview. "A pianist should
loosen up a lot of classical music and
tighten up a good deal of romantic mu
sic," said Browning. "So many artists
feel that Mozart has to be played rigidly
while Chopin can be performed as
loosely as one wants. I think the exact
opposite is true. A slow movement in
Mozart should be played freely and ex
pressively, whereas the rubatos in
Chopin should be tightened."
Clearly, Browning and Davidovich
do not think alike on this subject. Her
playing, which began with music bv
Mozart's contemporary Franz Joseph
Havdn, and ended with Chopin,
showed a striking division between clas
sical "tightness" and romantic "loose
ness." However, in between these two
extremes Davidovich placed a suite
from Prokofiev's "Romeo and Juliet,"
which rested upon a musically-satis
fying middle ground.
Davidovich is a poised and graceful
performer. She appeared in a flowing,
floor-length dress. Sitting at the piano,
she lightly dusted the keyboard with
one hand, momentarily massaged her
fingers and began to play. Her wrists
are supple, her left hand full of bounce,
and there is that slight upraising of the
elbows and inclining of the upper body
when she plays "con amore." On a
final, fortissimo chord her head rears
back regally, and between pieces she
softly brushes back her copper-red hair.
Bowing, she smiles and places her hand
over her heart.
In order to describe Davidovich's
playing of Chopin, I would like to take
a closer look at this question of "tight
ness" vs. "looseness," of strictness vs.
rubato. Rubato — "rhythmic flexibility
within a phrase or measure" — maybe
deemed overdone when it reaches the
point that the listener can no longer
grasp the fundamental regularity of
tempo that underlies the rubato. Now,
when a pianist practices a melody re
peatedly, particularly a melody by
Chopin, the fundamental regularity of
the tempo can begin to seem so familiar,
so trite and obvious, that the pianist
banishes it forever to the storehouse of
his memory. That regular tempo is nev
er heard aloud again, and it remains
merely a private reference point, a silent
springboard from which the pianist re
peatedly leaps, devising (as he plays)
ever more complicated rhythmic lulls,
bursts, full-twists and half-gainers.
Eventually, he is soaked to the gills in
rubato.
But the innocent bystander — the
neglected listener — who has no such
private reference point, is awash in a sea
of uncertainty. He feels like someone
who has gone below-deck in a small
sailboat, in heavy seas. Unable to see
the approaching waves and thus antici
pate their effort, he must endure, un
prepared, all manner of rolling,
pitching and rocking. The result is
- queasiness — the same queasiness that
you get from too much rubato in your
Chopin.
So it was with Davidovich's playing
of Chopin's more songful melodies, es

peciallv in the Nocturne in E major, Op.
62 No. 2, and in the Mazurkas, Op. 30
No. I, and Op. 59 No. 2. However, let
me hasten to add that in other respects
Davidovich's Chopin was solid and
well-presented. Her technique, particu
larly in the Variations Brillantes, Op.
12, was satisfying, and her climaxes
were without bombast.
As evidenced bv the manv who stood
to applaud, there are those who are en
thralled by Chopin as Davidovich plays
it. And she answered them with two en
cores — waltzes by the same composer.
But the first one (Op. 70, No. 1) con
tained the same rhvthmic problem — in
a nutshell — in the cantabile tune of the

middle section. Here was a melody laid
before us so perfectly, with such ex
quisite hesitation, that the entranced
listener could almost tie it up in a rib
bon and carry it home.
Davidovich's approach to Haydn
was just the opposite. Her playing of the
sonatas No. 21 in F major and No. 7 in
D major was remarkable for strictness
of tempo. This lent undeniable energy
to the music, but also deprived it of
nuance in the places where brief bend
ings of the tempo, as well as greater
dynamic shadings, could have given
added meaning to Havdn's unpredic
table harmonic leaps and his droll sense
of timing. Even in the heartfelt, minor

key adagio of No. 21, the beat of the tri
plets was painstakingly exact; and
though the simple melody was played
with simplicity, candor, and directness,
the movement refused to sound merely
plain. It was genuinely tranquil and
pensive.
Davidovich sang Haydn's themes
clearly and boldly, tending toward the
robust rather than the delicate. The
temperament of her playing, rather
than mercurial, was well-crafted. The
"allegro con brio" theme of No. 7 was
bright and chirruppy, but the presto
finale was too assertively struck to be
deemed, as Haydn did, "innocen
temente." The largo interlude was grav
ely serious though, amazingly, still in
strict time. At its close, Davidovich al
lowed herself, for once, a slight
ritardando. Overall, Davidovich's firm
ness certainly kept her from lapsing into
the merely "cute," but it also ruled out
the playfulness that enliveps this won
derful composer's music.
The pianist's performance of six
selections from Prokofiev's "Romeo
and Juliet" suite proved to be her most

satisfying and well-conceived effort.
Perhaps Davidovich, Russian born and
trained, has an affinity for these pieces.
Her tempos were strict where they
needed to be (suitable for ballet dan
cers!), while at the right moments her
playing breathed freely. When Pro
kofiev transcribed these pieces for the
piano, he made built-in requirements
that a performer be both agile and ac
curate, with the ability to encompass
large intervals in both hands and to
bound across wide keyboard distances
in a twinkling. Davidovich was equal to
the task.
"Juliet, the Girl" got off to a scam
pering start. Her beguiling, curlicue
melody, in its second appearance, re
ceived a perky, leggiero treatment in
Davidovich's hands, nicely reminding
one that these meaures are, in the or
chestral version, given to the flute. In
"The Montagues and the Capulets,"
the pianist boomed out the swaggering,
arrogant bass in confident handfuls.
But at the climax of this number
Davidovich appeared to be drawing on
all her reserves of power, and this was

far too early in the program to be
divulging the limits of her strength. The
"tranquio" but darkly-colored middle
section of the piece came as a nice con
trast — a soft minuet that ably conjures
up the airiness of pointe dancing.
In "Romeo and Juliet Before Separa
tion" the opening flute melody, marked
"dolcissimo," was played with the
pedal depressed throughout. When this
gentle air reappears later in high oc
taves, over a quietly-rolled left hand,
Davidovich's feathery, skimming touch
was a delight to behold.
In these selections, I wished that
Davidovich could have shown a wider
and more graduated dynamic range, es
pecially at the softer end of the scale.
She could well cultivate that very
hushed "ppp" that makes you hold
your breath and sit absolutely still.
Davidovich's audience, though not
always suspended in this awkward con
dition, was, nevertheless, quite atten
tive to this accomplished and pleasing
pianist. Davidovotch appeared as part
of the Lively Arts' fall concert series.
