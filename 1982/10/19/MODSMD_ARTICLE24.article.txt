### TERRI SUTTON 
The good news is that PiL visits
San Francisco November 5.
What is "PiL?" Well, rest easy.
PiL is not a new breed of killer aspi
rin destined for November distribu
tion, nor is it an experimental gov
ernment agency concerned with
drug use.
Defining just what constitutes PiL
is a more difficult task. The ex
panded moniker, Public Image Ltd.,
does not unravel the mystery so
much as reveal a touch of the preten
tious. "Limited," indeed.
PiL is a band, sort of, although it
likes to be thought of as a corpo
ration. With the unveiling of the
concept in the late '70s, PiL was de
fined as an umbrella organization,
embracing such PiL-sponsored ac
tivities as film and video production,
soundtrack manufacturing, new ar
tist fabrication and the creation and
marketing of new sounds by the pa
rent group itself.
Marvelous. However, PiL has ac
complished rather less than initially
promised. The stunning output con
sists of three albums — two studio,
one live — an ill-fated tthft-. a few
videos and the sponsoring of one or
two British artists of whom no one
had ever heard outside of London —
and still hasn't.
Sounds like the average band to
me, except for one thing: PiL's lead
singer is none other than John
Lydon, a.k.a. Johnny Rotten, your
pal and mine from the late great Sex
Pistols. Lydon's presence explains
the pretentiousness (remember
"We're the last rock 'n' roll band
ever?"), as well as the low output.
After all, when has Lydon ever con
sciously acted to satisfy anyone's ex
pectations, let along his own stated

goals?
But it seems Lydon has torn
himself away from the New York so
cial scene — and an acting stint in
Cop Killers (probably a cameo role)
— to roll PiL out on the road.
A tour from a band which re
portedly despises touring, whose last

New York gig ended in bottle
throwing and name-calling between
band and audience, a band who's
African-chant/primal
scream/atonal music does not exact

ly adapt well to live performance —
why, one may ask, why a tour, trun
cated as it may be?
1, for one, do not have a clue. I
doubt Lvdon himself knows for
sure.
Be that as it may, the San Francis
co show should definitely be a
fascinating clash of expectations be
tween performers and audience. Al
ready one can predict the opposing
forces: Lydon's continued fight with
diehard Pistols fans; the hardcore
contingent's quarrel with the avant
garde; the audience's preconcep
tions versus the abrasive and un
reliable — character of Lydon,
guitarist Keith Levine and PiL mu
sic itself.
Accessible, no. Go prepared to be
irritated, stepped upon, cursed, al
ienated, deafened. But go. Whatever
Lvdon is, he has provocative charis
ma — which is rare in this world of
assembly-line Marshall Crenshaws
and John Cougars.
Public Image may not be a corpo
ration; indeed, they may not even
create "good" music, but they are an
extraordinary band which should be
seen perhaps once in a lifetime.
Tickets to Pi L can be purchased at
$ 10 a shot through mail order only.
RECORD NOTES: Both the
English Beat and the Psychadelic
Furs have followed up current sin
gles with new albums in the past
week or so. The Beat 1.p., entitled
Special Beat Service, contains the
great "Save it for Later" previewed
at the Clash shows this summer. Los
Angeles' Gun Club will also release
an album sometime this week.
Oh, and the bad news?
Watch out for a new album by
none other than Linda Ronstadt.
What? No Gilbert and Sullivan?
