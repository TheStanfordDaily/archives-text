# Melville—French New Wave roots revisited
## 
### STEVE VINEBERG 
Bob was a letter to a Paris
which no longer existed — the
Paris of before the wqr — and it
enshrines a nostalgia for the past.
Bob is a son of Paris.
— Jean-Pierre Melville
If you've seen Jean Luc God
ard's Breathless, you may recall
the scene in which Belmondo's
American girl friend Patricia
(played by Jean Seberg), in
terviewing a celebrity director,
asks him what his ambition is;
"To become immortal and then
to die," the director replies. Jean-
Pierre Melville, who performed
that witty cameo in 1959, died
nearly a decade ago, without ever
attaining the fame (at least out
side of France) of the New Wave
filmmakers — Godard, Francois
Truffaut and others — whom he
had inspired. Melville made a
dozen features between 1947 and
1970; the only one recognized in
America until last year, his ex
traordinary film of Cocteau's Les
Enfants Terribles (released in
1949), rarely shows up in revival,
and because it is so faithful in
spirit and style to the novel, most
people think Cocteau made it
himself. In 1981, for its extended
tribute to iittle-known French
movies, the Museum.of Modern
Art in New York unearthed
Melville's 1955 Bob le Flambeur
(Bob the Gambler), and it drew
such enthusiastic attention from
critics that, after all this time, an
American distributor finally
picked it up. And it's a wonderful
movie.

Although Melville claims Bob
is nostalgic for pre-war Paris, the
feeling of the movie, which opens
in "morning twilight" — the
hours just before dawn — is al
ready one of loss. The hero, Bob
Montagne (Roger Duchesne),
has served time in prison for rob
bery; he and his pal, the police in

spector (Guy Decomble, who lat
er appeared in Truffaut's The 400
Blows), are middle-aged men
whose hair has begun to silver.
The proprietress of the bar where
Bob and his crowd hang out,
Yvonne (Simone Paris), her face
lined with worry and softened
with her affection for Bob — per
haps once sexual, now maternal
— must have lived out a couple of
decades in Montmartre. Melville
has provided a pair of young lov
ers, but Anne (Isabelle Corey,
who was Fifteen when she made
this film) has already ac
cumulated too many lovers and
too many drunken nights — her
kittenish appeal will begin to
glaze over in a year or two — and
Paulo (Daniel Cauchy), the son
of Bob's old partner, shows every
inclination of claiming his
father's path for himself. The
Paris Melville reveals is not a
young man's Paris, but the Paris
to which F. Scott Fitzgerald's
hero returned in "Babylon Re
visited" after he had sobered up
and was trying to dig bits of his
past out of the clubs and hotels he
had rioted through years before.
When Louis Malle set out in the
early '60s to make his finest film,
The Fire Within, which also
harkens back to "Babylon Re
visited," he must have taken a
long look at Bob le Flambeur.
It would be a mistake, how
ever, to represent Bob as grimly
tragic. The Melville of this film is
very much the Melville who
would bewilder Patricia with that
quip about immortality four
years later in Breathless; his in
fluence on Godard and Truffaut
is evident not only in his econom
ical, independent method of as
sembling a film (and his use of
jump cuts) but also in his playful
recasting of the conventions of
American gangster pictures.
Bob, who wears a fedora tipped
over his left eye and a trenchcoat,
embodies an old-time style still so
pure and colorful that it excites
even the younger generation:
Anne wants to sleep with him and
Paulo wants to emulate him.

Style is the keynote of this movie.
Melville celebrates one's manner
of holding a cigarette — Bob's
hangs from the corner of his
mouth, the croupier Jean
(Claude Cerval), whom Bob ap
proaches to assist him in a come

back theft, employs his to com
municate his response to Bob's
proposition, and Anne points
hers stiffly, because she's trying
on a style. You feel that every
move these characters make is in
conscious imitation of the heroes

Bogart and Cagney played in the
'30s and '40s, so that when Paulo
confesses his love for Anne and
swears that he'll give her the
moon if she desires it, we seem to
hear him through an echo
chamber, and when he learns

she's slept with a local pimp
(Gerard Buhr), Paulo shoots him
down in a phone booth, in a re
play of dozens of grand exits in
Warner Brothers melodramas.
Though there isn't a dim light
in the cast (which also includes
Andre Garret as a fellow thief,
Roger, and Colette Fleury as
Jean's avaricious wife), it is fresh
faced Daniel Cauchy as Paulo
who keeps the film balanced be
tween wit and pathos, parody
and tragedy. Paulo takes wide
eyed delight in Bob's company
and in the charged Montmartre
underworld — he's a kid playing
grown-up with the wrong crowd
(hence Bob's fatherly interest in
him), and inevitably he goes too
far. He falls so utterly and un
reasonably in love with Anne
that he tells her Bob's plan to rob
the safe at Deauville on the day of
the Grand Prix, and Anne, a kid
herself, can't be trusted. In his
scenes with Isabelle Corey — one
in which he watches her undress
and another in which he promises
her the moon — Cauchy gives
Paulo an earnestness that is
almost frightening: he's so hyp
notized, so out of control, that
you know he's doomed.
Melville wrote the script for
Bob le Flambeur and designed it,
along with Claude Bouxin; the
art direction transforms the
black and white of Henri Decae's
cinematography into a motif —
white phosphorescent dots deco
rate the walls of a cafe, the floors
are covered with black-and
white- checked tile patterns. De
cae, a legendary photographic ar

tist, captures the slightly absurd
elegance of gentlemen gamblers
in tuxedos leaning against glitter
ing stair rails and the desolate
beauty of triple-clustered street
lamps and headlights shrouding
the early morning dark in weird
halos. Nothing has been omitted
from Melville's scheme; even the
score (bv Eddie Barclay and Jean
Boyer) glances back at American
jazz and show music — I thought

I detected a bar or two of Richard
Rodgers' "Slaughter on Tenth
Avenue" — through a dis
tinctively French glass. (The
haunting ballad Barbra Streisand
recorded in the '60s as "Once
Upon a Summertime" comes
from this movie.) No wonder the
New Wave directors so revered
Jean-Pierre Melville, who was so
magnificently aware of the con
nection between form and con
tent: Bob le Flambeur, dedicated
to style, is itself a stylistic
triumph.
