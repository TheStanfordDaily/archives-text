# Gov't report vindicates scientific communication
## 
### JAY FRAMSON 
A recent National Academy of Sciences (NAS) re
port has given universities new hope that a long
standing battle over government interference in the
free flow of ideas for security reasons may soon be
resolved.
Entitled "Scientific Communication and Na
tional Security," the report has been hailed by critics
of the government's attempts to apply export con
trols and other .limitations on academic research,
and has found favor with both university re
searchers and government officials.
The report, which was released September 30, was
drafted by a 19-member panel of university adminis
trators and scientists (including Wolfgang Pan
ofsky, director of the Stanford Linear Accelerator
Center) and representatives of industry and govern
ment agencies.
It finds, among other things, that "in cooperation
with other channels of technology transfer, open sci
entific communication involving the research com
munity does not present a material danger from
near-term military implications."
The panel, which was given access to classified in
formation, did find that "a substantial and serious
technology transfer problem exists." The report
points to espionage and illegal diversions by East
Bloc and Third World countries, as well as leakage
of American technology by legal means such as legal
equipment purchases. But the amount of technology
transfer due to the open nature of scientific research
in the United States was found to be insignificant.
"I think that this report in some sense vindicates
the universities' position," Gerald Lieberman, vice
provost and dean of graduate studies and research,
told the Daily.
Panofskv added in an interview that the report
makes a "ringing declaration" that the security of
the country is achieved through "security through
accomplishment" — a phrase Used by the panel to
refer to U.S. technological superiority achieved
through the free and open exchange of scientific in
formation — rather than through attempts to en

force secrecy.
The report appears against a backdrop of recent
pressure on universities to limit contact with Soviet
scientists and to restrict the publication of scientific
data that might damage U.S. security interests.
University faculty, meanwhile, have argued that
the advantages of the free flow of ideas here far out
weigh whatever security risks might be involved.
The issue has special meaning at Stanford, where
last year government and university policies came
into direct conflict in a widely publicized confronta
tion. The NAS proposed a visit by Nickolay Um
nov, a Soviet robotics expert, to Stanford and three
other American universities. When the State De
partment tried to place restrictions on Umnov's ac
tivities, however, the universities refused to comply
and the visit was cancelled.
Besides trying to limit the activities of foreign na
tionals on campus, the government has tried to re
strict university research in other ways, including
one suggestion that export regulations should be ex
panded to cover not only sensitive technology but
also scientific research. The Department of Defense
(DoD) is also considering placing restrictions on
DoD-funded research at private universities. DoD
funded research accounts for about one-sixth of all
research grants at Stanford.
Shortly after the Umnov episode, Lieberman
stated that "placing export regulations on university
research, or placing restrictions on visiting scholars,
will result in a research environment which will in
hibit creative research, and thereby do extreme
harm to our national security."
Lieberman cited the 1969 policy statement by the
senate of the Academic Council which provides that
all research undertaken at the University be un
classified and open to all.
Another method the government has encouraged
universities to use is prepublication review of tech
nological papers. Such a system is now in use by
cryptographers, researchers who work on decipher
ing secret codes.
This tack was recommended last January by

Adm. Bobby Inman, then-deputy director of the
CIA. Inman spoke of the "hemorrhage" of U.S.
technology and proposed that the cryptographers'
self-policing model be used in other areas of re
search such as lasers and computer hardware and
software. Inman's suggestions outraged many in the
scientific community at the time.
The NAS appointed the panel last winter to try to
defuse some of the tension that had grown up be
tween the ii\t«;iigence community and the research
community. The panel established a subpanel to ex
amine classified information and assess the govern
ment's claims that the Soviets had obtained sensitive
technology from the United States.
After reviewing the classified information, the
subpanel concluded that while there has been some
leakage of technology to the Soviets, universities
and open communication "appear to be a very small
part of this problem up to the present time."
Although the report recognizes that there has
been some technology transfer that has com
promised the nation's security in some areas, the
panel argues strongly against the expansion of re
strictions on open research.
The report recommends that restrictions be ap
plied to limit access or communication in university
research only in extreme cases where the direct ap
plication of the research will soon be possible, where
the technology would have direct military applica
tions that would give the Soviets significant advan
tage and when the United States or friendly nations
with secure controls were the only source of in
formation about the technology.
In addition, the report outlines some "gray areas"
where certain voluntary restrictions could be ap
plied by universities.
The report also concludes that voluntary controls
such as these used by cryptographers are unlikely to
be applicable to other research areas bearing on na
tional security.
The report points out that while the panel's study
was underway the government took two steps to re-
strain the flow of information. One was
to propose that the Freedom of In
formation Act be amended to exempt
certain categories of information from
disclosure. The other was a new ex
ecutive order on security classification

that makes it easier forii
to classify information,
But despite these dw

ty to the report has bea
optimistic. Lieberman.
