# Economist blames recession on Reagan's fiscal policies

The Reagan administration's overconfidence in the power of supply-side fiscal
policies and tight monetary policies to battle the twin perils of high inflation and
big government drove the economy into a recession which, though inevitable, was
far worse than it had to be, a former Carter administration economist said here
yesterday.
"There is absolutely nothing wrong with supply-side economics that dividing its
claims by a factor of 10 wouldn't cure," said Charles Schultze, chairman of the
Council of Economic Advisers for President Jimmy Carter. "Through supply-side
economics you do not bring inflation down."
Schultze told approximately 250 people gathered in the Business School that the
administration was right in choosing to take on inflation and big government, but
overdid its efforts to reduce the size of government and, through fiscally loose
meaures such as large-scale tax cuts, made the problem of inflation even worse. The
former economic adviser said efforts to balance this problem led to an excessively
tight monetary policy by the Federal Reserve Board, which led to high interest
rates which only now are "belatedly falling."
