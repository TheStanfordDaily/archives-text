# Drug charges outlined

### KRISTEN CHRISTOPHER Senior staff writer 
Three drug-related felony charges were filed against Stanford junior Neil
MacAvoy last week, in addition to a police report shedding light on the circum
stances surrounding his Oct. 6 arrest. MacAvoy was charged with importation of
marijuana and possession for sale of both marijuana and cocaine.
On Sept. 21, postal inspection dogs detected a package containing hashish which
had been sent to MacAvoy from China. He was arrested on Oct. 6 following de
livery of the package to him at his residence by a postal inspection officer.
MacAvoy was released later that day on $14,000 bail.
Though officers of MacAvoy's fraternity, Alpha Delta Phi, said he had not been
expecting the package, the police report filed with the North Santa Clara County
Municipal Court last week, states that before MacAvoy had seen the parcel, he
replied, "No, China," when someone in the house dining room inquired if the
package was from Peru.
That portion of the report was written by William Halonen, an inspector for the
U.S. Postal Service who delivered the package "while dressed in the uniform of a
U.S. Mailman," according to the re
port.
Halonen also stated, "I heard several
of the people cheer," when MacAvoy
held up the package in the dining room.
Another portion of the filed report
lists the goods that were taken from
MacAvoy's room under the authority
of a search warrant. Along with the
package containing hashish, a different
opened mail parcel from China, ad
dressed to MacAvoy from "J. Garcia,"
was found. The package that was de
livered by Halonen was sent from a
"Keith Godchaux," who is listed as a
second suspect in the case.
