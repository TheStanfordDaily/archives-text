Begin again rebuffs Reagan peace plan
Jerusalem — Prime Minister Menachem Begin, in a speech marking the
start of a "fundamental national debate" over the future of the Israeli-oc
cupied West Bank, scoffcd yesterday at proposals for a Jordanian-Palesti
nian federation and vowed that Israel would never relinquish control of the
territory.
Opening the winter session of the Knesset (parliament), Begin lumped to
gether as "the Jordanian option," President Reagan's peace proposals, the
opposition Labor Party's long-standing West Bank plan and the meeting last
week in Amman, Jordan, between Jordan's King Hussein and Palestine Lib
eration Organization (PLO) Chairman Yasser Arafat.
"Simply put, there is no Jordanian option; there is no Jordanian-Palesti
nian state," Begin said. He said the Arab League's recent summit in Fez,
Morocco, ruled out such a confederation even though Hussein and Arafat
discussed the possibility for four days shortly after the Fez meeting ended.
"That (Fez) conference, in the presence and with the agreement of King
Hussein, adopted a resolution that there should be established in Judea,
Samaria (Israel's terms for the West Bank) and the Gaza district an inde
pendent Palestinian state under the rule of the terrorist organization called
PLO, that is, Arafat and his henchmen," Begin said, perhaps taking the Fez
declaration more literally than some of the Arab kings and presidents who
signed it.
Begin also argued that if Israel relinquished control of the West Bank and
Gaza, the territories inevitably would become a PLO-dominated independ
ent state, regardless of the intent of the parties.
"He who places Judea, Samaria and the Gaza district outside the confines
of Eretz Israel (Begin's term for the biblical land of Israel which includes the
modern state, the West Bank), Gaza and much of Jordan, gives, in fact, his
consent... to the establishment of a Palestinian state ruled over by Arafat
and his followers," Begin said.
"Anybody who supports the grotesque suggestion of the annexation of
Judea and Samaria with the addition of Gaza to the Hashemite kingdom of
Jordan, is an accessory, in fact, to the establishment of a Palestinian, PLO
state, even when he has promised by oath that this is not his intention."
Gov't report says draft unlikely
Washington — A massive 14-month study by the
Reagan administration concluded yesterday that
the all-volunteer armed force has succeeded so well
that a return to a peacetime draft is unlikely.
However, the report said, the continued depen
dence on volunteers to fill the nation's military
ranks rests on maintaining "reasonably com
parable" pay with the civilian sector and on pro
viding recruits and careerists alike with bonuses
and special incentives.
Even with those initiatives, which the adminis
tration may be reluctant to fund, the report said
that by fiscal 1987 the Army will be 16,000 short in
enlisted personnel, the Navy 10 percent below its
required number of petty officers, and the Individ
ual Ready Reserves about 240,000 combat troops
short of requirements. The latter category contains
troops designated as replacements for wartime cas
ualties.
The conclusions of the report, issued by a presi
dential Military Manpower Task Force composed
of civilian administration officials, were in line
with President Reagan's aversion to a peacetime
draft, which he has called immoral.
The task force noted that "volunteer service,
among other virtues, is advantageous because it
makes it possible to avoid the political, legal and
manpower management problems that have his
torically accompanied a peacetime draft."
The leaders of the military services themselves
are known to favor a return to the draft.
A senior Pentagon official, who asked not to be
identified, said yesterday that "this place is full of
closet drafters," people favoring a return to con
scription. He said the report was made public hur
riedly yesterday in part to avoid "having the ser
vices inserting stuff (into it) making it look like a
draft is inevitable."
American wins Nobel Prize
An American scientist won the 1982 Nobel Prize
in physics yesterday for a mathematical theory ex
plaining the odd changes in the behavior of materi
als at high temperature and pressure. The prize for
chemistry was won by a scientist in Britain who de
veloped a method of deciphering the shapes of
many biologically important molecules.
The American physicist is Kenneth Wilson, 46,
of Cornell University, whose work is theoretical,
but may be useful in studies as varied as the work
on quarks, the building blocks of atoms, the study
of weather and hurricanes and the mixing of
metals.
The scientist working in Britain is a native South
African, Aaron Klug, 56, who has worked for the
past two decades at the Medical Research Council,
Britain's equivalent of America's National In
stitutes of Health. The awards committee of the
Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences said his work
might one day be crucial in the fight against cancer.
Wilson is the 46th American to be awarded the
Nobel Prize and the only American to win a Nobel
Prize in the sciences this year. The prize, first
awarded in 1901, is named after Alfred Nobel, who
invented dynamite.
Wilson developed a mathematical theory that al
lows physicists to predict the behavior of matter
when it reaches "critical points" of temperature or

pressure, such as the point at which a liquid turns
to a gas, or a magnetic bar loses its magnetism.
Truman's widow dies
Washington — Bess Truman, a first lady who
stood quietly but strongly behind her husband,
President Harry Truman, during his tumultuous,
history-making years in the White House, died of
congestive heart failure early yesterday at Re
search Medical Center in Kansas City, Mo. She
was 97.
Her long-time physician, Dr. Wallace Graham,
said her condition was complicated by a bleeding
ulcer, which had caused a recent hospitalization.
No family members were present when Bess
Truman died.
Since her husband's death on Dec. 26,1972, Bess
Truman, who never had enjoyed her place in the
limelight in Washington, rarely left her big, white,
Victorian home in Independence, Mo. There she
had the privacy she treasured for most of her life.
Gemayel asks forces to leave
United Nations — Lebanon's President Amin
Gemayel yesterday called for the "immediate and
unconditional withdrawal of all non-Lebanese
forces" from his country and asked for the world's
help in restoring Lebanon's "real independence."
The 40-year-old leader was applauded repeated
ly during his 20-minute address in accented, but
vigorous English before the U.N. General As
sembly. He predicted a Lebanon rebuilt on its own
and with international aid — "a Phoenix rising vic
torious from its own ashes.'"
Following his address, Gemayel met with U.S.
Ambassador Jeane Kirkpatrick and envoys of
France and Italy, and is reported to have estimated
that it will be at least a year before the Lebanese
army can assume the peace-keeping role now
played by the U.S.-French-Italian force in Beirut.
Gemayel made no mention in his speech of
either the multinational force or the U.N. Interim
Force in Lebanon, an 18-nation peace-keeping
unit, which was to be renewed by the Security
Council yesterday.
EPA outlaws dangerous pesticide
Washington — The Environmental Protection
Agency (EPA) yesterday banned most uses of tox
aphene, a widely used pesticide that kills wildlife
and may cause cancer in humans.
The move to ban the pesticide, which has been in
use since the 1950s and replaced DDT in many
areas when that chemical was outlawed in 1972,
arose after Congress approved funds last month to
outlaw toxaphene if the EPA failed to do so.
Toxaphene is used primarily to control boll
weevils in cotton, soyeans and peanuts, and as a
dip to fight scabies on cattle and sheep.
"This is one of the dinosaurs; it's been around
since Day One," Dr. John Todhunter, assistant
EPA administrator for pesticides, said of tox
aphene.
Todhunter said EPA's action, which goes into
effect in 40 days, will cut back the annual use of
toxaphene from the present 16 million tons to
about 900,000 pounds a year.
He said the agency would permit the use of tox
aphene for sheep and cattle dips until a substitute is
found for killing scabies, a highly contagious skin

disease caused by parasitic mites.
Todhunter also criticized the Carter adminis
tration for delaying a ban on the pesticide, saying.
"In contrast to our predecessors, we don t sit
around and talk about our commitment to the
health and welfare of the country. We are busy
doing something."
Chicago couple Tylenol suspects
Chicago — A former Chicago resident and his
wife, objects of a nationwide search, are prime
suspects" in the cyanide poisoning deaths of seven
people, state Attorney General Tyrone Fahner
said yesterday.
While describing the couple as the "kind of peo
ple who are capable" of the crimes, he said that in
vestigators have "no direct evidence to link them
to the killings.
Fahner said the fugitive man, who had been
known as James Lewis, is Theodore Wilson, who
was born in Memphis in 1946. Wilson has used 17
names including Robert Richardson, the name by
which he was first identified, Fahner said. He
added that Wilson's wife has used at least five
aliases.
The search for Wilson and his wife, Leann
Miller, is the "primary lead" in the probe of the
deaths of seven people who took cyanide-laced
capsules of Extra-Strength Tylenol.
Court overturns death sentence
San Francisco — The California Supreme Court
on yesterday reversed the conviction and death
sentence of a San Francisco man in the shotgun
slay ings of two men during a 1978 street confronta
tion, declaring that the suspect had been deprived
of the lawyer of his choice.
The unanimous decision by Justice Frank Rich
ardson said the right of John Gzikowski to counsel
"encompasses the right to retain counsel of one's
choice."
It said the right to a particular attorney is not
absolute, but it added that the state should min
imize interference with a person's desire to defend
himself in the way he feels best.
It said his not having the counsel of choice
deprived him of due process, requiring reversal re
gardless of whether the trial had been fair.
Gzikowski and Raul Villasenor, who was con
victed of second-degree murder, were accused of
killing Raymond Velonza and Gary Orais on April
20, 1978, in downtown San Francisco.
Stock market rally continues
New York — The stock market surged upward
to its highest level in almost a year and a half yes
terday as falling interest rates helped revive Wall
Street's two-month-old rally.
Numerous blue-chip and glamor stocks racked
up dramatic gains amid evidence that the market's
top names were attracting buyers at almost any
price.
Today's weather
Variable clouds today with a 20 percent chance
of sprinkles. Slightly cooler. Highs in the 60s.
Clearing tonight then mostly fair tomorrow.

Begin again rebuffs Reagan peace plan
Jerusalem — Prime Minister Menachem Begin, in a speech marking the
start of a "fundamental national debate" over the future of the Israeli-oc
cupied West Bank, scoffcd yesterday at proposals for a Jordanian-Palesti
nian federation and vowed that Israel would never relinquish control of the
territory.
Opening the winter session of the Knesset (parliament), Begin lumped to
gether as "the Jordanian option," President Reagan's peace proposals, the
opposition Labor Party's long-standing West Bank plan and the meeting last
week in Amman, Jordan, between Jordan's King Hussein and Palestine Lib
eration Organization (PLO) Chairman Yasser Arafat.
"Simply put, there is no Jordanian option; there is no Jordanian-Palesti
nian state," Begin said. He said the Arab League's recent summit in Fez,
Morocco, ruled out such a confederation even though Hussein and Arafat
discussed the possibility for four days shortly after the Fez meeting ended.
"That (Fez) conference, in the presence and with the agreement of King
Hussein, adopted a resolution that there should be established in Judea,
Samaria (Israel's terms for the West Bank) and the Gaza district an inde
pendent Palestinian state under the rule of the terrorist organization called
PLO, that is, Arafat and his henchmen," Begin said, perhaps taking the Fez
declaration more literally than some of the Arab kings and presidents who
signed it.
Begin also argued that if Israel relinquished control of the West Bank and
Gaza, the territories inevitably would become a PLO-dominated independ
ent state, regardless of the intent of the parties.
"He who places Judea, Samaria and the Gaza district outside the confines
of Eretz Israel (Begin's term for the biblical land of Israel which includes the
modern state, the West Bank), Gaza and much of Jordan, gives, in fact, his
consent... to the establishment of a Palestinian state ruled over by Arafat
and his followers," Begin said.
"Anybody who supports the grotesque suggestion of the annexation of
Judea and Samaria with the addition of Gaza to the Hashemite kingdom of
Jordan, is an accessory, in fact, to the establishment of a Palestinian, PLO
state, even when he has promised by oath that this is not his intention."
Gov't report says draft unlikely
Washington — A massive 14-month study by the
Reagan administration concluded yesterday that
the all-volunteer armed force has succeeded so well
that a return to a peacetime draft is unlikely.
However, the report said, the continued depen
dence on volunteers to fill the nation's military
ranks rests on maintaining "reasonably com
parable" pay with the civilian sector and on pro
viding recruits and careerists alike with bonuses
and special incentives.
Even with those initiatives, which the adminis
tration may be reluctant to fund, the report said
that by fiscal 1987 the Army will be 16,000 short in
enlisted personnel, the Navy 10 percent below its
required number of petty officers, and the Individ
ual Ready Reserves about 240,000 combat troops
short of requirements. The latter category contains
troops designated as replacements for wartime cas
ualties.
The conclusions of the report, issued by a presi
dential Military Manpower Task Force composed
of civilian administration officials, were in line
with President Reagan's aversion to a peacetime
draft, which he has called immoral.
The task force noted that "volunteer service,
among other virtues, is advantageous because it
makes it possible to avoid the political, legal and
manpower management problems that have his
torically accompanied a peacetime draft."
The leaders of the military services themselves
are known to favor a return to the draft.
A senior Pentagon official, who asked not to be
identified, said yesterday that "this place is full of
closet drafters," people favoring a return to con
scription. He said the report was made public hur
riedly yesterday in part to avoid "having the ser
vices inserting stuff (into it) making it look like a
draft is inevitable."
American wins Nobel Prize
An American scientist won the 1982 Nobel Prize
in physics yesterday for a mathematical theory ex
plaining the odd changes in the behavior of materi
als at high temperature and pressure. The prize for
chemistry was won by a scientist in Britain who de
veloped a method of deciphering the shapes of
many biologically important molecules.
The American physicist is Kenneth Wilson, 46,
of Cornell University, whose work is theoretical,
but may be useful in studies as varied as the work
on quarks, the building blocks of atoms, the study
of weather and hurricanes and the mixing of
metals.
The scientist working in Britain is a native South
African, Aaron Klug, 56, who has worked for the
past two decades at the Medical Research Council,
Britain's equivalent of America's National In
stitutes of Health. The awards committee of the
Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences said his work
might one day be crucial in the fight against cancer.
Wilson is the 46th American to be awarded the
Nobel Prize and the only American to win a Nobel
Prize in the sciences this year. The prize, first
awarded in 1901, is named after Alfred Nobel, who
invented dynamite.
Wilson developed a mathematical theory that al
lows physicists to predict the behavior of matter
when it reaches "critical points" of temperature or

pressure, such as the point at which a liquid turns
to a gas, or a magnetic bar loses its magnetism.
Truman's widow dies
Washington — Bess Truman, a first lady who
stood quietly but strongly behind her husband,
President Harry Truman, during his tumultuous,
history-making years in the White House, died of
congestive heart failure early yesterday at Re
search Medical Center in Kansas City, Mo. She
was 97.
Her long-time physician, Dr. Wallace Graham,
said her condition was complicated by a bleeding
ulcer, which had caused a recent hospitalization.
No family members were present when Bess
Truman died.
Since her husband's death on Dec. 26,1972, Bess
Truman, who never had enjoyed her place in the
limelight in Washington, rarely left her big, white,
Victorian home in Independence, Mo. There she
had the privacy she treasured for most of her life.
Gemayel asks forces to leave
United Nations — Lebanon's President Amin
Gemayel yesterday called for the "immediate and
unconditional withdrawal of all non-Lebanese
forces" from his country and asked for the world's
help in restoring Lebanon's "real independence."
The 40-year-old leader was applauded repeated
ly during his 20-minute address in accented, but
vigorous English before the U.N. General As
sembly. He predicted a Lebanon rebuilt on its own
and with international aid — "a Phoenix rising vic
torious from its own ashes.'"
Following his address, Gemayel met with U.S.
Ambassador Jeane Kirkpatrick and envoys of
France and Italy, and is reported to have estimated
that it will be at least a year before the Lebanese
army can assume the peace-keeping role now
played by the U.S.-French-Italian force in Beirut.
Gemayel made no mention in his speech of
either the multinational force or the U.N. Interim
Force in Lebanon, an 18-nation peace-keeping
unit, which was to be renewed by the Security
Council yesterday.
EPA outlaws dangerous pesticide
Washington — The Environmental Protection
Agency (EPA) yesterday banned most uses of tox
aphene, a widely used pesticide that kills wildlife
and may cause cancer in humans.
The move to ban the pesticide, which has been in
use since the 1950s and replaced DDT in many
areas when that chemical was outlawed in 1972,
arose after Congress approved funds last month to
outlaw toxaphene if the EPA failed to do so.
Toxaphene is used primarily to control boll
weevils in cotton, soyeans and peanuts, and as a
dip to fight scabies on cattle and sheep.
"This is one of the dinosaurs; it's been around
since Day One," Dr. John Todhunter, assistant
EPA administrator for pesticides, said of tox
aphene.
Todhunter said EPA's action, which goes into
effect in 40 days, will cut back the annual use of
toxaphene from the present 16 million tons to
about 900,000 pounds a year.
He said the agency would permit the use of tox
aphene for sheep and cattle dips until a substitute is
found for killing scabies, a highly contagious skin

disease caused by parasitic mites.
Todhunter also criticized the Carter adminis
tration for delaying a ban on the pesticide, saying.
"In contrast to our predecessors, we don t sit
around and talk about our commitment to the
health and welfare of the country. We are busy
doing something."
Chicago couple Tylenol suspects
Chicago — A former Chicago resident and his
wife, objects of a nationwide search, are prime
suspects" in the cyanide poisoning deaths of seven
people, state Attorney General Tyrone Fahner
said yesterday.
While describing the couple as the "kind of peo
ple who are capable" of the crimes, he said that in
vestigators have "no direct evidence to link them
to the killings.
Fahner said the fugitive man, who had been
known as James Lewis, is Theodore Wilson, who
was born in Memphis in 1946. Wilson has used 17
names including Robert Richardson, the name by
which he was first identified, Fahner said. He
added that Wilson's wife has used at least five
aliases.
The search for Wilson and his wife, Leann
Miller, is the "primary lead" in the probe of the
deaths of seven people who took cyanide-laced
capsules of Extra-Strength Tylenol.
Court overturns death sentence
San Francisco — The California Supreme Court
on yesterday reversed the conviction and death
sentence of a San Francisco man in the shotgun
slay ings of two men during a 1978 street confronta
tion, declaring that the suspect had been deprived
of the lawyer of his choice.
The unanimous decision by Justice Frank Rich
ardson said the right of John Gzikowski to counsel
"encompasses the right to retain counsel of one's
choice."
It said the right to a particular attorney is not
absolute, but it added that the state should min

known as James Lewis, is Theodore Wilson, who
was born in Memphis in 1946. Wilson has used 17
names including Robert Richardson, the name by
which he was first identified, Fahner said. He
added that Wilson's wife has used at least five
aliases.
The search for Wilson and his wife, Leann
Miller, is the "primary lead" in the probe of the
deaths of seven people who took cyanide-laced
capsules of Extra-Strength Tylenol.
Court overturns death sentence
San Francisco — The California Supreme Court
on yesterday reversed the conviction and death
sentence of a San Francisco man in the shotgun
slay ings of two men during a 1978 street confronta
tion, declaring that the suspect had been deprived
of the lawyer of his choice.
The unanimous decision by Justice Frank Rich
ardson said the right of John Gzikowski to counsel
"encompasses the right to retain counsel of one's
choice."
It said the right to a particular attorney is not
absolute, but it added that the state should min
imize interference with a person's desire to defend
himself in the way he feels best.
It said his not having the counsel of choice
deprived him of due process, requiring reversal re
gardless of whether the trial had been fair.
Gzikowski and Raul Villasenor, who was con
victed of second-degree murder, were accused of
killing Raymond Velonza and Gary Orais on April
20, 1978, in downtown San Francisco.

Begin again rebuffs Reagan peace plan
Jerusalem — Prime Minister Menachem Begin, in a speech marking the
start of a "fundamental national debate" over the future of the Israeli-oc
cupied West Bank, scoffcd yesterday at proposals for a Jordanian-Palesti
nian federation and vowed that Israel would never relinquish control of the
territory.
Opening the winter session of the Knesset (parliament), Begin lumped to
gether as "the Jordanian option," President Reagan's peace proposals, the
opposition Labor Party's long-standing West Bank plan and the meeting last
week in Amman, Jordan, between Jordan's King Hussein and Palestine Lib
eration Organization (PLO) Chairman Yasser Arafat.
"Simply put, there is no Jordanian option; there is no Jordanian-Palesti
nian state," Begin said. He said the Arab League's recent summit in Fez,
Morocco, ruled out such a confederation even though Hussein and Arafat
discussed the possibility for four days shortly after the Fez meeting ended.
"That (Fez) conference, in the presence and with the agreement of King
Hussein, adopted a resolution that there should be established in Judea,
Samaria (Israel's terms for the West Bank) and the Gaza district an inde
pendent Palestinian state under the rule of the terrorist organization called
PLO, that is, Arafat and his henchmen," Begin said, perhaps taking the Fez
declaration more literally than some of the Arab kings and presidents who
signed it.
Begin also argued that if Israel relinquished control of the West Bank and
Gaza, the territories inevitably would become a PLO-dominated independ
ent state, regardless of the intent of the parties.
"He who places Judea, Samaria and the Gaza district outside the confines
of Eretz Israel (Begin's term for the biblical land of Israel which includes the
modern state, the West Bank), Gaza and much of Jordan, gives, in fact, his
consent... to the establishment of a Palestinian state ruled over by Arafat
and his followers," Begin said.
"Anybody who supports the grotesque suggestion of the annexation of
Judea and Samaria with the addition of Gaza to the Hashemite kingdom of
Jordan, is an accessory, in fact, to the establishment of a Palestinian, PLO
state, even when he has promised by oath that this is not his intention."
Gov't report says draft unlikely
Washington — A massive 14-month study by the
Reagan administration concluded yesterday that
the all-volunteer armed force has succeeded so well
that a return to a peacetime draft is unlikely.
However, the report said, the continued depen
dence on volunteers to fill the nation's military
ranks rests on maintaining "reasonably com
parable" pay with the civilian sector and on pro
viding recruits and careerists alike with bonuses
and special incentives.
Even with those initiatives, which the adminis
tration may be reluctant to fund, the report said
that by fiscal 1987 the Army will be 16,000 short in
enlisted personnel, the Navy 10 percent below its
required number of petty officers, and the Individ
ual Ready Reserves about 240,000 combat troops
short of requirements. The latter category contains
troops designated as replacements for wartime cas
ualties.
The conclusions of the report, issued by a presi
dential Military Manpower Task Force composed
of civilian administration officials, were in line
with President Reagan's aversion to a peacetime
draft, which he has called immoral.
The task force noted that "volunteer service,
among other virtues, is advantageous because it
makes it possible to avoid the political, legal and
manpower management problems that have his
torically accompanied a peacetime draft."
The leaders of the military services themselves
are known to favor a return to the draft.
A senior Pentagon official, who asked not to be
identified, said yesterday that "this place is full of
closet drafters," people favoring a return to con
scription. He said the report was made public hur
riedly yesterday in part to avoid "having the ser
vices inserting stuff (into it) making it look like a
draft is inevitable."
American wins Nobel Prize
An American scientist won the 1982 Nobel Prize
in physics yesterday for a mathematical theory ex
plaining the odd changes in the behavior of materi
als at high temperature and pressure. The prize for
chemistry was won by a scientist in Britain who de
veloped a method of deciphering the shapes of
many biologically important molecules.
The American physicist is Kenneth Wilson, 46,
of Cornell University, whose work is theoretical,
but may be useful in studies as varied as the work
on quarks, the building blocks of atoms, the study
of weather and hurricanes and the mixing of
metals.
The scientist working in Britain is a native South
African, Aaron Klug, 56, who has worked for the
past two decades at the Medical Research Council,
Britain's equivalent of America's National In
stitutes of Health. The awards committee of the
Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences said his work
might one day be crucial in the fight against cancer.
Wilson is the 46th American to be awarded the
Nobel Prize and the only American to win a Nobel
Prize in the sciences this year. The prize, first
awarded in 1901, is named after Alfred Nobel, who
invented dynamite.
Wilson developed a mathematical theory that al
lows physicists to predict the behavior of matter
when it reaches "critical points" of temperature or

pressure, such as the point at which a liquid turns
to a gas, or a magnetic bar loses its magnetism.
Truman's widow dies
Washington — Bess Truman, a first lady who
stood quietly but strongly behind her husband,
President Harry Truman, during his tumultuous,
history-making years in the White House, died of
congestive heart failure early yesterday at Re
search Medical Center in Kansas City, Mo. She
was 97.
Her long-time physician, Dr. Wallace Graham,
said her condition was complicated by a bleeding
ulcer, which had caused a recent hospitalization.
No family members were present when Bess
Truman died.
Since her husband's death on Dec. 26,1972, Bess
Truman, who never had enjoyed her place in the
limelight in Washington, rarely left her big, white,
Victorian home in Independence, Mo. There she
had the privacy she treasured for most of her life.
Gemayel asks forces to leave
United Nations — Lebanon's President Amin
Gemayel yesterday called for the "immediate and
unconditional withdrawal of all non-Lebanese
forces" from his country and asked for the world's
help in restoring Lebanon's "real independence."
The 40-year-old leader was applauded repeated
ly during his 20-minute address in accented, but
vigorous English before the U.N. General As
sembly. He predicted a Lebanon rebuilt on its own
and with international aid — "a Phoenix rising vic
torious from its own ashes.'"
Following his address, Gemayel met with U.S.
Ambassador Jeane Kirkpatrick and envoys of
France and Italy, and is reported to have estimated
that it will be at least a year before the Lebanese
army can assume the peace-keeping role now
played by the U.S.-French-Italian force in Beirut.
Gemayel made no mention in his speech of
either the multinational force or the U.N. Interim
Force in Lebanon, an 18-nation peace-keeping
unit, which was to be renewed by the Security
Council yesterday.
EPA outlaws dangerous pesticide
Washington — The Environmental Protection
Agency (EPA) yesterday banned most uses of tox
aphene, a widely used pesticide that kills wildlife
and may cause cancer in humans.
The move to ban the pesticide, which has been in
use since the 1950s and replaced DDT in many
areas when that chemical was outlawed in 1972,
arose after Congress approved funds last month to
outlaw toxaphene if the EPA failed to do so.
Toxaphene is used primarily to control boll
weevils in cotton, soyeans and peanuts, and as a
dip to fight scabies on cattle and sheep.
"This is one of the dinosaurs; it's been around
since Day One," Dr. John Todhunter, assistant
EPA administrator for pesticides, said of tox
aphene.
Todhunter said EPA's action, which goes into
effect in 40 days, will cut back the annual use of
toxaphene from the present 16 million tons to
about 900,000 pounds a year.
He said the agency would permit the use of tox
aphene for sheep and cattle dips until a substitute is
found for killing scabies, a highly contagious skin

disease caused by parasitic mites.
Todhunter also criticized the Carter adminis
tration for delaying a ban on the pesticide, saying.
"In contrast to our predecessors, we don t sit
around and talk about our commitment to the
health and welfare of the country. We are busy
doing something."
Chicago couple Tylenol suspects
Chicago — A former Chicago resident and his
wife, objects of a nationwide search, are prime
suspects" in the cyanide poisoning deaths of seven
people, state Attorney General Tyrone Fahner
said yesterday.
While describing the couple as the "kind of peo
ple who are capable" of the crimes, he said that in
vestigators have "no direct evidence to link them
to the killings.
Fahner said the fugitive man, who had been

effect in 40 days, will cut back the annual use of
toxaphene from the present 16 million tons to
about 900,000 pounds a year.
He said the agency would permit the use of tox
aphene for sheep and cattle dips until a substitute is
found for killing scabies, a highly contagious skin

disease caused by parasitic mites.
Todhunter also criticized the Carter adminis
tration for delaying a ban on the pesticide, saying.
"In contrast to our predecessors, we don t sit
around and talk about our commitment to the
health and welfare of the country. We are busy
doing something."
Chicago couple Tylenol suspects
Chicago — A former Chicago resident and his
wife, objects of a nationwide search, are prime
suspects" in the cyanide poisoning deaths of seven
people, state Attorney General Tyrone Fahner
said yesterday.
While describing the couple as the "kind of peo
ple who are capable" of the crimes, he said that in
vestigators have "no direct evidence to link them
to the killings.
Fahner said the fugitive man, who had been
known as James Lewis, is Theodore Wilson, who
was born in Memphis in 1946. Wilson has used 17
names including Robert Richardson, the name by
which he was first identified, Fahner said. He
added that Wilson's wife has used at least five
aliases.
The search for Wilson and his wife, Leann
Miller, is the "primary lead" in the probe of the
deaths of seven people who took cyanide-laced
capsules of Extra-Strength Tylenol.
Court overturns death sentence
San Francisco — The California Supreme Court
on yesterday reversed the conviction and death
sentence of a San Francisco man in the shotgun
slay ings of two men during a 1978 street confronta
tion, declaring that the suspect had been deprived
of the lawyer of his choice.
The unanimous decision by Justice Frank Rich
ardson said the right of John Gzikowski to counsel
"encompasses the right to retain counsel of one's
choice."
It said the right to a particular attorney is not
absolute, but it added that the state should min
imize interference with a person's desire to defend
himself in the way he feels best.
It said his not having the counsel of choice
deprived him of due process, requiring reversal re
gardless of whether the trial had been fair.
Gzikowski and Raul Villasenor, who was con
victed of second-degree murder, were accused of
killing Raymond Velonza and Gary Orais on April
20, 1978, in downtown San Francisco.
