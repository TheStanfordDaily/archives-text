Begin again rebuffs Reagan peace plan
Jerusalem — Prime Minister Menachem Begin, in a speech marking the
start of a "fundamental national debate" over the future of the Israeli-oc
cupied West Bank, scoffcd yesterday at proposals for a Jordanian-Palesti
nian federation and vowed that Israel would never relinquish control of the
territory.
Opening the winter session of the Knesset (parliament), Begin lumped to
gether as "the Jordanian option," President Reagan's peace proposals, the
opposition Labor Party's long-standing West Bank plan and the meeting last
week in Amman, Jordan, between Jordan's King Hussein and Palestine Lib
eration Organization (PLO) Chairman Yasser Arafat.
"Simply put, there is no Jordanian option; there is no Jordanian-Palesti
nian state," Begin said. He said the Arab League's recent summit in Fez,
Morocco, ruled out such a confederation even though Hussein and Arafat
discussed the possibility for four days shortly after the Fez meeting ended.
"That (Fez) conference, in the presence and with the agreement of King
Hussein, adopted a resolution that there should be established in Judea,
Samaria (Israel's terms for the West Bank) and the Gaza district an inde
pendent Palestinian state under the rule of the terrorist organization called
PLO, that is, Arafat and his henchmen," Begin said, perhaps taking the Fez
declaration more literally than some of the Arab kings and presidents who
signed it.
Begin also argued that if Israel relinquished control of the West Bank and
Gaza, the territories inevitably would become a PLO-dominated independ
ent state, regardless of the intent of the parties.
"He who places Judea, Samaria and the Gaza district outside the confines
of Eretz Israel (Begin's term for the biblical land of Israel which includes the
modern state, the West Bank), Gaza and much of Jordan, gives, in fact, his
consent... to the establishment of a Palestinian state ruled over by Arafat
and his followers," Begin said.
"Anybody who supports the grotesque suggestion of the annexation of
Judea and Samaria with the addition of Gaza to the Hashemite kingdom of
Jordan, is an accessory, in fact, to the establishment of a Palestinian, PLO
state, even when he has promised by oath that this is not his intention."
