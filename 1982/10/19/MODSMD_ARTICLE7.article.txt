# Cable TV system for University in planning stage
## 
### DAN TURNER 
Tuning into a nationwide trend
toward municipal cable television sys
tems, area leaders are considering plans
for a cable network that would reach all
University residences as well as the
greater Palo Alto area in as little as two
years.
This system, which is still in the plan
ning stage, is currently being discussed
by the Palo Alto City Council in coop
eration with a University steering com
mittee headed by Associate Provost
Mitchell Oman.
In addition to receiving the kind of
entertainment programming provided
by other pay-TV networks, subscribers
could hook up personal computers to
the new system in order to gain access to
data bases or to each other for sending
direct computer mail.
The benefits to Stanford of the pro
posed system are outlined in a complete
report prepared by the steering commit
tee earlier this year. Few developments
have taken place since June. The com
mittee is experiencing difficulties result
ing from various changes in the City of
Palo Alto's position on this issue, ac
cording to Oman.
According to the report, the system's
projected uses fall into four basic cate
gories: entertainment and personal
computing; public service; University
administration; and instruction and re
search.
A certain channel may be used to an
nounce University events, such as dra

matic performances or upcoming
speeches, the document continues. In
formation about registration and class
scheduling would be broadcast on this
channel, as would Stanford sports and
musical presentations of interest to
Stanford students and people in the sur
rounding area.
A cable system connecting campus
buildings to local police and fire sta
tions could be used to support an entire

ly new security system. In addition, the
task of University administration
would be greatly simplified by this com
paratively cheap and efficient method
of data transfer and interdepartmental
communication, according to op
timistic predictions.
Finally, video-taped replays of
selected courses could be broadcast
both for students who want to review
lectures and by people in the local engi

neering community who wish to
broaden their knowledge of the subject.
New technology has made cable tele
vision an extremely useful tool for
modern communication, the report
concludes. Cable's broadband signal
ling system is capable of supporting a
multitude of channels while operating
at a power level far below that required
for a standard TV or radio trans
mission. This makes it a remarkably ef
ficient and versatile operation.
Approximately 4500 cable systems
are operating in about 10,000 cities na
tionwide, making cable available to 32
percent of all TV homes
Other universities, such as Brown,
Princeton and Michigan State, and
Dartmouth College are considering in
stalling cable systems.
Though officials seem confident that
cable will eventually reach the Stanford
community, there are some serious
problems which remain unsettled, ac
cording to Oman. Perhaps the most im
portant of these is the question of own
ership; members of the University steer
ing committee had hoped that Palo
Alto would opt for municipal own
ership of the system, Oman said, but in
stead the City Council is now accepting
bids from private cable companies for
the use of their systems.
Another grey area to be refined in
volves how Stanford programming and
computer connections will be inte
grated with Palo Alto, Oman added.
