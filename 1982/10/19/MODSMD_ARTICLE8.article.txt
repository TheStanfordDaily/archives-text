## Model rocketry society 
### DANA RATLIFF 
Have you ever wondered what goes into the mak
ing of a model rocket? Have you ever wanted to
build a structure that could break the speed of
sound? Rocketry is the sport that welcomes be
ginners. Simple or intricate, rockets range from a
hobbv shop creation to more advanced models of
high speed and carrying radio controls, timers or
cameras. Under the direction of Martin Huber, a
graduate student at Stanford who previously at
tended the Massachusetts Institute of Technology,
the Stanford Rocket Society makes it possible for
anyone to build a simple rocket for fun, competi
tion or research.
A former, active member of a rocket club at MIT,
Huber came to Stanford with the idea of starting a
new rocket society, planning to charter it with the
National Association of Rocketry (NAR). An ex
perienced rocketeer, Huber developed a new meth
od of measuring the altitudes of rockets that was of
ficially accepted by the NAR.
H über said that interest, not experience, is all one
needs to get involved with rocketry.
"Everyone in rocketry is just sort of playing
around with it,"he said.
No special knowledge is required for one who is
interested in building a model rocket. Parts can be
bought in any hobby shop; all that is needed is a
cardboard tube for the body, balsa wood for the
nose cone and fins, a pre-manufactured engine
(costing 50 cents to $11), and a simple parachute re
covery system. Glued together, the body elements
make the finished rocket that is ready to be spray
painted and provided with the solid propellent for
fuel. Launched electronically, the rocket can reach
speeds of 200 to 300 mph or more.
Experienced hobbyists proceed to design and

build more intricate models — employing trigger
devices, cameras and radio controls that direct the
rockets to fly higher, longer and further, or that in
struct them to do simple tasks such as taking photos
or recording research information.
Costing about SlOO, radio controls enable the
user to guide the rocket as it glides down from the
rapid ascent, directing it into potential heat
thermals that prolong the flight.
Freshman Stuart Swan, an experienced rocketeer
and helium balloonist, said: "The field of rocketry
does not have much more room to expand, but I
think photography is the way to go from here."

An aerial photograph of a house taken 4000 feet
above the ground won Swan a trip to Disneyland in
a cameta-sponsored contest. Using several large
helium balloons, Swan lifted the camera that had a
wristwatch timing device. As the long hand reached
12, a trigger was set off that caused the camera to
fall away from the balloons and take the picture.
Interested in both helium balloons and rockets,
Swan wants to trv using a movie camera at a pos
sible height of 20,000 feet. Swan's present goal "to
get a camera up to 100,000 feet" is hindered due to
icing of the balloons at such extreme altitudes.
For those interested in setting records, one may
become a member of the NAR to officiate things
such as speed or duration of flight for national rec
ognition. Membership to NAR also enables a rock
eteer to pay $4 per year for $2 million dollars of lia
bility insurance.
Rocketry is accepted as a safe and legal hobby na
tionally due to the National Fire Protection Laws
(NFPL), but a few states ban the operations of
model rockets.
"Some states still think we are fireworks," said
Huber.
Model rockets are actually very different from
fireworks — nothing explodes or displays sparks.
Built to be recovered, model rockets are used over
and over again, unlike fireworks.
In order to maintain a high level of safety for
rocket users and the general public, the NFPL sets
stiff model rocketry regulations. Safety code laws
state that a rocket can't weigh more than one
pound, use more than eight ounces of propellant or
be launched at more than a 30 degree angle. No
matches can be used to ignite the rocket; electric
launches are required. Ensuring the safety of per
sons and property, a model rocket also cannot carry
any metal as part of its structure.
