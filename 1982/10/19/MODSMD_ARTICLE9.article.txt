"What happened to Dupie 7*
Alumnus Gil Morales said
the question often arises
about his cartoon strip which
ran in the Daily for four years.
The answer: Dupie is still
around. Ballantins Books, fa
mous for Garfield and Peanuts
, is publishing a Dupie book in
1983 and Collegiate Pacific is
selling Dupie t-shirts na
tionwide. i
The Ballantine book, Wake
Me Up When the Semester's
Over, is a re-packaged version
of Dupie: Life and Times of a

Morales plans to dissolve
Dupie Press this year. He will
work on a new cartoon strip,
Newton, for syndication.
Newton, Morales' new alter
ego, lives and works at a hum
drum job in Metropopulous.
The exact nature of New
ton's job is never disclosed,
but he works for Con
glomerates, Inc., a company
which produces some ap
parently morally questionable
product such as pesticides,
missiles or plastics.

"Newton is sort of taking
the typical graduate route, but
the whole time his conscience
is telling him something else,"
said Morales.
Similarly to many students

here, said Morales, Newton
grapples with his conscience
about his job. But in the end,
he must sell out if he wishes to
eat.
Newton's name arose from
a dream in which Morales was
lying down in a field of grass
with fig newtons falling
around him. This, rather than
a fondness for the "gooey"
cookie, led to the new charac
ter's name.
Morales said Field Syndi
cate, which publishes the
Wizard of Id, has asked for six
week's worth of strips. (A syn
dicated cartoonist should be
six weeks ahead, explained
Morales.)
Ballantine wanted Morales
to syndicate Dupie to help
book sales, but Morales wants

to work on Newton. The new
character will have a broad
base similar to Doonesbury,
which will enable Morales to
make social comments. This
became difficult with Dupie,

who was tailored to be "cute,
harmless, docile. Middle
America," said Morales. As a
result, the cartoonist began

What is Morales doing?
For one thing, he is working
on an ad campaign for San
Antonio Shopping Center.

For another, the cartoonist,
with a B.A. in economics from
Stanford, is an accountant by
day."I like to go out to
lunch," he said. Morales also
enjoys traveling, hiking and
running. When Newton is syn
dicated, Morales plans to
work-full time'on his strip.

Morales has appeared on
several local TV programs.

tend to make him appear

rales.

local farmers. "Cartoonists
are not like rock stars," said
Morales.
Morales, who first drew a
cartoon to fill some blank
space in his high school news
paper, traced the origins of
Dupie to a rush party con
versation freshman year. "I
said 1 was going to be a fa

on an ad campaign for San
Antonio Shopping Center.

For another, the cartoonist,
with a B.A. in economics from
Stanford, is an accountant by
day."I like to go out to
lunch," he said. Morales also
enjoys traveling, hiking and
running. When Newton is syn

work-full time'on his strip.

will have a broad
base similar to
Doonesbury, which
will enable Morales
to make social
comments. This
became difficult
with Dupie, who
was tailored to be

Morales.

Morales has appeared on
several local TV programs.
These programs, however,
tend to make him appear
"larger than life," said Mo
rales.

toonist lives nearby in a co-op
house nicknamed "Good

local farmers. "Cartoonists
are not like rock stars," said
Morales.
Morales, who first drew a
cartoon to fill some blank
space in his high school news
paper, traced the origins of
Dupie to a rush party con

said 1 was going to be a fa

Newton, Morales' new alter
ego, lives and works at a hum
drum job in Metropopulous.
The exact nature of New
ton's job is never disclosed,
but he works for Con
glomerates, Inc., a company
which produces some ap
parently morally questionable
product such as pesticides,
missiles or plastics.

"Newton is sort of taking
the typical graduate route, but
the whole time his conscience
is telling him something else,"
said Morales.
Similarly to many students

here, said Morales, Newton
grapples with his conscience
about his job. But in the end,
he must sell out if he wishes to
eat.
Newton's name arose from
a dream in which Morales was
lying down in a field of grass
with fig newtons falling
around him. This, rather than
a fondness for the "gooey"
cookie, led to the new charac
ter's name.
Morales said Field Syndi
cate, which publishes the
Wizard of Id, has asked for six
week's worth of strips. (A syn
dicated cartoonist should be
six weeks ahead, explained
Morales.)
Ballantine wanted Morales
to syndicate Dupie to help
book sales, but Morales wants

to work on Newton. The new
character will have a broad
base similar to Doonesbury,
