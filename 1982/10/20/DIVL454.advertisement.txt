Just What You've
Been Looking For!
There's an exciting new indoor/outdoor cafe
just across El Camino from the campus.
We're open from 11:00 to 11:00 daily except Sundays,
serving a moderately priced cosmopolitan menu:
delicious homemade soups,
lots of fresh fruits and vegetables,
and great specialty dishes from around the world.
The assortment of desserts, espresso drinks,
and fine wines are perfect for an afternoon
or late evening snack. And to top it all
we serve 40 of the world's best beers.
