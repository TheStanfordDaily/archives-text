Kudos for financial aid revival

Congress deserves a welcome round of applause
for pressuring President Reagan into not cutting
federal loans and grants to almost 2 million stu
dents across the country.
Reagan last week reluctantly signed legislation
which will ensure that the same number of poor and
middle-class students will be eligible for federal aid
in 1983-84 that were eligible this year. The adminis
tration had attempted all year to eliminate some or
all federal aid to more than a third of the 5.5 million
students now eligible for loans or grants.
The two largest programs affected are the Pell
Grant program for needy students and the Guaran
teed Student Loan (GSL) program for poor and
middle-class students. Though the bill does not in
volve any appropriations, it means that 2 million
poor students will still be eligible for Pell Grants of
up to $lBOO per year and 3.5 million students will
continue to be able to get GSLs up to a maximum of
$2500 per year.
Pell Grants are available to families with up to
$25,000 in yearly "discretionary income" and who
pay up to one-fourth of college costs. Reagan had
wished to lower the income limit to $lB,OOO and
toask families to pay almost one-half of all costs.
GSLs up to a maximum of $2500 per year will
now continue to be available to families with yearly
incomes under $30,000. Families making more
than $30,000 must continue to meet a "needs test"
which takes into consideration factors such as the
cost of the school the student will attend in de
termining how large a loan is deserved.
The Reagan administration has been correctly
concerned with these expensive programs and we
do not wish to downplay the necessity for keeping
fraud and waste out of such a high-cost federal fi
nancial aid program.
The program should continue to crack down on
defaulting students. In addition, we agree that the
program does need the protection of some sort of
needs test to ensure that students take out loans for
their education and not for a new car or for invest
ment in a money market fund. However, we do
question the inflexibility of the current needs test

for those students who must put themselves
through college and those with parents unwilling to
contribute to education costs.
The philosophy of the current administration has
extended beyond the two prograpis included in last
week's legislation. It has also resulted in the much
less-publicized curtailment of social security funds
to college students receiving payments because of
the death or disability of a parent. Pre-Reagan, stu
dents over the age of 18 who are attending college
had been able to receive these monthly payments
until they graduate.
The federal government should be concerned
with the possiblity of creating an elitist atmosphere
at U.S. universities. Maybe well-endowed schools
like Stanford, which claim to meet the needs of all
students, will still be able to attract lower-income
students, but many others will not.
Costs at both independent and public universities
have risen tremendously. The California Student
Aid Commission just announced that for the first
time in 26 years it will not even be able to pay the
full fees for its neediest Cal Grant recipients at less
expensive UC or Cal State schools. Just how such a
gloomy educational atmosphere will affect poorer
high school students especially minority stu
dents trying to decide if they should attend col
lege is difficult to measure, but is certainly a valid
fear.
Though we recognize the election year jitters that
contributed to the congressional —and eventually
presidential— decision not to touch the popular
Pell and GSL programs this year, we hope that this
legislation will exemplify a return to sanity in re
gards to the federal financial aid programs.
Education is just too important to be unthinking
ly axed amid federal budget- cutting fever. Student
loans and grants deserve a high priority in the feder
al budget procedure. The Reagan administration's
concerns for a return to economic prosperity in the
U.S. must recognize the need for the educated to
lead the way. Without educational investment in
people, industrial investment in business will be
worthless.

Food service: now is the time. . .

Many students have realized that when those hef
ty strike-related food rebates are funneled into their
intended destination the University food service
system what emerges Stem, Wilbur or Roble
dinners may not be a fair return.
It's particularly difficult to find a silver lining in
the entire putrid cloud of the strike's charges and
recriminations, but if there is one, the lining may be
the small lightning bolt the strike conditions should
provide for reform of the food service system. Stu
dents found that $6O goes a long way toward a
week's worth of good and healthy food often
with money left over to start paying next quarter's
book bills.
The strike may be the push needed to transform
into action those vague feelings of inequity and to
overcome the resignation to the current system
bred by decades of meal cards and pleas for more
hashers.
Change, although necessary, will not be easy, but
there are signs of progress. Far-reaching plans for
providing better service through major structural
reforms have been broached only for consideration
of further consideration: in the short run, however,
there are several plans that may improve service.
Discussions continue about the possibilities of pay
as-you-eat services, ethnic arid specialty food ser
vice offerings, expansion of self-op food service,
private catering services and more flexible meal
plans.
Shaping the food service system has been one of
the ASSU government's most time-consuming and

potentially fruitful activities. Staging with last
year's food service task force, the ASSU has laid
much of the groundwork for modification; now, af
ter the strike, seems a particularly opportune time
to realize benefits from hours of research and argu
ment.
One possible change, a pay-as-you eat service, is a
local version ofWashington's latest rage, "user
fees." In this case, roast beef arid yogurt replace
dams and highways, but the principle is the same: if
you benefit from it, you pay for it. Although this
system presents problems of impersonality and ac
counting, its obvious advantage of eliminating the
inequity of an "all you can eat" policy alone should
prompt consideration. As occurred during the
strike, versions of this plan can reduce waste dra
matically.
The many treks to a co-op, self-op or off-campus
eating group during the strike showed many the
benefits of a diverse food service system. Whether
serving ethnic food in some locations or allowing
smaller living groups such as the Row Houses to
convert easily to self-ops that manage their own
food needs, there is room within the current system
for diversity and, perish the thought, some version
of private enterprise.
Choice, whether for higher wages or for a leaner
University budget, was a major issue in the strike,
but we hope the strike brings another and more sat
isfying choice: the choice a flexible, equitable, di
verse and less expensive food service system might
provide.
