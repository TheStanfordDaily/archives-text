## Dual goal set for U.S. Poland policy 
### 
A foreigner asks a Pole whether he considers the Soviets to
be brothers or friends. "They're brothers," the Pole insists.
"I'm surprised you think so," the stranger admits. "Why
should you be?" replies the Pole, "Friends one can choose."
It is perhaps a tragic commentary on human nature to
state that the things which at first arouse our indignation and
sympathy soon fail even to arouse our curiosity. People tend
to become desensitized to the suffering of others. Empathy,
with time, succumbs to indifference. Such is the case with
our attitude to the still-festering crisis in Poland.
The drama of the rise and suppression of the Polish inde
pendent labor union, Solidarity, has now come full circle.
Little if anything has changed in the Gdansk of October.
1982 from the Gdansk of August 1980. The Poles are still
hungry. The Poles are still not free.
In some respects, General Wojciech Jaruzelski's martial
law has been a success. From the standpoint of dedicated
Communists and cronies of the Kremlin, Jaruzelski has suc
ceeded to a large degree in restoring order to Poland. The
government is back in charge of the country and the over
broadening demands of the workers have been successfully
circumscribed.
The great majority of Poles are not dedicated Com
munists. They fall mostly between being "Pole first, Com
munist second," and being blatantly anti-communist and
anti-Soviet. Socialism, which was imposed on Poland from
without, has yet to win the heart and mind of the average
Pole. And martial law, for all its thuggery, has yet to achieve
its stated goal of "national accord."
Jaruzelski's martial law is reactionary in the truest dic
tionary sense of the word. It is an attempt to maintain the
status quo, to prop up a government and an economic sys
tem which have lost the support of the governed and to stabi
lize a crisis by treating the symptoms without making the re
forms necessary to eliminate the malady.
Although the rulers and governments have changed, the
same conditions which led to the bread riots in 1956, the riots
of 1970, the strikes and demonstrations of 1976., and the
birth of Solidarity in 1980 continue to exist. And that is why
the Polish situation represents such an intolerable threat to
the Soviet Union.
There is little doubt that the Soviet Union would never
have let the movement led by Solidarity achieve its natural
conclusion: pluralism. Such a rejection of the socialist sys
tem would be a serious threat both to the Soviet Union's
hegemony over Eastern Europe, and ultimately to the very
rule of the Kremlin within the U.S.S.R. itself.
Most analysts believe that the Soviet Union, if required to
do so, would have taken any steps necessary to stifle the con
tagion of Solidarity including military intervention in the
face of Western counter-measures. However, military in
tervention was not undertaken since the Soviet Union man
aged to accomplish its objectives through intimidation. For
if martial law was not imposed at the direct bidding of the
Kremlin, it at least must have been imposed by the Polish
army in order to avert Soviet intervention.
In addition to driving another wedge between Western

On the other hand, while it is natural for us to sympathize
with the elements of democratization and nationalism in Po
land, this sympathy must be balanced by a pragmatic policy
which will continue to deter aggression, secure stability, and
ensure peace. Desire for Ostpolitik must be countered by a
Realpolitik emphasis on the consequences of democrat
ization in Eastern Europe. Although we may feel "solidar-'
ity" with the oppressed Poles, we must be careful to deter
and not to provoke aggression. It is possible that a conti
nuance of the East-West status quo in Europe is in our best
interest in preventing continental or global military conflict.
American policy must somehow attempt to achieve the
impossible: to promote freedom and human rights, while ap
proaching security arrangements on the basis of
pragmatism. It would be a crime to aid the Soviets in op
pressing the people of Eastern Europe, yet a break-up of the
Soviet empire could well escalate into WWIII.
The recent riots in Gdansk are grounds for sadness, op
timism and fear. Grounds for sadness because so many peo
ple are being deprived of human rights, optimism because
the Solidarity movement lives on under martial law, and fear
because it seems the maintenance of stability Soviet
hegemony in Eastern Europe is like keeping a lid on a pot
of hot water: sooner or later things will boil over and with
horrifying consequence. <

Europe and the United States, the crisis in Poland has served
to underline an ever-present conflict in American foreign
policy: ideology vs. interest. Ideologically, American*
cannot but sympathize and feel for the plight of the Pole*
Their cause is our cause: the oppressed Poles share our antip
athy for Communist tyranny. How can we not support those
suffering in the cause of freedom?
Along with this motive is the American desire to see the
victory of our ideology, not merely the 'containment' of
communist ideology. President Reagan, an intensely ideol
ogical man, is moved by this desire as evidenced by his quest
to put communism in the "dust bin of history." A defeat of
socialism in Poland would be seen by many Americans as a
victory of good over evil.
