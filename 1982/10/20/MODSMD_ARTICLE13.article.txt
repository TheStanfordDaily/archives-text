## President fails to relate consequences to policy 
### 
A year ago, President Reagan de
clared that "our economic program is
designed for the very purpose of creat
ing jobs ... Let us make our goal in this
program very clear jobs, jobs, jobs,
and more jobs." Candidate Reagan
said he was committed to full em
ployment (Columbus, Ohio, Aug. 27,
1980). And he swore not to use un
employment to cure inflation (N.Y.,
Aug. 5, 1980).
Reagan has broken his promises and
has failed the American people. Un
employment stands at the highest level
since the Great Depression. 10.1 per
cent of this nation's workers, over elev
en million men and women, are jobless.
Over six million more want to work full
time, but can only find part time jobs.
Nearly another two million are so dis
couraged that they have stopped active
ly seeking work altogether, and are not
officially counted in the ranks of the un
employed.
Apparently, Reagan has difficulty re
lating to the consequences of his failed
economic policies. He callously asked
on March 16, 1982, "It is news that
some fellow out in South Succotash
someplace has just been laid off that he
should be interviewed nationwide?"
Yes, it is news because that "fellow in
South Succotash" is representative of
11 million other unemployed victims of
the Republican recession.

Many share candidate Reagan's 1980
commitment to full employment. All
recent polls show that unemployment is
the one issue that most concerns the
American people. Regrettably, rather
than progressing toward full em
ployment, this administration's policies
have put nearly three and a half million
people out of work in the last 15
months.
The federal government has a re
sponsibility to serve as the employer of
last resort. In a nation which so reveres
the work ethic, no policy other than one
which provides jobs for all those wish
ihng to work is acceptable. It is a monu
mental waste of potential productivity
for this nation's factories to be operat
ing at less than 70 percent of capacity
the lowest level since the last Re
publican economic slump in 1975
while millions search for jobs. •
What, then, are the alternatives? To
combat unemployment, in the short
run, several measures, involving
progressively greater degrees of govern
ment involvement, should be enacted.
First, the federal government should
encourage business to enlarge its work
force by providing tax incentives to do
so. For each previously unemployed
worker added to a business's payroll,
without the consequent laying off of an
other worker, the government should
grant that business a tax credit, pro
vided the new employee has been un

employed at least three months. The
credit should be equal to the amount of
federal transfer payments the worker
received during the previous three
months and should be granted only if
the employee were kept on the payroll
for at least a half a year.
This proposal is a straight-forward
and actually revenue-positive means for
the United States to help the jobless
find meaningful employment. With a
minimum of federal interference, it in
duces business to hire the unemployed,
thereby decreasing unemployment and
increasing business production. The
drop in unemployment will cut govern
ment transfer payments and, because
these newly employed workers become
new taxpayers, it will increase govern
ment revenues a good first step
toward reducing both unemployment
and the federal budget deficit.
Second, unemployment could be re
duced by directing the allocation of
government funds from one, less job
productive, to another, more job pro
ductive, part of the budget. To il
lustrate, according to the Center for
Defense Information (and other groups
concur), a $1 billion spent on the MX
missile system produces about 14,000
jobs, while $1 billion spent on educa
tion programs produces about 60,000
jobs.
Third, public investment in improv
ing our nation's decaying infrastructure
highways, roads, waterways, rail

roads, sewers is becoming increas
ingly recognized as both a necessary
and a job producing step. While re
building a crumbling America, millions
of the unemployed could be put back to
work. A good part of these expen
ditures would be financed off-budget,
through user fees. This third way to de
crease unemployment, in contrast to
the revenue-positive or revenue-neutral
first two options, would involve addi
tional federal expenditures. Much of
these could be financed, and financed
relatively painlessly, by delaying the
third year of the Kemp-Roth tax cut
a measure which results in revenue
losses of $33 billion in Fiscal Year 1984,
and progressively more in subsequent
years.
The United States should have a
strong commitment to full employment
the costs, both human and econom
ic, are too great for any other policy.
Reagan administration programs cur
rently run counter to that belief, a belief
which has its roots deep in the Ameri
can work ethic. It is time for those poli
cies to be replaced by some which are
more consistent with national values,
or, more likely, for the administration
to be replaced by another which shares
the conviction that if a man is willing,
he should not be denied a chance to
earn a decent living for himself and his
family.

the conviction that if a man is willing,
he should not be denied a chance to
earn a decent living for himself and his
family.

A year ago, President Reagan de
clared that "our economic program is
designed for the very purpose of creat
ing jobs ... Let us make our goal in this
program very clear jobs, jobs, jobs,
and more jobs." Candidate Reagan
said he was committed to full em
ployment (Columbus, Ohio, Aug. 27,
1980). And he swore not to use un
employment to cure inflation (N.Y.,
Aug. 5, 1980).
Reagan has broken his promises and
has failed the American people. Un
employment stands at the highest level
since the Great Depression. 10.1 per
cent of this nation's workers, over elev
en million men and women, are jobless.
Over six million more want to work full
time, but can only find part time jobs.
Nearly another two million are so dis
couraged that they have stopped active
ly seeking work altogether, and are not
officially counted in the ranks of the un
employed.
Apparently, Reagan has difficulty re
lating to the consequences of his failed
economic policies. He callously asked
on March 16, 1982, "It is news that
some fellow out in South Succotash
someplace has just been laid off that he
should be interviewed nationwide?"
Yes, it is news because that "fellow in
South Succotash" is representative of
11 million other unemployed victims of
the Republican recession.

Many share candidate Reagan's 1980
commitment to full employment. All
recent polls show that unemployment is
the one issue that most concerns the
American people. Regrettably, rather
than progressing toward full em
ployment, this administration's policies
have put nearly three and a half million
people out of work in the last 15
months.
The federal government has a re
sponsibility to serve as the employer of
last resort. In a nation which so reveres
the work ethic, no policy other than one
which provides jobs for all those wish
ihng to work is acceptable. It is a monu
mental waste of potential productivity
for this nation's factories to be operat
ing at less than 70 percent of capacity
the lowest level since the last Re
publican economic slump in 1975
while millions search for jobs. •
What, then, are the alternatives? To
combat unemployment, in the short
run, several measures, involving
progressively greater degrees of govern
ment involvement, should be enacted.
First, the federal government should
encourage business to enlarge its work
force by providing tax incentives to do
so. For each previously unemployed
worker added to a business's payroll,
without the consequent laying off of an
other worker, the government should
grant that business a tax credit, pro
vided the new employee has been un

employed at least three months. The
credit should be equal to the amount of
federal transfer payments the worker
received during the previous three
months and should be granted only if
the employee were kept on the payroll
for at least a half a year.
This proposal is a straight-forward
and actually revenue-positive means for
the United States to help the jobless
find meaningful employment. With a
minimum of federal interference, it in
duces business to hire the unemployed,
thereby decreasing unemployment and
increasing business production. The
drop in unemployment will cut govern
ment transfer payments and, because
these newly employed workers become
new taxpayers, it will increase govern
ment revenues a good first step
toward reducing both unemployment
and the federal budget deficit.
Second, unemployment could be re
duced by directing the allocation of
government funds from one, less job
productive, to another, more job pro
ductive, part of the budget. To il
lustrate, according to the Center for
Defense Information (and other groups
concur), a $1 billion spent on the MX
missile system produces about 14,000
jobs, while $1 billion spent on educa
tion programs produces about 60,000
jobs.
Third, public investment in improv
ing our nation's decaying infrastructure
highways, roads, waterways, rail

roads, sewers is becoming increas
ingly recognized as both a necessary
and a job producing step. While re
building a crumbling America, millions
of the unemployed could be put back to
work. A good part of these expen
ditures would be financed off-budget,
through user fees. This third way to de
crease unemployment, in contrast to
the revenue-positive or revenue-neutral
first two options, would involve addi
tional federal expenditures. Much of
these could be financed, and financed
relatively painlessly, by delaying the
third year of the Kemp-Roth tax cut
a measure which results in revenue
losses of $33 billion in Fiscal Year 1984,
and progressively more in subsequent
years.
The United States should have a
strong commitment to full employment
the costs, both human and econom
ic, are too great for any other policy.
Reagan administration programs cur
rently run counter to that belief, a belief
which has its roots deep in the Ameri
can work ethic. It is time for those poli
cies to be replaced by some which are
more consistent with national values,
or, more likely, for the administration
to be replaced by another which shares
the conviction that if a man is willing,
he should not be denied a chance to
earn a decent living for himself and his
family.
