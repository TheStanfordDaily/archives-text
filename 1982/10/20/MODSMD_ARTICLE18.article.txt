Twelve condominium units at Peter

Univ. names 2 new professors
Two new professors have been named to
the faculty here: Andrew Yao, computer sci
entist at UC-Berkeley, and Prof. Luis Caf
farelli of the Courant Institute of
Mathematical Sciences at New York Uni

Yao, named professor at Berkeley last
year, is a world leader in the application of
mathematics to the study of computer

models. He was an assistant professor at
Stanford during 1976-81, and he assumed
the present position as of Oct. 1, 1982. He is
the author of approximately 50 technical
publications. Born in Shanghai, China in
1946, he received his BA at National Taiwan
University, then a master and doctorate in
physics at Harvard in 1969 and 1972. He
then obtained a Ph.D in computer science at
the University of Illinois in 1975, and be
came an assistant professor at Massachu

year.
Prof. Caffarelli was born in Buenos Aires,
Argentina on Dec. 8, 1948. He received his
