## Cardinal travels to Hayward today Stanford booters blast Westmont for 10th win of year 
### JOHN KELLY 
The Stanford men's soccer
team rolled over Westmont Col
lege 5-2 Monday at Maloney
The Cardinal completely
dominated the Division II team
throughout the game and seemed
to score at will.
Stanford seemed sluggish at

the outset. After Westmont
scored twice, however, the
Cardinal turned aggressor and
relentlessly pounded the West
mont nets for five goals.
"We were outclassed, simply
outplayed," said Westmont
sweeper George Kuntz. "We're a
young, solid team, and we're just
learning to play with each other.

But Stanford was too strong.
They had too much depth all over
the field for us to handle. They
are a good team."
Again it was the Cardinal for
wards who led the way, sup
ported by strong play by the mid
fielders. Junior midfielder Walter
Kingson created early chances
with crisp one-touch passing and

effective ball distribution.
The first Cardinal goal was
scored by freshman Todd
Rafalovich. Taking a pass from
Jorge Titinger, Rafalovich broke
across the middle of the field,
dribbled by two men, and then
cracked an 18-yard shot into the
lower right corner of the goal.
Minutes later, Titinger hit
Giancarlo Ferruzzi with a cross
ing pass in front of the Westmont
goal. Ferruzzi moved around one
defender and cracked the second
goal into the net.
Seemingly satisfied with their
commanding lead, the Cardinal
began to slack off in their attack,
and Westmont responded with a
goal in the closing minutes of the
first half, making the score 2-1 at
halftime.
Stanford came out a different
team in the second half. West
mont pressed forward early, hop
ing to get the equalizing goal, but <
their long balls were easily con
tained by the Stanford defense,
and goalkeeper Willie Burkhardt
was not tested.
Once again the Stanford of
fense exploded for goals within
minutes of each other. The third
Cardinal goal was by Jorge Tit
inger. Taking a through pass
from Ferruzzi, he caught the
Westmont goalkeeper out of
goal, and chipped a shot over the
stunned goalie's head into the
net.
Stanford scored the fourth
goal on their next attack.
Sophomore midfielder Angel
Vazquez lofted a high corner kick
across the mouth of the goal to a
waiting Mark Talkington. Senior
defender Talkington jumped
high above the Westmont de
fense to head a strong shot into
the far corner of the goal, propell
ing the Cardinal into a 4-1 lead.
With minutes to go in the
game, sophomore striker Fred
Ueland followed through with
the final goal.
Westmont had embarrassed
the Cardinal 3-0 last year in San
ta Barbara. The Cardinal now
stands at 10-2-1 for the year.
Stanford plays at Cal-State Hay
-"/ard today and its next home
game is against St. Mary's Col
