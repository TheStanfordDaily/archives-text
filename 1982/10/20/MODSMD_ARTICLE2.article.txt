Sunnyvale Candidates for the 12th
Congressional District Democrat Em
mett Lynch and Republican Ed Zschau,
tried to outdo each other in showing
their support for the Social Securitysys
tem during a debate here last night.
Lynch, charged that the Republican
Party and the Reagan administration

do not have a real commitment to pre
serving the social security system.
"The Democratic Party has been the
party that initiated social security and
that has supported it," Lynch told the
audience composed largely of senior
citizens.
"It is absolutely necessary that this
nation make a commitment that we're
going to have a secure, viable Social Se
curity system in this country because we
believe the elderly people in this coun
try have the right to live a life of dignity
and respect. The priorities in our coun
try are all wrong."
Candidate Zschau distanced himself
from the Reagan adminstration Social
Security policies, calling its proposal for
cuts in Social Security two years ago

"not a well-thought out proposal."
"I think Reagan was responding to
the feeling that we had to do something
fast. But I don't think it was a well
thought out proposal," Zschau said.
"There's been a lot of campaign
rhetoric about Republicans gutting the
Social Security system. I would like to
see the Social Security issue de
politicized. We must protect the Social
Security system," he said
Zschau proposed inter-fund borrow
ing to help solve the system's financial
problems, but he did not rule out a
future tax increase.
Lynch did not make any specific pro
posals.
The debate on Social Security held at
the Plaza del Rey Mobile Home Park in
Sunnyvale, was sponsored by the
Golden State Mobile Homeowner's
League and mediated by the League of
Women's Voters.
Although Zschau's campaign has
raised a total of $576,000 while the
Lynch campaign has raised only
$55,000, two polls taken in late summer
show that the candidates are locked in a
tight race. A poll taken by the Lynch
campaign in late August and early Sep
tember showed Lynch leading Zcshau
38.9 percent to 35.9 percent with 25.2
perent undecided.
A poll taken by De
cision/Making/Information of Santa
Ana in July showed Zschau leading
Lynch 34 percent to 27 percent. The

Libertarian candidate William White
garnered 10 percent of the support of
the voters polled while 29 percent of the
voters were undecided.
Republicans have counted on a GOP
victory in the predominately Re
publican district.
Starting from San Francisco's
wealthiest suburb, Hillsborough, in San
Mateo County, the district moves south
through Woodside down through
Silicon valley, around Palo Alto, and
down to Sunnyvale. The district then
jumps east across the Coast Range into
Stanislaus County, carefully avoiding
the heavily Democratic constituencies

of San Jose and Modesto.
Zschau recieved his B.A. from
Princeton and an M.S. and
Ph.D. from Stanford and served as an
assistant professor at the Graduate
School of Business here for four years.
In 1968, Zschau founded System In
dustries in Milpitas, which has grown
into one of the world's largest computer
disk storage companies. He recently
served as co-chairman on the Business
Advisory Panel for President Reagan.
Lynch, 52, is a long time resident of
the area and has served as an adminis
trator for the Newark Unified School
District.
