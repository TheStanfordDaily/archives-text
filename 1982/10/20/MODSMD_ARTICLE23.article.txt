# Sutton chased early
## Cards even 'suds' series at three 
### Associated Press 
St. Louis Keith Hernandez drove in four runs and rookie John
Stuper sat through 2 V 2 hours of pouring rain last night before complet
ing a four-hitter that gave the St. Louis Cardinals a 13-1 victory over
the Milwaukee Brewers and forced a decisive seventh game in the
World Series.
Baseball's 79th championship, a match of two Midwestern beer
towns, will be decided tonight with Joaquin Andujar pitching for the
Cardinals and Pete Vuckovich for the Brewers in a rematch of Game
3, won 6-2 by St. Louis.
The Cardinals struck quickly last night and capped the rout with six
runs in the sixth inning.
Only one run had scored in that inning when rain forced the second
delay in the game, lasting two hours, 13 minutes. Hernandez, who hit a
two-run homer in the fifth, drove in two more with a single in the sixth.
Darrell Porter also hit a two-run homer for St. Louis and designated
hitter Dane lorg set a Series record with three extra-base hits as the
Cardinals unleashed an uncharacteristic power display that buried the
American League champs and starter Don Sutton.
Stuper lost his chance for just the fifth shutout in World Series his
tory by a rookie and the first since 1948 when Jim Gantner
doubled in the ninth, went to third on a single by Paul Molitor and
scored on a wild pitch.
The Brewers had 53 hits in the first five games, but none between the
fourth and ninth innings.
The rain fell lightly in the second inning, a little harder in the fourth
and hard enough in the fifth to force the first delay, that of 26 minutes.
By that time, Sutton was out of the game. When the rain forced the
second postponement, the Brewers were out of it, too.
Sutton, a National Leaguer before joining the Brewers last Aug. 31,
has not beaten the Cardinals at Busch Stadium for six years. This time,
he lasted just 4 I A innings, giving up seven runs on seven hits. Two of
the runs were unearned as the Brewers, who committed seven errors in
the first five games of the Series, had two more in the first three in
nings.
The Cardinals, meanwhile, were playing the unaccustomed role of
long-ball hitters.
Porter's homer in the fourth inning and Hernandez's shot in the
fifth marked only the ninth time this year that St. Louis, whose 67
homers during the regular season were the fewest in the major leagues,
had more than one in a game. One of those was Game 3, when rookie
Willie McGee hit two in the Cardinals' 6-2 victory.
Stuper, who didn't join the Cardinals until May 28, was almost un
hittable, walking just one and striking out two while giving up singles
to Ben Oglivie in the second and Charlie Moore in the third before the
rain came.
After Moore's single, Stuper retired the next 15 Brewers before
Gorman Thomas was safe in the eighth when third baseman Ken
Oberkfell's throw pulled Hernandez off the bag at first.
Sutton, who has a 7-14 career record at Busch Stadium and has not
won here since Sept. 11,1976, was able to retire the Cardinals in order
only in the first inning.
Things came unraveled after that.
With two out in the second, lorg, playing in the fourth Series using
the DH rule on an every-other-year basis, doubled into the left-field
corner. The ball hit Oglivie's glove in fair territory, then caromed into
the fence in foul territory.
McGee followed with what looked like a routine grounder to short
stop Robin Yount, but Yount the hero of Milwaukee's victory in
Game 5 Sunday let the ball skip through his legs for an error as lorg
scored.
Tom Herr, with just one hit in 19 previous at-bats in the Series, then
lined a double off the wall in right field. Moore's throw from right
nearly nailed McGee at the plate as he loped around the bases, ap
parently thinking Herr's ball would be out of the park.
If Milwaukee catcher Ted Simmons had handled the throw, McGee
would have been out. But Simmons didn't and McGee scored the sec

ond unearned run of the inning.
An error by Gantner, the Brewers' second baseman, nearly opened
the door for another run in the third inning. Lonnie Smith led off the
inning with a slow roller past Sutton, between first baseman Cecil Co
oper and Gantner. Cooper couldn't get to the ball and Gantner, ap
parently trying to rush the play when the speedy Smith heading
toward first, bobbled it.
Smith stole second easily and Oberkfell popped out. Smith ad
vanced to third on a grounder to second by Hernandez, and thÂ£
brought George Hendrick up to face Sutton.
With a 1-1 count on Hendrick and pitching from a full windup, Sut
ton seemed easy prey. Smith took off for home and was halfway there
when Sutton released the pitch. But umpire Jim Evans called Smith
out, although television replays apparently showed he had beaten the
tag.
That play became academic in the fourth inning when the Cardinals
added three more runs.
Hendrick led off with a single up the middle and Sutton balked him
to second, failing to make the required pause in his motion. Porter,
who had 12 homers during the season, hit Sutton's next pitch for ja
home run off the facade in right field.
lorg followed with a triple down the right-field line and one out lateji
Herr laid down a perfect squeeze bunt. Sutton threw Herr out at
but lorg scored easily as a flash of lightning cut through the sky and
the rain began to fall more heavily.
The rain was still falling and the game official when Lonnie Smith
led off the bottom of the fifth inning with a single. It would be his last
at-bat; he had jammed a finger on his left hand sliding into second in
the third inning and when Hernandez homered one out later, Manager
Whitey Herzog had the luxury of replacing Smith in left field with
David Green.
Hernandez, who had only seven homers during the season and did
not break out of a post-season slump until Game 5, hit a 1-2 Suttofa
pitch into the tunnel behind the right-center field fence.
The ball traveled at least 400 feet, and Milwaukee manager Harvey
Kuenn had seen enough of Sutton for one evening.
As Jim Slaton headed for the mound to take Sutton's place, the
skies opened, forcing a 26-minute delay in the game.
The wait did not bother the Cardinals.
Slaton got the final two outs of the fifth easily, but lorg led off the
bottom of the sixth against Doc Medich, Milwaukee's third pitcher,
with his second double of the night. lorg took third when Medich un
leashed a wild pitch and McGee grounded a single through the right
side of the infield to score lorg. Herr followed with a bloop singltfto
center that sent McGee to second, and Medich's second wild pitch of
the innings allowed both runners to advance.
With the second wild pitch, Medich tied two Series records. He was
the first man since James Carlton of the Chicago Cubs in 1938 and the
fifth overall to throw two wild pitches in an inning, and the two err|nt
throws matched a single-game record previously tied in Game 2;by
Stuper. That mark is shared by seven others.
Medich retired Ozzie Smith on a grounder to first and, with Green
at bat, the game was interrupted again for another 2 hours, 13 minutes
by rain.
"We're going to play this game until it's completed," Kuhn,
ing a hat and a raincoat and holding an umbrella, said during the de
lay, "even if we have to wait a great many more hours."
For all intents and purposes, though, it already was over for the
Brewers.
When the game resumed, only about 18,000 of the original of
53,723 were remaining.

doubled in the ninth, went to third on a single by Paul Molitor and
scored on a wild pitch.
The Brewers had 53 hits in the first five games, but none between the
fourth and ninth innings.
The rain fell lightly in the second inning, a little harder in the fourth
and hard enough in the fifth to force the first delay, that of 26 minutes.
By that time, Sutton was out of the game. When the rain forced the
second postponement, the Brewers were out of it, too.
Sutton, a National Leaguer before joining the Brewers last Aug. 31,
has not beaten the Cardinals at Busch Stadium for six years. This time,
he lasted just 4 I A innings, giving up seven runs on seven hits. Two of
the runs were unearned as the Brewers, who committed seven errors in
the first five games of the Series, had two more in the first three in
nings.
The Cardinals, meanwhile, were playing the unaccustomed role of
long-ball hitters.
Porter's homer in the fourth inning and Hernandez's shot in the
fifth marked only the ninth time this year that St. Louis, whose 67
homers during the regular season were the fewest in the major leagues,
had more than one in a game. One of those was Game 3, when rookie
Willie McGee hit two in the Cardinals' 6-2 victory.
Stuper, who didn't join the Cardinals until May 28, was almost un
hittable, walking just one and striking out two while giving up singles
to Ben Oglivie in the second and Charlie Moore in the third before the
rain came.
After Moore's single, Stuper retired the next 15 Brewers before
Gorman Thomas was safe in the eighth when third baseman Ken
Oberkfell's throw pulled Hernandez off the bag at first.
Sutton, who has a 7-14 career record at Busch Stadium and has not
won here since Sept. 11,1976, was able to retire the Cardinals in order
only in the first inning.
Things came unraveled after that.
With two out in the second, lorg, playing in the fourth Series using
the DH rule on an every-other-year basis, doubled into the left-field
corner. The ball hit Oglivie's glove in fair territory, then caromed into
the fence in foul territory.
McGee followed with what looked like a routine grounder to short
stop Robin Yount, but Yount the hero of Milwaukee's victory in
Game 5 Sunday let the ball skip through his legs for an error as lorg
scored.
Tom Herr, with just one hit in 19 previous at-bats in the Series, then
lined a double off the wall in right field. Moore's throw from right
nearly nailed McGee at the plate as he loped around the bases, ap
parently thinking Herr's ball would be out of the park.
If Milwaukee catcher Ted Simmons had handled the throw, McGee
would have been out. But Simmons didn't and McGee scored the sec

ond unearned run of the inning.
An error by Gantner, the Brewers' second baseman, nearly opened
the door for another run in the third inning. Lonnie Smith led off the
inning with a slow roller past Sutton, between first baseman Cecil Co
oper and Gantner. Cooper couldn't get to the ball and Gantner, ap
parently trying to rush the play when the speedy Smith heading
toward first, bobbled it.
Smith stole second easily and Oberkfell popped out. Smith ad
vanced to third on a grounder to second by Hernandez, and thÂ£
brought George Hendrick up to face Sutton.
With a 1-1 count on Hendrick and pitching from a full windup, Sut
ton seemed easy prey. Smith took off for home and was halfway there
when Sutton released the pitch. But umpire Jim Evans called Smith
out, although television replays apparently showed he had beaten the
tag.
That play became academic in the fourth inning when the Cardinals
added three more runs.
Hendrick led off with a single up the middle and Sutton balked him
to second, failing to make the required pause in his motion. Porter,
who had 12 homers during the season, hit Sutton's next pitch for ja
home run off the facade in right field.
lorg followed with a triple down the right-field line and one out lateji
Herr laid down a perfect squeeze bunt. Sutton threw Herr out at
but lorg scored easily as a flash of lightning cut through the sky and
the rain began to fall more heavily.
The rain was still falling and the game official when Lonnie Smith
led off the bottom of the fifth inning with a single. It would be his last
at-bat; he had jammed a finger on his left hand sliding into second in
the third inning and when Hernandez homered one out later, Manager
Whitey Herzog had the luxury of replacing Smith in left field with
David Green.
Hernandez, who had only seven homers during the season and did
not break out of a post-season slump until Game 5, hit a 1-2 Suttofa
pitch into the tunnel behind the right-center field fence.
The ball traveled at least 400 feet, and Milwaukee manager Harvey
Kuenn had seen enough of Sutton for one evening.
As Jim Slaton headed for the mound to take Sutton's place, the
skies opened, forcing a 26-minute delay in the game.
The wait did not bother the Cardinals.
Slaton got the final two outs of the fifth easily, but lorg led off the
bottom of the sixth against Doc Medich, Milwaukee's third pitcher,
with his second double of the night. lorg took third when Medich un
leashed a wild pitch and McGee grounded a single through the right
side of the infield to score lorg. Herr followed with a bloop singltfto
center that sent McGee to second, and Medich's second wild pitch of
the innings allowed both runners to advance.
With the second wild pitch, Medich tied two Series records. He was
the first man since James Carlton of the Chicago Cubs in 1938 and the
fifth overall to throw two wild pitches in an inning, and the two err|nt
throws matched a single-game record previously tied in Game 2;by
Stuper. That mark is shared by seven others.
Medich retired Ozzie Smith on a grounder to first and, with Green
at bat, the game was interrupted again for another 2 hours, 13 minutes
by rain.
"We're going to play this game until it's completed," Kuhn,
ing a hat and a raincoat and holding an umbrella, said during the de
lay, "even if we have to wait a great many more hours."
For all intents and purposes, though, it already was over for the
Brewers.
When the game resumed, only about 18,000 of the original of
53,723 were remaining.
St. Louis Keith Hernandez drove in four runs and rookie John
Stuper sat through 2 V 2 hours of pouring rain last night before complet
ing a four-hitter that gave the St. Louis Cardinals a 13-1 victory over
the Milwaukee Brewers and forced a decisive seventh game in the
World Series.
Baseball's 79th championship, a match of two Midwestern beer
towns, will be decided tonight with Joaquin Andujar pitching for the
Cardinals and Pete Vuckovich for the Brewers in a rematch of Game
3, won 6-2 by St. Louis.
The Cardinals struck quickly last night and capped the rout with six
runs in the sixth inning.
Only one run had scored in that inning when rain forced the second
delay in the game, lasting two hours, 13 minutes. Hernandez, who hit a
two-run homer in the fifth, drove in two more with a single in the sixth.
Darrell Porter also hit a two-run homer for St. Louis and designated
hitter Dane lorg set a Series record with three extra-base hits as the
Cardinals unleashed an uncharacteristic power display that buried the
American League champs and starter Don Sutton.

Willie McGee hit two in the Cardinals' 6-2 victory.
Stuper, who didn't join the Cardinals until May 28, was almost un
hittable, walking just one and striking out two while giving up singles
to Ben Oglivie in the second and Charlie Moore in the third before the
rain came.
After Moore's single, Stuper retired the next 15 Brewers before
Gorman Thomas was safe in the eighth when third baseman Ken
Oberkfell's throw pulled Hernandez off the bag at first.
Sutton, who has a 7-14 career record at Busch Stadium and has not
won here since Sept. 11,1976, was able to retire the Cardinals in order
only in the first inning.
Things came unraveled after that.
With two out in the second, lorg, playing in the fourth Series using
the DH rule on an every-other-year basis, doubled into the left-field
corner. The ball hit Oglivie's glove in fair territory, then caromed into
the fence in foul territory.
McGee followed with what looked like a routine grounder to short
stop Robin Yount, but Yount the hero of Milwaukee's victory in
Game 5 Sunday let the ball skip through his legs for an error as lorg
scored.
Tom Herr, with just one hit in 19 previous at-bats in the Series, then
lined a double off the wall in right field. Moore's throw from right
nearly nailed McGee at the plate as he loped around the bases, ap
parently thinking Herr's ball would be out of the park.
If Milwaukee catcher Ted Simmons had handled the throw, McGee
would have been out. But Simmons didn't and McGee scored the sec

ond unearned run of the inning.
An error by Gantner, the Brewers' second baseman, nearly opened
the door for another run in the third inning. Lonnie Smith led off the
inning with a slow roller past Sutton, between first baseman Cecil Co
oper and Gantner. Cooper couldn't get to the ball and Gantner, ap
parently trying to rush the play when the speedy Smith heading
toward first, bobbled it.
Smith stole second easily and Oberkfell popped out. Smith ad
vanced to third on a grounder to second by Hernandez, and thÂ£
brought George Hendrick up to face Sutton.
With a 1-1 count on Hendrick and pitching from a full windup, Sut
ton seemed easy prey. Smith took off for home and was halfway there
when Sutton released the pitch. But umpire Jim Evans called Smith
out, although television replays apparently showed he had beaten the
tag.
That play became academic in the fourth inning when the Cardinals
added three more runs.
Hendrick led off with a single up the middle and Sutton balked him
to second, failing to make the required pause in his motion. Porter,
who had 12 homers during the season, hit Sutton's next pitch for ja
home run off the facade in right field.
lorg followed with a triple down the right-field line and one out lateji
Herr laid down a perfect squeeze bunt. Sutton threw Herr out at
but lorg scored easily as a flash of lightning cut through the sky and
the rain began to fall more heavily.
The rain was still falling and the game official when Lonnie Smith
led off the bottom of the fifth inning with a single. It would be his last
at-bat; he had jammed a finger on his left hand sliding into second in
the third inning and when Hernandez homered one out later, Manager
Whitey Herzog had the luxury of replacing Smith in left field with
David Green.
Hernandez, who had only seven homers during the season and did
not break out of a post-season slump until Game 5, hit a 1-2 Suttofa
pitch into the tunnel behind the right-center field fence.
The ball traveled at least 400 feet, and Milwaukee manager Harvey
Kuenn had seen enough of Sutton for one evening.
As Jim Slaton headed for the mound to take Sutton's place, the
skies opened, forcing a 26-minute delay in the game.
The wait did not bother the Cardinals.
Slaton got the final two outs of the fifth easily, but lorg led off the
bottom of the sixth against Doc Medich, Milwaukee's third pitcher,
with his second double of the night. lorg took third when Medich un
leashed a wild pitch and McGee grounded a single through the right
side of the infield to score lorg. Herr followed with a bloop singltfto
center that sent McGee to second, and Medich's second wild pitch of
the innings allowed both runners to advance.
With the second wild pitch, Medich tied two Series records. He was
the first man since James Carlton of the Chicago Cubs in 1938 and the
fifth overall to throw two wild pitches in an inning, and the two err|nt
throws matched a single-game record previously tied in Game 2;by
Stuper. That mark is shared by seven others.
Medich retired Ozzie Smith on a grounder to first and, with Green
at bat, the game was interrupted again for another 2 hours, 13 minutes
by rain.
"We're going to play this game until it's completed," Kuhn,
ing a hat and a raincoat and holding an umbrella, said during the de
lay, "even if we have to wait a great many more hours."
For all intents and purposes, though, it already was over for the
Brewers.
When the game resumed, only about 18,000 of the original of
53,723 were remaining.
