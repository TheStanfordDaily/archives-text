### Associated Press 
Cockeysville, Md. Mediator Sam Kagel said yesterday nego
tiators in the National Football League players' strike have entered
into serious discussions of economic issues. Meanwhile, the NFL
called off football games for the fifth weekend since the walkout
began.
"We are negotiating and mediating all of the economic issues in
great depth," Kagel said. "It is a serious discussion of the respective
positions of the parties on each of the issues constituting the total eco
nomic package."
Meanwhile in New York, a league spokesman said "Because of the
players strike no National Football League games will be played this
weekend, Oct. 24-25. With five weekends of games not played thus far
in the 16-week, 1982 regular season, and in view of previous
statements that a maximum of two weekends games could be made up,
at least three weekends of games have now been lost for the season."
A member of the management council's negotiating team was
quoted as saying there had been no difference between the morning
and afternoon negotiating sessions. "We're still at loggerheads, we're
still butting heads, we're not getting anywhere," he told another man
agement source.
Negotiators met for nearly three hours yesterday morning to dis
cuss the economic issues which led to the first inseason strike in the
league's 63-year history.
In attendance were Jack Donlan, the management council's ex
ecutive director; Sargent Karch, the owners' chief counsel; union pres
ident Gene Upshaw, union chief Ed Garvey and John Bunting of the
Philadelphia Eagles and Stan White of the Detroit Lions, members of
the union's executive committee.
