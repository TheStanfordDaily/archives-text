### Associated Press 
Oakland, Calif. The In
vaders of the fledgling U.S.
Football League hre doing
their best to capitalize on the
flight of the National Foot
ball League's Raiders from
Oakland.
The Invaders announced
yesterday they have signed a
lease to play nine games next
spring in the Oakland Col
iseum, the house abandoned
by the Raiders when they
moved south to the Los An
geles Coliseum this year.
The team also announced
they have changed their name
to the Oakland Invaders.
They originally called them
selves the Bay Area Invaders.
And to give local fans some
of the old team spirit, the In

vaders announced the signing
of their first player veteran
defensive end Cedrick Hard
man, who played for the
Raiders the last two seasons
and the San Francisco 49ers
for 10 years before that.
The six-foot-four, 245-
pound Hardman, who turned
34 two weeks ago, will also act
as an assistant defensive
coach for head coach John
Ralston.
Hardman was the Raider's
top draft choice in 1970 out of
North Texas State. He was
named to the NFL's Pro Bowl
in 1971 and 1975 and was
traded to the Raiders in 1980
for two draft choices.
The USFL's first season is
scheduled to run from early
March to the end of July.
