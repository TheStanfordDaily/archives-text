# Univ. officials examine cable system options
## 
### DAN TURNER 
Members of the University Steering
Commitee for a proposed cable TV sys
tem here are closely following develop
ments in the Palo Alto City Council re
garding this issue before they recom
mend how a cable system at the Univer
sity should be set up. 4P
The cable system, which would pro
vide a variety of services to members of
the Stanford community, is still a mat
ter of considerable uncertainty among
both University officials and City
Council members. Though neither
group has made a commitment to the
other, both sides hope that a mutually
acceptable agreement can be made to
integrate the new system between both
comrhunities.
One of the primary topics of concern
at this point is the question of owm
ership. w
"During the summer Palo Alto came
close to bidding for municipal own
ership of the system," said Associate
Provost and Steering Committee head
Michael Oman. "Lately they've backed
off of this position and are looking at
private companies," he added.
Which of these two concepts is the
most feasible is still unknown. The Uni
versity itself has three options in this
matter, according to a task force report
which was prepared by the committee
and published in Campus Report on
June 30 of this year.
First, the University could build and
operate a complete cable system on
own. While this alternative gives Sta™
ford the advantage of total control, the
task force report added that the disad
vantages of this possibility override the
benefits. Legal obstacles, financial risk,
and management problems are cited as
major difficulties with this option.
Second, a contractual agreement
could be made with a commercial cable
company to supply the University with
a private system. Although some com
panies have expressed interest in this
proposal, Oman said it is too early to
decide upon the feasibility of this ap
proach.
"In part, they (the cable companies)
are pretty interested in what happens in
Palo Alto too. .. At least some of the
companies we've talked to are
terested in a Stanford-Palo Alto agree
ment because this would create a bigger
market," Oman said.
The third and most convenient op
tion, according to the report, would be
to contract for services with one of the
neighboring municipalities, Palo Alto
being the most appropriate because of
its size and the number of Stanford stu
dents, faculty, and staff living there.
This arrangement would spare the
University the cost of building a system,
provide an attractive business
portunity for local cable companies,
and add variety and depth to Palo
Alto's system, the report concluded.
The University cannot reach a de
cision on this matter, according to "the
report, until the Palo Alto City Council
comes to its own conclusions and
adopts whichever alternative it feels is
most appropriate. Meanwhile, the com
mittee will continue to examine the situ
ation and to wait for a definite resolu
tion.
