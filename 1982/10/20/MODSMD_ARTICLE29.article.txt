No matter how many different
restaurants you may try, there
will always be a few that are truly
memorable restaurants that
you want to go back to again and
again. You may be attracted to
certain restaurants for many dif
ferent reasons, but the one thing
that is common to every "special
restaurant" is that following the
meal, you will be thoroughly re
laxed and satisfied. La Gu
inguette in Redwood City is one
of these special places. I felt so
wonderful after my dinner that I
didn't want to leave. The only
reason I left was that I was told
that another helping of raspberry
sherbert was waiting for me in the
car, but that's getting ahead of
the story let's start from the
beginning.
La Guingette, a "roadside
inn," is a little bit off the beaten
track tucked away in a small
shopping area off of Woodside
Road. When you arrive at their
rather inconspicuous entrance,
you might not believe that it is a
restaurant. However, once you
open their door, all of your suspi
cions Will vanish.
The \vood-latticed entrance
divides the restaurant into two
charming dining rooms. - Both
rooms are very nice, although I
prefer the room off to the right
rather than the main dining room
because it is a little more intimate
and cozy. The walls of the smaller

room are adorned with pretty,
gold-veined mirrors and soft,
flowered wallpaper. The tables
are fairly close together but they
are angled in such away that you
hardly notice anyone else.
Besides, the flowers and the indi
vidual candles on each table
create such a romantic at
mosphere that you won't see any
one except the person sitting next
to you at your table. If, at this
point you haven't been overcome
by the charm of this restaurant,
just place your order and prepare
yourself for the main event.
There is an old adage in my
family that says: You can judge
the quality of a restaurant by its
soup and salad once again it
has been proven right, the Soup
du Jour was a cream of broccoli
that was so tasty that I forgot my
manners and licked the bowl just
so I wouldn't waste a drop. It was
very flavorful, but in a nice deli
cate manner, not overpowering.
The salad was a perfect example
of a good French salad the
right balance of oil and vinegar
sprinkled on top of a flavorful
bed of butter lettuce. Fan
tastique! However, the soup and
salad merely set the stage for the
piece de resistance the entree.
The entrees are the artistic
creations of Chef Raoul a soft
spoken Frenchman from
Avignon. I would especially rec
ommend his fish special ($11.50)
you can't go wrong no matter
what it may be. The night I was
there, the special was a
marvelous salmon fillet stuffed

with crab, based in a pastry puff,
and served with a lobster sauce.
Everything was prepared to per
fection. The salmon was fresh
and flavorful, and it was wonder
fully complemented by the crab
and a white fish sauce. The
lobster sauce was beyond de
scription, while the pastry puff
was both light and flaky What
a knockout!
If you happen to be a hearty
meat eater, don't panic, there's
something for you too Tour
nedos Bourdelaise ($13.50). The
tournedos are two succulent
pieces of tenderloin served in a
brown sauce made with red wine
and shallots. The superior quali
ty of the beef combined with the
strong flavoring of the shallots
makes this dish something which
cannot be ignored.
Other entrees include a rack of
baby lamb served in herbs and a
red wine sauce ($14.00), Canard a
l'Orange ($11.50) a young
roast duckling flamed in an or
ange sauce, and Lapin a la
Provencale ($9.75) fresh rab
bit sauteed with herbs,
mushrooms, and white wine. All
of the entrees include the soup,
salad and four servings of various
crisp, cooked vegetables which
were all elegantly arranged upon
our plates.
I have to admit it, I was bad the
night I went here I had four
desserts. 1 have never tried Profit
erolles au Chocolat ($3.00), but
boy am I sorry that I haven't.
They consist of two springy
cream puffs filled with vanilla ice
cream and smothered in choco
late simple but outstanding!
The Mousse au Chocolat ($2.00)

is a tasty but not overly exciting
velvet mousse: If you are lucky
enough to be there on a night
when they are serving some of
Raoul's famous, fresh sherberts,
be sure to order at least one serv
ing provided that you haven't
already collapsed from overeat
ing. I had two helpings. The
raspberry sherbert is better than
a bowl of fresh raspberries, and
the lemon sherbert tastes like
lemons off a tree.
The service at La Guinguette
was, at first, quite rushed, but af
ter a while things quieted down
and we enjoyed a leisurely din
ner. The wine list has a good
selection of both foreign and
domestic wines, all at reasonable
prices.

La Guinguette is a hidden gold
mine. It is a casual, intimate res
taurant that is devoted to serving
exceptional quality food at very
reasonable prices. You may not
receive all the pomp and pamper
ing that you get at fancy French
restaurants in the city, but the
food surely ranks with the best of
them. La Giunguette is elegant in
a simple and subtle way. How
ever, I made one mistake. I was
lured out of the restaurant by the
offer of enjoying another taste of
that raspberry sherbert in the car.
If you are smart, you will stay
right where you are and in an
hour or so you should start all
over again. Never enough of a
good thing, I always say!
