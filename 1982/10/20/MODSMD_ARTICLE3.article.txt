Gemayel requests more forces
Washington — Lebanese President Amin Gemayel yesterday suggested
expanding the multinational peace-keeping force now in West Beirut and
sending it to other parts of Lebanon to expedite the withdrawal of Israeli,
Syrian, and Palestine Liberation Organization troops from the war-torn
country.
The 40-year-old president, here seeking economic and military aid plus
help in ridding his country of foreign troops, raised the subject in meetings
with President Reagan and Secretary of State George Shultz. He did not sub
mit details of where and how an expanded international force would be used,
nor did he ask the United States to send more Marines into Lebanon.
But a senior U.S. official who attended the meetings, and who briefed re
porters on condition that he not be identified, said Reagan had told Gemayel
that the United States would give "serious consideration" to expanding the
multinational force, now composed of 1200 U.S. Marines, 1450 Italian
troops and 1600 French troops. The three-nation force, which had overseen
the withdrawal of PLO guerillas from West Beirut, was sent back into the
city to provide security after the massacre of Palestinian refugees in mid-Sep
tember. The success of the force in West Beirut was said to have caused
Gemayel to suggest broadening its role in the country as efforts are made to
remove all foreign forces from Lebanon.
When the Lebanese president suggested that an enlarged multinational
force might help Lebanon through the withdrawal of foreign forces, Presi
dent Reagan reportedly replied, "We appreciate that our troops are so well
received, and you believe they are so important, and that all of these matters
will have to be given serious consideration."
A State Department official, who spoke with reporters under ground rules
that precluded his identification, said that while the United States has a goal
of seeing all foreign troops out of Lebanon by year's end, there is, never
theless, a realization that "we are at the beginning of a very complicated and
difficult process."
The meetings with Reagan, Shultz and rankirig foreign policy officials did
clarify the picture sufficiently that another meeting probably will be held lat
er in the week with Israeli Foreign Minister Yitzhak Shamir.
The State Department official who discussed the Reagan-Gemayel meet
ings said special U.S. envoy Morris Draper would probably meet with
Shamir in New York and then return to the Mideast to continue efforts
toward the withdrawal of foreign forces from Lebanon. Draper "will not
have a set-piece plan, but will have guidelines" for a withdrawal strategy, the
official said.
The next step will be to confer with the Syrian government, and to bring
the PLO into the negotiations through contacts with either the Syrians or the
Lebanese, the State Department official said. He emphasized that there
would be no direct U.S. contact with the PLO.
For now, the official said, the Reagan administration is being guided by
the Lebanese government's assessment of what is possible in resolving the
situation.
