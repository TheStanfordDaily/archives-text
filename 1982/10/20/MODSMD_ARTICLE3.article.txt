Gemayel requests more forces
Washington — Lebanese President Amin Gemayel yesterday suggested
expanding the multinational peace-keeping force now in West Beirut and
sending it to other parts of Lebanon to expedite the withdrawal of Israeli,
Syrian, and Palestine Liberation Organization troops from the war-torn
country.
The 40-year-old president, here seeking economic and military aid plus
help in ridding his country of foreign troops, raised the subject in meetings
with President Reagan and Secretary of State George Shultz. He did not sub
mit details of where and how an expanded international force would be used,
nor did he ask the United States to send more Marines into Lebanon.
But a senior U.S. official who attended the meetings, and who briefed re
porters on condition that he not be identified, said Reagan had told Gemayel
that the United States would give "serious consideration" to expanding the
multinational force, now composed of 1200 U.S. Marines, 1450 Italian
troops and 1600 French troops. The three-nation force, which had overseen
the withdrawal of PLO guerillas from West Beirut, was sent back into the
city to provide security after the massacre of Palestinian refugees in mid-Sep
tember. The success of the force in West Beirut was said to have caused
Gemayel to suggest broadening its role in the country as efforts are made to
remove all foreign forces from Lebanon.
When the Lebanese president suggested that an enlarged multinational
force might help Lebanon through the withdrawal of foreign forces, Presi
dent Reagan reportedly replied, "We appreciate that our troops are so well
received, and you believe they are so important, and that all of these matters
will have to be given serious consideration."
A State Department official, who spoke with reporters under ground rules
that precluded his identification, said that while the United States has a goal
of seeing all foreign troops out of Lebanon by year's end, there is, never
theless, a realization that "we are at the beginning of a very complicated and
difficult process."
The meetings with Reagan, Shultz and rankirig foreign policy officials did
clarify the picture sufficiently that another meeting probably will be held lat
er in the week with Israeli Foreign Minister Yitzhak Shamir.
The State Department official who discussed the Reagan-Gemayel meet
ings said special U.S. envoy Morris Draper would probably meet with
Shamir in New York and then return to the Mideast to continue efforts
toward the withdrawal of foreign forces from Lebanon. Draper "will not
have a set-piece plan, but will have guidelines" for a withdrawal strategy, the
official said.
The next step will be to confer with the Syrian government, and to bring
the PLO into the negotiations through contacts with either the Syrians or the
Lebanese, the State Department official said. He emphasized that there
would be no direct U.S. contact with the PLO.
For now, the official said, the Reagan administration is being guided by
the Lebanese government's assessment of what is possible in resolving the
situation.
Sri Lanka holds election
Colombo, Sri Lanka An estimated 8 mil
lion voters in this once socialist-oriented island
in the Indian Ocean will put to a test today the
question of whether a Western-style, free
wheeling, capitalist economic system can work
in the Third World.
In Sri Lanka's first presidential election,
President Junius Jayewardene, who five years
ago rewrote the constitution and elevated
himself to an executive presidency, is asking
voters to continue, amid spiraling inflation and
an overheated economy, the Reaganesque,
market-oriented, supply-side policies he has
resolutely pursued.
He is considered to have a slight edge over
Freedom Party candidate Hector Kob
bekaduwa, a stand-in for former Prime Min
ister Mrs. Sirimavo Bandaranaike, but the
balloting could be so close that the results
would hinge on a complicated second-prefer
ence tallying system.
Anticipating an outbreak of the kind of vio
lence that traditionally accompanies Sri
Lankan elections, Jayewardene has deployed
army troops and security forces throughout
the island and has made plans to protectively
impose emergency restrictions the day after the
balloting. Such emergencies are usually de
clared after elections.
Closely following the election are Sri
Lanka's Western benefactors, particularly the
United States, which with $lOO million a year
provides the island with more U.S. assistance
per capita than any other country in Asia. To
tal economic assistance from the West is nearly
$1 billion annually.
The Reagan administration has lavished
praise on the free-wheeling market-oriented
economic system fashioned by Jayewardene
who once was derisively referred to by social
ists as "Yankee Dickie" and has regarded it
as a model for economic development in the
Third World.
But Sri Lankans have turned out of office ev
ery incumbent government that has run for re
election, and there has been a stirring of feeling
among many voters that Jayewardene's high
caste segment of the country's 15 million peo
ple has exacerbated economic disparity and
fostered corruption on a large scale.
Income and spending increase
Washington Americans' personal income
rose a modest 0.3 percent in September, the
government reported yesterday. But in a more
encouraging sign, their spending jumped three
times that fast.
The 1 percent September gain in personal
consumption spending the third healthy in
crease in a row was welcomed by both gov
ernment and private economists. But they dis
agreed on whether it meant recovery from the
recession was at hand.
There was nothing but good news in a sepa
rate Commerce Department report that
showed housing starts rising 14.4 percent in
September to an annual rate of 1.1 million.
Economists said falling interest rates had led
to recent improvement in the beleaguered
housing industry that was likely to continue.
"As a result, growth in home-building ap
pears likely to assume its customary leading
role in the economic recovery," said Com
merce Undersecretary Robert Dederick.
At the White House, President Reagan's
signing of a National Housing Week pro
clamation coincided with the release of the
housing report. "These are the days of new
hope for housing, hope for millions of families
that dream of owning homes and hope for mil
lions who make their livelihoods from building
them,'" he said.
The bad news in the Commerce Depart
ment's September income report was that U.S.
workers' total wages and salaries declined

about $4OO million below August's level, led by
a $3.2 billion drop in manufacturing payrolls.
Rising unemployment to 10.1 percent of
the labor force, according to an earlier report
was one big reason for the decline, the new
report said. "The payroll declines were mostly
in the durable goods industries," including
producers of motor vehicles, machinery and
metals, it said.
Outweighing the wage declines were a $2.8
billion increase in government transfer
payments, which include unemployment bene
fits, and a $2.7 billion increase in interest and
dividend income.
In all, the report said, total personal income
rose to an annual rate of $2.6 trillion in Sep
tember while personal consumption spending
rose to a rate of $2.01 trillion. Disposable, or
after-tax, income, rose 0.3 percent to a rate of
$2.21 trillion.
Economists have been saying for months
that the best hope for recovery lay in increased
spending that could in turn spur new produc
tion and the hiring back of laid-off workers.
National crime rate drops
Washington The number of crimes re
ported in the first half of the year has declined 5
percent, the first drop in four years, the FBI
said yesterday.
Attorney General William French Smith
said the report was encouraging, but cautioned
against predicting any trend from the decrease.
Instead, Smith pointed out that the FBI
crime index had reached an all-time high in
1980 and remained at that level through last
year.
"While this apparent reversal is encourag
ing, the fact that the all-time high was reached
and maintained for a two-year period should
be of major concern to the nation," he said.
Crime experts offered numerous possible ex
planations for the downturn. But they also
warned there are nearly as many theories as ex
perts when it comes to crime statistics.
Prof. Gerald Kaplan of George Washington
University said "you can't prove anything" by
the Figures. He said his own pet theory is that a
shift in national attitude away from per
missiveness may account for the change.
"The mood of this administration and this
country is a whole lot different. They ain't
going to tolerate it," said Kaplan, former di
rector of the National Institute of Justice. He
contended would-be criminals have been de
terred by the change in attitude.
Others cited the economy, increased en
rollment in the armed forces and the"aging" of
the American population as possible reasons
for fewer crimes.
Some experts also said the FBI index is a
measurement of police activity and that some
cases may not be classified now as crimes by
the police called to investigate.
FBI Director William Webster noted that in
the first half of 1978 there was a 2 percent drop
in the number of reported crimes, compared to
the first six months of 1977.
That was the last time the FBl's Uniform
Crime Report showed a decrease for a com
parable six-month period.
Panel criticizes med schools
Washington Medical education has be
come a "brutal academic experience" with too
much scientific detail and not enough em
phasis on the basic skills of treating patients, a
study panel set up by the nation's medical col
leges charged yesterday.
"We believe there should be a decrease in the
enormous pressure that is put on students in
the medical schools," said panel chairman
Steven Muller, the president of Johns Hopkins
University.
"We are doing an excellent job in training
clinical scientists," Muller declared at a brief
ing for reporters. "But there are some things

they are not getting, in part because of the ex
traordinary dosage of science they receive."
Muller said the panel would not issue a final
report with detailed recommendations for an
overhaul of the medical curriculum until late
1984. But after its first year of study the 18-
member group decided to publicize the fun
damental assumptions" of the changes it will
seek.
The Association of American Medical Col
leges established the panel to take the most
comprehensive look at medical education since
its basic modern form was established by the
reports of Abraham Flexner in 1912 and
Willard Rappleye 20 years later. The group has
a $1 million budget for an array of working
groups and hearings.
Muller said the contention that medical
school faculties are "submerging students in
overwhelming detail" was reflected in ques
tionnaires returned by more than 1000 medical
school administrators, professors and stu
dents.
Most of the nation's 67,000 medical students
spend 30 to 40 hours a week in classrooms and
laboratories, Muller said, compared with a
maximum of 16 hours per week for under
graduates and 12 hours for other graduate stu
dents.
With their reading added in, Muller said,
most medical students "can only get by by
working roughly 18 hours a day."
"They don't do anything else," he declared.
"All they do is go through that cur
riculum. . . .How much of it are they really
going to use?"
In the clinical part of medical education, the
panel said, "specialized knowledge and the ap
plication of sophisticated technolo
gy. . .detract from students' learning the fun
damental skills (of examining patients) that all
physicians should have."
More emphasis should be put on taking a
patient's history, using instruments such as a
stethoscope, and treating minor problems and
injuries, the panel said, leaving more special
ized skills to be acquired in the residencies that
95 percent of medical school graduates now
take.
No press on Weinberger trip
Washington Secretary of Defense Caspar
Weinberger has decided, at least temporarily,
against taking reporters with him on a major
trip to the Far East next month, the Pentagon
said yesterday.
Pentagon spokesman Henry Catto would
not say why Weinberger had made the de
cision. "I don't think he is under any obliga
tion to justify himself," Catto said.
There is "no mosaic tablet saying that secre
taries of defense should or must take the press
on trips," Catto said. "This does not mean
there will be any lessening of the dialogue with
the people."
Catto said, however, that wives of the secre
tary and other defense officials would accom
pany Weinberger at taxpayers' expense. Re
porters who normally travel with Weinberger
pay the equivalent of first-class air fares when
they do.
Weinberger and his official entourage will
visit Singapore, Thailand, Australia and New
Zealand, according to defense officials who
asked not to be identified.
Reporters have not traditionally accom
panied defense secretaries on all foreign trips.
But the increased importance of the Depart
ment of Defense in formulating foreign policy
under the Reagan administration, and Wein
berger's own predilection for "committing for
eign policy," as he puts it, have led most news
organizations to cover Weinberger wherever
he goes.
The resulting press coverage of his travels
10 major foreign trips during his first 20
months in office generated criticism of

Weinberger by some members of Congress and
within the administration. That criticism
reached a peak last spring when Weinberger
angered Israel and the State Department by
espousing closer military relations with mod
erate Arab states.
Last month, Weinberger, in what his aides
described as a temporary policy, excluded re
porters from another Mideast trip. Weinberger
was said to be pleased at the low-key coverage
thjat that trip received.
LA drug bust nets De Lorean
Los Angeles John De Lorean, producer of
the stylistic De Lorean sports car, was arrested
yesterday at a Los Angeles International Air
port hotel as he arrived to pick up 220 pounds
of cocaine in a $24 million deal he hoped would
save his company, the FBI said.
De Lorean, 57, and two other men one the
owner of an aviation company were charged
with conspiring to distribute cocaine and
possession of cocaine with intent to distribute.
FBI special agent in charge of the Los Angel
es office, Richard Bretzing, announced the ar
rests, saying they culminated a five-month in
vestigation which involved numerous federal
agencies and the Police Department of Ven
tura.
De Lorean "expressed interest in financing
something that would produce quickly large
sums of money in return for the investments.
... His company is in severe financial problems
and he feared the possibility of his company
being closed down by the (British) government
which had extended loans to him," Bretzing
said.
De Lorean, a former vice president of Gen
eral Motors, four years ago with British gov
ernment help set up his own auto plant in Bel
fast, Northern Ireland, to produce the $25,000
sports car with gull-wing doors. The cars are
distinguishable by their silvery stainless steel
bodies.
The arrest came as the government in Great
Britain announced De Lorean's car plant will
be closed permanently.
The Belfast plant, which went into re
ceivership in February, probably will end oper
ations within 10 days, plant officials said yes
terday.
The closure announcement came 24 hours
after Northern Ireland Secretary of State
James Prior met the De Lorean receivers to dis
cuss the future of the factory.
Bretzing displayed about six pounds of co
caine which he said were seized Monday night
in the vicinity of suburban Van Nuys Airport.
He said the packets of white powder had a
street value of $6.5 million.
Bretzing said De Lorean had several kilos of
cocaine in his possession when he was arrested.
Stocks mixed in heavy trading
New York The stock market closed mixed
yesterday in heavy trading as blue-chip issues
lost some of their favor and ended a seesaw day
with a moderate decline.
Auto, photography and energy issues paced
the losers while some financial, drug and tech
nology stocks moved ahead.
The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials,
which rose 26.12 Monday to near a 9 3 /4-year
high, opened with a 6.17 gain but suddenly
turned lower. It was off 12.32 points with an
hour of trading left before a late recovery
helped trim its loss to 5.42, at 1013.80.
Today's weather
Mostly sunny today. Highs in the mid 60's
and mid 70's.
