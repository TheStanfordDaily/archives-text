Just on the other side of the train tracks sits The Bay
Window, a small, reasonably priced restaurant serv
ing up excellent food and a unique twist. Dine from
the varied menu as you wish, and leave feeling like a
good Samaritan. The Bay Window Auxiliary runs The
Bay Window as a non-profit business supporting
Family Services Association.
Upon entering the restaurant, two signs vie for your
attention. The first informs that "All Tips are Direct
Contributions to Family Services Association" and
the second, a blackboard, tempts you with descrip
tions of the nightly specials. Our waitress, a volunteer
along with the other week-night waitresses, surprised
us by greeting us with warm sourdough bread and but
ter. The entire staff was friendly, contributing to a lei
surely, relaxing dinner.
We began our meal with an appetizer, Cafe
Mushrooms ($2.25), a dish of tender cap mushrooms
sauteed in an exquisite sauce of lemon, garlic and

mint. We then had a bowl of the House Soup ($ 1.50), a
delicious vegetable combination spiced with the Bay
Window's own vinaigrette dressing, flavored with
sweet mustard.
As for the main dish, the specials vary from night to
night at the chefs whim, but according to our
waitress, tend to be the same basic specials. We had to
choose between five mouth-watering dishes, these in
addition to the entrees on the standard menu. The spe
cials offered us included Sole Meuniere, Trout Stuffed
with Shrimp, and Pasta Italiano, a good indicator of
the variety of food served. The menu offered entrees
ranging from Top Sirloin ($8.95), the highest price
dish, to chicken divan, down to Peas'n'Pasta ($4.45),
most accompanied by vegetables.
We chose the Choulibiac from the standard menu
($6.95), an excellent crab mousse with snapper and
mushrooms in a crusty pastry with a hollandaise sauce
along with one of the specials, a superb Orange
Walnut Chicken. The tender chicken both smelled
and tasted spicy and exotic, and appealed to the eye as
well as the palate. Covered with a sweet and sour or
ange glaze and a mountain of walnuts, it and the
Choulibiac were served with buttered carrots; chicken

also had a curry rice.
The other patrons dining at the Bay Window, peo
ple of the community, seemed familiar with and at
home in the restaurant. Softly lit and airy, the at
mosphere was enhanced by soothing classical music.
Though well satisfied by our meal, we had to sample
the dessert menu, an assortment of pies and tortes
from which we chose cheesecake and pecan pie. The
cheesecake ($1.50) lemony with a cream cheese top
ping, and the pecan pie ($1.75) were just right.
Our waitress and the rest of the staff seemed eager,
when asked, to tell about their restaurant and its vol
unteer management and food services. Though The
Bay Window has a large overhead, as the kitchen staff
and Friday and Saturday night waitresses are paid,
any profits go to Family Services Association, an of
fshoot of United Way. Because of this novel practice,
the management seems more content than usual in a
restaurant to allow patrons a leisurely meal.
Also open for lunch, The Bay Window serves din
ner from 5:30-9:30 Tuesday through Thursday nights
and from 5:30-10 on Friday and Saturday nights. Res
ervations are accepted but not required.
