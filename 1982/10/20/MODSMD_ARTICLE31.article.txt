# Unexpected French elegance â€“ on El Camino

### JAN MIRELES 
CHEZ LOUIS
4170 ElCamino
Palo Alto

Chez Louis doesn't look like
much from the outside. Set back
from the street the restaurant is a
squat one-story building with a
lot of cars parked outside. But it's
not the outside that matters. It's
the food served inside that
counts. And Chez Louis adds up
to some very fine dining.
The idea of critiquing French
food can be intimidating. Order
ing it can be even more so. After
poring over our menus a very pa
tient and efficient waiter assured
us our selections, Tournedos au
Poure Vert, a filet of beef
($15.50), and Supreme de Vol
aille, Viennoise, breast of chicken
Vienese style, ($ 10.25), would not
disappoint us.
We began our meal with one of
Chez Louis' hot appetizers, crepe
de Fruits de Mer, Nantua ($5.75)
Generously filled with seafood
and topped with a delicate
lobster sauce, the crepe is recom
mended to please even the most
ambivalent seafood taster. The
restaurant also offers cold ap
petizers ranging from fresh
marinated fish with lime juice
($2.75) to smoked salmon
($7.25).
Since all entrees include soup
du jour, salad, fresh vegetables
du jour, potato or rice, we looked
forward to a leisurely dinner.
From the appetizer we moved on
to a plain heart-of-butter lettuce

salad liberally covered with a
heavily spiced cream dressing.
The soup that followed sparked a
difference of opinion. While my
partner appreciated the "split
pea" taste, I found the soup's tex
ture grainy and somewhat bland.
Both the soup and salad were
served witb a rather non-descript
complimentary sour dough
bread.
While we waited for the main
course to be served (it wasn't
long) my date and I paused to ad
mire the simple taste reflected in
our surroundings. Soft lighting,
low-beamed ceilings and a cheery
fireplace, (albeit fake) complete
with copper pots suspended from
the mantle contributed much to
the atmosphere of warmth and
simple comfort available at Chez
Louis. Print drapes at the win
dow, matching wall paper and '
crisp white linen tablecloths
topped with attractive china
complemented the pervading air
of grace.
The mood was broken only
when my date and I realized the
music being piped over the sound
system was a bit out of the or
dinary. Throughout our meal we
heard such instrumental stan
dards as Guy Lombardo's "Auld
Lang Syne," "Jingle Bells," and
"My Way."
The entree proved to be the
star of the meal. The beef filet,
broiled and topped with green
peppercorn butter was excellent.
Succulent and finely seasoned the
filet is highly recommended. My
date pronounced the breast of

chicken moist and tender and
promptly polished it off. Pre
pared in the traditional French
manner, the accompanying car
rots, green beans and potatoes
were crisp and Firm.
For desert we sampled the
house cheesecake ($1.75),
smooth and creamy and a de
licious raspberry and liqueur
concoction ($2.75) spooned over
a simple vanilla ice cream and
topped with fresh whipped
cream. Be forewarned; both are
extremely rich.
After our meal, we met Louis,
the owner. An engaging
Frenchman, Louis proudly gave
us a tour of his domain. In addi
tion to the main dining room, the
restaurant boasts two banquet

sized rooms used for special din
ners, cocktail parties or as extra
seating on overflow nights. The
larger of the rooms opens onto a
small cobble-stone patio com
plete with vine-covered trellis
and a patch of moonlight.
Hand-painted plates imported
from Britainny before the De
pression adorn the walls of one
room, while antique sideboards
serve both an aesthetic and prac
tical function throughout the res
taurant.
Chez Louis has a wine list in
cluding 180 varieties that could
keep the most avid wine taster
busy for months. Louis showed
us one vintage year that costs
$l2OO a bottle and joked that "if
the earthquake ever comes, I'll be

ready." Other wines are more
moderately priced.
An added feature at Chez
Louis is the piano bar. Cozy
booths as well as tables for two
are placed around the piano in
the dimly lit bar. At the far end of
the bar is a fireplace and two
small couches where couples can
sit and converse. Entertainment
is on Tuesday through Saturday
only and the restaurant is closed
Sunday. Though reservations are
not required they are recom
mended.
While not typical fare for the
student on a budget, Chez Louis
is an excellent choice for a special
evening out. The cars outside
told us all we needed to know.

the atmosphere of warmth and
simple comfort available at Chez
Louis. Print drapes at the win
dow, matching wall paper and '
crisp white linen tablecloths
topped with attractive china
complemented the pervading air
of grace.
The mood was broken only
when my date and I realized the
music being piped over the sound
system was a bit out of the or
dinary. Throughout our meal we
heard such instrumental stan
dards as Guy Lombardo's "Auld
Lang Syne," "Jingle Bells," and
"My Way."
The entree proved to be the
star of the meal. The beef filet,
broiled and topped with green
peppercorn butter was excellent.
Succulent and finely seasoned the
filet is highly recommended. My
date pronounced the breast of

chicken moist and tender and
promptly polished it off. Pre
pared in the traditional French
manner, the accompanying car
rots, green beans and potatoes
were crisp and Firm.
For desert we sampled the
house cheesecake ($1.75),
smooth and creamy and a de
licious raspberry and liqueur
concoction ($2.75) spooned over
a simple vanilla ice cream and
topped with fresh whipped
cream. Be forewarned; both are
extremely rich.
After our meal, we met Louis,
the owner. An engaging
Frenchman, Louis proudly gave
us a tour of his domain. In addi
tion to the main dining room, the
restaurant boasts two banquet

sized rooms used for special din
ners, cocktail parties or as extra
seating on overflow nights. The
larger of the rooms opens onto a
small cobble-stone patio com
plete with vine-covered trellis
and a patch of moonlight.
Hand-painted plates imported
from Britainny before the De
pression adorn the walls of one
room, while antique sideboards
serve both an aesthetic and prac
tical function throughout the res
taurant.
Chez Louis has a wine list in
cluding 180 varieties that could
keep the most avid wine taster
busy for months. Louis showed
us one vintage year that costs
$l2OO a bottle and joked that "if
the earthquake ever comes, I'll be

ready." Other wines are more
moderately priced.
An added feature at Chez
Louis is the piano bar. Cozy
booths as well as tables for two
are placed around the piano in
the dimly lit bar. At the far end of
the bar is a fireplace and two
small couches where couples can
sit and converse. Entertainment
is on Tuesday through Saturday
only and the restaurant is closed
Sunday. Though reservations are
not required they are recom
mended.
While not typical fare for the
student on a budget, Chez Louis
is an excellent choice for a special
evening out. The cars outside
told us all we needed to know.

Chez Louis doesn't look like
much from the outside. Set back
from the street the restaurant is a
squat one-story building with a
lot of cars parked outside. But it's
not the outside that matters. It's
the food served inside that
counts. And Chez Louis adds up
to some very fine dining.
The idea of critiquing French
food can be intimidating. Order
ing it can be even more so. After
poring over our menus a very pa
tient and efficient waiter assured
us our selections, Tournedos au
Poure Vert, a filet of beef
($15.50), and Supreme de Vol
aille, Viennoise, breast of chicken
Vienese style, ($ 10.25), would not
disappoint us.
We began our meal with one of
Chez Louis' hot appetizers, crepe
de Fruits de Mer, Nantua ($5.75)
Generously filled with seafood
and topped with a delicate
lobster sauce, the crepe is recom
mended to please even the most
ambivalent seafood taster. The
restaurant also offers cold ap
petizers ranging from fresh
marinated fish with lime juice
($2.75) to smoked salmon
($7.25).
Since all entrees include soup
du jour, salad, fresh vegetables
du jour, potato or rice, we looked
forward to a leisurely dinner.
From the appetizer we moved on
to a plain heart-of-butter lettuce

salad liberally covered with a
heavily spiced cream dressing.
The soup that followed sparked a
difference of opinion. While my
partner appreciated the "split
pea" taste, I found the soup's tex
ture grainy and somewhat bland.
Both the soup and salad were
served witb a rather non-descript
complimentary sour dough
bread.
While we waited for the main
course to be served (it wasn't
long) my date and I paused to ad
mire the simple taste reflected in
our surroundings. Soft lighting,
low-beamed ceilings and a cheery
fireplace, (albeit fake) complete
with copper pots suspended from
the mantle contributed much to
the atmosphere of warmth and
simple comfort available at Chez
Louis. Print drapes at the win
dow, matching wall paper and '
crisp white linen tablecloths
