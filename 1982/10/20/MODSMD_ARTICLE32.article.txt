Chez Justine

Chez Justine. Well ... it
sounds French. Unfortunately
(or fortunately, depending on
your taste in restaurants) the
name was essentially the only dis
tinguishing French character
istics of this Palo Alto Holiday
Inn Restaurant.
Not to imply that not French is
not good the food was ex
cellent. The atmosphere was
posh, but not pretentious, and
the service was almost instan
taneous (on a Monday evening at
6:30 p.m. we had the entire dining
room and three waiters to
ourselves!).

We began, appropriately, with
an appetizer. Reading over the
four choices â€”my first choice,
quenelles ($5.50; a sort of sea
food sampler) was unavailable
1 chose smoked salmon ($4.75),
which was served with an in
teresting array of garnishes, all
quite<lelicious.

Onion soup ($2.75) followed
for both of us, and I must admit it
was prepared to authentic per
fection, complete with French
bread and broiled cheese floating
on top. A salad of lettuce leaves
and a tomato slice preceded our
entree: we were offered blue
cheese or thousand island dress
ing.
Continuing on a seafood
motif, I was brought my entree of
scampi in lobster sauce ($14.50):
five medium size shrimp were
covered (not excessively) in a
unique and really superb-tasting
cream sauce. Potatoes and
cooked carrots were also ar
ranged on the plate; neither vege
table was anything to rave on and
on about, but they were ade
quate. As for my co-reviewer; her
veal scallopini ($14.00) was the
perfect tenderness, served in a
brown sauce with mushrooms;
however, the noodles were kind
of "boring" and her asparagus
was merely "0.k." (both came
with the entree). To round out
the main course, a very good
house white wine was served.
The dessert selection included
either strawberries romanoff,
grand marnier souffle, chocolate
mousse, or coupe Jamaica (from
$3.75 for the strawberries to
$9.00 for the two-person souffle).
Although the souffle looked
tempting (we were told at the be
ginning of the evening that the

chef needed 45 minutes notice) I
opted for the cholocate mousse. I
found it closer to a pudding con
sistency than I expected, but it
was still tasty. The Coupe Jamai
ca ($3.50) ordered by my dinner
partner was an interesting com
bination of pineapple, rum, and
coffee ice-cream. Never one for
superlatives, she thought it was
"really good."
In general, although presented
a fairly limited fare, both my date
and I thoroughly enjoyed the

choices we made tor appetizer,
entree and dessert. Portions were
rather small; however by the end
of the evening we were both quite
full; and prices were a bit high
(the cheapest entree, frog legs,
was $11.25; the most expensive,
rack of lamb for two, about
$35.00) but nothing overwhelm
ingly unexpected.

The main thing I found lacking
was any semblance of French at
mosphere. The quenelles, onion
soup, orange duck and choco
loate mousse saved the menu
from being exclusively continen
tal, and the maitre-d's name
happened to be Armand. But
burgundy baroque would most
adequately describe the admit-

tedly plush dining area. Dark,
heavy theatre-style drapes cov
ered the back wall and most of
the ceiling, with similarly dark
carpeting on the floor. The huge
chandeliers kept the one room
fairly well lit (a candle was

brought after we were seated)
and tables were arranged almost
(not quite) in rows,the smallest
one seating four. Somehow, it
wasn't difficult to remember the
hotel lobby was two doors away.
All in all, Chez Justine could
be described as a very fine, nicer
hotel restaurant. On the other
hand, it was nothing out of the
more-expensive ordinary. If
you're looking for an intimate
authentic auberge which captures
the charm of old Paris, this defi
nitely is not the place to try. If
you want a leisurely (about two
to three hours), well-prepared
meal, are impressed with service,
and don't mind paying a bit more
than somewhere farther down
the road, you'll probably really
enjoy Chez Justine.

The main thing I
found lacking was any
semblance of French
atmoshpere. The
quenelles, onion soup,
orange duck and
chocolate mousse
saved the menu from
being exclusively
continental...

Ail in all, Chez
Justine could be
described as a very
fine, nicer hotel
restaurant.
