Two Sisters Creperie
355 State Street
Los Altos
941-2782
It's fitting, and not surprising, that a state pro
ducing hybrids like "Gucci Bolshevism" should
give rise to a homestyle French creperie like Los
Altos' Two Sister's cafe.
On the menu, "cuisine de campagne" staples like
Quichef Lorraine and Crepes Suzette coexist with
unknowns like Avocado Farci and Armenian
Salad. In the dining room, traditional French
paisley wallpaper and oilcloths come to an under
standing with a free-form oak salad bar and
mellowed California redwood paneling.
Minor inconsistencies aside, Two Sister's sets a
very good, though not stellar, table. The entrees
tend toward the more simple French specialities...
less Hollandaise sauce and escargots; more simple
crepes, salads, and quiches in the $7.00 range.
This is not the place to bring a date for a full
blown romantic French dinner with a violinist and
an expensive bottle cf wine, although you might ex
pect it to be. The French would label Two Sisters
"charmant" but not "elegant."
Owner Jean Wolfgram Hall, who bought the es
tablishment from the founding two sisters, is a long
time Los Altos resident who draws upon her ex
perience teaching food science in the Palo Alto
school district. Her children help with the cafe, bus
ing dishes and helping in the kitchen. Many of the
clientele seem to be locals who dine at the cafe regu
larly. Two Sisters tries to be a Los Altos restaurant
. .. and succeeds.
The crepes, most made from authentic French
recipes gathered when the restaurant's founder

spent her sophmore year at the Stanford campus in
Tours, form the menu's centerpiece. The Florentine
Crepe ($7.50), stuffed with mushrooms, onions,
cream cheese and spinach is quite good, though a
little heavy on the swiss cheese topping. Crepe
Ratatouille ($7.50), Poulet a la Parisienne ($7.95),
Country-Style Crepe ($7.95), Paysanne Stroganoff
($8.00), and Seafood Newberg ($9.00) round off the
traditional dinner crepes. Vegetable delight ($7.50)
and fisherman's choice ($8.25) seem departures
aimed at California tastes.
Hall has refined the quiche recipes and come up
with light souffle-type versions which are very suc
cessful. Roast leg of lamb, filet of sole, beef
bearnaise "full-scale" entrees are also available
but they tend to be more expensive, in the $lO.OO
range.
Pilaf, soup or salad are included with the entrees.
The Armenian ladies who suggested adding the
Aremenian Salad entree to the menu would have;
probably turned up their noses at the spiced rice
passed off as pilaf. But the French Onion soup
would win back anyone's heart. The oak salad bar,
which the owner likes to tell you has been "state
gically located in the back of the restaurant" offers
terrific salad possibilities as well as a great Dijon
mustard dressing.
Crepes Suzette ($5.00 for two) top off the dinner
in a flash. Both before the first taste, and after, when
the 150 proof Cointreau liqueur in which the crepes
are cooked hits the throat.
All this is served up with conscientious, though
sometimes halting, service.
A little bit of atmosphere, a little bit of food, a
little bit of service, a little bit of blending, and viola!
Two Sisters not outstanding, but very pleasant.
