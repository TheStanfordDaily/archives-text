Who says you need to go all the way into San Francisco for a really
special French dinner? Le Pot au Feu, located on El Camino near San
ta Cruz Ave., offers fine French cuisine without a 45 minute drive into
the city.
Jean and Nina Cornil and their gracious staff have catered to Palo
Alto restaurant-goers for almost a decade. But nine years away from
France has not dimmed the restaurant's French country charm a bit.
From the Cinzano umbrellas over the patio tables to the red
geraniums in the window boxes, Le Pot au Feu is authentically
French.
As the menu explains, Le Pot au Feu'x proprietaires are dedicated
to serving the finest and freshest foods available. For this reason, they
prefer to have a rather small menu and offer, along with it, a selection
of daily specials which vary according to the season and market avail
ability.
All full dinners include the house special soup, salad, sourdough
bread and butter and fresh vegetables. Although the menu is small,
entree choices range from beef (Le Brochette de Filet Bearnaise and
Boeuf Wellington) to Le Civet de Japin (rabbit) to Le Canard a
I'Orange (duck) to Le Saumon en Croute au Beune Blanc (salmon).
Dinners average $l2 a person, but for the superior quality of the food
and service, this is a very reasonable price.
An extensive wine-list containing both French and Californian
wines makes choosing a meal even more difficult, but the softly lit,
cafe-like atmosphere provides a pleasant setting by which to make
your decision.
As an appetizer we sampled the Terrine ($2.50) a homemade
country-style pate served with tiny gerkins and found it delicious.
For dinner we decided to try the Boeuf Wellington filet mignon in a
puff pastry crust, duxelle of mushroom and pate, madera sauce and
the house specialty, Le Saumon en Croute au Beurne Blanc salmon
in a pastry crust, baked in herbs and cream lemon and butter sauce.
We were not disappointed by our choices. The soup (a rich tomato
concoction), the salad (with a light oil and vinegar house dressing) and
both entrees were excellent. The frozen raspberry cream ($2.50) we
selected for dessert was a perfect end to a fantastic meal.
The food was delicious. The service was prompt. Our waiter was
available, courteous and like the restaurant, very French. I highly rec
ommend Le Pot au Feu for a very enjoyable meal.
Le Pot au Feu serves dinner from 6-10 p.m. Tuesday through Satur
day. Reservations are not accepted except for parties of eight or more.
