If federal government spending for
research in high-energy physics is not
accelerated to keep pace with the Eu
ropeans, the United States will lose its
preeminent position in the field, accord
ing to Sidney Drell, deputy director of
the Stanford Linear Accelerator Center
(SLAC).
Though the Department of Energy
has renewed its commitment to give
about $lOO million annually for the
next five years to cover research costs at
SLAC, a 15-year trend of decreasing
government financing for the study of
high energy physics is endangering the
United States' leadership in that field,
according to SLAC officials.
SLAC, Fermilab in Chicago and
Brookhaven National Laboratory in
New York are this country's main facil
ities for the study of elementary particle
physics through the use of high energy.
The major comparable foreign labora
tories are CERN in Geneva, Switzer
land and DESY in Hamburg, Germa
ny.
Western European governments are
currently outspending the United
States by nearly two-to-one for high
energy physics work, Drell said.
While there is "an enormous
amount" of international cooperation
and coordination in high energy phys
ics, according to Wolfgang Panofsky,
director of SLAC, the natural desire to
make major discoveries before another
country still exists.
"There certainly is a strong desire to
retain leadership. . .although one can
argue, who cares, you can learn from
the other guys and then put it to work,
by and large the whole spirit of the en
terprise has been paced by (competi
tion)," said Panofsky.
In the early 19305, according to Pan
ofsky, the leadership position in
elementary particle physics passed from
Europe to the United States.
Drell, however, said he is concerned
that Europe may recapture that spot. In
testimony before the House Subcom
mittee on Energy Development and
Applications earlier this year, Drell
said, "It saddens me greatly to see this
nation giving back that baton (of lead
ership) without cause or reason after
possessing it for a mere 50 years. Yet
this is the inevitable consequence of a
decrease in our investment in basic re
search and learning."
The portion of GNP allocated for
basic research has declined by 21 per

cent since fiscal year 1967, according to
Drell's testimony.
"We need (funding) to be stable,"
Drell said, because commitments are
made based on assumptions about what
the funding levels will be.
A victim of inadequate funding is a
partially constructed accelerator at
Brookhaven, according to William
Kirk, assistant director of research at
SLAC. Construction of the accelerator,
named ISABELLE, was slowed in 1979
when technological problems arose, but
Kirk said; the only real obstruction to
completion now is the lack of money.
"Whether or not it will ever be fin

ished is uncertain," he added.
Government funding must allow for
the completion of ISABELLE or a
comparable facility, along with the con
struction of other new equipment, in
cluding the Stanford Linear Collider,
by the end of the decade if the long-term
quality of U.S. high energy physics re
search is to remain superior, according
to Drell's testimony in March.
Commenting on the fact that the
Western Europeans are outspending
the United States in this area, Panofsky
said, "In the short run, it doesn't make
much difference, but in the long run, it
will certainly erode the overall scien
tific, technological spirit."
The discrepancy in funding between
this country and Europe gives Europe
an accelerators an advantage because
they may be able to operate for more
months out of each year, said Drell. The
accelerator at SLAC is turned off from
May or June to October because new
experiments need to be put in and
energy costs are high, he said.
"Every lab has a certain amount of
downtime" to set up new experiments,
Drell said, but whether it is down two or
four months makes a difference.

Some of the reasons the Europeans
are able to spend more on high energy
physics programs include the dif
ferences in the way the countries' gov
ernments are structured and the fact
that various European nations have col
laborated, according to Panofsky. "The
Europeans have done a very good job in
pooling the resources of all the Europe
an countries towards the CERN labo
ratory," he said.
Panofsky added that CERN has been
more successful than other inter-Eu
ropean projects, "so it is kind of a show
piece of inter-European collabora

tion."
Government support is needed, Drell
said, not only to pay for research and
equipment but also to get the "best
brains into the field." When funding
levels drop, a student's research project
may have to be delayed but "you can't
turn off students' lives," he said.
Since researchers in high energy
physics normally spend four or five
years in graduate school and then a few
more years doing doctoral research,
Drell said greater encouragement must
be given to students.
"It is essential to attract, to train, and
to retain outstanding young scientists in
this exacting field of research if the U.S.
high energy program is to remain pre
eminent," Drell testified.

Drell and Panofsky also commented
on international coordination in parti
cle physics.
According to Panofsky, the exchange
of information and personnel between
countries is a normal process. When
SLAC reseachers take a sabbatical they
usually go to European laboratories.
Similar practices followed by foreign
researchers account for the fact that
Western Europeans, Soviets and Chi
nese are currently working at SLAC, he
said.
"On the third floor (at SLAC), bro
ken English is sort of the general lan
guage," laughed Panofsky.

A victim of inadequate funding is a
partially constructed accelerator at
Brookhaven, according to William
Kirk, assistant director of research at
SLAC. Construction of the accelerator,
named ISABELLE, was slowed in 1979
when technological problems arose, but
Kirk said; the only real obstruction to
completion now is the lack of money.
"Whether or not it will ever be fin

ished is uncertain," he added.
Government funding must allow for
the completion of ISABELLE or a
comparable facility, along with the con
struction of other new equipment, in
cluding the Stanford Linear Collider,
by the end of the decade if the long-term
quality of U.S. high energy physics re
search is to remain superior, according
to Drell's testimony in March.
Commenting on the fact that the
Western Europeans are outspending
the United States in this area, Panofsky
said, "In the short run, it doesn't make
much difference, but in the long run, it
will certainly erode the overall scien
tific, technological spirit."
The discrepancy in funding between
this country and Europe gives Europe
an accelerators an advantage because
they may be able to operate for more
months out of each year, said Drell. The
accelerator at SLAC is turned off from
May or June to October because new
experiments need to be put in and
energy costs are high, he said.
"Every lab has a certain amount of
downtime" to set up new experiments,
Drell said, but whether it is down two or
four months makes a difference.

Some of the reasons the Europeans
are able to spend more on high energy
physics programs include the dif
ferences in the way the countries' gov
ernments are structured and the fact
that various European nations have col
laborated, according to Panofsky. "The
Europeans have done a very good job in
pooling the resources of all the Europe
an countries towards the CERN labo
ratory," he said.
Panofsky added that CERN has been
more successful than other inter-Eu
ropean projects, "so it is kind of a show
piece of inter-European collabora

tion."
Government support is needed, Drell
said, not only to pay for research and
equipment but also to get the "best
brains into the field." When funding
levels drop, a student's research project
may have to be delayed but "you can't
turn off students' lives," he said.
Since researchers in high energy
physics normally spend four or five
years in graduate school and then a few
more years doing doctoral research,
Drell said greater encouragement must
be given to students.
"It is essential to attract, to train, and
to retain outstanding young scientists in
this exacting field of research if the U.S.
high energy program is to remain pre
eminent," Drell testified.

Drell and Panofsky also commented
on international coordination in parti
cle physics.
According to Panofsky, the exchange
of information and personnel between
countries is a normal process. When
SLAC reseachers take a sabbatical they
usually go to European laboratories.
Similar practices followed by foreign
researchers account for the fact that
Western Europeans, Soviets and Chi
nese are currently working at SLAC, he
said.
"On the third floor (at SLAC), bro
ken English is sort of the general lan
guage," laughed Panofsky.
Tomorrow's story will describe the
Stanford Linear Collider.
First in a series.
If federal government spending for
research in high-energy physics is not
accelerated to keep pace with the Eu
ropeans, the United States will lose its
preeminent position in the field, accord
ing to Sidney Drell, deputy director of
the Stanford Linear Accelerator Center
(SLAC).
Though the Department of Energy
has renewed its commitment to give
about $lOO million annually for the
next five years to cover research costs at
SLAC, a 15-year trend of decreasing
government financing for the study of
high energy physics is endangering the
United States' leadership in that field,
according to SLAC officials.
SLAC, Fermilab in Chicago and
Brookhaven National Laboratory in
New York are this country's main facil
ities for the study of elementary particle
physics through the use of high energy.
The major comparable foreign labora
tories are CERN in Geneva, Switzer
land and DESY in Hamburg, Germa
ny.
Western European governments are
currently outspending the United
States by nearly two-to-one for high
energy physics work, Drell said.
While there is "an enormous
amount" of international cooperation
and coordination in high energy phys
ics, according to Wolfgang Panofsky,
director of SLAC, the natural desire to
make major discoveries before another
country still exists.
"There certainly is a strong desire to
retain leadership. . .although one can
argue, who cares, you can learn from
the other guys and then put it to work,
by and large the whole spirit of the en
terprise has been paced by (competi
tion)," said Panofsky.
In the early 19305, according to Pan
ofsky, the leadership position in
elementary particle physics passed from
Europe to the United States.
Drell, however, said he is concerned
that Europe may recapture that spot. In
testimony before the House Subcom
mittee on Energy Development and
Applications earlier this year, Drell
said, "It saddens me greatly to see this
nation giving back that baton (of lead
ership) without cause or reason after
possessing it for a mere 50 years. Yet
this is the inevitable consequence of a
decrease in our investment in basic re
search and learning."
The portion of GNP allocated for
basic research has declined by 21 per

cent since fiscal year 1967, according to
Drell's testimony.
"We need (funding) to be stable,"
Drell said, because commitments are
made based on assumptions about what
the funding levels will be.
