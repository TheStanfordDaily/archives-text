# Strike-inflicted wounds hurt campus labor relations
## 
### DAVID AZRIN Senior staff writer 
Though United Stanford Workers
(USW) ended their 30-day strike
against the University more than a
week ago, many union members remain
bitter towards University management
and fellow workers who ignored the
strike.
The strike created deep divisions be
tween labor and management here and
was marred by incidents of vandalism,
confrontation and verbal abuse. More
than 25 workers were arrested for van
dalism and related charges.
"The feelings (towards scab workers
and management) are not going to go
away," said Michael Baratz, executive
secretary of USW. "You just don't
forget that easily."
Union officials said at the member
ship meeting last Saturday they were
forced to accept the unfavorable settle
ment because so many workers were re
turning to their jobs. Workers said they
could no longer afford to stay off their
jobs.
Union officials are pinning their
hopes for an increase in union strength
on the upcoming union elections at the
Stanford Hospital. About 1200 service
and maintenance workers will vote
Nov. 5 and 6 on whether to join USW.
The University is urging hospital
workers to vote against joining the
union.
"The hospital will urge employees
not to vote in favor of the union," said
University labor counsel John
Schwartz, adding that he felt the
unionization effort would fail.
"The employees have a right to know
what the facts are," he said. "If the em
ployees only get their facts from the
union, they ought to have the views
from the hospital administration as
well," Schwartz said.
Baratz said the union is putting in a

strong effort toward organizing hospi
tal workers, and both sides said they are
watching the election closely.
Baratz claimed that hospital man
agers will use "dirty tricks" in order to
convince hospital workers to vote
against unionization, although he ad
mitted that these haven't been em
ployed yet.
"There's just an overriding intimida
tion and fear in that hospital all the
time," he said.
While some workers remain bitter
toward management because of the
strike, there have been no new incidents
of vandalism or harrassment since
workers returned to their jobs last
Monday, according to University man
agers.
"Workers have dismissed it from
their minds as sort of a bad dream,"
said Bernard Lighthouse, assistant di
rector of personnel at SLAC, "Things
are very quiet and we haven't had any
labor difficulties at all."
James Horgan, head of operations
and maintenance said that he was sur
prised striking workers who returned to
their jobs showed no outward signs of
bitterness.
"The strike is not even an issue. It's
almost as if it never happened," he said.
"It's really kind of surprises me that
things are at such a low level. Are they
angry with the negotiating team? Are
they unhappy with the senior man
agement? Are they unhappy with their
■ own union? They did not get everything
they were trying to get. But I don't
know that they're mad at anybody."
Union officials said that workers
were only hiding their anger because
they are still subject to disciplinary ac
tion for any misconduct during the
strike. The amnesty agreement in the
final contract states that employees will
be subject to disciplinary action for any
act of vandalism, violence or other
gross misconduct for 30 calendar days

after the strike.
Schwartz explained that University
negotiatiors chose the 30-day period be
cause they believed that "any aftermath
there should occur within 30 days."
The University is now considering
taking disciplinary action against "a
small number" of workers, according
to University labor counsel Priscilla
Wheeler.
"On the day-to-day relations people
have been asked to be cool at least until
the 30 days of the amnesty agreement
are up," said Baratz. "After those 30
days I don't know what's going to hap
pen."

Evidence of some workers lingering
anger towards fellow workers who
chose to cross the picket lines, scabs,
was seen on a SLAC union bulletin
board last week. According to
Schwartz, a sheet with the pictures of
seven SLAC workers and their names
appeared on the board at SLAC and
other working places with the slogan
"Scabs and herpes are not curable.
Avoid at all costs."
University officials emphasized that
the amnesty agreement is a bilateral
agreement which requires "the Univer
sity or the union not to retaliate against
any worker for participation or non
participation in the strike."

days I don't know what's going to hap
pen."

Evidence of some workers lingering
anger towards fellow workers who
chose to cross the picket lines, scabs,
was seen on a SLAC union bulletin
board last week. According to
Schwartz, a sheet with the pictures of
seven SLAC workers and their names
appeared on the board at SLAC and
other working places with the slogan
"Scabs and herpes are not curable.
Avoid at all costs."
University officials emphasized that
the amnesty agreement is a bilateral
agreement which requires "the Univer
sity or the union not to retaliate against
any worker for participation or non
participation in the strike."

BACK ON THE JOB: A week has passed since the USW strike settlement,
but University workers still harbor bitter feelings toward their employers
and the handling of the strike negotiations.
Though United Stanford Workers
(USW) ended their 30-day strike
against the University more than a
week ago, many union members remain
bitter towards University management
and fellow workers who ignored the
strike.
The strike created deep divisions be
tween labor and management here and
was marred by incidents of vandalism,
confrontation and verbal abuse. More
than 25 workers were arrested for van
dalism and related charges.
"The feelings (towards scab workers
and management) are not going to go
away," said Michael Baratz, executive
secretary of USW. "You just don't
forget that easily."
Union officials said at the member
ship meeting last Saturday they were
forced to accept the unfavorable settle
ment because so many workers were re
turning to their jobs. Workers said they
could no longer afford to stay off their
jobs.
Union officials are pinning their
hopes for an increase in union strength
on the upcoming union elections at the
Stanford Hospital. About 1200 service
and maintenance workers will vote
Nov. 5 and 6 on whether to join USW.
The University is urging hospital
workers to vote against joining the
union.
"The hospital will urge employees
not to vote in favor of the union," said
University labor counsel John
Schwartz, adding that he felt the
unionization effort would fail.
"The employees have a right to know
what the facts are," he said. "If the em
ployees only get their facts from the
union, they ought to have the views
from the hospital administration as
well," Schwartz said.
Baratz said the union is putting in a

strong effort toward organizing hospi
tal workers, and both sides said they are
watching the election closely.
Baratz claimed that hospital man
agers will use "dirty tricks" in order to
convince hospital workers to vote
against unionization, although he ad
mitted that these haven't been em
ployed yet.
"There's just an overriding intimida
tion and fear in that hospital all the
time," he said.
While some workers remain bitter
toward management because of the
strike, there have been no new incidents
of vandalism or harrassment since
workers returned to their jobs last
Monday, according to University man
agers.
"Workers have dismissed it from
their minds as sort of a bad dream,"
said Bernard Lighthouse, assistant di
rector of personnel at SLAC, "Things
are very quiet and we haven't had any
labor difficulties at all."
James Horgan, head of operations
and maintenance said that he was sur
prised striking workers who returned to
their jobs showed no outward signs of
bitterness.
"The strike is not even an issue. It's
almost as if it never happened," he said.
"It's really kind of surprises me that
things are at such a low level. Are they
angry with the negotiating team? Are
they unhappy with the senior man
agement? Are they unhappy with their
■ own union? They did not get everything
they were trying to get. But I don't
know that they're mad at anybody."
Union officials said that workers
were only hiding their anger because
they are still subject to disciplinary ac
tion for any misconduct during the
strike. The amnesty agreement in the
final contract states that employees will
be subject to disciplinary action for any
act of vandalism, violence or other
gross misconduct for 30 calendar days

after the strike.
Schwartz explained that University
negotiatiors chose the 30-day period be
cause they believed that "any aftermath
there should occur within 30 days."
The University is now considering
taking disciplinary action against "a
small number" of workers, according
to University labor counsel Priscilla
Wheeler.
"On the day-to-day relations people
have been asked to be cool at least until
the 30 days of the amnesty agreement
are up," said Baratz. "After those 30
days I don't know what's going to hap
pen."
