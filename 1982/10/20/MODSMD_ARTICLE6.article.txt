## Music prof, still finds time to help beginning students 
### FELICIA LEE 
As a teacher of music for over 25 years,
Stanford professor Wolfgang Kuhn has
had the opportunity to conduct or
chestras, record concerts by such promi
nent musicians as Igor Stravinsky, and to
work on the development of the first stere
ophonic tape recording.
Yet even despite his commitment to
such projects, Kuhn still finds plenty of
time and enthusiasm for sharing his
knowledge of music with the laypeople of
the Stanford community.
The German-born professor, who came
to Stanford in 1958 after serving as chair
man of the Music Education Department
at the University of Colorado, said he
finds the teaching of music courses to
those new to the study of music "an in
teresting challenge" which he enjoys very
much. He is eager to point out that Stan
ford's music department offers many
classes in listening, literature and theory
for the general student as well as for the
music major.
One of his many teaching activities a

far cry from teaching accomplished music
majors involves hosting violin work
shops for children as young as three years
old. These students, though obviously too
young to understand music theory, are not
too young to experience a love for music
and for performing.
"They come out on stage with their
bows and they're just happy to show what
they know," Kuhn said enthusiastically.
Music for Kuhn is not merely a form of
diversion, but an important part of educa
tion. He decries the current trend in educa
tion in which the arts have been de-em
phasized in favor of more "practical" sub
jects.
"When you look around, what is being
cut out in school systems are things like art
education and music, which they call frills
but should be part of a liberal education,"
he said.
Despite this trend, however, Kuhn finds
that musicians entering Stanford today
are "unquestionably better prepared"
than were their counterparts 20 years ago.

Non-music majors, too, he said, now seem
to take a greater interest in "hands on"
music courses, such as music theory, while
students seeking introductory courses in
the past have generally opted for music ap
preciation classes.
"Students now are more concerned with
'how-to' courses. They want to find out
how music is organized, what are the ele
ments of music, how they can be used
creatively, and what kind of skills can be
developed," he said.
Despite the slight decline in the size and
popularity of music programs across the
country, Kuhn sees much promise and
chance for the fields of music and music
education in the future. New methods of
teaching music, such as the Suzuki method
for teaching violin and the Kodaly method
of music education, which Kuhn helped
introduce to the United States, are gaining
popularity and show much promise for
use of the university level.
The use of computers in the teaching of
music, too, is another innovation which
Kuhn feels would improve music educa

tion. Kuhn, who has an interest in technol
ogy as well as music, developed the com
puter program for music education used
here at Stanford, and he sees the spread of
computer use in all fields of study as in
evitable.
He emphasized, however, that "the
machines will never replace the teacher,
but it augments what the teacher can do."
The music computer here, for example,
helps students run basic ear-training and
keyboard drill by themselves, freeing the
teacher to concentrate more time with the
students on other aspects of music study.
Although Kuhn will be retiring just
before the Music Department's move
from the Knoll to the Braun Music Center
near White Plaza, he plans to continue his
work with computers for the teaching of
music. He sees the change in location of
the Music Department as a move for the
better.
"Here in the Knoll students feel some
what isolated . . . down there, we'll be
right in the warp and woof of things."
