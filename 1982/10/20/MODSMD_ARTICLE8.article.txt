# Religious groups on campus: a look at the ecumenical ministries
## 
### MERI McCOY 
The following article is the first of a three
part series on religious organizations on cam
pus. Today's installment will examine the
Stanford Associate Ministries (SAM), a
group to which all university religious groups
must belong, and the Ecumenical Ministries
at Stanford. Tomorrow, a look at the evangel
ical organizations here, while the last segment
will address Stanford's other ministries.
Religious ministries affect all facets of
life at Stanford, though the fact is not well
publicized. Religious services are only part
of campus ministries activities, with much
energy being devoted to building caring
communities and helping people with moral
and theological studies. A variety of campus
ministries are committed to fulfilling the en
tire community's spiritual needs.
All ministries on campus are required to
belong to the Stanford Associated Min
istries (SAM) and many / cooperate ex
tensively to reach as much of the community
as possible. All of the ministries stress that
they welcome anyone who is interested.
Members of SAM must sign agreements
saying that they respect each others' min
istries, and honor the religious traditions as
well as the human dignity of all individuals.
"We are scrupuously devoted to religious
freedoms," emphasized Don Caughey, as
sistant dean of Memorial Church. "The con
duct of religious groups on campus needs to
respect others' religious rights."
"Campus ministries are not here to force
students to (attend) church," he assured.
"They are here to help with faith."
Caughey said he feels questions, doubt
and imagination are essential parts of faith
and campus ministries are sensitive to these
areas. Ministries working in the University
environment have a duty to raise moral and
ethical questions as part of the learning ex
perience of the community, he said.
A spirit of caring and a sense of purpose
should be present in campus ministries,
Caughey said.
According to Caughey, campus ministries
are aware of the diversity and autonomy of
student life, which can cause loneliness.
They try to remind students of religion's cen

tral role to human life, and help them with
their struggles.
Four of the campus ministries the
Catholic Newman Center, United Campus
Christian Ministry, the Episcopal Fellow
ship at Stanford, and the Stanford Lutheran
Center are involved in a team ecumenical
ministry which serves over 2000 students,
staff and faculty. They sponsor discussions,
conferences, seminars, field trips and Bible
studies. According to Caughey, the team

works because there is the right chemistry
between the chaplains.
There are differences in theology, but as
Associate Pastor of the Newman Center
Father Dennis Browne, explained it, "We
have many of the same principles. We are
trying to apply Christianity to life in the
world."
Reverend Phil Wiehe, chaplain of the
Episcopal Fellowship added, "We don't
push dogma."
Each ministry also offers separate pro
grams. The Episcopal Fellowship meets for
worship and a lunch discussion each Tues
day. Bible studies, retreats and other types of

fellowships are available as well. The mail
ing list includes 200 people.
"The present economic situation and the
arms race are providing people with an op
portunity to think seriously of the future.
People are thinking about their vocations
and the purpose of their lives," explained
Wiehe. "Religion copes with the answers to
these questions."
The quality of the ministry is the key in the
Episcopal Fellowship. Wiehe compared the

ministry's individual approach to the way
Jesus fed one person at a time. "We try to do
the same with faith and spirit. Ministry is
not about numbers; it is feeding one to one,"
Wiehe added.
This personalized attention characterizes
Wiehe's work. In addition to his many duties
as chaplain and leader of religious drama
both for the Stanford ecumenical program
and for the national Episcopalian Organiza
tion of Drama, he spends much of his time in
informal counseling. Part of the time is spent
dealing with crises, but he also devotes time
building relationships with students.
Like many of the campus ministries, the

Episcopal Fellowship supports local par
ishes and Memorial Church. It has no ac
tivities on Sunday, so students can get in
volved in area churches. It is also similar to
most of the other ministries in that the fund
ing for the program comes largely from off
campus local parishes.
Another member of the ecumenical min
istries, the Catholic Newman center, uses the
liturgy as the centerpiece for its activities.
Mass is held on campus every day, including

a Mass in Memorial Church on Sunday. So
cial gatherings, Bible studies, intramurals
and discussions are also sponsored by the
center.
"I think we have built a community here,
a warm home where we can share beliefs,"
explained Father Browne. He feels students
need to share convictions, and that they like
"the regular presence of a priest on cam
pus."
The center recently added a program in an
effort to brings its ministry to the dorms and
closer to the students. "RALPH (Rapping
About Life, People and Hamburgers) is not

just a Bible study," assured Browne, be
cause the Bible doesn't ask all the questions,
so it can't have all the answers." The Bible
has some part in it, but students are also able
to discuss their questions, their faith, their
problems and their searching.
Students have many types of conflicts
ranging from identity problems to beliefs
and morals. "Students are sharing questions
a real search about what beliefs and life
mean," Browne added. He said that the an
swers are not all in black and white there
must be room for the gray areas of life.
The Stanford Lutheran Center is based
off-campus, but it works closely with Stan
ford students. It aims to retain its Lutheran
identity while aiding the ecumenical pro
gram. A Sunday morning service with
communion every Sunday lunches and
potluck dinners are a few of the many ac
tivities for the 40 students who regularly at
tend the program.
United Campus Christian Ministry
( UCCM .) is the one group that can't be
anything but ecumenical, since it represents
the United Presbyterians, the United Meth
odists, the Church of Christ and the Ameri
can Baptists. It is a network of various or
ganizations, projects and interests that
works with nine local churches.
" UCCM deals with the responsibilities
and obligations of being a Christian today
and what that means today," states Byron
Bland, staff member for UCCM .
UCCM focuses on the connection be
tween personal beliefs and political action
from those beliefs. This connection allows
one to explore the responsibilities of being a
Christian, and how to deal with important
theological and ethical questions.
"We try to provide a bridge between the
University, society and the church. We want
to raise concerns about poverty, the arms
race and national security," Bland added.
He believes that students are becoming more
open to these types of social responsibilities.
According to Bland, theology is not a set
of answers to prescribed questions, but help
for the struggle of faith.
"Faith is trust in the possibilities of God
in our midst," he concluded.

Another member of the ecumenical min
istries, the Catholic Newman center, uses the
liturgy as the centerpiece for its activities.
Mass is held on campus every day, including

a Mass in Memorial Church on Sunday. So
cial gatherings, Bible studies, intramurals
and discussions are also sponsored by the
center.
"I think we have built a community here,
a warm home where we can share beliefs,"
explained Father Browne. He feels students
need to share convictions, and that they like
"the regular presence of a priest on cam
pus."
The center recently added a program in an
effort to brings its ministry to the dorms and
closer to the students. "RALPH (Rapping
About Life, People and Hamburgers) is not

just a Bible study," assured Browne, be
cause the Bible doesn't ask all the questions,
so it can't have all the answers." The Bible
has some part in it, but students are also able
to discuss their questions, their faith, their
problems and their searching.
Students have many types of conflicts
ranging from identity problems to beliefs
and morals. "Students are sharing questions
a real search about what beliefs and life
mean," Browne added. He said that the an
swers are not all in black and white there
must be room for the gray areas of life.
The Stanford Lutheran Center is based
off-campus, but it works closely with Stan
ford students. It aims to retain its Lutheran
identity while aiding the ecumenical pro
gram. A Sunday morning service with
communion every Sunday lunches and
potluck dinners are a few of the many ac
tivities for the 40 students who regularly at
tend the program.
United Campus Christian Ministry
( UCCM .) is the one group that can't be
anything but ecumenical, since it represents
the United Presbyterians, the United Meth
odists, the Church of Christ and the Ameri
can Baptists. It is a network of various or
ganizations, projects and interests that
works with nine local churches.
" UCCM deals with the responsibilities
and obligations of being a Christian today
and what that means today," states Byron
Bland, staff member for UCCM .
UCCM focuses on the connection be
tween personal beliefs and political action
from those beliefs. This connection allows
one to explore the responsibilities of being a
Christian, and how to deal with important
theological and ethical questions.
"We try to provide a bridge between the
University, society and the church. We want
to raise concerns about poverty, the arms
race and national security," Bland added.
He believes that students are becoming more
open to these types of social responsibilities.
According to Bland, theology is not a set
of answers to prescribed questions, but help
for the struggle of faith.
"Faith is trust in the possibilities of God
in our midst," he concluded.

The following article is the first of a three
part series on religious organizations on cam
pus. Today's installment will examine the
Stanford Associate Ministries (SAM), a
group to which all university religious groups
must belong, and the Ecumenical Ministries
at Stanford. Tomorrow, a look at the evangel
ical organizations here, while the last segment
will address Stanford's other ministries.
Religious ministries affect all facets of
life at Stanford, though the fact is not well
publicized. Religious services are only part
of campus ministries activities, with much
energy being devoted to building caring
communities and helping people with moral
and theological studies. A variety of campus
ministries are committed to fulfilling the en
tire community's spiritual needs.
All ministries on campus are required to
belong to the Stanford Associated Min
istries (SAM) and many / cooperate ex
tensively to reach as much of the community
as possible. All of the ministries stress that
they welcome anyone who is interested.
Members of SAM must sign agreements
saying that they respect each others' min
istries, and honor the religious traditions as
well as the human dignity of all individuals.
"We are scrupuously devoted to religious
freedoms," emphasized Don Caughey, as
sistant dean of Memorial Church. "The con
duct of religious groups on campus needs to
respect others' religious rights."
"Campus ministries are not here to force
students to (attend) church," he assured.
"They are here to help with faith."
Caughey said he feels questions, doubt
and imagination are essential parts of faith
and campus ministries are sensitive to these
areas. Ministries working in the University
environment have a duty to raise moral and
ethical questions as part of the learning ex
perience of the community, he said.
A spirit of caring and a sense of purpose
should be present in campus ministries,
Caughey said.
According to Caughey, campus ministries
are aware of the diversity and autonomy of
student life, which can cause loneliness.
They try to remind students of religion's cen

tral role to human life, and help them with
their struggles.
Four of the campus ministries the
Catholic Newman Center, United Campus
Christian Ministry, the Episcopal Fellow
ship at Stanford, and the Stanford Lutheran
Center are involved in a team ecumenical
ministry which serves over 2000 students,
staff and faculty. They sponsor discussions,
conferences, seminars, field trips and Bible
studies. According to Caughey, the team

works because there is the right chemistry
between the chaplains.
There are differences in theology, but as
Associate Pastor of the Newman Center
Father Dennis Browne, explained it, "We
have many of the same principles. We are
trying to apply Christianity to life in the
world."
Reverend Phil Wiehe, chaplain of the
Episcopal Fellowship added, "We don't
push dogma."
Each ministry also offers separate pro
grams. The Episcopal Fellowship meets for
worship and a lunch discussion each Tues
day. Bible studies, retreats and other types of

fellowships are available as well. The mail
ing list includes 200 people.
"The present economic situation and the
arms race are providing people with an op
portunity to think seriously of the future.
People are thinking about their vocations
and the purpose of their lives," explained
Wiehe. "Religion copes with the answers to
these questions."
The quality of the ministry is the key in the
Episcopal Fellowship. Wiehe compared the

ministry's individual approach to the way
Jesus fed one person at a time. "We try to do
the same with faith and spirit. Ministry is
not about numbers; it is feeding one to one,"
Wiehe added.
This personalized attention characterizes
Wiehe's work. In addition to his many duties
as chaplain and leader of religious drama
both for the Stanford ecumenical program
and for the national Episcopalian Organiza
tion of Drama, he spends much of his time in
informal counseling. Part of the time is spent
dealing with crises, but he also devotes time
building relationships with students.
Like many of the campus ministries, the

Episcopal Fellowship supports local par
ishes and Memorial Church. It has no ac
tivities on Sunday, so students can get in
volved in area churches. It is also similar to
most of the other ministries in that the fund
ing for the program comes largely from off
campus local parishes.
