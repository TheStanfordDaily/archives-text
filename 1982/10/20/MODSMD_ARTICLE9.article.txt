# Yet another year, yet another 'new look' for LSJUMB
## 
### KENNETH LO 
By most people's standards, Stantord does not have a
marching band. The band doesn't even march. It doesn't
play marching music. It doesn't plan its formations
weeks, months or even six days ahead of performances.
Maybe that's why the band members call themselves the
Incomparable Leland Stanford Junior University
Marching Band (LSJUMB).
"Don't try to compare us," says Stanford Band man
ager John Howard. "Enjoy us on our own level." The
Stanford Band is like no other band anywhere.
The most promimv.it difference is the Band's method
of changing formations, a process called "scattering,"
which entails the players quickly running from one pre
assigned position to the next. Adequately describing scat
tering is difficult one must see it to comprehend it. Im
agine a handful of red marbles dropped onto a green
floor, scattering in all directions into, by some incon
ceivable magic or luck, some intelligible formation.
That's what "scattering" looks like from a stadium seat.
After the Band has settled into its formation and begins
playing, you quickly notice another difference. This 144-
member marching band is playing rock and roll, the same
songs students might have blasted from their stereos the
night before. In fact, one magazine called LSJUMB "un
doubtedly the largest rock 'n roll band in the world."
LSJUMB also is known for its pre-game and half-time
shows. In the past the Band has performed a tribute to
Patty Hearst the members formed "two buns with no
Patty in it," a tribute to Mao three days after his death,
a show which brought in hate mail criticizing the Band
for either attacking or glorifying Mao, and last year at
USC, in its unpredictable manner, a salute to office sup
plies. Each Monday before a performance the Stanford
Marching Unit Thinkers (known affectionately as
SMUT), a group of Band members, meet for several
hours to develop such themes and formations for the up
coming show.
While not on the field, the Band can usually be found in
the Band Shack (or Shak), which is as eccentric as the
players. Walking into the Shack and the Band's practice
room, one first notices the myriad of road signs adorning
the walls. Signs such as "Gerald Ford's Birthplace,"
"Lovelock 69," and "CIA Next Right" have been part of
the American Highway decor. The Band's cheerleaders,
the dollies Sue Cameron, Betsy DePalma, Diana
Dobbs, Gina Moreno and Melinda Myers practice in
the mirrored Dollie Room, and SMUT has its sessions on
Michelob Terrace, featuring beer on tap.

Being a Band member requires devotion as well as an
eccentric personality. Three days a week, the players meet
for practice either in the Band Shak or at Angell Field.
Beyond practice and game performances, the members
often play at rallies for local corporations such as Syntex
or Northwestern Mutual. Income from the rallies help
the Band pay for expenses. Altogether, a Band member
can expect to put in 14 to 16 hours each week.
Since LSJUMB's formation 19 years ago, the Band has
been the center of controversy. In 1963, Stanford's mili
tary marching band went on strike after the band director
Jules Schucat was fired. Dr. Arthur Barnes, hired as
the Director of Bands at Stanford, allowed the students

to manage the band, which became LSJUMB. Barnes re
mains the director and arranges much of the Band's mu
sic.
However, the Band recently has received increasing
amounts of serious criticism. In years past, according to
Howard, the Band developed the image of "a group that
couldn't be trusted," after pulling down their pants to re
veal surfer shorts on national television and forming the
CBS logo while being televised on ABC. Last year, says
drummer Bart Garton, "was the culmination of years
past." The Band had strayed away from good music.
Howard describes the last several years as a cycle. Ori

ginally, the Band's first priority was to perform quality
music. The members' spontaneity came naturally, but re
mained a secondary concern. u Then a lot of ringers (indi
viduals who are better at being spontaneous than playing
instruments) came in," Howard said, "and the Band's or
ganization and cohesiveness decayed."
"Last year was the peak of needing cleaning up," said
saxophonist Jennifer Flattery. The band received greater
amounts of hate mail, especially after a ringer rolled on
the ground while wearing an American flag.
"Our image was really tarnished by ringers," said
Howard.
The new band administration recognized the newly ac
quired image and decided that "the band should get back
its audience." In conference during the spring, the Band's
leaders and University officials concluded that
LSJUMB's essential character and goals were not at
fault, but that the Band had merely "veered off the right
track" and should return to its original goals.
"There are going to be changes," said Howard. "We
want to keep our style. We want to keep our looseness."
The Band is working hardest at improving the quality of
sound. "We're trying to bring the Band back to where
music is the number one priority," says Howard com
pleting the Band's cycle.
According to various members, while the number of
prospective Band members fell this year, the quality of
musicians increased. And the decision to eliminate
ringers has guaranteed higher quality of players. Drum
mer Andy Engle summarizes the Band's actions as "in
stilling a lot of'musicality.' "
The Band's second priority is its shows. While, in the
past, the Band concentrated almost solely on political
satire, SMUT is now trying to develop good, fun shows.
Instead of the theme taking priority, music and in
trinsically funny formations, such as a skipping record
player or a stereo tuner with easy listening and Spanish
stations, form the basis of the band's shows. "We're just
trying to be more original," Garton said, "more original
as possible and more clever. That's our appeal."
Finally, the Band seeks not only to entertain, but also
to gain crowd support of the football team." "We're not
trying to upstage the team," says Howard. "If the crowd
isn't behind the team, the team has no reason to play ex
cept to satisfy itself."
"We're trying to reverse the inertia that's built up
against us," Howard continued. He expects a positive
future for the Band and wants "to get people to look at

Between 3 and 6 p.m. today, the Band will record an
album at Frost Amphitheatre. The recording session is open
to the public: in fact, the Band is encouraging an audience
to form.
Led by Drum Major "Disco" Ray Gruenwald, the entire
Band will perform approximately 18 songs, including All
Right Now and Dr. Arthur Barnes' version of The Star
Spangled Banner which Barnes himself will conduct. The
remainder of the songs will be different from those per
formed on the Band's previous records.
The Band has been preparing for this album since the be
ginning of the year. Freshman band members had to learn
more than 15 songs during the past month. In the past two
days, professional sound engineers have worked with the
Band to prepare for the recording.
The album will debut at Christmastime. No title has yet
been announced.

Jules Schucat was fired. Dr. Arthur Barnes, hired as
the Director of Bands at Stanford, allowed the students

to manage the band, which became LSJUMB. Barnes re
mains the director and arranges much of the Band's mu
sic.
However, the Band recently has received increasing
amounts of serious criticism. In years past, according to
Howard, the Band developed the image of "a group that
couldn't be trusted," after pulling down their pants to re
veal surfer shorts on national television and forming the
CBS logo while being televised on ABC. Last year, says
drummer Bart Garton, "was the culmination of years
past." The Band had strayed away from good music.
Howard describes the last several years as a cycle. Ori

ginally, the Band's first priority was to perform quality
music. The members' spontaneity came naturally, but re
mained a secondary concern. u Then a lot of ringers (indi
viduals who are better at being spontaneous than playing
instruments) came in," Howard said, "and the Band's or
ganization and cohesiveness decayed."
"Last year was the peak of needing cleaning up," said
saxophonist Jennifer Flattery. The band received greater
amounts of hate mail, especially after a ringer rolled on
the ground while wearing an American flag.
"Our image was really tarnished by ringers," said
Howard.
The new band administration recognized the newly ac
quired image and decided that "the band should get back
its audience." In conference during the spring, the Band's
leaders and University officials concluded that
LSJUMB's essential character and goals were not at
fault, but that the Band had merely "veered off the right
track" and should return to its original goals.
"There are going to be changes," said Howard. "We
want to keep our style. We want to keep our looseness."
The Band is working hardest at improving the quality of
sound. "We're trying to bring the Band back to where
music is the number one priority," says Howard com
pleting the Band's cycle.
According to various members, while the number of
prospective Band members fell this year, the quality of
musicians increased. And the decision to eliminate
ringers has guaranteed higher quality of players. Drum
mer Andy Engle summarizes the Band's actions as "in
stilling a lot of'musicality.' "
The Band's second priority is its shows. While, in the
past, the Band concentrated almost solely on political
satire, SMUT is now trying to develop good, fun shows.
Instead of the theme taking priority, music and in
trinsically funny formations, such as a skipping record
player or a stereo tuner with easy listening and Spanish
stations, form the basis of the band's shows. "We're just
trying to be more original," Garton said, "more original
as possible and more clever. That's our appeal."
Finally, the Band seeks not only to entertain, but also
to gain crowd support of the football team." "We're not
trying to upstage the team," says Howard. "If the crowd
isn't behind the team, the team has no reason to play ex
cept to satisfy itself."
"We're trying to reverse the inertia that's built up
against us," Howard continued. He expects a positive
future for the Band and wants "to get people to look at

Between 3 and 6 p.m. today, the Band will record an
album at Frost Amphitheatre. The recording session is open
to the public: in fact, the Band is encouraging an audience
to form.
Led by Drum Major "Disco" Ray Gruenwald, the entire
Band will perform approximately 18 songs, including All
Right Now and Dr. Arthur Barnes' version of The Star
Spangled Banner which Barnes himself will conduct. The
remainder of the songs will be different from those per
formed on the Band's previous records.
The Band has been preparing for this album since the be
ginning of the year. Freshman band members had to learn
more than 15 songs during the past month. In the past two
days, professional sound engineers have worked with the
Band to prepare for the recording.
The album will debut at Christmastime. No title has yet
been announced.

By most people's standards, Stantord does not have a
marching band. The band doesn't even march. It doesn't
play marching music. It doesn't plan its formations
weeks, months or even six days ahead of performances.
Maybe that's why the band members call themselves the
Incomparable Leland Stanford Junior University
Marching Band (LSJUMB).
"Don't try to compare us," says Stanford Band man
ager John Howard. "Enjoy us on our own level." The
Stanford Band is like no other band anywhere.
The most promimv.it difference is the Band's method
of changing formations, a process called "scattering,"
which entails the players quickly running from one pre
assigned position to the next. Adequately describing scat
tering is difficult one must see it to comprehend it. Im
agine a handful of red marbles dropped onto a green
floor, scattering in all directions into, by some incon
ceivable magic or luck, some intelligible formation.
That's what "scattering" looks like from a stadium seat.
After the Band has settled into its formation and begins
playing, you quickly notice another difference. This 144-
member marching band is playing rock and roll, the same
songs students might have blasted from their stereos the
night before. In fact, one magazine called LSJUMB "un
doubtedly the largest rock 'n roll band in the world."
LSJUMB also is known for its pre-game and half-time
shows. In the past the Band has performed a tribute to
Patty Hearst the members formed "two buns with no
Patty in it," a tribute to Mao three days after his death,
a show which brought in hate mail criticizing the Band
for either attacking or glorifying Mao, and last year at
USC, in its unpredictable manner, a salute to office sup
plies. Each Monday before a performance the Stanford
Marching Unit Thinkers (known affectionately as
SMUT), a group of Band members, meet for several
hours to develop such themes and formations for the up
coming show.
While not on the field, the Band can usually be found in
the Band Shack (or Shak), which is as eccentric as the
players. Walking into the Shack and the Band's practice
room, one first notices the myriad of road signs adorning
the walls. Signs such as "Gerald Ford's Birthplace,"
"Lovelock 69," and "CIA Next Right" have been part of
the American Highway decor. The Band's cheerleaders,
the dollies Sue Cameron, Betsy DePalma, Diana
Dobbs, Gina Moreno and Melinda Myers practice in
the mirrored Dollie Room, and SMUT has its sessions on
Michelob Terrace, featuring beer on tap.

Being a Band member requires devotion as well as an
eccentric personality. Three days a week, the players meet
for practice either in the Band Shak or at Angell Field.
Beyond practice and game performances, the members
often play at rallies for local corporations such as Syntex
or Northwestern Mutual. Income from the rallies help
the Band pay for expenses. Altogether, a Band member
can expect to put in 14 to 16 hours each week.

Band will perform approximately 18 songs, including All
Right Now and Dr. Arthur Barnes' version of The Star
Spangled Banner which Barnes himself will conduct. The
remainder of the songs will be different from those per

days, professional sound engineers have worked with the
Band to prepare for the recording.
The album will debut at Christmastime. No title has yet
been announced.
