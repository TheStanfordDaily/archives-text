ji:
MODEL SR3IOO *350°° I
1. Excellent electronic design with high specifications.
2. Has separate mid-range controls, as well as standard bass 8c treble
controls.
3. In stereo receivers, total harmonic distortion is audible when above .1%,
but this Marantz is wav below that level at both 4 ohms and 8 ohms.
4 Has tuning meter and Dual Wattaae Meters.
5. Rear Jacks: Certified 24K Gold Plated. (Gold will not corrode or rust as
base metal can; and aold provides a much better electrical contact.)
6. Three year service policy.
7. Can be used with 4 ohm, 8 ohm, or 16 ohm speakers.
8. Marantz Co. headquarters are located at 20525 Nordhoff St., Chatsworth,

In our opinion, the MARANTZ is far superior to the Yamaha; but we realize
that not everyone can afford a MARANTZ. Thus, If you're short of cash, buy
the Yamaha now, and then when you can afford It, TRADE UP TO MARANTZ.
