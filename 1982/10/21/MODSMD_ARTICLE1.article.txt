educated," she said, "but we don't
know how true that is." She said that at
committee activities a surprising
number of people were "totally unin
formed" on the issue.
Jaffe feels the local vote will hinge on
how many people her organization can
contact before the election. She esti
mated that they have been able to reach

On campus, the nuclcar freeze issue
has been much less visible this fall than
it was last spring, when a freeze referen
dum placed on the spring ASSU ballot
was passed by 85 percent of the student
body. That will probably change as the
election approaches, beginning with
this weekend's "Inter/national
In/security in the Nuclear Age" con
ference in Dinkelspiel Auditorium,
which will kick off Residential Educa
tion's "Fate of the Earth Week." The
Saturday event will begin with morning
talks on the arms race and nuclear
weapons policy, and continue in the af
ternoon with workshops and an ap
pearance by a Soviet peace delegation.
"Fate of the Earth Week" activities,
which will take place in student
dormitories, will include talks by facul
ty members and showings of films and
videotapes, according to Alice Supton,
assistant dean of residential education.
On Sunday, physicist Edward Teller
will speak in Manzanita Court, and lat
er speakers will include Drell and
SLAC Director Wolfgang Panofsky.
Political Science Prof. Hubert
Marshall, who will be delivering several
dormitory talks next week, said that his
being asked to speak indicates to him an
increased awareness from a year ago.
Marshall supports Proposition 12, and
while he agrees that the letters will have
"no effect at all," he feels that if the
measure passes by a large margin "it
will be a political statement not easily
ignored by the Reagan adminis
tration."
According to Supton, "Fate of the
Earth Week" was intentionally timed to
precede the Proposition 12 vote. She
said Res Ed has distributed a poster for
this weekend's conference and position
papers of the speakers involved to every
student in the dormitories, and "stu
dents have been talking about it." She
said Res Ed has been showing the
videotape The Last Epidemic, an
analysis of the effects of a nuclear ex
plosion over San Francisco, in
dormitories and the tape has prompted
"strong expressions of concern for the
issue" among students.
John Mattox, a graduate student in
applied physics and director of the
Stanford Arms Control and Disarma
ment Forum, an educational group,
thinks students "don't think they can
have an effect" in the area of arms con
trol. He said that in activities organized
by his group he has found "most stu
dents are concerned and by and large
favor .. . the freeze," but "they don't
seem concerned enough to do anything
about it."
