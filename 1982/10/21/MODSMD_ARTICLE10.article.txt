# U.S.-China detente backsliding
## 
### 
Compiled from news reports and wire services
United States relations can be described by the Chinese saying:
"Loud thunder, little rain," Huang Hua, Chinese foreign minister,
complained recently.
The remark is typical of the kind of dissatisfaction that some Chi
nese government officials have been expressing over U.S. relations
with Taiwan and other issues.
The Chinese are particularly disturbed by the continuing U.S. sup
port for Taiwan. The Sino-U.S. communique released in August was
supposed to help resolve this issue. But the Chinese have made it clear
that they are not satisfied.
Huang, speaking before the Chinese council on foreign relations
two weeks ago, also accused the United States of intensifying dis
crimination against China in trade relations and in cultural ex
changes. He also criticized U.S. restrictions on the export of high tech
nology and sophisticated equipment to China.
"In view of recent developments," he said, "one cannot help but
asking: Does the United States government regard China as a friend
or an adversary?"
Huang's remarks were published by the Chinese news agency
Xinhua.
They come at a time when the Chinese have been showing interest in
improving relations with the Soviet Union, which U.S. officials have

been watching carefully.
The Reagan administration is expected to name a new assistant sec
retary of state for East Asian affairs soon, to replace John Holdridge,
recently selected as the new ambassador to Indonesia. Decisions on
U.S. trade relations, particularly oil exploration and advanced tech
nology exports, are expected soon.
But in the meantime, U.S.-China relations seem to be in a state of
limbo. Some officials feel that in its attempts to put relations with the
Soviet Union on a more equal footing with the United States, China is
maneuvering for a better negotiating position with each of them.
But most U.S.-China watchers have rejected this view. They say
that China's public pronouncements on better relations with the Sovi
ets could be part of factional infighting in Peking. These sources quote
Chinese statements citing the primacy of Peking's ties with Washing
ton.
But in light of Huang's comments, such a view may be too op
timistic. Chinese officials have indicated that they expect a change in
relations with Moscow, and talks between the two countries are now
going on. Foreign diplomats have cautioned that U.S. policymakers
should be prepared for announcements that the two countries are
about to conduct more exchanges.
