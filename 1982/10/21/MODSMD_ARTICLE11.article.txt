### MERI McCOY Second in a series 
The three evangelical min
istries on campus —
Navigators, Campus Crusade
for Christ and The Stanford
Christian Fellowship, In
tervarsity — share many of
the same beliefs, though each
has a distinctive focus.
"The evangelical groups
work closely together," com
mented Dave Horner, staff

worker for Campus Crusade
for Christ. "We are unified,
and there is no competition
between the groups."
He added that they are tied
closely to Stanford As
sociated Ministries and are
committed to cooperating in
. the religious life of the com
munity.
"We present people with
. the option of a relationship
■with Jesus Christ to in
telligently make a choice,"
said Elizabeth Berg, staff
worker of the Navigators.
•."For those who make the
choice, we try to make faith
.■.come alive in daily situ
ations."
!..j The Navigators have Bible
. studies, fellowship and social
situations, but most of the at
tention is on one-to-one com
. munication.
Berg asserted that the
Navigators try to demon
strate that their beliefs don't
need to be pushed because
they can stand on their own
merits. The Navigators' goal
is for students to be working
- with their peers, so they don't
have to be tied to a large
group.
"Our members tend to be
self-starters, with more in

itiative than the average per
son. They usually really want
to grow as a Christian," he
said.
Campus Crusade for
Christ, however, emphasizes
discipleship in small groups.
"We are committed to helping
people to understand how to
know Jesus Christ in a person
al way," Horner explained.
Activities of Campus
Crusade include Bible studies
and a weekly fellowship meet
ing, Prime Time. A large
monthly meeting called Col
lege Life presents issues such
as dating and success from a
Christian perspective.
Campus Crusade also
sponsors speakers and pro
grams which expose students
to Christian beliefs. Josh
McDowell, a well-known
evangelist who speaks about

Campus Crusade
works with
churches, but is
more autonomous
than a group
connected
primarily with a
church.

the historical evidence of
Christ's resurrection, was
sponsored and promoted by
Campus Crusade on a visit to
Stanford last spring. Though
the methods used in promot
ing McDowell's visit were
controversial, even among
other leaders of campus min
istries, Campus Crusade was
successful in drawing a large
audience to the event.
Most of the people involved
in Campus Crusade are stu
dents, but the group is seeking
to have more ministry to fac
ulty and staff. Campus
Crusade works with churches,
but is more autonomous than
a group connected primarily
with a church.
According to Horner, stu
dents are more of a
homogeneous group than a
group in a larger community,

and have more of the "move
ment mentality." This allows
them a chance to respond
more readily to the activities
of Campus Crusade.
"We are more com
mitted to evangelism than
some of the other groups on
campus," said a member of
Campus Crusade. "We'd like
everyone to make an in
telligent choice about Christ
one way or another."
Campus Crusade is con
nected to an international or
ganization that has ministries
in over 50 nations. Unlike
most of the other members of
the associated ministries, it is
funded primarily by students
and a few members of the
community.
Intervaristy is the other ma
jor evangelical group on cam
pus. "We try to understand
what it means to be followcts
of Jesus amidst all of the pres
sure of life at Stanford," Greg
Read, staff worker of In
tervarsity said.
A prayer meeting every
weekday at noon, Bible stud
ies, weekly large group meet
ings, conferences, speakers
and social action services are
all held in this context of
trying to put faith into action.

'Because of the size
ofl.V.,itisa
necessity for
students to take
major
responsibilities
which may not be
present in other
groups because of
the availability of
paid staff'

Intervarsity also sponsors
large events which present the
Christian faith to the larger
community.
The 20 Bible studies it spon
sors are led by non-staff mem
bers. "Because of the size of
1.V., it is a necessity for stu
dents to take major responsi
bilities which may not be pres
ent in other groups"because of

The three evangelical min
istries on campus —
Navigators, Campus Crusade
for Christ and The Stanford
Christian Fellowship, In
tervarsity — share many of
the same beliefs, though each
has a distinctive focus.
"The evangelical groups
work closely together," com
mented Dave Horner, staff

worker for Campus Crusade
for Christ. "We are unified,
and there is no competition
between the groups."
He added that they are tied
closely to Stanford As
sociated Ministries and are
committed to cooperating in
. the religious life of the com
munity.
"We present people with
. the option of a relationship
■with Jesus Christ to in
telligently make a choice,"
said Elizabeth Berg, staff
worker of the Navigators.
•."For those who make the
choice, we try to make faith
.■.come alive in daily situ
ations."
!..j The Navigators have Bible
. studies, fellowship and social
situations, but most of the at
tention is on one-to-one com
. munication.
Berg asserted that the
Navigators try to demon
strate that their beliefs don't
need to be pushed because
they can stand on their own
merits. The Navigators' goal
is for students to be working
- with their peers, so they don't
have to be tied to a large
group.
"Our members tend to be
self-starters, with more in

itiative than the average per
son. They usually really want
to grow as a Christian," he
said.
Campus Crusade for
Christ, however, emphasizes
discipleship in small groups.
"We are committed to helping
people to understand how to
know Jesus Christ in a person
al way," Horner explained.
Activities of Campus
Crusade include Bible studies
and a weekly fellowship meet
ing, Prime Time. A large
monthly meeting called Col
lege Life presents issues such
as dating and success from a
Christian perspective.
Campus Crusade also
sponsors speakers and pro
grams which expose students
to Christian beliefs. Josh
McDowell, a well-known
evangelist who speaks about

Campus Crusade
works with
churches, but is
more autonomous
than a group
connected
primarily with a
church.

the historical evidence of
Christ's resurrection, was
sponsored and promoted by
Campus Crusade on a visit to
Stanford last spring. Though
the methods used in promot
ing McDowell's visit were
controversial, even among
other leaders of campus min
istries, Campus Crusade was
successful in drawing a large
audience to the event.
Most of the people involved
in Campus Crusade are stu
dents, but the group is seeking
to have more ministry to fac
ulty and staff. Campus
Crusade works with churches,
but is more autonomous than
a group connected primarily
with a church.
According to Horner, stu
dents are more of a
homogeneous group than a
group in a larger community,

and have more of the "move
ment mentality." This allows
them a chance to respond
more readily to the activities
of Campus Crusade.
"We are more com
mitted to evangelism than
some of the other groups on
campus," said a member of
Campus Crusade. "We'd like
everyone to make an in
telligent choice about Christ
one way or another."
Campus Crusade is con
nected to an international or
ganization that has ministries
in over 50 nations. Unlike
most of the other members of
the associated ministries, it is
funded primarily by students
and a few members of the
community.
