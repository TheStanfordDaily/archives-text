## The 						Stanford Daily Closing Cliveden playground 
### 
Last week's announcement by the board of
trustees that the Stanford program in Britain would
finally be transferred to Oxford was some of the
best news we've heard in a long time.
It's not that Cliveden is such a bad place. To the
contrary, the quarter or two spent at Cliveden was,
is and will be the highlight of many an under
graduate's years. Relieved of all but token academ
ic pressures, students at Cliveden are free to leave
the estate and explore Britain or travel the conti
nent for wondrously long weekends — or even for
weeks at a time. When back at Cliveden, they can
choose to roam the huge country estate. More
often, though, they retreat to the close but com
fortable confines of the basement pub to tipple a
pint or so o' bitter courtesy of Eddie, the estate's
bartender for as long as anyone can remember. For
the more adventurous, The Feathers — the
neighborhood pub at which Cliveden students are
infamous for their boisterous revelry — is just a
short walk away.
No wonder then, that Cliveden is one of the Uni
versity's most popular overseas campuses; it, like
the program in Florence, where students live at a
glorious villa, might well be called Stanford in Par
adise.
No matter how heavenly Cliveden is, though, the
University has long had a hell of a time justifying its
existence. Rapidly rising costs of upkeep on the es
tate make the campus there one of the overseas sys
tem's most expensive — which means that tuition
paid elsewhere, at the campuses in Tours and Vien
na, for example — is used to subsidize expenses at
Cliveden.
And Cliveden is not worth subsidizing. The estate
is nearly an hour outside of London by train, which
means that students — even the intrepid few who

even occasionally take advantage of what the city
has to offer — spend all too much of their time on
the estate, consorting with their fellow Stanford
students far more than Londoners or other Eng
lishmen. This tendency of students there to look on
British society only from the outside makes
Cliveden antithetical to what we think an overseas
campus should be — a center of education in which
the notion that learning about society and its cul
ture comes primarily through interaction with its
residents remains paramount.
The situation, needless to say, will be quite dif
ferent when the program in Britain moves to a
group of row houses in the heart of Oxford Univer
sity. Education is almost sure to be far more
challenging than that at Cliveden; although some
courses will be taught by Stanford faculty to Stan
ford students, others will be taught by British aca
demics, and students will be able to enroll in Oxford
lecture courses and tutorial sessions. What's more,
students will be living in a medium-sized city amid
150,000 Britons, a situation very different and far
more desirable than the cultural isolation that pre
vailed in the rural environs of Cliveden.
Stanford will thus soon rid itself of a costly over
seas playround and gain a campus in the heart of
one of the world's foremost universities. The only
bad element in the whole arrangement is that the
move won't come until the fall of 1984, which
means that most of us undergraduates will have to
find another, non-Stanford program if we want to
study in England while at the same time getting a
daily taste of English life.
Selfish views aside, however, only congratula
tions remain. To those who negotiated the transfer
to Oxford, as well as to the board of trustees, which
approved its funding, we say: jolly good show.
