# Autumn...
## 
### 
A news item caught our eye the other day; in pass
ing, it stated we were in the midst of autumn.
We wonder. Yes, the days are a bit shorter, and
the sun sits a little closer to the Dish as it burns
through a slightly thicker haze to bodies acquiring a
final glaze of tan. Admittedly, windshields have an
extra coat of dew in early morning, and thonged
students find their toe-hairs on end occasionally.
These changes may mean the end of summer for a
Southern Californian, but are far from signs of
autumn. Where are the winds, the crispness or the
shock of the first frost? Most important, where are
the dying, colored leaves? Can there be autumn
without orange leaves piled against storm doors,
without overlapping red and yellow leaves pushed
flat against sidewalks by hours-long rain showers
or without dirty, dusky leaves whipped about by
cold — yes, cold — winds? Hardly.
It's rumored that in other parts of the country,
apple cider with cinnamon sticks is standard fare,
sweaters are worn under thick coats, and entire
states await the first snowfall and glaze of ice on lo
cal ponds and creeks. There is a sense of wonder
and waiting, we are told: baring branches hint at

later ice-covered twigs, and the must of decaying
leaves presages the rot below snow that will bear
spring's new growth.
There are shadows of the same sources of wonder
nearby, too, if you're willing to look hard enough.
A line of trees in the parking lot near Maples Pavil
ion (only now an ironic name) is changing color, as
is a grove in College Terrace near Stanford Avenue
— although both seem displaced, shedding leaves
more in bewilderment than with any sense of relief
or momentary abandonment before retreating into
winter's quiet. Cords of wood are stacked near back
entrances of occasional houses, but appear strange
under Spanish-tiled overhangs or next to pre-fab
California condos. Pumpkins are on sale on El
Camino, but seem a plastic orange against the con
crete.
Despite glimpses of a far-off fall, there is no
autumn here. Rather, there is a timeless limbo of
different stengths of sunlight falling on different
shades of green. There is no briskness, no scent of
burning oak, no sign of cycles and regeneration. It
is special to warm in the mid-October sun, but it
isn't the only world of pleasures. It isn't autumn.
