## Choosy voters prefer more effective political ads 
### 
It started as a typical political campaign, and, un
fortunately, it has continued to be only typical. It is a
campaign of insult and defamation. It is the year of
Pete Wilson vs. Jerry Brown, and once again the vot
ers get to decide not who is best suited, but rather
who is least suitable.
The proper focus of a political campaign should
be the attributes of the candidate, rather than the
shortcomings of the opposition. However, the re
cent television and radio ads have shown us little of
what the senatorial candidates stand for. Instead,
they have told us repeatedly only two things the can
didates stand against: each other.
"I don't want to die," says a small child in one
common anti-Wilson commercial. The ad says that
Jerry Brown supports a nuclear freeze, and implies
that Wilson wants to kill children and small wood
land animals.
"Take another look at Jerry Brown. You'll see
him right in your next tax payment," states one anti-
Brown ad, explaining how Brown's incompetence
will cause the voters to pay more taxes.
This type of campaigning has become prevalent in
American politics. Candidates for major political
offices have found it advantageous to point out their
opponent's flaws. This is dangerous.
Imagine what life would be like if other products
ran their advertising campaigns in a similar fashion.
The recent scare involving Extra-Strength
Tylenol could have been used by competitors to
market their own products in the following manner:
"Let's take another look at Extra-Strength
Tylenol. In 1982, seven people died after taking it.
No one has died after taking Bufferin. Take Bufferin
— and live."
Or the situation involving hydrochloric acid in
Murine eye drops: "I don't want to go blind," says a
small child, "that's why I'm taking Visine." Visine
gets the red out, not your corneas.
Such ads, needless to say, would become
tiresome, tasteless and a real turnoff to viewers. The
purpose of advertising would be defeated. Political
ads are approaching this level. If the trend
progresses, we may soon be seeing ads calling Jerry
Brown a Communist and claims that Pete Wilson
causes cancer.
Campaign ads have not always been so bad. In
fact, there have been a number of standard ads that
are relatively harmless yet effective.
A common ad featured candidates in familiar sur
roundings, with family and friends, just like you and
me. Here's good ol' Jerry, playing ball with the boys
at the " Y." Nice shot, Jer. Here's Pete, having a nice
dinner at home. Fried chicken, huh, Pete? Sure

looks great!
The endorsement was another popular campaign
tool. "Hi. This is Billy Martin. You know, I really
like Pete Wilson. He's so honest, he wouldn't even
steal second base. I'd put him up to bat for me any
time. Hit a home run — vote Wilson for Senate,"
Clever ads such as these were contrasted with
straightforward ads showing the candidate in his of
fice, wearing a suit and tie and looking very serious.
The camera would zoom in on the candidate's face
and then he would speak of the merits and ac
complishments of his political history. Assuming, of
course, that his political career has any merits and
accomplishments to speak of.
Admittedly, these old standards lack a certain
flair found in commercial advertising today. How
ever, there is still no need to resort to the mudsling
ing tactics used now. If candidates wish to add more

Picture this: a video screen, alive
with flashing lights. Space
Invaders are being blasted left
and right, and a new high score is
made. The message,
"Congratulations. You f dmake
one hell of a senator 99 appears on
the screen.

pizazz to their campaigns, they would follow some
of the formats used in commercial advertising. For
example:
The hidden camera ad:
Man with mike: "I'll give you $5000 for that
sock."
Surprised lady: "$5000? Sure take it away,
hahaha. Omigod you're tearing it in half!"
Man: "Don't worry it's just to prove a point..."
If this were applied to political ads, the result
might be:
Man with mike: "We've been spying on you. You
took over 45 minutes in that voting booth. Why so
choosy?" *
Surprised lady: "I just want the best for my state.
I've only got one. ha ha ha."
Man: "Well you probably made alt the right
choices. Who got your vote for Senate?
Ladyr. "Oh, Pete Wilson, the leading candidate."

Man: "Let's compare. Here's a picture of Pete
Wilson."
Lady: "Yes, that's Pete all right."
Man: "Now here's picture of Jerry Brown."
Lady: "He has that real senatorial flavor. I want
to change my vote!"
Man: "Choosy mothers choose Jerry Brown."
Or the hard-sell ad.

There are also ads that take advantage of current
social trends. Two examples are the "Dannon
Body" ads, playing on the exercise trend, and the
McDonald's "Taste the Thrill of Atari" contest that
exploits the video game craze.
Picture this: a video screen, alive with flashing
lights. Space Invaders are being blasted left and
right, and a new high score is made. The message,
"Congratulations. You'd make one hell of a sena
tor," appears on the screen. The player then enters
his name — Pete Wilson.
It all else fails, they can always turn to one of the
most widely used and successful tricks of the trade:
subliminal sex. You know, you've seen it—girls lov
ingly putting long, cylindrical lipstick containers to
their mouths, and alcohol ads with ice cubes that
spell out S-E-X.
This could be Jerry Brown's next campaign ad:
"I've thought long and hard about my campaign,
and where its thrust should be. I've come to realize
that the only way I can lick my opponent is to
pounce upon one particular issue, the problem of
this state's penal code. As your senator, I intend to
erect new policy, exploring the sensitive areas of na
tional, state and local law enforcement.
"This problem won't blow over. It will probe into
our lives until someone stands firm against the
whips and chains of bureaucracy. That will be my
role as your senator, an upright pillar shooting to
change current, impotent policies."
With all these options available to them, it's sad
that political candidates have to resort to mud-sling
ing. Once again voters must go to the polls unaware
of the issues, voting only on who is less incompetent.
What's the Libertarian candidate's name again?
