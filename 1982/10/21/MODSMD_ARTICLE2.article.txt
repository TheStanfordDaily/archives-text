F :i| gnmcnt on drug charges in U.S. District Court yesterday.
DeLorean was arraigned on a single charge of conspiracy to
possess cocaine with intent to distribute it. U.S. Magistrate Vol
ney Brown Jr. set bail at $5 million.
During the hearing, an affidavit by FBI Agent Jerry West was
introduced detailing how the agreement between DeLorean and
Drug Enforcement Administration Agent John Valestra was
made during a video-taped meeting Sept. 28 at a hotel in down
town Los Angeles.
During this meeting, the affidavit said, it was agreed that
Valestra would supply 100 kilos of cocaine at $50,000 per kilo
and also purchase a quantity of heroin from Thailand.
DeLorean was held overnight at Los Angeles Police head
quartres after his arrest Tuesday afternoon by FBI agents in a
hotel near the Los Angeles International Airport.
The FBI said DeLorean had several pounds of cocaine in his
possession. The cocaine came from a cache seized Monday night,
the bureau said, indicating that agents may have given it to him.
On Tuesday two associates of DeLorean were arraigned on
charges of conspiracy to distribute cocaine and possession with
intent to distribute.
They are William Hetrick, 50, of Mojavc, Calif., and Stephen
Arrington, 34, of San Diego. They were arrested on Monday.
Hetrick. Arrington and DeLorean are being held in lieu of
bail.
Stigler wins Nobel for economics
Stockholm, Sweden — University of Chicago Professor
George Stigler, whose economic research warns that government
regulation can cause unintended side-effects, won the 1982
Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Science yesterday.
Stigler, 71, a professor at Chicago since 1958 and for years a
leading candidate for the prize, is considered a pioneer in the
field of market and industrial organization. He is the second
American to win a Nobel this year and the 11 th American to win
the economics prize.
"Naturally, I feel delighted. How can I feel any other way?,"
Stigler said in Chicago. He said he had expected two other econo
mists to win. He did not name them but said "they certainly will
(be honored), sooner or later."
Stigler refers to himself as "quite conservative" in his econom
ic views, but unlike other prominent economists he has never ad
vised a president. He said he supports President Reagan's efforts
to cut government spending and deregulate the economy but that
he could not make substantive comment about it.
The awarding committee of the Swedish Academy of Sciences
chose him for what it called his non-political research, commend
ing Stigler's pioneering studies "of industrial structures, func
tioning of markets and causes and effects of public regulations."
Thousands of Poles mourn for unionist
Nowa Huta, Poland — Marching slowly to Chopin's funeral
dirge under banners declaring "Solidarity Lives," thousands of
angry and despairing Poles on yesterday buried a young unionist
killed by police in riots set off by a government ban on the inde
pendent union.
Hundreds of riot police backed by helineted paratroopers kept
a tight grip on Nowa Huta to prevent new unrest as an estimated
10.000 mourners and at least 21 Roman Catholic priests left the
funeral of 20-year-old Bogdan Wlosik.
"My son, oh my son," cried Irena Wlosik as she threw herself
twice onto her son's coffin. Her husband Jozef and their daugh
ter Malgorzata wept as the coffin was lowered slowly into the
ground by friends.
"My son, sleep calmly in our Polish earth on which you were
not permitted to live in peace," said a banner on one of about 60
wreaths placed amid flowers piled over six feet high on Wlosik's
grave.
Wlosik was killed by a plainclothes policeman during riots
Oct. 15 sparked by the outlawing of Solidarity on Oct. 8. He was
the 15th Pole killed in demonstrations since authorities imposed
martial law Dec. 13 and suspended Solidarity, the first union in

the Soviet bloc free of Communist Party control.
"We shall avenge you," was scrawled on one of several black
bordered funeral notices appearing around the city announcing
the burial.
Reagan stumps for Illinois Republicans
Peoria, 111. — President Reagan delivered two directly conflict
ing political messages to Illinois voters yesterday — one warning
about the dangers of dealing with the Soviet Union, the other ex
tolling his administration's attempt to sell massive amounts of
U.S. grain to the Soviets.
1 hey illustrated the political and foreign-policy difficulties of
the president's contrasting approaches to trade with the Soviet
Union. He appeared to provide more ammunition for European
charges of an administration double standard on trade with the
Soviets and raised more questions about his own recent hints to
another Illinois Republican audience this week that he might
soften the pipeline sanctions.
In a speech to a Republican rally here last night, the president
asserted that sanctions against firms and nations supplying
equipment to the Russians for the natural-gas pipeline to
Western Europe are a necessary response to the repression in Po
land.
"The sanctions have substantially hurt the Soviet Union, and,
of course, they have hurt some of our own companies like
Caterpillar as well," Reagan said in a rally that was intended to
assist the campaign of House Minority Leader Robert Michel,
who sought unsuccessfully to persuade the president to allow
sale of the pipeline equipment to the Soviets.
The sanctions took away a $90 million contract from the hard
pressed Caterpillar Tractor Co., where 8000 workers have been
laid off in Michel's district. They are a sensitive subject for Re
publicans trying to help stave off an unexpectedly stiff challenge
by Democrat Douglas Stephens to Michel, a 26-year House vet
eran.
Cal Tech sights Halley's Comet
Pasadena — Two California Institute of Technology
astronomers, using the 200-inch diameter Mt. Palomar telescope
and an extremely sensitive electronic camera, have made the first
confirmed sighting of Halley's Comet out beyond the orbit of the
planet Saturn.
For more than a month now, astronomers around the world
have vied with each other in a friendly way to be the first to see
Halley's on the inbound leg of its current swoop around the sun.
Only in the last month have astronomers thought that there
might be any chance of detecting a glint of reflected sunlight off
the approximately 2-mile diameter ball of ice and frozen gases,
which is due to fly by the earth in 1986.
Indeed, staff astronomer Edward Danielson and graduate stu
dent David Jewitt got little more than a glint when they trained
the 200-inch Palomar telescope on a tiny patch of sky during the
late evening hours of last Friday and early morning hours of last
Saturday.
There, amidst the stars of the constellation Canis Minor, was a
tiny pin-point of light. The light was far too faint for most con
ventional astronomical instruments, but the Palomar telescope is
equipped with an extremely sensitive electronic camera, which
recorded the reflected light.
Danielson and Jewitt looked at that part of the sky again dur
ing the evening and early morning of Monday and Tuesday and
there found that the pin-point of light had moved, relative to the
background stars, just about as far as it should have in 48 hours if
it really were Halley's Comet.
When asked at a press conference yesterday on the Caltech
campus here how he could be sure that the object is Halley's, Jew
itt answered that "we have a precise ephemeris (positional in
formation on Halley's) and it was both where we expected it to be
and had the correct brightness."
At the moment, Halley's — a little more than 1 billion miles
out from the sun, between the orbits of the planets Saturn and

Uranus — is simply a little ball of ice and frigid gases. Not until it
draws closer to the sun will that water and frozen matter be
heated enough to boil away and form both a coma, or gassy en
velope around the nucleus, and a long, streamer-like tail.
Israel criticizes Gemayel's stance
Jerusalem — The Israeli government yesterday expressed "dis
appointment" with Lebanese President Amin Gemayel's public
statements about the Israeli presence in Lebanon but suggested
that Gemayel's public posture might conceal a more fiexibile
private attitude.
In the first official reaction here to Gemayel's speech at the
United Nations and the reports of his meetings with President
Reagan and other U.S. officials, Israeli officials said they will
stick to their positions despite Gemayel's objections.
Specifically, the Israelis said they were disappointed by
Gemayel's demand that Israeli forces be the first to withdraw
from Lebanon, and his refusal not only to sign a peace treaty
with Israel but to sign a formal agreement establishing "security
arrangements" in southern Lebanon.
The net effect of Gemayel's visit to the United Nations and
Washington was to put distance between the new Lebanese presi
dent and the Israelis. Last week, Israel's negotiating positions on
a troop withdrawal from Lebanon was presented to the Lebanese
government by David Kimche, the director-general of the Israeli
Foreign Ministry, who reportedly came away convinced that
these positions were acceptable to Lebanon.
NRC suggests delay in new Diablo license
Washington — A report by the staff of the Nuclear Regulatory
Commission recommended yesterday that the commission re
fuse to reinstate the low-power license of the Diablo Canyon nu
clear power plant until all technical problems relating to its seis
mic design have been resolved.
The report said, however, that the majority of the problems
identified earlier at the plant, located on the central California
coast, had been corrected. It recommended that the NRC com
mission approve the facility's plan on work that would make the
plant fully operational.
Stock market continues to soar
A new wave of buying swept through the stock market late yes
terday, lifting the Dow Jones industrial average to its highest
closing level in almost 10 years.
The Dow Jones average of 30 big-name stocks, up about 7
points going into the last hour of trading, finished with a 20.32-
point gain at 1034.12.
That stood as the highest close for the venerable average since
it finished at 1039.36 on Jan. 12,1973. The record of 1,051.70 was
reached on Jan. 11 of that year.
Today's weather
Cloudy today with a 40 percent chance of rain. Highs in the
mid 60s to low 70s. Southerly winds increasing to 15 to 30 mph.
Rain likely tonight and Friday with a 60 percent chance. Lows in
