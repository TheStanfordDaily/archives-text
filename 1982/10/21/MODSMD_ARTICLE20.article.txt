## The
						columnist's dual personality 
### 
I could have written about the up
coming elections. I almost did. I could
have written about the Mideast or the
Third World. It would have been very
interesting, just as it always is. I could
have written about international rela
tions or President Reagan. It would
have been easy. But I'm taking a chance
with a new plan.
What I write will often sound mean,
but I am not a mean person. I have a
dark view and I am going to share it, but
1 really do just want everyone to be hap
py.
Instead of succumbing to the urge to
write a defense of Gov. Brown or an
argument for Proposition 15, I'm going
to tell you that nothing makes any dif
ference, not one bit. Then, I'm going to
tell you how to choose right from
wrong, what is important and what is
not. I'm going to tell you whom to vote
for and I am going to say that every
choice of every man makes a difference.
I am going to tell you that America is
the most horrible country in the world
and that I love it. Eventually, in a few
months, I'll leave you with a choice, a
choice that will lead to happiness and to
nothingness.
I am two people and what each sees is
completely different. One thinks; one
acts. The thinking me is paralyzed in
darkness; the acting me is ignorant, so it
survives, it struggles, it accomplishes; it
is happy now and then.
The first me is going to graduate from
these ideal surroundings. It is going to
become a successful lawyer, saying it
cares about people, saying that change
is possible, saying that if society is re
formed, crime will diminish. If the
Democrats take control or the Senate,
the 30 million people below the poverty
line will become 26 million, and we will
have made progress. It will maintain

that our courts must be kept strong be
cause they have protected our freedom;
they have led the way to civil rights and
social equality. It will say vote Nov. 2;
vote for Jerry Brown and Tom Bradley.
Vote yes on Propositions 11., 12 and 15;
and we will all be better off.
The first me thinks culture makes a
difference. Man can rise to glorious
heights on the page, on the screen, on
the stage, and in the concert hall. These
achievements make the world a better
place and they make man a nobler
creature.
When the first me goes to the ballot,
it sees only beauty; when it reads Long
Day's Journey into Night, it claps wild
ly, thinks for a while and marvels at the
writing. When it sees John Belushi in
Animal House, it still laughs uncon
trollably.
The first me thinks love is beautiful
and can redeem all hardships. It be
lieves in God and Jesus, or at least what

The second me sees that Stanford is just another
beautiful cocoon- It sees that we are born in one spot,
so we will become doctors, lawyers, engineers; and a
child in Bombay is born in another, so he'll die before
the age of five.

they stand for. The first me will keep me
sane and happy; it will allow me to have
a family and friends. It will have a great
time at cocktail parties and fine French
restaurants in Beverly Hills, in front
row orchestra seats and foreign sports
cars.
It will treat other people civilly re
gardless of their beliefs or actions. It
will abhor violence in all instances. It
will work within the system. It will have
everything, except for truth.
The second me has rights to all of
that. It sees that Stanford is just another
beautiful cocoon. It sees that we are
born in one spot, so we will become
doctors, lawyers, engineers; and a child
in Bombay is born in another, so he'll
die before the age of five. It sees that the
world has always been that way and will
always be that way.
It sees violence so rooted in society
that it simply counts the deaths of the
innocent and the guilty this year, last
year, and 500 years ago. It cannot
blame some of those who kill.
It knows that 30 million people are,

have been, and always will be un
provided for in the richest country in
the world. It realizes that no one really
notices or cares. It cannot help but
laugh at the events of the upcoming
election.
The second me finds refuge in liter
ature and philosophy. It examines work
honestly and never says, "But we have
to see it in the context of the real
world," or "Wasn't the writing lovely."
It hates Captain Vere in Billy Budd as
much as it hates John Claggart.
The second me sees no glory in art. It
knows that the ascent of the artistic sen
sibility can only lead to a fall. It sees
emotional breakdowns behind the Sug
ar Plum Fairy in The Nutcracker. It sees
Wagner, the horrible man, during the
Ride of the Walkyries; it sees the human
failure and misery of Eugene O'Neill
during Long Day's Journey into Night.
It cannot laugh while watching reruns
of Saturday Night Live.

It cannot relate to anyone else; it can
never love; although it constantly feels.
It can only experience guilt and disdain
at the refined, beautiful pleasures of
life. It tortures itself, before dying in de
spair. It has no answers. It sees only
truth, and only it sees truth.
So, one time the first will speak, an
other time the second will prevail. To
gether, they will attempt to find a bal
ance between Herman Melville and
Ronald Reagan, between O'Neill and
Edward Kennedy, between James
Joyce and Dr. Seuss. The two may
unite, but it is more likely that we will be
left with a choice.
But, don't worry now. From now on,
everything will be straightforward. No
more rambling, no more personal con
fessions, no more pretentiousness. I'll
talk about the normal things: politics,
culture and Stanford life. It should be
clear who's speaking. I hope that you
will join us.
