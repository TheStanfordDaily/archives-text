# Growing pains: rock 'n' rollers entering midcareer
## The 						Beat: A new twist, a new feeling 
### LARRY NADLER 
The English Beat
Special Beat Service
IRS Records
The Beat emerged in England
in 1979 with a cover of Smokey
Robinson's "Tears of a Clown"
on the Special's old 2-Tone label.
After its success, they formed
their own Go-Feet label and re
leased I Just Can't Stop It, a Brit
ish smash but a minor success in
America, where the band was
forced to change their name to
"The English Beat" to avoid le
gal hassles with Paul Collins Beat
from Los Angeles. That debut
album was an irresistible blend of
double-time ska, reggae, calypso
and jazz with a biting edge.
"Stand Down Margaret" was a
brilliant rap atU.K. Prime Min
ister Margaret Thatcher, while
"Two Swords" dealt with neo-
Nazi violence and intolerance.
Their second album,
Wha'ppen?, was no more of a
U.S. success. The pace was

slowed down considerably, while
Dave Wakeling's Elvis Cos
telloish vocals were given a
chance to expand, supplemented
by Ranking Roger's "toasting"
â€” a playful Jamaican-style rap
ping. and the lush saxaphone by
Saxa, their 50-plus-year-old Ja
maican sax-player. However, by
the time of their second U.S. tour
last year, the Beat were playing
many sold-out club en
gagements. Why? Because their
adrenalin-saturated shows can
even get your 80-year-old grand
mother's feet shaking . The Beat
are steadily growing in popu
larity, as exemplified by the en
thusiastic response to their early
performance at the US Festival
last September. With their new
album. Special Beat Service, the
Beat continue to grow and
branch out musically and lyr
ically. The same amazing
rhythms and percolating blends
of musical styles are there, but
with new twists and new feeling.

Having pretty much said their
bit on social injustice, the Beat
seem to be concentrating on in
trospective studies of broken and
near-broken relationships. (That
Elvis Costello influence?) The
album opener, "I Confess,' be-,
gins by melting your heart with
Wakeling's wonderfully emotive
voice pleading a self-pitying end
of-the-romance ultimatum,
backed by Dave Blockhead's
sympathetic piano accompani
ment and a mandolin for dramat
ic effect.
"Jeanette" and "Save it for
Later," the singles, offer two con
trasting views of romance'.
"Jeanette" almost sounds like a
Bohemian polka with a festive
accordion keeping speed with the
jubilant acount of a jet-set one-*
night fling. "Touching your skin
has proved one thing/that love's
still exciting" Wakeling sings,
but the affair is ultimately shal

low. He needs a firm foundation
and in "Save it for Later," Dave's
suffering again, on the rocks with
his girl, knowing that he's depen
dent on the relationship for his
emotional stability. "She's
[Going" gives us the female view,
and the communication gap be
tween the sexes is laid out for our
view. Dave and Roger trade
lines: "She found out that you
don't give a damn/ Just watch
the spirit slipping out of her
hand/ . . . too late to tell her you
love her." Dave, you blew it.
As Wakeling points out in
"Sorry," complemented by a ma
jestic Pigbag-style funky horn
section, "Words are just another
violence/ Nothing rings as true
as silence." These lovers want
and need each other, but can't
communicate through words.
"Sole Salvation" tells us that
without any true "soul," (while
guitarist Andy Cox strums the fa
mous riff from "Soul Man")
"We've never said the only things
we should have ever bothered
saying/ Write out a list of things

we need/ Let's strike a brand new
deal."
Ranking Roger's toasting is
absent from Wakeling's songs,
but he dominates two numbers
completely. "Spar Wid Me," a
humorous dub complete with
banjo(!), and a duet with fellow
toaster Pato in "Pato and Roger
A Go Talk," incorporate some
Eek-a-Mouse/Clint Eastwood
vocal mannerisms, and Roger
pulls them off brilliantly. His vo
cal style hooks you right away,
and it matters little that the lyric
sheet is mandatory to understand
what he's actually singing.
Those who miss the high-speed
romps of the first album will be
happy with "Rotating Head,"
("Mirror in the Bathroom" re
visited) and "Sugar and Stress,"
which returns to the old theme of
social disintegration ("This
world is upside-down/ The rights
and wrongs don't get much
wronger") to a furious, shimmer
ing 12-string guitar clamor.
The album ends with "End of
the Party," a melancholy piece of
romantic pleading that rein
troduces that cocktail-lounge pi
ano from"I Confess," and
"Ackee 1-2-3," a joyous an

nouncement, complete with a
backing choir of children, that no
matter how bad things get, life is
only a game and we should take
the failures in strike, pushing for
ward with good humor and toler
ance. A simple message, to be
sure, but one that sure bears re
peating.
Wesley Magoogan assists Saxa
with the sax chores on this album
(Saxa no longer tours with the
band), as well as providing wood
winds. When the swirling guitars,
wailing horns, insistent rhythm
section, and warm vocals mesh
together on Special Beat Service,
it's hard to resist the infectious
energy bubbling from the
grooves. The Beat have suc
ceeded in combining I Just Can't
Stop It's energy with expanded
musical arrangements. Lyrically,
the Beat display more genuine
human emotion that ever in the
album's thorough examinations
of human-to-human rela
tionships. It will be interesting to
see if the Beat gain some chart
success with Special Beat Service.
They're due back in the States
this winter, so don't miss them
this time around.
