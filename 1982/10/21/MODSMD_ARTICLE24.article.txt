The English Beat
Special Beat Service

The Beat emerged in England
in 1979 with a cover of Smokey
Robinson's "Tears of a Clown"
on the Special's old 2-Tone label.
After its success, they formed
their own Go-Feet label and re
leased I Just Can't Stop It, a Brit
ish smash but a minor success in
America, where the band was
forced to change their name to
"The English Beat" to avoid le
gal hassles with Paul Collins Beat
from Los Angeles. That debut
album was an irresistible blend of
double-time ska, reggae, calypso
and jazz with a biting edge.
"Stand Down Margaret" was a
brilliant rap atU.K. Prime Min
ister Margaret Thatcher, while
"Two Swords" dealt with neo-
Nazi violence and intolerance.
Their second album,
Wha'ppen?, was no more of a
U.S. success. The pace was

slowed down considerably, while
Dave Wakeling's Elvis Cos
telloish vocals were given a
chance to expand, supplemented
by Ranking Roger's "toasting"
â€” a playful Jamaican-style rap
ping. and the lush saxaphone by
Saxa, their 50-plus-year-old Ja

adrenalin-saturated shows can
even get your 80-year-old grand
mother's feet shaking . The Beat
are steadily growing in popu

thusiastic response to their early
performance at the US Festival
last September. With their new
album. Special Beat Service, the
Beat continue to grow and
branch out musically and lyr
ically. The same amazing
rhythms and percolating blends
of musical styles are there, but
with new twists and new feeling.

Having pretty much said their
bit on social injustice, the Beat
seem to be concentrating on in
trospective studies of broken and
near-broken relationships. (That
Elvis Costello influence?) The
album opener, "I Confess,' be-,
gins by melting your heart with
Wakeling's wonderfully emotive
voice pleading a self-pitying end
of-the-romance ultimatum,
backed by Dave Blockhead's
sympathetic piano accompani
ment and a mandolin for dramat
ic effect.
"Jeanette" and "Save it for
Later," the singles, offer two con
trasting views of romance'.
"Jeanette" almost sounds like a
Bohemian polka with a festive
accordion keeping speed with the
jubilant acount of a jet-set one-*
night fling. "Touching your skin
has proved one thing/that love's
still exciting" Wakeling sings,
but the affair is ultimately shal
