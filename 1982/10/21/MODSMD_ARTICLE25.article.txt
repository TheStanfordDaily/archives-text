# Dire Straits: making mystery seem second-hand
## 
### STEFAN MALMOLI 
Dire Straits
Love Over Gold
Warner Bros. Records
I remember the first time that I
heard Dire Straits. It was in the
summer of '78 and there was a
song being played that sounded
like Dylan's best work in years.
However, as 1 was soon to learn,
that song, "Sultans of Swing,"
was by a new English band called
Dire Straits. In the face of the
coming explosion of English new
wave, I was both startled and
amused that a Dylan soundalike
could still sell under the circum
stances.
The band, however, is really
the vision of Mark Knopfler, the
lead guitarist and vocalist. Al
though Knopfler may still have
the Dylan voice and style, the
band's musical range has
progressed immensely.
Knopfler's guitar playing may be
the smoothest around since Clap
ton's heyday, and there is no de
nying that whenever Knopfler
picks away at his strings, the re
sults can be spellbinding. On the

band's previous LP, Making
Movies. Knopfler composed an
album of gorgeously played love
songs and rave-ups. From the
classical sounding "Romeo and
Juliet" to the desperate guitar
movers like "Solid Rock," the
album went way beyond my ex
pectations of the band who put
out "Sultans of Swing."
Their new album, Love Over
Gold, is a continuation of Making
Movies in both musical style and
lyrical content. It incorporates
more keyboards and piano for
that "Springsteen" dramatic ef
fect that worked so wonderfully
on Making Movies. With these
added keyboards, Knopfler can
concentrate solely on his guitar
playing without concerning
himself about any loss in musical
continuity or direction. This is es
pecially evident on the
slower tempo songs, since it
enables Knopfler to add swirling
guitar runs around the listener in
a beautiful manner.
However, on this album
(which contains only five songs,
all of which are of unusually long

length), Knopfler loses some of
the intensity and the momentum
generated by the last album. Love
Over Gold sounds like Making
Movies Part Two, and copies are
never as good as originals. Songs
like "Love Over Gold" and"It
Never Rains" are lyrically identi
cal and musically similar to the
songs on the band's previous
album. Although at times, the
music does catch fire (usually
when Knopfler just lets his guitar
do the talking), it isn't as often or
consistent as it could have been.
At times, it seems as if the light
ning bolt on the album's cover is
the most electric thing about the
album.
Basically, what seemed mys
terious and sensual on Making
Movies is second-hand knowl
edge on Love Over Gold. His tales
of downtrodden Romeos and
women who fell from grace are a
little dry this time around. Only
when he takes on new lyrical sub
jects do the songs take on the pas
sion that Knopfler is capable of
