# Dire Straits: making mystery seem second-hand
## 
### STEFAN MALMOLI 
Dire Straits
Love Over Gold
Warner Bros. Records
I remember the first time that I
heard Dire Straits. It was in the
summer of '78 and there was a
song being played that sounded
like Dylan's best work in years.
However, as 1 was soon to learn,
that song, "Sultans of Swing,"
was by a new English band called
Dire Straits. In the face of the
coming explosion of English new
wave, I was both startled and
amused that a Dylan soundalike
could still sell under the circum
stances.
The band, however, is really
the vision of Mark Knopfler, the
lead guitarist and vocalist. Al
though Knopfler may still have
the Dylan voice and style, the
band's musical range has
progressed immensely.
Knopfler's guitar playing may be
the smoothest around since Clap
ton's heyday, and there is no de
nying that whenever Knopfler
picks away at his strings, the re
sults can be spellbinding. On the

band's previous LP, Making
Movies. Knopfler composed an
album of gorgeously played love
songs and rave-ups. From the
classical sounding "Romeo and
Juliet" to the desperate guitar
movers like "Solid Rock," the
album went way beyond my ex
pectations of the band who put
out "Sultans of Swing."
Their new album, Love Over
Gold, is a continuation of Making
Movies in both musical style and
lyrical content. It incorporates
more keyboards and piano for
that "Springsteen" dramatic ef
fect that worked so wonderfully
on Making Movies. With these
added keyboards, Knopfler can
concentrate solely on his guitar
playing without concerning
himself about any loss in musical
continuity or direction. This is es
pecially evident on the
slower tempo songs, since it
enables Knopfler to add swirling
guitar runs around the listener in
a beautiful manner.
However, on this album
(which contains only five songs,
all of which are of unusually long

length), Knopfler loses some of
the intensity and the momentum
generated by the last album. Love
Over Gold sounds like Making
Movies Part Two, and copies are
never as good as originals. Songs
like "Love Over Gold" and"It
Never Rains" are lyrically identi
cal and musically similar to the
songs on the band's previous
album. Although at times, the
music does catch fire (usually
when Knopfler just lets his guitar
do the talking), it isn't as often or
consistent as it could have been.
At times, it seems as if the light
ning bolt on the album's cover is
the most electric thing about the
album.
Basically, what seemed mys
terious and sensual on Making
Movies is second-hand knowl
edge on Love Over Gold. His tales
of downtrodden Romeos and
women who fell from grace are a
little dry this time around. Only
when he takes on new lyrical sub
jects do the songs take on the pas
sion that Knopfler is capable of

giving to his songs. The best ex
ample of this is on the album's
tightest cut, "Industrial Dis
ease." The song is a seven-minute
dissertation on the abuse that the
industries and government of
England have left on its workers.
The angry, sarcastic tone. of
Knopfler's voice is further
amplified by his searing guitar
work. On this cut, Knopfler's
guitar sounds as if it had "in
dustrial disease," as it moans and
groans until it is sick to the bone.
The song must be heard and the
lyrics are amazingly cutting —
"Two men say they're Jesus; one
of them must be wrong . . . The
first Jesus says 'I'd cure it soon,
abolish Monday mornings and
Friday afternoons'; the other
one's out on a hunger strike, he's
dying by degrees; how come
Jesus gets Industrial Disease?".
Besides "Industrial Disease,"
the album's only other truly com

plete work is the 14-minute epic,
"Telegraph Road." Very similar
in sound and mind to Bruce
Springsteen's "Jungleland,"
"Telegraph Road" is the story of
a wilderness town, right when the
destructive mining and oil com
panies moved in. It's a long but
captivating portrayal of a happy
cabin owner, who by the influx of
"civilization," is now frightful
and angered. Then in a very
Springsteen-like manner, he is
forced into fighting his way out
— "But believe in me baby and
I'll take you away from out of
this darkness . . . 'cos I've tun ev
ery red light on memory lane; I've
seen desperation explode into
flames and I don't wanna see it
again!" And the guitar playing

that fades out the song for five
minutes is so invigorating that it
still is growing on me after many
repeated listenings.
Overall, Love Over Gold may
be a weaker counterpart to Mak
ing Movies, but it does have its
moments of greatness. Dire
Straits may have just been a little
confused and cautious in testing
its newer styled material (like
"Industrial Disease"). However,
judging by the excellence of their
new styled music, I think that
Dire Straits should have risked it
all and taken that step into new
musical territory. By doing that, I
think they would have come up
with a more satisfactory suc
cessor to Making Movies.
