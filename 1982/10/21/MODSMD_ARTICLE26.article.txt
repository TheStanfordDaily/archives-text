# X and the power of Catholicism

X
Under the Big Black Sun
Elektra Records
When X, LA's acknowledged
premier punk band, changed
labels last year from the punk
and roots-rock oriented Slash
Records to the more mainstream
Elektra/ Asylum Records,
charges and accusations of "sell
out" could be heard from many
corners. What is puzzling is that
after the release of their first
album for Elekira/Asylum,
"Under the Big Black Sun,"
these charges are still being
heard; from the very first track, it
is obvious that this is no sell-out.
X has with their latest and per
haps best album successfully
maintained their trip-hammer in
tensity, while at the same time ex
hibiting a healthy artistic growth
that lives up to the promise of
their first two albums for Slash.

Perhaps they have even earned
the right, as some critics have
suggested, to be called "The
World's Greatest Rock and Roll
Band," a title usually reserved for
such types as The Clash, The
Who and The Rolling Stones.
X's songs have as their basis
the monogamous marriage be
tween the band's founders, Exene
Cervenka and John Doe. It is this
which provides the hope that un
derlies the seeming despair in
many of their songs. The first
tract, "The Hungry Wolf," could
almost be a declaration of this
philosophy. Its lyrics tell us: "I
am/the hungry wolf/ and run
endlessly with my mate/ I see the
gutter feed on the foolish/ outrun
and kill the strong." The only
thing of any value to them in the
human experience is the faithful
ness and trust between two peo
ple. Their songs reflect a chilling
ly accurate portrayal of what can

happen if that bond is severed. In
"Riding With Mary" and "How
I (Learned My Lesson)" they
sing of the despondency that
adultery brings with an elo
quence that is quite unique. Their
songs run through the gamut of
the human experience. 1 hey sing
of death, of drink, of sex, of love
and of life. "The Have Nots" is
about the vicious circle of drink
and despair seen in "the working
class," and is told with a com
passion and consciousness that
rivals Bruce Springsteen's.
Cervenka's song aobut her moth
er's de*ath, "Come Back To Me,"
is a plaintive and simple song that
successfully reveals the emp
tiness and hopelessness that
death brings. Yet these songs are
juxtaposed against the fidelity
and hope of "Because I Do,"
("What kind of fool am 1/ 1 am
the married kind/ the kind that
said 1 do") and "Dancing With
Tears in my Eyes," a cover of an
old '30s dance song that X man
ages to make completely their
own.
Much of the symbolism in
herent in their songs derives from
a strong Catholic influence, but
their religion is not an escape, as
it is in many other cases, but a
metaphor. They see in the per
vading passion of Catholicism
the intense passion of modern
life. Unfailing hope in a thing
called love, in spite of the misery
in evidence all around, is

equivalent to the unfailing belief
in a God who has suffered for all,
that so many Catholics accept. "I
built a shrine/ for you on the
kitchen wall," Cervenka sings of
her mother's death in "Come
Back To Me."
The most striking feature of
X's music is the unique vocals of
Cervenka and Doe. Their voices
don't hit a note, they slide to it.
Their harmonies shift gradually
from note to note, and their
voices hold an underlying tension
that can only be described as elec
tric. These vocals are wonder
fully backed with the sledgeham
mer guitar of Billy Zoom, relent
less in its pounding assault. Fill
ing out the rhythm section are
Doe on bass and D. J. Bonebrake
on drums, who manages to live
up to his name. One of the most
exciting moments on "Under
The Big Black Sun" is the open
ing riff of "The Hungry Wolf,"
where Bonebrake and Zoom
create a ferocity that perhaps
makes this X's best song.
X, with this new album, have
established themselves as one of
the most adventurous and impor
tant rock and roll bands in a long
time. Because of the passion, in
telligence, and even beauty, of
their songs, they have made an
album which is the best release of
the year, despite many heavy
contenders. X's "Under the Big
Black Sun" is rock as it should be
â€” hard, brittle, and passionate.
