# Sigma Delta Tau receives recognition

A' new sorority, Sigma Delta Tau, has
joined the Delta Gamma sorority as the
second officially recognized sorority on
campus, achieving in five months what
a half-dozen other sororities have been
unable to achieve in five years.
Last May, five Stanford women de
cided to introduce Sigma Delta Tau to
the University. Yesterday, the sorority
was granted provisional recognition by
the University. According to Cheryl
Velick, one of the five co-founders of
the Stanford chapter, this allows the
group to use campus facilities but not to
apply for on-campus housing.
The fact that the Stanford chapter of
Sigma Delta Tau has been granted this
recognition sets it apart from most oth
er sororities on campus. Only one other
sorority. Delta Gamma, has been
granted similar recognition. All other
sororities active at Stanford must hold
all functions, such as rush, off campus.

In order to gain recognition by the
University, a group must be able to act
autonomously and independently of its
national leadership and it must comply
with certain guidelines. In the event of
any conflict in policy between the na
tional leadership and the University,
for example, the sorority must agree
that the University's policy will prevail.
Members of Sigma Delta Tau, how
ever, say they want the Stanford
chapter. Beta Upsilon, to distinguish
itself from other groups in more signifi
cant ways than recognition. The sorori
ty has traditionally been service ori
ented as well as socially oriented, and
the five Beta Upsilon chapter members
say they hope to hold this tradition
through various volunteer activities.
Among the activities being planned are
a program of reading to patients at
Children's Hospital and work with the
National Commission for the Preven-
