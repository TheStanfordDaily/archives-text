# Sigma Delta Tau receives recognition
## 
### FELICIA LEE 
A' new sorority, Sigma Delta Tau, has
joined the Delta Gamma sorority as the
second officially recognized sorority on
campus, achieving in five months what
a half-dozen other sororities have been
unable to achieve in five years.
Last May, five Stanford women de
cided to introduce Sigma Delta Tau to
the University. Yesterday, the sorority
was granted provisional recognition by
the University. According to Cheryl
Velick, one of the five co-founders of
the Stanford chapter, this allows the
group to use campus facilities but not to
apply for on-campus housing.
The fact that the Stanford chapter of
Sigma Delta Tau has been granted this
recognition sets it apart from most oth
er sororities on campus. Only one other
sorority. Delta Gamma, has been
granted similar recognition. All other
sororities active at Stanford must hold
all functions, such as rush, off campus.

In order to gain recognition by the
University, a group must be able to act
autonomously and independently of its
national leadership and it must comply
with certain guidelines. In the event of
any conflict in policy between the na
tional leadership and the University,
for example, the sorority must agree
that the University's policy will prevail.
Members of Sigma Delta Tau, how
ever, say they want the Stanford
chapter. Beta Upsilon, to distinguish
itself from other groups in more signifi
cant ways than recognition. The sorori
ty has traditionally been service ori
ented as well as socially oriented, and
the five Beta Upsilon chapter members
say they hope to hold this tradition
through various volunteer activities.
Among the activities being planned are
a program of reading to patients at
Children's Hospital and work with the
National Commission for the Preven-
lion of Child Abuse.
Although still a small group, the
sorority hopes to attract many new
members. According to chapter co
founder Joy Belin, about 25 people ex
pressed interest in the group during its
introductory, off-campus meetings last
spring. No new members, however,
were pledged during this time. Next
week, the sorority will hold a week-long
rush — on campus — for those in
terested in joining. The group has an
ongoing membership drive, however,
and according to Velick, women in
terested in joining the group could do so
at any time — in or out of rush.
In its first few months of existence,
the Sigma Delta Tau sorority has ap
parently had little opposition from the
Stanford community. The group has re
ceived the help and support of the Inter-
Sorority Council and Sigma Delta Tau
members say they have been pleasantly
surprised by the University's sup
portive attitude.
Diana Conklin, director of the Row,
was particularly praised as helpful and
open.
The founding members of Sigma
Delta Tau hope to promote a sense of
openness in their own membership. The
group particularly hopes to attract mi
nority members.
"We're looking for diversity . . .
we're really serious about it," said
Velick.
According to Velick, the sorority's
history has a lot to do with its emphasis
on openness and diversity. The first
Sigma Delta Tau chapter was formed at
Cornell University in 1917 by seven
Jewish girls who were denied member
ship in other sororities because of their
religion. Although it was primarly a
Jewish sorority in its early years, it now
admits members of all groups. Pointing
to its history as a group rebelling
against discrimination, Velick stated,
"we don't want to turn around and dis
criminate against others."
In 1977, the University lifted a 33-
year ban on sororities which had been
prompted by social pressure and con
flicts between sorority and "hall wom
en" in the '40s. At that time, seven
sororities began forming and holdfhg
activities, but without the official sanc
tions by the University. In 1979, Uni
versity officials stated that policies con
tained within the sororities' charters
prevented their gaining official recogni
tion, hence the stipulation that they
would not be allowed to meet on cam
pus or use campus facitlities for rush. In
1980, however, it was determined that
the Delta Gamma sorority had suffi
cient autonomy from its national or
ganization to warrant recognition by
the University and the right to use facil
ities here.

any conflict in policy between the na
tional leadership and the University,
for example, the sorority must agree
that the University's policy will prevail.
Members of Sigma Delta Tau, how
ever, say they want the Stanford
chapter. Beta Upsilon, to distinguish
itself from other groups in more signifi
cant ways than recognition. The sorori
ty has traditionally been service ori
ented as well as socially oriented, and
the five Beta Upsilon chapter members
say they hope to hold this tradition
through various volunteer activities.
Among the activities being planned are
a program of reading to patients at
Children's Hospital and work with the
National Commission for the Preven-
lion of Child Abuse.
Although still a small group, the
sorority hopes to attract many new
members. According to chapter co
founder Joy Belin, about 25 people ex
pressed interest in the group during its
introductory, off-campus meetings last
spring. No new members, however,
were pledged during this time. Next
week, the sorority will hold a week-long
rush — on campus — for those in
terested in joining. The group has an
ongoing membership drive, however,
and according to Velick, women in
terested in joining the group could do so
at any time — in or out of rush.
In its first few months of existence,
the Sigma Delta Tau sorority has ap
parently had little opposition from the
Stanford community. The group has re
ceived the help and support of the Inter-
Sorority Council and Sigma Delta Tau
members say they have been pleasantly
surprised by the University's sup
portive attitude.
Diana Conklin, director of the Row,
was particularly praised as helpful and
open.
The founding members of Sigma
Delta Tau hope to promote a sense of
openness in their own membership. The
group particularly hopes to attract mi
nority members.
"We're looking for diversity . . .
we're really serious about it," said
Velick.
According to Velick, the sorority's
history has a lot to do with its emphasis
on openness and diversity. The first
Sigma Delta Tau chapter was formed at
Cornell University in 1917 by seven
Jewish girls who were denied member
ship in other sororities because of their
religion. Although it was primarly a
Jewish sorority in its early years, it now
admits members of all groups. Pointing
to its history as a group rebelling
against discrimination, Velick stated,
"we don't want to turn around and dis
criminate against others."
In 1977, the University lifted a 33-
year ban on sororities which had been
prompted by social pressure and con
flicts between sorority and "hall wom
en" in the '40s. At that time, seven
sororities began forming and holdfhg
activities, but without the official sanc
tions by the University. In 1979, Uni
versity officials stated that policies con
tained within the sororities' charters
prevented their gaining official recogni
tion, hence the stipulation that they
would not be allowed to meet on cam
pus or use campus facitlities for rush. In
1980, however, it was determined that
the Delta Gamma sorority had suffi
cient autonomy from its national or
ganization to warrant recognition by
the University and the right to use facil
ities here.
A' new sorority, Sigma Delta Tau, has
joined the Delta Gamma sorority as the
second officially recognized sorority on
campus, achieving in five months what
a half-dozen other sororities have been
unable to achieve in five years.
Last May, five Stanford women de
cided to introduce Sigma Delta Tau to
the University. Yesterday, the sorority
was granted provisional recognition by
the University. According to Cheryl
Velick, one of the five co-founders of
the Stanford chapter, this allows the
group to use campus facilities but not to
apply for on-campus housing.
The fact that the Stanford chapter of
Sigma Delta Tau has been granted this
recognition sets it apart from most oth
er sororities on campus. Only one other
sorority. Delta Gamma, has been
granted similar recognition. All other
sororities active at Stanford must hold
all functions, such as rush, off campus.

In order to gain recognition by the
University, a group must be able to act
autonomously and independently of its
national leadership and it must comply
with certain guidelines. In the event of
any conflict in policy between the na
tional leadership and the University,
for example, the sorority must agree
that the University's policy will prevail.
