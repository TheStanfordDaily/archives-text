# ASSU reviews deficit-ridden '82-'83 budget
## 
### STEVE TROUSDALE Staff Writer 
Faced with a budget which, if unaltered, would
put the ASSU nearly $20,000 in the red, ASSU of
ficials are struggling to cut programs in order to re
duce, if not eliminate, the deficit.
The 1982-83 ASSU budget, which was approved
last spring, will incur a deficit of approximately
$19,000 if it remains unchanged. Student Financial
Manager Bob Brody has announced. At this rate,
the ASSU would go bankrupt in a little more than
nine years, he said.
Because of this shortfall, Brody has told the
ASSU finance committee that the budget fnust be
reduced. At a committee meeting Tuesday 1 , Brody
listed possible cuts that only totaled about $4000;
and even this amount, he said "is not cutting fat, it's
cutting essentials."
The deficit was caused by a combination of fac
tors which included falling interest rates and ASSU
Recycling's expected loss, Brody told the Daily. He
said that the fall in interest rates would reduce the
ASSU's short-term interest yield from $38,000 last
year to $25,000 this year.
Greg Ray, chair of the finance committee, said
that it would be difficult to cut the budget. He did
say, however, that some cuts could be
made since "this budget was written with an eye to

expanding our image." In fact, the ASSU's pro
posed advertising budget jumped to $8565 this year
from $3675 last year. Ray also said that he believed
that recycling and other service projects helped the
association's image more than advertising could.
Thus he said he felt that advertising could be one of
the budget items cut.
Advertising was also one of the programs that
Brody, at the finance committee's meeting, sug
gested cutting. But he suggested that "no more than
$1000" should be cut.
If the budget is not balanced, any gap between ex
penses and revenues would have to be made up from
the ASSU's endowment, which totals approximate
ly $346,520. Although Ray did say that his commit
tee would do its best to reduce the deficit to zero, he
commented that the ASSU might have to eat into
the endowment this year in order to make up the def
icit.
Brody commented that "as things stand now with
the opportunities available to us I would not sup
port going into the endowment," because, as he
said, "I would not be happy with a deficit if we are
not making a move towards making it (the budget)
balanced" over the long term.
"A one-shot deficit resulting in a cut into our
equity is not fatal, but a continuous deficit is," he
said.

Brody mentioned two other areas in which the
ASSU's budget was being hurt. One was the lecture
note program, which had suffered lowered subscrip
tion rates as a result of a higher percentage of pro
fessors who teach large classes not allowing lecture
notes to be taken for their classes.
Another could result if Res Ed allows dorms to
take their money out of the ASSU bank, which it is
planning to implement winter quarter. The loss to
the ASSU would be about $1000, but Brody said
that "as long as accountability is there then I think
it's a good idea."
In another budget-related issue brought up at
Tuesday meeting, Brody discussed the financial
problems faced by ASSU Recycling. He suggested
that the program should be given until Jan. 1, 1983
to find a source of funding to meet its deficit or else it
should be shut down. However, the finance commit
tee decided to submit a resolution to the senate at
next week's meeting that delays the vote on closing
the center until the regular senate meeting of Jan. 25.
James Lyons, dean of student affairs, did com
ment that the ASSU had approached the University
about helping meet the center's deficit and that the
University was prepared to offer long term support
to the program, because, as Lyons said, "I can't see a
university without a recycling program."

about helping meet the center's deficit and that the
University was prepared to offer long term support
to the program, because, as Lyons said, "I can't see a
university without a recycling program."
Faced with a budget which, if unaltered, would
put the ASSU nearly $20,000 in the red, ASSU of
ficials are struggling to cut programs in order to re
duce, if not eliminate, the deficit.
The 1982-83 ASSU budget, which was approved
last spring, will incur a deficit of approximately
$19,000 if it remains unchanged. Student Financial
Manager Bob Brody has announced. At this rate,
the ASSU would go bankrupt in a little more than
nine years, he said.
Because of this shortfall, Brody has told the
ASSU finance committee that the budget fnust be
reduced. At a committee meeting Tuesday 1 , Brody
listed possible cuts that only totaled about $4000;
and even this amount, he said "is not cutting fat, it's
cutting essentials."
The deficit was caused by a combination of fac
tors which included falling interest rates and ASSU
Recycling's expected loss, Brody told the Daily. He
said that the fall in interest rates would reduce the
ASSU's short-term interest yield from $38,000 last
year to $25,000 this year.
Greg Ray, chair of the finance committee, said
that it would be difficult to cut the budget. He did
say, however, that some cuts could be
made since "this budget was written with an eye to

expanding our image." In fact, the ASSU's pro
posed advertising budget jumped to $8565 this year
from $3675 last year. Ray also said that he believed
that recycling and other service projects helped the
association's image more than advertising could.
Thus he said he felt that advertising could be one of
the budget items cut.
Advertising was also one of the programs that
Brody, at the finance committee's meeting, sug
gested cutting. But he suggested that "no more than
$1000" should be cut.
If the budget is not balanced, any gap between ex
penses and revenues would have to be made up from
the ASSU's endowment, which totals approximate
ly $346,520. Although Ray did say that his commit
tee would do its best to reduce the deficit to zero, he
commented that the ASSU might have to eat into
the endowment this year in order to make up the def
icit.
Brody commented that "as things stand now with
the opportunities available to us I would not sup
port going into the endowment," because, as he
said, "I would not be happy with a deficit if we are
not making a move towards making it (the budget)
balanced" over the long term.
"A one-shot deficit resulting in a cut into our
equity is not fatal, but a continuous deficit is," he
said.

Brody mentioned two other areas in which the
ASSU's budget was being hurt. One was the lecture
note program, which had suffered lowered subscrip
tion rates as a result of a higher percentage of pro
fessors who teach large classes not allowing lecture
notes to be taken for their classes.
Another could result if Res Ed allows dorms to
take their money out of the ASSU bank, which it is
planning to implement winter quarter. The loss to
the ASSU would be about $1000, but Brody said
that "as long as accountability is there then I think
it's a good idea."
In another budget-related issue brought up at
Tuesday meeting, Brody discussed the financial
problems faced by ASSU Recycling. He suggested
that the program should be given until Jan. 1, 1983
to find a source of funding to meet its deficit or else it
should be shut down. However, the finance commit
tee decided to submit a resolution to the senate at
next week's meeting that delays the vote on closing
the center until the regular senate meeting of Jan. 25.
James Lyons, dean of student affairs, did com
ment that the ASSU had approached the University
about helping meet the center's deficit and that the
University was prepared to offer long term support
to the program, because, as Lyons said, "I can't see a
university without a recycling program."
