# Burglars strike while students sleep in Lagunita

### SID ATKINS Staff writer 
Burglars committed 12 separate robberies of stu
dent rooms this past week and walked off the Stan
ford campus with nearly $2000 worth of valuables.
The worst rash of rip-offs occurred in the dorms
of Naranja and Adelfa in Lagunita Court on Friday
night, where six student rooms were entered in the
early morning hours. Detective Iran White of the
Stanford Police said that no rooms were broken
into. "In many cases, the thieves simply walked in
and took as many valuables as they could get their
hands on while the students slept," White said.
In all the incidents, thieves nabbed mostly small
items, such as jewelry, cash, watches and wallets.
They rounded up almost $1500 worth of goods in
Lagunita alone.

Police do have three suspects in custody. "These
arc people of devious backgrounds who are not part
of the Stanford community; it's obvious that they're
not new to robbery," White said. White added that
one Lagunita resident has agreed to try to identify
the possible thieves today in a police line-up.
In a related campus incident, a burglary of a home
in the 300 block of Lomita Drive was interrupted
when a friend of the out-of-town owner came by the
house to feed the dog. Upon arriving, the friend saw
a man running out the kitchen door. He and the po
lice subsequently found a television set, video tape
recorder, tape deck, coins, jewelry and other items
stacked in the kitchen, ready to be removed. The
man got away, police believe, in a vehicle that was
waiting to cart the valuables away.
White said that there is no definite reason for the

outbreak of burglaries on campus, but they occur
every few months. "Sometimes we may go a week or
two without burglaries, but dorms will always be
ripped off if doors are left open."
To help prevent break-ins. he stressed the "Neigh
borhood Watch System" whereby students help pa
trol their surroundings by reporting strange people
and occurances to authorities.
In Naranja and Adelfa, RAs held house meetings
last night to remind their residents to lock their
doors at night and to raise the "security conscious
ness" in the house. Rick Rickertson, RA in Adelfa,
where only one burglary took place, said that people
in his house were not afraid of further incidents.
"They weren't affected enough by what happened
this weekend. Most of them will just go on leaving
their doors open if we don't draw their attention to
the danger," Rickertson said.
