# SLAC proposal excites researchers
## Scientists hope to find origin of forces with collider 
### KRISTEN CHRISTOPHER Senior staff writer 
A proposed major addition to the
Stanford Linear Accelerator Center
may help particle physicists to learn
more about one of their most all-en
compassing theories: that the four
forces of nature have a common origin.
The $90 million Stanford Linear Col
lider (SLC) — presently in the research
and development stage — has been de
signed specifically to explore the in
teraction between two of nature's
forces. If this design is successful, it will
significantly advance the practicality of
high-energy physics technology,
prompting SLAC Director Wolfgang
Panofsky to call it a "dual purpose
project."
"One of the religions. . .of particle
physicists is that (the) four forces of na
ture will at some level have a common
origin, will be unified," Panofsky said.
These four forces are gravity, elec
tromagnetic interaction, and the so
called weak and strong interactions.
The SLC will be used to study the in
teraction between the weak force,
which derives from radioactivity, and
the electromagnetic force. The amount
of energy it will employ is that at which
the two forces arc about equal in
strength, according to Panofsky, "so in
that energy region, many, many

phenomena are expected to occur."
In the SLC — as opposed to the PEP
ring at SLAC — electrons and
positrons will be discarded after one
collision, instead of being stored in
rings where they collide numerous
times. Panofsky said the difficulty is

that when the electrons and positrons
are stored in these rings, they give off
energy in the form of radiation, and "as
they go around the circle you have to
keep pumping in power to make up for
the loss."
The collider's energy level will be
nearly three times greater than the larg
est amount ever used for high-energy
physics research, but Panofsky said that
since the particles will be thrown away

after they collide once, the SLC will ac
tually combat high power costs.
The energy level of the collider— 100
billion electron volts — was chosen spe
cifically because it is above the
threshold where a yet-undiscovered
particle is expected to exist, Panofsky
said. The particle has been termed "Z
sub-zero" and is the intermediate car
rier of the weak force, meaning it may
provide a link between the two forces
being studied.
While the new single-collision meth
od will ease energy costs, it presents re
searchers with another challenge, be
cause each collision has to be rendered
more productive, according to Pan
ofsky. "There is no free lunch." he said.
SLAC researchers believe they can
raise the productivity of each collision
by "educating the beams," Panofsky
said. Educating the beams means focus
ing them down to "unprecedently small
diameters" so that their collision occurs
at a much higher density.
"So this means the SLC is really a
major advance in the fundamental tech
nology of doing colliding beams by run
ning up the density during an interac
tion by a very large factor," Panofsky
said.
A "damping ring" currently being in
stalled will play a key role in educating
the beams. According to Panofsky,

electrons will be stored in the ring while
they cool down so the beam can ul
timately be focused on a smaller spot. A
connecting line from the accelerator to
the ring was built during the summer,
Panofsky said.
"We hope, then, early next year to do
the experiments to really examine
whether or not the cooling process real-
Ty works as predicted," Panofsky said.
Panofsky said that while the collider
has been designed with the hope of com
ing closer to proving a theory, it may
produce unexpected and possibly even
more significant results.
The peripheral work on the SLC
project is being supported by SLAC's
own resources, according to Panofsky,
because the federal government's de
cision on full construction author
ization and funding will not be made
final until 1983. He added that he is op
timistic that funding will be approved
late next year.
In 1981, it was estimated that the con
struction of SLC would cost more than
SB9 million and have annual operating
expenses over $7 million. It is scheduled
to be completed in 1986.
