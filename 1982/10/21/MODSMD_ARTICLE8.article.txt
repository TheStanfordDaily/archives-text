## Sino-Soviet relations: addressing ideological divergence Communist thaw deemed unlikely 
### 
Compiled from news reports and wire services
Following three years of silence, China and
the Soviet Union are making noises that may
indicate at least a partial reconciliation for
the two communist nations.
Alhough the deep divisions that have
caused the breach between the Soviet Union
and China for two decades show little sign of
healing soon, opinion is that China is
agreeable to easing tense relations between
the two powers.
For months, Moscow has been trying to get
Peking to resume high level talks suspended
after the Soviets intervened in Afghanistan.
Now Chinese leaders have consented to re
sume the talks. Last week Leonid Ilyichev,
the Soviet deputy foreign minister handling
Chinese relations, returned to Peking. Il
yichev indicated he plans to be there for some
time.
Though both sides have expressed a will
ingness to resume detente, Soviet and Chinese
officials recognize that the disputes of ideol
ogy, territory and national pride may hinder
progress. Indeed these issues are com
pounded by Chinese uncertainty over the So
viet presence in Asia.
What may prove to be the bond between re

opening negotiations, however, is resumption
of the talks at a time when both the Soviets
and the Chinese are going through a rocky pe
riod with the United States. There is some
speculation that the Sino-Soviet reconcil
iation is a ploy to encourage the Reagan ad
ministration to be more cooperative. China is
said to be seeking a more conciliatory view of
its involvement in Taiwan while the Soviet
Union is believed to be manuevering to gain
the upper hand in arms issues.
With the central issues still highly de
batable, future improvement looks to be
mainly in the toning down of propaganda as
saults waged between the two powers.
Diplomats predict a cautious breakdown in
barriers including the broadening of com
mercial, academic and athletic exchange.
The largest obstacles to Sino-Soviet de
tente are the conditions China has repeatedly
outlined as crucial to completing an overall
thaw. Hoping for an end to what it terms "so
cial imperialism," particularly in Asia, China
views the Soviet presence along much of its
borders and in Afghanistan as a threat to
world peace.

Deploying Soviet troops on the Chinese
border is a heavy drain on Moscow's re
sources, particularly since the Soviet econo
my is in disarray. Improved relations with
China might allow the Soviets to ease troop
assignments to the area, thereby cutting costs.
Yet the Soviet Union seems intent on main
taining its position in Afghanistan. During a
recent meeting with Soviet Foreign Minister
Andrei Gromyko, Secretary of State George
Shultz said that Soviet troops would not be
withdrawn until Afghan guerrillas were de
feated.
There is conjecture that both sides might be
willing to back down. Soviet negotiators re
portedly have agreed on an agenda for Af
ghanistan discussion that included as a pack
age the three critical areas of Soviet troop
withdrawal, return of refugees and external
guarantees for Afghan security.
In the same vein, Chinese officials indicate
that a commitment by Moscow to reach a
peaceful settlement in Afghanistan might re
sult in far-reaching changes in the Sino-Soviet
relationship.
