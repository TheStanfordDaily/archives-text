Compiled from news reports and wire services
Under economic reforms instituted by the
Chinese government in the last few years, Chi
nese peasants are beginning to enjoy the fruits of
their labor.
The reforms created new agricultural "re
sponsibility systems" that allow the peasants to
be paid according to how much they produce.
Agricultural workers in the past have shared
the income of the commune. But with the new
responsibility systems, enterprising peasants
began hiring workers to help work on large
projects.
For instance, Chen Zhixiong, a peasant on a
farm in southeastern China's Guangdong Prov
ince, contracted with the local production team
to cultivate nearly 50 acres of fishponds. He then
hired some other workers to raise and catch the
fish, paying the workers the equivalent of $50 a
month, four times the average rural earnings.
This presents a quandary for Marxist ideol
ogists, who would argue that anyone who hires

someone to do his work for him is guilty of capi
talist exploitation.
But the Chinese government, while trying to
discourage the practice of hiring labor, has done
nothing to stop it.
One reason may be that agricultural produc
tion has improved under the new system. Ac
cording to some estimates, China's grain harvest
this year could exceed the 1979 record of 322 mil
lion tons, and cotton production may beat last
year's record crop.
Local authorities in some Chinese provinces
have harrassed peasants who were thought to be
earning too much money. But the Communist
government has taken a dim view of this, like
ning it to "whipping a fast ox."
So while the average rural per-capita income
in China was only $130 last year, peasants like
Feng Zuhui earned $5000.
The official press justified this by explaining
that Feng was sharing his wealth by pedaling his
new color television set around on his bicycle.
