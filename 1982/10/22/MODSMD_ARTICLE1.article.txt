# LA 						mayor leads in polls
## Bradley â€“ Deukmejian race heats up in final weeks 
### KEVIN GROSS 
Democrat Tom Bradley, mayor of
Los Angeles, and Republican
George "Duke" Deukmejian, Cali
fornia's attorney general, are charg
ing their campaigns for the final
push in the race that will decide who
will replace Jerry Brown as governor
of California.
The increased hostility in recent

debates in
dicates the
greater
amount of
tension
present in

the campaign as the candidates
move into the homestretch. While
Deukmejian attempts a come-from
behind victory, Bradley continues to
lead in the close race.
According to a recent Los Angeles
Times poll, Bradley has a 48-41 per
cent lead over Deukmejian, in a race
which has seen many shifts in opin
ion. These last 10 days before the
election are crucial to both can
didates.
Indeed, it may already be too late
for Deukmejian, who fired his cam
paign manager, Bill Roberts. Rob
erts had suggested to a reporter that
he was counting on a 5 percent anti
black vote to win the election.

Even more disturbing, however,
was a recent poll in the San Francis
co Examiner that revealed, among
other prejudices, that 12 percent of
the California electorate would not
vote for an Armenian candidate,
while 8 percent would not vote for
any black candidate. One wonders
what this means when Bradley is
black and Deukmejian is Armenian.
Naturally, the validity of the poll
will be questioned, but it still raises
some serious questions about racism
in California politics.
California voters have expressed a

great deal of interest in harsher pen
alties for criminals, as shown by the
passage of Proposition 8 last June
(the "Victim's Bill of Rights") which
has made crime prevention an im
portant issue in the race. Unlike pre
vious governors, both candidates
have compiled strong law enforce
ment records.
As a state senator, Deukmejian
was a leader in introducing tough
crime legislation. Later, as attorney
general, he has concentrated his ef
forts on improving the criminal
prosecution and the law enforce
ment divisions of the attorney gener
al's office.
Bradley, however, is also familiar
with law enforcement. He served for
21 years on the Los Angeles police
force, rising from the rank of foot

News analysis

patrolman to lieutenant. Later, as
mayor, he doubled the police budget
and started new programs to fight
gang violence.
Nonetheless, Deukmejian has
focused on his historically tough rec
ord on crime throughout his cam
paign. He is quick to point out that
he authored California's death pen

alty law and the "use a gun, go to
prison" law, which requires man
datory sentences for criminals who
use firearms in the commission of a
crime. For the most part, this has
helped to raise his image among the
voters in a year where images are
crucial.
Early in 1981, before Deukmejian
had even entered the governor's con
test, columnist Jonathan Kirsch
forecast the potential success of the
crime issue for "California's top
cop." He noted, "Curb has already
banked a million dollars for the 1982

Tom Bradley
governor's race. But no dollar value can
be put on Deukmejian's reputation as a
crime fighter."
By contrast, Bradley has put his em
phasis in the campaign on improving
the state's economy. His literature
starts off with the headline, "Tom Brad
ley has managed a big budget." The lit
erature then goes on to point out his ex
perience in balancing eight consecutive
city budgets, without new tax sources.
According to recent statements, Brad
ley advocates a partnership between
business and labor leaders as a means of
improving business conditions.

any black candidate. One wonders
what this means when Bradley is
black and Deukmejian is Armenian.
Naturally, the validity of the poll
will be questioned, but it still raises
some serious questions about racism
in California politics.
California voters have expressed a

great deal of interest in harsher pen
alties for criminals, as shown by the
passage of Proposition 8 last June
(the "Victim's Bill of Rights") which
has made crime prevention an im
portant issue in the race. Unlike pre
vious governors, both candidates
have compiled strong law enforce
ment records.
As a state senator, Deukmejian
was a leader in introducing tough
crime legislation. Later, as attorney
general, he has concentrated his ef
forts on improving the criminal
prosecution and the law enforce
ment divisions of the attorney gener
al's office.
Bradley, however, is also familiar
with law enforcement. He served for
21 years on the Los Angeles police
force, rising from the rank of foot

patrolman to lieutenant. Later, as
mayor, he doubled the police budget
and started new programs to fight
gang violence.
Nonetheless, Deukmejian has
focused on his historically tough rec
ord on crime throughout his cam
paign. He is quick to point out that
he authored California's death pen

alty law and the "use a gun, go to
prison" law, which requires man
datory sentences for criminals who
use firearms in the commission of a
crime. For the most part, this has
helped to raise his image among the
voters in a year where images are
crucial.
Early in 1981, before Deukmejian
had even entered the governor's con
test, columnist Jonathan Kirsch
forecast the potential success of the
crime issue for "California's top
cop." He noted, "Curb has already
banked a million dollars for the 1982

governor's race. But no dollar value can
be put on Deukmejian's reputation as a
crime fighter."
By contrast, Bradley has put his em
phasis in the campaign on improving
the state's economy. His literature
starts off with the headline, "Tom Brad
ley has managed a big budget." The lit
erature then goes on to point out his ex
perience in balancing eight consecutive
city budgets, without new tax sources.
According to recent statements, Brad
ley advocates a partnership between
business and labor leaders as a means of
improving business conditions.
