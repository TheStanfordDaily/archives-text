# CPPC attempts to increase 'fuzzy' job opportunities
## 
### DAVID KAPLAN 
In the wake of decreasing job op
portunities available for Stanford stu
dents majoring in liberal arts, the Ca
reer Planning and Placement Center
(CPPC) can become a vital resource for
those concerned with what to do with
themselves next June.
The CPPC is currently looking at
ways in which it could increase liberal
arts students' access to job op
portunities, according to newly ap
pointed CPPC director Chris
Shinkman. As a career planning and
placement center, the CPPC is respon
sible for attracting job recruiters from
all fields interested in students for both
summer and permanent positions. The
center offers several workshops on re
sume writing and interview prepara
tion as well as information on in
ternships.
Some students complain, however,
that despite the volume of recruiters
and interview opportunities at the
CPPC, relatively few of these job open
ings are geared toward a liberal arts

background.
"The schedule of recruiters is now
weighted htavily towards technical
people," Shinkman admitted. None
theless, there is hope that an increasing
emphasis will be placed on liberal arts
related job recruiting.
Two sectors of the economy that
could be attracted in greater numbers
to the CPPC are public and non-profit
groups, according to Shinkman.
"We're looking for more balance of re
cruiters between the public and private
sectors," he noted. "There is potential
to draw more employers in . . . social
service, the arts and government at all
levels."
Shinkman, a liberal arts major
himself and an experienced college ad
ministrator, said the CPPC could
further utilize available resources
within the community.
Among these resources are alumni
now employed with, or operating, busi
nesses which would hire students with a
liberal arts background. Bringing
alumni into the recruiting process may

be one of the fastest ways to increase
the number of liberal arts-related posi
tions accessible through the CPPC, ac
cording to Shinkman.
I-or seniors, the CPPC continues this
year the bid-point system for in
terviews. Rather than waiting in un
pleasant, long lines hoping for a space
on an interview schedule, seniors are
given 1 000 points at the beginning of
the school year. When a job interview
becomes available, the interested stu
dents "bid" some portion of their 1000
points. The highest bids will earn a spot
on the interview schedules.
This system is of particular im
portance to liberal arts majors because
it forces each student to rank interview
choices, submitting bids on the basis of
the most important interviews.
According to Shinkman, the bid
process has been enthusiastically re
ceived here so far. But students should
"try and get away from a gambling
motif," he said. The goal of the bid sys
tem is to "encourage people to try and
focus their career interests and gather

'"formation about themselves, not
ra ' se anxiety levels," he continued.
Seniors and underclassmen with lib
eral arts majors who have yet to decide
() n a career path may find counseling
assistance at the C PPC. Workshops are
available to help students focus career
interests. Shinkman said career coun
seling will receive a bigger emphasis in
the future.
'Our desire is to develop and main
tain new links with faculty, emphasiz
ing how what we're doing ties into the
curriculum as part of improving the ca
reer planning aspect of the CPPC," he
said.
Shinkman said the CPPC wishes to
reduce the number of students arriving
in the spring asking "What should I
do?"
"We want to provide more op
portunity for underclassmen to gain
practical experience at the under
graduate level through summer jobs
and internships," he said.

I-or seniors, the CPPC continues this
year the bid-point system for in
terviews. Rather than waiting in un
pleasant, long lines hoping for a space
on an interview schedule, seniors are
given 1 000 points at the beginning of
the school year. When a job interview
becomes available, the interested stu
dents "bid" some portion of their 1000
points. The highest bids will earn a spot
on the interview schedules.
This system is of particular im
portance to liberal arts majors because
it forces each student to rank interview
choices, submitting bids on the basis of
the most important interviews.
According to Shinkman, the bid
process has been enthusiastically re
ceived here so far. But students should
"try and get away from a gambling
motif," he said. The goal of the bid sys
tem is to "encourage people to try and
focus their career interests and gather

'"formation about themselves, not
ra ' se anxiety levels," he continued.
Seniors and underclassmen with lib
eral arts majors who have yet to decide
() n a career path may find counseling
assistance at the C PPC. Workshops are
available to help students focus career
interests. Shinkman said career coun
seling will receive a bigger emphasis in
the future.
'Our desire is to develop and main
tain new links with faculty, emphasiz
ing how what we're doing ties into the
curriculum as part of improving the ca
reer planning aspect of the CPPC," he
said.
Shinkman said the CPPC wishes to
reduce the number of students arriving
in the spring asking "What should I
do?"
"We want to provide more op
portunity for underclassmen to gain
practical experience at the under
graduate level through summer jobs
and internships," he said.
