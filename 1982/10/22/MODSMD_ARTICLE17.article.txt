## The
						Stanford Daily Yes on handgun control 
### 
The National Rifle Association cheered last week
when a state Court of Appeals declared San Fran
cisco's handgun ban unconstitutional. So did the
supporters of Proposition 15, a state initiative on
the Nov. 2 ballot which would give California the
nation's toughest handgun control law.
Does it seem strange? It shouldn't. Both sides ap
plauded the decision because both sides think that
the state must have final authority in handgun con
trol. Both sides are also opposed to outright gun
bans.
And this is why Proposition 15 must be sup
ported. Written in 1980 in the wake of the handgun
murder of former Beatle John Lennon, the in
itiative will force handgun owners to register the
pistols they now own and make it easier for the
courts to lock up criminals who use guns.
Massive lobbying by the NRA and handgun
manufacturers has also created the need for the in
itiative. These organizations have prevented the im
plementation of effective laws to punish people car
rying hidden handguns, creating the present situ
ation where it is felony to carry a concealed club or
brass knuckles and only a misdemeanor to carry a
hidden handgun. Present law requires a 15-day
waiting period before delivery of a new handgun
sold bv a dealer and prohibits the sale of handguns
to felons, narcotic addicts, mental patients or juve
niles. Proposition 15 would levy a minimum six
month jail term for those who carry concealed, un
registered handguns in public.
A controversial provision of the initiative would
also ban new sales of handguns in the state after
April 30, 1983. Opponents of the measure have
pointed to this provision as an unnecessary restric
tion of civil liberties, but these opponents ignore the
fact that there will still be an enormous circulation
pool of guns because the initiative will not preclude
private gun owners from selling their guns or from
dealing rifles and shotguns.
Here are all the provisions of the initiative:
• It would require handgun owners to register all
weapons except curios and relics with the attorney

general by Nov. 2, 1983. No more than one gun
purchased since last Jan. I could be registered per
person.
• It would ban sales of new handguns after April
30, 1983 except to replace guns turned in to author
ities and limit sales to those more than 21 years old.
• It would levy a minimum six-month jail term
for conviction of carrying a concealed, unregistered
handgun in public, and one year for illegal handgun
sales. Judges would be limited in suspending sen
tences.
• It would make possession of an unregistered
handgun in a home or office a misdemeanor subject
to a $500 fine.
• It would make handgun owners whose weapon
is used to harm or kill someone subject to $25,000 in
civil damages.
• It would order police and sheriff departments
to destroy, rather than sell, handguns they collect
every July.
• It would ban import of handguns into the state,
give new residents 45 days to dispose of weapons
and require that future drivers license applications
carry a warning.
• It would limit handgun sales by dealers.
• It would keep registration information con
fidential except for statistical and law enforcement
uses.
• It would bar the legislature from banning or
registering rifles and shotguns.
This last provision is especially significant be
cause it underlines the goal of the proposition. Its
purpose is to limit the numbers of handguns and to
make it more difficult for criminals to acquire
handguns — weapons which are especially harmful
because they are so easy to conceal. It does not in
tend to impose upon the civil liberties of those who
collect guns or those who keep them for protection.
