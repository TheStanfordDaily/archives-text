# The 						University's Puzzle Box
## 
### 
As campus facilities return to a state of quasi
normalcy in the wake of the strike settlement be
tween the University and the United Stanford
Workers we are left a bit puzzled. Perhaps this is be
cause we must wonder: what was the Chinese
Puzzle Box at the core of the strike? We are refer
ring to the administration's secret hidden agenda or
other overriding reason that prevented it from en
gaging in binding arbitration the week before settle
ment.
As the most powerful player in the 'strike game,'
the administration had a moral obligation to bring
the strike to a conclusion at the earliest possible
date. It failed to meet the challenge of this ethical
imperative. Why?
Clearly the administration wants us all to play the
Chinese Puzzle Box game. In this revered pastime,
the player opens the puzzle box, only to discover a
smaller but similar box inside. The player then re
peats the process with this smaller box, only to dis
cover yet a still smaller box, also similar in shape
and design. And so on. Finally, the player comes to
the last box and discovers, lo and behold, that there
is nothing inside! The joke is on the player.
So it is at Stanford. Using press releases and of
ficial pronouncements as puzzle boxes, the admin
istration would prefer that students waste their time
chasing false leads to the strike dilemma, only to

discover a big fat nothing at the end of the trail. Bet
ter vet, the administration probably wishes that
Stanford students would just forget this entire
episode and instead concentrate on John Elway's
exploits.
As a result, we can only guess at the adminis
tration's covert strategy and hidden motivation
during the strike. Did they really wish to 'break' the
union? Who knows? Were they under intense pres
sure, coupled with threats, frpm the alumni and the
board of trustees? Preposterous ideas perhaps, but
the administration has yet to explain the rigidity of
its position, especially toward binding arbitration.
The Puzzle Box dilemma is not limited to stu
dents here, however. There is more than implicit re
sentment lingering around campus both between
workers and the University,and strikers and work
ers who crossed the picket line. Workers have in
dicated dissatisfaction at the strike settlement, and,
regardless of the rectitude of these feelings, the Uni
versity remains obligated to explain to students
why it refused arbitration.
Freedom of information should be a Stanford
community right, not just a federal privilege. As an
old -Carter administration hand, University Presi
dent Donald Kennedy should realize that the de
fense of rights begins at home.
