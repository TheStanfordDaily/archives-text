## Proposition 13 attacks water management issue 
### 
Remember last year and the Per
ipheral Canal? Well, water is on the
ballot again, only this time it is disturb
ing to note the little publicity such an
important proposition is getting in view
of the very real problems we have with
our water legislation. Proposition 13 is
the Water Resources Initiative and it
needs attention. Essentially, Proposi
tion 13 attacks the entire issue of water
use and misuse in California, and if it
passes will finally establish guidelines
for a statewide water management plan
based on conservation and efficient use
of resources.
The initiative covers four basic cate
gories of water use: groundwater over
draft, flood irrigation, instream water
rights and conservation. Excessive
I pumping of groundwater is already a
serious problem in the San Joaquin Val
ley; we are taking out more than we can
! afford. The initiative calls for an end to
; that practice in exchange for the im
plementation of efficient irrigation sys
j tems similar to those already in ex
| istence in other areas of the state. Flood
irrigation is an extravagant yet popular
; method used by Northern Californian
agri-businesses. Proposition 13 aims at
; re-evaluation of pricing systems and al
; location so that those who receive water
• from a project will actually pay what
that water costs, rather than continuing
• to rely on subsidies. Another provision
! deals with the protection of instream

water rights. For the first time petitions
to keep water flowing in rivers will be
honored as seriously as those wanting
to take it out. Last, the initiative will
ensure that interests wanting to dam*,
divert or deplete rivers and lakes or oth
erwise appropriate water will be re
quired to submit a, program which
ensures that the water is to be used in an
efficient and cost-effective manner.
There is also a clause included for the
release of water behind the New
Melones Dam to allow nine miles of the
Stanislaus River to flow once again.
I want to encourage people to find
out more about Proposition 13. It is not
a radical environmentalist demand; it is
a serious and necessary updating of
laws that arc more than 60 years old.
California must protect its water re
sources in terms of its economy as well
as its environment. The Water Re
sources Initiative is not only essential, it
is sensible.

Educational goals
Michael Selmi's article "Education:
An Uncertain Future" (Daily, Oct. 13)

made some worthwhile observations of
the college and employment scene, but
struck me ultimately as simplistic, naive
and somewhat insulting.
For one thing, I question Selmi's
view of engineering, pre-medical and
other pre-professional students as sta
tus-seeking number crunchers
motivated only by a desire for job secur
ity and entry into the 50 percent tax
bracket. There are plenty of stereotypes
about humanities majors, too.
Furthermore, I resent his implication
that a liberal arts background is a prere
quisite to rational thought, and I defy
Selmi to find any engineering class that
requires neither "critical analysis" nor
"logical reasoning."
Equally foolish, but more revealing,
is his suggestion that education and ca
reer are not related. I wonder how many
surgeons he has met in the real world
who "learned their job through their
trade."
For is this not the issue? Career and
education are inseparably, irrevocably
linked. Let's face it: Stanford is as ex
pensive as hell — about $100,000 if you
count four year's missed income. To
"put the outside demands on us out of
our minds," as Selmi suggests, to spend
these four years with no thought to the

next 40 is an option available only to the
cleverest and the wealthiest of us. For
the rest, Selmi's solution is not really a
solution at all, but just another act of
procrastination.
The answer, if one exists, is a recon
ciliation. It is to become both educated
and prepared at the same time, and it
isn't easy. It is pointless.
However, to pooh-pooh other de
partments as "vocational" or "Mickey
Mouse" or "out of touch" is ridiculous,
simply because you really do get out of
Stanford what you put into it, regard
less of whether your undergraduate ma
•jor was biology, classics or petroleum
engineering; and if anybody ever tells
you that you've succeeded or failed be
cause you took these classes and not
those, then you will know whose educa
tion is uncertain.
Leland Stanford wrote in the charter
that the University's purpose was "to
qualify students for personal success
and a directly useful life." Lest Selmi —
or anyone else — try to separate these,
let him remember that you can get aw
fully hungry in a sealed tower, even an
ivory one.
