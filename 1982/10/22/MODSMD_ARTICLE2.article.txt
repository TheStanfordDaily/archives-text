## Tresidder evaluates its space use policy 
### DANA RATLIFF 
Tresidder Union's Space Use Committee is currently eval -
uating the union's services to devise a long-term plan that
would better serve the needs of the Stanford community.
The plan will be presented to the Tresidder Union Board on
November 19.
Pete Ross, a student who chairs the Space Use Committee
said, "Tresidder is not really being all it could be in terms of
fulfilling the community needs on campus."
Ross also commented on several other space needs for
Tresiddcr."we need space for lounging and hanging around,
space on the patio, room for offices, hidden support systems
for food service and for Tresidder business offices." Possible
changes that would allow more space at the union include
expanding Tresidder physically and relocating or reducing
services presently provided. Office and program space is the
main need of Tresidder now, but as Ross said, "Each area
feels they have a need not sufficiently met by space."
A survey taken by the committee last spring revealed the
recreation center, the travel center and the hair styling shop
as the three areas least used by students, faculty and staff.
The survey, which sampled 1032 students, faculty and staff,
found that only 16 percent of the participants had used the
hair styling service and that the salon was most frequently

mentioned as the service that couid be eliminated.
Newell Whitford and Carmelo Cogliandro, who run the
hair salon, said they were distressed by the outcome of the
survey. After the survey came out they feared that their salon
would be eliminated, but since then an avalanche of letters
written bv their clients in support of their service has con
vinced Tresidder management to retain the shop. Now the
biggest problem they face is a possible relocation or a change
in the format of the shop.
James Lyons, dean of student affairs, said the survey was
"misinterpreted and re-misinterpreted" by the those who
felt that the results would lead to the union's dropping of the
hair styling shop. Students and others made false assump
tions about the shop's future, he said. "In an honest study,
you must be prepared to receive negative outcomes," Lyons
added.
But as a consequence of the many letters received in sup
port of the shop, Tresidder management became increasing
ly aware of the value of the shop despite the results of the
survey. Lyons noted that "there is a very faithful following
to the shop" bv senior faculty and administrators.

Tresidder Union, stated in a form letter
mailed to all those who wrote support
letters:"it is clear that we will continue
to work with Newell and Carm to oper
ate a hair styling shop. It is possible that
we will consider relocation of the shop
or alteration of the existing space."

"might be given nine months notice to

that there was that much demand for
our services," he added.
"We feel we have done a good job
taking care of the whole Stanford com
munity ... but in the survey it came
across that we were not taking enough
care of the students," Whitford said.
Whitford claimed the survey was inac
curate in measuring the value of the hair
styling shop because students do not get
their hair cut every day.
Robert Cannon, prqfessor of aero
nautics and astronautics, expressed his
view of the importance of the shop in a
letter. He wrote that the shop "is a place
where students see each other and (per
haps even more important) where we on
the faculty and staff have occasion to go
almost daily, and thus to meet Stan

ford's students in a random and cordial
atmosphere."
In a letter to Whitford from English
Prof. Wilfred Stone, more support of
the shop was offered: "Having patron
ized your shop for 30 years, I simply
cannot imagine Stanford without your
presence here .. . you have never given
anything but the finest service and I re
gard you as a personal friend."
Head Football Coach Paul Wiggin
also wrote in support of Whitford.
Lyons joked that "Wiggin's return to
Stanford may have been because
Newell is the only one who can do his
hair right." Wiggin's Newell-style crew
cut has remained a permanent charac
teristic of his since his return to Stan
ford.

Tresidder Union, stated in a form letter
mailed to all those who wrote support
letters:"it is clear that we will continue
to work with Newell and Carm to oper
ate a hair styling shop. It is possible that
we will consider relocation of the shop
or alteration of the existing space."

that there was that much demand for
our services," he added.
"We feel we have done a good job
taking care of the whole Stanford com
munity ... but in the survey it came
across that we were not taking enough
care of the students," Whitford said.
Whitford claimed the survey was inac
curate in measuring the value of the hair
styling shop because students do not get
their hair cut every day.
Robert Cannon, prqfessor of aero
nautics and astronautics, expressed his
view of the importance of the shop in a
letter. He wrote that the shop "is a place
where students see each other and (per
haps even more important) where we on
the faculty and staff have occasion to go
almost daily, and thus to meet Stan

ford's students in a random and cordial
atmosphere."
In a letter to Whitford from English
Prof. Wilfred Stone, more support of
the shop was offered: "Having patron
ized your shop for 30 years, I simply
cannot imagine Stanford without your
presence here .. . you have never given
anything but the finest service and I re
gard you as a personal friend."
Head Football Coach Paul Wiggin
also wrote in support of Whitford.
Lyons joked that "Wiggin's return to
Stanford may have been because
Newell is the only one who can do his
hair right." Wiggin's Newell-style crew
cut has remained a permanent charac
teristic of his since his return to Stan
ford.
Tresidder Union's Space Use Committee is currently eval -
uating the union's services to devise a long-term plan that
would better serve the needs of the Stanford community.
The plan will be presented to the Tresidder Union Board on
November 19.
Pete Ross, a student who chairs the Space Use Committee
said, "Tresidder is not really being all it could be in terms of
fulfilling the community needs on campus."
Ross also commented on several other space needs for
Tresiddcr."we need space for lounging and hanging around,
space on the patio, room for offices, hidden support systems
for food service and for Tresidder business offices." Possible
changes that would allow more space at the union include
expanding Tresidder physically and relocating or reducing
services presently provided. Office and program space is the
main need of Tresidder now, but as Ross said, "Each area
feels they have a need not sufficiently met by space."
A survey taken by the committee last spring revealed the
recreation center, the travel center and the hair styling shop
as the three areas least used by students, faculty and staff.
The survey, which sampled 1032 students, faculty and staff,
found that only 16 percent of the participants had used the
hair styling service and that the salon was most frequently

mentioned as the service that couid be eliminated.
Newell Whitford and Carmelo Cogliandro, who run the
hair salon, said they were distressed by the outcome of the
survey. After the survey came out they feared that their salon
would be eliminated, but since then an avalanche of letters
written bv their clients in support of their service has con
vinced Tresidder management to retain the shop. Now the
biggest problem they face is a possible relocation or a change
in the format of the shop.
James Lyons, dean of student affairs, said the survey was
"misinterpreted and re-misinterpreted" by the those who
felt that the results would lead to the union's dropping of the
hair styling shop. Students and others made false assump
tions about the shop's future, he said. "In an honest study,
you must be prepared to receive negative outcomes," Lyons
added.
But as a consequence of the many letters received in sup
port of the shop, Tresidder management became increasing
ly aware of the value of the shop despite the results of the
survey. Lyons noted that "there is a very faithful following
to the shop" bv senior faculty and administrators.
Whitford and Cogliandro said they are presently leasing
