## Tresidder evaluates its space use policy 
### DANA RATLIFF 
Tresidder Union's Space Use Committee is currently eval -
uating the union's services to devise a long-term plan that
would better serve the needs of the Stanford community.
The plan will be presented to the Tresidder Union Board on
November 19.
Pete Ross, a student who chairs the Space Use Committee
said, "Tresidder is not really being all it could be in terms of
fulfilling the community needs on campus."
Ross also commented on several other space needs for
Tresiddcr."we need space for lounging and hanging around,
space on the patio, room for offices, hidden support systems
for food service and for Tresidder business offices." Possible
changes that would allow more space at the union include
expanding Tresidder physically and relocating or reducing
services presently provided. Office and program space is the
main need of Tresidder now, but as Ross said, "Each area
feels they have a need not sufficiently met by space."
A survey taken by the committee last spring revealed the
recreation center, the travel center and the hair styling shop
as the three areas least used by students, faculty and staff.
The survey, which sampled 1032 students, faculty and staff,
found that only 16 percent of the participants had used the
hair styling service and that the salon was most frequently

mentioned as the service that couid be eliminated.
Newell Whitford and Carmelo Cogliandro, who run the
hair salon, said they were distressed by the outcome of the
survey. After the survey came out they feared that their salon
would be eliminated, but since then an avalanche of letters
written bv their clients in support of their service has con
vinced Tresidder management to retain the shop. Now the
biggest problem they face is a possible relocation or a change
in the format of the shop.
James Lyons, dean of student affairs, said the survey was
"misinterpreted and re-misinterpreted" by the those who
felt that the results would lead to the union's dropping of the
hair styling shop. Students and others made false assump
tions about the shop's future, he said. "In an honest study,
you must be prepared to receive negative outcomes," Lyons
added.
But as a consequence of the many letters received in sup
port of the shop, Tresidder management became increasing
ly aware of the value of the shop despite the results of the
survey. Lyons noted that "there is a very faithful following
to the shop" bv senior faculty and administrators.
Whitford and Cogliandro said they are presently leasing

in which space is allocated in Tresidder and is consider

services.
