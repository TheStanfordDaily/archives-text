## Pac-, walk-men distort values 
### 
Embedded in the ground beneath the sidewalk in front of
Memorial Church is a series of time capsules Riled with
artifacts chosen by each Stanford graduating class. After 100
years, the capsules are to be unearthed and their contents ex
amined.
If the Class of'B3 were attempting to select items charac
terizing this year, it might decide on a Sony Walkman and a
video game. (We realize that an arcade-size Donkey Kong
might not fit into one of the capsules, but perhaps a hand-

held version or a Pac Man button would suffice.) What
would the inclusion of these items signify to their future ex
aminers? A more important issue we might address is what
their prominence in today's markets signifies about our soci
ety.
The appeal of these new products coupled with the conti
nuing popularity of movies, television, radios and stereos
certainly indicates that Americans spend a great amount of
their leisure time with some form of technological entertain
ment. And entertainment technology joins computerized
education, banking and merchandising to illustrate the in
creasing role of technological advances in many realms.
While some of these innovations add speed and convenience
to our lives, they do so at the expense of our interactions with
each other, just as electronic entertainment replaces people
as the source of our enjoyment. This trend indicates the
erosion of the value we place on human relationships.
I would certainly be inaccurate to assume that technolog
ical advances are causing us to value each other less. A more
accurate view would be that the application of our new tech
nology is one outgrowth of the human desire for independ
ence from all others â€” a desire that we can trace back to the
beginning of recorded history. Men and women have always
sought the security of being strong in themselves, failing to
acknowledge a need for support from anyone else. But, as we
call into question our long-standing propensities for greed
and aggression that have led us to inequality and bloodshed,
we could also reconsider our desire to be alone and self-suffi
cient.

Indeed, this tendency toward establishing complete self
sufficiency is one that many people have warned against.
John Donne branded this an unattainable goal when he
wrote: "No man is an island entire of itself." The author of
Genesis branded it a highly undesirable goal by recording
that after declaring all of creation good in the first creation
account, God in the second account singled out man's alone
ness as the one thing in all of creation that is not good.
Most if not all of us have become convinced of the value of
human interactions. Though people may not be as depen
dable and predictable as computers (and even this is open to
dispute), a human interaction is always unique and fresh.
Human attachments in friendship can also pose some risks,
given our tendency to have problems and weaknesses and to
be able to point these out in one another. But the risks in
volved in relationships bring great rewards of satisfaction
and enjoyment, owing to the incredible richness of human
personality. Electronic machines, of course, offer nothing to
rival human emotions and communication.
Bringing it all back home, what place will other people
have in our lives at Stanford? In addition to the consumerist
trend toward speed and convenience that we share with most
of America, we must contend with the unique expectations
and patterns of Stanford's environment. This climate em
phasizes preparation for a meaningful career so much that it
is easy for a Stanford student to develop an attitude of being

perhaps not an island, but a ship charting its course toward
future goals of success, viewing other people as only interest
ing little islands along the way, or sometimes as obstacles.
Even those who are convinced that people should be a top
priority, that friendship is a goal in itself, find this a difficult
conviction to live by because friendships, unlike academic
requirements, have no deadlines and are thus easier to
forget.
