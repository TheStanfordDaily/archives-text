### SID SPAETH 
Washington State's pow
erhouse that nearly went to the
Rose Bowl last vear has drifted
into an embarrassment.
Counted m the Cougars's 1-4-1
record this season are a 14-14 tie
with Oregon State and a 12-0
blanking from perennial
doormat Colorado. Minnesota,
w ho lost two weeks ago to North
western. hammered Washington
State 41-1 I.

' We still believe in
who we are and the
direction we're
going. Their self
worth hasn't
changed. This is a
good football
team' — Stanford
coach Paul
Wiggin

"We'll be dealing with a frus
trated team this week," Stanford
coach Paul Wiggin said. "But
we're a little frustrated too."
I he powerful Stanford passing
game led by Heisman Trophy
candidate John Hlwav has been
slowed two consecutive weeks to
less than 250 yards passing — an
imposing statistic when related to
the Cardinal's meak running at
tack.

Hlwav's 239-yard passing per
formance against Southern Cali
fornia last week broke the
NCAA record of 25 consecutive
games throwing for over 200
yards held bv former Stanford
quarterback and He ism an
Frophy winner Jim Plunkett.
"John has been the target of
opposing defenses all season,"
Wiggin said. "Although he did
not have one of his better games
last week, he still performed well
enough to break an NCAA rec
ord — a record which indicates
his amazing consistency durine
the past four years."
Hlwav's main target this sea
son has been running back Vin
cent White, who leads the con
ference in receptions with 36.
While reinjured his bruised
shoulder against USC and is
listed as questionable for Wash
ington State.
Chris Dressel, who has caught
24 passes, has become such a
threat from his tight end position
that USC double-teamed him for
much of the game. Six other
Cardinal players have more than
ten receptions.
The Stanford running attack
has been futile, however, chug
ging out only 431 vardsin 176 at
tempts.
"We would like to mix things
better," Wiggin said after last
weekend's 41-21 loss to USC.
"We tried to run earlv, but then
we fell behind, the ground rules
were established and we did our
best to catch up."
Washington State's option at

tack leads the conference in
rushing.
"Washington State is the one
true option team in the con
ference," Wiggin said. "Thev run
the speed and dive option very
well and the combination of their
quarterbacks enables them to
present every type of offense."
Washington State platoons
Clete Casper and Ricky Turner
at quarterback.
Casper, the passer, has com
pleted 50-of-99 passes for 597
yards.
Turner, the runner, has rushed
for 191 yards on 40 carries, but
has completed only 31 percent of
his passes.
As a team, the Cougars aver
age more than 210 yards on the
ground per game. Fullback
James Matthews has pounded
out 432 yards and six touch
downs while halfback Tim Harris
has bolted for 297 yards.
Stanford's defense that was
trampled by IJSC's explosive of
fensive line is phvsicallv hurting.
Both leading tackier Gary
Wimmer and replacement Don
Stubblefield are listed as ques
tionable at inside linebacker for
tomorrow. Hrom one inside line
backer position, Wimmer and
Stubblefield play the key tackling
role on the Stanford defense
along with Matt Soderlund on
the other side.
Noseguard Terry Jackson and
outside linebacker Garin Veris
have six sacks each and have led

conference's top rushing attack tomorrow in Pullman, Wash. The Cougars are the only Pac-10
team to run a true option offense.
