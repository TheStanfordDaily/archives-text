### JOHN KELLY 
Stanford soccer is on a roll.
The Cardinal won its llth
game Wednesday 1-0 over
Cal Siate-Hayward and now
has won seven of its last
eight games.
Stanford, 11-2-1, isgunning
lor one of its best seasons ever
;ilter Wednesday's squeaker
over Havward.
â€¢ I lav ward's attacks kept
Stanford defenders and goal
keeper Willie Burkhardt on
their toes, while at the other
end of the field, the Cardinal
forwards tried to break down
the Havward defense, but the
game turned into a defensive
battle.
I he lone goal that even
tually provided the winning
mark was notched finallv bv
Stanford. Continual pressure
by the Cardinal forwards
forced a foul bv a Havward
defender just outside of the
goal area, and gave Stanford a
tree kick from 20 yards out
side of the goal. Sophomore
midfielder Angel Vazquez has
been the Cardinal's specialist
in free kicks and scored two
goals last week against Pacific
on free kicks.
As Va/quez unleashed his
shot, several players in the
wall of Hayward players
standing 10 feet away from
the ball ducked and the ball
caromed off of a defender's
shoulder and into the net past
the stunned Hayward goal
keeper. That goal proved to
be enough for the margin of
victory, though both teams
had several goalscoring
chances throughout the rest of
the game.
The game was won, how

ever, on defense. Defenders
Mark Talkington and Doug
Clark shut down Hayward's
offense.
Sophomore goalkeeper
Willie Burkhardt recorded
his fifth shutout in eight
games.
The Cardinal has now be
come a team to beat. Stanford
faces St. Mary's tomorrow at
I p.m. at Maloney Field.
A big game looms in the
future in the figure of USF, a
perennial strength the
Cardinal plav at Stanford in
one week.
