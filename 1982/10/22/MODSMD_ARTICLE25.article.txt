The new kid on the block is
supposed to he quiet and shy.
The new kid on the block is not
supposed to make waves. The
new kid on the block is making
noise. Lots of it.
The "new kid" — the Stanford
women's volleyball team — is the
newest member of the Western
Collegiate Athletic Association
and is making waves with its No.
6 national ranking and its 4-1
conference record.
Stanford trails leader San Die
go State which is 6-1.
A bullv stands in the way, how
ever. The bully is the Cardinal's
grueling weekend schedule
against three of the top ten teams
in the country. Stanford takes on
last year's NCAA runner-up,
No. 9 UCLA (1-3) tonight at 7:30
p.m., No. 8 Arizona State (4-2)
tomorrow at 7:30 p.m. and No. 3
Arizona (4-2) at 3 p.m. All are
conference games and will be at
Maples Pavilion.
Leading Stanford into the
weekend will be freshman "wun
derkind" Kim Oden who was just
recently named the WCAA's
player of the week and is leading
the league in hitting percentage
(.471) and kills (16.0 avg.) and is
second in blocks (8.2 avg.).
"These are three crucial home

games for us," assistant coach
Don Shaw said. "We have to
build momentum for that big last
road trip" — the Cardinal's last
five conference games in a row on
the road.
"Right now we're concerned
with UCLA, and then when
UCLA is over with then we'll
start thinking about Arizona
State."
The Bruin that the Cardinal
will be worrying the most about
is setter Jeanne Beauprey who
Shaw describes as "a really good
athlete."
The Cardinal will be going
against one of the best serving
teams in the league against Ari
zona State. The Sun Devils aver
age 57 aces per game. ASU will
also be boosted by the presence
of outside hitters Lisa Stuck and
Valentina Vega who are both
averaging over 12 kills a game.
Pacing Arizona will be Beth
(irupenhoff and Anita Moss,
(irupenhoff is leading the team in
hitting percentage and Moss is
presently averaging over 13 kills
per game.
"You have to take them one at
a time," said Shaw, "that's the
only way you can do it."
And for the new kid on the
block, that's a lot to do.
