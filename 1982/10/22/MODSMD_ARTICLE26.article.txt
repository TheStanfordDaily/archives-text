### CHRIS ADDINGTON 
The No. 9-ranked Pepperdine
water polo team gave No. 2-
ranked Stanford a real run lor its
money yesterday as the < itdinal
eked out a 10-9 victorv ;u de
(iuerre Pool. Nevertheless,
Cardinal coach Dante Det
tamanti insisted afterwards th:il
Stanford's stiffest competition
was still to come.
"This is going to he our
toughest weekend of the year,"
said Dettamanti. With No. 4-
ranked UCLA and No. I tanked
UC-lrvine on the schedule lor to
day and tomorrow respectively,
the Cardinal has water
ahead.
Against Pepperdine. i Curtis
Hanst goal late in the game saved
Stanford after the Cardinal had
squandered a three-goal final pe
riod lead.
Stanford led 9-6 following a
third quarter surge, hut three
Stanford ejections and three Pep
perdine goals shattered the
Cardinal lead and put the score at
9-9 with one minute left to plav.
With Cardinal Tom l.ampert
ejected, Pepperdine pressed the
man-up attack, but a blocked
shot and a Pepperdine ejection
coupled with the score bv Hanst
gave Stanford the victory. John
Tanner scored four goals for the
Cardinal.
The Waves led 3-1 at the end of
the first period, and Stanford had
to fight hard to tie the match at

five when the half-time buzzer
sounded.
"I was reallv disappointed in
our play today," said Dettaman
ti. " There was no togetherness. I
sure hope we pick it up tomor
row."
Dettamanti's hope is well
grounded because today at 3 p.m.
the Cardinal will square off
against UCLA at deGuerre Pool.
I he significance of the game is
magnified not only becauseofthe
Bruins' high national ranking,
but because thev are a Pacific-10
Conference opponent.
"UCLA is a hot and cold
team," Dettamanti said. "Thev
think this is the year for them to
win. It's going to take some solid
polo to beat them," he con
tinued. Besides IJSC, UCLA is
the only school to defeat Stan
ford at home in the last seven
vears.
The Cardinal will face its
toughest competition of the vear
against the UC-lrvine Anteaters
tomorrow morning at 11 a.m.,
also at de( Juerre. Irvine, atop the
college rankings, has not lost to a
collegiate team this vear. Irvine is
paced bv a starting line domi
nated bv seniors and players with
international experience, includ
ing one of collegiate water polo's
finest players, Peter Campbell.
T he Cardinal met UCT earlier
this year in the Irvine Tour
nament where Stanford led 3-0,
onlv to come away with a two
goal defeat.
