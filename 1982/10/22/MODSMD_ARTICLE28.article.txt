# Martin axed again
## 
### Associated Press 
Oakland, Calif. He has kicked dirt on umpires, taken punches at
sportsw riters, players and fans, benched starters during mid-season
and trashed his new office in a disagreement with management.
But he taught the Oakland A s to win, and he gave fans a show
whenever he stormed the field. They'll miss "Billy Ball" now that Billy
Martin has been fired — again.
But all was not fair with Billy or his brand of baseball.
A's fan Ray Murphy thought Martin deserved to be fired "after the
job he didn't do this season. He stopped working hard and was living
on his reputation."
That reputation is for rescuing troubled franchises, and that's what
he did when he came to the A's after the team finished last in the Amer
ican League West in 1979.
He led them to second place in the division in 1980 and first in 1981,
a strike-shortened season highlighted by A's victories in their first 11
games and 17 of their first 18.
