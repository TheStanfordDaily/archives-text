Shultz urges end of pipeline sanctions
Washington — Secretary of State George Shultz is pressing for an agree
ment this weekend or early next week on Western trade relations with the
Soviet Union that would open the door to lifting of the Reagan adminis
tration's controversial pipeline sanctions, according to Western European
diplomats and administration sources.
Shultz reportedly is working with the ambassadors from four European
countries on final details of a communique. Administration sources say
there is general agreement from three of the four — Britain, Italy and West
Germany — but that France continues to object to aspects of the proposed
agreement. This has led to warnings from several officials and diplomats that
any announcement of success could still be some time away.
President Reagan has spoken optimistically to campaign audiences twice
in the past week about his hopes for an agreement with the Europeans that
would replace the sanctions policy, which has been a disruptive issue in the
Atlantic alliance and has brought sharp protests from affected industries
here.
But after Reagan's remarks administration spokesmen also have stressed
that there has been no shift in policy.
The pipeline sanctions were imposed by the administration in retaliation
for martial law last winter in Poland. Reagan is seeking to prevent sale to the
Soviet Union of U.S.-made or U.S.-licensed equipment for use in the natural
gas pipeline the Soviets are building from Siberia to Western Europe.
The administration says the pipeline will earn the Sovi
ets needed cash and leave Europe too dependent on the
Soviets for energy. It has imposed penalties on European
companies that have continued to sell pipeline equip
ment. Europeans have reacted angrily, defending the
pipeline and saying Reagan has no business applying
U.S. law to European firms.
Administration officials said vesterday that Reagan's
campaign statements reflected a basic optimism that
Shulu will be able to reach an agreement rather than any
certain knowledge that an agreement is in hand.
The proposed agreement would contain commitments
in principle on curtailing credits for the Soviet Union,
limiting export of strategically important high-technolo
gy items, capping energy imports from the Soviets and
continuing an embargo on selected items for the pipeline,
according to the sources.
Detailed discussions on these issues would be accom
panied by broader-gauged talks to be joined by Canada
and Japan on a general Western strategv for trade rela
tions between the West and the Soviet bloc.
The fact that the United States now has begun to take
the initiative in trying to find the common ground for a
consensus represents a change in tactics, if not in the goal.
European steel imports curtailed
Washington — The United States and Europe agreed
yesterday to limit shipments of European steel to this
country, ending a bitter dispute and easing tensions in a
strained trading relationship between the allies.
The agreement, reached only hours before a deadline
for the imposition of penalty duties on imported steel,
was accepted bv U.S. steelmakers who had blamed the
imports for contributing to their worst financial crunch
since the Depression.
President Reagan announced the settlement while on a
campaign swing in Omaha, Neb., and hailed it as "good
news" for the steel industry and for the economy.
It will mean, he said, "more and lasting jobs in the steel
industry, which will translate into good news on the em
ployment front."
Had the restrictions been in place in 1981, Commerce
Secretary Malcolm Baldrige said, there would have been
25,000 to 30,000 more jobs for the U.S. industry.
"While we think this will be a shot in the arm for em
ployment in the steel industrv, this is not the answer to all
of their problems," Baldrige cautioned at a White House
news conference.
Etienne Davignon, the European Community industry
commissioner, described the agreement as being "in the
best interest of all steel producers."
He said European companies, also suffering serious fi
nancial woes, will be assured of "an export market and a
market that pays."
In Pittsburgh, U.S. Steel Chairman David Roderick
said the pact covered a wider range of steel products than
did an earlier tentative settlement worked out in August.
The enforcement provisions, he said, were tougher in the
new arrangement.
The pact clears up what has been a "very bitter dis
pute" between the allies, Baldrige said. He added that its
resolution was "a great aid toward eventual solution" of
two other trans-Atlantic trading disputes, one on a com
mon agricultural policy and the other the U.S. sanctions
on sales of oil and gas equipment to the Soviet Union.

Under the settlement, the European Community will
limit its shipments of 11 steel products to this country
starting around Nov. 1 and continuing through 1985.
Arabs forsake Israeli U.N. ouster
I'nited Nations — The 21 -member Arab bloc agreed
yesterday to abandon its drive to oust the Israeli delega
tion from the General Assembly in the face of a U.S.
threat to retaliate by boycotting the session and cutting
off U.N. funds.
Despite the formal decision taken by the Arab League
members yesterday morning at a closed meeting, how
ever, there was no certainty that the issue was over.
Both Arab and Western diplomats conceded that Iran
— which is not bound by the Arab decision — might still
make an anti-Israel motion when the assembly meets
Monday to consider members' credentials.
Even if Iran acts, both moderate Arab and Western
diplomats expressed confidence that it would fail to win a
majority because of the U.S. lobbying and the absence of
official Arab support.
The drive against Israeli U.N. representation stemmed
from a decision of Arab foreign ministers in Tunis on
Sept. 22 in the wake of the Beirut massacre.
Two days later, Israeli credentials were rejected by a
41-39 vote on the last day of a meeting of the Interna
tional Atomic Energy Agency, a U.N. affiliate.
Then Algeria moved to expel Israel from another U.N.
agency, the International Telecommunications Union, at
a meeting in Nairobi.
(Reuter reported yesterday that the effort was effec
tively defeated when the paragraph calling for Israel's ex
pulsion was ordered deleted by a 61-57 vote by the ITU
delegates.)
Arab diplomats said that instead of forcing a vote on
Monday they will submit a letter expressing their reserva
tions on Israel's representation, citing its defiance of
U.N. resolutions on the Middle East.
The letter — a face saving device used against Israel in
the past — will be open for other delegations to sign as
well, but will have no practical impact on Israel's privi
leges as a U.N. member.
Pope John Paul welcomes Gemayel
Vatican City — Pope John Paul II warmly embraced
President Amin Gemayel of Lebanon at a Vatican au
dience yesterday and endorsed the president's call for
withdrawing all foreign troops from war-ravaged Leba
non.
Despite tight security, Gemayel was treated to an
elaborate welcome usually reserved for official visits,
complete with a review of Swiss guards assigned to the
Vatican. The Vatican called the visit private.
Italian authorities deployed helicopters and riot police
for Gemayel's arrival a day after terrorists bombed the
Lebanese Embassy in Rome. He traveled by military heli
copter from one meeting place to another, using a bullet
proof limousine only for short distances.
Gemayel was on the last stop of a tour that took him to
the United States and France in search of political sup
port for the withdrawal of Israeli, Syrian and Palestinian
forces that made Lebanon a battleground this summer.
Specifically, the president wants a tenfold increase in
the 3800-man multinational peacekeeping force in Beirut

that includes U.S. Marines, French and Italian soldiers.
He also is asking for $12 billion in long-term economic
assistance.
Hassan outlines Arab peace plan
Washington — As President Reagan prepared to meet
today with an Arab League delegation headed by King
Hassan of Morocco, a senior State Department official
said yesterday the Arab countries must "come out of the
closet" and make clear whether thev are willing to recog
nize Israel.
The official, who spoke with reporters on condition he
not be identified, was referring to what he called "con
structive elements" in the declaration adopted last month
by Arab states at Fez, Morocco, as their plan for resolv
ing the Arab-Israeli conflict.
The Hassan delegation's purpose is to explain the Fez
plan to Reagan and to discuss the U.S. peace initiative
outlined bv the president on Sept. I. The administration
has been careful to describe today's White House meeting
as an exchange of views rather than negotiations, but the
senior official stressed that the United States intends to
press the Arabs to be more explicit about such aspects of
the Fez plan as a provision implying recognition of Is
rael's right to exist.
The core of the Reagan initiative calls for these territo
ries to gain eventual independence "in association with
Jordan." The Fez declaration, however, reaffirms the
traditional Arab position that the territories must be
come an independent Palestinian state under the leader
ship of the Palestine Liberation Organization.
Secretary of State George Schultz met yesterday with
Israeli Foreign Minister Yitzhak Shamir for the third
time in a week to discuss the other major Mideast prob
lem preoccupying the United States — the withdrawal of
foreign forces from Lebanon. Sources on both sides said
the meeting was primarily to inform Shamir about Rea
gan's meeting Tuesday with Lebanese President Amin
Gemayel.
Admin, ignores rights violations
Washington — Despite twice certifying human rights
progress in El Salvador, the Reagan administration has
done little to investigate allegations that Salvadoran se
curity forces have killed thousands of unarmed civilians,
according to U.S. officials and a House report.
These sources say U.S. intelligence agencies have de
veloped scant information on the government's alleged
involvement in rightist death squads and charges that
Salvadoran troops fire on non-combatants during sweeps
through the countryside.
But while there is a general consensus on the lack of
information, the reasons suggested for it vary.
Some say scarce intelligence resources had to be de
voted to studying the leftist insurgency. Others cite the
ban on U.S. military advisers going with troops into com
bat areas and the difficulty of assessing criminal cases in
another country.
Still others suggest the administration does not want
information that could embarrass the U.S.-backed gov
ernment.

Chevron strikes huge new field
Los Angeles — In what is believed to be one of the most
significant U.S. oil finds in more than a decade, Chevron
U.S.A. Inc. and Phillips Petroleum Co. announced yes
terday that they have discovered a giant offshore oil field,
holding at least 100 million recoverable barrels. The field
is 40 miles west of Point Conception, which is 120 miles
northwest of Los Angeles.
The field's exact potential cannot yet be determined,
but industry sources believe that Chevron's estimate may
be conservative, and that the field could produce as many
as 500 million barrels. If so, it would be one of the largest
discoveries since the late 19605, confirming an industry
view of California as one of the nation's most promising
offshore drilling prospects.
Garcia Marquez receives Nobel
Stockholm — Gabriel Garcia Marquez, Colombian
author of the novel "One Hundred Years of Solitude"
and the world's best-selling writer in the Spanish lan
guage, was awarded the 1982 Nobel Prize in literature
yesterday.
It was the first Nobel award to a Colombian in the 79
years the prestigious prizes have been given and the sec
ond for Latin America this year. Former Foreign
M inister Alfonso Garcia Robles of Mexico, co-winner of
the peace prize, was his country's first winner.
A leftist and active political journalist, Garcia Mar
quez has lived in Mexico for 20 years and has received
death threats from ultra-rightists in his native countrty.
Brown accused of campaign misdeed
Washington — Rep. Robert Dornan (R-Calif.), filed a
complaint yesterday with the Federal Election Com
mission against California Gov. Brown and four other
Democrats alleging that they have accepted illegal cam
paign contributions from unions.
Dornan, using information gathered by the Center on
National Labor Policy, in Vienna, Va., named in addi
tion to Brown: Sen. Daniel Moynihan (D-N.Y.), Rep.
James Howard (D-N.J.), and former Reps. Bill Gunter
(D-Fla.) and Frank Thompson (D-N.J.). Gunter and
Thompson were charged with accepting illegal contribu
tions in 1980.
Market lumbers ahead
The stock market's rally sputtered in heavy trading
yesterday and prices closed mixed, but the Dow Jones in
dustrial average managed a slight gain that lifted the
measure to its highest level in nearly 10 years.
Despite the mixed showing, there were signs of the
market s continued strength. The Dow Jones average of
20 transportation stocks posted a sharp gain and 454
New York Stock Exchange-listed issues reached new 52-
week highs.
Today's weather
Rain likely with 70 percent chance today, decreasing to
40 percent Saturday. Highs in 60s. Lows in 50s.

Italian authorities deployed helicopters and riot police
for Gemayel's arrival a day after terrorists bombed the

Gemayel was on the last stop of a tour that took him to
the United States and France in search of political sup

forces that made Lebanon a battleground this summer.
Specifically, the president wants a tenfold increase in

Hassan outlines Arab peace plan
Washington — As President Reagan prepared to meet
today with an Arab League delegation headed by King
Hassan of Morocco, a senior State Department official
said yesterday the Arab countries must "come out of the
closet" and make clear whether thev are willing to recog
nize Israel.
The official, who spoke with reporters on condition he
not be identified, was referring to what he called "con
structive elements" in the declaration adopted last month
by Arab states at Fez, Morocco, as their plan for resolv
ing the Arab-Israeli conflict.
The Hassan delegation's purpose is to explain the Fez
plan to Reagan and to discuss the U.S. peace initiative
outlined bv the president on Sept. I. The administration
has been careful to describe today's White House meeting
as an exchange of views rather than negotiations, but the
senior official stressed that the United States intends to
press the Arabs to be more explicit about such aspects of
the Fez plan as a provision implying recognition of Is
rael's right to exist.
The core of the Reagan initiative calls for these territo
ries to gain eventual independence "in association with
Jordan." The Fez declaration, however, reaffirms the
traditional Arab position that the territories must be
come an independent Palestinian state under the leader
ship of the Palestine Liberation Organization.
Secretary of State George Schultz met yesterday with
Israeli Foreign Minister Yitzhak Shamir for the third
time in a week to discuss the other major Mideast prob
lem preoccupying the United States — the withdrawal of
foreign forces from Lebanon. Sources on both sides said
the meeting was primarily to inform Shamir about Rea
gan's meeting Tuesday with Lebanese President Amin
Gemayel.
Admin, ignores rights violations
Washington — Despite twice certifying human rights
progress in El Salvador, the Reagan administration has
done little to investigate allegations that Salvadoran se
curity forces have killed thousands of unarmed civilians,
according to U.S. officials and a House report.
These sources say U.S. intelligence agencies have de
veloped scant information on the government's alleged
involvement in rightist death squads and charges that
Salvadoran troops fire on non-combatants during sweeps
through the countryside.
But while there is a general consensus on the lack of
information, the reasons suggested for it vary.
Some say scarce intelligence resources had to be de
voted to studying the leftist insurgency. Others cite the
ban on U.S. military advisers going with troops into com
bat areas and the difficulty of assessing criminal cases in
another country.
Still others suggest the administration does not want
information that could embarrass the U.S.-backed gov

Chevron strikes huge new field
Los Angeles — In what is believed to be one of the most
significant U.S. oil finds in more than a decade, Chevron
U.S.A. Inc. and Phillips Petroleum Co. announced yes
terday that they have discovered a giant offshore oil field,
holding at least 100 million recoverable barrels. The field
is 40 miles west of Point Conception, which is 120 miles
northwest of Los Angeles.
The field's exact potential cannot yet be determined,
but industry sources believe that Chevron's estimate may
be conservative, and that the field could produce as many
as 500 million barrels. If so, it would be one of the largest
discoveries since the late 19605, confirming an industry
view of California as one of the nation's most promising
offshore drilling prospects.
Garcia Marquez receives Nobel
Stockholm — Gabriel Garcia Marquez, Colombian

It was the first Nobel award to a Colombian in the 79

A leftist and active political journalist, Garcia Mar

Shultz urges end of pipeline sanctions
Washington — Secretary of State George Shultz is pressing for an agree
ment this weekend or early next week on Western trade relations with the
Soviet Union that would open the door to lifting of the Reagan adminis
tration's controversial pipeline sanctions, according to Western European
diplomats and administration sources.
Shultz reportedly is working with the ambassadors from four European
countries on final details of a communique. Administration sources say
there is general agreement from three of the four — Britain, Italy and West
Germany — but that France continues to object to aspects of the proposed
agreement. This has led to warnings from several officials and diplomats that
any announcement of success could still be some time away.
President Reagan has spoken optimistically to campaign audiences twice
in the past week about his hopes for an agreement with the Europeans that
would replace the sanctions policy, which has been a disruptive issue in the
Atlantic alliance and has brought sharp protests from affected industries
here.
But after Reagan's remarks administration spokesmen also have stressed
that there has been no shift in policy.
The pipeline sanctions were imposed by the administration in retaliation
for martial law last winter in Poland. Reagan is seeking to prevent sale to the
Soviet Union of U.S.-made or U.S.-licensed equipment for use in the natural
gas pipeline the Soviets are building from Siberia to Western Europe.
The administration says the pipeline will earn the Sovi
ets needed cash and leave Europe too dependent on the
Soviets for energy. It has imposed penalties on European
companies that have continued to sell pipeline equip
ment. Europeans have reacted angrily, defending the
pipeline and saying Reagan has no business applying
U.S. law to European firms.
Administration officials said vesterday that Reagan's
campaign statements reflected a basic optimism that
Shulu will be able to reach an agreement rather than any
certain knowledge that an agreement is in hand.
The proposed agreement would contain commitments
in principle on curtailing credits for the Soviet Union,
limiting export of strategically important high-technolo
gy items, capping energy imports from the Soviets and
continuing an embargo on selected items for the pipeline,
according to the sources.
Detailed discussions on these issues would be accom
panied by broader-gauged talks to be joined by Canada
and Japan on a general Western strategv for trade rela
tions between the West and the Soviet bloc.
The fact that the United States now has begun to take
the initiative in trying to find the common ground for a
consensus represents a change in tactics, if not in the goal.
European steel imports curtailed
Washington — The United States and Europe agreed
yesterday to limit shipments of European steel to this
country, ending a bitter dispute and easing tensions in a
strained trading relationship between the allies.
The agreement, reached only hours before a deadline
for the imposition of penalty duties on imported steel,
was accepted bv U.S. steelmakers who had blamed the
imports for contributing to their worst financial crunch
since the Depression.
President Reagan announced the settlement while on a
campaign swing in Omaha, Neb., and hailed it as "good
news" for the steel industry and for the economy.
It will mean, he said, "more and lasting jobs in the steel
industry, which will translate into good news on the em
ployment front."
Had the restrictions been in place in 1981, Commerce
Secretary Malcolm Baldrige said, there would have been
25,000 to 30,000 more jobs for the U.S. industry.
"While we think this will be a shot in the arm for em
ployment in the steel industrv, this is not the answer to all
of their problems," Baldrige cautioned at a White House
news conference.
Etienne Davignon, the European Community industry
commissioner, described the agreement as being "in the
best interest of all steel producers."
He said European companies, also suffering serious fi
nancial woes, will be assured of "an export market and a
market that pays."
In Pittsburgh, U.S. Steel Chairman David Roderick
said the pact covered a wider range of steel products than
did an earlier tentative settlement worked out in August.
The enforcement provisions, he said, were tougher in the
new arrangement.
The pact clears up what has been a "very bitter dis
pute" between the allies, Baldrige said. He added that its
resolution was "a great aid toward eventual solution" of
two other trans-Atlantic trading disputes, one on a com
mon agricultural policy and the other the U.S. sanctions
on sales of oil and gas equipment to the Soviet Union.

Under the settlement, the European Community will
limit its shipments of 11 steel products to this country
starting around Nov. 1 and continuing through 1985.
Arabs forsake Israeli U.N. ouster
I'nited Nations — The 21 -member Arab bloc agreed
yesterday to abandon its drive to oust the Israeli delega
tion from the General Assembly in the face of a U.S.
threat to retaliate by boycotting the session and cutting
off U.N. funds.
Despite the formal decision taken by the Arab League
members yesterday morning at a closed meeting, how
ever, there was no certainty that the issue was over.
Both Arab and Western diplomats conceded that Iran
— which is not bound by the Arab decision — might still
make an anti-Israel motion when the assembly meets
Monday to consider members' credentials.
Even if Iran acts, both moderate Arab and Western
diplomats expressed confidence that it would fail to win a
majority because of the U.S. lobbying and the absence of
official Arab support.
The drive against Israeli U.N. representation stemmed
from a decision of Arab foreign ministers in Tunis on
Sept. 22 in the wake of the Beirut massacre.
Two days later, Israeli credentials were rejected by a
41-39 vote on the last day of a meeting of the Interna
tional Atomic Energy Agency, a U.N. affiliate.
Then Algeria moved to expel Israel from another U.N.
agency, the International Telecommunications Union, at
a meeting in Nairobi.
(Reuter reported yesterday that the effort was effec
tively defeated when the paragraph calling for Israel's ex
pulsion was ordered deleted by a 61-57 vote by the ITU
delegates.)
Arab diplomats said that instead of forcing a vote on
Monday they will submit a letter expressing their reserva
tions on Israel's representation, citing its defiance of
U.N. resolutions on the Middle East.
The letter — a face saving device used against Israel in
the past — will be open for other delegations to sign as
well, but will have no practical impact on Israel's privi
leges as a U.N. member.
Pope John Paul welcomes Gemayel
Vatican City — Pope John Paul II warmly embraced
President Amin Gemayel of Lebanon at a Vatican au

withdrawing all foreign troops from war-ravaged Leba

Despite tight security, Gemayel was treated to an
elaborate welcome usually reserved for official visits,
complete with a review of Swiss guards assigned to the
Vatican. The Vatican called the visit private.
Italian authorities deployed helicopters and riot police

President Reagan has spoken optimistically to campaign audiences twice
in the past week about his hopes for an agreement with the Europeans that
would replace the sanctions policy, which has been a disruptive issue in the
Atlantic alliance and has brought sharp protests from affected industries
here.
But after Reagan's remarks administration spokesmen also have stressed
that there has been no shift in policy.
The pipeline sanctions were imposed by the administration in retaliation
for martial law last winter in Poland. Reagan is seeking to prevent sale to the
Soviet Union of U.S.-made or U.S.-licensed equipment for use in the natural
gas pipeline the Soviets are building from Siberia to Western Europe.
The administration says the pipeline will earn the Sovi
ets needed cash and leave Europe too dependent on the
Soviets for energy. It has imposed penalties on European
companies that have continued to sell pipeline equip
ment. Europeans have reacted angrily, defending the
pipeline and saying Reagan has no business applying
U.S. law to European firms.
Administration officials said vesterday that Reagan's
campaign statements reflected a basic optimism that
Shulu will be able to reach an agreement rather than any
certain knowledge that an agreement is in hand.
The proposed agreement would contain commitments
in principle on curtailing credits for the Soviet Union,
limiting export of strategically important high-technolo
gy items, capping energy imports from the Soviets and
continuing an embargo on selected items for the pipeline,
according to the sources.
Detailed discussions on these issues would be accom
panied by broader-gauged talks to be joined by Canada
and Japan on a general Western strategv for trade rela
tions between the West and the Soviet bloc.
The fact that the United States now has begun to take
the initiative in trying to find the common ground for a
consensus represents a change in tactics, if not in the goal.
European steel imports curtailed
Washington — The United States and Europe agreed
yesterday to limit shipments of European steel to this
country, ending a bitter dispute and easing tensions in a
strained trading relationship between the allies.
The agreement, reached only hours before a deadline
for the imposition of penalty duties on imported steel,
was accepted bv U.S. steelmakers who had blamed the
imports for contributing to their worst financial crunch
since the Depression.
President Reagan announced the settlement while on a
campaign swing in Omaha, Neb., and hailed it as "good
news" for the steel industry and for the economy.
It will mean, he said, "more and lasting jobs in the steel
industry, which will translate into good news on the em
ployment front."
Had the restrictions been in place in 1981, Commerce
Secretary Malcolm Baldrige said, there would have been
25,000 to 30,000 more jobs for the U.S. industry.
"While we think this will be a shot in the arm for em
ployment in the steel industrv, this is not the answer to all
of their problems," Baldrige cautioned at a White House
news conference.
Etienne Davignon, the European Community industry
commissioner, described the agreement as being "in the
best interest of all steel producers."
He said European companies, also suffering serious fi
nancial woes, will be assured of "an export market and a
market that pays."
In Pittsburgh, U.S. Steel Chairman David Roderick
said the pact covered a wider range of steel products than
did an earlier tentative settlement worked out in August.
The enforcement provisions, he said, were tougher in the
new arrangement.
The pact clears up what has been a "very bitter dis
pute" between the allies, Baldrige said. He added that its
resolution was "a great aid toward eventual solution" of
two other trans-Atlantic trading disputes, one on a com
mon agricultural policy and the other the U.S. sanctions
on sales of oil and gas equipment to the Soviet Union.

Under the settlement, the European Community will
limit its shipments of 11 steel products to this country
starting around Nov. 1 and continuing through 1985.
Arabs forsake Israeli U.N. ouster
I'nited Nations — The 21 -member Arab bloc agreed
yesterday to abandon its drive to oust the Israeli delega
tion from the General Assembly in the face of a U.S.
threat to retaliate by boycotting the session and cutting
off U.N. funds.
Despite the formal decision taken by the Arab League
members yesterday morning at a closed meeting, how
ever, there was no certainty that the issue was over.
Both Arab and Western diplomats conceded that Iran
— which is not bound by the Arab decision — might still
make an anti-Israel motion when the assembly meets
Monday to consider members' credentials.
Even if Iran acts, both moderate Arab and Western
diplomats expressed confidence that it would fail to win a
majority because of the U.S. lobbying and the absence of
official Arab support.
The drive against Israeli U.N. representation stemmed
from a decision of Arab foreign ministers in Tunis on
Sept. 22 in the wake of the Beirut massacre.
Two days later, Israeli credentials were rejected by a
41-39 vote on the last day of a meeting of the Interna
tional Atomic Energy Agency, a U.N. affiliate.
Then Algeria moved to expel Israel from another U.N.
agency, the International Telecommunications Union, at
a meeting in Nairobi.
(Reuter reported yesterday that the effort was effec
tively defeated when the paragraph calling for Israel's ex
pulsion was ordered deleted by a 61-57 vote by the ITU
delegates.)
Arab diplomats said that instead of forcing a vote on
Monday they will submit a letter expressing their reserva
tions on Israel's representation, citing its defiance of
U.N. resolutions on the Middle East.
The letter — a face saving device used against Israel in
the past — will be open for other delegations to sign as
well, but will have no practical impact on Israel's privi
leges as a U.N. member.
Pope John Paul welcomes Gemayel
Vatican City — Pope John Paul II warmly embraced
President Amin Gemayel of Lebanon at a Vatican au
dience yesterday and endorsed the president's call for
withdrawing all foreign troops from war-ravaged Leba
non.
Despite tight security, Gemayel was treated to an
elaborate welcome usually reserved for official visits,
complete with a review of Swiss guards assigned to the
Vatican. The Vatican called the visit private.
Italian authorities deployed helicopters and riot police
for Gemayel's arrival a day after terrorists bombed the
Lebanese Embassy in Rome. He traveled by military heli
copter from one meeting place to another, using a bullet
proof limousine only for short distances.
Gemayel was on the last stop of a tour that took him to
the United States and France in search of political sup
port for the withdrawal of Israeli, Syrian and Palestinian
forces that made Lebanon a battleground this summer.
Specifically, the president wants a tenfold increase in
the 3800-man multinational peacekeeping force in Beirut

that includes U.S. Marines, French and Italian soldiers.
He also is asking for $12 billion in long-term economic
assistance.
Hassan outlines Arab peace plan
Washington — As President Reagan prepared to meet
today with an Arab League delegation headed by King
Hassan of Morocco, a senior State Department official
said yesterday the Arab countries must "come out of the
closet" and make clear whether thev are willing to recog
nize Israel.
The official, who spoke with reporters on condition he
not be identified, was referring to what he called "con
structive elements" in the declaration adopted last month
by Arab states at Fez, Morocco, as their plan for resolv
ing the Arab-Israeli conflict.
The Hassan delegation's purpose is to explain the Fez
plan to Reagan and to discuss the U.S. peace initiative
outlined bv the president on Sept. I. The administration
has been careful to describe today's White House meeting
as an exchange of views rather than negotiations, but the
senior official stressed that the United States intends to
press the Arabs to be more explicit about such aspects of
the Fez plan as a provision implying recognition of Is
rael's right to exist.
The core of the Reagan initiative calls for these territo
ries to gain eventual independence "in association with
Jordan." The Fez declaration, however, reaffirms the
traditional Arab position that the territories must be
come an independent Palestinian state under the leader
ship of the Palestine Liberation Organization.
Secretary of State George Schultz met yesterday with
Israeli Foreign Minister Yitzhak Shamir for the third
time in a week to discuss the other major Mideast prob
lem preoccupying the United States — the withdrawal of
foreign forces from Lebanon. Sources on both sides said
the meeting was primarily to inform Shamir about Rea
gan's meeting Tuesday with Lebanese President Amin
Gemayel.
Admin, ignores rights violations
Washington — Despite twice certifying human rights
progress in El Salvador, the Reagan administration has
done little to investigate allegations that Salvadoran se
curity forces have killed thousands of unarmed civilians,
according to U.S. officials and a House report.
These sources say U.S. intelligence agencies have de
veloped scant information on the government's alleged
involvement in rightist death squads and charges that
Salvadoran troops fire on non-combatants during sweeps
through the countryside.
But while there is a general consensus on the lack of
information, the reasons suggested for it vary.
Some say scarce intelligence resources had to be de
voted to studying the leftist insurgency. Others cite the
ban on U.S. military advisers going with troops into com
bat areas and the difficulty of assessing criminal cases in
another country.
Still others suggest the administration does not want
information that could embarrass the U.S.-backed gov
ernment.

Chevron strikes huge new field
Los Angeles — In what is believed to be one of the most
significant U.S. oil finds in more than a decade, Chevron
U.S.A. Inc. and Phillips Petroleum Co. announced yes
terday that they have discovered a giant offshore oil field,
holding at least 100 million recoverable barrels. The field
is 40 miles west of Point Conception, which is 120 miles
northwest of Los Angeles.
The field's exact potential cannot yet be determined,
but industry sources believe that Chevron's estimate may
be conservative, and that the field could produce as many
as 500 million barrels. If so, it would be one of the largest
discoveries since the late 19605, confirming an industry
view of California as one of the nation's most promising
offshore drilling prospects.
Garcia Marquez receives Nobel
Stockholm — Gabriel Garcia Marquez, Colombian
author of the novel "One Hundred Years of Solitude"
and the world's best-selling writer in the Spanish lan
guage, was awarded the 1982 Nobel Prize in literature
yesterday.
It was the first Nobel award to a Colombian in the 79
years the prestigious prizes have been given and the sec
ond for Latin America this year. Former Foreign
M inister Alfonso Garcia Robles of Mexico, co-winner of
the peace prize, was his country's first winner.
A leftist and active political journalist, Garcia Mar
quez has lived in Mexico for 20 years and has received
death threats from ultra-rightists in his native countrty.
Brown accused of campaign misdeed
Washington — Rep. Robert Dornan (R-Calif.), filed a
complaint yesterday with the Federal Election Com
mission against California Gov. Brown and four other
Democrats alleging that they have accepted illegal cam
paign contributions from unions.
Dornan, using information gathered by the Center on
National Labor Policy, in Vienna, Va., named in addi
tion to Brown: Sen. Daniel Moynihan (D-N.Y.), Rep.
James Howard (D-N.J.), and former Reps. Bill Gunter
(D-Fla.) and Frank Thompson (D-N.J.). Gunter and
Thompson were charged with accepting illegal contribu
tions in 1980.
Market lumbers ahead
The stock market's rally sputtered in heavy trading
yesterday and prices closed mixed, but the Dow Jones in
dustrial average managed a slight gain that lifted the
measure to its highest level in nearly 10 years.
Despite the mixed showing, there were signs of the
market s continued strength. The Dow Jones average of
20 transportation stocks posted a sharp gain and 454
New York Stock Exchange-listed issues reached new 52-
week highs.

Shultz urges end of pipeline sanctions
Washington — Secretary of State George Shultz is pressing for an agree
ment this weekend or early next week on Western trade relations with the
Soviet Union that would open the door to lifting of the Reagan adminis
tration's controversial pipeline sanctions, according to Western European
diplomats and administration sources.
Shultz reportedly is working with the ambassadors from four European
countries on final details of a communique. Administration sources say
there is general agreement from three of the four — Britain, Italy and West
Germany — but that France continues to object to aspects of the proposed
agreement. This has led to warnings from several officials and diplomats that
any announcement of success could still be some time away.

Hassan outlines Arab peace plan
Washington — As President Reagan prepared to meet
today with an Arab League delegation headed by King
Hassan of Morocco, a senior State Department official
said yesterday the Arab countries must "come out of the
closet" and make clear whether thev are willing to recog
nize Israel.
The official, who spoke with reporters on condition he
not be identified, was referring to what he called "con
structive elements" in the declaration adopted last month
by Arab states at Fez, Morocco, as their plan for resolv
ing the Arab-Israeli conflict.
The Hassan delegation's purpose is to explain the Fez
plan to Reagan and to discuss the U.S. peace initiative
outlined bv the president on Sept. I. The administration
has been careful to describe today's White House meeting
as an exchange of views rather than negotiations, but the
senior official stressed that the United States intends to
press the Arabs to be more explicit about such aspects of
the Fez plan as a provision implying recognition of Is
rael's right to exist.
The core of the Reagan initiative calls for these territo
ries to gain eventual independence "in association with
Jordan." The Fez declaration, however, reaffirms the
traditional Arab position that the territories must be
come an independent Palestinian state under the leader
ship of the Palestine Liberation Organization.
Secretary of State George Schultz met yesterday with
Israeli Foreign Minister Yitzhak Shamir for the third
time in a week to discuss the other major Mideast prob
lem preoccupying the United States — the withdrawal of
foreign forces from Lebanon. Sources on both sides said
the meeting was primarily to inform Shamir about Rea
gan's meeting Tuesday with Lebanese President Amin
Gemayel.
Admin, ignores rights violations
Washington — Despite twice certifying human rights
progress in El Salvador, the Reagan administration has
done little to investigate allegations that Salvadoran se
curity forces have killed thousands of unarmed civilians,
according to U.S. officials and a House report.
These sources say U.S. intelligence agencies have de
veloped scant information on the government's alleged
involvement in rightist death squads and charges that
Salvadoran troops fire on non-combatants during sweeps
through the countryside.
But while there is a general consensus on the lack of
information, the reasons suggested for it vary.
Some say scarce intelligence resources had to be de
voted to studying the leftist insurgency. Others cite the
ban on U.S. military advisers going with troops into com
bat areas and the difficulty of assessing criminal cases in
another country.
Still others suggest the administration does not want
information that could embarrass the U.S.-backed gov
ernment.

Chevron strikes huge new field
Los Angeles — In what is believed to be one of the most
significant U.S. oil finds in more than a decade, Chevron
U.S.A. Inc. and Phillips Petroleum Co. announced yes
terday that they have discovered a giant offshore oil field,
holding at least 100 million recoverable barrels. The field
is 40 miles west of Point Conception, which is 120 miles
northwest of Los Angeles.
The field's exact potential cannot yet be determined,
but industry sources believe that Chevron's estimate may
be conservative, and that the field could produce as many
as 500 million barrels. If so, it would be one of the largest
discoveries since the late 19605, confirming an industry
view of California as one of the nation's most promising
offshore drilling prospects.
Garcia Marquez receives Nobel
Stockholm — Gabriel Garcia Marquez, Colombian
author of the novel "One Hundred Years of Solitude"
and the world's best-selling writer in the Spanish lan
guage, was awarded the 1982 Nobel Prize in literature
yesterday.
It was the first Nobel award to a Colombian in the 79
years the prestigious prizes have been given and the sec
ond for Latin America this year. Former Foreign
M inister Alfonso Garcia Robles of Mexico, co-winner of
the peace prize, was his country's first winner.
A leftist and active political journalist, Garcia Mar
quez has lived in Mexico for 20 years and has received
death threats from ultra-rightists in his native countrty.
Brown accused of campaign misdeed
Washington — Rep. Robert Dornan (R-Calif.), filed a
complaint yesterday with the Federal Election Com
mission against California Gov. Brown and four other
Democrats alleging that they have accepted illegal cam
paign contributions from unions.

National Labor Policy, in Vienna, Va., named in addi
tion to Brown: Sen. Daniel Moynihan (D-N.Y.), Rep.
James Howard (D-N.J.), and former Reps. Bill Gunter
(D-Fla.) and Frank Thompson (D-N.J.). Gunter and
Thompson were charged with accepting illegal contribu
tions in 1980.

From the wires ot The Associated Press snd The Los Angeles Times — Washington Poet news services'
Shultz urges end of pipeline sanctions
Washington — Secretary of State George Shultz is pressing for an agree
ment this weekend or early next week on Western trade relations with the
Soviet Union that would open the door to lifting of the Reagan adminis
tration's controversial pipeline sanctions, according to Western European
diplomats and administration sources.
Shultz reportedly is working with the ambassadors from four European
countries on final details of a communique. Administration sources say
there is general agreement from three of the four — Britain, Italy and West
Germany — but that France continues to object to aspects of the proposed
agreement. This has led to warnings from several officials and diplomats that
any announcement of success could still be some time away.
President Reagan has spoken optimistically to campaign audiences twice
in the past week about his hopes for an agreement with the Europeans that
would replace the sanctions policy, which has been a disruptive issue in the
Atlantic alliance and has brought sharp protests from affected industries
here.
But after Reagan's remarks administration spokesmen also have stressed
that there has been no shift in policy.
The pipeline sanctions were imposed by the administration in retaliation
for martial law last winter in Poland. Reagan is seeking to prevent sale to the
Soviet Union of U.S.-made or U.S.-licensed equipment for use in the natural
gas pipeline the Soviets are building from Siberia to Western Europe.
The administration says the pipeline will earn the Sovi
ets needed cash and leave Europe too dependent on the
Soviets for energy. It has imposed penalties on European
companies that have continued to sell pipeline equip
ment. Europeans have reacted angrily, defending the
pipeline and saying Reagan has no business applying
U.S. law to European firms.
Administration officials said vesterday that Reagan's
campaign statements reflected a basic optimism that
Shulu will be able to reach an agreement rather than any
certain knowledge that an agreement is in hand.
The proposed agreement would contain commitments
in principle on curtailing credits for the Soviet Union,
limiting export of strategically important high-technolo
gy items, capping energy imports from the Soviets and
continuing an embargo on selected items for the pipeline,
according to the sources.
Detailed discussions on these issues would be accom
panied by broader-gauged talks to be joined by Canada
and Japan on a general Western strategv for trade rela
tions between the West and the Soviet bloc.
The fact that the United States now has begun to take
the initiative in trying to find the common ground for a
consensus represents a change in tactics, if not in the goal.
European steel imports curtailed
Washington — The United States and Europe agreed
yesterday to limit shipments of European steel to this
country, ending a bitter dispute and easing tensions in a
strained trading relationship between the allies.
The agreement, reached only hours before a deadline
for the imposition of penalty duties on imported steel,
was accepted bv U.S. steelmakers who had blamed the
imports for contributing to their worst financial crunch
since the Depression.
President Reagan announced the settlement while on a
campaign swing in Omaha, Neb., and hailed it as "good
news" for the steel industry and for the economy.
It will mean, he said, "more and lasting jobs in the steel
industry, which will translate into good news on the em
ployment front."
Had the restrictions been in place in 1981, Commerce
Secretary Malcolm Baldrige said, there would have been
25,000 to 30,000 more jobs for the U.S. industry.
"While we think this will be a shot in the arm for em
ployment in the steel industrv, this is not the answer to all
of their problems," Baldrige cautioned at a White House
news conference.
Etienne Davignon, the European Community industry
commissioner, described the agreement as being "in the
best interest of all steel producers."
He said European companies, also suffering serious fi
nancial woes, will be assured of "an export market and a
market that pays."
In Pittsburgh, U.S. Steel Chairman David Roderick
said the pact covered a wider range of steel products than
did an earlier tentative settlement worked out in August.
The enforcement provisions, he said, were tougher in the
new arrangement.
The pact clears up what has been a "very bitter dis
pute" between the allies, Baldrige said. He added that its
resolution was "a great aid toward eventual solution" of
two other trans-Atlantic trading disputes, one on a com
mon agricultural policy and the other the U.S. sanctions
on sales of oil and gas equipment to the Soviet Union.

Under the settlement, the European Community will
limit its shipments of 11 steel products to this country
starting around Nov. 1 and continuing through 1985.
Arabs forsake Israeli U.N. ouster
I'nited Nations — The 21 -member Arab bloc agreed
yesterday to abandon its drive to oust the Israeli delega
tion from the General Assembly in the face of a U.S.
threat to retaliate by boycotting the session and cutting
off U.N. funds.
Despite the formal decision taken by the Arab League
members yesterday morning at a closed meeting, how
ever, there was no certainty that the issue was over.
Both Arab and Western diplomats conceded that Iran
— which is not bound by the Arab decision — might still
make an anti-Israel motion when the assembly meets
Monday to consider members' credentials.
Even if Iran acts, both moderate Arab and Western
diplomats expressed confidence that it would fail to win a
majority because of the U.S. lobbying and the absence of
official Arab support.
The drive against Israeli U.N. representation stemmed
from a decision of Arab foreign ministers in Tunis on
Sept. 22 in the wake of the Beirut massacre.
Two days later, Israeli credentials were rejected by a
41-39 vote on the last day of a meeting of the Interna
tional Atomic Energy Agency, a U.N. affiliate.
Then Algeria moved to expel Israel from another U.N.
agency, the International Telecommunications Union, at
a meeting in Nairobi.
(Reuter reported yesterday that the effort was effec
tively defeated when the paragraph calling for Israel's ex
pulsion was ordered deleted by a 61-57 vote by the ITU
delegates.)
Arab diplomats said that instead of forcing a vote on
Monday they will submit a letter expressing their reserva
tions on Israel's representation, citing its defiance of
U.N. resolutions on the Middle East.
The letter — a face saving device used against Israel in
the past — will be open for other delegations to sign as
well, but will have no practical impact on Israel's privi
leges as a U.N. member.
Pope John Paul welcomes Gemayel
Vatican City — Pope John Paul II warmly embraced
President Amin Gemayel of Lebanon at a Vatican au
dience yesterday and endorsed the president's call for
withdrawing all foreign troops from war-ravaged Leba
non.
Despite tight security, Gemayel was treated to an
elaborate welcome usually reserved for official visits,
complete with a review of Swiss guards assigned to the
Vatican. The Vatican called the visit private.
Italian authorities deployed helicopters and riot police
for Gemayel's arrival a day after terrorists bombed the
Lebanese Embassy in Rome. He traveled by military heli
copter from one meeting place to another, using a bullet
proof limousine only for short distances.
Gemayel was on the last stop of a tour that took him to
the United States and France in search of political sup
port for the withdrawal of Israeli, Syrian and Palestinian
forces that made Lebanon a battleground this summer.
Specifically, the president wants a tenfold increase in
the 3800-man multinational peacekeeping force in Beirut

that includes U.S. Marines, French and Italian soldiers.
He also is asking for $12 billion in long-term economic
assistance.
