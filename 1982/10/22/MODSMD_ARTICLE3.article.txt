Shultz urges end of pipeline sanctions
Washington — Secretary of State George Shultz is pressing for an agree
ment this weekend or early next week on Western trade relations with the
Soviet Union that would open the door to lifting of the Reagan adminis
tration's controversial pipeline sanctions, according to Western European
diplomats and administration sources.
Shultz reportedly is working with the ambassadors from four European
countries on final details of a communique. Administration sources say
there is general agreement from three of the four — Britain, Italy and West
Germany — but that France continues to object to aspects of the proposed
agreement. This has led to warnings from several officials and diplomats that
any announcement of success could still be some time away.
President Reagan has spoken optimistically to campaign audiences twice
in the past week about his hopes for an agreement with the Europeans that
would replace the sanctions policy, which has been a disruptive issue in the
Atlantic alliance and has brought sharp protests from affected industries
here.
But after Reagan's remarks administration spokesmen also have stressed
that there has been no shift in policy.
The pipeline sanctions were imposed by the administration in retaliation
for martial law last winter in Poland. Reagan is seeking to prevent sale to the
Soviet Union of U.S.-made or U.S.-licensed equipment for use in the natural
gas pipeline the Soviets are building from Siberia to Western Europe.
