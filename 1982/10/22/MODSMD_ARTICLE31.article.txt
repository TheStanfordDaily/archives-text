## An emotional evening with Fleetwood Mac 
### MARK ZEIGLER 
Only a handful of rock groups
would even think of ending a
two-hour plus, energetic and
emotion-packed show with a
slow song. An even smaller
number has the ability to do so
effectively. And probably only
one group does in fact conclude a
concert with a solo piano tune,
sung by one of the bands less
popular members. That band is
Fleetwood Mac.
Keyboardist Christie McVie
gracefully played and sung
"Songbird," a tune from
Fleetwood Mac's Rumours
album, to end Fleetwood Mac's
two-hour, 15-minute per
formance at the Oakland-
Alameda County Coliseum
Arena Wednesday night. The
show was originally scheduled
for Sunday, October 3, but was
postponed due to a Stevie Nicks
illness.
Guitarist Lindsey Buck
ingham and vocalist Nicks,
Fleetwood Mac's two most pop
ular members, were on-stage too
during McVie's slow, melodic
tune. But they just sat in the dark
along with the drummer and
bassist, motionless, with no in
tention of playing or singing at
all.
McVie finished and the nearly
20,(XX) in the arena began a polite
clap, which gradually became a
soft roar. The large crowd didn't
even attempt to get the quintet
back for vet another encore. The
show was over and they knew it.
t It was time to go home.
"Songbird," besides providing
la perfect ending for an excep-
I tional show, clearly demon
gstrated what Fleetwood Mac
| does best — inject its emotion
I into an audience.
From a purely instrumental
p standpoint, Fleetwood Mac is
fe Inot a very talented band. Mick
Fleetwood is a good drummer,
Stevie Nicks a good singer and
ILindsey Buckingham a good
i«uitarist. Christie McVie is a
'good keyboardist and husband
John is a good bassist. Just good.
Not bad and not great.
f h But that's beside the point. The
group's main abiltiv lies in emo
tional song writing. If the quintet
wants to inject energy into the
!jponcert, they do so. If they want
sorrow, they create it. You name
it, thev do it.

The only thing that stood be
tween Fleetwood Mac and their
efforts to transmit their emotion
to the audience was the Oakland
Coliseum Arena. Simply put, the
sound sucked.
The numerous huge speakers
that hung from the Coliseum's
ceiling sent Nicks' vocals and
Buckingham's guitar into the up
per portions of the building —
into the marijuana-smoke-only
atmosphere — where few sat.
The sound on the floor was a dif
ferent story, however. Nicks'
voice echoed while Buck
ingham's guitar riffs often got
lost with the smoke upstairs.
Fleetwood Mac played almost
all of Rumours, an album that has
been called a once-in-a-decade
venture. A few songs from Tusk,
including the title track and
"Sarah," and about half of their
newest LP, Mirage, also echoed
in the ears of the older-than
you'd-expect crowd, with an av
erage age of 25 or 30. However,
as evidenced their playing so
much of Rumours, the group's re
cent music seems to be suffering
from the disease of "trying too
hard," not realizing that
Rumours happens once in a life
time.
Another question mark was
Stevie Nicks. Recovering from
whatever ailment that sidelined
her, forcing the postponement of
concerts, the group's lead female
vocalist hardly seemed up to par,
with her voice seeming much
lower than it does on albums.
Furthermore, Nicks disappeared
into a tent/dressing room
backstage after each song, re
turning to her microphone in the
center of the stage just before she
was required to sing again. And
at the conclusion of "Songbird"
the blonde was wrapped in a
blanket and delicately escorted
off stage like a china doll.
Bassist John McVie did an
adequate job, though one gets the
feeling that he is still a part of the
band solely because his wife,
Christie, is such a vital element of
Fleetwood Mac's success.
Blonde-haired Christie wore a
pink mini-dress, exposing her
svelte figure, and seemed to be
the most relaxed of the five on
stage. Drummer Fleetwood sat
behind his drums all evening and
sweated.
Buckingham put on an extra

special performance Wednesday
night since he called playing in
Oakland somewhat of a home
coming and since his family was
in the audience. The guitarist
grew up in Palo Alto, spending a
cumulative 22 years of his life
here. Though not as talented
from a soloing standpoint as
many may think, the energy and
emotion with which he plays
makes up for his limited individ
ual repertoire.
In injecting so much emotion
into the crowd, Fleetwood Mac
displayed another one of their
qualities — they are unpreten
tious. The group used neither
fancy stage schemes nor out of
the ordinary light tricks (though
the lights were exceptional and
very effective). Sure, Buck
ingham jumped around the stage
once and a while, but that's just
his style. The other four band
members just played their instru
ment and sang their songs.
But they didn't do so listlessly
— for them every show is their
last.

in the audience. The guitarist
grew up in Palo Alto, spending a
cumulative 22 years of his life
here. Though not as talented
from a soloing standpoint as
many may think, the energy and
emotion with which he plays
makes up for his limited individ
ual repertoire.
In injecting so much emotion
into the crowd, Fleetwood Mac
displayed another one of their
qualities — they are unpreten
tious. The group used neither
fancy stage schemes nor out of
the ordinary light tricks (though
the lights were exceptional and
very effective). Sure, Buck
ingham jumped around the stage
once and a while, but that's just
his style. The other four band
members just played their instru
ment and sang their songs.
But they didn't do so listlessly
— for them every show is their
last.

Only a handful of rock groups
would even think of ending a
two-hour plus, energetic and
emotion-packed show with a
slow song. An even smaller
number has the ability to do so
effectively. And probably only
one group does in fact conclude a
concert with a solo piano tune,
sung by one of the bands less
popular members. That band is
Fleetwood Mac.
Keyboardist Christie McVie
gracefully played and sung
"Songbird," a tune from
Fleetwood Mac's Rumours
album, to end Fleetwood Mac's
two-hour, 15-minute per
formance at the Oakland-
Alameda County Coliseum
Arena Wednesday night. The
show was originally scheduled
for Sunday, October 3, but was
postponed due to a Stevie Nicks
illness.
Guitarist Lindsey Buck
ingham and vocalist Nicks,
Fleetwood Mac's two most pop
ular members, were on-stage too
during McVie's slow, melodic
tune. But they just sat in the dark
along with the drummer and
bassist, motionless, with no in
tention of playing or singing at
all.
McVie finished and the nearly
20,(XX) in the arena began a polite
clap, which gradually became a
soft roar. The large crowd didn't
even attempt to get the quintet
back for vet another encore. The
show was over and they knew it.
t It was time to go home.
"Songbird," besides providing
la perfect ending for an excep-
I tional show, clearly demon
gstrated what Fleetwood Mac
| does best — inject its emotion
I into an audience.
From a purely instrumental
p standpoint, Fleetwood Mac is
fe Inot a very talented band. Mick
Fleetwood is a good drummer,
Stevie Nicks a good singer and
ILindsey Buckingham a good
i«uitarist. Christie McVie is a
'good keyboardist and husband
John is a good bassist. Just good.
Not bad and not great.
f h But that's beside the point. The
group's main abiltiv lies in emo
tional song writing. If the quintet
wants to inject energy into the
!jponcert, they do so. If they want
sorrow, they create it. You name
it, thev do it.

The only thing that stood be
tween Fleetwood Mac and their
efforts to transmit their emotion
to the audience was the Oakland
Coliseum Arena. Simply put, the
sound sucked.
The numerous huge speakers
that hung from the Coliseum's
ceiling sent Nicks' vocals and
Buckingham's guitar into the up
per portions of the building —
into the marijuana-smoke-only
atmosphere — where few sat.
The sound on the floor was a dif
ferent story, however. Nicks'
voice echoed while Buck
ingham's guitar riffs often got
lost with the smoke upstairs.
Fleetwood Mac played almost
all of Rumours, an album that has
been called a once-in-a-decade
venture. A few songs from Tusk,
including the title track and
"Sarah," and about half of their
newest LP, Mirage, also echoed
in the ears of the older-than
you'd-expect crowd, with an av
erage age of 25 or 30. However,
as evidenced their playing so
much of Rumours, the group's re
cent music seems to be suffering
from the disease of "trying too
hard," not realizing that
Rumours happens once in a life
time.
Another question mark was
Stevie Nicks. Recovering from
whatever ailment that sidelined
her, forcing the postponement of
concerts, the group's lead female
vocalist hardly seemed up to par,
with her voice seeming much
lower than it does on albums.
Furthermore, Nicks disappeared
into a tent/dressing room
backstage after each song, re
turning to her microphone in the
center of the stage just before she
was required to sing again. And
at the conclusion of "Songbird"
the blonde was wrapped in a
blanket and delicately escorted
off stage like a china doll.
Bassist John McVie did an
adequate job, though one gets the
feeling that he is still a part of the
band solely because his wife,
Christie, is such a vital element of
Fleetwood Mac's success.
Blonde-haired Christie wore a
pink mini-dress, exposing her
svelte figure, and seemed to be
the most relaxed of the five on
stage. Drummer Fleetwood sat
behind his drums all evening and
sweated.
Buckingham put on an extra

special performance Wednesday
night since he called playing in
Oakland somewhat of a home
coming and since his family was
in the audience. The guitarist
grew up in Palo Alto, spending a
cumulative 22 years of his life
here. Though not as talented
