# Zeppelin-less Plant still gets the Led out

### JEFF SANTOSUOSSO 
Robert Plant
Pictures at Eleven
Swan Song
The most facile revelation that
I can make about Robert Plant's
new album. Pictures at Eleven, is
that it sounds a lot like Plant's
old work with Led Zeppelin. All
the Zep standbys are present: the
heavy drumming, the slashing
and rapid-fire, ex
otic solos, the odd, untraceable
titles and, of course, Plant's inex
haustible collection of voices.
Plant, is, of course, a suc
cessful, wealthy performer these
days. This fact immediately
raises the debate between the ac
cusation of his complacency
within a tested, saturated style
and the simple possibility of a
man making music with which he
is comfortable. The debate can be
further reduced to the question,
"Just whose band was Led Zep
pelin?" Is Plant's insistence on
huge chunks of his songs being
reserved for solos in deference to
the absent Jimmy Page, or is it
just a style that Plant himself en

joyed? Well, you can decide that
for yourself. The inescapable
point is that Pictures at Eleven is
loaded with traces of Led Zep
pelin.
Plant produced and co-mixed
this album, which seems to in

perform and hear these days. To
the familiar Zep style, he adds
things like an assertive, running
sax solo by Raphael Ravenscroft
(of Gerry Raffertv's "Baker
Street" fame) on "Pledge Pin,"
and swirling synthesizer back
drops on "Slow Dancer" and
"Burning Down One Side"
which gives the album an often
deceptively subliminal texture.
But again. Plant retains many of
his old vocal tricks. "Worse Than
Detroit" delivers that funkv,
thrusting sexuality that Plant so
strongly perfected on "Rock and
Roll" and parts of "The Song
Remains the Same." "Like I've
Never Been Gone" is overly
nasal, like other parts of "The
Song Remains the Same." The
last cut, "Mystery Title," pre
serves that redundant rhythm
that is so predominant on "Misty
