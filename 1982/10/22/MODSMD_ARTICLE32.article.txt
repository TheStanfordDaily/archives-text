# Zeppelin-less Plant still gets the Led out

### JEFF SANTOSUOSSO 
Robert Plant
Pictures at Eleven
Swan Song
The most facile revelation that
I can make about Robert Plant's
new album. Pictures at Eleven, is
that it sounds a lot like Plant's
old work with Led Zeppelin. All
the Zep standbys are present: the
heavy drumming, the slashing
and rapid-fire, ex
otic solos, the odd, untraceable
titles and, of course, Plant's inex
haustible collection of voices.
Plant, is, of course, a suc
cessful, wealthy performer these
days. This fact immediately
raises the debate between the ac
cusation of his complacency
within a tested, saturated style
and the simple possibility of a
man making music with which he
is comfortable. The debate can be
further reduced to the question,
"Just whose band was Led Zep
pelin?" Is Plant's insistence on
huge chunks of his songs being
reserved for solos in deference to
the absent Jimmy Page, or is it
just a style that Plant himself en

joyed? Well, you can decide that
for yourself. The inescapable
point is that Pictures at Eleven is
loaded with traces of Led Zep
pelin.
Plant produced and co-mixed
this album, which seems to in
dicate a lot about what he likes to
perform and hear these days. To
the familiar Zep style, he adds
things like an assertive, running
sax solo by Raphael Ravenscroft
(of Gerry Raffertv's "Baker
Street" fame) on "Pledge Pin,"
and swirling synthesizer back
drops on "Slow Dancer" and
"Burning Down One Side"
which gives the album an often
deceptively subliminal texture.
But again. Plant retains many of
his old vocal tricks. "Worse Than
Detroit" delivers that funkv,
thrusting sexuality that Plant so
strongly perfected on "Rock and
Roll" and parts of "The Song
Remains the Same." "Like I've
Never Been Gone" is overly
nasal, like other parts of "The
Song Remains the Same." The
last cut, "Mystery Title," pre
serves that redundant rhythm
that is so predominant on "Misty

Mountain Hop," although it is
used between verses instead of as
the dominant rhythm.
The high point of the album
has got to be "Slow Dancer."
Suspiciously similar to the Zep
classic "Kashmir," the cut opens
wifh loud, heavy drum-bass ac

centuations wound within some
wild guitar and a huge, raspy
"Sloooow" by Plant. Cozy
Powell, late of Rainbow and oth
ers, drums as aggressively as
Plant will allow him. Guitarist
Robbie Blunt provides sawing
rhythm riffs and then breaks
open into a rambling solo that

begins with staccato punches and
rises clear into a David Gilmour
like isolation of notes. Emerging
from Blunt's licks is a haunting
keyboard sojourn that leads to
another Plant trick (which he
may have borrowed from Yard
birds', Still I'm Sad, through Jim
my Page), the Gregorian chant
(Remember Going to California?
). Finally, the coda begins with
Plant's insistence of "To the
heights, to the heights" that, like
the instrumental behind it, won't
let go. The coda is indicative of
the song itself; a movement of
personal strength jockeying for
volume and prominence, which is
immediately reminiscent ofZep's
ego problems. Nevertheless, the
cut is highly memorable and
praiseworthy.
Plant's mouth seems to be full
of ten voices, however, and he of
fers some alternatives to the
heavy R & B on songs like
"Moonlight in Sambosa."
Touched with a delicate Spanish
guitar, the song moves along at a
ballad-like pace until Plant wails
"What is, what was, it's all the
same," creating another
noteworthy moment in the his
tory of Plant's vocal control.
A sister piece to "Moonlight"
is side two's "Like I've Never
Been Gone." Although Plant's
mix leaves Powell's drumming a
little too heavy, Plant does man
age to create some pretty images.
"The springtime on vour

lips/The sunlight on your eyes"
is some of the stuff that Plant
knows how to sing convincingly.
But of course, as with any record
that features Plant, this song is a
little drippy. He laments, "It's
been so long since you've been
gone" here and drones, "I need
your love" in "Burning Down
One Side.'" Oh well, that's Plant.
And again, he shows that he is a
novice at the mixing board at the
end of this song, as the guitar solo
is overwhelmed by the rhythm
track.
The album is predominantly
harsh and booming. "Fat Lip"
opens pleasantly and melodical-
Iv, but Plant nearly shatters it
with some of his screeching.
"Mystery Title," a roundhouse,
funky selection, disintegrates
into a rhythm that threatens to
beat your brains out. "Burning
Down One Side" and "Pledge
Pin" arc raunchy and brash. The
volume occasionally lends itself
to inspiration by drummer Phil
Collins and ample chance for
Blunt to assert himself, but it also
leaves the album a little
cacophonous at times.
Finally, Pictures at Eleven
finds Robert Plant walking the
thin line between holding back
and busting out. At times, he's
complacent or polished. At other
times, he's discordant or
laudably out of control. At every
time, though, he sounds a lot like
his old self.

that features Plant, this song is a
little drippy. He laments, "It's
been so long since you've been
gone" here and drones, "I need
your love" in "Burning Down
One Side.'" Oh well, that's Plant.
And again, he shows that he is a
novice at the mixing board at the
end of this song, as the guitar solo
is overwhelmed by the rhythm
track.
The album is predominantly
harsh and booming. "Fat Lip"
opens pleasantly and melodical-
Iv, but Plant nearly shatters it
with some of his screeching.
"Mystery Title," a roundhouse,
funky selection, disintegrates
into a rhythm that threatens to
beat your brains out. "Burning
Down One Side" and "Pledge
Pin" arc raunchy and brash. The
volume occasionally lends itself
to inspiration by drummer Phil
Collins and ample chance for
Blunt to assert himself, but it also
leaves the album a little
cacophonous at times.
Finally, Pictures at Eleven
finds Robert Plant walking the
thin line between holding back
and busting out. At times, he's
complacent or polished. At other
times, he's discordant or
laudably out of control. At every
time, though, he sounds a lot like
his old self.
Robert Plant
Pictures at Eleven
Swan Song
The most facile revelation that
I can make about Robert Plant's
new album. Pictures at Eleven, is
that it sounds a lot like Plant's
old work with Led Zeppelin. All
the Zep standbys are present: the
heavy drumming, the slashing
and rapid-fire, ex
otic solos, the odd, untraceable
titles and, of course, Plant's inex
haustible collection of voices.
Plant, is, of course, a suc
cessful, wealthy performer these
days. This fact immediately
raises the debate between the ac
cusation of his complacency
within a tested, saturated style
and the simple possibility of a
man making music with which he
is comfortable. The debate can be
further reduced to the question,
"Just whose band was Led Zep
pelin?" Is Plant's insistence on
huge chunks of his songs being
reserved for solos in deference to
the absent Jimmy Page, or is it
just a style that Plant himself en

joyed? Well, you can decide that
for yourself. The inescapable
point is that Pictures at Eleven is
loaded with traces of Led Zep
pelin.
Plant produced and co-mixed
this album, which seems to in
dicate a lot about what he likes to
perform and hear these days. To
the familiar Zep style, he adds
things like an assertive, running
sax solo by Raphael Ravenscroft
(of Gerry Raffertv's "Baker
Street" fame) on "Pledge Pin,"
and swirling synthesizer back
drops on "Slow Dancer" and
"Burning Down One Side"
which gives the album an often
deceptively subliminal texture.
But again. Plant retains many of
his old vocal tricks. "Worse Than
Detroit" delivers that funkv,
thrusting sexuality that Plant so
strongly perfected on "Rock and
Roll" and parts of "The Song
Remains the Same." "Like I've
Never Been Gone" is overly
nasal, like other parts of "The
Song Remains the Same." The
last cut, "Mystery Title," pre
serves that redundant rhythm
that is so predominant on "Misty

Mountain Hop," although it is
used between verses instead of as
the dominant rhythm.
The high point of the album
has got to be "Slow Dancer."
Suspiciously similar to the Zep
classic "Kashmir," the cut opens
wifh loud, heavy drum-bass ac

centuations wound within some
wild guitar and a huge, raspy
"Sloooow" by Plant. Cozy
Powell, late of Rainbow and oth
ers, drums as aggressively as
Plant will allow him. Guitarist
Robbie Blunt provides sawing
rhythm riffs and then breaks
open into a rambling solo that

begins with staccato punches and
rises clear into a David Gilmour
like isolation of notes. Emerging
from Blunt's licks is a haunting
keyboard sojourn that leads to
another Plant trick (which he
may have borrowed from Yard
birds', Still I'm Sad, through Jim
my Page), the Gregorian chant
(Remember Going to California?
). Finally, the coda begins with
Plant's insistence of "To the
heights, to the heights" that, like
the instrumental behind it, won't
let go. The coda is indicative of
the song itself; a movement of
personal strength jockeying for
volume and prominence, which is
immediately reminiscent ofZep's
ego problems. Nevertheless, the
cut is highly memorable and
praiseworthy.
Plant's mouth seems to be full
of ten voices, however, and he of
fers some alternatives to the
heavy R & B on songs like
"Moonlight in Sambosa."
Touched with a delicate Spanish
guitar, the song moves along at a
ballad-like pace until Plant wails
"What is, what was, it's all the
same," creating another
noteworthy moment in the his
tory of Plant's vocal control.
A sister piece to "Moonlight"
is side two's "Like I've Never
Been Gone." Although Plant's
mix leaves Powell's drumming a
little too heavy, Plant does man
age to create some pretty images.
"The springtime on vour

lips/The sunlight on your eyes"
is some of the stuff that Plant
knows how to sing convincingly.
