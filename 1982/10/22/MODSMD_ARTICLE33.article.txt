The first remark that has to be
made when considering the new
Roxv Music album A valon is;
where are the women? A trivial
question? I think not. Every
Roxy album until A valon has had
women on its cover. From the
high camp of their first album, to
the shocking parody of Country
Life, (initially banned in the
United States as pornographic)
to the fairly tame Amazons on
Roxy's last album Flesh and
Blood, each album has featured
women on the cover.
Furthermore, Bryan Ferry,
Roxy's lead singer and guiding
force, was originally a painter
and has designed every Roxy
cover. What he puts on the out

side should always be considered
before looking inside.
OK, then, what is on the cover
of Avalon? Taking our cue from
the title (Avalon, according to
Celtic mythology, is an island
across the Western Seas where
heroes go after death), we see a
knight with a falcon on his arm,
looking across a sea toward
Avalon. The picture is a soothing
one, blues and yellows gently
mingling in the clouds. While the
reference to mythology is not
new (Flesh and Blood had Ama
zons and the album Jerry Hall
posed for was titled Siren), this is
a far cry from any previous cover.
"Who cares?" you say,
"What's this got to do with the
music?" you exclaim. Well, as it

turns out, plenty. Don't get me
wrong — Ferry is an incurable
romantic (witness the videotapes
made for "Avalon"), and I doubt
he'll ever write a song that isn't
concerned with love, unrequited
or otherwise, but "Avalon" has
music that while still distinctly
Roxv, is muchdifferent from their
past efforts.
Avalon has an ethereal quality
to it. Starting with "More Than
This" and winding up with the in
strumental "Tara," the instru
ments, as is the cover, are muted,
oblique. Manzanera's guitar and
Mackay's saxophone and oboe
are softer, often being treated,
and Ferry's voice seem to float in
and out of the songs. Just as the
cover doesn't show us its face, the
songs don't confront you head
on; instead, they envelop you in a
slow-moving wave and then gen
tly set you down. It is as if Eno,
long departed from the Roxy
scene, has been giving ambient
lessons to Ferry. One might well
wonder if in fact a new force has
come into the group, but a quick
glance at the credits shows that
this is not the case. Roxy has
maintained its standard operat
ing procedure — Ferry directs,
Manzanera and Mackay are his
right hand men, and everyone
else is imported. Bass, drums and
miscellaneous instruments are
handled by various people. And
in fact, Flesh and Blood had songs
that suggested that Roxy was
moving this direction, "No
Strange Delight" and "Oh
Yeah" exhibiting the same
ethereal qualities as A valon.
Well, I've said quite a bit about
Avalon, but I haven't yet an
swered the question that every re
viewer is expected to answer, "Is
this a good album?" So now I
will. The answer is yes. But I miss
the women.
