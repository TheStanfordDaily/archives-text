Reviews by Steve Vlneberg

Duck Soup (1933) ★
Kresge
The fifth and best of the Marx
Brothers comedies, set in
mythical Freedonia, where
Groucho is President (Rufus T.
Firefly), Chico is Minister of
War, and Harpo is Presidential
Chauffeur. Unfortunately Zeppo
turns up too, but he doesn't have
to do much, and anyway it was
the last time moviegoers would
see him. (In 1935 the Marxes
switched from Paramount to M-
G-M — for A Might at the Opera
— and retired Zeppo.) One rea
son for the triumph of this joyous
farce is Leo McCarey, one of the
most gifted comedy directors of
the period. Bert Kalmar and
Harry Ruby wrote the script and
the songs. With Margaret Du
mont, Louis Calhern, Raquel
Torres and Edgar Kennedy.
Plays Monday evening.
Mr. Smith Goes to Washing
ton (1939)
Kresge
Frank Capra's homespun
whimsy contained an insistent
populist message that could be
discomfiting — even creepy —
but in this preposterous political
fantasy about the forces of good
defeating the forces of evil in the
Senate, it isn't bothersome
enough to spoil the entertain
ment. Jimmy Stewart gives a
hugely appealing performance as
the small-town hero, Jean Arthur
plays the cynic softened by him,
and the large, impressive cast fea
tures Claude Rains, Thomas
Mitchell, Edward Arnold, Guy
Kibbee, Eugene Pallette, Beulah
Siarry Carey. H.B.
id Porter Hall. Sidney
vrote the screenplay.
Correspondent (1940)
'alo Alto +
This wartime espionage thriller
was one of Alfred Hitchcock's
early American pictures, and it is
one of his most sheerlv enjoyable.
The film is so chock full of sus
pense sequences — it is almost a
catalogue of ideas for spy movies
— that it is endearingly silly. This
is the movie that contains the
Tower of London scene and the
windmill scene, both of which are
well known to Hitchcock fans.
Joel McCrea, an amiable per
former whose talents have been
underrated, plays the American
hero, and the supporting cast in
cludes Laraine Day, Herbert
Marshall and Edmund Gwenn.
Plays through Wednesday with
To Be or Not to Be.

To Be or Not to Be (1942)
Festival, Palo Alto
Many movie critics and his
torians have an inexplicable affec
tion for this clumsy comedv, in
which Jack Benny plays a Polish
Shakespearean actor called upon
to impersonate a Nazi and Carole
Lombard plays his wife. With its
broad, blunt anti-Nazi jokes, the
movie seems in execrable taste to
day. Edwin Justus Mayer wrote
the screenplay, Ernst Lubitsch
directed — though without his fa
mous delicate touch — and the
supporting cast includes the
gentle, charming character actor
Felix Bressart (who gets to play
Shylock), Robert Stack, Stanley
Ridges, Sig Rumann and Lionel
A twill. This wasn't one of Carole
Lombard's best performances,
but it was her last; she was killed
in a plane crash later that year.
Plays through Wednesday with
Foreign Correspondent.
The Conformist (1971) ★
New Varsity, Palo Alto
Leaves fly ferociously into the
camera as if possessed; tiny, rat
like dogs overrun an invalid's
bed; a bureaucrat sits Magritte
like at an immense marble desk
placed squarelv in the center of an
immense office. Bernardo
Bertolucci's. film of the Alberto
Moravia novel, set in Italy in the
late '30s, is so imagisticallv rich
that you grow delirious while you
watch. Intellectually, the treat
ment of fascism as unresolved
homosexual tension may not be
satisfying, but visually .and emo
tionally this is a great movie,
made bv a true poet-director. The
cast is extraordinary, too; Jean-
Louis Trintignant as the fascist,
Stefania Sandrelli as his silly,
charming wife, and Dominique
Sanda as the other woman.
Plays Tuesday and Wednesday
with Mephisto.
Jules and Jim (1961) *
New Varsity, Palo Alto
Oskar Werner and Henri Serre
arc best of friends and both love
Jeanne Moreau (Catherine), who
is passionate, elusive, maddening.
Because they feel more alive when
they are with her, they agree to
share her so that they won't lose
her. This was Francois Truffaut's
third feature, following on the
heels of The 400 Blows and Shoot
the Piano Player. Little wonder
that the movie world stood up
and took notice of him. Jules and
Jim, with its incomparable per
formance by Moreau and its won
derful Georges Delerue music, is
one of the few great movies of the
'60s.
Plays Thursday with Black Or
pheus.

The Last Wave (1978)
Fox, Redwood City
Despite the eerily beautiful im
ages created by the talented
young Australian director Peter
Weir and his photographer, Rus
sell Bovd — most of them con
cerned with water — this is just an
occult realitv-or-illusion picture,
and one has to have a lot of pa
tience for the plot, which has
something to do with black magic
and dreams forecasting a watery
apocalypse. The nominal lead is
Richard Chamberlain, who looks
like a terribly earnest little boy
who is worried over aii v exam; his
line readings are soft spoken but
heavily weighted. The aborigines
in the film arc amazing to watch,
however, especially Gulpilil; his
black leather jacket and dirty
jeans contrast dramatically with
his regal-bestial face, an incon
gruity that suggests a greater trag
edy of loss than the script ever
deals with.
Plays Thursday with Picnic at
Hanging Rock
Mephisto
New Varsity; Palo Alto
Klaus Mann's 1936 novel
about the disintegration of in
tellectual life under Hitler isn't
terribly well written, but the
fascinating subject matter keeps
you reading. Istvan Szabo's film
version never allows you to be
swept away; despite some startl
ing moments, it is disjointed and a
little stolid — it lacks rhvtTim and

shape. And the editing is often
dismaying; gripping moments
dissipate when small, slow scenes
follow them. As the actor-direc
tor Hcndrik Hofgen, a thinly dis
guised representation of Gustav
Grundgens (who managed the
State Theater under the Third
Reich), Klaus Maria Brandauer
gives a fascinating performance;
his acting is a strange mixture of
commitment and self-conscious
ness. (He's a little like Mick Jag
fter.)
Plays Tuesday and Wednesday
with The Conformist.
Young Frankenstein (1975) ★
New Varsity, Palo Alto
With his faraway blue eyrt and.
his hair rumpled on his head like $
forgotten haystack, Gene Wildei
is a slightly off-bakftce fairy title
hero: Prince crossed
with the WizaßKf Oz. In Mel
Brooks' of James
Whale's FranHp>W*n pictures
tfttkh were Universal in
TWHrly '30s), Hkder has one of
screen t£R>, and he's sur

rounded by hilarious performers
like Madeline Kahn, Peter Bovle,
Cloris Leachman, Kenneth Mars,
Teri Garr and (in an uncredited
cameo as the blind man) Gene
Hackman. The music by John
Morris is Hollywood Gothic, and
(ierald Hirschfield has shot the
film in black and white.

North by Northwest (1959) ★
Fox, Redwood City
One of Alfred Hitchcock's last
first-rate thrillers — a gloriously
entertaining, wittily sustained
variation on his old theme of the
innocent trapped in intrigue.
Cary Grant, Eva Marie Saint,
Jessie Rovce Landis, Martin
Landau and Mount Rushmore
are among the featured players.
Ernest Lehman wrote the script,
which contains one of the most fa
mous lines in any suspense film;
"That's funny — that duster's
dustin' crops where there ain't no
crops." The title, by the way, is
both a reference to Hamlet ("I am
but mad north-northwest . ..
and a clue to the geography of th<
movie.
Plays today and tomorrow
with Dial'M'for Murder.

E.T. ★
Old Mill, Mountain View
Steven Spielberg's film begins
where Close Encounters of the
Third Kind peaked — with the de
scent of an alien craft — and gets
better and better from there. Like
The Black Stallion, to which
screenwriter Melissa Mathison
also contributed, E.T. offers emo
tional compensation in the form
of a special, blessed friendship to
a young protagonist who has lost
a father. Elliott (Henry Thomas),
whose father has run off with his
mistress, establishes a bond with a
sweetly benevolent extrater
restrial. The domestic scenes are
extraordinary, and flawlessly
acted by Thomas, Robert
Naughton as his brother,
Barrymore as his kid sisteflftd

Paris Belongs to Us (I960)
Geology Corner, Room 320 ir
Jacques Rivette's film begins
with a how to Rene Clair, one of
the first French directors to bring
moviemaking out of the studios
and into the fresh air. This early
New Wave picture really
breathes: Rivette's imaginative
use of Paris locations gives it vital
ity. The script (by Rivette and
Jean (iruault), about a world
wide conspiracy only detected by
artist-intellectuals, is both
fatuous and self-congratulatory,
and bv the end of the picture all of
the ideas have cancelled each oth
er out. It's not a good movie, but
it's well worth seeing (and it's
almost never revived). The mix
ture of paranoia and idealism,
and the in-group enthusiasm, are
authentic relics of a bygone era of
French film culture. (The closest
American equivalents are the beat
poetry of the '50s and experimen
tal movies like John Cassavetes'
Shadows! Jean Gruault and
Su/anne Schiffman (listed in the
credits as "script coach") later

Silver Streak (1976)
K resge

Colin Higgins' failed attempt
to get back to the screwball come
dies of the '3()s. The idea of setting
much of the movie on a trans
continental express — hardlv a
plausible locale for the '70s — is
out of the grand old Hecht-
Mac Arthur Twentieth Century.
Jill Clavburgh, in an earlv role,
looks lovely and has little to do;
Richard Prvor and Gene Wilder
have some bright moments to
gether, though, notably one in
which Prvor tries to teach Wilder
how to walk like a black man.
Plays tomorrow evening.
