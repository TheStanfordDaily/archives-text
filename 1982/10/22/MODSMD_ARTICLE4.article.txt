### DAVID AZRIN Senior staff writer 
Student groups have lost more than
$27,000 to students claiming their fee
assessment refunds during the past two
weeks. As a result, 12 student groups re
ceiving fee assessments this quarter will
suffer an average estimated loss of more
than 23 percent of their full assessment.
The Stanford Progressive Alliance
(SPA) and the Academic Organization
Board (AOB) suffered the greatest
losses so far, according to statistics re
leased by the ASSU. The ASSU will
continue giving refunds until 4 p.m. to
day.
This quarter's refund total is above
average, according to Mark Epstein,
council of presidents member, who
added that the average refund total is
approximately 20 percent. He at
tributed the large amount of money re
funded this year to students' increased
awareness of the refunds.
Last year's record refund total of 42.2
percent and the publicity that sur
rounded it helped increase students'
awareness of the refunds this year, Eps
tein said.
Student organizations which rely on
fee assessment funding anticipated
losses of 23 to 30 percent this year due
to last year's record refund total, he
said. The 12 groups receiving fee

assessments, including the Daily, quali
fied through last spring's elections.
Beginnning next fall, only students
who vote during the spring quarter elec
tion to decide which groups will receive
fee assesments will be eligible to receive
refunds. This new stipulation was ap
proved by students in a general election
last year. Under the new plan, transfer
students, first-year graduate students
and freshmen will be exempt from the
stipulation.
ASSU officials hope this stipulation
will substantially reduce the amount of
money that is refunded.
"There are a lot of student organiza
tions who have come to me expressing
concern," Epstein said. "All 1 can say is
next year they (students) will have to go
to the polls and cast their vote."
"We expect that the pool of those
people eligible to collect refunds will be
cut in half and that's assuming a 17 per
cent increase in voter turnout," he
added.
ASSU Senator Jim McGrath also ex
pressed hope that the new plan will de
crease the number of students collecting
refunds.
"There's no way we can get rid of the
economic incentive. We can only try to
reduce it. It's not unreasonable from
their viewpoint, but it throws the whole
svstem out of kilter," McGrath said.
