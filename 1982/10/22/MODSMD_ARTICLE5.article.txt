# SLAC, Physics Dept. still competing despite resolution of mutual conflicts

Last in a series.
While perusing the University's
Courses and Degrees, one may be sur
prised to find that the Stanford Linear
Center a facility for
physics research — is listed separately
from the Physics Department.
Now that SLAC is more than 20
years old, bureaucratic conflicts be
tween the center and the Physics De
partment appear to be dying down.
Though both are part of the Univer
sity, SLAC and the Department of
Physics are separate units. Each has its
own faculty and administration.
"They are two institutions, two dif
ferent groups ... it is only natural that
conflict would arise," said Stanley Wo
jcicki, chairman of the Physics Depart
ment.
Problems arose in the late '50s and
early '60s when SLAC was coming into
existence, according to Wojcicki.
Though he has been at Stanford since
1966 and became the department chair
man only two months ago, Wojcicki
said he has reviewed extensive cor
respondence concerning the situation.
When SLAC was being planned,
there was some difficulty deciding how
the faculty there would be chosen and
who would run the center's adminis
tration, according to Wojcicki. He said
that apparently some people in the
Physics Department were upset with
the decision that SLAC would be an in
dependent unit because they felt that a
facility for phvsies research should be
tied to the department.
While Wojcicki said that some ad
ministrative difficulties still exist, he
and others feel that the major problems
have passed.
"I personally don't perceive that
there is any tension," Wojcicki said.
Bruce Sawhill, a physics graduate
student doing research at SLAC, said,

"Actually those problems are just his
tory." He said they were most severe in
the mid-'6os "when the center of power
moved."
When asked about problems between
SLAC and the Physics Department,
Sidney Drell, deputy director of SLAC,
said, "Needless to say, when you have
any units at a university with overlap
ping interests — I won't say anymore."
He added, however, "I will say we're
doing fine. There aren't any serious
problems."
Drell has expressed interest in de
veloping "some sort of umbrella struc
ture" to oversee both SLAC and the
Physics Department, accordingto Wo
jcicki.

Wojcicki said he is supposed to have
a lunch meeting with Drell and
Wolfgang Panofskv, director of SLAC,
to find a common ground for solving
existing administrative problems.
"Whether a better solution can be
found or not, I just don't know,"he
said.
Wojcicki added that "any inflam
matory words would just set us back."
Though conflict between the two
groups appears to have dissipated.

potential problems still exist.
Professors in the Physics Department
are not given any priority at SLAC. If
they want to do research at the center,
they "make proposals to work out here
and they are judged like everybody else
is," according to Drell.
Currently, two of the Physics Depart
ment's 25 faculty members — Wojcicki
and Prof. David Ritson — are engaged
in experimental research at SLAC.
However, only Ritson receives his fund
ing through SLAC's grant from the De
partment of Energy, according to Wo
jcicki. He added that his research is sup
ported bv a grant from the National
Science Foundation.
Pay for faculty and staff at SLAC is
"in distinction to the rest of the Univer
sity," said William Kirk, assistant di
rector of research at SLAC. In the vari
ous University departments, salaries
are paid by the University and individ
ual grants must be secured for research,
whereas at SLAC, funding for research
and salaries is covered by the Depart
ment of Energy's annual payments of
more than $100 million.
Current research in the Physics De
partment is being funded by "upwards
of 20 or 30 grants," according to Wo
jcicki.
It is necessary to point out, Wojcicki
said, that while SLAC conducts particle
physics research through the use of high
energy, his department is involved in re
search in five or six subfields of phvsics.
One problem the department faces, he
said, is that many people have come to
believe that high-energy physics is the
most important subfield.
Of the approximately 100 graduate
students in his department, Wojcicki
said 25 or 30 interested in particle phys
ics work at SLAC.
He added that "we generally have
one or two people from SLAC teaching
a course."

and salaries is covered by the Depart
ment of Energy's annual payments of
more than $100 million.
Current research in the Physics De
partment is being funded by "upwards
of 20 or 30 grants," according to Wo
jcicki.
It is necessary to point out, Wojcicki
said, that while SLAC conducts particle
physics research through the use of high
energy, his department is involved in re
search in five or six subfields of phvsics.
One problem the department faces, he
said, is that many people have come to
believe that high-energy physics is the
most important subfield.
Of the approximately 100 graduate
students in his department, Wojcicki
said 25 or 30 interested in particle phys
ics work at SLAC.
He added that "we generally have
one or two people from SLAC teaching
a course."

Last in a series.
While perusing the University's
Courses and Degrees, one may be sur
prised to find that the Stanford Linear
Center a facility for
physics research — is listed separately
from the Physics Department.
Now that SLAC is more than 20
years old, bureaucratic conflicts be
tween the center and the Physics De
partment appear to be dying down.
Though both are part of the Univer
sity, SLAC and the Department of
Physics are separate units. Each has its
own faculty and administration.
"They are two institutions, two dif
ferent groups ... it is only natural that
conflict would arise," said Stanley Wo
jcicki, chairman of the Physics Depart
ment.
Problems arose in the late '50s and
early '60s when SLAC was coming into
existence, according to Wojcicki.
Though he has been at Stanford since
1966 and became the department chair
man only two months ago, Wojcicki
said he has reviewed extensive cor
respondence concerning the situation.
When SLAC was being planned,
there was some difficulty deciding how
the faculty there would be chosen and
who would run the center's adminis
tration, according to Wojcicki. He said
that apparently some people in the
Physics Department were upset with
the decision that SLAC would be an in
dependent unit because they felt that a
facility for phvsies research should be
tied to the department.
While Wojcicki said that some ad
ministrative difficulties still exist, he
and others feel that the major problems
have passed.
"I personally don't perceive that
there is any tension," Wojcicki said.
Bruce Sawhill, a physics graduate
student doing research at SLAC, said,

"Actually those problems are just his
tory." He said they were most severe in
the mid-'6os "when the center of power
moved."
When asked about problems between
SLAC and the Physics Department,
Sidney Drell, deputy director of SLAC,
said, "Needless to say, when you have
any units at a university with overlap
ping interests — I won't say anymore."
He added, however, "I will say we're
doing fine. There aren't any serious
problems."
Drell has expressed interest in de
veloping "some sort of umbrella struc
ture" to oversee both SLAC and the
Physics Department, accordingto Wo
jcicki.

Wojcicki said he is supposed to have
a lunch meeting with Drell and
Wolfgang Panofskv, director of SLAC,
to find a common ground for solving
existing administrative problems.
"Whether a better solution can be
found or not, I just don't know,"he
said.
Wojcicki added that "any inflam
matory words would just set us back."
Though conflict between the two
groups appears to have dissipated.

potential problems still exist.
Professors in the Physics Department
are not given any priority at SLAC. If
they want to do research at the center,
they "make proposals to work out here
and they are judged like everybody else
is," according to Drell.
Currently, two of the Physics Depart
ment's 25 faculty members — Wojcicki
and Prof. David Ritson — are engaged
in experimental research at SLAC.
However, only Ritson receives his fund
ing through SLAC's grant from the De
partment of Energy, according to Wo
jcicki. He added that his research is sup
ported bv a grant from the National
Science Foundation.
Pay for faculty and staff at SLAC is
"in distinction to the rest of the Univer
sity," said William Kirk, assistant di
rector of research at SLAC. In the vari
ous University departments, salaries
are paid by the University and individ
ual grants must be secured for research,
whereas at SLAC, funding for research
and salaries is covered by the Depart
ment of Energy's annual payments of
more than $100 million.
