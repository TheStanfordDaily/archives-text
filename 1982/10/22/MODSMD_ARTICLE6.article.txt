# Med school considers curriculum changes
## 
### JULIE KAUFMANN Senior staff writer 
The hard work won't get easier and
the long hours won't get much shorter,
but Stanford's medical school and a na
tional study panel agree: it may be time
to make some changes in the way doc
tors are trained.
The medical faculty here will vote
next month on a proposal to revamp the
school's all-elective curriculum and
bring back required courses.
And a panel set up bv the nation's
medical schools said this week that
medical training overwhelms students
with scientific detail while neglecting
the fundamentals of treating patients.
Although medical students here must
complete a minimum number of cred
its, the school dropped specific course
requirements in 1968. Now, students
choose courses freely from a schedule,
or "grid," which changes each quarter,
said George Demitri. student member
of the Committee on Courses and Cur
riculum (CCC).
The specifics are not settled yet, De

mitri said, but the proposal the CCC
will place before the Med School's fac
ulty senate requires that students take
certain courses in their first two years,
and complete certain clinical clerkships
in their third and fourth years.
"It seems like a positive change," he
told the Daily, "there are some basic re
quirements to appease the more reac
tionary members of the faculty senate
and there's still an element of electivitv
built into it."
I he new curriculum mav also lighten
the lecture load â€” which now runs
about 35 hours a week for first and sec
ond vear students, "Part of what the
CC C is trying to do is give people time
to do research ~. we're trying not to
just fill people's minds with facts," De
mitri said.
Ironically, Demitri joined the com
mittee to work against reinstating re
quirements. "But in the course of the
last vear I've really become kind of ex
cited about the plan," he said.
1 h e Association of American Medi
cal Colleges panel will not release its

final recommendations for curriculum
overhaul until 1984, but the 18-member
group announced preliminary con
clusions in Washington this week.
Medical schools place too much pres
sure on students, said panel chairman
Steven Muller, the president of Johns
Hopkins University. Students get an
"extraordinary dosage" of science but
do not learn enough about taking a pa
tient's history, using instruments such
as a stethoscope and treating minor
problems and injuries, he said.
These early findings are not surpris
ing, according to Stanford Medical
School Dean Dominick Purpura. "The
feeling has surfaced over several years
that perhaps we've lost a little contact
with basic science and its relationship to
(treating patients)," Purpura said.
Hut Purpura warned against a panic
response to the panel's suggestions. "I
don't think the doom and gloom view
stands up. It seems to be part of the gen
eral 'Let's get back to basics' move
ment, but I don't want to see any retro
gressive action."

And there may be hidden benefits in
the heavy science load medical students
take. "It is a threatening experience to
think of the mass of information (to be
learned)," the dean said. "Most stu
dents feel intimidated, overwhelmed
and quite disturbed; but frankly there
may be no substitute for a period of feel
ing that way and learning to understand
and be comfortable with uncertainty."
Stanford's part in the national study
will come January 22, when the Med
School will host a symposium of faculty
and students.
(iraduating students Demitri and
Francine Hamberg agree that some
classtinie could be better spent. The
first two years of med school "can be
kind of a mindless time of absorbing
facts," Demitri said.
Hamberg said she often spent eight
hours a day in class. "Although it's very
important to have a strong grounding
in current chemistry, biological science
and physics, you don't need quite as
much detail about everything."
