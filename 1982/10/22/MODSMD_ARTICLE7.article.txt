## Haus Mitt food far cry from Food Service 
### BETH KLEID 
Sharon Meader, the cook of the German
theme house Haus Mitteleuropa, has a per
sonality as flavorful as the dishes she pre
pares.
Meader is a true gourmet chef who pro
vides the residents of Haus Mitt with de
lightful taste treats. Delicacies like shrimp
scampi, Beef Wellington and chocolate
strawberries injected with Grand Marnier
* make the dining room at Haus Mitt a very
popular place, and Meader a popular cook.
"Sharon Meader is an excellent cook, and
she is such a neat person," sophomore
Isabelle Richardson said. "I think she is a bet
ter cook than my mother — but don't tell my
mother that!"
"Sharon makes really wholesome foods.
We always have fresh vegetables," senior
Heidi Rath, Haus Mott program coordi
nator, remarked. "I've lived in the house for
two years now, and I have gotten to know
Sharon and what a nice lady she is. Sharon is
our Ann Landers; we go to her for advice."
Meader grew up outside of Boston and
started cooking for her family when she was
10 years old. Later, Meader worked as an ap
prentice for a French catering service where
she studied under a man who trained at the
famous Maximes in Paris.
She has been cooking professionally for the
past eight years, and has worked at various
restaurants on the East Coast. Meader now
runs a catering service named Cousine
Cuisine which is equipped to serve from two
to 100 people.

Spunky Meader with her curly hair and
bright smile is queen of her kitchen. "I con
sider myself to be an artist, and food is my
medium," she said. "Because of this I never
get bored with my job. The people in the
house don't get bored with my cooking either.
"The students rarely eat the same thing
twice, unless a certain thing is requested,"
Meader continued.
"Sharon wants to fix what we want to eat.
She is open for suggestions and always asks us
what we would like," commented junior Ann
Doersch. "The meals are so diversified — we
might even have squid this year."
There are so many different foods served as
Haus Mitt it is hard for residents to choose a
favorite dish. Meader's desserts get rave re
views from the students.
This year's Haus Mitt is full of chocolate
lovers, and Meader is "reprimanded" if she
does not leave batter in the bowl to be licked.
Meader enjoys making her famous des
serts. "Chocolate mousse torte and cream
puffs are among my favorite things to make. I
also bake breads and we have fresh bread at
least three to four times a week."
It is not uncommon for a week's dinner
menu to include dishes from various na
tionalities. "She might fix Wienerschnitzel
one night, poached salmon with white sauce
the next and tempura the next," Doersch
noted. "A skilled chef is also able to im
provise, and Sharon is an expert at throwing a
pinch of this and a dash of that into any recipe
and turning out your favorite dish a la
Sharon."

Meader is a master at inventing recipes.
She said, "More times than not my inventions
are liked better than recipes from a book."
She is presently working on a cookbook, and
is thankful for the feedback she gets from stu
dents on her recipes.
Meader's interests go beyond the kitchen.
She is a licensed masseuse, and gives annual
clinics for house residents on basic Eselan
massage techniques. Astrology is another one
of her hobbies and she delights Haus Mitt stu
dents with information about their
astrological signs. "The daily astrology re
port on the radio is my soap-opera," she said.
The range of fabulous foods made by
Meader makes it seem as if a great deal of
money is spent on feeding those who live in
Haus Mitt, but Meader has the food budget
under control. In fact, one quarter the house
received a rebate because of the money al
lotted for food was not spent. Meader com
mented, "I pride myself on creating pure,
wholesome foods with only the freshest ingre
dients — and the best ingredients I can buy
within my budget."
The people at Haus Mitt have many good
times in the kitchen, but things don't always
run smoothly. Meader recalls an incident
when she was cooking and something went
wrong with the pipes on the kitchen ceiling.
She remembered, "I was showered with water
while I was standing at the stove!"
Meader's skill as a cook and her interesting
character do not go unnoticed by the resi
dents. The students are grateful that she is not
a typical meat and potatoes cook. Rath re
marked, "The food is not at all greasy."

run smoothly. Meader recalls an incident
when she was cooking and something went
wrong with the pipes on the kitchen ceiling.
She remembered, "I was showered with water
while I was standing at the stove!"
Meader's skill as a cook and her interesting
character do not go unnoticed by the resi
dents. The students are grateful that she is not
a typical meat and potatoes cook. Rath re
marked, "The food is not at all greasy."
Sharon Meader, the cook of the German
theme house Haus Mitteleuropa, has a per
sonality as flavorful as the dishes she pre
pares.
Meader is a true gourmet chef who pro
vides the residents of Haus Mitt with de
lightful taste treats. Delicacies like shrimp
scampi, Beef Wellington and chocolate
strawberries injected with Grand Marnier
* make the dining room at Haus Mitt a very
popular place, and Meader a popular cook.
"Sharon Meader is an excellent cook, and
she is such a neat person," sophomore
Isabelle Richardson said. "I think she is a bet
ter cook than my mother — but don't tell my
mother that!"
"Sharon makes really wholesome foods.
We always have fresh vegetables," senior
Heidi Rath, Haus Mott program coordi
nator, remarked. "I've lived in the house for
two years now, and I have gotten to know
Sharon and what a nice lady she is. Sharon is
our Ann Landers; we go to her for advice."
Meader grew up outside of Boston and
started cooking for her family when she was
10 years old. Later, Meader worked as an ap
prentice for a French catering service where
she studied under a man who trained at the
famous Maximes in Paris.
She has been cooking professionally for the
past eight years, and has worked at various
restaurants on the East Coast. Meader now
runs a catering service named Cousine
Cuisine which is equipped to serve from two
to 100 people.

Spunky Meader with her curly hair and
bright smile is queen of her kitchen. "I con
sider myself to be an artist, and food is my
medium," she said. "Because of this I never
get bored with my job. The people in the
house don't get bored with my cooking either.
"The students rarely eat the same thing
twice, unless a certain thing is requested,"
Meader continued.
"Sharon wants to fix what we want to eat.
She is open for suggestions and always asks us
what we would like," commented junior Ann
Doersch. "The meals are so diversified — we
might even have squid this year."
There are so many different foods served as
Haus Mitt it is hard for residents to choose a
favorite dish. Meader's desserts get rave re
views from the students.
This year's Haus Mitt is full of chocolate
lovers, and Meader is "reprimanded" if she
does not leave batter in the bowl to be licked.
Meader enjoys making her famous des
serts. "Chocolate mousse torte and cream
puffs are among my favorite things to make. I
also bake breads and we have fresh bread at
least three to four times a week."
It is not uncommon for a week's dinner
menu to include dishes from various na
tionalities. "She might fix Wienerschnitzel
one night, poached salmon with white sauce
the next and tempura the next," Doersch
noted. "A skilled chef is also able to im
provise, and Sharon is an expert at throwing a
pinch of this and a dash of that into any recipe
and turning out your favorite dish a la
Sharon."

Meader is a master at inventing recipes.
She said, "More times than not my inventions
are liked better than recipes from a book."
She is presently working on a cookbook, and
is thankful for the feedback she gets from stu
dents on her recipes.
Meader's interests go beyond the kitchen.
She is a licensed masseuse, and gives annual
clinics for house residents on basic Eselan
massage techniques. Astrology is another one
of her hobbies and she delights Haus Mitt stu
dents with information about their
astrological signs. "The daily astrology re
port on the radio is my soap-opera," she said.
The range of fabulous foods made by
Meader makes it seem as if a great deal of
money is spent on feeding those who live in
Haus Mitt, but Meader has the food budget
under control. In fact, one quarter the house
received a rebate because of the money al
lotted for food was not spent. Meader com
mented, "I pride myself on creating pure,
wholesome foods with only the freshest ingre
dients — and the best ingredients I can buy
within my budget."
The people at Haus Mitt have many good
times in the kitchen, but things don't always
run smoothly. Meader recalls an incident
