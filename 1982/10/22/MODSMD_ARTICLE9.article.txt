# Hillel, other groups provide a supportive background for an individual's beliefs

"The college years tend to set a person's
character. It is a time of ideological and so
cial change," said Karen Smith, associate di
rector of the Hillel Foundation at Stanford.
She added that Hillel tries to help students
with those struggles. "Our purpose is to in
terpret Judaism on campus."
The B'nai B'rith Hillel Foundation is a na
tional organization, but it operates inde
pendently on different campuses. Rabbi Ari
Cartun, executive director of the Hillel
Foundation at Stanford, believes that stu
dents should be in charge of the organization
as much as possible. "The only programs
that are staff-planned are the religious ac
tivities, since the staff is aware of them long
in advance. Students create and plan other
events according to interest."
"Students' ideas are facilitated as long as
students want to see them happen," Smith
said.
Discussions, lectures, a social club, Israel
action and social action programs, festivals,
large events and rallies are some of the types
of activites Hillel sponsors. Religious service
options include a traditional Minyon service
(if interest is shown) and a Liberal Shabbat
service, both on Friday evenings.

The rabbi recognizes the diversity of his
group, so the tradition at the Liberal service
is to "follow your own tradition," and each
person can include parts of the service not
being done by the leader, at his own pace.
The rabbi also conducts a Torah study on
Saturday mornings.
Hillel also helps Jewish students who have
difficulties with the University on matters of
religious practice. It will verify a student's re
ligious observance if a class, test or trip is
going to interfere with Jewish religious holi
day.
However, students who wish to keep strict
kosher on campus will find it extremely dif
ficult, though a lesser level of kosher can be
obtained. At present there is no kosher din
ing plan, and the nearest shops for kosher
meat are in San Jose or San Francisco. "But
if we received enough interest in a kosher
dining plan, we would present it to the Uni
versity," Smith said.
"We do cooperate with the other min
istries on campus," Smith said. The observa
tion of a day in remembrance of the Holo
caust is sponsored with many ministries, and
Hillel also works in conjunction with the
Stanford Lutheran Center on Passover
sedar.

seling of the students. The students are the
priority in the office. "We like this to be a
place where all Jews can come and feel com
fortable," Smith emphasized.
The Southern Baptist Student Union is
another group that stresses leadership. Ac
cording to Mike Gastineau, a member of the
Union, it is a small group Bible study, with
eight or nine students, that wants to broaden
its focus while continuing to get its program
for students' needs. The ministry works
closely with local Baptist churches — for as
Gastineau noted, "We are no substitute for
the local churches. We are an additional sup
port service."
The union doesn't have much interaction
with other Stanford ministries, but does
work with Southern Baptist Student Unions
on other campuses, primarily San Jose State
University. Gastineau added that the Union
is not ecumenical in outlook, because, "we
believe it is important to hold onto our own
traditions and support each other in that."
Members of the Bahai Club, on the other
hand, believe that all religion stems from one
source, one God. The different traditions are
"all rays from the same sun," maintained
Faramarz Yazsani, a member of the club.
The purpose of the Bahai club is to acquaint
others with the Bahai faith, he added.

Yazdani explained that the major prin
ciples of the faith are the unity of mankind,
equality of rights, elimination of prejudices,
universal peace and a spiritual solution for
the world's economic problems. Activities of
the club include public meetings and in
tellectual events related to the faith.
The Latter-Day Saints (LDS) Institute
also sponsors intellectual events relating to
faith. "Our intent is to provide spiritual ser
vice and social opportunities," explained
Dan Cazier, institute director of LDS.
It sponsors daytime study groups, Sunday
services and cultural, social and recreational
activities. The Friday Forum series is pro
vided to enhance religious and intellectual
studies. Classes that are offered are designed
to be college level courses in scripture.
The group is homogeneous, as most col
lege programs are — because of the age and
common lifestyle of the members. Cazier
notes that the LDS Institute is designed to
fulfill the unique needs of the student. "We
provide counseling as the needs and desires
are present," he added.
Helping the whole person is a feature
common to most ministries, and the LDS In
stitute is no exception. "Wc beVieve in tV\c •

in advance. Students create and plan other
events according to interest."
"Students' ideas are facilitated as long as
students want to see them happen," Smith
said.
Discussions, lectures, a social club, Israel
action and social action programs, festivals,
large events and rallies are some of the types
of activites Hillel sponsors. Religious service
options include a traditional Minyon service
(if interest is shown) and a Liberal Shabbat
service, both on Friday evenings.

The rabbi recognizes the diversity of his
group, so the tradition at the Liberal service
is to "follow your own tradition," and each
person can include parts of the service not
being done by the leader, at his own pace.
The rabbi also conducts a Torah study on
Saturday mornings.
Hillel also helps Jewish students who have
difficulties with the University on matters of
religious practice. It will verify a student's re
ligious observance if a class, test or trip is
going to interfere with Jewish religious holi
day.
However, students who wish to keep strict
kosher on campus will find it extremely dif
ficult, though a lesser level of kosher can be
obtained. At present there is no kosher din
ing plan, and the nearest shops for kosher
meat are in San Jose or San Francisco. "But
if we received enough interest in a kosher
dining plan, we would present it to the Uni
versity," Smith said.
"We do cooperate with the other min
istries on campus," Smith said. The observa

priority in the office. "We like this to be a
place where all Jews can come and feel com
fortable," Smith emphasized.
The Southern Baptist Student Union is
another group that stresses leadership. Ac
cording to Mike Gastineau, a member of the
Union, it is a small group Bible study, with
eight or nine students, that wants to broaden
its focus while continuing to get its program
for students' needs. The ministry works
closely with local Baptist churches — for as
Gastineau noted, "We are no substitute for
the local churches. We are an additional sup
port service."
The union doesn't have much interaction
with other Stanford ministries, but does
work with Southern Baptist Student Unions
on other campuses, primarily San Jose State
University. Gastineau added that the Union
is not ecumenical in outlook, because, "we
believe it is important to hold onto our own
traditions and support each other in that."
Members of the Bahai Club, on the other
hand, believe that all religion stems from one
source, one God. The different traditions are
"all rays from the same sun," maintained
Faramarz Yazsani, a member of the club.
The purpose of the Bahai club is to acquaint
others with the Bahai faith, he added.

Yazdani explained that the major prin
ciples of the faith are the unity of mankind,
equality of rights, elimination of prejudices,
universal peace and a spiritual solution for
the world's economic problems. Activities of
the club include public meetings and in
tellectual events related to the faith.
The Latter-Day Saints (LDS) Institute
also sponsors intellectual events relating to
faith. "Our intent is to provide spiritual ser
vice and social opportunities," explained
Dan Cazier, institute director of LDS.
It sponsors daytime study groups, Sunday
services and cultural, social and recreational
activities. The Friday Forum series is pro
vided to enhance religious and intellectual
studies. Classes that are offered are designed
to be college level courses in scripture.
The group is homogeneous, as most col
lege programs are — because of the age and
common lifestyle of the members. Cazier
notes that the LDS Institute is designed to
fulfill the unique needs of the student. "We
provide counseling as the needs and desires
are present," he added.
Helping the whole person is a feature
common to most ministries, and the LDS In
stitute is no exception. "Wc beVieve in tV\c •
need to balance academic life with spiritual
life and social life," Cazier emphasized.
"The college years tend to set a person's
character. It is a time of ideological and so
cial change," said Karen Smith, associate di
rector of the Hillel Foundation at Stanford.
She added that Hillel tries to help students
with those struggles. "Our purpose is to in
terpret Judaism on campus."
The B'nai B'rith Hillel Foundation is a na
tional organization, but it operates inde
pendently on different campuses. Rabbi Ari
Cartun, executive director of the Hillel
Foundation at Stanford, believes that stu
dents should be in charge of the organization
as much as possible. "The only programs
that are staff-planned are the religious ac
tivities, since the staff is aware of them long
