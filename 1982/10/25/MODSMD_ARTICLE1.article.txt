# Victim was '100 mile-per-hour person'
## 
### SID ATKINS Staff writer 
Angela Arvidson rode her bike ev
erywhere on campus. She rode to her
classes in the morning from her off
campus home in Palo Alto. She rode to
the Coffee House at night where she
worked to help pay her way through
school. Last Friday, she rode in the af
ternoon to a faculty member's home
where she worked as a part-time house
keeper. There, she was stabbed to
death.
"I just can't understand why some
body would do a thing like that", said
her mother, Marleen Torrey. "It's just a
stupid, stupid thing".
Arvidson came to Stanford from
Woodrow Wilson High School in
Portland, Oregon where she was the
only 4.0 student in her class. Dean of

Students James Lyons said that
Arvidson had "an absolutely outstand
ing record of achievement" at Wilson.
Besides compiling impressive academic
records, Arvidson played violin, viola
and piano in the school orchestra.
"Angie was an extremely hard work
er; I want people to know that," her
stepfather, Mr. Michael Torrey said.
"She wasn't a "rah-rah" type of girl.
She came to Stanford to achieve a high
degree of education."
At Stanford, she was a junior major
ing in the humanities special program,
and participated in the Structured Lib
eral Education program as a freshman.
Prof. Laurence Ryan, chairman of the
humanities special program, described
her as "a very bright and lively stu

dent." Said Ryan: "I just saw her a few
weeks ago in the Coffee House. I'm very
shocked and sorry to hear about what
happened."
During an hour-long conversation
with a Daily reporter yesterday,
Arvidson's parents tried to describe
their daughter's personality.
"Angela was a doer," her mother
said, "She was a 100 mile-per-hour per
son. When she said she was going to do
things, she just did them. I had very lit
tle to do with it." Her father told of her
learning to swim at age two, of her early
love for music and of her interest in
French.
Her brother, Randall, said that even
though he arid his sister tended to travel
in different circles at Stanford, they
were very close. "She was very outgoing
and articulate — a beautiful person."
Arvidson had been living in College
Terrace since September with two
housemates; her room was in the ga
rage, according to her mother. One of
her housemates, Carol Buhrmaster,
who is a physical science technician for
the U.S. Geological Survey, said that
Arvidson was starting to get involved
with feminist activities. She offered no
possible motive for the slaying, saying,
"It seems so senseless. I can't under
stand what happened here. It had to
have been some weird creep."
According to Buhrmaster, this quar
ter Arvidson occupied her time when
she wasn't working or studying by prac
ticing Tai-Chi, a form of martial-art,
playing tennis and visiting with friends.
"We got along really well," Buhrmaster
said. "It's not pleasant around here
without her. I haven't even stayed at thp
house or slept very much the last few
nights."
Arvidson's parents have requested
that no memorial service be held at
Stanford. Her stepfather said that the
"sensationalism" involved with a cam
pus service would not befit Angie. The
family also wishes that no flowers be
sent.
However, a memorial scholarship
fund — the Angela Dee Arvidson Me
morial Scholarship Fund — will be set
up in Arvidson's name, according to
James Lyons, dean of student affairs. A
separate fund will provide scholarships
for a Portland school district.

Angela Arvidson rode her bike ev
erywhere on campus. She rode to her
classes in the morning from her off
campus home in Palo Alto. She rode to
the Coffee House at night where she
worked to help pay her way through
school. Last Friday, she rode in the af
ternoon to a faculty member's home
where she worked as a part-time house
keeper. There, she was stabbed to
death.
"I just can't understand why some
body would do a thing like that", said
her mother, Marleen Torrey. "It's just a
stupid, stupid thing".
Arvidson came to Stanford from
Woodrow Wilson High School in
Portland, Oregon where she was the
only 4.0 student in her class. Dean of

Students James Lyons said that
Arvidson had "an absolutely outstand
ing record of achievement" at Wilson.
Besides compiling impressive academic
records, Arvidson played violin, viola
and piano in the school orchestra.
"Angie was an extremely hard work
er; I want people to know that," her
stepfather, Mr. Michael Torrey said.
"She wasn't a "rah-rah" type of girl.
She came to Stanford to achieve a high
degree of education."
At Stanford, she was a junior major
ing in the humanities special program,
and participated in the Structured Lib
eral Education program as a freshman.
Prof. Laurence Ryan, chairman of the
humanities special program, described
her as "a very bright and lively stu

dent." Said Ryan: "I just saw her a few
weeks ago in the Coffee House. I'm very
shocked and sorry to hear about what
happened."
During an hour-long conversation
with a Daily reporter yesterday,
Arvidson's parents tried to describe
their daughter's personality.
"Angela was a doer," her mother
said, "She was a 100 mile-per-hour per
son. When she said she was going to do
things, she just did them. I had very lit
tle to do with it." Her father told of her
learning to swim at age two, of her early
love for music and of her interest in
French.
Her brother, Randall, said that even
though he arid his sister tended to travel
in different circles at Stanford, they
were very close. "She was very outgoing
and articulate — a beautiful person."
Arvidson had been living in College
Terrace since September with two
housemates; her room was in the ga
rage, according to her mother. One of
her housemates, Carol Buhrmaster,
who is a physical science technician for
the U.S. Geological Survey, said that
Arvidson was starting to get involved
with feminist activities. She offered no
possible motive for the slaying, saying,
"It seems so senseless. I can't under
stand what happened here. It had to
have been some weird creep."
According to Buhrmaster, this quar
ter Arvidson occupied her time when
she wasn't working or studying by prac
ticing Tai-Chi, a form of martial-art,
playing tennis and visiting with friends.
"We got along really well," Buhrmaster
said. "It's not pleasant around here
without her. I haven't even stayed at thp
house or slept very much the last few
nights."
Arvidson's parents have requested
that no memorial service be held at
Stanford. Her stepfather said that the
"sensationalism" involved with a cam
pus service would not befit Angie. The
family also wishes that no flowers be
sent.
However, a memorial scholarship
fund — the Angela Dee Arvidson Me
morial Scholarship Fund — will be set
up in Arvidson's name, according to
James Lyons, dean of student affairs. A
separate fund will provide scholarships
for a Portland school district.
