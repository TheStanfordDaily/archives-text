## 
### DAVID AZRIN Senior staff writer 
San Francisco — Gov. Brown, the
Democratic candidate for California's
U.S. Senate seat, lambasted President
Reagan's economic policies and
launched a personal attack against his
Republican opponent, San Diego
Mayor Pete Wilson, here yesterday.
"Pete Wilson is a wind-up doll for
this economic policy of privelege and
massive suffering for ordinary Califor
nians," he said during a press con
ference for Northern California student
newspapers.
Brown criticized Wilson as a tax
avoider, citing Wilson's failure to pay
taxes in 1981 because of his investments
in alternative energy tax shelters.
"I believe it reflects on his style and
his philosophy — which is to protect the
priveleged and to work for special in
terests," Brown said.
Although Brown condemned Rea
gan's funding cuts for education, Social
Security, highways, NASA and basic re
search, he said that any future increases
in funding cannot occur until the econ
omy strengthenes.
"When people are hurting you can't
expect them to consent to a tax increase
so that a precondition for rebuilding the
revenue base is a reinvigorated econo
my," he said.
"And until Reaganomics is modified
you're going to find a very hard time
finding more money," Brown added.
Brown advocated postponing the 10
percent tax cut scheduled for next July
if the economy is recovering, but said
that the cuts may be necessary "if the
economy is in a free-fall and really sink
ing."
Brown criticized Wilson's support
for the tax cuts, charging that "Wilson
has chosen tax breaks over college
scholarships."
"Over the long term, Reagan has ov
ercommitted the nation on tax cuts,"
Brown said. "If these are not modified,
we will pay a much higher price in the
form of high interest rates and con

tinued economic suffering."
Brown said he advocates possible ex
cise tax increases in addition to de
creases in defense spending in order to
balance the federal budget.
"1 would defer the third-vear tax cut,
loosen up the monetary policy, close the
loopholes, look at some excise taxes on
luxuries such as on furs and jewelery,
slow down defense spending, and
cancel the MX," he said.
The race for theSenateseat remains a
close one as Brown still trails his oppo
nent bv only 5 percent, according to an
Oct. 17 Los Angeles Times Poll. Wilson
was the choice of 46 percent of those
surveyed compared with 41 percent
who favored Brown. Those still un
decided or favoring another candidate
comprised 13 percent of the poll.
Brown said he hopes the upcoming
election will be a referendum on Rea
ganomics.
Referring to his record as California
governor. Brown said that his greatest
achievement was the establishment of
the California Conservation Corps
(CCC), a $36 million-a-year program
founded by Brown to put unemployed
youths back to work on public work
projects.
Brown said that as a senator he
would work to establish "a national
CCC."
He also cited his California record of
increased environmental protection, re
duced taxes and the attraction of high
technology industries.
