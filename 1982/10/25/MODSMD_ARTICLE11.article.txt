## The 						Stanford Daily Yes on redistricting reform 
### 
Imagine congressional, state senate and state as
sembly districts that sail across bays, wind from val
ley to valley, cross and recross county lines and
meander around the state. Your imagination would
not have to be too lively, because under the current
politicized, gerrymandered reapportionment plan,
"California now lives and votes with that regrettable
situation.
There is something you can do to prevent other
unfair reapportionment plans. On Nov. 2, vote for
Proposition 14, a plan put together by the unlikely
coalition of Common Cause and the Republican
Party which would shift the redistricting responsi
bilities from the state Legislature to a "blue-rib
bon," ostensibly depoliticized commission.
The rub, when there is one with such panels, is
who does the deciding. In this case, senior judges of
the California court of appeals would select four of
the 10 members; each of two major parties
would select three members, and any other party
garnering at least 10 percent representation in the
Legislature could choose a member. A lower level
of politicization also comes with the manner of the
plan's approval: any plan must be approved by a
two-thirds vote of the members, including three of
the four court-appointed members and at least one
member from each of the major parties.
Proposition 14 also establishes guidelines for re
apportionment plans designed to correct the most
flagrant abuses of the current scheme. District
numbering has deprived thousands of Peninsula
residents of the right to vote for state senators in the
current election; with Proposition 14, there would
be no such lapses in opportunities to vote. The
proposition also sets guidelines designed to make
each district as compact — geographically and in
concentration of population — as possible, as well

as ensuring ethnic and racial representation.
Will it work? Sixteen states have similar com
missions, and most of their plans have gone into ef
fect smoothly. Will it be expensive? The state legis
lative analyst concludes that the only additional
cost over the old system would be the once-in-a
decade salaries for commission members. These are
small risks and small costs for a proposition prom
ising to make your representation more equitable.
The campaign over Proposition 14 illustrates the
partisan debate that should not be allowed to de
termine who is allowed to vote for whom. The Re
publicans have hauled former President Gerald
Ford out of semi-retirement to endorse the proposi
tion, and the Democratic state leadership is holding
a tight line against any threat to their power of dic
ing the state at their pleasure — although some of
the more responsible Democratic assembly repre
sentatives and senators show signs of breaking
ranks with the bigwigs.
We would prefer some sort of uniform, na
tionwide system of redrawing districts after each
census, but for California, now, Propositon 14 is
the best course. We have seen the results of
backroom gerrymandering over the decades, and
this proposition holds the hope of returning repre
sentation to its original intention: fair, direct repre
sentation designed to make politicians responsive
to their constituents rather than designed to hold
citizens at the mercy of controlling party leaders'
ambitions.
Although this proposition may not be as flashy as
handgun limits or as chic as the freeze answer, it is
one of those reforms of process that are often more
far-reaching than legislation of ends. Propositon 14
is one measure that matters — and one that de
mands your support.
