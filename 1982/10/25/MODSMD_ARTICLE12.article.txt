# Yes on nuclear freeze
## 
### 
As "Fate of the Earth Week" once again in
troduces the issues surrounding the nuclear arms
race into campus discussion, and as students
wrangle over whether or not tc vote for the nuclear
freeze intiative (Proposition 12) Nov. 2, the
statement "Yes, but..." must occur to many who
wholeheartedly agree that something must be done
about the nuclear arms race.
Proposition 12, the nuclear freeze initiative,
would require the governor of California to send a
letter advocating freeze to the president, the secre
tary of defense, the secretary of state and ail mem
bers of Congress by December 31, 1982. The letter
would urge the United States to propose to the So
viet Union that both countries immediately halt the
testing, production and deployment of nuclear
weapons in a way that can be checked and verified
by both governments.
• Yes, but. . . will the president and the other of
ficials heed California's request if the iniative is
passed?
• Yes, but.. . will the Soviets accept, or even con
sider, the proposal?
• Yes, but... even if the Soviets do accept the pro
posal, don't enough warheads to destroy millions
of people already exist? What would a nuclear
freeze accomplish?
• Yes, but . .. is there "a way that can be checked
and verified by both governments?"
Yes, these doubts will still cloud the issue if the
initiative passes. But the nuclear freeze is still worth
voting for.
The proposition is valuable because it is symbol
ic. Even the proponents of the measure admit that

the letters will have no immediate effect on the arms
race. But an affirmation by Californians —
more than 10 percent of the American population
— cannot help but have an impact on national and
international opinion.
The entire grass-roots, nuclear-freeze movement
can be seen as citizens" desperate attempt to make a
difference in a world where the powci of the indi
vidual is becoming less and less significant. Propo
sition 12 evokes an image of California voters
standing up and saying, "Enough is enough!" If
only for the catharsis afforded by feeling that a vote
for Proposition 12 is a cry of "No!" to the power of
the arms industry and the defense community, the
freeze is worth supporting.
A vote for the nuclear freeze does not solve the
problem. For one thing, negotiators have thus far
failed to determine exactly what a nuclear freeze de
fines. Would a freeze halt defense research as well
as weapons construction? Would obsolete weapons
be defused?
The California initiative takes only the first step.
Casting a vote for Proposition 12 should not be the
first and last action a citizen takes to help defuse a
problem that threatens the entire world. Popular ef
forts, negotiation, mediation, compromise — all
must be brought into play before the escalation of
arms development and construction begins to de
cline.
The nuclear freeze initiative offers no intricate
solution to the diplomatic, philosophical and eco
nomic conditions that threaten nuclear war. Yes,
Proposition 12 is symbolic, but it is important sym
bolism. It is symbolism worth supporting.
