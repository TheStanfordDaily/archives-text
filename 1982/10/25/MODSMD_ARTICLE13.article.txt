## University exploited strike for economic gain 
### 
In response to the settlement of the
labor dispute between the United Stan
ford Workers and the University,
Movimiento Estudiontil Chicano de
Aztlan (MEChA) ends its boycott of
Tresidder Union which hired scab labor
during the strike. However, our de
cision does not imply that we support
the final contract or the conditions un
der which it was reached.
We feel the University exploited the
strike to its own economic and political
advantage. The University's month
long refusal to negotiate was an attempt
to break the union, to intimidate the
hospital workers from unionizing, and
to starve union members, leaving them
no alternative but to accept an inade
quate contract. As the Daily reported
(Oct. 11), "... the United Stanford
Workers gained no overall increases in
wages above the University's original
proposal and may have saved the Uni
versity at least 1.23 million in unpaid
wages." Ironically, these unpaid wages
were paid in part by students.
Just because union members ap
proved the contract by a margin of 4:1
does not mean it was an adequate and
just settlement, especially when a simi
lar version was turned down a month
earlier; rather, the contract reflects the
extreme hardship suffered by striking
workers. Sadly enough, a significant
number of those who rejected the final
proposal are in the lowest wage bracket.
For Chicanos this fact has special sig
nificance because the majority of these
workers are women, Chicanos, blacks
and other minorities.
To those of you who respected the
union's position and cooperated in the
boycott, we thank you. We hope the
Stanford community will maintain its
awareness of workers' concerns. We

feel the issue has not died despite Uni
versity President Donald Kennedy's
optimism to "re-establish old friend
ships." History has shown that agree
ments reached under coercion lead to
further, and perhaps more profound,
disputes.

Balloons harmful
The front page photo on the Oct. 18
Daily depicts a fun-loving Stanford stu
dent at the USC game about to release a
water balloon from a catapault aimed
at the USC band on the field.
Those surrounding him are mainly
smiling, probably either signifying ap
proval, or perhaps thinking "this might
not be such a good idea, but it's not my
problem."
I suggest two reasons why fellow
rooters should object, rather than wait
ing for stadium police to observe the
missiles, locate the marksman and kick
him out:
Even water balloons can be danger
ous when launched with such force. I
know a student who sustained a serious
eye injury last year when struck with a
fragment of a balloon while sitting in
the Stanford rooting section.
If we want our band members to be
subject to similar barrages and to other
harder objects 3uch as bottles, such ac
tivities might be a good idea; if not, are
they?

Insulting Kennedy
I was appalled and upset to see the
cartoon in the Oct. 15 issue of the Daily
which depicted Senator Edward Ken
nedy (D-Mass.) discussing his cam
paign strategies in a cemetery to the
gravestone of Mary Jo Kopechne who
died in the Chappaquidick accident.
Not only is this portrayal unnecessary
in its references to the Senator's politi
cal aims, but more importantly, I con
sider it an insult to the Kopechne fami
ly. Haven't both the Kopechnes and
Kennedy suffered enough that her
death not be used as a tool of political
retaliation?
I realize that this cartoon did not ori
ginate from an artist on the staff of the
Daily but was drawn by The Detroit
Free Press. However, I do feel that the
Daily could have used much better dis
cretion.

A police state?
Did you ever wonder why it takes 12
officers of the law to apprehend one
poor college shmuck with a little dope
on him?
Did you ever wonder why "security
officers" at the football games are
armed with guns? Doesn't that make
you feel more secure? Are they going to
shoot us for throwing water balloons?
What are the other 89,000 people sup.
posed to do when the bullets stan
flying?
Do you ever wonder if our country is
becoming a police state? Don't bother.

does not mean it was an adequate and
just settlement, especially when a simi
lar version was turned down a month
earlier; rather, the contract reflects the
extreme hardship suffered by striking
workers. Sadly enough, a significant
number of those who rejected the final
proposal are in the lowest wage bracket.
For Chicanos this fact has special sig
nificance because the majority of these
workers are women, Chicanos, blacks
and other minorities.
To those of you who respected the
union's position and cooperated in the
boycott, we thank you. We hope the
Stanford community will maintain its
awareness of workers' concerns. We

feel the issue has not died despite Uni
versity President Donald Kennedy's
optimism to "re-establish old friend
ships." History has shown that agree
ments reached under coercion lead to
further, and perhaps more profound,
disputes.

Balloons harmful
The front page photo on the Oct. 18
Daily depicts a fun-loving Stanford stu
dent at the USC game about to release a
water balloon from a catapault aimed
at the USC band on the field.
Those surrounding him are mainly
smiling, probably either signifying ap
proval, or perhaps thinking "this might
not be such a good idea, but it's not my
problem."
I suggest two reasons why fellow
rooters should object, rather than wait
ing for stadium police to observe the
missiles, locate the marksman and kick
him out:
Even water balloons can be danger
ous when launched with such force. I
know a student who sustained a serious
eye injury last year when struck with a
fragment of a balloon while sitting in
the Stanford rooting section.
If we want our band members to be
subject to similar barrages and to other
harder objects 3uch as bottles, such ac
tivities might be a good idea; if not, are
they?

Insulting Kennedy
I was appalled and upset to see the
cartoon in the Oct. 15 issue of the Daily
which depicted Senator Edward Ken
nedy (D-Mass.) discussing his cam
paign strategies in a cemetery to the
gravestone of Mary Jo Kopechne who
died in the Chappaquidick accident.
Not only is this portrayal unnecessary
in its references to the Senator's politi
cal aims, but more importantly, I con
sider it an insult to the Kopechne fami
ly. Haven't both the Kopechnes and
Kennedy suffered enough that her
death not be used as a tool of political
retaliation?
I realize that this cartoon did not ori
ginate from an artist on the staff of the
Daily but was drawn by The Detroit
Free Press. However, I do feel that the
Daily could have used much better dis
cretion.

A police state?
Did you ever wonder why it takes 12
officers of the law to apprehend one
poor college shmuck with a little dope
on him?
Did you ever wonder why "security
officers" at the football games are
armed with guns? Doesn't that make
you feel more secure? Are they going to
shoot us for throwing water balloons?
What are the other 89,000 people sup.
posed to do when the bullets stan
flying?
Do you ever wonder if our country is
becoming a police state? Don't bother.

In response to the settlement of the
labor dispute between the United Stan
ford Workers and the University,
Movimiento Estudiontil Chicano de
Aztlan (MEChA) ends its boycott of
Tresidder Union which hired scab labor
during the strike. However, our de
cision does not imply that we support
the final contract or the conditions un
der which it was reached.
We feel the University exploited the
strike to its own economic and political
advantage. The University's month
long refusal to negotiate was an attempt
to break the union, to intimidate the
hospital workers from unionizing, and
to starve union members, leaving them
no alternative but to accept an inade
quate contract. As the Daily reported
(Oct. 11), "... the United Stanford
Workers gained no overall increases in
wages above the University's original
proposal and may have saved the Uni
versity at least 1.23 million in unpaid
wages." Ironically, these unpaid wages
were paid in part by students.
Just because union members ap
proved the contract by a margin of 4:1
does not mean it was an adequate and
just settlement, especially when a simi
lar version was turned down a month
earlier; rather, the contract reflects the
extreme hardship suffered by striking
workers. Sadly enough, a significant
number of those who rejected the final
proposal are in the lowest wage bracket.
For Chicanos this fact has special sig
nificance because the majority of these
workers are women, Chicanos, blacks
and other minorities.
