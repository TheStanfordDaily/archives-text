## A different kind of censorship
### 
No issue, except possibly salary, is of
more enduring concern to the Stanford
faculty than intellectual freedom. Yet a
significant portion of the faculty here
and at other universities refuse to re
spect or even recognize the legitimacy
of the students' intellectual freedom.
Academic freedom for students? To
catch our drift, consider how many
times you have tried to figure out your
professor's personal political viewpoint
or bias before staking out your own
position on a term paper or exam essay.
Every "A" student knows in his or her
bones the wisdom of one-time Speaker
of the House Sam Rayburn: "It is easier
to get along if you go along."
But far more insidious than the
"mimic ruse" is what we call
Censorship by Silence. As First
Amendment buffs know, censorship,
like intellectual freedom, works both
ways. If the speaker or teacher is si
lenced, then he or she is a victim of
censorship and his or her views left un
said. But as John Stuart Mill has elo
quently argued, the audience is also vic
timized. If an intellectual paradigm or
point of view is left unsaid, the student
audience suffers through ignorance.
Worse still, when a professor tries to
make a monopoly of the marketplace of
ideas, it is precisely those students most
vulnerable to indoctrination (those in
introductory level courses) who are
least aware of what they are missing.
The threat to academic objectivity
and freedom at Stanford does not reside
solely in the University's right-wing po
litical consulting and publishing com
pany known as the Hoover Institution.
At least they wear their biases on their
fashionable, Victorian sleeves. No, the
greatest threats are even older than
trickle-down (supply-side) economics.
We mention three: what the professor
does not teach, biased textbooks and
unbalanced, ideologically-motivated
faculty hiring and tenure decisions.
Professors here know well that they
can help mold the critical ability and
outlook of America's future elite by fix
ing the breadth or narrowness of its
education. Economics 001 is the basic
introductory course to the "dismal sci
ence," our future leaders' first chance to
get dirty in a muddied field that man
ages to make astrology look logical by
comparison. John Gurley teaches a
broad perspective very popular with
students. He not only imparts the mys
tical, traditional wisdom of supply and
demand curve analysis, but also treats
the rudiments of Marxist and re
visionist economic theories fairly and in
some depth.
Unfortunately, this is not the case
with the other introductory professors,
most notably Michael Boskin, who in
the past has explained supply and de
mand curves to Republican presidents
as a member of the Council of Econom
ic Advisers. One would be hard-pressed
to find a single student coming out of
his Economics 001 class who under
stands the basic principles of non-main
stream economics which educated peo
ple in most of the rest of the world take
for granted.
Students exposed to only one narrow
perspective can end up intellectual crip
ples, unable to critique adequately or
defend intelligently the conventional
theories they learn to regurgitate on ex
ams. This stifles creativity among some
of the nation's most promising minds
precisely when new ideas are so desper
ately needed.
This telescoped, unquestioning style
of cookbook teaching runs especially
rampant in the professional schools.
Needless to say, there is little in the
Graduate School of Business cur
riculum that questions "business as
usual." Courses on corporate crime and
economic democracy are not exactly
welcome. Yet even within these con
stricted confines, we find Censorship by
Silence.
Microeconomic theory is a required
course during the first quarter of the
business school and every section uses
the same text. However, the book is so
blatantly one-sided that we felt certain
it had been published by the Hoover
Press. Chapter two's contrast between

a socialist "planned economy" and a
capitalist "free economy" reflects the
objectivity of a circus mirror.
According to this "Intermediate Mi
croeconomics" text, the planned econo
my operates by "the motto of the de
liberate order: 'You will do what I tell
you, or I will do something bad to
you.' " Contrasting this bad-guys-in-
Stockholm scenario are the smile but
tons worn on Wall Street (and, we sup
pose, in Harlem and in the unemploy
ment lines as well). Capitalists meet in
markets and say: "I will do something
nice for you, if you do something nice
for me." The author then spends pages
lambasting planned economies without
once mentioning the central, com
pensating benefits (at least in theory) of
increased equality and democracy.

Every 'A 9 student knows in his or her bones the wisdom
of one-time Speaker of the House Sam Ray burn: 'It is
easier to get along if you go along. *

Once one navigates the side-bar "ap
plications" (all of which attack govern
ment programs) and the biographies of
"famous" economists (nearly all of
whom are ultra-conservatives), the
now-pliant student reaches the "Ques
tions and Problems," where it helps to
be Christian and very suspicious of the
evils of communism to answer correct
ly. One question features a dialogue be
tween a "communist" and an "anti
communist," in which the commie ac
cuses the capitalist of selfishly putting
profit maximization ahead of human
needs. Unlike the two questions that
follow (these feature Stalin and Castro
admitting they were wrong all along
and that profit is the only way to
motivate people), the student is given a
hint. "Hints: Note that Jesus advised us
to love others as ourselves not instead of
ourselves." Jesus was a profit max
imizer. Hurrah!
When asked why this stimulating lit
tle tome had been selected — with not a
single bit of supplemental reading to fill
its obvious gaps and distortions —
Prof. John Roberts, the course coordi
nator, acknowledged that the author's
biases had seeped through here and
there, but that it was still the best in
termediate text available. Fair enough
if it's true, but then why aren't there
supplemental readings or serious dis-

cussion of alternatives in the lectures?
While there is no way to be totally
"objective," some professors like John
Manley use the inherent bias of the text
books to the educational advantage of
his students. Instead of cooperating in
their submissive indoctrination, Man*
ley creates what he calls "cognitive or
creative dissonance" in his Political Sci-I
ence 10 course by using two texts simul
taneously. One is the best mainstreanl
American political science text on th<
market. Against its unblemished pres;
entation of the pluralist view of politics
he pits a "radical approach."
Opposed to single-vision spoon-feed
ing, Manley adopts a sort of dialectical
approach to teaching — he posits tljt
traditional thesis as well as the critical

antithesis, and lets the student squirm
until he or she understands both and
can create a new synthesis drawing the
truths in each.
Of course, biased textbooks and in
tellectual complacency are not found
exclusively in economics courses. In
Property Law, a required course for all
first-year law students, Prof. Paul
Goldstein saunters in the first day and
announces, in so many words, that "al
though some of you may question the
system of private property relations and
distribution, we won't waste our timf
with that in this class." No wonder 90
percent of Stanford Law graduates
shuffle papers for big corporate law
firms.
President Kennedy and the academic
deans in the various departments
should actively seek to ensure — and
the students should vigilently demand
— that the curriculum (particularly in
introductory and required courses) cov
er all the opposing paradigms, that the
most balanced mix of course materials
be assigned, and that faculty hiring
aims to achieve a true diversity of schol
arship. Cognitive dissonance must cer
tainly provide a deeper education than
complacent indoctrination
(Jim Steyer and Mike Calabrese are
third year law and JD/MBA students,
respectively.)
