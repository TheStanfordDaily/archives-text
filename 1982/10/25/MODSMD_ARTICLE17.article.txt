## A 						Volunteers in Asia trip helps students lose 'cultural baggage' 
### CAROL CINI 
One of the few ways a Stanford student can
have an overseas experience in the non-Western
world is through Volunteers in Asia, a private,
non-profit organization affiliated with Stan
ford and the University of California at Santa
Cruz.
Each year, VIA trains 40 to 50 Stanford un
dergraduates and recent graduates to take posi
tions, mainly as volunteer English teachers, in
nations of the Far East. As VIA executive direc
tor Dwight Clark explained, "The experience is
one of being plopped into an alien culture and
being expected to perform from virtually the
first hour there ... That leads to the develop
ment of a lot of coping mechanisms and cross
cultural abilities in a very short order. We try to
really prepare people for this."
In order to prepare for a position in Indo
nesia, the Philippines, the People's Republic of
China, Taiwan or Japan, students take a cross
cultural preparation course. Part of the course
is specific to the particular country the student
is going to, and the other part is a more general
preparation, which "tries to alert people to the
kind of cultural baggage they rtiay be carrying
with them to Asia," said Clark. "Wego in there
willing to take Asia on Asia's terms, to be re

sponsive to local cultural expectations."
In addition, all students take a course
teaching English as a second language, which is
offered through the Stanford Linguistics De
partment and includes real experience in
teaching English to people who are not native
speakers. Many students have also studied the
language of the country in which they are plan
ning to live and work, although this is not a re
quirement for application to the program.
Senior Adrienne Duque spent six months in
Tainan, Taiwan, after the end of her sophomore
year. She is presently a theme associate for the
Stanford East Asian theme house and is major
ing in International Relations with an emphasis
on development in East Asia. She speaks the
Mandarin dialect of Chinese.
"There's a really good preparation course,"
she said of the VIA program. "Cultural prepa
ration is what it is." It teaches the student to
"avoid expectations that can't be met." Duque
explained that prospective VIA volunteers
learn about and study the "economic, cultural,
religious and political customs" of the country
they are planning to attend. "When you go over
there, you're as well prepared as you can be."
Duque described Taiwan as "very struc
tured." The program there is run through the

YMCAs. Most of the Taiwanese who come to
the YMCA to learn English are college age or
older, although there are some high school stu
dents "who were brave enough to hear an
American speak." Duqueexplained, "When an
American talks, this is the real thing. According
to her, it is rare for the students to hear a native
speaker of English, and many Taiwanese take
advantage of the opportunity.
"They all want to learn slang," said Duque.
"They catch up to everything you do." She says
teaching English as a second language is "like
being on stage. You have to avoid 'urn's' and
'you know's.' "
"Since I'm 5-foot-11 they always ask me,
'What do you eat?' " said Duque.
"You kind of end up being a representative
from America," she continued. "Volunteers in
Asia does a lot to prepare you for this. A lot of
things you do that you think would be perfectly
normal would be taken out of context.
Taiwanese society is a lot more conservative
than we are. If you wore a tank top, they might
think that you're 'loose.' A lot of that's chang
ing though, because Taiwan is really mod
ernizing ... the girls are starting to wear pants
more, just little things like that. There are still
some ox carts on the streets, hut they're being

pushed off by the cars."
According to Duque, Taiwanese students are
taught that "you never question the teacher. I
try and teach them the way that we learn and
they don't know how to respond — they're kind
of overwhelmed."
Duque believes that one of the most valuable
aspects of her experience was the "personal
contact." Her host family for six months was a
young couple without a child and "they kind of
took me in as their child."
After graduation from Stanford, Duque
hopes to "go back to Southeast Asia and do
some work with nutrition in Indonesia or the
Philippines. If I don't go there, I'll probably go
to Africa and do some work there with the
Peace Corps."
Carol Benedict is a "recently returned" VIA
volunteer, now working as a staff member for
the organization. She majored in Peace Studies
at the University of California at Santa Cruz.
Benedict studied some Mandarin Chinese as an
undergraduate at Stanford, "but picked most of
it up" in Taiwan and China.
She went to Taiwan for six months as a junior
in 1976 and taught English at a YMCA. Those
she taught were primarily business people,
housewives and students.

In Taiwan, she lived with a family of six who
treated her "very much like a family member.
They gave me a sense of being home." For
Benedict, living with a host family was impor
tant to her experience in Taiwan.
After her stay in Taiwan, Benedict worked
for VIA for three years. Then, from October,
1980 to September, 1982. she lived and worked
in China and was a member of the first group
VIA sent to China. There she taught English at
a technical university, primarily to students
aged 21 to 30.
"In China, teaching was extremely reward
ing," said Benedict. "It made it a joy to go into
class and the students would respond."
Benedict lived in a dormitory in the host in
stitution rather than with a Chinese family.
"The main things for me in China were the
teaching and just learning about China —
seeing a very different society and learning how
it works — trying to understand it on a day-to
day basis," she said.
Her advice to someone thinking about be
coming a volunteer in Asia is "that they prepare
to go with a very open mind and with great good
humor, but also to go assuming that the people
they'll be working and living with are fun-
damentalh much the >»ame
as we are. It's an invaluable
experience and one thai will
doubtless change iheir mind
aid their thinking and the
way they view the world.'"
Dave Pierce, a Stanford
graduate, is presently working
as a staff member for VIA. He
studied Indonesian for two
quarters at Stanford and
spent six months in Indonesia
after his junior year.
In the beginning, his major
goal was "communicating."
He went overseas "with the
intention of speaking English
all the time" in the classes he
taught, similar to the wav in
which foreign language in
structors at Stanford teach,
using only the foreign lan
guage in their classes.
"The first day, I got blank
stares," said Pierce. "I had

difficulty getting them to re
spond to me, especially mv be
ginning class," who were
"much shyer."
"So I had to find wavs,"
Pierce said. "When I became
more comfortable speaking
Indonesian in class, then the
students started speaking
English more." He also
stressed that when he gained
more confidence as a teacher,
the students responded more
to him. At age 21, Pierce was
leaching students between the
ages of 22 and 45.
"Learning language is
trying, experimenting," said
Pierce. "I wanted them to feel
free to make mistakes. Thev
were less willing to tell me
they didn't understand than
Stanford students would be."
Pierce also lived with a host
family during his stay in Indo
nesia. "I became closest with
the two parents," he said.
"They had been English
teachers before. The first dav I
got there the father said to me,

'You can practice your Indo
nesian outside the house with
our sons, but we want you to
speak English with us.' Thev
would look up words in •he
dictionary and inem out
on me and say, 'Is this right?'
Eventuallv thev let me speak
Indonesian with them. We
were doing a lot of sharing."
Now that he is back work
ing as a staff member for VIA,
Pierce's main job is "heading
up a microfiche publishing
project where we will place
over 800 volumes of ap
propriate technology books
on microfiche." VlA's Ap
propriate Technologv Project
is "an information sharing
program carried on through
out the world," according to
Clark. The microfiche will be
sold to development groups
around the world ~s a re
source for their development
projects, such as water re
sources, sanitation and cook
ing methods.
