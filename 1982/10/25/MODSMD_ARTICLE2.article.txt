San Francisco â€” An estimated
70,000 people joined in a massive labor
rally in front of City Hall here yesterday
to protest Reaganomics and rally sup

coming elections.
Workers from more than 500 unions
across the state cheered labor leaders
AFL-CIO President Lane Kirkland,
former President of the Screen Actors'
Guild Ed Asner, Longshoremen's
Union President Jim Herman and other
labor leaders as they spoke at the rally.
The rally followed a march of more

city down Market Street to the Civic
'Center.

"Our message is to vote for your
friends, for the people who have stood

added.
Organizers of the rally, the first pub

gubernatorial candidate; and Rep. Tom
Lantos, congressional candidate from

"Let's make sure that we don't ever
get another administration that doesn't
have any heart, and stop these cuts, stop
hurting people and stop building
