## 
### DAVID AZRIN Senior staff writer 
San Francisco — An estimated
70,000 people joined in a massive labor
rally in front of City Hall here yesterday
to protest Reaganomics and rally sup
port for pro-labor candidates in the up
coming elections.
Workers from more than 500 unions
across the state cheered labor leaders
AFL-CIO President Lane Kirkland,
former President of the Screen Actors'
Guild Ed Asner, Longshoremen's
Union President Jim Herman and other
labor leaders as they spoke at the rally.
The rally followed a march of more
than 50,000 demonstrators through the
city down Market Street to the Civic
'Center.

"Our message is to vote for your
friends, for the people who have stood
by you," Kirkland said.
"The current conditions in this coun
try are not satisfactory. Reagan's poli
cies have created massive unemploy
ment. They've damaged the social
structure. He (Reagan) has curtailed
and dismantled social programs that
are essential for people who are trying
hard and we've got to stop that," he
added.
Organizers of the rally, the first pub
lic labor demonstation in this city since
1950, called the event a success. Or
ganizers included the AFL-CIO, the
Teamsters Union, the Longshoremen
and other unions in California.
"People came together with spirit

and movement and guided anger," said
John Henny, secretary treasurer of the
AFL-CIO in California.
Demonstrators filled the United Na
tions Plaza in front of City Hall, waving
placards and chanting songs.
Speakers urged the audience to vote
on Nov. 2 for labor-endorsed can
didates including Democrats Gov.
Brown, candidate for U.S. Senate; Los
Angeles Mayor Tom Bradley,
gubernatorial candidate; and Rep. Tom
Lantos, congressional candidate from
the 1 Ith District.
"Let's make sure that we don't ever
get another administration that doesn't
have any heart, and stop these cuts, stop
hurting people and stop building
bombs," Ed Roberts, director of the
state deptatment of rehabilitation, told
the audience.
Speakers also called upon the au
dience to combat racism and support
the nuclear freeze proposal.
Asner, star of the recently canceled
series Lou Grant, denounced govern
ment military spending and emphasized
the need for unity within the labor
movement.
'Tm delighted to be a part of the la
bor movement of this society, to shed
some light on the scales of justice,"
Asner said.
Virna Canson, regional director of
the National Association for the Ad
vancement of Colored People
(NAACP) said, "The NAACP is in an
alNout campaign to put the record of
our leaders in front of the people."
Union leaders said Reagan's policies
have given the labor movement new im
petus and claimed the media has er
roneously portrayed the labor move

ment as faltering.
"He (Reagan) has given us the curse
of unemployment. And he's brought us
to the realization that we have to be
agressive. It's good for us because we're
not going to be docile anymore," Hen
ny said.
