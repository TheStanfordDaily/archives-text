## Stanford grounds air force to nip WSU 
### SID SPAETH 
Pullman, Wash. — Stanford
realigned its game plan and
rushed for 246 yards against a
backpedaling, pass-conscious
Washington State defense,
clinching a 31-26 win here Satur
day with a 78-yard touchdown
drive in the final three minutes.
Running back Mike Dotterer
started in place of an injured Vin
cent White and rushed for 155
yards and two touchdowns on
USC-type slashing pitch sweeps
against the injury-plagued
Cougars, who saw their seventh
linebacker lost for the season
with a wrecked knee in the first
quarter.
Dotterer clinched the game
with 22 seconds remaining on a
four-yard touchdown run behind
the block of fullback Greg
Hooper. Dotterer was hit at the
two by defensive tackle Eric Wil
liams, but bounced left and
lunged into the end zone.
Quarterback John Elway com
pleted only 10-of-26 passes for 85
yards, but engineered the win
ning ball-control drive and kept
the Cougars wary of the pass.
"It wasn't so much that they
were doing something to stop our
passing as it was we were taking
what was there," Stanford coach
Paul Wiggin said. "The last thing
I said in the locker room to (of
fensive coordinator) Jim Fassel
was, if they were going to give it
to us, we were going to take it."
No Stanford wide receiver
caught a pass and at least six
would-be completions were
dropped.
"Those dropped balls — that's
the first time it's been like that,"
Elway s'aid. "It was very un
characteristic of the receivers."
Washington State, fourth in
the Pac-10 in pass defense,
challenged Stanford to run with
linebacker drops as deep as 20
yards.
[ "They challenged us," center
j; Mike Teeuws said. "They dared
!;us to run. They were giving us so
much we decided we were going
to run-a little more. We have to be
flexible if the pass isn't going to
work."
„ Dotterer broke open pitch
sweeps of 11, II and nine yards
in the final drive. White, who
played little but scored the
Cardinal's first touchdown on an
112 11-yard pass from Elway, added
I a 12-yard burst.
The drive's key play was a 10-
yard completion to tight end
Chris Dressel on third-and-five.

"lt was a great effort by the of
fensive line and we got good
blocking from the fullbacks,"
Dotterer said.
Offensive guards Dennis Engel
and Matt Moran enjoyed leading
the pitch sweeps.
"Pulling is my favorite block,"
Engel said. "It's easier to block

someone while you are running
at them than standing there and
waiting for them to come at
you."
Dotterer said Engel and White
played important roles in his per
formance.
"Vincent White didn't play
much today, but a lot of the cred

it should go to him," Dotterer
said. "He was advising me in the
first half, telling me maybe I
should dip it inside (on the
sweeps). Dennis (Engel) told me
in the first half that I had to start
following him closer. I made a
point of that."
Fullbacks Hooper and Rob

Moore also led Dottererto much
of his yardage.
"I think every back would like
to carry the ball every play,"
Moore said. "But I like to block
for those guys too. Usually I pass
block, but today I got to go out
after people."
Washington State coach Jim
Walden said he would not make
excuses, but the injury problem
restricted the Cougars's de
fensive strategy.
"To a degree, it dictated what
we could do defensively,"
Walden said. "One of my only
two remaining healthy line
backers, Kenny Emmil, blew a
knee in the first quarter. We've
lost seven of our eight line
backers.
"We tried to take a kid (Rod
Retherford) who's a cornerback
and make him an inside line
backer. We had a kid in there
trying to do a man's job — he was
taking a pounding."
Washington State's con
ference-leading ground attack
took the lead with 3:02 remaining
after a 10-play, 82-yard drive, but
placekicker John Traut hit the
left upright on his conversion at
tempt and Stanford trailed by
only two points.
"I think that (the missed con
version) might have been a turn
ing point," Wiggin said. "They
were playing emotional football
and it might have been a momen
tum-changer for them."
"They knew they had three
minutes to drive and get close for
a field goal," Walden agreed.
"They started running the power
pitch sweep right and cut back
underneath and we weren't
strong enough to hold it off."
Dotterer said the "energy in
creased" on the Stanford sideline
after the miss, but Teeuws said,
"I didn't want three points (to
win it). We wanted a touchdown.
We were all very confident and
wanted to prove we were superior
with sound football."
The Cougars rushed for 240
yards, six yards less than Stan
ford, but passed for 191 yards.
Tim Harris bolted for 156 yards
and fullbacks James Matthews
and Rueben Mayes combined for
113 yards.
