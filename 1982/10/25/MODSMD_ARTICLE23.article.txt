## The system worked
### 
Pullman, Wash. — All that
Stanford fans ever hoped and
wished Tor its football team
nearly came crashing down
Saturday.
The John Elway system
screeched to a halt at the
hands, the very cold hands, of
his receivers, and the Cardinal
was dared to run the football.
Elwav said it was uncharac
teristic of his receivers to drop
six passes. It never happened
before, probably will never
happen again, but it happened
Saturday.

The Sporting Muse

And on came Mike Dot
terer, who was recruited for
baseball at (JSC, but was told
he would have to walk on the
football team.
"I said, 'no thanks,' " Dot
terer said Saturday, but main
tained he could have been a
USC tailback.
"Dot is a good runner,"
coach Paul Wiggin said of his
second-team running back.
"He's a seam runner. When
ever he sees an opening, he
hits it."
Dotterer's seam-hitting
amounted to 155. yards and
two touchdowns Saturday.
And those were plays that
came from the USC play
book.
Tight end blocks in, guard
pulls around tight end's block
and hits scraping linebacker,
and fullback gets force man:
the safety, explained guard
Dennis Engel and fullback
Rob Moore.
Dotterer would take the
pitch and read these blocks in
the jillionth of a second foot
ball aficionados usually credit
these types of decisions with.
The system worked.
It worked because the man
tossing back pitches was John
Elwav and Washington State
defenders knew he had to
touch the football every play
and they were backing up,
sometimes 20 yards.
"* Elway looked comfortable
in the mundane drudgery of
the USC quarterback role.
"I don't care," Elway said.
"As long as we win."

Yet, Stanford barely won,
but it was not the running
game's fault — the system
worked.
Mistakes killed Stanford
just as they killed WSU.
Penalties called back touch
downs and eliminated key
plays for both teams, while at
least six catchable balls were
dropped by Stanford re
cievers.
"They'd come back to the
huddle and say, 'sorry,'"
Elwav said. "I said, 'don't
worry about it, it's past' and
they'd come back and say
'sorry' and I'd say, 'don't say
sorry, catch the ball.' It was
very frustrating."
Blockers loved the system,
but it was as foreign as Fri
day's warm-up before prac
tice when the linemen played
wishbone. Guard Dennis
Engel takes the snap, fakes the
handoff into the line to guard
Ken Orvick, pitches to guard
Rob Macaulay who fakes a
reverse to noseguard Terry
Jackson and pitches to tackle
Ken Cunz who lofts a pass
cross-field to tight end Jim
Clymer.
All in fun, but not as much
fun as Saturday's game.
The linemen got to go after
people instead of waiting for
them to come at them. They
were in charge, not reac
tionary, and they did the job.
The system worked.
Today, Don James and the
Washington Huskies are
watching it work on the films.
James can't borrow a defense
from ASU or USC and con
trol Elwav. He has to invent
one to stop both.
But Stanford still looked
terrible and the season almost
came crashing down.
"We dropped too many
balls and we had too many
penalties," Wiggin said. "You
can't consistently win in the
Pac-10 with that many penal
ties."
Elwav did not dwell on the
mistakes.
"I was too pissed we didn't
get into the end zone," Elway
said. "It was just one of those
days when you say, 'let's get
out of here.' "
