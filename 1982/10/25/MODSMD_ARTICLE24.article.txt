### CHRIS ADDINGTON 
The Stanford water polo team
dropped a last-minute heart
breaker and a chance for the No.
1 national ranking Saturday, los
ing to top-ranked UC-Irvine 5-4
at deGuerre Pool.
The No. 2 Cardinal defeated
UCLA 8-3 on Friday in another
home game, making its overall
record 17-3 after the weekend.
Stanford had tied the score at
four against Irvine when Greg
Lambert took an assist from the
2-meter and fired a goal with 1:30
remaining in the game, after hay
ing let two man-up situations slip
away.
But Irvine came right back and
after Stanford's James Bergeson
was ejected, the Anteaters' John
Vargas scored what proved to be
the winning goal.
A last ditch scoring effort by
theCardinal failed, and Irvine sat
on the ball while the clock ran
out.
Stanford was plagued by poor
shooting against Irvine, connect
ing on only 4-of-26 shots and
scoring just twice in its seven
man-up opportunities.

"This was our worst shooting
game all year," said Stanford
coach Dante Dettamanti. "We
certainly had the opportunities
but it seemed like something
always went wrong, especially
with the man-up."
From the beginning it looked
to be a defensive struggle. The
teams both worked for half of the
first period before Stanford's Jeff
Stiling scored on an extra-man
situation. Irvine scored on a si
miliar set-up before Cardinal
John Tanner scooted one in from
the outside to give Stanford a 2-1
lead at the end of the first period.
"I was really pleased with our
defense." Dettamanti said.
"Anytime the other team is held
to five goals, we should win the
game."
Tom Lampert scored for the
Cardinal on another extra-man
in the second quarter and it ap
peared Stanford was on its way to
the No.l ranking.
Irvine responded by blanking
Stanford in the third period and
taking the lead 4-3 at the end of
the quarter.
The Cardinal started the week
end off against Pacific-10 Con

ference rival UCLA. Stanford,
displaying excellent defensive
play, built a 5-1 lead by halftime
on double goal efforts by Stiling
and Bergeson and a single tally
by Kirk Jensen.
An aggressive second half had
four ejections from each team,
but once again Stanford's steady
defense shut down the Bruins,
holding UCLA to two goals
while Bergeson scored twice and
Lampert once.
Throughout the match, UCLA
seemed unable to find openings
for their shots. The Bruins bar
raged the Stanford goal 24 times,
but the excellent pressure defense
and goalkeeper Steve Moyer's 10
saves assured the Cardinal vic
tory.
UCLA, however, seemed to
leave their shootingdilemmasbe
hind, and it was the Cardinal that
picked them up the next day
against UCI.
Stanford will get another shot
at Irvine next weekend at the
Long Beach Invitational Tour
nament where the Cardinal will
face the Anteaters in opening
round action.
