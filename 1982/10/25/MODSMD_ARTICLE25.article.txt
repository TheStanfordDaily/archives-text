# Spikers kill two of three top 10 teams
## 
### STEPHEN STRENG 
It was a "brutal weekend,"
said Don Shaw, assistant coach
of the Stanford women's vol
leyball team.
It was a weekend in which his
team played three of the top 10
schools in the country and came
away with two wins. Stanford
won an emotional match against
ninth-ranked UCLA on Friday,
lost a close one to No. 8 Arizona
State on Saturday, and came
from behind last night to edge
No. 3 Arizona. All were con
ference matches held at Maples
Pavilion.
"We survived," sighed Shaw
when it was all over. "It was nice
to get out of this weekend with
two wins."
After winning two of the first
three games against Arizona yes
terday, the Cardinal rallied from
a five-point deficit in the final
game to assure a winning week
end. Following a Stanford time
out and with the Cardinal trailing
7-2, junior outside hitter Julie
Baker had a decisive smash to
give the Cardinal a side-out and
start a run of lOstraight Stanford
points. Stanford then went on to
win the match, 15-12, on a block
bv Cardinal freshman Kim
Oden.
Stanford showed the effects of
having to play three tough
matches on three consecutive
days as they lost the first game of
the Arizona match, 18-16. Fre
quently, the Cardinal was unable
to capitalize on bad sets by the
Wildcats and often responded
with mistakes of their own.
The Cardinal won the second
and third games, 15-8 and 15-11,
respectively, behind the com
bination of sophomore setter
Diedra Dvorak and quick-setting
senior middle blocker J.J.
Gearhart.
The UCLA game proved to be
the highlight of the weekend.
Before 600 fans, Stanford's larg
est crowd of the season, the
Cardinal burst to an 11-0 lead
against the nervous and ap
prehensive Bruins, who were
playing without starting senior
setter Jeanne Beauprey. Stanford
never looked back, winning the
first game 15-6, and eventually
taking the match in four games.
The Cardinal won the second
game 15-8, but »n'the third game
UCLA, paced by'junior outside
hitters Bev Lidyoff and Patty
Orozco, rebounded with a 15-10
win.
The Cardinal bounced back in

the fourth game and defeated the
Bruins 15-7 with the last side-out
and point coming on Oden
smashes. The UCLA match also
featured the first time that
Cardinal outside hitter Deanna
Bovette had to play against her
sister, Michelle, a freshman setter
for UCLA. "It was weird," said
Bovette, "I wanted us to win, but
I wanted her to do well."
If UCLA was the highlight,
Arizona State was the lowlight of
the Cardinal's weekend. The

rested and enthusiastic Sun Dev
ils overpowered the drained
Cardinal in four games. ASU ex
ploited the vulnerable Stanford
midcourt and, led by junior
blocker Terri Edison, sent the
Cardinal shots back before Stan
ford could react. The Card lost
the first two games 17-15 and
16-14. Stanford managed to beat
the relaxed Sun Devils in the
third game, 15-9. The Arizona
State outride hitters, most
notablv Ireshman Valentina

Vega, again began to attack the
Cardinal defense, however, and
gave ASU the deciding game,
15-11. "We were due for that,"
said a downcast Shaw. "We
weren't ready to play, every once
in a while you have one of those
games."
The weekend's action moved
the Cardinal's league record to
6-2 and 16-5 overall. Stanford
next meets Cal State-Fullerton
Friday in a non-conference
match at Maples Pavilion.

never looked back, winning the
first game 15-6, and eventually
taking the match in four games.
The Cardinal won the second
game 15-8, but »n'the third game
UCLA, paced by'junior outside
hitters Bev Lidyoff and Patty
Orozco, rebounded with a 15-10
win.
The Cardinal bounced back in

the fourth game and defeated the
Bruins 15-7 with the last side-out
and point coming on Oden
smashes. The UCLA match also
featured the first time that
Cardinal outside hitter Deanna
Bovette had to play against her
sister, Michelle, a freshman setter
for UCLA. "It was weird," said
Bovette, "I wanted us to win, but
I wanted her to do well."
If UCLA was the highlight,
Arizona State was the lowlight of
the Cardinal's weekend. The

rested and enthusiastic Sun Dev
ils overpowered the drained
Cardinal in four games. ASU ex
ploited the vulnerable Stanford
midcourt and, led by junior
blocker Terri Edison, sent the
Cardinal shots back before Stan
ford could react. The Card lost
the first two games 17-15 and
16-14. Stanford managed to beat
the relaxed Sun Devils in the
third game, 15-9. The Arizona
State outride hitters, most
notablv Ireshman Valentina

Vega, again began to attack the
Cardinal defense, however, and
gave ASU the deciding game,
15-11. "We were due for that,"
said a downcast Shaw. "We
weren't ready to play, every once
in a while you have one of those
games."
The weekend's action moved
the Cardinal's league record to
6-2 and 16-5 overall. Stanford
next meets Cal State-Fullerton
Friday in a non-conference
match at Maples Pavilion.

BAKER BUMPS: Stanford junior outside hitter Julie Baker bumps the ball in Stanford's four
game victory over No. 9-ranked UCLA Friday night at Maples Pavilion as teammate Kisi Haine
watches. The Cardinal also beat No. 3 Arizona last night, but lost to eighth-ranked ASU Satur
day.
It was a "brutal weekend,"
said Don Shaw, assistant coach
of the Stanford women's vol
leyball team.
It was a weekend in which his
team played three of the top 10
schools in the country and came
away with two wins. Stanford
won an emotional match against
ninth-ranked UCLA on Friday,
lost a close one to No. 8 Arizona
State on Saturday, and came
from behind last night to edge
No. 3 Arizona. All were con
ference matches held at Maples
Pavilion.
"We survived," sighed Shaw
when it was all over. "It was nice
to get out of this weekend with
two wins."
After winning two of the first
three games against Arizona yes
terday, the Cardinal rallied from
a five-point deficit in the final
game to assure a winning week
end. Following a Stanford time
out and with the Cardinal trailing
7-2, junior outside hitter Julie
Baker had a decisive smash to
give the Cardinal a side-out and
start a run of lOstraight Stanford
points. Stanford then went on to
win the match, 15-12, on a block
bv Cardinal freshman Kim
Oden.
Stanford showed the effects of
having to play three tough
matches on three consecutive
days as they lost the first game of
the Arizona match, 18-16. Fre
quently, the Cardinal was unable
to capitalize on bad sets by the
Wildcats and often responded
with mistakes of their own.
The Cardinal won the second
and third games, 15-8 and 15-11,
respectively, behind the com
bination of sophomore setter
Diedra Dvorak and quick-setting
senior middle blocker J.J.
Gearhart.
The UCLA game proved to be
the highlight of the weekend.
Before 600 fans, Stanford's larg
est crowd of the season, the
Cardinal burst to an 11-0 lead
against the nervous and ap
prehensive Bruins, who were
playing without starting senior
setter Jeanne Beauprey. Stanford
never looked back, winning the
first game 15-6, and eventually
taking the match in four games.
