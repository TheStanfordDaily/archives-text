# Stanford breezes past St. Mary's 4-1
## 
### JOHN KELLY 
The Stanford men's soccer
team made it look easy Saturday
at Maloney Field, breaking open
the game early and rolling to a
4-1 win over St. Mary's College.
The Cardinal scored on the third
shot of the game and was never
threatened in lifting their record
to 12-2-1.
As the Cardinal moved up and
down the field in the early mo
ments, it became obvious that the
Gaels were simply undermanned.
On the second offensive attack,
the first being thwarted by a nice
save of a Casio Conceicao blast,
Stanford scored. A long through
ball to striker Jorge Titinger pen
etrated the defensive line. Tit
inger then took the ball in full
stride, dribbled it to the goal line,

and then crossed it back across
the goalmouth where it was
slammed into the net by senior
midfielder Albert Jordan.
St. Mary's was so well-con
tained offensively that the
Cardinal defenders found time to
push forward themselves, which
produced some strong overlap
ping play by senior Mark Talk
ington and effective passing by
sophomore Tom McGannon.
Stanford scored again, just 18
minutes into the game, when Rob
West pushed a ball through to
freshman Todd Rafalovich, who
beat the St. Mary's defender to
the outside and then chipped the
ball across the goal to Jordan,
who trapped the ball on his chest,
juked one defender and ham
mered home his second goal of

the afternoon.
Stanford continued its of
fensive pressure, but St. Mary's
goaltender Dave Konecny con
tinually staved off other scoring
attempts by the Cardinal.
First it was a strong head ball
by Doug Clark that seemed to be
going in, but was cleared off the
goal line by a defender. Then Tit
inger rifled a shot that was just
tipped over the crossbar by the
flying Konecny.
Stanford finally scored the de
cisive third goal a minute before
halftime when Bruce Finley
tapped in a lazy cross from Tit
inger, which had rolled slowly
across the face of the goal past
several St. Mary's defenders.
In the second half it was more
of the same, with Konecny mak

ing save after save on shots from
Rafalovich, West, and Giancarlo
Ferruzzi. Late in the game he had
to leave the game in pain after an
other save.
Midway through the final half,
Stanford scored on his re
placement. Sophomore mid
fielder Conceicao brought down
a Titinger through ball on the run
and then slotted it home just in
side of the post to notch the
Card's final score.
Stanford travels to play Cal
State-Dominguez Hills and Far
West powerhouse UCLA. The
Cardinal's next home game is
Sunday at 11 a.m. at Maloney
Field against an always-tough
University of San Francisco.
