Shultz makes first bilateral visit
Washington — Secretary of State George Shultz set out yesterday on a
fence-mending mission to Ottawa, prepared to discuss the full range of irri
tants in U.S.-Canadian relations.
The 24-hour trip, Shultz's First official bilateral visit to another country
since he took office last summer, is expected to be a forum for frank talk, not
new agreements.
"They will discuss the state of relations, which is not in the best of shape
these days," said one Canadian official who asked not to be identified.
"What we would like to see is a commitment to avoiding any kind of dis
ruption or deterioration in our relationship," Canadian Ambassador Alan
Gotlieb told reporters last week. "We want to clear up a number of odd mis
understandings."
Gotlieb characterized relations between the two countries as "not as bad
as they have been made out." But he acknowledged that relations recently
have often been marked by "rhetoric of a high decibel level."
Shultz planned to meet yesterday afternoon and this morning with Allan
McEachen, Canada's secretary of state for external affairs. Also on his
schedule today is lunch with Prime Minister Pierre Trudeau.
Although most of the issues on the agenda were economic, environmental
and international concerns also were expected to be broached.
Translator accused of security breach
London — Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher yesterday was asked to
make a statement to Parliament on allegations that a translator accused of
spying for the Soviets had made one of the deepest penetrations of Western
intelligence operations since World War 11.
"What we are concerned about is whether or not... our national security
is at risk," said Labor Party member of Parliament Ted Leadbitter in calling
for the statement.
He referred to a report in yesterday's New York Times that quoted uniden
tified senior American officials as saying the breach of security occurred at
the Government Communications Headquarters, Britain's worldwide
eavesdropping center, in Cheltenham.
The Times said a "mole" who penetrated the top-secret facility fed the So
viets information that could have allowed them to change their codes and
protect their own secrets.
The Times identified him as Geoffrey Prime, 44, a translator of Russian at
Cheltenham.
In July, Prime was arraigned on espionage charges that a prosecutor de
scribed then as being "of the graver.t possible nature." Prime was ordered
held in custody for a hearing at a later date.
Details of Prime's arrest were not disclosed here because of str
ingent restrictions imposed by Britain's Official Secrets Act, un
der which he was arrested.
But the Times, in a Washington-dated story, quoted American
officials as saying Prime had access to highly classified informa
tion flowing into the Cheltenham center from satellites and
ground stations operated by the United States.
Britain's Home Office — which is responsible for domestic af
fairs — the Foreign Office and the prime minister's office all de
clined comment on the report. But a spokesman for Thatcher
said the prime minister would consider Leadbitter's suggestion
that she make a statement on the affair to the House of Com
mons.
Christians to cooperate with Gemayel
Beirut — The commander-in-chief of Lebanon's Christian
militia yesterday signaled that his forces will cooperate with Pres
ident Amin Gemayel as long as he works to expel foreign forces
from the country.
"We stretch out our hand in a spirit of collaboration to the
president of the republic," said Fady Frem, leader of the Leba
nese Forces. But he added that the militia's 10, OCX) to 20,000
gunmen would continue their "struggle" until all foreigners —
meaning in particular Syrian and Palestinian forces — had left.
The Christian militia leader's pledge of at least conditional co
operation with Lebanon's central government came as U.S. spe
cial envoy Morris Draper returned to Beirut to resume U.S. ef
forts to bring about the withdrawal of foreign forces from Leba
non.
In Jerusalem, meanwhile, the Israeli government restated its
insistence that the remaining Palestine Liberation Organization
forces in Lebanon be the first to leave the country, after which
there would be a simultaneous withdrawal of Israeli and Syrian
troops.
An Israeli Foreign Ministry spokesman said his government
knew nothing about a possible arrangement reported in news
papers here Saturday under which Israeli troops would pull back
from their positions in Lebanon in return for a complete with
drawal of Palestinian guerrillas.
Frem spoke at a memorial service for Bashir Gemayel, his
predecessor as head of the militia, who was assassinated Sept. 14,
shortly before he was to take office as president. Amin, Bashir's
older brother, later was elected but is not believed to enjoy the
firm loyalty that the militia accorded his brother.
The president has made the withdrawal of foreign troops the
central goal of his administration, and the Christian militiamen
generally have been quiet.
Frem's comments raised the possibility, however, that the
militia might turn nasty if Gemayel does not achieve progress. It
is by far the country's most powerful militia force since the Israeli
army swept away more than 10,000 Palestinian guerrillas.
Gunmen of the Lebanese Forces reportedly were the principal
killers in the massacre of hundreds of Palestinian civilians in
Beirut last month.
Japan for moderate defense buildup
Tokyo — Yasuhiro Nakasone, 64, one of the two leading can
didates to become Japan's next prime minister, said here yester
day that Japan should reach a compromise with the United
States over American demands for greater Japanese defense
spending as a means "to make the United States seriously want
to protect Japan."
Nakasone made the statement in a television debate with the
three other candidates seeking the presidency of the ruling Liber
al Democratic Party, a position whose occupant will become
prime minister to replace the resigning Zenko Suzuki.
Both Nakasone, director of the Administrative Management
Agency, and the other leading candidate, Toshio Komoto, 71,
director of the Economic Planning Agency, supported a mod
erate defense buildup.
But both leaders refused to support any rapid increase in de

fense spending, such as Secretary of Defense Caspar Weinberger
has advocated for Japan. The issue of U.S.-Japanese trade prob
lems did not come up in the debate.
Komoto said he thought his party's outline for a 1983-1987
military buildup announced last July — which Weinberger called
inadequate to cope with the growing Soviet threat in Asia —
would be sufficient for Japan. He also urged that defense plan
ning be considered in overall terms, including both economic
and diplomatic efforts.
Although Nakasone said that "defending one's own country
with one's own hands is only natural," he phrased his comments
in the context of using U.S. power to ensure Japan's security.
"How skillfully we can make the United States cooperate, or
to use unflattering words, how we can make the United States
seriously want to protect Japan, is up to the skill of diplomacy,"
he said.
"Looking at it in this way, the United States is troubled with
problems all around the world. At such a time, it is asking Japan
for help, for Japan to do a little more for itself. If we talk things
over, America and Japan will come to an understanding. Finding
a point for a compromise and making the U.S.-Japan security
treaty (so that) U.S. power can be exercised to the greatest extent
possible (for Japan's defense) is up to the skill of diplomacy," he
said.
Walesa's wife reports strip-search
Warsaw — Security forces stripped Lech Walesa's wife naked
and tried to undress his two screaming daughters in an attempt to
find evidence that could be used to place the detained labor chief
under formal arrest, the wife said.
Danuta Walesa, visibly upset after her return home to
Gdansk, said the strip-search by female agents took place Friday
in a police station in southeastern Przemysl, near the resort
where she visited her interned husband for five days. Walesa,
leader of the now outlawed Solidarity labor federation, has been
in detention without charge since martial law was decreed Dec.
13. „
Mrs. Walesa told The Associated Press in an exclusive in
terview in her Gdansk home Saturday that she protested at the
time of the strip-search and planned to file a protest with the
Communist government's martial-law authorities.
There was no immediate comment from Polish officials on
Mrs. Walesa's claims.
She said her daughters Magda, 4, and Anna, 2, screamed and
cried when the agents tried to strip them in a room next to the
office where she was forced to take all her clothes off.
"It was the most horrible thing. It's impossible to put into
words," she said when asked what went through her mind when
she was forced to submit to the strip-search and heard her daugh
ters screaming. She said Magda and Anna finally were frisked
with their clothes on after the agents gave up trying to undress
them.
Mrs. Walesa said she believed the agents were searching for
any kind of smuggled appeal or statement from her husband with
which they could formally charge him with a crime.
She said they found nothing and that she and her daughters
were released after two hours.
Republicans pitch for campaign funds
Republicans rolled out their big guns Saturday for a final
fund-raising push to buy additional television advertising for
gubernatoral candidate George Deukmejian and U.S. Senate
hopeful Pete Wilson.
Vice President George Bush headlined a $150-a-person dinner
at the Los Angeles Convention Center Saturday night that
brought in some $125,000, boosting Deukmejian over his $3.5
million general election fund-raising goal.
Bush told some 800 contributors that President Reagan's poli
cies are "making America great again."
The administration's economic program has begun to work,
he said, although the "unemployment rate is unacceptable," a
theme that was echoed by former President Gerald Ford during
an appearance at a $1000-a-person dinner with Wilson near

Palm Springs.
Ford said the 10.1 percent unemployment is "unfortunate,"
but that all other economic signs are very encouraging.
"Unemployment is always the last economic factor that shows
any improvement. But we're going to straighten it out, we're on
the right path," Ford told reporters.
Ford said he expected Wilson to wih his U.S. Senate race
against Democratic Gov. Brown and that state Attorney Gener
al Deukmejian "is probably behind (Los Angeles' Democratic
Mayor Tom Bradley), but he's got a good shot at it."
Ford said he expected Republicans would hold the Senate and
lose no more than 10 to 20 House seats.
Bush told the Deukmejian gathering it is critical that Wilson
win California's U.S. Senate seat so the administration can "do
what we set out to do."
In the governor's race, he said, "California faces a choice like
the one the country faced two years ago."
Rebel forces kill Salvadorans
San Salvador — Leftist guerrillas yesterday claimed to have
killed or wounded 313 government troops and captured 107 oth
ers during a major offensive launched two weeks ago.
The military has reported about 150 government casualties
and about 300 guerrillas killed since the nationwide drive began
Oct. 10.
The guerrillas' clandestine Radio Venceremos (We Shall Ov
ercome) provided no breakdown on the casualties. It said rebel
forces also have seized 61,358 bullets and 130 grenades, mortars
or cannon shells during the push.
About 84 of the 107 reported captives apparently have been
released by the rebels, who claim to still be holding several mili
tary officers.
A Roman Catholic priest said yesterday that the number of
labor and leftist leaders missing in San Salvador has risen to 15.
The Rev. Jesus Delgado made the announcement during a ser
mon at the city cathedral, where handfuls of guerrilla leaflets
were tossed to worshipers.
He said the disappearences appeared aimed at widening the
split between leftist guerrillas and the U.S.-backed rightist gov
ernment, which the rebels have been fighting to topple for three
years.
Belgian consul missing yesterday
San Francisco — Belgium's honorary consul general in San
Francisco was reported missing yesterday, a day after he van
ished from his apartment residence.
Rene Thimister, 66, a former Belgian ambassador to Senegal
and Cameroon, was the official consul general in San Francisco
prior to his retirement last year from the Belgian foreign service,
said Jozef Baerten, Belgian consular attache in Washington.
"It's a reaction of shock. We can't speculate as far as reasons
go," Baerten said.
Police yesterday distributed photos and a description of
Thimister, but Sgt. Jim Long said he didn't have details of what
the consul was doing at the time of his disappearance, between
noon and Ip.m., nor did he know if there were indications of foul
play.
Thimister, who joined the Belgian foreign service in 1946, had
served in Bucharest, Romania; Athens, Greece; Calcutta, India;
Quito, Ecuador, and Vancouver, Canada, as well as in Yaounde,
Camaroon; Dakar, Senegal and San Francisco.
Among the reasons Thimister retired to San Francisco,
Baerten said, "apparently is that he has a son who is still studying
and he wanted to finish his studies in the United States."
Today's weather
Showers likely today. Highs in the 60s to low 70s. Winds
southerly at 10 to 20 mph. Chance of measurable rain increasing
to 60 percent by afternoon. A 60 percent chance of showers to
night, decreasing to a 40 percent chance of showers tomorrow.

director of the Economic Planning Agency, supported a mod
erate defense buildup.
But both leaders refused to support any rapid increase in de

fense spending, such as Secretary of Defense Caspar Weinberger
has advocated for Japan. The issue of U.S.-Japanese trade prob
lems did not come up in the debate.
Komoto said he thought his party's outline for a 1983-1987
military buildup announced last July — which Weinberger called
inadequate to cope with the growing Soviet threat in Asia —
would be sufficient for Japan. He also urged that defense plan
ning be considered in overall terms, including both economic
and diplomatic efforts.
Although Nakasone said that "defending one's own country
with one's own hands is only natural," he phrased his comments
in the context of using U.S. power to ensure Japan's security.
"How skillfully we can make the United States cooperate, or
to use unflattering words, how we can make the United States
seriously want to protect Japan, is up to the skill of diplomacy,"
he said.
"Looking at it in this way, the United States is troubled with
problems all around the world. At such a time, it is asking Japan
for help, for Japan to do a little more for itself. If we talk things
over, America and Japan will come to an understanding. Finding
a point for a compromise and making the U.S.-Japan security
treaty (so that) U.S. power can be exercised to the greatest extent
possible (for Japan's defense) is up to the skill of diplomacy," he
said.
Walesa's wife reports strip-search
Warsaw — Security forces stripped Lech Walesa's wife naked
and tried to undress his two screaming daughters in an attempt to
find evidence that could be used to place the detained labor chief
under formal arrest, the wife said.
Danuta Walesa, visibly upset after her return home to
Gdansk, said the strip-search by female agents took place Friday
in a police station in southeastern Przemysl, near the resort
where she visited her interned husband for five days. Walesa,
leader of the now outlawed Solidarity labor federation, has been
in detention without charge since martial law was decreed Dec.
13. „
Mrs. Walesa told The Associated Press in an exclusive in
terview in her Gdansk home Saturday that she protested at the
time of the strip-search and planned to file a protest with the
Communist government's martial-law authorities.
There was no immediate comment from Polish officials on
Mrs. Walesa's claims.
She said her daughters Magda, 4, and Anna, 2, screamed and
cried when the agents tried to strip them in a room next to the
office where she was forced to take all her clothes off.
"It was the most horrible thing. It's impossible to put into
words," she said when asked what went through her mind when
she was forced to submit to the strip-search and heard her daugh
ters screaming. She said Magda and Anna finally were frisked
with their clothes on after the agents gave up trying to undress
them.
Mrs. Walesa said she believed the agents were searching for
any kind of smuggled appeal or statement from her husband with
which they could formally charge him with a crime.
She said they found nothing and that she and her daughters
were released after two hours.
Republicans pitch for campaign funds
Republicans rolled out their big guns Saturday for a final
fund-raising push to buy additional television advertising for
gubernatoral candidate George Deukmejian and U.S. Senate
hopeful Pete Wilson.
Vice President George Bush headlined a $150-a-person dinner
at the Los Angeles Convention Center Saturday night that
brought in some $125,000, boosting Deukmejian over his $3.5
million general election fund-raising goal.
Bush told some 800 contributors that President Reagan's poli
cies are "making America great again."
The administration's economic program has begun to work,
he said, although the "unemployment rate is unacceptable," a
theme that was echoed by former President Gerald Ford during
an appearance at a $1000-a-person dinner with Wilson near

Palm Springs.
Ford said the 10.1 percent unemployment is "unfortunate,"
but that all other economic signs are very encouraging.
"Unemployment is always the last economic factor that shows
any improvement. But we're going to straighten it out, we're on
the right path," Ford told reporters.
Ford said he expected Wilson to wih his U.S. Senate race
against Democratic Gov. Brown and that state Attorney Gener
al Deukmejian "is probably behind (Los Angeles' Democratic
Mayor Tom Bradley), but he's got a good shot at it."
Ford said he expected Republicans would hold the Senate and
lose no more than 10 to 20 House seats.
Bush told the Deukmejian gathering it is critical that Wilson
win California's U.S. Senate seat so the administration can "do
what we set out to do."
In the governor's race, he said, "California faces a choice like
the one the country faced two years ago."
Rebel forces kill Salvadorans
San Salvador — Leftist guerrillas yesterday claimed to have
killed or wounded 313 government troops and captured 107 oth
ers during a major offensive launched two weeks ago.
The military has reported about 150 government casualties
and about 300 guerrillas killed since the nationwide drive began
Oct. 10.
The guerrillas' clandestine Radio Venceremos (We Shall Ov
ercome) provided no breakdown on the casualties. It said rebel
forces also have seized 61,358 bullets and 130 grenades, mortars
or cannon shells during the push.
About 84 of the 107 reported captives apparently have been
released by the rebels, who claim to still be holding several mili
tary officers.
A Roman Catholic priest said yesterday that the number of
labor and leftist leaders missing in San Salvador has risen to 15.
The Rev. Jesus Delgado made the announcement during a ser
mon at the city cathedral, where handfuls of guerrilla leaflets
were tossed to worshipers.
He said the disappearences appeared aimed at widening the
split between leftist guerrillas and the U.S.-backed rightist gov
ernment, which the rebels have been fighting to topple for three
years.
Belgian consul missing yesterday
San Francisco — Belgium's honorary consul general in San
Francisco was reported missing yesterday, a day after he van
ished from his apartment residence.
Rene Thimister, 66, a former Belgian ambassador to Senegal
and Cameroon, was the official consul general in San Francisco
prior to his retirement last year from the Belgian foreign service,
said Jozef Baerten, Belgian consular attache in Washington.
"It's a reaction of shock. We can't speculate as far as reasons
go," Baerten said.
Police yesterday distributed photos and a description of
Thimister, but Sgt. Jim Long said he didn't have details of what
the consul was doing at the time of his disappearance, between
noon and Ip.m., nor did he know if there were indications of foul
play.
Thimister, who joined the Belgian foreign service in 1946, had
served in Bucharest, Romania; Athens, Greece; Calcutta, India;
Quito, Ecuador, and Vancouver, Canada, as well as in Yaounde,
Camaroon; Dakar, Senegal and San Francisco.
Among the reasons Thimister retired to San Francisco,
Baerten said, "apparently is that he has a son who is still studying
and he wanted to finish his studies in the United States."
Today's weather
Showers likely today. Highs in the 60s to low 70s. Winds
southerly at 10 to 20 mph. Chance of measurable rain increasing
to 60 percent by afternoon. A 60 percent chance of showers to
night, decreasing to a 40 percent chance of showers tomorrow.

Shultz makes first bilateral visit
Washington — Secretary of State George Shultz set out yesterday on a
fence-mending mission to Ottawa, prepared to discuss the full range of irri
tants in U.S.-Canadian relations.
The 24-hour trip, Shultz's First official bilateral visit to another country
since he took office last summer, is expected to be a forum for frank talk, not
new agreements.
"They will discuss the state of relations, which is not in the best of shape
these days," said one Canadian official who asked not to be identified.
"What we would like to see is a commitment to avoiding any kind of dis
ruption or deterioration in our relationship," Canadian Ambassador Alan
Gotlieb told reporters last week. "We want to clear up a number of odd mis
understandings."
Gotlieb characterized relations between the two countries as "not as bad
as they have been made out." But he acknowledged that relations recently
have often been marked by "rhetoric of a high decibel level."
Shultz planned to meet yesterday afternoon and this morning with Allan
McEachen, Canada's secretary of state for external affairs. Also on his
schedule today is lunch with Prime Minister Pierre Trudeau.
Although most of the issues on the agenda were economic, environmental
and international concerns also were expected to be broached.
Translator accused of security breach
London — Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher yesterday was asked to
make a statement to Parliament on allegations that a translator accused of
spying for the Soviets had made one of the deepest penetrations of Western
intelligence operations since World War 11.
"What we are concerned about is whether or not... our national security
is at risk," said Labor Party member of Parliament Ted Leadbitter in calling
for the statement.
He referred to a report in yesterday's New York Times that quoted uniden
tified senior American officials as saying the breach of security occurred at
the Government Communications Headquarters, Britain's worldwide
eavesdropping center, in Cheltenham.
The Times said a "mole" who penetrated the top-secret facility fed the So
viets information that could have allowed them to change their codes and
protect their own secrets.
The Times identified him as Geoffrey Prime, 44, a translator of Russian at
Cheltenham.
In July, Prime was arraigned on espionage charges that a prosecutor de
scribed then as being "of the graver.t possible nature." Prime was ordered
held in custody for a hearing at a later date.
Details of Prime's arrest were not disclosed here because of str
ingent restrictions imposed by Britain's Official Secrets Act, un
der which he was arrested.
But the Times, in a Washington-dated story, quoted American
officials as saying Prime had access to highly classified informa
tion flowing into the Cheltenham center from satellites and
ground stations operated by the United States.
Britain's Home Office — which is responsible for domestic af
fairs — the Foreign Office and the prime minister's office all de
clined comment on the report. But a spokesman for Thatcher
said the prime minister would consider Leadbitter's suggestion
that she make a statement on the affair to the House of Com
mons.
Christians to cooperate with Gemayel
Beirut — The commander-in-chief of Lebanon's Christian
militia yesterday signaled that his forces will cooperate with Pres
ident Amin Gemayel as long as he works to expel foreign forces
from the country.
"We stretch out our hand in a spirit of collaboration to the
president of the republic," said Fady Frem, leader of the Leba
nese Forces. But he added that the militia's 10, OCX) to 20,000
gunmen would continue their "struggle" until all foreigners —
meaning in particular Syrian and Palestinian forces — had left.
The Christian militia leader's pledge of at least conditional co
operation with Lebanon's central government came as U.S. spe
cial envoy Morris Draper returned to Beirut to resume U.S. ef
forts to bring about the withdrawal of foreign forces from Leba
non.
In Jerusalem, meanwhile, the Israeli government restated its
insistence that the remaining Palestine Liberation Organization
forces in Lebanon be the first to leave the country, after which
there would be a simultaneous withdrawal of Israeli and Syrian
troops.
An Israeli Foreign Ministry spokesman said his government
knew nothing about a possible arrangement reported in news
papers here Saturday under which Israeli troops would pull back
from their positions in Lebanon in return for a complete with
drawal of Palestinian guerrillas.
Frem spoke at a memorial service for Bashir Gemayel, his
predecessor as head of the militia, who was assassinated Sept. 14,
shortly before he was to take office as president. Amin, Bashir's
older brother, later was elected but is not believed to enjoy the
firm loyalty that the militia accorded his brother.
The president has made the withdrawal of foreign troops the
central goal of his administration, and the Christian militiamen
generally have been quiet.
Frem's comments raised the possibility, however, that the
militia might turn nasty if Gemayel does not achieve progress. It
is by far the country's most powerful militia force since the Israeli
army swept away more than 10,000 Palestinian guerrillas.
Gunmen of the Lebanese Forces reportedly were the principal
killers in the massacre of hundreds of Palestinian civilians in
Beirut last month.
Japan for moderate defense buildup
Tokyo — Yasuhiro Nakasone, 64, one of the two leading can
didates to become Japan's next prime minister, said here yester
day that Japan should reach a compromise with the United
States over American demands for greater Japanese defense
spending as a means "to make the United States seriously want
to protect Japan."
Nakasone made the statement in a television debate with the
three other candidates seeking the presidency of the ruling Liber
al Democratic Party, a position whose occupant will become
prime minister to replace the resigning Zenko Suzuki.
Both Nakasone, director of the Administrative Management
Agency, and the other leading candidate, Toshio Komoto, 71,
director of the Economic Planning Agency, supported a mod

A Roman Catholic priest said yesterday that the number of
labor and leftist leaders missing in San Salvador has risen to 15.
The Rev. Jesus Delgado made the announcement during a ser

were tossed to worshipers.
He said the disappearences appeared aimed at widening the
split between leftist guerrillas and the U.S.-backed rightist gov

years.
Belgian consul missing yesterday
San Francisco — Belgium's honorary consul general in San
Francisco was reported missing yesterday, a day after he van
ished from his apartment residence.
Rene Thimister, 66, a former Belgian ambassador to Senegal
and Cameroon, was the official consul general in San Francisco
prior to his retirement last year from the Belgian foreign service,
said Jozef Baerten, Belgian consular attache in Washington.
"It's a reaction of shock. We can't speculate as far as reasons
go," Baerten said.
Police yesterday distributed photos and a description of
Thimister, but Sgt. Jim Long said he didn't have details of what
the consul was doing at the time of his disappearance, between
noon and Ip.m., nor did he know if there were indications of foul
play.
Thimister, who joined the Belgian foreign service in 1946, had
served in Bucharest, Romania; Athens, Greece; Calcutta, India;
Quito, Ecuador, and Vancouver, Canada, as well as in Yaounde,
Camaroon; Dakar, Senegal and San Francisco.
Among the reasons Thimister retired to San Francisco,
Baerten said, "apparently is that he has a son who is still studying
and he wanted to finish his studies in the United States."

Shultz makes first bilateral visit
Washington — Secretary of State George Shultz set out yesterday on a
fence-mending mission to Ottawa, prepared to discuss the full range of irri
tants in U.S.-Canadian relations.
The 24-hour trip, Shultz's First official bilateral visit to another country
since he took office last summer, is expected to be a forum for frank talk, not
new agreements.
"They will discuss the state of relations, which is not in the best of shape
these days," said one Canadian official who asked not to be identified.
"What we would like to see is a commitment to avoiding any kind of dis
ruption or deterioration in our relationship," Canadian Ambassador Alan
Gotlieb told reporters last week. "We want to clear up a number of odd mis
understandings."
Gotlieb characterized relations between the two countries as "not as bad
as they have been made out." But he acknowledged that relations recently
have often been marked by "rhetoric of a high decibel level."
Shultz planned to meet yesterday afternoon and this morning with Allan
McEachen, Canada's secretary of state for external affairs. Also on his
schedule today is lunch with Prime Minister Pierre Trudeau.
Although most of the issues on the agenda were economic, environmental
and international concerns also were expected to be broached.
Translator accused of security breach
London — Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher yesterday was asked to
make a statement to Parliament on allegations that a translator accused of
spying for the Soviets had made one of the deepest penetrations of Western
intelligence operations since World War 11.
"What we are concerned about is whether or not... our national security
is at risk," said Labor Party member of Parliament Ted Leadbitter in calling
for the statement.
He referred to a report in yesterday's New York Times that quoted uniden
tified senior American officials as saying the breach of security occurred at
the Government Communications Headquarters, Britain's worldwide
eavesdropping center, in Cheltenham.
The Times said a "mole" who penetrated the top-secret facility fed the So
viets information that could have allowed them to change their codes and
protect their own secrets.
The Times identified him as Geoffrey Prime, 44, a translator of Russian at
Cheltenham.
In July, Prime was arraigned on espionage charges that a prosecutor de
scribed then as being "of the graver.t possible nature." Prime was ordered
held in custody for a hearing at a later date.
Details of Prime's arrest were not disclosed here because of str
ingent restrictions imposed by Britain's Official Secrets Act, un
der which he was arrested.
But the Times, in a Washington-dated story, quoted American
officials as saying Prime had access to highly classified informa
tion flowing into the Cheltenham center from satellites and
ground stations operated by the United States.
Britain's Home Office — which is responsible for domestic af
fairs — the Foreign Office and the prime minister's office all de
clined comment on the report. But a spokesman for Thatcher
said the prime minister would consider Leadbitter's suggestion
that she make a statement on the affair to the House of Com
mons.
Christians to cooperate with Gemayel
Beirut — The commander-in-chief of Lebanon's Christian
militia yesterday signaled that his forces will cooperate with Pres
ident Amin Gemayel as long as he works to expel foreign forces
from the country.
"We stretch out our hand in a spirit of collaboration to the
president of the republic," said Fady Frem, leader of the Leba
nese Forces. But he added that the militia's 10, OCX) to 20,000
gunmen would continue their "struggle" until all foreigners —
meaning in particular Syrian and Palestinian forces — had left.
The Christian militia leader's pledge of at least conditional co
operation with Lebanon's central government came as U.S. spe
cial envoy Morris Draper returned to Beirut to resume U.S. ef
forts to bring about the withdrawal of foreign forces from Leba
non.
In Jerusalem, meanwhile, the Israeli government restated its
insistence that the remaining Palestine Liberation Organization
forces in Lebanon be the first to leave the country, after which
there would be a simultaneous withdrawal of Israeli and Syrian
troops.
An Israeli Foreign Ministry spokesman said his government
knew nothing about a possible arrangement reported in news
papers here Saturday under which Israeli troops would pull back
from their positions in Lebanon in return for a complete with
drawal of Palestinian guerrillas.
Frem spoke at a memorial service for Bashir Gemayel, his
predecessor as head of the militia, who was assassinated Sept. 14,
shortly before he was to take office as president. Amin, Bashir's
older brother, later was elected but is not believed to enjoy the
firm loyalty that the militia accorded his brother.
The president has made the withdrawal of foreign troops the
central goal of his administration, and the Christian militiamen
generally have been quiet.
Frem's comments raised the possibility, however, that the
militia might turn nasty if Gemayel does not achieve progress. It
is by far the country's most powerful militia force since the Israeli
army swept away more than 10,000 Palestinian guerrillas.
Gunmen of the Lebanese Forces reportedly were the principal
killers in the massacre of hundreds of Palestinian civilians in
Beirut last month.
Japan for moderate defense buildup
Tokyo — Yasuhiro Nakasone, 64, one of the two leading can
didates to become Japan's next prime minister, said here yester
day that Japan should reach a compromise with the United
States over American demands for greater Japanese defense
spending as a means "to make the United States seriously want
to protect Japan."
Nakasone made the statement in a television debate with the
three other candidates seeking the presidency of the ruling Liber
al Democratic Party, a position whose occupant will become
prime minister to replace the resigning Zenko Suzuki.
Both Nakasone, director of the Administrative Management
Agency, and the other leading candidate, Toshio Komoto, 71,
director of the Economic Planning Agency, supported a mod
erate defense buildup.
But both leaders refused to support any rapid increase in de

fense spending, such as Secretary of Defense Caspar Weinberger
has advocated for Japan. The issue of U.S.-Japanese trade prob
lems did not come up in the debate.
Komoto said he thought his party's outline for a 1983-1987
military buildup announced last July — which Weinberger called
inadequate to cope with the growing Soviet threat in Asia —
would be sufficient for Japan. He also urged that defense plan
ning be considered in overall terms, including both economic
and diplomatic efforts.
Although Nakasone said that "defending one's own country
with one's own hands is only natural," he phrased his comments
in the context of using U.S. power to ensure Japan's security.
"How skillfully we can make the United States cooperate, or
to use unflattering words, how we can make the United States
seriously want to protect Japan, is up to the skill of diplomacy,"
he said.
"Looking at it in this way, the United States is troubled with
problems all around the world. At such a time, it is asking Japan
for help, for Japan to do a little more for itself. If we talk things
over, America and Japan will come to an understanding. Finding
a point for a compromise and making the U.S.-Japan security
treaty (so that) U.S. power can be exercised to the greatest extent
possible (for Japan's defense) is up to the skill of diplomacy," he
said.
Walesa's wife reports strip-search
Warsaw — Security forces stripped Lech Walesa's wife naked
and tried to undress his two screaming daughters in an attempt to
find evidence that could be used to place the detained labor chief
under formal arrest, the wife said.
Danuta Walesa, visibly upset after her return home to
Gdansk, said the strip-search by female agents took place Friday
in a police station in southeastern Przemysl, near the resort
where she visited her interned husband for five days. Walesa,
leader of the now outlawed Solidarity labor federation, has been
in detention without charge since martial law was decreed Dec.
13. „
Mrs. Walesa told The Associated Press in an exclusive in
terview in her Gdansk home Saturday that she protested at the
time of the strip-search and planned to file a protest with the
Communist government's martial-law authorities.
There was no immediate comment from Polish officials on
Mrs. Walesa's claims.
She said her daughters Magda, 4, and Anna, 2, screamed and
cried when the agents tried to strip them in a room next to the
office where she was forced to take all her clothes off.
"It was the most horrible thing. It's impossible to put into
words," she said when asked what went through her mind when
she was forced to submit to the strip-search and heard her daugh
ters screaming. She said Magda and Anna finally were frisked
with their clothes on after the agents gave up trying to undress
them.
Mrs. Walesa said she believed the agents were searching for
any kind of smuggled appeal or statement from her husband with
which they could formally charge him with a crime.
She said they found nothing and that she and her daughters
were released after two hours.
Republicans pitch for campaign funds
Republicans rolled out their big guns Saturday for a final
fund-raising push to buy additional television advertising for
gubernatoral candidate George Deukmejian and U.S. Senate
hopeful Pete Wilson.
Vice President George Bush headlined a $150-a-person dinner
at the Los Angeles Convention Center Saturday night that
brought in some $125,000, boosting Deukmejian over his $3.5
million general election fund-raising goal.
Bush told some 800 contributors that President Reagan's poli
cies are "making America great again."
The administration's economic program has begun to work,
he said, although the "unemployment rate is unacceptable," a
theme that was echoed by former President Gerald Ford during
an appearance at a $1000-a-person dinner with Wilson near

Palm Springs.
Ford said the 10.1 percent unemployment is "unfortunate,"
but that all other economic signs are very encouraging.
"Unemployment is always the last economic factor that shows
any improvement. But we're going to straighten it out, we're on
the right path," Ford told reporters.
Ford said he expected Wilson to wih his U.S. Senate race
against Democratic Gov. Brown and that state Attorney Gener
al Deukmejian "is probably behind (Los Angeles' Democratic
Mayor Tom Bradley), but he's got a good shot at it."
Ford said he expected Republicans would hold the Senate and
lose no more than 10 to 20 House seats.
Bush told the Deukmejian gathering it is critical that Wilson
win California's U.S. Senate seat so the administration can "do
what we set out to do."
In the governor's race, he said, "California faces a choice like
the one the country faced two years ago."
Rebel forces kill Salvadorans
San Salvador — Leftist guerrillas yesterday claimed to have
killed or wounded 313 government troops and captured 107 oth
ers during a major offensive launched two weeks ago.
The military has reported about 150 government casualties
and about 300 guerrillas killed since the nationwide drive began
Oct. 10.
The guerrillas' clandestine Radio Venceremos (We Shall Ov
ercome) provided no breakdown on the casualties. It said rebel
forces also have seized 61,358 bullets and 130 grenades, mortars
or cannon shells during the push.
About 84 of the 107 reported captives apparently have been
released by the rebels, who claim to still be holding several mili
tary officers.
A Roman Catholic priest said yesterday that the number of
labor and leftist leaders missing in San Salvador has risen to 15.
The Rev. Jesus Delgado made the announcement during a ser
mon at the city cathedral, where handfuls of guerrilla leaflets
were tossed to worshipers.
He said the disappearences appeared aimed at widening the

cial envoy Morris Draper returned to Beirut to resume U.S. ef
forts to bring about the withdrawal of foreign forces from Leba
non.
In Jerusalem, meanwhile, the Israeli government restated its
insistence that the remaining Palestine Liberation Organization
forces in Lebanon be the first to leave the country, after which
there would be a simultaneous withdrawal of Israeli and Syrian
troops.
An Israeli Foreign Ministry spokesman said his government
knew nothing about a possible arrangement reported in news
papers here Saturday under which Israeli troops would pull back
from their positions in Lebanon in return for a complete with
drawal of Palestinian guerrillas.
Frem spoke at a memorial service for Bashir Gemayel, his
predecessor as head of the militia, who was assassinated Sept. 14,
shortly before he was to take office as president. Amin, Bashir's
older brother, later was elected but is not believed to enjoy the
firm loyalty that the militia accorded his brother.
The president has made the withdrawal of foreign troops the
central goal of his administration, and the Christian militiamen
generally have been quiet.
Frem's comments raised the possibility, however, that the
militia might turn nasty if Gemayel does not achieve progress. It
is by far the country's most powerful militia force since the Israeli
army swept away more than 10,000 Palestinian guerrillas.
Gunmen of the Lebanese Forces reportedly were the principal
killers in the massacre of hundreds of Palestinian civilians in
Beirut last month.
Japan for moderate defense buildup
Tokyo — Yasuhiro Nakasone, 64, one of the two leading can
didates to become Japan's next prime minister, said here yester
day that Japan should reach a compromise with the United
States over American demands for greater Japanese defense
spending as a means "to make the United States seriously want
to protect Japan."
Nakasone made the statement in a television debate with the
three other candidates seeking the presidency of the ruling Liber
al Democratic Party, a position whose occupant will become
prime minister to replace the resigning Zenko Suzuki.
Both Nakasone, director of the Administrative Management
Agency, and the other leading candidate, Toshio Komoto, 71,
director of the Economic Planning Agency, supported a mod
erate defense buildup.
But both leaders refused to support any rapid increase in de

fense spending, such as Secretary of Defense Caspar Weinberger
has advocated for Japan. The issue of U.S.-Japanese trade prob
lems did not come up in the debate.
Komoto said he thought his party's outline for a 1983-1987
military buildup announced last July — which Weinberger called
inadequate to cope with the growing Soviet threat in Asia —
would be sufficient for Japan. He also urged that defense plan
ning be considered in overall terms, including both economic
and diplomatic efforts.
Although Nakasone said that "defending one's own country
with one's own hands is only natural," he phrased his comments
in the context of using U.S. power to ensure Japan's security.
"How skillfully we can make the United States cooperate, or
to use unflattering words, how we can make the United States
seriously want to protect Japan, is up to the skill of diplomacy,"
he said.
"Looking at it in this way, the United States is troubled with
problems all around the world. At such a time, it is asking Japan
for help, for Japan to do a little more for itself. If we talk things
over, America and Japan will come to an understanding. Finding
a point for a compromise and making the U.S.-Japan security
treaty (so that) U.S. power can be exercised to the greatest extent
possible (for Japan's defense) is up to the skill of diplomacy," he
said.
Walesa's wife reports strip-search
Warsaw — Security forces stripped Lech Walesa's wife naked
and tried to undress his two screaming daughters in an attempt to
find evidence that could be used to place the detained labor chief
under formal arrest, the wife said.
Danuta Walesa, visibly upset after her return home to
Gdansk, said the strip-search by female agents took place Friday
in a police station in southeastern Przemysl, near the resort
where she visited her interned husband for five days. Walesa,
leader of the now outlawed Solidarity labor federation, has been
in detention without charge since martial law was decreed Dec.
13. „
Mrs. Walesa told The Associated Press in an exclusive in
terview in her Gdansk home Saturday that she protested at the
time of the strip-search and planned to file a protest with the
Communist government's martial-law authorities.
There was no immediate comment from Polish officials on
Mrs. Walesa's claims.
She said her daughters Magda, 4, and Anna, 2, screamed and
cried when the agents tried to strip them in a room next to the
office where she was forced to take all her clothes off.
"It was the most horrible thing. It's impossible to put into
words," she said when asked what went through her mind when
she was forced to submit to the strip-search and heard her daugh
ters screaming. She said Magda and Anna finally were frisked
with their clothes on after the agents gave up trying to undress
them.
Mrs. Walesa said she believed the agents were searching for
any kind of smuggled appeal or statement from her husband with
which they could formally charge him with a crime.
She said they found nothing and that she and her daughters
were released after two hours.
Republicans pitch for campaign funds
Republicans rolled out their big guns Saturday for a final
fund-raising push to buy additional television advertising for
gubernatoral candidate George Deukmejian and U.S. Senate
hopeful Pete Wilson.
Vice President George Bush headlined a $150-a-person dinner
at the Los Angeles Convention Center Saturday night that
brought in some $125,000, boosting Deukmejian over his $3.5
million general election fund-raising goal.
Bush told some 800 contributors that President Reagan's poli
cies are "making America great again."
The administration's economic program has begun to work,
he said, although the "unemployment rate is unacceptable," a
theme that was echoed by former President Gerald Ford during
an appearance at a $1000-a-person dinner with Wilson near

Palm Springs.
Ford said the 10.1 percent unemployment is "unfortunate,"
but that all other economic signs are very encouraging.
"Unemployment is always the last economic factor that shows
any improvement. But we're going to straighten it out, we're on
the right path," Ford told reporters.
Ford said he expected Wilson to wih his U.S. Senate race
against Democratic Gov. Brown and that state Attorney Gener
al Deukmejian "is probably behind (Los Angeles' Democratic
Mayor Tom Bradley), but he's got a good shot at it."
Ford said he expected Republicans would hold the Senate and
lose no more than 10 to 20 House seats.
Bush told the Deukmejian gathering it is critical that Wilson
win California's U.S. Senate seat so the administration can "do
what we set out to do."
In the governor's race, he said, "California faces a choice like
the one the country faced two years ago."
Rebel forces kill Salvadorans
San Salvador — Leftist guerrillas yesterday claimed to have
killed or wounded 313 government troops and captured 107 oth
ers during a major offensive launched two weeks ago.
The military has reported about 150 government casualties
and about 300 guerrillas killed since the nationwide drive began
Oct. 10.
The guerrillas' clandestine Radio Venceremos (We Shall Ov
ercome) provided no breakdown on the casualties. It said rebel
forces also have seized 61,358 bullets and 130 grenades, mortars
or cannon shells during the push.
About 84 of the 107 reported captives apparently have been
released by the rebels, who claim to still be holding several mili
tary officers.
A Roman Catholic priest said yesterday that the number of
labor and leftist leaders missing in San Salvador has risen to 15.
The Rev. Jesus Delgado made the announcement during a ser
mon at the city cathedral, where handfuls of guerrilla leaflets
were tossed to worshipers.
He said the disappearences appeared aimed at widening the
split between leftist guerrillas and the U.S.-backed rightist gov
ernment, which the rebels have been fighting to topple for three
years.
Belgian consul missing yesterday
San Francisco — Belgium's honorary consul general in San
Francisco was reported missing yesterday, a day after he van
ished from his apartment residence.
Rene Thimister, 66, a former Belgian ambassador to Senegal
and Cameroon, was the official consul general in San Francisco
prior to his retirement last year from the Belgian foreign service,
said Jozef Baerten, Belgian consular attache in Washington.
"It's a reaction of shock. We can't speculate as far as reasons
go," Baerten said.
Police yesterday distributed photos and a description of
Thimister, but Sgt. Jim Long said he didn't have details of what
the consul was doing at the time of his disappearance, between
noon and Ip.m., nor did he know if there were indications of foul
play.
Thimister, who joined the Belgian foreign service in 1946, had
served in Bucharest, Romania; Athens, Greece; Calcutta, India;
Quito, Ecuador, and Vancouver, Canada, as well as in Yaounde,
Camaroon; Dakar, Senegal and San Francisco.
Among the reasons Thimister retired to San Francisco,
Baerten said, "apparently is that he has a son who is still studying
and he wanted to finish his studies in the United States."
Today's weather
Showers likely today. Highs in the 60s to low 70s. Winds
southerly at 10 to 20 mph. Chance of measurable rain increasing
to 60 percent by afternoon. A 60 percent chance of showers to

From the wires of The Associated Press and The Los Angeles Times — Washington Poet news services

Shultz makes first bilateral visit
Washington — Secretary of State George Shultz set out yesterday on a
fence-mending mission to Ottawa, prepared to discuss the full range of irri
tants in U.S.-Canadian relations.
The 24-hour trip, Shultz's First official bilateral visit to another country
since he took office last summer, is expected to be a forum for frank talk, not
new agreements.
"They will discuss the state of relations, which is not in the best of shape
these days," said one Canadian official who asked not to be identified.
"What we would like to see is a commitment to avoiding any kind of dis
ruption or deterioration in our relationship," Canadian Ambassador Alan
Gotlieb told reporters last week. "We want to clear up a number of odd mis
understandings."
Gotlieb characterized relations between the two countries as "not as bad
as they have been made out." But he acknowledged that relations recently
have often been marked by "rhetoric of a high decibel level."
Shultz planned to meet yesterday afternoon and this morning with Allan
McEachen, Canada's secretary of state for external affairs. Also on his
schedule today is lunch with Prime Minister Pierre Trudeau.
Although most of the issues on the agenda were economic, environmental
and international concerns also were expected to be broached.
Translator accused of security breach
London — Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher yesterday was asked to
make a statement to Parliament on allegations that a translator accused of
spying for the Soviets had made one of the deepest penetrations of Western
intelligence operations since World War 11.
"What we are concerned about is whether or not... our national security
is at risk," said Labor Party member of Parliament Ted Leadbitter in calling
for the statement.
He referred to a report in yesterday's New York Times that quoted uniden
tified senior American officials as saying the breach of security occurred at
the Government Communications Headquarters, Britain's worldwide
eavesdropping center, in Cheltenham.
The Times said a "mole" who penetrated the top-secret facility fed the So
viets information that could have allowed them to change their codes and
protect their own secrets.
The Times identified him as Geoffrey Prime, 44, a translator of Russian at
Cheltenham.
In July, Prime was arraigned on espionage charges that a prosecutor de
scribed then as being "of the graver.t possible nature." Prime was ordered
held in custody for a hearing at a later date.
Details of Prime's arrest were not disclosed here because of str
ingent restrictions imposed by Britain's Official Secrets Act, un
der which he was arrested.
But the Times, in a Washington-dated story, quoted American
officials as saying Prime had access to highly classified informa
tion flowing into the Cheltenham center from satellites and
ground stations operated by the United States.
Britain's Home Office — which is responsible for domestic af
fairs — the Foreign Office and the prime minister's office all de
clined comment on the report. But a spokesman for Thatcher
said the prime minister would consider Leadbitter's suggestion
that she make a statement on the affair to the House of Com
mons.
Christians to cooperate with Gemayel
Beirut — The commander-in-chief of Lebanon's Christian
militia yesterday signaled that his forces will cooperate with Pres
ident Amin Gemayel as long as he works to expel foreign forces
from the country.
"We stretch out our hand in a spirit of collaboration to the
president of the republic," said Fady Frem, leader of the Leba
nese Forces. But he added that the militia's 10, OCX) to 20,000
gunmen would continue their "struggle" until all foreigners —
meaning in particular Syrian and Palestinian forces — had left.
