Shultz makes first bilateral visit
Washington — Secretary of State George Shultz set out yesterday on a
fence-mending mission to Ottawa, prepared to discuss the full range of irri
tants in U.S.-Canadian relations.
The 24-hour trip, Shultz's First official bilateral visit to another country
since he took office last summer, is expected to be a forum for frank talk, not
new agreements.
"They will discuss the state of relations, which is not in the best of shape
these days," said one Canadian official who asked not to be identified.
"What we would like to see is a commitment to avoiding any kind of dis
ruption or deterioration in our relationship," Canadian Ambassador Alan
Gotlieb told reporters last week. "We want to clear up a number of odd mis
understandings."
Gotlieb characterized relations between the two countries as "not as bad
as they have been made out." But he acknowledged that relations recently
have often been marked by "rhetoric of a high decibel level."
Shultz planned to meet yesterday afternoon and this morning with Allan
McEachen, Canada's secretary of state for external affairs. Also on his
schedule today is lunch with Prime Minister Pierre Trudeau.
Although most of the issues on the agenda were economic, environmental
and international concerns also were expected to be broached.
Translator accused of security breach
London — Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher yesterday was asked to
make a statement to Parliament on allegations that a translator accused of
spying for the Soviets had made one of the deepest penetrations of Western
intelligence operations since World War 11.
"What we are concerned about is whether or not... our national security
is at risk," said Labor Party member of Parliament Ted Leadbitter in calling
for the statement.
He referred to a report in yesterday's New York Times that quoted uniden
tified senior American officials as saying the breach of security occurred at
the Government Communications Headquarters, Britain's worldwide
eavesdropping center, in Cheltenham.
The Times said a "mole" who penetrated the top-secret facility fed the So
viets information that could have allowed them to change their codes and
protect their own secrets.
The Times identified him as Geoffrey Prime, 44, a translator of Russian at
Cheltenham.
In July, Prime was arraigned on espionage charges that a prosecutor de
scribed then as being "of the graver.t possible nature." Prime was ordered
held in custody for a hearing at a later date.
