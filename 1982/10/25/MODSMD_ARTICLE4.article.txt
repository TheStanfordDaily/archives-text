## 
### SID ATKINS Staff writer 
Police reported yesterday that they
were making progress in the investiga
tion of the murder of Angela Arvidson,
the Stanford junior who was stabbed to
death Friday in a home in the Faculty
Ghetto.
"We're in better shape today than
yesterday," Santa Clara County Sheriff
Robert Winter said last night. The de
partment was checking several leads in
volving delivery people. Winter said.
Others close to the case, including
San Francisco television station KPIX
and Donald Arvidson, the victim's
father, said that police had identified a
particular suspect and automibile in
volved in the murder. Police issued an
All Points Bulletin on a suspect yester
day morning, the victim's father told
ihe Daily.
Winter, however, refused to confirm
these reports. He is expected to hold a
news conference today at 10 a.m.
Arvidson, 20, of Portland, Oregon,
was found slain in the home of Med
School Prof. Laurence Kedes, which
was located on 856 Allardice on
Frenchman's hill. Kedes' son Todd, 16,
found Arvidson's body on the living
room couch when he returned home at
approximately 3:15 p.m. Friday and
quickly phoned paramedics.
University officials are offering a re
ward of $10,000 for information result
ing in the arrest and conviction of the
person or persons responsible for the
murder of Arvidson. Persons with in
formation may contact the detective
bureau of the Santa Clara Sheriffs De
partment at (408) 299-2211 or the Stan
ford Police at (415)497-9633.
Arvidson, a junior honors student in

the humanities special program, had
been working at the Kedes' for two
weeks to help pay her way through
school. She also worked at the Coffee
House, Energy Resource Lab and the
Psychology Department while here.
A coroner's spokesman said that
Arvidson died from multiple stab
wounds to the chest and abdomen. She
also sustained stab wounds to the
throat. After performing an autopsy,
the coroner determined that she was not
raped.
Stanford Police Chief Marvin Her
rington said there was no evidence that
the Kedes' house had been forcefully
entered, and that they have discovered
nothing missing from the house that
would indicate a burglary. Herrington
added that there were no witnesses to
the crime. "We've interviewed everyone
on the block, but nobody heard or saw
anything," he said.
Herrington said the sheriffs depart
ment is handling the investigation.
"They're checking out numerous leads.
Most of them involve various service
people in the area — telephone
workmen, gardeners, roofers, and oth
ers. The telephone company was doing
a large installation project with about
30 people in the area, so we're checking
to see if they saw anything or were in
volved."
Herrington said detectives were also
checking out Arvidson's "wide range of
acquaintances."
Arvidson's parents, who also live in
Portland, flew to the Stanford area Sat
urday afternoon. Late that day, they
were briefed on the specifics of the case
by Herrington and a collection of other
University officials at the home of Dean
of Student Affairs James Lyons.

Arvidson's mother, Marlene Torrcy,
father, Donald Arvidson, and step
father, Michael Torrey, all attended the
meeting. They were joined by Randall
Arvidson, the victim's brother, who is a
senior majoring in economics here.
M rs. Torrey, visibly shaken, said of
her daughter,"She was a bright, vi
brant, lovely young lady. I can't under
stand why anybody would do this. She
just loved Stanford."
Mr. Torrey said she hopes the police
find the person or persons responsible
for her daughter's murder soon. "I
hope that they get him off the
streets.. .he must not be allowed to do
this to other Angelas."
Lyons said that students around
campus were shocked when they heard
about the killing. "There's no explana
tion for this killing right now — that's
one reason why this is so frightening for
students," Lyons said. He added that
Arvidson had many close friends on
campus.
The resident assistant at the French
House, Gordon Hecker, described the
effect that learning about the incident
had on his house, where Arvidson ate
dinner often. "The Octoberfest (one of
the bigger annual campus parties) was
blaring away next door, but everybody
in our house just sat around and stared
at the floor all night. It was terrible."
Kedes moved back into his house on
Saturday, but was still unwilling to dis
cuss the case. "All that I could add
would be gossip," he said.
Other residents of Frenchman's hill,
who asked not to be identified, ex
pressed their concern Friday night with
the recent events in their neighborhood.

Mr. Torrey said she hopes the police
find the person or persons responsible
for her daughter's murder soon. "I
hope that they get him off the
streets.. .he must not be allowed to do
this to other Angelas."
Lyons said that students around
campus were shocked when they heard
about the killing. "There's no explana
tion for this killing right now — that's
one reason why this is so frightening for
students," Lyons said. He added that
Arvidson had many close friends on
campus.
The resident assistant at the French
House, Gordon Hecker, described the
effect that learning about the incident
had on his house, where Arvidson ate
dinner often. "The Octoberfest (one of
the bigger annual campus parties) was
blaring away next door, but everybody
in our house just sat around and stared
at the floor all night. It was terrible."
Kedes moved back into his house on
Saturday, but was still unwilling to dis
cuss the case. "All that I could add
would be gossip," he said.
Other residents of Frenchman's hill,
who asked not to be identified, ex
pressed their concern Friday night with
the recent events in their neighborhood.

The last campus murder occurred in
August 1978. There have been five cam
pus murders in the last 10 years, four of
which have been stabbings.
Police reported yesterday that they
were making progress in the investiga
tion of the murder of Angela Arvidson,
the Stanford junior who was stabbed to
death Friday in a home in the Faculty
Ghetto.
"We're in better shape today than
yesterday," Santa Clara County Sheriff
Robert Winter said last night. The de
partment was checking several leads in
volving delivery people. Winter said.
Others close to the case, including
San Francisco television station KPIX
and Donald Arvidson, the victim's
father, said that police had identified a
particular suspect and automibile in
volved in the murder. Police issued an
All Points Bulletin on a suspect yester
day morning, the victim's father told
ihe Daily.
Winter, however, refused to confirm
these reports. He is expected to hold a
news conference today at 10 a.m.
Arvidson, 20, of Portland, Oregon,
was found slain in the home of Med
School Prof. Laurence Kedes, which
was located on 856 Allardice on
Frenchman's hill. Kedes' son Todd, 16,
found Arvidson's body on the living
room couch when he returned home at
approximately 3:15 p.m. Friday and
quickly phoned paramedics.
University officials are offering a re
ward of $10,000 for information result
ing in the arrest and conviction of the
person or persons responsible for the
murder of Arvidson. Persons with in
formation may contact the detective
bureau of the Santa Clara Sheriffs De
partment at (408) 299-2211 or the Stan
ford Police at (415)497-9633.
Arvidson, a junior honors student in

the humanities special program, had
been working at the Kedes' for two
weeks to help pay her way through
school. She also worked at the Coffee
House, Energy Resource Lab and the
Psychology Department while here.
A coroner's spokesman said that
Arvidson died from multiple stab
wounds to the chest and abdomen. She
also sustained stab wounds to the
throat. After performing an autopsy,
the coroner determined that she was not
raped.
Stanford Police Chief Marvin Her
rington said there was no evidence that
the Kedes' house had been forcefully
entered, and that they have discovered
nothing missing from the house that
would indicate a burglary. Herrington
added that there were no witnesses to
the crime. "We've interviewed everyone
on the block, but nobody heard or saw
anything," he said.
Herrington said the sheriffs depart
ment is handling the investigation.
"They're checking out numerous leads.
Most of them involve various service
people in the area — telephone
workmen, gardeners, roofers, and oth
ers. The telephone company was doing
a large installation project with about
30 people in the area, so we're checking
to see if they saw anything or were in
volved."
Herrington said detectives were also
checking out Arvidson's "wide range of
acquaintances."
Arvidson's parents, who also live in
Portland, flew to the Stanford area Sat
urday afternoon. Late that day, they
were briefed on the specifics of the case
by Herrington and a collection of other
University officials at the home of Dean
of Student Affairs James Lyons.

Arvidson's mother, Marlene Torrcy,
father, Donald Arvidson, and step
father, Michael Torrey, all attended the
meeting. They were joined by Randall
Arvidson, the victim's brother, who is a
senior majoring in economics here.
M rs. Torrey, visibly shaken, said of
her daughter,"She was a bright, vi
brant, lovely young lady. I can't under
stand why anybody would do this. She
just loved Stanford."
Mr. Torrey said she hopes the police
find the person or persons responsible
for her daughter's murder soon. "I
hope that they get him off the
