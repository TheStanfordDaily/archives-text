San Jose — A Silicon Vallev audience
chipped in to San Diego Mayor Pete
Wilson's U.S. Senate campaign Friday
at a dinner featuring U.S. Treasury Sec
retary Donald Regan.
Wilson shared the podium — and the
proceeds — with the man he beat in a
hitter Republican primary race, Rep.
Pete McCloskev of Menlo Park. Mc-
Closkev will pay off campaign debts
with his 25 percent share of the $75,000
take, while the rest of the monev goes to
Wilson.
Wilson praised his former foe, label
ing McCloskev "tough-minded" and
"hard-hitting." "I have have had the
good fortune to prevail over an infinite
ly better man than I will face in the (gen
eral) election," he said.
McCloskev had kind words for

Wilson, too. As senator, he said Wilson
"will not be a captive of organized labor
here." Avoiding unionism, he said, is
essential to Silicon Vallev's continued
success.
"I am delighted to be in Pete Mc-
Closkev country," Wilson greeted the

crowd of 400. He was hardlv exaggerat
ing. Many in attendance had supported
McCloskev since he first took office in
1967.
Wilson attacked Gov. Brown, his
Democratic opponent, hut said the men
have one thing in common. "We are in

agreement . . . that high-technology is
going to he the engine that drives this
country for years to come," he said.
Hewlett Packard Co. President John
Young, who emceed the event, said that
Brown's interest in the electronics in
dustry is new. "Small is beautiful,"
Brown's credo in the last election, "was
not referring to the microprocessor
chip," Young said.
Wilson said he advocated the
elimination of conflicting trade poli
cies. He said auto-makers, for example,
are told "clean up the air, but don't col
laborate on research and development
or we'll slap an anti-trust suit on you."
Regan told the high-tech crowd that
President Reagan's economic plan is
working.
When the Republicans took over in
January, 1981, Regan said, the econo
