# Gymnast injury suit settled out of court
## 
### BILL AINSWORTH 
An $18 million personal injury suit
filed against the University by a gym
nast who became paralyzed after suffer
ing an accident here three years ago was
settled last Thursday when parties
agreed to an out of court settlement.
Parties on both sides of the case re
fused to disclose the monetary value of
the agreement due to a stipulation in the
settlement which prohibited such a dis
closure.
The settlement came during the final
stages of the five-week-long trial. It
called for the University to provide for
William Brodie Lockard's " basic
future medical care even thouah it has
no legal obligation to do so." The settle

nient assigns no responsibility to the
University for the accident.
According to Lockard's mother. Dr.
Dorothy Lockard, expenses for his care
and hospitalization have totalled more
than $550,000 in the three years since
the accident. The costs required for
Lockard to live at home and attend
school are $ 15,000 per month, she said.
However, Lockard refused to comment
on how much of these costs are included
in the agreement and how long the Uni
versity will continue to pay the costs.
David Sabih, one of Lockard's at
torneys, said that his side agreed to set
tle the case because of the pressures of
running out of money to care for
Lockard and because thev felt the set

tlement was adequate. Sabih said
Lockard's nurses were scheduled to be
released on Nov. I because there was no
more money left to pav them.
Dr. Lockard said the Athletic De
partment's insurance and Lockard's
father's insurance, which had split the
large majority of the costs for his
care had run out in the middle of Au
gust. Since that time Lockard's mother
said they were "using other means" to
pay the costs of her son's care.
Another reason the Lockards wanted
to settle, according to Sabih, was the
University's decision, at the request of
the insurance companv, to cut off sup
plementary payments that they had
made to the Lockards since the accident

occurred. These pavments were made
sporadically bv the University, accord
ing to his mother, to speed the progress
of obtaining equipment and care for
Lockard.
Lockard and Sabih both expressed
their gratitude toward the University
for "standing bv" Lockard. "Stanford
University showed its greatest heart
through the whole proceedings," Sabih
said.
The amount of the settlement was not
disclosed at the request of the insurance
company, as both the University and
Lockard's attorneys said thev had no
reason for keeping the terms of the
agreement secret.
Bob Beth, University director of in
surance and risk management, said one
of the reasons the insurance company
did not want to disclose the value of the
settlement was that they do not want
others making personal injury claims to
feel they were entitled to similar
amounts.
Beth, however, said the settlement
was not large. "It wasn't anything any
body would gag on," he said.
Although the University agreed on
the settlement, the insurance company
was primarily responsible for the de
cision to settle, Beth said.
"Our intent was to see Brodie taken
care of," he said.
Negotations to settle the case out of
court have been going on for two years,
Beth said. These negotiations included
representatives from the two legal firms
and the insurance company but no rep
resentatives employed directly by the
University, he said.

Negotiations were going on through
out the trial, but the discussions were
not set up on a planned course; rather,
they were arranged during certain
points in the trial when the negotiators
were available, Beth said.
Lockard said about the trial, "We're
relieved that it's over and we know
where we stand and Brodie can get on
with his life."
