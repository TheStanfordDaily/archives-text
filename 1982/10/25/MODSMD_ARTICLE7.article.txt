## Mideast: turmoil continues; peace efforts stalled U.S. urges Mideast negotiations

C ompited from news reports and wire services
In yet another bid to establish peace in the
Mideast, President Reagan met with Arab
leaders last Friday to encourage the resump
tion of peace talks with Israel.
Though Reagan termed the meeting with
the Arab foreign ministers "an important
milestone along the road to a common objec
tive â€” a just and lasting peace in the Middle
East," neither side appeared to change its
position on anything.
The six representatives, including King
Hussan II of Morocco, said rescheduling of
peace talks hinges on approval from the
Palestinian Liberation Organization, which
they regard as the sole representative of the
Palestinian people.
Absent from the three-hour meeting was
King Hussein of Jordan who has remained
firm in his refusal to enter negotiations with
Israel despite repeated U.S. urgings.
The delegation, headed by Hassan, in
cluded Arab League Secretary General
Chedli Klibi and the foreign ministers of Mo
rocco, Algeria, Syria, Saudi Arabia, Tunisia
and Jordan.
The encouragement came chiefly from
Hassan who told Reagan as the delegation
left the White House that the goal of both the
United States and Arab League is "peace,
coexistance and construction for the welfare

of the region and all mankind." One adminis
tration official who briefed reporters in
terpreted the remark to mean that there was
no question Hassan meant coexistence
among all countries of the Mideast, not just
between Israeli and Palestinian people.
Despite the administration's optimism,
there was evidently no movement toward re
solving specific differences creating the Arab-
Israeli impasse. The Arab foreign ministers
reiterated their demands for recognition of
the PLO and Reagan stood by the United
States' insistence that the first step toward
peace should be Arab recognition of Israel to
be followed by direct negotiations between
the two sides.
On the eve of the meetings, state depart
ment officials said they believed Jordan's
Hussein could be convinced to negotiate with
Israel on behalf of the 1.4 million Arab
Palestinians living on the Israeli-occupied
West Bank and Gaza Strip for self-govern
ment if moderate Arab states would support
him.
Exchange between Reagan and Hassan
dominated most of the White House talks.
The president reviewed the Mideast peace
strategy outlined Sept. I, and Hassan went
over the positions adopted a few days later at
an Arab League summit meeting in Fez, Mo
rocco.

In addition to the call for Palestinian self
rule on the West Bank and Gaza strip based
on the 1978 Camp David agreements, the
president said the United States would not
support either an Israeli annexation of the
areas or an independent Palestinian state.
Hassan repeated the Arab call for Israel to
return all lands occupied since 1967. Al
though he made no direct reference to Israel,
Hassan said it was his belief that an agree
ment should be based on U.N. Security
Council resolutions adopted in 1967 and 1973
which implicitly recognize Israel's right to ex
ist and call for a peaceful settlement in the re
gion. But they make no reference to a Palesti
nian homeland, a long sought-after Arab
goal.
As he bade farewell to the delegation, Rea
gan said the two sides had listened to each
other in "a spirit of good will, understanding
and mutual respect'.'
Reagan also said achievement of a Mideast
peace will require arrangements that provide
both for security of all the states in the area
and for "a sense of identity for the Palestinian
people." Although the president expressed
hope for renewed negotiations the adminis
tration official who briefed reporters said
there is no clear picture of what the next step
might be.
