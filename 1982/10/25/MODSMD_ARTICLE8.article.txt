# Lebanon asks increased peace force

Compiled from news reports and wire services
Lebanese President Amin Gemayel returned Friday from a
whirlwind overseas tour and described the leaders he met as "extreme
ly responsive to our pleas for help in the process of restoring peace and
the reconstruction of Lebanon."
Pending the complete withdrawal of Israeli, Syrian and Palestinian
forces from all of Lebanon, Gemayel, during his visit to France, the
United States and Italy, requested an increase in the size and scope of
the international peacekeeping force.
The combined force now numbers 3400 men and is on limited as
signment in Beirut. Most of the 1200 U.S. Marines are stationed at
Beirut International Airport, while other areas are patrolled by
French and Italian troops.
In Washington, the Lebanese leader conferred with President Rea
gan on an expanded three-nation role, possibly into the Bekaa Valley
in eastern and northern Lebanon, where Syrian and Palestinian forces
are located, and in the south where the Israelis are situated.
Gemayel discussed an increase from 3400 men to as many as 20,000,
who would remain in Lebanon until the withdrawal of every last Is
raeli, Syrian and Palestinian fighter.
Although there were no requests for a specifically numbered in
crease in the U.S. contingent, if is assumed that augmenting the in
ternational force would include additional contributions from the
United States.
The United States have suggested that they may increase military
assistance to enable the Lebanese Army to re-establish control over all
of Lebanon's 4015 square miles, but they have not revealed any de
tails.
Reagan promised to give Gemayel's request "serious considera
tion," but Defense Secretary Caspar Weinberger said Thursday that
he did not expect to see an increase in the size of the Marine forces in
Lebanon. Weinberger suggested that countries other than the Unites
States, France and Italy should provide additional troops.
Gemayel said at a news conference in Paris that he would like to see
the 3400-man multinational force expanded to about 30,000 pending
the army's reconstruction program.
The Lebanese leader told Italian officials that his immediate goal

was to reorganize and expand the Lebanese Army into an elite force of
about 60,000, according to Foreign Ministry sources in Rome. He re
portedly said Lebanon would need at least 15,000 multinational
troops to help with internal security in the initial stage.
Rapid solutions to Lebanon's problems, however, will not be forth
coming. The Syrian, Israeli and Palestinian willingness to withdraw is
contingent on Lebanon's agreement to sign a security pact with Israel.
The Israeli insistence on a "security agreement" with Lebanon as
the first step towards an eventual peace treaty puts Gemayel in an
awkward position, because signing both pacts with Israel could cause
trouble with other Arab nations.
The ravaged Lebanon needs large-scale help in rebuilding both
country and economy — estimates ranging as high as $10 billion to
$15 billion — and Gemayel is counting on the Arabs to provide much
of the reconstruction aid.
The lack of consensus on how to effect withdrawal is also a main
problem. The Syrians, who have 30,000 troops in Lebanon, will leave
Only after Israel, deemed an "invader," pulls its troops out. Israel de
mands that the Palestinian Liberation Organization's 8000 troops pull
back first; Israel and Syria will then leave simultaneously, provided
that the security agreement with Lebanon is signed.
The Palestine Liberation Organization, however, has not indicated
when it wants to depart, although Chief Yasser Arafat assured
Gemayel of PLO willingness to withdraw. The independent news
paper An-Nahar reported that unnamed sources had said that the
pullback would be completed by Nov. 22. t>i
Furthermore, the Israelis are averse to an international peace
keeping force in southern Lebanon, and want only Lebanese forces.
But the Lebanese clearly do not believe that their army could cover the
country at this point, and they would prefer to see a combination of an
expanded American-French-Italian force and a 7000-man United Na
tions force patrol larger parts of Lebanon in general.
