## Soviet peace delegation encourages nuclear freeze 
### SANDRA BODOVITZ 
The Soviet Union is as interested
in limiting nuclear arms production
as are U.S. nuclear freeze sup
porters, a member of a Soviet peace
delegation said Saturday.
"There is no weapon that our
country would not be ready to limit
or ban on a reciprocal basis .... We
have agreed not to be the first to use
nuclear weapons," Vladimir Grant
man told a Dinkelspiel Auditorium
audience.
* Gantman spoke at "In
ter/national In/Security In The Nu
clear Age", a day-long program of
panel and workshop discussions
ponceming the nuclear arms race.
Gantman denied that it was possible
to survive a nuclear war.
* "A nuclear war cannot be won.
â€¢The idea of limited nuclear war is in
correct ... to expect to win a nuclear
Avar is madness," he said.
- In terms of U.S. or Soviet superi
ority, he said he does not believe that
jf the United States were to freeze
jiow, its national security would be
jn any danger.
* Gantman said the Soviet Union
>as committed to maintaining
peace. He pointed out that the secur
ity of both the Soviet Union and the
United States, is interrelated.
"We in the Soviet Union have no
idea to threaten the United States of
America. We have no idea to invade
Western Europe or Florida or to oc

cupy Niagara Falls but it is impor
tant for us to have no threat from the
United States, NATO or other
forces. We must be safe. We can and
must improve Soviet-American rela
tions," he said.
The way to improve these rela
tions is through the freeze process,
Gantman suggested.
The international nature of nucle
ar proliferation was also addressed
by Gantman. He said, "Real na
tional security is security for the
whole of the international com
munity."
The seven-member Peace Delega
tion which Gantman represented
was formed by the Soviet Peace
Committee after a similar U.S. dele
gation toured the Soviet Union last
year. Gantman is a professor at the
Institute of World Economy and In
ternational Relations and a member
of the Disarmament Commission of
the Soviet Peace Committee.
Political Science Prof. Alexander
Dallin, chairman of the program in
international relations, stressed the
importance of this kind of continu
ing contact between the two nations
as a way to build confidence. These
contacts allow both nations to gain
experience in the "implementation
of verifiable agreements." Dallin
criticized restricting these visits.
The program, the kick-off event
of "Fate of the Earth" week which
runs until Friday, was sponsored by
Residential Education in conjunc

tion with six other campus groups.
Alice Supton, assistant dean of
residential education, was one of the
coordinators of the event. She said
the motivation behind the program
was to present different viewpoints
in an effort to stimulate student dis
cussions. The audience of less than
200 was composed mainly of com
munity members and included only
a small student turnout.
The program began with a dis
cussion of "International Relations
and the Arms Race."
One panel member, Political Sci
ence Prof. Condoleeza Rice ad
dressed the issue of U.S.-Soviet
coexistence. She said the historical
antagonism of Russia and the Unit
ed States stemmed from U.S. misun
derstanding of Bolshevism and Sovi
et misunderstanding of U.S. internal
economic and political structures.
The arms race, she said, was a result
of "conflict and competition" be
tween the two super powers. She en
dorsed arms control as a "man
agement strategy for the working
out of differences."
Panel member Robert North, also
a professor of political science, em
phasized the need for positive
leverage in negotiations as opposed
to negative demands. "The Soviet
Union and the United States do
have a common ground; the desire
to survive," he said.
Philip Farley, a senior research as
sociate with the arms control and

disarmament program, spoke about
the relationship between arms con
trol and the arms race. He expressed
concern over the concept of nuclear
war as "survivable."
The belief that a nuclear war is
survivable, he said, will increase in
stability within the realm of interna
tional relations. Farley advocated
citizen involvement and interest in
U.S. defense policy as a first step
towards affecting changes in na
tional nuclear arms policies.
The second group of panelists dis
cussed "Nuclear Weapons Policy
and National Security." Panel mem
bers included; Dr. Robert Barker,
manager of the special projects pro
gram at the Lawrence Livermore
Laboratory and advocate of a strong
nuclear capability. Dr. Gloria Duf
fy. director of the Ploughshare
Foundation of San Francisco and
supporter of minimum deterence,
and. Dave McFadden, co-founder
and director of the Mid-Peninsula
Conversion Project and proponent
of bilateral nuclear disarmament.
Barker said he thought that he had
been misrepresented on the posters
released for the event.
After the second panel discussion
workshops convened to provide an
informal setting to discuss the issues
of the morning. Workshop topics
ranged from the "California Freeze
Initiative" to "Military Funding of
Research at Stanford."
