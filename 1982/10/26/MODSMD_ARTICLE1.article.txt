# Police identify man with criminal record as suspect in Arvidson killing
## 
### SID ATKINS Staff writer 
Police are searching for one suspect in connec
tion with Friday's slaying of Stanford student
Angela Arvidson, Santa Clara County Sheriff
Robert Winter said yesterday.
Winter identified the suspect as Donald John
Amos, 29, a delivery man from San Jose. Police
did not reveal the name of the company that
employs Amos. Police described Amos as a male
Caucasian, six-foot three-inches tall, 210 pounds,
with dirty blond hair and green eyes.
An all-points bulletin broadcast Sunday stated
that Amos is believed to be headed toward Butte
county in the California's Central Valley, where
he has relatives. But Lieutenant Ron Conway,
assistant detective commander for the Sheriffs
Department said "realistically, he could be any

where." Amos did not show up for work yester
day morning.
Police are searching for a 1976 Mercury
Monarch with a dark blue top, California license
304 NEO, with a missing front grill. It has only a
rear license plate.
Arvidson, 20, a junior in the humanities special
program, was performing housekeeping chores in
the home of Medical School Prof. Laurence
Kedes when she was stabbed to death. The
Kedes' live on Frenchman's Hill in the Faculty
Ghetto. She had worked for the Kedes family for
two weeks, earning money to help pay her way
through school.
"We know that Amos made a delivery late that
afternoon in the neighborhood, ami we have dis
covered blood-stained clothing in his apart
ment," Conway said.

Winter said, "There is a strong likelihood that
he made a delivery at the Kedes' house. We do
have other reasons to tie him in to the vicinity
itself, but I'm not at liberty to disclose those leads
at the present time. We're working on them,
we're solidifying them and they probably will be
used in an evidentiary way."
Police found the blood-stained clothing in
Amos' apartment on Friday night after entering
with a search warrant. Conway said they were
able to obtain the warrant after gathering infor
mation about Amos from employees of the com
pany where he worked. The search did not reveal
a weapon that could be linked to the crime.
Winter said that this "appears to be a crime of
violence and possibly sexual assault." However,
an autopsy conducted Saturday revealed that
Arvidson had not been raped.

Conway refused to speculate on a possible mo
tive for the crime. "There's still a lot we don't
know,"he said, "but we have no reason to believe
that the suspect knew Arvidson before the inci
dent."
Conway also said Amos has an extensive crim
inal record. The suspect has been previously ar
rested for rape, kidnapping and assault with a
deadly weapon. Amos spent time in the Santa
Cruz County jail in 1975 for the latter charge,
according to Conway.
The University has offered a $10,000 reward
for information resulting in the arrest and convic
tion of Arvidson's killer. Individuals with infor
mation should contact the Santa Clara County
Sherriffs Office at (408) 299-2211 (days) or
(408) 299-2622 (nights).
