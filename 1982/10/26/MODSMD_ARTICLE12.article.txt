## The 						Stanford Daily Tom Lantos for Congress 
### 
Recent gerrymandering will place the University
out of the 12th Congressional District represented
by the soon-to-retire Rep. Pete McCloskey (R-
Menlo Park) and into the 11th District, which will
probably be represented by either Republican Bill
Rover or Democrat Tom Lantos. We will cast our
votes for Lantos.
This campaign, which pits a liberal Democrat
against a traditional conservative Republican, is
notorious even by California standards, and Lan
tos has emerged the least tattered fighter. The cam
paign has become nasty for a variety of reasons,
ranging from the closeness of the race (most polls
show the candidates to be running even) to the fact
that the two are running against each other for the
second time (Lantos won by less than 6000 votes in
1980). Leaders of both the Democratic and Re
publican parties have encouraged the candidates to
eschew the comparatively dainty treatment they
gave each other two years ago.
Rover seems to be going a bit overboard, how
ever. In his zeal to portray Lantos as a greedy liber
al, Rover released a television commercial which
showed an actor resembling Lantos eating an apple
pie and belching while an off-camera voice charged
that the incumbent voted against President Rea
gan's proposed income tax cuts but approved a
congressional tax break which would give Lantos a
$19,000 deduction. Royer also has not disavowed
McCloskey's statement accusing Lantos, a Hun
garian-born Jew, of raising much of his money
from Jewish community sources who want to elect
candidates "sympathetic to Israel."
But Lantos' campaign has not been devoid of dir
ty tactics. Lantos called Royer's allegations about
his tax deductions "the lie of the week" and re
leased a commercial which featured a drawing of
Pinocchio with a small nose. The nose then grew
longer after an off-camera announcer cited Royer's
charges. However, Lantos released a 1981 tax re
turn which showed that he did not take the $19,000
deduction.
The issues are more important than the campaign
tactics, though. And on the issues we disagree with
many of Royer's stands and agree with most of
Lantos'. Lantos shows a commitment to education
which extends far beyond Royer's rhetoric. Student
loans are clearly one of Lantos' top priorities, and
he has fought proposed cuts in education in his two
years in Congress with a fervor we doubt the Re
publican will have. Royer also indicated that he
feels student loans should be tied to draft regis
tration, a stand which signifies support of what we

consider a discriminatory law.
Lantos's experience on the House Foreign Af
fairs Committee has given him valuable knowledge
and has imbued him with reasonable attitudes
toward international affairs and weapons systems.
Though both candidates support Proposition 12,
the proposed nuclear arms freeze, Lantos has op
posed the MX Missile and the B-l bomber, whereas
Rover voted for both weapons systems during his
congressional term three years ago.
Lantos has been a strong advocate of keeping hu
man rights an important criterion in deciding U.S.
military and economic aid around the world. In op
position to Reagan's attempts at sidestepping hu
man rights issues when convenient, he has opposed
U.S. aid to El Salvador and the administration's
misguided efforts to certify progress on human
rights there.
The economy dominates the headlines, however,
and it seems that Royer, who is receiving substan
tial financial support from conservative political
action committees, will be likely to rubber-stamp
many of the Reagan administration's economic
formulas, whereas Lantos will remain the strident
critic of Reaganomics he has been since Reagan
took office. Rover indicated support (though luke
warm) for the third year of tax cuts and for the bal
anced budget amendment, two issues which will
almost certainly come up in the next Congress.
Lantos has opposed the tax cuts ever since taking
office and said he would vote against the balanced
budget amendment.
Lantos also shows admirable concern about what
he called the "Jesse Helms social agenda," (abor
tion restriction, school prayer issues etc.) and
pointed out that he is one of Congress' most fer
vent supporters of the Equal Rights Amendment
and of abortion rights and one of the strongest op
ponents of organized school prayer. Though Royer
indicated that he supports the ERA, he favors cuts
in federal funding for abortions, which would effec
tively discriminate against poor women unable to
afford them while allowing more economically ad
vantaged women to retain the option of an abor
tion. He also has supported the stripping of the
power of the courts which would accompany laws
allowing organized school prayer.
It is his quiet intelligence and passionate belief in
principle that make Tom Lantos the best candidate
for Congress. His commitment to education, open
research, the environment, fundamental social ser
vices and intelligent spending make him, despite
Royer's innuendo, one of us. He deserves your
vote.

man rights an important criterion in deciding U.S.
military and economic aid around the world. In op
position to Reagan's attempts at sidestepping hu
man rights issues when convenient, he has opposed
U.S. aid to El Salvador and the administration's
misguided efforts to certify progress on human
rights there.
The economy dominates the headlines, however,
and it seems that Royer, who is receiving substan
tial financial support from conservative political
action committees, will be likely to rubber-stamp
many of the Reagan administration's economic
formulas, whereas Lantos will remain the strident
critic of Reaganomics he has been since Reagan
took office. Rover indicated support (though luke
warm) for the third year of tax cuts and for the bal
anced budget amendment, two issues which will
almost certainly come up in the next Congress.
Lantos has opposed the tax cuts ever since taking
office and said he would vote against the balanced
budget amendment.
Lantos also shows admirable concern about what
he called the "Jesse Helms social agenda," (abor
tion restriction, school prayer issues etc.) and
pointed out that he is one of Congress' most fer
vent supporters of the Equal Rights Amendment
and of abortion rights and one of the strongest op
ponents of organized school prayer. Though Royer
indicated that he supports the ERA, he favors cuts
in federal funding for abortions, which would effec
tively discriminate against poor women unable to
afford them while allowing more economically ad
vantaged women to retain the option of an abor
tion. He also has supported the stripping of the
power of the courts which would accompany laws
allowing organized school prayer.
It is his quiet intelligence and passionate belief in
principle that make Tom Lantos the best candidate
for Congress. His commitment to education, open
research, the environment, fundamental social ser
vices and intelligent spending make him, despite
Royer's innuendo, one of us. He deserves your
vote.
Recent gerrymandering will place the University
out of the 12th Congressional District represented
by the soon-to-retire Rep. Pete McCloskey (R-
Menlo Park) and into the 11th District, which will
probably be represented by either Republican Bill
Rover or Democrat Tom Lantos. We will cast our
votes for Lantos.
This campaign, which pits a liberal Democrat
against a traditional conservative Republican, is
notorious even by California standards, and Lan
tos has emerged the least tattered fighter. The cam
paign has become nasty for a variety of reasons,
ranging from the closeness of the race (most polls
show the candidates to be running even) to the fact
that the two are running against each other for the
second time (Lantos won by less than 6000 votes in
1980). Leaders of both the Democratic and Re
publican parties have encouraged the candidates to
eschew the comparatively dainty treatment they
gave each other two years ago.
Rover seems to be going a bit overboard, how
ever. In his zeal to portray Lantos as a greedy liber
al, Rover released a television commercial which
showed an actor resembling Lantos eating an apple
pie and belching while an off-camera voice charged
that the incumbent voted against President Rea
gan's proposed income tax cuts but approved a
congressional tax break which would give Lantos a
$19,000 deduction. Royer also has not disavowed
McCloskey's statement accusing Lantos, a Hun
garian-born Jew, of raising much of his money
from Jewish community sources who want to elect
candidates "sympathetic to Israel."
But Lantos' campaign has not been devoid of dir
ty tactics. Lantos called Royer's allegations about
his tax deductions "the lie of the week" and re
leased a commercial which featured a drawing of
Pinocchio with a small nose. The nose then grew
longer after an off-camera announcer cited Royer's
charges. However, Lantos released a 1981 tax re
turn which showed that he did not take the $19,000
deduction.
The issues are more important than the campaign
tactics, though. And on the issues we disagree with
many of Royer's stands and agree with most of
Lantos'. Lantos shows a commitment to education
which extends far beyond Royer's rhetoric. Student
loans are clearly one of Lantos' top priorities, and
he has fought proposed cuts in education in his two
years in Congress with a fervor we doubt the Re
publican will have. Royer also indicated that he
feels student loans should be tied to draft regis
tration, a stand which signifies support of what we

consider a discriminatory law.
Lantos's experience on the House Foreign Af
fairs Committee has given him valuable knowledge
and has imbued him with reasonable attitudes
toward international affairs and weapons systems.
Though both candidates support Proposition 12,
the proposed nuclear arms freeze, Lantos has op
posed the MX Missile and the B-l bomber, whereas
Rover voted for both weapons systems during his
congressional term three years ago.
